# What Do You Think ....... About Humanities, Science Requirements?

### FRANK HUNTRESS 
Do you think Stanford undergraduates should be required to take
courses in humanities, social sciences and laboratory sciences?
The student committee for the Study of Undergraduate Education has
i.?commended that the Univer ity requirements in these fieids total
ing 34 ui.its. T.ni. is pai tof a 55-uni.t four-year requirement wirich includes
Yd units ol We-tern Civ and nine units of English.
Currently, 45 units are required for entrance into upper division. But
1;. t pi'ing quarter the Academic Council voted 'to discontinue upper and
lower divi.-ion distinctions and substitute one four-year undergraduate
j.i ogram.
The tuder.t committee has submitted its propo al.s to the Executive
Committee of the Study of Undergraduate Education for faculty and ad
ministrative deliberation.
The revamping of the humanities:, .• ocial science and Laboratory science
requirements was a major part of the student committee's program. In an
effort to get .student opinion, The Daily interviewed the following students
on the wisdom of requirements in these fields:
Tony Jones, '59, Wilbur: "I think it is a good idea. It is important to
take humanities and social sciences because in these courses you get n
broader view of 'the world. It's better to get a more liberal education and
not to get too technical. You get technical knowledge of, say, bacterial
warfare in biology lab, but it's better to get a broader view."
Barbara Gillespie, '58, Sterling: "I think this requirement h a good
i<ita for everybody, but especially for tiie science majors who often cram
their four years with nothing, but courses in t heir own field. I here's plenty
to ku:n in the Phyacs Department, but I believe that a good physicist
today must have some background in the humanities. Science is more and
mare -yrJ.hesizing with other phases of life, and to make wise decision; and
fuliy use his kn iwledge I think any liberal arts major should take science
courses, if only to learn how the world around him works. I beiieve this
requirement is a good innovation if there is a sufficiently wide range of
courses for ..tudents to choose fiom according to itheir intere.ts."
Dick lieyna, 's<i, Alpha Sigma Phi: "I don't think that 34 units is
enough, particularly for an engineering major. The School of Engineering
is one of the tightest in the University; it's merely a highly technical trade
school. From it you get very little education. As: an engineering major,
I wi: h I were required to take more."
Frelene Kovacs, '57, Union: "No, I donlt feel iab science should be
required. The entrance requirements to Stanford require two years of,
fcience. This is, 1 think, enough of an introduction to science. If the interest
is present, the student will take further cience courses anyway; if not, it
is a waste of time, money and effort to force undergraduates to take any
further courses."

Jim Morrison, '59, Wilbur: "I feel that everyone, including science
majors, should have a 'broader background in the social sciences and hu
manities as a preparation for the problems of modern living. The individual
needs to obtain some grasp of the social problems with which he will .be
dealing after he graduates from college. He, as a college graduate, should
as.-.ume certain responsibilities of leadership in the community if our
pre-ent system cl government is to function effectively. This responsibility
cannot be adequately fulfilled without a broad understanding of life."
Kim Firestone, '58, Alpha Delta Phi: "I feel that a student studying
in a fairly restricted field should lake a few studies outside this field to
bioaden himself culturally. However, I do not feel that these outside
studies should be required to the extent that ,the student committee pro
poses."
Jim Hood, 'SG, Village: "Fr®m my own experience in college I see 110 '
rea. on why the number of minimum required courses should be changed.
Every student should receive a certain number of courses outside his field
of t tudy. This tends to broaden his scope of education beyond that material
which lie pursues wiilhin his own limited, specialized major."
Doug Kyle, '57, Stern: "The current emphasis on graduate work for
many college-trained professions leaves more room in the first years to
work in courses that would not have been pos i'ble to have taken in a four
year course. Such fields as engineering and physics too often leave little
room for humanities courses, and, to a lesser exitent, humanities courses
el'ten encourage students to stay away from all- but the simplest or the
least complex of the lab courses. A (thorough introduction to as many fields
of knowledege as possible is, I think, indispensable for a complete educa
tion."
Greg Lawlor, '58, Delta Upsilon: "Yes, I do believe Stanford students
should be required to take a certain amount of unit; in these three fields.
Many times, by the present system, a lower division student is unable to
lake a desired class from some professor, say, who is only going to be here
for one or two quarters. Why? Because the student has certain require
ments to fulfill Within two years instead of in the four years now proposed.
And also, beside the fact that a student would be given added time to
think over those courses he will be required to take, he may discover an
intere:.t iri a certain required subject."
Marion Duncan, '59, Koltle: "Many students find their curricula pre
determined by their major. 1 feel, however, thait the program would be
advantageous to those who have no definite major or interest."
"Mary Schelke, '58, Lagunita: "Students shouldn't be required to take
34 units. There should be freshman requirements <in Civ and science, but j
none after that year. The lab science requirement should be kept. You
shouldn't have to fini.h the language requirement in the first six quarters. 1
You should be able to finish it whenever it's convenient." . »

Helen Henris, '59, Ruble: "No doubt the undergraduate students would
gain a more general background from the proposed program. I believe,
however, thait the program should be recommended rather than required.
College students should be allowed the freedom to choose their own
courses."
Steve Atkins, '5(5, Stem: "I believe that the proposal to exten 1 the
liberal arts requirements would be of great benefit to all those students
desiring a well-rounded education, but would irnpo e an additional handi
cap on those planning to major in engineering or the other basic sciences
which already require many technical courses irrespective of the courses
required in the scientific field."
Don Leach, '57, off-campus: "I rhink that by ithe time a student gi'ts
) to the college level, he is mature enough to decide what studies he should
j take outside hi -i major. I 'think the quantity of these :■ Lu.'ies should be left
I up to the s/tuderot and his advisor. It seems to me that a general require
j inert like the one proposed v/ould be a blow to the principals of choice
here at the University."
Joan Wessel. '59, Rohlc: ''In the fields of humanitie; and social sciences,
yes; in lab sciences, no. 3y studying humanities, students acquire an ap
preciation cf the beautiful and great things done by man. The entire social
science program is connected with man and his accompli:hments. If we
don't know where man has succeedcd or failed in the past, how can we
hope to judge the future? I 'think a year ol a lab science should satisfy
the requirements if a student (ha; bar I one or more science courses in high
school. If one is net entering the field of science, the extra college course,
although probably mor? difficult, would simply be a repetition of the
science studied in high school."
Ray Griswold, '58, Stern: "Since Stanford is a liberal arts school I
think certain coutv.es should be required oif t'he student lor two reasons:
Ons, it helps him to choose his major if 'he is not certain; and two, if a
student wants a specialized education, he should go to a place such as
Cal Tech."
Peter '58, Stern: "I feel that the student should take a
| certain amount of unit, in c..th broad field. A person should know some
■ll ilng about fields other than his own particular major."
Sandra Bull, '59, Rraruier: "The amount of fine spent in a science lab
' i •: secondary to the method ( rnployerl while working there. If classes could
j be reduced in size and more individual explanation could be offered, a
; marked improvement will, I feel, be in evidence."
Joanne Cut'dihy, '57, iiranncr sponsor: "In this world right now. to
j really develop your interests and (talents completely, it is necessary to have
; a smattering of <?dueation in all these field.s. If you are curious, and there
j fore subject to. education, you would want to know about them anyway.
By branching into other field.-:, you can find things which relate to your

own interests and which would therefore help to develop them. However,
it's the word 'require' that bothers me."
Liz Whepley, '59, Branner: "Humanities and political science will
broaden the student's interest and give him a better background in choos
ing his major. The presently existing requirements of Civ and English
should definitely be continued; for if put on an elective basis, they would
prove not very popular. The lower division classification should bo con
tinued and not combined with the upper division. If this is done students
will have a tendency to leave the less desirable subjects to their last year
and the program's orientation purpose will be defeated."
Liz Wheelwright, '56, Russell: "Yes. Social sciences make up an im
portant part of a liberal arts program, which is the nucleus of the under
graduate system. A social science requirement also leads students who are
looking for a major into fields to which they might otherwise fail to be
exposed."
Caroline Card, '59, Roble: "No, I don't think students should have to
pend time in studying things which aren't ab olutely neces ary for get
ting a job. Whether or not they study other subjects should be left up to
individual students."
Walter G. Stray, '56, Crothers Memorial: "As far as I can see, the only
difference between the proposed science requirement and the present one
is that the proposed one eliminates the 'loopholes' for the people who wish
to avoid lab sciences. This may be a good thing if one thinks that lab science
is necessary for a so-called well rounded education. However, I feel that
a person who has no interest in nor any aptitude for lab sciences should
not be required to take lab science courses when he could probably benefit
more from some of the courses that would be eliminated."
Mary Curtis, '58, Lagunita: "I feel that this program is a very good
idea and that every student should be required to study in all three of
these fields. An important part of a college education is to stimulate the
student's interest and to further some understanding in other fields beside
his chosen one. The combination of these requirements with the four-year
program will enable the student to obtain a good all-around education
with more ease and a better understanding of all the fields.''
Julie Work, '59, Branner: "I don't think it's a good idea because most
students would like to concentrate on their major field and less on fulfilling
requirements they are not interested in. I think the system of lower divi
sion requirements we have now is sufficient."
Neil MacPhail, '57, Toyon: "I heartily agree. I think that the rigid
requirements of many of our majors give students a narrower outlook
on and understanding of the world's problems and complications than it
is possible for them to get at Stanford. I think that we are more involved
today with problems outside our majors than we have ever been."

Liz Whepley, '59, Branner: "Humanities and political science will
broaden the student's interest and give him a better background in choos
ing his major. The presently existing requirements of Civ and English
should definitely be continued; for if put on an elective basis, they would
prove not very popular. The lower division classification should bo con
tinued and not combined with the upper division. If this is done students
will have a tendency to leave the less desirable subjects to their last year
and the program's orientation purpose will be defeated."
Liz Wheelwright, '56, Russell: "Yes. Social sciences make up an im
portant part of a liberal arts program, which is the nucleus of the under
graduate system. A social science requirement also leads students who are
looking for a major into fields to which they might otherwise fail to be
exposed."
Caroline Card, '59, Roble: "No, I don't think students should have to
pend time in studying things which aren't ab olutely neces ary for get
ting a job. Whether or not they study other subjects should be left up to
individual students."
Walter G. Stray, '56, Crothers Memorial: "As far as I can see, the only
difference between the proposed science requirement and the present one
is that the proposed one eliminates the 'loopholes' for the people who wish
to avoid lab sciences. This may be a good thing if one thinks that lab science
is necessary for a so-called well rounded education. However, I feel that
a person who has no interest in nor any aptitude for lab sciences should
not be required to take lab science courses when he could probably benefit
more from some of the courses that would be eliminated."
Mary Curtis, '58, Lagunita: "I feel that this program is a very good
idea and that every student should be required to study in all three of
these fields. An important part of a college education is to stimulate the
student's interest and to further some understanding in other fields beside
his chosen one. The combination of these requirements with the four-year
program will enable the student to obtain a good all-around education
with more ease and a better understanding of all the fields.''
Julie Work, '59, Branner: "I don't think it's a good idea because most
students would like to concentrate on their major field and less on fulfilling
requirements they are not interested in. I think the system of lower divi
sion requirements we have now is sufficient."
Neil MacPhail, '57, Toyon: "I heartily agree. I think that the rigid
requirements of many of our majors give students a narrower outlook
on and understanding of the world's problems and complications than it
is possible for them to get at Stanford. I think that we are more involved
today with problems outside our majors than we have ever been."
What do you think?
Do you think Stanford undergraduates should be required to take
courses in humanities, social sciences and laboratory sciences?
The student committee for the Study of Undergraduate Education has
i.?commended that the Univer ity requirements in these fieids total
ing 34 ui.its. T.ni. is pai tof a 55-uni.t four-year requirement wirich includes
Yd units ol We-tern Civ and nine units of English.
Currently, 45 units are required for entrance into upper division. But
1;. t pi'ing quarter the Academic Council voted 'to discontinue upper and
lower divi.-ion distinctions and substitute one four-year undergraduate
j.i ogram.
The tuder.t committee has submitted its propo al.s to the Executive
Committee of the Study of Undergraduate Education for faculty and ad
ministrative deliberation.
The revamping of the humanities:, .• ocial science and Laboratory science
requirements was a major part of the student committee's program. In an
effort to get .student opinion, The Daily interviewed the following students
on the wisdom of requirements in these fields:
Tony Jones, '59, Wilbur: "I think it is a good idea. It is important to
take humanities and social sciences because in these courses you get n
broader view of 'the world. It's better to get a more liberal education and
not to get too technical. You get technical knowledge of, say, bacterial
warfare in biology lab, but it's better to get a broader view."
Barbara Gillespie, '58, Sterling: "I think this requirement h a good
i<ita for everybody, but especially for tiie science majors who often cram
their four years with nothing, but courses in t heir own field. I here's plenty
to ku:n in the Phyacs Department, but I believe that a good physicist
today must have some background in the humanities. Science is more and
mare -yrJ.hesizing with other phases of life, and to make wise decision; and
fuliy use his kn iwledge I think any liberal arts major should take science
courses, if only to learn how the world around him works. I beiieve this
requirement is a good innovation if there is a sufficiently wide range of
courses for ..tudents to choose fiom according to itheir intere.ts."
Dick lieyna, 's<i, Alpha Sigma Phi: "I don't think that 34 units is
enough, particularly for an engineering major. The School of Engineering
is one of the tightest in the University; it's merely a highly technical trade
school. From it you get very little education. As: an engineering major,
I wi: h I were required to take more."
Frelene Kovacs, '57, Union: "No, I donlt feel iab science should be
required. The entrance requirements to Stanford require two years of,
fcience. This is, 1 think, enough of an introduction to science. If the interest
is present, the student will take further cience courses anyway; if not, it
is a waste of time, money and effort to force undergraduates to take any
further courses."

Jim Morrison, '59, Wilbur: "I feel that everyone, including science
majors, should have a 'broader background in the social sciences and hu
manities as a preparation for the problems of modern living. The individual
needs to obtain some grasp of the social problems with which he will .be
dealing after he graduates from college. He, as a college graduate, should
as.-.ume certain responsibilities of leadership in the community if our
pre-ent system cl government is to function effectively. This responsibility
cannot be adequately fulfilled without a broad understanding of life."
Kim Firestone, '58, Alpha Delta Phi: "I feel that a student studying
in a fairly restricted field should lake a few studies outside this field to
bioaden himself culturally. However, I do not feel that these outside
studies should be required to the extent that ,the student committee pro
poses."
Jim Hood, 'SG, Village: "Fr®m my own experience in college I see 110 '
rea. on why the number of minimum required courses should be changed.
Every student should receive a certain number of courses outside his field
of t tudy. This tends to broaden his scope of education beyond that material
which lie pursues wiilhin his own limited, specialized major."
Doug Kyle, '57, Stern: "The current emphasis on graduate work for
many college-trained professions leaves more room in the first years to
work in courses that would not have been pos i'ble to have taken in a four
year course. Such fields as engineering and physics too often leave little
room for humanities courses, and, to a lesser exitent, humanities courses
el'ten encourage students to stay away from all- but the simplest or the
least complex of the lab courses. A (thorough introduction to as many fields
of knowledege as possible is, I think, indispensable for a complete educa
tion."
Greg Lawlor, '58, Delta Upsilon: "Yes, I do believe Stanford students
should be required to take a certain amount of unit; in these three fields.
Many times, by the present system, a lower division student is unable to
lake a desired class from some professor, say, who is only going to be here
for one or two quarters. Why? Because the student has certain require
ments to fulfill Within two years instead of in the four years now proposed.
And also, beside the fact that a student would be given added time to
think over those courses he will be required to take, he may discover an
intere:.t iri a certain required subject."
Marion Duncan, '59, Koltle: "Many students find their curricula pre
determined by their major. 1 feel, however, thait the program would be
advantageous to those who have no definite major or interest."
"Mary Schelke, '58, Lagunita: "Students shouldn't be required to take
34 units. There should be freshman requirements <in Civ and science, but j
none after that year. The lab science requirement should be kept. You
shouldn't have to fini.h the language requirement in the first six quarters. 1
You should be able to finish it whenever it's convenient." . »

Helen Henris, '59, Ruble: "No doubt the undergraduate students would
gain a more general background from the proposed program. I believe,
however, thait the program should be recommended rather than required.
College students should be allowed the freedom to choose their own
courses."
Steve Atkins, '5(5, Stem: "I believe that the proposal to exten 1 the
liberal arts requirements would be of great benefit to all those students
desiring a well-rounded education, but would irnpo e an additional handi
cap on those planning to major in engineering or the other basic sciences
which already require many technical courses irrespective of the courses
required in the scientific field."
Don Leach, '57, off-campus: "I rhink that by ithe time a student gi'ts
) to the college level, he is mature enough to decide what studies he should
j take outside hi -i major. I 'think the quantity of these :■ Lu.'ies should be left
I up to the s/tuderot and his advisor. It seems to me that a general require
j inert like the one proposed v/ould be a blow to the principals of choice
here at the University."
Joan Wessel. '59, Rohlc: ''In the fields of humanitie; and social sciences,
yes; in lab sciences, no. 3y studying humanities, students acquire an ap
preciation cf the beautiful and great things done by man. The entire social
science program is connected with man and his accompli:hments. If we
don't know where man has succeedcd or failed in the past, how can we
hope to judge the future? I 'think a year ol a lab science should satisfy
the requirements if a student (ha; bar I one or more science courses in high
school. If one is net entering the field of science, the extra college course,
although probably mor? difficult, would simply be a repetition of the
science studied in high school."
Ray Griswold, '58, Stern: "Since Stanford is a liberal arts school I
think certain coutv.es should be required oif t'he student lor two reasons:
Ons, it helps him to choose his major if 'he is not certain; and two, if a
student wants a specialized education, he should go to a place such as
Cal Tech."
Peter '58, Stern: "I feel that the student should take a
| certain amount of unit, in c..th broad field. A person should know some
■ll ilng about fields other than his own particular major."
Sandra Bull, '59, Rraruier: "The amount of fine spent in a science lab
' i •: secondary to the method ( rnployerl while working there. If classes could
j be reduced in size and more individual explanation could be offered, a
; marked improvement will, I feel, be in evidence."
Joanne Cut'dihy, '57, iiranncr sponsor: "In this world right now. to
j really develop your interests and (talents completely, it is necessary to have
; a smattering of <?dueation in all these field.s. If you are curious, and there

By branching into other field.-:, you can find things which relate to your

Don Leach, '57, off-campus: "I rhink that by ithe time a student gi'ts

Joan Wessel. '59, Rohlc: ''In the fields of humanitie; and social sciences,
yes; in lab sciences, no. 3y studying humanities, students acquire an ap

don't know where man has succeedcd or failed in the past, how can we
hope to judge the future? I 'think a year ol a lab science should satisfy
the requirements if a student (ha; bar I one or more science courses in high

science studied in high school."
Ray Griswold, '58, Stern: "Since Stanford is a liberal arts school I
think certain coutv.es should be required oif t'he student lor two reasons:

Cal Tech."
Peter '58, Stern: "I feel that the student should take a

Sandra Bull, '59, Rraruier: "The amount of fine spent in a science lab

By branching into other field.-:, you can find things which relate to your

own interests and which would therefore help to develop them. However,
it's the word 'require' that bothers me."
Liz Whepley, '59, Branner: "Humanities and political science will
broaden the student's interest and give him a better background in choos
ing his major. The presently existing requirements of Civ and English
should definitely be continued; for if put on an elective basis, they would
prove not very popular. The lower division classification should bo con
tinued and not combined with the upper division. If this is done students
will have a tendency to leave the less desirable subjects to their last year
and the program's orientation purpose will be defeated."
Liz Wheelwright, '56, Russell: "Yes. Social sciences make up an im
portant part of a liberal arts program, which is the nucleus of the under
graduate system. A social science requirement also leads students who are
looking for a major into fields to which they might otherwise fail to be
exposed."
Caroline Card, '59, Roble: "No, I don't think students should have to

individual students."
Walter G. Stray, '56, Crothers Memorial: "As far as I can see, the only
difference between the proposed science requirement and the present one
is that the proposed one eliminates the 'loopholes' for the people who wish
to avoid lab sciences. This may be a good thing if one thinks that lab science
is necessary for a so-called well rounded education. However, I feel that
a person who has no interest in nor any aptitude for lab sciences should
not be required to take lab science courses when he could probably benefit
more from some of the courses that would be eliminated."
Mary Curtis, '58, Lagunita: "I feel that this program is a very good
idea and that every student should be required to study in all three of
these fields. An important part of a college education is to stimulate the
student's interest and to further some understanding in other fields beside
his chosen one. The combination of these requirements with the four-year
program will enable the student to obtain a good all-around education
with more ease and a better understanding of all the fields.''
Julie Work, '59, Branner: "I don't think it's a good idea because most
students would like to concentrate on their major field and less on fulfilling
requirements they are not interested in. I think the system of lower divi
sion requirements we have now is sufficient."
Neil MacPhail, '57, Toyon: "I heartily agree. I think that the rigid
requirements of many of our majors give students a narrower outlook
on and understanding of the world's problems and complications than it
is possible for them to get at Stanford. I think that we are more involved
today with problems outside our majors than we have ever been."
What do you think?
Do you think Stanford undergraduates should be required to take
courses in humanities, social sciences and laboratory sciences?
The student committee for the Study of Undergraduate Education has
i.?commended that the Univer ity requirements in these fieids total
ing 34 ui.its. T.ni. is pai tof a 55-uni.t four-year requirement wirich includes
Yd units ol We-tern Civ and nine units of English.
Currently, 45 units are required for entrance into upper division. But
1;. t pi'ing quarter the Academic Council voted 'to discontinue upper and
lower divi.-ion distinctions and substitute one four-year undergraduate
j.i ogram.
The tuder.t committee has submitted its propo al.s to the Executive
Committee of the Study of Undergraduate Education for faculty and ad
ministrative deliberation.
The revamping of the humanities:, .• ocial science and Laboratory science
requirements was a major part of the student committee's program. In an
effort to get .student opinion, The Daily interviewed the following students
on the wisdom of requirements in these fields:
Tony Jones, '59, Wilbur: "I think it is a good idea. It is important to
take humanities and social sciences because in these courses you get n
broader view of 'the world. It's better to get a more liberal education and
not to get too technical. You get technical knowledge of, say, bacterial
warfare in biology lab, but it's better to get a broader view."
Barbara Gillespie, '58, Sterling: "I think this requirement h a good
i<ita for everybody, but especially for tiie science majors who often cram
their four years with nothing, but courses in t heir own field. I here's plenty
to ku:n in the Phyacs Department, but I believe that a good physicist
today must have some background in the humanities. Science is more and
mare -yrJ.hesizing with other phases of life, and to make wise decision; and
fuliy use his kn iwledge I think any liberal arts major should take science
courses, if only to learn how the world around him works. I beiieve this
requirement is a good innovation if there is a sufficiently wide range of
courses for ..tudents to choose fiom according to itheir intere.ts."
Dick lieyna, 's<i, Alpha Sigma Phi: "I don't think that 34 units is
enough, particularly for an engineering major. The School of Engineering
is one of the tightest in the University; it's merely a highly technical trade
school. From it you get very little education. As: an engineering major,
I wi: h I were required to take more."
Frelene Kovacs, '57, Union: "No, I donlt feel iab science should be
required. The entrance requirements to Stanford require two years of,
fcience. This is, 1 think, enough of an introduction to science. If the interest
is present, the student will take further cience courses anyway; if not, it
is a waste of time, money and effort to force undergraduates to take any
further courses."

Jim Morrison, '59, Wilbur: "I feel that everyone, including science
majors, should have a 'broader background in the social sciences and hu
manities as a preparation for the problems of modern living. The individual
needs to obtain some grasp of the social problems with which he will .be
dealing after he graduates from college. He, as a college graduate, should
as.-.ume certain responsibilities of leadership in the community if our
pre-ent system cl government is to function effectively. This responsibility
cannot be adequately fulfilled without a broad understanding of life."
Kim Firestone, '58, Alpha Delta Phi: "I feel that a student studying
in a fairly restricted field should lake a few studies outside this field to
bioaden himself culturally. However, I do not feel that these outside
studies should be required to the extent that ,the student committee pro
poses."
Jim Hood, 'SG, Village: "Fr®m my own experience in college I see 110 '
rea. on why the number of minimum required courses should be changed.
Every student should receive a certain number of courses outside his field
of t tudy. This tends to broaden his scope of education beyond that material
which lie pursues wiilhin his own limited, specialized major."
Doug Kyle, '57, Stern: "The current emphasis on graduate work for
many college-trained professions leaves more room in the first years to
work in courses that would not have been pos i'ble to have taken in a four
year course. Such fields as engineering and physics too often leave little
room for humanities courses, and, to a lesser exitent, humanities courses
el'ten encourage students to stay away from all- but the simplest or the
least complex of the lab courses. A (thorough introduction to as many fields
of knowledege as possible is, I think, indispensable for a complete educa
tion."
Greg Lawlor, '58, Delta Upsilon: "Yes, I do believe Stanford students
should be required to take a certain amount of unit; in these three fields.
Many times, by the present system, a lower division student is unable to
lake a desired class from some professor, say, who is only going to be here
for one or two quarters. Why? Because the student has certain require
ments to fulfill Within two years instead of in the four years now proposed.
And also, beside the fact that a student would be given added time to
think over those courses he will be required to take, he may discover an
intere:.t iri a certain required subject."
Marion Duncan, '59, Koltle: "Many students find their curricula pre
determined by their major. 1 feel, however, thait the program would be
advantageous to those who have no definite major or interest."
"Mary Schelke, '58, Lagunita: "Students shouldn't be required to take
34 units. There should be freshman requirements <in Civ and science, but j
none after that year. The lab science requirement should be kept. You
shouldn't have to fini.h the language requirement in the first six quarters. 1
You should be able to finish it whenever it's convenient." . »

Helen Henris, '59, Ruble: "No doubt the undergraduate students would
gain a more general background from the proposed program. I believe,
however, thait the program should be recommended rather than required.
College students should be allowed the freedom to choose their own
courses."
Steve Atkins, '5(5, Stem: "I believe that the proposal to exten 1 the
liberal arts requirements would be of great benefit to all those students
desiring a well-rounded education, but would irnpo e an additional handi

studies should be required to the extent that ,the student committee pro

Jim Hood, 'SG, Village: "Fr®m my own experience in college I see 110 '
rea. on why the number of minimum required courses should be changed.
Every student should receive a certain number of courses outside his field
of t tudy. This tends to broaden his scope of education beyond that material
which lie pursues wiilhin his own limited, specialized major."
Doug Kyle, '57, Stern: "The current emphasis on graduate work for
many college-trained professions leaves more room in the first years to
work in courses that would not have been pos i'ble to have taken in a four
year course. Such fields as engineering and physics too often leave little
room for humanities courses, and, to a lesser exitent, humanities courses
el'ten encourage students to stay away from all- but the simplest or the
least complex of the lab courses. A (thorough introduction to as many fields
of knowledege as possible is, I think, indispensable for a complete educa
tion."
Greg Lawlor, '58, Delta Upsilon: "Yes, I do believe Stanford students
should be required to take a certain amount of unit; in these three fields.
Many times, by the present system, a lower division student is unable to
lake a desired class from some professor, say, who is only going to be here
for one or two quarters. Why? Because the student has certain require
ments to fulfill Within two years instead of in the four years now proposed.
And also, beside the fact that a student would be given added time to
think over those courses he will be required to take, he may discover an
intere:.t iri a certain required subject."
Marion Duncan, '59, Koltle: "Many students find their curricula pre
determined by their major. 1 feel, however, thait the program would be
advantageous to those who have no definite major or interest."
"Mary Schelke, '58, Lagunita: "Students shouldn't be required to take
34 units. There should be freshman requirements <in Civ and science, but j
none after that year. The lab science requirement should be kept. You
shouldn't have to fini.h the language requirement in the first six quarters. 1
You should be able to finish it whenever it's convenient." . »

Helen Henris, '59, Ruble: "No doubt the undergraduate students would
gain a more general background from the proposed program. I believe,
however, thait the program should be recommended rather than required.
College students should be allowed the freedom to choose their own
courses."
Steve Atkins, '5(5, Stem: "I believe that the proposal to exten 1 the
liberal arts requirements would be of great benefit to all those students
desiring a well-rounded education, but would irnpo e an additional handi
cap on those planning to major in engineering or the other basic sciences
which already require many technical courses irrespective of the courses
required in the scientific field."
Don Leach, '57, off-campus: "I rhink that by ithe time a student gi'ts

Joan Wessel. '59, Rohlc: ''In the fields of humanitie; and social sciences,

don't know where man has succeedcd or failed in the past, how can we
hope to judge the future? I 'think a year ol a lab science should satisfy
the requirements if a student (ha; bar I one or more science courses in high

Ray Griswold, '58, Stern: "Since Stanford is a liberal arts school I

it's the word 'require' that bothers me."
Liz Whepley, '59, Branner: "Humanities and political science will
broaden the student's interest and give him a better background in choos

will have a tendency to leave the less desirable subjects to their last year
and the program's orientation purpose will be defeated."
Liz Wheelwright, '56, Russell: "Yes. Social sciences make up an im

looking for a major into fields to which they might otherwise fail to be

Caroline Card, '59, Roble: "No, I don't think students should have to

Walter G. Stray, '56, Crothers Memorial: "As far as I can see, the only
difference between the proposed science requirement and the present one
is that the proposed one eliminates the 'loopholes' for the people who wish

is necessary for a so-called well rounded education. However, I feel that
a person who has no interest in nor any aptitude for lab sciences should

Mary Curtis, '58, Lagunita: "I feel that this program is a very good

his chosen one. The combination of these requirements with the four-year
program will enable the student to obtain a good all-around education
with more ease and a better understanding of all the fields.''
Julie Work, '59, Branner: "I don't think it's a good idea because most
students would like to concentrate on their major field and less on fulfilling
requirements they are not interested in. I think the system of lower divi
sion requirements we have now is sufficient."
Neil MacPhail, '57, Toyon: "I heartily agree. I think that the rigid
requirements of many of our majors give students a narrower outlook
on and understanding of the world's problems and complications than it
is possible for them to get at Stanford. I think that we are more involved
today with problems outside our majors than we have ever been."
What do you think?
Do you think Stanford undergraduates should be required to take
courses in humanities, social sciences and laboratory sciences?
The student committee for the Study of Undergraduate Education has
i.?commended that the Univer ity requirements in these fieids total
ing 34 ui.its. T.ni. is pai tof a 55-uni.t four-year requirement wirich includes
Yd units ol We-tern Civ and nine units of English.
Currently, 45 units are required for entrance into upper division. But
1;. t pi'ing quarter the Academic Council voted 'to discontinue upper and
lower divi.-ion distinctions and substitute one four-year undergraduate
j.i ogram.
The tuder.t committee has submitted its propo al.s to the Executive
Committee of the Study of Undergraduate Education for faculty and ad
ministrative deliberation.
The revamping of the humanities:, .• ocial science and Laboratory science
requirements was a major part of the student committee's program. In an
effort to get .student opinion, The Daily interviewed the following students
on the wisdom of requirements in these fields:
Tony Jones, '59, Wilbur: "I think it is a good idea. It is important to
take humanities and social sciences because in these courses you get n
broader view of 'the world. It's better to get a more liberal education and
not to get too technical. You get technical knowledge of, say, bacterial
warfare in biology lab, but it's better to get a broader view."
Barbara Gillespie, '58, Sterling: "I think this requirement h a good
i<ita for everybody, but especially for tiie science majors who often cram
their four years with nothing, but courses in t heir own field. I here's plenty
to ku:n in the Phyacs Department, but I believe that a good physicist
today must have some background in the humanities. Science is more and
mare -yrJ.hesizing with other phases of life, and to make wise decision; and
fuliy use his kn iwledge I think any liberal arts major should take science
courses, if only to learn how the world around him works. I beiieve this
requirement is a good innovation if there is a sufficiently wide range of
courses for ..tudents to choose fiom according to itheir intere.ts."
Dick lieyna, 's<i, Alpha Sigma Phi: "I don't think that 34 units is
enough, particularly for an engineering major. The School of Engineering
is one of the tightest in the University; it's merely a highly technical trade
school. From it you get very little education. As: an engineering major,
I wi: h I were required to take more."
Frelene Kovacs, '57, Union: "No, I donlt feel iab science should be
required. The entrance requirements to Stanford require two years of,
fcience. This is, 1 think, enough of an introduction to science. If the interest
is present, the student will take further cience courses anyway; if not, it
is a waste of time, money and effort to force undergraduates to take any
further courses."

Jim Morrison, '59, Wilbur: "I feel that everyone, including science
majors, should have a 'broader background in the social sciences and hu
manities as a preparation for the problems of modern living. The individual
needs to obtain some grasp of the social problems with which he will .be
dealing after he graduates from college. He, as a college graduate, should
as.-.ume certain responsibilities of leadership in the community if our
pre-ent system cl government is to function effectively. This responsibility
cannot be adequately fulfilled without a broad understanding of life."
Kim Firestone, '58, Alpha Delta Phi: "I feel that a student studying

effort to get .student opinion, The Daily interviewed the following students
on the wisdom of requirements in these fields:
Tony Jones, '59, Wilbur: "I think it is a good idea. It is important to
take humanities and social sciences because in these courses you get n
broader view of 'the world. It's better to get a more liberal education and
not to get too technical. You get technical knowledge of, say, bacterial
warfare in biology lab, but it's better to get a broader view."
Barbara Gillespie, '58, Sterling: "I think this requirement h a good
i<ita for everybody, but especially for tiie science majors who often cram
their four years with nothing, but courses in t heir own field. I here's plenty
to ku:n in the Phyacs Department, but I believe that a good physicist
today must have some background in the humanities. Science is more and
mare -yrJ.hesizing with other phases of life, and to make wise decision; and
fuliy use his kn iwledge I think any liberal arts major should take science
courses, if only to learn how the world around him works. I beiieve this
requirement is a good innovation if there is a sufficiently wide range of
courses for ..tudents to choose fiom according to itheir intere.ts."
Dick lieyna, 's<i, Alpha Sigma Phi: "I don't think that 34 units is
enough, particularly for an engineering major. The School of Engineering
is one of the tightest in the University; it's merely a highly technical trade
school. From it you get very little education. As: an engineering major,
I wi: h I were required to take more."
Frelene Kovacs, '57, Union: "No, I donlt feel iab science should be
required. The entrance requirements to Stanford require two years of,
fcience. This is, 1 think, enough of an introduction to science. If the interest
is present, the student will take further cience courses anyway; if not, it
is a waste of time, money and effort to force undergraduates to take any
further courses."

Jim Morrison, '59, Wilbur: "I feel that everyone, including science
majors, should have a 'broader background in the social sciences and hu
manities as a preparation for the problems of modern living. The individual
needs to obtain some grasp of the social problems with which he will .be
dealing after he graduates from college. He, as a college graduate, should
as.-.ume certain responsibilities of leadership in the community if our
pre-ent system cl government is to function effectively. This responsibility
cannot be adequately fulfilled without a broad understanding of life."
Kim Firestone, '58, Alpha Delta Phi: "I feel that a student studying
in a fairly restricted field should lake a few studies outside this field to
bioaden himself culturally. However, I do not feel that these outside
studies should be required to the extent that ,the student committee pro
poses."
Jim Hood, 'SG, Village: "Fr®m my own experience in college I see 110 '
rea. on why the number of minimum required courses should be changed.
Every student should receive a certain number of courses outside his field
of t tudy. This tends to broaden his scope of education beyond that material
which lie pursues wiilhin his own limited, specialized major."
Doug Kyle, '57, Stern: "The current emphasis on graduate work for
many college-trained professions leaves more room in the first years to
work in courses that would not have been pos i'ble to have taken in a four
year course. Such fields as engineering and physics too often leave little
room for humanities courses, and, to a lesser exitent, humanities courses
el'ten encourage students to stay away from all- but the simplest or the
least complex of the lab courses. A (thorough introduction to as many fields
of knowledege as possible is, I think, indispensable for a complete educa
tion."
Greg Lawlor, '58, Delta Upsilon: "Yes, I do believe Stanford students
should be required to take a certain amount of unit; in these three fields.
Many times, by the present system, a lower division student is unable to
lake a desired class from some professor, say, who is only going to be here
for one or two quarters. Why? Because the student has certain require
ments to fulfill Within two years instead of in the four years now proposed.
And also, beside the fact that a student would be given added time to
think over those courses he will be required to take, he may discover an
intere:.t iri a certain required subject."
Marion Duncan, '59, Koltle: "Many students find their curricula pre
determined by their major. 1 feel, however, thait the program would be
advantageous to those who have no definite major or interest."
"Mary Schelke, '58, Lagunita: "Students shouldn't be required to take
34 units. There should be freshman requirements <in Civ and science, but j
none after that year. The lab science requirement should be kept. You
shouldn't have to fini.h the language requirement in the first six quarters. 1
You should be able to finish it whenever it's convenient." . »

Helen Henris, '59, Ruble: "No doubt the undergraduate students would
gain a more general background from the proposed program. I believe,
however, thait the program should be recommended rather than required.
College students should be allowed the freedom to choose their own
courses."
Steve Atkins, '5(5, Stem: "I believe that the proposal to exten 1 the
liberal arts requirements would be of great benefit to all those students
desiring a well-rounded education, but would irnpo e an additional handi
cap on those planning to major in engineering or the other basic sciences
which already require many technical courses irrespective of the courses
required in the scientific field."
Don Leach, '57, off-campus: "I rhink that by ithe time a student gi'ts
) to the college level, he is mature enough to decide what studies he should
j take outside hi -i major. I 'think the quantity of these :■ Lu.'ies should be left
I up to the s/tuderot and his advisor. It seems to me that a general require
j inert like the one proposed v/ould be a blow to the principals of choice
here at the University."
Joan Wessel. '59, Rohlc: ''In the fields of humanitie; and social sciences,
yes; in lab sciences, no. 3y studying humanities, students acquire an ap
preciation cf the beautiful and great things done by man. The entire social
science program is connected with man and his accompli:hments. If we
don't know where man has succeedcd or failed in the past, how can we
hope to judge the future? I 'think a year ol a lab science should satisfy
the requirements if a student (ha; bar I one or more science courses in high
school. If one is net entering the field of science, the extra college course,
although probably mor? difficult, would simply be a repetition of the
science studied in high school."
Ray Griswold, '58, Stern: "Since Stanford is a liberal arts school I
think certain coutv.es should be required oif t'he student lor two reasons:
Ons, it helps him to choose his major if 'he is not certain; and two, if a
student wants a specialized education, he should go to a place such as
Cal Tech."
Peter '58, Stern: "I feel that the student should take a
| certain amount of unit, in c..th broad field. A person should know some
■ll ilng about fields other than his own particular major."
Sandra Bull, '59, Rraruier: "The amount of fine spent in a science lab
' i •: secondary to the method ( rnployerl while working there. If classes could
j be reduced in size and more individual explanation could be offered, a
; marked improvement will, I feel, be in evidence."
Joanne Cut'dihy, '57, iiranncr sponsor: "In this world right now. to
j really develop your interests and (talents completely, it is necessary to have
; a smattering of <?dueation in all these field.s. If you are curious, and there
j fore subject to. education, you would want to know about them anyway.
By branching into other field.-:, you can find things which relate to your

own interests and which would therefore help to develop them. However,
it's the word 'require' that bothers me."
Liz Whepley, '59, Branner: "Humanities and political science will
broaden the student's interest and give him a better background in choos
ing his major. The presently existing requirements of Civ and English
should definitely be continued; for if put on an elective basis, they would
prove not very popular. The lower division classification should bo con
tinued and not combined with the upper division. If this is done students
will have a tendency to leave the less desirable subjects to their last year
and the program's orientation purpose will be defeated."
Liz Wheelwright, '56, Russell: "Yes. Social sciences make up an im
portant part of a liberal arts program, which is the nucleus of the under
graduate system. A social science requirement also leads students who are
looking for a major into fields to which they might otherwise fail to be
exposed."
Caroline Card, '59, Roble: "No, I don't think students should have to
pend time in studying things which aren't ab olutely neces ary for get
ting a job. Whether or not they study other subjects should be left up to
individual students."
Walter G. Stray, '56, Crothers Memorial: "As far as I can see, the only
difference between the proposed science requirement and the present one
is that the proposed one eliminates the 'loopholes' for the people who wish
to avoid lab sciences. This may be a good thing if one thinks that lab science
is necessary for a so-called well rounded education. However, I feel that
a person who has no interest in nor any aptitude for lab sciences should
not be required to take lab science courses when he could probably benefit
more from some of the courses that would be eliminated."
Mary Curtis, '58, Lagunita: "I feel that this program is a very good
idea and that every student should be required to study in all three of
these fields. An important part of a college education is to stimulate the
student's interest and to further some understanding in other fields beside
his chosen one. The combination of these requirements with the four-year
program will enable the student to obtain a good all-around education
with more ease and a better understanding of all the fields.''
Julie Work, '59, Branner: "I don't think it's a good idea because most
students would like to concentrate on their major field and less on fulfilling
requirements they are not interested in. I think the system of lower divi
sion requirements we have now is sufficient."
Neil MacPhail, '57, Toyon: "I heartily agree. I think that the rigid
requirements of many of our majors give students a narrower outlook
on and understanding of the world's problems and complications than it
is possible for them to get at Stanford. I think that we are more involved
today with problems outside our majors than we have ever been."
What do you think?
Do you think Stanford undergraduates should be required to take
courses in humanities, social sciences and laboratory sciences?
The student committee for the Study of Undergraduate Education has
i.?commended that the Univer ity requirements in these fieids total
ing 34 ui.its. T.ni. is pai tof a 55-uni.t four-year requirement wirich includes
Yd units ol We-tern Civ and nine units of English.
Currently, 45 units are required for entrance into upper division. But
1;. t pi'ing quarter the Academic Council voted 'to discontinue upper and
lower divi.-ion distinctions and substitute one four-year undergraduate
j.i ogram.
The tuder.t committee has submitted its propo al.s to the Executive
Committee of the Study of Undergraduate Education for faculty and ad
ministrative deliberation.

pend time in studying things which aren't ab olutely neces ary for get
ting a job. Whether or not they study other subjects should be left up to
individual students."
Walter G. Stray, '56, Crothers Memorial: "As far as I can see, the only
difference between the proposed science requirement and the present one
is that the proposed one eliminates the 'loopholes' for the people who wish
to avoid lab sciences. This may be a good thing if one thinks that lab science
is necessary for a so-called well rounded education. However, I feel that
a person who has no interest in nor any aptitude for lab sciences should
not be required to take lab science courses when he could probably benefit
more from some of the courses that would be eliminated."
Mary Curtis, '58, Lagunita: "I feel that this program is a very good
idea and that every student should be required to study in all three of
these fields. An important part of a college education is to stimulate the
student's interest and to further some understanding in other fields beside
his chosen one. The combination of these requirements with the four-year
program will enable the student to obtain a good all-around education
with more ease and a better understanding of all the fields.''
Julie Work, '59, Branner: "I don't think it's a good idea because most
students would like to concentrate on their major field and less on fulfilling
requirements they are not interested in. I think the system of lower divi
sion requirements we have now is sufficient."
Neil MacPhail, '57, Toyon: "I heartily agree. I think that the rigid
requirements of many of our majors give students a narrower outlook
on and understanding of the world's problems and complications than it
is possible for them to get at Stanford. I think that we are more involved
today with problems outside our majors than we have ever been."
What do you think?
Do you think Stanford undergraduates should be required to take
courses in humanities, social sciences and laboratory sciences?
The student committee for the Study of Undergraduate Education has
i.?commended that the Univer ity requirements in these fieids total
ing 34 ui.its. T.ni. is pai tof a 55-uni.t four-year requirement wirich includes
Yd units ol We-tern Civ and nine units of English.
Currently, 45 units are required for entrance into upper division. But
1;. t pi'ing quarter the Academic Council voted 'to discontinue upper and
lower divi.-ion distinctions and substitute one four-year undergraduate
j.i ogram.
The tuder.t committee has submitted its propo al.s to the Executive
Committee of the Study of Undergraduate Education for faculty and ad
ministrative deliberation.
The revamping of the humanities:, .• ocial science and Laboratory science
requirements was a major part of the student committee's program. In an
effort to get .student opinion, The Daily interviewed the following students
on the wisdom of requirements in these fields:
Tony Jones, '59, Wilbur: "I think it is a good idea. It is important to
take humanities and social sciences because in these courses you get n
broader view of 'the world. It's better to get a more liberal education and
not to get too technical. You get technical knowledge of, say, bacterial
warfare in biology lab, but it's better to get a broader view."
Barbara Gillespie, '58, Sterling: "I think this requirement h a good
i<ita for everybody, but especially for tiie science majors who often cram
their four years with nothing, but courses in t heir own field. I here's plenty
to ku:n in the Phyacs Department, but I believe that a good physicist
today must have some background in the humanities. Science is more and
mare -yrJ.hesizing with other phases of life, and to make wise decision; and
fuliy use his kn iwledge I think any liberal arts major should take science
courses, if only to learn how the world around him works. I beiieve this
requirement is a good innovation if there is a sufficiently wide range of
courses for ..tudents to choose fiom according to itheir intere.ts."
Dick lieyna, 's<i, Alpha Sigma Phi: "I don't think that 34 units is
enough, particularly for an engineering major. The School of Engineering
is one of the tightest in the University; it's merely a highly technical trade
school. From it you get very little education. As: an engineering major,
I wi: h I were required to take more."
Frelene Kovacs, '57, Union: "No, I donlt feel iab science should be
required. The entrance requirements to Stanford require two years of,
fcience. This is, 1 think, enough of an introduction to science. If the interest
is present, the student will take further cience courses anyway; if not, it
is a waste of time, money and effort to force undergraduates to take any
further courses."

Jim Morrison, '59, Wilbur: "I feel that everyone, including science
majors, should have a 'broader background in the social sciences and hu
manities as a preparation for the problems of modern living. The individual
needs to obtain some grasp of the social problems with which he will .be
dealing after he graduates from college. He, as a college graduate, should
as.-.ume certain responsibilities of leadership in the community if our
pre-ent system cl government is to function effectively. This responsibility
cannot be adequately fulfilled without a broad understanding of life."
Kim Firestone, '58, Alpha Delta Phi: "I feel that a student studying
in a fairly restricted field should lake a few studies outside this field to
bioaden himself culturally. However, I do not feel that these outside
studies should be required to the extent that ,the student committee pro
poses."
Jim Hood, 'SG, Village: "Fr®m my own experience in college I see 110 '
rea. on why the number of minimum required courses should be changed.
Every student should receive a certain number of courses outside his field
of t tudy. This tends to broaden his scope of education beyond that material
which lie pursues wiilhin his own limited, specialized major."
Doug Kyle, '57, Stern: "The current emphasis on graduate work for
many college-trained professions leaves more room in the first years to
work in courses that would not have been pos i'ble to have taken in a four
year course. Such fields as engineering and physics too often leave little
room for humanities courses, and, to a lesser exitent, humanities courses
el'ten encourage students to stay away from all- but the simplest or the
least complex of the lab courses. A (thorough introduction to as many fields
of knowledege as possible is, I think, indispensable for a complete educa
tion."
Greg Lawlor, '58, Delta Upsilon: "Yes, I do believe Stanford students
should be required to take a certain amount of unit; in these three fields.
Many times, by the present system, a lower division student is unable to
lake a desired class from some professor, say, who is only going to be here
for one or two quarters. Why? Because the student has certain require
ments to fulfill Within two years instead of in the four years now proposed.
And also, beside the fact that a student would be given added time to
think over those courses he will be required to take, he may discover an
intere:.t iri a certain required subject."
Marion Duncan, '59, Koltle: "Many students find their curricula pre
determined by their major. 1 feel, however, thait the program would be
advantageous to those who have no definite major or interest."
"Mary Schelke, '58, Lagunita: "Students shouldn't be required to take
34 units. There should be freshman requirements <in Civ and science, but j
none after that year. The lab science requirement should be kept. You
shouldn't have to fini.h the language requirement in the first six quarters. 1
You should be able to finish it whenever it's convenient." . »

Helen Henris, '59, Ruble: "No doubt the undergraduate students would
gain a more general background from the proposed program. I believe,
however, thait the program should be recommended rather than required.
College students should be allowed the freedom to choose their own
courses."
Steve Atkins, '5(5, Stem: "I believe that the proposal to exten 1 the
liberal arts requirements would be of great benefit to all those students
desiring a well-rounded education, but would irnpo e an additional handi
cap on those planning to major in engineering or the other basic sciences
which already require many technical courses irrespective of the courses
required in the scientific field."
Don Leach, '57, off-campus: "I rhink that by ithe time a student gi'ts
) to the college level, he is mature enough to decide what studies he should
j take outside hi -i major. I 'think the quantity of these :■ Lu.'ies should be left
I up to the s/tuderot and his advisor. It seems to me that a general require
j inert like the one proposed v/ould be a blow to the principals of choice
here at the University."
Joan Wessel. '59, Rohlc: ''In the fields of humanitie; and social sciences,
yes; in lab sciences, no. 3y studying humanities, students acquire an ap
preciation cf the beautiful and great things done by man. The entire social
science program is connected with man and his accompli:hments. If we
don't know where man has succeedcd or failed in the past, how can we
hope to judge the future? I 'think a year ol a lab science should satisfy
the requirements if a student (ha; bar I one or more science courses in high
school. If one is net entering the field of science, the extra college course,
although probably mor? difficult, would simply be a repetition of the
science studied in high school."
Ray Griswold, '58, Stern: "Since Stanford is a liberal arts school I
think certain coutv.es should be required oif t'he student lor two reasons:
Ons, it helps him to choose his major if 'he is not certain; and two, if a
student wants a specialized education, he should go to a place such as
Cal Tech."
Peter '58, Stern: "I feel that the student should take a
| certain amount of unit, in c..th broad field. A person should know some
■ll ilng about fields other than his own particular major."
Sandra Bull, '59, Rraruier: "The amount of fine spent in a science lab
' i •: secondary to the method ( rnployerl while working there. If classes could
j be reduced in size and more individual explanation could be offered, a
; marked improvement will, I feel, be in evidence."
Joanne Cut'dihy, '57, iiranncr sponsor: "In this world right now. to
j really develop your interests and (talents completely, it is necessary to have
; a smattering of <?dueation in all these field.s. If you are curious, and there
j fore subject to. education, you would want to know about them anyway.
By branching into other field.-:, you can find things which relate to your

own interests and which would therefore help to develop them. However,
it's the word 'require' that bothers me."
Liz Whepley, '59, Branner: "Humanities and political science will
broaden the student's interest and give him a better background in choos
ing his major. The presently existing requirements of Civ and English
should definitely be continued; for if put on an elective basis, they would
prove not very popular. The lower division classification should bo con
tinued and not combined with the upper division. If this is done students
will have a tendency to leave the less desirable subjects to their last year
and the program's orientation purpose will be defeated."
Liz Wheelwright, '56, Russell: "Yes. Social sciences make up an im
portant part of a liberal arts program, which is the nucleus of the under
graduate system. A social science requirement also leads students who are
looking for a major into fields to which they might otherwise fail to be
exposed."
Caroline Card, '59, Roble: "No, I don't think students should have to
pend time in studying things which aren't ab olutely neces ary for get
ting a job. Whether or not they study other subjects should be left up to
individual students."
Walter G. Stray, '56, Crothers Memorial: "As far as I can see, the only
