TcJay the first issue of Sequoia will hit the
stands.
After three years, Stanford again has a liter
ary magazine. Sequoia, in its 40 pages, brings
to the student body the stories, articles and
poems of some of its members.
Literary magazines have had a stormy and
intermittent career on campus. Nine previous
publications, under such varied titles as Stan
ford Literary Magazine, Carillon, Cardinal and
Sequoia, have come and gone. The most re
cent attempt was Viewpoint which ran for four
issues, from winter '52 to '53. A previous Se
quoia was relatively successful, running for
28 years in one form or another.
Financial difficulties have forced some of the
previous magazines out of existence. Sequoia
fortunately has sufficient funds to keep going
a while.
Editor Linda Lovelace and her staff have
worked since summer to create the foundations
for the magazine and prepare this first issue.
They showed great oplimism and determina
tion, undertaking a project which had been
begun and had failed several times. The cur
rent concern about boosting Stanford's intellec
tual atmosphere provided a strong impetus.
The English Department faculty gave h^elp

and encouragement. Sequoia adviser Wilfred
H. Stone and other men of the English faculty
formed a committee to review research articles
not written for any class which are submitted
to ihe magazine. Students may receive a unit
of "A" credit for research papers which the
committee deems worthy. This decision is in
dependent of Sequoia's acceptance or rejection
of the article for publication.
So today Stanford has a chance to see Se
quoia, another effort to provide a campus liter
ary publication. We do not expect a student
response equal to that which greets the Chap
pie. Yet editor Lovelace's prediction that the
700 copies will be sold, by noon may come true.
We do hope that the Stanford community
will show enough interest or, at the very least,
curiosity in the creative efforts of their fellow
students to support Sequoia.
More than that, we hope that the students'
reception will go beyond just supporting the
magazine. Today's first issue is a result of the
initiative and incentive of those who would like
the Stanford community to have a literary mag
azine.
We hope that future issues will be the result
of a mandate from a Stanford community that
desires to read a literary magazine.

ary magazine. Sequoia, in its 40 pages, brings
to the student body the stories, articles and
poems of some of its members.
Literary magazines have had a stormy and
intermittent career on campus. Nine previous
publications, under such varied titles as Stan
ford Literary Magazine, Carillon, Cardinal and
Sequoia, have come and gone. The most re
cent attempt was Viewpoint which ran for four
issues, from winter '52 to '53. A previous Se
quoia was relatively successful, running for
28 years in one form or another.
Financial difficulties have forced some of the
previous magazines out of existence. Sequoia
fortunately has sufficient funds to keep going
a while.
Editor Linda Lovelace and her staff have
worked since summer to create the foundations
for the magazine and prepare this first issue.
They showed great oplimism and determina
tion, undertaking a project which had been
begun and had failed several times. The cur
rent concern about boosting Stanford's intellec
tual atmosphere provided a strong impetus.
The English Department faculty gave h^elp

and encouragement. Sequoia adviser Wilfred
H. Stone and other men of the English faculty
formed a committee to review research articles
not written for any class which are submitted
to ihe magazine. Students may receive a unit
of "A" credit for research papers which the
committee deems worthy. This decision is in
dependent of Sequoia's acceptance or rejection
of the article for publication.
So today Stanford has a chance to see Se
quoia, another effort to provide a campus liter
ary publication. We do not expect a student
response equal to that which greets the Chap
pie. Yet editor Lovelace's prediction that the
700 copies will be sold, by noon may come true.
We do hope that the Stanford community
will show enough interest or, at the very least,
curiosity in the creative efforts of their fellow
students to support Sequoia.
More than that, we hope that the students'
reception will go beyond just supporting the
magazine. Today's first issue is a result of the
initiative and incentive of those who would like
the Stanford community to have a literary mag
azine.
We hope that future issues will be the result
of a mandate from a Stanford community that
desires to read a literary magazine.
