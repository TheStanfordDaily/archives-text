honor code case
To 'the Editor:
In The Daily of Jan. 9 I noticed the judgment of
an Honor Code case involving a graduate student
(whom I do not know) who was accused by an in
structor of plagiarism in compiling a handbook of
teaching techniques.
While I do not doubt the wisdom of the Council
in deciding after the case was brought to its attention
that this was an Honor Code offense, I do ask the two
questions: 1) did the offense justify the severity of
the punishment, especially since the student was noL
intentionally trying to deceive? and 2) wouldn't the
professor involved have been more successful with
the student by warning him of the situation, making
him rewrite the handbook and 'helping him with the
rewriting if necessary, rather than finding fault and
turning him in?
Peniaps because of faulLy teaching at lower levels,
peinaps bccause of sheer lack of time due to number
of students involved, time required by the instructor
to check references and the use of readers in under
graduate classes, you will occasionally find a graduate
•tudent (in any department) who does not understand
how to cite references properly and to document a
paper correctly.
Paraphrasing is easy, but saying things in your
own words is hard, even if the ideas or the subject

matter are familiar. Soholars have shown that a
reading knowledge of a subject is acquired fairly
quickly, but a writing or speaking knowledge doesn't
come to. Having been a cdllege instructor once
myself, I have been able to see this first hand. To
tell a student that something should be done (like
"Don't take down more than five consecutive words
from a source without using quotation marks") is
one thing, but to sihow him how to do it is another.
But it is not enough to laugh this off and say it is
"something that the student should have learned in
high school." The principle involved here is whether
you want to make a "learning experience" of this
for the student (and how ironic that this incident
occurred in education!) or whether you want to make
an honor issue of it, disclose the error socially, and
jeopardize the student rather than taking time to
teach him something he doesn't understand.
Here, too, you have the issue that has been raised
by many persons (including Pete Grotho of the Daily
staff in the issue of May 25, 1954) and that is still an
issue not only at Stanford but in higher education
generally: to what extent should a university in
structor put emphasis on good teaching and in work
ing with his students, rather than in his own research
and in assuming that the student already has some
how mastered basic techniques of writing and re
search?

To 'the Editor:
In The Daily of Jan. 9 I noticed the judgment of
an Honor Code case involving a graduate student
(whom I do not know) who was accused by an in
structor of plagiarism in compiling a handbook of
teaching techniques.
While I do not doubt the wisdom of the Council
in deciding after the case was brought to its attention
that this was an Honor Code offense, I do ask the two
questions: 1) did the offense justify the severity of
the punishment, especially since the student was noL
intentionally trying to deceive? and 2) wouldn't the
professor involved have been more successful with
the student by warning him of the situation, making
him rewrite the handbook and 'helping him with the
rewriting if necessary, rather than finding fault and
turning him in?
Peniaps because of faulLy teaching at lower levels,
peinaps bccause of sheer lack of time due to number
of students involved, time required by the instructor
to check references and the use of readers in under
graduate classes, you will occasionally find a graduate
•tudent (in any department) who does not understand
how to cite references properly and to document a
paper correctly.
Paraphrasing is easy, but saying things in your
own words is hard, even if the ideas or the subject

matter are familiar. Soholars have shown that a
reading knowledge of a subject is acquired fairly
quickly, but a writing or speaking knowledge doesn't
come to. Having been a cdllege instructor once
myself, I have been able to see this first hand. To
tell a student that something should be done (like
"Don't take down more than five consecutive words
from a source without using quotation marks") is
one thing, but to sihow him how to do it is another.
But it is not enough to laugh this off and say it is
"something that the student should have learned in
high school." The principle involved here is whether
you want to make a "learning experience" of this
for the student (and how ironic that this incident
occurred in education!) or whether you want to make
an honor issue of it, disclose the error socially, and
jeopardize the student rather than taking time to
teach him something he doesn't understand.
Here, too, you have the issue that has been raised
by many persons (including Pete Grotho of the Daily
staff in the issue of May 25, 1954) and that is still an
issue not only at Stanford but in higher education
generally: to what extent should a university in
structor put emphasis on good teaching and in work
ing with his students, rather than in his own research
and in assuming that the student already has some
how mastered basic techniques of writing and re
search?
