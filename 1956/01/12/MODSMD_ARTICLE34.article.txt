man on the team. He <1 id n't score
much on the frosh team but played
smoothly. He is a string bean at 201
pounds.
BIG SOPH

all-Wyoming high school ace for two
years and led the frosh team in scor
ing last year with a 17.8 average. He
is an excellent shot, dribbler and
ball handler but is somewhat weak
on defense.

best known for his defensive ability
but is also a fair scorer and a tough
j rebo.under. He was an Idaho all
stater in high school.
Simmons, the reserve guard, is a
reai sleeper. He dropped through 30
points ;igain.-;t UCLA, with a variety
I of outside shots and driving lay-ins.
I He may start against Stanford.
McEwen, the front line reserve, is
a rugged rebounder with a fair hook
rhot. He may get the starting call at
center.
The games this weekend will mark
the first time that Idaho and Stan
ford have met in basketball.
