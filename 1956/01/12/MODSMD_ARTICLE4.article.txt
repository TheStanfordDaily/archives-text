Three stores have opened to

The most recent addition to the
stores in operation in the center is

America.
Woodlands Restaurant is the third
recent addition. The restaurant
opened Dec. 15.
These additions bring the total
number of stores now in operation
in the Shopping Center to five. Roos

early last quarter.
All of the proposed buildings
which will house the more than 50
tenants of the completed Shopping
Center are now under construction.
There will be nine buildings in the
center.
Nearly all arrangements with the
future tenants are complete, and the
complete list of establishments will
be released pending final negotia

The plan of the completed shop
ping center has been described by
architects as "one of the most beau

Landscaping on the center is not
yet complete, but much has been
done. Late last quarter trees were
planted Â©round the periphery of the
area and down the main entrance
road.
Ample parking space is available
in the center, convenient to all the
stores.
Completion dates of the other ten
ants are not definite. Many addi
tional stores are expectcd to be in
operation by the end of next spring
when I. Magnin's is scheduled to
open.
