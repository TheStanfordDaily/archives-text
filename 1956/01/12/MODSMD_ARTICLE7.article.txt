### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Jan. 11 (UP) â€”The United States, Brit
ain and France today presented to the United Nations Security-
Council a resolution condemning Israel lor an attack last month
on Syrian outposts near the Sea of Galilee.
The resolution, which will be discussed by the Council tomor-

row, condemns the attack on Dec.
11 as a "flagrant violation" of the
Council's 1948 Palestine ceasefire
order, the Syrian-Israeli general ar
mistice agreement and Israel's obli
gations under the UN charter.
Israel contends the December raid
was in reprisal for Syrian attacks on
Israeli fishing boats in the Sea of
Galilee.
The three-power resolution took
note of the findings of UN investi
gators that the Galilee attack was a
"deliberate" violation of the Pales
tine armistice agreement, but also
noted that "there had been interfer
ence by the Syrian authorities with
Israeli activities on Lake Tiberias
(the Seu of GaLilee)."
