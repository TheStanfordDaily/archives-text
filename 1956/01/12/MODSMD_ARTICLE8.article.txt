## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles today
bluntly rejected Russian and Indian
proposals for a moratorium on H
bomb tests. He said a sure disarma
ment plan must be found before
such tests can be halted safely.
He also told his news conference
he believes the United States is
ahead of Russia in atomic and hy
drogen weapons, but added this is a
matter of speculation.
Dulles said this country's bomb
tests are designed to protect the na
tion against any possible use of such
weapons by others.
