# Cards Go for Second PCC Win, Meet Idaho Tonight in Pavilion
## Selleck, Brown Lead Stanford Against Northerners; Game to Begin at 8 p.m. 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's hustling Indians get their second taste of Pacific
Coast Conference warfare this weekend when they take on the
Idaho Vandals tonight and tomorrow night in the Pavilion. Both
games will start at 8 o'clock.
Admission will be free for all Stanford students upon presenta-

tion of student body cards.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers will
•be out to climb out of the tie for
second place in the conference as
they currently share a one win - one
loss record with five other teams.
Idaho will be attempting to get.
their first win of the conference sea
son, having dropped their first two
tilts to UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Vandals of Harlan Hodges,
who is an exponent of the fast-break
style of play, are a big but inexperi
enced club. Only two members of
the team are seniors while the other
10 are graduates of last year's highly
successful frosh team.
Big gun for the Northerners is
guard Jay Buhler. Buhler, a two
year letterman, was a second team
all-Northern Division choice last
year and is currently the squad's
leading scorer. He has hit for 172
points in 11 games.
Bill BauscTier, Buhler's running
mate at guard, is the other veteran.
He is also a two-year letterman and
is the second leading scorer behind
Buhler. Bausoher is the leader in
the Vandals' fast-break attack.
Sophomore Jim Branom, 6-8, holds
down the center post for Idaho.
Branom is a weak scorer but han
dles himself well on the boards and
around the key.
A pair of 6-5 sophs handle the
forward positions for Hodges. They
are Jack Mitchell and Jerry Jorgen
son, both high school all-staters.
Mitchell is the best shot on the
team as well as the leading rebound
er. He is tough to handle on oflcnse
but has displayed weaknesses in his
defensive play.
