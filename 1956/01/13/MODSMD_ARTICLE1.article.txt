### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's hustling Indians get their second taste of Pacific
Coast Conference warfare this weekend when they take on the
Idaho Vandals tonight and tomorrow night in the Pavilion. Both
games will start at 8 o'clock.
Admission will be free for all Stanford students upon presenta-

tion of student body cards.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers will
•be out to climb out of the tie for
second place in the conference as
they currently share a one win - one
loss record with five other teams.
Idaho will be attempting to get.
their first win of the conference sea
son, having dropped their first two
tilts to UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Vandals of Harlan Hodges,
who is an exponent of the fast-break
style of play, are a big but inexperi
enced club. Only two members of
the team are seniors while the other
10 are graduates of last year's highly
successful frosh team.
Big gun for the Northerners is
guard Jay Buhler. Buhler, a two
year letterman, was a second team
all-Northern Division choice last
year and is currently the squad's
leading scorer. He has hit for 172
points in 11 games.
Bill BauscTier, Buhler's running
mate at guard, is the other veteran.
He is also a two-year letterman and
is the second leading scorer behind
Buhler. Bausoher is the leader in
the Vandals' fast-break attack.
Sophomore Jim Branom, 6-8, holds
down the center post for Idaho.
Branom is a weak scorer but han
dles himself well on the boards and
around the key.
A pair of 6-5 sophs handle the
forward positions for Hodges. They
are Jack Mitchell and Jerry Jorgen
son, both high school all-staters.
Mitchell is the best shot on the
team as well as the leading rebound
er. He is tough to handle on oflcnse
but has displayed weaknesses in his
defensive play.


CAPTAIN GEORGE SELLECK TO LEAD INDIANS AGAINST INVADING VANDALS TONIGHT
Jorgenson is only a fair shot, but
lie is a hustler and a fine defensive
player.
Cei tain to see plenty of action is
reserve guard Gary Simmons, who
racked up 30 points against UCLA.
He is a deadly outside shooter and
an aggro... ive driver.
Coach Howie Dallmar will meet
the Vandal invasion with his new
."•tailing five of Barry Brown and
Bill Bond at forwards, Carlos Bea at
center, and captain George Sellcck
and Bill Flanders at guards.
Gary Van Galder, who has been
right in the thick of things lately,
will ;ee plenty of duty at gurad.
Brown is the Cards' leading scorer
and reboun:!er to date. He hit for 19
points against Washington la: t week
end, 14 of tlhem coming in the second
game.
BOND SLOWED
Bond has been slowed considera
bly this seaon by a bad back and an
attack of the flu. However, he is ex
peeled to lie back in full stride for
the weekend's action.
Bea has not found the scoring
range this year, but he has com-

Warriors and the MofTett Field

opposition. Both contests will start

pens a tod for his scoring weakness by
hi.s aggressive rebounding and de
fensive play.
Selleck is the key man in the In
dians' game. A superlative floor man,
Sel'leck is also the leading Stanford
scorer in conference action and the
team's second high rebounder de
spite his short stature. Idaho will be
hard pressed to handle the Compton
flash.
FLANDERS SCORES
Flanders really came into his own
against the Huskies. Despite his re
serve role, he found the range for
19 points and did some outstanding
board work.
Van Galder is yhort in experience
but not in ability. He hasn't scorched
the hoop thus far, but he plays a
top floor game.
Another Indian who will see ac
tion is Hap Wagner if his ankle is
mended. Wagner, Selleck's running
mate earlier in the season, has been
laid low by a sprain, but may be
back in top shape come tonight.
The games this weekend will mark
the first time that Stanford and Ida
ho have met on a basketball floor.
In other conference games this
weekend, leading UCLA will travel
to Pullman, Wash., to tangle with
the WSC Cougars; Oregon State will
move into Los Angeles to meet
Southern Cal, and Cal will go north
to take on Oregon. Washington
draws a bye this weekend.


BILL FLANDERS, reserve forward, will see plenty of duly tonight and
tomorrow night against the Idaho Vandals. The rugged redhead hit the
hoop for 1!) points in the two games against Washington last weekend.

Jorgenson is only a fair shot, but

Bill Bond at forwards, Carlos Bea at
center, and captain George Sellcck
and Bill Flanders at guards.

Flanders really came into his own
against the Huskies. Despite his re
serve role, he found the range for
19 points and did some outstanding
board work.
Van Galder is yhort in experience
but not in ability. He hasn't scorched
the hoop thus far, but he plays a
top floor game.
Another Indian who will see ac
tion is Hap Wagner if his ankle is
mended. Wagner, Selleck's running
mate earlier in the season, has been
laid low by a sprain, but may be

pens a tod for his scoring weakness by
hi.s aggressive rebounding and de
fensive play.
Selleck is the key man in the In
dians' game. A superlative floor man,
Sel'leck is also the leading Stanford
scorer in conference action and the
team's second high rebounder de
spite his short stature. Idaho will be
hard pressed to handle the Compton
flash.
FLANDERS SCORES
Flanders really came into his own
against the Huskies. Despite his re
serve role, he found the range for
19 points and did some outstanding
board work.
Van Galder is yhort in experience
but not in ability. He hasn't scorched
the hoop thus far, but he plays a
top floor game.
Another Indian who will see ac
tion is Hap Wagner if his ankle is
mended. Wagner, Selleck's running
mate earlier in the season, has been
laid low by a sprain, but may be
back in top shape come tonight.
The games this weekend will mark
the first time that Stanford and Ida
ho have met on a basketball floor.
In other conference games this
weekend, leading UCLA will travel
to Pullman, Wash., to tangle with
the WSC Cougars; Oregon State will
move into Los Angeles to meet
Southern Cal, and Cal will go north
to take on Oregon. Washington
draws a bye this weekend.


BILL FLANDERS, reserve forward, will see plenty of duly tonight and
tomorrow night against the Idaho Vandals. The rugged redhead hit the
hoop for 1!) points in the two games against Washington last weekend.
Stanford's hustling Indians get their second taste of Pacific
Coast Conference warfare this weekend when they take on the
Idaho Vandals tonight and tomorrow night in the Pavilion. Both
games will start at 8 o'clock.
Admission will be free for all Stanford students upon presenta-

tion of student body cards.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers will
•be out to climb out of the tie for
second place in the conference as
they currently share a one win - one
loss record with five other teams.
Idaho will be attempting to get.
their first win of the conference sea
son, having dropped their first two
tilts to UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Vandals of Harlan Hodges,
who is an exponent of the fast-break
style of play, are a big but inexperi
enced club. Only two members of
the team are seniors while the other
10 are graduates of last year's highly
successful frosh team.
Big gun for the Northerners is
guard Jay Buhler. Buhler, a two
year letterman, was a second team
all-Northern Division choice last
year and is currently the squad's
leading scorer. He has hit for 172
points in 11 games.
Bill BauscTier, Buhler's running
mate at guard, is the other veteran.
He is also a two-year letterman and
is the second leading scorer behind
Buhler. Bausoher is the leader in
the Vandals' fast-break attack.
Sophomore Jim Branom, 6-8, holds
down the center post for Idaho.
Branom is a weak scorer but han
dles himself well on the boards and
around the key.
A pair of 6-5 sophs handle the
forward positions for Hodges. They
are Jack Mitchell and Jerry Jorgen
son, both high school all-staters.
Mitchell is the best shot on the
team as well as the leading rebound
er. He is tough to handle on oflcnse
but has displayed weaknesses in his
defensive play.


CAPTAIN GEORGE SELLECK TO LEAD INDIANS AGAINST INVADING VANDALS TONIGHT
Jorgenson is only a fair shot, but
lie is a hustler and a fine defensive
player.
Cei tain to see plenty of action is
reserve guard Gary Simmons, who
racked up 30 points against UCLA.
He is a deadly outside shooter and
an aggro... ive driver.
Coach Howie Dallmar will meet
the Vandal invasion with his new
."•tailing five of Barry Brown and
Bill Bond at forwards, Carlos Bea at
center, and captain George Sellcck
and Bill Flanders at guards.
Gary Van Galder, who has been
right in the thick of things lately,
will ;ee plenty of duty at gurad.
Brown is the Cards' leading scorer
and reboun:!er to date. He hit for 19
points against Washington la: t week
end, 14 of tlhem coming in the second
game.
BOND SLOWED
Bond has been slowed considera
bly this seaon by a bad back and an
attack of the flu. However, he is ex
peeled to lie back in full stride for
the weekend's action.
Bea has not found the scoring
range this year, but he has com-
