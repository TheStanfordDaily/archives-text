# Pakistan Consul Endorses Anti-Communist Pacts
## Syed Husain Urges International Cooperation, Criticizes Knowland for Opposition to UN 
### DAVE SCOTT 
A belief in the ultimate triumph of Democracy over Communism
through strong collective security organizations was expressed
yesterday by Syed Itaat Husain, Consul-General from Pakistan.
Speaking of his young country's policies at Bowman Alumni
House under the sponsorship of the Institute of International Rela-

tions, Husain gave his hearty support
to the United Nations and anti-Com
munist defense pacts.
"We have accepted a collective de
fense system as an item in our for
eign policy. We seek to join hands
with those who want to put up a
united front against Communism. If
Hitler had been opposed by collective
defense he would not have grabbed
countries one by one like he did."
Husain reiterated that his country
was solidly democratic and anti-
Communistic. We do not have Asian
false neutrality as do India and
Burma.
"Pakistan believes that the Arabs
and Israel should settle their difficul
ties through the UN. France should
follow the example of India and with
draw from Algeria and Morocco. If
not she can expect more Dienbien
pus.

"As far as the United Nations is
concerned, your Senator Knowland
is against it. He would drive all the
people in the UN building on 42nd
Street out with sticks and stones. He
says it is merely a spider's nest. I
don't agree with him."
While giving full support to the
strongly against admitting Red China
to UN membership. "Any state that
is not peace loving and is at war with
the UN obviously should not be ad
mitted to the organisation.
On the domestic scene, Husain said
that the number one problem in his
eight-year-old country is raising the
standard of living. *' We have achieved
the position of having more than
enough food for ourselves."
He said that the economic condition
of the country had been improved.
Pakistan now rates high in the pro
duction of jute, cotton, sugar and
paper. He stressed that Pakistan
wanted "trade not aid" with the
countries of the world.
"We are seeking free, compulsory
education for all. We realize that on
education depends the fate of Pa
kistan."
He stressed that the internal gov
ernment was entirely democratic.
He declared, "We have no caste sys
tem or second-class citizens. Every
citizen is equal. We are chiefly a
Muslim nation but there is no re
ligious discrimination in Pakistan.
Christians, Muslims, Hindus and
Buddhists all get an equal opportu
nity in my country."
