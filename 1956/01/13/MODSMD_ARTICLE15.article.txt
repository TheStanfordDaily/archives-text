# INDESTRUCTIBLE
## Years Roll On... So Does Band Shack 
### DAVE SCOTT 
It's the band house now, hut the
old wooden shack across from the
gymnasium has seen successively
four eating establishments and the
ROTC within its walls. Even now
the Univcr. ity isn't ready to give up
the dilapidated quarters, but is con
sidering improvements.
The building was christened the
"University Inn" upon its opening in
October, 1808. It had recently been
constructed for the purpose of pro
viding a place for the Enema men to
eat. It was located halfway between
Quad and Enema, about the present
location of Hoover Tower.
Shortly after the opening the Daily
Palo Alto declared: "The Dining Hall
opened recently has been giving stu

dents excellent accommodations.
There are three dining rooms in
which the meals are served a la carte
by Mr. Johnson, who runs a restau
rant in San Francisco."
For a while students had the lux
ury of having their meals served by
. professional waiters, imported di
rectly from the City. However, John
son overdid himself in the luxury of
the service, and the University Inn
was closed down in 1901 because it
was going too far into debt.
The Daily Palo Alto blamed it on
University authorities who "charged
too high a rent for such a poorly ar
ranged building." Already people
were contemplating tearing down
the campus eyesore.
During the time the Inn was closed

Enema men and independents were
forced to form cooperative eating
clubs o(T campus, or walk into Paio
Alto for lunoh. Many ate at "The
Chinaman's." This establishment was
a shed set up by a Chinaman named
Chong who rang a big gong in front
of ihs shed to signify that meals were
being served. "The food is poor, but
it is hot and there is plenty of it,"
stated the alumni paper.
In January 1902, after having been
closed one quarter, the Inn was again
opened as a student co-operative
boarding club, with $4 a week being
charged for meals.
By March 1903 the Inn was so suc
cessful that all dining, rooms and
kitchens in Encina were converted
into club rooms, and Encina men
were forced to eat what the Inn had
to offer. As the 150 seating capacity
wasn't pnough, the University con
sidered enlarging the structure or
tearing it down and building a new
one, but again the plan was turned
down.
However, the student cooperative
unions soon failed and the Hall re
opened under a director, Miss Helen
Carter.
After a few years this arrange
ment proved unsatisfactory, the
quality of food not being entirely up
to the most optimistic dreams of the
Stanford men. Finally in 1905 Miss
Carter gave the Inn up as a lost
cause.
But again the Inn bounced back.
On Jan. 8, 1907, W. C. Shelton, an
enterprising Stanford junior, re
opened the hall under complete stu
dent management. The innovation of

adding ice cream to the menu made
tihe new arrangement an instant suc
cess.
For almost ten years Shelton and
his brother through the combination
of edible food and cheap rates, $15
a month, managed to make the Inn
a paying proposition.
About 1915 the Inn became a prob
lem, the food was getting worse and
the floor was beginning to rot. Uni
versity officials announced, "The
building is but a temporary struc
ture and must soon be torn down."
When in 1921 Ray Lyman Wilbur
announced that the building would
no longer be used as a dining hall,
and would be moved off the main
part of the campus, no one believed
him.
Shortly after his announcement,
the University Inn was moved over
to its present location and tempo
rarily turned over to the ROTC.
Many a Stanford man shed a tear
over the passing of the old shack
with its memories of cold vegetables
and rotten floor boards.
In the ensuing 36 years the shack
somehow or other has managed to
stay in one piece. Several years ago
the ROTC managed to get out of the
shack, and passed on the curse to the
band.
Every year, on the year, the Uni
versity has threatened to get rid of
the structure, but such plans just
didn't materialize. In fact, the Board

of Athletics is now considering put
ting a new floor in it.
After all, why let a good building
go to waste?

The building was christened the
"University Inn" upon its opening in
October, 1808. It had recently been
constructed for the purpose of pro
viding a place for the Enema men to
eat. It was located halfway between
Quad and Enema, about the present
location of Hoover Tower.
Shortly after the opening the Daily
Palo Alto declared: "The Dining Hall
opened recently has been giving stu

dents excellent accommodations.
There are three dining rooms in
which the meals are served a la carte
by Mr. Johnson, who runs a restau
rant in San Francisco."
For a while students had the lux
ury of having their meals served by
. professional waiters, imported di
rectly from the City. However, John
son overdid himself in the luxury of
the service, and the University Inn
was closed down in 1901 because it
was going too far into debt.
The Daily Palo Alto blamed it on
University authorities who "charged
too high a rent for such a poorly ar
ranged building." Already people
were contemplating tearing down
the campus eyesore.
During the time the Inn was closed

Enema men and independents were
forced to form cooperative eating
clubs o(T campus, or walk into Paio
Alto for lunoh. Many ate at "The
Chinaman's." This establishment was
a shed set up by a Chinaman named
Chong who rang a big gong in front
of ihs shed to signify that meals were
being served. "The food is poor, but
it is hot and there is plenty of it,"
stated the alumni paper.
In January 1902, after having been
closed one quarter, the Inn was again
opened as a student co-operative
boarding club, with $4 a week being
charged for meals.
By March 1903 the Inn was so suc
cessful that all dining, rooms and
kitchens in Encina were converted
into club rooms, and Encina men
were forced to eat what the Inn had
to offer. As the 150 seating capacity
wasn't pnough, the University con
sidered enlarging the structure or
tearing it down and building a new
one, but again the plan was turned
down.
However, the student cooperative
unions soon failed and the Hall re
opened under a director, Miss Helen
Carter.
After a few years this arrange
ment proved unsatisfactory, the
quality of food not being entirely up
to the most optimistic dreams of the
Stanford men. Finally in 1905 Miss
Carter gave the Inn up as a lost
cause.
But again the Inn bounced back.
On Jan. 8, 1907, W. C. Shelton, an
enterprising Stanford junior, re
opened the hall under complete stu
dent management. The innovation of

adding ice cream to the menu made
tihe new arrangement an instant suc
cess.
For almost ten years Shelton and
his brother through the combination
of edible food and cheap rates, $15
a month, managed to make the Inn
a paying proposition.
About 1915 the Inn became a prob
lem, the food was getting worse and
the floor was beginning to rot. Uni
versity officials announced, "The
building is but a temporary struc
ture and must soon be torn down."
When in 1921 Ray Lyman Wilbur
announced that the building would
no longer be used as a dining hall,
and would be moved off the main
part of the campus, no one believed
him.
Shortly after his announcement,
the University Inn was moved over
to its present location and tempo
rarily turned over to the ROTC.
Many a Stanford man shed a tear
over the passing of the old shack
with its memories of cold vegetables
and rotten floor boards.
In the ensuing 36 years the shack
somehow or other has managed to
stay in one piece. Several years ago
the ROTC managed to get out of the
shack, and passed on the curse to the
band.
Every year, on the year, the Uni
versity has threatened to get rid of
the structure, but such plans just
didn't materialize. In fact, the Board

of Athletics is now considering put
ting a new floor in it.
After all, why let a good building
go to waste?

Palo Alto declared: "The Dining Hall
opened recently has been giving stu

dents excellent accommodations.
There are three dining rooms in
which the meals are served a la carte
by Mr. Johnson, who runs a restau
rant in San Francisco."
For a while students had the lux
ury of having their meals served by
. professional waiters, imported di
rectly from the City. However, John
son overdid himself in the luxury of
the service, and the University Inn
was closed down in 1901 because it
was going too far into debt.
The Daily Palo Alto blamed it on
University authorities who "charged
too high a rent for such a poorly ar
ranged building." Already people
were contemplating tearing down
the campus eyesore.
During the time the Inn was closed

Enema men and independents were
forced to form cooperative eating
clubs o(T campus, or walk into Paio
Alto for lunoh. Many ate at "The
Chinaman's." This establishment was
a shed set up by a Chinaman named
Chong who rang a big gong in front
of ihs shed to signify that meals were
being served. "The food is poor, but
it is hot and there is plenty of it,"
stated the alumni paper.
In January 1902, after having been
closed one quarter, the Inn was again
opened as a student co-operative
boarding club, with $4 a week being
charged for meals.
By March 1903 the Inn was so suc
cessful that all dining, rooms and
kitchens in Encina were converted
into club rooms, and Encina men
were forced to eat what the Inn had
to offer. As the 150 seating capacity
wasn't pnough, the University con
sidered enlarging the structure or
tearing it down and building a new
one, but again the plan was turned
down.
However, the student cooperative
unions soon failed and the Hall re
opened under a director, Miss Helen
Carter.
After a few years this arrange
ment proved unsatisfactory, the
quality of food not being entirely up
to the most optimistic dreams of the
Stanford men. Finally in 1905 Miss
Carter gave the Inn up as a lost
cause.
But again the Inn bounced back.
On Jan. 8, 1907, W. C. Shelton, an
enterprising Stanford junior, re
opened the hall under complete stu
dent management. The innovation of

adding ice cream to the menu made
tihe new arrangement an instant suc
cess.
For almost ten years Shelton and
his brother through the combination
of edible food and cheap rates, $15
a month, managed to make the Inn
a paying proposition.
About 1915 the Inn became a prob
lem, the food was getting worse and
the floor was beginning to rot. Uni
versity officials announced, "The
building is but a temporary struc
ture and must soon be torn down."
When in 1921 Ray Lyman Wilbur
announced that the building would
no longer be used as a dining hall,
and would be moved off the main
part of the campus, no one believed
him.
Shortly after his announcement,
the University Inn was moved over
to its present location and tempo
rarily turned over to the ROTC.
Many a Stanford man shed a tear
over the passing of the old shack
with its memories of cold vegetables
and rotten floor boards.
In the ensuing 36 years the shack
somehow or other has managed to
stay in one piece. Several years ago
the ROTC managed to get out of the
shack, and passed on the curse to the
band.
Every year, on the year, the Uni
versity has threatened to get rid of
the structure, but such plans just
didn't materialize. In fact, the Board

of Athletics is now considering put
ting a new floor in it.
After all, why let a good building
go to waste?
