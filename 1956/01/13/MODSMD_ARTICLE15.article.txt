# INDESTRUCTIBLE
## Years Roll On... So Does Band Shack 
### DAVE SCOTT 
It's the band house now, hut the
old wooden shack across from the
gymnasium has seen successively
four eating establishments and the
ROTC within its walls. Even now
the Univcr. ity isn't ready to give up
the dilapidated quarters, but is con
sidering improvements.
The building was christened the
"University Inn" upon its opening in
October, 1808. It had recently been
constructed for the purpose of pro
viding a place for the Enema men to
eat. It was located halfway between
Quad and Enema, about the present
location of Hoover Tower.
Shortly after the opening the Daily
Palo Alto declared: "The Dining Hall
opened recently has been giving stu

dents excellent accommodations.
There are three dining rooms in
which the meals are served a la carte
by Mr. Johnson, who runs a restau
rant in San Francisco."
For a while students had the lux
ury of having their meals served by
. professional waiters, imported di
rectly from the City. However, John
son overdid himself in the luxury of
the service, and the University Inn
was closed down in 1901 because it
was going too far into debt.
The Daily Palo Alto blamed it on
University authorities who "charged
too high a rent for such a poorly ar
ranged building." Already people
were contemplating tearing down
the campus eyesore.
During the time the Inn was closed

Enema men and independents were
forced to form cooperative eating
clubs o(T campus, or walk into Paio
Alto for lunoh. Many ate at "The
Chinaman's." This establishment was
a shed set up by a Chinaman named
Chong who rang a big gong in front
of ihs shed to signify that meals were
being served. "The food is poor, but
it is hot and there is plenty of it,"
stated the alumni paper.
In January 1902, after having been
closed one quarter, the Inn was again
opened as a student co-operative
boarding club, with $4 a week being
charged for meals.
By March 1903 the Inn was so suc
cessful that all dining, rooms and
kitchens in Encina were converted
