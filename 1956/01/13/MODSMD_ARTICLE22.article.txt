"That a small minority is concerned about
the working of student government, which the
oretically reflects general student opinion, is
indicated by the fact ihat 25 per cent of the
students voted on the new constitution."
George Ralph made Ihat serious indictment
in these columns just prior to his election last
spuing. He was quite accurate. And this year
he and a good part of the student government
have proved it.
Student government can be—as it has been
at times—an important agency on this campus
for student opinion and ideas on issues rele
vant to university life. Student government
has cultivated an awareness among many stu
dents on vital subjects, including academic
freedom, the Honor Code and use of the stu
dents' money.
Student government, except on extremely
rare occasions, will never captivate the stu
dents so that they will all wait breathlessly for
the results of a roll call vote in the Legislature.

Bui student government can be constructive
and interesting.
This year it hasn't been. The Legislature has
barely enough incentive to pas 3 the minutes.
It rubber stamps the routine and adjourns.
But has anybody missed it? We don't think
so. The committees o 1 the ASSU that are func
tioning are able to do so irrespective of any
legislative action. The students get along fine.
The lack of spark in the Legislature is only
partially George Ralph's fault. He has done an
adequate, though not exceptional job, as stu
dent body president. Bill Tooley has been an
excellent student financial manager.
But leadership within the Legislature itself is
lacking (and this is an ex-cfficio member of the
Legislature speaking). There is no stimulus,
either from the chair or from the members.
Thus the Legislature's accomplishments are
few.
And we're al! surviving. Does it mean any
thing?
