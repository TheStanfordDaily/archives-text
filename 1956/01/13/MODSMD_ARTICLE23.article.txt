America's creaking political machinery, bad
ly in need of replacement, is being oiled once
again for another electoral period.
Soon presidential primary voting will get
under way in states from New Hampshire to
California. The results, while not entirely mean
ingless, will entail no direct determination of
the presidential candidates for either party.
Witness 1952, when Estes Kefauver for the
Democrats and Senator Taft for the Republicans
came out of the primaries in leading positions.
What happened? Kefauver was vetoed by
the party bosses (as he will be again this year)
and Taft was the loser to a tide of Eisenhower
popularity.
It was all decided during the most political
of our political processes, the convention. One
of the outmoded parts of our machinery, it
makes a mockery of the concept of popular
election.
For entertainment, there's nothing like it.
A million laughs came in 1952 from such things
as the Puerto Rico recount, the Democrats' fire
on the floor, the obviously phony parades and
celebration following nomination speeches.
Television makes it a bigger and better show
yet. On Aug. 13, when the Donkeyites gather
in Chicago, and on Aug. 20, when the GOPoli
licians invade San Francisco, the TV conven
tion show will draw mere chuckles than George

Gobel and Jack Benny put together.
And then the whole hullabaloo will explode
into the before-election campaign and culmi
nate in the voting itself—making use of an
other outmoded instrument, the electoral col
lege.
What is needed is a replacement of this en
tire machinery, if possible incorporating the
good features and eliminating the flaws of the
old. For there is certainly value in the party
unity that develops at convention, as well as
the chance for party discipline to be exercised.
The first innovation should be a national
presidential primary to directly determine the
candidates for each party. Secondly, the na
tional convention should be held soon follow
ing the primary to achieve party platform and
to unite party forces. Finally, popular election
directly of the President should be instituted.
Only then can real government of, by and
for the people come about, for only then will
the people actually make the political decision
that has previously been made by the bosses
in the smoke-filled rooms or at the whim of
convention delegates pledged to no candidate
in the final analysis.
Until this, a 23rd Amendment to the Consti
tution is formulated and enacted, America's
political machinery will continue to be a rusty,
creaking instrument.

that has previously been made by the bosses
in the smoke-filled rooms or at the whim of
convention delegates pledged to no candidate
in the final analysis.
Until this, a 23rd Amendment to the Consti
tution is formulated and enacted, America's
political machinery will continue to be a rusty,
creaking instrument.
America's creaking political machinery, bad
ly in need of replacement, is being oiled once
again for another electoral period.
Soon presidential primary voting will get
under way in states from New Hampshire to
California. The results, while not entirely mean
ingless, will entail no direct determination of
the presidential candidates for either party.
Witness 1952, when Estes Kefauver for the
Democrats and Senator Taft for the Republicans
came out of the primaries in leading positions.
What happened? Kefauver was vetoed by
the party bosses (as he will be again this year)
and Taft was the loser to a tide of Eisenhower
popularity.
It was all decided during the most political
of our political processes, the convention. One
of the outmoded parts of our machinery, it
makes a mockery of the concept of popular
election.
For entertainment, there's nothing like it.
A million laughs came in 1952 from such things
as the Puerto Rico recount, the Democrats' fire
on the floor, the obviously phony parades and
celebration following nomination speeches.
Television makes it a bigger and better show
yet. On Aug. 13, when the Donkeyites gather
in Chicago, and on Aug. 20, when the GOPoli
licians invade San Francisco, the TV conven
tion show will draw mere chuckles than George

Gobel and Jack Benny put together.
And then the whole hullabaloo will explode
into the before-election campaign and culmi
nate in the voting itself—making use of an
other outmoded instrument, the electoral col
lege.
What is needed is a replacement of this en
tire machinery, if possible incorporating the
good features and eliminating the flaws of the
old. For there is certainly value in the party
unity that develops at convention, as well as
the chance for party discipline to be exercised.
The first innovation should be a national
presidential primary to directly determine the
candidates for each party. Secondly, the na
tional convention should be held soon follow
ing the primary to achieve party platform and
to unite party forces. Finally, popular election
directly of the President should be instituted.
Only then can real government of, by and
for the people come about, for only then will
the people actually make the political decision
that has previously been made by the bosses
in the smoke-filled rooms or at the whim of
convention delegates pledged to no candidate
in the final analysis.
