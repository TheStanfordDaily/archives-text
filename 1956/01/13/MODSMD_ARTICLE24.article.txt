on plagiarism
To the Editor:
An individual, supposedly possessing the mentality
and education prerequisite to matiiculating as a grad
uate student at Stanford University, defended himself
against the charge of plagiarism by claiming that he
(apparently) didn't have a very clear idea of the
definition of the word. My astonishment at such a
defense was surpassed only by my amazement at the
words of his defender, who says lie has done college
teaching.

It would seem that your anonymous correspondent
from the education department does not consider lhat
incurring a thoroughly deserved penalty is a "learning
experience." But 1 would think that a person capable
of having a "learning experience" might have learned
from this penalty 1) what plagiarism is, 2) that a
graduate student who doesn't know how to footnote
a research paper needs a refresher course in Fresh
man English and 3) that the Honor Code is a dynamic
and vita! part of Stanford. (As an educationist, he
ought to adore the words "dynamic" and "vital"—
maybe he'll find out what they mean, too.)
