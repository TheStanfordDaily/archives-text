# 'Toonerville Trolley' Played Important Role for Two Decades of Farm Students
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Senator Leland Stanford made
his money from railroads, and in
the early days of the University,
railroads played quite a role.
Most notable was the Tooner
ville trolley, or Dinky, as it was
affectionately known to two dec
ades of Stanford students.
The Dinky ran from the Southern
Pacific depot in Palo Alto diagonally
across the field between the football
stadium and Palm Drive, and then
along the east side of Galvez (Em
barcadero) past the BAC and Encina
until the tracks reached what is now
the triangular Stern parking lot.
Then the tracks curved across Al
varado and through the backyards
to Lane B along the side of the
Bookstore. The cars stopped there,
but a spur ran up Panama alongside
the present Cellar, to the University
Press building.
BOON TO STUDENTS
Service on the line started on Oct.
11, 1909, and was a great boon to
students, since the only other public
transportation to campus were horses
and carriages, whose proprietors
charged "outrageously high prices"
—25 cents. According to legend,
however, for an extra quarter the
driver would go by way of the Cac
tus Gardens and include a swig
from his hip flask.
The new streetcar service which
was ushered in on that day in Octo
ber provided a round trip to Palo
Alto for 7 cents. The line was owned
by the Peninsular Railway Lines, an
outfit which had inter urban lines all
over Santa Clara Valley and was a
subsidiary of the Southern Pacific.
The University used to get its (
freight hauled in over a spur from
Mayfield. The main freight was oil j
cars which supplied fuel to the pow
er house which was directly across
Lasufn from the Bookstore.
MANY STORIES
There have been many stories
through the years about the Dinky,
but one of the first, and one of the
concerned the oil cars. On the
second day of service, one of these
cars got loose and started rolling
down the track just as the streetcar
neared the Bookstore.
Students saw the runaway and
raced down the track to warn the
motor man of the impending disas
ter. He hurriedly reversed his motor
and started backing away from the
menace bearing down upon him.
lie backed all the way to where
the BAC is now, before the errant
tank, car rolled to a stop.
Needles; to say, the Dinky was a
favorite target of Encina freshmen.

A favorite trick was to soap the rails
at a stop. The mMorman would apply
his brakes and skid for as much as
50 or (iO yards before the car would
stop.
A spectacular prank concerning
the Toonerville came about when the
car rounded a bend and was con
fronted by a large bonfire directly
on the tracks. When she started to
back up, there was another, even
larger, pyre which had materialised
from thin air, directly behind her.
When the orew finally got the fires
out, they started on their way—for
about five feet. The firebugs had now
securely tied the car to a large tree.
That trip was delayed for hall' an
hour.
PACKED CARS
The cars ran every 15 minutes
and had a capacity of 40, but often
Ithey would be packed with many
more than that. The Stanford foot
hall team traveled by train in those
days, lea\ng and returning from the
Palo Alto station.
There were big rallies to meet the
team each time, and all of the stu
dents would crowd aboard the Dinky
to make the trip in and back. There
would be people hanging on the ends
and sides and on the roof.
One conductor relates that he
climbed up to the roof once and col
lected fares.
The cars were quite modern when
new and were painted a bright yel

low which caused them to be dub
bed "Yellow Perils," but the Penin
sular Lines never made any money,
and the condition of the cars soon
deteriorated. They were once re
painted in red, but that was about
all.
PATRONAGE FELL
As the cars deteriorated and more
and more automobiles invaded the
campus, patronage fell, off and stu
dents returning to campus in the fall
of 1929 were greeted by the story
that the Dinky was going to be dis
continued.
Midway in October, 1929, busses
were substituted for the streetcars,
i and another Stanford tradition came
to an end. The tracks were torn up
the next spring, and today the only
evidences of the old car line are the
line of telephone poles running
through the field adjacent to El Ca
mino, and the bare path along the
eucalyptus trees bordering Galvez.
This is the old roadbed of the line.
