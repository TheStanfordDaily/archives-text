## HOW TO BE A BWOC 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy With Check," etc 
A few weeks ago in this space 1 passed on some hints to college
men who wished to become BMOCs. I would be remiss not to do
the same for college women who wish to become BWOCs.
The first and most basic step on the road to being a BWOC
is to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very
careful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is bound
to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says, "HEY!
LOOKIT ME!" Don't you make such a horrid gaffe. On your
placard put: "ZUT! REGARDEZ-MOI!" This, as you can see,
lends a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.
Once you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry
the placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make dis
tinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes
you cry, "Whip-poor-will!" you cannot but stay fresh in the
minds of onlookers.
We come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BWOC-indeed,
to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the BWOC
clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are, it is not too
much to say, a way of life.
This year the "little boy look" is all the rage on campus. Every
coed, in a mad effort to look like a little boy, is wearing short
pants, knee sox, and boy-shirts. But the BWOC is doing more.
She has g*>ne the whole hog in achieving little boyhood. She
has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her upper
lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot.
All this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her
date comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chic fem
ininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only
by a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely
coiffed, with a fresh rubber band around the ponv tail. Her
daytime scuffs have been replaced by fashionable high heeled
pumps, and she does not remove them until she gets to the movies.
After the movies at the campus cafe, the BWOC undergoes
her severest test. The true BWOC will never, never, never, order
the entire menu. This is gluttony and can only cause one's date
to blench. The true BWOC will pick six or seven good entrees
and then have nothing more till dessert. This is clans and is the
hallmark of the true BWOC.

Finally, the BWOC, upon being asked by the cigarette vendor
which is the brand of her choice, will always reply, "Philip
Morris, of corris!" For any girl knows that a Philip Morris
in one's hand stamps one instantly as a person of taste and
discernment, as the possessor of an educated palate, as a con
noisseur of the finer, gentler, higher pleasures. This Philip
Morris, this badge of savoir faire, now comes to you in a smart
new pack of red, white and gold, in king-size or regular, at
popular prices, wherever cigarettes are sold. <?m« Hhuimin. Ms
To all on campus, big or small, men or uomen, the makers of Philip
Morris, ir/io bring you this column, extend a cordial invitation to try
today's gentle I'liilip Morris, made gentle to smoke gentle.

Morris, this badge of savoir faire, now comes to you in a smart

To all on campus, big or small, men or uomen, the makers of Philip
Morris, ir/io bring you this column, extend a cordial invitation to try
today's gentle I'liilip Morris, made gentle to smoke gentle.


A few weeks ago in this space 1 passed on some hints to college
men who wished to become BMOCs. I would be remiss not to do
the same for college women who wish to become BWOCs.
The first and most basic step on the road to being a BWOC
is to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very
careful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is bound
to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says, "HEY!
LOOKIT ME!" Don't you make such a horrid gaffe. On your
placard put: "ZUT! REGARDEZ-MOI!" This, as you can see,
lends a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.
Once you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry
the placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make dis
tinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes
you cry, "Whip-poor-will!" you cannot but stay fresh in the
minds of onlookers.
We come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BWOC-indeed,
to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the BWOC
clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are, it is not too
much to say, a way of life.
This year the "little boy look" is all the rage on campus. Every
coed, in a mad effort to look like a little boy, is wearing short
pants, knee sox, and boy-shirts. But the BWOC is doing more.
She has g*>ne the whole hog in achieving little boyhood. She
has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her upper
lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot.
All this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her
date comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chic fem
ininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only
by a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely
coiffed, with a fresh rubber band around the ponv tail. Her
daytime scuffs have been replaced by fashionable high heeled
pumps, and she does not remove them until she gets to the movies.
After the movies at the campus cafe, the BWOC undergoes
her severest test. The true BWOC will never, never, never, order
the entire menu. This is gluttony and can only cause one's date
to blench. The true BWOC will pick six or seven good entrees
and then have nothing more till dessert. This is clans and is the
hallmark of the true BWOC.

Finally, the BWOC, upon being asked by the cigarette vendor
which is the brand of her choice, will always reply, "Philip
Morris, of corris!" For any girl knows that a Philip Morris
in one's hand stamps one instantly as a person of taste and
discernment, as the possessor of an educated palate, as a con
noisseur of the finer, gentler, higher pleasures. This Philip
Morris, this badge of savoir faire, now comes to you in a smart
