PEBBLt. BEACH, Calif., Jan. 12
(U.R) — The return of Ben Hogan's
"powder puff" putting touch spelled
success today for the Bing Crosby
Pro-Amateur championship as some
250 celebrities — a Who's Who of
sportsdom and movieland — honed
their games for the opening round
tomorrow.
When the Texas Bantam announc
ed he was taking off the retirement
wraps temporarily to play in the
Crosby Clambake, public interest
naturally took a big jump. And when
he sizzled around the adjacent Cy
press Point course in a seven-under
par 65 practice round yesterday, the
tourney's success was assured.
This means thousands of bucks
more for charity as Crosby picks up
the entire tab for the affair. All gate
receipts—and they've totaled more
than $300,000 for the past 10 years—
go to Monterey Peninsula charities.
