SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12
(UP) — Frankie Albert, former
Stanford All-American and the
original T - quarterback, today
became the youngest head
coach in the professional ranks
when he was named as field
boss of the San Francisco Forty
Niners.
Hailed as an "inspirational" leader
by co-owner Tony Morabito, 35-
year-old Frankie becomes the third
coach to head the San Francisco
club in as many years.
He succeeds Norman (Red) Stra
der, fired less than a month ago by
the volatile Morabito after a strife
ridden season which resulted in a
dismal 3-9 National Football League
record.
