SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12
(UP) — Frankie Albert, former
Stanford All-American and the
original T - quarterback, today
became the youngest head
coach in the professional ranks
when he was named as field
boss of the San Francisco Forty
Niners.
Hailed as an "inspirational" leader
by co-owner Tony Morabito, 35-
year-old Frankie becomes the third
coach to head the San Francisco
club in as many years.
He succeeds Norman (Red) Stra
der, fired less than a month ago by
the volatile Morabito after a strife
ridden season which resulted in a
dismal 3-9 National Football League
record.
Albert was the quarterback of the
famous Stanford Wow Boys in 1940
and led the team to the PCC cham
pionship and a Rose Bowl victory
over Nebraska. 4
The Southpaw pitcher made all -
American that year and in 1941.
Following graduation, Frankie
served in the Navy until 1946, the
year he embarked on his profession
al career with the Forty Niners. In
1949 he established a still existent
pro record of 29 touchdown passes
in a single season. ,
Following the 1952 season, he re
tired as a Forty Niner but played
one season in Canada. He returned
to the Forty Niners in 1954 as a
radio-television commentator.
Albert served the Forty Niners as
an assistant coach last season —his
baptism as a football coach. How
ever, he sat out a good pail of the
season When he was stricken with
pneumonia.
Appointment of Albert as head
man put an end to rumors that ev
eryb o d y from Cleveland's Paul
Brown to Navy's Eddie Erdalatz had
been offered the job.
Morabito said at a noon press con
ference in his plush Phelan Build
ing suite that Albert was offered the
job at 10:30 a.m. today and '"thank

God, he accepted."
After refusing to disclose terms of
the contract (a Forty Niner practice,
he said), he admitted that Albert
had little coaching experience, but
added that "he has done more for
the Forty Niners than any other one
man."
He called "Mr. T Formation" an
"inspirational leader" whom the
Forty Niner front office had ob
served "on and off the field for 11
years."
"We like * what we have seen,"
Morabito said.
Jurft last week Albert was voted
into the Football Hall of Fame.

the Forty Niners than any other one
man."

"inspirational leader" whom the
Forty Niner front office had ob
served "on and off the field for 11
years."
"We like * what we have seen,"
Morabito said.
