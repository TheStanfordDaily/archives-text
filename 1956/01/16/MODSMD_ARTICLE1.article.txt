# Frankie Gets To Start At Top Again
## Card Great Follows Old Form in New Job 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Frank Cullen Albert, Stanford
'42, is head coach of the San
Francisco 49ers and that's jus/t
fine with Norm Standlee, Stan
ford '41, and a lot of other
people.
Standlee, who played with Albert
both at Stanford and with the 49ers,
said, "I think Frankie will do a ter
rific job. He has experience, brilliant
leadership, and the respect of the
men. I know he'll have the co-oper
ation of the players."
A great deal of the experience
which Standlee spoke about included
that gained while Albert was tearing
up the gridiron for his alma mater in
1939-'4O-'4l. Frankie was an All-
America pick in '40 and '41, leading
the Indians to a Rose Bowl victory
against Nebraska in '41.
Just last week the National Foot
ball Hall of Fame announced that he
had been selected among its mem
bers, who include Bobby Grayson,
Ernie Nevers and Glenn (Pop) War
ner, other Stanford greats.
Alter graduating from Stanford in
'42 Albert went into the Navy Pre-
Flight program at St. Mary's College
and quarterbacked a strong service
team there.
After leaving the Navy Frankie
joined the 49ers as a player.
NAMED COACH
Last Thursday noon at a press
conference, owner Tony Morabito
announced that Albert had been
named coach, and since then the
little left-hander has been Stanford's
most talked-of alumnus. He replaces
Red Strader.
Frankie, 12 days shy of 36, is the
youngest coach in the National Foot
ball League. He has never before
been a head coach of anything and
has frequently said he wouldn't take
a coaching job, but Standlee takes
issue with this. "He was a coach on
the field during his playing days,"
said the Chief.
It's typical that Frankie should
start at the top. He's always been
near the top of any situation. When
he and Clark Shaughnessy were to
gether as quarterback and coach at
Stanford, Frankie rocketed to the
top as the original T - formation
quarterback.
As a player in pro football, Fran
kie was so well thought of that for
mer coach Buck Shaw of the 49ers
signed him to play for the newly
formed team in 1945, a year before
they ever played a game.
IN L A. FOR DRAFT
And now, the ink on his contract
not even dry, Albert Is en route to
Los Angeles to participate in the
annual football draft meetings. This
will be his first test. He will vie for
talent with older and more experi
enced coaches such as George Halas
and Paul Brown.
Frank has not yet decided on his
assistants. There has been some
mention that he will try to get his
Stanford teammate Vic Lindskog,
Wow Boy center, to come to work
for him. Lindskog has yet to be con
tacted.
Standlee, the great captain of the
Wow Boy Rose Bowl team, said yes
terday that "Frank will probably see
Vic in Los Angeles but as yet he has
no idea of whom the assistant job
will go to."
Albert will try to avoid the prob
lems that befell Strader. The latter
was accused by press and public
alike of running a team with poor
discipline. He was criticized for his
handling of men and this was offered
as a major cause of the team's poor
showing in NFL competition.
PLAYERS GET BREAK
Frankie said that he tries to "re
member how I felt as a player," and

(if it's o.k. with the Morabitos) he'll
"give the player every break pos
sible."
Standlee feels Albert will be suc
cessful because "he's one heck of a
fine leader. He can get guys to do
things that others can't. Fie has a lot
of confidence and it's a contagious
kind of confidence. Just being with
him makes a player feel more con
fident in himself."
About the kind of ball the 49ers
will play under Albert, Standlee
said, "He'll probably let the quarter
back run the team although he will
doubtless give him some help from
the sidelines."
The Chief can't prophesy what
the offense will be like, though.
"When we were playing together
even his own teammates didn't al
ways know what was happening. It's
a cinch the opposition won't."
INTENSE, SMART
A former frequent opponent, Otto
Graham, told a San Francisco news
paper Thursday that he has "never
known a more intense competitor
than Frankieâ€”or a smarter one. He
just never quits trying."
Morabito. at the Thursday press
conference, said that "as a charter
member of the '49ers Albert did as
much for the team as any man I
know. We watched him on and off
the field for 11 years and we like
what we saw."
"GREAT HONOR"
Little Joe Arenas said that "it was
a great honor to play with Frankie,
and it will be as great an honor to
play for him . . . we'll all play just
a little bit harder because of our
friendship for him."
Hard - hitting Hardy Brown en
dorsed the move. He said, "It's a
hell of a good move. Frank has an
amazing talent for getting along with
the guys and getting the best out of
them."
Gordy Soltau, who caught so many
Albert passes he lost count, said,
"Frankie is a great leader. I know
the players will really put out for
him. The guys were all hoping he
would be chosen and I know they're
happy now that they've got the
news."
The opinion of the man on the
street to the move is split. There is
a lot of "who'd he ever coach" talk,
but fans are sure of one thing: The
team will be, as Standlee put it, "a
pleasure to watch."
