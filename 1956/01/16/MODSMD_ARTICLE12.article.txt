# Sequoia to Sell Second Printing
## 
### 
The first issue of Sequoia, Stan
ford's new literary magazine, was
completely sold out by 11 a.m. last
Thursday.
Because of this unexpected sale
and the number of students still
wishing to secure copies, the mag
azine will reissue a small number
of copies Wednesday or Thursday,
according to Editor Linda Love
lace.
Four selling booths will be set
up: inside the library, in the Cel
lar, at the Post Office and on En
gineering Corner.
Miss Lovelace is now asking for
articles, poems and short stories
for Sequoia's next issue. Contrib
utors should contact her immedi
ately at the Sequoia office, Room
335 above the library, or by phone.
