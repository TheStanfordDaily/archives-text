# 'FEARLESS YEARS'
## Copland Characterizes 20's As Period of Experimentation 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
Aaron Copland, noted American composer, drew capacity
crowds Friday for his talk on Music in the Twenties, and these
returned Sunday to hear a concert in Cubberley Auditorium de
voted to his music.
In his talk Copland characterized the twenties as a "period of

experimentation," free of the wor
ries and fears that followed World
War 11. He said that all contempo
rary music has its origin in this pe
riod or the ten years preceding it.
Among the composers who rose to
the fore during this period were Igor
Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg and,
to a lesser extent, Bela Bartok.
"They had written before this
time, but their music didn't register
in a big way," Copland commented.
NEO-CLASSICISM
Among trends which Copland
named as originating in the 20's was
the neo-classicism which Stravinsky
used to put an end to the romantic
tradition of Tchaikovsky and Wag
ner.
"He realized that to really get
away from the romantic he had to
return to the objective, the style of
Handel and Bach," Copland said.
The second chief contribution of
this period was the atonal music
which Schoenberg used in his com
positions. Although he originated
the 12-tone scale, Schoenberg loved
the classics, and considered himself
the victim of his invention.
FRENCH GROUP
A French group of six composers,
the most famous of whom are Arthur
Honegger and Darius Milhaud, were
the chief exponents of this theory.
An offshoot of this movement were
the German composers who tried
to write more popular operas, the
best-known of whom is Kurt Weill
who created the Three-penny Op
era.
"The keynote of this period was to
sec what it was like to try any
thing," stated Copland. Experiments
with the percussion section, new no
tation systems, and mechanical mu
sic grew from this philosophy.
Many of the 1920 influences \Vere
evident in the music by Copland
presented in yesterday's concert. Es
pecially, in "Lincoln Portrait"the
percussion instruments were used
effectively, including two xylophones
and a gong, as well as the usual
drums and cymbals.
NO LUSH NESS
Copland has followed Stravinsky's
lead in neo-classicism. His music,
especially the sonata for violin and
piano, was devoid of the lushness ad
mired by the romantics. The verses
in "The Lark" were done in a sharp,
disconnected rhythm, understating
the emotion of the words.
"Lincoln Portrait"and choruses
from"The Tender Land," probably
the best works in the concert, were
notable for their portrayal of the
American scene. Folk music was
used effectively in the former, and
the main fault to be found with
either was that they were a bit too
loud for Cubberley.

War 11. He said that all contempo
rary music has its origin in this pe
riod or the ten years preceding it.
Among the composers who rose to
the fore during this period were Igor
Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg and,
to a lesser extent, Bela Bartok.
"They had written before this
time, but their music didn't register
in a big way," Copland commented.
NEO-CLASSICISM
Among trends which Copland
named as originating in the 20's was
the neo-classicism which Stravinsky
used to put an end to the romantic
tradition of Tchaikovsky and Wag
ner.
"He realized that to really get
away from the romantic he had to
return to the objective, the style of
Handel and Bach," Copland said.
The second chief contribution of
this period was the atonal music
which Schoenberg used in his com
positions. Although he originated
the 12-tone scale, Schoenberg loved
the classics, and considered himself
the victim of his invention.
FRENCH GROUP
A French group of six composers,
the most famous of whom are Arthur
Honegger and Darius Milhaud, were
the chief exponents of this theory.
An offshoot of this movement were
the German composers who tried
to write more popular operas, the
best-known of whom is Kurt Weill
who created the Three-penny Op
era.
"The keynote of this period was to
sec what it was like to try any
thing," stated Copland. Experiments
with the percussion section, new no
tation systems, and mechanical mu
sic grew from this philosophy.
Many of the 1920 influences \Vere
evident in the music by Copland
presented in yesterday's concert. Es
pecially, in "Lincoln Portrait"the
percussion instruments were used
effectively, including two xylophones
and a gong, as well as the usual
drums and cymbals.
NO LUSH NESS
Copland has followed Stravinsky's
lead in neo-classicism. His music,
especially the sonata for violin and
piano, was devoid of the lushness ad
mired by the romantics. The verses
in "The Lark" were done in a sharp,
disconnected rhythm, understating
the emotion of the words.
"Lincoln Portrait"and choruses
from"The Tender Land," probably
the best works in the concert, were
notable for their portrayal of the
American scene. Folk music was
used effectively in the former, and
the main fault to be found with
either was that they were a bit too
loud for Cubberley.
Aaron Copland, noted American composer, drew capacity
crowds Friday for his talk on Music in the Twenties, and these
returned Sunday to hear a concert in Cubberley Auditorium de
voted to his music.
In his talk Copland characterized the twenties as a "period of

experimentation," free of the wor
ries and fears that followed World
War 11. He said that all contempo
rary music has its origin in this pe
riod or the ten years preceding it.
