# a 						sense of fair play

### 
Over at Berkeley two Saturdays ago, a bas
ketball game was forfeited by California to
Southern California because the fans were
throwing pennies cn the floor and at the ref
eree. Whether Cal students were responsible
for the disturbance is somewhat questionable,
but nevertheless a Cal student body official
said he was "ashamed" of his looting section.
In the ncw-condemned UCLA gyrn last year,
Stanford players were slugged and pushed by
UCLA fans along the sidelines and were ridden
unmercifully (to the accompaniment of blaring
band instruments) when they sieppsd to the
free throw line.
Last Saturday night in the Pavilion, a ques
tionable foul was called on Stanford's Hap
Wagner. As the Idaho player got set for the

foul try, the crowd showed its displeasure at
the ref's call by hissing and screaming to dis
tract the Idaho player.
We made the following statement in these
columns last year: "Booing and yelling while
"a visiting player is readying for a free throw is
one of the most downright unsportsmanlike
gestures any sports crowd can make."
That is why we were particularly pleased
when Stanford captain George Selleck stopped
the Idaho man from shooting and motioned for
the crowd to be silent. Except for a few die
hard poor sports, his request was followed.
We salute George Selleck for his sense of
fair play. We hope that other players around
the country follow his lead.
