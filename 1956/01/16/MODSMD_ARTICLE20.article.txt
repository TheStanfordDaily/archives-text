The frosh have a chance to buy membership
in their class, as the Class of '59 card sale gets
under way today. A class membership x is a
nice thing to have and the class treasury can
use the money. V/ho knows, maybe they'll
pull a Sequoia »nd sell out.

professor and professror of classics at Prince
ton, will leciure on "The Humanities in a Sci
entific Age." 7:30, Mem Aud.

Wednesday afternoon, at the Little Theater
Matinee, there will be a program of undoubted
interest but bf somewhat narrow appeal. Any
way, they're planning on showing three films
demonstrating new, experimental techniques
in movie-making. Ccrne one, come all. Show
starts at 4:15.
THRILLS! CHILLS! THRILLS! Wednesday
night you can see "Dracula" (uncut) and "Fran
kenstein" if you come to Mem Aud at 7:30
with a 50-cent donation knotted in the corner
of your hanky. The showing is being spon
sored by the Winter Quarter Drives Committee
for the World University Service. It is inter
esting to note that the ASSU Legislature is
meeting at 4 in the afternoon on Wednesday
so that all members of our gloriously-ridiculous
student government may be free that night to
support a campus charity function. As a matter
of fact, the combination of "Dracula" and
"Frankenstein" and the Legislature should pro
vide one of the best evening's entertainment
we've ever seen.

Thursday afternoon at 4:15, Professor Cros
ten, from the Knoll, will lecture to an open
meeting of the Philological Association on
"The Idea of Opera." Should be an interesting
talk, and an invitation has been extended to all
those who care to come. Women's Clubhouse,
lower lounge.

Thursday night at 7:30, the Film Series
brings Italy and Vittorio De Sica to Cubberley
Auditorium. Movie's called "Miracle in Mi
iano" and stars one Francesco Golisano. There
seem to be a few extra tickets still available for
the series, so it's not yet too late to join.
Saturday afternoon at 3, Dave Brubeck plays
"Jazz at Mem Aud" for the charity drive. Spon
sored by the Class of '57, the concert will fea
ture modern jazz, as interpreted by Brubeck,
Paul Desmond, Joe Dodge and Norman Bates.
For an admission price of SI .50, you can give
charity a boost, hear Brubeck in person and
get in out of the inevitable rain. How can you
lose? Quien sabe?
Sunday morning, Memorial Church com
memorates its 52nd anniversary with the regu
lar 11 o'clock service. The Rev. R. M. Minta
will preach the sermon.
Sunday afternoon at 4, Herbert B. Nanney,
hand in glove with Harold C. Schmidt and his
University Choir, will appear in concert with a
program of music for the organ and mixed
voices. Should be a nice way to end up the
weekend.

Sunday night at the flicks: Dorothy Dan
dridge and Harry Belafonte will entertain the
crowd with "Carmen Jones." In technicolor
and CinemaScope, this is a movie not to be
missed. The sound track is tremendous, the
two stars are great, the color is great and of
course the music is great. This is one tremen
dous flick, friends, and the two bits it costs
for admission is a mere nothing, compared to
what will await you on the inside. Mem Aud,
7:30.
Astounding Fact of the Week: The 2000 th
"Howdy Doody" program was telecast on lan.
6. Did you see it?
