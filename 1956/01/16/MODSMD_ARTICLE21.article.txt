To the Editor:
In The Daily of Jan. 13, in an article 'by Dave
Brownwood, - luff editor, concerning the first ASSU
Legislature meeting of the quarter, there appears the
statement, a meeting which proved to be short
and routine with no important discussions or deci
ions." The r.exl thiee paragraphs are then devoted
to t'hc discission of the NSA Model Educational Prac
tices and Standards with t'h« -finall conclusion of the
Legislature to withhold action on the matter until
further information might ibe available.
Assuming Mr. Brownwood wa: objectively report
ing those events which he, as an Editorial Board
member of a newspaper, deemed to be of interest to
'his readers, the statement appears to be indicative
ot an attitude at Stanford which is deplorable. The
mctter of selectivity ,and di crimination in American
colleges end universities wa* of suffic'eni importance
to be the subject of 'a national intercollegiate confer
ence on the :• ubject held at M.I.I, last spring and at
thai time a delegate from Stanford was present.
In the summaries of ifchst conference it appeared
that the Western vo'.'cge"., among .hem Stanford, held
the balance in the problem of discriminatory clauses.
It wa? al:o stated by almost all of the Western
schools, again including Stanford, that the problems
of selectivity and discrimination did no', yet. exLt on
their campuses to the extern that they did in other
parts of tihe country Ibut that it was felt these prob
lems would reach that intern hy in t'he near future.
In the light of the concern that is exhibited by
college -tudents in other parts of the country it would
seem that:
1. Although con tantly assailed by aspects of the
problem, Stanford undergraduates are unaware
of its existence.
2. Stanford undergraduates are actually in sym
pathy with the supporters of discriminatory
clau-.es but don't have the courage of their
convictions to com? out and defend them openly.

3. Stanford undergraduates don't care.
The first alternative seems almost impossible, con
sidering the amount of discussion on the problem
going on throughout the college World.
The second does not seem improbable except for
the fact that certain indications in the past, such as
Cheers at the Big Game, have shown that Stanford
students are perfectly willing to express their opin
ions.
The last seems to be the mo.t highly probable,
which woidd confhm the ideas that many people hold
who come here from c fiber educational institutions,
that the Stanford undergraduate body is completely
"out of it" when it comes to questions of any im
portance.

To the Editor:
Since our arrival at Stanford, we have encoun
tered many rules and restrictions which have been
attributed to Mrs. Stanford's will. It appears that
every time someone questions one of these regula
tions, the University officials or student government
uses tl i% will as an explanation. We are surprised
thaL the terms of the will can be applied to situations
that we believe were nonexistent at the time of its
drafting.
A clarification of tfhis i ue is necessary! We.sug
gest that The Stanford Daily clarify this issue by
publishing all parts of Mrs. Stanford's will which
pertain to University policy regarding students.

In The Daily of Jan. 13, in an article 'by Dave
Brownwood, - luff editor, concerning the first ASSU
Legislature meeting of the quarter, there appears the
statement, a meeting which proved to be short
and routine with no important discussions or deci
ions." The r.exl thiee paragraphs are then devoted
to t'hc discission of the NSA Model Educational Prac
tices and Standards with t'h« -finall conclusion of the
Legislature to withhold action on the matter until
further information might ibe available.
Assuming Mr. Brownwood wa: objectively report
ing those events which he, as an Editorial Board
member of a newspaper, deemed to be of interest to
'his readers, the statement appears to be indicative
ot an attitude at Stanford which is deplorable. The
mctter of selectivity ,and di crimination in American
colleges end universities wa* of suffic'eni importance
to be the subject of 'a national intercollegiate confer
ence on the :• ubject held at M.I.I, last spring and at
thai time a delegate from Stanford was present.
In the summaries of ifchst conference it appeared
that the Western vo'.'cge"., among .hem Stanford, held
the balance in the problem of discriminatory clauses.
It wa? al:o stated by almost all of the Western
schools, again including Stanford, that the problems
of selectivity and discrimination did no', yet. exLt on
their campuses to the extern that they did in other
parts of tihe country Ibut that it was felt these prob
lems would reach that intern hy in t'he near future.
In the light of the concern that is exhibited by
college -tudents in other parts of the country it would
seem that:
1. Although con tantly assailed by aspects of the
problem, Stanford undergraduates are unaware
of its existence.
2. Stanford undergraduates are actually in sym
pathy with the supporters of discriminatory
clau-.es but don't have the courage of their
convictions to com? out and defend them openly.

3. Stanford undergraduates don't care.
The first alternative seems almost impossible, con
sidering the amount of discussion on the problem
going on throughout the college World.
The second does not seem improbable except for
the fact that certain indications in the past, such as
Cheers at the Big Game, have shown that Stanford
students are perfectly willing to express their opin
ions.
The last seems to be the mo.t highly probable,
which woidd confhm the ideas that many people hold
who come here from c fiber educational institutions,
that the Stanford undergraduate body is completely
"out of it" when it comes to questions of any im
portance.

To the Editor:
Since our arrival at Stanford, we have encoun
tered many rules and restrictions which have been
attributed to Mrs. Stanford's will. It appears that
every time someone questions one of these regula
tions, the University officials or student government
uses tl i% will as an explanation. We are surprised
thaL the terms of the will can be applied to situations
that we believe were nonexistent at the time of its
drafting.
A clarification of tfhis i ue is necessary! We.sug
gest that The Stanford Daily clarify this issue by
publishing all parts of Mrs. Stanford's will which
pertain to University policy regarding students.
