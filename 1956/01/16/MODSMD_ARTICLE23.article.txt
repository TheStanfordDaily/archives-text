# Piatigorsky Plays Evocative Music on Famed Stradivarius
## Cellist Gives Excellent Recital on 18th Century Instrument 
### STEW TOY 
Cellist Gregor Piatigorsky
showed a capacity Memorial
Auditorium audience at his con
cert Friday night why it was that
he, in the words of Newswoek
magazine, "has brought about a
cello renaissance."
His playing, on his recently-pur
chased Batita Stradivarius, had the
ethereal sweetness of a violin plus
the traditional throaty sul: tanse of
the cello.
Perhaps the Stradivarius has
brought about a renaissance in its
r layer.
Piatigorsky bought the famed in-
Irument, generally acknowledged to
be one of the three finest celli in the
world and considered by some ex
perts the greatest of the three, last
November.
AMERICAN DEBUT
Made in 1714 and originally owned
by Belgian cellist Alexander Butta,
it made its American debut here Fri
day night and received its fir_t pub
lic piaying anywhere in this century.
It was hard to determine whether
the hypnotic notes Piatigorsky pull
ed with his bow were due more to
his own skiii or to the excellence of
his instrument.
But whatever the combination of
causes, the result was superb and
emotionally evocative music.
Piatigor-ky's virtuosity at inter
pretation is a constant amazement.
His program ran through the mas
ters from Baoh to Debussy, his play
ing' proceeding with all the natural
and logical force of the progressive
transit,ions from the Classical to the
Romantic period.
BEST SELECTION
Possibly his be t selection was his
own composition, a set of variations
on the omnipresent Theme of Paga
nini.
His only fault, a slight one, was
one of apparently not being accus
tomed to his new instrument. At one
point when the cello gave out sev
eral less-than-perfect noises Piati
gorsky seemed disturbed at his in
adequacy to pull the utmost from
'his best of possible instruments.
Happily, the accompanist played
no solos; but, as ever, the hypocriti
cal Concert Series encores were
present in their usual enthusiastic
strength.
