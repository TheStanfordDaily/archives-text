Pacific Coast Conference with a
pair of wins over the invading
Idaho Vandals last Friday and
Saturday nights in the Pavilion.
Final scores were 77-60 on Fri

The two wins give Stanford a con
ference record of three wins and one
loss, good for a tie with Southern
Cal for second place behind UCLA,
which has four wins without a loss.
Idaho made it a close first half in
each game, but couldn't stay with
Howie Dallmar's crew in the second
half.
Barry Brown was the big bomber
for the Cards in the fir.-1 half of Fri
day ni"P.t\ game. Brown personally
accounted for 10 points in the first

ferase on Stanford that gave the
Cards fits until some sharp passing
by the Indians opened it up.
The first half of Saturday's game
started out with neither team able
to buy a basket. Idaho hit only once
from the fiedd in the first 10 minutes
witli Stanford ringing the bell only
four times. Some accurate shooting
from the charity line kept the Van
dals in the game at this stage.
At the seven minute mark, Idaho
came back to tie Stanford at 18 all.
Buhler led this splurge as he hit
eight points in succession for the
Northerners.
The teams traded almost point for
point until, with the score tied at 26,
Bond connected with one of his

patented jump shots 15 seconds be
fore the gun to give the Cards a 28-
2G Jead.

The second half loosened up con
siderably as Idaho's man-to-man de
fense began to slip and both teams
got hot. The score was tied six times
in the first eight minutes of the sec
ond half.
Mitchell and Bauscher between
them accounted for every Idaho

the load for the Cards:
The Indians, after Idaho creeped
out to a 44-41 lead, suddenly splurg
ed with nine straight points,-and, for
all intents and purposes, that was
the ball game.
The Indians slowly increased their
lead with Bond and Brown doing
the hoop work while the Vandals
began to tire rapidly under the fast
pace.
STANFORD ACCURATE
Stanford wound up hitting at a
42.6 per cent clip compared to Ida
ho's 29.9 pel* cent. Accurate free

more, took scoring honors for the
game with 28 points. Bond whipped
through 25 markers for the Cards,
while Selleck was right behind with
