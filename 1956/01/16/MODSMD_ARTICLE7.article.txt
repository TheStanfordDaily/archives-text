WASHINGTON â€”President Eisen
hower will send Congress tomorrow
the Government's first balanced
'budget in five years.
The black-ink spending program,
calling for more than $65 billion in
federal outlays for national defense
and other foreign and domestic proj
ects, will largely determine whether
tfhere is to be a tax cut this year.
Botih Republican and Democratic
congressional leaders generally sup
port the President's position, al
though some have insisted thai gov

ernmenit revenues will be high
enough to warrant an election-year
tax cut.
