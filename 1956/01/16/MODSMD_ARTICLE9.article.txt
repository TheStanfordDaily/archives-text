## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate
squared off today for one of its hot
test battles of the election-year ses
sion over a bill to exempt independ
ent. natural gas producers from fed
eral control.
The bill, which would overturn a
1954 Supreme Court, decision, has
caused a sharp split between Demo
crats from gas-producing states and
their party colleagues from gas-con
suming areas. In general, it is a
■breach between northern and south
ern Democrats.
Opponents contend that freeing in
dependent producers from federal
control would add as much as $800
million a year to consumer gas bills.
Proponents, like Fullbright, claim the
bill will promote the "interests of
the consumer" by assuring an ade
quate supply of gas.
