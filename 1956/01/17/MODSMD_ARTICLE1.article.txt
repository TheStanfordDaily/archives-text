# FOREIGN SCHOLAR
## Fujiko Imamura Amazed At Freedom of U.S. Women 
### GERRY SMITH 
The independence of American women is bo.th startling and
wonderful to Fujiko Imamura, ASSU foreign scholar from Japan.
Most indicative of this independence in Miss Imamura's eyes
is the fact that so many American women smoke. "It shows self
satisfaction—they are adults, they are free, they can marry.

"In Japan before the war, very few
women smoked. Now they, too, are
free — and they have begun to
smoke."
Miss Imamura is a junior here
majoring in English. In Japan she
attended Hokusei Woman's College
in Sapporo, on the northern island
of Hokkaido, where she was student
body president in 1954.
JAPANESE SCHOOLS
She doesn't feel her school is rep
resentative of Japanese schools in
general, because it is only for wom
en and is affiliated with the Pres
byterian church. However, she no
tices many differences between it
and Stanford.
The main difference is in exams.
In Japan they have exams only four
times a year. Those who don't want
to study except for exams can do
other things during the semester.
OVERPOPULATION
But Japanese students have a very
strong incentive to study. If they
don't have high grades, they find it
very difficult to get jobs. The main
reason for this is the overpopulation
problem, which leads to few jobs
and an enormous number of appli
cations, according to Miss Imamura.
Another difference between Hoku
sei and Stanford is the student
professor relationship. "In Japan the
professor belongs to the university,
so there is (little contact with stu
dents outside of classes," she noted.
"On my first day of classes here, the
professor said 'Hi'—l didn't know
what to say."
MARIPOSA RESIDENT
Miss Imamura, who lives at Mari
posa this quarter, especially enjoys
being at a resident university. In
Japan resident universities are im
possible because of financial prob
lems and the great number of stu
dents.
She also notices a difference be
tween Japanese and American men.
"Most American boys are very kind,"
she commented. "They are very
much gentlemen. Japanese boys do
not show feeling as much—maybe
they're shy or maybe not used to it.
CRYING IN HEARTS
"We have a different way of think
ing, a different culture. We smile
when we want to cry. During the
war many mothers would say they
were glad their sons had died for
the emperor, but they would be cry
ing in their hearts."
Speaking of the relationship be
tween the United States and Japan,
Miss Imamura said: "Japanese feel
ing toward America is favorable, but
some things cause anti - American
feeling for which I am very, very
sorry.
"Because of improvement in ar
maments, the American military
wants to enlarge military installa
tions. Since the Japanese Govern
ment agrees on that point, they want
to try to buy the land from the
fanners.
LAND TRADITION
"But, regardless of the amount of
money, the Japanese farmers don't
want to sell the land. From genera
tion to generation, their ancestors
were born, lived and died on that
land. It is wort'h much more than
money.
"Therefore, there arises a conflict
between the Japanese Government
and the people. And of course the
confliat becomes a conflict between
the Japanese farmer and the Ameri
cans."

In Japan they have exams only four
times a year. Those who don't want
to study except for exams can do
other things during the semester.
OVERPOPULATION
But Japanese students have a very
strong incentive to study. If they
don't have high grades, they find it
very difficult to get jobs. The main
reason for this is the overpopulation
problem, which leads to few jobs
and an enormous number of appli
cations, according to Miss Imamura.
Another difference between Hoku
sei and Stanford is the student
professor relationship. "In Japan the
professor belongs to the university,
so there is (little contact with stu
dents outside of classes," she noted.
"On my first day of classes here, the
professor said 'Hi'—l didn't know
what to say."
MARIPOSA RESIDENT
Miss Imamura, who lives at Mari
posa this quarter, especially enjoys
being at a resident university. In
Japan resident universities are im
possible because of financial prob
lems and the great number of stu
dents.
She also notices a difference be
tween Japanese and American men.
"Most American boys are very kind,"
she commented. "They are very
much gentlemen. Japanese boys do
not show feeling as much—maybe
they're shy or maybe not used to it.
CRYING IN HEARTS
"We have a different way of think
ing, a different culture. We smile
when we want to cry. During the
war many mothers would say they
were glad their sons had died for
the emperor, but they would be cry
ing in their hearts."
Speaking of the relationship be
tween the United States and Japan,
Miss Imamura said: "Japanese feel
ing toward America is favorable, but
some things cause anti - American
feeling for which I am very, very
sorry.
"Because of improvement in ar
maments, the American military
wants to enlarge military installa
tions. Since the Japanese Govern
ment agrees on that point, they want
to try to buy the land from the
fanners.
LAND TRADITION
"But, regardless of the amount of
money, the Japanese farmers don't
want to sell the land. From genera
tion to generation, their ancestors
were born, lived and died on that
land. It is wort'h much more than
money.
"Therefore, there arises a conflict
between the Japanese Government
and the people. And of course the
confliat becomes a conflict between
the Japanese farmer and the Ameri
cans."

The independence of American women is bo.th startling and
wonderful to Fujiko Imamura, ASSU foreign scholar from Japan.
Most indicative of this independence in Miss Imamura's eyes
is the fact that so many American women smoke. "It shows self
satisfaction—they are adults, they are free, they can marry.

"In Japan before the war, very few
women smoked. Now they, too, are
free — and they have begun to
smoke."
Miss Imamura is a junior here
majoring in English. In Japan she
attended Hokusei Woman's College
in Sapporo, on the northern island
of Hokkaido, where she was student
body president in 1954.
JAPANESE SCHOOLS
She doesn't feel her school is rep
resentative of Japanese schools in
general, because it is only for wom
en and is affiliated with the Pres
byterian church. However, she no
tices many differences between it
and Stanford.
