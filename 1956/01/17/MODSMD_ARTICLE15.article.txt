# Hoover Urges Relief Of Presidential Duties
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€” Former President
Hobver told Congress today it must
lift the "huge unnecessary burdens"
hanging over U. S. Presidents "if we

are going to keep them alive."
Mr. Hoover, who made clear he
thinks the burdens of the presidency
helped bring on President Eisen

j bower's heart attack, urged creation
of a new office of "Administrative
j Vice President" to relieve the Presi
dent of some 25 specific duties.
Former President Truman opposed
the idea. The White House said it
sees no need for it but would have
"no c'bjection." But Mr. Hoover, ap
pearing before a Senate Government
Operations subcommittee studying
the problem, was emphatic on the
subject.
"The nation's experience with the
seven more recent Presidents," he
said, "should constitute a call to
action. Four of them have been in
capacitated in critical periods.
"Such a calamity would not Likely
Have happened to any of these men
in private life."


HERBERT HOOVER
