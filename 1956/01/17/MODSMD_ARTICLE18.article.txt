"The Vilest Rag Imaginable" — that's what
the University of British Columbia paper, "The
Übyssey," is now proudly proclaiming itself.
Father E. C. Pappert in a study of all Ca
nadian college dailies declared the Western
paper as freest of censorship and called the
Übyssey "ihe vilest rag you can imagine, and
the best argument for censorship that can be
produced."
The editor of the paper replied that his paper
wasn't exactly "lily white," but that it merely
reflected student iife and character. "A paper
that is rigorously censored can certainly never
claim to be a representative university news
paper," the editor replied.
Consequently the paper is proudly running
the words "The Vilest Rag Imaginable" under
its masthead.
The truth of the matter is that the Chappie
could take a few lessons from this daily col
lege paper. Almost every edition is blessed
with a front-page picture of females in tight
fitting attire that would put Chappie queens of
the month to shame. Every picture is accom
panied by appropriate comment. The edito
rials include such subjects as Christine and ex
poses of fraternity parties.
Even the weather reports are made interest
ing with the forecast of rain always being ac
companied by a drawing of a curvaceous crea
ture, wearing nary a stitch, tripping lightly
through the plunging precipitation. #
Even the letters to the editor are sparkling
and enlightening. Heavy drinkers of Cellar
coffee ough: to appreciate the correspondence
that appeared in the Jan. 5 paper. The student
stated:
"The coffee recently selected by a commit
tee of students to be served in the cafeteria is,
in my opinion, rct-gut. I have tasted better
made with alkali water, or from spruce needles.
"I suggest the cafeteria return to making the
dirty dishwater they have sold as coffee for so
long, and return the present brew to the tan
nery vats."

Effigy hanging continues to roll merrily
along. This time it was a ceramics professor
at the University of Washington.
But the usual dummy wasn't the only thing.
When the professor walked into his office the
morning after Christmas vacation he found the

following assorted items: 1400 inflated bal
loons, an empty beer case, a step ladder, a
large-size rubbish can, two tall tanks of oxygen
and acetylene and a dummy, apparently of
himself, hanging from the light fixture.
The professor denied that he had thrown a
New Year's office party.
A student informer said that it took six work
ers five hours to put the office in proper holi
day atmosphere. The balloons were all blown
up with sheer lung power.
"Acres and acres," exclaimed the professor
looking at the balloons, "and they're all mine."

Advertisement in a recent edition the
Daily Trojan: "GHOST WRITE, edit, research,
rewrite theses, term papers. AT 1-057 L" That
Figueroa Street mob must really have quite an
honor code.
Speaking of the University of Smogville,
there has been no news recently of Patty Wag
gin, that interpretative dancer whose presence
in the Kappa Sig residence caused the tempo
rary halting of that organization's activities.
Patty would probably be glad to spruce up
otherwise dull rushing parties on this campus.

Course of the week (offered at Sarrta Monica
JC next semester): skin diving. But the best is
yet to come, men. It's coeducational, yet. A
good spring quarter curriculum item for this
institution of higher learning.

From the West Lockesburg (Ark.) City Col
lege "Wildcat Clarion":
"After a long and bitter struggle with the
Board of Regents, the Academic Curriculum
Committee has won its battle to expand the
WLCC's liberal arts program.
"Beginning Feb. 5, opening of spring semes
ter, the catalogue of courses will contain three
ornithological courses: Bird Calling, Orn. 121;
Bird Watching, Orn. 122; and Bird Identifica
tion, Orn. 123.
"City College President Charles J. "Jumbo"
Boone, a long-time bird fancier himself, feels
that the move is 'just what this little old school
needs. It's just the thing to put us on the orni
thological map.'
"Dean Horace S. Sern of the general sciences
department told the Clarion last night that
'WLCC will make other colleges throughout
the country sit up and take notice'."
