all 7000 of us?

To the Editor:
Mr. Nasatir's letter of Jan. 1 was quite difficult
to understand as he relied too heavily upon terms
which he failed to define. What are the problems of
selectivity and discrimination which the NSA has
said exist to only a slight extent on Western cam
puses, and what are the questions of great importance
which the body of Stanford undergraduates does not
seem to care about and is consequently "out of it,"
in Mr. Nasatir's words?
The present controversy concerning the relative
merits of the extracurricular program here at Stan
ford and on other campuses certainly points to the
fact that intellectually a number of college students

are "out of it." But this does not allow anyone to
condemn an entire student body.
There are too many people who make disparaging
statements which are unwarranted by their knowl
edge of the subject. Destructive criticism has rarely
been of use to anyone. If Mr. Nasatir feels that the
Stanford student body is "out of it," an assumption
which I think rests on a weak foundation (in so far as
is indicated by his letter), why doesn't he propose
some constructive program to get the Indians "back
in the groove?"
And if upon further inspection it is found that we
are "out of it," all 7000 of us, the prophets of doom
will have a valid point in saying that the future status
of the American citizenry is dark.
