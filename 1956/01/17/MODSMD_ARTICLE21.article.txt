# RESPECTABILITY LOSES
## 'All That Heaven Allows': Story of Social Pressures 
### RICHARD MENDE 
Respectability takes quite a drubbing in the two pictures now
being shown at the Stanford, "All That Heaven Allows" and"The
Naked Dawn." v
Jane Wyman, a wealthy widow in a provincial community/
wants to marry her gardener, Rock Hudson. You can imagine

what a rumpus, is raised by those
Cole Porter referred to as "the bot
tom of the upper crust."
But the picture has its moments
as Miss Wyman is forced to examine
the reactions to such a marriage by

the social set, her
c'h ildr en, her
friends and finally
her primly condi
tioned self.
Beside a certain
aura of soap suds,
two points espe-

cially bothered me. First, it seemed
implausible that there could tee a
serious relationship between a mid
dle-aged, plain-looking widow and
a handsome young gardener. It
seemed that Mi s Wy.nan, as her
doctor suggested, was "ready for a
love affair hut not for love," or, as
her son more curtly put it, t he was
after a handsome "set of muscles";
but I didn't follow a whole lot of the
talk too closely.
Secondly, Rock Hudson is the first
person I've heard of who asserts his
independence by becoming a two
fisted horticulturist.
Anyway, the alternative tq aban
doning tihe "social" community turns
out not to be love in banishment—
they agree early in the picture that
loVe is not enough—but to join the
community of independent souls,
which includes bird lovers, literati,
refugees and (to make the fate really
respectable) a Walden-reading ex
urbanite.
It might have been a more deeply
etched portrait if there was some
thing more at stake than a little
snobbery.
The color in the film was effec
tively used in several scenes espe
cially to suggest the physical com
forts of middle-class living.
The second picture at the Stan
ford, "The Naked Dawn," deals with
approximately the same social equi
valents south of the horder although
they're slightly less wealthy and
considerably more nasty.
The story is a good one, unpre
tentious and neatly told. I didn't
detect an "ameego" in the script and
Arthur Kennedy's acting was credit
able.
There is also a lissome wench in
there, Betta St. John, who doesn't
act especially well, but then one
doesn't demand overly much of lis
some wenohes.

It might have been a more deeply
etched portrait if there was some
thing more at stake than a little
snobbery.
The color in the film was effec
tively used in several scenes espe
cially to suggest the physical com
forts of middle-class living.
The second picture at the Stan
ford, "The Naked Dawn," deals with
approximately the same social equi
valents south of the horder although
they're slightly less wealthy and
considerably more nasty.
The story is a good one, unpre
tentious and neatly told. I didn't
detect an "ameego" in the script and
Arthur Kennedy's acting was credit
able.
There is also a lissome wench in
there, Betta St. John, who doesn't
act especially well, but then one
doesn't demand overly much of lis
some wenohes.

Respectability takes quite a drubbing in the two pictures now
being shown at the Stanford, "All That Heaven Allows" and"The
Naked Dawn." v
Jane Wyman, a wealthy widow in a provincial community/
wants to marry her gardener, Rock Hudson. You can imagine

what a rumpus, is raised by those
Cole Porter referred to as "the bot
tom of the upper crust."
But the picture has its moments
as Miss Wyman is forced to examine
the reactions to such a marriage by

the social set, her
c'h ildr en, her
friends and finally
her primly condi
tioned self.
Beside a certain
aura of soap suds,
two points espe-

cially bothered me. First, it seemed
implausible that there could tee a
serious relationship between a mid
dle-aged, plain-looking widow and
a handsome young gardener. It
seemed that Mi s Wy.nan, as her
doctor suggested, was "ready for a
love affair hut not for love," or, as
her son more curtly put it, t he was
after a handsome "set of muscles";
but I didn't follow a whole lot of the
talk too closely.
Secondly, Rock Hudson is the first
person I've heard of who asserts his
independence by becoming a two
fisted horticulturist.
Anyway, the alternative tq aban
doning tihe "social" community turns
out not to be love in banishment—
they agree early in the picture that
loVe is not enough—but to join the
community of independent souls,
which includes bird lovers, literati,
refugees and (to make the fate really
respectable) a Walden-reading ex
urbanite.
