### JIM PRICE 
Stanford's Braves parlayed a red-hot second half to a 71-59
victory over the Moifett Field Flyers Saturday after the Braves
had been downed Friday by the Fort Ord Warriors, 66 55.
After trailing, 31-30, at half time in the Moffett Field contest, the
Braves hit a hot streak five minutes into the second half and tallied

20 points in eight minutes to only*
two for the Flyers. Sparking this I
drive was guard Dave Dunn, who
steored 10 of thr 20 points. At the j
same time the Flyers also hit a
cold streak during which they tallied !
only one field goal in 13 minutes.
High scorer for the game was for- |
ward Fete Mansfield, who sparked
the Braves in the first half with 12
of his 16 points. Dunn followed with
a total of 15.
The key to the Braves' second-hall
success was their control of both the
offensive and defensive backboards.
DUNN REBOUNDS
Throughout Moffett Field's field
goal famine, guards Dunn and Jerry
Rose were snatching the rebounds
after the first Moffett Field try at the
(bucket. As it turned out, the Flyers
couldn't get the ball back until the
Braves scored.
The previous afternoon the Braves
didn't have quite as much success as
the tall Fort Ord Warriors ground
out a 66-55 victory.
This was a sloppily-played contest
marked by frequent trips to the free
throw line. Center Joe Kohler paced
the Fort Ord attack by registering
18 points.
Though the intermission score had
been only 24-16 in favor of the sol- '

| diers, it 'began to look as if that many
! points were going -to be scored in the
| first six or seven minutes of the
! second chapter.
POINT FOR POINT
| The two teams traded point' for
i point at the ttart, and the tempo j
j kept right on increasing until the
] Warriors stuffed in five field goals
in two minutes to take a command
ing twelve-point lead at 41-29.
With three minutes to go, the
Braves pulled within six points of
the Warriors on a hook by Eric An
derson, but guard Billy Sheng hit
two quick lay-ins to push the game
out of the Braves' reach.
