# Stanford Campus Escapes from Storm With Only Minor Damages Reported
## 
### 
With fair weather forecast again
for today, California's second flood
crisis in as many months appeared to
be waning with only minor effects
on the Stanford campus.
Heavy rains which fell on the
campus all last weekend did no ap
preciable damage according to the
University office of buildings and
grounds.
Trees fell, roofs leaked and roads
were torn up. That was the familiar
report given by the office, as the
road repair crew began its usual job

of filling chuck holes in the Stanford
roads.
A rise in the water level at Lake
Lagunita was reported also despite
the leaking dikes.
Paint shop foreman Lee C. Webb
reported seeing two boys trying to
canoe down the creek to the lake
Sunday afternoon. He said that the
boat capsized almost causing one to
drown. Both boys, after consider
able trouble, were able to make it
to the shore.
Water collected along the edge of
El Camino in the field between Palm
Drive and Embarcadero, and one
lane of the highway was closed for
a period.
Over on Escondido there was a
river of water flowing down to Stan
ford Avenue which was awash from
curb to curb in spots. The water was
collecting in the Wilbur parking lot
and draining onto the road.
The rains also resoaked the Stan
ford golf coux-se, which has been un
playable since the late December
storms, and the drying out of the
greens must start again.
The latest storm, which threatened
for a time to repeat the Christmas
week disaster, left four persons dead
and two missing and caused re
evacuation of several thousands of
residents in the flood areas in North
ern California.
The main trouble spot remaining
was at Yuba City where a soggy,
patched-up levee groaned under the

weight of a 67-foot crest on the
Feather River.
In the San Francisco Bay area
considerable damage was reported
because of overflowing creeks and
storm sewers backed up by high
tide. Worst damage occurred in the
seacoast town of Bolinas in Marin
County where slides carried away
at least four houses and the town's
main streets were under a foot of
muddy ooze.
