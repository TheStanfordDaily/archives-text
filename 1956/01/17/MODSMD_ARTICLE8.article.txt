# P.A. Council Shows Concern Over Sharing Hospital Costs
## 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Palo Alto City Council last night expressed concern over
their share of expenses in the new Palo Alto Hospi'al. They are
to opeiate it jointly with the University Medical School.
Councilman Burt L. Davis noted that staffs of the University and
the city will be competing with each ether for money to be spent

on medical services, saying:
"Their (Stanford's] operation, by
the very fact that it involves re
search and teaching, will be more
expensive than the usual operation."
He said that the existing contract
between the two parties is good be
cause it has a clause saying that
whenever the City Council doesn't
approve of the way Stanford is oper
ating the hospital it can take it out
of University hands with 30 days'
notice.
"But when the two are enmeshed
in the ne\4' joint hospital they will
be married for 99 years," Davis com
mented.
Davis called for immediate medi
ation of any misunderstandings be
tween University medical adminis
trators and Palo Alto Hospital offi
cials.
He made his comments after coun
cilman J. P. Mitchell had made a
report on hospital progress. Mitchell
said there was "real progress,"
noting that the architects were al
most finished with their preliminary
details and are "right on schedule."
He reported the Palo Alto side of
the hospital should be completed in
of that of Stanford. He said
the University has cooperated great
ly with the city and has been per
fectly willing to discuss any prob
lems.
Main points of discussion, Mitchell
noted, are efforts at nonduplieation
of expensive and not - often - used
equipment which both parties can
ure.
Mayor Noel E. Porter has ap
pointed a Council committee to study
this problem, with the help of a
doctor's group, and another one to
look into methods of joint account
ing.
These are the problems on which
Davis called for immediate action.
He pointed out that when the usual
business partnership is formed, the
parties firs.it set down spheres of ac
tion, get their money, erect their
building, then bring in their "mer
chandise."
He said the method used in the
new hospital is just the opposite, "a
good reason for immediate settling
of any differences."
"We must protect our income.
That's why we insist on the council
committees," Mitchell said.
Councilman Stanley Bishop said,
"If the hospital goes in the red, Palo
Alto will pay the bill."
