<, i H ihcy had laid the deep founda

next 27, was to raise Stanford to iin
peri liable heights.
He was born in the little town of
Ib .ro, lowa, on April 13, 1875.
At to a",e of eight he and his family
n iov■ d to Jamestown, N.D. They
kit- r moved to Riverside, Calif.
Upon reaching the age of 17 he
MMtie ilie choice of the university he
<1 to attend. He chose Stan
!oi 1 "because it had no ivy on the
' walls.''
: infoi d was only in its second
iv m u Wilbur arrived in the
fall of 1802.
I AW URGED
'■.though Wilbur was a student
i'.-ine at Stanford, he had the
'I of making a great lawyer.
An Ariz >na lawyer had taken a keen
nil t in his future and urged his
going into law.
WUbur wroto his physiology pro-
I' * for advice. The professor
v ' 11 back that he considered Wil
bur one of his best students and
ir 1 ' - in circumstances was Wilbur
10 le :v medicine until he had con
sulted with him.
Ii 'hi the grading system of that
<i a student either passed or failed
1 W. ! ur .-aid "for all I knew I
was iu t another student." So it
was medicine for Wilbur from that
day on.
A; in undergraduate he was a
r of the "Barbarians," a po
:! party which, according to Dr.
s M. Williams of the class of
"!i7. "n aially landed any student of-
I: • which it considered worthy of
it attention." Wilbur was elected
! of his senior class (1896).
\t graduation in the spring Wil
i ctived the A.B. degree, and
i A VI. degree the following year.
lI'D TRAINING
In the autumn of 1896 he started
mr dical training at the Cooper
r a I r>| lege in San Francisco
i In become the Stanford Medi
ci I School).
V ludcmt named Herbert Hoover,
- i l l a' hi. way through Stanford
a, a ale,man for a laundry service,
■■■ i il by Wilbur's room in Encina
it' day to get some business. The
-Indents soon became good
ii n n i and leaders of the "Barbs."
While working at Cooper, Wilbur
11 M;i l aueri'te May Black, whom
m.ir' <•<! on Dec. 5, 1898. During
I icir 18 vcars of marriage bhey had
l v children. Mrs. Wilbur died on
•ma Eve in 1946 at their cam
pii; lr in on Gerona Road.
V! his graduation from Cooper
: I ;School in 1899, Wilbur be
< r. a lccturcr and demonstrator
I'l'.v icflogy there. The following
•.ii" he became an assistant profes
>r of p-y. iology at Stanford.
T I'HOII) EPIDEMIC
!'•• 1 '*03 he dropped his teaching
al Stafford to combat a desperate
< , 1 •■••mic of typhoid fever in the Bay
Area.
I r the epidemic Wilbur went,
ro if t'» .study. He was a student
mediicne at Frankfurt-on-Main
. ii 'i London before returning t.o take
i"i priva te practice in Palo Alto in
1905.
V. ian loft his Palo Alto practice
after three years to become a pro
)i • r id medicine at Stanford. And
i l'!/9 11f* went lf> Europe again to
. ■■ this time to Munich.
(J;i his relturn he became the dean
el t (if • Stanford Medical School.
moiT hi outstanding contributions
(I'ian was the establisihmenit of
in lime clinical instruction in

preference to the old method of clin
ical instruction by physicians.
In 1915, University President John
Casper Branner reached the retire
ment age of 65 and the Board of
Trustees began looking for his re
placement.
TWO CAMPS
Ralph Arnold, former roommate
of Wilbur's at Encina and member
of the Board of Trustees at this time,
said: "When it came to choosing a
successor to Dr. Branner, the Board
soon lined up in two camps, one
favoring the election of a Princeton
professor of Greek and the other
favoring the election of Ray."
Arnold Listed Timothy Hopkins,
Herbert Hoover and himself as "the
wtheelihorses in the Wilbur camp."
On Jan. 1, 1916, Ray Lyman Wil
bur became the third president of
Lclatid Stanford Junior University.
Ho was the first alumnus to hold the
office. *
When Wilbur came into office the
men in the student body were in
clined to stand "a little aloof and
watch him." They were a little sus
picious of him as a faculty man who
had the reputation of being intense
ly in earnest with regard to college
work and not too "sympathetic with
college foolishness."
During his term as president he
did not lose that reputation, but he
gained another—that of being direct
with them and able to produce re
sults in a marvelously brief time.
WARNS STUDENTS
Wilbur accomplished this when he
gave them unmistakable warning
that he was not satisfied with some
matters of student government, and
he said that "unless some of these
arc improved, the whole of student
control is in jeopardy."
"If student control Ls to succeed,"
he said, "all its units mii'-t be equal
and the elected leaders must be fol
lowed and honored."
He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

think we could have developed a
Hoover by any such bootlicking sys
tem as we have approached at Stan
ford, by making him coniform to a
sophomore idea of the typical Stan
ford man? You can't make Hoovers
that way!"
QUARTER SYSTEM
It was under Wilbur's administra
tion in 1917 that the semester system
was abandoned and the present-day
quarter system put into operation.
In 1920 a tuition fee was charged
for the firat. time at Stanford. Tuition
then was $40 peq quarter. Wilbur
was the proponent of the tuition fee
as a means of obtaining needed rev
enue in spite of warnings that en
rollment would drop. But enrollment
did not drop; in fact, between 1915
and 1928 it doubled. There were 4677
students enrolled in the University
in 1928.
The Lower Division was estab
lished in 1920. Departments were or
ganized into schools. The schools of
Education, Law, Social Science, Bio
logical Sciences, Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business were
established during his term as presi
dent.
Wilbur left the Stanford campus
for extended periods only twice after
he became de a n of the medical
school in 1911—ibot.h times to serve
hLs country.
DECORATIONS
The first time was during World
War I when he served as chief of
the Conservation Division of the
U. S. Food Administration. For this
work the governments of Belgium
and France decorated him.
He left the University for the sec
ond time in 1929 to become Secre
tary of the Interior at the request
of his old schoolmate, Herbert Hoo
ver.
Wilbur's two great themes as Sec
retary of the Interior were the trans
formation of the department into a
Department of Conservation and the
preservation of local self - govern
ment.
The building of Hoover Dam was
made possible by his interpretation
of the Federal Power Act.
During Wilbur's absence, Robert
E. Swain of the class of '99 acted as
president. But in spite of being in
Washington, D. C., Wilbur played
the leading rode in the lifting of the
registration limit on women from
500.
When the "Immortal 21" regained
the Stanford Axe in 1931, Wilbur
sent a telegram to the acting presi
dent and the student body express
ing his "hearty pleasure."
RESUMED DUTIES
Wilbur resumed his activities as
active president of the University in
1933.
Ho was said to have had "more
degrees than a thermometer." This
is proven by the fact that 20 univer
sities and colleges awarded him hon
orary degrees. Eighteen of the latter
were the LL.D. degree.
His favorite outdoor pastime was
fishing. Although he learned of many
fishing grounds in the country while
Secretary of the Interior, his favorite
was a secluded camp in the Siskiyou
Mountains in northern California.
He made annual treks there with
close friends.
He* once wrote to a friend when
Stanford was monopolizing the Rose
Bowl that "my time has been largely
taken up with the Five Big F'k—
Finance, Faculty, Football, Freedom
and Fish. I think I have had the
mo t satisfaction with the fish."
A group of prominent citizens,
Congressmen and Government offi
cials were assembled at the entrance
of Lassen National Park, in Califor
nia, one day in the early 1930's to
meet the Secretary of the Interior
and ask for "more roads and facili
ties."
Everyone was watching for a mo
torcycle escort that normally would
accompany a sleek, luxurious car of
a Cabinet officer who was a close
personal friend of the President.
LET'S FISH
Instead Wilbur drove up in an old,
weather-beaten Buick sedan full of
boys and camping equipment. He
jumped out of the car and turned
to the Congressman standing nearest
to him and said, "Let's get the
luncheon and the speech over with,
so the boys and I can got to fishing."
In 1940, when Wilbur reached the
University retirement age of 65, the
Board of Trustees appointed him
chancellor, but at their request he
carried on as acting president..
He presided over the 50th anni
versary of Stanford in 1941 when the
Hoover Library was dedicated.
MOVES TO HOOVER
On Sept. J, 1943, after his succes
sor had been chosen, Wilbur vacated
his office on the Quad and moved
"his books and papers, his miniature
totem poles and the stuffed owl that
had been presented lo him by a stu
dent' to an office on the 11th floor
of Hoover Tower.
When Wilbur retired from the
presidency of Stanford, Hoover
wrote him, "It has been a grand job
you have done and I welcome you
to the Ex-Presidents' Club."
In hLs office across the hall from
Hoover's, Wilbur continued to domi
nate S I a n for d administration as
chancellor of the University.
On June 26, 1949, Wilbur died of
a coronary occlusion at the age of
74 at his campus residence on Ger- j
ona Road. The attack culminated a |
series of heart attacks.

man whose reflection is seen in the mirror was a stu
dent visitor to the room as the picture was being taken.

decoration taken from the eaves of Quad following a
Senior Day celebration. This photograph was found
in 1949 in an old Stanford Quad.

he said, "all its units mii'-t be equal
and the elected leaders must be fol
lowed and honored."
He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

think we could have developed a
Hoover by any such bootlicking sys
tem as we have approached at Stan
ford, by making him coniform to a
sophomore idea of the typical Stan
ford man? You can't make Hoovers
that way!"
QUARTER SYSTEM
It was under Wilbur's administra
tion in 1917 that the semester system
was abandoned and the present-day
quarter system put into operation.
In 1920 a tuition fee was charged
for the firat. time at Stanford. Tuition
then was $40 peq quarter. Wilbur
was the proponent of the tuition fee
as a means of obtaining needed rev
enue in spite of warnings that en
rollment would drop. But enrollment
did not drop; in fact, between 1915
and 1928 it doubled. There were 4677
students enrolled in the University
in 1928.
The Lower Division was estab
lished in 1920. Departments were or
ganized into schools. The schools of
Education, Law, Social Science, Bio
logical Sciences, Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business were
established during his term as presi
dent.
Wilbur left the Stanford campus
for extended periods only twice after
he became de a n of the medical
school in 1911—ibot.h times to serve
hLs country.
DECORATIONS
The first time was during World
War I when he served as chief of
the Conservation Division of the
U. S. Food Administration. For this
work the governments of Belgium
and France decorated him.
He left the University for the sec
ond time in 1929 to become Secre
tary of the Interior at the request
of his old schoolmate, Herbert Hoo
ver.
Wilbur's two great themes as Sec
retary of the Interior were the trans
formation of the department into a
Department of Conservation and the
preservation of local self - govern
ment.
The building of Hoover Dam was
made possible by his interpretation
of the Federal Power Act.
During Wilbur's absence, Robert
E. Swain of the class of '99 acted as
president. But in spite of being in
Washington, D. C., Wilbur played
the leading rode in the lifting of the
registration limit on women from
500.
When the "Immortal 21" regained
the Stanford Axe in 1931, Wilbur
sent a telegram to the acting presi
dent and the student body express
ing his "hearty pleasure."
RESUMED DUTIES
Wilbur resumed his activities as
active president of the University in
1933.
Ho was said to have had "more
degrees than a thermometer." This
is proven by the fact that 20 univer
sities and colleges awarded him hon
orary degrees. Eighteen of the latter
were the LL.D. degree.
His favorite outdoor pastime was
fishing. Although he learned of many
fishing grounds in the country while
Secretary of the Interior, his favorite
was a secluded camp in the Siskiyou
Mountains in northern California.
He made annual treks there with
close friends.
He* once wrote to a friend when
Stanford was monopolizing the Rose
Bowl that "my time has been largely
taken up with the Five Big F'k—
Finance, Faculty, Football, Freedom
and Fish. I think I have had the
mo t satisfaction with the fish."
A group of prominent citizens,
Congressmen and Government offi
cials were assembled at the entrance
of Lassen National Park, in Califor
nia, one day in the early 1930's to
meet the Secretary of the Interior
and ask for "more roads and facili
ties."
Everyone was watching for a mo
torcycle escort that normally would
accompany a sleek, luxurious car of
a Cabinet officer who was a close
personal friend of the President.
LET'S FISH
Instead Wilbur drove up in an old,
weather-beaten Buick sedan full of
boys and camping equipment. He
jumped out of the car and turned
to the Congressman standing nearest
to him and said, "Let's get the
luncheon and the speech over with,
so the boys and I can got to fishing."
In 1940, when Wilbur reached the
University retirement age of 65, the
Board of Trustees appointed him
chancellor, but at their request he
carried on as acting president..
He presided over the 50th anni
versary of Stanford in 1941 when the
Hoover Library was dedicated.
MOVES TO HOOVER
On Sept. J, 1943, after his succes
sor had been chosen, Wilbur vacated
his office on the Quad and moved
"his books and papers, his miniature
totem poles and the stuffed owl that
had been presented lo him by a stu
dent' to an office on the 11th floor
of Hoover Tower.
When Wilbur retired from the
presidency of Stanford, Hoover
wrote him, "It has been a grand job
you have done and I welcome you
to the Ex-Presidents' Club."
In hLs office across the hall from
Hoover's, Wilbur continued to domi
nate S I a n for d administration as
chancellor of the University.
On June 26, 1949, Wilbur died of
a coronary occlusion at the age of
74 at his campus residence on Ger- j
ona Road. The attack culminated a |
series of heart attacks.

; the University's first 25
<, i H ihcy had laid the deep founda
t i' iii ; upon which Wilbur, in the
next 27, was to raise Stanford to iin
peri liable heights.
He was born in the little town of
Ib .ro, lowa, on April 13, 1875.
At to a",e of eight he and his family
n iov■ d to Jamestown, N.D. They
kit- r moved to Riverside, Calif.
Upon reaching the age of 17 he
MMtie ilie choice of the university he
<1 to attend. He chose Stan
!oi 1 "because it had no ivy on the
' walls.''
: infoi d was only in its second
iv m u Wilbur arrived in the
fall of 1802.
I AW URGED
'■.though Wilbur was a student
i'.-ine at Stanford, he had the
'I of making a great lawyer.
An Ariz >na lawyer had taken a keen
nil t in his future and urged his
going into law.
WUbur wroto his physiology pro-
I' * for advice. The professor

bur one of his best students and
ir 1 ' - in circumstances was Wilbur
10 le :v medicine until he had con
sulted with him.
Ii 'hi the grading system of that
<i a student either passed or failed
1 W. ! ur .-aid "for all I knew I
was iu t another student." So it
was medicine for Wilbur from that
day on.
A; in undergraduate he was a
r of the "Barbarians," a po
:! party which, according to Dr.
s M. Williams of the class of
"!i7. "n aially landed any student of-
I: • which it considered worthy of
it attention." Wilbur was elected
! of his senior class (1896).
\t graduation in the spring Wil
i ctived the A.B. degree, and
i A VI. degree the following year.
lI'D TRAINING
In the autumn of 1896 he started
mr dical training at the Cooper
r a I r>| lege in San Francisco

ci I School).
V ludcmt named Herbert Hoover,

a, a ale,man for a laundry service,

ii n n i and leaders of the "Barbs."

m.ir' <•<! on Dec. 5, 1898. During
I icir 18 vcars of marriage bhey had
l v children. Mrs. Wilbur died on

< r. a lccturcr and demonstrator

>r of p-y. iology at Stanford.
T I'HOII) EPIDEMIC
!'•• 1 '*03 he dropped his teaching
al Stafford to combat a desperate
< , 1 •■••mic of typhoid fever in the Bay
Area.
I r the epidemic Wilbur went,
ro if t'» .study. He was a student
mediicne at Frankfurt-on-Main
. ii 'i London before returning t.o take
i"i priva te practice in Palo Alto in
1905.
V. ian loft his Palo Alto practice
after three years to become a pro
)i • r id medicine at Stanford. And
i l'!/9 11f* went lf> Europe again to
. ■■ this time to Munich.
(J;i his relturn he became the dean
el t (if • Stanford Medical School.
moiT hi outstanding contributions
(I'ian was the establisihmenit of
in lime clinical instruction in

preference to the old method of clin
ical instruction by physicians.
In 1915, University President John
Casper Branner reached the retire
ment age of 65 and the Board of
Trustees began looking for his re
placement.
TWO CAMPS
Ralph Arnold, former roommate
of Wilbur's at Encina and member
of the Board of Trustees at this time,
said: "When it came to choosing a
successor to Dr. Branner, the Board
soon lined up in two camps, one
favoring the election of a Princeton
professor of Greek and the other
favoring the election of Ray."
Arnold Listed Timothy Hopkins,
Herbert Hoover and himself as "the
wtheelihorses in the Wilbur camp."
On Jan. 1, 1916, Ray Lyman Wil
bur became the third president of
Lclatid Stanford Junior University.
Ho was the first alumnus to hold the
office. *
When Wilbur came into office the
men in the student body were in
clined to stand "a little aloof and
watch him." They were a little sus
picious of him as a faculty man who
had the reputation of being intense
ly in earnest with regard to college
work and not too "sympathetic with
college foolishness."
During his term as president he
did not lose that reputation, but he
gained another—that of being direct
with them and able to produce re
sults in a marvelously brief time.
WARNS STUDENTS
Wilbur accomplished this when he
gave them unmistakable warning
that he was not satisfied with some
matters of student government, and
he said that "unless some of these
arc improved, the whole of student
control is in jeopardy."
"If student control Ls to succeed,"
he said, "all its units mii'-t be equal
and the elected leaders must be fol
lowed and honored."
He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

; the University's first 25
<, i H ihcy had laid the deep founda
t i' iii ; upon which Wilbur, in the
next 27, was to raise Stanford to iin
peri liable heights.
He was born in the little town of
Ib .ro, lowa, on April 13, 1875.
At to a",e of eight he and his family
n iov■ d to Jamestown, N.D. They
kit- r moved to Riverside, Calif.
Upon reaching the age of 17 he
MMtie ilie choice of the university he
<1 to attend. He chose Stan
!oi 1 "because it had no ivy on the
' walls.''
: infoi d was only in its second
iv m u Wilbur arrived in the
fall of 1802.
I AW URGED
'■.though Wilbur was a student
i'.-ine at Stanford, he had the
'I of making a great lawyer.
An Ariz >na lawyer had taken a keen
nil t in his future and urged his
going into law.
WUbur wroto his physiology pro-
I' * for advice. The professor
v ' 11 back that he considered Wil
bur one of his best students and
ir 1 ' - in circumstances was Wilbur
10 le :v medicine until he had con
sulted with him.
Ii 'hi the grading system of that
<i a student either passed or failed
1 W. ! ur .-aid "for all I knew I
was iu t another student." So it
was medicine for Wilbur from that
day on.
A; in undergraduate he was a
r of the "Barbarians," a po
:! party which, according to Dr.
s M. Williams of the class of
"!i7. "n aially landed any student of-
I: • which it considered worthy of
it attention." Wilbur was elected
! of his senior class (1896).
\t graduation in the spring Wil
i ctived the A.B. degree, and
i A VI. degree the following year.
lI'D TRAINING
In the autumn of 1896 he started
mr dical training at the Cooper
r a I r>| lege in San Francisco
i In become the Stanford Medi
ci I School).
V ludcmt named Herbert Hoover,
- i l l a' hi. way through Stanford
a, a ale,man for a laundry service,
■■■ i il by Wilbur's room in Encina
it' day to get some business. The
-Indents soon became good
ii n n i and leaders of the "Barbs."
While working at Cooper, Wilbur
11 M;i l aueri'te May Black, whom
m.ir' <•<! on Dec. 5, 1898. During
I icir 18 vcars of marriage bhey had
l v children. Mrs. Wilbur died on
•ma Eve in 1946 at their cam
pii; lr in on Gerona Road.
V! his graduation from Cooper
: I ;School in 1899, Wilbur be
< r. a lccturcr and demonstrator
I'l'.v icflogy there. The following
•.ii" he became an assistant profes
>r of p-y. iology at Stanford.
T I'HOII) EPIDEMIC
!'•• 1 '*03 he dropped his teaching
al Stafford to combat a desperate
< , 1 •■••mic of typhoid fever in the Bay
Area.
I r the epidemic Wilbur went,
ro if t'» .study. He was a student
mediicne at Frankfurt-on-Main
. ii 'i London before returning t.o take
i"i priva te practice in Palo Alto in
1905.
V. ian loft his Palo Alto practice
after three years to become a pro
)i • r id medicine at Stanford. And
i l'!/9 11f* went lf> Europe again to
. ■■ this time to Munich.
(J;i his relturn he became the dean
el t (if • Stanford Medical School.
moiT hi outstanding contributions
(I'ian was the establisihmenit of
in lime clinical instruction in

preference to the old method of clin
ical instruction by physicians.
In 1915, University President John
Casper Branner reached the retire
ment age of 65 and the Board of
Trustees began looking for his re
placement.
TWO CAMPS
Ralph Arnold, former roommate
of Wilbur's at Encina and member
of the Board of Trustees at this time,
said: "When it came to choosing a
successor to Dr. Branner, the Board
soon lined up in two camps, one
favoring the election of a Princeton
professor of Greek and the other
favoring the election of Ray."
Arnold Listed Timothy Hopkins,
Herbert Hoover and himself as "the
wtheelihorses in the Wilbur camp."
On Jan. 1, 1916, Ray Lyman Wil
bur became the third president of
Lclatid Stanford Junior University.
Ho was the first alumnus to hold the
office. *
When Wilbur came into office the
men in the student body were in
clined to stand "a little aloof and
watch him." They were a little sus
picious of him as a faculty man who
had the reputation of being intense
ly in earnest with regard to college
work and not too "sympathetic with
college foolishness."
During his term as president he
did not lose that reputation, but he
gained another—that of being direct
with them and able to produce re
sults in a marvelously brief time.
WARNS STUDENTS
Wilbur accomplished this when he
gave them unmistakable warning
that he was not satisfied with some
matters of student government, and
he said that "unless some of these
arc improved, the whole of student
control is in jeopardy."
"If student control Ls to succeed,"
he said, "all its units mii'-t be equal
and the elected leaders must be fol
lowed and honored."
He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

think we could have developed a
Hoover by any such bootlicking sys
tem as we have approached at Stan
ford, by making him coniform to a
sophomore idea of the typical Stan
ford man? You can't make Hoovers
that way!"
QUARTER SYSTEM
It was under Wilbur's administra
tion in 1917 that the semester system
was abandoned and the present-day
quarter system put into operation.
In 1920 a tuition fee was charged
for the firat. time at Stanford. Tuition
then was $40 peq quarter. Wilbur
was the proponent of the tuition fee
as a means of obtaining needed rev
enue in spite of warnings that en
rollment would drop. But enrollment
did not drop; in fact, between 1915
and 1928 it doubled. There were 4677
students enrolled in the University
in 1928.
The Lower Division was estab
lished in 1920. Departments were or
ganized into schools. The schools of
Education, Law, Social Science, Bio
logical Sciences, Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business were
established during his term as presi
dent.
Wilbur left the Stanford campus
for extended periods only twice after
he became de a n of the medical
school in 1911—ibot.h times to serve
hLs country.
DECORATIONS
The first time was during World
War I when he served as chief of
the Conservation Division of the
U. S. Food Administration. For this
work the governments of Belgium
and France decorated him.
He left the University for the sec
ond time in 1929 to become Secre
tary of the Interior at the request
of his old schoolmate, Herbert Hoo
ver.
Wilbur's two great themes as Sec
retary of the Interior were the trans
formation of the department into a
Department of Conservation and the
preservation of local self - govern
ment.
The building of Hoover Dam was
made possible by his interpretation
of the Federal Power Act.
During Wilbur's absence, Robert
E. Swain of the class of '99 acted as
president. But in spite of being in
Washington, D. C., Wilbur played
the leading rode in the lifting of the
registration limit on women from
500.
When the "Immortal 21" regained
the Stanford Axe in 1931, Wilbur
sent a telegram to the acting presi
dent and the student body express
ing his "hearty pleasure."
RESUMED DUTIES
Wilbur resumed his activities as
active president of the University in
1933.
Ho was said to have had "more
degrees than a thermometer." This
is proven by the fact that 20 univer
sities and colleges awarded him hon
orary degrees. Eighteen of the latter
were the LL.D. degree.
His favorite outdoor pastime was
fishing. Although he learned of many
fishing grounds in the country while
Secretary of the Interior, his favorite
was a secluded camp in the Siskiyou
Mountains in northern California.
He made annual treks there with
close friends.
He* once wrote to a friend when
Stanford was monopolizing the Rose
Bowl that "my time has been largely
taken up with the Five Big F'k—
Finance, Faculty, Football, Freedom
and Fish. I think I have had the
mo t satisfaction with the fish."
A group of prominent citizens,
Congressmen and Government offi
cials were assembled at the entrance
of Lassen National Park, in Califor
nia, one day in the early 1930's to
meet the Secretary of the Interior
and ask for "more roads and facili
ties."
Everyone was watching for a mo
torcycle escort that normally would
accompany a sleek, luxurious car of
a Cabinet officer who was a close
personal friend of the President.
LET'S FISH
Instead Wilbur drove up in an old,
weather-beaten Buick sedan full of
boys and camping equipment. He
jumped out of the car and turned
to the Congressman standing nearest
to him and said, "Let's get the
luncheon and the speech over with,
so the boys and I can got to fishing."
In 1940, when Wilbur reached the
University retirement age of 65, the
Board of Trustees appointed him
chancellor, but at their request he
carried on as acting president..
He presided over the 50th anni
versary of Stanford in 1941 when the
Hoover Library was dedicated.
MOVES TO HOOVER
On Sept. J, 1943, after his succes
sor had been chosen, Wilbur vacated
his office on the Quad and moved
"his books and papers, his miniature
totem poles and the stuffed owl that
had been presented lo him by a stu
dent' to an office on the 11th floor
of Hoover Tower.
When Wilbur retired from the
presidency of Stanford, Hoover
wrote him, "It has been a grand job
you have done and I welcome you
to the Ex-Presidents' Club."
In hLs office across the hall from
Hoover's, Wilbur continued to domi
nate S I a n for d administration as
chancellor of the University.
On June 26, 1949, Wilbur died of
a coronary occlusion at the age of
74 at his campus residence on Ger- j
ona Road. The attack culminated a |
series of heart attacks.


ENCINA ROOM 80 (now 22(>) was occupied by Wilbur,

man whose reflection is seen in the mirror was a stu
dent visitor to the room as the picture was being taken.

The Japanese lantern hanging from (he ceiling was a
decoration taken from the eaves of Quad following a
Senior Day celebration. This photograph was found
in 1949 in an old Stanford Quad.

He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

think we could have developed a
Hoover by any such bootlicking sys
tem as we have approached at Stan
ford, by making him coniform to a
sophomore idea of the typical Stan
ford man? You can't make Hoovers
that way!"
QUARTER SYSTEM
It was under Wilbur's administra
tion in 1917 that the semester system
was abandoned and the present-day
quarter system put into operation.
In 1920 a tuition fee was charged
for the firat. time at Stanford. Tuition
then was $40 peq quarter. Wilbur
was the proponent of the tuition fee
as a means of obtaining needed rev
enue in spite of warnings that en
rollment would drop. But enrollment
did not drop; in fact, between 1915
and 1928 it doubled. There were 4677
students enrolled in the University
in 1928.
The Lower Division was estab
lished in 1920. Departments were or
ganized into schools. The schools of
Education, Law, Social Science, Bio
logical Sciences, Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business were
established during his term as presi
dent.
Wilbur left the Stanford campus
for extended periods only twice after
he became de a n of the medical
school in 1911—ibot.h times to serve
hLs country.
DECORATIONS
The first time was during World
War I when he served as chief of
the Conservation Division of the
U. S. Food Administration. For this
work the governments of Belgium
and France decorated him.
He left the University for the sec
ond time in 1929 to become Secre
tary of the Interior at the request
of his old schoolmate, Herbert Hoo
ver.
Wilbur's two great themes as Sec
retary of the Interior were the trans
formation of the department into a
Department of Conservation and the
preservation of local self - govern
ment.
The building of Hoover Dam was
made possible by his interpretation
of the Federal Power Act.
During Wilbur's absence, Robert
E. Swain of the class of '99 acted as
president. But in spite of being in
Washington, D. C., Wilbur played
the leading rode in the lifting of the
registration limit on women from
500.
When the "Immortal 21" regained
the Stanford Axe in 1931, Wilbur
sent a telegram to the acting presi
dent and the student body express
ing his "hearty pleasure."
RESUMED DUTIES
Wilbur resumed his activities as
active president of the University in
1933.
Ho was said to have had "more
degrees than a thermometer." This
is proven by the fact that 20 univer
sities and colleges awarded him hon
orary degrees. Eighteen of the latter
were the LL.D. degree.
His favorite outdoor pastime was
fishing. Although he learned of many
fishing grounds in the country while
Secretary of the Interior, his favorite
was a secluded camp in the Siskiyou
Mountains in northern California.
He made annual treks there with
close friends.
He* once wrote to a friend when
Stanford was monopolizing the Rose
Bowl that "my time has been largely
taken up with the Five Big F'k—
Finance, Faculty, Football, Freedom
and Fish. I think I have had the
mo t satisfaction with the fish."
A group of prominent citizens,
Congressmen and Government offi
cials were assembled at the entrance
of Lassen National Park, in Califor
nia, one day in the early 1930's to
meet the Secretary of the Interior
and ask for "more roads and facili
ties."
Everyone was watching for a mo
torcycle escort that normally would
accompany a sleek, luxurious car of
a Cabinet officer who was a close
personal friend of the President.
LET'S FISH
Instead Wilbur drove up in an old,
weather-beaten Buick sedan full of
boys and camping equipment. He
jumped out of the car and turned
to the Congressman standing nearest
to him and said, "Let's get the
luncheon and the speech over with,
so the boys and I can got to fishing."
In 1940, when Wilbur reached the
University retirement age of 65, the
Board of Trustees appointed him
chancellor, but at their request he
carried on as acting president..
He presided over the 50th anni
versary of Stanford in 1941 when the
Hoover Library was dedicated.
MOVES TO HOOVER
On Sept. J, 1943, after his succes
sor had been chosen, Wilbur vacated
his office on the Quad and moved
"his books and papers, his miniature
totem poles and the stuffed owl that
had been presented lo him by a stu
dent' to an office on the 11th floor
of Hoover Tower.
When Wilbur retired from the
presidency of Stanford, Hoover
wrote him, "It has been a grand job
you have done and I welcome you
to the Ex-Presidents' Club."
In hLs office across the hall from
Hoover's, Wilbur continued to domi
nate S I a n for d administration as
chancellor of the University.
On June 26, 1949, Wilbur died of
a coronary occlusion at the age of
74 at his campus residence on Ger- j
ona Road. The attack culminated a |
series of heart attacks.

; the University's first 25
<, i H ihcy had laid the deep founda
t i' iii ; upon which Wilbur, in the
next 27, was to raise Stanford to iin
peri liable heights.
He was born in the little town of
Ib .ro, lowa, on April 13, 1875.
At to a",e of eight he and his family
n iov■ d to Jamestown, N.D. They
kit- r moved to Riverside, Calif.
Upon reaching the age of 17 he
MMtie ilie choice of the university he
<1 to attend. He chose Stan
!oi 1 "because it had no ivy on the
' walls.''
: infoi d was only in its second
iv m u Wilbur arrived in the
fall of 1802.
I AW URGED
'■.though Wilbur was a student
i'.-ine at Stanford, he had the
'I of making a great lawyer.
An Ariz >na lawyer had taken a keen
nil t in his future and urged his
going into law.
WUbur wroto his physiology pro-
I' * for advice. The professor

bur one of his best students and
ir 1 ' - in circumstances was Wilbur
10 le :v medicine until he had con
sulted with him.
Ii 'hi the grading system of that
<i a student either passed or failed
1 W. ! ur .-aid "for all I knew I
was iu t another student." So it
was medicine for Wilbur from that
day on.
A; in undergraduate he was a
r of the "Barbarians," a po
:! party which, according to Dr.
s M. Williams of the class of
"!i7. "n aially landed any student of-
I: • which it considered worthy of
it attention." Wilbur was elected
! of his senior class (1896).
\t graduation in the spring Wil
i ctived the A.B. degree, and
i A VI. degree the following year.
lI'D TRAINING
In the autumn of 1896 he started
mr dical training at the Cooper
r a I r>| lege in San Francisco

ci I School).
V ludcmt named Herbert Hoover,

a, a ale,man for a laundry service,
■■■ i il by Wilbur's room in Encina
it' day to get some business. The

ii n n i and leaders of the "Barbs."

m.ir' <•<! on Dec. 5, 1898. During
I icir 18 vcars of marriage bhey had
l v children. Mrs. Wilbur died on

< r. a lccturcr and demonstrator

T I'HOII) EPIDEMIC
!'•• 1 '*03 he dropped his teaching
al Stafford to combat a desperate
< , 1 •■••mic of typhoid fever in the Bay
Area.
I r the epidemic Wilbur went,
ro if t'» .study. He was a student
mediicne at Frankfurt-on-Main
. ii 'i London before returning t.o take
i"i priva te practice in Palo Alto in
1905.
V. ian loft his Palo Alto practice
after three years to become a pro
)i • r id medicine at Stanford. And
i l'!/9 11f* went lf> Europe again to
. ■■ this time to Munich.
(J;i his relturn he became the dean
el t (if • Stanford Medical School.
moiT hi outstanding contributions
(I'ian was the establisihmenit of
in lime clinical instruction in

preference to the old method of clin
ical instruction by physicians.
In 1915, University President John
Casper Branner reached the retire
ment age of 65 and the Board of
Trustees began looking for his re
placement.
TWO CAMPS
Ralph Arnold, former roommate
of Wilbur's at Encina and member
of the Board of Trustees at this time,
said: "When it came to choosing a
successor to Dr. Branner, the Board
soon lined up in two camps, one
favoring the election of a Princeton
professor of Greek and the other
favoring the election of Ray."
Arnold Listed Timothy Hopkins,
Herbert Hoover and himself as "the
wtheelihorses in the Wilbur camp."
On Jan. 1, 1916, Ray Lyman Wil
bur became the third president of
Lclatid Stanford Junior University.
Ho was the first alumnus to hold the
office. *
When Wilbur came into office the
men in the student body were in
clined to stand "a little aloof and
watch him." They were a little sus
picious of him as a faculty man who
had the reputation of being intense
ly in earnest with regard to college
work and not too "sympathetic with
college foolishness."
During his term as president he
did not lose that reputation, but he
gained another—that of being direct
with them and able to produce re
sults in a marvelously brief time.
WARNS STUDENTS
Wilbur accomplished this when he
gave them unmistakable warning
that he was not satisfied with some
matters of student government, and
he said that "unless some of these
arc improved, the whole of student
control is in jeopardy."
"If student control Ls to succeed,"
he said, "all its units mii'-t be equal
and the elected leaders must be fol
lowed and honored."
He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a

own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

<, i H ihcy had laid the deep founda

next 27, was to raise Stanford to iin

He was born in the little town of
Ib .ro, lowa, on April 13, 1875.
At to a",e of eight he and his family
n iov■ d to Jamestown, N.D. They
kit- r moved to Riverside, Calif.
Upon reaching the age of 17 he
MMtie ilie choice of the university he

!oi 1 "because it had no ivy on the

: infoi d was only in its second
iv m u Wilbur arrived in the
fall of 1802.
I AW URGED
'■.though Wilbur was a student
i'.-ine at Stanford, he had the
'I of making a great lawyer.
An Ariz >na lawyer had taken a keen
nil t in his future and urged his
going into law.
WUbur wroto his physiology pro-

ir 1 ' - in circumstances was Wilbur
10 le :v medicine until he had con

Ii 'hi the grading system of that
<i a student either passed or failed
1 W. ! ur .-aid "for all I knew I
was iu t another student." So it
was medicine for Wilbur from that
day on.
A; in undergraduate he was a
r of the "Barbarians," a po
:! party which, according to Dr.
s M. Williams of the class of
"!i7. "n aially landed any student of-
I: • which it considered worthy of
it attention." Wilbur was elected
! of his senior class (1896).
\t graduation in the spring Wil
i ctived the A.B. degree, and
i A VI. degree the following year.
lI'D TRAINING
In the autumn of 1896 he started
mr dical training at the Cooper

ci I School).
V ludcmt named Herbert Hoover,

a, a ale,man for a laundry service,
■■■ i il by Wilbur's room in Encina
it' day to get some business. The
-Indents soon became good
ii n n i and leaders of the "Barbs."
While working at Cooper, Wilbur
11 M;i l aueri'te May Black, whom
m.ir' <•<! on Dec. 5, 1898. During
I icir 18 vcars of marriage bhey had
l v children. Mrs. Wilbur died on

pii; lr in on Gerona Road.
V! his graduation from Cooper
: I ;School in 1899, Wilbur be
< r. a lccturcr and demonstrator
I'l'.v icflogy there. The following
•.ii" he became an assistant profes
>r of p-y. iology at Stanford.
T I'HOII) EPIDEMIC
!'•• 1 '*03 he dropped his teaching
al Stafford to combat a desperate
< , 1 •■••mic of typhoid fever in the Bay
Area.
I r the epidemic Wilbur went,
ro if t'» .study. He was a student
mediicne at Frankfurt-on-Main
. ii 'i London before returning t.o take
i"i priva te practice in Palo Alto in
1905.
V. ian loft his Palo Alto practice
after three years to become a pro
)i • r id medicine at Stanford. And
i l'!/9 11f* went lf> Europe again to
. ■■ this time to Munich.
(J;i his relturn he became the dean
el t (if • Stanford Medical School.
moiT hi outstanding contributions
(I'ian was the establisihmenit of
in lime clinical instruction in

preference to the old method of clin
ical instruction by physicians.
In 1915, University President John
Casper Branner reached the retire
ment age of 65 and the Board of
Trustees began looking for his re
placement.
TWO CAMPS
Ralph Arnold, former roommate
of Wilbur's at Encina and member
of the Board of Trustees at this time,
said: "When it came to choosing a
successor to Dr. Branner, the Board
soon lined up in two camps, one
favoring the election of a Princeton
professor of Greek and the other
favoring the election of Ray."
Arnold Listed Timothy Hopkins,
Herbert Hoover and himself as "the
wtheelihorses in the Wilbur camp."
On Jan. 1, 1916, Ray Lyman Wil
bur became the third president of
Lclatid Stanford Junior University.
Ho was the first alumnus to hold the
office. *
When Wilbur came into office the
men in the student body were in
clined to stand "a little aloof and
watch him." They were a little sus
picious of him as a faculty man who
had the reputation of being intense
ly in earnest with regard to college
work and not too "sympathetic with
college foolishness."
During his term as president he
did not lose that reputation, but he
gained another—that of being direct
with them and able to produce re
sults in a marvelously brief time.
WARNS STUDENTS
Wilbur accomplished this when he
gave them unmistakable warning
that he was not satisfied with some
matters of student government, and
he said that "unless some of these
arc improved, the whole of student
control is in jeopardy."
"If student control Ls to succeed,"
he said, "all its units mii'-t be equal
and the elected leaders must be fol
lowed and honored."
He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

think we could have developed a
Hoover by any such bootlicking sys
tem as we have approached at Stan
ford, by making him coniform to a
sophomore idea of the typical Stan
ford man? You can't make Hoovers
that way!"
QUARTER SYSTEM
It was under Wilbur's administra
tion in 1917 that the semester system
was abandoned and the present-day
quarter system put into operation.
In 1920 a tuition fee was charged
for the firat. time at Stanford. Tuition
then was $40 peq quarter. Wilbur
was the proponent of the tuition fee
as a means of obtaining needed rev
enue in spite of warnings that en
rollment would drop. But enrollment
did not drop; in fact, between 1915
and 1928 it doubled. There were 4677
students enrolled in the University
in 1928.
The Lower Division was estab
lished in 1920. Departments were or
ganized into schools. The schools of
Education, Law, Social Science, Bio
logical Sciences, Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business were
established during his term as presi
dent.
Wilbur left the Stanford campus
for extended periods only twice after
he became de a n of the medical
school in 1911—ibot.h times to serve
hLs country.
DECORATIONS
The first time was during World
War I when he served as chief of
the Conservation Division of the
U. S. Food Administration. For this
work the governments of Belgium
and France decorated him.
He left the University for the sec
ond time in 1929 to become Secre
tary of the Interior at the request
of his old schoolmate, Herbert Hoo
ver.
Wilbur's two great themes as Sec
retary of the Interior were the trans
formation of the department into a
Department of Conservation and the
preservation of local self - govern
ment.
The building of Hoover Dam was
made possible by his interpretation
of the Federal Power Act.
During Wilbur's absence, Robert
E. Swain of the class of '99 acted as
president. But in spite of being in
Washington, D. C., Wilbur played
the leading rode in the lifting of the
registration limit on women from
500.
When the "Immortal 21" regained
the Stanford Axe in 1931, Wilbur
sent a telegram to the acting presi
dent and the student body express
ing his "hearty pleasure."
RESUMED DUTIES
Wilbur resumed his activities as
active president of the University in
1933.
Ho was said to have had "more
degrees than a thermometer." This
is proven by the fact that 20 univer
sities and colleges awarded him hon
orary degrees. Eighteen of the latter
were the LL.D. degree.
His favorite outdoor pastime was
fishing. Although he learned of many
fishing grounds in the country while
Secretary of the Interior, his favorite
was a secluded camp in the Siskiyou
Mountains in northern California.
He made annual treks there with
close friends.
He* once wrote to a friend when
Stanford was monopolizing the Rose
Bowl that "my time has been largely
taken up with the Five Big F'k—
Finance, Faculty, Football, Freedom
and Fish. I think I have had the
mo t satisfaction with the fish."
A group of prominent citizens,
Congressmen and Government offi
cials were assembled at the entrance
of Lassen National Park, in Califor
nia, one day in the early 1930's to
meet the Secretary of the Interior
and ask for "more roads and facili
ties."
Everyone was watching for a mo
torcycle escort that normally would
accompany a sleek, luxurious car of
a Cabinet officer who was a close
personal friend of the President.
LET'S FISH
Instead Wilbur drove up in an old,
weather-beaten Buick sedan full of
boys and camping equipment. He
jumped out of the car and turned
to the Congressman standing nearest
to him and said, "Let's get the
luncheon and the speech over with,
so the boys and I can got to fishing."
In 1940, when Wilbur reached the
University retirement age of 65, the
Board of Trustees appointed him
chancellor, but at their request he
carried on as acting president..
He presided over the 50th anni
versary of Stanford in 1941 when the
Hoover Library was dedicated.
MOVES TO HOOVER
On Sept. J, 1943, after his succes
sor had been chosen, Wilbur vacated
his office on the Quad and moved
"his books and papers, his miniature
totem poles and the stuffed owl that
had been presented lo him by a stu
dent' to an office on the 11th floor
of Hoover Tower.
When Wilbur retired from the
presidency of Stanford, Hoover
wrote him, "It has been a grand job
you have done and I welcome you
to the Ex-Presidents' Club."
In hLs office across the hall from
Hoover's, Wilbur continued to domi
nate S I a n for d administration as
chancellor of the University.
On June 26, 1949, Wilbur died of
a coronary occlusion at the age of
74 at his campus residence on Ger- j
ona Road. The attack culminated a |
series of heart attacks.

dent visitor to the room as the picture was being taken.

un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

think we could have developed a
Hoover by any such bootlicking sys
tem as we have approached at Stan
ford, by making him coniform to a
sophomore idea of the typical Stan
ford man? You can't make Hoovers
that way!"
QUARTER SYSTEM
It was under Wilbur's administra
tion in 1917 that the semester system
was abandoned and the present-day
quarter system put into operation.
In 1920 a tuition fee was charged
for the firat. time at Stanford. Tuition
then was $40 peq quarter. Wilbur
was the proponent of the tuition fee
as a means of obtaining needed rev
enue in spite of warnings that en
rollment would drop. But enrollment
did not drop; in fact, between 1915
and 1928 it doubled. There were 4677
students enrolled in the University
in 1928.
The Lower Division was estab
lished in 1920. Departments were or
ganized into schools. The schools of
Education, Law, Social Science, Bio
logical Sciences, Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business were
established during his term as presi
dent.
Wilbur left the Stanford campus
for extended periods only twice after
he became de a n of the medical
school in 1911—ibot.h times to serve
hLs country.
DECORATIONS
The first time was during World
War I when he served as chief of
the Conservation Division of the
U. S. Food Administration. For this
work the governments of Belgium
and France decorated him.
He left the University for the sec
ond time in 1929 to become Secre
tary of the Interior at the request
of his old schoolmate, Herbert Hoo
ver.
Wilbur's two great themes as Sec
retary of the Interior were the trans
formation of the department into a
Department of Conservation and the
preservation of local self - govern
ment.
The building of Hoover Dam was
made possible by his interpretation
of the Federal Power Act.
During Wilbur's absence, Robert
E. Swain of the class of '99 acted as
president. But in spite of being in
Washington, D. C., Wilbur played
the leading rode in the lifting of the
registration limit on women from
500.
When the "Immortal 21" regained
the Stanford Axe in 1931, Wilbur
sent a telegram to the acting presi
dent and the student body express
ing his "hearty pleasure."
RESUMED DUTIES
Wilbur resumed his activities as
active president of the University in
1933.
Ho was said to have had "more
degrees than a thermometer." This
is proven by the fact that 20 univer
sities and colleges awarded him hon
orary degrees. Eighteen of the latter
were the LL.D. degree.
His favorite outdoor pastime was
fishing. Although he learned of many
fishing grounds in the country while
Secretary of the Interior, his favorite
was a secluded camp in the Siskiyou
Mountains in northern California.
He made annual treks there with
close friends.
He* once wrote to a friend when
Stanford was monopolizing the Rose
Bowl that "my time has been largely
taken up with the Five Big F'k—
Finance, Faculty, Football, Freedom
and Fish. I think I have had the
mo t satisfaction with the fish."
A group of prominent citizens,
Congressmen and Government offi
cials were assembled at the entrance
of Lassen National Park, in Califor
nia, one day in the early 1930's to
meet the Secretary of the Interior
and ask for "more roads and facili
ties."
Everyone was watching for a mo
torcycle escort that normally would
accompany a sleek, luxurious car of
a Cabinet officer who was a close
personal friend of the President.
LET'S FISH
Instead Wilbur drove up in an old,
weather-beaten Buick sedan full of
boys and camping equipment. He
jumped out of the car and turned
to the Congressman standing nearest
to him and said, "Let's get the
luncheon and the speech over with,
so the boys and I can got to fishing."
In 1940, when Wilbur reached the
University retirement age of 65, the
Board of Trustees appointed him
chancellor, but at their request he
carried on as acting president..
He presided over the 50th anni
versary of Stanford in 1941 when the
Hoover Library was dedicated.
MOVES TO HOOVER
On Sept. J, 1943, after his succes
sor had been chosen, Wilbur vacated
his office on the Quad and moved
"his books and papers, his miniature
totem poles and the stuffed owl that
had been presented lo him by a stu
dent' to an office on the 11th floor
of Hoover Tower.
When Wilbur retired from the
presidency of Stanford, Hoover
wrote him, "It has been a grand job
you have done and I welcome you
to the Ex-Presidents' Club."
In hLs office across the hall from
Hoover's, Wilbur continued to domi
nate S I a n for d administration as
chancellor of the University.
On June 26, 1949, Wilbur died of
a coronary occlusion at the age of
74 at his campus residence on Ger- j
ona Road. The attack culminated a |
series of heart attacks.

; the University's first 25
<, i H ihcy had laid the deep founda
t i' iii ; upon which Wilbur, in the
next 27, was to raise Stanford to iin
peri liable heights.
He was born in the little town of
Ib .ro, lowa, on April 13, 1875.
At to a",e of eight he and his family
n iov■ d to Jamestown, N.D. They
kit- r moved to Riverside, Calif.
Upon reaching the age of 17 he
MMtie ilie choice of the university he
<1 to attend. He chose Stan
!oi 1 "because it had no ivy on the
' walls.''
: infoi d was only in its second
iv m u Wilbur arrived in the
fall of 1802.
I AW URGED
'■.though Wilbur was a student
i'.-ine at Stanford, he had the
'I of making a great lawyer.
An Ariz >na lawyer had taken a keen
nil t in his future and urged his
going into law.
WUbur wroto his physiology pro-
I' * for advice. The professor

bur one of his best students and
ir 1 ' - in circumstances was Wilbur
10 le :v medicine until he had con
sulted with him.
Ii 'hi the grading system of that
<i a student either passed or failed
1 W. ! ur .-aid "for all I knew I
was iu t another student." So it
was medicine for Wilbur from that
day on.
A; in undergraduate he was a
r of the "Barbarians," a po
:! party which, according to Dr.
s M. Williams of the class of
"!i7. "n aially landed any student of-
I: • which it considered worthy of
it attention." Wilbur was elected
! of his senior class (1896).
\t graduation in the spring Wil
i ctived the A.B. degree, and
i A VI. degree the following year.
lI'D TRAINING
In the autumn of 1896 he started
mr dical training at the Cooper
r a I r>| lege in San Francisco

ci I School).
V ludcmt named Herbert Hoover,

a, a ale,man for a laundry service,
■■■ i il by Wilbur's room in Encina
it' day to get some business. The
-Indents soon became good
ii n n i and leaders of the "Barbs."
While working at Cooper, Wilbur
11 M;i l aueri'te May Black, whom
m.ir' <•<! on Dec. 5, 1898. During
I icir 18 vcars of marriage bhey had
l v children. Mrs. Wilbur died on

< r. a lccturcr and demonstrator

T I'HOII) EPIDEMIC
!'•• 1 '*03 he dropped his teaching
al Stafford to combat a desperate
< , 1 •■••mic of typhoid fever in the Bay
Area.
I r the epidemic Wilbur went,
ro if t'» .study. He was a student
mediicne at Frankfurt-on-Main
. ii 'i London before returning t.o take
i"i priva te practice in Palo Alto in
1905.
V. ian loft his Palo Alto practice
after three years to become a pro
)i • r id medicine at Stanford. And
i l'!/9 11f* went lf> Europe again to
. ■■ this time to Munich.
(J;i his relturn he became the dean
el t (if • Stanford Medical School.
moiT hi outstanding contributions
(I'ian was the establisihmenit of
in lime clinical instruction in

preference to the old method of clin
ical instruction by physicians.
In 1915, University President John
Casper Branner reached the retire
ment age of 65 and the Board of
Trustees began looking for his re
placement.
TWO CAMPS
Ralph Arnold, former roommate
of Wilbur's at Encina and member
of the Board of Trustees at this time,
said: "When it came to choosing a
successor to Dr. Branner, the Board
soon lined up in two camps, one
favoring the election of a Princeton
professor of Greek and the other
favoring the election of Ray."
Arnold Listed Timothy Hopkins,
Herbert Hoover and himself as "the
wtheelihorses in the Wilbur camp."
On Jan. 1, 1916, Ray Lyman Wil
bur became the third president of
Lclatid Stanford Junior University.
Ho was the first alumnus to hold the
office. *
When Wilbur came into office the
men in the student body were in
clined to stand "a little aloof and
watch him." They were a little sus
picious of him as a faculty man who
had the reputation of being intense
ly in earnest with regard to college
work and not too "sympathetic with
college foolishness."
During his term as president he
did not lose that reputation, but he
gained another—that of being direct
with them and able to produce re
sults in a marvelously brief time.
WARNS STUDENTS
Wilbur accomplished this when he
gave them unmistakable warning
that he was not satisfied with some
matters of student government, and
he said that "unless some of these
arc improved, the whole of student
control is in jeopardy."
"If student control Ls to succeed,"
he said, "all its units mii'-t be equal
and the elected leaders must be fol
lowed and honored."
He was particularly aiming at the
hazing of freshmen, of which he
said: "Hazing is a combination of
cowardice and bully ism, absolutely
un - American. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. Its essence is
superiority of numbers on one side.
At best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal.
"I want, the freshman to have a
chance," Wilbur said, "to fight, his
own way. We want to develop indi
viduality, not suppress it. Do you

think we could have developed a
Hoover by any such bootlicking sys
tem as we have approached at Stan
