# Wilbur Often Infringed On Roble Curfew
## Fellow Students Tell Of His Encina Life 
### 
While an undergraduate at
Stanford, Wilbur resided in
Room 80 (now 226) of Encina
Hall.
Ralph Arnold, a cousin and room
mate of Wilbur's for two years, re
lates the following account of their
friendship while at Stanford:
"Ray Wilbur had a homespun phi
losophy all his own. One time I came
into the room and saw two apples
lying on the table, a large one and a
smaller one. He picked up the small
one and handed it to me.
"Protecting, I said: 'Ray, if I had
had those two apples, I would have
given you the larger one.'
" 'Well,' he answered, 'you got the
little one and I got the big one, so
you ought to be satisfied.'
"We both were not infrequent vis
itors to Roble Hall. In fact, we seem
ed to enjoy the atmosphere of the
hall so much that we developed a
reputation for sometimes infringing
on the curfew hour of 10 o'clock.
CLOCKS
"On one particularly enjoyable
evening spent in the reception par
lor, the fateful hour crept up on us
unawares, when all of a sudden
alarm clocks started their raucous
clanging from under pillows on the
couches, under chairs, behind orna
ments on the mantel, and even from
behind pictures on the walls.
"We were startled but not un
nerved. Our naturally acquisitive
dispositions simultaneously asserted
themselves and we began collecting
alarm clocks. We escaped with our
pockets full.
"For days some of tht 112 girls were
late for classes, then we repented
and returned the clocks, and all was
forgiven."
Will Irwin, another Encina friend
of Wilbur's, relates this episode. Ir
win was a freshman and Wilbur a
junior.
"DIE, FROjfH!"
"He was always leaping upon me
from nook and recesses of Encina
shouting his war cry, 'Dog of a
freshman, die!'
"And for the first two months of
my first year, I always had on my
anatomy a sore spot caused by rin
attempt—at which I succeeded sel
dom—to put Wilbur in his place.
"He was gorgeously witty. His
family had sent him by express a
large, luscious bhocolate cake. He
traded it for a tennis racket. 'For,'
he said to me, 'a cake is of things
temporal, but a tennis racket of
things eternal.'
"I cannot remember that he smok
ed, and it is my general impression
that he did not drink at all. But he
associated as intimately with mem
bers»like me—of the loose-living and
riotous clement—as with his fellow
puritans."

dom—to put Wilbur in his place.
"He was gorgeously witty. His
family had sent him by express a
large, luscious bhocolate cake. He
traded it for a tennis racket. 'For,'
he said to me, 'a cake is of things
temporal, but a tennis racket of
things eternal.'
"I cannot remember that he smok
ed, and it is my general impression
that he did not drink at all. But he
associated as intimately with mem
bers»like me—of the loose-living and
riotous clement—as with his fellow
puritans."
While an undergraduate at
Stanford, Wilbur resided in
Room 80 (now 226) of Encina
Hall.
Ralph Arnold, a cousin and room
mate of Wilbur's for two years, re
lates the following account of their
friendship while at Stanford:
"Ray Wilbur had a homespun phi
losophy all his own. One time I came
into the room and saw two apples
lying on the table, a large one and a
smaller one. He picked up the small
one and handed it to me.
"Protecting, I said: 'Ray, if I had
had those two apples, I would have
given you the larger one.'
" 'Well,' he answered, 'you got the
little one and I got the big one, so
you ought to be satisfied.'
"We both were not infrequent vis
itors to Roble Hall. In fact, we seem
ed to enjoy the atmosphere of the
hall so much that we developed a
reputation for sometimes infringing
on the curfew hour of 10 o'clock.
CLOCKS
"On one particularly enjoyable
evening spent in the reception par
lor, the fateful hour crept up on us
unawares, when all of a sudden
alarm clocks started their raucous
clanging from under pillows on the
couches, under chairs, behind orna
ments on the mantel, and even from
behind pictures on the walls.
"We were startled but not un
nerved. Our naturally acquisitive
dispositions simultaneously asserted
themselves and we began collecting
alarm clocks. We escaped with our
pockets full.
"For days some of tht 112 girls were
late for classes, then we repented
and returned the clocks, and all was
forgiven."
Will Irwin, another Encina friend
of Wilbur's, relates this episode. Ir
win was a freshman and Wilbur a
junior.
"DIE, FROjfH!"
"He was always leaping upon me
from nook and recesses of Encina
shouting his war cry, 'Dog of a
freshman, die!'
"And for the first two months of
my first year, I always had on my
anatomy a sore spot caused by rin
attempt—at which I succeeded sel
dom—to put Wilbur in his place.
