## He Was President of Three Medical Groups, Headed Many Research Committees 
### 
In all his time as president of Stanford University and Secretary
of the Interior, Ray Lyman Wilbur did not lose touch with the
medical profession.
In 1923, although having been out of active practice for more
than a decade, he was one of the physicians called to attend Presi-

dent Harding when he was fatally♦
ill in San Francisco.
He graduated from the Cooper
Medical School in 189i). And during

American Academy of Medicine in
1912-13 and of the American Medi
cal Association in 1923-24. He was

He is also recognized as the foun
der of the California Physicians'
Service.
His other national obligations in- '
eluded serving as a member of the j

America and as a member of the
Health Committee of the Boys' Clubs
of America.
Before talcing the Cabinet job of
fered him by Herbert Hoover, Wil
bur headed the Committee on the
Costs of Medial Care in 1928. This
committee was founded by the AMA J
and other organizations to make a
five-year study of methods provid
ing adequate medical care at low
cost.
Although the final report was not
unanimous, the majority advanced
organization along voluntary lines.
The report has been called a "classi
cal example to the way a social
problem should be studied."
During the enactment of a tribal
ceremony by the Navajo Indians in
the early 1930'5, a visitor was strick
en with an attack of acute appendi
citis. Wilbur, then Secretary of the
Interior, saw the man collapse and
immediately ordered an operation.
"The Secretary whipped off his
coat, rolled up his sleeves and reach
ed for an operating jacket," wrote a
Denver Posit reporter.
"Despite emergency conditions,"
continues the report, "the operation
was quickly and skillfully perform
ed. Dr. Wilbur's diagnosis proved
correct. The appendix had ruptured,
and another hour of delay would
have spelled death."
Jhe Secretary had given up active
practice over 20 years before.
