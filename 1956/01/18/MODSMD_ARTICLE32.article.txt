## Selleck Ranks Fifth, Bond Rated Seventh 
### 
UCLA's brilliant scoring duo,
Willie (The Whale) Naulls and
Morri'e (The Gazelle) Taft, con
tinued their stranglehold on the
Pacific Coast Conference point
producing race over the last
weekend.
Tal't, the jump-shooting guard, and
his huge, pivot-playing teammate
have paced the Bruins to clean
sweeps over Idaho and Washington
Stale in the patt two weekends.
Tuft leads the scoring brigade with
105 markers for a 26.3-point-per
gamc average. Naulls, the giant cen
ter, has potted 92 digits, holding
down a 23-point average.
Larry Beck, hu. ky junior forward
from Washington State, ranks third
among PCC point-talliers with 85
for 21.3 per contest.
Two Stanford hoopsters rate
among the top ten scorers in the
conference. Guard George Sel'leck
has sunk 62 digits for a 15.5 average.
Forward Bill Bond is the No. 7 man
with 58 tallies and a 14.5 average.
Bond, who was bothered by flu
against Washington, bounced back
with a pair of 25-point efforts against
Idaho last week.
Oregon's giant center, Max Ander
son, has picked up a 23.5-point av
erage in the two encounters the
Ducks have played.
Taft and Naulls each hold down
the lead in other PCC statistics.
The 6-3 guard is far out in front
in both field goals scored and per
centage of shots made from the floor.
Taft's 54.5 per cent average on field
goal attempts holds a narrow lead
over Oregon's Charlie Franklin and
the Bruins' Carroll Adams, who
have averaged 53.3.
Naulls holds a giant lead over
other PCC cagers in rebounding.
The Whale has pulled 71 balls off
the boards, an average of 17.8 per
game.
Barry Brown, Stanford's flying
forward, trails Naulls with 41 re
bounds in four contests. Forward
Jim Coshow of Washington has
grabbed 24 in two encounters.
