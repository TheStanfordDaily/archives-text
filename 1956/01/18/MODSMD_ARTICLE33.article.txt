Jack (Jimrcliill
BARRY BROWN drives in for an easy lay-up after faking past Idaho's
Gary McEwen (IS) in last Saturday's contest. The tally came late in the
encounter as the Cards rallied for a 7 victory. Watching the leaping
Brown dunk the shot are Vandals Jack Mitchell (21) and Jay Buhler (it)
and Indian Clint Waring (3(1). The Cards travel to Corvallis this weekend
for a pair of contests with Oregon State. Saturday's game will be telecast
at 2 p.m.
