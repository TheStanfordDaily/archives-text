of war" statements of Secretary of
State John Fo -ter Dulles or fire him.
Stevenson, 195(5 Democratic presi

At a news conference Stevenson
accused the Administration and Dul

policy.
He said he did not believe that
Mr. Eisenhower approves of Dul

not approve, Stevenson said, "his
course of action is clearly indicated."
Asked if the phrase "course of
action" meant Eisenhower should
fire Dulles, Stevenson snapped:
"Yes, or repudiate ths statements.
"For this nation to walk to the
verge of war three times in three
years while drastically reducing our
military defense for domestic politi
cal advantage can only he counted
suicidal folly," he said.
