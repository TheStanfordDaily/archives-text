# Departmental Rivalries Deplored in Series Talk
## 
### STEW TOY 
Professor Whitney J. Oates, trying to prove that "everyone must
be a philosopher," last night decried the modern tendency to ask,
"What will I get out of humanities?"
Oates, head of Princeton University's Department of Classics
and director of its special program in 'humanities, was speaking

on "Humanities in an Age of Sci
ence" at last night's Tuesday Series.
Lately, he said, there has been a
sort of rivalry between university
departments, with natural scientists,
social scientists and humanists out
doing each other in claims of supe
riority of their fields and in describ
ing themselves as paragons of virtue.
DIVISION
''Modern teachers," he said, "are
heirs to an educational system
marked by division and devices,
rather than by a spirit of unity."
As a result of this competition,
Oate.s said, each university division
"is forced to get up its own advertis
ing, by which it blows up the worth
of its own field and, by implication,
disparages that of its competitors.
"If this is done, the situation be
comes absolutely intolerable."
At Princeton, after the social and
natural sciences had been given
boosts through grants, President
Dodds asked, with tongue in cheek,
"What can we do about humani
ties?"
COMPETITION
Oates said that the competition in
the three fields is pointed up by a
recent survey which sought to de
termine the amounts of money spent
by each professor in each of the
three categories.
"The natural scientists were found
to use $1800 a year, the social sci
entists $000 and the humanists
$133.30. I think it was the 30 cents
that bothered them.
"We have lost the idqo of a uni
versity as a community of scholars.
We have become not universities but
multiversities."
HUMANITIES
Even with this competition, ho
said, the humanities are being
more and more lime.
As an example of this, he said the
Bell Telephone Company sends its
executives to the University of
Pennsylvania for one academic year
to study literature, art and history.
"I presume that when they return
to their executive positions they
won't have to worry so much about
the decisions they have to make."
Oates said that the battle between
the three divisions is ridiculous be
cause "there is no subject in a uni
versity which doesn't have its ac
companying humanistic aspects."
Two definitions of humanities are
generally given, Oates said.
The first is the conventional desig
nation for a familiar group of sub
jects. They are grouped together be
cause they involve man as an indi
vidual and the principles by which
he lives.
The second definition connotes a
"way of looking at things—an atti
tude of the mind oriented toward the
principles of life."
Oates said that "everyone is a
humanist and should be oriented 1o
values and principles. Values are as
real a part of our universe as are
facts."
"The humanities," he said, "have

a responsibility to show that by a
philosophic approach to the problem
of values the underlying worth of
the life of the mind can be shown.
"No one can escape from being a
humanist.
"Our difference in opinion must be
handled by philosophy in the light of
all available data.
"GOD OF OBJECTIVITY"
"We may be able thus to relieve
ourselves from making a god out. of
objectivity; for each of us has a
grasp of only part of the great ob
jective universe.
"We all recognize the difference
between knowledge and wisdom.
Knowledge per se is innate in the
individual. Wisdom leads to action
in the light of knowledge."
O'ates said that the answer to the
competition o£ the three divisions—
the social sciences, the natural sci
ences and the humanities—is a sim
ple one: "We all need each other.
We are not rivals."
He said, "All three divisions of the
university must be healthy. But. the
health of the social and natural sci
ences needs the health of the hu
manities."
Oates, who was graduated from
and has taught at Princeton for 25
years, is at Stanford this year to as
sist, in the Special Programs in Hu
manities.

multiversities."
HUMANITIES
Even with this competition, ho
said, the humanities are being
more and more lime.
As an example of this, he said the
Bell Telephone Company sends its
executives to the University of
Pennsylvania for one academic year
to study literature, art and history.
"I presume that when they return
to their executive positions they
won't have to worry so much about
the decisions they have to make."
Oates said that the battle between
the three divisions is ridiculous be
cause "there is no subject in a uni
versity which doesn't have its ac
companying humanistic aspects."
Two definitions of humanities are
generally given, Oates said.
The first is the conventional desig
nation for a familiar group of sub
jects. They are grouped together be
cause they involve man as an indi
vidual and the principles by which
he lives.
The second definition connotes a
"way of looking at things—an atti
tude of the mind oriented toward the
principles of life."
Oates said that "everyone is a
humanist and should be oriented 1o
values and principles. Values are as
real a part of our universe as are
facts."
"The humanities," he said, "have

a responsibility to show that by a
philosophic approach to the problem
of values the underlying worth of
the life of the mind can be shown.
"No one can escape from being a
humanist.
"Our difference in opinion must be
handled by philosophy in the light of
all available data.
"GOD OF OBJECTIVITY"
"We may be able thus to relieve
ourselves from making a god out. of
objectivity; for each of us has a
grasp of only part of the great ob
jective universe.
"We all recognize the difference
between knowledge and wisdom.
Knowledge per se is innate in the
individual. Wisdom leads to action
in the light of knowledge."
O'ates said that the answer to the
competition o£ the three divisions—
the social sciences, the natural sci
ences and the humanities—is a sim
ple one: "We all need each other.
We are not rivals."
He said, "All three divisions of the
university must be healthy. But. the
health of the social and natural sci
ences needs the health of the hu
manities."
Oates, who was graduated from
and has taught at Princeton for 25
years, is at Stanford this year to as

WHITNEY J. OATES
Professor Whitney J. Oates, trying to prove that "everyone must
be a philosopher," last night decried the modern tendency to ask,
"What will I get out of humanities?"
Oates, head of Princeton University's Department of Classics
and director of its special program in 'humanities, was speaking

on "Humanities in an Age of Sci
ence" at last night's Tuesday Series.
Lately, he said, there has been a
sort of rivalry between university
departments, with natural scientists,
social scientists and humanists out
doing each other in claims of supe
riority of their fields and in describ
ing themselves as paragons of virtue.
DIVISION
''Modern teachers," he said, "are
heirs to an educational system
marked by division and devices,
rather than by a spirit of unity."
As a result of this competition,
Oate.s said, each university division
"is forced to get up its own advertis
ing, by which it blows up the worth
of its own field and, by implication,
disparages that of its competitors.
"If this is done, the situation be
comes absolutely intolerable."
At Princeton, after the social and
natural sciences had been given
boosts through grants, President
Dodds asked, with tongue in cheek,
"What can we do about humani
ties?"
COMPETITION
Oates said that the competition in
the three fields is pointed up by a
recent survey which sought to de
termine the amounts of money spent
by each professor in each of the
three categories.
"The natural scientists were found
to use $1800 a year, the social sci
entists $000 and the humanists
$133.30. I think it was the 30 cents
that bothered them.
"We have lost the idqo of a uni

We have become not universities but
multiversities."

ences needs the health of the hu
manities."
