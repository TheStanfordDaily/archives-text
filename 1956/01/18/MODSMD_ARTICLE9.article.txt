# It's Chills for Charity In Spook Show Tonight
## Frankenstein, Dracula in Mem Aud To Scare Up Money for WUS Drive 
### 
Two of Hollywood's "bad guys" are going to work for the World
University Service tonight.
They haven't exactly reformed but they are putting their talents
to work at the charity flick tonight.
Yes, Frankenstein and Dracula return tonight—and in their origi-

nal uncut roles in Universal-Inter-'*
national's "Frankenstein" arid "Dra
cula."
The movies will be shown at Me
morial Auditorium starting at 7:30
p.m.
Tickets will be 50 cents at the
door with all proceeds going to
wus.
Tonight's show will be run only
once, but the WUS committee said
that the movies would be shown
again tomorrow afternoon, should
there be an overflow, crowd.
The two films are the ones from
which came a long series of Ameri
can horror films. Chilling classics
like the "Son of Dracula," "Bride of
Frankenstein," in fact films on prac
tically the whole family of Frank
enstein and Dracula were later made.
A TREAT
"Those who have never seen these !
classics are in for a treat.—and a
scare," according to Gary Gielow,
ASSU Flicks manager, who chose
the films rather than newer ones
which today's students might have
seen.
(The Health Service has been
alerted —nurses will be in attend
ance.)
Frankenstein and Dracula talents
will be put to good use. They do
claim, a few victims in the films, but
in over-all view the most number
will benefit.
(Frankenstein and Dracula some
times perform under the pseudo
nyms of Boris Karloff and Bela Lu
gosi.)
WUS money is used to buy food,
clothing and educational and medi
cal equipment permitting students
in poverty - stricken countries to
continue their educations.
Surveys made by WUS show there
are many countries in which college
students lack even adequate shelter.
These areas are especially bad in
.the Middle East and Africa.
FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS
One of the most recent WUS op
erations was building a hotel in
Seoul, Korea, to hoifse homeless stu
dents after the ravaging of the city
had destroyed most housing. This
was done with American WUS
funds.
Other dormitories have been rais
ed by WUS in Cairo, Athens, Jeru
salem, Calcutta and Beirut.
WUS' main project now is among
Indian universities, where a recent
study has shown an appalling need
which can't be alleviated until,WUS
receives more funds.
PROBLEM
Another serious problem they are
(trying to alleviate is the high death
rate because of illness among stu
dents in the Middle East, India and
Africa. Money supplied by WUS for
medical supplies and building ma
terials for hospitals has saved many
lives, but illness is still rampant.
Tonight's Flick is the first in the
WUS Drive at the University. Next
week solicitors will ask for contri
butions in all campus living groups.
Other planned projects:
• An ugly man contest.
• A KZSU radio marathon.
• A weight, guessing contest on
Quad featuring H. Donald Winlbig
ler, dean of students.
• "Jazz at Mem Aud," featuring
Dave Brubeck and his progressive
music.
