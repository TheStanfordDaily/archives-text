# Maddock Takes Parking Proposals to Legislature
## Traffic Com Chairman Complains 'Nothing Gets Done' by University Planning Office 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Complaining that "nothing gets done" about recommendations
to the University's planning office, Chairman Bob Maddock of the
ASSU Traffic Committee took his case to the Legislature yester
day.
"It's a simple law of physics that to increase the flow of any-

thing—automobiles or liquids—you
have to do one of two things: in
crease the capacity of the carrier or
raise velocity through the carrier.
"To raise velocity in this case
would mean having the cars drive
faster or removing the restrictions to
their movement," said Maddock.
Hoping to "get something done"
with the help of LASSU's influence,
he presented the body with the first
five of several proposals he will put
before the Legislature over the next
few weeks.
President George Ralph said that
after LASSU debates the measures,
they will be sent to the Planning
Office as a resolution. Ralph feels
that "the added strength given to
these proposals by putting them as
a resolution may speed action on
them."
"DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS"
Citing "deplorable present traffic
and parking conditions" and calling
his proposals "basic," Maddock asked
LASSU to consider the following
suggestions of his committee:
• That campus police direct traf
fic at certain critical stoppage points
during peak hours. These would be
at the Post Office corner, the Physios
Corner intersection, the Roble Hall
corner, and, on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday (after Bio and Civ lec
tures), at the corner of Galvez and
Serra Streets.
• That white lines be painted or
repainted in parking lots and spaces,
and four lanes be made out of Palm
Drive by parking new lines.
• That stop signs be placed be
tween Stern and Wilbur Halls. Here
Maddock said "an automobile, ac
celerating from the stop sign at Gal
vez, can reach a speed of 40 miles
an hour passing Stem and double
that passing Wilbur. That isn't a
race track out there. I've been told
that there have been a couple of
near misses." He suggested Escon
dido Road be made a stop street and
Campus Drive, the new peripheral
road, be made a through street.
OVAL PARKING
• That parking in the oval at the
campus end of Palm Drive be re
served for off-campus and Village
students. "They have offered to pay
for the necessary identification stick
ers—it wouldn't cost the University
anything," according to Maddock.
• That extensive revision be made
in the triangular parking lot be
tween Stern Hall and the Education
Building. The proposal called for
making Alvarado Row a permanent
one-way street heading away from
the Quad as far as Galvez, making
Escondido a one-way street heading
toward the Quad from Galvez from
7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and rearrangement
of the parking area.
Maddock feels that these meas
ures would be a large step forward
in clearing up the traffic - parking
snarls on the campus and, for the
most part, would cost little more
than a few buckets of paint.

fic at certain critical stoppage points
during peak hours. These would be
at the Post Office corner, the Physios
Corner intersection, the Roble Hall
corner, and, on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday (after Bio and Civ lec
tures), at the corner of Galvez and
Serra Streets.
• That white lines be painted or
repainted in parking lots and spaces,
and four lanes be made out of Palm
Drive by parking new lines.
• That stop signs be placed be
tween Stern and Wilbur Halls. Here
Maddock said "an automobile, ac
celerating from the stop sign at Gal
vez, can reach a speed of 40 miles
an hour passing Stem and double
that passing Wilbur. That isn't a
race track out there. I've been told
that there have been a couple of
near misses." He suggested Escon
dido Road be made a stop street and
Campus Drive, the new peripheral
road, be made a through street.
OVAL PARKING
• That parking in the oval at the
campus end of Palm Drive be re
served for off-campus and Village
students. "They have offered to pay
for the necessary identification stick
ers—it wouldn't cost the University
anything," according to Maddock.
• That extensive revision be made
in the triangular parking lot be
tween Stern Hall and the Education
Building. The proposal called for
making Alvarado Row a permanent
one-way street heading away from
the Quad as far as Galvez, making
Escondido a one-way street heading
toward the Quad from Galvez from
7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and rearrangement
of the parking area.
Maddock feels that these meas
ures would be a large step forward
in clearing up the traffic - parking
snarls on the campus and, for the
most part, would cost little more
than a few buckets of paint.
Complaining that "nothing gets done" about recommendations
to the University's planning office, Chairman Bob Maddock of the
ASSU Traffic Committee took his case to the Legislature yester
day.
"It's a simple law of physics that to increase the flow of any-

thing—automobiles or liquids—you
have to do one of two things: in
crease the capacity of the carrier or
raise velocity through the carrier.
"To raise velocity in this case
would mean having the cars drive
faster or removing the restrictions to
their movement," said Maddock.
Hoping to "get something done"
with the help of LASSU's influence,
he presented the body with the first
five of several proposals he will put
before the Legislature over the next
few weeks.
President George Ralph said that
after LASSU debates the measures,
they will be sent to the Planning
Office as a resolution. Ralph feels
that "the added strength given to
these proposals by putting them as
a resolution may speed action on
them."
"DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS"
Citing "deplorable present traffic
and parking conditions" and calling
his proposals "basic," Maddock asked
LASSU to consider the following
suggestions of his committee:
• That campus police direct traf
fic at certain critical stoppage points
during peak hours. These would be
at the Post Office corner, the Physios
Corner intersection, the Roble Hall
corner, and, on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday (after Bio and Civ lec
tures), at the corner of Galvez and
