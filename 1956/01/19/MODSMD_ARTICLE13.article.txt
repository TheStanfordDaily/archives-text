# Stanford Admission Procedures Don't Discriminate, Snyder Says
## Tells LASSU All Racial, Religions Questions Dropped from Application 
### BILL WRIGHT Editor, The Daily 
Features of the University's admissions procedures which many
people think are discriminatory are designed lor quite different
purposes, Dr. Rixford K. Snyder, director of admissions, told tho
ASSIJ Legislature yesterday afternoon.
Snyder attended the meeting to answer questions the body had

posed last quarter while discussing
admissions aspects of the Model Ed
ucational Practice Standards cre
ated by NSA last summer.
He said that all race and religion
questions have been dropped from
the application. The request for the
applicants photograph and the ques
tions pertaining to his parents' birth
places and to his intention to apply
for a scholarship were not used to
discriminate.
The University does not discrimi
nate against Negroes, Snyder said.
If anything, it's the reverse.
Snyder revealed that the photo
graphs "have been used to discrimi
nate in favor" of Negroes because
competition is stiff for Negroes who
can make the grade in major pri
vate universities.
A Negro recognized through his
photograph would probably be ad
mitted in preference to a Caucasian
of equal qualifications.
Snyder explained that most Ne
groes fall by the wayside in the Col
lege Board aptitude examinations
and that many who are admitted do
not have enough money to come.
Even when the University offers
scholarships to Negroes, Stanford is
"outbid" by the wealthier Eastern
schools.
NOT DISCRIMINATORY
The photographs, Snyder empha
sized, are not discriminatory. About
five per cent who are admitted do
not submit a picture. The photo
graphs allow the admissions office to
work on a more personal basis, he
said, because the personnel can be
come familiar with applicants' ap
pearances.
Snyder also discussed policy with
regard to admittance of women, ac
knowledging that the University did
discriminate to some extent. But he
predicted a lower ratio for next
year.
Stanford facilities, both housing
and academic, he said, are oriented
heavily for men. Five of the seven
colleges appeal primarily to men.
Thus Stanford accepts a greater per
centage of male than female appli
cants, and the standards for women
are higher.
MEN HIGHER
He added, however, that this year
for the first time the average score
of the men on the aptitude tests was
higher than that of the women. The
women still have a higher high
school grade point average, he said.
Snyder also explained what
weight the University gives to dif
ferent elements of an applicant's
qualifications. High school grades
and the aptitude test scores count
about one-third each.
High school citizenship—the appli
cant's reasons for continuing his ed
ucation, the recommendation of his
principal or counselor—counts about
20 per cent. This year the principal's
prediction for success, his indication
of the applicant's "drive," will be
considered more heavily.
The remaining factor considered
is "the adjustment potential of the
student." Snyder explained this was

more of a weeding out factor, elimi
nating the unstable applicants.
The University does not have quo
tas for states or high schools, Snyder
said, although many universities do.
Stanford is, however, "trying to
build up its geographical distribu
tion" by visiting more high schools,
particularly to the east.
This year Stanford admitted stu
dents from 555 different high schools,
in contrast to 4GO schools last year
and 420 the year before.
AT "CUT-OFF POINT"
Snyder said the University doesn't
rate each high school officially, but
that grade point averages are kept
carefully on every student from each
school and are used in judging ap
plicants at the "critical point, the
cut-off point."
Snyder was quizzed about possible
discrimination because of economic
status. He said that this was defi
nitely not a consideration, but that
a lack of available scholarships for
freshmen did prevent many students
from the lower income brackets, who
had been admitted, from attending.
Currently the University awards
scholarships to 10 per cent of the
freshmen while Yale and Harvard
have 29 per cent on scholarships.
Snyder is recommending that the
University place 20 per cent on
scholarships.

Stanford is, however, "trying to
build up its geographical distribu
tion" by visiting more high schools,
particularly to the east.
This year Stanford admitted stu
dents from 555 different high schools,
in contrast to 4GO schools last year
and 420 the year before.
AT "CUT-OFF POINT"
Snyder said the University doesn't
rate each high school officially, but
that grade point averages are kept
carefully on every student from each
school and are used in judging ap
plicants at the "critical point, the
cut-off point."
Snyder was quizzed about possible
discrimination because of economic
status. He said that this was defi
nitely not a consideration, but that
a lack of available scholarships for
freshmen did prevent many students
from the lower income brackets, who
had been admitted, from attending.
Currently the University awards
scholarships to 10 per cent of the
freshmen while Yale and Harvard
have 29 per cent on scholarships.
Snyder is recommending that the
University place 20 per cent on
scholarships.

Features of the University's admissions procedures which many
people think are discriminatory are designed lor quite different
purposes, Dr. Rixford K. Snyder, director of admissions, told tho
ASSIJ Legislature yesterday afternoon.
Snyder attended the meeting to answer questions the body had

posed last quarter while discussing
admissions aspects of the Model Ed
ucational Practice Standards cre
ated by NSA last summer.
He said that all race and religion
questions have been dropped from
the application. The request for the
applicants photograph and the ques
tions pertaining to his parents' birth
places and to his intention to apply
for a scholarship were not used to
discriminate.
The University does not discrimi
nate against Negroes, Snyder said.
If anything, it's the reverse.
Snyder revealed that the photo
graphs "have been used to discrimi
nate in favor" of Negroes because
competition is stiff for Negroes who
can make the grade in major pri
vate universities.
A Negro recognized through his
photograph would probably be ad
mitted in preference to a Caucasian
of equal qualifications.
Snyder explained that most Ne
groes fall by the wayside in the Col
lege Board aptitude examinations
and that many who are admitted do
not have enough money to come.
Even when the University offers
scholarships to Negroes, Stanford is
"outbid" by the wealthier Eastern
schools.
NOT DISCRIMINATORY
The photographs, Snyder empha
sized, are not discriminatory. About
five per cent who are admitted do
not submit a picture. The photo
graphs allow the admissions office to
work on a more personal basis, he
said, because the personnel can be
come familiar with applicants' ap
pearances.
Snyder also discussed policy with
regard to admittance of women, ac
knowledging that the University did
discriminate to some extent. But he
predicted a lower ratio for next
year.
Stanford facilities, both housing
and academic, he said, are oriented
heavily for men. Five of the seven
colleges appeal primarily to men.
Thus Stanford accepts a greater per
centage of male than female appli
cants, and the standards for women
are higher.
MEN HIGHER
He added, however, that this year
for the first time the average score
of the men on the aptitude tests was
higher than that of the women. The
women still have a higher high
school grade point average, he said.
Snyder also explained what
weight the University gives to dif
ferent elements of an applicant's
qualifications. High school grades
and the aptitude test scores count
about one-third each.
High school citizenship—the appli
cant's reasons for continuing his ed
ucation, the recommendation of his
principal or counselor—counts about
20 per cent. This year the principal's
prediction for success, his indication
of the applicant's "drive," will be
considered more heavily.
The remaining factor considered
is "the adjustment potential of the
student." Snyder explained this was

more of a weeding out factor, elimi
nating the unstable applicants.
The University does not have quo
tas for states or high schools, Snyder
said, although many universities do.
Stanford is, however, "trying to
build up its geographical distribu
tion" by visiting more high schools,
