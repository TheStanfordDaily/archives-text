# Men's Council Convicts Eight Panty-Raiders
## Frosh Are Sentenced For San Jose Incident 
### 
Men's Council, meeting in an
all-day session last Saturday,
handled two Fundamental
Standard cases.
One involved a "panty raid" at a
San Jose State sorority, and the
other was a liquor case.
Eight freshmen were found guilty
for participating in the "panty raid."
The raid came the same night as the
incident at Branner Hall late last
quarter, and two cars of students
drove to San Jose, where the Kappa
Alpha T'heta house was the target.
SENTENCES
Each of the eight was sentenced
to 25 hours of work at the Conva
lescent. Home and have until April
15 to complete their sentences.
Gerald Messner, Council chairman,
also talked to the men, explaining
to them how panty raid "publicity"
was not good for the University, and
that the raid at Branner had been
distorted by the press to the detri
ment of Stanford.
He also pointed out how students,
as individuals, must answer for their
own part in group action. "Stanford
has a good reputation now, but in
cidents similar to this one do not
enhance that reputation," Messner
added.
The second case involved three
freshmen, 16, 17 and 18 years of age,
who had purchased beer at a store
on El Camino withou* the use of any
identification.
DRANK BEER
They then drove to College Ter
race, where they drank the beer and
pulled licence plates off, several
parked cars, and were trying to re
move a street sign when the police
apprehended them.
They were released shortly to the
custody of the University, and the
case was turned over to the Council.
All three were found guilty of
violating the Fundamental Standard
on two counts: violation of the state
liquor laws, and destruction of pri
vate and public property. Each was
sentenced to 40 hours of work at the
Con Home and placed on probation
until the end of spring quarter in
June.
