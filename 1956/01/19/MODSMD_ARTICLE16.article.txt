# WUS Collects Funds for Asia Relief Program
## Drive to Send Food, Hooks to Students 
### 
"If you contribute money to WUS
you may be saving someone's life,"
according to Drive Chairman Bill
Crookston.
In India and the Middle East hun
dreds of college students die each
year from diseases that Americans
would simply take a pill for. Most, of
ithem have never had a medical ex
amination.
Unchecked epidemics that sweep
through Asian countries cause even
more serious death rates, Crookston
said. Although college students in
the East become their countries'
statesmen and leaders of thought, all
but a handful are as poverty-strick
en and in need of food as their il
literate fellow countrymen.
It has been estimated that 1 out
of evc-ry 16 Indian students is an
active TB case.
Stanford students will get a chance
to save lives next week, when so
licitors for WUS, World University
Service, ask them for donations to
buy food, medicine, textbooks and
building materials for dispensaries
and dormitories that Asian students
do not have.
"Certainly no one here suffers
from lack of food. I think we ought
!to spend some money where it will
really do some good." '
