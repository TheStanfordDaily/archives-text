# Monsters Return As Horror Flicks Fill Mem Aud
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
The intellectual vacuum at Stan
ford had still more air pumped from
it last night as two plain, old, narrow
screen monster pictures packed Mem
Aud with the best flick crowd in
years.
A complete disregard for studies
was shown as a large percentage of
the student body gladly pitched in
50 cents a head to contribute to the
World University Service Winter
Drive to see "Frankenstein" and
"Dracula."
The theater was filled pretty
quickly and the crowd was feeling
extremely unintellectual. For, all of
a sudden a huge cheer went up from
the assembled mob. A paper airplane
had floated gracefully from the bal
cony and come to resrt in the orches
tra pit.
More followed, and soon the
brightly lit auditorium was darkened
by the swarms of student-construct
ed air-borne missiles.
Then the audience settled back to
scream at the horrors.
The Frankenstein movie began
with a funeral scene; the head of a
creature peered over a fence. "Bur
ton Abbott!" screamed a wise Stan
ford student. That did it.
Ilhe film was ineffective and no
body fainted. Perhaps it was due to
the fact that the beautiful nurses
Which were advertised to be in at
tendance did not show up to carry
out the weak--hearted.
Count Dracula, however, won ev
erybody's heart. The prospect of a
poor man all alone in the world and
just trying to get a drink touched
everyone.
The picture was complete with
misty old castles-and coffins. Bela
Lugosi as the starry-eyed thirsty
hero did the best job of acting in
the whole program.
There will probably be many this
morning checking their throats for
teeth mark*.
