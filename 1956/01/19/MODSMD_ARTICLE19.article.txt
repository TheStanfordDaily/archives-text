Axe Society's Activities Hand
book was the subject of three mo
tions presented before (he Legis
lature yesterday afternoon. Two
of them were defeated, the third
tabled, with the result that the
booklet's future is even more un
certain than before.
The idea behind the project is to
furnish freshmen and other stu
dents with a summary of the pur
pose and activities of all campus
organizations. The Legislature and
its predecessor Excom have dis
cussed it since November, 1954.
In fall quarter the Legislature
had agreed to appropriate from the
ASSU contingency fund one-half
of the cost of producing the book
let. Axe Society was to raise the
other half, perhaps by a subscrip
tion fee from the organizations to
be listed.
Dick Bolton, Axe Society presi
dent, reported a "blood and tur
nip" situation with regard to col
lecting subscription fees. The or
ganizations could not or would not
pay. He suggested that the ASSU
cover total costs of the booklet.
Two motions embodying l hat
suggestion were brought up but
defeated by the Legislature. Ob
jections centered around obsoles
cence of the book shortly after its
preparation and the fact that it
could not be ready until late this
school year.
Another motion, directing the
student financial manager to in
clude in the budget for the year
195(!-57 funds to publish during
summer quarter 2000 copies of the
activities booklet, was tabled.
The Daily editorial by-laws ami
Foreign Scholarship by-laws were
approved.
