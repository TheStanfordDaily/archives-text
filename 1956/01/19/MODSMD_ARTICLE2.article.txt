# Stern Passes Resolution On Parking Lots
## Time, Labor Offered To Ease Problem 
### 
The ASSU Traffic Committee isn't
the only student group that is aware
of deficiencies in the University's
parking scheme.
Stern Council has passed a resolu
tion it hopes will make authorities
sit up and take notice of the jammed
parking lot between Stern Hail and
the Education Building.
The Council resolved that if re
lief is not forthcoming, the men of
Stern will donate their time and
labor—and maybe even a little mon
ey—to make the parking lot accom
modate more of their cars more ef
ficiently.
Tom Til ton of the Traffic Commit
tee said last night that Stern resi
dents were "tired of being told |by
the University Planning Office],
'Well, it's a fine idea, but . . "
Tilton said the Council found it
hard to understand why no parking
space was provided for the new
Crothers Memorial Hall, and only a
small amount provided for Wilbur
Hall and the Stern Hall addition.
"The University has told Stern
Council that more parking will
merely encourage more people to
drive to campus," according to Til -
ton, "but the Council feels that plan
ning should be done for the maxi
mum rather than the minimum."
"The Stern group will not press
the iss'ue with the University unless
present efforts of the Traffic Com
mittee meet resistance," said Tilton.
