Do you think that the Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, will be successful?
The first issue of the University's new literary
magazine was a sellout last week. A second printing
was ordered and the magazine went on sale again
yesterday.
There have been numerous attempts in the past
to publish a literary magazine on the campus but each
time it folded. ,
So, in an effort to ascertain the students' opinions
of the latest literary venture, The Daily asked stu
dent s what they thought of the magazine and if they
I i.rvod it would be successful. The interviewers re
j )i d having a difficult time finding students who
1 id re; d the Sequoia. The comments that were re
ceived are:
Tom Mi in, '59, Wilbur: "I think that the first issue
of Sequoia is a very fine and worthwhile production.
In this issue there is to be found both high-caliber
materiel and a good variation of subjects. I also find
thai an outside writer heightens my interest in the
) i .azino. The Sequoia should be a definite success
if the pattern laid out in the first issue is followed
by the magazine."
Michael Ileuer, '57, Los Arcos: "I was frankly
quite disappointed. The only intellectual competence
exhibited in the first issue came from a professor at
n institution of learning more than 3000 miles away;
thi eoms to be an admission, in my opinion quite
unjustified, that no Stanford professor could have
v/t'iit,f;n an article equal to Professor Jones's. More
over, the format, especially the cover design, sug
i ■! the information bulletin of a small business
oil •',e rather than a literary magazine of a great
University's student body."
Ilany E. Roberts, '58, El Toro: "Yes, I do believe
i; will be a success for it covers a variety of interests.
Ti ■ m.'is'':zine is nation-wide in its content and pro
vides an opportunity for local talent to express itself.
With careful planning it should be a definite contri
bution to the Stanford scene."
Katherine Horn, '59, Branner: "I think the Se
quoia will succeed because it fills a need not covered
by other campus publications."
Bruce Willats, '5<5, off-campus: "I think that
many people bought the first issue of Sequoia because
they were curious and for the prestige element in
volved. There is no doubt that the sales will drop off
f'it the second issue. However, there are many good
items in the magazine, many of them novelties. It
ought to be a success."
Vic Kyriakis, '57, Stern: "This is one magazine
that should not be judged by its cover, since its stuff
ings are good. Because our student body is made up

of men and women from all parts of the country,
Sequoia should prove to be interesting from the
standpoint of variety."
Eileen Conaghan, '56, Union: ''The general impres
sion by everyone who read it was very favorable, but
its sellout was largely a testimony to its novelty and
promotion. Future issues will probably be attractive
to a few people whose interests are mainly in the
field of English and philosophy. Its price is very high
and it's the kind of thing that one would borrow
rather than buy."
Chuck Strong, 'sf>, Village: "Even though Sequoia
is not of the Chaparral nature, I feel it will be suc
cessful, judging from the recently-published edition.
It assumes that there are critical, demanding readers
and gifted contributors here at Stanford. I was
shocked at Monroe's 'Calvary in New Mexico,' and
enjoyed Ellen de Young Kay's 'To One Who Could
Not Let Me Know Him'—so I know the gifted con
tributors are here. However, I didn't read Sequoia
critically, so I can't say whether demanding readers
are present at Stanford. Regardless of whether one
reads critically or not, most of the articles were in
teresting, and I feel this fact will determine Sequoia's
future success."
Bruce Lowry, graduate, off-campus: "As an out
let for campus writers Sequoia is already a succcss.
However, my feeling is that magazines should be
more interested in the reader than the writer and I
don't think literary magazines are. Very rarely does
a campus literary magazine discover a really good
writer. Good writers usually publish their work else
where, and I don't think that the average student
should support a magazine for the same reason that
he goes to the Big Game-—allegiance to his school."
Sandy Peters, '57, Union: "I was impressed with
its first issue and if they keep the quality up, I don't
see any reason why it should not succeed."
Joe Regan, '58, off-campus: "I think the new mag
azine is good and I don't see why one hasn't suc
ceeded here before. I think that Sequoia is necessary
because a University with Stanford's reputation
should have one. It was a very fine first issue, I think,
because the contents appealed to the general student
as well as to the esoteric intellectual."
Suzy Klein, '57. Union: "We hear so much about
the lack of intellectual activity at Stanford that it was
really reassuring to read the first issue of Sequoia and
discover that after all we do have interests beyond
football and Cellar coffee. The articles were well
written and selected, with a great range of subject
matter and style. I think Editor Linda Lovelace cer
tainly found that place between "a jokebook and a
coterie publication."
What do you think?


WILL IT SUCCEED?
