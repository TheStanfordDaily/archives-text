lack of planning
To the Editor:
I.;i t Sunday I attended the concert of the music
of Aaron I greatly enjoyed the performance
was quite well impressed with the number of
ykilled find accomplished musicians at Stanford.
Ju .1 one thing was lacking. That was an audito
rium of ufficient size to seat both the audience and
the p rformers. There seemed to be a lack of plan
ning somewhere. To the best of my knowledge, Mem
/.ad was not being used. This seemed to be the self
evident answer to the problem which became strik
ingly evident at the talk given by Mr. Copland on
Friday.
] have never seen quite the confusion that oc
< un d slightly before the "Portrait of Lincoln." [
'.vou 1 '] be willing to make a small wager that Mr.
("■•p'and has never before seen a performance of his
work where the performers cascaded oft the stage
onio the main floor, while the audience extended up
onto part of the stage! Slightly unconventional at
best.
On investigation I found that the planning com
mittee was not the body at fault. They had tried to
ol>:;iin the use of the Memorial Auditorium, and had
I'm 'i turned down by the University. Now it is my
ini'ier:--landing that Dave Brubeck is shortly to have
the use of that building. What has Brubeck got that
('< pland hasn't got? By what criterion does the leader
n! n modern jazz band take precedence over one of
America's foremost composers? Is this a sign of the
infiltration of anti-intellectualism in our University?
I wi h no one to construe this statement into the
notion that. I personally have great prejudice against
i /a T enjoy good jazz as much as anyone. As Mr.
C".pl;md said, if any group is wdllirig to spend the

cfTort to write it, and any other group gets a kick out
of listening to it, then it is art. (He also left himself
a loophole by saying that of course some art is greater
than other art.) However, I see no reason why Cop
land's music should be looked down upon to the point
of not giving him access to a sufficiently large audi
torium in which to have his music heard.
"University," an acquaintance once remarked, "is
a challenging word. It implies all knowledge." It
knows no prejudice or limitation of any discrimina
tory type. It is boundless. It is the right and duty
of all of us, whether planning our course for next
quarter, or deciding on what entertainment is to be
put on, to try to make Stanford rightfully carry the
title of "University."
I'm sure the faculty and the administration are
aware of this. That is why I do not understand why
there should be any discrimination in the use of our
auditorium.

(Editor's note: A reporter has been assigned
since the first of (he week to discover why Aaron
Copland was cramped into Cubberley ami to ob
tain general University policy regarding the audi
toriums. We hope to have that report Monday.)
correction
To the Editor:
In reference to the visit of Frank de Bellis, we feel
it necessary to point out a substantial error in ty
pography. That, talk by this distinguished authority
011 classical music is scheduled for today at 4:15, not
1:15 as previously reported in your columns. . . .
