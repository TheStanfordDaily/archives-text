## Pantomimist Is Interesting In Tedious Sort of Way 
### RICHARD MENDE 
Connoisseurs of the inconsequential will be delighted to learn
that the world's greatest living pantomimist is in San Francisco.
In fairness it should be mentioned that this is a minority report
on Marcel Marceau's achievements as an entertainer, dissenting
from the views expressed by the New York critics ("joyously

♦■lunny, a genius of Chaplin s stat
ure"), the Boston critics ("a truly
great clown"), the Philadelphia crit
ics ("very gay and infectious"), the
Los Angeles critics ("ahead of ad
miration comes laughter—bountiful
laughter") and the opening night
crowd at the Geary that gave him
seven curtain calls and a celebra
tion banquet.

La was about. The severe limitations

riety of a juggler's

or a tight-rope walker's rather than
of an interpretive performer.
CLEVER UNCLE
The show seemed not so much a
triumph in maintaining the precari
ous balance between complex for
malisms and vital expression; it
seemed like a clever uncle doing
after-dinner tricks — for two solid
hours.
More important, Mr. Marceau for
the most part captured only the sur
face characteristics of the landscape
and of life. It was clever of him to
populate a park with old ladies knit
ting, children playing ball, a woman
wheeling a baby carriage. But it was
a cleverness without much beyond
the standard insights into the sur
roundings.
POIGNANT PERCEPTION
There was an amusingly theatrical
bit called "David and Goliath" and
two other picces I found satisfying:
"Youth, Maturity, Old Age and
Death" was really exquisite and did
capture in a few gestures and move
ments a sensitive and poignant per
ception of life.
"Bip and the Butterfly" Likewise
created a feeling of delicacy and
poetic sensitivity.
The justification for comparing
Mr. Marceau to Charlie Chaplin
seems limited to the fact that they
both perform silently. The best I
could say for Mr. Marceau's humor
is that at times it seems like Thurber
at his worst.
Pantomime is enormously inter
esting in a tedious sort of way.

CLEVER UNCLE
The show seemed not so much a
triumph in maintaining the precari
ous balance between complex for
malisms and vital expression; it
seemed like a clever uncle doing
after-dinner tricks — for two solid
hours.
More important, Mr. Marceau for
the most part captured only the sur
face characteristics of the landscape
and of life. It was clever of him to
populate a park with old ladies knit
ting, children playing ball, a woman
wheeling a baby carriage. But it was
a cleverness without much beyond
the standard insights into the sur
roundings.
POIGNANT PERCEPTION
There was an amusingly theatrical
bit called "David and Goliath" and
two other picces I found satisfying:
"Youth, Maturity, Old Age and
Death" was really exquisite and did
capture in a few gestures and move
ments a sensitive and poignant per
ception of life.
"Bip and the Butterfly" Likewise
created a feeling of delicacy and
poetic sensitivity.
The justification for comparing
Mr. Marceau to Charlie Chaplin
seems limited to the fact that they
both perform silently. The best I
could say for Mr. Marceau's humor
is that at times it seems like Thurber
at his worst.
Pantomime is enormously inter
esting in a tedious sort of way.

Connoisseurs of the inconsequential will be delighted to learn
that the world's greatest living pantomimist is in San Francisco.
In fairness it should be mentioned that this is a minority report
on Marcel Marceau's achievements as an entertainer, dissenting
from the views expressed by the New York critics ("joyously

♦■lunny, a genius of Chaplin s stat
ure"), the Boston critics ("a truly
great clown"), the Philadelphia crit
ics ("very gay and infectious"), the
Los Angeles critics ("ahead of ad
miration comes laughter—bountiful
laughter") and the opening night
crowd at the Geary that gave him
seven curtain calls and a celebra
tion banquet.
1 could not see what all the hoop-
La was about. The severe limitations
ol pantomime, no words, no assist-

ants, bare props,
plain white cos
