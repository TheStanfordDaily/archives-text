# Site to Be Cleared For New Buildings
## 
### 
Workmen will begin this week to
raze the duplex residence on the
southvwest corner ol' Lasuen and San
ta Teresa streets.
The site is being cleared in prep
aration for future construction of
several buildings in the vicinity.
Among these will be a music build
ing, a new post office and a student
activities center.
A small cottage on the site also
will be demolished or moved to an
other location off campus. The larger
residence was built in the early days
of the University and once served as
the home of Stanford's third presi
dent, Ray Lyman Wilbur. It was
later divided into apartments which
faculty members occupied.
