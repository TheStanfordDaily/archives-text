# KA's Edge Theta Chi To Open Mural Season
## 
### KERMIT OLSON 
Kappa Alpha managed to edge past the Theta Chi five last night
in the final 30 seconds to take a 25-24 mural opener for both the
clubs.
KA's Tim Foraker opened the game's scoring within a minute
of the opening jump, stepping to the charity line and dumping a

toss. This was countered by Theta
Chi's Jim Smith, who pumped 25
feet for a field goal. Foraker would
have nothing of this; turning, jump
ing and scoring from inside the key.
The score went back and forth until
AJ Laubscher grabbed off a loose
pass and went all the way, giving
Theta Chi a 10-8 halftime margin.
Both squads demonstrated that
they had not been on the hardwoods
for some time, as many shots found
it difficult to slip through the cords.
The halftime intermission seemed
enough for the squads to regain
some of their potential, as Phil
Hughes and Bill Carls opened the
period with two quick markers to
give KA a 12-10 lead. The scoring
see-sawed again with Dick Walter
or Bob Hodge of Theta Chi hitting
underneath, only to be matched by
the efforts of Foraker, Hughes and
Carls of the opposition.
With Theta Chi controlling a 24-23
lead, and a half a minute remaining,
Foraker slipped the ball off of the
corner of the board into the cage for
the winning tally. A frantic quick
bi'eak by Theta Chi was broken up

at the buzzer, giving a final count
ol' 25-24 and a KA victory in their
Initial start.
Tim Foraker's 11-point effort was
best for the evening, followed by
Dick Walker with 8. Plaudirt-s must
be extended for the tatter's rebound
ing efforts, as with a definite deficit
in the height column he came down
with a remarkable number of shots.
A 1 LauibsCher of Theta Chi and Bob
Peabody of KA were the floor lead
ers.

they had not been on the hardwoods
for some time, as many shots found
it difficult to slip through the cords.
The halftime intermission seemed
enough for the squads to regain
some of their potential, as Phil
Hughes and Bill Carls opened the
period with two quick markers to
give KA a 12-10 lead. The scoring
see-sawed again with Dick Walter
or Bob Hodge of Theta Chi hitting
underneath, only to be matched by
the efforts of Foraker, Hughes and
Carls of the opposition.
With Theta Chi controlling a 24-23
lead, and a half a minute remaining,
Foraker slipped the ball off of the
corner of the board into the cage for
the winning tally. A frantic quick
bi'eak by Theta Chi was broken up

at the buzzer, giving a final count
ol' 25-24 and a KA victory in their
Initial start.
Tim Foraker's 11-point effort was
best for the evening, followed by
Dick Walker with 8. Plaudirt-s must
be extended for the tatter's rebound
ing efforts, as with a definite deficit
in the height column he came down
with a remarkable number of shots.
A 1 LauibsCher of Theta Chi and Bob
Peabody of KA were the floor lead
ers.

Kappa Alpha managed to edge past the Theta Chi five last night
in the final 30 seconds to take a 25-24 mural opener for both the
clubs.
KA's Tim Foraker opened the game's scoring within a minute
of the opening jump, stepping to the charity line and dumping a

toss. This was countered by Theta
Chi's Jim Smith, who pumped 25
feet for a field goal. Foraker would
have nothing of this; turning, jump
ing and scoring from inside the key.
The score went back and forth until
AJ Laubscher grabbed off a loose
pass and went all the way, giving
Theta Chi a 10-8 halftime margin.
Both squads demonstrated that
they had not been on the hardwoods
for some time, as many shots found
it difficult to slip through the cords.
