# Bruins Lead Team Statistics In PC Conference Scramble
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball quintet
is in second place in one Pacific
Coast Conference statistic this
week and third in another but
the league-leading UCLA Bruins
are running away with the in
dividual and team statistics so
far this season.
In total offense, where Coach John
Wooden's five shines the most, the
Bruins have averaged 20 points a
game better than their nearest rival
in the conference. In the rebounds
department the Bruins are leading
by an equally subtsantial margin.
With Willie (The Whale) Naulls
leading the way, the Uclans have
grabbed off 224 rebounds to 139 for

four opponents. Two other depart
ments, field goal percentage and free
throws, show UCLA to be third and
fourth in the league respectively
The leaders for the other depart
ments include the Washington Hus
kies, tops in defense and in limiting
their opponents to the lowest field
goal percentage; Idaho's Vandals in
free throws; and Oregon in most
field goals.
UCLA, in averaging 87.8 points a
game, is far out in front of runner
up Southern Cal with 67.5 points
scored each game. Close behind the
Trojans is Idaho with 66 points a
game. Appropriately enough, UCLA's
Morris Taft is the individual scoring
leader in the conference, averaging
26.3 points a game.
