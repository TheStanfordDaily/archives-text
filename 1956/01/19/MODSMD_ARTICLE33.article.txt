## Weiershauser Retires As Card Cinder Coach 
### BOB MIEROW 
When Jack Weiershauser an
nounced his resignation as head
track and field coach at Stan
ford, it marked the first time
since World War II that the
Cards have had to look for a
new spike coach.
Weiershauser, who will step down
in August following the 1956 cinder
season, has been leading Stanford
trackmen since 1946. This season
will mark Jack's eleventh at the
Indian helm.
Although Weiershauser's charges
have competed in the toughest track
conference in the nation, they have
gained a very respectable record.
The mere thought of having to face
powerful USC every year is enough
to freeze the blood of many spike
mentors.
Outside of competition with the
Trojans, perennial national cham
pions, Weiershauser's Indian squads
have captured nine victories against
nine setbacks in PCC meets.
The husky track chief, who bossed
Washington State's spikers before
coming to the Farm, was a tremen
dous runner while at Stanford. Wei
ershauser sprinted and hurdled for
the Tribe outfit in 1936 and 1937.
Jack holds the school record for
the 220 with a time of 20.7. While
winning the NCAA championship in
1937, Weiershauser turned in a bril

liant 20.9 around one turn.
Other times which he made while
an undergraduate were 9.8 for the
100, 47.5 in the 440 and 23.2 for the
220 low hurdles. Weiershauser an
chored Stanford's half - mile relay
team to a world record in 1937.
While lxjssing the Card tracksters,
Jack coached many outstanding ath
letes. Foremost among these was
probably Bob Mathias, two - time
Olympic decathlon champion.
Mathias, one of the world's great
est all-around athletes of all time,
twice iet the decathlon record while
a Stanford student. As a Card per
former, Mathias ran the hurdles in
14.2 and 23.2, put the shot over 51
feet and excelled in other weight
events and jumping.
World record javelin thrower
Franklin (Bud) Held \vas another
of Weiershauser's charges. Held set
the mark with a 263-10 throw in
1953.
Gay Bryan, another of Stanford's
most versatile athletes, pulled many
a first place for Weiershauser. Bryan,
a sprinter, hurdler and jumper,
grabbed as many as five victories in
a single meet. Bryan, like his coach
when he had participated, was dub
bed "Iron Man" by local sports
writers.
Before taking on the track boss
job on the Farm, Weiershauser serv
ed at Del Monte and St. Max*y's pre
flight schools and in the Pacific as a
naval lieutenant.
