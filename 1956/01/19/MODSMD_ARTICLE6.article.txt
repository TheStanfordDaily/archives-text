# Winter Charity Drive to Get Proceeds from Jazz Concert
## 
### 
azz by Dave Brubeck and his band will be on hand to
help swell the total of the Winter Quarter Charity Drive when they
appear at Memorial Auditorium Saturday from 3 to 5 p.m.
Tickets are on sale at the ASSU office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
at the Engineering Corner from 10 to 3. No refunds will be made after
today.
Brubeck, who plays piano, is joined in his band by Joe Dodge,
drums; Paul Desmond, saxophone; and Norman Bates, bass.
Brubeck has won the Downbeat Poll and the Metronome Poll for
his progressive jazz. He was featured on the cover of Time magazine
last year.
Record albums he has made include ",Jazz Goes to College," "Red
Hot and Cool" and "Jazz at Oberlin." He has his own record company,
Fantasy Records.
He is one of the few men to graduate from Mills College, having
studied there under Darius Milhaud. He has been both condemned and
praised by many critics- but none have been able to ignore him.
According to Dick Elkus, who has been working on the concert, if
enough money is raised part of the proceeds will be used to help flood
victims. Other proceed money will go to the foreign scholarship and
the Winter Relief Drive.
