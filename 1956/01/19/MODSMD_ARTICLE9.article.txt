## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS â€”Louisiana re
versed its political field today and
returned solidly to the "crossroads"
government founded by the late
Huey P. Long and now espoused by
his brother.
Almost complete returns from
yesterday's- Democratic primary, the
only election that counts in this
state ,gave former Governor Earl K.
Long a sweeping victory over four
opponents in the contest for Gov
ernor. His majority over the field

obviates a runoff.
With 1.948 of the state's 2,039 pre
cincts reporting, Long had .'591,380
votes to 177,248 for New Orleans
Mayor DeLesseps (Chep) Morrison;
90,032 for Fred T. Preaus; 57,601 for
Francis C. Grevemberg, and 43,713
for James McLemore.
Long took on the dominant per
sonalities and issues that have fig
ured in state government in the 20
years since his "Kingfish" brother
was assassinated and bested them
all.
