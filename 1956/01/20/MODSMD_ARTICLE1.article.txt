# SUE Poll Gives Top Rank To 57% of Stanford Faculty
## Quality of Undergraduate Instruction Rated In Each Department by June Graduates 
### 
Looking back at the instruction they received as undergradu
ates, last year's graduating seniors ranked about 57 per cent of
their teachers as "good" or "outstanding."
The remaining 43 per cent were consigned to "fair" or "poor"
classifications.
This is one of the results of last June's senior questionnaires,

►"which were distributed to the stu
dents by the Study of Undergradu
ate Education student committee.
The questionnaire is part of the SUE
project of re-evaluating Stanford's
u nde rgrad uate program.
The following question appeared
on the questionnaire:
"Listed below are all of the de
partments within the Division of
Humanities and Sciences, together
wirh those professional schools offer
ing undergraduate courses. Please
indicate in the appropriate column
the number of teachers you have
had in each department who., as well
as you remember them, fall into the
following categories: outstanding,
good, fair, poor."
fiO PER CENT FAVORABLE
The statistics, released by Dr.
Robert Hoopes, present SUE head,
are tabulated in percentages. Al
though the majority of departments
follow the percentage split of about
60 per cent outstanding-good and 40
per cent fair-poor, there are marked
exceptions on both sides.
The history and humanities de
partments take all-around honors.
The 600 students replying gave 1768
rankings—the highest" total—to the
history department, and placed over
75 per cent of the teachers in the
out;tanding-good bracket.
The humanities (special progTams)
received the highest favorable per
centage, but on a smaller scale, with
around 80 per cent of the students
ranking their teachers in the two
higher categories.
Other subjects with high "out
standing-good" ratings are art and
architecture, 70 per cent; Asiatic
and Slavic studies. 80 per cent; bio
logical sciences, more than 70 per
cent; German, 70 per cent; music,
70 per cent; philosophy, 70 per cent;
physics, 73 per cent.

On the other side, military and air
sciences were lowest ranked. About
71 per cent of the air science in
structors were rated fair or poor,
with 69 pei* cent of the military sci
ence teachers in the saflie category.
Naval science, in the opinion of
the seniors, did much better, with
38 per cent receiving the low rank
ing.
Other weak points, as indicated
by "fair-poor" category percentages,
are sociology and anthropology, 65
per cent; economics, 50 per cent; and
French, 49 per cent.
In the English and journalism de
partments the men and women split
in their opinions. For English, 50
per cent of the women and 56 per
cent of the men gave the instructors
the fair-poor rating, and in jour
nalism the low categories were as
signed by 60 per cent of the women
and 44 per cent of the men.

engineering, 65 per cent; classics, 60
