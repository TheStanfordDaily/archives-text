# Campus to Go Modern; Brubeck Is on the Way
## Top Jazz Quartet To Give Mem Aud Show Tomorrow 
### 
Music in the modern vein will
play philanthropist tomorrow
when Dave Brubeck and com
pany give a benefit concert in
Memorial Auditorium.
Brubeck will give his progressive
music concert under the auspices of
the junior class. Starting time is 3
p.m.
Three hundred tickets are still on
sale, according to concert chairman
Dave Elkus. They will be yj>ld at the
door from 1 to 3 p.m. only and no
refunds will be made, according to
Elkus.
No seats are reserved.
Brubeck brings his progressive
jazz quartet along with him, includ
ing Paul Desmond, alto sax; Norman
Bates, bass, and Joe Dodge, drums.
Brubeck has done other college
concerts. Two records in which he
is featured are "Jazz at Oberlin" and
"Jazz Goes to College."
Benefits from the performance will
go to several organizations, accord
ing to Elkus. The World University
Service has been guaranteed at least
$150, the chairman said, with as yet
undetermined amounts slated for the
Stanford Foreign Scholarship fund
and flood relief.
Brubeck has not only played at
college—he's gone there. He is one
of the few men to be graduated from
Mills College, the East Bay women's
college.
He studied there under Darius
Milhaud.
Controversy over Brubeck's style
of music has been raging from al
most the first moment he sat down
at his progressive piano. Some call
his music "art," some say it is mere
ly "discordant jazz."
He has won popularity polls in
both Downbeat and Metronome
magazines. Time called him a "mu
sician's musician" in a cover story
last year.
Tomorrow's concert will mark the
first time Stanford has been exposod
to progressive music. Last year the
class of '57 sponsored a benefit con
cert featuring popular musician Har
ry James.
After Brubeck leaves Stanford ho
is scheduled for other college ap
pearances.
