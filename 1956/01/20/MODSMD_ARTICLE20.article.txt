# Scare Shows Not $650 for WUS

### 
''Dracula" and "Frankenstein" net
ted the WUS drive about $650, ac
cording to Drive Treasurer Norman
Kibbe.
"However, the greatest part of our
money will come from student con
tributions next week," Kibbe said.
"The projects, such as the Ugly Man
Contest, the movies and the weigh
ing of Dean Winbigler won't bring
in much. Their purpose is mostly
just to acquaint people with WUS."
Kibbe mentioned that a short film
on the aims of the WUS drive was
originally intended to be shown with
the two horror films. However,
"Dracula" and "Frankenstein" ran
too close to lockout time, and the
plan had to be dropped.
