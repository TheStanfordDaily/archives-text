## World Music Owes Much To Italy, Says De Bellis 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
Italy has made great, but largely unrecognized contributions to
Western music, stated Frank de Bellis, expert on Italian music,
In his speech, De Bellis said that researchers have just begun
to discover storehouses of music never printed in modern times

which could be of material value to'
Italy and cultural value to the entire
world.
De Bellis spoke yesterday at the
first of a series of cultural talks
sponsored by the Institute of Inter
national Relations.
New manuscripts of sacred music,
one of Italy's main contributions to
composition, are hidden away in
many Italian cities.
The Ambrosian chant, later sup
planted by the Gregorian, was origi
nated in Rome, and taken from there
all over Europe by monks and
clergy.
ITALIAN FORM
All medieval music was written
in the Italian form, and a new form
originated by St. Francis, "laudes
spirituales," was used for proces
sionals. These provided the roots of
Protestant reformation chorales.
Probably the best-known compos
er of this music was Palestrina, who
was venerated by Wagner, Mozart,
Beethoven, and Debussy, said De
Bellis.
"He was one of the three or four
greatest musical minds the world
has ever known," the expert stated.
Developments that came from
church music were the staff and
clef systems, the classic oratorio, and
the cantata mass. There is grea4, ac
tivity today in ftalian church music,
added De Bellis, and festivals are
held where new works are per
formed.
A second field which Italy has led
is secular music, according to De
Bellis. Trovatore songs and madri
gals were the first to make their
appearance; the latter grew into the
predecessor of the comic opera.
"The madrigal, which appeared
under many names such as song,
sonet, cantonet and ayre, contained
color, word painting, dramatic ef
fects, and modulations not encoun
tered again until Wagner," said De
Bellis.
ITALIANS CREATE OPERA
A group of Italian artists created
the first grand opera, which became
so popular that private theaters were
built to house it. Monteverdi made
it a work of art, introducing such
improvements as preludes, a larger
orchestra, the violin, overtures, and
duets.
"All reforms since have returned
to his precepts," said De Bellis. "He
made opera so complete that nothing
has been added to it. All innova
tions go back to his music."
Rossini, Verdi and Puccini were
the main masters of grand opera,
said De Bellis. Mozart, Handel and
Gluck were so influenced by it that
they wrote all their music in Italian.
The final main contribution of
Italy to music was in instruments.
In 1500 the violin was invented there
and Bologna became the center of
stringed music. Niccolo Amati was
one of the finest violin craftsmen and
Stradivari, his pupil, brought the
instrument to its perfection, accord
ing to De Bellis.
Keyboard instruments also devel
oped in Italy.
