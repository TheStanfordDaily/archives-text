### 
One car was completely wrecked
and another badly damaged in a
collision near the intersection of
Mayfield Avenue and Junipero Serra
Boulevard early yesterday morning.
The accident occurred when the
car driven by James Wilherell, Phi
Gamma Delta, crashed into the rear
of a car driven by Derek Oatway,
Kappa Sigma, while Oatway was
turning around.
Oatway's companion, Alan Tib
betts, Kappa Sigma, was flung from
the car. No one was seriously in
jured; however, Tibbetts was ti*eated
at the Palo Alto Hospital for minor
cuts and abrasions.
Witherell described his car as a
"total wreck" and stated that Oat
way's car, a 1953 Mercury conver
tible, was "accordion pleated."
The case was handled by the Cali
fornia Highway Patrol.
