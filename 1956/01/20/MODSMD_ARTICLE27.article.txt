Pending the verdict from a jury of medical
advisers, President Eisenhower will soon cast
his long-awaited decision, thus solving the na
tion's number one political mystery.
Should the answer be in the affirmative,
there will be a prolonged sigh of relief from
jittery Republican leaders who see in Eisen
hower their only chance of re-knitting party
leadership and presenting to the voters a win
ning candidate.
But behind the rejoicing will lie serious
doubts as to whether a man suffering a heart
, it lack at the age of 64 is physically able to as
: time the ever-more-burdening duties of the
Presidency.
Despite assurances that Eisenhower has re
covered sufficiently to undertake four more
years in the White House, there is little doubt
that his duties will' be substantially reduced.
Even more than before, he will be a formula
tor of general policy, leaving specific but im
portant decisions to his subordinates.
Because of the demands of party politics, he
has and probably will continue to draw into
j lis staff men who, if given the chance, would
pursue action decidedly out of time with Eisen
hower's broad policies.
We have already seen the harmful results of
incongruity in Administration policy resulting
from the appointment of such figures as John
Foster Dulles, Lewis Strauss (head of the Atom
ic Energy Commission) and Arthur Radford
(head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff).
Inseriing into Eisenhower's broad schemes
for a durable and lasting peace such epithets
as "agonizing reappraisal" of our support to
allies and suggesting that the Administration
has brought the world to the verge of war three

times in the last three years, Dulles has left our
allies with serious doubts as to our maturity
and capability in the handling of foreign pol
icy.
Seldom has there been a greater need for a
dynamic leadership in foreign affairs, intelli
gent co-ordination among the various execu
tive departments and a strong guiding hand
over Congress.
Yet now there is talk of diminishing this lead
ership by many persons who, whether or not
they would like to admit it, are seeking to
mold the Presidency to fit the man rather than
the man to fit the Presidency.
If the strains on the President have grown in
the past few years, they have been caused by
phenomena that will not be changed, by a re
duction in the leader's duties.
It is very likely that the President's decision
is not waiting merely upon the word from his
medical staff, but rather that he is battling
within himself over his "duty" to party and
country to reassume national leadership and
the obvious fact that his diminished leadership
and the possibility of another heart attack may
do infinite damage to the government's soli
darity and position abroad.
Should he not run, he knows that his party
may be crippled by rivaling factions with the
possible ascendancy of the ever-active right
wing to the dominant position.
The American people as well as the Presi
dent have a great choice before them. They
have seen that the conception of the "indis
pensable man" is fallible and they must redi
rect their attentions to the issues and principles
upon which our leaders act.

as "agonizing reappraisal" of our support to
allies and suggesting that the Administration
has brought the world to the verge of war three

times in the last three years, Dulles has left our
allies with serious doubts as to our maturity
and capability in the handling of foreign pol
icy.
Seldom has there been a greater need for a
dynamic leadership in foreign affairs, intelli
gent co-ordination among the various execu
tive departments and a strong guiding hand
over Congress.
Yet now there is talk of diminishing this lead
ership by many persons who, whether or not
they would like to admit it, are seeking to
mold the Presidency to fit the man rather than
the man to fit the Presidency.
If the strains on the President have grown in
the past few years, they have been caused by
phenomena that will not be changed, by a re
duction in the leader's duties.
It is very likely that the President's decision
is not waiting merely upon the word from his
medical staff, but rather that he is battling
within himself over his "duty" to party and
country to reassume national leadership and
the obvious fact that his diminished leadership
and the possibility of another heart attack may
do infinite damage to the government's soli
darity and position abroad.
Should he not run, he knows that his party
may be crippled by rivaling factions with the
possible ascendancy of the ever-active right
wing to the dominant position.
The American people as well as the Presi
dent have a great choice before them. They
have seen that the conception of the "indis
pensable man" is fallible and they must redi
rect their attentions to the issues and principles
upon which our leaders act.
Pending the verdict from a jury of medical
advisers, President Eisenhower will soon cast
his long-awaited decision, thus solving the na
tion's number one political mystery.
Should the answer be in the affirmative,
there will be a prolonged sigh of relief from
jittery Republican leaders who see in Eisen
hower their only chance of re-knitting party
leadership and presenting to the voters a win
ning candidate.
But behind the rejoicing will lie serious
doubts as to whether a man suffering a heart
, it lack at the age of 64 is physically able to as
: time the ever-more-burdening duties of the
Presidency.
Despite assurances that Eisenhower has re
covered sufficiently to undertake four more
years in the White House, there is little doubt
that his duties will' be substantially reduced.
Even more than before, he will be a formula
tor of general policy, leaving specific but im
portant decisions to his subordinates.
Because of the demands of party politics, he
has and probably will continue to draw into
j lis staff men who, if given the chance, would
pursue action decidedly out of time with Eisen
hower's broad policies.
We have already seen the harmful results of
incongruity in Administration policy resulting
from the appointment of such figures as John
Foster Dulles, Lewis Strauss (head of the Atom
ic Energy Commission) and Arthur Radford
(head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff).
Inseriing into Eisenhower's broad schemes
for a durable and lasting peace such epithets
as "agonizing reappraisal" of our support to
allies and suggesting that the Administration
