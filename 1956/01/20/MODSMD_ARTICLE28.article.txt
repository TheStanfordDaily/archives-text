To the Editor:
In The Daily of Jan. 19, an article on the fror.t
1 <e cemed to be condemning the Legislature for
Filing to act upon the matter of the Axe Society's
activities handbook. The circumstances of the tabling
of that question should be noted in order to present
the student body with the actual situation.
Mo t of the time allotted to LASSU's last meeting
v..!S dedicated to a discussion with Dr. | Rixford K.j
Snyder concerning admission policies. When the ac
tivities handbook was finally presented, it was tabled
after a motion to that effect by the editor of The Daily
in order toibring up the vital question of the approval
of *he Daily bylaws.
I am indeed proud to be represented by a Legis
lature :• o above reproach that The Daily, in order to
voice an editorial complaint, must create the sit.ua
t m itself. I am sure that the Legislature appreciates
your left-handed compliment. Keep up the good
worl^.

(f'.'iitor's Note: If Mr. Hammer had attended the
meeting—wc do not recall seeing him there—he
would have been aware that the Daily editor moved
lh;»t the student financial manager be directed to
include in his budget for next year enough money
to print 2000 copies of the handbook for October
distribution.
(lhe Daily editor followed that motion with an
other motion to table, which passed, when it was
evident that some new members of the Legislature
h«tc not clear as to what the proposed handbook
was.
(Additionally, another long discussion appeared
likely. With some important business on the agenda,
:;tl minutes before dinner seemed like too late in
the afternoon to begin.
(That important business was the report by the
chairman of the Traffic Committee. The question
of Daily bylaws, because it was vital to Tuesday's
election of the next editor, would have been acted
upon no matter how long the session lasted. It only
required rubber stamping, anyway.
(The Daily headline yesterday was inaccurate.
The legislature did decide something—not to print
lhe handbook this year, and also indicated a desire

freshmen.)
a disgrace
To the Editor:
I can't stand it. Fire him! Kill him! Bury him!
F it iiim out of our misery. I am referring to your
e to- med drama critic Mr. Richard Monde. He is a
<!i race to your paper, your readers and the Univer
ty. He may perhaps be of some use to the science
i partment in that I have no doubt he possesses one
ol the smallest brains so far encountered by man.
Mr. Monde's review on Marcel Marccau shows a
eon plete lack of taste, understanding and common
< n -\ May I respectfully suggest that future critics
' ,;iv < some knowledge of the subject which they arc
reviewing.
Mr. Marccau is undoubtedly one of the world's
: teal talents, as Mr. Mende mentioned what every
eritic ha . said. I can understand Mr. Mende's dislike
lot Marccau, as Mende is obviously of the Cinema
0 op. stereophonic sound set, but 1 cannot conceive
of him not appreciating ithe great talent of this man.
IIi- re i ons are absurd. It's like looking at, the Venus
- > VI !o and saying, "What a babe! But I don't dig
the art form."
Mr. Mende's chief objection seems to be that Mar
' 11 on the stage with only two assistants (during
v 1 ' time Mende must have been across the street,
v u ling Can-Can." as he didn't even acknowledge
their existence) and that he uses very few props.
1 ; i < iin e Mr. Mende would also object to Mr. Jascha
He let/, who uses no assistants and only a violin, or
• li Arthur Rubinstein, who seems to get by on only
one piano.
H Mi. Mende know anything about pantomime,
In would know it. is one of the most unlimited forms
of art. Mi Marccau is a man who has played with
cnthu lastic response tall over the world. He can
e ipture in a moment what takes a novelist many
volumes. I would like Mr. Mende to name me otic

other art form which can accomplish this.
He criticizes Marceau's superficial antics and their
simplicity. Perhaps Mende is not aware that the
foundation of all great ant is simplicity and that Mar
ceau has captured in a movement of the hand or eye
brow an entire human personality. I find it difficult
to imagine anything more penetrating.
His comparing him to a juggler is the worst insult
to a masterful performer I have ever heard, it is
completely unjustified as is everything else in the
review. Perhaps he would compare dirty verses to
Shakespeare because they were both written with
a pen.
I have not the space or the desire to say more.
I hope that the newspaper of a school I am proud of
will not in the future disgrace that school by al
lowing Mr. Mende in print again.
WARNER LE ROY
(Editor's Note: Spurred by Mr. LeRoy's "gentle
reprimand," Mr. Mende was sent searching, in his
own words, "for another human to share in the
disgrace of not appreciating the world's greatest
pantoniimist,"
(Mr. Mende added: "To my knowledge, there arc
but two—Walter Winchell, who described Marccau
as the country's most 'exciting bore,' and Wollcott
Gibhs of The New Yorker, who borrowed that
phrase but added the word 'intermittent.' Uneasy
company, to be sure, but company nevertheless.
("Sifting through the letter reveals that his ob
jection to the review was that I disliked Mr. Mar
ceau's art because it was simple. A casual reading
of the review will show this was not my objec
tion."
(Mr. Mende feels that the art form is limited and
that Marccau did not do very well within that
form.)

cannibalism
To the Editor:
In all my aesthetic history, I have never conic
across the absurd contrast which I have just wit
nessed. . . . Here, right under the .students' noses, a
vista of cannibalism exists which as yet has passed
unnoticed. It is my position to expose this fiendish
exchange, in the hopes that, once enlightened, group
pressure will come to the aid of decency and rid Lhe
campus of such childish acts.
The contrast I am referring to concerns a fra
ternity house and a girls' house. The interaction be
tween 'these two edifices this past week has been what
has shocked me so. For the mere sake of laughter,
animals, dead or alive, have been exchanged, each
animal becoming larger and/or more grotesque. Now,
here is the shocker: these creatures were captured
only lor the purpose of jokes, and thereafter were
left to the elements. Whether or not they perished
was no concern to the laughing monsters who re
moved them from their creature groups.
Cannot the admissions office screen out those who
have suoh immature tendencies? Or perhaps is it
that the students are left with nothing to do after
class? . . .
It was Paul Morphy who once said, "Let the wom
an hew. re who toys with folly." Bravo! These women
involved with the exchange of creatures toyed with
folly, and they certainly do have cause to beware.
I fear I have spoken too long, but this institution
cannot tolerate such outbreaks of anti-intellectualism
or it will not longer hold its high international repu
tation. May it never happen again; if it does, the
whole may suffer because of some wretched parts.

a disgrace
To the Editor:
I can't stand it. Fire him! Kill him! Bury him!
F it iiim out of our misery. I am referring to your
e to- med drama critic Mr. Richard Monde. He is a
<!i race to your paper, your readers and the Univer
ty. He may perhaps be of some use to the science
i partment in that I have no doubt he possesses one
ol the smallest brains so far encountered by man.
Mr. Monde's review on Marcel Marccau shows a
eon plete lack of taste, understanding and common
< n -\ May I respectfully suggest that future critics
' ,;iv < some knowledge of the subject which they arc
reviewing.
Mr. Marccau is undoubtedly one of the world's
: teal talents, as Mr. Mende mentioned what every
eritic ha . said. I can understand Mr. Mende's dislike
lot Marccau, as Mende is obviously of the Cinema
0 op. stereophonic sound set, but 1 cannot conceive
of him not appreciating ithe great talent of this man.
IIi- re i ons are absurd. It's like looking at, the Venus
- > VI !o and saying, "What a babe! But I don't dig
the art form."
Mr. Mende's chief objection seems to be that Mar
' 11 on the stage with only two assistants (during
v 1 ' time Mende must have been across the street,
v u ling Can-Can." as he didn't even acknowledge
their existence) and that he uses very few props.
1 ; i < iin e Mr. Mende would also object to Mr. Jascha
He let/, who uses no assistants and only a violin, or
• li Arthur Rubinstein, who seems to get by on only
one piano.
H Mi. Mende know anything about pantomime,
In would know it. is one of the most unlimited forms
of art. Mi Marccau is a man who has played with
cnthu lastic response tall over the world. He can
e ipture in a moment what takes a novelist many
volumes. I would like Mr. Mende to name me otic

other art form which can accomplish this.
He criticizes Marceau's superficial antics and their
simplicity. Perhaps Mende is not aware that the
foundation of all great ant is simplicity and that Mar
ceau has captured in a movement of the hand or eye
brow an entire human personality. I find it difficult
to imagine anything more penetrating.
His comparing him to a juggler is the worst insult
to a masterful performer I have ever heard, it is
completely unjustified as is everything else in the
review. Perhaps he would compare dirty verses to
Shakespeare because they were both written with
a pen.
I have not the space or the desire to say more.
I hope that the newspaper of a school I am proud of
will not in the future disgrace that school by al
lowing Mr. Mende in print again.

(Editor's Note: Spurred by Mr. LeRoy's "gentle
reprimand," Mr. Mende was sent searching, in his
own words, "for another human to share in the
disgrace of not appreciating the world's greatest
pantoniimist,"
(Mr. Mende added: "To my knowledge, there arc
but two—Walter Winchell, who described Marccau
as the country's most 'exciting bore,' and Wollcott
Gibhs of The New Yorker, who borrowed that
phrase but added the word 'intermittent.' Uneasy
company, to be sure, but company nevertheless.
("Sifting through the letter reveals that his ob

that Marccau did not do very well within that
form.)

animals, dead or alive, have been exchanged, each

here is the shocker: these creatures were captured

left to the elements. Whether or not they perished
was no concern to the laughing monsters who re

a disgrace
To the Editor:
I can't stand it. Fire him! Kill him! Bury him!
F it iiim out of our misery. I am referring to your
e to- med drama critic Mr. Richard Monde. He is a
<!i race to your paper, your readers and the Univer
ty. He may perhaps be of some use to the science
i partment in that I have no doubt he possesses one
ol the smallest brains so far encountered by man.
Mr. Monde's review on Marcel Marccau shows a
eon plete lack of taste, understanding and common
< n -\ May I respectfully suggest that future critics
' ,;iv < some knowledge of the subject which they arc
reviewing.
Mr. Marccau is undoubtedly one of the world's
: teal talents, as Mr. Mende mentioned what every
eritic ha . said. I can understand Mr. Mende's dislike
lot Marccau, as Mende is obviously of the Cinema
0 op. stereophonic sound set, but 1 cannot conceive
of him not appreciating ithe great talent of this man.
IIi- re i ons are absurd. It's like looking at, the Venus
- > VI !o and saying, "What a babe! But I don't dig
the art form."
Mr. Mende's chief objection seems to be that Mar
' 11 on the stage with only two assistants (during
v 1 ' time Mende must have been across the street,
v u ling Can-Can." as he didn't even acknowledge
their existence) and that he uses very few props.
1 ; i < iin e Mr. Mende would also object to Mr. Jascha
He let/, who uses no assistants and only a violin, or
• li Arthur Rubinstein, who seems to get by on only
one piano.
H Mi. Mende know anything about pantomime,
In would know it. is one of the most unlimited forms
of art. Mi Marccau is a man who has played with
cnthu lastic response tall over the world. He can
e ipture in a moment what takes a novelist many
volumes. I would like Mr. Mende to name me otic

other art form which can accomplish this.
He criticizes Marceau's superficial antics and their
simplicity. Perhaps Mende is not aware that the
foundation of all great ant is simplicity and that Mar
ceau has captured in a movement of the hand or eye
brow an entire human personality. I find it difficult
to imagine anything more penetrating.
His comparing him to a juggler is the worst insult
to a masterful performer I have ever heard, it is
completely unjustified as is everything else in the
review. Perhaps he would compare dirty verses to
Shakespeare because they were both written with
a pen.
I have not the space or the desire to say more.
I hope that the newspaper of a school I am proud of
will not in the future disgrace that school by al
lowing Mr. Mende in print again.

(Editor's Note: Spurred by Mr. LeRoy's "gentle
reprimand," Mr. Mende was sent searching, in his
own words, "for another human to share in the
disgrace of not appreciating the world's greatest
pantoniimist,"
(Mr. Mende added: "To my knowledge, there arc
but two—Walter Winchell, who described Marccau
as the country's most 'exciting bore,' and Wollcott
Gibhs of The New Yorker, who borrowed that
phrase but added the word 'intermittent.' Uneasy
company, to be sure, but company nevertheless.
("Sifting through the letter reveals that his ob

that Marccau did not do very well within that
form.)

a disgrace
To the Editor:
I can't stand it. Fire him! Kill him! Bury him!
F it iiim out of our misery. I am referring to your
e to- med drama critic Mr. Richard Monde. He is a
<!i race to your paper, your readers and the Univer
ty. He may perhaps be of some use to the science
i partment in that I have no doubt he possesses one
ol the smallest brains so far encountered by man.
Mr. Monde's review on Marcel Marccau shows a
eon plete lack of taste, understanding and common
< n -\ May I respectfully suggest that future critics
' ,;iv < some knowledge of the subject which they arc
reviewing.
Mr. Marccau is undoubtedly one of the world's
: teal talents, as Mr. Mende mentioned what every
eritic ha . said. I can understand Mr. Mende's dislike
lot Marccau, as Mende is obviously of the Cinema
0 op. stereophonic sound set, but 1 cannot conceive
of him not appreciating ithe great talent of this man.
IIi- re i ons are absurd. It's like looking at, the Venus
- > VI !o and saying, "What a babe! But I don't dig
the art form."
Mr. Mende's chief objection seems to be that Mar
' 11 on the stage with only two assistants (during
v 1 ' time Mende must have been across the street,
v u ling Can-Can." as he didn't even acknowledge
their existence) and that he uses very few props.
1 ; i < iin e Mr. Mende would also object to Mr. Jascha
He let/, who uses no assistants and only a violin, or
• li Arthur Rubinstein, who seems to get by on only
one piano.
H Mi. Mende know anything about pantomime,
In would know it. is one of the most unlimited forms
of art. Mi Marccau is a man who has played with
cnthu lastic response tall over the world. He can
e ipture in a moment what takes a novelist many
volumes. I would like Mr. Mende to name me otic

other art form which can accomplish this.
He criticizes Marceau's superficial antics and their
simplicity. Perhaps Mende is not aware that the
foundation of all great ant is simplicity and that Mar
ceau has captured in a movement of the hand or eye
brow an entire human personality. I find it difficult
to imagine anything more penetrating.
His comparing him to a juggler is the worst insult
to a masterful performer I have ever heard, it is
completely unjustified as is everything else in the
review. Perhaps he would compare dirty verses to
Shakespeare because they were both written with
a pen.
I have not the space or the desire to say more.
I hope that the newspaper of a school I am proud of
will not in the future disgrace that school by al
lowing Mr. Mende in print again.
WARNER LE ROY
(Editor's Note: Spurred by Mr. LeRoy's "gentle
reprimand," Mr. Mende was sent searching, in his
own words, "for another human to share in the
disgrace of not appreciating the world's greatest
pantoniimist,"
(Mr. Mende added: "To my knowledge, there arc
but two—Walter Winchell, who described Marccau
as the country's most 'exciting bore,' and Wollcott
Gibhs of The New Yorker, who borrowed that
phrase but added the word 'intermittent.' Uneasy
company, to be sure, but company nevertheless.
("Sifting through the letter reveals that his ob
jection to the review was that I disliked Mr. Mar
ceau's art because it was simple. A casual reading
of the review will show this was not my objec
tion."
(Mr. Mende feels that the art form is limited and
that Marccau did not do very well within that
form.)
