# Kismet Is 'Sets, Colors, Loud Noises'-That's All
## Movie Is Actually Dull, Uninteresting; Ostensibly Patterned After Stage Show 
### RICHARD MENDE 
A great many Hollywood musicals, like French pastry, are elab
orate, gaudy creations with all the effort put on the frosting, while
everything beneath the surface is dull and uninteresting.
"Kismet" is like that, bedecked with all manner of alluring trap
pings but seldom managing to be more than tolerable.

Ostensibly patterned after the play
by the same name, "Kismet" is noth
ing m o r e than another Baghdad

inov i e, complete
with harems, vi
ziers, dancing
girls and Techni
color.
Howard Keel
makes frenzied
efforts at appear

ing nonchalant in his rise from beg
gardom to vizierdom, and the script
makes laborious efforts at light wit.
In fairness, the movie managed to
avoid 8 per cent of the cliches pe
culiar to this Hollywood art form.
Here and there an amusing scene
would creep in, the acting would be
come momentarily unoppressive, or
the story would take a turn from
the worst.
The producers claim there was
Borodin background music, but the
music seemed to have the same re
lationship to the composer's inten
tions as the script bore to the origi
nal playâ€”purely coincidental.
Although there was some talk of
the benefits of many wives, the best
argument for polygamy was suggest
ed by the presence of Dolores Gray,
a woman bored with her chubby,
overactive husband. But that is real
ly a prejudiced speculation: perhaps
the product of ennui.
"Kismet" is an insubstantial en
deavor, consisting mostly of lavish
costumes, extravagant sets, bright
colors and loud noises. The result is
not exactly soporific, but it's not
exactly entertainment either.
