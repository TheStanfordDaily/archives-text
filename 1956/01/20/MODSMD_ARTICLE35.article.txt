# Loper Calls Priestley Play 'Melodrama'
## 
### 
Director Robert Loper took a
minute off to talk about J. B.
Priestley's "Dangerous Corner"
which opens jn the Little Thea
ter Wednesday.
"Priestley's plays," he said, "are
not well known in this country, but
'Dangerous Corner' has a theme that
puts it in the main line of such men
as O'Neil and Pirandello. The play
insists that men need illusions in
order to live.
"Not that this is what you'd call
an 'intellectual' play. Priestley isn't
interested in being a philosopher,
and 'Dangerous Corner' is first of all,
and frankly, a melodrama."
"It's one of the most exciting and
well-plotted pieces you could find,"
Loper said. "Incident is piled upon
incident from the very beginning: it
never stops building."
The plot concerns an apparently
happy man who catches his wife in
a trivial lie .about a cigarette box.
On the basis of what is mostly a
whim, he resolves to trace the re
mark to its origin. In doing so he
discovers that almost nothing in his
life is as it seems: beneath the sur
face is a network of evil.
"Friertley is saying," Loper ex
plained, "that the man is ill-advised,
even immoral, to insist at all costs
on knowing the truth. It is this mis
take that almost destroys him."
Tickets for the play continue on
sale at Memorial Ilall Box Oflice
from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m. Price is .$1 for
Wednesday and Thursday, 51.50 for
Friday and Saturday.
