## Explosion Sound Waves Explore Earth's Interior 
### LYNN BRAMKAMP 
How would you like to listen
with a stethoscope to eight tons
of dynamite exploding? That, in
effect, is what Professors Joshua
Soske and George Thompson
do to brighten up their Monday
mornings.
Dr. Soskc, who heads the Salva
tori Laboratory of Geophysics here,
is an expert on explosives. He was
asked by one of the leading oil com
panies to go down to Ventura and
advise them on how to blow up
some abandoned oil wells.
The problem is that the concrete
emplacements of the wells have to
be destroyed without wrecking any
nearby producing wells.
"The casings are surrounded by
piers of reinforced concrete that ex
tend for 40 feet under the waiter,"
says Soske. "We have to use quite a
charge of dynamite to remove them."
Sometimes they use as much as
eight tons in one 'blast.

The main reason for helping to
destroy the wells, according to Dr.
Soskc. is that he and members of
the Geophysical department can uti
lize the shock waves produced by
the explosions to further their stud
ies of the interior of the earth.
When an explosion occurs, it sends
out shock waves in all directions.
A great number pass through the
surface layers of the earth and are
fleeted when they hit rock of a dif
ferent density than that they are
traveling through. These reflections
come back to the surface and are
recorded on highly sensitive instru
ments.
The instruments, similar to seis
mographs, which are used to record
earthquakes, are placed at distances
from the exploi-ions varying from
1500 feet to 1(50 miles. Some of these
instruments are so sensitive they
will record your heart beat if you
stand close to them.
The scientists think they may be
getting recordings from as deep as
20 miles.
