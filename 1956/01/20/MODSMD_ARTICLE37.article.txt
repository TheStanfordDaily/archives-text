## ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 2 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy With Cheek," etc 
Doff your caps and bells; there will be no fun and games this
day. Today, with earnestness and sobriety, we make the second
of our forays into social science. Today we take up the most
basic of all the social sciences—sociology itself.
Sociology teaches us that man is a social animal. It is not his
instincts or his heredity that determine his conduct; it is his
environment. This fact is vividly borne out when one considers
any of the several cases of children who were raised by wild ani
mals. Take, for example, the dossier on Julio Sigafoos.
Julio, abandoned as an infant in a dark wood near Cleveland,
was adopted by a pack of wild dogs and reared as one of their
own. When Julio was found by a hunter at the age of twelve, the
poor child was more canine than human. He ran on all fours,
barked and growled, ate raw meat, lapped water with his tongue,
and could neither speak nor understand one single word. In
short, he was a complete product of his environment,

(Julio, incidentally, was more fortunate than most wild chil
dren. They never become truly humanized, but Julio was excep
tional. Bit by bit, he began to talk and walk and eat and drink
as people do. His long dormant mental processes, when awakened
at last, turned out to be remarkably acute. In fact, he was so
bright that he learned to read and write in a month, got through
grammar school in five years and high school in two. And last
June, as thousands of spectators, knowing Julio's tragic back
ground, stood and cheered, he was graduated valedictorian from
Cal Tech with a degree in astrophysics!
(Who can say to what towering heights this incredible boy
would have risen had he not been killed the day after commence
ment while chasing a car?)
But I digress. To return to sociology, people tend to gather in
groups —a tendency that began, as we all know, with the intro
duction of Philip Morris Cigarettes. What an aid to sociability
they are! How benignly one looks upon his fellows after n puff
of Philip Morris's gentle, pleasant, flavorful tobacco! How eager
it makes one to share, to communicate, to extend the hand of
friendship! How grateful we all are to Philip Morris for mak
ing possible this togetherness! How good not to live in the bleak
pre-Philip Morris world, with every man a stranger!
The groups that people live in today (thanks to Philip Morris)
vary widely in their customs. What is perfectly acceptable in
one society may be outlandish in another. Take, for instance, the
case of Ug Poopoemoogoo.
Ug, a Polynesian lad, grew up in an idyllic South Sea isle
where the leading social event of the year was the feast of Max,
the sun god. A quaint all-day ceremony was held, with tribal
dancing, war chants, fat lady races, pie eating contests, and,
for the grand finale, the sacrifice of two dozen maidens.
According to Ug's folkways, sacrificing maidens was quite
acceptable, but when in his eighteenth year he was sent as an
exchange student to the University of Wisconsin, he soon learned
that Americans take a dim view of this practice—in Wisconsin,
at any rate. The first twelve or thirteen maidens Ug sacrificed,
he was let off with a warning. When, however, he persisted, dras
tic measures were taken-he was de-pledgod by his fraternity.
A broken man, Ug quit school and moved to Milwaukee where
today he earns a meagre living as a stein, ©Max shuim.n. ix>»
