## Selleck, Bond, Brown key Men for Stanford Against Tall OSC Squad; Wagner Heady to Go; Saturday Afternoon Contest to Be Televised 
### LARRY JENSEN 
Sports Editor, The Daily
Coach Howie Dallmar's sec
ond - place Indians journey
northward for the second time
this year as they meet the Ore
gon State College Beavers to
night and tomorrow in Corvallis.
Saturday's game will be televised
at 2 p.m.
Stanford, which currently has a
3-1 conference record, will find itself
up against a tall but young OSC
(team which dropped a pair to South
ern Cal last week in Los Angeles.
Dallmar's surprising Cards, who
have an over-all season record of
10-1, will again be led toy the trio

of Captain George Selleck, Bill Bond
and Barry Brown. All three played
brilliantly last weekend when Stan
ford tipped Idaho twice.
Selleck, current team scoring lead
er with 62 points in conference play,
racked up 35 of those against the
Vandals. In addition he played his
usual outstanding floor game.
Bond, who has finally recovered
from a series of injuries and ill
nesses that limited his effectiveness
in the pre-conference games, hit for
50 points against Idaho, 25 each
night.
Brown again was the Stanford
backboard power. The agile forward
swept the boards on both ends nnd
aided the scoring considerably with
27 points.
The other positions on the Card
five are still up for grabs. Selleck's
running mate at guard will be picked
from the trio of Bill Flanders, Hap
Wagner and Gary Van Galder, and
the center post will go either to Carl
Isaacs or Carlos Bea.
Flanders has improved considera
bly since the start of the season, and

started the last game against the
Vandals.
Van Galder, Dallmar's prize soph
omore, started the first three con
ference games and proved to be an
excellent floor man and an accurate
.shooter, although he has not cast off
many times.
Wagner is just recovering from a
sprained ankle which he suffered
during the pre-conference schedule.
He was the regular guard before his
injury and may make it back into
his old job.
Bea has had the starting nod at
center in every game thus far, but
Isaacs has improved steadily and
has seen more and more action. Both
are sound ball players, but neither
is an outstanding scorer.
FOUR OTHERS
Others who are making the trip
to Corvallis are Beppo Dyer, Dave
Dunn, Ron Wagner and Clint War
ing.
Coach Slats Gill's Beavers are
somewhat like the little girl who
when good was very, very good, but
when she was bad—oh, brother!
The Beavers looked terrible against
USC last weekend, but they have
played some outstanding games this
year. The Orangemen handled a good
Michigan team and came within an
eyelash of beating North Carolina
State, the nation's No. 3 team, in the
Dixie Classic.
OSC got their one conference win
ait the expense of Washington State
in the season's opener.
GAMBEE OUTSTANDING
Leading the Beavers is forward
Dave Gambee, an outstanding soph
omore who stands 6-6. He is the
Beavers' leading scorer and reboun
der and was the leading scorer on
his frosh team. He has a good jump
shot as well as a hook and is ex
tremely dangerous near the basket.
The other forward is 6-3 Larry
Paulus, a two-year letterman. Pau
lus averages only about eight points
a game, but he is a tremendous
jumper around the boards and is the
Beavers' best iball handler.
At center is Wayne Moss, a 6-9
sophomore. Moss is very unpolished,
but is rugged on the boards and is
developing a fair hook. However, he
has a tendency to drop the ball when
he deal's the boards.
NANSON STARTS
Starting guards for the Beavers
will be Ken Nanson and either Gary
Haynes or Jerry Crimins.
Nanson did not make the trip to
Southern Cal last week because of
illness, and that undoubtedly hurt
the OSC club. Nanson, a sophomore,
is the team's second high scorer as
well as being a sharp ball handler.
He is very accurate with his right
handed push shots, which he gets off
extremely fast.
Haynes, the fourth sophomore in
the lineup, will probably get the
other guard. He is 6-2 and a better
ball handler than the 6-0 Crimins.
He has not scored much this year
hut did plenty of hitting for the
frosh squad la&t year.
The games will be played in Ore
gon State's plush Gill Coliseum,
which seats 10,500 people.

HAP WAGNER, junior guard, will see plenty of duty for Ilowie Dall
mar's crew when they tangle with the Oregon State College Beavers
tonight and tomorrow, in Corvallis. Wagner, a starting guard before an
ankle injury stopped him early in the season, may break bark into the
starting five for the weekend action. If not, either Bill Flanders or Gary
Van Galder will start in his place. Stanford will take a 3-1 record in
against the Orangemen who hold a 1-3 mark in conference action.

Selleck, current team scoring lead
er with 62 points in conference play,
racked up 35 of those against the
Vandals. In addition he played his
usual outstanding floor game.
Bond, who has finally recovered
from a series of injuries and ill
nesses that limited his effectiveness
in the pre-conference games, hit for
50 points against Idaho, 25 each
night.
Brown again was the Stanford
backboard power. The agile forward
swept the boards on both ends nnd
aided the scoring considerably with
27 points.
The other positions on the Card
five are still up for grabs. Selleck's
running mate at guard will be picked
from the trio of Bill Flanders, Hap
Wagner and Gary Van Galder, and
the center post will go either to Carl
Isaacs or Carlos Bea.
Flanders has improved considera
bly since the start of the season, and

started the last game against the
Vandals.
Van Galder, Dallmar's prize soph
omore, started the first three con
ference games and proved to be an
excellent floor man and an accurate
.shooter, although he has not cast off
many times.
Wagner is just recovering from a
sprained ankle which he suffered
during the pre-conference schedule.
He was the regular guard before his
injury and may make it back into
his old job.
Bea has had the starting nod at
center in every game thus far, but
Isaacs has improved steadily and
has seen more and more action. Both
are sound ball players, but neither
is an outstanding scorer.
FOUR OTHERS
Others who are making the trip
to Corvallis are Beppo Dyer, Dave
Dunn, Ron Wagner and Clint War
ing.
Coach Slats Gill's Beavers are
somewhat like the little girl who
when good was very, very good, but
when she was bad—oh, brother!
The Beavers looked terrible against
USC last weekend, but they have
played some outstanding games this
year. The Orangemen handled a good
Michigan team and came within an
eyelash of beating North Carolina
State, the nation's No. 3 team, in the
Dixie Classic.
OSC got their one conference win
ait the expense of Washington State
in the season's opener.
GAMBEE OUTSTANDING
Leading the Beavers is forward
Dave Gambee, an outstanding soph
omore who stands 6-6. He is the
Beavers' leading scorer and reboun
der and was the leading scorer on
his frosh team. He has a good jump
shot as well as a hook and is ex
tremely dangerous near the basket.
The other forward is 6-3 Larry
Paulus, a two-year letterman. Pau
lus averages only about eight points
a game, but he is a tremendous
jumper around the boards and is the
Beavers' best iball handler.
At center is Wayne Moss, a 6-9
sophomore. Moss is very unpolished,
but is rugged on the boards and is
developing a fair hook. However, he
has a tendency to drop the ball when
he deal's the boards.
NANSON STARTS
Starting guards for the Beavers
will be Ken Nanson and either Gary
Haynes or Jerry Crimins.
Nanson did not make the trip to
Southern Cal last week because of
illness, and that undoubtedly hurt
the OSC club. Nanson, a sophomore,
is the team's second high scorer as
well as being a sharp ball handler.
He is very accurate with his right
handed push shots, which he gets off
extremely fast.
Haynes, the fourth sophomore in
the lineup, will probably get the
other guard. He is 6-2 and a better
ball handler than the 6-0 Crimins.
He has not scored much this year
hut did plenty of hitting for the
frosh squad la&t year.
The games will be played in Ore
gon State's plush Gill Coliseum,
which seats 10,500 people.

Van Galder, Dallmar's prize soph
omore, started the first three con
ference games and proved to be an
excellent floor man and an accurate
.shooter, although he has not cast off
many times.
Wagner is just recovering from a
sprained ankle which he suffered
during the pre-conference schedule.
He was the regular guard before his
injury and may make it back into
his old job.
Bea has had the starting nod at
center in every game thus far, but
Isaacs has improved steadily and
has seen more and more action. Both
are sound ball players, but neither
is an outstanding scorer.
FOUR OTHERS
Others who are making the trip
to Corvallis are Beppo Dyer, Dave
Dunn, Ron Wagner and Clint War
ing.
Coach Slats Gill's Beavers are
somewhat like the little girl who
when good was very, very good, but
when she was bad—oh, brother!
The Beavers looked terrible against
USC last weekend, but they have
played some outstanding games this
year. The Orangemen handled a good
Michigan team and came within an
eyelash of beating North Carolina
State, the nation's No. 3 team, in the
Dixie Classic.
OSC got their one conference win
ait the expense of Washington State
in the season's opener.
GAMBEE OUTSTANDING
Leading the Beavers is forward
Dave Gambee, an outstanding soph
omore who stands 6-6. He is the
Beavers' leading scorer and reboun
der and was the leading scorer on
his frosh team. He has a good jump
shot as well as a hook and is ex
tremely dangerous near the basket.
The other forward is 6-3 Larry
Paulus, a two-year letterman. Pau
lus averages only about eight points
a game, but he is a tremendous
jumper around the boards and is the
Beavers' best iball handler.
At center is Wayne Moss, a 6-9
sophomore. Moss is very unpolished,
but is rugged on the boards and is
developing a fair hook. However, he
has a tendency to drop the ball when
he deal's the boards.
NANSON STARTS
Starting guards for the Beavers
will be Ken Nanson and either Gary
Haynes or Jerry Crimins.
Nanson did not make the trip to
Southern Cal last week because of
illness, and that undoubtedly hurt
the OSC club. Nanson, a sophomore,
is the team's second high scorer as
well as being a sharp ball handler.
He is very accurate with his right
handed push shots, which he gets off
extremely fast.
Haynes, the fourth sophomore in
the lineup, will probably get the
other guard. He is 6-2 and a better
ball handler than the 6-0 Crimins.
He has not scored much this year
hut did plenty of hitting for the
frosh squad la&t year.
The games will be played in Ore
gon State's plush Gill Coliseum,
which seats 10,500 people.

HAP WAGNER, junior guard, will see plenty of duty for Ilowie Dall
mar's crew when they tangle with the Oregon State College Beavers
tonight and tomorrow, in Corvallis. Wagner, a starting guard before an
ankle injury stopped him early in the season, may break bark into the
starting five for the weekend action. If not, either Bill Flanders or Gary
Van Galder will start in his place. Stanford will take a 3-1 record in
against the Orangemen who hold a 1-3 mark in conference action.
Sports Editor, The Daily
Coach Howie Dallmar's sec
ond - place Indians journey
northward for the second time
this year as they meet the Ore
gon State College Beavers to
night and tomorrow in Corvallis.
Saturday's game will be televised
at 2 p.m.
Stanford, which currently has a
3-1 conference record, will find itself
up against a tall but young OSC
(team which dropped a pair to South
ern Cal last week in Los Angeles.
Dallmar's surprising Cards, who
have an over-all season record of
10-1, will again be led toy the trio

of Captain George Selleck, Bill Bond
and Barry Brown. All three played
brilliantly last weekend when Stan
ford tipped Idaho twice.
Selleck, current team scoring lead
er with 62 points in conference play,
racked up 35 of those against the
Vandals. In addition he played his
usual outstanding floor game.
Bond, who has finally recovered
from a series of injuries and ill
nesses that limited his effectiveness
in the pre-conference games, hit for
50 points against Idaho, 25 each
night.
Brown again was the Stanford
backboard power. The agile forward
swept the boards on both ends nnd
aided the scoring considerably with
27 points.
The other positions on the Card
five are still up for grabs. Selleck's
running mate at guard will be picked
from the trio of Bill Flanders, Hap
Wagner and Gary Van Galder, and
the center post will go either to Carl
Isaacs or Carlos Bea.
Flanders has improved considera
bly since the start of the season, and

started the last game against the
Vandals.
