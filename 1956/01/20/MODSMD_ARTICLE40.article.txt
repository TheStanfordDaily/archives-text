## 
### JIM PRICE 
Paced by Ray Barnett's 11 points,
El Tigre's intramural basketballers
downed the undermanned Los Arcos
five, 34-12.
El Tigre only led by a 13-5 margin
at the halftime intermission, but hot
shooting by Barnett and his four
teammates enabled them to close
with a rush. Barnett tallied nine of
his 12 markers in the second half.
ALso shining for El Tigre was slen
der guard Neil McPhail, whose bril
liant floor work sparked the attack.
He also tossed in eight points. Hus
tling Ed Bishop, a pesky guard, was
the leader of Los Arcos. He scored
four points.
Keynote of El Tigre's attack was
their deliberate style and their
strong rebounding. Throughout the
first half, they took their time to
work carefully for their shots. How
ever, when the inability of the Los
Arcos five to hit the basket became
evident, the El Tigre caution was
thrown to the wind, and they scored
freely in the second half.

Amazingly enough, Los Arcos took
the initial lead as they ran up a 4-1
margin in the opening couple of
minutes of play. However, a pair of
jump shots by Neil McPhaLl and a
follow by Doug Warner put El Tigre
in the lead to stay.
On behalf of Los Arcos, it must
ibe said they had only four of their
regulars present and. having to play
with a few substitutes, they lacked
organization.
