# Braves Travel To Battle With Mare Island
## Lynn Expects Sailors To Have Tough Squad 
### DAVE CAN FIELD 
Stanford's Braves will travel
to Mare Island Naval Base in
Vallejo tonight to battle it out
with what Coach George Lynn
terms a "very good ball club."
Lynn said: "I talked to Coach Phil
O'Neil of Mare Island, who said he
lost four or five of his best men at
the end of last year. So Mare Island
will be very good but not quite as
good as last year. They've won about
half their games."
Stanford has also won half its
games, boasting a 2-2 record.
Against Mare Island, Coach Lynn
will probably start Tom Dyer and
Pete Mansfield at forwards, Nick
Vojvodich at center and Jerry Rose
and Dean Thomas at guards.
Sure to see a lot of action, accord
ing to Coach Lynn, is reserve center
Eric Anderson. In previous games
Anderson started, but Vojvodich is
down from the varsity and received
the starting nod because of his
height and experience.
A junior, Vojvodich stands 6-7
while Anderson measures 6-4. As a
whole, the Braves stack up pretty
well in regard to height with Mans
field 6-2, Dyer 6-3 and reserve Jay
Jackson also 6-3.
Though only six feet, Rose stands
out as the club's play-maker, ac
cording to Lynn.
"It's not a one-man offense, as all
four men move around and screen,"
revealed Coach Lynn. "But Rose is
probably the leader."
