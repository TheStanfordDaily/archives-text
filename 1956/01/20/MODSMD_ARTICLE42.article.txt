Coach Dick Clegg will journey
with his frosh basketball squad to
Kentfield, Marin county, to play Ma

will be at 8.
John Capel will start for the frosh

Dick Haga will start at the forward
slots. Guards will be Paul Neumann
and Doug Warren.
The froah five have an impressive

to start getting a little tougher with
this one."
