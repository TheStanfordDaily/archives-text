The other day as I was walking down the street picking up
tinfoil (Philip Morris, incidentally, has the best tinfoil, which
is not surprising »vhen you consider that they have the best
cigarettes, which is not ojrprising when you consider that they
buy the best tobaccos and the best paper and put them together
with skill and loving care and rush them to your tobacco counter,
fresh and firm and loaded with gentle smoking pleasure to lull
the palate and beguile the senses and shoo the blues) the other
day, I say, as I was walking down the street picking up tinfoil
(I have, incidentally, the second largest ball of tinfoil in our
family. My brother Eleanor's is bigger—more than four miles
in diameter—but, ot course, he is taller than I.) the other day,
as I was saying, while walking down the street picking up tinfoil,
I passed a campus and right beside it, a movie theatre which
specialized in showing foreign fiims. "Hmmmm," I said to my
self, "I wonder hov; come so many theatres which specialize in
showing foreign films are located near campuses?"
And the answer came right back to me: "Because foreign
films are full of culture, art, and esoterica, and where is culture
more rife, art more rampant, and esoterica more endemic than
on a campus? Nowhere, that's where!"

I hope that all of you have been taking advantage of the
foreign film theatre near y~ur campus. Here you will find no
simple-minded Holly.vood products — full of treacly sentiment
and machine-made bravura. Here you will find life itself— life
in all its grimness, its poverty, its naked, raw passion!
Have you, for instance, seen the reeent French import, Lc
Jardin de Ma Tante ("The Kneecap'), a savage and uncom
promising story of a man named Claude Parfum, whose con
suming ambition is to get a job as a meter reader with the
Paris water department? But he is unable, alas, to afford the
flashlight one needs for this position. His wife, Bon-Bon, sells
her hair to a wigmaker and buys him a flashlight. Then, alas,
Claude discovers that one also requires a leatherette bow tic.
This time his two young daughters, Caramel and Nougat, sell
their hair to the wigmaker. So Claude has his leatherette bow-tie,
but now, alas, hit* flashlight battery is burned out and the whole
family, alas, is bald.
Or have you seen the latest Italian masterpiece, La Dnnna E
Mobile (".I Ache Ail Over"), a heart shattering tale of a boy and
his dog? Malvolio, a Venetian lad of nine, loves his little dog
with every fibre of his being. He has one great dream: to enter
the dog in the annual dog show at the Doge's palace. But that,
alas, requires an entrance fee, and Malvolio, alas, is penniless.
However, he saves and scrimps and steals and finally gets enough
together to enter the dog in the show. The dog, alas, comes in
twenty-third. Malvolio sells him to a vivisectionist.
Or have you seen the new Japanese triumph, Kibutzi-San
("The Radish"), a pulse-stirring historical romance about
Yamoto, a poor farmer, and his daughter Ethel who are accosted
by a warlord on their way to market one morning? The warlord
cuts Yamoto in half with his samurai sword and runs off with
Ethel. When Yamoto recovers, he seeks out Ethel's fiance,
Chutzpah, and together they find the warlord and kill him. But,
alas, the warlord was also a sorcerer and he has whimsically
turned Ethel into a whooping crane. But loyal Chutzpah takes
her home where he feeds her fish heads for twenty years and
keeps hoping she'll turn back into a woman. She never does. Alas.

The other day as I was walking down the street picking up
tinfoil (Philip Morris, incidentally, has the best tinfoil, which
is not surprising »vhen you consider that they have the best
cigarettes, which is not ojrprising when you consider that they
buy the best tobaccos and the best paper and put them together
with skill and loving care and rush them to your tobacco counter,
fresh and firm and loaded with gentle smoking pleasure to lull
the palate and beguile the senses and shoo the blues) the other
day, I say, as I was walking down the street picking up tinfoil
(I have, incidentally, the second largest ball of tinfoil in our
family. My brother Eleanor's is bigger—more than four miles
in diameter—but, ot course, he is taller than I.) the other day,
as I was saying, while walking down the street picking up tinfoil,
I passed a campus and right beside it, a movie theatre which
specialized in showing foreign fiims. "Hmmmm," I said to my
self, "I wonder hov; come so many theatres which specialize in
showing foreign films are located near campuses?"
And the answer came right back to me: "Because foreign
films are full of culture, art, and esoterica, and where is culture
more rife, art more rampant, and esoterica more endemic than
on a campus? Nowhere, that's where!"

I hope that all of you have been taking advantage of the
foreign film theatre near y~ur campus. Here you will find no
simple-minded Holly.vood products — full of treacly sentiment
and machine-made bravura. Here you will find life itself— life
in all its grimness, its poverty, its naked, raw passion!
Have you, for instance, seen the reeent French import, Lc
Jardin de Ma Tante ("The Kneecap'), a savage and uncom
promising story of a man named Claude Parfum, whose con
suming ambition is to get a job as a meter reader with the
Paris water department? But he is unable, alas, to afford the
flashlight one needs for this position. His wife, Bon-Bon, sells
her hair to a wigmaker and buys him a flashlight. Then, alas,
Claude discovers that one also requires a leatherette bow tic.
This time his two young daughters, Caramel and Nougat, sell
their hair to the wigmaker. So Claude has his leatherette bow-tie,
but now, alas, hit* flashlight battery is burned out and the whole
family, alas, is bald.
Or have you seen the latest Italian masterpiece, La Dnnna E
Mobile (".I Ache Ail Over"), a heart shattering tale of a boy and
his dog? Malvolio, a Venetian lad of nine, loves his little dog
with every fibre of his being. He has one great dream: to enter
the dog in the annual dog show at the Doge's palace. But that,
alas, requires an entrance fee, and Malvolio, alas, is penniless.
However, he saves and scrimps and steals and finally gets enough
together to enter the dog in the show. The dog, alas, comes in
twenty-third. Malvolio sells him to a vivisectionist.
Or have you seen the new Japanese triumph, Kibutzi-San
("The Radish"), a pulse-stirring historical romance about
Yamoto, a poor farmer, and his daughter Ethel who are accosted
by a warlord on their way to market one morning? The warlord
cuts Yamoto in half with his samurai sword and runs off with
Ethel. When Yamoto recovers, he seeks out Ethel's fiance,
Chutzpah, and together they find the warlord and kill him. But,
alas, the warlord was also a sorcerer and he has whimsically
turned Ethel into a whooping crane. But loyal Chutzpah takes
her home where he feeds her fish heads for twenty years and
keeps hoping she'll turn back into a woman. She never does. Alas.

VIVE LE POPCORN!
The other day as I was walking down the street picking up
tinfoil (Philip Morris, incidentally, has the best tinfoil, which
is not surprising »vhen you consider that they have the best
cigarettes, which is not ojrprising when you consider that they
buy the best tobaccos and the best paper and put them together
with skill and loving care and rush them to your tobacco counter,
fresh and firm and loaded with gentle smoking pleasure to lull
the palate and beguile the senses and shoo the blues) the other
day, I say, as I was walking down the street picking up tinfoil
(I have, incidentally, the second largest ball of tinfoil in our
family. My brother Eleanor's is bigger—more than four miles
in diameter—but, ot course, he is taller than I.) the other day,
as I was saying, while walking down the street picking up tinfoil,
I passed a campus and right beside it, a movie theatre which
specialized in showing foreign fiims. "Hmmmm," I said to my
self, "I wonder hov; come so many theatres which specialize in
showing foreign films are located near campuses?"
And the answer came right back to me: "Because foreign
films are full of culture, art, and esoterica, and where is culture
more rife, art more rampant, and esoterica more endemic than
on a campus? Nowhere, that's where!"

I hope that all of you have been taking advantage of the
foreign film theatre near y~ur campus. Here you will find no
simple-minded Holly.vood products — full of treacly sentiment
and machine-made bravura. Here you will find life itself— life
in all its grimness, its poverty, its naked, raw passion!
Have you, for instance, seen the reeent French import, Lc
Jardin de Ma Tante ("The Kneecap'), a savage and uncom
promising story of a man named Claude Parfum, whose con
suming ambition is to get a job as a meter reader with the
Paris water department? But he is unable, alas, to afford the
flashlight one needs for this position. His wife, Bon-Bon, sells
her hair to a wigmaker and buys him a flashlight. Then, alas,
Claude discovers that one also requires a leatherette bow tic.
This time his two young daughters, Caramel and Nougat, sell
their hair to the wigmaker. So Claude has his leatherette bow-tie,
but now, alas, hit* flashlight battery is burned out and the whole
family, alas, is bald.
Or have you seen the latest Italian masterpiece, La Dnnna E
Mobile (".I Ache Ail Over"), a heart shattering tale of a boy and
his dog? Malvolio, a Venetian lad of nine, loves his little dog
with every fibre of his being. He has one great dream: to enter
the dog in the annual dog show at the Doge's palace. But that,
alas, requires an entrance fee, and Malvolio, alas, is penniless.
However, he saves and scrimps and steals and finally gets enough
together to enter the dog in the show. The dog, alas, comes in
twenty-third. Malvolio sells him to a vivisectionist.
Or have you seen the new Japanese triumph, Kibutzi-San
("The Radish"), a pulse-stirring historical romance about
Yamoto, a poor farmer, and his daughter Ethel who are accosted
by a warlord on their way to market one morning? The warlord
cuts Yamoto in half with his samurai sword and runs off with
Ethel. When Yamoto recovers, he seeks out Ethel's fiance,
Chutzpah, and together they find the warlord and kill him. But,
alas, the warlord was also a sorcerer and he has whimsically
turned Ethel into a whooping crane. But loyal Chutzpah takes
her home where he feeds her fish heads for twenty years and
keeps hoping she'll turn back into a woman. She never does. Alas.
