# The 						Committee on Public Exercises . . . Unheralded But Hard Working
## By DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
### 
One of Stanford's most vital or
ganizations, The Committee on
Public Exercises, is also one of its
most misunderstood. The need is
simply stated: "If such a committee
didn't exist, we would surely have
to invent one."
One of the committee's members
made that comment recently. But
that same member expressed real
concern about the obvious situa
tion that, although most students
realize his committee's necessity,
few know the why or what of it.
One of the "whys" concerns the
recent Copland concert —in which
the committee did not refuse use
of Memorial Auditorium.
Any large community needs a
group to coordinate the many pub
lic functions which operate under
its jurisdiction. Stanford is certain
ly a large community and the Pub
lic Exercises Committee is the
needed coordinating group.
That is the bare framework on
vyhich are hung the myriad duties
of the committee, the why of it.
"The Committee on Public Exer

cises has to do with public Univer
sity exercises, intercollegiate or
other public entertainments given
at the University by individuals
not connected* w i th the Univer
sity."
There is the what of it, as defined
in the Faculty Organization Arti
cles and the Academic Council By-
Laws.
Actually the committee acts
more as a schedule maker than
anything else. The scheduling pro
cedure moves along like this:
An organization decides it wants
to sponsor a certain program and
goes to the committee offices on
Inner Quad (ID) for an application
for approval.
The application is filled out with
the name of the sponsoring organi
zation, the proposed event, the date
and time, the participants, any ad
mission charge, to what proceeds
are going (if any) and the space
requirements (which will deter
mine what auditorium to use).
Such applications only govern
public exercises, to which the gen
eral public is invited. Most of these
exercises are held in Cubberley or

Memorial Auditorium, although
some are given at Bowman Alumni
House, Frost Amphitheater and
smaller campus auditoriums.
The sponsoring organization ac
tually determines what auditorium
it will use in most cases. The Cop
land concert was such a case. The
Music Department committee
which planned the recital had told
the public exercises group that
Cubberley would be sufficient to
'house the crowd they expected.
It is true that Memorial Audito
rium was not in use at the time,
and the Copland concert could
have been held there had the con
cert sponsors asked for its use.
But they did not and the Public
Exercises Committee approved
their request lor Cubberley.
Most of the committee's decisions
on the applications are made by
the chairman in consultation with
the sponsoring group and most de
cisions are automatic, providing the
auditorium requested is not al
ready scheduled to be used on the
date requested.
If there is some question con
cerning the application the chair

man either calls up other commit
tee members to discuss it or holds
it until one of the monthly com
mittee meetings, providing there is

sufficient time before the proposed
event.
Grounds on which the applica
tion may be questioned include
conflicts with other events on the
same date in the same auditorium
or that a proposed speech may not
be a fair presentation given by an
authority in the field on which he
is to talk.
The committee mpets Ihe first
Friday of every month and most of
their decisions, by a majority vote,
are in the form of advice to the
groups sponsoring the proposed
event.
Their discussions are usually
quite lengthy and decisions are far
from arbitrary .They base sched
uling decisions generally on the
criteria: will the event help give
the University a balanced over-all
program?
The committee is made up of 12
faculty and administrative mem
bers. Chairman is William C.
Steere, graduate division dean and
biology professor.
Steere has stressed that his com
mittee is not secret, that all its de
bates are public and any organiza

tion may send representatives fo
committee meetings when its pro
posed program is to be discussed.
The chairman's office is in Build
ing 1 on Inner Quad.
So, rather than being a rule
making body the committee oper
ates as an advisory group—helping
the sponsoring organization decide
on where and when would be the
'befit place and time to hold their
program.
They have no set priority listing
and in the case of conflict usually
effect a compromise between the
ffcwo groups involved.
Steere says the committee is not
concerned with a scheduled speak
er's topic "as long as it's a fair
presentation."
''We are in one of the most sensi
tive spots in the. University, where
we face the public—an extremely
delicate position."
One of the committee's responsi
bilities is to see that courtesy is
received by all University guests.
"We are quite proud of the com
mittee and what it does . . . we're so
busy. We live with crises," says
the chairman.

DUsy? Take a look at some of
iChe other tilings for Which the
group Ls responsible:
• The Stanford Weekly Calen
dar (announcement of public
events; 40 issues a year with about
2000 circulation).
• Tuesday Evening Series (Me
morial Auditorium is usually re
served on Tuesday nights for the
program; last year 30 programs
were given with an attendance of
about 18,000).
• Music events (concerts —five
(East yioniv, Department of Music
events, Memorial Church recitals,
ASSU concerts).
• Special events (films, Back to
the Farm, Intermezzo, Theatre Ma
tinee, homecoming, Big Game Gai
ties, television programs, lIR pro
grams, swimming shows, etc.).
• Revival film series (2fi last
year). •
• Conferences (28 last year).
• Founder's Day.
• Commencement exercises.
• Arranging for Stanford stu
dents and faculty for outside
speaking engagements
Is it no wonder then that Steere

says "we re so busy" an<l that one
of the busiest persons at the Uni
versity is Mrs. Jean White, who is
the committee's executive secre
tary. Her schedule book is a mass
of upcoming dates for almost every
conceivable public event which has
been scheduled through the com
mittee.
The problems of. a committee
which handles such a wide variety
of material are many hut the group
is a smooth functioning committee
which does its best to see that the
general welfare of the University
and its students is best served-.
"We are here, live here, are al
ways available. If the final decision
can't bo reached we will get the
process moving; there's no 'sitting
on it'," Steere commented.
"We operate as a group," he said.
"I think we can defend every de
cision we make."
The committee Is limited by the
very fact that the University has
only so many auditoriums avail
able. This problem will be eased
somewhat when the new Music
Building opens, probably during


WILLIAM C. STEERE
the 1957-'5B academic yeai\
And even when a public exercise is
not scheduled an auditorium may not
be available. Classes are held in Cub
berley every day and the Speech and
Drama Department uses Cubberley,
Memorial Auditorium and the Little
Theatre quite often and have priority
on their use/
Even though the committee has no
control over this situation the charge
has been often made that the audi
torium facilities at Stanford are not
meeting the needs of an expanding
university.
But committee members doubt
this, note that "it's big enough for all
practical purposes —it's over-all use
is important and the average crowds
don't overtax the capacities."
Formerly the Lack of soundproofing
in the corridor between Memorial
Auditorium and the Little Theatre
made it impractical to have programs
in each auditorium at the same time.
Recently the soundproofing was com
pleted and as long as the program in
one isn't too loud both can be used
at the same time.
The committee has a policy manual
concerning all its operations and
general procedures in its handling of
public events. A copy is on file at the
ASSU office.

The committee also decides on the
lighting facilities in the auditoriums
which it helps to fill.
"We are not a rubber stamp or
ganization ... we are for the general
welfare of the University ... a guid
ing committee," a committee member
said.
And they are a committee which is
doing the best possible job within the
limitations of auditorium space avail
able and a 365-day year.

Is it no wonder then that Steere

says "we re so busy" an<l that one
of the busiest persons at the Uni
versity is Mrs. Jean White, who is
the committee's executive secre
tary. Her schedule book is a mass
of upcoming dates for almost every
conceivable public event which has
been scheduled through the com
mittee.
The problems of. a committee
which handles such a wide variety
of material are many hut the group
is a smooth functioning committee
which does its best to see that the
general welfare of the University
and its students is best served-.
"We are here, live here, are al
ways available. If the final decision
can't bo reached we will get the
process moving; there's no 'sitting
on it'," Steere commented.
"We operate as a group," he said.
"I think we can defend every de
cision we make."
The committee Is limited by the
very fact that the University has
only so many auditoriums avail
able. This problem will be eased
somewhat when the new Music
Building opens, probably during


WILLIAM C. STEERE
the 1957-'5B academic yeai\
And even when a public exercise is
not scheduled an auditorium may not
be available. Classes are held in Cub
berley every day and the Speech and
Drama Department uses Cubberley,
Memorial Auditorium and the Little
Theatre quite often and have priority
on their use/
Even though the committee has no
control over this situation the charge
has been often made that the audi
torium facilities at Stanford are not
meeting the needs of an expanding
university.
But committee members doubt
this, note that "it's big enough for all
practical purposes —it's over-all use
is important and the average crowds
don't overtax the capacities."
Formerly the Lack of soundproofing
in the corridor between Memorial
Auditorium and the Little Theatre
made it impractical to have programs
in each auditorium at the same time.
Recently the soundproofing was com
pleted and as long as the program in
one isn't too loud both can be used
at the same time.
The committee has a policy manual
concerning all its operations and
general procedures in its handling of
public events. A copy is on file at the
ASSU office.

The committee also decides on the
lighting facilities in the auditoriums
which it helps to fill.
"We are not a rubber stamp or
ganization ... we are for the general
welfare of the University ... a guid
ing committee," a committee member
said.
And they are a committee which is
doing the best possible job within the
limitations of auditorium space avail
able and a 365-day year.
One of Stanford's most vital or
ganizations, The Committee on
Public Exercises, is also one of its
most misunderstood. The need is
simply stated: "If such a committee
didn't exist, we would surely have
to invent one."
One of the committee's members
made that comment recently. But
that same member expressed real
concern about the obvious situa
tion that, although most students
realize his committee's necessity,
few know the why or what of it.
One of the "whys" concerns the
recent Copland concert —in which
the committee did not refuse use
of Memorial Auditorium.
Any large community needs a
group to coordinate the many pub
lic functions which operate under
its jurisdiction. Stanford is certain
ly a large community and the Pub
lic Exercises Committee is the
needed coordinating group.
That is the bare framework on
vyhich are hung the myriad duties
of the committee, the why of it.
"The Committee on Public Exer

cises has to do with public Univer
sity exercises, intercollegiate or
other public entertainments given
at the University by individuals
not connected* w i th the Univer
sity."
There is the what of it, as defined
in the Faculty Organization Arti
cles and the Academic Council By-
Laws.
Actually the committee acts
more as a schedule maker than
anything else. The scheduling pro
cedure moves along like this:
An organization decides it wants
to sponsor a certain program and
goes to the committee offices on
Inner Quad (ID) for an application
for approval.
The application is filled out with
the name of the sponsoring organi
zation, the proposed event, the date
and time, the participants, any ad
mission charge, to what proceeds
are going (if any) and the space
requirements (which will deter
mine what auditorium to use).
Such applications only govern
public exercises, to which the gen
eral public is invited. Most of these
exercises are held in Cubberley or

Memorial Auditorium, although
some are given at Bowman Alumni
House, Frost Amphitheater and
smaller campus auditoriums.
The sponsoring organization ac
tually determines what auditorium
it will use in most cases. The Cop
land concert was such a case. The
Music Department committee
which planned the recital had told
the public exercises group that
Cubberley would be sufficient to
'house the crowd they expected.
It is true that Memorial Audito
rium was not in use at the time,
and the Copland concert could
have been held there had the con
cert sponsors asked for its use.
But they did not and the Public
Exercises Committee approved
their request lor Cubberley.
Most of the committee's decisions
on the applications are made by
the chairman in consultation with
the sponsoring group and most de
cisions are automatic, providing the
auditorium requested is not al
ready scheduled to be used on the
date requested.
If there is some question con
cerning the application the chair

man either calls up other commit
tee members to discuss it or holds
it until one of the monthly com
mittee meetings, providing there is

sufficient time before the proposed
event.
Grounds on which the applica
tion may be questioned include
conflicts with other events on the
same date in the same auditorium
or that a proposed speech may not
be a fair presentation given by an
authority in the field on which he
is to talk.
The committee mpets Ihe first
Friday of every month and most of
their decisions, by a majority vote,
are in the form of advice to the
groups sponsoring the proposed
event.
Their discussions are usually
quite lengthy and decisions are far
from arbitrary .They base sched
uling decisions generally on the
criteria: will the event help give
the University a balanced over-all
program?
The committee is made up of 12
faculty and administrative mem
bers. Chairman is William C.
Steere, graduate division dean and
biology professor.
Steere has stressed that his com
mittee is not secret, that all its de
bates are public and any organiza

tion may send representatives fo
committee meetings when its pro
posed program is to be discussed.
The chairman's office is in Build
ing 1 on Inner Quad.
So, rather than being a rule
making body the committee oper
ates as an advisory group—helping
the sponsoring organization decide
on where and when would be the
'befit place and time to hold their
program.
They have no set priority listing
and in the case of conflict usually
effect a compromise between the
ffcwo groups involved.
Steere says the committee is not
concerned with a scheduled speak
er's topic "as long as it's a fair
presentation."
''We are in one of the most sensi
tive spots in the. University, where
we face the public—an extremely
delicate position."
One of the committee's responsi
bilities is to see that courtesy is
received by all University guests.
"We are quite proud of the com
mittee and what it does . . . we're so
busy. We live with crises," says
the chairman.

DUsy? Take a look at some of
iChe other tilings for Which the
group Ls responsible:
• The Stanford Weekly Calen
dar (announcement of public
events; 40 issues a year with about
2000 circulation).
• Tuesday Evening Series (Me

program; last year 30 programs
were given with an attendance of
about 18,000).
• Music events (concerts —five

cisions are automatic, providing the
auditorium requested is not al
ready scheduled to be used on the
date requested.
If there is some question con
cerning the application the chair

man either calls up other commit
tee members to discuss it or holds
it until one of the monthly com
mittee meetings, providing there is

sufficient time before the proposed
event.
Grounds on which the applica
tion may be questioned include
conflicts with other events on the
same date in the same auditorium
or that a proposed speech may not
be a fair presentation given by an
authority in the field on which he
is to talk.
The committee mpets Ihe first
Friday of every month and most of
their decisions, by a majority vote,
are in the form of advice to the
groups sponsoring the proposed
event.
Their discussions are usually
quite lengthy and decisions are far
from arbitrary .They base sched
uling decisions generally on the
criteria: will the event help give
the University a balanced over-all
program?
The committee is made up of 12
faculty and administrative mem
bers. Chairman is William C.
Steere, graduate division dean and
biology professor.
Steere has stressed that his com
mittee is not secret, that all its de
bates are public and any organiza

tion may send representatives fo
committee meetings when its pro
posed program is to be discussed.
The chairman's office is in Build
ing 1 on Inner Quad.
So, rather than being a rule
making body the committee oper
ates as an advisory group—helping
the sponsoring organization decide
on where and when would be the
'befit place and time to hold their
program.
They have no set priority listing
and in the case of conflict usually
effect a compromise between the
ffcwo groups involved.
Steere says the committee is not
concerned with a scheduled speak
er's topic "as long as it's a fair
presentation."
''We are in one of the most sensi
tive spots in the. University, where
we face the public—an extremely
delicate position."
One of the committee's responsi
bilities is to see that courtesy is
received by all University guests.
"We are quite proud of the com
mittee and what it does . . . we're so
busy. We live with crises," says
the chairman.

DUsy? Take a look at some of
iChe other tilings for Which the
group Ls responsible:
• The Stanford Weekly Calen
dar (announcement of public
events; 40 issues a year with about
2000 circulation).
• Tuesday Evening Series (Me
morial Auditorium is usually re
served on Tuesday nights for the
program; last year 30 programs
were given with an attendance of
about 18,000).
• Music events (concerts —five
(East yioniv, Department of Music
events, Memorial Church recitals,
ASSU concerts).
• Special events (films, Back to
the Farm, Intermezzo, Theatre Ma
tinee, homecoming, Big Game Gai
ties, television programs, lIR pro
grams, swimming shows, etc.).
• Revival film series (2fi last
year). •
• Conferences (28 last year).
• Founder's Day.
• Commencement exercises.
• Arranging for Stanford stu
dents and faculty for outside
speaking engagements
Is it no wonder then that Steere

says "we re so busy" an<l that one
of the busiest persons at the Uni
versity is Mrs. Jean White, who is
the committee's executive secre
tary. Her schedule book is a mass
of upcoming dates for almost every
conceivable public event which has
been scheduled through the com
mittee.
The problems of. a committee
which handles such a wide variety
of material are many hut the group
is a smooth functioning committee
which does its best to see that the
general welfare of the University
and its students is best served-.
"We are here, live here, are al
ways available. If the final decision
can't bo reached we will get the
process moving; there's no 'sitting
on it'," Steere commented.
"We operate as a group," he said.
"I think we can defend every de
cision we make."
The committee Is limited by the
very fact that the University has
only so many auditoriums avail
able. This problem will be eased
somewhat when the new Music
Building opens, probably during


WILLIAM C. STEERE
the 1957-'5B academic yeai\
And even when a public exercise is
not scheduled an auditorium may not
be available. Classes are held in Cub
berley every day and the Speech and
Drama Department uses Cubberley,
Memorial Auditorium and the Little
Theatre quite often and have priority
on their use/
Even though the committee has no
control over this situation the charge
has been often made that the audi
torium facilities at Stanford are not
meeting the needs of an expanding
university.
But committee members doubt
this, note that "it's big enough for all
practical purposes —it's over-all use
is important and the average crowds
don't overtax the capacities."
Formerly the Lack of soundproofing
in the corridor between Memorial
Auditorium and the Little Theatre
made it impractical to have programs
in each auditorium at the same time.
Recently the soundproofing was com
pleted and as long as the program in
one isn't too loud both can be used
at the same time.
The committee has a policy manual
concerning all its operations and
general procedures in its handling of
public events. A copy is on file at the
ASSU office.

The committee also decides on the
lighting facilities in the auditoriums
which it helps to fill.
"We are not a rubber stamp or
ganization ... we are for the general
welfare of the University ... a guid
ing committee," a committee member
said.
And they are a committee which is
doing the best possible job within the
limitations of auditorium space avail
able and a 365-day year.
One of Stanford's most vital or
ganizations, The Committee on
Public Exercises, is also one of its
most misunderstood. The need is
simply stated: "If such a committee
didn't exist, we would surely have
to invent one."
One of the committee's members
made that comment recently. But
that same member expressed real
concern about the obvious situa
tion that, although most students
realize his committee's necessity,
few know the why or what of it.
One of the "whys" concerns the
recent Copland concert —in which
the committee did not refuse use
of Memorial Auditorium.
Any large community needs a
group to coordinate the many pub
lic functions which operate under
its jurisdiction. Stanford is certain
ly a large community and the Pub
lic Exercises Committee is the
needed coordinating group.
That is the bare framework on
vyhich are hung the myriad duties
of the committee, the why of it.
"The Committee on Public Exer

cises has to do with public Univer
sity exercises, intercollegiate or
other public entertainments given
at the University by individuals
not connected* w i th the Univer
sity."
There is the what of it, as defined
in the Faculty Organization Arti
cles and the Academic Council By-
Laws.
Actually the committee acts
more as a schedule maker than
anything else. The scheduling pro
cedure moves along like this:
An organization decides it wants
to sponsor a certain program and
goes to the committee offices on
Inner Quad (ID) for an application
for approval.
The application is filled out with
the name of the sponsoring organi
zation, the proposed event, the date
and time, the participants, any ad
mission charge, to what proceeds
are going (if any) and the space
requirements (which will deter
mine what auditorium to use).
Such applications only govern
public exercises, to which the gen
eral public is invited. Most of these
exercises are held in Cubberley or

Memorial Auditorium, although
some are given at Bowman Alumni
House, Frost Amphitheater and
smaller campus auditoriums.
The sponsoring organization ac
tually determines what auditorium
it will use in most cases. The Cop
land concert was such a case. The
Music Department committee
which planned the recital had told
the public exercises group that
Cubberley would be sufficient to
'house the crowd they expected.
It is true that Memorial Audito
rium was not in use at the time,
and the Copland concert could
have been held there had the con
cert sponsors asked for its use.
But they did not and the Public
Exercises Committee approved
their request lor Cubberley.
Most of the committee's decisions
on the applications are made by
the chairman in consultation with
the sponsoring group and most de
cisions are automatic, providing the
auditorium requested is not al
ready scheduled to be used on the
date requested.
If there is some question con
cerning the application the chair

man either calls up other commit
tee members to discuss it or holds

mittee meetings, providing there is

welfare of the University ... a guid
ing committee," a committee member
said.
And they are a committee which is
doing the best possible job within the
limitations of auditorium space avail
able and a 365-day year.
One of Stanford's most vital or
ganizations, The Committee on
Public Exercises, is also one of its
most misunderstood. The need is
simply stated: "If such a committee
didn't exist, we would surely have
to invent one."
One of the committee's members
made that comment recently. But
that same member expressed real
concern about the obvious situa
tion that, although most students
realize his committee's necessity,
few know the why or what of it.
One of the "whys" concerns the
recent Copland concert —in which
the committee did not refuse use
of Memorial Auditorium.
Any large community needs a
group to coordinate the many pub
lic functions which operate under
its jurisdiction. Stanford is certain
ly a large community and the Pub
lic Exercises Committee is the
needed coordinating group.
That is the bare framework on
vyhich are hung the myriad duties
of the committee, the why of it.
"The Committee on Public Exer

cises has to do with public Univer
sity exercises, intercollegiate or
other public entertainments given
at the University by individuals
not connected* w i th the Univer
sity."
There is the what of it, as defined
in the Faculty Organization Arti
cles and the Academic Council By-
Laws.
Actually the committee acts
more as a schedule maker than
anything else. The scheduling pro
cedure moves along like this:
An organization decides it wants
to sponsor a certain program and
goes to the committee offices on
Inner Quad (ID) for an application
for approval.
The application is filled out with
the name of the sponsoring organi
zation, the proposed event, the date
and time, the participants, any ad
mission charge, to what proceeds
are going (if any) and the space
requirements (which will deter
mine what auditorium to use).
Such applications only govern
public exercises, to which the gen
eral public is invited. Most of these
exercises are held in Cubberley or

Memorial Auditorium, although
some are given at Bowman Alumni
House, Frost Amphitheater and
smaller campus auditoriums.
The sponsoring organization ac
tually determines what auditorium
it will use in most cases. The Cop
land concert was such a case. The
Music Department committee
which planned the recital had told
the public exercises group that
Cubberley would be sufficient to
'house the crowd they expected.
It is true that Memorial Audito
rium was not in use at the time,
and the Copland concert could
have been held there had the con
cert sponsors asked for its use.
But they did not and the Public
Exercises Committee approved
their request lor Cubberley.
Most of the committee's decisions
on the applications are made by
the chairman in consultation with
the sponsoring group and most de
cisions are automatic, providing the
auditorium requested is not al
ready scheduled to be used on the
date requested.
If there is some question con
cerning the application the chair

man either calls up other commit
tee members to discuss it or holds
it until one of the monthly com
mittee meetings, providing there is

sufficient time before the proposed
event.
Grounds on which the applica
tion may be questioned include
conflicts with other events on the
same date in the same auditorium
or that a proposed speech may not
be a fair presentation given by an
authority in the field on which he
is to talk.
The committee mpets Ihe first
Friday of every month and most of
their decisions, by a majority vote,
are in the form of advice to the
groups sponsoring the proposed
event.
Their discussions are usually
quite lengthy and decisions are far
from arbitrary .They base sched
uling decisions generally on the
criteria: will the event help give
the University a balanced over-all
program?
The committee is made up of 12
faculty and administrative mem
bers. Chairman is William C.
Steere, graduate division dean and
biology professor.
Steere has stressed that his com
mittee is not secret, that all its de
bates are public and any organiza

tion may send representatives fo
committee meetings when its pro
posed program is to be discussed.
The chairman's office is in Build
ing 1 on Inner Quad.
So, rather than being a rule
making body the committee oper
ates as an advisory group—helping
the sponsoring organization decide
on where and when would be the
'befit place and time to hold their
program.
They have no set priority listing
and in the case of conflict usually
effect a compromise between the
ffcwo groups involved.
Steere says the committee is not
concerned with a scheduled speak
er's topic "as long as it's a fair
presentation."
''We are in one of the most sensi
tive spots in the. University, where
we face the public—an extremely
delicate position."
One of the committee's responsi
bilities is to see that courtesy is
received by all University guests.
"We are quite proud of the com
mittee and what it does . . . we're so
busy. We live with crises," says
the chairman.

DUsy? Take a look at some of
iChe other tilings for Which the
group Ls responsible:
• The Stanford Weekly Calen
dar (announcement of public
events; 40 issues a year with about
2000 circulation).
• Tuesday Evening Series (Me
morial Auditorium is usually re
served on Tuesday nights for the
program; last year 30 programs
were given with an attendance of
about 18,000).
• Music events (concerts —five
(East yioniv, Department of Music
events, Memorial Church recitals,
ASSU concerts).
• Special events (films, Back to
the Farm, Intermezzo, Theatre Ma
tinee, homecoming, Big Game Gai
ties, television programs, lIR pro
grams, swimming shows, etc.).
• Revival film series (2fi last
year). •
• Conferences (28 last year).
• Founder's Day.
• Commencement exercises.
• Arranging for Stanford stu
dents and faculty for outside
speaking engagements
Is it no wonder then that Steere

says "we re so busy" an<l that one
of the busiest persons at the Uni
versity is Mrs. Jean White, who is
the committee's executive secre
tary. Her schedule book is a mass
of upcoming dates for almost every
conceivable public event which has
been scheduled through the com
mittee.
The problems of. a committee
which handles such a wide variety
of material are many hut the group
is a smooth functioning committee
which does its best to see that the
general welfare of the University
and its students is best served-.
"We are here, live here, are al
ways available. If the final decision
can't bo reached we will get the
process moving; there's no 'sitting
on it'," Steere commented.
"We operate as a group," he said.
"I think we can defend every de
cision we make."
The committee Is limited by the
very fact that the University has
only so many auditoriums avail
able. This problem will be eased
somewhat when the new Music
Building opens, probably during


WILLIAM C. STEERE
the 1957-'5B academic yeai\
And even when a public exercise is
not scheduled an auditorium may not
be available. Classes are held in Cub
berley every day and the Speech and
Drama Department uses Cubberley,
Memorial Auditorium and the Little
Theatre quite often and have priority
on their use/
Even though the committee has no
control over this situation the charge
has been often made that the audi
torium facilities at Stanford are not
meeting the needs of an expanding
university.
But committee members doubt
this, note that "it's big enough for all
practical purposes —it's over-all use
is important and the average crowds
don't overtax the capacities."
Formerly the Lack of soundproofing
in the corridor between Memorial
Auditorium and the Little Theatre
made it impractical to have programs
in each auditorium at the same time.
Recently the soundproofing was com
pleted and as long as the program in
one isn't too loud both can be used
at the same time.
The committee has a policy manual
concerning all its operations and
general procedures in its handling of
public events. A copy is on file at the
ASSU office.

The committee also decides on the
lighting facilities in the auditoriums
which it helps to fill.
"We are not a rubber stamp or
ganization ... we are for the general
welfare of the University ... a guid

said.

Is it no wonder then that Steere

says "we re so busy" an<l that one
of the busiest persons at the Uni
versity is Mrs. Jean White, who is
the committee's executive secre
tary. Her schedule book is a mass
of upcoming dates for almost every
conceivable public event which has
been scheduled through the com
mittee.
The problems of. a committee
which handles such a wide variety
of material are many hut the group
is a smooth functioning committee
which does its best to see that the
general welfare of the University
and its students is best served-.
"We are here, live here, are al
ways available. If the final decision
can't bo reached we will get the
process moving; there's no 'sitting
on it'," Steere commented.
"We operate as a group," he said.
"I think we can defend every de
cision we make."
The committee Is limited by the
very fact that the University has
only so many auditoriums avail
able. This problem will be eased
somewhat when the new Music
Building opens, probably during


WILLIAM C. STEERE
the 1957-'5B academic yeai\
And even when a public exercise is
not scheduled an auditorium may not
be available. Classes are held in Cub
berley every day and the Speech and
Drama Department uses Cubberley,
Memorial Auditorium and the Little
Theatre quite often and have priority
on their use/
Even though the committee has no
control over this situation the charge
has been often made that the audi
torium facilities at Stanford are not
meeting the needs of an expanding
university.
But committee members doubt
this, note that "it's big enough for all
practical purposes —it's over-all use
is important and the average crowds
don't overtax the capacities."
Formerly the Lack of soundproofing
in the corridor between Memorial
Auditorium and the Little Theatre
made it impractical to have programs
in each auditorium at the same time.
Recently the soundproofing was com
pleted and as long as the program in
one isn't too loud both can be used
at the same time.
The committee has a policy manual
concerning all its operations and
general procedures in its handling of
public events. A copy is on file at the
ASSU office.

The committee also decides on the
lighting facilities in the auditoriums
which it helps to fill.
"We are not a rubber stamp or
ganization ... we are for the general
welfare of the University ... a guid
ing committee," a committee member
said.
And they are a committee which is
doing the best possible job within the
limitations of auditorium space avail
able and a 365-day year.
