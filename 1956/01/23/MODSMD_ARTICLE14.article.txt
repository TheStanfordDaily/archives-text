## 31 Die, 140 Hurt in L.A. Train Wreck 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22 (UP)—
At least 31 persons were report
ed killed tonight when a Santa
Fe diesel commuter train, gain
ing speed on a run to San Diego,
derailed and overturned, toss
ing passengers through win
dows and trapping them against
the rails.
At least 140 were injured.
The coroner's office reported taken
The coroner's office reported 31
bodies taken from the wreckage of
the two-car stainless steel train, with
more trapped under the sides of the
cars until a wrecker could be moved
in to hoist the heavy cars from the
tracks.
First police reports were "88 dead."
A temporary "coroner's office" was
set up in a vacant lot adjoining the
scene to collect the bodies. At least
five bodies were counted still trapped
beneath one car. Another body was
sighted beneath the first car and po
lice reported "there must be 20 more
in the second car."
Sergeant John A. Strand of the
Los Angeles police counted 32 dead
within the two cars, but that was
about the time the coroner's office
was hauling out bodies to the vacant
lot.
ROCK AND ROLL
Passengers reported the train
started to "rock and roll" minutes
after it left Union Depot in down
town Los Angeles on the two-and
one-quarter-hour, 125-mile run to
San Diego.
Many marines, sailors and soldiers,
headed back to San Diego after
weekend leave, were aboard the
train.
Joyce Little, of San Diego, was on
her way home. "We were going fair
ly fast," she said, "when it felt like
the train was going around a curve.
It lifted to the right and then to the
left. Then it flopped over on its side."
Miss Little had high praise for the
servicemen, who immediately organ
ized into rescue and comfort teams.
"I'd always heard that in an emer
gency you're lucky to have service
men around and I feel that in to
night's train wreck we might have
had a panic if it wasn't for the sail
ors, marines, and soldiers who were
on the train."
DARKNESS
A scene of carnage greeted the fyst
ambulances and police cars as they
found their way to the site o nan iso
lated and hard-to-get-to section of
the railroad yards.
The darkness was overwhelming.

Emergency floodlights were requisi
tioned from TV stations. Police squad
cars bumped their way over tracks
and ties to bring their .spotlights to
bear on the scene.
The two units, each with a power
station underneath its coach, had
found their way to the site on an iso
plowed along on their side for some
150 feet, scattering parts of human
bodies along the tracks for the last
75 feet.
The wreck occurred about 5:42
p.m., some 12 minutes after it left the
depot. By 7:30 p.m. a huge wrecking
crane had been moved in alongside
the overturned cars, with orders to
right the cars and clear the tracks so
the bodies could be taken out.
All Union Pacific, Southern Pacific
and Pacific Electric traffic along the
section of track was blocked off.
A "sig alert" on the police and
sheriff's radio, notifying all of a "ma
jor disaster," was sent at the first
report of the wreck and called in all
ambulances to the scene.
CURIOUS CROWDS
A total of six hospitals were needed
to receive the injured.
In addition to their job of rescue
work, police were forced to set up
special traffic details to handle a
large crowd of curious who began
gathering on the scene. They were
kept several hundred yards away by
officers who kept the roadway open
for emergency vehicles.
Numerous priests quietly respond
ed to the emergency, including two
Buddhist priests. TTiey went about
comforting the injured and adminis
tering last rites to the dying and
dead.
The whole scene presented an eerie
appearance as red railroad flares
were used to mark roadways over
the unpaved open ground for police
cars and ambulances. Huge search
lights, however, lighted the actual
wreck scene.

cars bumped their way over tracks

150 feet, scattering parts of human

The wreck occurred about 5:42

the overturned cars, with orders to

the bodies could be taken out.
All Union Pacific, Southern Pacific

section of track was blocked off.
A "sig alert" on the police and
sheriff's radio, notifying all of a "ma

report of the wreck and called in all
ambulances to the scene.
CURIOUS CROWDS
A total of six hospitals were needed
to receive the injured.
In addition to their job of rescue
work, police were forced to set up
special traffic details to handle a
large crowd of curious who began

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22 (UP)—
At least 31 persons were report
ed killed tonight when a Santa
Fe diesel commuter train, gain
ing speed on a run to San Diego,
derailed and overturned, toss
ing passengers through win
dows and trapping them against
the rails.
At least 140 were injured.
The coroner's office reported taken
The coroner's office reported 31
bodies taken from the wreckage of
the two-car stainless steel train, with
more trapped under the sides of the
cars until a wrecker could be moved
in to hoist the heavy cars from the
tracks.
First police reports were "88 dead."
A temporary "coroner's office" was
set up in a vacant lot adjoining the
scene to collect the bodies. At least
five bodies were counted still trapped
beneath one car. Another body was
sighted beneath the first car and po
lice reported "there must be 20 more
in the second car."
Sergeant John A. Strand of the
Los Angeles police counted 32 dead
within the two cars, but that was
about the time the coroner's office
was hauling out bodies to the vacant
lot.
ROCK AND ROLL
Passengers reported the train
started to "rock and roll" minutes
after it left Union Depot in down
town Los Angeles on the two-and
one-quarter-hour, 125-mile run to
San Diego.
Many marines, sailors and soldiers,
headed back to San Diego after
weekend leave, were aboard the
train.
Joyce Little, of San Diego, was on
her way home. "We were going fair
ly fast," she said, "when it felt like
the train was going around a curve.
It lifted to the right and then to the
left. Then it flopped over on its side."
Miss Little had high praise for the
servicemen, who immediately organ
ized into rescue and comfort teams.
"I'd always heard that in an emer
gency you're lucky to have service
men around and I feel that in to
night's train wreck we might have
had a panic if it wasn't for the sail
ors, marines, and soldiers who were
