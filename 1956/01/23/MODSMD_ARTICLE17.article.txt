In the words oi a man well known to some
of us, this week is the week to "let your light
so shine before men that they may see your
good works . . It's Winter Quarter Charity
Drive time, and your cue to prove to all and
sundry that you are only mean, tight, small,
hardhearted and miserly 51 weeks a year, and
that the 52nd you are trustworthy, loyal, help
ful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheer
ful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.
The WinDrivCom has planned a weekful of
carefully and neatly gimmicked activities to
capture your interest and your spare change
(a schedule of which follows), and if you still
have any jack left by Friday, you can still buy
a Class of '59 class membership—they make
dandy decorations for the den or rumpus room.
Monday niqht, all living groups will be given
a three-minute brain wash by members of the
Speech Association.
Tuesday, you can buy votes at a penny each
in an "Ugly. Man Contest," to pick the foulest
of four prominent ugly bums: Sandberg, Mas
terson, Manoukian and Long.
Wednesday, Dean Winbigler will be
weighed in the balance . . . , and loyal stu
dents will try to pull off an Aga-Khan and equal
his weight in the coin of the realm.
Thursday, KZSU is sponsoring a records and
phone calls marathon from noon till midnight
with the idea of digging out some more money
in the form of pledges.
Fiiday, the winner of the Ugly One contest
will be revealed.
Saturday, the Row will wash the cars of all
comers, also for charity.
Monday next, the preliminary results will be
announced. And Tuesday, the final results will
be announced.
Looks like we'll all be bled dry.

Tuesday evening, Margery Baiiey will' cut
loose with another of her entertaining talks on
her teaching career and the people she has
come into contact with, in a lecture entitled
"A Testament of Teaching." On the subject of
university administrators and faculty col
leagues, Dr. Bailey has a reputation for making
Worthal look as pointless as Uncle Fud, so her
lecture may well be especially interesting.
7:30, in Mem Aud.

Wednesday is another in a nauseous series
of seemingly-inevitable "Chappie Days." Ac
cording to the advance story, it's merely an
other compendium of puerile and poolroom
humor. Vapid and foolish, inconsequential and
uninteresting, perhaps the greatest tragedy of
the Stanford Chaparral lies in its utter failure to
be even mildly amusing. If you get a copy and
later have to take it out in the back yard and
bury it, don't say you weren't warned. If you
still want one, they'll be on sale around the
Quad for 30 cents. v

Wednesday afternoon at 3:30, the regular
Little Theater Matinee will depart from its us
ual fare to serve up a dish which may well
be caviar to the general, but should still be of
more than routine interest. It seems they've
planned a panel discussion or debate about the

problems of contemporary community theater
with the panel featuring representatives from
all the principal community and little theater
organizations around the Bay Area.

Wednesday night at 8:15, the Stanford Play
ers' production of J. B. Priestley's "Dangerous
Corner" opens in Little Theater for a run of four
nights both this week and next. Described by
the production's director, Robert Loper, as basi
cally a melodrama, the play unwinds itself in
the course of three acts. Tickets are available
at Mem Aud box office or from Louis lefferys at
the Peninsula Box Office in the Town and
Country Village.

Thursday afternoon at 4:15, Professor Gra
ham Stuart will enthrall all those interested
with a talk on his recently reissued book "The
International City of Tangier," in the Bender
Room of the Main Library.
* * *
Thursday night at 7:30, the Film Series pre
sents "Wherever She Goes," a film directed
by Michael Gordon and starring one Suzanne
Parrett.

Friday evening, the Fine Arts Quartet will be
on Quad for a concert at 8:15 in Cubberley Au
ditorium. Admission is $2 for all but students,
who can get in for only a dollar. Of course,
this doesn't guarantee you a seat, judging by
the huge overflow crowd at the Copland pro
grams last week. Off-hand, if you're going,
we'd suggest you get there at least a half-hour
early.

Friday and Saturday, the University of Ore
gon hoopsters will be here for the two-game
series in the Pavilion. The winner of the Ugly
Man Contest will be announced at Friday's tilt,
so you'd better go. Note: The Saturday en
counter starts at 2 p.m.

KZSU plans to commemorate the 200 th anni
versary of Mozart's birthday with a program
running from 10:30 Friday night straight
through till' 5:30 Saturday, in the course of
which the boys hope to get through the operas,
some of his later concerti and such other com
positions as time permits. Sounds like a fine
deal, if you can stay awake all night.

The big Stanford Winter Carnival is also this
weekend, just to fill out the social calendar,
with a full program of events at Squaw and
reduced rates on the tows and at the lodge.
They're giving away a pair of Head skis at the
banquet Saturday night. Ought to be a real
good weekend for the snow fans.
* * *
Sunday night is dirty flicks time! It's that
morally corrupt (which means it should be
fun) "Duel in the Sun," with Gregory Peck and
Jennifer Jones. Hope you enjoy it. 7:30, Mem
Aud.

Fact of the Week: Moroccan medicine shops
rent dried cobra skins by the day to cure head
aches.
