no room here
To the Editor: ~
In reference to Mr. Le√üoy's letter of Friday, let me
say that I am in complete accord.
As you know, there is no room on this campus or
in this campus newspaper for adverse criticisms of any
kind. A reviewer or critic of the theater should not
voice his own opinion but should instead take a con
sensus of students who know what is good in the thea
ter and what represents poor taste (e.g., speech and
drama majors). If your critic affronts the connois
seurs, whose opinion is obviously definitive, then he
should be drummed off the staff as a base dolt.
It is not my intention to uphold Mr. Monde's opin
ions but rather to point out that he has the right to
print his views without being referred to as "a dis
grace to your paper, your readers and the University,"
even though he may be.

mural results
To the Editor:
Every morning at breakfast. I pick up The Daily to
read what is happening at this University of ours.
The winter quarter issues hold a special intei'est for
me because I happen to be lucky enough to play on
an intramural basketball team. Maybe it's just vanity
or something, but I like to see my team's name in the
paper.
So what do I see when I open up the paper? One
article that mentions one of the eight games played
the night before. Nowhere in the paper is there any
mention whatsoever of the other seven games. Maybe
this is just an oversight.. I realize maybe thus paper
goes to press before the last game's results are in. But
then at. least the results of all eight games could be
published in the next day's issue. . . .

(Editor's note: The Daily will cover otic intra
mural basketball game most nights and report that
in the next morning's paper. We hope to run the
scores of all the games two mornings after they arc
played.)
