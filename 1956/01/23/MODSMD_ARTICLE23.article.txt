# CAMBODIAN MONK
## 'All People Who Share the World Are Brothers,' Says Buddhist Leader 
### JIM PALMER 
"We look to everybody as
brothers and sisters who share
the v/orld together."
This simple philosophy be
longs to the Buddhist people of
a small southeast Asian country
and was expressed here Friday
by a visiting monastic leader, be
decked in the robes of his order.
Chief Venerable Vira Dharmawara
of Cambodia faced an intent audi
ence of 45 persons in the Hoover
Tower seminar room after viewing
the extensive Far East collection in
the library.
"I come from a small country," he
said slowly in perfect English
fingering a pair of horn- rimmed
glasses, "which is 99 per cent agri
culturalist. Its farm system is so old
and primitive that oxen are still be
ing used to plow the fields."
MONKS' ORDER
He shifted his copper-colored robes
slightly as he talked. The robes were
those of the Mohanikay Order of
Buddhist Monks which he has been
wearing during his two-month tour
of the United States.
At age 60, Ithe small, dark-com
plexioned religious and educational
leader is a figure of striking dignity
and worldliness. He talked seriously
of his country and his faith.
"After the French withdrew from
Camlbodia," he said, "there was a
great void left behind."
Cambodia's government determin
ed to fill this void with educational
and economic progress, the Venera
ble continued. As director and foun
der of the Asaka Mission and Health
Center, he has himself helped con
tribute to filling the void.
GOVERNMENT SUSPICIOUS
"The government of Cambodia is
stiill suspidious of the Communist
Chinese," the Venerable declared at
one point, but when asked about the
spread of Communism he replied,
"We have a very strong belief and
faith —we jutft are not concerned
much about it."

The Venerable's tour of America,
under the auspices of the U. S. De
partment of State's foreign leader
program of the International Educa
tional Exchange Service, was con

scribed by a few ritual limitations.
Under the rules of his order, he
could be entertained in the presence
of women, but a gathering could not
be exclusively women.
He can eat almost everything, but
must do so before the sun reaches
the highest point.
SPIRITUAL ADVISER
Aside from his other duties, the
Venerable has been spiritual adviser
to ex-King Norodom Sihanouk and
active in various Far Eastern dele
gations and committees.
His strong faith was evident to the
people who heard him speak Friday,
for he devoted a majority of the time
to a discussion of Buddha and his
precepts.
Sunday the Venerable boarded a
plane in Los Angeles for home where
he says he will spread the knowledge
gained on his American jaunt, espe
cially the impressions he has received
from the White House Conference on
Education.
It has been a long trip for the
modern-day monk, and, unlike his
ancient predecessors, he has seen a
lot more of the world than the clois
tered walls, of a monastery.

of the United States.
At age 60, Ithe small, dark-com
plexioned religious and educational
leader is a figure of striking dignity
and worldliness. He talked seriously
of his country and his faith.
"After the French withdrew from
Camlbodia," he said, "there was a
great void left behind."
Cambodia's government determin
ed to fill this void with educational
and economic progress, the Venera
ble continued. As director and foun
der of the Asaka Mission and Health
Center, he has himself helped con
tribute to filling the void.
GOVERNMENT SUSPICIOUS
"The government of Cambodia is
stiill suspidious of the Communist
Chinese," the Venerable declared at
one point, but when asked about the
spread of Communism he replied,
"We have a very strong belief and
faith —we jutft are not concerned
much about it."

The Venerable's tour of America,
under the auspices of the U. S. De
partment of State's foreign leader
program of the International Educa
tional Exchange Service, was con

scribed by a few ritual limitations.
Under the rules of his order, he
could be entertained in the presence
of women, but a gathering could not
be exclusively women.
He can eat almost everything, but
must do so before the sun reaches
the highest point.
SPIRITUAL ADVISER
Aside from his other duties, the
Venerable has been spiritual adviser
to ex-King Norodom Sihanouk and
active in various Far Eastern dele
gations and committees.
His strong faith was evident to the
people who heard him speak Friday,
for he devoted a majority of the time
to a discussion of Buddha and his
precepts.
Sunday the Venerable boarded a
plane in Los Angeles for home where
he says he will spread the knowledge
gained on his American jaunt, espe
cially the impressions he has received
from the White House Conference on
Education.
It has been a long trip for the
modern-day monk, and, unlike his
ancient predecessors, he has seen a
lot more of the world than the clois
tered walls, of a monastery.


VIRA DHARMAWARA
"We look to everybody as
brothers and sisters who share
the v/orld together."
This simple philosophy be
longs to the Buddhist people of
a small southeast Asian country
and was expressed here Friday
by a visiting monastic leader, be
decked in the robes of his order.
Chief Venerable Vira Dharmawara
of Cambodia faced an intent audi
ence of 45 persons in the Hoover
Tower seminar room after viewing
the extensive Far East collection in
the library.
"I come from a small country," he
said slowly in perfect English
fingering a pair of horn- rimmed
glasses, "which is 99 per cent agri
culturalist. Its farm system is so old
and primitive that oxen are still be
ing used to plow the fields."
MONKS' ORDER
He shifted his copper-colored robes
slightly as he talked. The robes were
those of the Mohanikay Order of
Buddhist Monks which he has been
wearing during his two-month tour
of the United States.
