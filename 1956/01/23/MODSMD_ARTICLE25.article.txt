# NEW MENTOR?
## Oxy's Jordan in Line For Farm Track Post Salary Difference Only Apparent Obstacle To Signing; BAC Must Approve Selection 
### BOB MIEROW 
Occidental track coach Payton Jordan appears to have the in
side track as successor to Card mentor Jack Weiershauser who
announced his resignation last week. Weiershauser will continue
as Indian chief through the 1956 season.
Jordan, who has compiled a most enviable record while at the

Eagle Rock institution, must gain the
approval of the Stanford Board of
Athletic Control before winning the
job.
Although A 1 Masters, Stanford ath
letic director, will not comment on
Weier: hauser's successor, a strong
possibility exists that the board of
control will announce Jordan's nam
ing to the job at their meeting this
Friday.
One of the main road blocks keep
ing Jordan in the Southland for the
moment is salary terms. A Stanford
spokesman declared that "if we can
come to a financial understanding,
Jordan can have the job."
JORDAN CONTACTED
Jordan was reported to have said:
"I've been contacted by Stanford
representatives both in person and
by phone. But the deal is still in the
negotiating stage. I am very happy
at Occidental and would not leave
for the same money I am making
here.
"Naturally, I'm interested in any
job which offers professional or fi
nancial advancement.
"The salary terms have been an
nounced by the Stanford people, as
a basis of negotiations, but this offer
lias not been reduced to concrete
terms."

Jordan reported that the strict en
trance requirements at Stanford arc
no stiffer than at Occidental, so that
he would be faced with no new re
cruiting proiblems.
He said: "Occidental is a fine small
college with the same high standards
as Stanford. It's just as hard to get
athletes in here as it would be at
Palo Alto."
Jordan's Occidental tracksters have
scored victories over Stanford in the
past two years. Before that, the Bob
Maithias-led Card spikers had run up
a string of wins over the Tigers.
NEAR UPSET
Last year the underdog Tribe bare
ly missed a startLing upset before
falling to the Eagle Rock contingent,
66-65.
Jordan, like Weiershauser, was an
outstanding athlete in his college
days. The Oxy chief starred at South
ern California, helping the Trojans
win the PCC and NCAA champion
ships in 1939.
Under Dean Cromwell, then USC
coach, Jordan ran the 100 in 9.7 and
the 220 in 21 flat. Later, competing
for the Southern California Athletic
Club, Jordan turned in times of 9.5
in the century and 20.6 in the furlong.
Before being named to the Oxy
post in 1946, Jordan bossed the Red
lands High spikers. He coached the
Occidental squad to six consecutive
Southern California Intercollegiate
championships through 1952.
GREAT ATHLETES
Among Jordan's great athletes at
the Eagle Rock school have been
John Barnes, Bob McMillen and
Sherm Miller. All three were middle
distance runners.
Barnes captured the NCAA 880
championship. McMillen was out
standing in the 1952 Olympic Games
when he was narrowly defeated in
the 1500-meter race in Helsinki.
Weiershauser, who has bossed In
dian cindermen since World War 11,
is leaving the post to enter private
business.
