# Stanford Five Bounces Back to Shellac Oregon State After Dropping Friday Game; Defense Stops Beavers
## Cards' Tight Press Forces Orangemen Into Many Mistakes 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's scrapping Indians
bounced back Saturday after
noon to crush the Oregon State
College Beavers, 75,-50, after
dropping the series opener on
Friday night, 69-59.
The Indians came out in the second
Same with a half-court press that
all but ran the inexperienced Staters
right out of their own coliseum.
Time and time again the Beavers
lost the ball before getting a shot off
to coach Howie Dallmar's ball-hawk
ing crew. At one point Stanford ran
up 10 straight points while Oregon
State did not even shoot.
The game started as though it was
going to be a replay of Friday night's

contest, which saw the Northerners
in complete domination. The Beavers
ran up an 8-4 lead, but then the
Cards began to press in earnest and
Oregon State began to fold.
Stanford pulled up into a 12-12 tie
and i ipped out into a huge lead with
a 22-point outburst while the Beav
ers could manage to score only two.
Instrumental in the Stanford burst
were George Selleck, Carl Isaacs and
Bill Bond who were the chief thieves.
Isaacs, in particular, was on his toes.
Three times in near succession he
picked off a pass and went the dis
tance.
BOND STEALS BALL
Bond and Selleck on numerous oc
casions swept in behind an unsus
pecting Orangeman and picked up
the dribble right out of the unnerved
Beaver's hands.
The Staters always managed to get
the ball over the center line, but not
much farther. The tenacious Card
defense wouldn't allow the slower
Beavers to drive through, and the
OSC passing left nothing to be de
sired as far as Stanford was con
cerned.
The Oregon State players were the

picture of frustration as the game,
for a period of about five minutes in
the first half, was played entirely
between the OSC foul line and the
Stanford basket.
The halftime score found the In
dians out in front by a count of 42-20.
Dallmar poured in the reserves
early in the second half, but the score
continued to mount with Ron Wag
ner and Clint Waring leading the of
fensive thrusts for Stanford.
Late in the second half, the Indians
doubled the Staters at 68-34. At this
point, OSC's outstanding sophomore
forward, Dave Gambce, began to
drill 'through shots from all over the
floor to pace a Beaver spurt that al
most made the final score respect
able.
SCORING BALANCED
Stanford's scoring was well dis
tributed. Bond led with 12 counters,
and he was followed by Bill Flanders
and Isaacs with 10 each. Ron Wagner
chippcd in nine and Van Galder ac
counted for eight.
Gambce was high scorer for the
game with 16 points.
The Indians scorched the nets with
a .466 shooting percentage, while the
Northerners could manage only a .300
"batting average."
FRIDAY GAME DIFFERENT
Friday's game was as different
from Saturday's game as night from
day. The Beavers surged at the end
of the first half lo take a 32-26 lead
at halftime. This was the biggest lead
of the half for either team as the
score was knotted eight times.
The Beavers just about put the
game on ice as the second half opened
with an eight-point splurge thait ran
the count out to 40-26. OSC ap
peared to be well in command with
Gambee, giant Wayne Moss and Bob
Allord controlling the boards, but the
Indians began to creep back.
With seven minutes remaining in
the last half, Stanford was down 10
points at 54 - 44. Gambee dropped
through two free throws, but Van

Galder and Bond hit from the field
to cut Oregon State's lead to eight.
Moss kept the Staters well up as
he suddenly found the range with
three field goals while the Cards
could manage only a two-pointer by
Bond.
CRIMINS SCORES
Jerry Crimins scored from the field
for Oregon State to extend the Bea
vers' lead to 14 points. At this- point,
Stanford clawed back into contention
with six straight points, but it was a
last gasp effort as the two teams
traded virtually point for point until
the final gun.
Bond and Selleck led the Indians
with 14 and 12 poinlts respectively,
but high-scoring honors went to the
promising Gambee, who racked up
22. He was followed in the OSC col
umn by Crimins with 12 and Allord,
Moss and Ken Nanson with 11 each.
STANFORD CHILLY
Stanford shot for a chilly .285 per
centage while the Boa vers were good
on .393 of their shots. OSC led in
rebounds, 47-40.
In other conference games, Wash
ington crushed Washington State
twice, 62-42 and 80-57, and Oregon
and Idaho split with the Ducks win
ning Friday night, 84-76, and the
Vandals taking the Saturday night
contest. 61-59.
Cal, Southern Cal and UCLA all
drew byes ibecause of final exams.
The split left Stanford with a con
ference record of four wins and two
losses—good for fourth place.
UCLA LEADS
UCLA still leads with a perfect 4-0
record, and Washington and South
ern Cal are tied for second with 3-1
each. Cal and Oregon both have two
wins and two losses to tie for fifth
behind the Indians.
Oregon State ranks seventh with
two wins and four defeats, and Idaho
and Washington State bring up the
rear with one win and five defeats
each. N
This week's schedule finds Oregon

at Stanford, Washington at Oregon
State and Southern Cal at Idaho.
In non-conference games, UCLA
plays Airzona State Saturday night,
and Cal meets ÜbF, also on Saturday
night.

The Stanford JV and frosh
squads ca c h recorded a victory
over the weekend. The Braves
whipped Mare Island Navy, 66-59,
on Friday night, and the Papooses
edged Marin J.C., 62-59, on Satur
day night. Stories on both of these
games will appear in tomorrow's
Daily.

during Friday night's Oregon State-Stanford game.
Identifiable Stanford players are Barry Brown (mid

with six straight points, but it was a
last gasp effort as the two teams
traded virtually point for point until
the final gun.
Bond and Selleck led the Indians
with 14 and 12 poinlts respectively,
but high-scoring honors went to the
promising Gambee, who racked up
22. He was followed in the OSC col
umn by Crimins with 12 and Allord,
Moss and Ken Nanson with 11 each.
STANFORD CHILLY
Stanford shot for a chilly .285 per
centage while the Boa vers were good
on .393 of their shots. OSC led in
rebounds, 47-40.
In other conference games, Wash
ington crushed Washington State
twice, 62-42 and 80-57, and Oregon

The split left Stanford with a con
ference record of four wins and two
losses—good for fourth place.
UCLA LEADS
UCLA still leads with a perfect 4-0

each. Cal and Oregon both have two
wins and two losses to tie for fifth
behind the Indians.

The Stanford JV and frosh
squads ca c h recorded a victory

SIX MEN go high into the air to snare this rebound
during Friday night's Oregon State-Stanford game.
Identifiable Stanford players are Barry Brown (mid
dle jumper), Bill Bond (9) and Hap Wagner (ex-

treme right). The Oregon Staters pictured are Dave
Gambee (10) and Wayne Moss (39). Oregon State
won this game, 69-59, hut Stanford came back to crush
the Beavers, 75-50, on Saturday afternoon.
Stanford's scrapping Indians
bounced back Saturday after
noon to crush the Oregon State
College Beavers, 75,-50, after
dropping the series opener on
Friday night, 69-59.
The Indians came out in the second
Same with a half-court press that
all but ran the inexperienced Staters
right out of their own coliseum.
Time and time again the Beavers
lost the ball before getting a shot off
to coach Howie Dallmar's ball-hawk
ing crew. At one point Stanford ran
up 10 straight points while Oregon
State did not even shoot.
The game started as though it was
going to be a replay of Friday night's

contest, which saw the Northerners
in complete domination. The Beavers
ran up an 8-4 lead, but then the
Cards began to press in earnest and
Oregon State began to fold.
Stanford pulled up into a 12-12 tie
and i ipped out into a huge lead with
a 22-point outburst while the Beav
ers could manage to score only two.
Instrumental in the Stanford burst
were George Selleck, Carl Isaacs and
Bill Bond who were the chief thieves.
Isaacs, in particular, was on his toes.
Three times in near succession he
picked off a pass and went the dis
tance.
BOND STEALS BALL
Bond and Selleck on numerous oc
casions swept in behind an unsus
pecting Orangeman and picked up
the dribble right out of the unnerved
Beaver's hands.
The Staters always managed to get
the ball over the center line, but not
much farther. The tenacious Card
defense wouldn't allow the slower
Beavers to drive through, and the
OSC passing left nothing to be de
sired as far as Stanford was con
cerned.
The Oregon State players were the

picture of frustration as the game,
for a period of about five minutes in
the first half, was played entirely
between the OSC foul line and the
Stanford basket.
The halftime score found the In
dians out in front by a count of 42-20.
Dallmar poured in the reserves
early in the second half, but the score
continued to mount with Ron Wag
ner and Clint Waring leading the of
fensive thrusts for Stanford.
Late in the second half, the Indians
doubled the Staters at 68-34. At this
point, OSC's outstanding sophomore
forward, Dave Gambce, began to
drill 'through shots from all over the
floor to pace a Beaver spurt that al
most made the final score respect
able.
SCORING BALANCED
Stanford's scoring was well dis
tributed. Bond led with 12 counters,
and he was followed by Bill Flanders
and Isaacs with 10 each. Ron Wagner
chippcd in nine and Van Galder ac
counted for eight.
Gambce was high scorer for the
game with 16 points.
The Indians scorched the nets with
a .466 shooting percentage, while the
Northerners could manage only a .300
"batting average."
FRIDAY GAME DIFFERENT
Friday's game was as different
from Saturday's game as night from
day. The Beavers surged at the end
of the first half lo take a 32-26 lead
at halftime. This was the biggest lead
of the half for either team as the
score was knotted eight times.
The Beavers just about put the
game on ice as the second half opened
with an eight-point splurge thait ran
the count out to 40-26. OSC ap
peared to be well in command with
Gambee, giant Wayne Moss and Bob
Allord controlling the boards, but the
Indians began to creep back.
With seven minutes remaining in
the last half, Stanford was down 10
points at 54 - 44. Gambee dropped
through two free throws, but Van

Galder and Bond hit from the field
to cut Oregon State's lead to eight.
Moss kept the Staters well up as
he suddenly found the range with
three field goals while the Cards
could manage only a two-pointer by
Bond.

The Oregon State players were the

picture of frustration as the game,
for a period of about five minutes in
the first half, was played entirely
between the OSC foul line and the
Stanford basket.
The halftime score found the In
dians out in front by a count of 42-20.
Dallmar poured in the reserves
early in the second half, but the score
continued to mount with Ron Wag
ner and Clint Waring leading the of
fensive thrusts for Stanford.
Late in the second half, the Indians
doubled the Staters at 68-34. At this
point, OSC's outstanding sophomore
forward, Dave Gambce, began to
drill 'through shots from all over the
floor to pace a Beaver spurt that al
most made the final score respect
able.
SCORING BALANCED
Stanford's scoring was well dis
tributed. Bond led with 12 counters,
and he was followed by Bill Flanders
and Isaacs with 10 each. Ron Wagner
chippcd in nine and Van Galder ac
counted for eight.
Gambce was high scorer for the
game with 16 points.
The Indians scorched the nets with
a .466 shooting percentage, while the
Northerners could manage only a .300
"batting average."
FRIDAY GAME DIFFERENT
Friday's game was as different
from Saturday's game as night from
day. The Beavers surged at the end
of the first half lo take a 32-26 lead
at halftime. This was the biggest lead
of the half for either team as the
score was knotted eight times.
The Beavers just about put the
game on ice as the second half opened
with an eight-point splurge thait ran
the count out to 40-26. OSC ap
peared to be well in command with
Gambee, giant Wayne Moss and Bob
Allord controlling the boards, but the
Indians began to creep back.
With seven minutes remaining in
the last half, Stanford was down 10
points at 54 - 44. Gambee dropped
through two free throws, but Van

Galder and Bond hit from the field
to cut Oregon State's lead to eight.
Moss kept the Staters well up as
he suddenly found the range with
three field goals while the Cards
could manage only a two-pointer by
Bond.
CRIMINS SCORES
Jerry Crimins scored from the field
for Oregon State to extend the Bea
vers' lead to 14 points. At this- point,
Stanford clawed back into contention
with six straight points, but it was a
last gasp effort as the two teams
traded virtually point for point until
the final gun.
Bond and Selleck led the Indians
with 14 and 12 poinlts respectively,
but high-scoring honors went to the
promising Gambee, who racked up
22. He was followed in the OSC col
umn by Crimins with 12 and Allord,
Moss and Ken Nanson with 11 each.
STANFORD CHILLY
Stanford shot for a chilly .285 per
centage while the Boa vers were good
on .393 of their shots. OSC led in
rebounds, 47-40.
In other conference games, Wash
ington crushed Washington State
twice, 62-42 and 80-57, and Oregon
and Idaho split with the Ducks win
ning Friday night, 84-76, and the
Vandals taking the Saturday night
contest. 61-59.
Cal, Southern Cal and UCLA all
drew byes ibecause of final exams.
The split left Stanford with a con
ference record of four wins and two
losses—good for fourth place.
UCLA LEADS
UCLA still leads with a perfect 4-0
record, and Washington and South
ern Cal are tied for second with 3-1
each. Cal and Oregon both have two
wins and two losses to tie for fifth
behind the Indians.
Oregon State ranks seventh with
two wins and four defeats, and Idaho
and Washington State bring up the
rear with one win and five defeats
each. N
This week's schedule finds Oregon

at Stanford, Washington at Oregon
State and Southern Cal at Idaho.
In non-conference games, UCLA
plays Airzona State Saturday night,
and Cal meets ÜbF, also on Saturday
night.

The Stanford JV and frosh
squads ca c h recorded a victory
over the weekend. The Braves
whipped Mare Island Navy, 66-59,
on Friday night, and the Papooses
edged Marin J.C., 62-59, on Satur
day night. Stories on both of these
games will appear in tomorrow's

SIX MEN go high into the air to snare this rebound
during Friday night's Oregon State-Stanford game.
Identifiable Stanford players are Barry Brown (mid
dle jumper), Bill Bond (9) and Hap Wagner (ex-

treme right). The Oregon Staters pictured are Dave
Gambee (10) and Wayne Moss (39). Oregon State
won this game, 69-59, hut Stanford came back to crush

Stanford's scrapping Indians
bounced back Saturday after
noon to crush the Oregon State
College Beavers, 75,-50, after
dropping the series opener on
Friday night, 69-59.
The Indians came out in the second
Same with a half-court press that
all but ran the inexperienced Staters
right out of their own coliseum.
Time and time again the Beavers
lost the ball before getting a shot off
to coach Howie Dallmar's ball-hawk

up 10 straight points while Oregon
State did not even shoot.
The game started as though it was

Oregon State began to fold.
Stanford pulled up into a 12-12 tie
and i ipped out into a huge lead with
a 22-point outburst while the Beav

Instrumental in the Stanford burst
were George Selleck, Carl Isaacs and
Bill Bond who were the chief thieves.
Isaacs, in particular, was on his toes.
Three times in near succession he
picked off a pass and went the dis
tance.
BOND STEALS BALL
Bond and Selleck on numerous oc
casions swept in behind an unsus
pecting Orangeman and picked up
the dribble right out of the unnerved
Beaver's hands.
The Staters always managed to get
the ball over the center line, but not
much farther. The tenacious Card
defense wouldn't allow the slower
Beavers to drive through, and the
OSC passing left nothing to be de

SIX MEN go high into the air to snare this rebound
during Friday night's Oregon State-Stanford game.
Identifiable Stanford players are Barry Brown (mid
dle jumper), Bill Bond (9) and Hap Wagner (ex-

treme right). The Oregon Staters pictured are Dave
Gambee (10) and Wayne Moss (39). Oregon State
won this game, 69-59, hut Stanford came back to crush
the Beavers, 75-50, on Saturday afternoon.
Stanford's scrapping Indians
bounced back Saturday after
noon to crush the Oregon State
College Beavers, 75,-50, after
dropping the series opener on
Friday night, 69-59.
The Indians came out in the second
Same with a half-court press that
all but ran the inexperienced Staters
right out of their own coliseum.
Time and time again the Beavers
lost the ball before getting a shot off
to coach Howie Dallmar's ball-hawk
ing crew. At one point Stanford ran
up 10 straight points while Oregon
State did not even shoot.
The game started as though it was
going to be a replay of Friday night's

contest, which saw the Northerners
in complete domination. The Beavers
ran up an 8-4 lead, but then the
Cards began to press in earnest and
Oregon State began to fold.
Stanford pulled up into a 12-12 tie
and i ipped out into a huge lead with
a 22-point outburst while the Beav
ers could manage to score only two.
Instrumental in the Stanford burst
were George Selleck, Carl Isaacs and
Bill Bond who were the chief thieves.
Isaacs, in particular, was on his toes.
Three times in near succession he
picked off a pass and went the dis
tance.
BOND STEALS BALL
Bond and Selleck on numerous oc
casions swept in behind an unsus
pecting Orangeman and picked up
the dribble right out of the unnerved
Beaver's hands.
The Staters always managed to get
the ball over the center line, but not
much farther. The tenacious Card
defense wouldn't allow the slower
Beavers to drive through, and the
OSC passing left nothing to be de
sired as far as Stanford was con
cerned.
The Oregon State players were the

picture of frustration as the game,
for a period of about five minutes in
the first half, was played entirely
between the OSC foul line and the
Stanford basket.
The halftime score found the In
dians out in front by a count of 42-20.
Dallmar poured in the reserves
early in the second half, but the score
continued to mount with Ron Wag
ner and Clint Waring leading the of
fensive thrusts for Stanford.
Late in the second half, the Indians
doubled the Staters at 68-34. At this
point, OSC's outstanding sophomore
forward, Dave Gambce, began to
drill 'through shots from all over the
floor to pace a Beaver spurt that al
most made the final score respect
able.
SCORING BALANCED
Stanford's scoring was well dis
tributed. Bond led with 12 counters,
and he was followed by Bill Flanders
and Isaacs with 10 each. Ron Wagner
chippcd in nine and Van Galder ac
counted for eight.
Gambce was high scorer for the
game with 16 points.
The Indians scorched the nets with
a .466 shooting percentage, while the
Northerners could manage only a .300
"batting average."
FRIDAY GAME DIFFERENT
Friday's game was as different
from Saturday's game as night from
day. The Beavers surged at the end
of the first half lo take a 32-26 lead
at halftime. This was the biggest lead
of the half for either team as the
score was knotted eight times.
The Beavers just about put the
game on ice as the second half opened
with an eight-point splurge thait ran
the count out to 40-26. OSC ap
peared to be well in command with
Gambee, giant Wayne Moss and Bob
Allord controlling the boards, but the
Indians began to creep back.
With seven minutes remaining in
the last half, Stanford was down 10
points at 54 - 44. Gambee dropped
through two free throws, but Van

Galder and Bond hit from the field
to cut Oregon State's lead to eight.
Moss kept the Staters well up as
he suddenly found the range with
three field goals while the Cards
could manage only a two-pointer by
Bond.
CRIMINS SCORES
Jerry Crimins scored from the field
for Oregon State to extend the Bea
vers' lead to 14 points. At this- point,
Stanford clawed back into contention
with six straight points, but it was a
last gasp effort as the two teams
traded virtually point for point until
the final gun.
Bond and Selleck led the Indians
with 14 and 12 poinlts respectively,
but high-scoring honors went to the
promising Gambee, who racked up
22. He was followed in the OSC col
umn by Crimins with 12 and Allord,
Moss and Ken Nanson with 11 each.
STANFORD CHILLY
Stanford shot for a chilly .285 per
centage while the Boa vers were good
on .393 of their shots. OSC led in
rebounds, 47-40.
In other conference games, Wash
ington crushed Washington State
twice, 62-42 and 80-57, and Oregon
and Idaho split with the Ducks win
ning Friday night, 84-76, and the
Vandals taking the Saturday night
contest. 61-59.
Cal, Southern Cal and UCLA all
drew byes ibecause of final exams.
The split left Stanford with a con
ference record of four wins and two
losses—good for fourth place.
UCLA LEADS
UCLA still leads with a perfect 4-0
record, and Washington and South
ern Cal are tied for second with 3-1
each. Cal and Oregon both have two
wins and two losses to tie for fifth
behind the Indians.
Oregon State ranks seventh with
two wins and four defeats, and Idaho
and Washington State bring up the
rear with one win and five defeats
each. N
This week's schedule finds Oregon

and Cal meets ÜbF, also on Saturday
night.
