Manoukian a Delta Tau Delta, Long

FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS
WUS funds in the past have ena
bled thousands of university students
in impoverished countries to con
tinue their education. Many brilliant
and well-educated students abroad
do not have the money to buy text
books or respectable clothing and, in
some cases, not even adequate food.
Foreign universities often cannot
provide medical aid or dormitories
for students too poor to buy medicine
or to rent rooms near the college.
Raither than sacrifice the chance for
an education, many students struggle
on in conditions Americans would
find unbearable.
Among WUS projects during the
past year, nine dormitories were built
throughout the world in areas of
particular need. Seoul, Korea, for in
stance, was so ravaged by bombing
that many of the regular inhabitants
themselves were homeless and, in ad
dition, the city was still clogged with
refugees.
KOREAN PROBLEM
Korean education has been forbid
den or severely hindered by a long
series of conquerors, and the country
has a great need tor educated men.
A WUS hostel built in Seoul last year
accommodates 54 destitute students
In Greece, American contributions
helped to repair a women's dormi
tory in Athens and to purchase coal
to heat it during the bitter winter.
Other WUS funds purchased the
materials with which students at Mo
lusi College, in the Nigerian jungle,
built their own dispensary.
Japanese students, themselves very
poor, have contributed half the funds
to build a sanitarium near Tokyo for
students suffering from tuberculosis.
This disease is much more common in
Japan than here. WUS has provided
the other half of the necessary funds.
The critical need for textbooks in
countries where much of the popu
lace is illiterate and the relatively
recent liberation from foreign rule
that makes educated leaders neces
sary is being met by the students
themselves.
As one example, in Korea, Indo
nesia and Pakistan, students mimeo
graph textbooks with Mimeograph
machines donated by WUS.


NEW "WONDER DRUG" provided by the World University Scrviee Fund
is administered at the WUS Health Center in Dacca, East Pakistan. Badly
needed modern equipment has also been installed at the WUS center in a
campaign to save the lives of stricken Pakistani students.
