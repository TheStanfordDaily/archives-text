# Cilley Hangs, But Lives To Tell Tale
## 'Worn-Out Humorists' String Up Daily Critic 
### HELEN DEWAR 
It's happened to football
coaches, unpopular professors,
and now it's happened to Daily
columnist Earl Cilley.
In a vigorous but silent assault
against Cilley tor his cryptic preview
of the Chaparral in yesterday's Daily
an anonymous band of Chappie writ
ers dangled Cilley in effigy in front
of the Cellar.
He swung there limply most of
the day, a Kid appendage to the
Chappie's banner across Lasuen
Street.
Clioppie Editor Bill Hindle ex
plained the hanging as "just a little
exuberance among the staff that
manifested itself in the hanging of
an effigy."
But Cilley had a little more to
say about it.
"My firm conviction that the quar
ters of the Chaparral are tenanted
by a crew of spineless fainthearts,"
he said, "has only been reinforced by
the display of craven skullduggery
yesterday afternoon.
"If the poor, bemused dullards of
the Hammer and Coffin had possess
ed any courage or originality, they
would have hanged the real thing,
not an obvious imitation."
Hindle was happy about the hang
ing, but not out of any morbid desire
to see Cilley swing.
"It was good," he said joyfully, "to
see some spirit and life among the
staff, for a change.
"The staff came into the Chappie
Shack this morning," he said, "very
chauvinistic and jingoistic â€” just
bubbling over.
"They said they were going to
hang the effigy, and I said, 'Dand
ily'."
With that official sanction, the staff
bubbled off to hoist the effigy.
"They weren't bitter or resentful,"
the Chappie chief added. "The effigy
was only for publicity purposes. It
reflected downright Daily - Chappie
antagonism."
Cilley suggested a simple solution
for the whole situation. He proposed
"the curious collection of superan
nuated hacks now comprising the
'old guard' of the Chaparral be gent
ly led out somewhere back of the
golf course and hamstrung, for the
only object more pitiable than an
old fire horse is a worn-out humor
ist."
