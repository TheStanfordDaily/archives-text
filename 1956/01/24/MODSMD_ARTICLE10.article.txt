### 
WASHINGTON â€” A hot. political
row boiled up today over a House
subcommittee report which severely
criticized Defense Secretary Charles
E. Wilson, his top aides and other
business men in government.
Republican members of a Demo
cratic-controlled House Government
Operations subcommittee angrily

i protested they had not had time to
study the document, disclosed yes
terday by the United Press. They
denounced it as an unwarranted at
tack on the Eisenhower Administra
tion.
The report charges that Wilson
and his Defense Department aides
violated a congressional mandate
that an integrated supply system be
set up among the military services.
It stems from hearings held last May
on Hoover Commiss-ion charges of
military waste.
