### 
WASHINGTONâ€”Senate Republi
can leader William F. Knowland
said today he will let his name stay
on the primary ballots in Illinois
and Alaska because of the uncer
tainty over President Eisenhower's
political plans.
Knowland, who was formally no
tified that he had been entered in
the primaries, said he will support
Mr. Eisenhower if the President de
cides to seek re-election. But the
Illinois and Alaska actions made him
the first, serious GOP contender if
the President does not. run.

Appearing on the Mutual radio
program "Reporters' Roundup" a
few hours later, he rejected sugges
tions that the Republican party be
made over in Mr. Eisenhower's im
age. He said the GOP is "bigger than
any individual."
Knowland declared that the GOP
could make "no greater mistake"
than "liquidating the conservatives"
in its ranks. He expressed his "tre
mendous" respect for Mr. Eisenhow
er and predicted he will be renomi
nated and re-elected, if he runs.
Knowland made clear he does not
believe the GOP must nominate a
carbon-copy of the President if Mr.
Eisenhower declines to run.
Newsmen interviewing Knowland
remarked that some GOP leaders
have stressed the need for "an Eis
enhower Republican" to represent
the party if the President does not
make the. race. One suggested that
the President's aides have been try
ing to remake the party "in his
image."
Knowland said the Republican
party existed before Mr. Eisenhow
er's election and will go on existing
after tihe President is gone. "I think
the party is bigger than any indi
vidual," hp said.
