# Mobs Riot Against Indian Government
## 
### 
NEW DELHI â€” Mobs spilled
through the streets of the western
India state of Orissa today, beating
officials and burning property in an
extension of anti-government riots
which turned the modern city of
Bombay into a battlefield.
Bombay itself was calm. Police re
ported "all quiet everywhere" after
seven days of Communist-fomented
riots against government plans to
partition Indian states along lan
guage lines.
The government of Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru refused to knuck
le under to the demands of the riot
ers. Troops were ordered to Orissa,
located on the Bay of Bengal, to put
down the disturbances there lest
they mushroom to the proportions of
the fighting in Bombay.
Mobs roamed through Cuttack and
the city of Puri, 45 miles from the
capital, attacking government instal
lations and officials.
Nevertheless, the government said
it is going ahead with redistricting
plans. It announced that the states
of West. Bengal, which encompasses
Calcutta, and Bihar will be merged.
