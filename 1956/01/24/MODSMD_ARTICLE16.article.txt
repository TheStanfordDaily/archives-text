The response to the Tuesday Evening Series,
when there is a response, is usually from the
faculty and the people of Palo Alto. The speak
ers generally attract few of the undergraduate
population of this community into Memorial
Auditorium. The students, in their customary
fashion, don't make the effort.
Tonight, we suggest that they do. Dr. Mar
geiy Bailey is talking on "A Testament of
Teaching" at 7:30.
If you have taken one of Miss Bailey's

courses in the English Department, particularly
her course in Shakespeare, or if you have
heard her speak previously, we expect that
you will want to attend tonight.
If you have not heard her speak, tonight
may be your last opportunity —an opportunity
you should not lightly pass up—because she
retires at the end of this year.
Stanford is prqud of Margery Bailey, and
justly so. She has become part of Stanfordiana.
Because she herself is a testament of teaching.
