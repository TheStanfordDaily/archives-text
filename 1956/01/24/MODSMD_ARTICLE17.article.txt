# conforming—in a void

### 
The Chaparral, Stanford's finest humor mag
azine, has proved the case—the case against
itself.
Monday morning in The Stanford Daily
(famed as the Peninsula's only morning news
paper), columnist Earl Cilley, Esq., warned that
The Chaparral's latest "vapid and foolish . . .
compendium of puerile and poolroom humor"
would soon haul itself to curbstone height to
panhandle more cash from the sons and daugh
ters of the wealthy few.
Mr. Cilley's point: The Chaparral is in effect
nothing more than a compilation of the most
often-told poor jokes on record. Originality?
Not in The Chaparral.

Yesterday, The Chaparral proved Mr. Cil
ley's point. In place of originality, a void.
Mr. Cilley was hanged in effigy.
Even The Chaparral, we thought, could do
better than that.
But, alas, The Chaparral fell into the trap of
repetition and conformity. These days, when
you can't think of what to do about those who
displease you, the only solution is to hang
them in effigy.
Writers of Letters to the Editor are more crea
tive and imaginative than effigy lynchers.
But perhaps we should appreciate The Chap
arral when it appears. It isn't always with us,
you know.
