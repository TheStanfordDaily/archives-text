They are having a contest at Brigham Young
University that matches Stanford's ugly man
election. It's the "Little Man on Campus"
battle.
The student that best represents Worthal,
the coed that is a replica of Lillian Lush and the
bloodthirsty prof that best depicts Professor
Snarf will be picked by students at the polls
this week. The winners will be announced at
the "Bibler Bounce" dance on Friday.
A contest of this sort might prove interesting
at Stanford. The Snarf election would really be
a hotly contested race.

At Columbia they are having trouble with
students cheating at exams. The student gov
ernment and the faculty are considering inau
gurating an honor code system similar to that
at Stanford.
The student newspaper, the Columbia Spec
tator, advocates the system in a front-page edi
torial, declaring it would bring about a change
of attitude which would slow down the cheat
ing, which apparently has gotten out of hand at
the New York university.

Fraternity pledges have caused guite a rum
pus at the University of Oregon. The student
disciplinary committee unanimously prohib
ited fraternity dances foe a few weeks after the
pledges went on a destruction spree during
liell week.

Students arc deeply crushed at the Univer
sity of British Columbia. It appears they in
vited Christine lorgensen to be gueen of their
Mardi Gras dance and "she" declined. So now
they'll have to settle for a university coed.

The Fiji house at the University of Texas is
having its entertainment these days provided
by a big, black canine mascot named Dusty
Rhodes. And the pooch is guite a character.
for one thing, he is the only dog member
of Alcoholics Anonymous. Dusty a few years

back developed a definite taste for wine and a
considerate house member kept him well sup
plied. One night the dog overdid it and be
came rather soused, staggering all over the
house and barking feebly.
He had a hangover that lasted more than a
week, and since then he has growled at any
body who has offered him alcohol.
A year ago Dusty became fascinated by a
fraternity member who disliked him intensely.
When Dusty would follow the man to the sleep
ing porch, the fraternity member would snap
his fingers, grab the dog, and throw him off the
porch into the bushes two stories below. This
happened so often that all the guy had to do
was snap his fingers and the dog would leap
off the porch of his own accord.

Tippy Dye, the University of Washington
basketball mentor, has made some long-range
predictions. The champion San Francisco Dons,
he said, will end their winning streak when
they meet the UCLA Bruins.
In making this prediction, Dye actually made
two forecasts in one, as the Bruins must first
win the Coast Conference championship be
fore they can meet the Dons in the NCAA re
gional playoffs next March in Corvallis, Ore
gon.

Cornell University is now considering the
lack of student-faculty relations outside the for
mal classroom situation. The Student Council
has established a committee to investigate the
problem, which seems to be caused by the size
of the university, the demands on the faculty
and the conflicting interests of the undergrad
uates.
In the Cornell Daily Sun, an editorial stated
that formal efforts to correct individual inade
quacies would provide no "ultimate solution"
but "perhaps they can serve a valuable func
tion in breaking down at least some of the ob
vious barriers to closer student-faculty com
munication and understanding."
