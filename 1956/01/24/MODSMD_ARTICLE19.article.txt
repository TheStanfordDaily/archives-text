weeding-out factor
'JV) the Editor:
Dr. |Rixford K.| Snyder's explanation of the Stan
ford admissions policy, as reported in Thursday's
D • il y, answered several important questions. But,
their is one point which we think requires greater
elarifir.-it.ion. This is the meaning of "the adjustment
potential of the student."
To explain it away as "a weeding-out factor, elimi
nating the unstable applicants" does nothing to dis
tinguish this factor from the other factors considered,
all of which eliminate unstable applicants either di
rectly or indirectly.
According to the figures in the Daily article, this
factor represents slightly more than one-eighth of the
total qualifications of the applicant. This is large
enough to be the determining factor in many cases.
VVhatf then, is being determined?
A high school student with adequate grades, test
scores and recommendations will obviously not be so
unstable that he cannot profit from a Stanford educa
tion. Is the University demanding that its entrants he

to absorb the spirit, of Lbo Stanford Family as
well as just being good students? It is our opinion that
there is already on this campus "adjustment potential"
ad nauseam.
We think a clear explanation of the University's in
terpretation of this "weeding out factor" would be
extremely informative.

(Editor's Note: According to l>r. Snyder, high
school grades and aptitude test scores are weighed
about one-third each in considering an applicant.
The other one-third is the applicant's high school
record, exclusive of grades.
(One-half of this remaining factor relates to the
student's citizenship, his purposes in attending a
university and b«s activities. The other one-half, or
one-sixth of the whole, is based on the letters of
recommendation from the principal or counselor
and the faculty member.

factors which would enhance his chances of admis
