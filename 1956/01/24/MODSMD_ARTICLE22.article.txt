## 
### 
KZSU's transmitter to Stanford
Union was hauled off to the station
for repairs last week but will be
ready for use soon, according to
Frank Smolar, station manager.
At that time transmission to the
Union will be resumed.
The transmitter is temporary.
K.ZSU is now building a new trans
mitter which it hopes to install at
the end of this quarter.
Under the direction of Terry Bate
man, about four student engineers
are ait work on the project. Though
a new transmitter normally costs
from $750 to $1000, KZSU workers
will cut the cost to approximately
$250 by doing the job themselves.
"This is where a student station
excels," said Smolar. "Though we
sometimes make mistakes, that's half
the fun of it."
Besides the Union transmitter, the
Village, Toyon and Lagunita trans
mitters are also temporary.
"When they were put in six years
ago, people forgot they were tem
porary," Smolar related. "Our goal
is to replace them with two new
ones a year."
