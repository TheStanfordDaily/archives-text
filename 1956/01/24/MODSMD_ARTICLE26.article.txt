# 'Guys and Dolls' Sparkles With Humor, Originality
## Brando, Sinatra Shine in Spectacular Movie Version of Damon Runyon Gambling Story 
### ELLEN SPIEGL 
"The oldest established permanent floating crap game in New
York" cleverly involves its participants in the Save a Soul Mis
sion, a rather expensive evening in a city sewer and, for several
of the gamblers, matrimony in MGM's farcical musical comedy
"Guys and Dolls."
The Technicolor, CinemaScope, stereophonic-sound extrava-

ganza is not hampered by all these"
technical devices used to draw a
crowd. Based on the Broadway play
of the same name, "Guys and Dolls,"
an adaptation of a Damon Runyon
story, offers the viewer a memorable
evening's entertainment.
The cast is headed by Frank Si
natra and Marlon Brando and turns
in a fine, convincing performance.
Sinatra, as a lovable gambler and
proprietor of the floating crap game,
handles the role smoothly. His fian
cee of 14 years, Adelaide (Vivian
Blaine), persues him perhaps even
more violently than do the police.
COMEDY TALENT
Miss Blaine exhibits her talent for
comedy in two extravagant musical
numbers. In "Take Back Your
Mink" she turns in her best per
formance in the movie, along with a
chorus line of expensively dressed,
rather weak-voiced females.
The surprise of the movie was the
skill which Marlon Brando and Jean
Simmons exhibited in roles different
from anything either has attempted.
Marlon Brando, as Sky Masterson,
is a rough and rich gambler who
finds himself involved, via a wager,
with the provocative sergeant of the
Save a Soul mission (Jean Sim
mons). Brando proves himself a ver
satile actor for once and for all with
his singing and dancing.
In his rendition of "Luck Be a
Lady Tonight" he shows himself the
possessor of an adequate voice and
better than average dancing abili
ties. Miss Simmons presents an in
nocently appealing personality, with
her intoxicated rendition of "If I
Were a Bell," one of the high points
of the film.
MINOR ROLES
Most of the minor roles were bril
liantly done. The gamblers' rendi
tion of "Sit Down, You're Rocking
the Boat" while at a mission prayer
meeting—they were forced to at
tend when they lost a bet to Master
son—was done with humorous pol
ish.
Much of the risque and more than
slightly suggestive dialogue was ta
ken directly from the play, and in
itself would be enough to carry the
movie.
