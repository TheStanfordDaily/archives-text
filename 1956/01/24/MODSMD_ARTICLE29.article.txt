## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's powerful wrestling squad muscled its way to a
crushing 24-5 victory over Santa Clara last Thursday night on
the Broncos' home mat. This win was the third straight for the
rugged Indian grapplers.
Santa Clara only narrowly avoided being held pointless as

they managed to win only one match
during the course of the evening. In
the 137-pound class the Broncos'
Thad Roberts posted a second-period
triumph over sophomore Bob Car
mod y.
In the 123-pound class Santa Clara
couldn't scare up an entry and was
forced to forfeit the points to Stan
ford's Bob Fisher. In the 130-pound
event the same thing happened, but
the Indian regular, Jerry Lowell,
was not available either, so no points
were awarded.
LIKINS VICTOR
Pete Likins, always a winner for
the Cards, picked up a few more
points for the cause with a third
period pin over Santa Clara's Tony
Firpo.
Another consistent mat performer,
Ray Miller, iced the 157-pound event
with a decision over Art Wilde.
167-pounder Alan Laubscher took
honors in the next class with his

triumph over IJud Uranizal of the
Broncos.
Light - heavy weight Bill Pitkin
George Nulk in the 177-
pound event.
HEAVYWEIGHT WIN
The final match of the evening
ended quickly with Roger Edelson's
first-period pin of Harold Davis.

the men's gymnasium in Berkeley.
Fisher, Lowell, Likins, Don Da

classes.
