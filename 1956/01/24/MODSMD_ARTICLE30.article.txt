# Braves Blast Mare Island
## 
### DAVE CANFIELD 
Although committing 23 fouls to
the opponents' nine before a hostile
crowd, Stanford's Braves led most
of the way to whip Mare Island
Naval Base, 66-59, last Friday night.
Control of the backboards was
Stan 112 or d's main advantage. The
Braves consistently outrebounded
the Mariners. Leading the way was
Nick Vojvodich with 18 rebounds.
Stanford also showed the way in
field shooting. They poured in 29
field goals to Mare Island's 16.
Heading the attack was guard
Jerry Rose with 12 markers on six
buckets, nearly all long set shots.
Rose had to take a back seat, how
ever, to Dillard Scott, the Mariners'
flashy forward. Scott, a slippery
dribbler and sure shot, rained in
seven baskets and 11 foul shots for
a 25-point barrage.
But center Arnie Stone, Mare Is
land's leading scorer .this season with
156 tallies, was held to a meager five
points by the 6 ft. 7 in. Vojvodich.
Vojvodich turned in 10 points him
self.
The game was off to a slow start.
At 11.45 of the first half Stanford
led by only 11-6.
Then Scott scored a point a min
ute for six minutes as Mare Island's
speedsters fast-broke to a 21-18 lead.
But two straight lay-ups by Stan
ford's John Henderson returned the
lead to the Braves, 26-23, at half
time.
In the second half Stanford led
all the way. Midway in the half Rose
hit four straight 30-foot set shots as
the Braves drew away to a 50-36
bulge.
