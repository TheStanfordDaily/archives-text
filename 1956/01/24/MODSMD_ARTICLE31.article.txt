# Toro I Edges Past Campo In Mural Tilt
## 
### 
El Toro I's intramural cagers
edged El Campo, 28-27, last night as
Dick Nusser sank the winning lay
up with three minutes left.
El Toro stalled out the rest of the
game as El Campo frantically fouled
and the victors frantically missed
foul shots but fortunately grabbed
the abounds.
For Toro it was a come-from
behind victory, sparked by Nusser.
Entering the game midway in the
second half with El Toro down, 21-
15, the lanky Nusser dominated the
boards to give his team the incentive
to win.
In the scoring department, short,
set-shooting Dick Schmidt topped
the Toros with eight points. Dick
Firestone added six and Bob King
five.
For El Campo, guard Gene Tanke
and forward Craig Rushforth each
swished six tallies.
The garrfe started out with both
teams playing sloppily, and finished
that way. This led to frequent inter
ceptions.
The chief ball hawkers were Jack
Lohrey, John Eastman, King, Fire
stone and Schmidt for Toro; Boyd
Fortrell, Marty Horowitz, A 1 Keller
and Tanke for Campo.
Before the Toros had a chance to
catch their breath, Campo jurryoed
off to a 4-0 lead on quick lay-ups by
John Strohbehn and Tanke.
But Toro lost no time knotting the
count at 4-4 as Schmidt and King
hit. The rest of the second half the
lead see-sawed. Neither team ever
led by more than two markers.
Midway in the second half El
Campo poured in five straight points
and went ahead, 21-15. Then Nusser
took over.
