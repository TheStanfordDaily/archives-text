# Card Boxers Dumped 3-5 By Tough Santa Clara
## 
### 
Coach Ray Lunny's Stanford boxing team made a creditable
showing but dropped a match to Santa Clara 5-3 Friday night,
with two forfeits making the difference in the contest. The match
was held at Santa Clara.
Stanford got off to a good start as Bill Clark garnered a de-

cision over Frank Soriano in the -1
second round of the 125-rpound
match.
In college bouts knockouts and
technical knockouts are not scored
as such, being termed decisions in
stead.
The Indians were forced to forfeit
the 132-pound class to the Broncos.
Santa Clara edged ahead on points
as Terry Bibbens of the Indians lost
a decision to Bob Ratliff in the first
round.
Stanford evened it up again when
the 147-pound match came up. In a
wild slugfest that never slowed
down, George Batcabe won a three
round decision over Chuck Wiswall.
This was the outstanding contest of
the night.
Batcabe's effort seemed wasted,
however, as Santa Clara moved
ahead the easy way via a Stanford
forfeit in the 156-pound class.
Santa Clara's Art Crosetti tagged
Leo Amadei with a loss in the third
round of the 165-pound bout.

Sherm Welpton found Santa Cla
ra's Marty Sammon a little too tough
as he dropped a third-round deci
sion in the 178-pound class.
Heavyweight Bob Birkie, defeated
only once in three years, put on his
usual sound exhibition for Stanford.
The big fellow closed out the eve
ning's events with a third-round de
cision over Ray Stanley.
