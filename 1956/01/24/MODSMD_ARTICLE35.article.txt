# Frosh Cagers Rip Marin JC
## 
### 
The Stanford frosh brought an- ]
other scalp back to the Farm Satur
day night as Marin JC fell prey to
their tomahawks 59-62 at Kentfield,
Marin county.
Trailing by five points, 31-26, at
half time, the determined Indians
took over in the closing minutes of
play. With the score reading 50-52
in favor of Marin JC, guard Paul
Neumann suddenly went completely
wild and netted ten points in the
last nine minutes to lead the thrust.
The big push proved to be too
much for the faltering Marin five as
their high-point man, Ken Lesley,
who racked up 28 points, couldn't
maintain his pace.
The Indians appeared to have the
stronger and more co-ordinated at
tack of the two throughout the game,
but couldn't seem to get in gear until
Neumann led the way in the closing
minutes.
John Pfiueger and Doug Warren
each contributed ten points to the
Indian cause.
