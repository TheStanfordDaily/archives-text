# STERLING DONS TRAVELING SHOES
## Farm's Genial Chief Executive Spends Ten Weeks 'on the Road' During Year 
### JIM PALMER 
Stanford's distinguished "trav
eling salesman" will be on the
road again next month as Presi
dent Wallace Sterling takes off
for a whirlwind trip to the East
in late February.
The University's genial, 49-year
old chief executive dons his travel
ing shoes ten weeks of the academic
year and scoots off to a conglomera
tion of conferences, alumni meetings
and other functions throughout the
land.
"I try to combine as many events
as possible into two Eastern trips a
year," he explained as he leaned
back in a chair in the comfortable
office on Inner Quad, his home base.
For instance, he will leave for
points East in February and will
shuttle between New York, Chicago,
Washington and Battle Creek, Mich.,
for three weeks.
ACROSS NATION
Again, in the fall he will cross the
nation for the annual conference of
the Association of American Colleges
and Universities plus countless other
meets.
Besides "selling" Stanford by
building firm public relations, Dr.
Sterling says he has three main ob
jectives in his travels: meeting alum
ni demands, pursuing a "manhunt"
for faculty talent and furthering the
"dollar-hunt."
"Mrs. Sterling accompanies me in
the fall, but the pace of the spring
trip is too much for her," continued

the massively-'built former athlete
(he played football and basketball at
the University of Toronto).
TRAIN PREFERRED
"Even though it is necessary to
take the plane .sometimes, we prefer
the leisure of a train," he added,
drawing quickly on a filterized cig
arette.
Besides, if groups know you are
easily available at the snap of a pro
peller they are likely to expect your
appearance on very short notice,
reasons a man who has to turn down
numerous requests for speaking en
gagements daily.

"I .fashion my schedule around
definite fixed dates on the calendar,
such as board meetings.
"With six weeks a year in the East,
a couple of weeks in the Los An
geles area and another couple at
other alumni points in the West, I
spend about 10 weeks of the 34-week
year off-campus."
PUBLIC RELATIONS
Turning to the advances of the
University in public relations pro
grams in recent years, Dr. Sterling
pointed to the "great improvement
in the last five years" partly due to
such journeys as he makes every
year.
"On a trip in my first years as
President I decided to stop off in
Denver for an alumni dinner. A
gathering of 135 persons was present
and they took the opportunity to
rub in the fact that it was the first
time in 28 years that a Stanford
president had visited them."
But even though the University
reaps many rewards from its "trav
eling salesman," the busy president
still puts the emphasis on home base
operations.
"Perhaps you remember the old
saying," he concluded with a smile,
"that the best fertilizer for a farm is
the farmer's own footprints."
With so much of his time devoted
to traveling Sterling is often hard
pressed to find enough time to meet
his many social and administrative
commitments at Stanford. But some
how the complex machinery of the
University continues to function
smoothly under Sterling's guiding
but sometimes absent hand.

year off-campus."
PUBLIC RELATIONS
Turning to the advances of the
University in public relations pro
grams in recent years, Dr. Sterling
pointed to the "great improvement
in the last five years" partly due to
such journeys as he makes every
year.
"On a trip in my first years as
President I decided to stop off in
Denver for an alumni dinner. A
gathering of 135 persons was present
and they took the opportunity to
rub in the fact that it was the first
time in 28 years that a Stanford
president had visited them."
But even though the University
reaps many rewards from its "trav
eling salesman," the busy president
still puts the emphasis on home base
operations.
"Perhaps you remember the old
saying," he concluded with a smile,
"that the best fertilizer for a farm is
the farmer's own footprints."
With so much of his time devoted
to traveling Sterling is often hard
pressed to find enough time to meet
his many social and administrative
commitments at Stanford. But some
how the complex machinery of the
University continues to function
smoothly under Sterling's guiding
but sometimes absent hand.


PRESIDENT STERLING
Stanford's distinguished "trav
eling salesman" will be on the
road again next month as Presi
dent Wallace Sterling takes off
for a whirlwind trip to the East
in late February.
The University's genial, 49-year
old chief executive dons his travel
ing shoes ten weeks of the academic
year and scoots off to a conglomera
tion of conferences, alumni meetings
and other functions throughout the
land.
"I try to combine as many events
as possible into two Eastern trips a
year," he explained as he leaned
back in a chair in the comfortable
office on Inner Quad, his home base.
For instance, he will leave for
points East in February and will
shuttle between New York, Chicago,
Washington and Battle Creek, Mich.,
for three weeks.
ACROSS NATION
Again, in the fall he will cross the
nation for the annual conference of
the Association of American Colleges
and Universities plus countless other
meets.
Besides "selling" Stanford by
building firm public relations, Dr.
Sterling says he has three main ob
jectives in his travels: meeting alum
ni demands, pursuing a "manhunt"
for faculty talent and furthering the
"dollar-hunt."
"Mrs. Sterling accompanies me in
the fall, but the pace of the spring
trip is too much for her," continued

the massively-'built former athlete
(he played football and basketball at
the University of Toronto).
TRAIN PREFERRED
"Even though it is necessary to
take the plane .sometimes, we prefer
the leisure of a train," he added,
drawing quickly on a filterized cig
arette.
Besides, if groups know you are
easily available at the snap of a pro
peller they are likely to expect your
appearance on very short notice,
reasons a man who has to turn down
numerous requests for speaking en
gagements daily.

"I .fashion my schedule around
definite fixed dates on the calendar,
such as board meetings.
"With six weeks a year in the East,
a couple of weeks in the Los An
geles area and another couple at
other alumni points in the West, I
spend about 10 weeks of the 34-week
year off-campus."
