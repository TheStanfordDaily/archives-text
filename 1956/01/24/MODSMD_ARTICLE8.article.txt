# Council Denies Stanford Zone Change Appeal
## Halts Business Plans For Industrial Park 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Stanford's proposal to re-zone
its industrial park along the
planned Hanover Street exten
sion south of College Terrace
was defeated by an almost
unanimous vote last night by the
Palo Alto City Council.
Councilman J. P. Mitchell was the
Farm's only friend as the group took
its vote after figuhting a losing bat
tle with Robert's Rules of Order in
preceding business of the evening.
The council finally passed a move
ment that the planning commission
study the possibility of amending
present zoning regulations so that a
service station may be included
under the industrial park's present
"L-M:S" zoning.
ZONING CHANGE
The University had originally
asked that the zoning be changed to
"p_C" i n order to accommodate a
fire station, service station and bank.
The council failed to mention the
fire station, eliminated the bank
from consideration, and barely let
the service station slip by.
On the motion to ask the planning
commission about the bank, five
councilmen felt that it should be in
cluded. They are Mitchell, Dean R.
Cresap, Clifford Q. Giffin, Lee W.
Rodgers and C. H. Simpson.
Planning Officer Elton R. Andrews
explained the proposal to the council
saying that "L-M" areas were to be
limited to "employment-type" busi
nesses. He said "there is a need for
some services in such an area and a
service station is that type of serv
ice."
OBJECTION
Councilwoman Mildred S. Cor
coran objected: "It doesn't make any
difference where you get gas—at the
beginning, middle or end of a jour
ney."
She felt that the service station
would spoil the looks of the indus
trial park and dissented on "aes
thetic" rather than "economic"
grounds.
In other action, the council ac
cepted a University petition for the
annexation of 125.684 acres of Stan
ford land to the city. Mayor Noel E.
Porter set a public hearing on the
matter for Feb. 20.
The council denied a request of
the Library Committee, Parent
Group of the Stanford Elementary
School that a fee charged Stanford
school children for use of the Palo
Alto public library be abolished.

Councilman J. P. Mitchell was the
Farm's only friend as the group took
its vote after figuhting a losing bat
tle with Robert's Rules of Order in
preceding business of the evening.
The council finally passed a move
ment that the planning commission
study the possibility of amending
present zoning regulations so that a
service station may be included
under the industrial park's present
"L-M:S" zoning.
ZONING CHANGE
The University had originally
asked that the zoning be changed to
"p_C" i n order to accommodate a
fire station, service station and bank.
The council failed to mention the
fire station, eliminated the bank
from consideration, and barely let
the service station slip by.
On the motion to ask the planning
commission about the bank, five
councilmen felt that it should be in
cluded. They are Mitchell, Dean R.
Cresap, Clifford Q. Giffin, Lee W.
Rodgers and C. H. Simpson.
Planning Officer Elton R. Andrews
explained the proposal to the council
saying that "L-M" areas were to be
limited to "employment-type" busi
nesses. He said "there is a need for
some services in such an area and a
service station is that type of serv
ice."
OBJECTION
Councilwoman Mildred S. Cor
coran objected: "It doesn't make any
difference where you get gas—at the
beginning, middle or end of a jour
ney."
She felt that the service station
would spoil the looks of the indus
trial park and dissented on "aes
thetic" rather than "economic"
grounds.
In other action, the council ac
cepted a University petition for the
annexation of 125.684 acres of Stan
ford land to the city. Mayor Noel E.
Porter set a public hearing on the
matter for Feb. 20.
The council denied a request of
the Library Committee, Parent
Group of the Stanford Elementary
School that a fee charged Stanford
school children for use of the Palo
Alto public library be abolished.
