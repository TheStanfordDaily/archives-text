### 
WASHINGTON, lan. 23 (UP)
â€”President Eisenhower confer
red for an hour with Chairman
Walter F. George of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee to
day in an effort to halt an angry
foreign policy row with Con
gressional Democrats.
The conference also was attended
for 45 minutes by Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles, center of mount
ing Democratic attacks since the ap
pearance of the controversial ''brink
of war" article in Life magazine.
George declined to discuss his
meeting with the Administration of
ficials. He told reporters "anything
that was said about domestic or for
eign affairs you will have to get from
the President."
George described his visit as a
"courtesy call" on Mr. Eisenhower,
but the word was passed in advance
that the President is seriously con
cerned over the foreign policy row
and its effect on U. S. foreign affairs.
Mr. Eisenhower's concern was said
to be heightened by the fact that
British Prime Minister Anthony
Eden, who is having his own politi
cal troubles in Britain, arrives here

soon for top-level talks. Eden leaves
London tomorrow for this country.
Senator William F. Knowland (R-
Calif.) said Dulles did not advocate
that the United States go to the
brink of war "as a matter of exer
cise." He said Dulles declared that
the nation must be ready to take
"whatever risks are necessary to
prevent the Soviet from taking over
the world piecemeal."
Knowland previously had defend
ed Dulles when the secretary was
un der vigorous attack by Senate
Democrats.
He said Dulles' policy of trying to
avoid enemy miscalculations about
this country's intentions is a better
path to peace than "the Acheson
type of policy" on Korea.
