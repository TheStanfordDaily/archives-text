nolds as Gordon, Nancy Widdas as
Betty, and Flora Kirschner as Miss

"Priestley's play," Loper explains,
"is about the necessity of illusions.
Its people live on falsehood not be

there is no other way for them to
live at all."
Sets are by William Allison. New
to Stanford this year, Allison also
designed last quarter's "Nightmare
Abbey." Lights were designed by
Robert Brand and costumes by Irene
