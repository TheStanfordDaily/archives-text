# Dr. Bailey Tells Views On Teaching
## Says Teacher Is Custodian of Mind 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
"The longer you teach, the
more you realize thafr you are
the custodian of the most deli
cate instrument the world
knows, the human mind." Dr.
Margery Bailey made this the
basis of her "Testament of
Teaching" which she gave last
night.
Speaking to a Tuesday Series au
dience, Dr. Bailey stated that she
had fallen into teaching rather than
recognizing it as her vocation. She
said some people who believe they
are destined for the work are the
last to do well in it.
"The fact that I was attempting
something serious was borne home
to me by the sight of faces, not by
themes. Even veterans who had been
through all kinds of experiences
looked at me hopefully."
Dr. Bailey explained the art of
teaching by emphasizing she is not
there to teach facts alone, except In
beginning classes. She must show
the student why the fact is impor
tant.
EDUCATION COURSES
•She condoned the teaching of ed
ucation courses by stating that many
Ph.D.'s are not equipped to teach,
but said that no human, by teaching
method or psychology, could teach
someone how to teach.
To be a good teacher, a person
must first know if he has been well
taught. Among her masters Dr. Bai
ley named such men as Samuel
Seward, "a master of the Sot*ratic
question."
Henry David Gray taught her how
to lecture and also the need to al
ways talk slightly above the stu
dents' level. She characterized Wil
liam Ginsmore Briggs as "the most
brilliant of them all."
STRENGTH
Dr. Bailey stated a teacher must
have the strength of an ox. He must
also have the capacity to rest, since
teachers are not left alone to teach
now, but must also serve on com
mittees,
"You have to have an ironclad
nerve lo face the outer world and
the administration," she stated. The
first gives only ljp service to respect
ing a professor, while the latter is
continually crying for books, which
it is impossible to write while teach
ing.
"There is also a battle for su
premacy now among men whose
minds shouldn't be on such sub
jects. . . . One reason I'm glad to
retire is that the wave of politics is
rising."
POLITICS
Dr. Bailey said it is impossible for
a large university to avoid this. She
deplored the calling by first names
of all faculty members which var
nishes this scramble with good will.
Dr. Bailey criticized modern uni
versity life by saying that the un
dergraduate gets lecturing in which
there is little possibility of personal
contact with teachers.
"We're not. universities, but ex
tension high schools. The university
begins at the graduate level," she
later stated.
COMPLAINT
Another complaint was no student
can phrase what he thinks, because
high school and college tests give
him no practice in it. They can
judge questions but are unable to
express their judgments.
"Admitting all frailties there is
still the effort to do what you have
to do. I am teaching for the honor
of the millions of years gone into the
making of thus delicate instrument
and the people who preceded me in
making history. I would be denying
life to them if I backed out.
"I offer the Master thanksgiving
for stumbling into my vocation, and
for allowing me to learn and prac
tice it as well as I can."

someone how to teach.
To be a good teacher, a person
must first know if he has been well
taught. Among her masters Dr. Bai
ley named such men as Samuel
Seward, "a master of the Sot*ratic
question."
Henry David Gray taught her how
to lecture and also the need to al
ways talk slightly above the stu
dents' level. She characterized Wil
liam Ginsmore Briggs as "the most
brilliant of them all."
STRENGTH
Dr. Bailey stated a teacher must
have the strength of an ox. He must
also have the capacity to rest, since
teachers are not left alone to teach
now, but must also serve on com
mittees,
"You have to have an ironclad
nerve lo face the outer world and
the administration," she stated. The
first gives only ljp service to respect
ing a professor, while the latter is
continually crying for books, which
it is impossible to write while teach
ing.
"There is also a battle for su
premacy now among men whose
minds shouldn't be on such sub
jects. . . . One reason I'm glad to
retire is that the wave of politics is
rising."
POLITICS
Dr. Bailey said it is impossible for
a large university to avoid this. She
deplored the calling by first names
of all faculty members which var
nishes this scramble with good will.
Dr. Bailey criticized modern uni
versity life by saying that the un
dergraduate gets lecturing in which
there is little possibility of personal
contact with teachers.
"We're not. universities, but ex
tension high schools. The university
begins at the graduate level," she
later stated.
COMPLAINT
Another complaint was no student
can phrase what he thinks, because
high school and college tests give
him no practice in it. They can
judge questions but are unable to
express their judgments.
"Admitting all frailties there is
still the effort to do what you have
to do. I am teaching for the honor
of the millions of years gone into the
making of thus delicate instrument
and the people who preceded me in
making history. I would be denying
life to them if I backed out.
"I offer the Master thanksgiving
for stumbling into my vocation, and
for allowing me to learn and prac
tice it as well as I can."
"The longer you teach, the
more you realize thafr you are
the custodian of the most deli
cate instrument the world
knows, the human mind." Dr.
Margery Bailey made this the
basis of her "Testament of
Teaching" which she gave last
night.
Speaking to a Tuesday Series au
dience, Dr. Bailey stated that she
had fallen into teaching rather than
recognizing it as her vocation. She
said some people who believe they
are destined for the work are the
last to do well in it.
"The fact that I was attempting
something serious was borne home
to me by the sight of faces, not by
themes. Even veterans who had been
through all kinds of experiences
looked at me hopefully."
Dr. Bailey explained the art of
teaching by emphasizing she is not
there to teach facts alone, except In
beginning classes. She must show
the student why the fact is impor
tant.
EDUCATION COURSES
•She condoned the teaching of ed
ucation courses by stating that many
Ph.D.'s are not equipped to teach,
but said that no human, by teaching
method or psychology, could teach
someone how to teach.
