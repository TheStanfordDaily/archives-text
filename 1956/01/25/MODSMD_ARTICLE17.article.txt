Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler will match his weight
against a barrel of coins today for the benefit of the World Uni
versity Service "Aga Khan Project."
Winbigler will mount a chair balanced on one side of a spe
cially-constructed scale on Engineering Corner at 9:50 and 11:50
this morning and at 2 this afternoon.♦

When tile scale's pointer reaches
the balance mark, the coins students
contribute to the charity drive will
have equaled Winibigler's weight and
WUS will have reached its goal in
its intricate fund-raising program.
"We hope the barrels will be heavy
enough to lift the Dean off the
ground by the 2 p.m. weighing," sen
ior Drive representative Tony Hodge
said.
"Actually, it shouldn't be so hard
to do —especially if people change
their large coins to pennies. The
weight of coins can add up .surpris
ingly fast."
WUS will also sponsor a "KZSU
athon" tomorrow to raise money for
the relief project.
The campus radio station will
broadcast from noon until midnight.
Students may phone in recofd re
quests and messages to be broadcast
