Part of an editorial from the University of
British Columbia's weekly Übyssey appeared
here last week in our column devoted to hu
morous and interesting bits of news from other
campuses.
Today we present another editorial from The
Übyssey, for a far different reason:
"Kentucky's Carlsbad Caverns [sic! have
nothing on the pits existent on this campus. By
pits we are referring to the roadway that is
known as the East Mall which runs by the sta
dium and Brock Hall. One is reminded of the
London Blitz while gazing on that stretch of
road, and we use the term road advisedly.
"Before criticising the Administration for the
state of the East Mall it is only fair to first seek
out possible reasons for the pot-holes. One rea
son that has been suggested to us is that the
holes are there to accommodate the noted B.C.
author and fisherman Roderick Haig-Brown
when he comes to the campus to speak next
month. As soon as the holes become a little

larger they will be stocked with trout to make
Mr. Haig-Brown feel right at home.
"But back to the Administration. At least
five times a year repair crews are called to fix
the road. Fixing the road consists of throwing
two shovelfulls of hot tar into the holes. This
remedies the problem for at least three weeks
—then the holes are with us again.
"We would venture to say that if all the re
pair bills for the East Mall were added up, the
total would be close to what it would cost to
repave the road. In any event the road now
resembles the Oregon Trail and if there is no
intention of repaving it, it is time to call the
repair crews back in."
We wonder if you have noticed the stretches
of road in front of the BAC rind from Physics
Corner to the Chemistry Building since the
rains.
It looks like old Jupe Pluvius lobbed in a
couple of mortar rounds to add to the obstacle
course.
