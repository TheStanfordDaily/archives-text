Now that we are gathered over our breakfast
sustenance again, it is tune for another early
morning story. •
Once upon a time there was a small family,
living in a small rural town. In this family,
thoie were three children—a boy, a young boy,
and an even younger boy.
The oldest boy was diligent, hard-working,
and always one jump ahead of his brothers. He
was always informed about what was happen
ing on his family's farm, and also in the rest of
the v/orld. And he kept his family and his
friends well' informed daily.
The second boy was sickly and weak, but he
tc;o war. intelligent. He spent his days reading
and writing and learning about literature in
hopes that if he became strong he would be
come a literary giant like the older brother.
Unfortunately, this rural family had a third
son its youngest. This son was strong of back
but we.?k of mind. From his earliest days it
seemed that he was doomed to the life of the
common laborer, and common, he was. He was
always jealous of his older brothers.
For many, many years he struggled to better
his sad life. Finally, after a great deal of dili

gence, he became a day laborer 011 the local
railroad. Each morning he trudged three long
miles to the tracks, carrying in one hand a
lunch pail and in the other a hammer. All day
long ho pounded railroad spikes into railroad
ties to hold the tracks fast so that they would
remain true and firm.
Even at this task, though, the dullard was in
competent. And one day as the train drew near
and the workmen stepped aside to l'et it pass,
the track seemed to spring from the ties and
snap loose from the road bed, striking him to
the ground.
Before his friends could reach him, he was
dead, a victim of his own creation.
Because of the boy's dwindling significance,
his passing was barely noticed by others of
the community and few attended his ordinary
little funeral.
And when he was put to his final rest, all
that anyone could see was his hammer and his
coffin.
There is a moral to this story: It is better to
eat every day than to have but one meal a
month.
This is an old lcqcnd, noted lor its alle
gory, having lactual basis.
