# Austrian Foreign Scholar Praises SU Opportunities
## Ex-Hit-Run Victim Likes Farm Culture, Fraternities, Sports 
### GERRY SMITH 
Showing no visible signs of
injuries incurred in a hit-and
run accident fall guarter, ASSU
foreign scholar Hans Morawitz
had only praise for the reaction
of Stanford students to his mis
fortune.
"I never expected to have an acci
dent in a foreign country. When I
did, I- expected to spend a couple of
weeks alone in the hospital, just
sleeping.
"But so many people came to see
me or wrote a card—and cared. It
was a touching experience."
Turning to more pleasant topics,
Morawitz made many observations
and comparisons of his native Aus
tria and the United States, particu
larly regarding Stanford.
DIFFERENCE
The 20-year-old Austrian notices
much difference between European
and American undergraduate study
He thinks American college students
receive "too little knowledge in any
special field, but need to have a
broad college education because the
high school training is bad.
"This is a fault of the whole Amer
ican education, system. By 19 or 20
they should be specializing."
And he thinks that perhaps time
is wasted in the courses by unneces
sary questioning during lectures.
"Sometimes the. instructor gets out
of his course of thought. The stu
dents should wait and ask him after
class, like we do in Europe."
He also said that, in his opinion,
it is "a waste of intellectual poten
tial to have brilliant men teach un
dergraduate courses. They should
teach graduate students who are
hearer their own level of under T
standing."
SOCIAL ACTIVITY
Morawitz appreciates the opportu
nity for social activity at Stanford,
hut says: "There is too much pres
sure, in general, to be active. Lots of
people do things just because people
expect them to. I feel sorry for this
kind of people—l'm sui-e they could
find something they really enjoy
doing."
Another facet of Stanford life that
Morawitz particularly noted is the
cultural opportunity on campus.
"You bring the artist to the people.
At home you only go to such an
event when you really want to go,

for you have to stand in line for
hours. Here it is so easy."
He also had something to say
about the Sunday dicks. "It is some
thing so different and remote from
our ideas. It's almost fantastic — I
really enjoy it."
FRATERNITIES
Morawitz is very enthusiastic
about the fraternity system. "I had
no idea what it could be like. It is a
most positive experience living to
gether with almost no adult super
vision. It really proves young peo
ple are mature enough to know what
to do and what not to do.
On the subject of Stanford women,
he said: "I don't think Stanford
women are more mature than Euro
pean women. Their maturity is a dif
ferent type of maturity than that of
European women. They are more in
dependent but less serious in their
studies and haven't decided, what
they want to do.
"The men I've talked to are very
mature. The majority are interested
in some aspect of European living,
so you can always find something to
talk about. They are much easier to
associate with than Europeans."
HIGH SCHOOL
Morawitz attended high school in
Mattersburg, Austria, until he was
18. Since then he has completed two
years of study at the University of
Vienna, majoring in physics.
He will graduate from Stanford
next spring and wants to get a schol
arship for graduate study somewhere
in California. He plans to go into
the field of research physics.
At Vienna he was active in nearly
any sport from skin diving to skiing.
He's very enthusiastic about Stan
ford's sports facilities. "It's fantastic
how the coaches are. And it's all on
campus—you can get all the equip
ment you need, and everyone wants
to help you.

sleeping.
"But so many people came to see
me or wrote a card—and cared. It
was a touching experience."
Turning to more pleasant topics,
Morawitz made many observations
and comparisons of his native Aus
tria and the United States, particu

DIFFERENCE
The 20-year-old Austrian notices
much difference between European
and American undergraduate study
He thinks American college students
receive "too little knowledge in any
special field, but need to have a
broad college education because the
high school training is bad.
"This is a fault of the whole Amer
ican education, system. By 19 or 20
they should be specializing."
And he thinks that perhaps time
is wasted in the courses by unneces
sary questioning during lectures.
"Sometimes the. instructor gets out
of his course of thought. The stu
dents should wait and ask him after
class, like we do in Europe."
He also said that, in his opinion,
it is "a waste of intellectual poten
tial to have brilliant men teach un
dergraduate courses. They should
teach graduate students who are
hearer their own level of under T
standing."
SOCIAL ACTIVITY
Morawitz appreciates the opportu
nity for social activity at Stanford,
hut says: "There is too much pres
sure, in general, to be active. Lots of
people do things just because people
expect them to. I feel sorry for this
kind of people—l'm sui-e they could
find something they really enjoy
doing."
Another facet of Stanford life that
Morawitz particularly noted is the
cultural opportunity on campus.
"You bring the artist to the people.
At home you only go to such an
event when you really want to go,

for you have to stand in line for
hours. Here it is so easy."
He also had something to say
about the Sunday dicks. "It is some
thing so different and remote from
our ideas. It's almost fantastic — I
really enjoy it."
FRATERNITIES
Morawitz is very enthusiastic
about the fraternity system. "I had
no idea what it could be like. It is a
most positive experience living to
gether with almost no adult super
vision. It really proves young peo
ple are mature enough to know what
to do and what not to do.
On the subject of Stanford women,
he said: "I don't think Stanford
women are more mature than Euro
pean women. Their maturity is a dif
ferent type of maturity than that of
European women. They are more in
dependent but less serious in their
studies and haven't decided, what
they want to do.
"The men I've talked to are very
mature. The majority are interested
in some aspect of European living,
so you can always find something to
talk about. They are much easier to
associate with than Europeans."
HIGH SCHOOL
Morawitz attended high school in
Mattersburg, Austria, until he was
18. Since then he has completed two
years of study at the University of
Vienna, majoring in physics.
He will graduate from Stanford
next spring and wants to get a schol
arship for graduate study somewhere
in California. He plans to go into
the field of research physics.
At Vienna he was active in nearly
any sport from skin diving to skiing.
He's very enthusiastic about Stan
ford's sports facilities. "It's fantastic
how the coaches are. And it's all on
campus—you can get all the equip
ment you need, and everyone wants
to help you.
