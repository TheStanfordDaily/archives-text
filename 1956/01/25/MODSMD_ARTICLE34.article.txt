## BACKTALK 
### 
The football mess at the University of Washington is, apparently, still
as messy as ever. Last weekend four promising froth stars from Santa
Monica, headed by talented quarterback Lee Grosscup, dropped out of
school because they didn't wish to return to the gloomy grid atmosphere
at Washington.
The whole situation started last fall after the Huskies' last game, when
practically the entire Husky squad rebelled at the tactics of coach Johnny
Cherberg and asked the administration to let the tyrannical one go, either
voluntarily or involuntarily.
The students at Washington also got into the act by petitioning the
administration to get rid of Mr. Cherberg.
Cherberg said lie wouldn't leave, of his own accord anyway, and the
administrators were caught between the proverbial devil and the deep
blue sea.
They could fire Cherberg but for three reasons. One was that the
firing of Cherberg would uphold a mutiny, never a healthy maneuver for
a large university which must necessarily be public-relations conscious.
The second reason was that there is seeming strife at Washington over
who should have the say, the students or the administration, and that by
firing Cherberg the administrators would be losing control of a situation
to the demands of the students. This the administration did not want to do.
The third reason concerns Cherberg, himself. If he were fired ps the
result of such an uprising, his personal career would be set back consider
ably. This the administrators did not want to do.
On the other side of the fence, the administration could decide to
retain Cherberg and be faced with a terrible morale problem, both with
the players and the students. This latter course was chosen, and the results
are coming in.
The four Santa Monicans dropped out. Earlier Mike Monroe, a star
halfback on this year's Husky squad, transferred to Seattle University
because he "liked the smaller classes."
Adding spice to the situation was the recent announcement that Jim
Sutherland, backfield coach under Cherberg who was fired during the
height of the mutiny, has been signed to coach at arch-rival Washington
State.
it looks like it will be a long season at Washington next fall.
FOLLY OR PREDICTION?
The other day, Washington basketball coach Tippy Dye came out with
the prediction that UCLA will dump USF when the two meet at the
Western regional play-ofls at Corvailis.
It has been said that a good two-man team always whips a good one
man team. La Salle's Tom Go I a last year could not single-handedly beat
Duquesne's Diek Rickotts and Si Green, or USF's Bill Russell and K. C.
Jones.
If this is the case, and it seems a logical one, you can count on a five
man team (USF even without Jones) whipping a two-man team (UCLA
with Naulls and Taft).
The Bruins didn't even come close to scaring the Dons in the New York
Holiday Festival tournament over the Christmas vacation, and it hardly
seems possible that they will do much better on Russell and company come
next March.
INTERESTING ACTION
This week's PCC basketball action should be plenty interesting. Oregon
visits the Stanford Pavilion, and the score will probably soar. The Ducks
play a race-horse game with plenty of shooting, and the Indians are right
at home in these conditions.
Washington plays at Oregon State in a battle of ponderous'ball clubs.
Both can muster squads that average 6-4 or better. It should be a real
struggle under the boards.
Southern Cal goes to Idaho—and look for surprises. The Trojans will
be easily favored, but the Vandals are improving fast and tasted victory
for the first time in conference warfare last Saturday.
This week is this reporter's hist as sports editor of The Daily, and it
is often customary to bow out with a prediction—so Idaho over USC at
least once and probably twice.
