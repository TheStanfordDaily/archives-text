## Ley, Lindeman Lead Soto 3 To Triumph Over Madera 3 Winners' Deliberate Offensive Style Proves To Be Much for Madera Squad to Handle 
### JIM PRICE 
A polished, methodical Soto 3 quintet led by Bob Ley and Mike
Lindeman pounded out a 41-24 victory over Madera 3.
With Lindeman hitting four jump shots at the outset, the Soto
five poured to an 11-6 lead in the first five minutes. However, the
margin grew quickly when Ley, who scored 15 points, dunked
two quick lay-ins. Moving the ball*

around deliberately until they got a
shot, Soto maintained ball control
for almost five minutes at one
stretch.
During this time, Ley hit a jump
shot and Lindeman bucketed a
beautiful 30-foot set shot for the
ninth and tenth points of his 16-
point total. A moment later he rack
ed up two more on a short jumper.
MADERA RALLIES
Madera 3 finally got back into the
action aft e r this outburst when
guard Gary Logan sunk a 30-foot
set and then hit a jump shot before
a pair of teammates tallied on two
lay-ins to close the Soto margin to
six points. Logan paced the Madera
attack with a total eight points.
The second half soon became a
wide-open free-for-all as players of
both teams raced up and down the
floor trading lay-in attempts. The
only difference was that Soto was
sinking theirs while Madera was
missing mosit of theirs. Soto's strong
rebounding enabled them to reclaim
the ball after most of the unsuccess
ful Madera shots.
LEY HOT
Chief attacker in the second half
was center Bob Ley of the Soto five.
Within four minutes Ley had shoved
in three buckets and a free throw
to boost the Sot© lead to a safe 13-
point difference at 32-19.
After this point, Soto's methodical
attack lost all semblance of conserv
ativeness, and the substitutes of both
teams finished the contest in a wild
flurry of action, though there was
little scoring.
Mike Lindeman's first-half scoring
burst was one of the top perform
ances turned in during the first few
days of the current mural season.
While compiling 14 of his 16 points
in the initial half, Lindeman tanked
over half his shots, and those he
didn't make—almost without excep
tion—were near-misses.
Madera played as if they were
hypotized by their Soto opponents.
They just couldn't seem to do much
right, as they were missing shots and
unable to fathom the Soto offense
which they faced.
