# '56 Winter Olympics Hit by Lack of Snow
## United States Men's Ski Team to Don Crash Helmets for 'Race of Death' 
### 
CORTINA, Italy, Jan. 24 (UP)- Black-and-white crash helmets
were issued to the United States men's sld team tonight when lack
of snow pushed the pre-Olympic injury list to 27 and threatened
to turn the downhill competition at the winter games into what
one official called "a race of death."
Bud Washbond of East Hartford, Conn., and Sergeant Pat Biesia
decki of Ware, Mass., boosted U. S.,

hopes by placing second to Italy's
red-haired dare-devil Eugenio Mon
ti in the windup of the official two
man bobsled trials.
But the bobsled and ski jumping
practice—and even the rash of feuds
and complaints—were overshadowed
by the furor over the condition of
the ski runs with the games sched
uled to open Thursday.
"The Olympic downhill ski com
petition will be a race of death if it
doesn't snow soon," warned Maurice
Martel, manager of Jhe French ski
team.
Worried Italian Olympic officials
prayed for snow, but took action
when the weatherman said there was
none in sight. After a meeting be
hind closed doors with the sky jury,
they shifted the first ski event, Fri
day's giant slalom for women, from
an ice-coated, rock-dotted slide to
the Tofana course.
Maria-Grazia Marchelli, the Ital
ian women's downhill ski champion,
was today's most serious casualty.
The 24-year-oid Signora Marchelli,
fresh out of a plaster cast after suf
fering a bad fall last month, crashed
at 50 miles an hour on the two-mile
Tofana hill. She showered onlookers
with ice splinters and went back to
the ho.-.pital with a torn knee liga
ment.
