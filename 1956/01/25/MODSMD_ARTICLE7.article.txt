## Ike to Receive Personal Message from Bulganin 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP)â€”Soviet Ambassador Georgi N.
Zarubin today arranged an extraordinary meeting with President
Eisenhower tomorrow to deliver a personal message from Soviet
Premier Nikolai Bulganin.
The surprise request, unprecedented during the Eisenhower

administration, gave no hint of the
nature of the message.
There was immediate speculation
it might involve a new Soviet state
ment on the President's "open-sky"
military inspection plan, or even a
fresh Soviet effort to revive the fal
tering "Geneva spirit" of East-West
conciliation.
Bulganin recently suggested in
formally that another "summit" con
ference among Mr. Eisenhower, him
self and British and French leaders
might be useful to help restore the
conciliatory mood reached at last
July's "summit" meeting in Geneva,
Switzerland.
