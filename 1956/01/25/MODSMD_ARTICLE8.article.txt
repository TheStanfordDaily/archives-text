# Partisan Feuds Risky, Says Dulles
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles warned
feuding Democrats and Republicans
today that election-year wrangling
over foreign policy could greatly in
crease the risk of war.
Dulles, center of the current
"brink of war" furor, said partisan
rows will be highly dangerous if
they raise doubts about this nation's
determination to live up to its com
mitments. It was one of his most
urgent appeals to date for biparti
sanship.
