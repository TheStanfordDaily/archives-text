MOSCOW â€” Marshal Vasili Chui
kov, Soviet World War II hero, said
today that Russia has "surpassed"
the United States in the hydrogen
bomb field.
"Our successes in the development
of heavy industries enable the
equipment of our drmed forces with
the most accomplished weapons,"
Chuikov said.
(In Washington, U.S. atomic offi
cials called such Soviet claims of H
bomb superiority false. Atomic En
ergy Commissioner Thomas E. Mur
ray recently described such asser
tions as "Soviet propaganda.")
