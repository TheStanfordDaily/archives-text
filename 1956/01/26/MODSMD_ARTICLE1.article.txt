ABOUT Sis MiI.LION
Stanford plans to raise sufficient
funds to complete the $11 million
first stage of its medical school
building by the end of 1958. Con
struction of all the medical school
buildings will require another $4-$5
million.
Milton F. Johnson, Stanford's co
ordinator of planning for the project,
points out that the drawings of the
medical school portion of the project
are being carefully studied and ana
lyzed by numerous planning com
are still in a tentative stage. They
mittees, he said, and some changes
may result.
The medical building group will
be located some distance behind the
Stanford Museum and the Chemistry
Building, apart from the University's
main Quadrangle. The architect de
scribes the site as "ideally suited and
drained, with excellent natural
planting."
NEW ROADS
In addition to the campus' Willow
and Arboretum roads and Lomita
Drive, which now surround the area,
it will be served by new roads yet to :
be built.
As planned by Stone, an interna
tionally known hospital architect,
Palo Alto and Stanford would have
the first "garden hospital" ever built, i
Thomas Church of San Francisco has I
been working with the architect on j
landscape plans.
All buildings would center about a j
10-acre "square," facing the main
hospital and out - patient approach
from Willow Road. The school's main j
entrance would be on the opposite j
side facing the present University j
buildings.
