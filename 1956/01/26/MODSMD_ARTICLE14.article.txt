### 
OAKLAND, Jan. 25 (UP)—Bur
ton W. Abbott, 27-year-old Uni
versity of California stude it, to
day was found guilty and con
demned to death in the gas
chamber for the brutal abduc
tion and murder of Berkeley
teen-ager Stephanie Bryan.
A jury of seven men and five
women returned to the courtroom at
4:. r )0 p.m., after a full week, of de
liberation, to pronounce the.pale tu
bercular scholar guilty on both
counts —murder in the fir SO degree
and kidnaping.
They made no recommendation for
leniency — thus making the death
penalty mandtory.
Despite the overwhelming mass of
evidence against the skinny, stoop
shouldered scholar, however, Dis
trict Attorney Coakley was never
able to: (1) establish the actual
scene of the murder; (2) establish
the murder weapon, or (3) prove a
motive for the crime.
Reached at their Berkeley home,
Dr. and Mrs. Charles S. Bryan, par
ents of the slain 14-year-old girl
whose body was found behind Ab
bott's Trinity County cabin, said
they felt Abbott "got what he de
serves."
"We felt that he was guilty . . .
that he could be the only guilty
man" Dr. Bryan said.
Judge Snook set Feb. 3 for pro
nouncement of the death sentence.
Under California law, Abbott will
pet an automatic appeal to the State
Supreme Court.
