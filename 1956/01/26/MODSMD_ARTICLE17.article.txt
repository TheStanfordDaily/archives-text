### 
WASHINGTONâ€”President Eisen
hower said today he hopes not to
"dilly-dally too long" before decid
ing whether he still has "the "zip and
the zest,"' for another term in the
White House.
He made the comment at a news
conference at which he announced
that his next important medical
check-up probably will be sched
uled between Feb. 10 and Feb. 15.
Under persistent quizzing about
his second-term intentions, Mr. Ei
senhower said flatly that no member
of his family has any objection to
his seeking re-election.
But he also said that in looking
ahead for the next five years, "the
problem is what will be the effect on
the Presidency, not on me."
He said it is a question of whether
he will have the energy, the inten
sity, "the zip and the zest that you
can take into conferences when you
have to get something (lorn* for the
good of the United States."
