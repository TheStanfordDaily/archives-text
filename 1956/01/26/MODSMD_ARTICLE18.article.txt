# 'Fair' Quad Profit Split Voted Down
## 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
Tom Waterhouse's bid for a "fair
er" distribution ot last year's Quad
profits was turned down last night
in an ASSU Legislature meeting.
Approixmately $500 is involved.
Waterhouse, the yearbook's busi
ness manager last year, had asked
the body for a ruling Which would
set aside a bylaw saying that only
money taken in by the Quad staff
before Aug. 15 would be available
for profit split among top staff mem
bers.
Although he had sent. as many as
three bills to some advertisers, Wa
terhouse explained, payments had
not been received untU after the
August, deadline when Waterhouse
returned to school.
BYLAW
But, according to the bylaw, all
the money received after that date
is to go into the Quad improvement
fund.
The Aug. 15 deadline was an ex
perimental one, and when Water
house and oth e r Quad members
found it impracticable they asked
Legislature lo set it. aside and make
the profit split out of money received
up 1o Nov. 11, the regular auditing
date.
Most Legislature members felt
that since Waterhouse and his staff
had done the work they deserved
the full profit split, but when it came
to voting that split, the group as a
whole felt differently.
RULES OVER MORALS
One member expressed that feel
ing: "Although they morally deserve
the money, we made the rules and
we should stick to them."
And they did, voting down the
proposal which would have ignored
the bylaws and given the profit split
as of Nov. 11.
Later they suggested that the Pub
lications Board recommend a by
law for Legislature's consideration
which would give the profit split out
of the money which was put in the
Quad improvement fund (that col
lected after Aug. 15).
They will probably move on this
uggestion at the next. Legislature
meeting next Wednesday night.
