Next week the center ring of the Democrats'
three-ring circus will be featured in the Bay
Area when glib-tongued Adlai Stevenson puts
in an appearance.
Having been preceded by the Donkey
show's other two major attractions, straight
men Harriman and Kefauver, would-be Ele
phant-tamer Stevenson can be expected to de
liver the punch line to the whole affair.
We will hear a sparkling assortment of
phrases underneath which lie the same old
straw-grasping criticisms of the Republicans
and erring members of the Eisenhower team.
One wonders how long it will be necessary
to endure the cleverly-worded but ultimately
trivial statements of the Democrat "party line"
against Nixon, Dulles and other subjects that
the platfonn scientists enjoy focusing their
microscopes 011 in hopes of finding a contro
versial speck.
The campaign might ideally be fought not
on personality attacks or 011 the interpretation
—rightly or wrongly—ol an isolated phrase.
For other than generating political heat and
furnishing material for entertaining wise
cracks, this proves nothing.
Rather, the campaign v/ould place accom
plishments against the failures of the incum
bent Administration. The opposition might
enter a positive and constructive line of attack
based on the relevant facts.
If it is a winning campaign the Democrats
want, let them show how they would improve

on foreign policy, the farm problem, labor dil-
Jiculties and domestic economic policy.
Let the issues be clearly drawn.
But this type of a campaign will, unfortu
nately, not be staged this election year. The
outline has already been sketched by the op
position; the show is already on the road.
And, casting aside their own popular piov
erb, the Democrats apparently are fearing
something besides fear itself.
They seem to fear Ihe accomplishments of
the Eisenhower Administration through their
own inability lo adequately meet them head
on. They cover up with inicioscopic observa
tions and clever phrases.
They fear to tread on the ground of positive
campaigning, it appears, since they have failed
to construct, thus far, arguments outside the
negative sphere as relate to problems in lor
eign and domestic fields.
They fear Ihe GOP record of a balanced
budget, peaceful prosperity, advances in the
social welfare and common defense so much
that they dare not meet it honestly and
squarely.
And thus next week we will hear Mr. Steven
son's nice-sounding voice and be amused by
his truly sparkling wit. In the months to come
v/e will hear Kefauver, Harriman and others
on the platform.
They will be clever, perhaps convincingly
so to some. But it will be only part of the show.
We had best sit back and enjoy the circus.

Area when glib-tongued Adlai Stevenson puts
in an appearance.
Having been preceded by the Donkey
show's other two major attractions, straight
men Harriman and Kefauver, would-be Ele
phant-tamer Stevenson can be expected to de
liver the punch line to the whole affair.
We will hear a sparkling assortment of
phrases underneath which lie the same old
straw-grasping criticisms of the Republicans
and erring members of the Eisenhower team.
One wonders how long it will be necessary
to endure the cleverly-worded but ultimately
trivial statements of the Democrat "party line"
against Nixon, Dulles and other subjects that
the platfonn scientists enjoy focusing their
microscopes 011 in hopes of finding a contro
versial speck.
The campaign might ideally be fought not
on personality attacks or 011 the interpretation
—rightly or wrongly—ol an isolated phrase.
For other than generating political heat and
furnishing material for entertaining wise
cracks, this proves nothing.
Rather, the campaign v/ould place accom
plishments against the failures of the incum
bent Administration. The opposition might
enter a positive and constructive line of attack
based on the relevant facts.
If it is a winning campaign the Democrats
want, let them show how they would improve

on foreign policy, the farm problem, labor dil-
Jiculties and domestic economic policy.
Let the issues be clearly drawn.
But this type of a campaign will, unfortu
nately, not be staged this election year. The
outline has already been sketched by the op
position; the show is already on the road.
And, casting aside their own popular piov
erb, the Democrats apparently are fearing
something besides fear itself.
They seem to fear Ihe accomplishments of
the Eisenhower Administration through their
own inability lo adequately meet them head
on. They cover up with inicioscopic observa
tions and clever phrases.
They fear to tread on the ground of positive
campaigning, it appears, since they have failed
to construct, thus far, arguments outside the
negative sphere as relate to problems in lor
eign and domestic fields.
They fear Ihe GOP record of a balanced
budget, peaceful prosperity, advances in the
social welfare and common defense so much
that they dare not meet it honestly and
squarely.
And thus next week we will hear Mr. Steven
son's nice-sounding voice and be amused by
his truly sparkling wit. In the months to come
v/e will hear Kefauver, Harriman and others
on the platform.
They will be clever, perhaps convincingly
so to some. But it will be only part of the show.
We had best sit back and enjoy the circus.
Next week the center ring of the Democrats'
three-ring circus will be featured in the Bay
Area when glib-tongued Adlai Stevenson puts
