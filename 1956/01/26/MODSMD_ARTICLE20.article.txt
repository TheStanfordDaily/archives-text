it annoyed me
To the Editor:
Having read with interest the so - aptly - titled
"Feeble Fable" ("Fable of the Feeble"—Ed.| in yes
terday's Daily, I find it necessary, as a Hammer & Cof
fin man and Chaparral start: member, to make a few
remarks on the subject.
I Rather from the subtle allegory that you rejoice
in the glory of publishing five days a week while we
of the slick-page faction are t.o be seen but Once a
month, it is true that this gives the Daily staff an
advantage of about a 24 to 1 "dumping" market. (I
believe that "dumping" in commerce refers to the
practice of unloading generally unsaleable articles
onto the general market at whatever price that can be
obtained.)
Be that as it may, I am reminded of recent occur
rences in the television world where certain perform
ers find that their talent (?) is unappreciated because
it is before the public eye too often. Far be it from
me to draw a parallel, but . . . ?
Another thought that occurs to me is that a lot
of people will read something that they do not have
to pay for, simply to have something to do. Fortu
nately, a large amount of people will pay to read
something they enjoy, and even send it to others to
enjoy. Which class does The Daily fall into (I seem
to recall pleas to SEND THE DAILY HOME)?
|The Business Manager reports that The Daily
mails about 950 paid subscriptions per day.—Ed.|
Actually, 1 enjoy Mr. Cilley's articles very much,
especially since he is one of my best friends. Far from
being annoyed at his Sunday afternoon efforts, I
appreciate them as an effort to create some interest
in campus events and in The Daily.
However, thr Daily editorial staff, apparently
striving to ruse to new heights after their noble efforts
to impede our ASSU president, grow grass on Inner
Quad, vote Democrat in the elections [See "The Na
tional Scene" abouve—Ed. I, criticize all entertainment
in the area and magnify all unimportant occurrences
into major ones a la Communication and Persuasion
211 (which is "an analysis of the experimental litera
ture that relates to credibility, susceptibility, reten
tion of opinion change and other aspects of the effect
of communication"), decided to make a furor about
reaction to some of Earl's remarks. This was typical,
bul annoyed me because we of the Hammer & Coffin
could not answer in like fashion for another publica
tion month.
It is necessary to remember that newspaper edi
tors u e small issues to prop up failing interest in
theii. product. I am sure everyone knows what hap
pens when an over-used prop is removed . . .
Yours for a bandaged nose for the editorial staff,

about the hymn
To the Editor:
After the first basketball game of this season
(Stanford vs. Washington, Dec. 2). the Stanford bas
ketball band started to play the Stanford Hymn as
has been customary for the band as long as we have
been here. After about one-third of the way through
the Hymn, the band stopped playing because we no
ticed only a few Stanford students remained in the
stands to sing it.
Following this, we talked to one of the persons

connected with the radio broadcast who told us that
the Hymn had been radioed to Washington as well
as around the Bay Area, and it sounded rather weird
to hear it end so abruptly.
We told him that if Stanford students do not want
to sing or hear their Hymn, we would not play it for
them. Since that game and for the first time in many
years, the Stanford Hymn has been absent from the
end of the basketball games.
Beginning tomorrow night, the Stanford basketball
band will once again play the Stanford Hymn after
the game and will continue to do so for the remainder
of the season. Furthermore, this Saturday afternoon
the Stanford-Oregon game will be on television, and
audiences from Seattle to San Diego will view the
game. We hope the Stanford student body will sing
the Hymn after the game.
We trust Stanford's lack of interest after the
Washington game was not indicative of the students'
feeling toward the Hymn.

courtesy in civ
To the Editor:
Many of us feel (we discussed it in our corridor
meeting this week) that, as freshmen we are an active
component in the problem of Civ lectures. The lec
tures have lost a great deal of their value, due greatly
to the general attitude of the freshman class.
We realize'that there are two sides to this prob
lem and have taken the matter to the faculty through
our representative to the Student-Faculty Commis
sion. Our own conduct, however, Ls the only issue
upon which we as students can directly improve.
In our corridor itself there were numerous oppo
site reactions to each lecture, proving that no
speaker can simultaneously please 1200 Civ students.
Respect for adults and a sense of common courtesy,
however, should occur continually at, each lecture.
If a student is not interested in the week's topic, he
can do something constructive, even sleep, that is not
wasting his own or others' time. But he should re
main quiet without being deliberately distracting.
Wo do not wish to board the soap-box, but we do
feel the, ultimate solution is through all of us as a
class. Do you not as fellow students feel as we that
we could make the lectures more beneficial by pre
senting the lecturer a more attentive, responsive au
dience?

complete omission
To the Editor: 112
I was disappointed to find the complete omission
of any comment concerning the audience reaction in
The Daily's article on Dr. Margery Bailey's talk |in
the Tuesday Evening Series|. Admitting the difficulty
of reporting such a talk, I feel that the tribute paid
by the student and guests of their absolute attention
and their standing ovation should have been included
in the article.
Such tributes are not common and I am certain
you agree that our student press should report stit
dent appreciation, especially when it is so clearly
shown.
