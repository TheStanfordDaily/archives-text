# Varsity Double Bill Shows Only Wide Screen, Color

Pavlov called attention to the concept of the conditioned reflex
which may explain my response, a kind of deep-souled twitch,
when a movie turns out to be on a wide screen and in Technicolor.
"The Treasure of Pancho Villa" reinforced this reaction by an
unsettling display of flying boulders, counter-revolutionary Mex-

ican soldiers and tight-lipped ami-*
gos.
It is prabaibly kinder to turn
quickly to the second picture at the
Varsity, "I Died a Thousand Times."
(These titles were not selected by
satirists.) ,
This picture is advertised as "the
story behind the terrifying 60-day
hunt for mad-dog Earle." Deep un

Palance, who plays
the part, turns out
not to be a mad
dog at. all but just
a 'fellow who
wants to meet a
I decent kind of girl

and never had the opportunity dur
ing his heist jobs. By chance, a de
cent kind of girl shows up, and,
though Earle uses some of his loot
to fix up the girl's club-foot, she
turns him down about a third of the
way through the script.
So Earle turns to Shelley Winters,
who is also decent way, way down—
but not too decent along the way.
In an earlier movie, "A Place in
the Sun," Shelley Winters had a
pained, earnest expression she uesd
effectively. But then she was a preg

nant. woman trying to get married;
here she is just a woman trying to
get pregnant, and somehow I could
not take that sad expression too
seriously.
There is also a dog in the picture.
His name is Paid and, according to
a Mexican servant who ought to
know, Pard has got the "evil-eye,"
bringing bad luck to his owner.
After the love matters are
straightened out the picture settles
down to an old-fashioned cop-and
robber chase in which the police
trap Earle on a mountain.
Shelley Winters learns this and
comes along, with Pard to help her
man out. But Pard scampers out of
the basket, past the police lines and
up, with his evil eye, toward his
master, Earle.
Earle sees Pard, jumps out of
hiding to greet him and is immedi
ately bumped of! by a waiting
deputy.
The picture is on a wide screen
and in Technicolor.

turns him down about a third of the
way through the script.
So Earle turns to Shelley Winters,
who is also decent way, way down—
but not too decent along the way.
In an earlier movie, "A Place in
the Sun," Shelley Winters had a

effectively. But then she was a preg

here she is just a woman trying to
get pregnant, and somehow I could
not take that sad expression too
seriously.
There is also a dog in the picture.
His name is Paid and, according to
a Mexican servant who ought to
know, Pard has got the "evil-eye,"
bringing bad luck to his owner.
After the love matters are
straightened out the picture settles
down to an old-fashioned cop-and
robber chase in which the police
trap Earle on a mountain.
Shelley Winters learns this and
comes along, with Pard to help her
man out. But Pard scampers out of
the basket, past the police lines and
up, with his evil eye, toward his
master, Earle.
Earle sees Pard, jumps out of
hiding to greet him and is immedi

deputy.
The picture is on a wide screen
and in Technicolor.

Pavlov called attention to the concept of the conditioned reflex
which may explain my response, a kind of deep-souled twitch,
when a movie turns out to be on a wide screen and in Technicolor.
"The Treasure of Pancho Villa" reinforced this reaction by an
unsettling display of flying boulders, counter-revolutionary Mex-

ican soldiers and tight-lipped ami-*
gos.
It is prabaibly kinder to turn
quickly to the second picture at the
Varsity, "I Died a Thousand Times."
(These titles were not selected by
satirists.) ,
This picture is advertised as "the
story behind the terrifying 60-day
hunt for mad-dog Earle." Deep un

der n e a th, Jack
Palance, who plays
the part, turns out
not to be a mad
dog at. all but just
a 'fellow who
wants to meet a
I decent kind of girl

and never had the opportunity dur
ing his heist jobs. By chance, a de
cent kind of girl shows up, and,
though Earle uses some of his loot
to fix up the girl's club-foot, she
turns him down about a third of the
way through the script.
