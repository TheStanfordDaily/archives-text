lie followed his heart and found his world

u v
Xou've heard it said that there's more oppor
tunity in America than in any other country:'
"It's true. But it's hard to realize how true
unless you come here from abroad. As I did,
from ScotJand.
"Now I cherish my homeland. But as in so
many of the older countries, your life is pretty
well laid out for you at birth. '1 lie odds are
you'll follow this path whether you want to
or not.
"Well, I didn't like what-my future seemed

to be in Scotland, so I quit my job and fol
lowed the girl I had fallen in love with to
California. I got a job with Union Oil as a
clerk in the Field department, and we were
married shortly after.
"When 1 started with the company in 1925
we seldom drilled a well deeper than 4,000
feet. Today it's not uncommon to go down
12,000 feet, liven drill under water!

"Better tools have made this possible. And
created new opportunities. I'm now an Admin
istrator in the Field department. 1

s "But the important point is—every one of
these 30 years I've been doing what 1 wanted
to do. Our children have enjoyed the same
privilege. Our boy's a graduate engineer, now
on active duty as an Ensign in the U.S. Naval
Reserve. Our daughter is a college tcachcr.
1 "That, I think, is the miracle of America:
the chance it gives you to be what you want
to be. And to live happier because of it."

Anderson is]far too modest. 1 lis own hard work
is obviously the lirst reason for his success.
