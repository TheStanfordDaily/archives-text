# Dangerous Corner' Is 'Thoroughly Entertaining'
## 
### RICHARD MENDE 
Certain dilettantes affecting a taste for les formes precieuses de
l'art would do well to take advantage of the presentation of "Dan
gerous Corner" to expose themselves to substantial dramatic pro
duction.
Mr. Priestley's play itself is unpretentious melodrama and good

solid theater. With a shrewd hand
he delineates the criminal potential
of ordinary people and, in a swirl
of deceptions, theft, intrigue and
pathological disorder, creates an at
mosphere of criminality, soul-satis
fying to the my.-:terv lover and thor
oughly entertaining to the average
theater-goer.
The acting, like the play, was com
petent and unassuming. Talented ap
prentices—not amateurs —the actors
went about their work with consid
erable craft'maivship.
There is no real hero in the play,
and the whole cast subordinated
their individual roles to the collec
tive task.
But it would be ungrateful not to
I single out Astrid Willsrud for spe
cial thanks for the scene in whicfy
she accounts for the death of Mar
tain. And Don Soule had just the

"Dangerous Corner" will con
tinue its run in the Little Theatre
of Memorial Auditorium tonight
through Saturday and Wednesday
through Saturday next week. Cur
tain time is 8:15 p.m.

right blend of Puritanical correct
ness and Teutonic thoroughness to
motivate the search for the "whole
truth" which exposed so many nasty
secrets.
And Margaret Stewart was a
pleasingly cosmopolitan Freda, and
Eugene Carlson exactly caught the
feeling of the firm partner "without
the right university and social back
ground."
Others in the cast, all good, were
Flora Kirschner, a spinster; Nancy
Widdas, involved in two extramarital
considerations, yet touchingly ego
centric; and Kelly Reynolds, an ef
feminate husband.
Craftsmanship and taste were to
be found, too, in William Allison's
set which helped establish the mood
for mystery.
The only negatives noted about
the evening are more in the nature
of petty quibbles. Mr. Priestley's
overly-obvious warnings about the
danger of knowing all the truth
might, have been deleted.
And it was a little difficult, at first,
to figure out who the Characters
were, who was married to wihom.
It was interesting that the villain,
perhaps the most forceful character,
could be so vividly created without
making an appearance on stage.
lit was interesting, too, that, al
though Mr. Priestley's approach to
the theater reflects the training of a
novelist rather than a playwright,
his techniques were able to create a
sense of the dramatic without, using
dramatic action, in fhe strict sense
of the term.

SEARCHING FOR TRUTH is Robert, played by Don Smile, in the Stan
ford Players production of "Dangerous Corner," which opened last night
in the Little Theater. Soule (Robert) talks with Margaret Stewart, left,
and Astrid Willsrud. who play Freda and Owlen, respectively. Robert in
his obsessive quest for the truth about his life almost destroys himself
in the melodrama written by J. B. Priestley. The play will run two weeks.
