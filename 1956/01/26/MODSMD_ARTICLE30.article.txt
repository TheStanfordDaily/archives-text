# Haynie Predicts Success For Colorful Card Mermen
## Mentor Hopes for National Championship, Has Outstanding Relay Team Ready to Go 
### JOHN WEISER 
Stanford's winningest team mentor yesterday predicted that
the varsity swim team this year should be "the most spectacular
ever." Out in the swimming pool office the weather picture looked
grim with gusty winds and driving rain, but Tom Haynie was
the picture of optimistic confidence as he related the highlights

of the coming swim season.
Although the team might be ham
pered slightly by the loss of such
veteran greats as Larry Heim and
Dan 0.-, borne, neither of whom was
ever defeated in conference compe
tition, by and large, this year's crop
of natatory will be the best ever.
COLORFUL PERSONALITIES
What is sure to be grandstand ma
terial, according to Haynie, is the
wide array of personality and tem
perament on this year's squad.
"They're characters," chortled
coach Tom. "I'm going to have trou
ble keeping them in line when the
competition starts getting tough.
"For example, take our great
sprinting prospect, Robin Moore,
who is just a sophomore this year.
Last season he made a date with a
girl while swimming the 440-yard
freestyle. Yes, he won the race by
two lengths of the pool."
Also in the sprints is tanky Chuck
Clemans, who, upon receiving the
worst of a close decision l y judges,
has been known to beat the lane
lines with his fists.
"THEY'RE HOT, MAN"
Getting down to business, Coach
Haynie began describing the high
points of this year's mermen. "They
are hot, man, when it comes to the
relay events, and that's where the
points are."

Pausing for breath, Haynie con
tinued: "Last year we did fairly well
individually, but when it came to
the relays we fell off. This year our
four - man rel ay team of Robin
Moore, Doug Ackerman, Carver Nix
on and Chuck Clemans has an ex
cellent chance to win the national
title."
The balding mentor went on to
say that, individually, these men
have come very close to national
marks at 50 and 75 yards.
"When they get in shape, and we
let them go 100 yards apiece, watch
out, Yale!," Yale, incidentally, was
written up in this week's Sports Il
lustrated as being the top team in
the nation.
FULL SEASON AHEAD
Starting nexit month with San Jose
State, the/ Indian frogs wild then
meet the national junior college
champs, Fullerton, here at Stanford.
After this contest it's back to Yale
for the national championships.
Due to an off schedule, it is only
after the nationals, wihich are held
during spring vacation, that the team
meets PCC competition. Spectators,
however, will have ample opportu
nity to watch them in action, as most
meets are at home, including the
PCC championships.
The excellent prospects ( this year

have not come without preparation.
Coach Haynie initiated a full year
round training program this fall in
order to whip the team into full
strength by this March.
Commencing with road work and
running, the pace grew more strin
gent until the whole squad was driv
en for a solid two hours per day.
"It's paid off," breezed Haynie;
"there isn't a swimmer on the team
who isn't going faster than last year,
and we haven't even started yet."
At present the team is devoted ex
clusively to the water element,
swimming nearly two miles per man
each day.
SWIMMERS TOPS
Of all the organized teams, swim
ming is the only sport at Stanford
to continue without a loss for five
straight years. Since his inception as
head swimming coach in 1947, Hay
nie has run up eight PCC champion
ships, the last five consecutively, and
has nearly 50 straight dual wins, a
record to be envied by any coach in
any sport.
With such a fine record behind
them, plus colorful personalities and
excellent talent, the team this year
should put on a show of which the
spectators can be proud.

Also in the sprints is tanky Chuck
Clemans, who, upon receiving the
worst of a close decision l y judges,
has been known to beat the lane
lines with his fists.
"THEY'RE HOT, MAN"
Getting down to business, Coach
Haynie began describing the high
points of this year's mermen. "They
are hot, man, when it comes to the
relay events, and that's where the
points are."

Pausing for breath, Haynie con
tinued: "Last year we did fairly well
individually, but when it came to
the relays we fell off. This year our
four - man rel ay team of Robin
Moore, Doug Ackerman, Carver Nix
on and Chuck Clemans has an ex
cellent chance to win the national
title."
The balding mentor went on to
say that, individually, these men
have come very close to national
marks at 50 and 75 yards.
"When they get in shape, and we
let them go 100 yards apiece, watch
out, Yale!," Yale, incidentally, was
written up in this week's Sports Il
lustrated as being the top team in
the nation.
FULL SEASON AHEAD
Starting nexit month with San Jose
State, the/ Indian frogs wild then
meet the national junior college
champs, Fullerton, here at Stanford.
After this contest it's back to Yale
for the national championships.
Due to an off schedule, it is only
after the nationals, wihich are held
during spring vacation, that the team
meets PCC competition. Spectators,
however, will have ample opportu
nity to watch them in action, as most
meets are at home, including the
PCC championships.
The excellent prospects ( this year

have not come without preparation.
Coach Haynie initiated a full year
round training program this fall in
order to whip the team into full
strength by this March.
Commencing with road work and
running, the pace grew more strin
gent until the whole squad was driv
en for a solid two hours per day.
"It's paid off," breezed Haynie;
"there isn't a swimmer on the team
who isn't going faster than last year,
and we haven't even started yet."
At present the team is devoted ex
clusively to the water element,
swimming nearly two miles per man
each day.
SWIMMERS TOPS
Of all the organized teams, swim
ming is the only sport at Stanford
to continue without a loss for five
straight years. Since his inception as
head swimming coach in 1947, Hay
nie has run up eight PCC champion
ships, the last five consecutively, and
has nearly 50 straight dual wins, a
record to be envied by any coach in
any sport.
With such a fine record behind
them, plus colorful personalities and
excellent talent, the team this year
should put on a show of which the
spectators can be proud.


George Wyne
TEAM CAPTAIN CARVER NIXON prepares to start from touch by
sprint-ace Robin Moore. Checking the reaction time is swim-mentor for
the Cards, Tom Haynie. Stanford's relay team appears to he one of the
best in the nation and hopes to capture the national championship at Yale.
Stanford's winningest team mentor yesterday predicted that
the varsity swim team this year should be "the most spectacular
ever." Out in the swimming pool office the weather picture looked
grim with gusty winds and driving rain, but Tom Haynie was
the picture of optimistic confidence as he related the highlights

of the coming swim season.
Although the team might be ham
pered slightly by the loss of such
veteran greats as Larry Heim and
Dan 0.-, borne, neither of whom was
ever defeated in conference compe
tition, by and large, this year's crop
of natatory will be the best ever.
COLORFUL PERSONALITIES
What is sure to be grandstand ma
terial, according to Haynie, is the
wide array of personality and tem
perament on this year's squad.
"They're characters," chortled
coach Tom. "I'm going to have trou
ble keeping them in line when the
competition starts getting tough.
"For example, take our great
sprinting prospect, Robin Moore,
who is just a sophomore this year.
Last season he made a date with a
girl while swimming the 440-yard
freestyle. Yes, he won the race by
two lengths of the pool."

meet the national junior college
champs, Fullerton, here at Stanford.
After this contest it's back to Yale
for the national championships.
Due to an off schedule, it is only
after the nationals, wihich are held
during spring vacation, that the team
meets PCC competition. Spectators,
however, will have ample opportu
nity to watch them in action, as most
meets are at home, including the
PCC championships.
The excellent prospects ( this year

have not come without preparation.
Coach Haynie initiated a full year
round training program this fall in
order to whip the team into full
strength by this March.
Commencing with road work and
running, the pace grew more strin
gent until the whole squad was driv
en for a solid two hours per day.
"It's paid off," breezed Haynie;
"there isn't a swimmer on the team
who isn't going faster than last year,
and we haven't even started yet."
At present the team is devoted ex
clusively to the water element,
swimming nearly two miles per man
each day.
SWIMMERS TOPS
Of all the organized teams, swim
ming is the only sport at Stanford
to continue without a loss for five
straight years. Since his inception as
head swimming coach in 1947, Hay
nie has run up eight PCC champion
ships, the last five consecutively, and
has nearly 50 straight dual wins, a
record to be envied by any coach in
any sport.
With such a fine record behind
them, plus colorful personalities and
excellent talent, the team this year
should put on a show of which the
spectators can be proud.
