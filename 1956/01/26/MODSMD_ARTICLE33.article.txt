# Squaw Valley Told to Produce Or 1960 Games Will Be Shifted
## 
### 
CORTINA, Italy, Jan. 25 (UP) —The International Olympic Com
mittee warned tonight that the 1960 Winter Olympic Games will
be transferred to Innsbruck, Austria, if Squaw Valley, California,
officials fail to guarantee the necessary finances by April 3.
Avery Brundage, American president of the lOC, said that in-

ternational committee members were
"impressed"• by the California dele
gation's blueprint for staging the
snow and ice classic four years
hence.
However, under pressure from the
Austrian delegation, which seeks to
shift the 1960 games to Innsbruck,
the lOC issued its ultimatum to
Squaw Valley oflicials.
The California group expressed
confidence that its state legislature
will approve a $4,000,000 appropria
tion next March. That sum, added to
the $1,000,000 already approved, will
insure the seventh Winter Olympic
classic for the Sierra Nevada resort,
Squaw Valley officials believe.
"If the Squaw Valley arrange
ments are not satisfactory, the 1960
Winter Games will be given to Inns
bruck, Austria, the alternative sug
gested by the lOC at its meeting in
Paris last year," said Brundage at a
press conference following the two
day meeting of the lOC.
Alex Cushing, deputy leader of

the Squaw Valley delegation, said he
hoped the California legislature
would not react unfavorably because
of the lOC's ultimatum.
"We told the lOC this morning
that the California state legislature
would be voting the money in
March," Cushing said. "And I expect
they'll do just that. The only reser
vation is—you never know how the
legislature will react to an ultima
tum."
Although Austrian officials had
scofTed that Squaw Valley was "not
fit" to stage the 1960 games success
fully, lOC members emerged from
today's three-(hour closed-door ses
sion with glowing reports of the
California group's preparations thus
far.
