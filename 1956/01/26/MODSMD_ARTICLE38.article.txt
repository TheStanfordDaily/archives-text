## Abernathy Hopes To Form Unicycle Club or Polo Team 
### STAN GROSS 
Is anyone interested in help
ing Bill Abernathy start a uni
cycle club, or a unicycle polo
team? Abernathy, who wants to
know, is The man often seen
pedaling his unicycle near en
gineering corner.
Six years ago while Abernathy
was watching a unicycle act on tele
vision, he developed a great desire
to ride one.
An uncle gave him one, and it
took him about three hours to learn
to ride it in a straight line. After
that it was similar to learning to
ride a bicycle.
Abernathy brought the vehicle
from his home in San Gabriel to
Stanford v/hen he started as a fresh
man last quarter. He states emphati
cally that wherever it is possible to
ride the unicycle, he wouldn't be
without it.
He doesn't mean to be unique,
necessarily, or to show it off. To 18-
year-old Abernathy it is just easier
to pedal wherever he than to
walk.
"And for speed in getting to my
early morning Western Civ section
on time," he says,"the unicycle is
indispensable!" He can travel up to
10 miles an hour on it.
The longest ride be took on this
'cycle was a 10-mile ride around a
block. He was practicing to be in a
band in the Rose Parade in 1953 and
was going to play the sousaphone
while riding (his unicycle.
Abernathy has already performed
on his unicycle in three shows. His
routine demonstrated the process of
learning to ride a unicycle. His
training in tumbling helped him in
falling while depicting the beginner.
Several people have asked Aber
nathy if he has a tall unicycle. He
has. says it is easier to ride than
the one he uses at Stanford. The
main reason he likes the tall one

better is that he has more time to
prepare for the drop when falling
off.
Unicvcles sell for about $75 retail.
Besides the one he rides on campus,
Abernathy has one he wants to sell
for $20. It has a 26-in. balloon tire

with ball bearings.
As for starting a unicyole club or i
polo team, ail he needs are members j
for either project. But people who
ride unicycles are hard to find
around Stanford.

Abernathy brought the vehicle
from his home in San Gabriel to
Stanford v/hen he started as a fresh
man last quarter. He states emphati
cally that wherever it is possible to
ride the unicycle, he wouldn't be
without it.
He doesn't mean to be unique,
necessarily, or to show it off. To 18-
year-old Abernathy it is just easier
to pedal wherever he than to
walk.
"And for speed in getting to my
early morning Western Civ section
on time," he says,"the unicycle is
indispensable!" He can travel up to
10 miles an hour on it.
The longest ride be took on this
'cycle was a 10-mile ride around a
block. He was practicing to be in a
band in the Rose Parade in 1953 and
was going to play the sousaphone
while riding (his unicycle.
Abernathy has already performed
on his unicycle in three shows. His
routine demonstrated the process of
learning to ride a unicycle. His
training in tumbling helped him in
falling while depicting the beginner.
Several people have asked Aber
nathy if he has a tall unicycle. He
has. says it is easier to ride than
the one he uses at Stanford. The
main reason he likes the tall one

better is that he has more time to
prepare for the drop when falling
off.
Unicvcles sell for about $75 retail.
Besides the one he rides on campus,
Abernathy has one he wants to sell
for $20. It has a 26-in. balloon tire
