# Med Construction May Begin in '56
## 
### 
Dr. Windsor Cutting, dean of
the Stanford Medical School,
yesterday declared that he was
"delighted" with the Board of
Trustee's approval of tentative
plans for the future Medical
School on Stanford campus.
He .'■aid, "Cliancps are good that
both the Palo Alio Hospital and part
0.l the Medical School will be .Mai led
before the end of the year."
Accordiivy to Kenneth Cuthbei t
.'on, a- i.'.lanl lo the p.evident, the
Univer ity's lirsf goal on construc
tion v. iij be to build Millicient Medi
cal School (buildings so that Medical
School students will ibe able to spend
their lirst two years on the Stanford
campus. At present they leave for
San Francis o after four quarters,
i iusr stage
Stanford expects to spend $11 mil
lion on this first stage of its Medical
School building program by the end
of l!). r )8. Cuthbertson said that some
of the money, donated for specific
buildings, is already available.
A drive for funds for the Medical
School will be held later this year.
Dean Cutting said, "The University
plans to get funds from individual
gilts, foundations, the Government

j and from anywhere we can get it."
Stanford is also committed in ad
vance to help pay part of the cost of
the Palo Alto - Stanford Hospital as
i it is being constructed. The Palo
j Alto Hospital will be mainly financed
I by a $4 million bond issue recently
passed by Palo Alto citizens. Coti-
I struction of all the Medical School
I buildings will require another $4 to
j $5 million.
Hi HIND MUSEUM
The Medical School building group
will be located ibehind the Stanford
Museum and the Chemistry Build
ing. The 'buildings will lace on Wil
low Kun Koad, alleviating any cam
pus trailic that might result from the
hospital.
The plans of architect Edward D.
Stone call for a "garden hospital."
There will be a series ot open, low
buildings with plenty of landscaping
rather than the traditional skyscrap
er hospital. It i.s emphasized by Mil
ton P. Johnson, Stanford's coordina
tor of planning lor the project, that
the. plans are still in the tentative
stage.
According to Dean Cut ting, the
Medic-id School move from San
Francisco to Stanford is mostly aca
demic.
He explained: "Medicine is be

coming almost unbelievably com
plex. Experts in chemistry, physics
and biology are not easily attracted
to the Medical School in San Fran
cisco because they are isolated from
their colleagues. |The laboratories of
anatomy, biochemistry, medical mi
crobiology and physiology are out of

roach on the Stanford campus.l
"Only within the University itself
can Stanford supply the men and th«*
atmosphere required. Also to the
early art of medicine is added social
science of medicine. At the Univer
sity there are experts in the prob
lems of society with whom coopera
tion could be mutually profitable.'
IJBKAKV PLANNED
To bring about Cutting':, announc
ed of academic cooperation, a
general science library costing $2
million will lie one ot tin 1 first Medi-
Sehool buildings constructed. The li
brary will contain all the Univer
sity's volumes on medicine, chemis
try, biulogv- and physic...
V'l len completed the entire hospi
tal - med school plant will include a
teaching hospital of 500 beds, Medical
School buildings and clinics, a sci
ence laboratory and dormitories and
graduate housing. The teaching hos
pital will have 200 - 250 beds for
Stanford list-, llie other half being
used by the City of Palo Alto.
President. David Starr Jordan ob
tained the med school plant for Stan
lord in 1908. Since then the Univer
sity has operated the now antiquated
lAiildings located at Clay, Sacramen
to and Webstetr Streets, in San Fran
cisco.
