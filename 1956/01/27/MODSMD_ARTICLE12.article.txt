# LASSU Asks Traffic Control, Clearer Campus Road Markings
## 
### 
Continuing their efforts to unsnarl University traffic, the ASSU
Legislature Wednesday moved to send a resolution to the admin
istration calling lor direct police traffic control at noon and for
clearer markings on campus roads.
The resolution, suggested by Bob Maddock's traffic committee,
asks that a traffic patrolman be sta-*

tioned at the Post Office intersection
and possibly at other points during
the noon rush each day.
The other points where the com
mittee has decided patrolmen are
needed are at Physics • Corner, in
back of Encina and at the corner of
Santa Teresa and Lomita Streets.
The recommendation also called
for adequate marking on all center
lanes and in parking areas to indi
cate spaces. Maddock said the fact
that paint wears off in three months
here is no reason why adequate
marking should not be provided.
He cited the practice of usintf the
raised center of Palm Drive as a
poor substitute for a center-lane
marking.
Since the campus police depart
ment. has only 10 men on the force,
Maddock noted it will be hard to
provide adequate control as speci
fied in the Legislature request. Dur
ing the period when the protection
is called for, he noted that only I wo
patrolmen are on duty.
The group also discussed possi
bility of using the oval parking area
off Quad exclusively for off-campus
and Village resident students.
Further recommendations were
put off until next week's meeting.
Other business discussed:
• Introduction of Roberta Clark
and Robert Norman, new represent
atives from the graduate humanities
and sciences division.
• Approval of the new Daily Edi
torial Board.
• Agreement to pay half the cost
of repairing the PA system in the
Village's Remele Mall.
• Exemption of the Stanford crew
from paving accounting costs on

their deposit in the ASSU offices.
• Continued NSA discussion con
sidering admission procedures.
• Constitutions of the Business
Cluib, the American Field Service
Committee and the Walter Army So
ciety approved.
• Establishing a committee to read
club meeting minutes for Legislature
approval.
• Appi'oval of putting a Cheer
Leader amendment on the next
