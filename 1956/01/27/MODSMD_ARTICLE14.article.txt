# Worst Rain in 20 Years Lashes Southern Cal; Hundreds Forced to Flee
## 7-Inch Downpour in 24 Hours Brings Floods, Business Standstill 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26 (UP) —The worst storm in more than 20
years lashed Southern California today, bringing seven inches of
rain in a little more than 24 hours and resulting in floods that
forced more than 700 persons to evacuate their homes.
As dark came, almost all activities except of an emergency na-

ture came to a virtual halt. Facto-♦
ries, businesses and stores .shut down !
early in order to permit employes to !
get home before dark because of J
flooded streets and roads.
Although the heavy rains since |
early Wednesday morning left streets [
deep in water in Los Angeles, Uie
storm caused the most damage and
discomfort in outlying areas in all j
directions.
The run-off concentrated in the j
south and west sections of the coun- |
ty, however. In the Long Beach area j
more than 150 civilians and soldiers i
were sandbagging an unimproved!
section of the Los Angeles river Hood i
control channel where the water was
held in check by the Wardlow levee.
Residents were informed of the
possibility their homes might be
' Hooded if the levee failed to hold
when water crept io within a foot of
i the top. But the peak was reduced
j by closing flood gates of a dam far
back in the county, thus curtailing
the flow.
Col. Arthur J. Frye Jr. of the
Army Corps of Engineers termed the
situation critical for the present.
FLOOD DAMAGES
Damages from the flood were vari
j ously estimated at from $500,000 lo
more than $1,000,000 to the homes of
j individuals, although County Man
i ager Arthur J. Will said damage to
flood control projects and streets
probably would 'be nominal.
The Los Angeles County Civil De
| fense Administration manned its dis
aster headquarters in the Civic Cen
ter, and similar centers were placed
in operation at outlying police and
sheriff's stations.
The Red Cross said its disaster
! stations were caring for about 500
i persons who temporarily evacuated
their homes, either because they
I were flooded or because they feared
j rising waters might enter the dwell
j ings during the night.
HIGHWAYS CLOSED
Numerous major highways were,
shut down by flooding and slides.
Among the main traffic arteries
. blocked was the Santa Ana Freeway,
which leads to Orange county com
munities.
The rainfall passed seven inches
for the storm shortly after 3 p.m. to
make it the heaviest precipitation in
a 24-hour period since 1934, when
a disastrous New Year's Day cloud
burst dumped 7.3G inches in a like
period.
Tomorrow's weather prediction for
the area calls for moderately scat
tered showers.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26 (UP) —The worst storm in more than 20
years lashed Southern California today, bringing seven inches of
rain in a little more than 24 hours and resulting in floods that
forced more than 700 persons to evacuate their homes.
As dark came, almost all activities except of an emergency na-

ture came to a virtual halt. Facto-♦
ries, businesses and stores .shut down !
early in order to permit employes to !
get home before dark because of J
flooded streets and roads.
Although the heavy rains since |
early Wednesday morning left streets [
deep in water in Los Angeles, Uie
storm caused the most damage and
discomfort in outlying areas in all j
directions.
The run-off concentrated in the j
south and west sections of the coun- |
ty, however. In the Long Beach area j
more than 150 civilians and soldiers i
were sandbagging an unimproved!
section of the Los Angeles river Hood i
control channel where the water was
held in check by the Wardlow levee.
Residents were informed of the
possibility their homes might be
' Hooded if the levee failed to hold
when water crept io within a foot of
i the top. But the peak was reduced
j by closing flood gates of a dam far
back in the county, thus curtailing
the flow.
Col. Arthur J. Frye Jr. of the
Army Corps of Engineers termed the
situation critical for the present.
FLOOD DAMAGES
Damages from the flood were vari
j ously estimated at from $500,000 lo
more than $1,000,000 to the homes of
j individuals, although County Man
i ager Arthur J. Will said damage to
flood control projects and streets
probably would 'be nominal.
