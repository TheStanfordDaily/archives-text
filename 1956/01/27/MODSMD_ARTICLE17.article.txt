# a 						new coachâ€”maybe
## 
### 
All indications are that Payton Jordan, now
head track coach at Occidental, will replace the
already-resigned Jack Weiershauser after the
up-coming season.
The announcement should come out ol the
Stanford Athletic Board meeting this afternoon.
Salary seems to be the only obstacle, if it is
one.
Somehow, we wonder why Payton Jordan is
leaving his track factory at Oxy, which rates
only behind SC and UCLA. Oxy is obviously
able to lure more trackmen than Stanford. Eco
nomic inducements are greater, and despite
Jordan's claim that entrance reguirements are
identical, scholastic qualifications are lower.
Additionally, Jordan has created a climate at
Occidental that will be difficult, if not practi

cally impossible, to reproduce at Stanioid.
Oxy trackmen are expected to eat, live, sleep,
die track, and nothing else.
I'or those reasons we wondei why about all
the rumors; we wonder why Jordan should
give up such a good job.
But we hope, none the less, that Payton Jor
dan will be Stanford's new track coach. He is
one of the finest developers of trackmen in the
country. His record is outstanding. He instills
a spirit, a desire in his trackmen that is hard
lor opponents to beat.
Payton Jordan is one man who can lead Stan
ford back to the top in the woild of track and
prevent USC and UCLA from lapping the field.
If we get him.
And we should know today.
