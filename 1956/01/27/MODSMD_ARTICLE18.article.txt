Do you think that there arc adequate facili
ties for studying on the campus aftei 10 p.m.?
All the campus' studying facilities such as
the Main. Library, Western Civ Library and
Cubberley Library are closed at 10 p.m. every
night. In an effort lo discover whether or not
there ape' autticient places for studying after
these c|pse„ and. to determine student opinion
on the mat,lpr, The Daily interviewed students
around trio Quad.
Most of the students interviewed agreed that
the facilities were not adequate after the li
braries close. Some suggested that these fa
cilities be kept open to iater hours.
Those who said that the study places weie
adequate pointed out that students could study
in their rooms or in the lounges of their living
units. But most students who do not study in
their rooms before 10 p.m. agree that they
won't be able to do so after that hour.
Another suggestion to alleviate the problem
was to have classrooms on Quad available as
study rooms after the libraries close.
Here are some of the comments of those in
terviewed:
Susanne Soltysrk, '58, Laqunita: "There ate
definitely no adequate places to study after 10
p.m. For kids who want to study, they should
leave a place open in central Quad—say, Room
214. It wouldn't be expensive because the Uni
versity wouldn't have to pay employees, as in
the Libe."
Lynn Mitchell, '66', Jordan: "Definitely not;
it's almost impossible to study in houses some
times because of all the noise, and I think that
there should be some place that is open until
midnight. Perhaps a study room could be built
into the new student Union when it js put up.
It should have comfortable chairs, with some
tables and a small library."
Blair Anderson, '59, Branner: "I think there
should be other places to study, but I don't
think it's necessary to keep the Library open
after 10 p.m."

lun Hutst, (/iriHurilr, oil campus: "My obser
vation is that there are sufficient facilities foT
study now on campus. As regards to studying
after If) p.m., 1 feel that the living areas are
quiet enough for studying by that time."
C.'aro/ //arris, '.'>B, Ventura: "I don't think that
the present facilities are adequate. I think the
upstairs room o( the Main Library should re
main open until 1.0:30, as is the Reserve Book
Room IRBR closes ai If) hid. I. I'think that espe
cially du'ing finals niid rnidteims they should
specified places to study."
Carl Bloi/i, '59, Wilhui: "At times you wish
you could study aftft If) in the Library, but it
would really inconvenience the librarian. Any
way, you can always study after 10 in the
lounges."
Nancy Otto, '58, Laguiula: "The Libe hours
ate just fine for the girls, because their lockout
is at 10:30, and this way they get back just in
time. It does seem,, though, that you just get
started studying and you have to stop. 1 think
it would ideal if dorms could stay open until
11. That would be perfect."
lean Burch, '58, Lagunita: "I don't think there
ato adequate places to study after 10 o'clock.
The dorms are too noisy and my roommate
likes to sleep, so I c.an't study in my room. I
don't think the whole Library needs to be kept
open, but they should leave some classrooms
m History Corner or other patts of the Quad
open until I 30."
John Chwq, '57, Slew: "The RBR is too dis
tracting a place to study in, so 1 don't spend
much time there. All other study places are
not convenient to students, because they are
not situated in the Quad area. Some people
like to study all night before an exam; there
just isn't any reasonably convenient or quiet
place for these people to study, especially if
they want a fair degree of privacy."

on the mat,lpr, The Daily interviewed students

Most of the students interviewed agreed that
the facilities were not adequate after the li

Those who said that the study places weie

it's almost impossible to study in houses some
