ends and means
To the Editor:
Wednesday, near Engineet ins Corner, old Karl
Marx's doctrine that the end justifies the means was
given s.pectacular confirmation by the students and a
member of the faculty of Stanford University. The
end was WUS. The means? Well, let's see if they
were s s noble and worth while as the end.
In order to raise donations from students, some
one deemed if necessary to arrange a "gimmick." The
attraction of the "gimmick" was that students should
gather round to gape and stare at the Honorable H.
Donald Winbigler suspended in a chair, in all his
dignity, amidst slogans such as "Let's get the Dean
high," or "ITow much is the Dean worth?" while a
sweaty-faced little man in a mink coat and a sequin
hat should proclaim this to be "one of the most spec
tacular things in Stanford University history . .
And it. surely was as i student threw a penny at
Dean Winbiglei (to the bitter disappointment of the
thrower, the Dean didn't r un out and pick it up).
I suppose that those who arranged this show
thought to establish Dean Winbigler as the hear) of
a crusade. If this was the intention, then it didn't
work out that way. U seemed to me, as I looked
around at the smiling faces in the crowd, that the stu
dents pre -«*nt. weren't thinking in terms of crusades
for WUS, or of martyrs in its cause, but simply think -
ing of how ridiculous the antics of the Honorable II
Donald Winbiglei were. Who wouldn't be moved to
pay a few cents t f > witness such a spectacle?
Perhaps the placing of equal emphasis on means
and ends seems iithcr immature and even medieval
to some But we should not forget that this emphasis
on both means and ends i. one of the bases of our

democracy as opposed to tyranny. A man is just as
dear) whether he be hanged under a democratic proc
ess 01 a tyrannical process The thing that is differ
ent is the manner in which he arrives at being hanged.
Because of this, I think it. would be foolish for us,
living in a democracy, to forget the importance of the
manner in which something is carried out.
These periodic shows Wednesday were a thor
oughly disgusting way in which to raise funds fot -
WUS. However, many, including Dean Winbigler,
will maintain that tin light exploiting of the Dean's
dignity was merely a little harmless frivolity for a
good cause.
To those, may I humbly suggest that the next
time some worthwhile project comes up, we throw
lemon meringue pies, at a nickel a throw, in Dr.
Wallace Sterling's fare Then we would have much
(jigger and better harmless frivolities for good causes.

ends and means
To the Editor:
Wednesday, near Engineet ins Corner, old Karl
Marx's doctrine that the end justifies the means was
given s.pectacular confirmation by the students and a
member of the faculty of Stanford University. The
end was WUS. The means? Well, let's see if they
were s s noble and worth while as the end.
In order to raise donations from students, some
one deemed if necessary to arrange a "gimmick." The
attraction of the "gimmick" was that students should
gather round to gape and stare at the Honorable H.
Donald Winbigler suspended in a chair, in all his
dignity, amidst slogans such as "Let's get the Dean
high," or "ITow much is the Dean worth?" while a
sweaty-faced little man in a mink coat and a sequin
hat should proclaim this to be "one of the most spec
tacular things in Stanford University history . .
And it. surely was as i student threw a penny at
Dean Winbiglei (to the bitter disappointment of the
thrower, the Dean didn't r un out and pick it up).
I suppose that those who arranged this show
thought to establish Dean Winbigler as the hear) of
a crusade. If this was the intention, then it didn't
work out that way. U seemed to me, as I looked
around at the smiling faces in the crowd, that the stu
dents pre -«*nt. weren't thinking in terms of crusades
for WUS, or of martyrs in its cause, but simply think -
