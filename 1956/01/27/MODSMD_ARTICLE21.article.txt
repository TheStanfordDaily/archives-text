## Active Organization Achieved Influence After World War 
### WALL SIMPSON 
The foremost problem facing Italy
today is Communism, according to
Vice Consul France co RipHiidelli of
tihe Italian Consulate in San Fran
cisco.
Speaking yesterday at Bowman
Alumni House in the third of the
present series of consular talks spon
sored by the Institute of Internation
al Relations, Ripandclli stressed that
the concept of Communism to Ital
ians differs from the concept, of Com
munism to the United State ;
Elaborating on that point, the
Vice-Consul pointed out that Ameri
cans conceive of Communism as a
foreign element and ideology. This is
not so in Italy, where Communism
has the longest, following outside of
the Iron Curtain.
After the Italian armistice in I94!!
the country was occupied hy Ger
many. The Cominuni: t party monop
olized all resistance against the Ger
mans and was the only political or
ganization that had any clear ideas,
strong internal discipline and mon
etary funds.
That, said Rip.-.mdelli, is why the
Communist party was able to force
the other parties to compromise with
it in the making of government pol
icy. The Communists took over com
pletely the purge of fascist and
used this tool to increase their fol
lowing.
The Communr I ideology i an im

xntant aspect to consider in the
talian problem, Ripandclli said. To
nost of the poor and unemployed
md, indeed, to many of the infeJlec
,uals -Communism is a faith, a myth
,o which the people cling in a ro
naiiitic, trusting way.
The results of land reforms have
;cen disappointing, said Ripandclli.
father than taking away .some of
lie votes from the Communiats, the
•e:-nlt,s have in many cases increased
he number of Communist votes
riiis, according to Ripandolii, is be
•arise of the traditional .sii .picion of
be people towards government.
