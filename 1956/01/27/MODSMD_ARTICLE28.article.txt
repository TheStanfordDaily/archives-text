# Pasadena Report: Jordan Resigns To Take Over Indian Track Job
## 
### 
Payton Jordan, Occidental College track coach, has resigned effective
August 31 to take a similar job with Stanford University, the Pasadena
Star-News disclosed yesterday. Jordan, who has built the Tigers into a
track powerhouse, will replace Jack Weiershauser at the helm of the Indian
spikers.
Stanford's athletic department still has not made an official announce
ment of Jordan's appointment. The University's athletic board of control
meets this afternoon and is expected to make the announcement. The only
previous disagreement between Jordan and Stanford was over salary terms.
Weiershauser is retiring from the Farm's track post to enter private
business. The burly mentor, a former sprint great at Stanford, has bossed the
Card spikers since the sport, was taken up following World War 11. Olympic
decathlon champion Bob Mathias was one of Weiershauser"s outstanding
athletes whom he coached here.
The announcement that Jordan was finishing out this season at Oxy
wiped out any doubt that he would replace Weiershauser. Jordan has
coached such outstanding athletes as NCAA 880 champion John Barnes and
middle-distance great Bob McMillen.
Jordan has coached Oxy to two successive track victories over Stanford
in the last two years. The new Tribe chief was an outstanding sprinter at
USC in his' undergraduate days.
