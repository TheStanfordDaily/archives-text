# Papooses Face Pair of Tests
## 
### 
Stanford's Frosh basketballers go
in search of their H.fth and sixtli vic
tories over the weekend as they
tackle two local junior colleges in
contests that will start at 5:45 p.m.
Friday and Saturday evenings.
Friday night's opponent will be
the highly rated Modesto Junior Col
lege quintet, sporting the leading
scorer in the lpcal Big Eight Con
ference. Moving in to the Pavilion
Saturday evening is Oakland Junior
College.
The local five could easily escape
victorious, for they have rapidly de
veloped into a smooth-working out
fit that has lost only one game in six
encounters. The lone loss was to St.
Ignatius High School. Last weekend
Coach Dick Clegg's quintet handily
defeated Marin College.
Deadeye guard Paul Neumann has
paced the local scoring attack
throughout the opening games of the
season. Other standouts are Captain
John Pfiueger and Dick Haga.
