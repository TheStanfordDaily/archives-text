wrestlers take on the strong Cal Poly
matmen tonight at 7:30 in Encina
Gym.
The Cards, who have defeated San
Francisco State, Cal and Santa Clara
in their only outings this year, will
be badly crippled for the match to
night due to the loss of 157-pounder
Ray Miller.
Miller was forced to drop the mat
spoi*t because of the pressure of his
studies. Coach Ruff declared that the
absence of MiLler will be "a great
loss to the team."

Carmody, who has been competing

pound match.

pounds; Alan Laubscher, 167 pounds;

about the invaders, but he figures
that they will be strong because of
tihe great wrestling interest at Cal
Poly. According to Ruff, "we may
be facing our first loss of the year."
The match promises to be a ding
dong battle.
