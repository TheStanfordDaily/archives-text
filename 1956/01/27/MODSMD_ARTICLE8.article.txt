# Heritage Fund Continued By Class of '56
## 
### 
The second year of a young
Stanford tradition began this
week when Ihe class of '56
established its Heritage Fund
Committee.
The Heritage Fund is a scholarship
fund donated by business men in the
Stanford area. Solicitations are a
project of the senior class, which
leaves the amount collected as its
gitft to Stanford.
Last year the class of '55 collected
$7810 from 14 contributors. This
amount provided 10 full year schol
arships to undergraduates.
CYCLE OF HELP
James Triolo, adviser to the com
mittee, has described the scholarship
project as "a continuous cycle of help
from one class to the next â€”hence
the title 'Heritage'."
At the opening meeting of the '50
Heritage Committee, members ex
amined a list of prospective contrib
utors to determine who their con
tacts should be. They will canvass
during the week of Feb. 0 to 10.
Prospective contributors are chos
en on the basis of volume of busi
ness, dependence on Stanford trade
and interest in the University.
The fund was established last year
to provide scholarships based on
leadership, Triolo said, a need which
has been largely unfilled in previous
years when scholarships were pri
marily athletic or academic.
TRADITION
Last year's senior class felt that
the class gift should be more valua
ble to future Stanford students than
the traditional drinking fqjftntains,
Triolo said.
The amount collected showed that
the idea could be successful, so the
class of '50 has decided to continue it
as a Stanford tradition.
President Sterling will send letters
to the prospective contributors, ex
plaining the program to them pre
vious to the visits made by members
of the committee.
Recipients of last year's scholar
ships have visited their respective
contributors lo thank them and ex
plain how they have been aided by
the program.
