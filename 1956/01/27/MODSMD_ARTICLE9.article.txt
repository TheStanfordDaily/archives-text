Coach Bill Borcher of the Ducks
has a strong, experienced pair of
guards to set up his offense. Jerry
Ross is a senior who has lettered
twice, and Phil McHugh is a letter

Both Ross and McHugh, along with
Anderson, started on last year's sec
ond-place Webfoot team. Ross, who

snaring end on the Duck gridiron
team, stands 6-1.
LOSCUTOFF GONE

graduation last year came when
Northern Division scoring champ
Jim Loscutoff left the campus. Fill
ing the All-PCC forward's shoes has
been Coach Borcher's chief concern.
Howard Page, Loscutoff's running
mate, also graduated last June. Page
gained All-PCC honorable mention
ranking.
Attempting to replace these two
ace forwards are Charlie Franklin
and Ray Bell.
Franklin is a sharp-shooting .soph
omore who transferred from one of
out/hern California's numerous jun
ior colleges. The slender forward
stands 6-3.
IMG REBOUNDER

Page during the last two seasons.
The only other lctterman on the
Oregon team is 6-2 forward Ed Bing
ham, a junior.

pulled the finale out of the fire in
Moscow last weekend to break even.
LOST TO UTAH
In pre-season encounters the Web
foots dropped a single game to Colo
rado and lost both ends of a series
against Brigham Young. The Cou
gars also hold wins over PCC leader
UCLA.
Northwestern, on a western trip
with Big Ten partner Michigan, was
whipped by the Ducks. The follow
ing night, however, the Wolverines
gained revenge with a solid victory.
While Oregon will be trying to
improve its .500 percentage, Stanford
will be attempting to skip past
Washington and USC to challenge
the Bruins for first place. The Cards
at present hold down a four-victory
and two-loss record in conference
play.
CARD STARTERS
Coach Howie Dallmar has been
shaking up his lineup during the
season because of injuries. Against
Oregon State last week Dallmar went

open, Brown would see action at
forward.

twice this year, both times in con
ference competition. Washington

Both Ross and McHugh, along with
Anderson, started on last year's sec
ond-place Webfoot team. Ross, who
stands 6-2, hails from Portland. Mc-
Hugh, who doubles up as a pass
snaring end on the Duck gridiron
team, stands 6-1.
LOSCUTOFF GONE
Oregon's biggest loss through
graduation last year came when
Northern Division scoring champ
Jim Loscutoff left the campus. Fill
ing the All-PCC forward's shoes has
been Coach Borcher's chief concern.
Howard Page, Loscutoff's running
mate, also graduated last June. Page
gained All-PCC honorable mention
ranking.
Attempting to replace these two
ace forwards are Charlie Franklin
and Ray Bell.
Franklin is a sharp-shooting .soph
omore who transferred from one of
out/hern California's numerous jun
ior colleges. The slender forward
stands 6-3.
IMG REBOUNDER
8011, a husky 6-5, provides added
rebounding strength for the Web
foots. The big forward is a senior
who substituted for Loscutoff and
Page during the last two seasons.
The only other lctterman on the
Oregon team is 6-2 forward Ed Bing
ham, a junior.
The Ducks hold a two-victory and
two-loss record in conference play
this year. California split a series in
Eugene two weeks ago, and Idaho
pulled the finale out of the fire in
Moscow last weekend to break even.
LOST TO UTAH
In pre-season encounters the Web
foots dropped a single game to Colo
rado and lost both ends of a series
against Brigham Young. The Cou
gars also hold wins over PCC leader
UCLA.
Northwestern, on a western trip
with Big Ten partner Michigan, was
whipped by the Ducks. The follow
ing night, however, the Wolverines
gained revenge with a solid victory.
While Oregon will be trying to
improve its .500 percentage, Stanford
will be attempting to skip past
Washington and USC to challenge
the Bruins for first place. The Cards
at present hold down a four-victory
and two-loss record in conference
play.
CARD STARTERS
Coach Howie Dallmar has been
shaking up his lineup during the
season because of injuries. Against
Oregon State last week Dallmar went
with Captain George Selleck and
sophomore Gary Van Galder at the
guard positions, Barry Brown at
center, and Bill Bond and Bill Flan
ders at forward.
Also possible starters and expected
to see plenty of duty are guard Hap
Wagner and centers Carlos Bea and
Carl Isaacs. Should Bea or Isaacs
open, Brown would see action at
forward.
The Tribe has been defeated only
twice this year, both times in con
ference competition. Washington
scored an easy upset in the PCC cur
tain-raiser in Seattle. Oregon State
