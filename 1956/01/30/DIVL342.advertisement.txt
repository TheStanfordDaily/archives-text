A frank message to /
graduating electronic and mechanical /
ENGINEERS -
You know it . we know it ... so let's be frank
about it. /
The demand for engineers—experienced or graduate
—far exceeds the supply/And, from now on in, you
are going to be sought after more than a triple threat
halfback for next year's varsity.
You will be promised many things (including the
moon with a fence/ground it), and for a young man
just getting started these things are pretty hard
to resist. /
So, again, let,'s be frank. We at Farnsworth won't
promise you/the moon. (Although we are working
on some ideas that may eventually get you there
and back.)'We are an old, young organization. Old,
in the sense of being pioneers in the field of elec
tronics./(Our technical director, Dr. Philo Farnsworth
n invented electronic television.) Young, by being the
newest division of the world-wide International Tele
phone and Telegraph Corporation, devoting our ef
forts exclusively to research, development and pro-
/ auction of mili ary and industrial electronics, and
atomic energy.
All of which makes Farnsworth big enough for sta
bility and technical perspective, yet small enough
for mobility, flexibility and recognition of the in
dividual. Here you will be associated with and
encouraged by a team of eminent scientists and
engineers with many "firsts" to their credit in the
field of electronics. Here you will be heard . , . not
just one of the herd.
We earnestly invite you to hear the whole fascinating
Farnsworth story. We're pretty certain it will make
i the decision for your future easier.
