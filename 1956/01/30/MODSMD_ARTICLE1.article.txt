# Cards Win Pair From Duck Five
## Victories Keep Tribe In PCC Contention 
### 
Stanford mixed a stubborn,
impend ruble defense wit 11 a
sharp outside shooting attack
over tlie weekend to whip Ore
gon s Ducks by scores of 74-55
and 73-f>o.
The twin victories moved the
Cards closer to UCLA's idle Bru
ins although Coach Howie Dall
mar's troops remain in fourth
place. Washington and Southern
California also swept their' series
over the weekend to retain their
hold on second place.
Both Stanford - Webfoot games
ran about the same way. Things
remained on even terms until
shortly before half-time when the
Indians scooted into the le;id. The
visitors failed to threaten either
night in the second half.
Two for Max
Barry Brown's sharp defensing
oÂ£ Max Anderson and the deadly
jump-shooting of Bill Bond fea
tured Friday night's contest. Big
Max. the (J-7 center with the 21-
point average, was held to a mere
two free throws by Brown.
Bouncing Barry blocked Ander
son's first shot attempt and the
big pivot man could not get start
ed after that.
Bond was especially sharp in
the first half Friday night as he
singed the nets for 14 points. He
added six more markers after tha
intermission for a night's totaT
of 20.
Brown Hits 17
Besides holding down Oregon's
high-scoring inside man, Brown
tallied 17 points of his own. Cap
tain George Sellec-k netted 14 and
Bill Flanders hit for 11 as the
Indians took the series curtain
raiser.
With Anderson failing to dam
age Stanford's defense, Oregon
was forced to do much of its scor
ing from outside. Coach Bill
Borcher's weaving style of of
fense set up screens for jump
shooting Jerry Ross who tallied
15 points.
Ross Doubtful
Ross, the veteran guard, and
forward Charlie Franklin, a soph
omore junior college transfer
from Los Angeles, were Oregon's
big guns Friday. Franklin, al
though showing weaknesses as a
ball-handler, was very tough on
ihe boards and scored 14 points.
Ross had been named a doubt
ful starter because of an injured
knee. The 6-1 co-captain was Ore
gun's play-maker as well as their
top scorer.
The Webfoot team drew loud
cheers from the Stanford fans
(hiring the first official time out
Friday night. As the Ducks re
treated to talk to Borcher, the
Oregon trainer whipped out five
green lawn chairs for the weary
cage warriors.
New Strategy
Borcher revamped his line-up
for the Saturday afternoon en
counter and changed his defen
sive strategy. The Webfoots shift
ed from the man-to-man style
which they had used Friday to an
active zone defense.
Oregon's strategy proved very
effective until late in the first
half when little George Selleck
unleashed four consecutive field
goals from far out to give the
Cards a 32-28 lead. A short rally
early in the second half gave
Stanford a 30-point lead and drove
the Ducks out of their zone.
One of the main factors in the
Indians' rally was a pressing de
fense which forced the visitors to
throw the ball away on several
occasions. This was the same de
fense which was so effective
against Oregon State last week.
Selleck Sharp
Selleck was easily the outstand
ing player on the floor Saturday.
He connected on 11 of 22 field
goal attempts and one free throw
for 23 points.
Oregon's Max Anderson came
back on Saturday to show the
form which makes him one of the
PCC's highest scoring centers.
Although he didn't start, Ander
son picked up 16 points for the
northerners.
Charlie Franklin was the chief
point-getter for the Ducks as he
tallied 18 markers. Just as in the
series opener, Franklin was a
rugged rebounder.
Barry Brown and Bill Bond
again hit double digits for Stan
ford on Saturday. Blond Barry
tanked 17 while the junior for
ward from Long Bcach sank 12.
Stanford's chorale performed
for Saturday afternoon's televised
game. The mixed singing group
gave forth with music from
"Brigadoon" during the half-time
intermission.


OREGON GARDEN ( LI B gathers around Coach Hill Borcher dur
ing Saturday's basketball game between the Ducks and Stanford's
Indians. The Webfoot quintet rested their weary limbs on these
green lawn chairs during time-outs in the weekend series. These
folding metal and canvas chairs could replace benches if some en
terprising coach takes over where Borcher left off. Oregon players
seated during this rest period are Ed Bingham, Phil Mcllugh, Hal
Duffy, and Charlie Franklin.
