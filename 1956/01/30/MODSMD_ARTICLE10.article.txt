# Storms Create Heavy Damage On Golf Course
## 
### 
The Stanford golf course has
sustained heavy damage from the
storms of the past month.
However, in last week's rains
there was not as much damage as
from the storms at the end of De
cember, according to golf coach
Bud Finger. Aside from fallen
tree limbs and loosened roots,
most recent damage was from
landslides.
Had there been heavy winds
with last week's rains, Finger
thinks many trees which with
stood December's buffeting might
hav fallen.
A rundown on conditions at
specific holes reveals only the
fourteenth hole completely iso 5
lated. Generally, the course is
soggy and unplayable. It will have
to remain closed until the ground
has dried out.
Other damage to the course in
cludes a fallen tree behind the
pump house, which, according to
Finger, changes the appearance
of the last part of the course con
siderably. A fence has blown
down near the practice area and
is being repaired.
