first-in-t lie-nation primary March 13.
His announcement leaves the way clear for President Eisen
hower. the only Hepuhlican candidate in the Presidential prefer-

ence section of ihe primary.
Knowland also disclaimed the!
three New Hampshire persons
who, without consulting him, had
entered the race for GOP dele
gates as "favorable" to him. At
last count, 17 delegates favoring
the President had entered the
race. Fourteen delegates are
elected from New Hampshire.
At a news conference, Know
land said he would not enter the
New Hampshire primary because
it was too early. He said he would
not have a chance to withdraw if
the President discloses before
that time whether he will be a
candidate for re-election.
Knowland explained that he al
lowed his name to remain in the
Alaska and Illinois primaries be
cause they do not take place until
April.
The GOP leader reaffirmed his
opposition against the possibility
of a candidate" at
the Republican National Conven
tion if Mi\ Eisenhower does not
run.
"I think it would be devastat
ing ... to nullify all the state pri
maries," said Knowland. He add
ed that such tactics would be "bad
would insinuate that the "Ameri
can people were not capable of
selecting their own leadership."
Knowland. here for a lalk with
the Manrhester Union-Leader ad
vertisers, stressed the importance
of a speedy announcement on the
President's plans.
"I believe he will fori brightly
issue a statement that will clarify
the atmosphere before the 15th of
February," he said. "Otherwise
we would have, in effect, a nulli
fication of the electoral process."
Knowland said that if such a
statement came after the middle
of February it would be too late
for GOP Presidential hopefuls to
enter many of the state primaries
and would give the rank and file
Republicans no chance to make
their views known.
