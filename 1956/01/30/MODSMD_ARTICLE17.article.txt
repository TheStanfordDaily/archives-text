# A 						Newspaper's Goal
## 
### 
The goal of any responsible newspaper is the
best possible service to the majority of its
readers. That is The Daily's goal.
The Daily has a readership of 10,500. Its
news must satisfy the needs, the wishes and the
curiosities of a majority of those 10,500. Other
wise it is not fulfilling the function for which
it was established more than 60 years ago.
1 he Daily is proud of its 63-year record of
service. During that time the majority of its
readers have benefited from its efforts.
And now in its 64th year at the University
The Daily hopes to continue that record.
In operation the paper is limited by avail
able space, four to six pages. Most of the news
is limited to that of wide general interest. The
Daily w oil-Id like to print notice of each and
every activity on campus, but its first duty is
to print news, not publicity.
In recent years the newspaper's function has
broadened. Not only is the daily paper ex
pected to inform its readers and be an opinion
leader, it must also entertain its readers
through feature stories, columns and reviews.
One of its most important roles is that of
an opinion leader. And The Daily does ex
press opinion. Always fair, but certainly not
always in agreement with all readers.
Our editorials are unsigned; they express

the opinion of The Daily, not necessarily that
of an individual.
The reader always has the opportunity to
answer, or to express his own opinion, through
the letters to the editor column. Anyone who
believes his views are important enough for
10,500 readers should identify himself, so it
is only under the most unusual circumstances
that an unsigned letter appears.
The Daily editorial offices are open to any
one who may have anything to discuss with the
editors. They can only serve in the best pos
sible way if they know what is wanted. And
personal contact is one of the methods of find
ing out what is wanted, needed.
The Daily's politics are not partisan, they
are liberal.
The Daily prints the news, it does not make
it. For those among our readers who think a
newspaper should hide so-called "bad" news,
let them remember one of our guiding slogans,
"corny" but a useful guide:
"If you don't want to see it in The Daily,
don't let it happen."
For if The Daily manages to record even a
small part of the many occurrences at Stanford,
it will indeed be accomplishing what it started
out to do, way back in 1892:
To satisfy the needs, the wishes and the cu
riosities of a majority of its readers.

1 he Daily is proud of its 63-year record of
service. During that time the majority of its
readers have benefited from its efforts.
And now in its 64th year at the University
The Daily hopes to continue that record.
In operation the paper is limited by avail
able space, four to six pages. Most of the news
is limited to that of wide general interest. The
Daily w oil-Id like to print notice of each and
every activity on campus, but its first duty is
to print news, not publicity.
In recent years the newspaper's function has
broadened. Not only is the daily paper ex
pected to inform its readers and be an opinion
leader, it must also entertain its readers
through feature stories, columns and reviews.
One of its most important roles is that of
an opinion leader. And The Daily does ex
press opinion. Always fair, but certainly not
always in agreement with all readers.
Our editorials are unsigned; they express

the opinion of The Daily, not necessarily that
of an individual.
The reader always has the opportunity to
answer, or to express his own opinion, through
the letters to the editor column. Anyone who
believes his views are important enough for
10,500 readers should identify himself, so it
is only under the most unusual circumstances
that an unsigned letter appears.
The Daily editorial offices are open to any
one who may have anything to discuss with the
editors. They can only serve in the best pos
sible way if they know what is wanted. And
personal contact is one of the methods of find
ing out what is wanted, needed.
The Daily's politics are not partisan, they
are liberal.
The Daily prints the news, it does not make
it. For those among our readers who think a
newspaper should hide so-called "bad" news,
let them remember one of our guiding slogans,
"corny" but a useful guide:
"If you don't want to see it in The Daily,
don't let it happen."
For if The Daily manages to record even a
small part of the many occurrences at Stanford,
it will indeed be accomplishing what it started
out to do, way back in 1892:
To satisfy the needs, the wishes and the cu
riosities of a majority of its readers.
The goal of any responsible newspaper is the
best possible service to the majority of its
readers. That is The Daily's goal.
The Daily has a readership of 10,500. Its
news must satisfy the needs, the wishes and the
curiosities of a majority of those 10,500. Other
wise it is not fulfilling the function for which
it was established more than 60 years ago.
