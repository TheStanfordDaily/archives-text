# This Week on
## Jorda, Solar Energy And Miscellaneous Art 
### Ric Teague 
There's good news for the well-rounded ex
tra-curricularist this week. The events are few,
but good, and most are a fair bet to add a
veneer of culture to campus personalities.
* * *
Enrique Jorda brings the San Francisco Sym
phony to Mem Aud tonight for a concert under
the auspices ol the ASSU Concert Series. Down
beat time is 8:15. Prices range from $1.50 to
$2.2s—and lor that modest sum you can hear
David Abel romp through Tchaikowsky's vio
lin concerto and the orchestra do Beethoven,
Ravel and Berlioz.
* ■# *
And for those who haven't got the $2.25—
or even $1.50, there are a couple of neat ex
hibits going on in the more aesthetic corners of
•lie Farm. The Art Gallery is showing some
retrospective paintings and lithos by artist
Richard Bowman. Don't miss it if you like to
retrospect. The Museum has about 3000 years'
worth of Korean ceramics on display. They
date back fo 1000 B.C. and that sounds pretty
retrospective, too.
* * *
Stanford Research Institute's Charles A.
Searlott will tell the Tuesday Evening Series
all about solar energy tomorrow. Even that
sounds retrospective — considering not many
even remember what the sun is like.
# * *
Wednesday is everyone's day to find out who
among the student body spent some time per
forming for one of Uncle Sam's armed services
during the Korean conflict. Veterans who come
under the Korean G.I. Hill will tear the doors
off the National Service Office on Inner Quad
in the rush to sign January attendance vouch
ers. Twenty days later, they hope, local check
cashing emporiums will face a flood of blue
cardboard checks.
* # *
Stanford—Today ami Tomorrow goes into
another round of talks Wednesday night.
Watch page one to keep posted on this one. ...
* * *
Also on Wednesday: Stanford Folk and
Square Dancers will shake the floor of the
Women's Gym at 7:30 p.m. I hey say every
one's welcome and instruction will be given to
the• inexpert. Just say Cotton-eyed Joe sent
you. . . .
* * *
I he Stanford Players, hoping one good turn

out deserves another, begin llieir second week
oi "'Dangerous Corner" Wednesday evening at
8:15 and will keep going until they are flagged
down Saturday niglit. They were good last
week and may he even better now—eerlaiuly
worth a buck.
* * *
Thursday is another day chock full of en
tertainment and gets off to a quick start as
Farm physicists take their slide-rules to Room
372 to hear a talk on "Recent Developments in
'Circular' Particle Accelerators." Persons with
broken or out-dated circular particle accelera
tors may find hope in the address. . . .
* # *
And Thursday is a big day for moviegoers.
If your eyes are strong enough you can stare
at the good, old-fashioned silver screen from
4:15 p.m. until after 9 p.m.—with time out for
dinner. In 1-D, narrow screen black-and-white
(for the younger students—this is sort of like
BIG T-V with a BIG audience). Intermezzo
film for the day is "Flowers of St. Francis,"
directed by Roberto Rossellini. 4:15 p.m. in
Cubberley. After dinner you can go back to
Cubberley for "JNanook of the North" and
"Song of Ceylon." Both are real epics.
* * *
The Folk Dancers move to the Village Audi
torium Friday for another session of stomps
and hollers. First call is at 8:15 p.m. The old
pros at the folk-dancing game will give ele
mentary instruction for clumsier people like
you and me.
* * *
On Saturday night the class of "*59 will be
schmalzing up the Pavilion floor at the Frosli
Dance—finale to their class card sales effort.
Spike Lynch and his hand (a loosely-knit
group of five troubadours) will make noise for
the affair which is doomed to last from 9 p.m.
until 1 a.nx. the next day.
* * *
Sunday night it's back to Mem And for an
other in a long line of movies which were
"better than ever" a couple of years ago. Rich
ard Burton and Maggie McNamara throw in
their lot with a CinemaScope director or two
and struggle out with "Prince of Players." For
25 cents you can see John Wilkes Boothe as
sassinate President Lincoln.
* * *
Quote of the week (and Dr. Hailey, just what
does it mean?), from Mr. Shakespeare's "An
tony and Cleopatra": "The shirt of JNcssus is
upon inc."

And Thursday is a big day for moviegoers.
If your eyes are strong enough you can stare
at the good, old-fashioned silver screen from
4:15 p.m. until after 9 p.m.—with time out for
dinner. In 1-D, narrow screen black-and-white
(for the younger students—this is sort of like
BIG T-V with a BIG audience). Intermezzo
film for the day is "Flowers of St. Francis,"
directed by Roberto Rossellini. 4:15 p.m. in
Cubberley. After dinner you can go back to
Cubberley for "JNanook of the North" and
"Song of Ceylon." Both are real epics.
* * *
The Folk Dancers move to the Village Audi
torium Friday for another session of stomps
and hollers. First call is at 8:15 p.m. The old
pros at the folk-dancing game will give ele
mentary instruction for clumsier people like
you and me.
* * *
On Saturday night the class of "*59 will be
schmalzing up the Pavilion floor at the Frosli
Dance—finale to their class card sales effort.
Spike Lynch and his hand (a loosely-knit
group of five troubadours) will make noise for
the affair which is doomed to last from 9 p.m.
until 1 a.nx. the next day.
* * *
Sunday night it's back to Mem And for an
other in a long line of movies which were
"better than ever" a couple of years ago. Rich
ard Burton and Maggie McNamara throw in
their lot with a CinemaScope director or two
and struggle out with "Prince of Players." For
25 cents you can see John Wilkes Boothe as
sassinate President Lincoln.
* * *
Quote of the week (and Dr. Hailey, just what
does it mean?), from Mr. Shakespeare's "An
tony and Cleopatra": "The shirt of JNcssus is
upon inc."
There's good news for the well-rounded ex
tra-curricularist this week. The events are few,
but good, and most are a fair bet to add a
veneer of culture to campus personalities.
* * *
Enrique Jorda brings the San Francisco Sym
phony to Mem Aud tonight for a concert under
the auspices ol the ASSU Concert Series. Down
beat time is 8:15. Prices range from $1.50 to
$2.2s—and lor that modest sum you can hear
David Abel romp through Tchaikowsky's vio
lin concerto and the orchestra do Beethoven,
Ravel and Berlioz.
* ■# *
And for those who haven't got the $2.25—
or even $1.50, there are a couple of neat ex
hibits going on in the more aesthetic corners of
•lie Farm. The Art Gallery is showing some
retrospective paintings and lithos by artist
Richard Bowman. Don't miss it if you like to
retrospect. The Museum has about 3000 years'
worth of Korean ceramics on display. They
date back fo 1000 B.C. and that sounds pretty
retrospective, too.
* * *
Stanford Research Institute's Charles A.
Searlott will tell the Tuesday Evening Series
all about solar energy tomorrow. Even that
sounds retrospective — considering not many
even remember what the sun is like.
# * *
Wednesday is everyone's day to find out who
among the student body spent some time per
forming for one of Uncle Sam's armed services
during the Korean conflict. Veterans who come
under the Korean G.I. Hill will tear the doors
off the National Service Office on Inner Quad
in the rush to sign January attendance vouch
ers. Twenty days later, they hope, local check
cashing emporiums will face a flood of blue
cardboard checks.

out deserves another, begin llieir second week

hibits going on in the more aesthetic corners of
•lie Farm. The Art Gallery is showing some
retrospective paintings and lithos by artist
Richard Bowman. Don't miss it if you like to
retrospect. The Museum has about 3000 years'
worth of Korean ceramics on display. They
date back fo 1000 B.C. and that sounds pretty
retrospective, too.

Stanford Research Institute's Charles A.
Searlott will tell the Tuesday Evening Series
all about solar energy tomorrow. Even that
sounds retrospective — considering not many
even remember what the sun is like.

Wednesday is everyone's day to find out who
among the student body spent some time per
forming for one of Uncle Sam's armed services
during the Korean conflict. Veterans who come
under the Korean G.I. Hill will tear the doors
off the National Service Office on Inner Quad
in the rush to sign January attendance vouch
ers. Twenty days later, they hope, local check
cashing emporiums will face a flood of blue
cardboard checks.

And Thursday is a big day for moviegoers.
If your eyes are strong enough you can stare
at the good, old-fashioned silver screen from
4:15 p.m. until after 9 p.m.—with time out for
dinner. In 1-D, narrow screen black-and-white
(for the younger students—this is sort of like
BIG T-V with a BIG audience). Intermezzo
film for the day is "Flowers of St. Francis,"
directed by Roberto Rossellini. 4:15 p.m. in
Cubberley. After dinner you can go back to
Cubberley for "JNanook of the North" and
"Song of Ceylon." Both are real epics.

you and me.

group of five troubadours) will make noise for
the affair which is doomed to last from 9 p.m.
until 1 a.nx. the next day.
* * *
Sunday night it's back to Mem And for an
other in a long line of movies which were

ard Burton and Maggie McNamara throw in
their lot with a CinemaScope director or two

25 cents you can see John Wilkes Boothe as
sassinate President Lincoln.

Quote of the week (and Dr. Hailey, just what
does it mean?), from Mr. Shakespeare's "An
tony and Cleopatra": "The shirt of JNcssus is
upon inc."
There's good news for the well-rounded ex
tra-curricularist this week. The events are few,
but good, and most are a fair bet to add a
veneer of culture to campus personalities.
