# Fine Arts Quartet Displays 'Broad Musical Expressiveness'
## 
### Richard Mende 
Last Friday night the Fine Arts Quartet displayed the qualities
which have distinguished their work—and which are among the
special assets of their medium: clarity, deftness of touch and broad
musical expressiveness.

The major attraction of (lie cv
fifth quartet. Perhaps the finesse
which characterized the group's
playing caused them to fall some
what short of the full realization
of this modern masterpiece, but
it was still a fascinating perform
ance.
Bartok utilized the entire cata
logue of string technique, includ
ing gliding pizzicatos, playing
with the wood of the bow, and
fantastic moanings and tremolos.
And, too, his characteristic com
plex, savage rhythms are used, all
without the least self-conscious
ness of innovation.
Again, it is in the kinetic pas
sages that the finesse of the Fine
Arts Quartet seemed slightly un
comfortable and out of place, but
their work did convey the en
gulfing depths of Bartok's fury.
Certainly the musical idiom of
Mozart's D Major Quartet, which

ning was the playing of Bartok's

opened the program, was unusu
ally well suited to the special tal
ents of the Fine Arts Quartet.
This composition is supple and
its transparency was splendidly
illuminated, especially in the fi
nale.
The second half of the program
was the C minor quartet of Bee
thoven— lively and fast-moving,
yet capturing in its somber pas
sages tho spirit which character
ized Beethoven's later works.
The second movement, which is
traditionally slow, is very lively,
as is the final movement, which
has a distinctive gypsy flavor. But
even so, Beethoven's brooding na
ture pervades the composition.
Certainly it was an engrossing
evening with both polish and pen
etration.
