SHATTLK, Wasli., Jan. 2!> (U.R)
Johnny Cherberg, who was
fired last Friday as coach of the
University of Washington foot
ball team, today warned appli
cants to "beware of the unhappy
I riumvirate."
Cherberg said he was talking
about university vice president
It. P. (Dick) Everest, athletic di
rector Harvey Cassill and alum
nus Roscoe (Torchy) Torrance.
The latter is an active recruiter
for athletes.
Cherberg blamed those three
men for his dismissal and claimed
that the uneasy football situation
here wouldn't become harmoni
ous until "Cassill and Everest are
out of the picture."
