## 
### Joe Ramsey 
Ttie Stanford Braves racked up
two more victories this weekend
as they defeated San Mateo J.C.
and the Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion Friday and Saturday nights
respectively.
The ill-fated San Mateans fell,
75-56, before the Braves' basket
ball machinery as center Jay
Jackson turned in a spectacular
22-point performance to capture
high scoring honors for the win
ners.
Guards Dean Thomas and Jerry
Rose played outstanding defens
ive ball, while forward Tom Dyer
and Jackson maintained control
of ihe backboards. Dyer was sec
ond highest scorer with 13.
Far from satisfied, the blood
thirsty Braves bounced back Sat
urday night to claim another
scalp. Tom Dyer opened Stan
ford's scoring attack with a short
jump shot and the Braves went
on to score two more field goals
before the Alameda Hellcats could
tally.
Action then settled down to de
velop into what looked like a tight
ball game until midway in the
first half when center Nick Vo.j
vodich netted two rebound shots
to gain a slight advantage. The
Braves went on to establish a 10-
point edge at half time as the
score read Braves 32, Hellcats 22.
Guard Jerry Rose turned in the
outstanding performance of the
game during the second half. Aft
er failing to score at all in the
first stanza, he promptly dropped
five field goals and four free
throws in the first 10 minuies of
ihe second half to pace the Braves
with 14 points.
Center John Henry and guard
Paul Hendison netted 12 points
each as they tied for high-point
laurels for the Hellcats. Hendison
arid guard Bob Shepherd played
sharp defensive ball but not sharp
enough. Final score: Braves 70,
Hellcats 50.
