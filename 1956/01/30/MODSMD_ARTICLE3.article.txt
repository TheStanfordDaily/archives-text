# Daily Changes Style of Type
## 
### 
For about as long as anybody can
remember (well over 20 years) The
Daily has been set in this type. It is
eight-point Linotype Textype.
Textype is one of the older news
types now in use. It is still found in
many small newspapers, although
most metropol i t a n dailies have
switched to the more modem "legi
bility faces" designed for maximum
readability.
These few inches of Textype are
the last the Stanford reader will see
in The Doily. In the interests of pro
viding a brighter page and a more
readable product to its audience, The
Daily today changes its body to In
tertype Regal No. 2.
Regal No. 2 is a much more mod
ern face and, although it is the same
size as the older type, it has a much
larger character. It is the openness
of the character that lends it its high
readability.
For its 10-point opening para
graphs to top stories, The Daily
switches from the square - serifed
Memphis Medium to the classic Bo
doni Regular.
