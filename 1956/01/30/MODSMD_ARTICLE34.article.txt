# CHARITY DRIVE
## WUS Reports $1200 Netted Last Week 
### 
About $1200 has been turned in
to World University Service dur
ing the past Winter Quarter Drive
week, according to treasurer Nor
man Kibbe.
However, Drive officials expect
the greatest part of the money to
come in today and tomorrow,
when living group solicitors will
report.
"Our tentative goal is $5000,"
says Chairman Bill Crookston, "or
$1 per person."
Unit leaders in each living
group are asked to bring their
money to ihe Cardinal office, up
stairs in the ASSU Building, to
day and tomorrow between 4 and
5:30 p.m.
According to Crookston, Stan
ford has consistently ranked one
of the lowest in dollars per capita
given to charity, not only on the
Coast but in state and national
averages also.
Last year, the Stanford contri
bution to WUS was 1-4 cents per
person. Crookston contrasted this
with $10 per person last year at
Mills College, $7 at Harvard, $3
at t he University of California at
Berkeley and $1.50 at U.C.L.A.
Only once, in 1947, did Stanford
meet its goal of $1 per student.
"We believe this results from
ignorance of the purpose of the
Drive and of the conditions under
which foreign students live," said
Crookston. "We don't believe it's
just callousness."
In ihe East especially, he said,
it is often difficult to produce the
well-educated leaders which many
countries desperately need.
