# Visiting British Scholar Calls Hoover Collection 'Remarkable'
## 
### 
"\o other library in the United States outside of the Lihrar\
of Congress has such a remarkable collection of specialized mate
rial as Stanford's Hoover Library."
This testimonial to the Hoover collection on "War, Hevolution
and Peace" wa« bestowed by Sir lifewellyn Woodward, a visiting

will not have to work during va
: cations and can graduate in less
time.
To give maximum opportunity
for study, examinations are given
at the end of summer vacation.
Complicated by the influence of
American students, the fact that
aid is no longer sufficient to cover
education costs, and other eco
nomic considerations, this tradi
tion is slowly diminishing, he
said.
Turning to the British position
in international affairs. Sir Llew
ellyn described the present prob
lem of the independence move
ment in Cyprus as "purely a mili
tary one."
Emphasizing the strategic im
portance of Cyprus, he said that
"it isn't only a British question,
bul a key point in the whole de
fense of the West."
"If we could make sure there
j was no Communist threat, we
j could walk out right now; but we
i just can't be sure," he explained.

Sir Llewellyn will spend aj
month investigating sources at |
the library in preparation for a
book on twentieth century Eng
lish history.
Laughing and commenting that
he could spend months poring
through material in the library,
Sir Lewellyn admitted that he
could spend only a month here
before returning to his work at
the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton.
The scholarly but witty British
er divides his time between the
Princeton Institute and his home
at Oxford University, where he
has taught history for many
years.
Differences
As an academician of long
standing, Sir Lewellyn pointed
out several differences between
American universities and his al
ma mater, Oxford.
At Oxford and most other Eng- j
lish universities, students take
one general course, such as his
tory. during their entire under
graduate career, leaving little op
portunity to branch out in other
fields, but affording greater
chances for concentration on thei
student's specific field of interest.;
With lectures only optional, he
said, "the main part of our sys- j
tem lies in weekly sessions with
a tutor for which the student pre
pares an essay."
There are normally only two
university examinations -one giv
en during the first year, and a 1
collection of several multiple-hour
tests given just before gradua-!
tion.
"Corporate Body"
In contrast to American
schools, Sir Llewellyn said, Ox
ford represents the older idea of I
a university as a corporate body '
of persons.
When an American s t u d en t
comes to Oxford and asks him j
where the university is located, 1
Sir Lewellyn bewilders him by J
answering, "I am the university," |
in accordance with the old Euro- 1
pean theory that a university is
not a material collection of build- i
ings, but a "corporation of indi- ;
viduals living and working in an
intellectual society."
The theory of the university as
developed in Europe follows the
pattern of the medieval guilds,
Sir Llewellyn pointed out. The ap
prentice learns from the master,
passes his test and becomes a
master himself.
Another difference he cited is
the fact that at Oxford students
are expected to study throughout i
the entire year, and receive great - \
er support through university or I
state scholarships so that they jj

Sir Llewellyn will spend aj
month investigating sources at |
the library in preparation for a
book on twentieth century Eng
lish history.
Laughing and commenting that
he could spend months poring
through material in the library,
Sir Lewellyn admitted that he
could spend only a month here
before returning to his work at
the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton.
The scholarly but witty British
er divides his time between the
Princeton Institute and his home
at Oxford University, where he
has taught history for many
years.
Differences
As an academician of long
standing, Sir Lewellyn pointed
out several differences between
American universities and his al
ma mater, Oxford.
At Oxford and most other Eng- j
lish universities, students take
one general course, such as his
tory. during their entire under
graduate career, leaving little op
portunity to branch out in other
fields, but affording greater
chances for concentration on thei
student's specific field of interest.;
With lectures only optional, he
said, "the main part of our sys- j
tem lies in weekly sessions with
a tutor for which the student pre
pares an essay."
There are normally only two
university examinations -one giv
en during the first year, and a 1
collection of several multiple-hour
tests given just before gradua-!
tion.
"Corporate Body"
In contrast to American
schools, Sir Llewellyn said, Ox
ford represents the older idea of I
a university as a corporate body '
of persons.
When an American s t u d en t
comes to Oxford and asks him j
where the university is located, 1
Sir Lewellyn bewilders him by J
answering, "I am the university," |
in accordance with the old Euro- 1
pean theory that a university is
not a material collection of build- i
ings, but a "corporation of indi- ;
viduals living and working in an
intellectual society."
