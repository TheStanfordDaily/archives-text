IIATTIMORE, Md.„ Jan. 29— I
Henry L. Mencken, world-famed j
author, language authority and!
critic o! "boolnts Ainericaniis." I
died here today of a heart seiz
ure.
The 75-year-old "saqjo of Balti

manners and customs.
The peaceful manner of his
j death contrasted most sharply!
with the robust way he lived fori
a half-century as a newspaper
man. essayist, magazine editor!
and "quote, "disturber of tho|
peace" of United States life and
letters.
From his witty and vitriolic pen I
flowed some of the most-quoted j
comments in American letters.
His non - conformist viewpoint
j was summed up* best in the epi-1
I taph which he wrote for himself
years ago. It said:
"If, after I depart this vale, you :
ever remember me, and have
thought to please my ghost, for- 1
give some sinner and wink your
eye at a homely girl."
Because of a heart condition
which at last proved fatal, Menck
en had been living quietly for the
past seven years at the family
residence on Hollins Street. Both
I ho and his bachelor brother, Au
; gust, who shared the quarters,
were born there.
A stroke in 1948 made speech
difficult for Mencken.
Although forced by illness to
give up his writing, Mencken was
preparing to take a final shot at
American folkways in the form of
a new volume of essays unpub
! lished in previous collections.
He spent his last evening in
| typical fashion, conversing with
an old friend, Louis Ohoflock of
the Pea body Music Conservatory.
Chefloek was a charter member
of the Saturday Night Club, an
organization which used to take
! weekly flings at the classics.
