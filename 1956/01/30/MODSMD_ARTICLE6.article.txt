Flumes Mazing unnoticed ear
ly yesterday evening gutted tlie
Stanford home of Professor Ko
herlo B. Sangiorgi, 538 May
(ield, leaving only l!i<* charred
skeleton of Ihe large white stucco
house.
Stanford Fire Department was
alerted to the blaze at 8:15 p.m.
by Â£>angiorgi's neighbor, Dr. Jay
Ward Smith, and Ihe fire was
under control in approximately
one-half hour, according to Fire
Chief John Marston.
The house is located off the
lower .Row behind the Phi Sigma
Kappa house.
Sangiorgi, associate professor
of Germanic and Romanic lan
guages, was not at home when
the blaze broke out. Cause of the
blaze and how long it had been
burning before Ihe Fire Depart
was alerted were not known.
Smith said that by the time he
detected Ihe fire, flames were
shooting from 15 to 20 feet up
from the top of Ihe tile roof.
Damage to the house was de
scribed by Marston as "extensive"
with only the kitchen and one
room upstairs escaping destruc
tion.
According to Marston, flames
were coming out of ihe roof and
windows and from between the
walls by the time the three fire
trucks arrived.
"Everywhere we turned," Mar
ston said, "there was fire."
Pressure from heat and smoke
built up so long in the house that
it finally burst out through walls,
windows and roof, he explained.
Smith said he called the Fire
Department "almost idly" be
cause he was sure the fire had
already been turned in. The house
was shrouded in trees and not
easily seen from ihe road.
The Fire Department had been
alerted to the smell of smoke
about 8:10 p.m. by a call from
Hurlburt House, but presumed
that the smoke was coming from
ihe dumps on the other side of
campus which had been burning
during the day.



FLAMES WHICH GUTTED a faculty member's house last night
laid waste the entire interior and destroyed all furniture. In the

the dining room. Long after the blaze started, walls and furniture
were still burning. In the bottom photograph, a flaming settee is
