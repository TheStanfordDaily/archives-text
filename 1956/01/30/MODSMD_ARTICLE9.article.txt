state hearing officer last Friday
as three key figures testified.
E. A. McDonald heard Stanford
student Jerome Jeffries, Rossot
ti's owner Edward Clark and ABC
agent Bernard H. Cohn relate the
now-famous incident of Oct. 21.
Reports will he filed within the
next few flays by Attorney s
Frank L. Hannig, for the defense,
and Sidney Klein berg, for the
state. A decision may be expected

in two weeks.
Cohn was first on the stand in
the nearly - deserted San Mateo
County Courthouse room.
Cheeks IIVs
He testified that he had entered
Rossotti's and had checked ID's
at tables for "about five or ten
minutes" before he approached
Jeff lies on the outside porch.
"He looked to be fairly young
and was drinking from a quart
bottle when I saw him," Cohn
stated. He "took Jeffr ies into cus
tody" and allowed him to go to
the restroom before walking out
with him into the parking lot.
Then Jeffries "took for the
hills," Cohn said, leaving the beer
bottle (three-quarters filled) in
the agent's hands.
Hit by Missile
Shortly afterwards Cohn was
"hit by a missile—a peanut," the
beer bottle was removed by per
son unknown and the keys to the
Agent's car were missing.
This was the result of what
Cohn termed a "voluntary move
ment" on the part of the crowd of
about 100 students.
Next on the stand, 20-year-old
Jerome Jeffries (he'll be 21 next
month) admitted purchasing the
beer and taking "a swallow" from
it on the porch.
False License
He said he was in possession of
a false identification card—an Il
linois state drivers license—"vali
dated" only with a PAID stamp
Jeffries obtained at the Alpha
' Delta Phi house, where he lives
on campus.
Jeffries testified he had used
other false ID's on previous oc
casions at Rossotti's, including
times when he had cashed checks,
but on this particular day was not
asked to show an ID.
Owner Clark denied selling beer
to the youth. He said Jeffries had
produced identi feat ion on previ
ous occasions stating his age as
21.
Border Cases
As to policy on checking ID's,
Clark said he "wouldn't hesitate
checking a person who looked to
be on the border-line." On the
other han d, he wouldn't check
somebody who was 50, or regular
patrons whom he knew to be over
21.
While questioning, Attorney
Hannig referred to articles from
The Stanford Daily in trying to
) ascertain the layout at the beer
I garden. A 1 the conclusion of the
hearing he asked for five days to
prepare a memorandum of de
fense arguments, a request which
McDonald granted.
, Jeffries, a junior, has returned
| to campus after having been sus
pended following the incident and
i his surrender to school and ABC
officials six days afterward. He

tody" and allowed him to go to
the restroom before walking out
with him into the parking lot.
Then Jeffries "took for the
hills," Cohn said, leaving the beer
bottle (three-quarters filled) in
the agent's hands.
Hit by Missile
Shortly afterwards Cohn was
"hit by a missile—a peanut," the
beer bottle was removed by per
son unknown and the keys to the
Agent's car were missing.
This was the result of what
Cohn termed a "voluntary move
ment" on the part of the crowd of
about 100 students.

produced identi feat ion on previ
ous occasions stating his age as
21.
