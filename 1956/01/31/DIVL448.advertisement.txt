The demand for engineers-experienced or graduate

are going to be sought after more than a triple threat
halfback for next year's varsity.
You will be promised many things (including the
moon with a fence/around it), and for a young man
just getting started these things are pretty hard
to resist. /
So, again, let's be frank. We at Farnsworth won't
promise you/the moon. (Although we are working
on some ideas that may eventually get you there
and back.)'We are an old, young organization. Old,
In the sense of being pioneers in the field of elec
tronics./(Our technical director, Dr. Philo Farnsworth

newest division of the world-wide International Tele
phone and Telegraph Corporation, devoting our ef
forts exclusively to research, development and pro

atomic energy.
All of which makes Farnsworth big enough for sta
bility and technical perspective, yet small enough
for mobility, flexibility and recognition of the in

encouraged by a team of eminent scientists and
engineers with many "firsts" to their credit in tha
field of electronics. Here you will be heard . . . not
// just one of the herd.
We earnestly invite you to hear the whole fascinating
Farnsworth story. We're pretty certain it will moke
the decision for your future easier.
