# Sangiorgi Philosophical About Fire
## Marston Estimates Damage at $35, 000 
### 
Professor Roberto Sangiorgi,
whose home was virtually de
stroyed by fire Sunday night, was
philosophical about his loss.
"The strangest part about the
fire is that when we came back
about 11 p.m. from visi ti n g
friends in Walnut Creek, we could
not gel into our house.
"We told officials we lived here
and they asked, 'What is your
name?' 'Sangiorgi,' I replied.
'Well, you don't have n home,' the
officials said."
Sangiorgi, professor of Ger
manic and Romanic languages,
said, as he stood amidst the char
coal-blackened remnants of his
house, "We are very happy that
no. one was home when the fire
broke out, and that no lives were
lost."
Sangiorgi has three children.
Lost Work
The Spanish professor bent
over, picked up a blackened piece
of paper and murmured, "This
was the book 1 was going to
write."
Professor Sangiorgi estimated
the damages as almost total. Fire
Chief John Marston has set the
damages at $35,000, but added,
"That's just a shot in the dark."
Trying to adjust to his fate,
Sangiorgi reflected: "We sure dis
covered how many friends we
have. The co-operation of the fac
ulty and administration has been
excellent. My students have help
ed out."

Salvage Remains

Two students were helping San
giorgi salvage what remains he
could and cart away in
boxes. The students asked that
their names be withheld.
At present, the Sangiorgi fam
ily is staying with friends. They
hope to be able to rebuild the
house.
"I can tell you more about the
loss," Sangiorgi helpfully stated,
"when we start to rebuild. Maybe
we can salvage the foundations."
