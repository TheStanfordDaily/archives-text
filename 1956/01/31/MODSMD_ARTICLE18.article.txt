# Abel Plays Fine Concert Under Heavy Jorda Baton
## Soloist Excellent, But SF Symphony Lacks Preparation 
### Ric Teague 
Classical music ran hot and
cold at Memorial Auditorium last
night as Enrique Jorda entertain
ed Stanford concert-goers with ev
erything from Beethoven to Ra
vel's weird brand of semi-classical
be-bop.
But 20-year-old David Abel, a
very fine violinist from the City,
weathered the San Francisco
Symphony's inadequate accompa
niment to give as professionally
excellent a performance as is pos
sible under Jorda's heavy baton.
Young Abel had everything:
warmth of tone, really polished
technique and marvelous phras
ing. I lis solo effort made Tsehai
kovsky's "Concerto for Violin and
Orchestra" worth listening to and,
in fact, made the concert worth
sitting through.
Numerous Recitals
Despite his youth, the young
San Franciscan isn't now to the
concert stage. He has performed
with the Boston "Pops" Orchestra
under Arthur Fiedler.
In addition to his unfortunately
scheduled appearances with Jorda
in San Francisco Feb. 2, 3 and 4,
Abel will make a Norl Invest tour,
several California recitals and ap
pearances with a number of sym
phony orchestras.
Feb. 17 and IS he will solo with
the Boston Symphony under Pi
erre Monteux (who should never
have left San Francisco).
Jorda managed to struggle
through one composition, Beetho
ven's "Symphony No. 1 in C,"
without too many obvious errors.
He set a brisk pare and hurried
through the piece with almost no
variation from passage 1o pass
age. Some like this. Most don't.
Orchestra Declining
The orchestra, which has been
declining in recent years, did not
give Jorda any real support. In
the first effort of the even'ing,
Berlioz's "Overture to the Roman
Carnival, - " the brass section
sounded like a group of retired
cavalry buglers and somewhere
behind the strings there was an
awfully reedy English horn.
In the Tschaikowsky piece,
most instrumental solos (save
Abel's, of course) revealed deplor
able weaknesses. Tn the third
movement things got a little bet
ter. The double reed solos in the
Rondo were good.
Probably the biggest mistake of
the evening was inclusion in the
program of Ravel's "La Valse."
The program calls it "a choreo
graphic poem" but it is more a
neurotic cross between Stan Ken
ton and Richard Strauss.
This was Jorda at his most typ
ical. Everything that was sup
posed to go "bang" went
"BANG," cymbals crashed and
horns hooted. There was no con
tinuity of theme and very little
resolving of dissonance.
Throughout the program the
orchestra showed a lack of prepa
ration. In each piece entries were
poor. This might be Jorda's fault
but it isn't likely. He has a metro
nome built into his baton.

Despite his youth, the young
San Franciscan isn't now to the
concert stage. He has performed
with the Boston "Pops" Orchestra
under Arthur Fiedler.
In addition to his unfortunately
scheduled appearances with Jorda
in San Francisco Feb. 2, 3 and 4,
Abel will make a Norl Invest tour,
several California recitals and ap
pearances with a number of sym
phony orchestras.
Feb. 17 and IS he will solo with
the Boston Symphony under Pi
erre Monteux (who should never
have left San Francisco).
Jorda managed to struggle
through one composition, Beetho
ven's "Symphony No. 1 in C,"
without too many obvious errors.
He set a brisk pare and hurried
through the piece with almost no
variation from passage 1o pass
age. Some like this. Most don't.
Orchestra Declining
The orchestra, which has been
declining in recent years, did not
give Jorda any real support. In
the first effort of the even'ing,
Berlioz's "Overture to the Roman
Carnival, - " the brass section
sounded like a group of retired
cavalry buglers and somewhere
behind the strings there was an
awfully reedy English horn.
In the Tschaikowsky piece,
most instrumental solos (save
Abel's, of course) revealed deplor
able weaknesses. Tn the third
movement things got a little bet
ter. The double reed solos in the
Rondo were good.
Probably the biggest mistake of
the evening was inclusion in the
program of Ravel's "La Valse."
The program calls it "a choreo
graphic poem" but it is more a
neurotic cross between Stan Ken
ton and Richard Strauss.
This was Jorda at his most typ
ical. Everything that was sup
posed to go "bang" went
"BANG," cymbals crashed and
horns hooted. There was no con
tinuity of theme and very little
resolving of dissonance.
Throughout the program the
orchestra showed a lack of prepa
ration. In each piece entries were
poor. This might be Jorda's fault
but it isn't likely. He has a metro
nome built into his baton.

Classical music ran hot and
cold at Memorial Auditorium last
night as Enrique Jorda entertain
ed Stanford concert-goers with ev
erything from Beethoven to Ra
vel's weird brand of semi-classical
be-bop.
But 20-year-old David Abel, a
very fine violinist from the City,
weathered the San Francisco
Symphony's inadequate accompa
niment to give as professionally
excellent a performance as is pos
sible under Jorda's heavy baton.
Young Abel had everything:
warmth of tone, really polished
technique and marvelous phras
ing. I lis solo effort made Tsehai
kovsky's "Concerto for Violin and
Orchestra" worth listening to and,
in fact, made the concert worth
sitting through.
