## 
### 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia, Jan.
30 (UP) The eight Warsaw Pact
nations have launched an all-out
effort to perfect the mightiest
military machine in history for
the cause of Communism.
The conference of the Eastern
powers just ended here provided
the impetus to forge a military
monolith extending from the Elbe
to the Pacific and from Central
Europe to the heart of the Bal
kans, with China a major partner.
The conference developed three
major points:
• Communism's "NATO" is be
ing shaped into a tight, efficient,
unified defensive anrl slriking
military group. Marshal Ivan Ko
niev, commander-in-chief, has had
nine months to perfect the ma
chinery for direction of history's
largest military establishment.
Arms and training will be stand
ardized. Defense ministers of all
Communist countries are his dep
uties. lie can draw on all Commu
nist industry.
• East Germany will play an
important part in the Red NATO.
It has a head start on West Ger
many with its people's police and
soon will have a full-fledged army
equipped with atomic weapons.
• The combined forces of the
Warsaw Pact powers probably ex
ceed NATO's logistically as well
as numerically.
