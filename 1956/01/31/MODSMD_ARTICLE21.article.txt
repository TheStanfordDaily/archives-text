WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (UP)
â€”Hep. Usher L. Burdlck, a mem
ber of the irrepressible right wing
of the Republican party, said to
day "the dread foot and mouth
disease" is spreading in President
Eisenhower's cabinet.
Referring to furors over state
ments by Defense Secretary
Charles E. Wilson, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles and Ag
riculture Secretary Ezra T. Ben
son, he said, "Every time they
open their mouths they get their
foot in it."
Burdick's remarks were in a
newsletter to his constituents.
They were prompted by a letter
that appeared in Harper's Maga
zine recently over Benson's name
praising an anti-farmer article.
