# A 						Triple Crown Victory
## 
### 
With the appointment of Payton Jordan as
head track coach, the Stanford Department of
Athletics completed a triple crown victor) last
week.
Over a period of five years, A 1 Masters & Co.
have built the Farm's coaching staff into one
of the nation's best.
The first crowning achievement came hack
in 1951 when red-headed Chuck Taylor was
selected football coach. The wisdom of this
appointment was affirmed that very year when
the young mentor won the nation's "Coach of
the Year " award as he led the Indians to the
Rose Bowl. He has been going strong ever since.

In the spring of 1954 came another winning
move when the Board of Athletic Control voted
in Howie Dallmar as cage pilot.
The wisdom of this appointment is becom
ing increasingly apparent as the Indians, de
spite their size, loom as real title contenders
this year with 15 starts, 13 victories.
Now we have Payton Jordan who has pro
duced some of the nation's finest track teams
at Occidental College in Los Angeles.
On the basis of past performance, it is safe
to predict that he will be a winner too.
And for Stanford's future athletic teams, the
triple crown coaches will be worth their weight
in gold.

in 1951 when red-headed Chuck Taylor was

appointment was affirmed that very year when
the young mentor won the nation's "Coach of
the Year " award as he led the Indians to the
Rose Bowl. He has been going strong ever since.

In the spring of 1954 came another winning
move when the Board of Athletic Control voted

this year with 15 starts, 13 victories.
Now we have Payton Jordan who has pro

On the basis of past performance, it is safe
to predict that he will be a winner too.

With the appointment of Payton Jordan as
head track coach, the Stanford Department of
Athletics completed a triple crown victor) last
week.
Over a period of five years, A 1 Masters & Co.
have built the Farm's coaching staff into one
of the nation's best.
The first crowning achievement came hack
in 1951 when red-headed Chuck Taylor was
selected football coach. The wisdom of this
appointment was affirmed that very year when
the young mentor won the nation's "Coach of
the Year " award as he led the Indians to the
Rose Bowl. He has been going strong ever since.

In the spring of 1954 came another winning
move when the Board of Athletic Control voted
in Howie Dallmar as cage pilot.
The wisdom of this appointment is becom
ing increasingly apparent as the Indians, de
spite their size, loom as real title contenders
this year with 15 starts, 13 victories.
Now we have Payton Jordan who has pro
duced some of the nation's finest track teams
at Occidental College in Los Angeles.
On the basis of past performance, it is safe
to predict that he will be a winner too.
And for Stanford's future athletic teams, the
triple crown coaches will be worth their weight
in gold.

Santa Clara students believe they may have
been the victims of a clever con man posing
as an advertising salesman. It sounds likely,
since he was selling four-year subscriptions to
Collier's magazine at a nickel a copy.
The visitor went from hall to hall saying that
the editors were doing this to show advertisers
their magazine is the most widely read among
the nation's colleges.
His ability to disappear when a freshman
appeared with a police officer gave some stu

actually be forthcoming.

A note to those of you who arc planning to
stay up all night studying for a midterm or
finishing a paper. The student health director
at Kansas State College advises anyone to go to
bed who can't stay awake on coffee alone.
't seems that all sorts of noxious after effects
come with the use of drug store stimulants. Ner
vousness, nausea and dizzy feelings are some of
the milder symptoms. Also, students' minds
have a tendency to go blank the next day which
would negate any extra cramming for a test.
Don't you believe it, Mr. Director; 7000 In
