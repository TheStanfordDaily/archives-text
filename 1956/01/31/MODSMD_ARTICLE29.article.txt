# Minorski Hopes for Practical Use of Oscillation Theory
## 
### 
For all Iho.sc who suffer from seasickness, Dr. M. Minorski has a
possible solution.
Minorski, a visiting professor of mathematics, is doing research
on the theory of oscillations. "At. the moment," he said, "this is pure
science, hut we are hoping to see it applied in a practical manner.

"One practical application of
this theory would ho to remove
the rolling tendencies of ships,"
he continued. He is collaborating
with Dr. Menahem M. Schiffer,
head of the Stanford mathematics
department, in a book concerning
this theory.
Minorski, who was born and
educated in Russia, pointed out
that the United States must be
very careful not to underrate the
quality of work now being done
by Russian scientists.
"The scientific information that
filters out from behind the Iron
Curtain is of a very high level,"
he noted.
Minorski left Russia when the
Bolsheviks took over in 1917 and
came to the United States. He re
tired in 19-19.
His first visit to Stanford was
in 1946 when he worked for the
Office of Naval Research.
Commenting on his impressions
of academic work in the United
States, he said, "When I first
came to the .United States, I was
not overly impressed by the qual
ity of academic work being done
here.
"Since I retired to France in
1949, 1 realized that the United
States has improved its standards
until it is second to none in the
world."
