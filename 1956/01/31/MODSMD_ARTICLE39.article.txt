# Frosh Play Clutch Ball, Score Two Close Wins
## 
### Jim Price 
Dick Haga stuffed in a follow shot in the last 40 seconds of the
overtime period Saturday evening as the Stanford frqsh edged Oak
land Junior College, 55-54, to finish off another perfect weekend for
the frosh.
This victory, coupled with the controversial 67-64 downing of Mo-

desto Junior College on Friday,
gave the Papooses their sixth suc
cessive win and their seventh con
quest of the year against a single
defeat.
Coach Dick Clegg's quintet is
fast gaining a reputation for win
ning the close tilts as they have
taken four of their seven wins by
less than five points.
Haga's game-winning bucket in
the overtime Saturday tilt fol
lowed a missed free throw by cen
ter John Caple. Caple had sunk
the first of his charity tosses to
pull the frosh within a single
point of the Oakland five.
After Haga's timely shot the
Papooses managed to tie up the
Oaklander with the ball and they
held on to the easaba until the
clock ran out after controlling the
tip.

Running up a 31-21 half-time
lead, Oakland appeared as if they
intended to hang onto the margin
as they held off the repeated ad
vances of the Papooses. In fact,
with but ten minutes remaining
in the contest, the East Bay five
still held an eight-point margin.
Paul Neumann, the guard who
has sparked the local attack all
season, re-entered the game at
this point after being sidelined
with four fouls in the first half.
Sparked by Neumann's clever
ball-handling and the driving lay
ins of captain John Pflueger, the
Papooses roared to a 44-44 tie
with four minutes left.
The two teams exchanged the
lead for the remainder of regular

play until Oakland star Harold
Theus tanked two free throws to
tie it up just before the gun.

Friday night's contest was .just
as exciting as scorers and the ref

Modesto had two more than they
were given credit for.
However, a pair of free throws
by Paul Neumann, who made six
in the last two minutes, and one
by John Caple removed any doubt
from the situation.
Center Caple was the high-scor
ing threat for the Papooses in this
encounter as he repeatedly sank
his soft jump shots. Though it
got close at times, the locals led
all the way after Dick Haga had
meshed seven of the first nine
points and the frosh had taken a
7-0 lead to open the fray.
