LEAPING HIGH TO TIP is Stanford forward Barry Brown in Sal
urday afternoon's batlte between the Cards and Oregon. Brown
kept the Tribe strong on the boards against the taller, more expe
rienced Ducks. Going up with Barry in his attempt to foil the tip
is Oregon's Charlie Franklin. Also in on tin* play are YVebfoot
center Hal Duffy (53) and Indian forward Hill Flanders (30).
Brown, a slender and speedy 6-5, has been greatly aided on the
boards by th<> new 12-foot foul lane which puts the premium on
quickness instead of size.â€”Daily photo by Frank Huntress.
