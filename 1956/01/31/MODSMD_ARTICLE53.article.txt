# SHAW'S ‘CANDIDA’
## Amusing Characters Hurl Insults, Jibes at Society 
### Richard Mende 
It is a popular form of entertainment among all classes to grant
public platforms to eccentrics and to listen to thorn sputter insults
and jibes against the whole of society those characters are amusing,
incisive and completely harmless.
"Candida" by George Bernard Shaw is now being handsomely pro-

oucect at Palo Altos (ommumty
j Center. This production is a con
vincing argument of the values of
I community theater.
Talent borrowed from Stan-
I ford's drama department includes
i the competent director Ray Fry,
I the warm and charming Doliy
j Ashley as Candida and Peter
j Frothingham as the delightfully
I mawkish curate.
Spirited Cast
i Others in the cast, obviously en-
I joying themselves, give a spirited
and entertaining performance.
So much has already been writ
ten about Shaw that one hesitates
to add to the pile; but, realizing
that so much of what has been
said was said by Shaw, one gains
courage.
To endure the test of time, a
work of art must present a view
of life which transcends the con
ventions of a period, because it
represents a truth about humani
i ty that is as enduring as humani
ty itself.
Shaw's Style
No fair person would say that
Shaw's plays are only animated
epigrams on subjects from vege
tarianism to the fate of nations,
or only theories to be expounded
by artificial characters.
But beneath the clever, .scintil
lating and dogmatic surfaces, his
characters (though often warm)
are never whole; they seem to be
attitudes and posturings of Shaw.
One senses Shaw the lovable.
Shaw the irascible, Shaw the icon
oclast, Shaw the reformer, Shaw
the romantic. Of course, one or
two characters are brought in to
show how they react to Shaw.
Characters
At best, the "characters" are
never allowed the privacy of real
human beings. There is Shaw
dropping a jibing remark here,
Shaw wagging a finger there,
Shaw sticking his head in until
you wish he would have strangled
on his shaggy beard.
None of this is to deny his
craftsmanship, of which he had
a great deal, or his cleverness, of
which he displayed too much at
the wrong times.
It is beneath the glib surfaces
that his characters are never full,
whole, real human beings, and.
lacking that quality, fail to meet
the truth required of great and
enduring art.

craftsmanship, of which he had
a great deal, or his cleverness, of
which he displayed too much at
the wrong times.
It is beneath the glib surfaces
that his characters are never full,
whole, real human beings, and.
lacking that quality, fail to meet
the truth required of great and
enduring art.
It is a popular form of entertainment among all classes to grant
public platforms to eccentrics and to listen to thorn sputter insults
and jibes against the whole of society those characters are amusing,
incisive and completely harmless.
"Candida" by George Bernard Shaw is now being handsomely pro-

oucect at Palo Altos (ommumty
j Center. This production is a con
vincing argument of the values of
I community theater.
Talent borrowed from Stan-
I ford's drama department includes
i the competent director Ray Fry,
I the warm and charming Doliy
j Ashley as Candida and Peter
j Frothingham as the delightfully
I mawkish curate.
Spirited Cast
i Others in the cast, obviously en-
I joying themselves, give a spirited
and entertaining performance.
So much has already been writ
ten about Shaw that one hesitates
to add to the pile; but, realizing
that so much of what has been
said was said by Shaw, one gains
courage.
To endure the test of time, a
work of art must present a view
of life which transcends the con
ventions of a period, because it
represents a truth about humani
i ty that is as enduring as humani
ty itself.
Shaw's Style
No fair person would say that
Shaw's plays are only animated
epigrams on subjects from vege
tarianism to the fate of nations,
or only theories to be expounded
by artificial characters.
But beneath the clever, .scintil
lating and dogmatic surfaces, his
characters (though often warm)
are never whole; they seem to be
attitudes and posturings of Shaw.
One senses Shaw the lovable.
Shaw the irascible, Shaw the icon
oclast, Shaw the reformer, Shaw
the romantic. Of course, one or
two characters are brought in to
show how they react to Shaw.
Characters
At best, the "characters" are
never allowed the privacy of real
human beings. There is Shaw
dropping a jibing remark here,
Shaw wagging a finger there,
Shaw sticking his head in until
you wish he would have strangled
on his shaggy beard.
None of this is to deny his
craftsmanship, of which he had
a great deal, or his cleverness, of
which he displayed too much at
the wrong times.
