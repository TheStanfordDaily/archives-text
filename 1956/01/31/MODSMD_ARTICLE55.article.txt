"Art reflects t"ie dominant in
fluences of its age," believes
painter Richard Bowman, whose
works will go on display today
at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Bowman's show, "Development
of a Concept," will remain on ex
hibition until February 10. It con
sists of 16 oil paintings and a
number of lithographs, which
were inspired by such subjects as
cosmic rays and photomicro
graphs of living tissue.
"Just as Christianity was the
prime factor of life from the fifth
to the sixteenth centuries, and
was reflected in art work, so sci
ence today rules our living hab
its," Bowman says.
"A creative approach to art can
be made from the new vistas of
reality given to us by modern sci
ence."
"Bowman has represented life
from a new perspective," said
Mrs. Robert Cross, associate di
rector of the Stanford Art Gal
lery. "He shows not only the
structural composition but also
the moving qualities of a seem
ingly stable object, such as a
rock."
