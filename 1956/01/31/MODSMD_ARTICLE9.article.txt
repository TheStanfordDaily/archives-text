### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 30 (UP)
â€”President Eisenhower and Brit
ish Prime Minister Sir Anthony
Eden reached "complete agree
ment" .today in an appraisal of
recent Russian tactics, particular
ly the proposed Soviet-American
friendship treaty.
Spokesmen for both sides said
that Eden publicly and privately
supported Eisenhower's weekend
reply rejecting Soviet Premier Ni
kolai Bulganin's proposal for a
20-year Russo-American treaty of
friendship.
Western leaders view the Bul
ganin proposal as a propaganda
maneuver aimed at splitting tlie
free world. They considered it
significant that lhc Russians of
fered it just in advance of the
Eisenhower-Eden talks.
The American and British
spokesmen said today's talks cov
ered a Middle East geographical
range from the Aral) states east
ward to include members of the
Baghdad Pact, the Arab-Israel
dispute and Britain's troubles
with Saudi Arabia.
Eisenhower and Eden discussed
German unification, and such
NATO-supported organizations as
the European Economic Commu
nity and the Coal and Steel Com
munity. They also talked over
what was described as present
trends toward improved unity
and integration in Western Eu
rope.
According to the British and
American spokesmen, the open
ing conferences were devoted
chiefly to a general discussion
rather than to specific proposals.
