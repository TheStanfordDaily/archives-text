-the War
Uks Over?
Sure! The fightin's stopped in
Korea . . . but the war against
death is never over! The fight
ing continues relentlessly in
homes and hospitals all over
America. And the greatest de
fense weapon of all is blood.
Yes, blood saves lives!
It is needed now by thou
sands of men, women and chil
dren for surgery and medical
treatment. It is needed, too, to
build a national reserve of
blood derivatives as "life insur
ance" for hundreds of thou
sands in time of disaster. So ...
GIVE BLOOD NOW!
