# LOCKHEED PLANS MISSILE LABS HERE
## Construction Awaits Site Annexation Company to Build Base in Sunnyvale 
### 
Plans for the construction of
the lirsl two of a ser ies of guided
missile research laboratories in
Stanford Industrial Park were re
leased yesterday by Lockheed Air
craft Corporation and the Univer
sity.
The announcement also dis
closed that Lockheed's Missile Di
vision System will establish a new
base in Sunnyvale.
Contrary to other newspaper
reports, no lease has yet been

According to University Busi
ness Manager Alt' Brandin, the
University and Lockheed have
signed a "letter of agreement"
