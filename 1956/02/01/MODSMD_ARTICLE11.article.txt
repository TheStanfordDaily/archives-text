## 
### Gerry Smith 
In a brief press conference yes
terday at Hoover Library, Finnish
Minister of Commerce and Indus
try Aarre Sim on en skillfully
avoided expressing his and Fin
land's—feelings about the recent
Russian pcace proposals to the
United States.
"Of course I hope that all dis
cussion of peace will lie prosper
ous," Simonen said. "We in Fin
land have special reasons to be
hopeful."
But, as his companion, Finnish
Ambassador Johan A. Nykopp,
put it: "Diplomats don't have

feelings. We're not smart enough
to give advice, and we like to stay
out of big-power politics."
Another member of the group
jokingly remarked, "Finland tries
to be as quiet as a mouse in a
barrel of flour," as far as inter
national politics are concerned.
Russian Relations
Finland's relations with Russia
are extremely important since
half of the country borders direct
ly on the Soviet Union. Recently
the relations have become less
tense, and Russia has returned
Porkkala, a naval base a short
distance from Helsinki, to Finnish
hands. It had been leased to Rus
j sia for use as a base, and she had
been reluctant to return it.
"This was one of the b a si c
things we wanted," Simonen said.
I"It is inside the borders and close
to the capital.
"We lost a lot of land during
the wars, but the return of Pork
kala is a different thing," he con
tinued. "It is all we can hope for
at this point."
Buying Surpluses
Simonen, who arrived in the
United States just two weeks ago,
is here to do business with the
State Department and the Depart
ment of Agriculture. He is buying
surplus products, such as tobacco,
grain and coal, for Finland.
"This should make Mr. Kenson
happy," he remarked with a
laugh, in reference to the Agricul
ture Secretary's efforts to sell
surplus farm commodities abroad.
He and Nykopp, accompanied
by Max Jacobson, press secretary
from the Finnish Embassy in i
Washington, will remain in Cali
fornia only a week.
In response to a comment about
Finland being the only nation that
has paid her World War I debt
lo the United States, Simonen
smiled proudly and said: "Yes, we
had $500 million to pay in repara
tions perhaps a record. The lasl
payment was made in 1952."
Economic Prospects
Simonen had quite a bit to say
about the future economic out
look for Finland.
The principal industry is wood
working. according to Simonen.
Finland has extensive and heavy
forests, and he feels this industry
can be doubled without apprecia-'
bly depleting the forests.
He also thinks Finland is ex j
periencing the increase of trade
which has been affecting all Eu-j
rope. "Development of foreign
trade is growing. Last year was
the largest in our history.
"Industry is also growing rap

idly—the future can be bright."
Concerning ex - President and
Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoov
er, Simonen had particular praise
for his relief work in Finland and
the funds he gave for financing
study in the United States for
Finnish students, many of whom
are at Stanford.
Opinion on Hoover
"When I was in Washington I
had the pleasure of meeting Her
bert Hoover Jr.," he concluded.
"He told me many anecdotes he
had heard from his father about
Finland.
"He said his father liked Fin
land very much. Believe me, the
feelings are mutual."
After the press conference, tho
diplomats took a tour of the cam
pus and the Stanford Research
Institute. They had lunch at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell
Hamilton, Palo Alto.
Hamilton is a retired diplomat
and former United States minis
ter to Finland.

In a brief press conference yes
terday at Hoover Library, Finnish
Minister of Commerce and Indus
try Aarre Sim on en skillfully
avoided expressing his and Fin
land's—feelings about the recent
Russian pcace proposals to the
United States.
"Of course I hope that all dis
cussion of peace will lie prosper
ous," Simonen said. "We in Fin
land have special reasons to be
hopeful."
But, as his companion, Finnish
Ambassador Johan A. Nykopp,
put it: "Diplomats don't have

feelings. We're not smart enough
to give advice, and we like to stay
out of big-power politics."
Another member of the group
jokingly remarked, "Finland tries
to be as quiet as a mouse in a
barrel of flour," as far as inter
national politics are concerned.
Russian Relations
Finland's relations with Russia
are extremely important since
half of the country borders direct
ly on the Soviet Union. Recently
the relations have become less
tense, and Russia has returned
Porkkala, a naval base a short
distance from Helsinki, to Finnish
hands. It had been leased to Rus
j sia for use as a base, and she had
been reluctant to return it.
"This was one of the b a si c
things we wanted," Simonen said.
I"It is inside the borders and close
to the capital.
"We lost a lot of land during
the wars, but the return of Pork
kala is a different thing," he con
tinued. "It is all we can hope for
at this point."
Buying Surpluses
Simonen, who arrived in the
United States just two weeks ago,
is here to do business with the
State Department and the Depart
ment of Agriculture. He is buying
surplus products, such as tobacco,
grain and coal, for Finland.
"This should make Mr. Kenson
happy," he remarked with a
laugh, in reference to the Agricul
ture Secretary's efforts to sell
surplus farm commodities abroad.
He and Nykopp, accompanied
by Max Jacobson, press secretary
from the Finnish Embassy in i
Washington, will remain in Cali
fornia only a week.
In response to a comment about
Finland being the only nation that
has paid her World War I debt
lo the United States, Simonen
smiled proudly and said: "Yes, we
had $500 million to pay in repara
tions perhaps a record. The lasl
payment was made in 1952."
Economic Prospects
Simonen had quite a bit to say
about the future economic out
look for Finland.
The principal industry is wood
working. according to Simonen.
Finland has extensive and heavy
forests, and he feels this industry
can be doubled without apprecia-'
bly depleting the forests.
He also thinks Finland is ex j
periencing the increase of trade
which has been affecting all Eu-j
rope. "Development of foreign
trade is growing. Last year was
the largest in our history.
"Industry is also growing rap

idly—the future can be bright."
