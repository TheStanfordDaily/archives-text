# 'Orphan Crew' Voted Allowance By University's Athletic Board
## Appropriation To Crew Is 40% of Budget President Sterling Made Recommendation 
### 
Stanford's "orphan crew" is an
orphan no longer.
The Athletic Board has voted
the Stanford Crew Association an
allowance of $3000 a year. The
appropriation about 40 per cent
of the crew's annual budgetâ€”had
been recommended by President
Wallace Sterling.
"This amount won't begin to
underwrite the crew's expenses or
free the crewmen from financial
worries," said Assistant to the
President Fred Glover. "It will
give them a head start, though,
and it expresses in some measure
the University's appreciation of
the i r remarkable achievements
and fine sportsmanship. We're
proud of them."
New Shell house
Last year the Indian crewmen
built a modern shellhouse at Red
wood City Yacht Harbor with
their own labor and donations
from friends. I3c~t of all. they
climaxed an outstanding rowing
season by defeating the Univer
sity of California's crew for the
first time in 38 years.
Lou Lindsey, San Francisco in
vestment counselor and volunteer
coach for the Indian oarsmen,
greeted the announcement with
mixed feelings.
"It's great to have University
support," he said, "but 1 hope no
one will get the idea that our
money troubles are over. Our
budget is around $7000 to $8000 a
year, and, although the University
is giving us all the help it can
afford, we will still need support
from friends of the crew to make
our tr ips during the season."
Coach's Expectations
Lindsey said he expects an even
better season in 1956. "The turn
out for crew has been excellent,"
he said, "and this year all we have
to do is row. Last year, remem
ber, we had to build a shellhouse
too."
Ray N. Atkinson of San Mateo,
president of the Stanford Crew
Alumni Association, echoed Lind
sey's approval of the University's
financial help.
"I'm rather glad the crew will
still have to raise some of its own
money, too," he added. "Looking
back on my own rowing days, it
seems to me our need for self
support was the thing that made
the experience so valuable from
an educational s t a n dp o in t. It
brought us together for a com
mon purpose in a way that row
ing alone might never have done."
