Crew at Stanford is a pood thing. Keeogniz
ing this, the Athletic Hoard has decided to give
the so-called "orphan crew" an aimual allow
ance of $3000.
This won't put an end to the crew's financial
problems by any means. The annual expenses
of the rowers are about $8000 and the balance
will have to be raised by the men and their
lady friends in the Crew Auxiliary.
Collegiate rowing is the cleanest of all ama
teur sports. There is no proselyting of oarsmen
and, more important, there is no professional
rowing after graduation. No major league
crew scouts hanging around offering bonuses.
At Stanford, crew is even cleaner than clean.
r ' c rowers aren't subsidized for participating

ill the sport —tliev subsidize the sport.
The Daily has always felt crew should he a
recognized sport. Our opinion, though, is tem
pered with the realization that athletics here
are faced with so many pressing needs that
there is unfortunately nothing to spare for
crew. (It is estimated that a full-scale crew
would cost approximately $40,000 annually—a
figure hased on crew expenditures at other
schools.) ,
We applaud the University's decision to help
the crew with its fiscal problems. The crew still
will have to raise more than $5000 by itself. We
hope the University's decision will not make it
more difficult for the crew to solicit the needed
funds.
