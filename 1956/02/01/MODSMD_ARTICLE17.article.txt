A loud, long-suppressed sigh of relief spread
across the nation last month when the Eisen
hower Administration came up with its first
constructive proposal aimed at the alleviation
of the farm dilemma.
As the farmer finds the pap between his in
come and cost of living widening every year and
is forced to up his production just to meet costs,
the whole American economic and social struc
ture creaks under the strain of a problem for
which no one can promise a positive solution.
The farmer has taken a double beating. Be
cause of inflation he has to pay more for what
he buys, and because of increased production
he gets less for what he sells.
Eisenhower's policy of flexible price sup
ports failed drastically to reduce the mounting
government surpluses of farm products and did
nothing to boost the farmer's income.
Under the Eisenhower flexible support sys
tem, farm income has sunk lo its lowest level
since 1912, running 26 per cent under that of
1951.
The surplus situation is no better.
According to Agriculture Secretary Benson,
"for each bushel sold, approximately one and
one-half bushels have replaced it on the stock
pile."
He admits that the Administration "has not
kept pace with the problem" of disposing of
the surpluses, while at the same time shoving
the blame oil' on the Democrats as the instiga
tors of the farm slump in the first place.
The Democrats contend that continued heavy
surpluses were caused, not by hipli price sup
ports, but rather by the Administration's fail
ure to capture available foreign markets and
unwillingness to use the surplus food for wel
fare aid at home.
Under the Eisenhower program, price sup
ports on basic crops can be reduced far below
the 90 per cent parity level. Such a reduction
has little effect on the big farmer who can still
make a profit, under reduced supports.
It is the small farmer, the man whose meth
ods are least efficient and whose production
costs are highest in relation to his income, who
will suffer the results of a decline in price
supports.
It is small wonder that the Republicans, well
aware of the repercussions their inadequate
farm policy may have on the November ballot
boxes, have made an about face and adopted
a Democratic solution lo the problem.
In his State of the Union message last month,
President Eisenhower called on the old Demo
cratic schcme of a voluntary "soil bank" by
which the government would pay the farmer
to take acreage out of production and convert
it to soil conservation purposes, such as plant
ing soil-fertilizing grasses.
The soil bank idea, initiated by Henry Wal
lace during the 1930'5, was revived last year
by Senator Hubert Humphrey, but quickly
laughed down by Benson who regarded it aÂ«
a hidden subsidy and far too expensive.
Commendations are due Eisenhower and
Benson for finally recognizing the value of the
New Deal acreage resere program.
