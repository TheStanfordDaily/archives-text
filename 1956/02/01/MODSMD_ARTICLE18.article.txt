# Columnists Analyze Background Of Ike's New Soil Bank Proposal

In the ten years since the end of World War
11, the problem of farm income and production
has assumed increasingly serious proportions.
During the seven years of Truman Adminis
tration, there was growing recognition of the
difficulties involved in keeping the supply and
demand curves where they should be to afford
the farmers a decent standard of living relative
to the rest of the country.
Hut Secretaries of Agriculture Clinton An
derson and Charles Hrannan had little success
in meeting the real problemâ€”overproduction.
Rigid parity defeated its own goal by encourag
ing high production, though it satisfied farm
ers by falsely maintaining a higher income
level.
Brannan's pet scheme, involving a more di
rect subsidy payment to farmers while keeping
market prices at even levels, was hooted down
by farm groups who objected lo such open sup
port. ,
And thus the situation facing the Eisen
hower Administration's Ezra Benson in 1953
was that of government-encouraged storage and
an increasing concentration of consolidated
farms with big-time farmers reaping profits
from the ripid parity system while the small
farmer got smaller.
The Eisenhower move toward a flexible or
"sliding" support program has met with dis
approval from the farm bloc since it has led
to a decrease in farm income by 28 per cent
since 1951.
Little noticed on the plus side of the Benson
ledger were accomplishments in increased ex
ports (which were in a tailspin when he took
over), increased consumption (partly a result
of price support adjustment) and an improved
surplus situation.
But the cold fact of decreasing income made
it apparent that a successful solution could not
be had by establishing realistic market levels
without maintaining farm income. And by
methods which would not lead to increased
production.
And thus we come to 1956 and the Eisen
hower farm message embodying his bold farm
plan, somewhat reminiscent of a New Deal
AAA measure.
The nine-point program now before the Con
gress is the biggest and most promising step that
has taken in ten years of grappling with the
thorny problem.
For it meets the problem squarely. It is de
signed at cutting production through a soil
bank or "plow under" scheme which will take
40 million farm acres out of action and add
$1 billion to farm income.
Flexible price supports will be retained and
additional stress will be laid on surplus dis
posal.
To be sure, it is not a cure-all. Only a step in
the right direction, opposite from those vote
cultivators who would lead the farm population
to believe that its future lies with a return to
high ripid parity ami fabulous incomes for the
big farmer.
Such an argument comes from those who can
not see beyond the ballot box to the snowball
ing detriment of such a plan.
