On lli« k Art of Critique
Editor, The Daily:
We were again extremely surprised af the
complete lack of taste and experience shown by
Ric Teague's article criticizing Monday night's
concert. If The Daily is going to reach and/or
maintain a place of prestige on the campus, it
ought to be more careful in selecting its staff
members.
It is, admittedly, fun to tear down or criticize
a recognized truth or an acclaimed figure. We all
have this childish urge, but it is never good to
show it unless we want to be looked upon as
crude and amateurish.
One does not criticize in this house-wrecking
manner. The more subtlety and finesse used in
criticism, the more polished it will be. If Teague
wasn't experienced enough to know this, he
might have at least avoided the heavy sarcasm
that made his article more of a burlesque than
a criticism. Sarcasm does have a place, but only
when used carefully and sparingly.
If Teague had been following the score of the
violin concerto, he would have noticed that the
"weather" was not quite as bad as he would lead
the reader to believe. Contrary to his opinion,
David Abel received what seemed to us far above
adequate support from Jorda and the orchestra.
If Teague had been listening, he would have
noticed that Jorda's "heavy baton" covered up
for Abel's understandable, but near ruinous, er
rors (i.e., several measures omitted at the con
clusion of the last movement). We feel that it is
a boon to Abel to have "unfortunately scheduled"
performances with someone who can aid him so
well on his way to becoming a truly great vio
linist.
If The Daily was opening the first round in a
verbal pie-throwing contest, we offer our hearty
congratulations on a job well done. If they were
trying to offer criticism, we suggest that they
find a more qualified staff member or educate
the one they now have in that fine art.

Editor, The Daily:
My first reaction to Ric Teague's biting criticism
of the San Francisco Symphony and Enrique
Jorda is that l ight or wrong, it showed imma
turity, irresponsibility, poor taste and downright
rudeness.
One principle of justice is that a man be tried
by his peers. If Mr. Teague had anywhere near
the same background of training and experience
in music that any professional critic has, he
might have been more justified in giving Mr.
Jorda such a broadside. Coming from a green
college student, however, his comments are just
impish impertinence.

I would be the first to admit that I don't even
have the musical knowledge to intelligently criti
cize Mr. Teague's criticism, except on the basis
of common courtesy. 1 do think, though, that a
little more consideration of courtesy would have
led Ric to temper his remarks with at least a little
discretion.
I think The Daily often forgets the fact that
with its position as a subsidized monopoly at
Stanford goes a certain responsibility for repre
senting the thought of the campus. Of course,
Daily editors have a right to express their opin
ions—in fact, as far as I know, Mr. Teague's
opinion of Monday's performance may be gener
ally shared by everyone who attended.
I know that there are people, however, who
were genuinely embarrassed at the blunt, corky
rudeness of his review, regardless of their own
appraisal of the concert. It is the way the opin
ion is expressed, rather than the opinion itself,
that I don't like to feel is representative of Stan
ford.
Suppose Herbert Hoover gave an address at
Stanford. There are undoubtedly some people
here who can hardly refer to Mr. Hoover without
the use of profanity. Yet 1 would hope that The
Daily would have enough discretion to avoid giv
ing one of these people a column on the front
page and telling him to go to it. I think this
example might well have been applied on a
smaller scale to Ric Teague's pot shots at the
San Francisco Symphony.
WALT HAYS
Editor, The Daily:
Your music editor, by terming Ravel's "La
Valse" a "weird brand of semi-classical be bop"
and a "neurotic cross between Stan Kenton and
Richard Strauss," shows that he knows as much
about modern classical music as a bricklayer in
Lower California. On top of this, he uses big
words and fancy terminology (enough to even
confuse Igor Stravinsky) to conceal his inept
ness. This makes one wonder just how founded
his attacks on the San Francisco Symphony and
its conductor really are.
The Daily would do well by getting rid of such
pseudo-intellectuals as Teague, and getting critics
who at least indicate that they know what they
are talking about.
ANDREW HAEFF
Editor's note: Reviewer Teague is not
Music Editor of The Daily (he is Managing
Editor and, incidentally, it is he who makes
staff assignments). Teague lias performed as
a professional musician and lias studied har
mony and composition. His evaluation of the
San Francisco Symphony is based oil compari
sons with symphonies he heard while in Bos
ton, Philadelphia and New York.
