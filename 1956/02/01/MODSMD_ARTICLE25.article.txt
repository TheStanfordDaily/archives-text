OH, FOR THE LIFE OF A NEWSPAPERMAN!
Look at the campus newspaper you are now holding. An ordi
nary object, you think? An everyday convenience? Something
to be taken for granted?
Faugh, sirs and madams! Faugh, I say! Don't you know
what prodigies of skill and labor and organization and art and
science go into the making of your campus newspaper?
Come, I'll show you. I'll take you to a typical office of a typical
newspaper on a typical campus.
The editor—let's call him D. Fermin Hohorquez, a typical enough
name—calls his staff together first thing in (he morning. "All
right, you guys," he says, lighting a Philip Morris, which, natu
rally, is the favorite cigarette of newspapermen, and of anybody
else who knows a hawk from a handsaw, "All right, you guys,"
says D. Fermin, "this here ain't no ladies whist society, this
here is a newspaper. So get out there and get the news. Get it
first, get it quick, get it right! Ed, you cover the ag campus.
Phil, you cover the school of mines. VVally, you cover home ec.
Sam, you cover.building*; and grounds. Ethel, you cover the
men's gym. ... All right, get going'"

With many a laugh and cheer, the reporters light up Philip
Morrises, favorite cigarette of the young and agilcs and dash
away on their assignments.
1). Fermin retires to his office to smoke a Philip Morris and
write a fearless editorial scolding the university for not buying
patches for the worn-out elbows of the chess team.
On the rim of the copy desk three rewrite men—Tensing,
Hillary, and Laverne—sit poised and expectant, waiting for the
reporters to phone in their stories. They smoke Philip Morris,
favorite cigarette of the poised and expectant. Tensing's phone
rings first; it is Ed calling from the ag campus.
"Stop the presses!" cries Ed. "Got a scoop! I Tun rath T.
Sigafoos, professor of curds and whey, has just sold his article
The Romance of Butt erf at to the Drovers and Poulterers
Monthly."
On another phone Sam is calling from buildings and grounds.
"Tear out the front page!" he cries. "Got an exclusive! Harold
Top' Wishnograd, superintendent of buildings and grounds,
today announced the purchase of a new doormat for the vestibule
of Burton Hall. The last doormat, it will be recalled, was eaten
by a pledge named Norman Harringay for his Chi Psi initiation."
Me anwhile, elsewhere in the city room, Ganglia Questover,
vivacious and ubiquitous gossip columnist, sits smoking a
Philip Morris, favorite cigarette of the vivacious and ubiquitous,
and typing out her chatty, informative tidbits: "Maureen
V algerholtz, popular Theta, announced her engagement last
night to Webster ScufT, Oliver Jenkins, Cosmo Erskine, and
Walter Penn Dowdy. Wedding dates have been set for June 9,
June 24, July 5, and July 18 respectively. Good luck, Maureen!
. . . Irving 'Behemoth' Anselm, popular fullback, blew out 120
feet of esophagus yesterday while inflating a football. Good luck,
Irving 'Behemoth'! ... Robin lvroveney, popular Deko last year,
this year popular pfc. in the U. S. Army, writes friends that he
has been convicted of deserting his post and will be executed
on April 28. Good luck, Robin!"
And now, friends, we take our reluctant leave of the drama, the
action, the tension, the glamor, the churning, tlie seething, the
roiling, the sfitrm mid drnup of the wonderful world of .journal
ism. Aloha, journalism, aloha! mm shuimnn. ir.«
