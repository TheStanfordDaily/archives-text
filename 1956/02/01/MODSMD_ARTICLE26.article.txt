Was California's eight-minute stall good basketball or just an
effort to hold the score down? This corner is of the opinion that Pete
Newell, Cal's coach, came up with a pretty good idea, even if it has
caused much adverse comment in local sports circles.
The Bears had a 10-point lead early in the game and went into
a semi-stall only to have the USFers break it up. They couldn't run
with the Dons because they would have been whipped by 30 points.
Newell figured that his Bears stood a better chance to win with only
six minutes to play than with 11, so he called the stall for eight
minutes.
Bill Russell wouldn't come out from under the basket to chal
lenge Joe Haglcr, the Bear who was holding the ball; so, the stall
was set up.
It didn't make good viewing on TV, but to the rooters at the

game, as I will attest, it was an in
teresting novelty. Russell did not
have one of his better nights; in
fact the USF team, rated No. 1 in
the nation, did not look like much
on offense all evening. But their
defense was sensational.
Except for some fouls com
mitted in the opening moments of
the game, they seemed to make
no mistakes when Cal had the
ball. When the Dons threw a full
court press at the Bears, they
never once left a man open under
the basket, or anywhere, for that
matter. It was uncanny how K. C.
Jones and Hal Perry, USF's
guards, turned the tide against
the Bears.
The California team looked
fairly good, and in guard Bernie
Simpson, Newell seems to have
found the take-charge man that
his team has needed. As one
prominent Bay Area sports writer
has put it, 'The Bears have a tend
ency to fold as soon as they get
five or si xpoints behind." Simp
son. like George Selleck, seems to
be the shortie who can shake up
the big boys and get the team

moving. Bernie started for the first time last Saturday and did a
good job.
I.it tic .Man with a Big Job
While on the subject of basketball, let's not forget Selleck. His
play this last weekend was the finest performance seen here in quite
some time. Even Oregon coach Bill Borcher grudgingly conceded
that "Of course you guys all think he |Selleck | is an All-American,
but I don't think he's quite that good. However he did break up our
zone defense in the second game with all those baskets [seven| in the
first half, and he's a great team leader."
Selleck has not been as "spectacular" this season as in past
winters, but he has been responsible for much of the Indians' suc
cess. He is really in his element as team captain for he is a natural
born leader and take-charge player.
Another Twilight Truck Meet?
Last spring the USC-Stanford track meet had to be rescheduled
l'orv> Tuesday because of rain on the regularly scheduled Saturday.
The affair was scheduled to start at 5:30 with the field events, and
the first track event, the mile run, set for 6. The Daily was skeptical,
but came away convinced. II was a very pleasant way to spend an
early evening, and since most living groups moved their dinner hour
up to 5 or 5:15, there was no conflict on that ground.
How about another twilight meet this year, Mr. Masters?

that "Of course you guys all think he |Selleck | is an All-American,
but I don't think he's quite that good. However he did break up our
zone defense in the second game with all those baskets [seven| in the
first half, and he's a great team leader."
Selleck has not been as "spectacular" this season as in past
winters, but he has been responsible for much of the Indians' suc
cess. He is really in his element as team captain for he is a natural
born leader and take-charge player.
Another Twilight Truck Meet?
Last spring the USC-Stanford track meet had to be rescheduled
l'orv> Tuesday because of rain on the regularly scheduled Saturday.
The affair was scheduled to start at 5:30 with the field events, and
the first track event, the mile run, set for 6. The Daily was skeptical,
but came away convinced. II was a very pleasant way to spend an
early evening, and since most living groups moved their dinner hour
up to 5 or 5:15, there was no conflict on that ground.
How about another twilight meet this year, Mr. Masters?

Was California's eight-minute stall good basketball or just an
effort to hold the score down? This corner is of the opinion that Pete
Newell, Cal's coach, came up with a pretty good idea, even if it has
caused much adverse comment in local sports circles.
The Bears had a 10-point lead early in the game and went into
a semi-stall only to have the USFers break it up. They couldn't run
with the Dons because they would have been whipped by 30 points.
Newell figured that his Bears stood a better chance to win with only
six minutes to play than with 11, so he called the stall for eight
minutes.
Bill Russell wouldn't come out from under the basket to chal
lenge Joe Haglcr, the Bear who was holding the ball; so, the stall
was set up.
It didn't make good viewing on TV, but to the rooters at the

game, as I will attest, it was an in
teresting novelty. Russell did not
have one of his better nights; in
fact the USF team, rated No. 1 in
the nation, did not look like much
on offense all evening. But their
defense was sensational.
Except for some fouls com
mitted in the opening moments of
the game, they seemed to make
no mistakes when Cal had the
ball. When the Dons threw a full
court press at the Bears, they
never once left a man open under
the basket, or anywhere, for that
matter. It was uncanny how K. C.
Jones and Hal Perry, USF's
guards, turned the tide against
the Bears.
The California team looked
fairly good, and in guard Bernie
Simpson, Newell seems to have
found the take-charge man that
his team has needed. As one
prominent Bay Area sports writer
has put it, 'The Bears have a tend
ency to fold as soon as they get
five or si xpoints behind." Simp
son. like George Selleck, seems to
