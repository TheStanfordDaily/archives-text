# Teams Display Mural Spirit; KA Takes 20-22 Victory
## 
### 
Kappa. Alpha II and Chi Psi I
displayed (lie true spirit of intra
mural spirts last night as the
KA's battled !o a wild 28-22 vic
tory in a loosely-played fun-for
a 11.
Marked by frequent fouls, slop
py ball-handling and little scor
ing, the game was still filled with
the exciting moments and a close
finish that often mark a hard-
Xought mural till.
KA II had easily fought their
way In a 17-7 halliime lead and it
looked as if the Chi Psi's would
never get in the game. However,
Les Hopkins, husky footballer
from the Braves, turned out to be
a ballhawk during I lie second half j
and almost succeeded in leading
his teammates to a win. Hopkins
and forward Bill Price tallied IS
of the Chi I 'si's 22 points. Price
bucketed 10, all in the second half,
and Hopkins scored eight.

Dave Do/.ier had scored six
points in the initial half as the
KA five completely outclassed
Chi Psi. Once the second stanza
began, the picture changed radi
cally. The Chi Psi's seemed to
have found an offense during the
brief intermission as they quickly
drove to two quick buckets and
several other good opportunities
when they missed easy shots.
Throughout this suddenly acti
vated attack was the hustling of
Hopkins, who raced all over the
floor, capturing the ball nearly
every time it rolled free.
Pacing the victorious KA of
fensive was guard Doby Langen
kamp, who poured in nine points
and shone as a ball-handler. Cen
ter Dave Do/ier, who was a pow
erful rebounder in the melee un
der the backboards, tallied eight
times.
