# GRADE 'B' MOVIE
## Ewell Miscast In 'Lieutenant Wore Skirts' 
### Richard Mende 
Making Ihe rounds of (he grade
B movies does practically nothing
to improve one's disposition.
But finding Tom Ewell, for
whose acting I have developed a
special fondness, cast in "The |
Lieutenant Wore Skirts" was un-j
usually depressing.
Ewell had a charming way of !
fighting temptation in the play i
"The Seven-Year Itch." His inner

conflicts mani
fested Ihe m
selves in nervous
twitches, in a se
;ries of hastily
mixed highballs,
in speculative ad
vances, followed

| by moments of uneasy rational |
| contemplation.
In spile of a reserve which is a
good deal at times like shyness, it
was unpleasant watching Ewell!
develop a psychosomatic disorder
severe enough to get him deferred
from the armed services.
There was nothing funny about |
watching him collapse from a
weak knee at the thought of being
separated from his wife (Sheree
North, and an unlikely combina
tion ).
For all his temptations and mi
nor weaknesses, Ewell's personal
charm emerged from his extraor
dinary normalcy. This is not to
j say he should be type-cast in ev
j ery part, but that 'he should por
tray characters that are not op
posed to his genial nature.
The plot has the Armed Forces
in danger of separating. Ew ell
from his wife. Sheree North,
thinking her husband's enlistment
was to be accepted, enlists in the
Women's Air Force herself.
The rest of the script is spent
devising ways to get her out of
the Air Force, especially after
Swell's neurotic behavior in try
ing to be near his wife has upset
the routine of the air base.
Toward the end of the evening
the scr ip t becomes potentially
funny when Ewell contrives to
get a Section 8- a mental dis
charge -for his wife, but the po
tentiality is never realized.
Finally, in case anyone didn't
know, it is discovered that preg
nant women cannot serve actively
and, realizing this, there seemed
never to have been a problem al
all.
No problem, that is, except why
to make movies like these.
