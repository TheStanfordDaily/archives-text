# Uses of Solar Energy Told By SRI Expert
## 
### 
If the'sun can ever bo put to
practical use, all present concepts
of energy will be altered. This
was the main point in Charles A.
Sea riot t's Tuesday Series talk last
night on "Harnessing the Sun."
Mr. Scarlott, an editor and
writer who is currently employed
by the Stanford Research Insti
tute, gave three possible ways of
using solar energy:
For heating buildings, he de
scribed a flat glass collector, com
posed of metal covered by glass,
which would retain heat. This J
heat would be discharged when
air was blown between the metal
and glass. Mr. Scarlott added!
that at present this costs 10
times as much as ordinary heat
ing methods.
Conversion to electricity, t he ]
second way, is being investigated
by electric companies, he ex
plained. Interjecting humor, as
he frequently did during the talk.
Mr. Scarlott advised the audience
to retain all stocks in electric
companies.
The third way will be to effect
a chemical change which will re
sult in an increase of plant and
animal organisms, according to
the speaker. This would result in
more food.
In a lengthy introduction to his
subject, Mr. Scarlott explained
the present sources of energy and
said why each is inadequate to
meet the demands of the United
States.
These sources include coal
which has the largest potential
but which, he warned, will be of
an inferior quality in the future.
"In 150 to 200 years we will
still probably be producing oil in
this country but it will be a mere
trickle." This was his answer to
the second largest source. Mr.
Scarlott commented that the rate
of oil discovery remains the same '
but that its use constantly in
I creases, resulting in a 15 per cent
importation of oil this year.
