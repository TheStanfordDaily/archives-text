Success is our business...
The success of our customers...the success of our
staff...that is our business.
With our financial advice and encouragement,
many businesses have reached the ranks of the
successful. Matching this progress has been the
achievement of many of our staff members who
have gained personal success...in their work and
communities.
If your major is in business administration or
liberal arts and you are interested in a successful
career, talk with our Personnel Oflicer who will be
on campus soon. Interviews may be arranged with
the Placement Office.
