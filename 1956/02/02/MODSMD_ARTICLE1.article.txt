# Electronics Firm to Get 40-Acre Site
## Lease Largest Yet In Stanford Tract 
### 
A 40-acre building site â€” the
largest yet assigned to one com
pany in the Stanford Industrial
Park will be leased by Hewlett-
Packard Company of Palo Alto,
one of the world's foremost man
ufacturers of electronic testing
and measuring equipment.
Lease negotiations have been
completed, il was announced yes
terday by William R. Hewlett,
vice-president of the firm, and Alf
E. Brandin, University business
manager. Formal signing of the
lease will take place as soon as
it has been drawn up, they said.
A previous lease for 20 acres,
signed earlier by the company,
has been cancelled. The new site
is part of a 125-acre addition to
the light industrial area which
was approved for annexation to
Palo Alto by the city council on
Jan. 23, subject to a public hear
ing to be held Feb. 20.
Lockheed Labs
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation
will ijuild two guided missile re
search laboratories on the same
tract. The company announced its
plans earlier this week.
In regard to the new Hewlett
Packard lease, Hewlett said: "We
recognized the desirability of a
larger site in the area. The lease
is part of our long-range plans
for the eventual home of Hewlett
Packard."
These plans are incomplete, but
the firm hopes to begin prelimi
nary construction within the next
12 months. Present thinking calls
for "two - story buildings which
will blend with the landscape and
suit the rolling terrain of the
site."
On Page Mill Road
Hewlett-Packard's new. lease
hold extends 1000 feet along Page-
Mill Road and just over the crest
of the first low hills visible from
El ("amino Real. It is 1500 feet in
depth and will be separated from
the Lockheed laboratories by an
extension of Hanover Street.
The first buildings will be de
signed to be "as versatile as pos
sible," Hewlett said. "Initially, at
least, they will be used for pro
duction purposes. Ultimately we
may use them for offices."
The firm has no plans for va
eating or rearranging their pres
ent facilities on the flat land in
Palo Alto, he added.
