### Jim Palmer 
Approval of the printing of a
freshman handbook was given by
ASSU Legislature last night, cul
minating a year and a half strug
gle by the Axe Society to get the
matter okayed.
Julie Olson and Dick Bolton,
handbook co-editors, presented re
vised specifications for the pam
phlet calling for 2000 copies at a
cost of $175.
The handbook will contain 16
pages and, according to the LAS*
SU motion, will be printed this
spring for distribution during the
summer to incoming frosh.
Also approved last night were
by-law changes for Publications
Board, The Daily and the Chap
paral. A method of distributing
1955 Quad profits was deter
mined.
ASSU referendum date was
moved from Feb. 14 and 15 to
Feb. 28 and 29 to allow possible
inclusion of an additional meas
ure. Following passage of the
date change, considerable debate
raged on the wording of one of
the proposed referendum meas
ures on the National Students As
sociation.
One suggested phrasing was
voted down, and the question of
whether the NSA should be sub
mitted for referendum or an opin
ion poll was left for later consid
eration.
Proposed suggestions from the
Traffic Committee were schedul
ed to be heard at next week's
meeting.

Four athletic awards were
okayed by LASSU as cross coun
try circle "S" letters went to Wil
liam R. Ferguson, Charles L.
Strong, Ralph Edwin Love Jr. and
Maury David Graves.
Bonus distribution for the 1954-
55 Stanford Daily also received
the green light. Profits from the
year will be divided and pro-rated
in a pool among the editors and
managing editors concerned.
Chuck Faulkner, chairman of
Election Board, presented a pro
posal to remove voting booths
from the Village because of diffi
culties in manning the polls there
and also alleged inequities in vot
ing convenience for Village resi
dents as opposed to on-campus
voters.
The question was automatically
tabled until the next LASSU
meeting, since it involves by-law
change.
Ed Schnieders. president of Pub
Board, presented the touchy issue
of distribution of the 1955 Quad
profts, and the Legislature passed
a motion giving the student fi
nancial manager authority to dis
tribute the profits from 1955
funds which are still in "current
account."
