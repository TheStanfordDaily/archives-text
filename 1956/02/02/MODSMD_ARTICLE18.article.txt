# Ike, Eden: Russia Adds to War Risk By Arms Shipping
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 1 (U.R)â€”
President Eisenhower and British
Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden
today accused Russia and the
Communist b1 o c of increasing
"the risk of war" by shipping
arms to the tinderbox Middle
East.
To "mitigate that risk" they
announced that American-British
French talks will be held soon to
decide what action should be tak-1
en by the three countries in the
event of further aggression either
by Israel or the Arab states.
Eisenhower and Eden made the
statement in a communique is
sued at the close of three days of
White House conferences. They
enlarged on their charges against
Russia in a separate "Declaration
of Washington."
The declaration proclaimed the
willingness of the "Big Two"
leaders to negotiate with Russia
and to "grasp any opportunity to
free mankind from the pall of
fear and insecurity which now
obscures what can and should be
a glorious future."
But during the past 10 years, it
declared bluntly, Russia has gob
bled up some 10 independent Eu
ropean countries and forced mil
lions to work for Soviet states
"against their will." During the
same time, it said, some 600 mil
lion people have been granted
"nationhood" by the West.
The "communique" declared a
settlement of the Arab-Israel dis
pute "is the most urgent need"
and will be possible "only if both
sides are willing to reconcile"
their positions.
"The action of the Soviet bloc
in regard to arms supplies to Mid
dle East countries has added to
the tensions in the area and in
creased tlie risk of war," it said.
"Our purpose is to mitigate that
risk."
