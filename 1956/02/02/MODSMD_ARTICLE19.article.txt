# Sterling Terms Campus Planning 'Guessing Game'
## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling told
a group of about 40 persons at the
Alpha Delta Phi house last night
that building new facilities on the
campus is a "kind of guessing
game."
In tlie first Stanford Today and
Tomorrow program of winter
quarter, Sterling added that "wo
will make many mistakes but
we'll make many fewer if we pro
ject it instead of letting it grow."
Speaking to Alpha Delta Phi
men and Durand women, Sterling
said that enrollment of under
graduates will not increase, al
though graduate enrollment will.
"The alumni," Sterling re
marked, "say, 'Don't let Stanford
get too large but keep it large
enough to accommodate my son
or daughter'."
Sterling said there will not be
any essential change in the ratio
of men to women. Between 1275
and 1300 freshmen enter Stanford
each year, according to Sterling,
and in the sophomore, junior and
senior years some 25 per cent
drop out "for various causes."
To compensate for this loss
Stanford accepts a number of
transfer students.
Proposed Projects
Besides future enrollment, Ster
ling mentioned proposed develop
ment projects.
To be built at some time in the
future or under the process of be
ing built are a new medical unit,
a music building, a new post of
fice, a new Stanford Union, the
fouth addition to Stern Hall, an
addition to the electronics labora
tory and a student activity center.
"The locations," Sterling re
vealed, "of these developments
will be dictated by parking space.
There will be no cross traffic, and
students will have to be satisfied
with one parking place, not ono
in Wilbur and one by the Educa
tion building and one by Physics
corner.
"There isn't any student in
?ood health who is unable to walk
to class," he said.
Finances
As far as financing improve
ments goes, Sterling said it is
cheaper to remodel than to con
struct a new building hut it is
harder to raise funds for remod
eling.
"Remodeling has no sex ap
peal," quipped Sterling. "It's hard
to get gifts for that kind of
work."
But new construction, Sterling
said, attracts gifts. Half the mon
ey for Moore Hall came from
gifts and all the money for Wil
bur came from the University's
endowment.
Concerning the new Medical
School, Sterling said "it will take
59.500 million to be in business
sufficiently to make a move."
$2 Millions
The University has received
over $2 million for the new Medi
cal School and hopes to obtain
more from such sources as the
Ford Foundation.
"In these last few years," con
fided the president, "a lot of us
have put in a lot of hours shak
ing hands with donors. I grew up
milking cows and lately I have
been shaking hands with million
aires hoping a few millions will
shake off."
In the question-and-answer pe
riod. Sterling was asked what
would become of some of the
more antiquated fraternity
houses and women's living
groups.
"Russell House is right on the
line where the peripheral road is
going through," he declared.
