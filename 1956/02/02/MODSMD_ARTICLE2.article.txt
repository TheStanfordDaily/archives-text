## 
### 
SALEM. Ore., Fob. 1 (U.R)
Elmo Smith. 46-year-old eastern
Oregon publisher, was sworn in
as governor of Oregon today, less
than 12 hours after he was cata
pulted into the .state's political
spotlight by the sudden death of
Gov. Paul L. Patterson of a heart
attack.
Smith, still stunner! by the loss
of his close personal friend, as
sumed the post of chief executive
as other Oregon Republican lead
ers were thrown into turmoil by
the loss of their principal vote
getter.
Patterson was considered the
OOP's top candidate in its battle
to oust Democratic Sen. Wayne
Morse from the U. S. Senate and
replace him with a senator de
voted to the principles of Presi
dent Eisenhower.
Smith is one of the youngest
men ever to assume the office of
chief executive in Oregon. He will
serve until next January, when
the state legislature will inaugu
rate an elected governor.
