### Dave Scott 
J.)o you think the government of George
Fialj»li has lived up to its campaign promises
ami expectations?
Here's what some students think:
Dick IjCwis, '56, Phi Sigma Kappa: "I don't
think anyone who was using rational thought
expected George Ralph's government to live up
to its campaign promises."
John F ale hi, '57, Toy on. EI C.apitan: "In my
opinion the revolution of last spring has
branched oft into first a maze and then a vac
uum. That is, the great Ralph tradition has
moved first in the direction of a Cuhherley And
debate on our maze of activities and then in
the direction of an inter-club investigation of
Stanford thought.
"But more vivid proof of the fact that the
Ralph administration has lived up to expec
tations can he found in the legislative minutes
on the elimination of patrons at social gather
ings, in the appointment of a committee to end
all committees and in the impending debate
on NSA.
"Is it not true, then, that expectations have
been fulfilled? On the other hand it is also
true that not all expectations were verv high."
Dale Harris, '58. Alpha Sigma Phi: "No
government is best government': he certainlv
had no government, although he lias not done
away with any 'useless committees'."
Paul Draper, 58, Breakers: "In campaign
ing, George Ralph made promises that were
beyond the power of the president to fulfill.
A number of these promises were based on a

lack of knowledge of the student government
setup. Many students realized this and still
voted for Ralph."
Susanna Soliysik, '58, Lagunita: "I expected
something and have seen nothing. I expected
to see something constructive done to the Leg
islature. They just sit around and discuss mi
nute points without accomplishing anything.
"lie planned to scale down committees and
make it easier for students to participate on
committees. I don't think lie has done this.
The basis of his platform revolved around free
ing the student from government and making
it voluntary. I don't tliink he has fulfilled this
promise."
Stew Weitzman, '57. Phi Gamma l)<'lta: '"I
feel that the present student government has,
iu part, succeeded in its campaign aims. Gov
ernment has been de-emphasized to the extent
that students are not as conscious of committee
activity as they were in the past. There ap
pears to he less pressure on students to become
active in governmental affairs."
John Sturgeon, '57. Alpha Sigma Phi: "1
have become totally disinterested iu ASSU gov
ernment because it has become more compli
cated. petty and cumbersome, even with the
coming of George Ralph."
Sylvia Tail, '57, Lagunila: "Yes, his plan
was not to bother the students with a lot of
activities in connection with student govern
ment and he has accomplished that. Every
thing seems to be running just as well without
all those extra-curricular activities we used to
have."

W hat do OU think?
J.)o you think the government of George
Fialj»li has lived up to its campaign promises
ami expectations?
Here's what some students think:
Dick IjCwis, '56, Phi Sigma Kappa: "I don't
think anyone who was using rational thought
expected George Ralph's government to live up
to its campaign promises."
John F ale hi, '57, Toy on. EI C.apitan: "In my
opinion the revolution of last spring has
branched oft into first a maze and then a vac
uum. That is, the great Ralph tradition has
moved first in the direction of a Cuhherley And
debate on our maze of activities and then in
the direction of an inter-club investigation of
Stanford thought.
"But more vivid proof of the fact that the
Ralph administration has lived up to expec
tations can he found in the legislative minutes
on the elimination of patrons at social gather
ings, in the appointment of a committee to end
all committees and in the impending debate
on NSA.
"Is it not true, then, that expectations have
been fulfilled? On the other hand it is also
true that not all expectations were verv high."
Dale Harris, '58. Alpha Sigma Phi: "No
government is best government': he certainlv
had no government, although he lias not done
away with any 'useless committees'."
Paul Draper, 58, Breakers: "In campaign
ing, George Ralph made promises that were
beyond the power of the president to fulfill.
A number of these promises were based on a

lack of knowledge of the student government
setup. Many students realized this and still
voted for Ralph."
