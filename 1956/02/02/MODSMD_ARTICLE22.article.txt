The Campus Eyesore
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University has one of the most un
usual campuses in the state, with its Spanish
type architecture, but it has one of the worst
possible eyesores in the form of the "temporary"
buildings behind the library. They need a coat of
paint, or else complete elimination from the cam
pus scene.
T fully realize that they are needed for class
rooms, as the University just hasn't the class
rooms available to kcepVip with its phenomenal
growth in the, past 10 years. As such, the build
ings are necessary. Since they are with us, and
there is no indication that in the near future the
University will no longer have need of them, it
would be a wise idea to at least make them less
of an eyesore than they are at present.
It would seem that for about $20 worth of
sand brown and tile red paint, plus two days
with a crew of three men. the things could be
blended into the present campus to such a degree
thai it would be necessary to get right on top of
them before it was realized that they weren't
of the same construction as the rest of the build
ings on the campus.
I think that the Army has a good point, when

teaching soldiers to camouflage themselves and
their equipment: the blending in with the decor
of the surroundings renders him less likely to
detection. Why, when it would cost so little in
time and money, doesn't somebody take this into
account and hide those buildings?
The present paint job is entirely inadequate,
what with an off-khaki color, repaired in numer
ous spots with an off-white and orange and
topped with a bright silver roof. It is entirely
conceivable that a good paint job would help pre
pare our fair campus for the influx of high-school
seniors who will come here in the spring to look
over the physical assets of this campus with a
view to registering here in the fall. So how about
it, University, is it worth it?

Editor's note: S. F. Post, University assist
ant business manager, has this to say about the
problem:
"Our funds are always limited. We want to
spend them where work is of the most endur
ing character. The temporary buildings have
lx*en earmarked for tearing down for some
time |no definite date has been set|. It would
probably cost $2000 to $3000 to paint them."
