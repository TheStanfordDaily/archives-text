# Watkins Tells Advantages Of European Guided Tours
## Travel Helps Give Appreciation of Our Western Heritage 
### Barbara Nichols 
"There is nothing like travel or
residence abroad to tea c h us
about our own country. To see it
from the vantage point of Europe
and Asia is to see it in perspec
tive and to see things about it we
never noticed before."
Professor James Watkins, head
of Stanford's Political Science De
partment. said this when he was
asked what the advantages of a
European tour are for a Stanford
student.
"One function of a liberal edu
cation is to familiarize the stu
dent with his heritage in Western
Civilization. Many of our most
precious traditions go back to Eu
rope. Monuments, works of art
and scenes of famous events of
history are in Europe," he said.
"A trip to Europe helps bring
all these things alive. One sight is
worth a thousand pages of de
scription."
.Man's Heritage
Watkins said foreign travel
would help students appreciate
more fully how much other peo
ples have to contribute to man's'
common heritage.
He said that a tour would help
Americans appreciate the im
mense diversity of Europeans and
make them more aware of the
great problems Europeans have
to face. It would make Ameri
cans more patient with the efforts
of Europeans to meet these prob
lems.
He feels that Americans would
become slower to criticize and to
think that there is always only an
American answer to a European
problem.
Professor and Mrs. Watkins
took a tour to Europe in the sum
mer- of 1954. It was the lIR tour
for Stanford.
When asked why a busy profes
sor was willing to take time out
to spend the summer guiding a
tour, Watkins said it is difficult
for a professor to have close con
tact with students during a school
year. A tour- provides almost
three months of uninterrupted
contact.
Practical Value
As a professor of International
Relations, Watkins said he recog
nizes the practical value of travel
in Europe. He feels that associa
tion with a professor in such a
glorified "field trip" help s to
deepen students' understanding
of contemporary problems.
His final reason was that, as a
teacher, he is interested in ihe
liberal education of Stanford stu
dents and he is willing to help in
that part of education which first-

European Traveler
hand experience in Europe can
bring;
This year Professor and Mrs. j
Watkins will take another- tour to
Europe. Mrs. Watkins went alone i
last year because an injury to j
Watkins' leg during the 1954 tour
took more than a year to heal.
Watkins' Youth
After spending his undergrad-1
uate years at Stanford, Professor !
Watkins went to Japan, where he
taught in a Buddhist high school, j
He then went on to China, where :
he taught in a Christian univer-1
.sity.
Watkins has done graduate)
work at Stanford and in Switzer- 1
land and has received three de
grees in Political Science from
Stanford. He has been Chairman
of Stanford's Political Science De
partment since 1951.
