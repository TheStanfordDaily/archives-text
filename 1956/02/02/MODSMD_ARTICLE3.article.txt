###

Trueblood left Stanford in 1945 to become professor of philosophy
it Earlham College in Richmond, Ind.

chatter! with reporters.
Wiih a sly glance at his succes
sor, present Chaplain Robert E.
Minto, thi* former chaplain asked,
'Do you want me to say Earlham
n a Scottish way? This is the
word we test them on. If a man
las the least bit of Scottish blood
n him, he'll pronounce it Earrrrl
lam."
"Voice of America"
In 1934, the humorist-minister
ook a leave of absence from
Earlham and accepted the posi
ion of chief of religious informa
ion for Voice of America in
Washington.
"We all see the importance of
his work now," declared Dr.
Frueblood, "because we see that
we don't have peace and arc not
ikely to have war. So the real
struggle is an ideological one."
Trueblood admitted the United
States does not put as much mon
ey into this struggle as does Rus
sia. However, the Voice of Amer
ca spends twice as much money
>n religion as on any other sub
ject.
"This," said the chief of re
igious information, "is because
>112 the conviction of many, led by
lie President, that democracy is
meaningless apart from religion.
Equality
'Tor example, equality of men
loes.not make sense as a secular
•oncept but it does as a religious
concept.
"The Declaration of Independ
ence does not say 'all men are
equal' but says 'all men are cre
ited equal'."
As a result of his duties in the
Voice of America, Trueblood
wrote one of his three books,
"Declaration of Freedom." This
book was published last May.
Trueblood revealed, "This book
was used in foreign libraries, both
translated and in English."
As well as libraries, the former

through four other media for the
Voice of America, namely, press,
movies, exhibits and radio broad
casting.
Resume Duties
Retiring from government serv
ice. Trueblood will resume his du
ties at Earlham in September.
Between now and September

Dr. Trueblood will be working on
a hook about the philosophy of
religion.
"The philosophy of religion is
my life work and has been for 25
years," Trueblood said.
Asked when he decided upon
his life's work, Trueblood replied,
"I got out of college before I
knew what I was going to do, of
which I wholly approve. Young
men shouldn't worry if Ihey
haven't decided what to do when
they get out of college."
No Decision
In college, he couldn't decide
whether to be a professor, min
ister or author.
"So," said Trueblood, "I decided
to be all three."
In fact, at Earlham, Trueblood
spends only one semester a year
teaching. The rest of the time, he
writes, gives speeches to colleges
and universities, businesses and
church groups, and leads the
Yokefellows Movement, which he
founded.
"The purpose of this move
ment," said the author-speaker
minister, "is to cultivate new life
on the part of those active, dedi
cated, thoughtful Christians, who
are not clergy. Yokefellows is an
other word for laity."
Yokefellows Movement
Summing up the Yokefellows
Movement, Dr. Trueblood in
toned, and spec
tat orship are antitheses. You can
not be a spectator in religion."
Besides his work in Yokefellow
ship, the former Stanford chap
lain does a lot of public speaking.
He has spoken at 160 colleges.
As far as the immediate future
goes, Trueblood will remain in
this area until Feb. 13. He will
preach on the Yokefellowship
Movement in Memorial Church
this Sunday.
Today at noon in the "Y" of
fice, he will speak to the "Y" re
ligious discussion group.

Minto, thi* former chaplain asked,
'Do you want me to say Earlham

word we test them on. If a man

lam."
"Voice of America"
In 1934, the humorist-minister
ook a leave of absence from
Earlham and accepted the posi
ion of chief of religious informa
ion for Voice of America in
Washington.
"We all see the importance of
his work now," declared Dr.
Frueblood, "because we see that
we don't have peace and arc not
ikely to have war. So the real
struggle is an ideological one."
Trueblood admitted the United
States does not put as much mon
ey into this struggle as does Rus
sia. However, the Voice of Amer
ca spends twice as much money
>n religion as on any other sub
ject.
"This," said the chief of re
igious information, "is because

lie President, that democracy is
meaningless apart from religion.

concept.
"The Declaration of Independ
ence does not say 'all men are
equal' but says 'all men are cre

As a result of his duties in the
Voice of America, Trueblood
wrote one of his three books,
"Declaration of Freedom." This
book was published last May.
Trueblood revealed, "This book
was used in foreign libraries, both
translated and in English."

Resume Duties
Retiring from government serv
ice. Trueblood will resume his du
ties at Earlham in September.
Between now and September

Dr. Trueblood will be working on
a hook about the philosophy of
religion.
"The philosophy of religion is
my life work and has been for 25
years," Trueblood said.
Asked when he decided upon
his life's work, Trueblood replied,
"I got out of college before I
knew what I was going to do, of
which I wholly approve. Young
men shouldn't worry if Ihey
haven't decided what to do when
they get out of college."
No Decision
In college, he couldn't decide
whether to be a professor, min
ister or author.
"So," said Trueblood, "I decided
to be all three."
In fact, at Earlham, Trueblood
spends only one semester a year
teaching. The rest of the time, he
writes, gives speeches to colleges
and universities, businesses and
church groups, and leads the
Yokefellows Movement, which he
founded.
"The purpose of this move
ment," said the author-speaker
minister, "is to cultivate new life
on the part of those active, dedi
cated, thoughtful Christians, who
are not clergy. Yokefellows is an
other word for laity."
Yokefellows Movement
Summing up the Yokefellows
Movement, Dr. Trueblood in
toned, and spec

not be a spectator in religion."
Besides his work in Yokefellow
ship, the former Stanford chap
lain does a lot of public speaking.
He has spoken at 160 colleges.
As far as the immediate future
goes, Trueblood will remain in
this area until Feb. 13. He will
preach on the Yokefellowship
Movement in Memorial Church
this Sunday.
Today at noon in the "Y" of

Dr. Elton Trueblood, Stanford chaplain from 1936 to 1945, returned
o campus for a three-week visit yesterday.
Trueblood left Stanford in 1945 to become professor of philosophy
it Earlham College in Richmond, Ind.
In his first press conference since his return, Trueblood joked and

chatter! with reporters.
Wiih a sly glance at his succes
sor, present Chaplain Robert E.
Minto, thi* former chaplain asked,
'Do you want me to say Earlham
n a Scottish way? This is the
word we test them on. If a man
las the least bit of Scottish blood
n him, he'll pronounce it Earrrrl
lam."
"Voice of America"
In 1934, the humorist-minister
ook a leave of absence from
Earlham and accepted the posi
ion of chief of religious informa
ion for Voice of America in
Washington.
"We all see the importance of
his work now," declared Dr.
Frueblood, "because we see that
we don't have peace and arc not
ikely to have war. So the real
struggle is an ideological one."
Trueblood admitted the United
States does not put as much mon
ey into this struggle as does Rus
sia. However, the Voice of Amer
ca spends twice as much money
>n religion as on any other sub
ject.
"This," said the chief of re
igious information, "is because
>112 the conviction of many, led by
lie President, that democracy is
meaningless apart from religion.
Equality
'Tor example, equality of men
loes.not make sense as a secular
•oncept but it does as a religious
concept.
"The Declaration of Independ
ence does not say 'all men are
equal' but says 'all men are cre
ited equal'."
As a result of his duties in the
Voice of America, Trueblood
wrote one of his three books,
"Declaration of Freedom." This
book was published last May.
Trueblood revealed, "This book
was used in foreign libraries, both
translated and in English."
As well as libraries, the former
S t a n for d chaplain w orke d
through four other media for the
Voice of America, namely, press,
movies, exhibits and radio broad
casting.
Resume Duties
Retiring from government serv
ice. Trueblood will resume his du
ties at Earlham in September.
Between now and September

Dr. Trueblood will be working on
a hook about the philosophy of
religion.
"The philosophy of religion is
my life work and has been for 25
years," Trueblood said.
Asked when he decided upon
his life's work, Trueblood replied,
"I got out of college before I
knew what I was going to do, of
which I wholly approve. Young
men shouldn't worry if Ihey
haven't decided what to do when
they get out of college."
No Decision
In college, he couldn't decide
whether to be a professor, min
ister or author.
"So," said Trueblood, "I decided
to be all three."
In fact, at Earlham, Trueblood
spends only one semester a year
teaching. The rest of the time, he
writes, gives speeches to colleges
and universities, businesses and
church groups, and leads the
Yokefellows Movement, which he
founded.
"The purpose of this move
ment," said the author-speaker
minister, "is to cultivate new life
on the part of those active, dedi
cated, thoughtful Christians, who
are not clergy. Yokefellows is an
other word for laity."
Yokefellows Movement
Summing up the Yokefellows
Movement, Dr. Trueblood in
toned, and spec
tat orship are antitheses. You can
not be a spectator in religion."
Besides his work in Yokefellow
ship, the former Stanford chap
lain does a lot of public speaking.
He has spoken at 160 colleges.
As far as the immediate future
goes, Trueblood will remain in
this area until Feb. 13. He will
preach on the Yokefellowship
Movement in Memorial Church
this Sunday.
Today at noon in the "Y" of
fice, he will speak to the "Y" re
ligious discussion group.
