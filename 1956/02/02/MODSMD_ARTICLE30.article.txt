# What young people are doing at General Electric
## Young scientist works on new ways to improve metals 
### 
Today scientists and engineers face one of
the toughest barriers of all — the "metal
barrier." Modern technology has progressed
so rapidly that today's metals can t meet the
tremendous demands placed upon them. For
such fields as aviation, electronics, atomic
energy, present metals must he improved and
new kinds of materials must be developed.
One of the young men playing a role in
this new and important field is 30-year-old
Dr. Roland P. Carreker, Jr.
Carreker's Work Interesting, Vital
As a research associate in the General Flec
tric Research Laboratory's Metals and
Ceramics facility, Carreker's chief concern
is the improvement of metals through new
processing techniques.
In his work, Or. Carreker has dealt with
such important metallurgical problems as
metal failure in high-speed turbine rotors,
determining the strength of pure metals
from —125 F. the temperature of liquid
hydrogen, to 2.o00 F and economic studies
of new metallurgical processes.
25,000 College Graduates at General Electric
When Carreker came to General Flectric in
1947, he already knew the work he wanted
to do. Like each of our 25.000 college
graduate employees, he is given a chance to
grow and realize his full potential, lor Gen
eral Flectric has long believed this: When
fresh young minds are given freedom to
make progress, everybody benefits — the in
dividual. the company, and the country.
