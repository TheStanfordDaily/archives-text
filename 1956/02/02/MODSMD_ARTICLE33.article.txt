WORLD CHAMPION figure skater Teuley Albriglit is favored to
capture the women's Olympic title today as she competes in the
free skating phase. Miss Albright built up a large lead in the
compulsory figures Monday and Tuesday. She has been hampered
in practice by an injured ankle which she cut during pre-Olympic
practice. Should Miss Albright win the women's event, it would
give the United States a clean sweep in figure skating.
