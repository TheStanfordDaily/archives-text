# Jenkins Wins Skating Title For America
## Miss Albright Leads Women's Competition 
### 
CORTINA. Italy. Feb. 1 (U.R)-
Hayes Alan Jenkins, 22-year-old
tigure skating marvel, won the
United Slates its first gold medal
in the 1936 Winter Olympic games
today by leading a 1-2-3 sweep
which ended the point famine that
has plagued the Americans in this
classic.
Young Ronnie Robertson of
Long Beach. Calif., flashier than
Jenkins in the free figures, placed
second, and David Jenkins, 19-
year-old brother of Hayes Alan,
was third.
That gave the Americans a 19-
point harvest, but because of the
meager 9 points compiled in
previous events, they climbed
only from ninth to seventh place
in the unofficial team standings-—
Uil 1 v: points behind the leading
Russians.
Robertson, only IS, won the
crowd's favor with the dash and
originality of his free skating
maneuvers.
Jenkins had piled up such a
sizeable lead in the compulsory
figures which started the compe
tition on Sunday that Robertson
was unable to overtake him.
The five compulsory figures
count 60 per cent of ihe figure
skating championship; the free
figures, at which Robertson ex
cels, comprise only 40 per cent of
the competition.
"This is the day I have been
waiting for ever since I started
skating," said slender Jenkins, a
pre-law student at Colorado Col
lege. He plans to retire from com
petition after this winter to con
centrate on his studies.
The United States appears a
cinch to gain at least the first two
places in the women's figure skat
ing competition, which concludes
tomorrow. Tenley Albright rank
ed first and Carol Heiss second
after the compulsory phase of the
event.
