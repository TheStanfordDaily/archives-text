# Undergrads May Be Admitted To Foreign Summer Schools
## 
### Wally Simpson 
Many students have been inter
ested in the possibilities of study
ing abroad. Some have thought
about it but have stopped there
because of not knowing where to
seek further information.
Foreign universities are consid
ered mainly as "g radu a t e"
schools. Many are specialized
schools. There are no general ed
ucation programs like those re
quired oi undergraduates by most
universities in Ihe United States.
This fa c t does not prevent
American undergraduates as well
as graduates from attending
them.
If the American undergraduate
has two or three years of train
ing at a university here, and if
no has a good grade-point aver
age, he can reasonably expect to
be admitted into the foreign uni
versity as a regular student. A
qualifying examination may be
required.
Undergraduates
Any undergraduate may bo ad
mitted as an auditor with possi
bilities of taking some examina
tions at the end of a course. These
may not be the same as those
given to regular students and
would probably not result in a
formal diploma.
Summer schools are scheduled
by most universities in France,
Switzerland, Italy, Germany,
Mexico and Central and South
America. Courses listed in these
universities give the undergradu
ate an opportunity to learn a for
eign language and something
about the culture of the particu
lar country or language group.
Summer school courses last
about three months and are open
to any American student upon ap
plication. Some universities also
opeiate language schools during
the l'egular academic year.

Tuition for university work and
for summer school is usually low
because most foreign universities
are government-subsidized institu
tions.
Transference of credit to Amer
ican universities differs with each
university.
Opportunities for Americans to
earn money while abroad travel
ing or studying-are usually limit
ed, since many foreign govern
ments prohibit alien employment.
Scholarships are available, but
usually for graduate students
only.
Students may travel abroad
through sightseeing tours, study
tours or alone.
Transportation
Luxury ocean and air liners as
well as reasonably priced student
ships are available for transpor
tation to foreign lands.
The Stanford Overseas Infor
mation Service, a branch of the
Institute of International Rela
tions, is presenting a display in
Ihe Main Library covering study
and travel possibilities abroad.
Further information about
studying and traveling abroad
may be had by contacting SOIS
at the lIR shack between 4 and G
p.m., Monday through Thursday.
Catalogues, pamphlets and other
information are available there,
according to SOIS director Her
bert Hymans.

universities in Ihe United States.
This fa c t does not prevent
American undergraduates as well
as graduates from attending
them.
If the American undergraduate
has two or three years of train
ing at a university here, and if
no has a good grade-point aver
age, he can reasonably expect to
be admitted into the foreign uni
versity as a regular student. A
qualifying examination may be
required.
Undergraduates
Any undergraduate may bo ad
mitted as an auditor with possi
bilities of taking some examina
tions at the end of a course. These
may not be the same as those
given to regular students and
would probably not result in a
formal diploma.
Summer schools are scheduled
by most universities in France,
Switzerland, Italy, Germany,
Mexico and Central and South
America. Courses listed in these
universities give the undergradu
ate an opportunity to learn a for
eign language and something
about the culture of the particu
lar country or language group.
Summer school courses last
about three months and are open
to any American student upon ap
plication. Some universities also
opeiate language schools during
the l'egular academic year.

Tuition for university work and
for summer school is usually low
because most foreign universities
are government-subsidized institu
tions.
Transference of credit to Amer
ican universities differs with each
university.
Opportunities for Americans to
earn money while abroad travel
ing or studying-are usually limit
ed, since many foreign govern
ments prohibit alien employment.
Scholarships are available, but
usually for graduate students
only.
Students may travel abroad
through sightseeing tours, study
tours or alone.
Transportation
Luxury ocean and air liners as
well as reasonably priced student
ships are available for transpor
tation to foreign lands.
The Stanford Overseas Infor
mation Service, a branch of the
Institute of International Rela
tions, is presenting a display in
Ihe Main Library covering study
and travel possibilities abroad.
Further information about
studying and traveling abroad
may be had by contacting SOIS
at the lIR shack between 4 and G
p.m., Monday through Thursday.
Catalogues, pamphlets and other
information are available there,
according to SOIS director Her
bert Hymans.
Many students have been inter
ested in the possibilities of study
ing abroad. Some have thought
about it but have stopped there
because of not knowing where to
seek further information.
Foreign universities are consid
ered mainly as "g radu a t e"
schools. Many are specialized
schools. There are no general ed
ucation programs like those re
quired oi undergraduates by most
universities in Ihe United States.
