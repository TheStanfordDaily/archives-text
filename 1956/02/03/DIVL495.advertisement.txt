KEPLER'S KWIK KOURSE No. 4
. . . tor Faculty Members Only.
Subject: The ordering of books (paper-bound J , so that they will be
available at the beginning of each quarler.
The Need tor This Kourse:
Many professors have brought book ordering to a fine art. F«r
example, Professor Y recommends a book to a class of 200 students.
The class, next day, reports only 13 copies available inside the state.
That night Professor Y calls his book dealer. . . .
Hence, Kepler's Kwik Kourse No. 4
Kepler will be overjoyed (what witii the growing number of little
Keplers ) to supply book;, for class needs. For good service he makes
this assignment:
1. Anticipate your needs; order in advance.
2. If you want the paperbacks of the major publishers—Anchor, Vin
tage, Dover, Harvest, etc. —give two to three weeks' advance notice.
3. If you are selecting from the mass-published pocket books—Pocket
Books, Signet, Bantam, etc.- —give four to six weeks' notice. The wheels
of The Wheels grind slowly. ...
4. Don't hesitate to tell Kepler about books you are recommending
rather than requiring, or that you are ordering through the Stanford
Bookstore. He'll take his chances on being in oversupply.
5. When recommending text editions lone-half discount), remember
that dealers simply cannot afford tu stock such booKs "and so advance
bulk ordejj are manda-tory. This applies to the Crolts Classics, Rinehart
Editions, Amherst Series, etc.
Kepler is clairvoyant, omniscient and ineffable, but he cannot out
guess you. When he stocks The Wall, you recommend Buddenbrooks.
When he is knee-deep in Freud's Introduction to Psychoanalysis, you
require a reading of Moliere's Tartuffe.
1 o do a better job, therefore, Kepler needs more of your help to
the end that students can find more books at the beginning, rather
than at the middle, of a quarter. k

Many professors have brought book ordering to a fine art. F«r
example, Professor Y recommends a book to a class of 200 students.
The class, next day, reports only 13 copies available inside the state.
That night Professor Y calls his book dealer. . . .
Hence, Kepler's Kwik Kourse No. 4
Kepler will be overjoyed (what witii the growing number of little
Keplers ) to supply book;, for class needs. For good service he makes
this assignment:
1. Anticipate your needs; order in advance.
2. If you want the paperbacks of the major publishers—Anchor, Vin
tage, Dover, Harvest, etc. —give two to three weeks' advance notice.
3. If you are selecting from the mass-published pocket books—Pocket
Books, Signet, Bantam, etc.- —give four to six weeks' notice. The wheels
of The Wheels grind slowly. ...
4. Don't hesitate to tell Kepler about books you are recommending
rather than requiring, or that you are ordering through the Stanford
Bookstore. He'll take his chances on being in oversupply.
5. When recommending text editions lone-half discount), remember
that dealers simply cannot afford tu stock such booKs "and so advance
bulk ordejj are manda-tory. This applies to the Crolts Classics, Rinehart
Editions, Amherst Series, etc.
Kepler is clairvoyant, omniscient and ineffable, but he cannot out
guess you. When he stocks The Wall, you recommend Buddenbrooks.
When he is knee-deep in Freud's Introduction to Psychoanalysis, you
require a reading of Moliere's Tartuffe.
1 o do a better job, therefore, Kepler needs more of your help to
the end that students can find more books at the beginning, rather
than at the middle, of a quarter. k
