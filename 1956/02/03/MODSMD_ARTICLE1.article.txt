# Ike Receives Second Note From USSR
## Bulganin Repeats Plea For Friendship Pact 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (U.R)â€”
Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin,
blaming the United States for
world tensions, tonight repeated
his proposal for a 20-year friend
ship treaty between the United
States and Russia.
In a new letter to President
Eisenhower, the Soviet premier
said that such a treaty "would
contribute to the improvement of
relations between your friends
and ours in the international
field."
"We can only regret that our
proposal did not have a more fa
vorable reception on the part of
Your Excellency," Bulganin said.
He referred to Mr. Eisenhower's
firm but polite rejection of his
original proposal made Jan. 25.
Bulganin also said Russia is
willing to conclude similar trea
ties of friendship with other na
tions, including Great Britain and
France.
Reaction
Immediate reaction in some of
ficial quarters was that Bulganin
had failed to reply to Mr. Eisen
hower's specific proposals to ease
East-West tensions.
The President had asked Bul
ganin how a two-way treaty could
be a cure for tensions which the
UN charter had not cured. Per
sons who had road the note quick
ly said Bulganin had given "no
answer" to these questions.
The Stat e Department itself
had no official reaction or com
ment on the new Bulganin letter.
Stands By Proposal
Bulganin, whose letter was de
livered through normal diplomat
ic channels, also said Russia still
stands by its proposal that the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion and the Communist Warsaw
Treaty Group conclude a treaty.
He contended Russia already
has taken "steps designed to relax
international tension and streng
then confidence among states."
But ho said the Western powers
have increased their military
spending. In addition, he said, the
United States has added new for
eign military bases, many located
on the borders of Russia.
The Soviet premier turned
thumbs down on Mr. Eisenhow
er's "open skies" proposal for ex
changing military blueprints and
aerial inspection, repeating the
Communist argument that this
"would intensify" the fear of war.
