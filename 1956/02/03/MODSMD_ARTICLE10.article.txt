# STEVENSON:
## Gas Bill Won't Cause Demo Party Rift 
### Wally Simpson 
The natural gas bill under de
bate before Congress will not, ac
cording to Presidential candidate
Adlai Stevenson, cause a rift in
the Democratic party.
Appearing at a press confer
ence in the Terrace Room of the
Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco
yesterday, Stevenson said, of his
party, "We've survived greater
disharmonies than those."
As far as his own views on the
proposed bill are concerned, Ste
venson made it plain that he is
against the bill in its present
form.
He said: "It is imperative to
regulate the price of natural gas
in the well-head as well as the
dispensing end. The present bill
is not adequate enough regula
tion."
Agriculture
"Agriculture," said Stevenson
in reference to the farm situa
tion, "is a problem of surpluses
and control. In 2D years there will
be 40 to 50 million more people
to feed. It's quite possible that the
problem of surpluses may be just
a passing problem."
The Democratic hopeful deftly
sidestepped a charge that he has
a lot of bosses running his Cali
fornia campaign. He said he'd
been in California two nights and
was very pleased with the warm
reception he'd received here.
Commented Stevenson: "I had
a bean supper with 1.100 in Sacra
mento. I suppose they wore all
bosses. Last night I had a box
supper in Oakland with 3000. I
guess most of them were bosses,
too."
Campaign
Tn reference to his California
campaign, Stevenson said his pol
icy is to give his views on national
issues that should conccrn the
voters, rather than attack Presi
dent Eisenhower. "Of course," he
remarked, "1 am againsl Ihe Re
publican Administration."
Stevenson asserted quite em
phatically that his primary con
ccrn was the welfare of the Dem
ocratic party, not a political con
test with Senator Kefauver. "Aft
er the party, then the particular
candidates," he remarked.
Commenting on a political poll
conducted in California which in
dicated that California will be the |
key state in a closely split nation,
Stevenson said that "maybe the
best comment is, 'I've come to
California'."
AI lOase
The presidential candidate was;
dressed in a conservative light
gray hard - finished flannel suit j
and appeared quite at ease. On
one occasion during the pre-con- j
ferenee photographers' session. !
one of the photographers asked
Stevenson to pose in a certain
vocal stance.
Stevenson .jokingly replied that
perhaps the photographer should
fake one of Stevenson keeping
still. "I never do that," said Ste
venson; "I don't know how."
Stevenson said he did not know
as yet whether he would be mak
ing any appearances at California
colleges. That, he remarked, is up
to his California bosses.
