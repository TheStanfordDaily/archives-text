## 
### 
Small group living with largo group economy is I he aim of Florence
Moore Hall planners, stated student members of the AWS Residence
Planning Committee yesterday at Roble Hall.
Peggy Woolf, Carol Jacobs, Ann Lobdell, Barbara Allan and Brenda
Sorrey discussed all aspects of Florence Moore Hall in the first of a

"series of talks to women's living
groups on the dorm now under
construction.
"The University believes that
residences are an important part
of the education system, socially
and culturally," stated Peggy
VVoolf, discussion leader.
Small units are twice the price
of a regular dorm and Stanford is
setting a precedent in building
this type. Most schools house 400
lo 1000 girls for half the mil
lion which Moore Hall will cost.
Since Mrs. Florence Moore stip
ulated that the dorm be finished
by September, 1956, when she do
nated $1 million to be used for it,
the work is going forward at high
speed. The rains have slowed it
down somewhat, but double crews
will be used if necessary.
When finished, Moore Ilall will
have seven units with a common
kitchen, landscaped patios and
common administration building
with a library, laundry and store.
The most unusual feature of
the dorm is the rooms themselves.
They air- mainly doubles, each
has its own phone; and they have
an unimpeded view of the cam
pus, so that no room faces a blank
wall.
They are hi symmetrical with
two beds, desks, dressers and
closets.
Other features of the rooms are
padded desk chairs, pastel cur
tains which will serve as shades
and four - foot • wide closets with
sliding doors.
