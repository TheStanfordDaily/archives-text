# 'Return to Reality? Is Lauded By Stevenson at Political Rally
## Cites Contrast To Previous Dulles Policy San Mateo Crowd Hears Demo Leader 
### 
Adlai E. Stevenson, addressing
an overflow crowd of 4000 at Bay
Meadows Clubhouse last night,
praised the "return to reality" of
American foreign policy.
Referring to the "Declaration
of Washington," the former Illi
nois governor told a cheering
throng that the position taken by
President Eisenhower and Prime
Minister Anthony Eden "stands in
sharp contrast to the newsstand
diplomacy to which wc have been
treated recently."
"The Declaration emphasizes a
truth too often unrecognized in
critical areas throughout the
world—that the great imperial-co
lonial power of our time is Soviet
Russia," he said.
Stevenson followed with a bit
ing attack on the domestic scene
under the Eisenhower Adminis
tration by deploring present con
ditions in education, highways,
housing and farm income.
"No Prosperity"
"Wc don't have prosperity," he
declared to the audience, which
was crowded into the smoke-filled
clubhouse.
On the economic front, Steven
son declared that President Tru
man, despite the Korean war,
"was able to reduce the national
debt $12 billion from 1945 to 1952,
while the Republicans have in
creased it by $12 billion in the last
three years."
He criticized representation of
"big business" in the present Ad
ministration.
"The Democrats under the New
Deal insisted that farmers, labor
ers and small businessmen should
also be included with representa
tives of big business in the gov
ernment council," he said.
Stanford Group
Recognizing a sizeable delega
tion of Stanford students in the
audience, he commented, "I am
one of those who doesn't consider
students a menace or all profes
sors subversive."
Joking about the presidential
race, he pointed out that San Ma
teo has never elected a Democrat
official since the Civil War. "In
my county we've elected one," ho
said. "Don't give up."
This was the third speech in as
many nights in California for the
sharp-eyed and sharp-witted can
didate, having spoken in Sacra
mento and Oakland earlier this
week. This Saturday he will ap
pear in Fresno at the California
Democratic Central Council with
Senator Kefauver. The program
will be nationally televised.
He arrived almost an hour late
for the box-lunch supper and had
to gulp down the sandwich-type
meal on the stage before he was
introduced by Attorney General
Edmund (Pat) Brown. A press
conference scheduled before his
speech was cancelled.
He concluded his speeech with
the comment "this is the stale in
which I was born. I'm proud of
it."
Then the man from Illinois
ducked through the noisy crowd
to the front door, where he shook
hands with the milling throng
who will cast the votes in No
vember.

truth too often unrecognized in
critical areas throughout the
world—that the great imperial-co
lonial power of our time is Soviet
Russia," he said.
Stevenson followed with a bit
ing attack on the domestic scene
under the Eisenhower Adminis
tration by deploring present con
ditions in education, highways,
housing and farm income.
"No Prosperity"
"Wc don't have prosperity," he
declared to the audience, which
was crowded into the smoke-filled
clubhouse.
On the economic front, Steven
son declared that President Tru
man, despite the Korean war,
"was able to reduce the national
debt $12 billion from 1945 to 1952,
while the Republicans have in
creased it by $12 billion in the last
three years."
He criticized representation of
"big business" in the present Ad
ministration.
"The Democrats under the New
Deal insisted that farmers, labor
ers and small businessmen should
also be included with representa
tives of big business in the gov
ernment council," he said.
Stanford Group
Recognizing a sizeable delega
tion of Stanford students in the
audience, he commented, "I am
one of those who doesn't consider
students a menace or all profes
sors subversive."
Joking about the presidential
race, he pointed out that San Ma
teo has never elected a Democrat
official since the Civil War. "In
my county we've elected one," ho
said. "Don't give up."
This was the third speech in as
many nights in California for the
sharp-eyed and sharp-witted can
didate, having spoken in Sacra
mento and Oakland earlier this
week. This Saturday he will ap
pear in Fresno at the California
Democratic Central Council with
Senator Kefauver. The program
will be nationally televised.
He arrived almost an hour late
for the box-lunch supper and had
to gulp down the sandwich-type
meal on the stage before he was
introduced by Attorney General
Edmund (Pat) Brown. A press
conference scheduled before his
speech was cancelled.
He concluded his speeech with
the comment "this is the stale in
which I was born. I'm proud of
it."
Then the man from Illinois
ducked through the noisy crowd
to the front door, where he shook
hands with the milling throng
who will cast the votes in No
vember.

Adlai E. Stevenson, addressing
an overflow crowd of 4000 at Bay
Meadows Clubhouse last night,
praised the "return to reality" of
American foreign policy.
Referring to the "Declaration
of Washington," the former Illi
nois governor told a cheering
throng that the position taken by
President Eisenhower and Prime
Minister Anthony Eden "stands in
sharp contrast to the newsstand
diplomacy to which wc have been
treated recently."
"The Declaration emphasizes a
truth too often unrecognized in
critical areas throughout the
world—that the great imperial-co
lonial power of our time is Soviet
Russia," he said.
