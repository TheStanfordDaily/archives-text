# Slowly, Slowly Turning
## 
### 
The wheels of any representative government
turn slowly — the wheels of most student govern
ments turn even slower. Hut the wheels of Stan
ford's student government move so slowly, at
times il in almost impossible to perceive any
motion at all. At least forward motion.
We agree with the political scientists who
believe a government's functioning must be
slow, to assure protection against hasty, ill-ad
vised legislation.
But . . .
In this week's ASSU Legislature meeting a
proposal that had been on and off the floor for
more than a year was finally acted upon. Stan
ford's incoming frosh will have au activity
guide.
Obviously almost everyone agreed such a
guide for students new at the University was
needed.
Apparently everyone seemed to 6ee this need;
everyone except the student Legislature, whose
approval was needed before the booklet could
be printed.
Not only was Legislature the only one who
could see that the book was published but in
doing so would be performing the very job for
which each Legislature member was elected—
to answer to the desires of those they represent,
the Stanford student body.
To see the Legislature in operation one would
find it hard to believe that they are represent
ing real, live people. In actual operation they
seem to be representing a set of rides, not a
group of students.
In short: They do not run the rules of gov
ernment, the rules run them. This is not good
government, not fair government, not the gov
ernment which we feel Stanford's students
and which they most certainly deserve.
Take the case of the freshman handbook:

In October 1954 the Ave Society proposed to
the legislature (then Excom) that they print
a booklet which would describe all of Stan
ford's extra-curricular activities for new stu
dents.
Excom okayed ilie request and I lien llie
wheels started the inevitable slow-down.
The measure was tabled for the remainder of
1955 because Excom could find no "legal"' way
to appropriate sufficient funds, although funds
were available and most students agreed such
a book was needed.
'I he constant search for "legal" means to sat
isfy a student need, expressed as pressing by
those students to their representatives, contin
ued at the beginning of this year.
linally, just two nights ago, Legislature gave
the go-ahead — after haggling for almost 16
months over such questions as when the book
let should be distributed, how it should be
printed and other detailed matters over which
no assembled legislature should worry.
Heaven knows there are enough committees,
why not use the committee system to its advan
tage? If Legislature must be concerned with
style of printing, size of type and such detail let
them set up a committee to decide upon these
things and report its yea or nay recommen
dation to Legislature for a vote without need
less bickering and pointless discussion of tech
nical matters.
With such a system the ridiculous case of a
student proposal lying undecided for more
than a year might have been avoided.
And if there is no way within the rides to get
money which is available for an expressed stu
dent need then Legislature had better change
those rules.
The wheels of government should turn slow
ly, but not so slowly that those whom the gov
ernment represents are neglected.

student proposal lying undecided for more
than a year might have been avoided.
And if there is no way within the rides to get
money which is available for an expressed stu
dent need then Legislature had better change
those rules.
The wheels of government should turn slow
ly, but not so slowly that those whom the gov
ernment represents are neglected.
The wheels of any representative government
turn slowly — the wheels of most student govern
ments turn even slower. Hut the wheels of Stan
ford's student government move so slowly, at
times il in almost impossible to perceive any
motion at all. At least forward motion.
We agree with the political scientists who
believe a government's functioning must be
slow, to assure protection against hasty, ill-ad
vised legislation.
But . . .
In this week's ASSU Legislature meeting a
proposal that had been on and off the floor for
more than a year was finally acted upon. Stan
ford's incoming frosh will have au activity
guide.
Obviously almost everyone agreed such a
guide for students new at the University was
needed.
Apparently everyone seemed to 6ee this need;
everyone except the student Legislature, whose
approval was needed before the booklet could
be printed.
Not only was Legislature the only one who
could see that the book was published but in
doing so would be performing the very job for
which each Legislature member was elected—
to answer to the desires of those they represent,
the Stanford student body.
To see the Legislature in operation one would
find it hard to believe that they are represent
ing real, live people. In actual operation they
seem to be representing a set of rides, not a
group of students.
In short: They do not run the rules of gov
ernment, the rules run them. This is not good
government, not fair government, not the gov
ernment which we feel Stanford's students
and which they most certainly deserve.
Take the case of the freshman handbook:

In October 1954 the Ave Society proposed to
the legislature (then Excom) that they print
a booklet which would describe all of Stan
ford's extra-curricular activities for new stu
dents.
Excom okayed ilie request and I lien llie
wheels started the inevitable slow-down.
The measure was tabled for the remainder of
1955 because Excom could find no "legal"' way
to appropriate sufficient funds, although funds
were available and most students agreed such
a book was needed.
'I he constant search for "legal" means to sat
isfy a student need, expressed as pressing by
those students to their representatives, contin
ued at the beginning of this year.
linally, just two nights ago, Legislature gave
the go-ahead — after haggling for almost 16
months over such questions as when the book
let should be distributed, how it should be
printed and other detailed matters over which
no assembled legislature should worry.
Heaven knows there are enough committees,
why not use the committee system to its advan
tage? If Legislature must be concerned with
style of printing, size of type and such detail let
them set up a committee to decide upon these
things and report its yea or nay recommen
dation to Legislature for a vote without need
less bickering and pointless discussion of tech
nical matters.
With such a system the ridiculous case of a
student proposal lying undecided for more
than a year might have been avoided.
And if there is no way within the rides to get
money which is available for an expressed stu
dent need then Legislature had better change
