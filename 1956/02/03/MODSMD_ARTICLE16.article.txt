Two significant items highlighted University
news thi,«> week—the addition of two firms to
the Stanford Industrial Park and the Athletic
Department's recognition of the "orphan
crew."
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and Hewlett-
Packard Company of Palo Alto will join the
I niversity's industrial family of General Elec
tric, Eastman Kodak and Varian Associates at
the 125-acre site in South Palo Alto.
The 125-aca Industrial Park was approved
for annexation to Pain Alto last month and is
subject to a pnhlic hearing to be held on
Feb. 20.
The aircraft corporation will build two guid
ed missile research laboratories on a 22.669-
acre while the electronic testing manufac
turing plant will be located on a 40-aere lot.
Just what do these additions mean to Stan
ford?
University President Wallace Sterling
summed up the advantages by saying that the
presence of the laboratories near Stanford will
'"supplement and strengthen the present pro
gram of co-operation between industry and the
I niversity."
It will be a give and take relationship. Lock
heed's Missile Division Research Director Dr.
Lewis N. Ridenour sjyd that his firm plans to
develop close association with Stanford seien
tists in both education and research.
An estimated $7 million will be spent on
construction of these laboratories aud a missile
base in Sunnyvale. A staff of 300 will be em
ployed.
The Hewlett-Packard Company is the world
leader in electronic testing and measuring
equipment. This will offer another outlet for
mutual co-operation between Stanford educa

tors and the firm's research staff.
Another highlight in the week's news was
the announcement by the University's Athletic
Board to give the "Orphan Crew" an annual
allowance of $3000.
The name "Orphan Crew" was used by Sports
Illustrated last year in an article referring to
the Crew's independent relationship to the
University.
The crew, through its Alumni Association,
had to raise its own funds for operation. It
was not recognized by the Athletic Board as a
sport.
The Board's appropriation, therefore, can
be taken as its public recognition of Crew as a
bona fide activity at Stanford.
"It expresses in some measure," Assistant lo
the President Frederic Glover explained, "the
University's appreciation of their remarkable
achievement and fine sportsmanship."
The appropriation will be only 40 per cent
of the crew's budget which ranges around $7500
a year.
A new shellhouse was added to its assets last
year at the expense of the Crew's Alumni Asso
ciation which is in charge of its financial affairs.
The shellhouse is located at the Redwood City
lacht Harbor.
The Alumni Association will continue its
fund-raising campaigns to raise the other 60
per cent of the budget.
Among its most spectacular victories last year
was the Crew's placing second in the Western
Sprints at Newport and defeating California
in the Big Race for the first time in 38 years.
According to Coach Lou Lindsay the first
race this year will be with USC here, set tenta
tively for the first week in April. The Crew
has been working out at their Redwood City
facilities.

The 125-aca Industrial Park was approved
for annexation to Pain Alto last month and is
subject to a pnhlic hearing to be held on
Feb. 20.
The aircraft corporation will build two guid
ed missile research laboratories on a 22.669-
acre while the electronic testing manufac
turing plant will be located on a 40-aere lot.
Just what do these additions mean to Stan
ford?
University President Wallace Sterling
summed up the advantages by saying that the
presence of the laboratories near Stanford will
'"supplement and strengthen the present pro
gram of co-operation between industry and the
I niversity."
It will be a give and take relationship. Lock
heed's Missile Division Research Director Dr.
Lewis N. Ridenour sjyd that his firm plans to
develop close association with Stanford seien
tists in both education and research.
An estimated $7 million will be spent on
construction of these laboratories aud a missile
base in Sunnyvale. A staff of 300 will be em
ployed.
The Hewlett-Packard Company is the world
leader in electronic testing and measuring
equipment. This will offer another outlet for
mutual co-operation between Stanford educa

tors and the firm's research staff.
Another highlight in the week's news was
the announcement by the University's Athletic
Board to give the "Orphan Crew" an annual
allowance of $3000.
The name "Orphan Crew" was used by Sports
Illustrated last year in an article referring to
the Crew's independent relationship to the
University.
The crew, through its Alumni Association,
had to raise its own funds for operation. It
was not recognized by the Athletic Board as a
sport.
The Board's appropriation, therefore, can
be taken as its public recognition of Crew as a
bona fide activity at Stanford.
"It expresses in some measure," Assistant lo
the President Frederic Glover explained, "the
University's appreciation of their remarkable
achievement and fine sportsmanship."
The appropriation will be only 40 per cent
of the crew's budget which ranges around $7500
a year.
A new shellhouse was added to its assets last
year at the expense of the Crew's Alumni Asso
ciation which is in charge of its financial affairs.
The shellhouse is located at the Redwood City
lacht Harbor.
The Alumni Association will continue its
fund-raising campaigns to raise the other 60
per cent of the budget.
Among its most spectacular victories last year
was the Crew's placing second in the Western
Sprints at Newport and defeating California
in the Big Race for the first time in 38 years.
According to Coach Lou Lindsay the first
race this year will be with USC here, set tenta
tively for the first week in April. The Crew
has been working out at their Redwood City
facilities.
Two significant items highlighted University
news thi,«> week—the addition of two firms to
the Stanford Industrial Park and the Athletic
Department's recognition of the "orphan
crew."
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and Hewlett-
Packard Company of Palo Alto will join the
I niversity's industrial family of General Elec
tric, Eastman Kodak and Varian Associates at
the 125-acre site in South Palo Alto.
