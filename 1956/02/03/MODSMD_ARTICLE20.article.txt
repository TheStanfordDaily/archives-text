# Movie 'Americanization' Ruins Comic 'Seven-Year Itch' Script
## Monroe Conies to Spend Night in Ewell's Apartment—To Share Air Conditioner 
### Richard Mende 
A surprising number of very candid men professionally connected
with the theater have expressed the opinion that fur the most pari
they prefer movies as entertainment to live stage plays.
There are some good reasons for ihis feeling but lew of Ihem seem
relevant when comparing (he stage version of "The Seven-Year Itch" i

with the film version, now being
shown at the Park Theatre.
First, the original script has
gone through the Americaniza
tion process, making it simple
enough for a child to understand
and freeing it of references to a
considerable segment of adult be
havior.
Everybody does something
about sex, but nobody talks about
it—except, of course, in America,
where the process is supposed to
be i eversed.
Spends the Night
But most of the time it isn't
even supposed to be talked about.
Marilyn Monroe comes down to
spend 1he night in Torn E well's
apartment—in order to take ad
vantage of the air conditioning
unit. We're asked to believe this
in the movie.
And in the movie the humor is
so undermined that; it is not. sim
ply comic, as in the play, but slap
stick farce.
Besides the Americanization

process of making everything
simple and clean, the script has
gone through the Holly woodiza
tion process in which a big-name
star is cast as the heroine.
Press Agents
In this process, casting depends
on the success of the press agent
rather than the ability of the ac
tor, and the deficiencies that arise
from this process are made quite
noticeable by the presence of Mar
ilyn Monroe.
The distinction be! ween a look
of innocence and one of bewilder
ment has never been more clear.
To my knowledge, this is the
first of two films which Tom
Ewell has appeared in since leav
ing a long-run success on Broad
way.
True, it must be difficult to
turn down the big money that
Hollywood offers, but if his fu
ture is to be cast in films like
"The Seven-Year Itch" and "The
Lieutenant Wore Skirts," my ad
vice to Mr. Ewell would be: (Jo
east, good man! Go east.
In fairness, the movie did have
its moments, but, after sitting
through the rest of the long, try
ing movie, one is not especially
tempted to be fair.
