# Donald Bertrand Tresidder— Stanford's Fourth President
## Tresidder Was Yosemite Camp Business Man Worked Way Through Med School as Cook 
### Frank Huntress 
"110 was a Stanford man in our
own Family."
That's the way Hay Lyman Wil
bur summed up the three and one
half year search for his successor
to the presidency of Stanford.
The man the Board of Trustees
unanimously selected was its own
president.
In fact, he was in the East at
the time interviewing possible
candidates who would follow such
men as David Starr Jordan, presi
dent from 1891 to 1913; John Cas
per Branner, 1913 to 1916; and
Wilbur, 1910 to 1913, as the Uni
versity's' fourth president.
Thus, Donald Bertram! Tresid
der, ClaSs of 1917, became the
fourth president of Leland Stan
lord Junior University.
He was born in the town of
Tipton, fnd., on April 7, 189-1, the
son of Dr. and Mrs. Treloar Ties-1
idder.
His father had come to the
United States from England in j
1885. Both his parents arid an
undo were practicing physicians. I
Physicians
Tresidder's earliest intention i
was to be a physician. As a small i
boy he would accompany his fa-!
ther as he made his rounds with
a horse and buggy. He received
his preliminary education in pub-!
lie school in Indiana.
At the age of 19 he taught all
grades in a one • room country i
school in Tipton. The following J
year he entered the University of!
('lm ago.
After- a year in a pre medical I
course at C ii i c a go , Tresidder
beaded for California with his |
sister on a vacation trip. The j
train was held up by a wreck and j
tie became acquainted with a rep- j
resentative of David A. Curry, an
educator who had established a
summer camp in Yosemite Na-:
t ional Par k.
This acquaintance led to a sum
mer's employment at Camp
Curry where a Stanford professor!
invited him to visit the University 1
on his way home.
When Tresidder came to the I
campus, the pr (j 112 e s so r , R.' L. j
< Jreen of the department of math
ematics, offered him room and j
boar d in exchange for his services
as cook if he would stay at Stan
ford.
Cooking Job
The young student accepted the
job although he knew little about
cooking. So, he hired an Oriental j
to do the cooking until he picked
up the techniques. A long line of 1
pre • med students inherited the I
cook's job at the Green home,
from this beginning.
In 1917 Tresidder enlisted in a i
base hospital unit, but after some
months of service at Camp Pre-i
inorrt in Menlo Park, he trans- j
ferred to the air service of the
Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
After a year of training he was
graduated from the school of mil-1
itary aeronautics at the Univer-j
sity of California. Following fur
ther training in Texas and Illinois j
he was commissioned a second
lieutenant. He was serving with a 1
bombing squadron in Houston, j
Texas, when the war ended.
Back at Stanford
Back at Stanford after the war
Tresidder became an assistant in
the physiology department and
later in ihe anatomy department.
For his work in anatomy he was 1
elected to membership in Sigma
Xi, an honorary research society, i
He received the A.B. degree!
from Stanford in 1919. He then
moved to the Stanford Medical
School, becoming assistant in a
research on botulism a vital sub
ject affecting the public health
and the welfare and future of
parts of the canning industry.
Meanwhile, he had been spend-'

ing most of his summers working
at Yosemite. There he met Mary
Curry, daughter of the founders
of Camp Curry.
She had entered Stanford with
the class of 1916 but she com
pleted her undergraduate work in
English in three years, receiving
the A.B. degree in 1915 and the
A.M. degree in 1916.
Miss Curry was completing the
requirement for the Ph.D. degree
in English at Yale when her stud
ies were interrupted by a pro
posal of marriage from Tresidder.
They were married on June 16,
1920, at the site of LeConte Me
morial in Yosemite. Their honey
moon was a pack trip deep into
the Sierra. Mrs. Tresidder now
lives at her campus home at 415
(Jerona Koad.
Kecoim'S Camp Manager
In 1922, because of circum
stances ensuing from deaths in
the Curry family, Tresidder
turned aside from his medical
courses to become associate man
ager of the Yosemite camp. But
as the camp closed each fall dur
ing the years 1922 to 1925 lie
would return to his studies at the
medical school.
In 1925 the Secretary of the In
terior caused a consolidation of
all the companies operating in the
park. Tresidder became president
of the consolidated company
known as the Yosemite Park and
Curry Company. He held this po
sition for the remaining 23 years
of his life.
M.I). Degree
Although most of his time was
spent operating the Yosemite
firm, Tresidder was able to keep
up his medical studies and he re
ceived the M.D. degree in 1927.
But he never actively practiced
medicine.
Under Tresidder's guidance, the
company expanded to a capacity
for 3000 overnight guests plus fa
cilities for many more daytime
visitors.
The Ahwahnee Hotel costing
over a million dollars was com
pleted in 1926. A chain of High
Sierra camps also was added to
the company's holdings which
opened the area of Yosemite
peaks and lakes to hikers.
He was primarily responsible
for popularizing Yosemite as a
skiing resqrt. Snow Creek Lodge
on the rim of the Valley was
opened in 1929 and Badger Pass
in 1935.
During his term as the firm's
president, the annual number of
guests rose from 300,348 in 1926
to 525,989 in 1948.
In 1939 Tresidder incurred a
throat infection which required
that he rest from the strenuous
activities as top executive of the
Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany and find a warmer climate.
The ailment persisted for two
years and much of the time was
spent near Stanford.
In December of that year he
was elected to the Stanford Board
of Trustees, becoming the Board's

youngest member. He returned to.
' his work at. Yosemite in 1941.
The next year he was elected
Board president. And on Jan. 21,
j 1943, while Tresidder was in the
j East looking for a replacement
: lor Ray Lyman Wilbur, the Board
i of Trustees unanimously elected !
I him to become Stanford's fourth !
i president. He had been reeom- 1
I mended to the Board by ail the
deans of the University's • 10
schools.
Tresidder took over as presi
dent on Sept. 1 without the for
mal ceremony which marked the
I inauguration of the three former
j presidents.
Upon taking office Tresidder I
j stated: ''The founders had a vis-!
i ion of a University greater than >
any then in existence. Dr. Jordan,
> willi his skill in selecting Ihe
right people, brought together the
! nucleus of a great faculty. Dr.'
i Wilbur developed and expanded
[Stanford into what it is today.!
|My job is to consolidate those
1 gains."
(beared to War
: In stepping intit his new role, j
he found Stanford a University
; geared to war. lis curriculum had j
i been streamlined, operating on a
I continuous session basis. The!
j laboratories were filled with war
research and the coeducational I
j student body enrollment was!
i down by 11 per cent.
The University had an enroll-1
ment of some 3500 students and !
! a faculty of more than 900. The
enrollment more than doubled
during his five and one-half years
! as president.
New deans for six of the Uni
versity's 10 schools were appoint
ed during his term of office. Fac
ulty recruitment was unusually
| heavy because of the enrollment
! increases caused by the impact of
j returning veterans to college fol
lowing the war.
In the spring of 1946 the to
tal enrollment approached 5000.
Tresidder realized that the rise
was only beginning and planned
for the next year's "temporary"
enrollment to be around 7000.
Stanford Village
At the time veterans were cre
ating unprecedented problems in
campus housing. Tresidder de
cided against trailers and de
mountable houses being sot do\Vn
on the campus and concentrated
on acquiring Dibble Hospital, a
semi-permanent War Department
facility located in Menlo Park
only three miles from the campus.
Two thousand students had
been admitted to the University
before the housing problem had
been solved. But in the summer
of 1916, Tresidder announced that
"our greatest gamble of all finally
paid off."
Custody of t?ie hospital was
gained on Aug. 1, and by late Sep
tember nearly 1200 students were
received into dormitories which
had been converted from the hos
pital wards.
Stanford Village, as the hospi

tal was renamed, became a com
munity of 325 families and 140(*
single students with "complete
village facilities."
Tresidder, being a successful
businessman, recognized that an
independent gift program is fun
damental to a university. During
his brief period as head of Stan
ford. a total of $7,217,000 was re
ceived by the University through
gifts, trusts and bequests.
Also, the student health serv
ices were unified and a plan pro
viding students with medical and
surgical care and necessary hos
pitalization was installed.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute was created under his guid-
I ance. It has established its use
! fulness to the industrial economy
j of the West Coast and proved a
means for relating, on a consult
| ing basis, the scientific knowledge
of members of the teaching fac
ulty to a full-time research staff
independent of the faculty.
Dean of Students
To co-ord\natje the University's
4he individual stu
: dent, he created the position of
dean of students and also added
a director of planning to cope
with the plfysidaj needs of the
caitVpiM < 1 k t i
Though primarily a business
executive at Ihe time he became
president of Stanford, Tresidder
rapidly gained recognition in the
field of education. One of his
most important positions as an
educator was as chairman of the
Western Regional Conference of
UNESCO.
During his first year as presi
dent he met with groups of the
faculty to discuss Stanford's pro
gram of undergraduate educa
tion. He wished "to explore the
contention that too great a de
pendence on the elective system
led undergraduate students into a
program of miscellaneous and
scattered courses."
Met With Faculty
A faculty committee was
formed to study the effectiveness
of undergraduate study with par
ticular emphasis on general edu
cation. This group is the fore>
runner of today's Faculty Com
mittee on the Study of Under
graduate Education.
For his "outstanding eontribu
| tions lo higher education," he re
ceived the LL.D. degree from Po
mona College in 1944.
Early in the year of 19?H Tres
idder went to New York to at
tend a meeting of the Association
of American Universities and to
seek new faculty members. He
had iK'en encouraged by IJniver
: sity Chancellor Wilbur to "re-dc
velop the association which had
slackened pace under the wage of
war."
Although believed to be in per
fect health, Tresidder suffered a
heart attack and died in his St.
Regis Hotel room In New York
City on the evening of Jan. 28
. He was 53 years old.

He was primarily responsible
for popularizing Yosemite as a
skiing resqrt. Snow Creek Lodge
on the rim of the Valley was
opened in 1929 and Badger Pass
in 1935.
During his term as the firm's
president, the annual number of
guests rose from 300,348 in 1926
to 525,989 in 1948.
In 1939 Tresidder incurred a
throat infection which required
that he rest from the strenuous
activities as top executive of the
Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany and find a warmer climate.
The ailment persisted for two
years and much of the time was
spent near Stanford.
In December of that year he
was elected to the Stanford Board
of Trustees, becoming the Board's

youngest member. He returned to.
' his work at. Yosemite in 1941.
The next year he was elected
Board president. And on Jan. 21,
j 1943, while Tresidder was in the
j East looking for a replacement
: lor Ray Lyman Wilbur, the Board
i of Trustees unanimously elected !
I him to become Stanford's fourth !
i president. He had been reeom- 1
I mended to the Board by ail the
deans of the University's • 10
schools.
Tresidder took over as presi
dent on Sept. 1 without the for
mal ceremony which marked the
I inauguration of the three former
j presidents.
Upon taking office Tresidder I
j stated: ''The founders had a vis-!
i ion of a University greater than >

> willi his skill in selecting Ihe
right people, brought together the
! nucleus of a great faculty. Dr.'
i Wilbur developed and expanded
[Stanford into what it is today.!

(beared to War
: In stepping intit his new role, j
he found Stanford a University
; geared to war. lis curriculum had j
i been streamlined, operating on a
I continuous session basis. The!
j laboratories were filled with war
research and the coeducational I
j student body enrollment was!
i down by 11 per cent.
The University had an enroll-1
ment of some 3500 students and !
! a faculty of more than 900. The
enrollment more than doubled
during his five and one-half years
! as president.
New deans for six of the Uni
versity's 10 schools were appoint
ed during his term of office. Fac
ulty recruitment was unusually
| heavy because of the enrollment
! increases caused by the impact of
j returning veterans to college fol
lowing the war.
In the spring of 1946 the to
tal enrollment approached 5000.
Tresidder realized that the rise
was only beginning and planned
for the next year's "temporary"
enrollment to be around 7000.
Stanford Village
At the time veterans were cre
ating unprecedented problems in
campus housing. Tresidder de
cided against trailers and de
mountable houses being sot do\Vn
on the campus and concentrated
on acquiring Dibble Hospital, a
semi-permanent War Department
facility located in Menlo Park
only three miles from the campus.
Two thousand students had
been admitted to the University
before the housing problem had
been solved. But in the summer
of 1916, Tresidder announced that
"our greatest gamble of all finally
paid off."
Custody of t?ie hospital was
gained on Aug. 1, and by late Sep
tember nearly 1200 students were
received into dormitories which
had been converted from the hos
pital wards.
Stanford Village, as the hospi

tal was renamed, became a com
munity of 325 families and 140(*
single students with "complete
village facilities."
Tresidder, being a successful
businessman, recognized that an
independent gift program is fun
damental to a university. During
his brief period as head of Stan
ford. a total of $7,217,000 was re
ceived by the University through
gifts, trusts and bequests.
Also, the student health serv
ices were unified and a plan pro
viding students with medical and
surgical care and necessary hos
pitalization was installed.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute was created under his guid-
I ance. It has established its use
! fulness to the industrial economy
j of the West Coast and proved a
means for relating, on a consult
| ing basis, the scientific knowledge
of members of the teaching fac
ulty to a full-time research staff
independent of the faculty.
Dean of Students
To co-ord\natje the University's
4he individual stu
: dent, he created the position of
dean of students and also added
a director of planning to cope
with the plfysidaj needs of the
caitVpiM < 1 k t i
Though primarily a business
executive at Ihe time he became
president of Stanford, Tresidder
rapidly gained recognition in the
field of education. One of his
most important positions as an
educator was as chairman of the
Western Regional Conference of
UNESCO.
During his first year as presi
dent he met with groups of the
faculty to discuss Stanford's pro
gram of undergraduate educa
tion. He wished "to explore the
contention that too great a de
pendence on the elective system
led undergraduate students into a
program of miscellaneous and
scattered courses."
Met With Faculty
A faculty committee was
formed to study the effectiveness
of undergraduate study with par
ticular emphasis on general edu
cation. This group is the fore>
runner of today's Faculty Com
mittee on the Study of Under
graduate Education.
For his "outstanding eontribu
| tions lo higher education," he re
ceived the LL.D. degree from Po
mona College in 1944.
Early in the year of 19?H Tres
idder went to New York to at
tend a meeting of the Association
of American Universities and to
seek new faculty members. He
had iK'en encouraged by IJniver
: sity Chancellor Wilbur to "re-dc
velop the association which had
slackened pace under the wage of
war."
Although believed to be in per
fect health, Tresidder suffered a
heart attack and died in his St.
Regis Hotel room In New York
City on the evening of Jan. 28
. He was 53 years old.


DR. AM) MRS. DONALD TRESIDDER WITH THEIR AIRPLANE
He was believed to be the only president of a major university to l*.ly his .own plane.
"110 was a Stanford man in our
own Family."
That's the way Hay Lyman Wil
bur summed up the three and one
half year search for his successor
to the presidency of Stanford.
The man the Board of Trustees
unanimously selected was its own
president.
In fact, he was in the East at
the time interviewing possible
candidates who would follow such
men as David Starr Jordan, presi
dent from 1891 to 1913; John Cas
per Branner, 1913 to 1916; and
Wilbur, 1910 to 1913, as the Uni
versity's' fourth president.
Thus, Donald Bertram! Tresid
der, ClaSs of 1917, became the
fourth president of Leland Stan
lord Junior University.
He was born in the town of
Tipton, fnd., on April 7, 189-1, the
son of Dr. and Mrs. Treloar Ties-1
idder.
His father had come to the
United States from England in j
1885. Both his parents arid an
undo were practicing physicians. I
Physicians
Tresidder's earliest intention i
was to be a physician. As a small i
boy he would accompany his fa-!
ther as he made his rounds with
a horse and buggy. He received
his preliminary education in pub-!
lie school in Indiana.
At the age of 19 he taught all
grades in a one • room country i
school in Tipton. The following J
year he entered the University of!
('lm ago.
After- a year in a pre medical I
course at C ii i c a go , Tresidder
beaded for California with his |
sister on a vacation trip. The j
train was held up by a wreck and j
tie became acquainted with a rep- j
resentative of David A. Curry, an
educator who had established a
summer camp in Yosemite Na-:
t ional Par k.
This acquaintance led to a sum
mer's employment at Camp
Curry where a Stanford professor!
invited him to visit the University 1
on his way home.
When Tresidder came to the I
campus, the pr (j 112 e s so r , R.' L. j
< Jreen of the department of math
ematics, offered him room and j
boar d in exchange for his services
as cook if he would stay at Stan
ford.
Cooking Job
The young student accepted the
job although he knew little about
cooking. So, he hired an Oriental j
to do the cooking until he picked
up the techniques. A long line of 1
pre • med students inherited the I
cook's job at the Green home,
from this beginning.
In 1917 Tresidder enlisted in a i
base hospital unit, but after some
months of service at Camp Pre-i
inorrt in Menlo Park, he trans- j
ferred to the air service of the
Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
After a year of training he was
graduated from the school of mil-1
itary aeronautics at the Univer-j
sity of California. Following fur
ther training in Texas and Illinois j
he was commissioned a second
lieutenant. He was serving with a 1
bombing squadron in Houston, j
Texas, when the war ended.
Back at Stanford
Back at Stanford after the war
Tresidder became an assistant in
the physiology department and
later in ihe anatomy department.
For his work in anatomy he was 1
elected to membership in Sigma
Xi, an honorary research society, i
He received the A.B. degree!
from Stanford in 1919. He then
moved to the Stanford Medical
School, becoming assistant in a
research on botulism a vital sub
ject affecting the public health
and the welfare and future of
parts of the canning industry.
Meanwhile, he had been spend-'

ing most of his summers working
at Yosemite. There he met Mary
Curry, daughter of the founders
of Camp Curry.
She had entered Stanford with
the class of 1916 but she com
pleted her undergraduate work in
English in three years, receiving
the A.B. degree in 1915 and the
A.M. degree in 1916.
Miss Curry was completing the
requirement for the Ph.D. degree
in English at Yale when her stud
ies were interrupted by a pro
posal of marriage from Tresidder.
They were married on June 16,
1920, at the site of LeConte Me
morial in Yosemite. Their honey
moon was a pack trip deep into
the Sierra. Mrs. Tresidder now
lives at her campus home at 415
(Jerona Koad.
Kecoim'S Camp Manager
In 1922, because of circum
stances ensuing from deaths in
the Curry family, Tresidder
turned aside from his medical
courses to become associate man
ager of the Yosemite camp. But
as the camp closed each fall dur
ing the years 1922 to 1925 lie
would return to his studies at the
medical school.
In 1925 the Secretary of the In
terior caused a consolidation of
all the companies operating in the
park. Tresidder became president
of the consolidated company
known as the Yosemite Park and
Curry Company. He held this po
sition for the remaining 23 years
of his life.
M.I). Degree
Although most of his time was
spent operating the Yosemite
firm, Tresidder was able to keep
up his medical studies and he re
ceived the M.D. degree in 1927.
But he never actively practiced
medicine.
Under Tresidder's guidance, the
company expanded to a capacity
for 3000 overnight guests plus fa
cilities for many more daytime
visitors.
The Ahwahnee Hotel costing
over a million dollars was com
pleted in 1926. A chain of High
Sierra camps also was added to
the company's holdings which
opened the area of Yosemite
peaks and lakes to hikers.
He was primarily responsible
for popularizing Yosemite as a
skiing resqrt. Snow Creek Lodge
on the rim of the Valley was
opened in 1929 and Badger Pass
in 1935.
During his term as the firm's
president, the annual number of
guests rose from 300,348 in 1926
to 525,989 in 1948.

had iK'en encouraged by IJniver
: sity Chancellor Wilbur to "re-dc
velop the association which had
slackened pace under the wage of
war."
Although believed to be in per
fect health, Tresidder suffered a
heart attack and died in his St.
Regis Hotel room In New York
City on the evening of Jan. 28
. He was 53 years old.


DR. AM) MRS. DONALD TRESIDDER WITH THEIR AIRPLANE
He was believed to be the only president of a major university to l*.ly his .own plane.
"110 was a Stanford man in our
own Family."
That's the way Hay Lyman Wil
bur summed up the three and one
half year search for his successor
to the presidency of Stanford.
The man the Board of Trustees
unanimously selected was its own
president.
In fact, he was in the East at
the time interviewing possible
candidates who would follow such
men as David Starr Jordan, presi
dent from 1891 to 1913; John Cas
per Branner, 1913 to 1916; and
Wilbur, 1910 to 1913, as the Uni
versity's' fourth president.
Thus, Donald Bertram! Tresid
der, ClaSs of 1917, became the
fourth president of Leland Stan
lord Junior University.
He was born in the town of
Tipton, fnd., on April 7, 189-1, the
son of Dr. and Mrs. Treloar Ties-1
idder.
His father had come to the
United States from England in j
1885. Both his parents arid an
undo were practicing physicians. I
Physicians
Tresidder's earliest intention i
was to be a physician. As a small i
boy he would accompany his fa-!
ther as he made his rounds with
a horse and buggy. He received
his preliminary education in pub-!
lie school in Indiana.
At the age of 19 he taught all
grades in a one • room country i
school in Tipton. The following J
year he entered the University of!
('lm ago.
After- a year in a pre medical I
course at C ii i c a go , Tresidder
beaded for California with his |
sister on a vacation trip. The j
train was held up by a wreck and j
tie became acquainted with a rep- j
resentative of David A. Curry, an
educator who had established a
summer camp in Yosemite Na-:
t ional Par k.
This acquaintance led to a sum
mer's employment at Camp
Curry where a Stanford professor!
invited him to visit the University 1
on his way home.
When Tresidder came to the I
campus, the pr (j 112 e s so r , R.' L. j
< Jreen of the department of math
ematics, offered him room and j
boar d in exchange for his services
as cook if he would stay at Stan
ford.
Cooking Job
The young student accepted the
job although he knew little about
cooking. So, he hired an Oriental j
to do the cooking until he picked
up the techniques. A long line of 1
pre • med students inherited the I
cook's job at the Green home,
from this beginning.
In 1917 Tresidder enlisted in a i
base hospital unit, but after some
months of service at Camp Pre-i
inorrt in Menlo Park, he trans- j
ferred to the air service of the
Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
After a year of training he was
graduated from the school of mil-1
itary aeronautics at the Univer-j
sity of California. Following fur
ther training in Texas and Illinois j
he was commissioned a second
lieutenant. He was serving with a 1
bombing squadron in Houston, j
Texas, when the war ended.
Back at Stanford
Back at Stanford after the war
Tresidder became an assistant in
the physiology department and
later in ihe anatomy department.
For his work in anatomy he was 1
elected to membership in Sigma
Xi, an honorary research society, i
He received the A.B. degree!
from Stanford in 1919. He then
moved to the Stanford Medical
School, becoming assistant in a
research on botulism a vital sub
ject affecting the public health
and the welfare and future of
parts of the canning industry.
Meanwhile, he had been spend-'

ing most of his summers working
at Yosemite. There he met Mary
Curry, daughter of the founders
of Camp Curry.
She had entered Stanford with
the class of 1916 but she com
pleted her undergraduate work in
English in three years, receiving
the A.B. degree in 1915 and the
A.M. degree in 1916.
Miss Curry was completing the
requirement for the Ph.D. degree
in English at Yale when her stud
ies were interrupted by a pro
posal of marriage from Tresidder.
They were married on June 16,
1920, at the site of LeConte Me
morial in Yosemite. Their honey
moon was a pack trip deep into
the Sierra. Mrs. Tresidder now
lives at her campus home at 415
(Jerona Koad.
Kecoim'S Camp Manager
In 1922, because of circum
stances ensuing from deaths in
the Curry family, Tresidder
turned aside from his medical
courses to become associate man
ager of the Yosemite camp. But
as the camp closed each fall dur
ing the years 1922 to 1925 lie
would return to his studies at the
medical school.
In 1925 the Secretary of the In
terior caused a consolidation of
all the companies operating in the
park. Tresidder became president
of the consolidated company
known as the Yosemite Park and
Curry Company. He held this po
sition for the remaining 23 years
of his life.
M.I). Degree
Although most of his time was
spent operating the Yosemite
firm, Tresidder was able to keep
up his medical studies and he re
ceived the M.D. degree in 1927.
But he never actively practiced
medicine.
Under Tresidder's guidance, the
company expanded to a capacity
for 3000 overnight guests plus fa
cilities for many more daytime
visitors.
The Ahwahnee Hotel costing
over a million dollars was com
pleted in 1926. A chain of High
Sierra camps also was added to
the company's holdings which
opened the area of Yosemite
peaks and lakes to hikers.
He was primarily responsible
for popularizing Yosemite as a
skiing resqrt. Snow Creek Lodge
on the rim of the Valley was
opened in 1929 and Badger Pass
in 1935.
During his term as the firm's
president, the annual number of
guests rose from 300,348 in 1926
to 525,989 in 1948.
In 1939 Tresidder incurred a
throat infection which required
that he rest from the strenuous
activities as top executive of the
Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany and find a warmer climate.
The ailment persisted for two
years and much of the time was
spent near Stanford.
In December of that year he
was elected to the Stanford Board
of Trustees, becoming the Board's

youngest member. He returned to.
' his work at. Yosemite in 1941.
The next year he was elected
Board president. And on Jan. 21,
j 1943, while Tresidder was in the
j East looking for a replacement
: lor Ray Lyman Wilbur, the Board
i of Trustees unanimously elected !
I him to become Stanford's fourth !
i president. He had been reeom- 1
I mended to the Board by ail the
deans of the University's • 10
schools.
Tresidder took over as presi
dent on Sept. 1 without the for
mal ceremony which marked the
I inauguration of the three former
j presidents.
Upon taking office Tresidder I
j stated: ''The founders had a vis-!
i ion of a University greater than >
any then in existence. Dr. Jordan,
> willi his skill in selecting Ihe
right people, brought together the
! nucleus of a great faculty. Dr.'
i Wilbur developed and expanded
[Stanford into what it is today.!
|My job is to consolidate those
1 gains."
(beared to War
: In stepping intit his new role, j
he found Stanford a University
; geared to war. lis curriculum had j
i been streamlined, operating on a
I continuous session basis. The!
j laboratories were filled with war
research and the coeducational I
j student body enrollment was!
i down by 11 per cent.
The University had an enroll-1
ment of some 3500 students and !
! a faculty of more than 900. The
enrollment more than doubled
during his five and one-half years
! as president.
New deans for six of the Uni
versity's 10 schools were appoint
ed during his term of office. Fac
ulty recruitment was unusually
| heavy because of the enrollment
! increases caused by the impact of
j returning veterans to college fol
lowing the war.
In the spring of 1946 the to
tal enrollment approached 5000.
Tresidder realized that the rise
was only beginning and planned
for the next year's "temporary"
enrollment to be around 7000.
Stanford Village
At the time veterans were cre
ating unprecedented problems in
campus housing. Tresidder de
cided against trailers and de
mountable houses being sot do\Vn
on the campus and concentrated
on acquiring Dibble Hospital, a
semi-permanent War Department
facility located in Menlo Park
only three miles from the campus.
Two thousand students had
been admitted to the University
before the housing problem had
been solved. But in the summer
of 1916, Tresidder announced that
"our greatest gamble of all finally
paid off."
Custody of t?ie hospital was
gained on Aug. 1, and by late Sep
tember nearly 1200 students were
received into dormitories which
had been converted from the hos
pital wards.
Stanford Village, as the hospi

tal was renamed, became a com
munity of 325 families and 140(*
single students with "complete
village facilities."
Tresidder, being a successful
businessman, recognized that an
independent gift program is fun
damental to a university. During
his brief period as head of Stan
ford. a total of $7,217,000 was re
ceived by the University through
gifts, trusts and bequests.
Also, the student health serv
ices were unified and a plan pro
viding students with medical and
surgical care and necessary hos
pitalization was installed.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute was created under his guid-
I ance. It has established its use
! fulness to the industrial economy
j of the West Coast and proved a
means for relating, on a consult
| ing basis, the scientific knowledge
of members of the teaching fac
ulty to a full-time research staff
independent of the faculty.
Dean of Students
To co-ord\natje the University's
4he individual stu
: dent, he created the position of
dean of students and also added
a director of planning to cope
with the plfysidaj needs of the
caitVpiM < 1 k t i
Though primarily a business
executive at Ihe time he became
president of Stanford, Tresidder
rapidly gained recognition in the
field of education. One of his
most important positions as an
educator was as chairman of the
Western Regional Conference of
UNESCO.
During his first year as presi
dent he met with groups of the
faculty to discuss Stanford's pro
gram of undergraduate educa
tion. He wished "to explore the
contention that too great a de
pendence on the elective system
led undergraduate students into a
program of miscellaneous and
scattered courses."
Met With Faculty
A faculty committee was
formed to study the effectiveness
of undergraduate study with par
ticular emphasis on general edu
cation. This group is the fore>
runner of today's Faculty Com
mittee on the Study of Under
graduate Education.
For his "outstanding eontribu
| tions lo higher education," he re
ceived the LL.D. degree from Po
mona College in 1944.
Early in the year of 19?H Tres
idder went to New York to at
tend a meeting of the Association
of American Universities and to
seek new faculty members. He
had iK'en encouraged by IJniver
: sity Chancellor Wilbur to "re-dc
velop the association which had
slackened pace under the wage of
war."
Although believed to be in per
fect health, Tresidder suffered a
heart attack and died in his St.

City on the evening of Jan. 28
. He was 53 years old.

But he never actively practiced
medicine.
Under Tresidder's guidance, the
company expanded to a capacity
for 3000 overnight guests plus fa
cilities for many more daytime
visitors.
The Ahwahnee Hotel costing
over a million dollars was com
pleted in 1926. A chain of High
Sierra camps also was added to
the company's holdings which
opened the area of Yosemite
peaks and lakes to hikers.
He was primarily responsible
for popularizing Yosemite as a
skiing resqrt. Snow Creek Lodge
on the rim of the Valley was
opened in 1929 and Badger Pass
in 1935.
During his term as the firm's
president, the annual number of
guests rose from 300,348 in 1926
to 525,989 in 1948.
In 1939 Tresidder incurred a
throat infection which required
that he rest from the strenuous
activities as top executive of the
Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany and find a warmer climate.
The ailment persisted for two
years and much of the time was
spent near Stanford.
In December of that year he
was elected to the Stanford Board
of Trustees, becoming the Board's

youngest member. He returned to.
' his work at. Yosemite in 1941.
The next year he was elected
Board president. And on Jan. 21,
j 1943, while Tresidder was in the
j East looking for a replacement
: lor Ray Lyman Wilbur, the Board
i of Trustees unanimously elected !
I him to become Stanford's fourth !
i president. He had been reeom- 1
I mended to the Board by ail the
deans of the University's • 10
schools.
Tresidder took over as presi
dent on Sept. 1 without the for
mal ceremony which marked the
I inauguration of the three former
j presidents.
Upon taking office Tresidder I
j stated: ''The founders had a vis-!
i ion of a University greater than >
any then in existence. Dr. Jordan,
> willi his skill in selecting Ihe
right people, brought together the
! nucleus of a great faculty. Dr.'

[Stanford into what it is today.!

(beared to War
: In stepping intit his new role, j
he found Stanford a University
; geared to war. lis curriculum had j
i been streamlined, operating on a
I continuous session basis. The!
j laboratories were filled with war
research and the coeducational I
j student body enrollment was!
i down by 11 per cent.
The University had an enroll-1
ment of some 3500 students and !
! a faculty of more than 900. The
enrollment more than doubled
during his five and one-half years
! as president.
New deans for six of the Uni
versity's 10 schools were appoint
ed during his term of office. Fac
ulty recruitment was unusually
| heavy because of the enrollment
! increases caused by the impact of
j returning veterans to college fol
lowing the war.
In the spring of 1946 the to
tal enrollment approached 5000.
Tresidder realized that the rise
was only beginning and planned
for the next year's "temporary"
enrollment to be around 7000.
Stanford Village
At the time veterans were cre
ating unprecedented problems in
campus housing. Tresidder de
cided against trailers and de
mountable houses being sot do\Vn
on the campus and concentrated
on acquiring Dibble Hospital, a
semi-permanent War Department
facility located in Menlo Park
only three miles from the campus.
Two thousand students had
been admitted to the University
before the housing problem had
been solved. But in the summer
of 1916, Tresidder announced that
"our greatest gamble of all finally
paid off."
Custody of t?ie hospital was
gained on Aug. 1, and by late Sep
tember nearly 1200 students were
received into dormitories which
had been converted from the hos
pital wards.
Stanford Village, as the hospi

tal was renamed, became a com
munity of 325 families and 140(*
single students with "complete
village facilities."
Tresidder, being a successful
businessman, recognized that an
independent gift program is fun
damental to a university. During
his brief period as head of Stan
ford. a total of $7,217,000 was re
ceived by the University through
gifts, trusts and bequests.
Also, the student health serv
ices were unified and a plan pro
viding students with medical and
surgical care and necessary hos
pitalization was installed.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute was created under his guid-
I ance. It has established its use
! fulness to the industrial economy
j of the West Coast and proved a
means for relating, on a consult
| ing basis, the scientific knowledge
of members of the teaching fac
ulty to a full-time research staff
independent of the faculty.
Dean of Students
To co-ord\natje the University's
4he individual stu
: dent, he created the position of
dean of students and also added
a director of planning to cope
with the plfysidaj needs of the
caitVpiM < 1 k t i
Though primarily a business
executive at Ihe time he became
president of Stanford, Tresidder
rapidly gained recognition in the
field of education. One of his
most important positions as an
educator was as chairman of the
Western Regional Conference of
UNESCO.
During his first year as presi
dent he met with groups of the
faculty to discuss Stanford's pro
gram of undergraduate educa
tion. He wished "to explore the
contention that too great a de
pendence on the elective system
led undergraduate students into a
program of miscellaneous and
scattered courses."
Met With Faculty
A faculty committee was
formed to study the effectiveness
of undergraduate study with par
ticular emphasis on general edu
cation. This group is the fore>
runner of today's Faculty Com
mittee on the Study of Under
graduate Education.
For his "outstanding eontribu
| tions lo higher education," he re
ceived the LL.D. degree from Po
mona College in 1944.
Early in the year of 19?H Tres
idder went to New York to at
tend a meeting of the Association
of American Universities and to
seek new faculty members. He
had iK'en encouraged by IJniver
: sity Chancellor Wilbur to "re-dc
velop the association which had
slackened pace under the wage of
war."
Although believed to be in per
fect health, Tresidder suffered a
heart attack and died in his St.
Regis Hotel room In New York
City on the evening of Jan. 28
. He was 53 years old.


DR. AM) MRS. DONALD TRESIDDER WITH THEIR AIRPLANE
He was believed to be the only president of a major university to l*.ly his .own plane.
"110 was a Stanford man in our
own Family."
That's the way Hay Lyman Wil
bur summed up the three and one
half year search for his successor
to the presidency of Stanford.
The man the Board of Trustees
unanimously selected was its own
president.
In fact, he was in the East at
the time interviewing possible
candidates who would follow such
men as David Starr Jordan, presi
dent from 1891 to 1913; John Cas
per Branner, 1913 to 1916; and
Wilbur, 1910 to 1913, as the Uni
versity's' fourth president.
Thus, Donald Bertram! Tresid
der, ClaSs of 1917, became the
fourth president of Leland Stan
lord Junior University.
He was born in the town of
Tipton, fnd., on April 7, 189-1, the
son of Dr. and Mrs. Treloar Ties-1
idder.
His father had come to the
United States from England in j
1885. Both his parents arid an
undo were practicing physicians. I
Physicians
Tresidder's earliest intention i
was to be a physician. As a small i
boy he would accompany his fa-!
ther as he made his rounds with
a horse and buggy. He received
his preliminary education in pub-!
lie school in Indiana.
At the age of 19 he taught all
grades in a one • room country i
school in Tipton. The following J
year he entered the University of!
('lm ago.
After- a year in a pre medical I
course at C ii i c a go , Tresidder
beaded for California with his |
sister on a vacation trip. The j
train was held up by a wreck and j
tie became acquainted with a rep- j
resentative of David A. Curry, an
educator who had established a
summer camp in Yosemite Na-:
t ional Par k.
This acquaintance led to a sum
mer's employment at Camp
Curry where a Stanford professor!
invited him to visit the University 1
on his way home.
When Tresidder came to the I
campus, the pr (j 112 e s so r , R.' L. j
< Jreen of the department of math
ematics, offered him room and j
boar d in exchange for his services
as cook if he would stay at Stan
ford.
Cooking Job
The young student accepted the
job although he knew little about
cooking. So, he hired an Oriental j
to do the cooking until he picked
up the techniques. A long line of 1
pre • med students inherited the I
cook's job at the Green home,
from this beginning.
In 1917 Tresidder enlisted in a i
base hospital unit, but after some
months of service at Camp Pre-i
inorrt in Menlo Park, he trans- j
ferred to the air service of the
Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
After a year of training he was
graduated from the school of mil-1
itary aeronautics at the Univer-j
sity of California. Following fur
ther training in Texas and Illinois j
he was commissioned a second
lieutenant. He was serving with a 1
bombing squadron in Houston, j
Texas, when the war ended.
Back at Stanford
Back at Stanford after the war
Tresidder became an assistant in
the physiology department and
later in ihe anatomy department.
For his work in anatomy he was 1
elected to membership in Sigma
Xi, an honorary research society, i
He received the A.B. degree!
from Stanford in 1919. He then
moved to the Stanford Medical
School, becoming assistant in a
research on botulism a vital sub
ject affecting the public health
and the welfare and future of
parts of the canning industry.
Meanwhile, he had been spend-'

ing most of his summers working
at Yosemite. There he met Mary
Curry, daughter of the founders
of Camp Curry.
She had entered Stanford with
the class of 1916 but she com
pleted her undergraduate work in
English in three years, receiving
the A.B. degree in 1915 and the
A.M. degree in 1916.
Miss Curry was completing the
requirement for the Ph.D. degree
in English at Yale when her stud
ies were interrupted by a pro
posal of marriage from Tresidder.
They were married on June 16,
1920, at the site of LeConte Me
morial in Yosemite. Their honey
moon was a pack trip deep into
the Sierra. Mrs. Tresidder now
lives at her campus home at 415
(Jerona Koad.
Kecoim'S Camp Manager
In 1922, because of circum
stances ensuing from deaths in
the Curry family, Tresidder
turned aside from his medical
courses to become associate man
ager of the Yosemite camp. But
as the camp closed each fall dur
ing the years 1922 to 1925 lie
would return to his studies at the
medical school.
In 1925 the Secretary of the In
terior caused a consolidation of
all the companies operating in the
park. Tresidder became president
of the consolidated company
known as the Yosemite Park and
Curry Company. He held this po
sition for the remaining 23 years
of his life.
M.I). Degree
Although most of his time was
spent operating the Yosemite
firm, Tresidder was able to keep
up his medical studies and he re
ceived the M.D. degree in 1927.
But he never actively practiced
medicine.
Under Tresidder's guidance, the
company expanded to a capacity
for 3000 overnight guests plus fa

runner of today's Faculty Com
mittee on the Study of Under
graduate Education.
For his "outstanding eontribu
| tions lo higher education," he re
ceived the LL.D. degree from Po
mona College in 1944.
Early in the year of 19?H Tres
idder went to New York to at
tend a meeting of the Association
of American Universities and to
seek new faculty members. He
had iK'en encouraged by IJniver
: sity Chancellor Wilbur to "re-dc
velop the association which had
slackened pace under the wage of
war."
Although believed to be in per
fect health, Tresidder suffered a
heart attack and died in his St.
Regis Hotel room In New York
City on the evening of Jan. 28
. He was 53 years old.


DR. AM) MRS. DONALD TRESIDDER WITH THEIR AIRPLANE
He was believed to be the only president of a major university to l*.ly his .own plane.
"110 was a Stanford man in our
own Family."
That's the way Hay Lyman Wil
bur summed up the three and one
half year search for his successor
to the presidency of Stanford.
The man the Board of Trustees
unanimously selected was its own
president.
In fact, he was in the East at
the time interviewing possible
candidates who would follow such
men as David Starr Jordan, presi
dent from 1891 to 1913; John Cas
per Branner, 1913 to 1916; and
Wilbur, 1910 to 1913, as the Uni
versity's' fourth president.
Thus, Donald Bertram! Tresid
der, ClaSs of 1917, became the
fourth president of Leland Stan
lord Junior University.
He was born in the town of
Tipton, fnd., on April 7, 189-1, the
son of Dr. and Mrs. Treloar Ties-1
idder.
His father had come to the
United States from England in j
1885. Both his parents arid an
undo were practicing physicians. I
Physicians
Tresidder's earliest intention i
was to be a physician. As a small i
boy he would accompany his fa-!
ther as he made his rounds with
a horse and buggy. He received
his preliminary education in pub-!
lie school in Indiana.
At the age of 19 he taught all
grades in a one • room country i
school in Tipton. The following J
year he entered the University of!
('lm ago.
After- a year in a pre medical I
course at C ii i c a go , Tresidder
beaded for California with his |
sister on a vacation trip. The j
train was held up by a wreck and j
tie became acquainted with a rep- j
resentative of David A. Curry, an
educator who had established a
summer camp in Yosemite Na-:
t ional Par k.
This acquaintance led to a sum
mer's employment at Camp
Curry where a Stanford professor!
invited him to visit the University 1
on his way home.
When Tresidder came to the I
campus, the pr (j 112 e s so r , R.' L. j
< Jreen of the department of math
ematics, offered him room and j
boar d in exchange for his services
as cook if he would stay at Stan
ford.
Cooking Job
The young student accepted the
job although he knew little about
cooking. So, he hired an Oriental j
to do the cooking until he picked
up the techniques. A long line of 1
pre • med students inherited the I
cook's job at the Green home,
from this beginning.
In 1917 Tresidder enlisted in a i
base hospital unit, but after some
months of service at Camp Pre-i
inorrt in Menlo Park, he trans- j
ferred to the air service of the
Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
After a year of training he was
graduated from the school of mil-1
itary aeronautics at the Univer-j
sity of California. Following fur
ther training in Texas and Illinois j
he was commissioned a second
lieutenant. He was serving with a 1
bombing squadron in Houston, j
Texas, when the war ended.
Back at Stanford
Back at Stanford after the war
Tresidder became an assistant in
the physiology department and
later in ihe anatomy department.
For his work in anatomy he was 1
elected to membership in Sigma
Xi, an honorary research society, i
He received the A.B. degree!
from Stanford in 1919. He then
moved to the Stanford Medical
School, becoming assistant in a
research on botulism a vital sub
ject affecting the public health
and the welfare and future of
parts of the canning industry.
Meanwhile, he had been spend-'

ing most of his summers working
at Yosemite. There he met Mary
Curry, daughter of the founders
of Camp Curry.
She had entered Stanford with
the class of 1916 but she com
pleted her undergraduate work in
English in three years, receiving
the A.B. degree in 1915 and the
A.M. degree in 1916.
Miss Curry was completing the
requirement for the Ph.D. degree
in English at Yale when her stud
ies were interrupted by a pro
posal of marriage from Tresidder.
They were married on June 16,
1920, at the site of LeConte Me
morial in Yosemite. Their honey
moon was a pack trip deep into
the Sierra. Mrs. Tresidder now
lives at her campus home at 415
(Jerona Koad.
Kecoim'S Camp Manager
In 1922, because of circum
stances ensuing from deaths in
the Curry family, Tresidder
turned aside from his medical
courses to become associate man
ager of the Yosemite camp. But
as the camp closed each fall dur
ing the years 1922 to 1925 lie
would return to his studies at the
medical school.
In 1925 the Secretary of the In
terior caused a consolidation of
all the companies operating in the
park. Tresidder became president
of the consolidated company
known as the Yosemite Park and
Curry Company. He held this po
sition for the remaining 23 years
of his life.
M.I). Degree
Although most of his time was
spent operating the Yosemite
firm, Tresidder was able to keep
up his medical studies and he re
ceived the M.D. degree in 1927.
But he never actively practiced
medicine.
Under Tresidder's guidance, the
company expanded to a capacity
for 3000 overnight guests plus fa
cilities for many more daytime
visitors.
The Ahwahnee Hotel costing
over a million dollars was com
pleted in 1926. A chain of High
Sierra camps also was added to
the company's holdings which
opened the area of Yosemite
peaks and lakes to hikers.
He was primarily responsible
for popularizing Yosemite as a
skiing resqrt. Snow Creek Lodge
on the rim of the Valley was
opened in 1929 and Badger Pass
in 1935.
During his term as the firm's
president, the annual number of
guests rose from 300,348 in 1926
to 525,989 in 1948.
In 1939 Tresidder incurred a
throat infection which required
that he rest from the strenuous
activities as top executive of the
Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany and find a warmer climate.
The ailment persisted for two
years and much of the time was
spent near Stanford.
In December of that year he
was elected to the Stanford Board
of Trustees, becoming the Board's

youngest member. He returned to.
' his work at. Yosemite in 1941.
The next year he was elected
Board president. And on Jan. 21,
j 1943, while Tresidder was in the
j East looking for a replacement
: lor Ray Lyman Wilbur, the Board
i of Trustees unanimously elected !
I him to become Stanford's fourth !
i president. He had been reeom- 1
I mended to the Board by ail the
deans of the University's • 10
schools.
Tresidder took over as presi
dent on Sept. 1 without the for
mal ceremony which marked the
I inauguration of the three former
j presidents.
Upon taking office Tresidder I
j stated: ''The founders had a vis-!
i ion of a University greater than >
any then in existence. Dr. Jordan,
> willi his skill in selecting Ihe
right people, brought together the
! nucleus of a great faculty. Dr.'
i Wilbur developed and expanded
[Stanford into what it is today.!
|My job is to consolidate those
1 gains."
(beared to War
: In stepping intit his new role, j
he found Stanford a University
; geared to war. lis curriculum had j
i been streamlined, operating on a
I continuous session basis. The!
j laboratories were filled with war
research and the coeducational I
j student body enrollment was!
i down by 11 per cent.
The University had an enroll-1
ment of some 3500 students and !
! a faculty of more than 900. The
enrollment more than doubled
during his five and one-half years
! as president.
New deans for six of the Uni
versity's 10 schools were appoint
ed during his term of office. Fac
ulty recruitment was unusually
| heavy because of the enrollment
! increases caused by the impact of
j returning veterans to college fol
lowing the war.
In the spring of 1946 the to
tal enrollment approached 5000.
Tresidder realized that the rise
was only beginning and planned
for the next year's "temporary"
enrollment to be around 7000.
Stanford Village
At the time veterans were cre
ating unprecedented problems in
campus housing. Tresidder de
cided against trailers and de
mountable houses being sot do\Vn
on the campus and concentrated
on acquiring Dibble Hospital, a
semi-permanent War Department
facility located in Menlo Park
only three miles from the campus.
Two thousand students had
been admitted to the University
before the housing problem had
been solved. But in the summer
of 1916, Tresidder announced that
"our greatest gamble of all finally
paid off."
Custody of t?ie hospital was
gained on Aug. 1, and by late Sep
tember nearly 1200 students were
received into dormitories which
had been converted from the hos
pital wards.
Stanford Village, as the hospi

tal was renamed, became a com
munity of 325 families and 140(*
single students with "complete
village facilities."
Tresidder, being a successful
businessman, recognized that an
independent gift program is fun
damental to a university. During
his brief period as head of Stan
ford. a total of $7,217,000 was re
ceived by the University through
gifts, trusts and bequests.
Also, the student health serv
ices were unified and a plan pro
viding students with medical and
surgical care and necessary hos
pitalization was installed.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute was created under his guid-
I ance. It has established its use
! fulness to the industrial economy
j of the West Coast and proved a
means for relating, on a consult
| ing basis, the scientific knowledge
of members of the teaching fac
ulty to a full-time research staff
independent of the faculty.
Dean of Students
To co-ord\natje the University's
4he individual stu
: dent, he created the position of
dean of students and also added
a director of planning to cope
with the plfysidaj needs of the
caitVpiM < 1 k t i
Though primarily a business
executive at Ihe time he became
president of Stanford, Tresidder
rapidly gained recognition in the
field of education. One of his
most important positions as an
educator was as chairman of the
Western Regional Conference of
UNESCO.
During his first year as presi
dent he met with groups of the
faculty to discuss Stanford's pro
gram of undergraduate educa
tion. He wished "to explore the
contention that too great a de
pendence on the elective system
led undergraduate students into a
program of miscellaneous and
scattered courses."
Met With Faculty
A faculty committee was
formed to study the effectiveness
of undergraduate study with par
ticular emphasis on general edu
cation. This group is the fore>
runner of today's Faculty Com
mittee on the Study of Under
graduate Education.
For his "outstanding eontribu

terior caused a consolidation of
all the companies operating in the
park. Tresidder became president
of the consolidated company
known as the Yosemite Park and
Curry Company. He held this po
sition for the remaining 23 years
of his life.
M.I). Degree
Although most of his time was
spent operating the Yosemite
firm, Tresidder was able to keep
up his medical studies and he re
ceived the M.D. degree in 1927.
But he never actively practiced
medicine.
Under Tresidder's guidance, the
company expanded to a capacity
for 3000 overnight guests plus fa
cilities for many more daytime
visitors.
The Ahwahnee Hotel costing
over a million dollars was com
pleted in 1926. A chain of High
Sierra camps also was added to
the company's holdings which
opened the area of Yosemite
peaks and lakes to hikers.
He was primarily responsible
for popularizing Yosemite as a
skiing resqrt. Snow Creek Lodge
on the rim of the Valley was
opened in 1929 and Badger Pass
in 1935.
During his term as the firm's
president, the annual number of
guests rose from 300,348 in 1926
to 525,989 in 1948.
In 1939 Tresidder incurred a
throat infection which required
that he rest from the strenuous
activities as top executive of the
Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany and find a warmer climate.
The ailment persisted for two
years and much of the time was
spent near Stanford.
In December of that year he
was elected to the Stanford Board
of Trustees, becoming the Board's

youngest member. He returned to.
' his work at. Yosemite in 1941.
The next year he was elected
Board president. And on Jan. 21,
j 1943, while Tresidder was in the
j East looking for a replacement
: lor Ray Lyman Wilbur, the Board
i of Trustees unanimously elected !
I him to become Stanford's fourth !
i president. He had been reeom- 1
I mended to the Board by ail the
deans of the University's • 10
schools.
Tresidder took over as presi
dent on Sept. 1 without the for
mal ceremony which marked the
I inauguration of the three former
j presidents.
Upon taking office Tresidder I
j stated: ''The founders had a vis-!
i ion of a University greater than >
any then in existence. Dr. Jordan,
> willi his skill in selecting Ihe
right people, brought together the
! nucleus of a great faculty. Dr.'
i Wilbur developed and expanded
[Stanford into what it is today.!
|My job is to consolidate those
1 gains."
(beared to War
: In stepping intit his new role, j
he found Stanford a University
; geared to war. lis curriculum had j
i been streamlined, operating on a
I continuous session basis. The!
j laboratories were filled with war
research and the coeducational I
j student body enrollment was!
i down by 11 per cent.
The University had an enroll-1
ment of some 3500 students and !
! a faculty of more than 900. The
enrollment more than doubled
during his five and one-half years
! as president.
New deans for six of the Uni
versity's 10 schools were appoint
ed during his term of office. Fac
ulty recruitment was unusually
| heavy because of the enrollment
! increases caused by the impact of
j returning veterans to college fol
lowing the war.
In the spring of 1946 the to
tal enrollment approached 5000.
Tresidder realized that the rise
was only beginning and planned
for the next year's "temporary"
enrollment to be around 7000.
Stanford Village
At the time veterans were cre
ating unprecedented problems in
campus housing. Tresidder de
cided against trailers and de
mountable houses being sot do\Vn
on the campus and concentrated
on acquiring Dibble Hospital, a
semi-permanent War Department
facility located in Menlo Park
only three miles from the campus.
Two thousand students had
been admitted to the University
before the housing problem had
been solved. But in the summer
of 1916, Tresidder announced that
"our greatest gamble of all finally
paid off."
Custody of t?ie hospital was
gained on Aug. 1, and by late Sep
tember nearly 1200 students were
received into dormitories which
had been converted from the hos
pital wards.
Stanford Village, as the hospi

tal was renamed, became a com
munity of 325 families and 140(*
single students with "complete
village facilities."
Tresidder, being a successful
businessman, recognized that an
independent gift program is fun
damental to a university. During
his brief period as head of Stan
ford. a total of $7,217,000 was re
ceived by the University through
gifts, trusts and bequests.
Also, the student health serv
ices were unified and a plan pro
viding students with medical and
surgical care and necessary hos
pitalization was installed.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute was created under his guid-
I ance. It has established its use
! fulness to the industrial economy
j of the West Coast and proved a
means for relating, on a consult
| ing basis, the scientific knowledge
of members of the teaching fac
ulty to a full-time research staff
independent of the faculty.
Dean of Students
To co-ord\natje the University's
4he individual stu
: dent, he created the position of
dean of students and also added
a director of planning to cope
with the plfysidaj needs of the
caitVpiM < 1 k t i
Though primarily a business
executive at Ihe time he became
president of Stanford, Tresidder
rapidly gained recognition in the
field of education. One of his
most important positions as an
educator was as chairman of the
Western Regional Conference of
UNESCO.
During his first year as presi
dent he met with groups of the
faculty to discuss Stanford's pro
gram of undergraduate educa
tion. He wished "to explore the
contention that too great a de
pendence on the elective system
led undergraduate students into a
program of miscellaneous and
scattered courses."
Met With Faculty
A faculty committee was
formed to study the effectiveness
of undergraduate study with par
ticular emphasis on general edu
cation. This group is the fore>
runner of today's Faculty Com
mittee on the Study of Under
graduate Education.
For his "outstanding eontribu
| tions lo higher education," he re
ceived the LL.D. degree from Po
mona College in 1944.
Early in the year of 19?H Tres
idder went to New York to at
tend a meeting of the Association
of American Universities and to
seek new faculty members. He
had iK'en encouraged by IJniver
: sity Chancellor Wilbur to "re-dc
velop the association which had
slackened pace under the wage of
war."
Although believed to be in per
fect health, Tresidder suffered a
heart attack and died in his St.
Regis Hotel room In New York
City on the evening of Jan. 28
. He was 53 years old.


DR. AM) MRS. DONALD TRESIDDER WITH THEIR AIRPLANE
He was believed to be the only president of a major university to l*.ly his .own plane.
"110 was a Stanford man in our
own Family."
That's the way Hay Lyman Wil
bur summed up the three and one
half year search for his successor
to the presidency of Stanford.
The man the Board of Trustees
unanimously selected was its own
president.
In fact, he was in the East at
the time interviewing possible
candidates who would follow such
men as David Starr Jordan, presi
dent from 1891 to 1913; John Cas
per Branner, 1913 to 1916; and
Wilbur, 1910 to 1913, as the Uni
versity's' fourth president.
Thus, Donald Bertram! Tresid
der, ClaSs of 1917, became the
fourth president of Leland Stan
lord Junior University.
He was born in the town of
Tipton, fnd., on April 7, 189-1, the
son of Dr. and Mrs. Treloar Ties-1
idder.
His father had come to the
United States from England in j
1885. Both his parents arid an
undo were practicing physicians. I
Physicians
Tresidder's earliest intention i
was to be a physician. As a small i
boy he would accompany his fa-!
ther as he made his rounds with
a horse and buggy. He received
his preliminary education in pub-!
lie school in Indiana.
At the age of 19 he taught all
grades in a one • room country i
school in Tipton. The following J
year he entered the University of!
('lm ago.
After- a year in a pre medical I
course at C ii i c a go , Tresidder
beaded for California with his |
sister on a vacation trip. The j
train was held up by a wreck and j
tie became acquainted with a rep- j
resentative of David A. Curry, an
educator who had established a
summer camp in Yosemite Na-:
t ional Par k.
This acquaintance led to a sum
mer's employment at Camp
Curry where a Stanford professor!
invited him to visit the University 1
on his way home.
When Tresidder came to the I
campus, the pr (j 112 e s so r , R.' L. j
< Jreen of the department of math
ematics, offered him room and j
boar d in exchange for his services
as cook if he would stay at Stan
ford.
Cooking Job
The young student accepted the
job although he knew little about
cooking. So, he hired an Oriental j
to do the cooking until he picked
up the techniques. A long line of 1
pre • med students inherited the I
cook's job at the Green home,
from this beginning.
In 1917 Tresidder enlisted in a i
base hospital unit, but after some
months of service at Camp Pre-i
inorrt in Menlo Park, he trans- j
ferred to the air service of the
Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
After a year of training he was
graduated from the school of mil-1
itary aeronautics at the Univer-j
sity of California. Following fur
ther training in Texas and Illinois j
he was commissioned a second
lieutenant. He was serving with a 1
bombing squadron in Houston, j
Texas, when the war ended.
Back at Stanford
Back at Stanford after the war
Tresidder became an assistant in
the physiology department and
later in ihe anatomy department.
For his work in anatomy he was 1
elected to membership in Sigma
Xi, an honorary research society, i
He received the A.B. degree!
from Stanford in 1919. He then
moved to the Stanford Medical
School, becoming assistant in a
research on botulism a vital sub
ject affecting the public health
and the welfare and future of
parts of the canning industry.
Meanwhile, he had been spend-'

ing most of his summers working
at Yosemite. There he met Mary
Curry, daughter of the founders
of Camp Curry.
She had entered Stanford with
the class of 1916 but she com
pleted her undergraduate work in
English in three years, receiving
the A.B. degree in 1915 and the
A.M. degree in 1916.
Miss Curry was completing the
requirement for the Ph.D. degree
in English at Yale when her stud
ies were interrupted by a pro
posal of marriage from Tresidder.
They were married on June 16,
1920, at the site of LeConte Me
morial in Yosemite. Their honey
moon was a pack trip deep into
the Sierra. Mrs. Tresidder now
lives at her campus home at 415
(Jerona Koad.
Kecoim'S Camp Manager
In 1922, because of circum
stances ensuing from deaths in
the Curry family, Tresidder
turned aside from his medical
courses to become associate man
ager of the Yosemite camp. But
as the camp closed each fall dur
ing the years 1922 to 1925 lie
would return to his studies at the
medical school.
In 1925 the Secretary of the In
