# Art Critic Claims French Work Best 'Seen in Total'
## Jehanne Salinger Carlson Calls French Art 'Complementary' at IIR Cultural Discussion 
### 
French art can host he appreciated when seen in total, rather than
being studied in individual paintings and artists.
This opinion was expressed yesterday by Jehanne Salinger Carlson,
widely traveled*"art critic and connoisseur, when she discussed "Con
tributions oi France to Art" before a gathering in Bowman Alumni

House.
The talk was sponsored by IIR
Cultural Committee.
Elaborating on her statement,
Mrs. Carlson explained that other
nations' art is associated with spe
cific individuals such as Reubens
and Rembrandt.
French artists, on the other
hand, complement each other.
"What one does not have, the oth
er does," she noted.
Related to French
French art is closely related to
the French people themselves,
just as is the art of any other
group of people.
The French-born speaker gave
a "panorama" view of her subject,
noting many examples and show
ing how each related to the
French themselves and art as a
whole.
One of her illustrations con
cerned a French artist who grew
up as a peasant boy, and who
later became famous for his
paintings depicting peasant life.
She used this to point out the re
lationship between art and the
bourgeois, or common, man.
Realistic School
This was also an example of
the realistic school, in which art
ists try to paint life as it is, not
as it should be.
France, like any other nalion,
experienced fads in art, she said.
While realism would occupy the
throne for a while, it would be
forced to abdicate as another fad
surged in. Maybe the next cra/.e
would emphasize the French friv
olous spirit, she mentioned.
There were, of course, always a i
few artists who were "different"
during any particular fad. In
i many cases it was the individual
who started the next, popular I
j painting style.
Mrs. Carlson was questioned at |
the end of her talk as to why i
France did not produce as many!
great women artists as it did men. j
Men Favored
Her theory, she answered, was
that actually there were many
women who did work equally as
j well as men, but that society still
j favored men, and thus did not pay
i as much attention to women, in
; spite of their talent.
She felt this was true in all the
| professions.
The speaker acquired her inter-1
est as a child in Paris, when she j
was taken to the fine art galleries
and museums. Ironically, her pro
fessional criticisms of French art
rlid not begin until she reached
America, just after -she finished !
| college.
She said that in the limited time |
she could give o'nly the most |
rough sketch, but that since each
person should enjoy and interpret
art as he saw it, she hoped that
she was able to encourage each
member of the audience to fur
ther his own interest.
