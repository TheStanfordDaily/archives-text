# Tresidder's Election to Stanford Presidency Ended Three-Year Search
## 
### 
"TheYe is an old story about
those who sought their treasure
afar and were surprised upon
their return home to find what
they were looking for in their
own garden."
So said Ray Lyman Wilbur on
the selection of Donald B. Tresid
der as the fourth president of
Stanford University.
"A long search," Wilbur con
tinued, "for a new president for
Stanford University ends with the
selection of one of our most be
loved alumni, a Stanford man
through and through."
When University President Wil
bur reached the uge of 65 in 1940,
the Board til Trustees began their
search for a replacement.
Wilbur w;is persuaded to re
main as president until the end
of the 1942 school year, when he
assumed the duties of chancellor.
Tresidder was elected to the
Stanford Board of Trustees in
1939. lie became president of the
Board in December of 1942 and
was sent East to interview several
scholars who were being consid
ered as the possible successor to
Wilbur as president of the Uni
versity.

While Tresidder was in the East
the 10 deans of .the University's
schools submitted a'petition to

the Board recommending his elec
tion to the presidency.
In his contacts with faculty
members, Tresidder had impress
ed them with his "insight into
academic problems and his idealLs
for a University of high degree."
Several of the deans were mem
bers of an advisory faculty com
mittee which had already review
ed many candidates for the posi
tion.
The Board was unanimous in
their selection of Tresidder as the
fourth president of Leland Stan
ford Junior University on Jan. 21,
1943. They needed only his accept
ance when he returned from the
East.
He accepted the presidency and
immediately resigned as a mem
ber of the Board, since the found
ing grant prohibits the president
from being a Board member. He
took office on Sept. 1. .
