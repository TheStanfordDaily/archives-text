# Tresidder Meets 'Hello' Tradition
## 
### 
When Tresidder first arrived on
the Stanford campus he came into
contact with one of its oldest tra
ditions.
In later talks with the students
and his friends he would fre
quently mention his friendly wel
come and his first meeting with
a Stanford tradition—"the hello."
He arrived on the Farm for the
•first time in the fall of 1915 as "a
gangling, loosely knit Midwestern
youth whose coat sleeves failed
by several inches to cover the
length of his arms."
On that day he was walking up
Palm Drive, approaching Stan
ford for the first time and feel
ing very much an outlander. But
the uneasiness melted away as
one student after another called
a friendly "hello" to him as they
passed.
