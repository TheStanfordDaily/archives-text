# Indian Ruggers Open Season Against Bruins, Olympic Club
## 
### 
Rugby opens its sixth decade
on the Farm this afternoon at
3:30, when the Indians will take
on the Bruins of UCLA at the
rugby field.
Rugby took the place of foot
ball in 1900, when California and
Stanford both dropped American
football because there were too
many injuries.
Having had just one practice
scrimmage with Palo Alto's Ram
blers, coach Pete Kemetovic's
team is an unknown quantity.
However. 11 men ait returning
from last year's campaign, which
should contribute th; needed ex
perience for an interesting sea
son.
Opening in the forward posi
tions will be Noel Robinson at
hook, Joe Long and Donn Cars
well at front row, Ted Polich and

Paul Wiggin at second row, Dick
Jones at lock and Peter Macken
and Jim Rice at the breakaways.
Macken is an ASSL scholar from
England.
Back of these men will be John
Doyle at scrum half, Gordy
Young and Scott Jones at the five
eighths, Micky Raftery at the
center three-quarters, Dorsey At
kinson and Jack Taylor at the
wings, with bob Spare at full
back.
Opposing this aggregation will
be such standouts as Gil Moreno,
Jim Matheny, Bob Bergdahl, (Jer
ry Penner, Steve Palmer and Jim
Brown, all of whom played on the
UCLA Rose Bowl squad.
On Saturday the Indians will
host the Olympic Club at 2:30,
