Center," said S t a n 112 or d Coach
Wesley Huff," is where the Navy
is gathering its Olympic contest
ants."
Comparative scores also favor

through with wins were Likins
and Pitkin. For the frosh, Dick
Kruse, 107-pounder, scored a win
on a fall.

matmen. A 1 Northrup, four times
national champion at 157 pounds,
had an easy time overcoming

and 50 seconds before the power
ful champion pinned him.

sity of Minnesota star, won by
fall over Indian heavyweight A 1
