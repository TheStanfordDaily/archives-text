# Adlai Doesn't Believe Demos Against Him
## Trip Here Prevented Going to Secret Parley 
### United Press 
Presidential hopeful Adlai Ste
venson said yesterday he did not
believe reports that his Democrat
ic rivals were ganging up against
him, despite secret closed - door
huddles in New York between Av
erell Harriman, Estes Kefauver
and Harry S. Truman.
In fact, Stevenson said, if it had
not been for his present Califor
nia barnstorming junket he would
have joined the huddle himself.
Rumors that a "stop Stevenson"
movement was afoot arose in the
East yesterday when the New
York governor and the Tennessee
senator — both potential Demo
cratic candidates for President—
conferred in New York.
The meeting took place after
both had met separately with Mr.
Truman, who has served notice
he would play an important part
in the selection of the party's 1956
candidate.
Both Harriman and Kefauver
promptly denied the "stop Adlai"
rumor.
"We are all going to remain
friends so whomever gets the
nomination will have the support
of the fellows who had tried and
lost," Kefauver said.
Asked for his reaction to the
rumor that plots were hatching in
the East, Stevenson smilingly told
a news conference he had "no in
formation" on any such move
ment, and"I doubt very much
whether one exists."
He said he had previously been
invited to attend a Democratic
fund-raising dinner in New York
last night with Harriman and Ke
fauver, but had been forced to
skip it in favor of his Western
pre-primary tour.
"If it had not been for that, I
would undoubtedly have partici
pated in the New York meeting,"
he said.
