# Allied Decisions Won't Influence Arab-Israel Fight
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (U.R)â€”
Eight Arab nations served notice
today that they will refuse to let
the United States and Britain dic
tate any settlement of their bitter
dispute with Israel.
Lebanese Ambassador Dr. Vic
tor Khoury, who spent 30 minutes
with Assistant Secretary of State
George V. Allen, said he referred
to any M i dd 1 e East decisions
readied by President Eisenhower
and British Prime Minister An
thony Eden during their three
day conference here.
In a communique at the end of
the conference, the President and
Eden accused Russia and her sat
ellites of increasing the "risk of
war" between the Arab states and
Israel by shipping Red arms to
Egypt.
To "mitigate that risk." they
invited France to see what could
be done to prevent aggression,
either by the Arabs or the Jews.
F re n c h Ambassador Maurice
Couvc de Murville formally noti
fied the State Department late
today that his government had ac
cepted the invitation.
These talks presumably will go
into the advisability of sending
United Nations forces into demili
tarized buffer zones between Is
rael and her Arab neighbors.
The Western "Big Two" agreed
on principles but not on action,
Western diplomats complained in
their first cautious comments.
Failure to disclose a major Anglo-
American initiative in the Middle
East might strengthen Russian
ambitions in the troubled area,
(hoy said.
