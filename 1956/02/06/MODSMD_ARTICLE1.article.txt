# Sam McDonald Home Again; Relaxes Alter Five-Month Stint in PA Hospital
## Wheel Chair, TV Set Donated by Friends; 'New Life' for Sam 
### 
Emanuel B. "Sam" McDonald is
recuperating from his five months
of hospitalization, answering his
mail and watching television.
The 72-year-old former athletic
buildings and grounds director is
recovering from the amputation
of both his legs.
The TV set was rented for Sam
so he could watch the Big Game.
It brought him so much enjoy
ment that Mrs. Ruth Atwood, su
perintendent of the Stanford Con
valescent Home, started a fund
to buy it for him.
in a telephone poll of members
just before Christmas the Legis
lature decided to donate $100, ap
proximately half the cost of the
set.
Gifts, Donations
Gifts streamed in from all over
this area and throughout the
stale, according to Mrs. Atwood.
Enough money was raised to buy
Sam a new wheel chair in addi
tion to the TV set.
Relaxing in his home, which
has been remodeled so he can
move about easily in his wheel
chair, Sam said: "I feel as though
I've come back from another
world. I have a new life."
He finds it hard to decide how
to thank everyone for everything
they've done for him. "I've tried
to think how I would thank them.
But it just comes down to 'thank
you.' That's all I can say, but it
doesn't seem sufficient.
Just Say "Thank You"
"I keep wondering why I was
worthy of all this. I can just keep
saying 'thank you.' It takes time
to exemplify your thanks. But it's
like the continuous motion of a
car wheel—it lands you at your
destination finally."
. Sam feels better now than he
did three years ago. "I'm glad
they couldn't repair the legs, be
cause they wouldn't have been
able to completely repair them.
They were like old limbs on a
fruit tree—it was time to take
them off.
"One year from now I'll be a
new man. I figure on living a long
time.
Stormy Days
"I went through some stormy
days. The worst time was when
the legs were still on—the pain
was terrible. Many times I could
so easily have gone to sleep and
passed away.
"But I lived for my friends. I
felt how sad my friends would
feel if I passed away."
Sam is conscious of being closer
to the students than ever. "The
great organization is the student
body. But I feel concerned with
everyone connected with the Uni
versity. It's a new life and it
couldn't be better."
Sam, who has already written
one book, "Sam McDonal d's
Farm," plans to write another on
what he calls his "reincarnation."

one book, "Sam McDonal d's

what he calls his "reincarnation."

new television set, a gift from his friends at Stanford and ail over
the country. Sam is recuperating quietly from a five months' stay
in Palo Alto Hospital, during which time hi' had both legs ampu

Emanuel B. "Sam" McDonald is
recuperating from his five months
of hospitalization, answering his
mail and watching television.
The 72-year-old former athletic
buildings and grounds director is
recovering from the amputation
of both his legs.
The TV set was rented for Sam
so he could watch the Big Game.
It brought him so much enjoy
ment that Mrs. Ruth Atwood, su
perintendent of the Stanford Con
valescent Home, started a fund
to buy it for him.
in a telephone poll of members
just before Christmas the Legis
lature decided to donate $100, ap
proximately half the cost of the
set.
Gifts, Donations
Gifts streamed in from all over
this area and throughout the
stale, according to Mrs. Atwood.
Enough money was raised to buy
Sam a new wheel chair in addi
tion to the TV set.
Relaxing in his home, which
has been remodeled so he can
move about easily in his wheel
chair, Sam said: "I feel as though
I've come back from another
world. I have a new life."
He finds it hard to decide how
to thank everyone for everything
they've done for him. "I've tried
to think how I would thank them.
But it just comes down to 'thank
you.' That's all I can say, but it
doesn't seem sufficient.
Just Say "Thank You"
"I keep wondering why I was
worthy of all this. I can just keep
saying 'thank you.' It takes time
to exemplify your thanks. But it's
like the continuous motion of a
car wheel—it lands you at your
destination finally."
. Sam feels better now than he
did three years ago. "I'm glad
they couldn't repair the legs, be
cause they wouldn't have been
able to completely repair them.
They were like old limbs on a
fruit tree—it was time to take
them off.
"One year from now I'll be a
new man. I figure on living a long
time.
Stormy Days
"I went through some stormy
days. The worst time was when
the legs were still on—the pain
was terrible. Many times I could
so easily have gone to sleep and
passed away.
"But I lived for my friends. I
felt how sad my friends would
feel if I passed away."
Sam is conscious of being closer
to the students than ever. "The
great organization is the student
body. But I feel concerned with
everyone connected with the Uni
versity. It's a new life and it
couldn't be better."
