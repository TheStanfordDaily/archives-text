# BLAZE DESTROYED HOME ALMOST COMPLETELY
## Phi Dells Help at Sangiorgi Home, Salvage Part of Professor's Work 
### 
"I am very grateful; it's re
markable the way students have
rallied to help me in this great
tragedy," declared Professor Ro
berto Sangiorgi Saturday as he
watched members of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity search
through the blackened ruins of
his home.
The Phi Delts were attempting
to recover some of the lost manu
scripts, paintings and books in
Sangiorgi's home, at 538 May
field, which was almost complete

ly destroyed by fire last Sunday
evening.
"It was the idea of the whole
group," house president Neii !Pa
piano explained. "Instead of hav
ing the pledges work at the house
for the day, we thought we would
give the professor a hand. Almost
all the pledges and a great num
ber of the actives—about 30 alto
gether—are working here today."
"I've had many offers of help
from students and many letters'of
sympathy," said Sangiorgi, "but
this is the largest group by far."
Sangiorgi added that only a
small fraction of his collections,
which had taken him years to
build up, was being recovered.
A pledge brought him an antique
book with many of its pages al
most ashes. lie thumbed through
the pages, sadly shook his head
and threw the book on a pile of
rubbish to be carted away.
"Almost all of my upstairs li
brary was completely destroyed,"
he said. "We have only found a
small part of the book I was
working on.
"Very Graleful"
"I am very grateful that no
lives wore lost. My wife and I and
our three children were fortunate
ly out of the house when the fire
destroyed it.
"Wo had been in Walnut Creek
celebrating the return of some
good friends of ours from Eu
rope. It was quite a shock to re
turn to campus in a good mood
and be told that you had no
house."
Me paused and looked at those
working inside his house. "My
piano and all my music is gone.
But," he smiled as be stooped
down to |«ck up something, "this
was saved anyway." He held a
blank envelope with an air mail
stamp on it.
"Came lo Work''
lie walked out to the front
porch and asked three of the work
crew if they minded cleaning off
the front porch. "That's all right,"
came the reply, "we came here to
work."
Sangiorgi explained that hr was
looking for a temporary home
now, but he eventually planned
to rebuild his ruined house. "I
love this place; it's a wonderful
location. And everyone is so
friendly."
How much of a job of rebuild
ing was ahead depended upon a
report by the building inspector,
lie explained. Damage hy the fire

has been estimated at $35,000 by
Stanford fire chief John Marston.
It is thought that the blaze was
caused by a furnace.
The fire was reported at 8:15
p.m. Sunday night by Sangiorgi's
neighbor, Dr. Jay Ward Smith.
By the time the fire department
had arrived and put out the fire,
only the charred skeleton of the
white stucco house remained.

A HELPING HAND is given by several mem
bers of Ihe Phi Delta Tlieta house during their
workday last Saturday as they aid in salvaging
important papers and personal belongings from

field home. The fire, which almost completely
destroyed the Sangiorgi residence eight days
