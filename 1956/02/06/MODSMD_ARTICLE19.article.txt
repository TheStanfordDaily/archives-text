Attacks arc often leveled against Stanford
fraternities for doing little of a positive or con*
structive nature to merit :heir retention on rani
pus.
While this may or may not he true, members
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity deserve hearty
commendation for volunteering to help Profes
sor Roberto Sangiorgi recover remnants of his
past belongings destroyed by fire last Sunday
evening.
Such a gesture was truly in the spirit of Stan
ford University.
Hut it will mean nothing if it stands as an
isolated instance in the rather bleak history of
Stanford fraternities —if it is applauded today
and forgotten tomorrow.
Two years ago Alpha Kappa Lambda con
verted their hell week energy into painting the
boat house. All agreed that it was a commend
able effort, but little has been done to perpetu
ate the "help" tradition.
The Phi Delts have set an example of what
can be done if fraternities turn their attention

toward more worthwhile endeavors than paint
ing statues and plaguing new pledges.
Their generosity in helping the Sangiorgis
can be the start of new efforts on the part of all
fraternities to be more than an exclusive social
entity with no constructive value to the Univer
sity as a whole.
According to Phi Delt president Neil Pa
piano, the whole group supported the idea and
about 30 members, including many actives as
well as pledges, voluntarily spent Saturday
working at the Sangiorgi house.
If it takes weeks, they intend to continue the
job until it is finished, Papiano said.
Fraternities needn't be at a loss io find things
to do around campus.
The temporary buildings badly need a few
coats of paint.
Individual work on charity drives and relief
is always needed. *
Such willingness as that shown by the Phi
Delts is a significant testimony to the potential
of fraternity organization. We hope that this
potential will materialize.
