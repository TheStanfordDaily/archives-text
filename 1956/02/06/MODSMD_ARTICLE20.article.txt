# Hope Is Dimming
## 
### 
"Yea hey, yea lio, Autherine has got to go."
That was the "battle cry"' of a group of Amer
ican college students yesterday. They were
demonstrating against the enrollment of a fel
low American in the University of Alabama.
And why were they protesting? Because the
student, Autherine Lucy, is a Negro. This from
American college students, the so-called "lead
ers of tomorrow.*"
Unfortunately much of the deep South has
long been saddled with bigoted, narrow-minded
leadership.
But there was hope for the future when these
leaders would be replaced by the new group of
college-trained "leaders of tomorrow."
That hope becomes dim when we are forced
to witness such spectacles as that at Alabama.
Not only is such demonstration retrogressive,
it is also another black mark against the United

States in its attempt at smoother international
relations.
A college education that cannot even teach
its students simple tolerance and a sense of
fair play is not a college education.
The University of Alabama is certainly not
a unique case. Latest reports from Louisiana
State University say the college board of super
visors has instructed the athletic director to
put a color clause in all sports contracts.
They also plan to institute enrollment devices
with the end of keeping colored students out.
We hope those responsible for these sad
commentaries on American education will soon
turn to the facts of fair play and tolerance for
their actions.
L T ntil then the University of Alabama and
the state university of Louisiana will not be
worthy of the name university.
