# This Week on Quad
## 
### Ric Teague 
Three great talent shows headline this week's
entertainment bili-of-fare for Joe and Jane
Stanford—one starling Wednesday, one Thurs
day and one sort of never-ending. More of that
later, but now, a chronological prospectus for
the activities major.
* « *
Monday may seem slow to some, but not to
the School of Mineral Sciences Journal Club
which throws its doors open this afternoon at
4 so no one will have to miss their discussion
of "Chamositic Iron Ore Deposits of Western
Macedonia." Not to be outdone, the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences invites "students,
faculty and visitors" to a seihinar concerning
"Action Spectra of Phototaxis in Some Motile
Green Algae and Dinoflageliates." Doors open
at 4:15 p.m.
# # *
Tomorrow night the Tuesday Evening Series
will bring Krling Norlev, author and foreign
policv commentator who -uccived an LL.B. de
gree University of Copenhagen, to the
Mem Aud lectern to address series-goers on
"Denmark Today."
* * *
Foreign travelers and students living in some
of the less sanitary corners of the Farm will
find interest in the incidental intelligence that
the Student Health Committee will continue its
free immunization service tomorrow in the
Health Service nurses' office from 1 to 5 p.m.
* * *
Wednesday, and enough talent on display to
sate the appetite of Major Bowies' Amateur
Hour. The ASSU Legislature will hold its tal
ent show as LASSU tries to lasso Robert's Rules
of Order and wrassel 'em to the mat. Robert's
Rules are favorites to take it two falls out of
th ree. The public is invited—and should at
tend. Same time, same station. . . .
* # #
VI bile the legislators struggle with their
consciences, student lawyers will battle it out
in the opening show of three days of Moot
Court competition. The public is invited. 7
p.m. at the Law School.
# » «
Most of the real talent on display this week
waits for Thursday evening to show itself. The
Foreign Student Talent Show gets ofT on a three
day run at 8 p.m. in the Little Theater of Me
morial Ilall. The price is right—one buck—

The Foreign Student Talent Show
And LASSU—an Entertaining Week
and the place is convenient. Sounds like it's
worth dropping in to take a look.
* -# *
That same evening the Thursday Film Series
presents "Incorrigible," another in a series of
1• D, monocolor, narrow • screen talkies. The
film stars the top-flight duo of Stig Olin and
Marianne Lofgren.
* * *
Friday, Intermezzo continues its fine pro
gram with a discussion of Ernest Chausson and
his music, by Dr. Leo Weinstein, assistant pro
fessor of French. Dr. Weinstein knows the sub
ject—co-authored a book on it—so if you're in
college for culture, don't miss it. It's free and
open to the public. 4:15 p.m. in the Jones
Room, Main Library.
* * *
A real sleeper Friday afternoon: "Liberty,
Equality and Algebra," a discussion by Uni
versity of Chicago Professor Paul R. Halmos.
Sounds like a discussion of academic social dis
crimination. or something. It's sponsored by
the Berkeley-Stanford Colloquium in Logic and
Methodology and the announcement invites all
interested persons.
* * *
Friday night at 8. the hair-on-the-chest smell
of sweat socks and frozen orange juice returns
to the Pavilion after a two-week absence. Little
George Selleck (5-8) will lead his Stanfords
against illie (The Whale) Naulls and UCLA.
Formidable opposition. Last year in the first
game of the two-game series, Selleck, Barry
Brown, Bill Bond, Ron Tomsic and Russ Lawler
lasted the entire game without a substitution to
wear UCLA right through the floor. Can they
do it this year? They'll be back at it Saturday
night.
# * *
Next Sunday's flick should clean tip the bad
air left by last night's dud. "Dial 'M' for Mur
der" with Grace Kelly and Ray Milland, a
really good picture that everybody's seen twice
already.
# »#
Quote of the week (take note, LASSLI) :
"All labor, yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess.
Look at the end of the work, contrast
The petty done, the undone vast,
This present of theirs with the hopeful
past."

Three great talent shows headline this week's
entertainment bili-of-fare for Joe and Jane
Stanford—one starling Wednesday, one Thurs
day and one sort of never-ending. More of that
later, but now, a chronological prospectus for
the activities major.
* « *
Monday may seem slow to some, but not to
the School of Mineral Sciences Journal Club
which throws its doors open this afternoon at
4 so no one will have to miss their discussion
of "Chamositic Iron Ore Deposits of Western
Macedonia." Not to be outdone, the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences invites "students,
faculty and visitors" to a seihinar concerning
"Action Spectra of Phototaxis in Some Motile
Green Algae and Dinoflageliates." Doors open
at 4:15 p.m.
# # *
Tomorrow night the Tuesday Evening Series
will bring Krling Norlev, author and foreign
policv commentator who -uccived an LL.B. de
gree University of Copenhagen, to the
Mem Aud lectern to address series-goers on
"Denmark Today."
* * *
Foreign travelers and students living in some
of the less sanitary corners of the Farm will
find interest in the incidental intelligence that
the Student Health Committee will continue its
free immunization service tomorrow in the
Health Service nurses' office from 1 to 5 p.m.
* * *
Wednesday, and enough talent on display to
sate the appetite of Major Bowies' Amateur
Hour. The ASSU Legislature will hold its tal
ent show as LASSU tries to lasso Robert's Rules
of Order and wrassel 'em to the mat. Robert's
Rules are favorites to take it two falls out of
th ree. The public is invited—and should at
tend. Same time, same station. . . .
* # #
VI bile the legislators struggle with their
consciences, student lawyers will battle it out
in the opening show of three days of Moot
Court competition. The public is invited. 7
p.m. at the Law School.

Most of the real talent on display this week
waits for Thursday evening to show itself. The
Foreign Student Talent Show gets ofT on a three
day run at 8 p.m. in the Little Theater of Me
morial Ilall. The price is right—one buck—

The Foreign Student Talent Show
And LASSU—an Entertaining Week
and the place is convenient. Sounds like it's
worth dropping in to take a look.
* -# *
That same evening the Thursday Film Series
presents "Incorrigible," another in a series of
1• D, monocolor, narrow • screen talkies. The
film stars the top-flight duo of Stig Olin and
Marianne Lofgren.
* * *
Friday, Intermezzo continues its fine pro
gram with a discussion of Ernest Chausson and
his music, by Dr. Leo Weinstein, assistant pro
fessor of French. Dr. Weinstein knows the sub
ject—co-authored a book on it—so if you're in
college for culture, don't miss it. It's free and
open to the public. 4:15 p.m. in the Jones
Room, Main Library.
* * *
A real sleeper Friday afternoon: "Liberty,
Equality and Algebra," a discussion by Uni
versity of Chicago Professor Paul R. Halmos.
Sounds like a discussion of academic social dis
crimination. or something. It's sponsored by
the Berkeley-Stanford Colloquium in Logic and
Methodology and the announcement invites all
interested persons.
* * *
Friday night at 8. the hair-on-the-chest smell
of sweat socks and frozen orange juice returns
to the Pavilion after a two-week absence. Little
George Selleck (5-8) will lead his Stanfords
against illie (The Whale) Naulls and UCLA.
Formidable opposition. Last year in the first
game of the two-game series, Selleck, Barry
Brown, Bill Bond, Ron Tomsic and Russ Lawler
lasted the entire game without a substitution to
wear UCLA right through the floor. Can they
do it this year? They'll be back at it Saturday
night.
# * *
Next Sunday's flick should clean tip the bad
air left by last night's dud. "Dial 'M' for Mur
der" with Grace Kelly and Ray Milland, a
really good picture that everybody's seen twice
already.

"All labor, yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess.
Look at the end of the work, contrast
The petty done, the undone vast,
This present of theirs with the hopeful
past."
Robert Browmnc
Three great talent shows headline this week's
entertainment bili-of-fare for Joe and Jane
Stanford—one starling Wednesday, one Thurs
day and one sort of never-ending. More of that
later, but now, a chronological prospectus for
the activities major.

Monday may seem slow to some, but not to
the School of Mineral Sciences Journal Club
which throws its doors open this afternoon at
4 so no one will have to miss their discussion
of "Chamositic Iron Ore Deposits of Western
Macedonia." Not to be outdone, the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences invites "students,
faculty and visitors" to a seihinar concerning
"Action Spectra of Phototaxis in Some Motile
Green Algae and Dinoflageliates." Doors open
at 4:15 p.m.

Tomorrow night the Tuesday Evening Series
will bring Krling Norlev, author and foreign
policv commentator who -uccived an LL.B. de
gree University of Copenhagen, to the
Mem Aud lectern to address series-goers on
"Denmark Today."

Foreign travelers and students living in some
of the less sanitary corners of the Farm will
find interest in the incidental intelligence that
the Student Health Committee will continue its
free immunization service tomorrow in the
Health Service nurses' office from 1 to 5 p.m.
* * *
Wednesday, and enough talent on display to
sate the appetite of Major Bowies' Amateur
Hour. The ASSU Legislature will hold its tal
ent show as LASSU tries to lasso Robert's Rules
of Order and wrassel 'em to the mat. Robert's
Rules are favorites to take it two falls out of
th ree. The public is invited—and should at
tend. Same time, same station. . . .
* # #
VI bile the legislators struggle with their
consciences, student lawyers will battle it out
in the opening show of three days of Moot
Court competition. The public is invited. 7
p.m. at the Law School.

Most of the real talent on display this week
waits for Thursday evening to show itself. The
Foreign Student Talent Show gets ofT on a three
day run at 8 p.m. in the Little Theater of Me
morial Ilall. The price is right—one buck—

The Foreign Student Talent Show
And LASSU—an Entertaining Week
and the place is convenient. Sounds like it's
worth dropping in to take a look.

That same evening the Thursday Film Series
presents "Incorrigible," another in a series of
1• D, monocolor, narrow • screen talkies. The
film stars the top-flight duo of Stig Olin and
Marianne Lofgren.
* * *
Friday, Intermezzo continues its fine pro
gram with a discussion of Ernest Chausson and
his music, by Dr. Leo Weinstein, assistant pro
fessor of French. Dr. Weinstein knows the sub
ject—co-authored a book on it—so if you're in
college for culture, don't miss it. It's free and
open to the public. 4:15 p.m. in the Jones
Room, Main Library.
* * *
A real sleeper Friday afternoon: "Liberty,
Equality and Algebra," a discussion by Uni
versity of Chicago Professor Paul R. Halmos.
Sounds like a discussion of academic social dis
crimination. or something. It's sponsored by
the Berkeley-Stanford Colloquium in Logic and
Methodology and the announcement invites all
interested persons.
* * *
Friday night at 8. the hair-on-the-chest smell
of sweat socks and frozen orange juice returns
to the Pavilion after a two-week absence. Little
George Selleck (5-8) will lead his Stanfords
against illie (The Whale) Naulls and UCLA.
Formidable opposition. Last year in the first
game of the two-game series, Selleck, Barry
Brown, Bill Bond, Ron Tomsic and Russ Lawler
lasted the entire game without a substitution to
wear UCLA right through the floor. Can they
do it this year? They'll be back at it Saturday
night.
# * *
Next Sunday's flick should clean tip the bad
air left by last night's dud. "Dial 'M' for Mur
der" with Grace Kelly and Ray Milland, a
really good picture that everybody's seen twice
already.
