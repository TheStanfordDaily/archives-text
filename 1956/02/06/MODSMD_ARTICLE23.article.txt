# Swedish Lenses Capture Scenery; Plot Gets Away
## 'Illicit Interlude's' Story Simple, But 'Childish' Symbols Burden Plot; Film Saved by Camera 
### Dick Mende 
Nearly anything illicit interests me but the title and advertisements
notwithstanding, the chief attraction of the film at the Guild is an
extraordinary camera technique unmatched by American movie
makers.
In "Illicit Interlude" the camera lingers over the landscape captur-

ing the stillness and suggesting
that the quietness and beauty of
Sweden are reflected in her peo
ple.
Like the picture before it, "Il
licit Interlude" has an extremely
simple story, a summer romance
between a boy and a girl, but in
attaching ot'he r meanings and
symbols in two scenes, at the be
ginning and end, the picture be
came clumsy.
"FORGET DEATH"
A ballerina is shown to have
escaped into the theatrical world
to forget the death of her friend,
who died accidentally after their
summer affair.
This refusal to face reality is
posed in an opening scene and is
resolved unimaginatively after
the long flashback sequence,
when the ballerina removes the
symbolic greasepaint and goes off
to marry a reporter.
The main body of the film is
simple, too, to the point of being
silly. The symbols are childish.
For example, the "brooding black
depths" that the boy felt sepa
rated the lovers turn out to be an
accidental death having nothing
to do with the character or a
dramatically tragic fate.
Familiar Figure
There is also a familiar fig
ure in the uncle, a drunk and om
nipresent nuisance; he's cultured
and the drinking is pitiful and all
that.
But if the external story is trite,
the camera technique is able to
suggest that the Swedish people,
like their land, are vigorous, re
lective, brooding and perhaps mel
ancholy.
Besides, the love scenes are
fresh and powerful and are unlike
French love affairs, which seem
always shrouded in a depraved
atmosphere.
Those who have seen "One
Summer of Happiness" will prob
ably be disappointed in this sec
ond film, which seems like a sec
ond-rate imitation. But it is above
the mark of. many imports and
refreshing when compared to
many second-run American films.
