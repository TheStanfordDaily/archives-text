# Demo Convention Sparked By Stevenson, Kefauver
## Richards Gets Nod for Senate Nomination; Yorty to Enter Primary Despite CDC Killing 
### Helen Dewar 
FRESNO Amid thundering applause and boisterous party spirit,
Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver, two Democratic Presidential
hopefuls, made strong personal bids here this weekend for the 68-
vote delegation at stake in the June 5 state primaries.
While the two rivals viewed each other cordially and stressed the

•necessity of party unity for the
inter-party battle that lay ahead,
Senatorial candidate Sam Yorty
lashed bitterly at supporters of
his youthful opponent, Richard
Richards, for having "wired,
stacked, rigged and packed" the
convention before which he was
speaking.
Indignant delegates rose imme
diately to protest the ex-Congress
man's vitriolic assault and later
cheered Richards when he at
tested that "no one is bigger than
the Democratic party and no
larger cross-section of the party
has been assembled in California
than is assembled now."
This meeting of the California
Democratic Council, composed of
delegates from Democratic clubs
throughout the state, later over
whelmingly endorsed Richards
for the Senate bid.
Yorty Threat
Yorty had stated earlier that he
would run even if he did not re
ceive CDC endorsement and was
further angered when the conven
tion moved Saturday to prevent
him from carrying out his threat.
Yesterday Yorty bolted the
CDC, announcing that he would
not withdraw from the race.
The convention was attended
by about 15 Stanford students and
faculty members, several of
whom were district delegates.
The Sleeping Giant
Earlier in the day Stevenson,
harking to the California Demo
cratic party as a "sleeping giant"
just now awaking, received a re
sounding five - minute ovation
when he descended from the po
dium into the applauding throng
of 2000 to 2500 Democrats.
The Illinois ex - governor
stressed "restraint and responsi
bility of emphasis and tone" in his
coming campaign and remarked
that he had "an allergy to hollow
promises."
Attacks (iOP
lie flid not hesitate to shoot
barbs at the Republican Adminis
tration charging that it "moved
grudgingly, giving half answers
to hard problems."
"And in these days," he jibed,
"the typical Republican document
proclaims that America has no
problems and then goes to pro
pose Democratic solutions for
them."
In a charge against Administra
tion handling of foreign policy,
Stevenson advised that if it "has
If) do more bragging, it would be
better to boast about resolute
marches to the brink of peace
than to the brink of war."
Kefauver, who spoke earlier in
the day, received a warm wel
come, but a welcome hardly
matching the jubilance with
which Stevenson greeted.
Intending to enter primaries in
California, New Hampshire. Flor

it "would not win on any watered

about every field of activity.

which Stevenson greeted.
Intending to enter primaries in
California, New Hampshire. Flor
ida, Wisconsin and Minnesota, the
popular Ten nessee Senator
warned the Democratic party that
it "would not win on any watered
flown program" and proceeded to
knork the Administration on just
about every field of activity.
FRESNO Amid thundering applause and boisterous party spirit,
Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver, two Democratic Presidential
hopefuls, made strong personal bids here this weekend for the 68-
vote delegation at stake in the June 5 state primaries.
While the two rivals viewed each other cordially and stressed the

•necessity of party unity for the
inter-party battle that lay ahead,
Senatorial candidate Sam Yorty
lashed bitterly at supporters of
his youthful opponent, Richard
Richards, for having "wired,
stacked, rigged and packed" the
convention before which he was
speaking.
Indignant delegates rose imme
diately to protest the ex-Congress
man's vitriolic assault and later
cheered Richards when he at
tested that "no one is bigger than
the Democratic party and no
larger cross-section of the party
has been assembled in California
than is assembled now."
This meeting of the California
Democratic Council, composed of
delegates from Democratic clubs
throughout the state, later over
whelmingly endorsed Richards
for the Senate bid.
Yorty Threat
Yorty had stated earlier that he
would run even if he did not re
ceive CDC endorsement and was
further angered when the conven
tion moved Saturday to prevent
him from carrying out his threat.
Yesterday Yorty bolted the
CDC, announcing that he would
not withdraw from the race.
The convention was attended
by about 15 Stanford students and
faculty members, several of
whom were district delegates.
The Sleeping Giant
Earlier in the day Stevenson,
harking to the California Demo
cratic party as a "sleeping giant"
just now awaking, received a re
sounding five - minute ovation
when he descended from the po
dium into the applauding throng
of 2000 to 2500 Democrats.
The Illinois ex - governor
stressed "restraint and responsi
bility of emphasis and tone" in his
coming campaign and remarked
that he had "an allergy to hollow
promises."
