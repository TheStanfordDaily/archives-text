nally booted a penalty kick- to
make the score G O, but Ed Culin
of the Clubbers made a 25-yard
kick with five minutes remaining
to bring the margin back to three
points.

game up with 30 seconds to play
when Stanford committed anoth
er foul, but his penalty kick fell
about five yards short.


BATTLING IN SCRUM for possession of the ball, Stanford and
the Olympic Club execute what is similar to a jump ball in basket
ball in Saturday's rugby contest. The Indian ruggers nipped the
Winged O team, 6*3. 'I be idea in a scrum is to push the other team
backward in order to kick the ball back to your own backfield.—
