# Three Sentenced To 30 Hours Each By Men's Council
## 
### 
Men's Council found three men
guilty of a Fundamental Standard
violation last week. The men ad
mitted they had entered a wom
en's residence after closing hours
and caused minor damage.
They were each sentenced to 30
hours of work at the Convales
cent Home and placed on proba
tion until the end of spring quar
ter.
The incident occurred after a
party when the three men were
bringing a woman back to her
residence. They walked her to the
door about 2:30 a.m., and then fol
lowed her into the house when
she unlocked the door.
One of the men began to play
the piano, awakening residents
upstairs, and before the three left,
about five minutes later, some
minor destruction had occurred.
Several candles were broken, and
(he intruders took a trophy with
them when they left. The trophy,
however, was retur ned with apol
ogies the next day.
The council found the defend
ants guilty on four counts: enter
ing a women's residence after
closing hours, destruction, theft
of a trophy and general miscon
duct.
