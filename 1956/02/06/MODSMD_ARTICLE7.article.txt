The Stanford Daily played
tin* "good Samaritan" for two
young men from the Daily Cali
fornian yesterday.
It seems that their photo
engravers decided not to work
this weekend and the gentlemen
were facing the dilemma of a
paper sans pictures.
The only newspaper that they
could think of that used a non
engraving process for pictures
was their arch-rival on the Pe
n in s ii I a and, therefore, two
members of the sports depart
ment staff made the long trek
to Stanford.
The Daily photographic staff
happily ran off their picture—a
shot of Ihe Cal-Orcgon basket
ball game—anil sent them back
with (we hope) a nicer opinion
of Stanford.
