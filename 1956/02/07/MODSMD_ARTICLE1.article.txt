million is expected to be raised by the end of the school year,

Winbigler said.
The committee which makes
plans for the now student activi
ties center is headed by Winbigler
and is composed of Kenneth Cuth
bertson, assistant to president;
Professor of Law George E. Os
borne, Bill Tooley, student finan
cial manager, and ASSU Presi
dent George Ralph.
All plans and ideas are drawn
up by Eldridge T. Spencer, Stan
ford Director of Planning, who
sits in on the committee meetings.
"At present the committee is
still hammering out problems
about the union," said Winbigler.
"We must keep improving until
there can't be any improvements
made.
Unique Plan
"We want to plan a student cen
ter that is unique to Stanford.
Most universities have one tall
building for their student center.
What we have planned is a de
centralized arrangement with sev
eral low buildings."
He went on to explain that the
union would be located in back of
the present one and across the
street from it. The present build
ing across the street from the
post office is being torn down to
make way for one of the union
buildings, a student music center.
"We will keep the old buildings
and remodel them to go in with
the new ( units," Winbigler ex
plained.
Women's Clubhouse
"We have all the student offices
planned and are now trying to de
cide on some of the other build
ings. This week we are deliberat
ing on the question of whether or
not we should have a women's
clubhouse.
"Student needs and desires
change from year to year, so we
have to spend the first months
of every year finding out what
this year's student body wants in
the building. However, plans are
getting more and more definite.
A bowling alley will probably be
included in one of the new build
ings."
The Tresidder Memorial Union
fund was set up by the Board of
Trustees in 1918. At the time, a
number of gifts were received
from friends of Tresidder. The
fund has now risen to $911,889.
Approximately $1,600,000 is need
ed for construction.
Last academic year $122,240.22
was raised from four sources:
profits from old uni0n—555,462.-

ford Director of Planning, who
sits in on the committee meetings.
"At present the committee is
still hammering out problems
about the union," said Winbigler.
"We must keep improving until
there can't be any improvements
made.
Unique Plan
"We want to plan a student cen
ter that is unique to Stanford.
Most universities have one tall
building for their student center.
What we have planned is a de
centralized arrangement with sev
eral low buildings."
He went on to explain that the
union would be located in back of
the present one and across the
street from it. The present build
ing across the street from the
post office is being torn down to
make way for one of the union
buildings, a student music center.
"We will keep the old buildings
and remodel them to go in with
the new ( units," Winbigler ex
plained.
Women's Clubhouse
"We have all the student offices
planned and are now trying to de
cide on some of the other build
ings. This week we are deliberat
ing on the question of whether or
not we should have a women's
clubhouse.
"Student needs and desires
change from year to year, so we
have to spend the first months
of every year finding out what
this year's student body wants in
the building. However, plans are
getting more and more definite.
A bowling alley will probably be
included in one of the new build
ings."
