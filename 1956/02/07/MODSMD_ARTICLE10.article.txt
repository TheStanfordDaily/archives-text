## 1000 Students Storm President’s Home; Hurt Eggs at Wife, Police 
### 
TUSCALOOSA. Ala., Feb. 6 (U.P) The University of Alabama trus
tees voted tonight to bar temporarily from classes the school's first
Negro student a; whom rioters threw stones and eggs in a riot that
brought a plea for National Guardsmen to restore order.
Governor James E. Folsom refused university president O. ('. Car-

Michael's request for troops, say
ing, "Wo arc not excited."
Folsom's statement, distributed
by Executive Secretary Ralph
Hammond, said "it is normal for
all races not to be overly fond of
each other," including "black,
white, yellow and red races."
The trustees then voted unani
mously as a safety measure to
prevent the student, Miss Author
ine Lucy of Birmingham, from
attending classes for a while.
The action followed three tense
days of riots, climaxed by today's
riot in .which university police,
state highway patrolmen and
friends of the Negro woman spir
ited her to safety while rioters
pelted decoy autos with stones
and eggs.
Third Demonstration
Not knowing about the trus
tees' action, some 500 students
broke into the third straight mid
night demonstration tonight and
rode through Tuscaloosa in a 100-
car motorcade.
An estimated 1000 students
stormed the executive mansion of
President Carmiehael at midnight
and someone threw an egg at
Mrs. Carmiehael when she pro
tested he was not at home. The
egg did not hit her.
University Police Chief Allen
Rayfield and a handful of stu
dents formed a cordon to conduct
her fcjaek inside the house. Some
one threw a handful of gravel
upon the porch.
There were shouts of "Are you
a nigger-lover?"
The crowd Ihen marched to an
other part of the campus.
Earlier the demonstrators pelt
ed Tuscaloosa Police Chief W. C.
Tompkins with two eggs.
College May Close
Several hundred students sign
ed a petition calling on President
Carmiehael to expel student lead
ers of the riots, saying they dis
credited the entire university.
President Carmiehael said the
college might have to close "if we
cannot operate under law and or
der." He said he had been inform
ed a new demonstration tonight
m ig h t "make the others look
small."
The Governor said he and sev
: eral million servicemen who have
j traveled over the world have ob-
I served these racial differences
i and added thai the demonstra
j lions at Alabama are "a result of
| such feelings."
"We are not excited. We are
not alarmists, but in any event
we do stand ready at all times to
meet with any situation prop
erly," he said. But he didn't elab
orate on how he planned to take
care of the situation.
Some 500 students began their
third mass demonstration tonight
shortly after Alabama's basket
ball team had beaten Vanderbilt
88-61.
100 Car Motorcade
A crowd, chanting "Hey, hey,
ho, ho, where in the hell did the
nigger go?" gathered in front of
the student union building. As
the crowd grew, the students got
into about 100 automobiles and
drove downtown in a motorcade.
Three local residents, none of
them a student, were arrested and
charged with disorderly conduct
in connection with today's rock
j and egg throwing.
Miss Lucy's whereabouts were
i not revealed for a time following
the campus riot but her attorney,
I Negro Arthur Shores of Binning*

,Ho miles to the university, said
! she returned there and was taken
to the country" away from poo

An officer said: "We had a few
rough moments today, but I think
! we came out all right. Miss Lucy
j was not touched or harmed."
Fourteen state highway patrol
men helped the local force.
Eggs and mud as well as rocks

The Nf'gro student was barred from classes last night in a sj)."< iml
meeting of University trustees after the president requested Na
tional Guardsmen to quell rioting anti-Negro students.
TUSCALOOSA. Ala., Feb. 6 (U.P) The University of Alabama trus
tees voted tonight to bar temporarily from classes the school's first
Negro student a; whom rioters threw stones and eggs in a riot that
brought a plea for National Guardsmen to restore order.
Governor James E. Folsom refused university president O. ('. Car-

Michael's request for troops, say
ing, "Wo arc not excited."
Folsom's statement, distributed
by Executive Secretary Ralph
Hammond, said "it is normal for
all races not to be overly fond of
each other," including "black,
white, yellow and red races."
The trustees then voted unani
mously as a safety measure to
prevent the student, Miss Author
ine Lucy of Birmingham, from
attending classes for a while.
The action followed three tense
days of riots, climaxed by today's
riot in .which university police,
state highway patrolmen and
friends of the Negro woman spir
ited her to safety while rioters
pelted decoy autos with stones
and eggs.
Third Demonstration
Not knowing about the trus
tees' action, some 500 students
broke into the third straight mid
night demonstration tonight and
rode through Tuscaloosa in a 100-
car motorcade.
An estimated 1000 students
stormed the executive mansion of
President Carmiehael at midnight
and someone threw an egg at
Mrs. Carmiehael when she pro
tested he was not at home. The
egg did not hit her.
University Police Chief Allen
Rayfield and a handful of stu
dents formed a cordon to conduct
her fcjaek inside the house. Some
one threw a handful of gravel
upon the porch.
There were shouts of "Are you
a nigger-lover?"
The crowd Ihen marched to an
other part of the campus.
Earlier the demonstrators pelt
ed Tuscaloosa Police Chief W. C.
Tompkins with two eggs.
College May Close
Several hundred students sign
ed a petition calling on President
Carmiehael to expel student lead
ers of the riots, saying they dis
credited the entire university.
President Carmiehael said the
college might have to close "if we
cannot operate under law and or
der." He said he had been inform
ed a new demonstration tonight
m ig h t "make the others look
small."
The Governor said he and sev
: eral million servicemen who have
j traveled over the world have ob-
I served these racial differences
i and added thai the demonstra
j lions at Alabama are "a result of
| such feelings."
"We are not excited. We are
not alarmists, but in any event
we do stand ready at all times to
meet with any situation prop
erly," he said. But he didn't elab
orate on how he planned to take
care of the situation.
Some 500 students began their
third mass demonstration tonight
shortly after Alabama's basket
ball team had beaten Vanderbilt
88-61.
100 Car Motorcade
A crowd, chanting "Hey, hey,
ho, ho, where in the hell did the
nigger go?" gathered in front of
the student union building. As
the crowd grew, the students got
into about 100 automobiles and
drove downtown in a motorcade.
Three local residents, none of
them a student, were arrested and
charged with disorderly conduct
in connection with today's rock
j and egg throwing.
Miss Lucy's whereabouts were

The Nf'gro student was barred from classes last night in a sj)."< iml
meeting of University trustees after the president requested Na
tional Guardsmen to quell rioting anti-Negro students.
TUSCALOOSA. Ala., Feb. 6 (U.P) The University of Alabama trus
tees voted tonight to bar temporarily from classes the school's first
Negro student a; whom rioters threw stones and eggs in a riot that
brought a plea for National Guardsmen to restore order.
Governor James E. Folsom refused university president O. ('. Car-

Michael's request for troops, say
ing, "Wo arc not excited."
Folsom's statement, distributed
by Executive Secretary Ralph
Hammond, said "it is normal for
all races not to be overly fond of
each other," including "black,
white, yellow and red races."
The trustees then voted unani
mously as a safety measure to
prevent the student, Miss Author
ine Lucy of Birmingham, from
attending classes for a while.
The action followed three tense
days of riots, climaxed by today's
riot in .which university police,
state highway patrolmen and
friends of the Negro woman spir
ited her to safety while rioters
pelted decoy autos with stones
and eggs.
Third Demonstration
Not knowing about the trus
tees' action, some 500 students
broke into the third straight mid
night demonstration tonight and
rode through Tuscaloosa in a 100-
car motorcade.
An estimated 1000 students
stormed the executive mansion of
President Carmiehael at midnight
and someone threw an egg at
Mrs. Carmiehael when she pro
tested he was not at home. The
egg did not hit her.
University Police Chief Allen
Rayfield and a handful of stu
dents formed a cordon to conduct
her fcjaek inside the house. Some
one threw a handful of gravel
upon the porch.
There were shouts of "Are you
a nigger-lover?"
The crowd Ihen marched to an
other part of the campus.
Earlier the demonstrators pelt
ed Tuscaloosa Police Chief W. C.
Tompkins with two eggs.
College May Close
Several hundred students sign
ed a petition calling on President
Carmiehael to expel student lead
ers of the riots, saying they dis
credited the entire university.
President Carmiehael said the
college might have to close "if we
cannot operate under law and or
der." He said he had been inform
ed a new demonstration tonight
m ig h t "make the others look
small."
The Governor said he and sev
: eral million servicemen who have
j traveled over the world have ob-
I served these racial differences
i and added thai the demonstra
j lions at Alabama are "a result of
| such feelings."
"We are not excited. We are
not alarmists, but in any event
we do stand ready at all times to
meet with any situation prop
erly," he said. But he didn't elab
orate on how he planned to take
care of the situation.
Some 500 students began their
third mass demonstration tonight
shortly after Alabama's basket
ball team had beaten Vanderbilt
88-61.
100 Car Motorcade
A crowd, chanting "Hey, hey,
ho, ho, where in the hell did the
nigger go?" gathered in front of
the student union building. As
the crowd grew, the students got
into about 100 automobiles and
drove downtown in a motorcade.
Three local residents, none of
them a student, were arrested and
charged with disorderly conduct
in connection with today's rock
j and egg throwing.
Miss Lucy's whereabouts were
i not revealed for a time following
the campus riot but her attorney,
I Negro Arthur Shores of Binning*
| ham, from where she commutes
,Ho miles to the university, said
! she returned there and was taken
to the country" away from poo
! pie and reporters."
Physically (nlmrnied
An officer said: "We had a few
rough moments today, but I think
! we came out all right. Miss Lucy
j was not touched or harmed."
Fourteen state highway patrol
men helped the local force.
