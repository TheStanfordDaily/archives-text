# Mollet Threatened, Jeered by Crowd Of Algiers Rioters
## 
### 
ALGIERS, Algeria, Feb. 6 (U.R)
A lynch-minded mob of French
settlers protested Premier Guy
Mullet's arrival on a peacemaking
mission today with an outburst
of rioting that forced the new
government's Algerian minister
to quit before he was installed.
But the white-lipped Mollct an
nounced he would carry on with
his mission.
Mollct stepped from his plane
into a seething mob of colonists
that might have lynched him but
for thousands of troops and police
who kept the jeering crowd at bay
with leveled rifles.
The settlers peppered Mollct
with rotten tomatoes and fruit.
They shouted down his words and
they ripped up the tricolor
wreath he placed on the tomb of
Fiance's unknown soldier.
At least five persons were hos
pitalized when helmeted soldiers
and police, under orders not to
open fire, beat back the rioters
with rifle butts and tear gas as
the mob screamed, "Mollct to the
gallows!" Many others were giv
en first aid at home.
Oddly enough, the usually mili
tant Algerian natives fighting for
independence kept out of sight.
It was the French themselves,
protesting Mollet's announced
program of granting equal rights
to the natives, who turned Algiers
into a battleground.
General George Catroux, Mol
let's new minister-resident for Al
geria, resigned from the post in
Paris as soon as he received news
of the rioting. Mollct accepted the
resignation on the spot.
