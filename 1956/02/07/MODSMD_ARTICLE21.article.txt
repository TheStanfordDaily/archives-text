# 'There's Nothing New Here, But I Just Thought I'd Drop You a Line'
## A
						Wise Stand 
### 
Twice in recent weeks Soviet Premier Niko
lai Bulganin has made a propaganda play for
the world spotlight and twice he has been
thwarted by President Eisenhower's refusal to
aecept his offer of a 20-year Russo-American
treaty of peace.
Bulganin's offers, made in the softened tones
of last summer's Geneva spirit, were obviously

two-edged: to soften the effect of the American-
British Declaration of Washington and to take
advantage of a weakened North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
Wisely the President turned downßulganin's
proposals, and for a change most of the world
agrees. Their backing of the United States"
wise stand lias strengthened all of the free
world.
