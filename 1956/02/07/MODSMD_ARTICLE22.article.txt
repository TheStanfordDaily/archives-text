The University of Washington Daily and
tlie Seattle Time* are feuding over the firing
of John Cherberg, former head football coach.
The fight began in December with charges that
the Times had altered facts in reporting a state
ment on the situation by the student body pres
ident. Then the Times in its sports section
claimed that the Daily had to ask permission
to write editorial* and contradicted statements
which *he student paper had made about the
coach. Recently the paper began attacks on
university officials and on the student body for
agitating against v.herberg. As of this week the
fight was still raging with the Daily asking the
Times to put up and substantiate charges they
have made or else shut up.

The News Letter of Johns Hopkins Univer
sity is unhappy about a gift which the school
library has recently received. Thirty thousand
volumes containing every work printed in the
United States from 1639 to 1800 have been do
nated to the university. The paper thought this
was fine at first hut wondered where space
would he found to house these books.
They soon found out.
The collection is reprinted on 6x9 micro
print cards which take up only 25 feet of shelf
space. This is wonderful for efficiency but the
News Letter is now wondering bow students
will use the gift.
No magnifiers have appeared to go with the
cards and the print is too small to read, with
100 pages condensed on each card.
