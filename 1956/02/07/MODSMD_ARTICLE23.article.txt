One professor in the business department is
requiring his captive commerce students to
"volunteer" to go to home games.
Every member of his class is expected lo at
tend and those who don't may have to repeat
the course. Pep (Hub has honored this enthu
siastic supporter with the "Rooster Hero But
ton"" and is planning to visit his marketing lec
ture to drum up more enthusiasm.
I his should solve the problem of dull classes,
anyway, and learning cheers can take the place
of homework.

I he UCLA Bruin has hired a research chem
ist to give them an accurate objective picture of
the average woman. Among his findings:
Physical properties: Boils at nothing and
freezes at any minute, melts when properly
treated; very bitter if not well used.
Chemical properties: Possesses great affinity
for gold, silver, platinum and precious stones.
Turns green when placed beside a better
looking specimen.
Uses: Highly ornamental; useful as a tonic
in acceleration of low spirits and an equalizer
of the distribution of wealth. Is probably the
most effective income-reducing agent known.

Football is still obsolete at the University of
Chicago. The University Council, by a vote
of 24-14. voted to turn down a special recom
mendation that Chicago be allowed to partici
pate in non-conference intercollegiate football.
Football has been absent from the university
for 16 years although classes in the sport are
still held. Students circulated petitions last
May in an effort to convince the administration
to return to the grid game.
