# Racial Co-existence Called Malaya's Top Problem
## 
### 
Tho most important issue in Malaya today is ihe problem of racial
co-existence of the Chinese and Malayans, Malayan civil servant Raja
Ayoub said in a seminar at Hoover Tower yesterday.
Ayoub, who is spending several days in this area, is now with
the British Embassy in Washington on special duty in the office of
the Colonial Attache.

A major — and encouraging —
factor in this racial issue is the
generosity and sympathy shown
toward each other by tho races
living in this area, according to
Ayoub.
"Now they will sit at the same
table, although they may not eat
the same food," he said. "This
would not have been possible 50
years ago. We need patience to
wait, and not impose on each
other."
Size of New York
Describing his country, official
ly called the Federation of Ma
laya, he noted it is 51,000 square
miles in size—slightly larger than
the state of New York. It contains
nine protected states, under Ihe
rule of sultans, and two British
colonies.
It has a population of six mil
lion, of which 50 per cent is Ma
layan, 38 per cent Chinese, 12 per
cent Indian and Pakistani and L
per cent others. In religion 11 is
predominantly Buddhist but with
a strong Muslim minority.
Of the Chinese, there are the
local-born minority and the ma
jority of Chinese born in China.
They are interested in business
and are energetic and resource
ful, Ayoub said.
Indian Populate
The Indians are also divided
in to local-born and India-born.
They came in the first century
A.D. as traders, and much of the
Indian civilization has been ab
sorbed by Malaya. Ayoub thinks
their main national characteris
tics are much knowledge and cul
ture.
About the Malayans, the race
to which he belongs, he was reti
cent. He feds it is hard to discuss
his own race objectively. He
thinks the Malayans are conserva
tive, suspicious of change and fa
talistic.
Turning to Malayan political or
ganization, Ayoub noted it is
based on a constitution formu
lated in 1918. The main governing
bodies are the executive and the
legislative councils. Defense and
external problems are still under
British control, but the Malayans
are consistently gaining in self
government.
First Election
Their first national election was
held in July, 1955. They were al
lowed to elect 52 of the 98 legis
lative council members, giving
them a majority of six. "This ma
jority of six is all we need," Ay
oub commented. "In fact, one vote
is enough."
Independence was the main is
sue of the election. A coalition of
three parties—the National Ma
layan, the Malayan Chinese and
the Malayan Indian—won all hut
one seat of the 52.
The single seat was taken by
the Muslim party, a recently-or
ganized group which appeals
strongly to the three million Mus
lims in the area. Ayoub is some
what concerned because this is a
party which might be extreme
unless it is well led.
liapid Growth
Concerning the speed of prog
ress in Malaya, Ayoub said one is
apt to think it has not been satis
factory. "But 50 years ago the
country was feudal. A hundred
years ago it was medieval. Our
progress has been a matter of
transplanting ohr society from
the Middle Ages to tho twen
tieth century in approximately
100 years. In England it took 1000
years.
"It is a great wonder that Ihe

people of my country have not
broken under the speed of that
change. But their great under
standing has helped."
Malaya is nol an economically
weak country, according to Ay
oub. She has one-third of the
world's tin and is second only to
India in rubber production. And
she has many other export prod
ucts.
About, the Communist-terrorist
organizations that have harassed
Malaya in the past few years,
Ayoub said they are comprised
mostly of Chinese born in China.
There are from 4000 to 5000 oper
ating from the thick jungle in the
center of the country.
"The feeling toward Chinese in
Malaya is friendly if they will ac
cept responsibility and identify
themselves in name and in fact
with our interests," he concluded.
"The impact of Communist doc
trine on Muslims is insignificant.
Occasionally extreme Malayan na
tionalists are found among tfie
Communists, but are very
few."
