## FAMOUS LAW CASES: NO. 1—GRANSMIRE vs. MIDDLE ATLANTIC BUS AND DRAY CO. 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy with Cheek," etc 
Gransmire, tho plaintiff in this celebrated case, lived with his
daughter Ernest and a canary named YVhirlaway on Elm Street
in Cooch, Delaware. The Middle Atlantic Bus and Dray Co.
started operating a bus line on Elm Street. The passing buses
caused a cut-glass chandelier in the Gransmires' living room
to begin tinkling. The chandelier tinkled in the key of E-fiat.
This so unnerved the canary, Whirlaway, whose key was C
sharp, that the poor bird moulted out of season, caught a chill,
and died untimely.
Ernest, Gransmire's daughter, was herself so unsettled by
the death of the canary that she flunked her final exams at the
Hoar's Head Beauty and Barber College, where she had been a
promising student, majoring in bangs. Now removed, willy
nilly, from the skilled labor market, Ernest found work carry
ing a sandwich sign for the old Vienna Chow Mein parlor.

ess-' *—'
Here she met a bus-boy named Crunch Sigafoos.. Although
Crunch was not especially attractive — he had, for one thing, a
large bushy tail — he was always clean and neat and kept his
shoes shined, and after a decent interval, he and Ernest were
married.
Ernest soon learned .that Crunch's large bushy tail was not
as anomalous as she had supposed: Crunch was a werewolf.
After a while Ernest got sick of staying home at night while
her husband went prowling about, so she asked him-to change
her into a werewolf too, which he did with an ancient Transyl
vanian incantation. Then, together, the two of them would
lope out each night and meet a lot of other werewolves and
maybe kill a few chickens or hear some book reports or just
lay around and shoot the breeze.
Meanwhile, Ernest and Crunch's landlady, a miser named
Mrs. Augenblick, noticed that Ernest and Crunch never used
their room at night, so she, in her greed, started renting it to
transients. One night a Mr. Ffolliett stayed there. In the morn
ing while brushing his hair, he took a bottle that looked like
hair tonic out of the cabinet, poured some, and rubbed it
vigorously into his scalp. Unfortunately, it was not hair tonic,
but a bottle of glue which Ernest had bought to mend a model
airplane that Crunch had given her for their paper wedding
anniversary.
As a result of Mr. Ffolliett's grisly error, he was unable
to remove his hat and was, therefore, barred from his usual
occupation which was lecturing to women's clubs. He sued Mrs.
Augenblick, who sued Ernest, who went to her father, who sued
the Middle Atlantic Bus ami Dray Co. who had started the whole
horrid chain of events.
"Ladies and gentlemen," paid the defense attorney in his
opening address, "this case, though very ramified, is covered
by law. Indeed, every facet of life is covered by law. Law
governs the homes you live in, the cars you drive, the food you
eat. Even the cigarette you smoke is strictly regulated. The
gentleness, however, is Philip Morris's own idea. Out of their
vast experience as tobacco people, out of their profound regard
for the astuteness of your palate, the makers of Philip Morris
have evolved a gentle, new cigarette, with a taste as mild as a
May morn, as subtle as gossamer, as welcome as money fronv
home. I thank you."
Whereupon everybody rushed to the tobacco counter to buy
bright red, white and gold packs of Philip Morris and were all
rendered so amiable after a few gentle puffs that the whole
complicated case was dropped. This later berame known as the
Delaware Water Gap. • un shuimm m*

vigorously into his scalp. Unfortunately, it was not hair tonic,
but a bottle of glue which Ernest had bought to mend a model
airplane that Crunch had given her for their paper wedding
anniversary.
As a result of Mr. Ffolliett's grisly error, he was unable
to remove his hat and was, therefore, barred from his usual
occupation which was lecturing to women's clubs. He sued Mrs.
Augenblick, who sued Ernest, who went to her father, who sued
the Middle Atlantic Bus ami Dray Co. who had started the whole
horrid chain of events.
"Ladies and gentlemen," paid the defense attorney in his
opening address, "this case, though very ramified, is covered
by law. Indeed, every facet of life is covered by law. Law
governs the homes you live in, the cars you drive, the food you
eat. Even the cigarette you smoke is strictly regulated. The
gentleness, however, is Philip Morris's own idea. Out of their
vast experience as tobacco people, out of their profound regard
for the astuteness of your palate, the makers of Philip Morris
have evolved a gentle, new cigarette, with a taste as mild as a
May morn, as subtle as gossamer, as welcome as money fronv
home. I thank you."
Whereupon everybody rushed to the tobacco counter to buy
bright red, white and gold packs of Philip Morris and were all
rendered so amiable after a few gentle puffs that the whole
complicated case was dropped. This later berame known as the
Delaware Water Gap. • un shuimm m*

Gransmire, tho plaintiff in this celebrated case, lived with his
daughter Ernest and a canary named YVhirlaway on Elm Street
in Cooch, Delaware. The Middle Atlantic Bus and Dray Co.
started operating a bus line on Elm Street. The passing buses
caused a cut-glass chandelier in the Gransmires' living room
to begin tinkling. The chandelier tinkled in the key of E-fiat.
This so unnerved the canary, Whirlaway, whose key was C
sharp, that the poor bird moulted out of season, caught a chill,
and died untimely.
Ernest, Gransmire's daughter, was herself so unsettled by
the death of the canary that she flunked her final exams at the
Hoar's Head Beauty and Barber College, where she had been a
promising student, majoring in bangs. Now removed, willy
nilly, from the skilled labor market, Ernest found work carry
ing a sandwich sign for the old Vienna Chow Mein parlor.

ess-' *—'
Here she met a bus-boy named Crunch Sigafoos.. Although
Crunch was not especially attractive — he had, for one thing, a
large bushy tail — he was always clean and neat and kept his
shoes shined, and after a decent interval, he and Ernest were
married.
Ernest soon learned .that Crunch's large bushy tail was not
as anomalous as she had supposed: Crunch was a werewolf.
After a while Ernest got sick of staying home at night while
her husband went prowling about, so she asked him-to change
her into a werewolf too, which he did with an ancient Transyl
vanian incantation. Then, together, the two of them would
lope out each night and meet a lot of other werewolves and
maybe kill a few chickens or hear some book reports or just
lay around and shoot the breeze.
Meanwhile, Ernest and Crunch's landlady, a miser named
Mrs. Augenblick, noticed that Ernest and Crunch never used
their room at night, so she, in her greed, started renting it to
transients. One night a Mr. Ffolliett stayed there. In the morn
ing while brushing his hair, he took a bottle that looked like
hair tonic out of the cabinet, poured some, and rubbed it
vigorously into his scalp. Unfortunately, it was not hair tonic,
but a bottle of glue which Ernest had bought to mend a model
