Saturday's basketball game be-
I (ween Stanford and UCLA may
be shifted from 8 p.m. to 2 p.m.,
according to Don Liebendorfer,
Stanford athletic publicity direc
tor.
Liebendorfer says that the Pa
cific Coast Conference crucial
j may be televised, thus necessi
tating the afternoon starting
time. Originally scheduled to be
telecast on the coast was the USC-
Washington State encounter.
"It is probable that the game
will be played in the afternoon,"
i Liebendorfer said, "but there is
nothing definite yet. CBS must
still agree to the plan."
Should Stanford's quintet be
shown on television this weekend,
the season finale between the
Cards and California, originally
scheduled for home consumption,
I would probably he blacked out.
This goes along with the con
ference's policy of having each
team on TV approximately the
same number of times.
