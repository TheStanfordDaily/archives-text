## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. G (U.R)—The Senate passed Ihe controversial
natural gas bill tonight, ending one of the bitterest and most dramatic
fights in recent Congressional history.
The roll-call vote was 53 to 38 in favor of the bill.
Just before the showdown vote, the Senate substituted the House

-version for its own bill, automati
cal ly sending the measure to
President Eisenhower.
Otherwise the bill would have
gone back to the House, provok
ing another angry battle.
The party-splitting vote came
several hours after the Senate
slapped down an attempt to side
track the bill while a committee
investigated an alleged attempt to
influence the vote of Sen. Francis
Case (R-S.D. I.
It also came after John M. Neff,
a former oil-gas industry lobbyist,
identified himself as the mystery
man who gave $2500 to Case's re
election campaign fund.
Price Boost
The bill would exempt some
4000 to 0000 natural gas produ
cers from direct federal price reg
ulations. Opponents argued that
it would boost consumer prices
$600 million a year. Supporters
denied this and said the bill was
needed to encourage new gas ex
plorations.
Case dropped a bombshell in
the Senate Friday when lie dis
closed the campaign offer, fie
said he had been leaning toward
the bill bul changed his mind as
a result of the donation.
Investigation
Passage of the bill increased
the furor over Nell's offer. Still
awaiting Congressional action
was a bipartisan proposal by Sen
ate Democratic and Republican
leaders to conduct a special in
vestigation of the incident.
Another Senate committee plan
ned a second inquiry into all cam
paign contributions to senators
by the gas industry ovfcr the past
several years. The FBI already is
investigating the Neff donation.
"Senate passage came after the
senators, by a XI to .'}() vote, dra
matically slapped down a motion
by Sen. Charles F. Poller (R
Mich.) to send the bill back to the
Senate Commerce Committee
pending the investigation into
Case's disclosures.

merits offered by the bill's oppo
nents If) give more protection to
gas consumers. Bill supporters ar
gued they were unnecessary be

and states will still regulate dis
tributor prices.
Case, who hotly defended his
role in the incident, read the Sen
ate a telegram from Neff. Neff
acknowledged he was "interested
in passage" of the gas bill. But his
wire said that the money was of
fered "with no strings attached."
