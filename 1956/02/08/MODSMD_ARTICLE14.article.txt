# Danish Expert Calls Homeland "A Civilization'
## Erling Norlev Stresses Welfare State Problem 
### Ellen Spiegl 
"It is strange to toll about your j
country," began Tuesday Evening
Series lecturer Erling Norlev last
night," but I will talk about my
country as Emily Post would ap-1
prove—with modesty."
Norlev continued to discuss
"Denmark Today" with an honest j
and humorous approach.
The early settlement of his I
country by the Vikings led not
only to a great empire but also to
"a creation of a civilization," Nor
lev said.
lie pointed out that the Danish
language is a cornerstone of Eng
lish, illustrating the influence of
the Danish civilization. »
Today, he said, Denmark is a
nation of one million square
miles, including Greenland which
was incorporated three years ago.
Its population is four and one-half j
million.
Humor
Speaking of the Danish "men
tality," Norlev jibed that "we are
supposed to have a sense of hu
mor—so much so that we laugh
when nothing is funny."
Denmark today is still monarch
conscious according to Norlev.
But her six political, parties, with
no majority party, promote po
litical compromise and stable gov- j
ernment.
Young people in Denmark to
day are accused of lacking politi
cal interest. Yet in recent elec
tions the percentage of Danish i
voters casting their ballots was I
higher than was ever recorded in
the United States.
Welfare State
One of Denmark's more diffi
cult problems, the free-lance writ
er observed, is the question of the
welfare state as the "demands for
security continue to grow." Like
the United States, Denmark has
its share of complaining taxpay
ers who are the inevitable out- j
growth of a "still growing bu
reaucracy."
Norlev characterized his home-!
land as "genial and congenial" j
and admitted that "Yes, we like to
eat."
"What I miss about my home
land is its age, something your
country doesn't have," he contin
ued. "Taking a walk in Copen
hagen takes one back many cen
turies, and gives a man perspec
tive."
Following Norlev's talk a movie
was shown, illustrating tech
niques in the classic Danish arts
of pottery, china, furniture and
silver.

prove—with modesty."
Norlev continued to discuss
"Denmark Today" with an honest j
and humorous approach.
The early settlement of his I
country by the Vikings led not
only to a great empire but also to
"a creation of a civilization," Nor
lev said.
lie pointed out that the Danish
language is a cornerstone of Eng
lish, illustrating the influence of
the Danish civilization. »
Today, he said, Denmark is a
nation of one million square
miles, including Greenland which
was incorporated three years ago.
Its population is four and one-half j
million.
Humor
Speaking of the Danish "men
tality," Norlev jibed that "we are
supposed to have a sense of hu
mor—so much so that we laugh
when nothing is funny."
Denmark today is still monarch
conscious according to Norlev.
But her six political, parties, with
no majority party, promote po
litical compromise and stable gov- j
ernment.
Young people in Denmark to
day are accused of lacking politi
cal interest. Yet in recent elec
tions the percentage of Danish i
voters casting their ballots was I
higher than was ever recorded in
the United States.
Welfare State
One of Denmark's more diffi
cult problems, the free-lance writ
er observed, is the question of the
welfare state as the "demands for
security continue to grow." Like
the United States, Denmark has
its share of complaining taxpay
ers who are the inevitable out- j
growth of a "still growing bu
reaucracy."
Norlev characterized his home-!
land as "genial and congenial" j
and admitted that "Yes, we like to
eat."
"What I miss about my home
land is its age, something your
country doesn't have," he contin
ued. "Taking a walk in Copen
hagen takes one back many cen
turies, and gives a man perspec
tive."
Following Norlev's talk a movie
was shown, illustrating tech
niques in the classic Danish arts
of pottery, china, furniture and
silver.
