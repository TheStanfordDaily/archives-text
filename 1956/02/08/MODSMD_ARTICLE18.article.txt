# Red Cross Disaster Fund Nearly Broke, Group Told
## National Chairman E. Roland Harriman 'Tells Peninsula Leaders of Financial Need 
### 
Saying, "We are not in a position to meet the demands of another
disaster," E. Roland Harriman, chairman of the American National
Red Cross, yesterday called for the "greatest effort ever" in raising
funds.
Harriman, talking to over a hundred Peninsula Red Cross leaders

-gathered at Rickey's for a lunch
eon, explained that the reserve
funds for disaster—usually over
$8 million -are now dangerously
low. "We have less than $1 mil*
lion in the kitty to last us through
June," he said.
In other phases of activity, the
organization has sufficient funds
to last through June. The Red
Cross is "not cutting our other
services because of the disasters,"
said Harriman.
ASSU President George Ralph,
an ex-officio member of the Palo
Alto Red Cross Council, repre
sented Stanford at the luncheon.
He and Harriman discussed the
student 'body's part in the March
campaign for funds.
California Floods
Before the luncheon, Harriman
told reporters the recent Califor
nia floods will cost about $K mil
lion to the Red Cross. About 11,-
000 separate requests for assist
ance are expected from the west
ern states.
Harriman said that the average
request for assistance in Califor
nia is quite a bit less than in the
East. "People in this state are a
little more 'rugged individual
ists'," he said.
Harriman told his luncheon au
dience: "As never before in peace
time, the Red Cross has been on
the job. It is breaking us finan
cially—but not in spirit."
$8 Million
Because of the increased de
mand placed on the disaster fund,
the organization is'adding $8 mil
lion to the goal for its March ap
peal. Harriman feels that the Red
Cross has never been better un
derstood by the American people,
j "We have never had a more fa
vorable public attitude."
This is due in great measure to
| the vast number of families help
i ed by the organization this win
ter. He said "30,000 families have
already been helped this winter
. . . this is roughly equivalent to
j the restoration of a city the size
I of Pasadena."
j In closing his address, Harri
i man said he is confident that peo
j pie will respond to make the 1956
I campaign a success. He told his
audience "we will have to work
hard . . . but there is no excellence
j without difficulty."
The luncheon yesterday was
| Harriman's only appearance in
I northern California.

the March fund-raising campaigns. Ralph represented the student
body at a luncheon yesterday which marked Ilarriinan's only North
ern California appearance.—Daily photo by Ric Teague.
Saying, "We are not in a position to meet the demands of another
disaster," E. Roland Harriman, chairman of the American National
Red Cross, yesterday called for the "greatest effort ever" in raising
funds.
Harriman, talking to over a hundred Peninsula Red Cross leaders

-gathered at Rickey's for a lunch
eon, explained that the reserve
funds for disaster—usually over
$8 million -are now dangerously
low. "We have less than $1 mil*
lion in the kitty to last us through
June," he said.
In other phases of activity, the
organization has sufficient funds
to last through June. The Red
Cross is "not cutting our other
services because of the disasters,"
said Harriman.
ASSU President George Ralph,
an ex-officio member of the Palo
Alto Red Cross Council, repre
sented Stanford at the luncheon.
He and Harriman discussed the
student 'body's part in the March
campaign for funds.
California Floods
Before the luncheon, Harriman
told reporters the recent Califor
nia floods will cost about $K mil
lion to the Red Cross. About 11,-
000 separate requests for assist
ance are expected from the west
ern states.
Harriman said that the average
request for assistance in Califor
nia is quite a bit less than in the
East. "People in this state are a
little more 'rugged individual
ists'," he said.
Harriman told his luncheon au
dience: "As never before in peace
time, the Red Cross has been on
the job. It is breaking us finan
cially—but not in spirit."
$8 Million
Because of the increased de
mand placed on the disaster fund,
the organization is'adding $8 mil
lion to the goal for its March ap
peal. Harriman feels that the Red
Cross has never been better un
derstood by the American people,
j "We have never had a more fa
vorable public attitude."
This is due in great measure to
| the vast number of families help
i ed by the organization this win
ter. He said "30,000 families have
already been helped this winter
. . . this is roughly equivalent to
j the restoration of a city the size
I of Pasadena."
j In closing his address, Harri
i man said he is confident that peo
j pie will respond to make the 1956
I campaign a success. He told his
audience "we will have to work
hard . . . but there is no excellence
j without difficulty."
The luncheon yesterday was
| Harriman's only appearance in
I northern California.
