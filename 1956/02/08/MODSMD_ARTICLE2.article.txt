WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (U.R)â€”
Secretary of Stale John Foster
Dulles today pinned a "propagan
da" label on Russia's renewed bid
for a 20-year friendship pact with
the United States. He left no
doubt President Eisenhower will
reject it.
At his wide-ranging weekly
news conference Dulles also de
nied Russian charges that this
country is floating "propaganda"
balloons equipped with radios and
cameras over Iron Curtain coun
tries.
He said this country is sending
aloft high-flying weather balloons
equipped with cameras to record
speed and cloud formations.
