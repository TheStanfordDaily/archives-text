pus demonstrations.)
By Autherine Lucy
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Feb. 7
(U.R)—I have always wanted to
go to the University of Ala
bama, and being there just
these few clays lias made nie
feel good inside.
I want to go back just as soon
as the board of trustees tells inc
I can.
I believe the University of
Alabama student body will ac
cept me if they are left alone
by outsiders.
I want to be an acceptable
librarian, and I have no other
interest in this than that I want
to get a good education.
I don't think I'm asking for
anything I am not entitled to.
I am proud of the university
and I will be proud to be a stu
dent there.
Some of the students were
very friendly toward me; oth
ers were hostile. But I feel the
majority is for me.
Although I think the board
of trustees probably did what
was best in excluding me from
class yesterday, I don't think it
would have been necessary had
they taken the right action
quickly.
I really don't know what lliey
should have done. But I feel
they could have done something
to have prevented my having
to discontinue classes.
I deeply regret the incidents
of the last few days, because I
want only to have a chance to
learn.
