# Answer the Call
## 
### 
One of Stanford's most preying problems
will he discussed tonight al the ASSIJ Legisla
ture meeting the snarled-up traffic situation.
1 legislators have issued a call for the eampus
at-large to join in. That eall should lie an
swered. If it is not answered, a workable solu
tion to lhe problem may never he reached.
Hard-working Hob Maddock and bis volun
teer traffic committee have been studying the
traffic problem for months and have put forth
some substantial solutions.
Some are impractical, it is true, but never
theless they pinpoint the needs.
.Hut Maddock'g committee does not have all
lhe solutions; the real answers to questions
posed by increaeing traffic problems lie. within
the whole student body.
Now is the chance to help activate those
ideas, perhaps to get some real action. Sound,
practical ideas are needed; ideas that can be

put into force riÂ»,hl here now now before things
get any worse.
For they can get worse. Tliey are getting
worse every day despite pleas from campus po
lice, University administrators, students, almost
everyone connected with Stanford.
Perhaps the answer is parking meters, per
haps special parking stickers, restricted /ones,
new road markings or any of the other solutions
proposed by the committee.
Hut whatever the solution it must be reached
soon and with the entire student body pushing
for its adoption.
Tonight is an opportune time to hegin a
weekly habit, thai of attending student legis
lature meetings. ASS 11 legislators need to he
reminded that ihey are representing fellow stu
dents, not merely themselves.
He there tonight and every Wednesday night
to remind them 8 p.m. in the Bowman Alumni
House Annex.
