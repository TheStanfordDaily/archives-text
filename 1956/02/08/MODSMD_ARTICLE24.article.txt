Capitol Hill has seen the culmination over
the past week of a long and arduous effort on
the part of the gargantuan natural gas lohhy
to usher through Congress a hill exempting gas
producers from Federal priee controls.
The natural gas lohhy, one of 1 lie most power
ful pressure groups in Washington, may have
crawled too far out on its multimillion-dollar
Jimb this time.
Last Friday Senator Francis Case (R., S.D.)
dropped a political firecracker onto the Senate
lloor when he charged that lie had a
$2500 campaign contribution from a man whom
he knew to be an adamant supporter of the gas
interests.
This disclosure provoked a bipartisan pro
posal from Democratic and Republican leaders,
including Senate majority and minority lead
ers Lyndon Johnson and William Knowland,
for a special investigation of the Neff incident.
The FBI is investigating it, and another Sen
ate committee has decided to take a look at the
whole issue of campaign contributions from the
gas industry over the past few years.
With the economic expansion of the country,
lobbies have assumed a position of influence
disproportionate to their value to the public
as a whole.
Yet it is unnatural to assume that lobbies can
he discouraged from exerting influence on pub
lic officials; indeed they serve a valuable pur
pose as a liaison between our governmental
bodies and the socio-economic groups they rep
resent.
But their activities can and must he curbed
by more effective legislation to prevent irre
sponsible lobbyists from dangling financial en
ticements before public officials to sway a vote
in their favor.
Such an obvious bribe as that offered Senator
Case is of little danger. The serious danger lies
in the cumulative effect that such offers may
have, offers that are not aired publicly and do
successfully influence legislators, administra
tors and judges to sacrifice their convictions for
monetary gain.
