# Senate Bribes, Lobbyist Tacties Seen from Two Points of View
## 
### Jim Palmer 
The charge of bribery raised in the contro
versy over the natural gas hill has caused con
siderable concern over the channels of legisla
tive influence available to special interests.
There are those quick to condemn lobbying
as it is practiced in Washington today and who
cite such instances as the current one to prove
their case.
But the problem here is not one concerned
with the device of lobbying itself. In fact the
present lobbying regulations are fairly straight
forward and in general there is nothing to fear
from the registered, official lobbies represent
ing diverse interest groups in Washington.
The lobby, indeed, is one of the most impor
tant political tools since it serves as a channel
of communication and information between the
people and the people's representatives.
Rather, the country faces the question of in
fluence peddling, not through the official lobby,
but through individual so-called campaign con
tributions.
The United States has no law against Mr.
Neff's $2500 "contribution with no strings at
tached"' to Senator Case.
But it is not hard to see how sucli a contri
bution, coming from a supporter of the gas bill
at such a crucial time, could easily he influential
on a man with less scruples than Mr. Case.
Influence peddling in such a manner might
have the same effect as an outright bribe, al
though it is not in the eyes of the law.
Anil while the Congress has taken pains to
clamp down on lobbies, the vast area of "cam
paign contributions" lies relatively untouched
except by narrow legislation like the Hatch Act
(which leaves wide loopholes anyway).
What is needed on the part of Congress is
not another round of investigations to uncover
isolated scandals, but strong action by legisla
tion to curb "contributions" like Mr. Neff's.
ll is indeed fortunate that there are men of
the forthrightness of Republican Case to bring
to the attention of political leaders the serious
ness of the situation which exists, it hoped
there will he positive results.
