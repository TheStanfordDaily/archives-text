A Woman's Plaot*
Editor, Th" Daily:
Being a foreign student, I have often been
asked * .y opinion of American girls.
First of all. my viewpoint is that they have a
tendency toward masculinity. Oftentimes I get
the feeling that they don't appreciate and many
times forget their femininity.
This is most ev'ient when they try to dress like
the boys, have a short haircut. This might he
perhaps a psychological or sociological effect.
Especially the way they compete against men;
maybe because they have the feeling of inferior

ity; therefore, try to compensale for it in this
way.
All this, in my opinion, could mean some dan
ger for the future. A woman's place is in the
home; she should be a good wife and mother; and
not go out and compete with the opposite sex,
very often her own husband.
A girl should know her role in society, where
she stands in life and her responsibilities. She
can be the most helpful by having and keeping
a nice family and raising the children properly.
To learn how and to practice this full-time job
will be her greatest contribution, and will be the
most appreciated.
