# Stanford Model UN Class Pioneers on West Coast
## Students Will Represent Israel in Debate With Reed College at Western Model UN 
### Dave Canfield 
Each Monday night in the West Library of the Polilioal Science
Department, 16 pioneers meet to figure out how to outtaik Reed
College.
They are Stanford's Model UN Class, Ihe first of its kind on the
West Coast. The 15-member class and its teacher A 1 Brouse will

represent Israel at the western -
college Model UN in Corvallis, I
Ore., April 5-10.
Reed College will represent Is
rael's rivaj, Egypt.
The class was founded last year.
To get into the class, students
apply in the fall and are inter
viewed by the Institute of Inter
national Relations, which spun*
sors the class.
"In the class we look at the
state of Israel," declared Brouse,
"and try to examine everything
which would affect its foreign
policy."
UN Details
Another function is to learn the
elementary details of the United
Nations.
Toward this purpose, members
submitted at last Monday night's
meeting the resolutions ihey plan
to present at the Model UN.
Brouse then made criticisms
and suggestions and directed stu
dents in revision of the resolu
tions.
After revising resolutions, the
class will send them to Corvallis
to be put on the Model UN's
agenda.
Each resolution consists of two
parts, introductory and operative.
In the introductory part are claus
es setting forth arguments.
Operative
The operative part contains Ihe
resolution itself.
"Operative clauses are voted on,
paragraph by paragraph," re
marked Brouse. "There are no
riders in the UN."
Among the resolutions submit-

J ted Monday night were ones call
ling for an embargo on trade to
the Middle East, a trade commis
sion in the Middle East and cen
sure of Egypt for restricting trav
el on the Suez Canal.
Committees
To work on those and other
resolutions, the class has chosen
these committees:
Political and Security Commit
tee— Sandra Bull, Craig Barkes
and Emmanuel Eeuchtwang.
Social, Cultural and Humanities
Committee Barbara Von Brieson
and Sally Shinkle.
Economic and Finance Commit
tee— Yvonne Irwin, Stu Pollak
and Truls Treider.
Membership Committee Jack
Pike and Judy Wharton.
Peace Observation Committee
Alain Coriat, Karen Erickson,
Kay Hamilton and Tom Lanyi.
At Corvallis, Steve Breyer will
serve as "Israel's" representative
to the International Board of Jus
tice.
Third Purpose
A third purpose of the Model
UN class is to learn seminar
techniques.
"This is imp orl a nt," said
Brouse, "because some of the
members of the class arc fresh
men and*have had <rn research
experience."
Besides doing research, each
week the class hears a lecture.
Lecturers have included Brouse,
Feuchtwang, who is a graduate
student, and Ernest Ettlinger, a
teaching fellow in law.
