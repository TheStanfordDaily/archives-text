# Antique Edison Lights in Museum 'On Display' Since '06 Earthquake
## 
### Richard Brown 
High in the dome of the Leland
Stanford Junior Museum is a dis
play of early electric lights—old
carbon filament bulbs like those
Thomas Edison made in 1879.
These museum pieces were
quite inadvertently consigned to
their present "showcase" on the
morning of April 18, 1906, when
the San Andreas Fault delivered
a vigorous shaking to much of
California.
As the earth trembled, the en
tire electrical system of the Mu
seum went dead. It still is.
Any electricity in the building
today is conducted through dif
ferent, recently - installed wires,
according to Mrs. Helen Green
Cross, associate director of the
Art Gallery and Museum.
Today only 50 per cent of the
building has been relighted by the
new electrical system; the dome
is still in the "dead" 50 per cent.

As originally built in 1891-92,
the Museum had its electric wires
buried deep within the thick walls
of reinforced concrete. The walls
withstood the quake well, but the
electric cables within them snap
ped. To this day no one knows
where the breaks are.
Even if modern "Geiger coun
ter" instruments could solve the
mystery, there would still be Ihe
problem of drilling into the strong
concrete. Present wiring has had
to be attached to the outside of
the walls.
After the quake interest cen
tered on repairing the University
itself. But in 1909 the Museum
was unceremoniously reopened
without electricity. However, it
was reclosed in 1945.
After' a reorganization the Mu
seum again was reopened in May,
1954. In addition to added displays
it boasted electricity on the first
floor, brought in by the external
wires on the walls.
