# Fans Demonstrate As Gavilan Loses

### 
LONDON, Feb. 7 (U.P.)â€”Unbeat
en Peter Waterman of London
won such an unpopular referee's
decision over former welter
weight champion Kid Gavilan to
night: that the sell-out crowd of
10,000 shook Harringay Arena
with their boos for 10 minutes
and probably inspired an official
inquiry.
It was the stormiest scene in
modern British boxing history
when referee Ben Green held up
Waterman's right hand in token
of victory at the end.
The angrily-amazed Gavilan
jumped about the ring, wildly
gesticulating, while his manager
hegan tearing out his hair in fury.
Peter Wilson, columnist for the
London Daily Mirror, called the
decision "outrageous" and said,
"There's bound to be an inquiry."
