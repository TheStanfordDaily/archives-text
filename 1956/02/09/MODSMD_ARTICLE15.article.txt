## ST&T Speakers Fell Living Groups About Finance, Studies, Enrollment 
### 
Frederic O. Glover, assistant to President Wallace Sterling, said
last night to a Stanford Today and Tomorrow audience, "We want
Stanford to be a residential university."
Speaking in the Eating Club Lounge, Glover said 23 per cent <>112
the undergraduates and 63 per cent of the graduate students now live

off campus. -
"We want small group units,"
Glover said, "so that education in
the classroom can be supplement
ed with education in living
groups."
Toward this end Stanford add
ed 1000 new beds this year by
building Wilbur Hall and Stern
Hall.
"We lost 500 beds in Encina,"
he said. "But we think that Wil
bur is a great improvement over
Encina, and we speak frankly
about it because those of us who
are alumni helped wreck Encina."
Moore Hall
The seven units of Moore Hall,
when built, will add space for 350
women.
"We still will need one more
residence hall for men and one
more for women," Glover said.
As well as building more resi
dential developments, the Univer
si t y development program in
cludes opening new shopping cen
ter stores, renting space in Stan
ford's Industrial Park, leasing
land to residential tenants and
planning the new student union,
; post office, Stern wing and music
building,
"The post office will be moved
across the street to where the
Sigma Alpha PJpsilon house now
is," Glover said. "The only thing
we tell SAE is that they won't
have any trouble mailing a let
ter."
In another ST&T talk, Assist
ant to the President Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson told a crowd in the
Alpha Kappa Lambda house that
the University's "total operation
is costing more per student."
Expenditu res
"Our enrollment," said Cuth
bertson, "remains the same, but
our expenditures are rising."
Speaking at Theta Chi, James
S. Triolo, assoeiate,general secre
tary, emphasized that "the cali
ber of eduation at Stanford is
ultimately determined by the re
sources available to us."
David S. Jacobson, general sec
retary, spoke in the Sigma Chi
house and said, "When the Uni
versity was founded, there was
no need for money because the
endowment covered 100 per cent
of the cost, but now it covers 19
per cent."

Stanford to be a residential university."
Speaking in the Eating Club Lounge, Glover said 23 per cent <>112
the undergraduates and 63 per cent of the graduate students now live

off campus. -
"We want small group units,"
Glover said, "so that education in
the classroom can be supplement
ed with education in living
groups."
Toward this end Stanford add
ed 1000 new beds this year by
building Wilbur Hall and Stern
Hall.
"We lost 500 beds in Encina,"
he said. "But we think that Wil
bur is a great improvement over
Encina, and we speak frankly
about it because those of us who
are alumni helped wreck Encina."
Moore Hall
The seven units of Moore Hall,
when built, will add space for 350
women.
"We still will need one more
residence hall for men and one
more for women," Glover said.

cludes opening new shopping cen

building,
"The post office will be moved
across the street to where the
Sigma Alpha PJpsilon house now
is," Glover said. "The only thing
we tell SAE is that they won't
have any trouble mailing a let
ter."
In another ST&T talk, Assist
ant to the President Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson told a crowd in the
Alpha Kappa Lambda house that
the University's "total operation

our expenditures are rising."
Speaking at Theta Chi, James
S. Triolo, assoeiate,general secre

ultimately determined by the re
sources available to us."
David S. Jacobson, general sec
retary, spoke in the Sigma Chi

versity was founded, there was
no need for money because the
endowment covered 100 per cent
of the cost, but now it covers 19
per cent."
