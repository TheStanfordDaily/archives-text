LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8 (U.R>
UCLA's sororities withdrew from
the student government today in
a row over whether they would
submit their constitutions to the
student legislative council for ;<
study of any racial restrictions
they might contain.
The Pan Hellenic Council, rep
resenting the 50 sororities on Ihe
campus, announced its withdraw
al from the student government;
rather than accept the require
ment of submitting their constitu
tions for study.
The Interfraternity C o un <â€¢ i 1,
representing 27 campus fraterni
ties, was expected to take similar
action next week.
Spokesmen for the social
groups told the Associated Stu
dent Body of UCLA that their
constitutions were in most cases
national rather than local. If they
placed their membership require
merits under regulations of the
student body it might conflict
with rules of their national
groups, they said.
About 20 per cent of UCLA
15,000 students belong to the fra
mittees and sororities.
