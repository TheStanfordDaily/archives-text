# A 						True Liberal Education
## 
### 
Two years of hard work anÂ»l Atudy by mem
bers of 1 lie faculty and student body were cul
minated yesterday by the announcement that
the I niversity Academic Council has accepted
the program submitted by the Committee for
the Study of Undergraduate Education.
The program, as submitted, is a complete
overhaul and re-evaluation of the University
curriculum. Ii includes changes in every phase
of student academic, life and is described by
President Sterling as the "most thoroughgoing
revision of I niveisity undergraduate curricu
lum in years."'
The proposals submitted by SUE were de
signed to provide a program intellectually ap
pealing to the majority of the students and to
give as much coverage as possible to the fields
of knowledge without strangling intellectual in
terest by iorced conformity.
The committee, which includes President
Sterling, Dean If. Donald Winbigler and pro
fessors such as Robert Hooper*, Friedrich W.
Strothmann, 11. Stuart Hughes, Carl B. Spaeth
and James T. \\ aikins, feels that these goals
have been reached in the revised "general stud
ies program."
Some of their proposals:
Requirement of a full year of freshman Eng
lish,' including both composition and litera
ture; the raising of course requirements in nat
ural sciences to i? units for an A.B. degree;
and the freeing of the student from required
general studies courses in his major field.
The committee's report also provides that
each student be allowed to declare his major
while a freshman and be required to do so at
the beginning of his junior year.
Students are to be allowed "absolute free
dom" in changing advisers and fields of study
and students will be permitted to complete part
of the University physical education require
ments by participation in such organized ac
tivities as band, orchestra and chorus.
The report includes provisions for changes
in University entrance requirements: an in
crease from two years to three years of high
school English as well as two years of foreign
language and two of mathematics and "satisfac
tory performance" on subject-matter achieve

ment tests in addition to the present aptitude
tests.
These proposals, according to I he- committee,
will go into effect gradually. They will not dis
turb the programs of students currently en
rolled. Nor will the new entrance requirements
affect the freshmen entering the I diversity this
autumn.
This is only right, ft would not he fair to
change the student's terms of agreement with
the I niversity in the middle of his four years
here.
\\ e think the addition of this program will
have the effect of raising Stanford's already
high academic standards.
Students, who will graduate from the Uni
versity in future years, will have had the ad
vantage of more general training. In short,
they will have received a true liberal education.
This is proper. Granted, we may live in a
growing age of specialization where one may
earn a living with knowledge of only one field.
A general knowledge of many fields is neces
sary if the individual is to he a responsible citi
zen of the world community.
We do not think that this should apply only
to the other fellow and not to us. Those who
have missed the new required general courses
have missed some of the finer things wlficli a
university has to offer.
Another advantage which will he derived
from the new program is increased freedom
and responsibility for the student.
in the past, a liberal education has been
construed as meaning a series of mandatory
courses. SUE's proposals have been designed to'
give the student a greater variety of electives in
his course of study.
In addition, the new system will go far in
eliminating the present distinctions between
upper and lower classmen. Freshmen will be
come a more integral pari of the Stanford fain
ily.
We approve of the committee's report and
we congratulate them and the Academic Coun
cil for taking a step forward in improving Stan
ford's curriculum.
We are grateful to the Ford Foundation and
the Carnegie Corporation whose grants made
this study possible and we are proud to he en
rolled at a forward-looking University.
