## Students Comment on Adequacy Of Legislature Representation 
### Dave Scott 
"Do you feel von are properly rep resented
in student government?"
Chuck Wagner, '56, El Cua/Iro: "I don't
know. 1 guess so. My representative fame in
to see me last week. It's tlie first lime it's hap
pened in three and a half years."
Renny Norman, '58, Stern: "ft seems to me
nobody cares what's going on in the government
except the people who are in it. They get
through whatever they want and nobody else
ean do anything about it. I haven't heard any
thing about the reforms Ralph promised to,put
through."
Nan Cerini, gradualo. student. Off-ram pus:
"T think 1 am properly represented in student
government through my representative to the
Legislature.
feel the system of graduate representation
through departments gives graduates a much
better chance lo be represented in student gov
ernment than the system used under the old
constitution, because you are likely to know
the representative, senl by your department
and through him participate in government."
Peggy Graham, .S7, Hranner: "As a sponsor,
T am represented by a freshman elected from
my residence. \\ hile she is very capable, 1 don't
feel that my int 'rests as an upper classman are
well represented."
lom Bibi.fr, 58, Stern: "Students can't be
represented in something for which there is

nothing to represent. Nobody knows what they
want ami if they Â«li<| they couldn't do anything
about it."
Barbara Prescott, '57, Durand: "1 feel we
arc represented in student government hv those
who are interested. But, due to lark of interest
on the part of the students, competition is lark
ing in elections, and it is very difficult for rep
resentatives to express the opinions of students.
Student government has lost close contact with
the students and acts almost separately from
them.
"Part of the correction lies in stimulating
the interest and responsibility of the freshmen;
in house representatives trying to represent,
through house discussions, the opinions of those
they represent, and in the Stanford students
realizing the responsibility themselves."
Jack Swan son, \">7, Toyon: "I don't care
what the ASSU Legislature does. But I believe
if could use some improvement."
Jack Hymans, '58, Stern: "No, 1 don't feel
I am properly represented. 1 don't think stu
dents at Stanford take enough interest in can
didates whom they send to the Legislature and
their representatives do not have the feeling
that they are representing individual students.
"This is shown by the election of our presi
dent last year. The only time interest could
be stimulated among the students >vas by a
colorful candidate."
