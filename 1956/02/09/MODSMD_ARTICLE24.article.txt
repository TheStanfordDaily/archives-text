# First Stanford Frosh Choir Organized by Roble Sponsor
## Christmas Program and Television Debut Constitute Early Projects of Choral Croup 
### 
The class of '59 has organized Stanford's first freshman choir.
With 47 members, the frosh choir has already given a television
show. Tryouts for new members are coming up soon.
Roble sponsor Jody Down. 1 ? conceived the idea of a freshman musi
cal group autumn quarter. Visualizing the choir as a group within

me ciass ramer inan a separate-
University organization, Miss
Downs began planning it.
Tryouts were held in October
by Miss Downs. In December the
choir made its first appearance,
giving a Christmas program at
Roble Hall.
Television Debut
Its television debut came Jan.
28 during the half time of the Stan
ford-Oregon basketball game. For
eight minutes the choir entertain
ed viewers up and down the Pa
cific Coast, with selections from
the musical show "Brigadoon."
This marked the first time a
Stanford choral group had per
formed at a game intermission.
Future choir plans include an
Easter program. At present the
group is working on sacred selec
tions from the works of Bach,
Lassus, Palestrina, Vittoria and
Willan, and also Negro spirituals
which will be included in the pro
gram.
Rehearsals
The choir "meets every Tuesday
night and Thursday afternoon at
the Nitery for an hour and a half.
Miss Downs, a music major, di
rects.
To run the activity an executive
council composed of a president
and section leaders has been es

tablished. Choir members recent
ly elected Mike Bronson presi
dent. Section leaders, who were
selected last fall, are Sue Carter,
(Jeorge Flamer, Joe Ghilarducci,
Micki Pike, Arden Shenker, Carl
Stifel and Sue Thorson.
This council arranges the con
certs, schedules rehearsals and
tryouts and plans social func
tions. A Valentine party is one of
| its present projects.
New Members
Seven new members were ad
mitted to the choir last week.
Tryouts for additional members
will be held Tuesday at 8:30 p.m.
at the Nitery, according to Miss
Downs.
These tryouts consist of sight
reading, voice placement and tone
memory. "No training is neces
sary," said Miss Downs, "but pref
erence is given to those with high
school choir experience.
"It's a class activity and get
together to perform music," Miss
Downs concluded.
