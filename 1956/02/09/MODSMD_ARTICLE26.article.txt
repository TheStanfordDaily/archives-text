# Coach Tries Unorthodox Techniques
## Mermen Await Battle with Yale In National Meet 
### John Weister 
Card Swim Coach Tom Ilaynie
announced recently the perfection
of revolutionary swimming tech
niques which may give the Indian
mermen an edge in the National
Swimming Championships at Yale
next month. '
Perhaps the most startling pro
tege to improve under Haynie's
methods is breast-stroker Colburn
Wilbur. An unknown for the last
two seasons, Wilbur-has virtually
exploded in his exploitation of a
Jlaynie secret.
In an interview, yesterday Wil
bur declared: "Tom told me to
get low. to streamline like a tuna
down there below the surface.
The result: I now get a surging
glide with half the effort."
Most other breast-stroke swim
mers spend do per cent of their
time on top of the water. But the
IJayniemen dive deep into the ele
ment and coast faster than any
one can thrash on the surface.
Wilbur's latest accomplishment
Is a speedy 1:03.0 for the 100-yard
breast stroke, unofficially 0.9 sec
ond under the existing world's
record.
"That's nothing," grinned Ilay
nie. "He's going to take about
four seconds off the world's rec
ord for 200 yards, if his present
pace at 150 yards is any sort of
an indication."

In other strokes, the swim wiz
ard has developed a device which
forces the team members to get
into perfect co-ordination. The de
vice is a long rubber belt which
the swimmer attaches to his
waist.
Holding the other end, Haynie
can tell whether or not there is
continuous pressure on the belt.
If it is uneven, the mentor will
jerk on. it and tlie swimmer will
either get in rhythm or swallow
water.
This particular technique has
aided sprinters, who have the
power but lack the timing for
maximum speed. Such speedsters
as chunky Chuck Clemans and
captain Carver Nixon have bested
their own personal records by
nearly two seconds over last sea
son by using this device.
Dolphinist Fred Miller has
changed from an obscure butter
fly artist to a sizzling mainstay
of the medley relay team by sim
ply achieving co-ordination on
"the belt."
Another innovation of the swim
genius is a veritable turn of ter
ror.
Explaining it himself, Coach

Torn said: "Imagine yourself
watching a close race at 220
yards. One man takes the conven
tional flip turn with a half twist;
the other, a quick kick at the wall
which catapults him through the
air and then under the water. The
conventionalist sees this display
and recoils in terror at the yard
age he has lost on simply one
turn.
"With seven more turns to go,
the man with the modern turn
doesn't need to he as fast a swim
mer to win the race. If he does
have the speed, then he may get
national records by use of this
turn."
In spite of his success, Ilaynie
continually drives himself and his
team harder as the first meet on
Feb. 17 with San Jose draws near.


STANFORD MEDLEY SWIMMER Tom Burton
lunges toward a "turn of terror" on the butter
fly leg of his fin long event. In the turn of terror,
one relay swimmer takes a conventional flip turn
with a half twist; the other, a quick kirk at the
wall which catapults him through the air and
then under the water.

Connecticut, next month. Yale .is favored but

In other strokes, the swim wiz
ard has developed a device which
forces the team members to get
into perfect co-ordination. The de
vice is a long rubber belt which
the swimmer attaches to his
waist.
Holding the other end, Haynie
can tell whether or not there is
continuous pressure on the belt.
If it is uneven, the mentor will
jerk on. it and tlie swimmer will
either get in rhythm or swallow
water.
This particular technique has
aided sprinters, who have the
power but lack the timing for
maximum speed. Such speedsters
as chunky Chuck Clemans and
captain Carver Nixon have bested
their own personal records by
nearly two seconds over last sea
son by using this device.
Dolphinist Fred Miller has
changed from an obscure butter
fly artist to a sizzling mainstay
of the medley relay team by sim

"the belt."
Another innovation of the swim
genius is a veritable turn of ter

Explaining it himself, Coach

Torn said: "Imagine yourself
watching a close race at 220
yards. One man takes the conven
tional flip turn with a half twist;
the other, a quick kick at the wall
which catapults him through the
air and then under the water. The
conventionalist sees this display
and recoils in terror at the yard
age he has lost on simply one
turn.
"With seven more turns to go,
the man with the modern turn
doesn't need to he as fast a swim
mer to win the race. If he does
have the speed, then he may get
national records by use of this
turn."
In spite of his success, Ilaynie
continually drives himself and his
team harder as the first meet on
Feb. 17 with San Jose draws near.


STANFORD MEDLEY SWIMMER Tom Burton
lunges toward a "turn of terror" on the butter

one relay swimmer takes a conventional flip turn
with a half twist; the other, a quick kirk at the

Card Swim Coach Tom Ilaynie
announced recently the perfection
of revolutionary swimming tech

mermen an edge in the National
Swimming Championships at Yale
next month. '
Perhaps the most startling pro
tege to improve under Haynie's
methods is breast-stroker Colburn
Wilbur. An unknown for the last
two seasons, Wilbur-has virtually
exploded in his exploitation of a
Jlaynie secret.
In an interview, yesterday Wil
bur declared: "Tom told me to
get low. to streamline like a tuna
down there below the surface.
The result: I now get a surging
glide with half the effort."
Most other breast-stroke swim
mers spend do per cent of their
time on top of the water. But the
IJayniemen dive deep into the ele
ment and coast faster than any
one can thrash on the surface.
Wilbur's latest accomplishment
Is a speedy 1:03.0 for the 100-yard
breast stroke, unofficially 0.9 sec
ond under the existing world's
record.
"That's nothing," grinned Ilay
nie. "He's going to take about
four seconds off the world's rec
ord for 200 yards, if his present
pace at 150 yards is any sort of
an indication."
