# Theater Bill Teams Two Contrasting One-Acts
## Ultra-Symbolic Psychological Drama Surpasses Badly-Acted Traditional Situation Comedy 
### Stew Toy 
When two one-act plays appear together on a theater bill it is
generally an indication that the management is trying to attract the
public with a pair of classics or is seeking a vehicle for presenting
some untried play with a minimum of box-office gambling.
The latter is apparently the case in the San Francisco Interplayers'
production of Sean O'Casey's —

"Bedtime Story" and George
Hitchcock's new play, "The Tick
et."
But if "Bedtime Story" fails to
stack up as a classic—and the In
terplayers' production fails still
more to make it look like one—a
more unfavorable contrast to the
Hitchcock play could hardly have
been found if it had been planned.
"Bedtime Story" makes no pre
tense of having much of a plot.
In the modern Irish tradition, it
is merely a little lavender art-for
art's-sake "tranche de vie."
Situation
The situation involves a meek
young gentleman who has had his
fling with a prostitute in his flat
and is trying to get rid of her
before he is found out.
The scene is potentially amus
ing, but the cliched acting, with
Irish accents alternately from
Omaha and Budapest, labors the
piece and batters it into extinc
tion.
By contrast, Hitchcock's avant
garde-ish play is a fairly welcome
relief. It opens with an unex
plained and ultra-symbolic lottery
for which the heroine, a disturbed
young thing named Cathy, has
lost her winning ticket.
More Symbols
A psychiatrist emerges from
one of six doors on the stage—

also symbolic — and proceeds to
analyze her to find the missing
ticket.
Divers fantastic persons emerge
from the doors as members of
unfortunate scenes from Cathy's
life. They show her to be shy,
unloved and shamefully uncom
petitive.
Finally the psychiatrist con
vinces her that she really wants
to find the ticket, and 10, it ap
pears miraculously in her hand.
But she forsakes the prize for
a philosophical sign painter who
has a moral to point up: that
winning brings dissatisfaction and
that one must work for what one
gets.
Too Many Morals
The main trouble with "The
Ticket" is its overabundance of
morals—a common fault of young
playwrights — which are thrust
rather amateurishly on the audi
ence, although its fantasy covers
this tendency to some extent.
The acting is far superior to
that in the O'Casey offering. Eva
Wald does a fine job as Cathy.
Paul Dreykus is noteworthy as
the psychiatrist.
Local playwright Hitchcock's
play is certainly no masterpiece,
but it is an amusing hour and is
worth while for the experimental
ly-minded.
