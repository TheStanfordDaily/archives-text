# UNDERGRAD REQUIREMENTS REVAMPED
## Academic Council Passes SUE Recommendations Ford Foundation and Carnegie Corporation Grants Helped Support Two-Year Study 
### 
Stanford's Study of Undergraduate Education, "the most thorough-1
going revision of the undergraduate curriculum in 35 years," has been
approved by the Academic Council, President Wallace Sterling an
nounced yesterday.
Climaxing a two-year appraisal of the undergraduate study pro- j

gram by faculty committees, the—
study has been supported by
grants from the Ford Foundation
and the Carnegie Corporation.
Professor of English Robert j
Hoopes, director of the study,
said many efforts have been made
in the past to "patch up" the cur
riculum when it needed repairs. |
The present study, he said, un
dertook a complete re-evaluation |
and overhaul of the curriculum j
based on the following aims:
"To formulate a program, prop-!
erly administered and imagina- j
tively taught, that can excite in- 1
tellectually the largest number of j
students.
"To give reasonable coverage to
the fields of knowledge, but with-!
out dulling intellectual interest by j
a forced lock • step and without
limiting the highly-gifted."
Greater Variety
The new program is designed !
to give the student greater free
dom of variety in selecting his
study courses for a bachelor's I
degree.
It also increases the range of
general education subjects he
must complete, thus exposing him
to a wider field of knowledge. The
program will not affect students
currently registered at Stanford.
Highlights of the new program
include the following points:
• Entering students may re
ceive up to 15 units for college
level courses taken in high school.
• Freshmen will be required
to take a full year of English, in-j
eluding both composition and!
literature.
• Students will be automali-1
[(•ally freed from required general
studies courses in their major
fields.
• Several social science depart
ments will develop new "terminal;
| courses" designed to familiarize i
[students with these subjects but;
not necessarily to prepare them ,
for further courses in thai field.
There will be no prerequisites for
i a terminal course.
• Students may satisfy up to
four units of the six required
physical education units by par
ticipating in such organized ac
tivities as band, orchestra, chorus
and dramatic productions.
• Students working for the
j A.B. degree who elect foreign lan-
I guage under the general studies
! language-mathematics option will
! be required to take an additional
| four units of foreign language
reading, a course in mathematics
or a course in logic.
• Natural science course re
quirements will be raised two
units from the present 15 to 17 for
students working for the A.B. de
gree.
• Students will be required to
take colloquia in two departments
outside of their major department
during their senior year. Collo
quia will consist of small groups
•of students discussing current
problems in the light of their
studies. They will not be required
of inter-departmental honors pro
gram students or of students who
take Iheir first year of law or
medical school as their senior
| year of college.
• Students may declare their
i major as freshmen. They will be
j required to do so at the beginning
! of their junior year.
• Students will have "absolute
I freedom" to change advisers or

fields of study in order to avoid
"actual or imagined psychological
barriers."
• A permanent committee will
be appointed for the direction and
review of the new General Stud
ies Program, with power to can
cel existing courses in the pro
gram if they fail to meet its needs
and to recommend improvements
in the program.
Ent ranee Requirements
The study also enacted new en
trance requirements, to go into
effect gradually. The new require
ments will not affect current high
school seniors preparing for en
trance this fall.
New entrance requirements
will include the following points:
• An increase from two years
of high school English to three,
plus two years of foreign lan
guage and two of mathematics.
fulfillment of these require
ments may be waived in cases of
exceptional scholarship.
• Satisfactory performance on
subject-matter achievement tests
in addition to the present College
Board Scholastic Aptitude Test.
Hoopes said the work of the j
committee "represents an impres
sive example of concentrated and
judicious thought and analysis. A
program has been enacted which
we hope will add intellectual rigor
as well as intellectual variety to
the total educational experience
of the Stanford undergraduate."

Stanford's Study of Undergraduate Education, "the most thorough-1
going revision of the undergraduate curriculum in 35 years," has been
approved by the Academic Council, President Wallace Sterling an
nounced yesterday.
Climaxing a two-year appraisal of the undergraduate study pro- j

gram by faculty committees, the—
study has been supported by
grants from the Ford Foundation
and the Carnegie Corporation.
Professor of English Robert j
Hoopes, director of the study,
said many efforts have been made
in the past to "patch up" the cur
riculum when it needed repairs. |
The present study, he said, un
dertook a complete re-evaluation |
and overhaul of the curriculum j
based on the following aims:
"To formulate a program, prop-!
erly administered and imagina- j
tively taught, that can excite in- 1
tellectually the largest number of j
students.
"To give reasonable coverage to
the fields of knowledge, but with-!
out dulling intellectual interest by j
a forced lock • step and without
limiting the highly-gifted."
Greater Variety
The new program is designed !
to give the student greater free
dom of variety in selecting his
study courses for a bachelor's I
degree.
It also increases the range of
general education subjects he
must complete, thus exposing him
to a wider field of knowledge. The
program will not affect students
currently registered at Stanford.
Highlights of the new program
include the following points:
• Entering students may re
ceive up to 15 units for college
level courses taken in high school.
• Freshmen will be required
to take a full year of English, in-j
eluding both composition and!
literature.
• Students will be automali-1
[(•ally freed from required general
studies courses in their major
fields.
• Several social science depart
ments will develop new "terminal;
| courses" designed to familiarize i
[students with these subjects but;
not necessarily to prepare them ,
for further courses in thai field.
There will be no prerequisites for
i a terminal course.
• Students may satisfy up to
four units of the six required
physical education units by par
ticipating in such organized ac
tivities as band, orchestra, chorus
and dramatic productions.
• Students working for the
j A.B. degree who elect foreign lan-
I guage under the general studies
! language-mathematics option will
! be required to take an additional
| four units of foreign language
reading, a course in mathematics
or a course in logic.
• Natural science course re
quirements will be raised two
units from the present 15 to 17 for
students working for the A.B. de
gree.
• Students will be required to
take colloquia in two departments
outside of their major department
during their senior year. Collo
quia will consist of small groups
•of students discussing current
problems in the light of their
studies. They will not be required
of inter-departmental honors pro
gram students or of students who
take Iheir first year of law or
medical school as their senior
| year of college.
• Students may declare their
i major as freshmen. They will be
j required to do so at the beginning
! of their junior year.
• Students will have "absolute
I freedom" to change advisers or

fields of study in order to avoid
"actual or imagined psychological
barriers."
• A permanent committee will
be appointed for the direction and
review of the new General Stud
ies Program, with power to can
cel existing courses in the pro
gram if they fail to meet its needs
and to recommend improvements
in the program.
Ent ranee Requirements
The study also enacted new en
trance requirements, to go into
effect gradually. The new require
ments will not affect current high
school seniors preparing for en
trance this fall.
New entrance requirements
will include the following points:
• An increase from two years
of high school English to three,
plus two years of foreign lan
guage and two of mathematics.
fulfillment of these require
ments may be waived in cases of

Ent ranee Requirements
The study also enacted new en
trance requirements, to go into
effect gradually. The new require

school seniors preparing for en
trance this fall.
New entrance requirements
will include the following points:
• An increase from two years
of high school English to three,
plus two years of foreign lan
guage and two of mathematics.
fulfillment of these require
ments may be waived in cases of
exceptional scholarship.
• Satisfactory performance on
subject-matter achievement tests
in addition to the present College
Board Scholastic Aptitude Test.
Hoopes said the work of the j
committee "represents an impres
sive example of concentrated and
judicious thought and analysis. A
program has been enacted which
we hope will add intellectual rigor
as well as intellectual variety to
the total educational experience
of the Stanford undergraduate."

Stanford's Study of Undergraduate Education, "the most thorough-1
going revision of the undergraduate curriculum in 35 years," has been
approved by the Academic Council, President Wallace Sterling an
nounced yesterday.
Climaxing a two-year appraisal of the undergraduate study pro- j

gram by faculty committees, the—
study has been supported by
grants from the Ford Foundation
and the Carnegie Corporation.
Professor of English Robert j
Hoopes, director of the study,
said many efforts have been made
in the past to "patch up" the cur
riculum when it needed repairs. |
The present study, he said, un
dertook a complete re-evaluation |
and overhaul of the curriculum j
based on the following aims:
"To formulate a program, prop-!
erly administered and imagina- j
tively taught, that can excite in- 1
tellectually the largest number of j
students.
"To give reasonable coverage to
the fields of knowledge, but with-!
out dulling intellectual interest by j
a forced lock • step and without
limiting the highly-gifted."
Greater Variety
The new program is designed !
to give the student greater free
dom of variety in selecting his
study courses for a bachelor's I
degree.
It also increases the range of
general education subjects he
must complete, thus exposing him
to a wider field of knowledge. The
program will not affect students
currently registered at Stanford.
Highlights of the new program
include the following points:
• Entering students may re
ceive up to 15 units for college
level courses taken in high school.
• Freshmen will be required
to take a full year of English, in-j
eluding both composition and!
literature.
• Students will be automali-1
[(•ally freed from required general
studies courses in their major
fields.
• Several social science depart
ments will develop new "terminal;
| courses" designed to familiarize i
[students with these subjects but;
not necessarily to prepare them ,
for further courses in thai field.
There will be no prerequisites for
i a terminal course.
• Students may satisfy up to
four units of the six required
physical education units by par
ticipating in such organized ac
tivities as band, orchestra, chorus
and dramatic productions.
• Students working for the
j A.B. degree who elect foreign lan-
I guage under the general studies
! language-mathematics option will
! be required to take an additional
| four units of foreign language
reading, a course in mathematics
or a course in logic.
• Natural science course re
quirements will be raised two
units from the present 15 to 17 for
students working for the A.B. de
gree.
