Miss Lucy also filed for an injunction against the University Dean
of Women Sarah Hcaley for failing fo provide full university dining

room and living facilities for the

jail sentences for 11 university
officials if they failed to obey a
future court order to readmit her.

answers on Feb. 27. Judge
Grooms set a hearing on a tem
porary order for Feb. 29.
However, Judge Grooms denied
a move to get an injunction forc
ing Dean Hcaley to keep a room
open for the Negro woman in

turn to classes.

sons named as defendants were
Alabama President O. C. Carmi
chael, Dean of Admissions W. F.
