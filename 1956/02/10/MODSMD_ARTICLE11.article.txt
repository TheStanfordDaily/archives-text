# Indian Sharpshooters to Face High-Flying Bruins
## Naulls, Taft Lead Uclan Title Hopes Cards Flay Tonight, Tomorrow at 8 P.M. 
### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
Stanford's rested cage warriors
begin two weeks of crucial bas
ketball action at 8 tonight when
the UCLA Bruins enter the Pa
vilion for- the curtain-raiser of a
Lwo-game series.
Coach Howie Dallmar's small
but scrappy quintet puts its cham
pionship aspirations on the block
against the conference - leading
Bruins here this weekend and
USC next week in Los Angeles.
The Trojans are tied with the
Indians for second place in the
PCC.
UCLA will come on the floor
tonight with the two best-point-a
game scorers in the conferenceâ€”
n;imely, Willie (The Whale)
Nan lis and Morris (The Ga/.elle)
Taft. Naulls and Taft are the only
cagers in the PCC who have av
eraged over 20 points a contest.
Better Balance
Coach John Wooden's aces, both
seniors and two-year lettermen,
have had to carry Ihe Bruins
through most of the season. Last
weekend, however, the Uclan
served notice that they aren't de
pendent upon their deadly duo by
beating Washington, 82 to 75, in
spite of the fact that Naulls foul
ed out early in the second half.
Five of the Westwood hoopsters
scored in double digits against the
Huskies.
Only one other senior is on the
Uclan roster. Forward A 1 Her
ring, who hit his peak with a 17-
point effort against Washington,
will start for the Bruins.
Adams, Burke Start
Rounding out the lineup for the
j circuit leading visitors will be let-
I terman guard Carroll Adams and
' junior forward Connie Burke.
; Dick Banton, a tricky junior col-
I lege transfer who is being groom
! Ed to replace Taft next year, will
j see plenty of action at guard.
The starting team that Wooden
will place on the floor will av
erage over 6-3. Stanford has only
one regular, 6-4 center Barry
Brown, who stands as high as the
Uclan average.
Stanford will be carrying a 51-
17 lead into the series so far as
victories in the all-time records
between the two schools are con
cerned.
The Bruins will enter tonight's
game with a three-game winning
streak. UCLA has captured 11 of
their last 12 games against the
Indians.
Fast Break
Coach John Wooden can be ex
pected to throw a fast-breaking
; style of attack spearheaded by
Taft at the Tribe. The speedy
| Bruins have averaged over 82
points a game this season in con
ference play.
One aid the Indians will have
j this weekend is the home court
j advantage. The Cards have not
|yd been beaten in the Pavilion
| this year.
Many observers have claimed
that I he Bruin team this year does
not nearly compare with Wood
en's quintets of previous seasons.
Weak Opposition
The Westwood outfit's record
of only II wins and five setbacks
cannot lie considered outstanding.
Only Washington, within Ihe con
i ference, has been suitable opposi
tion for the Bruins, and the Hus
kies came within five seconds of
beating UCLA on their home
court.
The question of just how good
Ihe Bruins really are should be
answered in the Pavilion this
I weekend.
