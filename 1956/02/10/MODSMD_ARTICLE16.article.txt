# Post Office Site Clarified by Glover
## 
### 
Frederic: O. Glover, assistant to
the president, said thai tho new
University post office will be
built on a site that adjoins the
SAE fraternity house, rather than
on the location of the existing
house as reported recently in The
Daily.
Glover did say that the location
of the house Was unfortunate
from the University's long-range
planning point <Â»1 view, and that
University and SAE officials were
discussing this problem.
