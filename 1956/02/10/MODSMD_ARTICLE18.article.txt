## Riots Mark First Open Use of Arms Since '39 
### 
MADRID, Feb. 9 (UP)â€”More
than 1500 studenls clashed in the
streets of downtown Madrid today
in bloody riots marked by the
first open use of firearms since
the Spanish civil war of 1936-39.
Reliable sources reported at
least 40 to 50 injured, 10 serious
ly. One of the victims, a Falangist
student, was shot in the head and
was not expected to live.
Sixty persons were arrested in
the investigation of the shooting
of the student.
The battle, between pro- and
anti-Falangist Madrid University
students, was broken up by flying
squads of club-wielding police.
Classes were suspended by the
dean until Saturday.
Falange
The Falange is the "national
movement" which supports Gen
eralissimo Francisco Franco.
The press in general ignored
the rioting, but the Falange organ
Arriba attributed it to the clan
destine Communist publication,
Mundo Obrero. Government cir
cles blamed "agents provocateur."
The Spanish Ministry of Inte
rior flashed reports of the clashes
to Franco at his El Prado resi
dence on the outskirts of the city.
Monarchist students defied the
armed police and Falangist stu
dents to distribute leaflets which
charged that the pro-Franco Span
ish university syndicate was us
ing the "best methods of the Ges
tapo and the GPU (Russian se
cret police)."
Police Come
Busloads of gray-uniformed po
lice and jeep patrols finally dis
persed the students with swinging
truncheons. Scores of demonstra
tors were reported arrested.
The worst clash occurred in the
Arquelles district of Madrid. Mon
archist and anti-Falangist stu
dents marched from the nearby
law college to a spot where the
blue-shirted Falangists were con
cluding a commemoration for a
student killed in the civil war.
The two sides squared off in a
shouting match and then clashed.
Out came clubs, stones, knives.
Then the shooting began.
