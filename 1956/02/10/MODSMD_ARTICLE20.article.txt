# In Answer to Bigotry
## 
### 
Social progress usually comes slowly; it
comes only so fast as those in the social body
will allow.
The social body is made up of all peoples, all
with much the same aspirations. This is true
whether they are black or white, whether they
live in Stanford, California or in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama.
Skin pigmentation or piace ot residence does
not alter the social aspiration. It mav be ex
press •! in difU nt <• . ys, it may even be ex
pressed il °»l#»r»Ci
These are accepted truisms in today's enlight
ened world.
The bigoted, the uneducated, the blind, the
prejudiced will disclaim them as such, twisting
their basic truth to correspond with their own
narrow-minded, smug outlook.
This has been the case in the United States
for many years. The uncompromising white
Southerner, and some of his northern brothers,
has sought to raise his social position at the
expense of the Negro.
W hat more secure feeling can a person have
than that of ! eing superior to some other per
son? And so the Southern white has raised his
self-esteem by claiming .superiority to the Ne
gro.
I he Negro, part of the social body, has also
sought to raise his position —also at the expense
of someone else —the white man. But he is
seeking a rise to equality. An equality which
he deserves to attain.
And the liberal and intelligent-thinking
white has recognized this Negro desire. A com
bination of this recognition and the Negro's
unending fight for equality was finally noted
by the supreme law of the land.
In May 1954 and again last year the United
States Supreme Court declared segregation in
schools to be contrary to the Constitution's 14th
Amendment.
So the Negro stands on a level equal with the
white man in the most important of life's re
quirements—in education. Progress has finally
culminated in legal recognition of a social de
sire.
Unfortunately there are still those who feel
the Negro has no right to equality, who rant
about "white superiority" and who feel the
Negro should be separated from the white man,
because of his skin coloring.
' Equal, and often better, educational facili
ties are provided for the Negro student as com
pared to those available to the wliites." This is
a common argument favoring segregation of the
races.
Is an institution of learning equal because it
has fine buildings or because it has the same
instruction, the same access to information
sources?
This relegates the American Negro to what
Ravford W. Logan calls "Democracy Third-
Class. He sa> s, "Segregation in schools con
stantly reminds Negroes of their 'inferiority'."
Logan is a professor of history at Howard
University who received the Ph.D. from Harv
ard Lnncrsity In 1936. lie in a Negro.
e agree with Logan. The American Negro
wi'l not have cn.'.ilitv n, education until he can
choose whore V wantf to study—and be ac
cepted or re;V. ted on his choice strictly on the
basis of ac u!ci:iV achievement, not skin color
ing. /
In a letter in The Daily today the writer
claims, Most responsible Negro leaders in the
South were rot for integration of the races."
I liurgoo 1 Marshall, on Time Magazine's
cover last yea , has been leading the quest for
desegregation. T'is Negro, a leading constitu
tional law t. "Ttainly qualifies as a sound
source '.ejro really wants.
He hi - t! roughout the South de
voting ail a. hi. waking hours to the problem.
But he is merely a spokesman. Certainly lie is
not devoting so much selfless w r ork to a cause
which no or.e really wants to see achieved.
Ihe w»iter must ag:*ee that most responsible
Negro leaders want their race equal to the white
and that equality cannot be reached until the
Negro is given "First-Class," not "Third-Class,"
citizenship. \
As for equality of educational facilities, they
may well be equal, as far as physical structure
goes—and this only in the urban communities
(such as Birmingham).
New buildings may have been erected but
that is the easy way out of a difficult problem.
I he gulf between the Negro and the white is
wide enough in the South, why widen it more
by further separation of the two?
"I he social make-up of the South is not com
parable to that of the remainder of the nation.
Both responsible whites and Negroes realize
this, and prefer segregation."

We are all part of the same social structure.
We are all part of the same nation. A bloody
war was once fought to prove this. A man of
the responsibility of ex-President Harry S. Tru
man is violently against segregation, has said so
many times.
And just last week Estes Kefauver took a
stand against the practice, despite the effects
it may have on his presidential aspirations.
And the most responsible of all Americans,
President Eisenhower, has manifested his feel
ings on segregation in the form of actual ac
complishments.
Integration has started during his administra
tion and he has backed his party's 14-point pro
gram of civil rights for the Negro, which in
cludes integration.
Chief Justice Earl Warren and the majority
of the Supreme Court justices see the evils of
segregation.
On the other hand there are men who have
spoken against integration of the races. But
they are hardly "responsible." One example
should suffice.
Remember Herman Tahnadge from Georgia?
Doubtless one of the worst blights on the Amer
ican political scene in years.
Segregation and inequality are synonymous
in the South—South, North, East or West, not
having the right choice of school is certainly
not having equality.
We do not claim to have done an on-the-spot
extensive study of the problems of the South,
we only know what responsible leaders—Negro
and white alike tell us. And we know what the
man in the street says—the Negro wants, and
will soon get, equality in schools.
He will get this despite the mobs who would
deny a fellow citizen his civil rights simply be
cause of his skin pigmentation, or because they
feel they have a different social make-up than
the rest of our free nation.
We are certain the United States Supreme
Court did make an extensive study of the "real
problems" of the South. Nobody as responsible
as the court would venture to make such a de
cision as they made in the matter of desegrega
tion without such study.
The latest mob violence in Alabama brought
a typical comment from Governor James E. Fol
som, "We are not excited."
Here are the words of what must be unfor
tunately counted a responsible leader, a state's
chief executive. Such opinions carry no weight
with us; people are being incited to dangerous
rioting and what does their leader say? "Not
excited."
As previously we express our hope in the top
youth leaders of the South, the "leaders of to
morrow. ' I hey, along with other delegates to
the National Students Association convention
in Minnesota last summer, which included the
nation s top student leaders, passed a resolution
which read in part:
"USNSA stands for immediate desegregation
in higher education. USNSA stands vigorously
opposed to economic, social, and political coer
cion against persons or organizations favoring
desegregation."
This is how the students feel, white and
Negro alike. Leaders in a democracy are sup
posed to follow the will of their people. Is
instituting a program of segregation and allow
ing mob violence following the will of the
people?
That the Negro has the right, both Constitu
tionally and morally, to integrated education
has been proved. That he wants it has also been
proved.
The aforementioned Marshall "mobilized a
snail amy of psychologists, psychiatrists, so
ciologists and anthropologists to prove what
every Negro among them believed to be ob
vious: that segregated education could not be
equal."
And the Negro wants equal education, the de-
Segregated kind.
Said Marshall: "Why, of all the multitudin
ous groups of people in this country, [do] you
have to single out the Negroes and give them
this separate treatment?"
It is obvious that, as Time Magazine so aptly
put it, "Today's drive of the U.S. Negro toward
equality is as strong as any social tide in Asia
or Africa or Europe."
Progress is with us, it is a living reality. The
Negro will be equal to the white man, in educa
tion as well as in all other things. It is not going
to happen, it has happened.
It is time all awoke to this fact, this situation
which marks the success "of an effort to remove
from American life a paralyzing sting in its con
science and the ugliest blot upon its good name
irf the world."
Social progress usually comes slowly; it
comes only so fast as those in the social body
will allow.
The social body is made up of all peoples, all

we only know what responsible leaders—Negro
and white alike tell us. And we know what the
man in the street says—the Negro wants, and
will soon get, equality in schools.
He will get this despite the mobs who would
deny a fellow citizen his civil rights simply be
cause of his skin pigmentation, or because they
feel they have a different social make-up than
the rest of our free nation.
We are certain the United States Supreme
Court did make an extensive study of the "real
problems" of the South. Nobody as responsible
as the court would venture to make such a de
cision as they made in the matter of desegrega
tion without such study.
The latest mob violence in Alabama brought
a typical comment from Governor James E. Fol
som, "We are not excited."
Here are the words of what must be unfor
tunately counted a responsible leader, a state's
chief executive. Such opinions carry no weight
with us; people are being incited to dangerous
rioting and what does their leader say? "Not
excited."
As previously we express our hope in the top
youth leaders of the South, the "leaders of to
morrow. ' I hey, along with other delegates to
the National Students Association convention
in Minnesota last summer, which included the
nation s top student leaders, passed a resolution
which read in part:
"USNSA stands for immediate desegregation
in higher education. USNSA stands vigorously
opposed to economic, social, and political coer
cion against persons or organizations favoring
desegregation."
This is how the students feel, white and
Negro alike. Leaders in a democracy are sup
posed to follow the will of their people. Is
instituting a program of segregation and allow
ing mob violence following the will of the
people?
That the Negro has the right, both Constitu
tionally and morally, to integrated education
has been proved. That he wants it has also been
proved.
The aforementioned Marshall "mobilized a
snail amy of psychologists, psychiatrists, so
ciologists and anthropologists to prove what
every Negro among them believed to be ob
vious: that segregated education could not be
equal."
And the Negro wants equal education, the de-
Segregated kind.
Said Marshall: "Why, of all the multitudin
ous groups of people in this country, [do] you
have to single out the Negroes and give them
this separate treatment?"
It is obvious that, as Time Magazine so aptly
put it, "Today's drive of the U.S. Negro toward
equality is as strong as any social tide in Asia
or Africa or Europe."
Progress is with us, it is a living reality. The
Negro will be equal to the white man, in educa
tion as well as in all other things. It is not going
to happen, it has happened.
It is time all awoke to this fact, this situation
which marks the success "of an effort to remove
from American life a paralyzing sting in its con
science and the ugliest blot upon its good name
irf the world."
Social progress usually comes slowly; it
comes only so fast as those in the social body
will allow.
The social body is made up of all peoples, all
with much the same aspirations. This is true
whether they are black or white, whether they
live in Stanford, California or in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama.
Skin pigmentation or piace ot residence does
not alter the social aspiration. It mav be ex
press •! in difU nt <• . ys, it may even be ex

These are accepted truisms in today's enlight
ened world.
The bigoted, the uneducated, the blind, the
prejudiced will disclaim them as such, twisting
their basic truth to correspond with their own
narrow-minded, smug outlook.
This has been the case in the United States
for many years. The uncompromising white
Southerner, and some of his northern brothers,
has sought to raise his social position at the
expense of the Negro.
W hat more secure feeling can a person have
than that of ! eing superior to some other per
son? And so the Southern white has raised his
self-esteem by claiming .superiority to the Ne
gro.
I he Negro, part of the social body, has also
sought to raise his position —also at the expense
of someone else —the white man. But he is
seeking a rise to equality. An equality which
he deserves to attain.
And the liberal and intelligent-thinking
white has recognized this Negro desire. A com
bination of this recognition and the Negro's
unending fight for equality was finally noted
by the supreme law of the land.
In May 1954 and again last year the United
States Supreme Court declared segregation in
schools to be contrary to the Constitution's 14th
Amendment.
So the Negro stands on a level equal with the
white man in the most important of life's re
quirements—in education. Progress has finally
culminated in legal recognition of a social de
sire.
Unfortunately there are still those who feel
the Negro has no right to equality, who rant
about "white superiority" and who feel the
Negro should be separated from the white man,
because of his skin coloring.
' Equal, and often better, educational facili
ties are provided for the Negro student as com
pared to those available to the wliites." This is
a common argument favoring segregation of the
races.
Is an institution of learning equal because it
has fine buildings or because it has the same
instruction, the same access to information
sources?
This relegates the American Negro to what
Ravford W. Logan calls "Democracy Third-
Class. He sa> s, "Segregation in schools con

Ihe w»iter must ag:*ee that most responsible
Negro leaders want their race equal to the white
and that equality cannot be reached until the
Negro is given "First-Class," not "Third-Class,"
citizenship. \
As for equality of educational facilities, they

New buildings may have been erected but
that is the easy way out of a difficult problem.

"I he social make-up of the South is not com

We are all part of the same social structure.
We are all part of the same nation. A bloody

many times.

stand against the practice, despite the effects
it may have on his presidential aspirations.

President Eisenhower, has manifested his feel

complishments.
Integration has started during his administra
tion and he has backed his party's 14-point pro

cludes integration.
Chief Justice Earl Warren and the majority
of the Supreme Court justices see the evils of
segregation.
On the other hand there are men who have
spoken against integration of the races. But
they are hardly "responsible." One example
should suffice.
Remember Herman Tahnadge from Georgia?
Doubtless one of the worst blights on the Amer

wide enough in the South, why widen it more
by further separation of the two?
"I he social make-up of the South is not com
parable to that of the remainder of the nation.
Both responsible whites and Negroes realize
this, and prefer segregation."

We are all part of the same social structure.
We are all part of the same nation. A bloody
war was once fought to prove this. A man of
the responsibility of ex-President Harry S. Tru
man is violently against segregation, has said so
many times.
And just last week Estes Kefauver took a
stand against the practice, despite the effects
it may have on his presidential aspirations.
And the most responsible of all Americans,
President Eisenhower, has manifested his feel
ings on segregation in the form of actual ac
complishments.
Integration has started during his administra
tion and he has backed his party's 14-point pro
gram of civil rights for the Negro, which in
cludes integration.
Chief Justice Earl Warren and the majority
of the Supreme Court justices see the evils of
segregation.
On the other hand there are men who have
spoken against integration of the races. But
they are hardly "responsible." One example
should suffice.
Remember Herman Tahnadge from Georgia?
Doubtless one of the worst blights on the Amer
ican political scene in years.
Segregation and inequality are synonymous
in the South—South, North, East or West, not
having the right choice of school is certainly
not having equality.
We do not claim to have done an on-the-spot
extensive study of the problems of the South,
we only know what responsible leaders—Negro
and white alike tell us. And we know what the
man in the street says—the Negro wants, and
will soon get, equality in schools.
He will get this despite the mobs who would
deny a fellow citizen his civil rights simply be
cause of his skin pigmentation, or because they
feel they have a different social make-up than
the rest of our free nation.
We are certain the United States Supreme
Court did make an extensive study of the "real
problems" of the South. Nobody as responsible
as the court would venture to make such a de
cision as they made in the matter of desegrega
tion without such study.
The latest mob violence in Alabama brought
a typical comment from Governor James E. Fol
som, "We are not excited."
Here are the words of what must be unfor
tunately counted a responsible leader, a state's
chief executive. Such opinions carry no weight
with us; people are being incited to dangerous
rioting and what does their leader say? "Not
excited."
As previously we express our hope in the top
youth leaders of the South, the "leaders of to
morrow. ' I hey, along with other delegates to
the National Students Association convention
in Minnesota last summer, which included the
nation s top student leaders, passed a resolution
which read in part:
"USNSA stands for immediate desegregation
in higher education. USNSA stands vigorously
opposed to economic, social, and political coer
cion against persons or organizations favoring
desegregation."
This is how the students feel, white and
Negro alike. Leaders in a democracy are sup
posed to follow the will of their people. Is
instituting a program of segregation and allow
ing mob violence following the will of the
people?
That the Negro has the right, both Constitu
tionally and morally, to integrated education
has been proved. That he wants it has also been
proved.
The aforementioned Marshall "mobilized a
snail amy of psychologists, psychiatrists, so
ciologists and anthropologists to prove what
every Negro among them believed to be ob
vious: that segregated education could not be
equal."
And the Negro wants equal education, the de-
Segregated kind.
Said Marshall: "Why, of all the multitudin
ous groups of people in this country, [do] you
have to single out the Negroes and give them
this separate treatment?"
It is obvious that, as Time Magazine so aptly
put it, "Today's drive of the U.S. Negro toward
equality is as strong as any social tide in Asia
or Africa or Europe."
Progress is with us, it is a living reality. The
Negro will be equal to the white man, in educa
tion as well as in all other things. It is not going
to happen, it has happened.
It is time all awoke to this fact, this situation
which marks the success "of an effort to remove
from American life a paralyzing sting in its con
science and the ugliest blot upon its good name
irf the world."
Social progress usually comes slowly; it
comes only so fast as those in the social body
will allow.
The social body is made up of all peoples, all
with much the same aspirations. This is true
whether they are black or white, whether they
live in Stanford, California or in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama.
Skin pigmentation or piace ot residence does
not alter the social aspiration. It mav be ex
press •! in difU nt <• . ys, it may even be ex
pressed il °»l#»r»Ci
These are accepted truisms in today's enlight
ened world.
The bigoted, the uneducated, the blind, the
prejudiced will disclaim them as such, twisting
their basic truth to correspond with their own
narrow-minded, smug outlook.
This has been the case in the United States
for many years. The uncompromising white
Southerner, and some of his northern brothers,
has sought to raise his social position at the
expense of the Negro.
W hat more secure feeling can a person have
than that of ! eing superior to some other per
son? And so the Southern white has raised his
self-esteem by claiming .superiority to the Ne
gro.
I he Negro, part of the social body, has also
sought to raise his position —also at the expense
of someone else —the white man. But he is
seeking a rise to equality. An equality which
he deserves to attain.
And the liberal and intelligent-thinking
white has recognized this Negro desire. A com
bination of this recognition and the Negro's
unending fight for equality was finally noted
by the supreme law of the land.
In May 1954 and again last year the United
States Supreme Court declared segregation in
schools to be contrary to the Constitution's 14th
Amendment.
So the Negro stands on a level equal with the
white man in the most important of life's re
quirements—in education. Progress has finally
culminated in legal recognition of a social de
sire.
Unfortunately there are still those who feel
the Negro has no right to equality, who rant
about "white superiority" and who feel the
Negro should be separated from the white man,
because of his skin coloring.
' Equal, and often better, educational facili
ties are provided for the Negro student as com
pared to those available to the wliites." This is
a common argument favoring segregation of the
races.
Is an institution of learning equal because it
has fine buildings or because it has the same
instruction, the same access to information
sources?
This relegates the American Negro to what
Ravford W. Logan calls "Democracy Third-
Class. He sa> s, "Segregation in schools con
stantly reminds Negroes of their 'inferiority'."
Logan is a professor of history at Howard
University who received the Ph.D. from Harv

Social progress usually comes slowly; it
comes only so fast as those in the social body
will allow.
The social body is made up of all peoples, all
with much the same aspirations. This is true
whether they are black or white, whether they
live in Stanford, California or in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama.

These are accepted truisms in today's enlight
ened world.
The bigoted, the uneducated, the blind, the
prejudiced will disclaim them as such, twisting
their basic truth to correspond with their own
narrow-minded, smug outlook.
This has been the case in the United States
for many years. The uncompromising white
Southerner, and some of his northern brothers,
has sought to raise his social position at the
expense of the Negro.
W hat more secure feeling can a person have
than that of ! eing superior to some other per
son? And so the Southern white has raised his
self-esteem by claiming .superiority to the Ne
gro.
I he Negro, part of the social body, has also
sought to raise his position —also at the expense
of someone else —the white man. But he is
seeking a rise to equality. An equality which
he deserves to attain.
And the liberal and intelligent-thinking
white has recognized this Negro desire. A com
bination of this recognition and the Negro's
unending fight for equality was finally noted
by the supreme law of the land.
In May 1954 and again last year the United
States Supreme Court declared segregation in
schools to be contrary to the Constitution's 14th
Amendment.
So the Negro stands on a level equal with the
white man in the most important of life's re
quirements—in education. Progress has finally
culminated in legal recognition of a social de
sire.
Unfortunately there are still those who feel
the Negro has no right to equality, who rant
about "white superiority" and who feel the
Negro should be separated from the white man,
because of his skin coloring.
' Equal, and often better, educational facili
ties are provided for the Negro student as com
pared to those available to the wliites." This is
a common argument favoring segregation of the
races.
Is an institution of learning equal because it
has fine buildings or because it has the same
instruction, the same access to information
sources?
This relegates the American Negro to what
Ravford W. Logan calls "Democracy Third-
Class. He sa> s, "Segregation in schools con

wide enough in the South, why widen it more
by further separation of the two?
"I he social make-up of the South is not com

Both responsible whites and Negroes realize
this, and prefer segregation."

We are all part of the same social structure.
We are all part of the same nation. A bloody
war was once fought to prove this. A man of
the responsibility of ex-President Harry S. Tru
man is violently against segregation, has said so
many times.
And just last week Estes Kefauver took a
stand against the practice, despite the effects
it may have on his presidential aspirations.
And the most responsible of all Americans,
President Eisenhower, has manifested his feel
ings on segregation in the form of actual ac
complishments.
Integration has started during his administra
tion and he has backed his party's 14-point pro
gram of civil rights for the Negro, which in
cludes integration.
Chief Justice Earl Warren and the majority
of the Supreme Court justices see the evils of
segregation.
On the other hand there are men who have
spoken against integration of the races. But
they are hardly "responsible." One example
should suffice.
Remember Herman Tahnadge from Georgia?
Doubtless one of the worst blights on the Amer
ican political scene in years.
Segregation and inequality are synonymous
in the South—South, North, East or West, not
having the right choice of school is certainly
not having equality.
We do not claim to have done an on-the-spot
extensive study of the problems of the South,
we only know what responsible leaders—Negro
and white alike tell us. And we know what the
man in the street says—the Negro wants, and
will soon get, equality in schools.
He will get this despite the mobs who would
deny a fellow citizen his civil rights simply be
cause of his skin pigmentation, or because they
feel they have a different social make-up than
the rest of our free nation.
We are certain the United States Supreme
Court did make an extensive study of the "real
problems" of the South. Nobody as responsible
as the court would venture to make such a de
cision as they made in the matter of desegrega
tion without such study.
The latest mob violence in Alabama brought
a typical comment from Governor James E. Fol
som, "We are not excited."
Here are the words of what must be unfor
tunately counted a responsible leader, a state's
chief executive. Such opinions carry no weight
with us; people are being incited to dangerous
rioting and what does their leader say? "Not
excited."
As previously we express our hope in the top
youth leaders of the South, the "leaders of to
morrow. ' I hey, along with other delegates to
the National Students Association convention
in Minnesota last summer, which included the
nation s top student leaders, passed a resolution
which read in part:
"USNSA stands for immediate desegregation
in higher education. USNSA stands vigorously
opposed to economic, social, and political coer
cion against persons or organizations favoring
desegregation."
This is how the students feel, white and
Negro alike. Leaders in a democracy are sup
posed to follow the will of their people. Is
instituting a program of segregation and allow
ing mob violence following the will of the
people?
That the Negro has the right, both Constitu
tionally and morally, to integrated education
has been proved. That he wants it has also been
proved.
The aforementioned Marshall "mobilized a
snail amy of psychologists, psychiatrists, so
ciologists and anthropologists to prove what
every Negro among them believed to be ob
vious: that segregated education could not be
equal."
And the Negro wants equal education, the de-
Segregated kind.
Said Marshall: "Why, of all the multitudin
ous groups of people in this country, [do] you
have to single out the Negroes and give them
this separate treatment?"
It is obvious that, as Time Magazine so aptly
put it, "Today's drive of the U.S. Negro toward
equality is as strong as any social tide in Asia
or Africa or Europe."
Progress is with us, it is a living reality. The
Negro will be equal to the white man, in educa
tion as well as in all other things. It is not going
to happen, it has happened.
It is time all awoke to this fact, this situation
which marks the success "of an effort to remove
from American life a paralyzing sting in its con

having the right choice of school is certainly
not having equality.
We do not claim to have done an on-the-spot
extensive study of the problems of the South,
we only know what responsible leaders—Negro
and white alike tell us. And we know what the
man in the street says—the Negro wants, and
will soon get, equality in schools.
He will get this despite the mobs who would
deny a fellow citizen his civil rights simply be
cause of his skin pigmentation, or because they
feel they have a different social make-up than
the rest of our free nation.
We are certain the United States Supreme
Court did make an extensive study of the "real
problems" of the South. Nobody as responsible
as the court would venture to make such a de
cision as they made in the matter of desegrega
tion without such study.
The latest mob violence in Alabama brought
a typical comment from Governor James E. Fol
som, "We are not excited."
Here are the words of what must be unfor
tunately counted a responsible leader, a state's
chief executive. Such opinions carry no weight
with us; people are being incited to dangerous
rioting and what does their leader say? "Not
excited."
As previously we express our hope in the top
youth leaders of the South, the "leaders of to
morrow. ' I hey, along with other delegates to
the National Students Association convention
in Minnesota last summer, which included the
nation s top student leaders, passed a resolution
which read in part:
"USNSA stands for immediate desegregation
in higher education. USNSA stands vigorously
opposed to economic, social, and political coer
cion against persons or organizations favoring
desegregation."
This is how the students feel, white and
Negro alike. Leaders in a democracy are sup
posed to follow the will of their people. Is
instituting a program of segregation and allow
ing mob violence following the will of the
people?
That the Negro has the right, both Constitu
tionally and morally, to integrated education
has been proved. That he wants it has also been
proved.
The aforementioned Marshall "mobilized a
snail amy of psychologists, psychiatrists, so
ciologists and anthropologists to prove what
every Negro among them believed to be ob
vious: that segregated education could not be
equal."
And the Negro wants equal education, the de-
Segregated kind.
Said Marshall: "Why, of all the multitudin
ous groups of people in this country, [do] you
have to single out the Negroes and give them
this separate treatment?"
It is obvious that, as Time Magazine so aptly
put it, "Today's drive of the U.S. Negro toward
equality is as strong as any social tide in Asia
or Africa or Europe."
Progress is with us, it is a living reality. The
Negro will be equal to the white man, in educa
tion as well as in all other things. It is not going
to happen, it has happened.
It is time all awoke to this fact, this situation
which marks the success "of an effort to remove
from American life a paralyzing sting in its con
science and the ugliest blot upon its good name
irf the world."
