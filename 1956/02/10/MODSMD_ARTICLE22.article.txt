'So-Called Problem'
Editor, The Daily:
Last year, while on the editorial staff of the
Birmingram (Alabama) News, I made a personal
study of the so-called segregation problem in the
South.
My principal conclusions resulting from the ob
servation of the problem were:
(1) Most responsible Negro leaders in the
South were not for integration of the races.
(2) That equal, and often better, educational
facilities were provided for the Negro students as
compared to those available to the Whites.
(3) That the social make-up of the South is

not comparable to that of the remainder of the
nation. Both responsible Whites and Negroes'
realize this, and prefer segregation.
The words segregation and inequality are not
synonymous in the South, notwithstanding what
extremist organizations such as the NAACP [Na
tional Association for the Advancement of Col
ored People) would have one believe.
A more extensive study into the real problems
of the South would behoove both the Supreme
Court Justices and persons such as he who wrote
Monday's Daily editorial, "Hope Is Dimming."
