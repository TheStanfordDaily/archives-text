The big news to hit the campus
during the past week was the ap
proval of a new General Studies
Program for the University.
Stanford's Academic Council
last Wednesday approved the two
year appraisal of the undergradu
ate study program by faculty and
student committees.
The Study of Undergraduate
Education (SUE) was supported
by grants from the Ford Founda
tion and the Carnegie Corpora
tion of New York.
Although the committee esti
mates that it will take three to
four years to put the total pro
gram into effect, freshmen enter
ing next autumn quarter will be
gin their schooling largely under
the new program.
Student Option
Old students have their choice
of whether to continue on the old
plan or to take up the new pro
gram.
The incoming freshmen will be
required to take a full year of
English, including both composi
tion and literature, under the new
program.
Added flexibility is permitted
by the new plan by allowing stu
dents to be exempt from general
courses in their major fields. This
means, for example, that the sci
ence major may use the units re
quired in the science field to fur
ther his studies in the two other
fields — social sciences and hu
manities.
New "terminal courses" design
ed to familiarize students with
subjects in the social science field
will be offered without prerequi
sites.
PE Substitution
Another feature of the new
General Studies Program is the
substitution of four of six units
of the physical education require
ment with work in such activities
as band, orchestra, chorus, dra
matic productions, and the like.
Students will be allowed to de
clare their major as freshmen
under the new plan, whereas now
they must wait until they are jun
iors. Upon becoming a junior, one
is required to have chosen his
field.
Along with the general pro
gram, the Academic Council
enacted new entrance require
ments for high* school students.
Increased prerequisites in Eng

lish, foreign language and mathe
matics, coupled with satisfactory
performance on College Board
subject-matter achievement tests,
are the new entrance require
ments.
High school students are re
quired to take three years of Eng
lish, two years of a foreign lan
guage and two of mathematics
under the new system.
This General Studies Program
replaces the Lower and Upper di
visions system, which had been a
part of the University curriculum
since it was instituted by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur in 1920.
"Reasonable Coverage"
Program Study Director Robert
Hoopes of the English Depart
ment said the aim is "to give rea
sonable coverage to the fields of
knowledge, but without dulling in
tellectual interest by a forced
lock-step and without limiting the
highly gifted."
First, it permits the student
greater freedom of variety in se
lecting his courses of study for a
bachelor's degree.
Secondly, it increases the range
of general education courses he
must complete, thus assuring him
of exposure to a wider field of
knowledge.
And, finally, it permits freedom
in changing advisers or fields of
study at any time. Under the old
method the student had one ad
viser for his Lower Division re-

Evaluation Is Given of Stanford's
I\e>vest General Studies' Program

quirements and another for the
Upper Division.
In short, the General Studies
Program will offer the student a
liberal education which will make
him a better citizen in a world
which is rapidly becoming one of
specialization.

year appraisal of the undergradu
ate study program by faculty and
student committees.
The Study of Undergraduate
Education (SUE) was supported
by grants from the Ford Founda
tion and the Carnegie Corpora
tion of New York.
Although the committee esti
mates that it will take three to
four years to put the total pro
gram into effect, freshmen enter
ing next autumn quarter will be
gin their schooling largely under
the new program.
Student Option
Old students have their choice
of whether to continue on the old
plan or to take up the new pro
gram.
The incoming freshmen will be
required to take a full year of
English, including both composi
tion and literature, under the new
program.
Added flexibility is permitted
by the new plan by allowing stu
dents to be exempt from general
courses in their major fields. This
means, for example, that the sci
ence major may use the units re
quired in the science field to fur
ther his studies in the two other
fields — social sciences and hu
manities.
New "terminal courses" design
ed to familiarize students with
subjects in the social science field
will be offered without prerequi
sites.
PE Substitution
Another feature of the new
General Studies Program is the
substitution of four of six units
of the physical education require
ment with work in such activities
as band, orchestra, chorus, dra
matic productions, and the like.
Students will be allowed to de
clare their major as freshmen
under the new plan, whereas now
they must wait until they are jun
iors. Upon becoming a junior, one
is required to have chosen his
field.
Along with the general pro
gram, the Academic Council
enacted new entrance require
ments for high* school students.
Increased prerequisites in Eng

lish, foreign language and mathe
matics, coupled with satisfactory
performance on College Board
subject-matter achievement tests,
are the new entrance require
ments.
High school students are re
quired to take three years of Eng
lish, two years of a foreign lan
guage and two of mathematics
under the new system.
This General Studies Program
replaces the Lower and Upper di
visions system, which had been a
part of the University curriculum
since it was instituted by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur in 1920.
"Reasonable Coverage"
Program Study Director Robert
Hoopes of the English Depart
ment said the aim is "to give rea
sonable coverage to the fields of
knowledge, but without dulling in
tellectual interest by a forced
lock-step and without limiting the
highly gifted."
First, it permits the student
greater freedom of variety in se
lecting his courses of study for a
bachelor's degree.
Secondly, it increases the range
of general education courses he
must complete, thus assuring him
of exposure to a wider field of
knowledge.
And, finally, it permits freedom
in changing advisers or fields of
study at any time. Under the old
method the student had one ad
viser for his Lower Division re-

I\e>vest General Studies' Program

quirements and another for the
Upper Division.
In short, the General Studies
Program will offer the student a
liberal education which will make
him a better citizen in a world
which is rapidly becoming one of
specialization.
