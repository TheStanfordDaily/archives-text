# Professor Hilton Receives Letter from Peron, Remarks on Madrid Student Demonstrations
## Ex-Argentine Dictator Calls Revolutionists 'Irresponsible' 
### Julie Olson 
"The Argentine government has fallen into ambitious, ignorant,
irresponsible hands," Juan Peron, former Argentine dictator, has
written in a letter to Ronald B. Hilton, professor of Romanic lan
guages.
Hilton says to his knowledge this letter is the first formal state-

ment Peron has made since he
went into exile in Colon, Panama.
Peron's letter was written in re
ply to a letter sent to him in Jan
uary by Hilton and Robert O'Neil,
who is author of the Argentine
section of the Hispanic American
Report.
Hilton, editor of the Report, and
his'staff plan to send more letters
of inquiry to prominent Latin
Americans.
"Uprising Will Fail"
Peron began his letter to Hilton
by explaining that since 1945
there has been a true social revo
lution in Argentina, it ended
with the military uprising on Sep
tember 16, 1955.
According to Peron, it was only
luck that the uprising succeeded.
The present dictatorship will, like
all the others, end in failure, loss
of prestige and popular repulsion.
Argentina is now being gov
erned by "unknown, ignorant, am
bitious men without the least
knowledge of public affairs." Pe-

Ron adds that they dominate by
force and have turned the country
into a concentration camp. This
was not because of his govern
ment, he says.
Peron's Book
In answer to questions about
his new book, "Force Is the Right
of Beasts," Peron wrote that it
deals with Argentina's problems.
It points out the curse of military
dictatorships.
Peron illustrates his point with
the events of the revolt of last
September.
"I have served as a general for
45 years and have run the coun
try for 10 years." Thus he feels
qualified to judge both the mili
tary and the state. He says that
the military obliges while states
men persuade and educate. Ac
cording to Peron, the military
doesn't have sufficient culture to
govern.
If Argentina won't publish the
book, he wants to publish it as
I close to Argentina as possible.
His aim, he says, is not money but
the circulation of his ideas among
the people to fight ignorance and
violence.
As for the location of Peron's
fortune, he wrote he isn't losing
sleep over it because he had no
more money than his houseboy.
Jose Francisco Suarez predicted
that Peron will not return to Ar
gentina. In answer to this, Peron
wrote Hilton that he was the
constitutional president of the
country, elected by 70 per cent of
the voters.
Sure of Returning
He is not only sure of returning
but says, "If things continue as
they are now, 1 will have to in
terrupt my vacation sooner than I
had planned."
The typed a poem in red at the
bottom of the letter. The poem,
"The Tyrant," is written by "the
voice of the people." Hilton pre
sumes this is Peron.
He closes by writing, "I may
be wrong but I have no evil in
dention. If I can be of more help
to you, let me know."
