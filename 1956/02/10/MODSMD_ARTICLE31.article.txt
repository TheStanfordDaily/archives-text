# Youth Poll Probably Sparked Spanish Political Crisis, Riots
## 
### Gerry Smith 
For the last few days the streets of Madrid have been filled with
rioting students.
These students are members of the Falange, the political group
supporting Generalissimo Francisco Franco. But, although all Span
ish students are required to join the Falange, many are extremely
-rebellious.

"It is hard to say exactly what's
going on where there is no free
dom of the press," Ronald B. Hil
ton, professor of Romanic lan
guages and expert on Spanish and
Latin American affairs, said yes
terday.
Divided Spain
"But despite censorship, Spain
is si ill divided into conservatives
and liberals," he continued.
Shades of opinion range from ab
solutists at the extreme right to
an undetermined number of Com
munists at the extreme left.
"Spanish and Latin American
students take an active and vio
lent part in politics," he noted.
"While they sometimes behave ir
responsibly, they often give a hint
of what is to come.
"I was in Madrid in 1931 when
the monarchy fell and the revo
lution began precisely with stu
dent unrest," Hilton said. "In
Cuba today the students are the
most active group fighting Ba
tista, another dictator.
Peculiar Situation
"The situation in Spain is pe
culiar because all students are re
quired to enter, the Falange, an
organization based on ideas simi
lar' to those held by Mussolini.
"However, the Falange itself is
very much divided on the issue of
Franco's succession." He com
pares intensity of interest in the
question with our interest in Ei
senhower's decision on a second
term only "infinitely more acute
because it is a coumtry where
there is no established pattern for
one regime to succeed another."
He thinks the spark which set
off the riots was probably a poll
of student opinion recently taken
by the government. It revealed a
majority of the students are criti
cal of the three most powerfu 1
Spanish institutions: the govern
ment, the army and the church.
Government Shocked
"Their criticism of these insti
tutions shocked tlie Spanish gov
ernment by its sharpness," Hilton
commented. "The government
tried to deny that the poll had
ever taken place.
"However, it seems certain that
it was taken, in order to give the
government information it need
ed in swaying the opinion of the
younger generation. When the
results turned out to be so devas
tating, they were suppressed.
"Apparently, no mention of this
poll was allowed to appear in any
of the Spanish press, but in Spain
the grapevine has traditionally
been as important as the news
paper."
Outcome Unknown
Hilton thinks it is impossible to
say what the outcome of the riots
may be. "Franco is an astute
ruler and his machine is well or
ganized.
Spain has had no real elections
since the civil war in 1931. "There
have been no means by which the
Spanish electorate can blow off
steam. And the Spanish feel a
very healthy need to blow off
steam."
"Should Franco fall, it is hard
to see what form of government
would succeed him," Hilton add
ed. "Democratic practices require
long experience and substantial
civic education. -
"The English-speaking peoples
have had many, many centuries
of such experience behind them.
The youth of Spain have not re
ceived this training."

organization based on ideas simi
lar' to those held by Mussolini.
"However, the Falange itself is
very much divided on the issue of
Franco's succession." He com
pares intensity of interest in the
question with our interest in Ei
senhower's decision on a second
term only "infinitely more acute
because it is a coumtry where
there is no established pattern for
one regime to succeed another."
He thinks the spark which set
off the riots was probably a poll
of student opinion recently taken
by the government. It revealed a
majority of the students are criti
cal of the three most powerfu 1
Spanish institutions: the govern
ment, the army and the church.
Government Shocked
"Their criticism of these insti
tutions shocked tlie Spanish gov
ernment by its sharpness," Hilton
commented. "The government
tried to deny that the poll had
ever taken place.
"However, it seems certain that
it was taken, in order to give the
government information it need
ed in swaying the opinion of the
younger generation. When the
results turned out to be so devas
tating, they were suppressed.
"Apparently, no mention of this
poll was allowed to appear in any
of the Spanish press, but in Spain
the grapevine has traditionally
been as important as the news
paper."
Outcome Unknown
Hilton thinks it is impossible to
say what the outcome of the riots
may be. "Franco is an astute
ruler and his machine is well or
ganized.
Spain has had no real elections
since the civil war in 1931. "There
have been no means by which the
Spanish electorate can blow off
steam. And the Spanish feel a
very healthy need to blow off
steam."
"Should Franco fall, it is hard
to see what form of government
would succeed him," Hilton add
ed. "Democratic practices require
long experience and substantial
civic education. -
"The English-speaking peoples
have had many, many centuries
of such experience behind them.
The youth of Spain have not re
ceived this training."
For the last few days the streets of Madrid have been filled with
rioting students.
These students are members of the Falange, the political group
supporting Generalissimo Francisco Franco. But, although all Span
ish students are required to join the Falange, many are extremely
-rebellious.

"It is hard to say exactly what's
going on where there is no free
dom of the press," Ronald B. Hil
ton, professor of Romanic lan
guages and expert on Spanish and
Latin American affairs, said yes
terday.
Divided Spain
"But despite censorship, Spain
is si ill divided into conservatives
and liberals," he continued.
Shades of opinion range from ab
solutists at the extreme right to
an undetermined number of Com
munists at the extreme left.
"Spanish and Latin American
students take an active and vio
lent part in politics," he noted.
"While they sometimes behave ir
responsibly, they often give a hint
of what is to come.
"I was in Madrid in 1931 when
the monarchy fell and the revo
lution began precisely with stu
dent unrest," Hilton said. "In
Cuba today the students are the
most active group fighting Ba
tista, another dictator.
