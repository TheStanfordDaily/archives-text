## Duane Davis Shows 'Great Promise,' Says Atlantic Monthly 
### 
Stanford may have acquired a
future poet laureate in Duane Da
vis, a Wilbur freshman, who has
already had many poems pub
lished, one of which will be used
as a preface to a book soon to be
published by Liberaee.
Davis comes from Seattle,
Washington. He began writing
poetry while a freshman in high
school. He has written over 400
poems which he submits to news
papers and magazines.
According to Atlantic Monthly
editors, Davis shows "great prom
ise." He has been mentioned as
a future poet laureate of Wash
ington, and bad poems accepted
for the"Washington State Poetry
Anthology" and"The American
Bard."
Met Liberaee
Davis was introduced to Libe
raee when the latter visited Wash
ington. He dedicated a poem en
titled "Man with a Piano and a
Dream" to the musician which Li
beraee plans to use as foreword
to a forthcoming music book.
Davis' poetry has appeared
through many media. Western
newspapers including the San
Francisco and Los Angeles Exam
iners, the Denver Post, and the
Portland Oregonian have used his
work.
His poems have been broadcast
on radio and TV including pro
grams devoted entirely to his
works. He has appeared on
KABC-TV in Los Angeles and has
also been seen on several Wash
ington networks.
Published Abroad
Davis has also had poems pub
lished in "Wings" magazine and
abroad in Brussels and London.
His first poetry volume will be
published soon by the McCaffrey
Publishing Company of Washing
ton.
Davis says he will probably
major in English but will not
make poetry his career. He would
rather enter some other literary
field.
"I would like to improve my
writing and continue with it, but
I realize I can't make a living as
a poet," he said.
Davis specializes in familiar
subjects fur his poems, on such
topics as cats, flowers and
churches. Most of his poems have
a philosophic bent. Below is an
example of his poetry, "Lazy
Batchin'
Poem Sample
I have more work to do this
day . . .
I cannot pause, I must not
play
1 must not linger on a thought
There's more to do than I can
say.
The fields need plowin'
Roof needs mendin'
The gate needs latch in'
But lucky me— I will not do
it—
How I love this lazy batchin'.
At the California Chaparral
Poets' convention held this past
summer, Davis was presented
with the Lu Vailean Award of
Honor for meritorious service in
behalf of poets and poetry.
Davis is a member of many
literary organizations including
American Poetry League, Com
posers, Authors and Artists of
America and Poets of the Pacific.
