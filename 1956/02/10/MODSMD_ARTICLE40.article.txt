# Stanford Play, 'October 32,' Proves Amusing But Contrived
## Virginia Stone's Romantic Drama Presented In Wednesday Matinee Program Series 
### Richard Mende 
Some of the pleasantest theatrical moments on the Peninsula have
been provided in the intimate atmosphere of Stanford's Wednesday
matinee program.
This week an original one-act play, "October 32" by Virginia Stone,
was produced.
Much of the charm of the performance must be credited to the

| talented and competent director, -
! George Irving, who was able to [
keep things moving when the!
script itself became a little heavy.
And Charles Lyons, as Mr. Win- j
gate, an imaginary creature with
| supernatural powers, was alter
i nately crotchety, waggish, weary
|and sympathetic in a way that
bodes well for Mr. Lyons' career.
Poor Little Rich Girl
October 32 is the day on which j
I a working girl (Tina Cowley), en
gaged to a handsome millionaire, |
is given the chance to experience
, her most earn e s t but secret
! dream.
Among the things the heroine
wished for were to flirt with a
poor, average-looking but roman
tic fellow (Bob McFarlan), who j
; walks by her in the park noon-
I times, to take her shoes off, eat
j hamburgers and climb a tree
without fear of social derision.
Most important of her wishes
was to live with her man in a little
white cottage at the end of a long,
winding road, away from the de-
I velopment sites, so the two can
| work for something in which they
! believe.
"Our Dreamless Society"
The opening section of the play
especially reveals that Miss Stone
has a degage wit; some of her
observations on our unromantic,
dreamless society are very amus
ing.
But the weightier problems dis
cussed throughout much of the
play, about love and true love,
were resolved in some time-hon
ored advice such as "You can't
marry for security and find hap
piness," or "Every human being
needs someone who loves him,"
and a curtain line: "If strangers
could find some way to talk to
one another, there would be a lot
less lonely people in the world."


LIBERACE AND DLANE DAVIS, Wilbur freshman, look at a
book of poetry in which Davis has a poem. Davis has had over 400
pieces published in newspapers and magazines. One of his poems
will be used as a preface to a book which Liberace will publish
in the near future. The title of the poem which Davis dedicated to
the pianist is "Man with a Piano and a Dream."
