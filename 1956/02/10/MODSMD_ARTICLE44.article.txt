# ACTOR'S WORKSHOP PLAY
## Brecht's 'Mother Courage' 'A Magnificent Performance' 
### Stew Toy 
Marxist philosophers and pessimist economists have long main
tained that capitalist society cannot survive without war.
At first glance, Bertolt Brecht's epic play, "Mother Courage," now
| in its American premiere presentation at San Francisco's Marines
I Memorial Theater, seems to uphold this theory.
Mother Courage, a Swedish canteen owner, drags a battered cart
after the Swedish army in the —

monumental and holy Thirty
Years War of the 17th century, |
selling belts and schnapps to sol-!
diers and philosophizing on war. j
Grim Philosophy
Her philosophy, based on eco- [
nomic necessity, is a grim but ter- i
ribly accurate one: "Where there j
are virtues it is a sure sign some- j
thing is wrong."
The play's whole epic sequence j
is concerned with war - a war I
which comes to be not the usual!
tragic struggle for peace but the I
perfectly natural and never-end- |
ing pursuit of mankind.
"The war will never end," the
depraved chaplain tells Mother;
Courage. It simply breaks out in
little islands of peace now and |
then; but the ordered life of the j
battlefield always triumphs.
Condones War
German playwright Breeht,
writing just before the outbreak
of World War 11, seems often to
be almost condoning war. As a
true humanist, he must recognize
the fact that the arts of humanity
are actually thriving at t heir
highest point during time of war.
Philosophy is alive with its new
sense of meaning and duty.
But it is hard for those brought
up in the modern tradition of
peace and virtue to agree with or
even to trust in this estimate of
what Brecht is saying.
Effective Picture
Actually, Brecht is probably
"saying" little of anything; he
merely presents an effective and
certainly accurate picture of war
and its effects on humanity.
As such, "Mother Courage" is
something for humanists to think
about.
The play's production by the
Actor's Workshop, probably one
of the finest little-theatres grown
big in the country, is a flawlessly
magnificent one.
Beatrice Manley plays Mother
Courage with supreme gusto and
depravity. Miss Manley's perform
ance is .undoubtedly one of the
finest we have seen anywhere.
"Rewarding Experience"
Robert Symonds does a com
mendable job as the chaplain—an
inscrutibly muddled, yet succinct,
character reminiscent of some of
Shakespeare's delightful fops.
Paul Dessau's music for the
play adds a tone of splendor to its
grim poignancy.
With its epic drama, its music,
its philosophy, "Mother Courage"
gave us one of the most entertain
ing and rewarding theatrical ex
periences we have had in a long
time.

be almost condoning war. As a
true humanist, he must recognize
the fact that the arts of humanity
are actually thriving at t heir
highest point during time of war.
Philosophy is alive with its new
sense of meaning and duty.
But it is hard for those brought
up in the modern tradition of
peace and virtue to agree with or
even to trust in this estimate of
what Brecht is saying.
Effective Picture
Actually, Brecht is probably
"saying" little of anything; he
merely presents an effective and
certainly accurate picture of war
and its effects on humanity.
As such, "Mother Courage" is
something for humanists to think
about.
The play's production by the
Actor's Workshop, probably one
of the finest little-theatres grown
big in the country, is a flawlessly
magnificent one.
Beatrice Manley plays Mother
Courage with supreme gusto and
depravity. Miss Manley's perform
ance is .undoubtedly one of the
finest we have seen anywhere.
"Rewarding Experience"
Robert Symonds does a com
mendable job as the chaplain—an
inscrutibly muddled, yet succinct,
character reminiscent of some of
Shakespeare's delightful fops.
Paul Dessau's music for the
play adds a tone of splendor to its
grim poignancy.
With its epic drama, its music,
its philosophy, "Mother Courage"
gave us one of the most entertain
ing and rewarding theatrical ex
periences we have had in a long
time.
Marxist philosophers and pessimist economists have long main
tained that capitalist society cannot survive without war.
At first glance, Bertolt Brecht's epic play, "Mother Courage," now
| in its American premiere presentation at San Francisco's Marines
I Memorial Theater, seems to uphold this theory.
Mother Courage, a Swedish canteen owner, drags a battered cart
after the Swedish army in the —

monumental and holy Thirty
Years War of the 17th century, |
selling belts and schnapps to sol-!
diers and philosophizing on war. j
Grim Philosophy
Her philosophy, based on eco- [
nomic necessity, is a grim but ter- i
ribly accurate one: "Where there j
are virtues it is a sure sign some- j
thing is wrong."
The play's whole epic sequence j
is concerned with war - a war I
which comes to be not the usual!
tragic struggle for peace but the I
perfectly natural and never-end- |
ing pursuit of mankind.
"The war will never end," the
depraved chaplain tells Mother;
Courage. It simply breaks out in
little islands of peace now and |
then; but the ordered life of the j
battlefield always triumphs.
Condones War
German playwright Breeht,
writing just before the outbreak
of World War 11, seems often to
be almost condoning war. As a
true humanist, he must recognize
the fact that the arts of humanity
are actually thriving at t heir
highest point during time of war.
