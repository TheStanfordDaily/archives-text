# Military Ball Set For March 10
## 
### 
March 10 has been set aside for
the annual military ball, accord
ing to an announcement from the
joint Reserve Officers Training
Corps offices.
The dance, which will feature
Ray Mackett's orchestra, will be
held in San Francisco's Palace
Hotel.
A queen, representing the three
services, will be selected from
among the dates at the dance.
This practice deviates from tradi
tion slightly, since, in the past, a
queen was elected for each
branch.
