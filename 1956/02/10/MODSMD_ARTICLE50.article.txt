# Cassill Quits Washington
## Director of Athletics Yields to Pressure 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 9 (UP)
— Harvey Cassill, athletic director
at the University of Washington,
resigned to day under pressure
brought by alumni and football
fans angered over his handling of
a controversy during which foot
ball coach John Cherberg was
fired.
Announcing his resignation in
a letter to H. P. (Dick) Everest,
university vice president, Cassill
said he did so for the same rea
sons he fired Cherberg Jan. 27.
"If it was right for me to sepa
rate John Cherberg from his
coaching responsibilities and it
was—then I must now myself re
sign as athletic director," Cassill
said.
Under Fire
He had been under fire since he
ousted Cherberg as the result of
a player revolt that carne at the
end of last football season when
35 of his players, many of them
varsity, asked Cassill to request
Cherberg to resign. The players
said Cowboy Johnny used "tyran
nical coaching methods."
About his decision, Cassill said:
"Whether it was John's fault or
not, the facts clearly a.nd conclu
sively indicated that the situation
was beyond recovery, so far as
his problem was concerned.
"I had to make one of two
choices: 1 could have permitted
John to go through the 1956 sea
son—with all the pain, turmoil
and disappointments I knew that
entailed and then separated him
from his position because of a
most unsatisfactory season; or I
could terminate the situation and
hope that a new cotch would
bring harmony, teamwork and
morale back into Die picture. I
chose the latter."
Petitions Circulated
Cherberg, since his removal,
has demanded Cassill be fired.
Hundreds of fan sand alumni
throughout the state signed peti
tions asking that the athletic di
rector be ousted.
"I find myself in as untenable
a position as 1 found John Cher
berg to be in. The 'what-to-do'
about it involves the same two
possibilities—either rough it out
. . . or resign now . . ." Cassill's
letter said.
Dr. Henry Schmitz, president of
the university, issued the follow
ing statement:
"I am accepting Mr. Cassill's
resignation as director of athlet
ics in the full realization that, in
taking this step, he does so out of
a deep sense of loyalty to the wel
fare of the University of Wash
ington. He has been a devoted
servant of that interest and has
made many fine contributions to
the welfare of the athletic pro
gram.
Cassill and Everest conferred
this afternoon just prior to the
announcement of the athletic di
rector's resignation. Their meet
ing followed an "informal" four
hour meeting last night and early
today of the university's board of
regents, President Schmitz and
Everest.
Cassill was given authority by
the regents at a meeting Jan. 10
to fire Cherberg if, in his opinion,
Cherberg failed to end the contro
versy with his players. As soon as
the coach was fired, alumni
friends of Cherberg and fans
throughout the state began circu
lating petitions demanding that
Cassill be removed.
The regents discussed Cassill's
status and the disclosure of an
off-campus "slush fund" for re
cruiting athletes.

SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 9 (UP)
— Harvey Cassill, athletic director
at the University of Washington,
resigned to day under pressure
brought by alumni and football
fans angered over his handling of
a controversy during which foot
ball coach John Cherberg was
fired.
Announcing his resignation in
a letter to H. P. (Dick) Everest,
university vice president, Cassill
said he did so for the same rea
sons he fired Cherberg Jan. 27.
"If it was right for me to sepa
rate John Cherberg from his
coaching responsibilities and it
was—then I must now myself re
sign as athletic director," Cassill
said.
Under Fire
He had been under fire since he
ousted Cherberg as the result of
a player revolt that carne at the
end of last football season when
35 of his players, many of them
varsity, asked Cassill to request
Cherberg to resign. The players
said Cowboy Johnny used "tyran
nical coaching methods."
About his decision, Cassill said:
"Whether it was John's fault or
not, the facts clearly a.nd conclu
sively indicated that the situation
was beyond recovery, so far as
his problem was concerned.
"I had to make one of two
choices: 1 could have permitted
John to go through the 1956 sea
son—with all the pain, turmoil
and disappointments I knew that
entailed and then separated him
from his position because of a
most unsatisfactory season; or I
could terminate the situation and
hope that a new cotch would
bring harmony, teamwork and
morale back into Die picture. I
chose the latter."
