# ALABAMA UNIVERSITY
## Race Riots Disappointing Say Foreign Students 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
What do the foreign students here at Stanford think about there- j
cent trouble at Alabama University? Most of them were amazed and ,
some expressed disappointment.
Afaf Loutfi el Sayed, from Egypt, said, "I was quite shocked be- i
cause I didn't think educated people, especially students, could have i

such stupid attitudes. I regard it
as one of the most un-Christian,
undemocratic and unfeeling
things I've ever seen."
Roslyn Grant, of Honduras,
said, "In my country, a person is
judged by wl\at he is, not by his
race, color or creed. In the light
of what has happened in Ala
bama, 1 can only conclude that,
in this respect, my country is
ahead of yours."
Two students from Japan, Yu
riko Nakagawa and Tsune/.o Sa
sai, were disappointed. "When
we in Japan heard of the Supreme
Court ruling [against segrega
tion! we regarded it as one of the
greatest stops ever taken by any
country in human relations. We
were very disappointed to hear of
the Alabama incident. It will
greatly hurt American prestige
abroad."
All the students queried won
dered if the American people real
ized that their enemies overseas
would use the incident as great
source of propaganda. Iqbal Bur
ney, from India, noted, "The ene- j
mies of this country will exploit
this situation to the fullest ox
tent. It will do incalculable dam
age to this country's reputation."
In India, Kgypt, Central Amer
ica awl Japan, there is little racial
trouble. Students from abroad
were emphatic in pointing out i
that in their countries, differ- i
enccs arose over political issues, -
rather than racial ones.

their stand.
