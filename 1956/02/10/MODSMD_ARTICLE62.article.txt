# Rugby Team Faces COP Tomorrow
## 
### 
A COP rugby squad composed ,
primarily of veterans is expected
to give the Card ruggers a rather
strained welcome when the two,
teams meet in Stockton tomor-'
row afternoon.
COP will field Ken Swearington
and Don Cornell, halfbacks, and
a pair of tackles, John Nisby and
Don Meeks, from last fall's grid
picture, to. be supported by plenty j
of returnees from last year's rug- j
by club.
COP is traditionally regarded j
as a strong contender in Pacific
Coast rugby, anil Stanford coach j
Pete Kmetovic feels the team they
have this year will be no excep
tion.
Stanford, though without the
services of Mickey Raflery, Bob
Spare, Doug Dick and Dave
Shultz, is expected to show
strongly. Coming out of last
week's encounters with a win and
a_ tie, the Indians managed to
show quite a bit of potential, with
Dick and Scott Jones, Bob Spare
and Paul Wiggin leading the way.
Kmetovic expressed concern
over the ball handling and the
penalty kicking, which must im
prove if further success is to
follow. In the latter department
Dorsey Atkinson has been doing
well in practice, and coach Kme
tovic seems optimistic over his
team's possibilities.
The Indians will start Carswell,
Long and Robinson in the front
rank, with Wiggin and Howell in
the second. Dick Jones will be at
lock, Vince Jones at scrum half,
Macken and Rice at t<he break
aways, Scott Jones and Doyle at
the fives, Young at center three
fourths, Taylor and Atkinson at
the wings and Kirkland at full.
