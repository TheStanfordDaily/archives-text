# Law School's Moot Court Leads to National Contest
## Mock Trials Are Appeals of Imaginary Cases, But Hearings Involve Recent and Real Issues 
### 
Moot court is the Law School's "tournament of champions." The
first round of this year's moot court began at Stanford Wednesday
night.
Winners of each night will be judged in an elimination to pick 12
winners of the first round. The winners will be announced next Wed-

-nesday with the results of the
entire first round.
This first round of court ses
sions is on the intraschool level.
The 12 winners progress up the
ladder to interschool competition
and semifinals held in the spring.
Cash Prizes
Four winners of Stanford semi
finals compete in autumn finals
for the Marion Kirkwood Award
given by Stanford Law School.
Top man receives $100; second
place, $50; third and fourth plac
es, each $25. The four compete in
national finals held also in the
autumn.
A moot court hearing is not a
mock, or fake, trial. It is the hear
ing of an appeal of a hypothetical
trial. Cases involved in these pro
ceedings are imaginary, but are
based upon factual material taken
from recent real cases.
They involve real issues as, for
example, those cases' heard this
week. In Rock v. Secretary of
State, Rock is refused a passport
because he has been called a Com
munist by one of the FBl's confi
dential witnesses. Does Rock have
the right to face the witness in
this case?
Evidence
State of Stanford v. Michaels
treats the problem of whether or
not evidence taken against the
will of the accused can lawfully
be used against him. Lasting Shoe
Co. v. Tip Toe Shoe Co. is con
cerned with anti-trust legislation.
The legality of intermarriage in
a state is the problem dealt with
in Davis v. State of Stanford.
How much in dues can a union
ask of a member? This is the
theme of Lynd v. NLRB.
The students, as attorneys ar
guing the cases, cite real cases in
their briefs and presentations. All
the second-year law students who
did not qualify in their first year
for the Stanford Law Review
mus't compete in Moot Court.
Those on the Review do not com
pete.
The public is invited to attend
the last moot court sessions to

mock, or fake, trial. It is the hear
ing of an appeal of a hypothetical
trial. Cases involved in these pro
ceedings are imaginary, but are
based upon factual material taken
from recent real cases.
They involve real issues as, for
example, those cases' heard this
week. In Rock v. Secretary of
State, Rock is refused a passport
because he has been called a Com
munist by one of the FBl's confi
dential witnesses. Does Rock have
the right to face the witness in
this case?
Evidence
State of Stanford v. Michaels
treats the problem of whether or
not evidence taken against the
will of the accused can lawfully

Co. v. Tip Toe Shoe Co. is con
cerned with anti-trust legislation.
The legality of intermarriage in
a state is the problem dealt with
in Davis v. State of Stanford.
How much in dues can a union
ask of a member? This is the
theme of Lynd v. NLRB.
