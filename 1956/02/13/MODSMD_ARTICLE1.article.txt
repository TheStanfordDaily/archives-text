SPRINGI* I ELD, 111.. Feb. 12 (U.R)â€”Roy Wilkins, executive secretary
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
tofl ay criticized Adlai E. Stevenson for his recent statement urging
gradual integration in the South.
I he other d;iy in Los Angeles the distinguished former Governor'

of this state, Mr. Adlai Stevenson,
told an audience of Negro citizens
to accommodate themselves to
gradual enjoyment of their citi
zenship rights," Wilkins said.
"No one cheered this sentiment
except those whose basic rights
have not been restricted or de
nied," he added. "The Negro him
self is American enough to resent
and reject the suggestion that
any American should refuse to
claim those rights which have
been declared to be his under the
Constitution."
Wilkins made his remarks in a
brief speech at Lincoln's tomb,
where he placed a wreath in ob
servance of the Great Emancipa
tor's 147 th birthday.
Stevenson Speaks
His statement came as Steven
son. speaking in Portland, Ore.,
said he considered it essential
that the school desegregation is
sue in the South be kept out of
the current political campaign.
In a statement reasserting his
views on civil rights, the candi
date for the Democratic presiden
tial nomination said there should
be no slowing down of efforts to
bring about desegregation in the
schools, "but we must recognize
that it is reason alone that will
determine our rate of continued
progress."
"Certainly we will not improve
the present condition or future
prospects of any Negro citizen by
coercive Federal action that will
.arm the extremists and disarm
the men of good will in the South
who, with courage and patience,
have already accomplished so
much," Stevenson said.
Ilarrinian Disagrees
In New York. Governor Averell
Harriman also took issue today
with Stevenson's stand.
Harriman came out for cutting
off Federal funds to all public
schools that refuse to desegregate
the races. He also proposed im
mediate Federal enforcement of
the Supreme Court's desegrega
tion ruling.
Stevenson has stated his oppo
sition to halting Federal aid to
segregated schools.
Harriman, under questioning
on the CBS radio show, "Let's
Find Out," criticized the Eisen
hower Administration for. not act
ing to enforce the Supreme Court
school desegregation ruling in the
University of Alabama contro
versy.
He called for Federal prosecu
tion of those who have "violated
the law" by keeping Autherine
Lucy from classes at the school.
Sen. Estes Kefauvcr (D-Tenn.),
an announced candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomina
tion, declined yesterday to say
outright how he stood on Ihe pro
posed ban on aid to segregated
schools.
