# NSA Asks For Readmission Of Autherine Lucy
## Ala. Students Praised For Anti-Mob Stand 
### 
Headquarters of the National
Student Association has com
mended the University of Ala
bama student legislature for its
stand in opposition to mob vio
lence and urged the student gov
erning body to take a stand in j
support of reinstating Autherine
Lucy. .
Stanford Glass. "NSA national j
president, forwarded a statement
of commendation and advice to
the student body president at Tus
caloosa in response to a move
made last Tuesday by the student
council to condemn mob violence
and urge that "means be taken to
protect the future personal safety
of the students and faculty and
the reputation of the university."
A similar motion had been ta
bled by the university's faculty
council.
The legislature had risen to pro
test the three days of mob vio
lence on the Alabama campus
which led to the ouster of Miss
Lucy, the university's first Negi'o
student.
Air of Tension
Alabama student body presi-1
dent Walter Flowers sent a state- j
ment last weekend to NSA head- J
quarters observing that "an air of j
tension and expectancy still pre
vails on the campus."
"The return of the Negro stu
dent seems inevitableâ€”the situa
tion that it presents will be met
in the best manner possible by all
responsible student organizations.
"In the meantime an appeal has
gone out to the students from the
faculty in their classrooms, from
the Student Government Associa
tion and from the administration
of the university to think and act
maturely in any situation that
may arise.
"The solution," Flowers stated,
"we feel lies in mass education of
the Southern people to the terrific
problem of segregation.
Want Patience
"We ask for patience, we ask
for understanding and we ask for
a correct interpretation of this,
unique situation. It is a case of
democracy versus mob rule, and
the students want democracy."
Glass, in his letter to Alabama
student leaders, wrote that NSA
is "unalterably opposed to all
forms of discrimination in educa
tion which are based on race, re
ligion or national origin.
"We regret that even a few
American students have given
their support and participation to
! expression of mob violence and
prejudice.
Students Against
"And yet, let us all be encour
aged that Ihe student leaders at
! the University of Alabama are
not identified with such action,
but rather have taken firm stands
against these developments."
Although the University of Ala
bama Is not an NSA member, its
dean of women and several stu
dent leaders, including Flowers,
attended NSA's national conven
tion last summer.
At that meeting, NSA's stand
[ against segregation was endorsed
by an overwhelming majority of
; the 280 colleges and universities
I in the association.
