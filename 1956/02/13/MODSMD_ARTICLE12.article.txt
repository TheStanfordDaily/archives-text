# New Crocker-Anglo Bank Opens Today
## 
### 
The names of two of the "Big
Four" who played a historic part
in building the West will be re
associated here today with the
opening of the Crocker-Anglo Na
tional Bank in the Stanford Shop
ping Center.
The bank can trace its history
as far back as 1850 but the name
Croc k e r dates to 1883 when
Charles Crocker established the
banking firm of Crocker, Wool
worth & Co.
It was Charles Crocker who,
with Leland Stanford, Collis P.
Huntington and Mark Hopkins,
built the Central Pacific Railroad
linking the East to the West.
The new branch in the shop
ping center joins the Palo Alto
branch in serving depositors of
the Stanford area. It brings the
total <Â»112 Crocker-Anglo branches
to 51 banks in 32 communities.
