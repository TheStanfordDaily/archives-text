# UCLA Five and Naulls Leave with Two Wins
## Willie's 61 Points Save Teammates From Card Rallies 
### Rob Mierow Sports Editor 
UCLA's basketball team left
Palo Alto yesterday, wiping the
sweat from their brows, breath
ing a sigh of relief and giving
thanks that Willie Naulls is on
their team.
The Bruins barely escaped with
their undefeated Pacilc Coast
Conference record as Stanford's
scrappy Indians made a pair of
tremendous second • half rallies
Friday and Saturday before los
ing to the bigger Uclan.
Naulls was the difference. The
6-5, 220-pound pivot man tallied
24 points Friday night for a 5048
victory and 37 in the 81 72 over
time win Saturday.
WilTie's Effort
Willie the Whale's effort in the
curtain-raiser was a necessity as
the Cards combined to hold "Mar
velous JVTorrie" Taft to only six
points. Gary Van Galder,* Hap
Wagner and George Selleck all
gave Taft a working over, making
him look like an inexperienced
high schooler rather than a sure
fire All-PCC candidate.
Taft found the range Saturday,
netting 25 markers on six field
goals and 13 charity tosses. The
rangy guard foiled the half-court;
press which Stanford used
through practically the whole se
time after time.
Herring Scores
Forward A 1 Herring was the
only other Uclan scorer to hit
double digits in the series. Her
ring racked up 11 important
points when Taft was off Friday
and added six free throws in the
Saturday contest.
George Selleck, Stanford.' s
mighty mite, was all over the
court in both contests, often in a
prone position. The 5-8 Cat/1 cap
tain played one of the most tie
mendous series of his career but
he simply didn't have enough sup
port to turn the tide.
Selleck Hits
Little George popped in IS
points in the opener and flipped
24 more through the hoop Satur
day including the shot that tied
the game with 15 seconds remain
ing in regulation play.
Bill Bond and Barry Brown
helped all they could. Bond
tickled the nets for 26 points din
ing the series Broun hit
for 22.
In spite of a hustling defense
and the sharp-shooting of the Big
Three, one lone ingredient proved


SPRING-LEGGED BARRY BROWN goes high off the Pavilion
floor in an attempt to pry the fingers of UCLA's Conrad Burke
away from a rebound. The big (6-5, 200-pound) Los Angeles sopho
more thwarted Brown's efforts, though, as he helped his teammates
to a twin win over the trying but tiring Indians. —Daily photo by
