# Open Los Arboles
## 
### 
Eacli week Legislature hears, discusses an<l
occasionally approves the resolutions submit
ted by Hob Maddock and the traffic committee.
These resolutions, •which will he submitted
to the University, have covered most of the as
pects of the growing campus traffic dilemma.
However, one that has not been fully empha
sized yet is the question of Los Arboles
Road.
l os Arboles—the road connecting Santa Te
resa Street with Junipero Serra Boulevard—
was closed before autumn quarter on the
grounds that through traffic from Menlo Park
and other areas north of campus was hazardous
to Lagunita residents.
The road was closed although another road
between the Shopping ('enter and Foothill
Drive was being built to relieve the campus of
the burden of "non-campus" traffic.

As the situation now stands, all traffic going
north from campus or approaching campus
from the north, is channeled along the Row
and Mayfield, past the Phi Sigma Kappa fra
ternity.
The result is increased traffic along the Row
with less road space to handle it; continual con
gestion in front of the Post Office; a dangerous
triangular intersection without stop signs where
Mayfield runs into Junipero Serra, and in
creased inconvenience for north-bound traffic.
We think Los Arboles should be reopened to
through traffic. If the situation again proves
dangerous for Lagynita residents, perhaps a
"stop for pedestrians" sign and crosswalks
could be added, or even a "full stop" sign.
In any event, Los Arboles should be opened.
It is senseless to blopk off" exits from a campus
already hound by snarled traffic.
