# Tryouts For Pre-Reg Com To End Today
## Value of Committee To Frosh Stressed 
### 
Pre - Registration Committee,
welcoming group for incoming
freshmen during Pro-Reg Week
in the fall, will hold final inter
views this afternoon from 1:30 to
5 in the Legislature Room, Stu
dent Union.
Thirty-five positions are to be
filled, according to Chairman Bry
ant Boatwright, who describes the
turn-out of interested persons last
week as "disappointing."
Stressing the importance of his
committee in initiating freshmen
to Stanford life, Boatwright said
the committee "would especially
welcome m or e upper - classmen
and more men and wants people
from all classes."
Every member of Pre-Reg Com
mittee is made chairman or co
chairman of some Pre-Reg Week
event, which he is allowed to plan
and supervise himself with advice
and help from the rest of the
committee.
Events planned by the commit
tee include Freshman Convoca
tion. President's Tea, faculty open
houses and teas, exchanges, pic
nics, campus tours and jolly-ups.
"it's a work com," says Boat
wright, "but it's one that's fun.
We want people on Pre-Reg who
would like to meet other people
and make them feel at home.
"We try to give the freshmen a
picture of what Stanford is like,
academically and socially, and
make them feel part of the Stan
ford family."
