### Ric Teague 
\\ e may be a day early but: You too can be
our Valentine. Don't miss this opportunity.
We have a *veek chock full of goodies which
should sustain the extra-curricular appetite for
t lie coming seven days.
* *
Tonight is culture night at Mem And. Ru
dolf Serkiu, eminent pianist and recording
slar, will, bring bin talented fingers to the Farm
under the auspices of the Concert Series people.
if * * ,
TomcrA>w evening another artist will be at
Mem And, this time delighting the Tuesday
Evening Series audience. For free. Ansel
Adams, San Francisco photographer, will give
an illustrated lecture on ".New Concepts in
Photography."

The week maintains its high cultural tone on
Wednesday. At 4:15 p.m. the Department of
Speech and Drama will present Dr. Margery
Bailey in a talk on "The Criminal Actor." Dr.
Bailey will speak in the Little Theater of Me
morial Hall. Worth dropping in. . . .
# * *
Incidentally (and this is incidental if any
thing i«). a lecture by Professor Frederick W.
Locke presented by the Stanford Philological
Association will NOT be presented Wednesday
as Volume CXXXIV, Number, of the Univer
sity Calendar would have you believe. Dr.
Locke will tell an eager audience about "Le
Grand Meaulnes: The Desire and the Pursuit
of the W hole" on Thursday at 4:15.
# * «
I he intellectually rewarding atmosphere of

the week will come crashing down like a house
of cards Wednesday. Chaparral, ranking fourth
among student publications (right behind the
quarterly social calendar), will be making its
monthly bid for everyone's 30 cents.
# # *
A second destructive influence will be the
regular Wednesday night meeting of the Legis
lature. Actually, LASSU is to be commended
for at least trying to represent an apathetic
student constituency (how long since you sat
in on a LASSU meeting?), but they struggle so
hard with trivia.
* «
Thursday afternoon the Intermezzo people
offer a film, "Diary of a Country Priest,"" for
free consumption.
* « *
Another fine film will be shown by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises at the Thursday

be sold at the door.

Sunday will be another BIG CULTURE day
at Mem And. The Vienna Choir Hoys' benefit
concert at 2:30 p.m.—a rare opportunity to
hear a wonderful group. Prices are relatively
high for the undergraduate pocket—sl.so to
$3—but the concert is worth the tariff.
