# Letters to the Editor--The Segregation Problem Discussed
## 
### 
'Propaganda*
Editor, The Daily:
I noted with interest your tacti
cal maneuver of exercise of your
questionable prerogative of with
holding my "letter to the editor"
on segregation for three days be
fore publishing it. And 1 wish to
congratulate you upon your edi
torial reply entitled "In Answer
to Bigotry" which you ran next
to my letter Friday.
Your editorial was, I must say,
one of the best examples I have
seen of one-sided quotation, glit
tering generalities, bandwagon
appeals and, a ho v e all, name
calling.
I wrote my letter in all sin
cerity, but that was the reply. Is
there no room in The Daily for
conscientious differences of opin
ion without the specter of such
unobjective and hostile rebuttal
hanging over the head of the con
tributor?
May I quote you "some exam
ples of the above-mentioned prop
aganda techniques. A few de
scriptions referring to those with
whom you disagree were: the big
oted, the uneducated, the blind,
the prejudiced, twisting their ba
sic truth to correspond with their
own narrow-minded, smug out
look; . . . men who have spoken
against integration of the races
. . . are hardly "responsible"; Her
man Talmadge . . . doubtless one
of the worst blights on the Ameri
can political scene in years; Gov
ernor James E. Folsom . . . must
be unfortunately counted as a re
sponsible leader; the ugliest blot
upon its (America's) good name
in the world.
I am not a Southerner. I do not
feel that I am a bigotist. Nor do
I feel that I am narrow-minded.
I feel no ill-will toward the South
ern In fact, I have num
bered some of my best friends
among the many Negroes that I
knew in Alabama.
But this 1 do say. You cannot
ram integration down the throats
of Southerners. It must be a grad
ual progression. Incidents such as
that involving Miss Lucy are only
attempts to add fodder to the
NAACP's cannon. This type of
action will do nothing more than
create ill-feeling between whites
and Negroes in the South and
slow down the day in which suc
cess 112 u 1 integration is accom
plished.
Although not a Democrat, I was
happy to note that at least some
"responsible" leader has compre
hended the magnitude of the prob
lem. Last week in southern Cali
fornia Adlai Stevenson said: "You
do not upset the tradition of gen
erations overnight. Whatever ra
cial progress is made will depend
upon the spirit of men, not troops
and bayonets."

Editor's Note:
• The Daily's editorial column
is scheduled days in advance. Oft
en we have letters on hand for
many days before we are able to
print them; often we do not print
them at all, if they are lacking
in campus-wide interest.
• Friday's editorial, "In Answer
to Bigotry," was scheduled to run
before the letter in question was
received. It was not a direct reply
to the letter; it was a reply to
common views which we believe
are incorrect, some of which the
letter writer also holds.
• Objectivity is reserved for the
news columns. The Daily express
es its opinions in editorials wheth
er they be hostile to anyone or
not.
• We hope the NAACP does
have new "fodder for its cannon";
they are working for the Negro,
not sitting and waiting for "the
day in which successful integra
tion is accomplished." If action
will not bring that day, what will?
Double Disagreement
Editor, The Daily:
I must disagree with both you
and the letter writer your Friday
editorial attacked.
With you because your editorial
showed no attempt to understand
the points the writer made; either
deliberately or stupidly distorted
his points; used a method of at
tack that a responsible newspaper
would not permit.
With the letter writer because
—while his points were reasona
bly accurate observations—they
are incomplete and for that rea
son distorted.
Mr. Cromwell's first observa
tion — "Most responsible Negro
leaders in the South are not for
integration of the races." He
might have added that those lead
ers are in positions of responsi
bility because of proven subserv
ience to the white leadership, that
their power rests on preservation
of the status quo. He might have
gone further to say a majority of
Negroes in the South are opposed
to integration. From my observa
tions in the South I could not
disagree.
But, in my opinion, that is lie
side the point. The motive for
Southern Negro support of segre
gation can be traced to a number
.of sources besides white-dominat
ed leadership: To fear in many
forms, to suppression of anything
(including education) which
might tend to replace traditional
goals, to a cultural inferiority
complex, to a tradition still ori
ented to slavery.
Slavery did not end with the
Civil War. Nor did that war, as
you contend, prove the South has
the same structure as the rest of
the nation. Wars, generally, prove

which side ran fight most effec
tively. The economic slavery of
the "new South" is slavery assur
edly as the pre-Civil War brand
was.
You need not travel to Alabama
to stje an example of this type of
slavery. Take a long look at Cali
fornia.
If The Daily is truly interested
in a banner to carry in the fight
for civil liberties, take a long look
at California. Take a look, for
example, at the opportunities
available to Americans living in
the Mexican sections of most of
this staters cities. Look hard at
some of the aspects <ff this sub
culture. Perhaps a simple exami
nation of the local problem might
do more good than all the emo
tional editorial comment you can
produce.
Not that I disagree with your
motives* All of us who consider
ourselves liberals must find the
situation in the South intolerable.
But, to be effective, our liberalism
must accept facts. The liberal
ideal will not be obtained by an
gry denunciation.
The Far West has come a long
way since its first days of arro
gant intolerance—toward, for in
stance, Orientals but it has a
long way to go. More than any
thing else the South could use a
good example.
The people of the South - white
and Negro- are facing a major
social change; they are troubled.
A man in trouble will reject the
angry words condemning him for
being in a mess. He wants under
standing with help.

Editor's Note: A responsible
newspaper is one which stands up
for what it believes in, and for
wliat its community believes in.
We believe what we said Friday,
and we're certain that Hie ma
jority of those in the community
agree.
We are worried about the local
problem and will comment, when
we have had the opportunity to
study it more fully. (See the let
ter "It Happened Here.")

'Talinadgisiir
Editor, The Daily:
Aren't we lucky that Mr. Crom
well has let us in on the results
of his "personal study" of the i
segregation problem? Especially
since the "study" was made while
ho was working for such an open
minded. unbiased Southern news
paper. This puts Mr. Cromwell in
the elite company of such distin
guished gentlemen as Herman
"Negroes-Wan t-Segregat ion" Tal
rnadge. In fact. Cromwell's con
clusion that "most responsible Ne-!
gro leaders . . . are not for inte
gration of the races" reeks of Tal
madgism.
We might as well say that the
Helots of ancient Greece "pre-1
ferred" slavery to freedom. Their
"responsible" leaders claimed '
they did, because they knew they |
would be killed off if they voiced
their true feelings.
Autherine Lucy has had the j
courage to state the feelings of
the Southern Negro- a desire for ;
an equal and integrated opportu
nity to gain- a decent'education.
The Intelligent White Students of
Alabama University have reward
ed her courage with rotten eggs.
Sounds as if the students were
trying to "teach" her to "prefer
segregation," doesn't it, Mr. Crom
well?
The NAACP (National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People) has had the courage
to stand up to its "white masters"
and ask for equal and inalienable
rights for the Negro. In answer
to this reasonable request, South
ern Whites have formed a racist
group known as the NAAWP
(National Association for the Ad
vancement of W hi t e People),
which has a long record of nefari
ous, and often violent, attempts
to "put the Negro in his place."
Are you a member of the NAA
WP, Mr. Cromwell?
Here's my suggestion for you,
Mr. Cromwell (the one that I can
put in print, that is): YOU make
"a more extensive study into the
real problems of the South." You
will find, as the Supreme Court
did, that much of the segregation

problem is caused by life whites ,
j who insist that "the Negro wants
I to be segregated."
Just one more thought for you,
Mr. Cromwell—YOU could easily
have been born with dark pig
i rnent instead of light. Would YOU
I want to be segregated then??

II Happened Here
Editor, The Daily:
This happened here, at Stan
ford University, early in autumn
quarter of 1955. A foreign student
was looking for a job where ho
could work for his room and
board. Finally, Stanford Employ
ment Office gave him the name
j of a lady who is an employee of
! "II." Department of the Univer
sity. But when she saw this for
| eign scholar she said: "I'm sorry,
but I can't have you. I did not
i know that you are colored."
A few days later this foreign
| student went to Palo Alto to get
a haircut. The barber said, "i'm
sorry but I can't trim your hair."
The foreign student asked in as
tonishment,' "In Palo Alto too?"
The barber answered firmly, "Yes,
if we cut your hair, we would lie
in trouble with the union."
November 19, 1955, was an un
forgettable day for thousands of
football fans who were at Stan
ford Stadium watching the tradi
tional California- Stanford game,
j It was also an unforgettable day
| for a foreign scholar at Stanford
j University but for a different
reason.
This student, full of Stanford
spirit, was looking for a seat in
the rooting section and finally
found a reasonable space where
he could squeeze in. When he
asked an American student to
move over, the American student
rudely replied, "Sit on the
ground!"
Without saying a wo r d, he
spread his coat on the ground and
sat down. A few minutes latei'
another American student, who
was also looking for a seat, came
by and was able to get a seat at
the very same spot.
'Hie foreign student told me

later: "I have a few friends in
Moscow and they all tell me that
they could get their hair cut in
any barber shop and they could
get into any restaurant. More
over, my friends in Moscow are
treated by the people as guests."
When he was asked why he
came to the United States to study
instead of to Russia, he replied,
"1 heard so much about American
democracy that 1 really wanted
to see myself how it works."
This studenl is now getting the
straight facts! lie feels that
America is losing in the world
battle of ideas, not because of the
attitude of the majority of the
American people but because of
a relatively small minority. "The
minority rules the majority," he
said.
If these incidents had happened
somewhere else, the effect might
have been different. But they
happened at Stanford University,
one of the top educational institu
tions of the United States.
As a matter of principle, what
is the difference between what
happened at the University of Al
abama and what happened at
Stanford? Basically, what is the
difference between the actions of
UCLA's sororities and fraterni
ties and the actions of some of
Stanford's fraternities regarding
the claims of national member
ship versus local?
Can we Christians expect non-
Christian people to be still when
we kick them? Would we be still
when we are kicked by others?
Now when the foreign student
returns to his own country, ob
viously he will be asked by his
own people about America and
Americans. What would you ex
pect him to say? Tomorrow he
may become a leader of his native
land and may represent his own
country in the United Nations.
Would he then believe what Amer
icans want him to believe about
American Christian democracy?
Will he ever forget the painful
experiences he had as a student
at Stanford University?
Let us put ourselves in his po
sition and answer these questions.
