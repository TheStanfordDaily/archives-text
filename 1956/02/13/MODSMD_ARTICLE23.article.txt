# What's doing at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
## Jet Engines Tested in World's Most Complete Privately Owned Turbine Laboratory 
### 
located on the bank of the Connecticut River
at East Hartford is a singular development facil
ity—the Andrew Willgoos Turbine Laboratory.
Here, behind concrete walls,
many types of engineers find a never-ending
challenge in the development and testing of
advanced aircraft engines.
Test methods used by Pratt & Whitney Air
craft in their unique laboratory are highly com
plex. Tests are conducted on full-scale experi
mental engines at simulated altitudes up to
76,000 feet. Extremely high speed airflow, with
pressure and temperature accurately controlled,
duplicates speeds as high as Mach 2.75. To re
produce such prodigious flight conditions, ex
traordinary equipment had to be devised. For
example, a 21,500-hp driving dynamometer sup
plies the enormous power needed to test jet
engine compressors over a range of speeds from
800 rpm to 16,000 rpm.
The time lapse between development and
production of new engines is rcduced consider
ably by the advanced facilities of the Willgoos
Laboratory. An outstanding example of results
achieved through concentrated engineering ef
fort and complete research support is the Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft J-57 turbojet. Today the
unchallenged leader in its field, the J-57 is
merely the forerunner of greater aircraft engines
that will power the preeminent military and
commercial aircraft of the future.

traordinary equipment had to be devised. For
example, a 21,500-hp driving dynamometer sup

engine compressors over a range of speeds from
800 rpm to 16,000 rpm.
The time lapse between development and
production of new engines is rcduced consider

Laboratory. An outstanding example of results
achieved through concentrated engineering ef

unchallenged leader in its field, the J-57 is
merely the forerunner of greater aircraft engines
that will power the preeminent military and

located on the bank of the Connecticut River
at East Hartford is a singular development facil
ity—the Andrew Willgoos Turbine Laboratory.
Here, behind concrete walls,
many types of engineers find a never-ending
challenge in the development and testing of
advanced aircraft engines.
Test methods used by Pratt & Whitney Air
craft in their unique laboratory are highly com
plex. Tests are conducted on full-scale experi
mental engines at simulated altitudes up to
76,000 feet. Extremely high speed airflow, with
pressure and temperature accurately controlled,
duplicates speeds as high as Mach 2.75. To re
produce such prodigious flight conditions, ex
traordinary equipment had to be devised. For
