# COP Belted By Ruggers In Wild Tilt
## 16 Points by Atkinson; Dick Bass in Fight 
### 
In a rather lough afternoon at
Stockton last Saturday, Dorsey
Atkinson expeditiously led his
mates to a 28-9 win over the COP
rugby team. Atkinson scored 1G
points in a contest marred by two
altercations which broke out into
open conflict, one involving COP's
famous freshman, Dick Bass.
Atkinson opened the scoring
with a penalty kick, which was
followed by Jack Taylor's try, a
score which is the rugby touch
down. The conversion was wide.
Kenny Swearingen got COP on
the move as he took I hie ball over
the last marker, but the point
after was missed. Atkinson put a
penalty kick through the uprights
and added the extra point after
Neal Scheidel's try to climax the
first-half activity with the score
board reading 11-3.
Bob Long started things off in
the second half with a try, after
which â€¢ Atkinson rolled into the
end zone with, his only try of the
afternoon. Dorsey hit one of the
two conversion tries. Don Cornell
followed with a pair of penalty
kicks for the Tigers. Gordy Young
and Atkinson added a try and a
penalty kick, giving a final count
of 28-9.
Bouquets were handed to At
kinson for the best kicking exhibi
tion given this year, to Jack Tay
lor for his elusive running and to
A 1 Kirkland, who started for the
first time this season, for his
kicking which kept the Indians
out of trouble.
All Card forwards shone as
they kept the COP Tigers with
their backs to the wall all after
noon.
