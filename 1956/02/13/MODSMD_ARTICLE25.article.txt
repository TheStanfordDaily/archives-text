take over.
In the last 10 minutes of the
game the Farm's second-stringers
outshot, out rebounded and out
played Menlo's discouraged first
team to add nine points to the
final margin. Wayne Marion, a
slippery will-o'-the-wisp guard, led
the way with nine tallies.
Menlo's record-breaking guard,
Kent Carter, canned 12 free
throws and 20 points. But he was
stopped cold on his field shooting
by Stanford's far-out defense.
The stocky, speedy ace sank
only four out of 19 field-goal at
tempts.
Against Poly High of San Fran
cisco, the Papooses were even hot
ter than against Menlo. They shot
a blazing 48 per cent and outre
bounded the high schoolers, 38-22.
Getting off to a slow start,
Stanford led, 5-0, but then fell
behind, 12-9, as Poly's guard Wil
Gasper potted six early points.
But Tom Crawford hit with six
minutes left in the half to give
the Papooses a 15-14 edge. From
there they pulled away to victory.
Connecting on over 40 per cent
of their shots in each game, Stan
ford's frosh cagers Friday night
slaughtered Poly High of San
Francisco, 08-49, and on Saturday
mauled Menlo JC, 71-44.
The victories extended the Pa
pooses' win streak to eight games.
Against Menlo. Stanford shot
43 per cent and led all the way.
Pacing the Papooses was forward
John Pflueger with IT points on
seven tricky lay-ins and jump
shots and three foul shots.
The game started off as if both
teams would top 80 points. Be-

fore five minutes had elapsed, i
Stanford had scored 15 and Menlo !
nine.
Sparking Stanford in this rush :
were Brent Leonard and Pflueger. j
Then the teams' shooting cooled
off to a more normal pace, and
Menlo threatened briefly bv nar

rowing the gap to 15-13.
But Grant Chappell entered the
game for the Papooses and quick
ly popped in two buckets. The
frosh were never again in danger.
By halftime the Papooses led.
35-25, and in the second half they
outshot the visitors, 38 per cent to
22 per cent, and padded a 51-33
cushion before letting the subs
take over.
