SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12
(UP) The largest Chinatown
outside of Asia greeted the year
of I lie monkey today, defying a
police edict limiting the use of
firecrackers.
Midnight last night marked the
beginning of a week-long celebra
tion of the Chinese new year 4654
by some 16,000 residents of the
city's Chinatown.
In past years the police depart
ment has looked the other way
as the celebrants shoot off fire
crackers to ward off evil spirits.
This year newly-appointed po
lice chief Frank Ahern cracked
down.
He ruled that firecrackers could
be set off only iti Portsmouth
Square between midnight and I
a.m. today an.l between 6 and 7
p.m. next Sunday at the windup
of the New Year's celebration.
Chinese generally observed the
lime limit early today but made
no effort f<> confine their noise
making activities to Portsmouth
Square.
No one was arrested.
Throughout the week art ex
hibits, fashion shows, dances and
athletic contests will commemo
rate the monkey's year.
