# 'Bottom of the Bottle' Story Is Good, But Plot Undeveloped
## Potential Lost When Plot Fails to Develop Into a 'Cain and Abel in the Modern Idiom' 
### Richard Mende 
My older brother has helped me haul the family ear out of ditches
at early hours in the morning, loaned me money from time to time
in order to stave off the full weight of judicial or parental wrath
and generally preserved me from accidental but constantly impend
ing self-destruction.
I could therefore sympathize with the irresponsible brother in

-"The Bottom of the Bottle."
And I was vastly amused that |,
the older brother in that film
nearly drowned himself because
he suddenly felt an urgent need
for public expiation. Responsible
people are almost totally without
common sense, being inclined to
ward histrionic displays of right
eousness.
Disappointment
11 â–  would have been a pleasure j
lo report I hat "The Bottom of the :
Hot tic" retells the story of Cain!
and Abel in the modern idiom, I
but the force fulness and truth of \
that story never gets beyond the
opening scenes.
The essential idea of the movie
is excellent. Of two brothers who
came from humble beginnings,
one had worked his way up, be
coming a respected and prosper
ous lawyer in a Southwestern
community.
The younger brother had killed ,
a man in a drunken brawl early
in life and, as an escaped convict,
was desperately in need of help.
Undeveloped Plot
The older br o the r's career
would be endangered for aiding
a criminal, and his position in the
community would be jeopardized
if the family skeleton were drag
ged out.
Unfortunately, the situation is
never fully developed; the movie
is padded out with cop-and-robber I
chases and other impediment ia. |
And those big, sweeping pano-1
rama shots, of which only Cinema |
Scope is capable, are used with !
only intermittent relevance.
Capable Acting
The acting was capable, consid-'
ering the frequently improbable
demands of the script and the in
compatible mixture of motives.
The younger brother is sup
posed to really love his wife (a
responsible man's failing), and if
he were convinced that escaping
into Mexico was urgent, it was
unlikely that he would make a
display of himself, breaking up j
parties, getting drunk, and the
like, instead of hanging low long i
enough to get away.
Incidentally, anyone interested j
in .learning how law and order i
were brought to Wichita ought I
not to stay for the Stanford Thea- j
ter's second picture.
