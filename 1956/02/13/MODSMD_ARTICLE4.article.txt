# Lucy to Return If Court Allows
## 
### 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Feb. 12
(UP) The University of Alaba
ma's first Negro student, whose
admission stirred up campus riot
ing and violence last weekend, has
every intention of returning to
classes should a Federal court so
allow, Attorney Arthur Shores
said today.
The 26-year-old coed, Authentic
Lucy, is awaiting the outcome of
a Feb. 29 Federal court hearing
which is expected to determine
whether she will return to the
university.
Shores said he hadn't talked
with Miss Lucy about what she
will do until the hearing comes
tip "I guess she'll just rest; she's
gone through such an ordeal."
The attorney said there was a
possibility she may sit in on
classes at another school or en
gage a private tutor to keep up
with her school work during the
interim.
But Shores emphasized that the
Negro coed, first in Alabama's
125-year history, plans to return
to Alabama if the court orders
university officials to readmit her.
A tense calm has reigned over
the campus ever since the girl
was suspended, and four-fifths of
the student body has reportedly
pledged to abstain from violence
should she return.
University President O. C. Car
michael has promised that Miss
Lucy will be reinstated if the
court orders it, but he said the
city and campus police organiza
tions may need reinforcements.
