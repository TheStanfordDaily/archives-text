President Eisenhower
Commenting on the possibility,
the London Sunday Times noted
today that "the most striking ex
ample was Marshal Bulganin's!
letter to President Eisenhower on
disarmament last summer.
"The last two Bulganin letters
to President Eisenhower |on'
friendship treaties| . . . were also
thought to bear the Mac Lean im-,

Burgess and Mac Lean appeared
in a Moscow hotel room yester
day, ending four years of mystery
as to their whereabouts.

in Washington, were working for
the Soviet foreign service.
