# Pianist Rudolf Serkin to Play In Mem Aud Concert Tonight
## Pianist, Now on American Concert Tour, Is World-Famed for Beethoven Interpretations 
### 
Bohemian pianist Rudolf Serkin, considered one of the world's
finest interpreters of Beethoven, will play tonight in Memorial Audi
torium at 8:15 under the auspices of the Concert Series.
Serkin, currently on a sell-out American concert tour, was born in
Eger, Bohemia, in 1903. He could play the piano with "facility" and
could read music at the age of

four.
But his father, a Russian singer
turned merchant to support the
family, insisted that he wanted
"no child prodigy." His son, he
said, "must first become an ar
tist."
On the advice of the celebrated
pianist Alfred Fruenfeld, Serkin
was taken to Vienna and placed
under the tutelage of Professor
Richard Robert.
At 12 Serkin made his debut
with the Vienna Symphony Or
chestra. Although lho concert was
a great success and offers poured
in from enthusiastic managers,
his teacher and parents decided
he was too young to start out on
a concert tour.
Serkin met viol in s t Adolf
Busch at the age of 17, was im
pressed with the musician and
went to live with him in Switzer
land.
He later married Busch's
daughter and lived with the fam
ily until the war forced them to
come to the United States.
Serkin's American debut came
in 1936, when he played with the
New York Philharmonic - Sym
phony under Arturo Toscanini.
He regards his debut with Tosca
nini as the greatest musical expe
rience of his life.
In the 20 years since his Ameri
can debut Serkin has risen to the
top rank among concert pianists.
fie is especially noted for his
renditions of Beethoven's piano
concertos. I lis recording of the
"Emperor" Concerto is considered
the definitive projection of that
masterpiece.
Tickets for Serkin's Stanford
concert are sold out.
