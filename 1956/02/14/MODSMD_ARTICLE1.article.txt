# Serkin 'Comes Close to Perfection' In Concert Series Program Last Night
## 
### Stew Toy 
JI there is any contemporary
concert pianist who comes close
to perfection iincl there are far
too many who do not that pian
ist is Rudolf Serkin.
In his Memorial Auditorium
Concert Series appearance Jast
night, Serkin again demonstrated
his rare capacity for combining i
superb technical prowess and mu
sical sensitivity, an attribute that
has earned him an increasingly
high esteem among the world's
musical elite.
Serkin's program i nc 1 ud e d
Bach's "Capriccio on the Depar
ture of His Beloved Brother,"
Haydn's Sonata in E-flat major,
Beethoven's Sonata in A-flat ma
jor and Brahms' "Variations and
Fugue on a Theme of Handel."
In his "Capriccio," Bach seemed
to make a rather feeble attempt
to bridge (he strict gap between
the Classical and Romantic peri
ods. The various movements de
pict. among other things, the emo
tions of his friends on his broth
er's departure.
But if Bach failed to capture i
these emotions, fu> at least suc
ceeded in giving the performing ■
pianist a suitable vehicle for his j
own expressiveness. Serkin play- ]
ed the piece with a fine sense of |
its subtle, if technical, tender-1
nesses.

| The Beethoven Sonata was also
filled with potential virtuosity,
plus the usual tense majesty of
the German master. Serkin, Jong
famed for his interpretations of
Beethoven, fulfilled the piece's
possibilities with enormous power
and emotional expression.
The major work on ihc pro
i gram was Brahms' "Variations
and Fugue on a Theme of Han
del." Brahms did his best to eke
out as many variations as pos
sible on a rather meager melody.
But Serkin's dynamic artistry
managed to save the piece from
dullness. His amazing technique,
seemingly mechanical in its flow
ing rapidity but certainly not in
its effect, ran through the most
difficult passages w i th perfect
ease.
Throughout his concert Serkin
displayed a truly remarkable
sense of suspensefully accurate
| timing.
His masterfully articulate col

oring and shading as creative as
anything the composer himself
could achieve could hardly fail
to live up to those put into the
compositions in the first great
surge of creative energy.
But, with all his impressive
playing. Serkin's talents were not
displayed at their best. His main
musical triumph is in his tremen
dous but delicate power, which, to
be displayed at its best, should
ideally have an orchestra to put
it in its proper prospective.
Serkin had this orchestra last
week in his concert with the San
Francisco Symphony. His per
formance of Beethoven's Piano
Concerto No. 4 seemed to be an
entity in itself an achievement
as great as that of Beethoven in
writing the work.
But Serkin's concert last night
was certainly one of great merit,
and was the most significant and
enjoyable program thus far in
this .year's Concert Series.

pianist a suitable vehicle for his j
own expressiveness. Serkin play- ]
ed the piece with a fine sense of |
its subtle, if technical, tender-1
nesses.

| The Beethoven Sonata was also
filled with potential virtuosity,
plus the usual tense majesty of
the German master. Serkin, Jong
famed for his interpretations of
Beethoven, fulfilled the piece's
possibilities with enormous power
and emotional expression.
The major work on ihc pro
i gram was Brahms' "Variations
and Fugue on a Theme of Han
del." Brahms did his best to eke
out as many variations as pos
sible on a rather meager melody.
But Serkin's dynamic artistry
managed to save the piece from
dullness. His amazing technique,
seemingly mechanical in its flow
ing rapidity but certainly not in
its effect, ran through the most
difficult passages w i th perfect
ease.
Throughout his concert Serkin
displayed a truly remarkable
sense of suspensefully accurate
| timing.
His masterfully articulate col

oring and shading as creative as
anything the composer himself
could achieve could hardly fail
to live up to those put into the
compositions in the first great
surge of creative energy.
But, with all his impressive
playing. Serkin's talents were not
displayed at their best. His main
musical triumph is in his tremen
dous but delicate power, which, to
be displayed at its best, should
ideally have an orchestra to put
it in its proper prospective.
Serkin had this orchestra last
week in his concert with the San
Francisco Symphony. His per
formance of Beethoven's Piano
Concerto No. 4 seemed to be an
entity in itself an achievement
as great as that of Beethoven in
writing the work.
But Serkin's concert last night
was certainly one of great merit,
and was the most significant and
enjoyable program thus far in
this .year's Concert Series.

his rare capacity for combining i
superb technical prowess and mu

has earned him an increasingly

musical elite.

to make a rather feeble attempt
