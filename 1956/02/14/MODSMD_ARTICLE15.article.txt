# Nixon Blasts 'Hybrid' Demos, Says Ike's Negro Rights Plans Greatest Since Emancipation
## Vice-President Attacks 'Democratic Performance' at Lincoln Day Dinner 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 13 (U.R) Vice-President Richard M. Nixon, scor
ing Democratic "helplessness*' in the civil righls field, said tonight
the Eisenhower administration has "registered the greatest advancc"
in Negro rights since the Emancipation Proclamation.
Nixon's frank .invitation to Negroes to vote Republican next No

vember came one day after Adlai
E. Stevenson, a contender for the
Democratic presidential nomina
tion, urged that the school segre
gation issue be kept out of the
campaign.
Stevenson said in. Portland,
Oregon, yesterday that efforts by
rival candidates to out promise
each other could weaken national
unity and damage the cause of
civil rights.
"Futile" Party
In an address prepared for do
livery at a Lincoln Day dinner in
the Waldorf Astoria Hotel here,
the Vice-President charged that
the "Democrats know their hy
brid party is helpless and futile"
in the field of civil rights and
race relations.
"Just the other day out in Cali
fornia Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Ke
fauver talked about it [civil
rights| again and, as usual, they
contradicted each other, and then
each of thom contradicted him
self," Nixon said.
While crediting the Northern
wing of the Democratic party
with "unquestioned good inten
tions" on the issue, he said that
"perhaps in no other field is there
a greater contrast between Demo
cratic campaign promises and
Democratic congressional per
formance."
Ended Segregation
On the other hand, he said, the
Eisenhower Administration has
abolished racial segregation in
the armed forces, among employ
ees working on Federal contracts,
among Federal civilian employees
and in the District of Columbia.
The Interstate Commerce Com
mission also has abolished racial
discrimination in bus, boat and
railroad travel, he said.
"And,"he added, "speaking for
a unanimous Supreme Court, a
great Republican chief justice.
Earl Warren, has ordered an end
to racial segregaion in the na
iton's public schools.
"We did all this in just three
years. The only hope for contin
ued progress toward the realiza
tion of the American dream of
equal opportunity in every re
spect for every American is
through the election, not only of
a Republican President, but of a
Republican House and Senate."
Attacks Stevenson
Nixon centered his attacks on
Stevenson, charging that the 1952
Democratic standardbearer shows
promises of becoming "the great
hair-splitter of 1956."
Turning to Stevenson's attacks
t on Administration foreign policy,
Nixon said "it is a lot better to
be on the brink than in the drink
as far as war is concerned."
The Vice-President said the Eis
enhower Administration's accom
plishments of peace and unprece
dented prosperity have made the
Republican party, "in truth, the
majority par ty."
