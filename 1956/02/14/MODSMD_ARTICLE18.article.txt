NEW YORK, Feb. 13 (UP)
â€¢Gov. James E. Folsom today
blamed the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People and "professional agitai
drs" for recent campus riots it
the University of Alabama in pro
test against the school's first No
gro student.
"If the NAACP and profession
al agitators, with local profession
al help, would leave our problems
alone in Alabama," Folsom said
in a prepared statement, "we
would be far better able to cope
with them.
"If the professional agitators
had been interested only in enter
ing a student at the University ol
Alabama solely for the purpose
of routine classroom work, then
they would not have come with
their own cameramen and news
men to the campus. They would
not have made such an exception
out of the student's routine aetivi
ties," Folsom said.
"I still maintain that the pro
fessional agitators are the w<>i t:
enemy the Negro people have,
and I strongly believe history will
bear me out on this," Folsom said
He said nothing can be done by
force. "If it could have been, then
it would have come about during
Reconstruction days," he said.
