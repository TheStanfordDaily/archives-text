# A 						Weak Compromise

### 
Most persons bound by democratic ideals of

ernor proposed that all Federal aid to segre
gated sehools be ehopped off in an effort to

The major issue in the segregation contro
versy is not whether schools should be inte
grated: the history of social progress in this
country assures us complete equality of the
races will soon be realized.
The real problem is to decide what methods
we are to employ to insure that every Ameri
can, regardless of race gets the rights guaran
teed him by our political heritage.

say that Negroes will benefit from integration
alone, although the necessity for immediate in
tegration cannot be over-emphasized.
Educational facilities, sickeningly deficient
in the South, must rise to meet those of the
more developed areas before true equality of

Slashing Federal aid, while there is a possi
bility it may force Southern leaders to listen to
reason, only compromises our determination to
create an educated, aware citizenry and ren
ders ineffective the progress already made in
improving educational standards.
Immediate government action must be forth
coming, but we would suggest to (Governor Har
riman that lie propose schemes more construc
tive than those which will hurt the innocent as
well the the guilty.
