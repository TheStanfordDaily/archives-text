## UCLA Sororities Quit the Student Council Over Racial Requirements 
### Sally Trapnell 
Proving that racial problems are not con
fined to tin; South, last Wednesday the UCLA
I'anhcllenic group representing 30 sororities
and 1250 women withdrew from student gov
ernment representation.
The source of tin* boycott was a demand hv
the legislature that sororities submit their con
stitutions so that racial restrictions may be
studied.
Campus sources say that the Interfraternity
Council is expected to make a similar protest
move next. week.
Spokesmen for the UCLA organizations re
ported they are willing to remove the racial
and religious restrictions but want to do it grad
ually. Approximately one-fifth of the student
body belong to these groups.
One reason given for the refusal was that na
tional sororities have a policy of not submitting
constitutions to the scrutiny of student govern
ment groups.

The Daily Texan is battling with the Univer
sity of Texas regents over what restrictions shall
be put on the newspaper's editorial policy. The
administration wants editorials to conform
more closely to the university publications
handbook. Editors contend that these rules
are so ambiguous that they would limit editorial
subject matter and rule out any comment on
state issues. *
The regents' argument is the university is
supported by state funds and the student news
paper should not criticize state administrations.
Recently the Texan published guest edito

rials 011 an insurance scandal which were criti
cal of State Governor Shivers' administration.
Daily Texan editor maintains he was elected
democratically to express his convictions and
that the Daily Texan must keep its reputation
as one of the most liberal college newspapers.

The University of Southern California has
ousted two students who were caught stealing
tests from professors' 1 offices during finals week.
Three others are being disciplined and the uni
versity has had as much trouble with hearsay
as with fact.
Humors that from 50 to 170 exams were taken
have been circulated as well as gossip connect
ing several prominent students with the inci
dent. The Counselor of Men is also supposed
to have sent 1000 telegrams to students about
the stolen exams.
Til desperation the university finally had to
appoint a committee to separate fact from fic
tion. But at week's end students still reported
hearing where they could get stolen tests at $40
a throw.

Maybe this would solve Stanford's traffic
problem. At the University of Colorado police
set up a roadblock last week to catch wayward
freshmen who ventured to bring a car on cam
pus.
Colorado adopted a ban on freshman cars
last fall to ease the parking situation. Despite
the rule, between 35 and 40 violators were
caught in the crackdown. Similar rulings are
in effect at Indiana, Purdue, Texas, Illinois,
Michigan and Michigan State. An idea for
Traffic Com, at least.
