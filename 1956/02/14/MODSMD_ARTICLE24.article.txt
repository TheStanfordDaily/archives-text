'Biased Conclusion' ?
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to D. C. Cromwell's letter on the
"so-called problem" as it appeared in the letter
to-the-editor column of the Feb. 10, 19!>G, edition
of The Daily, 1 wonder if Cromwell's personal
research on the Birmingham (Ala.) News last
year didn't reveal a biased conclusion, for sev
eral reasons.
1. I would like to know whose and what stand
ards his research used to determine the responsi
ble Negro leaders who were not for integration.
I realize that certain Negroes for economic rea
sons favor segregation.
Many of these individuals are personally
wealthy, as a result of segregation, but are not
considered as leaders by their race. The Negro
leaders in the eyes of a white Southerner and a
Negro are quite different, as are the qualifica
tions for ascertaining such a person.
2. If equal and "often better" facilities exist
for Negroes in the Southern school systems (as
Cromwell reported), then many white children
are being deprived of the best possible education
for them, and such an injustice is not, in my
mind, in line with the practices orally associated
with the "American ideal."
These white children should be allowed to go
to these "often better" schools that the Negroes
supposedly possess, and possibly future students
of the University of Alabama will be better
grounded in the fundamental decencies of human
relations.
3. The social make-up of the South that Crom
well "claims" is "not comparable to the remain
der of the nation" is at this writing governed by
• the same Biil of Rights, Constitution and Supreme
Court as the rest of the United States—or did my
friend forget that when he used inconsistency of
social make-up as an excuse for continued segre
gation?
D. G. Cromwell recommended that a more ex
tensive research of the real problems of the South
be made before criticizing it. I assure him my
research is both extensive and real. I am a
NEGRO who has lived in the South.

Show the Way
Editor, The Daily:
In refuting the statements made in D. G.
Cromwell's letter last Friday, the editor may
have felt he was doing his duty to clear up any
misconceptions which anyone in the student body
may have had toward segregation. In actuality
the editorial was uninteresting and unfeeling.
Few people this side of the Mason-Dixon Line
in college life actively support segregation: there
fore, the editorial only actively reaffirmed what
the majority of us already profess to believe.
The Daily ignored the interesting questions.
If it is self-evident that Negroes are equal, and
should be integrated with whites, why are the
Southerners also not convinced of this, since they
are no less intelligent than we?
And, how close is the situation in Alabama
to us is it possible that we unthinkingly support
segregation practices in our own communities?
In answering the first question, one would
find that segregation survives in the South de
spite the criticism of national magazines and con
cerned groups. In my own experience in the
South, I have found that ordinarily segregation
is not discussed but seems built into the order of
life.
Tensions—generated by the many changes
Negroes have begun to openly demand — have
brought the issue into the open only recently,
and it is by no means as obvious that there will
be eventual integration to the Southerner as it is
to onlookers like ourselves.

Many of them are indignant because they see '
no alternative to segregation, being brought up
with the attitude that it is the only peaceful way i
the two groups can live together. Not having had
the chance to ineet Negroes on equal terms be
fore, they do not consider it possible that they
could have ideas and values in common with
them and therefore cannot conceive of them as
being friendly, active members of the community, j
We need to ask the second question, for, until
we desegregate such things as our housing de- j
velopments, Southerners will defend themselves •
by pointing out that the very people condemning!
them still support segregation. Also, the Stanford >
student lias heard about Negro equality, about I
those individuals in the South who gather a fol-,
lowing beeause»they seem to be able to justify |
the existence of Jim Crow, and this will not con
structively arouse him. He needs to be shown
how the problem affects him, and be shocked out
of his smug attitude toward, the South.
The editorial was unfeeling because it did the
easy, trite thing: it merely condemned segrega
tion an approach which in the past has only put
Southerners more on the defensive and made
them more violent in their support of the system.
The situation demands understanding, not just
criticism, and The Daily would have done well
to have pointed this out.

The Foreign View
Editor, The Daily:
As a guest of the Stanford students, I have
no right to uplift my voice in a family quarrel.
But ihe riot of Alabama University flashes in
news-banners from Marseilles to Vladivostok and
is no longer a mere American concern. One can
be sure that enemies of this nation abroad wel
come the news from the South with more delight
than had a new McCarthy been canonized by the
press.
We have witnessed and denounced the actions
of the Alabama students, viewing the situation
well aloof from our Hoover Tower. Stanfordians
are chattering about it in the Cellar, and liberals
are overrunning The Daily with letters to the
editor.
Almost everybody is shocked, maybe even
ashamed, that students of our own generation
display such a show of medieval hatred, intoler
ance and prejudices.
Why don't we do something more drastic
about it? Why don't the liberals gather and con
demn in a resolution the actions of fellow stu
dents at Alabama? Why don't we all give a dime
to a fund for colored students who are unable to
pursue their studies in the South? Why don't we
define our position clearly in this case by inviting
Miss Lucy to Stanford if she is unable to re-enter
the University of Alabama?
If for no other reason, we ought to do this
before other people act. I bet that in one month
we will see sympathy resolutions with Miss Lucy
from universities all over the world. These stu
dents will hear everything about the riot but
little about the letters to the editor in The Stan
ford Daily.
They will think, as many people already do,
that American students silently approve of racial
segregation, at least in practice. If the American
students do not vigorously react on such inci
dents as those we have witnessed, they will find
that their lack of alertness will result in a de
plorable loss of prestige abroad.
The world is in too fast an evolution today
to wait another 180 years for the fulfillment of
the promise that gave this nation its independ
ence.
