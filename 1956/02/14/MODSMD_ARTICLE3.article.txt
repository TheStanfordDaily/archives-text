SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 13
(UPI Establishment of a new
electronics laboratory at Stan
ford Industrial Park that will
speed the age of automation was
! announced today.
Beckman Instruments, 'Inc., of
Los Angeles sairl the new divi
sion, to be known as the Shockley
Semiconductor Laboratory, will
develop and produce transistors
the tiny instruments being used
increasingly to replace vacuum
tubes.
The lab is named for its direc
tor, Dr. William Shockley, inven
tor of the junction transistor. He
has gathered a team of top-flight
research men. now quartered at
Mountain View. The group will
move into the new center next
August.
Dr. Shockley said at a press
I conference today that transistors
already have virtually "taken ov
er" the hearing-aid business and
are in widespread use in dial tele
phones.
He said virtues of the transistor
are that it takes up less space
than a vacuum tube, is more re
liable and uses less power.
The former' Bell Telephone sci
entist said transistors are impor
tant in the manufacture of com
puters the "electronic brains"
that have been hailed as being
capable of doing everything from
predicting baseball scores to fig
