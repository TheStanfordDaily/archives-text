# Reds Recall Envoys; 'Peace Offensive' Set
## Diplomats to Return To Posts This Weekend 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 13 (UP). The
Kremlin quietly has recalled its
top envoys in major Western cap
i t a 1 s to discuss a new Soviet
"peace offensive" aimed at driv
ing a wedge between the Western
allies, according to an announce
ment today.
The Soviet ambassadors to
Washington, London, Paris and
Bonn left their posts unobtrusive
ly during the weekend en route
to Moscow. They were expected
to return to their embassies by
next weekend.
Ostensibly, the Soviet envoys
were summoned to Moscow to
take part in the 20th Communist
Party Congress, opening tomor
row.
But indications from behind the
Iron Cur tain were that the Krem
lin would confer closely with its
chief representatives in the West
on the future course of Soviet for
eign policy.
Three Topics
Three major issues were be
lieved scheduled for discussion by
the envoys in talks with Premier
Nikolai A. Bulganin and Commu
nist party chief Nikita S. Khrush
chev. They were:
• A new Soviet peace and prop
aganda offensive to be launched
by the party congress.
• New moves for the unifica
tion of Germany, including a bid
for direct talks with the West
German Government in by-pass
ing the West.
• The forthcoming visit to Brit
tain of Bulganin and Khrushchev.
Wedge Tactics
New wedge-driving tactics be
tween Britain and the United
States, on one hand, and between
France and the Anglo-American
partners, on the other, were ex
pected to form part of the strat
egy-
It also was believed likely the
question of disarmament would
come under close review. A new
round of disarmament talks is
scheduled to open in London on
March 5 among the United States,
Britain, France, Canada and Rus
sia.
