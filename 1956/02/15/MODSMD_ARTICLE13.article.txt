# TUESDAY SERIES
## Adams Says Photography Is a Language 
### 
"Photography is a language
informative, factual and poetic,"
Ansel Adams told the audience
which filled Memorial Auditorium
for his Tuesday Series talk last
night.
Describing the different types
of photography as pictorial, func
tional, scientific, reproductive and
creative, Adams stated that crea
tive photography depends on the
photographer because of its aes

The bearded photographer rap
idly covered the history of pho
tography, citing in a quick mono

the past and present. He cau
tioned against setting up false
standards of beauty based on the
past.
Warned Audience
Adams humorously warned his
audience about one kind of ama

ist, because he is actually only an
imitator, posing his subjects. The
other type, the casual "snapshoot

according to Adams.
"Journalistic photography is of
tremendous importance," he ex
plained. "It can augment or de
stroy." Adams protested against
ediforialism in photographs which
has become "almost a fetish."
"A good picture is clearly visu
alized in the mind before the ac
tual exposure," Adams stated. He
questioned the validity of calling
pictures of abstracts photogra
phy.
Experts Controversy
Adams said he expected con
troversy over his statement that
"there is really nothing creative
that the color camera can do."
Using slides as examples for
the latter part of his lecture, -he
showed various effects which
could be gained in black-and-white
photography. The slides them
selves illustrated the newer de
velopments of photography, chief
ly the Polaroid Land camera.
A photographer has to find the
world through his own camera,
according to Adams. He feels that
it is better to construct than to
destroy, and criticized taking pic
tures of depressing subjects,
