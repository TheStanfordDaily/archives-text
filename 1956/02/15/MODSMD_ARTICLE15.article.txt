# Winter One-Acts Enter Final Week of Rehearsal
## Three Original Plays Deal with Childhood, Racial Discrimination; Varied by High Comedy 
### 
Willi late rehearsals and a quickened tempo in the shops at Memo
rial Auditorium, preparation for Stanford's Winter One-Acts swings
into the last week before opening curtain.
The three original one-acts written, produced and directed by stu
dents here at the University will open Feb. 22 and close Feb. 25.'
Preparing for tomorrow night's technical rehearsal, directors Judy

Doty, Serguey Kondratieff and
Warner Leßoy are putting the
final touches on their respective
one-ac^s.
Miss Doty is working with
"Morning Child," which features
the talents of 11-year-old Ralph
Liddle as Clive, the little boy who
finds himself surrounded by a
teetering world of unreality.
Kondratieff, director of "As
True as Cressida," is polishing the
high comedy portion of this year's
one-acts. "Cressida" is basically
the story of love, a Greek farce
with a light look at sex without
groat concern with morality.
Cressida, played by Shirley
Douglass, has to choose in her
amorous advent ures between
Troilus (Gary Waynesmith) and
Diomedes (Lair Parent), two
Greek heroes done in comical con
trast.
"Chiaroscuro," under the direc
tion of Warner Leßoy, revolves
about Jim (DaveWhorf), the fra
ternity president who faces not
only the problem of segregation
within his house but also his own
seemingly irresolvable emotional
conflict which arises between his
natural talents and desires and
the wishes of his father.


WINTER ONE-ACTS technical crew is busy preparing for the
opening' of the three plays on Feb. 22 to 25. Shown painting scenery
flats are, top to bottom, Ann Herrick, Judy Doty and Terry Sandke.
