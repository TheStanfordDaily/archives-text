### 
MOSCOW. Feb. 14 (UP)—So
viet Communist party chief Ni
kila Eikita S. Khrushchev said
today the United States was ap
proaching the end of its economic
rope. He challenged the capital
istic nations to an all-out econom
ic war for survival.
Khrushchev told the first party
congress since the death of Stalin
that Soviet Communism's chief

aim now is to make Communism
"a world system."
But he publicly scrapped Karl
Marx's precept that Communist
capitalist war is inevitable and de
clared that economic means would
be used to make a world system
of Communism.
In a massive foreign policy ad
dress keynoting the congress,
Khrushchev said the United
States must admit that the Com
munist camp is "invincible" and
establish good relations with Mos
cow in line with the recent friend
ship treaty offered to President
Eisenhower.
Otherwise, he said, the world
would see "an arms race on a
greater scale and a still more
dangerous growth of forces on
both sides."
Speaking to some 2,000 dele
gates and guests in the former
Czarist throne room of the Krem
lin, the Communist party leader
declared that Russia would keep
pace with Ihe arms production of
capitalist powers.
Premier Nikolai Bulganin, who
had been absent from party func
tions for more than a month, sat
on Khrushchev's right; other
members of the ruling Presidium
sat on either side.
He said American commodity
surpluses and production cuts in
dicate the United States already
is losing the new phase of the
economic war. The Soviet Union,-
meantime, is now in second place
in world production and rapidly
catching up, he said.

Khrushchev said America "has
passed the peak in the use of its
post-war economic possibilities,
and no new markets arc in sight.
"Commodity stocks and consu
mer credit have reached danger
ous proportions in the United
States," he said. "New economic
crises and upheavals are inevita
bly bound to emerge in the capi
talist countries."
