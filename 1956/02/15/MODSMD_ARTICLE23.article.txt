Stanford students view with moral indigna
tion the race riots fomented two weeks ago on
the Alabama University campus, but ask aloof
ly, what can we do about it?
I hc student Legislature last week recognized
that Stanford students can descend their "ivory
tower"' and put themselves on record as con*
detuning such reactionary hatred and intoler
ance. •
A motion to write a letter of encourage
ment. to the Alabama student legislature for

condemning "mob violence" on its campus
was tabled pending further action in Ala
bama.
If the motion is revived and passed at to
night's Legislature meeting, Stanford will have
shown that it is aware of life beyond its own
geographical boundaries, that it is interested in
encouraging the "winds of freedom" to blow
over other campuses.
We know it will be revived; wo have faith in
the fair-mindedness of Stanford students.
