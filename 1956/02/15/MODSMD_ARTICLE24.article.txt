During the past few months an impressive,
rather unique type of lobby has emerged on the
\N ashington political scene. —
'This eager pressure group, composed of the
grand moguls of the (»OP, is dedicated solely to
the purpose of perpetuating the Eisenhower
Administration.
Realizing that their chances of keeping a ten
ant in the White House atf mighty slim if
Eisenhower is not on the ballot, they are pres
suring the 66-year-old Executive to run again
despite the [act that his diminished leadership
and possible exit from office during the term
are a sorry answer to the serious problems be
setting the country.
It might be well for the GOP to consider the
following qualifications of a strong Executive
before they jump on the Ike band wagon.
• A strong leader must assume the difficult
role in uniting divergent factions of his Admin
istration.
• He must be strong enough personally to
resist pressure from office-seeking party hacks
and to place under him men of responsibility
and foresight.
• lie must keep a watchful eye on these un
derlings.
• He must exercise utmost tact, vigilance and
strength in directing his measures through an
oft-times balking Congress.
• He must harmonize the divergent voices is
suing from the domestic scene and present to
the world a consistent foreign policy.
The country needs a leader strong physically
as well as morally—not a "chairman of the
boj ml" or an executive sieve through which di
ligent policies and plans must pass in the hope
that they may form some amalgamation ac
eeptable to the American people.
