# Should Ike Run for Second Term? GOP Hackers Say Yes; Demos, No
## 
### Jim Palmer 
A grcaL President will make a great decision
in the next few days.
Yesterday afternoon six medical experts re
leased a report on the physical condition of
Dwight Eisenhower, a report indicating; the
President is physically strong enough to with
stand the strains of another White House term.
Today Kisenhower goes to (ieorgia where lie
will ponder the question all America is asking
and where he will reach his decision.
There is concern in some Corners of the politi
cal arena that a second-term Eisenhower will
he somehow different from the first-term Eisen
hower.
This concern arises from unfounded fears
that a man who has suffered a heart attack is
not capable of administrative, political or
moral strength.
Somehow they helievc it is possible for a man
to lose hold of his leadership qualities because
of a physical illness that might force him to di
vest himself of some official trivia.
There is no logic or truth in this argument.
It can he accepted for what it is—a bleating cry
raised by the "outs" to discredit the man who
represents their political defeat.
These same people forget the case of their
own Senate ma jority leader who has suffered a
physical illness similar to the President's hut
is buck at his job again with as much force as
before.
Ike will never be a figurehead or a "chairman
of the hoard * President, for if he does not be
lieve he can assume the full responsibility, the
full stresses and strains of the White House, he
will not be a candidate in 1956.
The medical report says he can do the job.
There is strong basis to believe he'will make a
wise choice.
