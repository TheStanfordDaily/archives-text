'Insults, Insinuations'
Editor, The Daily:
Since the publication of my letter Friday, I
have been subjected in "your" Daily to insults
and insinuations all the way from your inference
that 1 was a bigotist to freshman Jim Hoenig's
immature allegation that I was another Talmadge
or a member of the NAAWP.
Had I, for instance, studied whether most
Southerners wanted to be Democrats, and found
that they did, would this necessarily make me a
Democrat, or anti-Republican?
Likewise, merely because I suggested thai
perhaps more study should be made into the
segregation problem in the South before extreme
measures were taken to enforce immediate in
tegration, doesn't mean that 1 am against orderly
integration.
When you are able to separate principles from
personalities, then perhaps you will be qualified
to call yourself an "editor."
To make it so clear that even you and other
Hoenigs can understand, I will repeat my thesis
again in the simplest terms.
1 did not, say that I was against orderly inte
gration. I am not against integration, per se.
I). <;. Cromwell
Editor's Note:
• We did not infer the letter writer was a bigot
ist; we said his remarks expressed a view wrong
fully held among bigoted Southerners, using
them as an excuse for continuing segregation.
The writer seemed to be merely echoing those
views as he heard them in his "personal study"
of the South.
• Mr. Hoenig's allegations may or may not l>e
immature, but they are those of one of our read
ers who is as free to express them as Mr. Crom
well is to express his views.
• We never said that the writer was against
integration; we said his conclusions concerning
the problem were incorrect.
• We do not know Mr. Cromwell personally,
only through ins letters, and can hardly be ac
cused of commenting on personalities. It is prin
ciples, the principle of an America free f<#r all
races, that, we have been commenting upon.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Cromwell speaks of gradual integration.
If, 93 years after the Emancipation Proclamation,
a student is not allowed to go to a certain school
because of her race, it seems that this progress
of gradual integration has stopped.
Since Mr. Cromwell is for integration in the
long run, what steps does he recommend be
taken? Needless to say, if the Southerners know
that mob action will stop integration, they will
continue to use it whenever necessary; but if the
state governments and the schools support inte
gration, the mob action will become ineffective.
Scott Bowersock
Age of Action
Editor, The Daily:
On paper, "gradual integration" is a fine con
cept. So, too, is the idea of "educating" the South
erner so that he will in the end realize what a
damn fool he has been for 200 years. But words
are merely words, and we are living in an age
of action.

What is at the bottom of the Southerner's)
desire for segregation? In every argument I
have ever heard, the basis lies in one of two
notions. Either there is some deep-seated idea of |
his own white supremacy, or a more realistic j
belief that his economic position would be in I
jured by an extension of equal civil rights to I
Negroes- a belief that he justifies by referring
to the survival-of-the-fittest biological and eco- j
nomic theory.
In the first case, no amount of talk or "cdu- j
cation" is going to do any-good. I can still hear!
the unmistakable drawl which, after one week j
ol sociology lecturing and one period of rather
well-substantiated discussion on the subject, dog-1
gedly maintains, "Wall, 1 still think they're dif
ferent."
I realize that one week of sociology is not one
hundred years of social progress, but no amount
of education will change, or even enter, a closed
mind.
In the second case, even if we accept the
social doctrine of survival of the fittest (which
is highly questionable in civilized society), there
is still a logical contradiction in this argument.
Whereas the so-called rational Southerner justi
fies his use of force in keeping the Negro "in ,
his place" by reference to this doctrine, he 1
changes his theory when "the fittest" are other }
than himself. He doesn't want anything "rammed
down his throat."
It was David Hume who said, "Facts alone I
will never sway us." The idea that, the Southerner
can be educated out of his bigoted views is un
realistic. Every concession toward equality that i
the Negro has won in the 90-odd years since he 1
was given his "freedom" has been forced.
People learn to accept new conditions after
they are in existence, not before. Of course, the
forces with which the Negro works have been
restricted to the law courts and economic pres
sures. These, as opposed to the forces used by
the "responsible" Southerner- -chains, ropes, mob
violence and, now, rotten eggs.
Before I am called down for "name-calling," !
let me qualify my generalities. By "Southerner"
I mean that group of Southern whites who, by
their' bigotry, prejudice, blindness, lack of educa
tion and narrow-mindedness, have set themselves I
up as a "supreme" race and managed to keep
the Negro in literal subjugation for almost a
century while slavery was prohibited by law.
It would seem that when one behaves in a
bigoted, prejudicial, blind, uneducated and nar-I
row-minded fashion, another is justified in call- j
ing him bigoted, prejudiced, blind, uneducated
and narrow-minded.
I would include in this generalized concept of 1
"Southerner" those who behave in such a fashion 5
but who, unhappily, have not located themselves i
in that great American ghetto known as the
"Deep South." I would not include those many !
residents of Southern states who hold more rea
sonable views but who, unhappily, are not among I
the "responsible leaders."
Any amount of talk, education or so-called j
progress will be wasted on that closed-minded I
individual whose answer to democracy is the
filibuster and mob violence. The Federal courts I
have finally taken a stand, at the insistence and j
constant prodding of the NAACP, against South
ern-type democracy. It is about time.

Editor, The Daily:
Since the publication of my letter Friday, I
have been subjected in "your" Daily to insults
and insinuations all the way from your inference
that 1 was a bigotist to freshman Jim Hoenig's
immature allegation that I was another Talmadge
or a member of the NAAWP.
Had I, for instance, studied whether most
Southerners wanted to be Democrats, and found
that they did, would this necessarily make me a
Democrat, or anti-Republican?
Likewise, merely because I suggested thai
perhaps more study should be made into the
segregation problem in the South before extreme
measures were taken to enforce immediate in
tegration, doesn't mean that 1 am against orderly
integration.
When you are able to separate principles from
personalities, then perhaps you will be qualified
to call yourself an "editor."
To make it so clear that even you and other
Hoenigs can understand, I will repeat my thesis
again in the simplest terms.

gration. I am not against integration, per se.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Cromwell speaks of gradual integration.
If, 93 years after the Emancipation Proclamation,
a student is not allowed to go to a certain school
because of her race, it seems that this progress
of gradual integration has stopped.
Since Mr. Cromwell is for integration in the
long run, what steps does he recommend be
taken? Needless to say, if the Southerners know
that mob action will stop integration, they will
continue to use it whenever necessary; but if the
state governments and the schools support inte
gration, the mob action will become ineffective.
Scott Bowersock
Age of Action
Editor, The Daily:
On paper, "gradual integration" is a fine con
cept. So, too, is the idea of "educating" the South
erner so that he will in the end realize what a
damn fool he has been for 200 years. But words
are merely words, and we are living in an age
of action.

What is at the bottom of the Southerner's)
desire for segregation? In every argument I
have ever heard, the basis lies in one of two
notions. Either there is some deep-seated idea of |
his own white supremacy, or a more realistic j
belief that his economic position would be in I
jured by an extension of equal civil rights to I
Negroes- a belief that he justifies by referring
to the survival-of-the-fittest biological and eco- j
nomic theory.
In the first case, no amount of talk or "cdu- j
cation" is going to do any-good. I can still hear!
the unmistakable drawl which, after one week j
ol sociology lecturing and one period of rather
well-substantiated discussion on the subject, dog-1
gedly maintains, "Wall, 1 still think they're dif
ferent."
I realize that one week of sociology is not one
hundred years of social progress, but no amount
of education will change, or even enter, a closed
mind.
In the second case, even if we accept the
social doctrine of survival of the fittest (which
is highly questionable in civilized society), there
is still a logical contradiction in this argument.
Whereas the so-called rational Southerner justi
fies his use of force in keeping the Negro "in ,
his place" by reference to this doctrine, he 1
changes his theory when "the fittest" are other }
than himself. He doesn't want anything "rammed
down his throat."
It was David Hume who said, "Facts alone I
will never sway us." The idea that, the Southerner
can be educated out of his bigoted views is un
realistic. Every concession toward equality that i
the Negro has won in the 90-odd years since he 1
was given his "freedom" has been forced.
People learn to accept new conditions after
they are in existence, not before. Of course, the
forces with which the Negro works have been
restricted to the law courts and economic pres
sures. These, as opposed to the forces used by
the "responsible" Southerner- -chains, ropes, mob
violence and, now, rotten eggs.
Before I am called down for "name-calling," !
let me qualify my generalities. By "Southerner"
I mean that group of Southern whites who, by
their' bigotry, prejudice, blindness, lack of educa
tion and narrow-mindedness, have set themselves I
up as a "supreme" race and managed to keep
the Negro in literal subjugation for almost a
century while slavery was prohibited by law.
It would seem that when one behaves in a
bigoted, prejudicial, blind, uneducated and nar-I
row-minded fashion, another is justified in call- j
ing him bigoted, prejudiced, blind, uneducated
and narrow-minded.
I would include in this generalized concept of 1
"Southerner" those who behave in such a fashion 5
but who, unhappily, have not located themselves i
in that great American ghetto known as the
"Deep South." I would not include those many !
residents of Southern states who hold more rea
sonable views but who, unhappily, are not among I
the "responsible leaders."
Any amount of talk, education or so-called j
progress will be wasted on that closed-minded I
individual whose answer to democracy is the
filibuster and mob violence. The Federal courts I
have finally taken a stand, at the insistence and j
constant prodding of the NAACP, against South
ern-type democracy. It is about time.

Editor, The Daily:
Since the publication of my letter Friday, I
have been subjected in "your" Daily to insults
and insinuations all the way from your inference
that 1 was a bigotist to freshman Jim Hoenig's
immature allegation that I was another Talmadge
or a member of the NAAWP.
Had I, for instance, studied whether most
Southerners wanted to be Democrats, and found
that they did, would this necessarily make me a
Democrat, or anti-Republican?
Likewise, merely because I suggested thai
perhaps more study should be made into the
segregation problem in the South before extreme
measures were taken to enforce immediate in
tegration, doesn't mean that 1 am against orderly
integration.
When you are able to separate principles from
personalities, then perhaps you will be qualified
to call yourself an "editor."
To make it so clear that even you and other
Hoenigs can understand, I will repeat my thesis
again in the simplest terms.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Cromwell speaks of gradual integration.
If, 93 years after the Emancipation Proclamation,
a student is not allowed to go to a certain school
because of her race, it seems that this progress
of gradual integration has stopped.
Since Mr. Cromwell is for integration in the
long run, what steps does he recommend be
taken? Needless to say, if the Southerners know
that mob action will stop integration, they will
continue to use it whenever necessary; but if the
state governments and the schools support inte
gration, the mob action will become ineffective.
Scott Bowersock
Age of Action
Editor, The Daily:
On paper, "gradual integration" is a fine con
cept. So, too, is the idea of "educating" the South
erner so that he will in the end realize what a
damn fool he has been for 200 years. But words
are merely words, and we are living in an age
of action.

What is at the bottom of the Southerner's)
desire for segregation? In every argument I
have ever heard, the basis lies in one of two
notions. Either there is some deep-seated idea of |
his own white supremacy, or a more realistic j
belief that his economic position would be in I
jured by an extension of equal civil rights to I
Negroes- a belief that he justifies by referring
to the survival-of-the-fittest biological and eco- j
nomic theory.
In the first case, no amount of talk or "cdu- j
cation" is going to do any-good. I can still hear!
the unmistakable drawl which, after one week j
ol sociology lecturing and one period of rather
well-substantiated discussion on the subject, dog-1
gedly maintains, "Wall, 1 still think they're dif
ferent."
I realize that one week of sociology is not one
hundred years of social progress, but no amount
of education will change, or even enter, a closed
mind.
In the second case, even if we accept the
social doctrine of survival of the fittest (which
is highly questionable in civilized society), there
is still a logical contradiction in this argument.
Whereas the so-called rational Southerner justi
fies his use of force in keeping the Negro "in ,
his place" by reference to this doctrine, he 1
changes his theory when "the fittest" are other }
than himself. He doesn't want anything "rammed
down his throat."
It was David Hume who said, "Facts alone I
will never sway us." The idea that, the Southerner
can be educated out of his bigoted views is un
realistic. Every concession toward equality that i
the Negro has won in the 90-odd years since he 1
was given his "freedom" has been forced.
People learn to accept new conditions after
they are in existence, not before. Of course, the
forces with which the Negro works have been
restricted to the law courts and economic pres
sures. These, as opposed to the forces used by
the "responsible" Southerner- -chains, ropes, mob
violence and, now, rotten eggs.
Before I am called down for "name-calling," !
let me qualify my generalities. By "Southerner"
I mean that group of Southern whites who, by
their' bigotry, prejudice, blindness, lack of educa
tion and narrow-mindedness, have set themselves I
up as a "supreme" race and managed to keep
the Negro in literal subjugation for almost a
century while slavery was prohibited by law.
It would seem that when one behaves in a
bigoted, prejudicial, blind, uneducated and nar-I
row-minded fashion, another is justified in call- j
ing him bigoted, prejudiced, blind, uneducated
and narrow-minded.
I would include in this generalized concept of 1
"Southerner" those who behave in such a fashion 5
but who, unhappily, have not located themselves i
in that great American ghetto known as the
"Deep South." I would not include those many !
residents of Southern states who hold more rea
sonable views but who, unhappily, are not among I
the "responsible leaders."
Any amount of talk, education or so-called j
progress will be wasted on that closed-minded I
individual whose answer to democracy is the
filibuster and mob violence. The Federal courts I
have finally taken a stand, at the insistence and j
constant prodding of the NAACP, against South

individual whose answer to democracy is the
filibuster and mob violence. The Federal courts I
have finally taken a stand, at the insistence and j
constant prodding of the NAACP, against South
ern-type democracy. It is about time.
