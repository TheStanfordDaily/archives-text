### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (UPJ
The United States opened a
world-wide investigation today
into reports that Donald Mar-
Lean, Britain's turncoat diplomat,
may have received secret Ameri
can documents from the U. S. em
bassy in Cairo in 19.30,
The reports, involving a myste
rious coded letter that Mac Lean
is supposed to have left in Cairo
when he departed hurriedly for
London, was published by some
British newspapers and in a copy
righted story in the New York
Herald Tribune.
The British Foreign Office in
London denied the existence of
any such letter to Mac Lean. It
said "a letter was found written
from an address in the United
States to a'third person, clearly
not Mac Lean."
Despite the British announce
ment, Administration sources said
the United States would continue
with its investigation to see
whether any U. S. employes were
involved with Mac Lean "in any
way."
