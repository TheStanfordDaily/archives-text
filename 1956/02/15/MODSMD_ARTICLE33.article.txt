## Huge Bruin Averages 23.8 Points a Game; Selleck Paces Cards 
###

huge but surprisingly agile center,
dominates Pacific Coast Confer
ence statistics released yesterday

game and percentage of rebounds.

ming home (51 points in two
games against Stanford. The 6-5,
220-pound Bruin now has 190
points in eight games for a 23.8
average.

Bill Bond and Barry Brown are
eighth and 12th with 142 and 119
points.

1 Taft. Taft, Bruin jump shot sen
, sation, was held to six points by
| Stanford last Friday and only to
taled 30 in the series.
Despite his below-average per
formance, Taft is still the only
other conference player to aver
age more than 20 points a game.
He has averaged 21.8 in eight
games.
Selleek also holds the Stanford
leadership in this category with
an average of 15.7 points a game.
| The Indians' little star ranks sixth
in the PCC.
Percentage Lead
Although Naulls trails Wash
| ington's .Jim Coshow in the total
I number of rebounds, the Bruin
pivot man is way out in front on
a percentage basis.
Naulls has controlled 123 of a
possible 722 rebounds for UCLA
—or 17 per cent.
C osho w has rebounded 134
times for the Huskies, but. be-
I cause he had 902 opportunities,
his percentage is 14.8.
Stanford's Brown is fifth in
| both total rebounds and percent
i age with 101 rebounds for 12.2
j per cent. He is the only Indian in
the conference's top 15.
Other individual conference sta
tistics include:
• Stanford's Gary Van Galder
I leads in field goal accuracy with
a 50 per cent record 20 buckets
in 40 tries.
• Taft has hit on 46 per cent of
his field goal attempts. Naulls on
41, Selleek on 40.
• Bond is Stanford's most accu
rate man from the free throw
line, sinking 46 of 63 charity toss
es for 73 per cent.

Dominates the PCC
Whee Willie Naulls, UCLA's
huge but surprisingly agile center,
dominates Pacific Coast Confer
ence statistics released yesterday
just as he dominated the Bruin-
Indian basketball games in the
Pavilion last weekend.
Naulls is pacing the PCC in
total points, average points per
game and percentage of rebounds.
Naulls surged into the confer
ence scoring leadership by ram
ming home (51 points in two
games against Stanford. The 6-5,
220-pound Bruin now has 190
points in eight games for a 23.8
average.
Oregon State's Dave Gambee,
last week's scoring leader, trails
Naulls by seven with 183 points.
Bruno Boin of Washington and
Morris Taft of UCLA are next
with 180 and 174 points, respec
tively.
George Selleek, Stanford's high
scorer, ranks fifth in the confer
ence with 157 points. Stanford's
Bill Bond and Barry Brown are
eighth and 12th with 142 and 119
points.
Taft Ousted
In taking over the top rung in
the average-points-a-game depart-
I ment, Naulls ousted his teammate
1 Taft. Taft, Bruin jump shot sen
, sation, was held to six points by
| Stanford last Friday and only to
taled 30 in the series.
Despite his below-average per
formance, Taft is still the only
other conference player to aver
age more than 20 points a game.
He has averaged 21.8 in eight
games.
Selleek also holds the Stanford
leadership in this category with
an average of 15.7 points a game.
