# SRI Will Occupy Village 310, Residents to Fill Other Dorms
## 
### 
Residents of one of the Stanford Village men's dormitories are being
moved this week to adjoining buildings, according to Dr. John Yar
borough, director of the Village and all University residences.
The move is necessary to consolidate the dwindling Village popula
tion, explained Dr. Yarborough. Building 310, the dorm being vacated,

had only 21 residents in space
for 50.
Buildings 306 and 308, which
will 'accommodate 310's former
residents, also had many vacan
cies. The present residents of 306
and 308 are not being reshuffled
by the addition of 310's students.
Room assignments for former
310' residents will be the same
type as in 306 and 308. That is,
students from doubles will be
moved to doubles.
Building 310 will be turned over
to its owner. Stanford Research
Institute, as soon as all rooms are
vacated. It is expected that 310
will be empty by the end of this
week.
In the consolidation program,
Buildings 314 and 316 were turn
ed over to SRI at the beginning
of winter quarter. Further Village
residential changes are anticipat
ed for spring quarter, added Dr.
Yarborough.
