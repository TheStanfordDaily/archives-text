### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (UP)
â€”The State Department warned
today that the Western allies will
have to act on their own to keep
peace in the Middle East if Russia
"paralyzes" the United Nations.
The statement followed Rus
sia's declaration last night that
the Kremlin would regard send
ing of troops to the Mid-East with
out UN sanction a "flagrant" vio
lation of the UN charter and a
"threat" to peace.
U.S. Officials
United States officials said the
Western allies are not now con
sidering sending troops into the
Middle East. Such a step would
be given urgent consideration,
however, if large-scale hostilities
broke out between Israel and its
Arab neighbors.
State Department spokesman
Lincoln White said the United
States, Britain and France "wish
to work through the UN to the
maximum degree possible" in
their efforts to preserve peace in
the Middle East.
Soviet Veto
"Should, however, the United
Nations be paralyzed as it has in
the past by the Soviet veto, there
would be no alternative but to
work outside the United Nations
in our continuing efforts to as
sure a just peace .in the area,"
White said.
Sen. Walter F. George (D-Ga.),
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, declared to
day that "if we become involved
in war in the Middle East, Russia
is stepping in.
"That would be the excuse she
has been looking for," he told
newsmen.
