# LASSU Holds Vote on IFC Judicial Body
## Houses to Present Plan To Delineate Function 
### Helen Dewar 
Legislature voted last night to
delay decision on tho status of the
Interfraternity judicial council
pending approval by IFC of a
plan to clarify the relationship
between the IFC judicial body and
Judicial Council.
Bob Gable, spokesman for the
IFC and Men's Council group
drawing up the recommendation,
specified that their plan would
not represent a constitutional
change, but merely a clarification
as to which of the IFC council's
decisions are appealable to Judi
cial Council.
Under the proposed plan, IFC
judicial council would have ini
tial jurisdiction over all cases in
volving fraternities and would
have final jurisdiction over cases
involving an IFC rule, but not in
volving a University-wide ruling.
Any case decided by the IFC
body, but falling under the Fun
damental Standard, would be ap
pealable to Judicial Council.
Referendum
If IFC approves the plan, it will
be submitted immediately to Leg
islature to either accept or sub
mit to a student referendum Feb.
28 and 29. (Stanford's member
ship in the National Students As
sociation will also be decided in
the referendum.)
If IFC does not approve the
plan. Gable said that the initiating
group plans to submit the pro
posal to Legislature along with
300 signatures demanding a ref
erendum, thereby making refer
endum on the issue mandatory.
ASSU President George Ralph
informed Legislature earlier in
the evening that he had sent the
following letter of commendation
to the University of Alabama stu
dent legislature:
"The student legislature of
Stanford University wishes to
commend your student leaders
who condemned the riots over the
admission of Miss Lucy to your
university.
"We realize the peculiar na
ture of the problem among South
ern schools and appreciate the at
tempts of students to overcome it.
"VVe are especially anxious that
American college students work
toward establishing in practice
the equality which has theoreti
cally l>een offered to our citizens
for so long, since the role of the
United States in international af
fairs will be dependent on our in
ternal stability as manifested to
other nations."
The body also heard four rec
ommendations of the Traffic
Committee, passing three and de
feating a fourth.

which will be passed on to the
Administration are:

Road running behind Memorial
Church be open to faculty reserv
ed parking.
• and that an outlet be made
for the Rranner parking lot.
