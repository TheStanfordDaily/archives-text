midnight to sign or veto the meas

I Press Mr. Eisenhower favored the
! gas bill before Iho Case incident
I arose, and had it not occurred
i"the bill would have been signed
j by now."
| Sen. George D. Aiken (R-Vt.)
also said the President may veto

j the Case affairs. Aiken said this
was a "50-50" chance. He said he
based his statement on his knowl
edge of Mr. Eisenhower, not on
| any private information.
The bill, passed by both houses i
of Congress, would exempt inde-1
I pendent natural gas producers
| from direct Federal price regula
tion.
