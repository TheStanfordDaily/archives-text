THOMASVILLE, Gaâ€ž Feb. lo
(UP) President Elsenhower flew
to Georgia today to ponder his
second-term decision. Hp is ex
pected to stay at the plantation
(if Treasury Secretary George M.
Humphrey a week or 10 days.
The Humphrey plantation is
aptly named "Milestone" for it is
there Mr. Eisenhower will proba
bly make one of the momentous
decisions of his career whether
to seek a second Republican nom
ination for President, accept a
draft for the role, or retire.
Mr. Eisenhower earlier was ex
pected to withhold the announce
ment of his decision until he re
turns to Washington toward the
end of this month. He has tenta
tively promised to make it known
before March 1.
But with the favorable medical
report speculation arose that the
decision might be more
quickly and possibly announced
by the President from his Georgia
retreat.
