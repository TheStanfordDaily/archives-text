### 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala., Feb. 15
i UP i Charges of attempted mur
der were Xiled tonight against two
Negro brothers accused of hid
ing up a University of Alabama
freshman in retaliation for riots
protesting the enrollment oi a
Negro coed, Autherine Lucy
A reliable source said the pair
had been moved to another .jail
for "safe keeping."
County authorities said charges
against the pair had been changed
from assault and battery and dis
orderly conduct to attempted mur
der.
An informed source said the
two brothers, John and Arthur
Washington, were moved to the
Greene county jail at Eutaw, 31
miles away, for their "safe keep
ing."
It was presumed the move was
taken to prevent further demon
strations protesting entrance of
Negro students to the university.
The Negroes were charged with
attacking Samuel P. Taylor early
last night in a Negro residential
area as he walked from the cam
pus to his room in a converted
barracks. A third Negro, Jimmy
Hall, was held as a material wit
ness.
"No Reason"
Arthur, reported to be a soldier
home on leave, told police the
Negroes "had no reason" for the
attack "except to get even for the
way they | Alabama students) had
treated Miss Lucy," the school's
first Negro student.
Police Chief W. C. Tompkins
and univerity officials conferred
this afternoon, presumably about
the incident, which occurred in a
Negro residential district.
Taylor, who was only bruised,
said he was walking to his apart
ment, a converted barracks area,
when the three Negroes ap
proached him. Taylor quoted one
of them as saying, "You know
what happened up there?"
Denies in Riot
Assuming they meant the riots
which resulted in the school ex
cluding Miss Lucy, Taylor said he
told them, "I wasn't in it."
The student said one took him
by the arm and Jed him to a near
by house. There, he said, one Ne
gro held him while the other kick
ed him.
The campus was quiet with
Miss Lucy secluded in a secret
hideaway near Birmingham. She
took refuge there for a "complete
rest" following telephone threats
received at her first hideout, also
near here.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala., Feb. 15
i UP i Charges of attempted mur
der were Xiled tonight against two
Negro brothers accused of hid
ing up a University of Alabama
freshman in retaliation for riots
protesting the enrollment oi a
Negro coed, Autherine Lucy
A reliable source said the pair
had been moved to another .jail
for "safe keeping."
County authorities said charges
against the pair had been changed
from assault and battery and dis
orderly conduct to attempted mur
der.
An informed source said the
two brothers, John and Arthur
Washington, were moved to the
Greene county jail at Eutaw, 31
miles away, for their "safe keep
ing."
It was presumed the move was
taken to prevent further demon
strations protesting entrance of
Negro students to the university.
The Negroes were charged with
attacking Samuel P. Taylor early
last night in a Negro residential
area as he walked from the cam
pus to his room in a converted
barracks. A third Negro, Jimmy
Hall, was held as a material wit
ness.
"No Reason"
Arthur, reported to be a soldier
home on leave, told police the
Negroes "had no reason" for the
attack "except to get even for the
way they | Alabama students) had
treated Miss Lucy," the school's
first Negro student.
Police Chief W. C. Tompkins
and univerity officials conferred
this afternoon, presumably about
the incident, which occurred in a
Negro residential district.
Taylor, who was only bruised,
said he was walking to his apart
ment, a converted barracks area,
when the three Negroes ap
proached him. Taylor quoted one
of them as saying, "You know
what happened up there?"
Denies in Riot
Assuming they meant the riots
which resulted in the school ex
cluding Miss Lucy, Taylor said he
told them, "I wasn't in it."
The student said one took him
by the arm and Jed him to a near
by house. There, he said, one Ne
gro held him while the other kick
ed him.
The campus was quiet with
Miss Lucy secluded in a secret
hideaway near Birmingham. She
took refuge there for a "complete
rest" following telephone threats
received at her first hideout, also
near here.
