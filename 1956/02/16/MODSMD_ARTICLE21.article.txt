# Stanford vs. USF?
## 
### 
Basketball /ans in tie San Francisco Buy
Area are fortunate; they have the national
championship basketball team, that of the I di
versity of San Francisco. The fans on the I'e
nirisulu are equally lucky: they ha\e lhe
Stanford basketball team, one of the nation's
best.
Within the space of 3.) miles two of the best
teams in the country are playing and yet these
two teams are not scheduled lo compete against
each other this season.
For lhe sportsman ihis is a poor situation,
hut certainly one which can be remedied.
There is really no reason for lhe two teams
not getting together on the court. We are cer
tain both teams would welcome lhe game. Fans
ail over lhe area surely would welcome the
battle.
I hen what's stopping it?
The main problem appears to be that IJSF
wants to play in its own back yard.
I.ast basketball season the Stanford-USF sc
ries was held in San Francisco's (low Palace, be
fore a record-breaking crowd. This may have
been an ideal location from the standpoint of
I SF students and San Francisco fans hul w hat
of lhe other parties involved, the Stanford stu
dent and the Peninsula fan?
They were forced fo drive 35 miles lo lhe
game, struggling through Peninsula traffic. That
was fine last year, but what of this year?

Mont athletic rivalries are operated on a
"home-and-home"' basis: one year at one team's
home grounds, one year al lhe other's school.
We realize this only applies to a p re-scheduled
content, hut its basic theory should still apply
in the ease of a Stanford-USF game this year.
Technically the game would 110! have heen
pre-scheduled: actually it would amount to the
same thing.
It would only he fair that Stanford students
who traveled to San Francisco last season for
the I SF games should now he treated to the
same opportunity that USF students had for
those contests: to see the game at home.
I his is, of course, mere conjecture. No Stan
ford-1 SF game has heen scheduled. And from
what we can hear, the chances for one are none
100 hopeful.
Hut plans should he hopeful. The fans want
the game ami the players want it. We helieve
that is what basketball is played for: for the
benefit of fans and players.
And in all fairness it should he played here,
at Stanford.
We do feel that the University of San Fran
cisco is indeed the national champion in bas
ketball, hut we will never be certain until they
have tested themselves against the Stanford In
dians, whom we consider a pretty fair country
team.
Are you listening, (JSF? This is a challenge.

Basketball /ans in tie San Francisco Buy
Area are fortunate; they have the national
championship basketball team, that of the I di
versity of San Francisco. The fans on the I'e
nirisulu are equally lucky: they ha\e lhe
Stanford basketball team, one of the nation's
best.
Within the space of 3.) miles two of the best
teams in the country are playing and yet these
two teams are not scheduled lo compete against
each other this season.
For lhe sportsman ihis is a poor situation,
hut certainly one which can be remedied.
There is really no reason for lhe two teams
not getting together on the court. We are cer
tain both teams would welcome lhe game. Fans
ail over lhe area surely would welcome the
battle.
I hen what's stopping it?
The main problem appears to be that IJSF
wants to play in its own back yard.
I.ast basketball season the Stanford-USF sc
ries was held in San Francisco's (low Palace, be
fore a record-breaking crowd. This may have
been an ideal location from the standpoint of
I SF students and San Francisco fans hul w hat
of lhe other parties involved, the Stanford stu
dent and the Peninsula fan?
They were forced fo drive 35 miles lo lhe
game, struggling through Peninsula traffic. That
was fine last year, but what of this year?

Mont athletic rivalries are operated on a
"home-and-home"' basis: one year at one team's
home grounds, one year al lhe other's school.
We realize this only applies to a p re-scheduled
content, hut its basic theory should still apply
in the ease of a Stanford-USF game this year.
Technically the game would 110! have heen
pre-scheduled: actually it would amount to the
same thing.
It would only he fair that Stanford students
who traveled to San Francisco last season for
the I SF games should now he treated to the
same opportunity that USF students had for
those contests: to see the game at home.
I his is, of course, mere conjecture. No Stan
ford-1 SF game has heen scheduled. And from
what we can hear, the chances for one are none
100 hopeful.
Hut plans should he hopeful. The fans want
the game ami the players want it. We helieve
that is what basketball is played for: for the
benefit of fans and players.
And in all fairness it should he played here,
at Stanford.
We do feel that the University of San Fran
cisco is indeed the national champion in bas
ketball, hut we will never be certain until they
have tested themselves against the Stanford In
dians, whom we consider a pretty fair country
team.
