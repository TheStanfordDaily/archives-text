## Students View New Liberal Arts Emphasis in Undergraduate Plan 
### Dave Scott 
"Do you believe the increa«ed liberal arts
emphasis in the new undergraduate study will
be of greater benefit to the student in his future
life than the present plan?"
Here's what some students think:
PAUL Wampnf.R, \ r >B, Stern: "The broader
liberal arts education will certainly lead to a
more well-rounded personality in the gradu
ated students, but the question arises as to
whether the science and engineering majors,
already burdened with heavy schedules, will
ever graduate."'
Fred Carlisle, '58, El Capitan: "1 am not in
favor of the increased lab-science requirement.
The present 15-unit requirement is quite suffi
cient for students not contemplating a major
in a scientific field.
"In \iew of the entrance requirements for
science, 1 feel that li> units is more than enough
to have to endure at Stanford for a person
whose major does not concern it."
Judy \ ouno, '59, Roble: "In this modern
world we need a firm foundation on which to
base our livee. 1 think that this added empha
sis on liberal arts at St uiford will aid students
in establishing that foundation."
Bkv Stanaway, *st, Lagunita: ' 1 think it's
a definite improvement. A student should be
112 ree to choose a varied program to broaden his
interests and outlook."
Glenn Dußosk, '57, Stern: "Yes. For the
person who is not sure of his vocational goal,
this broad background will definitely be of aid
to him in choosing his life's work. And for the

person who has decided, a certain portion of
his study removed from his particular field will
be of much 'cultural' value."
Ijnda Soi.ter, T>B, [,agunita: "If one goes
into a profession, college is probably the only
place he will get at It ast a taste of liberal arts;
and for those who are undecided it will give
an opportunity for a wider choice and intro
duce him to some unknown fields."
\ alerie Williams, '59, Roble: "The world
today is becoming increasingly specialized. This
tends to create a departmental society with each
person having a special function. Although
specialization creates an all-over efficiency us in
a machine, integration between the [tarts suf
fers or lacks completely.
"Society today is superficially efficient and
organized. But people, the integral parts of
society, lack integration. The increased empha
sis on liberal arts in the proposed undergradu
ate study change is a positive action to produce
a well-rounded, integrated society."
Janice Johnson, ";">B, Lagunita: "The new
undergrad plan w ill benefit the students if they
wish a more liberal education than Stanford
now offers.
"I hope the University doesn't go to the ex
treme in any further actions, penalizing stu
dents who are confined to four years of college
and keeping them from specializing in a world
that constantly demands more specialists in ev
ery field. I feel fortunate not to he a freshman
next fall."

What do YOU think?
"Do you believe the increa«ed liberal arts
emphasis in the new undergraduate study will
be of greater benefit to the student in his future
life than the present plan?"
Here's what some students think:
PAUL Wampnf.R, \ r >B, Stern: "The broader
liberal arts education will certainly lead to a
more well-rounded personality in the gradu
ated students, but the question arises as to
whether the science and engineering majors,
already burdened with heavy schedules, will
ever graduate."'
Fred Carlisle, '58, El Capitan: "1 am not in
favor of the increased lab-science requirement.
The present 15-unit requirement is quite suffi
cient for students not contemplating a major
in a scientific field.
"In \iew of the entrance requirements for
science, 1 feel that li> units is more than enough
to have to endure at Stanford for a person
whose major does not concern it."
Judy \ ouno, '59, Roble: "In this modern
world we need a firm foundation on which to
base our livee. 1 think that this added empha
sis on liberal arts at St uiford will aid students
in establishing that foundation."
Bkv Stanaway, *st, Lagunita: ' 1 think it's
a definite improvement. A student should be
112 ree to choose a varied program to broaden his
interests and outlook."
Glenn Dußosk, '57, Stern: "Yes. For the
person who is not sure of his vocational goal,
this broad background will definitely be of aid
to him in choosing his life's work. And for the

person who has decided, a certain portion of
his study removed from his particular field will
be of much 'cultural' value."
