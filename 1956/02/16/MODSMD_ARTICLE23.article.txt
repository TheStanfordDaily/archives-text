On Foreign Critics
Editor, The Daily:
Several pertinent issues have arisen, directly
or otherwise, in your columns during the past
two weeks. I should like to comment on two of
them.
First, there is the criticism of foreign students
on our racial problems. We should welcome all
criticisms and especially those of foreign guests
who have had the opportunity of seeing our coun
try from the outside.
Although their views may not be particularly
objective, they do represent an aspect of foreign
opinion, something which is extremely important
to certain individuals who, in this day and age,
consider prestige more important than principle.
For the reader's benefit, I should like to point
out that some criticism from abroad has a ten
dency to overlook, if not ignore, the beneficial
aspects of our country and yet to bring our faults
into sharp focus.
As I have previously stated, criticism should
be welcomed; and yet it does seem a pity lhat
such great quantities are used for export rather
than home consumption.

Apart from our Russian friends, a great pro
ducer of this commodity would seem to be the
Republic of India, which since 1948 has preached
and aspired to democracy and yet whose acutely
unequal distribution of wealth and whose com
plex system of caste and untouchables exists to
this day.
It is 1o our advantage to welcome criticism,
for it tells us our faults; and I hope that our for
eign guests will benefit, also so that, on return
home, they may apply themselves to problems
(perhaps more acute than ours) in their own
countries with increased vigor.
The second issue on which I should like to
comment is this:
In America we are again encountering the
problems incurred by racial differences. It is our
obligation as Americans to deal with these prob
lems in whichever way we see fit. I am sure we
would object most vehemently if the United
Nations voted to intervene.
I trust that we will hold this in mind when, in
the present or the future, olher countries en
counter these problems.
