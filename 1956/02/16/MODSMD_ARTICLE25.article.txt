# New Undergrad Study Plan To Bring Radical Changes
## Entrance, Lower Division, B.A. Degree Candidate Requirements to Be Affected 
### Mary Ellen Romney 
Editor's Note: This is (lie first of two articles which will deal
with the new undergraduate program passed last week by the
University Academic Council on recommendation of the Study of
Undergraduate Education. Tomorrow: The new A.B. require
ments; how the four-year plan works; and new adviser plans.

Last week the Stanford Academic Council approved a series of
recommendations submitted by a group of faculty committees.
By approving these recommendations the council radically changed
Stanford's undergraduate academic structure.

the council is the final step before !
I the new program can be put into
effect. The plan carries its own
machinery for implementation—
formation of a Committee on Gen
eral Studies to supervise the en
tire undergraduate program.
In a sense, the General Studies'
Committee will replace the exist
ing Lower Division Committee
this spring, but its duties will also
be to evaluate and further im
prove the now four-year integrat
ed program.
Three Categories
The recommendations them
selves fall into three major cate
gories. First are changes in ad
mission requirements, applying,
to all enter ing freshmen. Second i
is the reorganization of the Lower-
Division requirements into an all-1
University four-year program.
The third set of recommendations |
applies only to candidates for the
Bachelor of Arls degree.
The committee raised admis-1
sion requirements to three years
of high school English, two years
of mathematics and two years of
any one foreign language.
It will be several years before
the new requirements for admis
sion will fully go into effect, since
schools all over the country must
be notified.
Requirements. Divided
All University requirements
have been divided into two sec
tions in the new plan. The first is
little changed: English. Western
Civilization and language • math
option requirements remain.
English will be a full-year
course covering both composition
and literature. No credit will be
given for' remedial English, and it
will be taught as a two-hour-per
week coaching session in conjune-!
tion with the regular course.
"At the present time a student :
may graduate from Stanford hav
! Ing little or no exposure to Eng
| lish or American literature as
such," stated Ihe committee. The
; revised program will attempt to
! arrange such an exposure through
'the third required quarter of
freshman English.
Second Section
The second section of the all-
University requirements is more
novel. It is subdivided into hu
i inanities, social sciences and natu
j raj sciences. The student must fill
! the requirements in the two areas
| in which he is not major ing.
Art,-architecture, music, speech
and drama, philosophy, religion
and literature courses fulfill the I
eight - unit humanities require
ment.
"Terminal" Courses
In the social sciences, a new
; series of five-unit terminal cours
es will he established in anthro-
I pology, economics, geography, po
j litical science and sociology, to
I correspond to the existing psy
chology 51 course.
This would enable the student
to take classes in more than one
field rather than spend 10 units
on a single subject.
The natural science require
ment is similar to the existing
plan, but courses in ROTC, hy
giene and psychology will no long
er qualify. While nine units is the
minimum here, more science is
required of A.B. degree candi
dates.
The remaining all-University re
quirement six quarters of physi
cal education may be extended
as the student wishes throughout
the four years.
For the remaining four quar
ters, such organized group activi
ties as choir, orchestra, blind and
dramatic performances may be
substituted.

given for' remedial English, and it
will be taught as a two-hour-per
week coaching session in conjune-!
tion with the regular course.
"At the present time a student :
may graduate from Stanford hav
! Ing little or no exposure to Eng
| lish or American literature as
such," stated Ihe committee. The
; revised program will attempt to
! arrange such an exposure through
'the third required quarter of
freshman English.
Second Section
The second section of the all-
University requirements is more
novel. It is subdivided into hu
i inanities, social sciences and natu
j raj sciences. The student must fill
! the requirements in the two areas
| in which he is not major ing.
Art,-architecture, music, speech
and drama, philosophy, religion
and literature courses fulfill the I
eight - unit humanities require
ment.
"Terminal" Courses
In the social sciences, a new
; series of five-unit terminal cours
es will he established in anthro-
I pology, economics, geography, po
j litical science and sociology, to
I correspond to the existing psy
chology 51 course.
This would enable the student
to take classes in more than one
field rather than spend 10 units
on a single subject.
The natural science require
ment is similar to the existing
plan, but courses in ROTC, hy
giene and psychology will no long
er qualify. While nine units is the
minimum here, more science is
required of A.B. degree candi
dates.
The remaining all-University re
quirement six quarters of physi
cal education may be extended
as the student wishes throughout
the four years.
For the remaining four quar
ters, such organized group activi
ties as choir, orchestra, blind and
dramatic performances may be
substituted.
Editor's Note: This is (lie first of two articles which will deal
with the new undergraduate program passed last week by the
University Academic Council on recommendation of the Study of
Undergraduate Education. Tomorrow: The new A.B. require
ments; how the four-year plan works; and new adviser plans.

Last week the Stanford Academic Council approved a series of
recommendations submitted by a group of faculty committees.
By approving these recommendations the council radically changed
Stanford's undergraduate academic structure.

the council is the final step before !
I the new program can be put into
effect. The plan carries its own
machinery for implementation—
formation of a Committee on Gen
eral Studies to supervise the en
tire undergraduate program.
In a sense, the General Studies'
Committee will replace the exist
ing Lower Division Committee
this spring, but its duties will also
be to evaluate and further im
prove the now four-year integrat
ed program.
Three Categories
The recommendations them
selves fall into three major cate
gories. First are changes in ad
mission requirements, applying,
to all enter ing freshmen. Second i
is the reorganization of the Lower-
Division requirements into an all-1
University four-year program.
The third set of recommendations |
applies only to candidates for the
Bachelor of Arls degree.
The committee raised admis-1
sion requirements to three years
of high school English, two years
of mathematics and two years of
any one foreign language.
It will be several years before
the new requirements for admis
sion will fully go into effect, since
schools all over the country must
be notified.
Requirements. Divided
All University requirements
have been divided into two sec
tions in the new plan. The first is
little changed: English. Western
Civilization and language • math
option requirements remain.
English will be a full-year
course covering both composition
and literature. No credit will be
given for' remedial English, and it
will be taught as a two-hour-per
week coaching session in conjune-!
tion with the regular course.
