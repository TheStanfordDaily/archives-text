## Started in By Dr. Samuel Cooper 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Stanford Medical School, 33
years older than the University,
has had its lips and downs since
its founding in 1858 as a part of
the old University of the Pacific,
now College ol Pacific.
Dr. Samuel Elias Cooper found
ed the school as a,commercial
venture. Cooper was asked to
leave his home town of Danville.
Illinois, wfcen he was accused of
grave-robbing to get bodies on
which to perform experiments.
He moved his operations to Cali
fornia.
He arrived in San Francisco in
1855 and became successful in the
medical profession. Cooper was
generally disliked in San Fran
cisco because he built his large
practice by advertising.

The medical school he founded
was accused of existing for the
primary purpose of making mon
ey. Soon after the school got
under way, Cooper was again ac
cused of body-snatching.
This time a newspaper said the
medical school was hiiing Chi
nese to wait for sick people to die
so they could get the bodies for
student work.
After Cooper died at 40 in 1862,
the school stayed together for
three years but was disbanded in
1865.

Dr. Levi Cooper Lane, who had
joined the faculty in 1861, took
some of the original faculty with
him and started his own medical
school in 1870. By 1882 the school
became known as Cooper College,
in honor of Dr. Samuel Cooper.
Lane Hospital, which is next
door to the college, was built in
1893-94. It is still the teaching hos
pital for Stanford Medical School.
Planned Library
Dr. Lane died in 1902, #nd a
controversy over the disposition
of his estate raged until 1907.
Lane had left his money to his
wife for establishing the greatest
medical library in the West.
She died before she could finish
his plan. She willed one-third of
her estate to the school, which
was all she could give by law.
The rest went to Dr. Lane's suc
cessor, Dr. C. N. Ellinwood.
The. faculty of the school main
tained that Mrs. Lane had intend
ed for all her estate to be used for
the library and the school. Ellin
wood said different. Apparently
he was able to legally back this
up because he kept nearly $600,-
000.
The remaining $200,000 of Mrs.
Lane's estate went to found Lane
Library, which became the finest
of its kind on the West Coast.
