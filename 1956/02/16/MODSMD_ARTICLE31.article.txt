THE CARE AND FEEDING OF ROOM-MATES
Today we take up room-mates, a delightful phenomenon of
American college life. Having a room-mate is not only heaps of
fun ; it is also very educational, for the proper study of matikind
is man, and there is no better way to learn the dreams and
drives of another human being than to share a room with him.
This being the case, it is wise not to keep the same room-mate
too long, because the more room-mates you have, the more you
will know about the dreams and drives of human beings. And
that's what we're all after, isn't it?
So try to change room-mates as often as you can. A recent
study made by Sigafoos of Michigan Slate shows that tne best
interval for changing room-mates is every four hours.
Now let us discuss how to go about choosing a room-mate. Most
counselors agree that the most important thing to look for in

room-mates is that they be
people of regular habits. This,
1 say, is arrant nonsense. What
if one of their regular habits
happens to be beating a great
gong from midnight to three
a.m.? Or growing cultures in
the tooth glass? Or reciting
the Articles of War? Or peanut
brittle?
Regular habits indeed! I say
that beyond quibble, far and
away the most important qual
ity in room-mates is that they
be exactly your size. Otherwise
you will have to have their
clothes altered to fit you, which
can be a considerable nuisance.
In fact, it is sometimes flatly
impossible. I recollect ope time
1 roomed with a man named
Tremblatt Osage who was just

under seven feet tall and weighed nearly four hundred pounds.
There wasn't a blessed thing 1 could use in his entire wardrobeâ€”
until one night when 1 was invited to a masquerade party. 1
cut one leg off a pair of Tremblatt's trousers, jumped into it,
sewed up both ends and went to the party as a bolster. (Inci
dentally, 1 took second prize. First prize went to a girl named
Antenna Wilkins who poured molasses over her hear! and went
as a candied apple.)
But I digress. Let us get back to the qualities that make de
sirable room-mates. Not the least of these is the cigarettes they

smoke. When we borrow cigarettes, do
we want them to be harsh, shoddy, and
disdainful of our palates? Certainly
not! What, then, do we want them to
be? Why, we want them to be gentle,
delicately-reared, and designed to suit
the-tempo of today's broader, easier
life! And what cigarette is gentle,
delicately-reared, and designed to suit
the tempo of today's broader, easier
life? Why, Philip Morris, of corris!
(I'll bet you knew it all the time!)
To go on. In selecting a room-mate,
take great pains to find someone who
will wear well, whom you'd like to keep
as a permanent friend. Many of his-
tory's great friendships first started in
college. Are you aware, for example,
of the remarkable fact that Johnson
and Boswell were room-mates at Ox-
ford in 1712? What makes this fact
so remarkable is that in 1712 Johnson ,
was only three years old and Boswell
had riot been born yet. But, of course,
children matured much earlier in those
days. Take Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
who wrote his first symphony at the

age of four. Or Titian, who painted his first masterpiece at five.
Or Hans Otto McGrath, who was in many ways the most remark
able of all; he was appointed chief of the Copenhagen police
department at the age of six!
(It must be admitted, however, that the appointment was less
than a success. Criminals roamed the city, robbing and looting
at will. They knew young McGrath would never pursue them;
he was not allowed to cross the street.) e.uai stiuiman. utr.a

invite you anil your room-mate to try today's neu>. gentle Philip Morris.
It's always Welcome !
