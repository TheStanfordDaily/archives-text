So the Bruins won two and <70 on (0 another major sports cham
pionship. liut the Stanford cagers threw two second-half scares into
the Woodenheads that they won't forget for a while. On Friday night,
Stanford's defense held the Bruins, who had been averaging 82.3
points a game, to 50 but still managed to lose. Why? Because of
poor shooting. As Howie Dallmar puts it, "You don't shout 30 per

cent against them, and win." Stan
ford made only that percentage of
their shots from the field, and it
was Barry Brown and Bill Bond,
two of the more accurate shots,
that were way off.
From the foul line, the Cards
slipped even farther. They made
only 10 of 27 attempts. Many of
the misses came on the first try,
thus losing the bonus shot. It
wouldn't have taken too many of
those to turn the 50-48 loss into a
victory.
Dallmar feels that the inabil
ity from the field hurt more than
the misses from the free-throw
line, though, Ho says Stanford
basically is not a good free-throw
team.
"Brown is naturally a jump
shooter and has trouble on free
tosses, and Flanders also has
trouble. I've been very happy
with Brown, who has made about
65 per cent of his charily shots."
According to Dallmar, Flan
ders hadn't started too many
games to date, and recovered
from Friday night to make five
of seven on Saturday.
Dallmar feels that a team's
first six men should average
around 65 to 70 per cent on char
ity tosses. Stanford's team aver
age is 61.9 per cent. Bond is the
leader with 71 per cent, and

Brown and Carl Isaacs are over the 65 per cent mark.
George Selleck is close with (54.5 per cent, but Flanders is 51.7 per
cent and Hap Wagner is down at 46.8 per cent. Carlos Bea had 76.2
per cent before he had to quit because of his back.
Stanford's opponents have averaged 67.5 per cent on their free
throws.
Dallmar says he feels that the art of free throwing is like hitting
in baseball. There is no one right way.
"I try to help correct minor flaws in players' form, but provided
they keep their average up. I don't care whether they use two hands,
one hand or shoot over their heads." he finished.

Stanford's defense held the Bruins, who had been averaging 82.3
points a game, to 50 but still managed to lose. Why? Because of
poor shooting. As Howie Dallmar puts it, "You don't shout 30 per

cent against them, and win." Stan
ford made only that percentage of
their shots from the field, and it
was Barry Brown and Bill Bond,
two of the more accurate shots,
that were way off.
From the foul line, the Cards
slipped even farther. They made
only 10 of 27 attempts. Many of
the misses came on the first try,
thus losing the bonus shot. It
wouldn't have taken too many of
those to turn the 50-48 loss into a
victory.
Dallmar feels that the inabil
ity from the field hurt more than
the misses from the free-throw
line, though, Ho says Stanford
basically is not a good free-throw
team.
"Brown is naturally a jump
shooter and has trouble on free
tosses, and Flanders also has
trouble. I've been very happy
with Brown, who has made about
65 per cent of his charily shots."
According to Dallmar, Flan
ders hadn't started too many
games to date, and recovered
from Friday night to make five
of seven on Saturday.
Dallmar feels that a team's
first six men should average
around 65 to 70 per cent on char
ity tosses. Stanford's team aver
age is 61.9 per cent. Bond is the
leader with 71 per cent, and

Brown and Carl Isaacs are over the 65 per cent mark.
George Selleck is close with (54.5 per cent, but Flanders is 51.7 per
cent and Hap Wagner is down at 46.8 per cent. Carlos Bea had 76.2
per cent before he had to quit because of his back.
Stanford's opponents have averaged 67.5 per cent on their free
throws.
Dallmar says he feels that the art of free throwing is like hitting
in baseball. There is no one right way.
"I try to help correct minor flaws in players' form, but provided
they keep their average up. I don't care whether they use two hands,
one hand or shoot over their heads." he finished.
