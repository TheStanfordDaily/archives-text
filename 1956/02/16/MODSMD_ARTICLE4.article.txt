# STANFORD ACHES
## Industrial Zoning Plan OK'd at First Reading 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council approved by a 7-5 vote Wednesday night
the first reading of zoning of 125 Stanford acres near South Palo Alto
to be used by the Lockheed Corporation for research laboratories.
The second reading and actual annexation of the property will come i
up at the Council's next meeting Monday. Actual construction of the ;

plant cannot begin until the Coun
cil approves the Planning Com
mission's zoning plans.
Argument in the zoning plan
developed over a proposed 50-foot
"O-A District" buffer district be
tween ' indusl rial buildings and
property lines of citizens in the
area along California Avenue.

Andrew VV. Spears, 950 Mata
dero Avenue, representing citi
zens in the area, claimed that the
50-foot district was not enough
and asked that 70 feet be made
the distance from buildings to
property lines.
"One building 240 feet long and
35 feet high will be within 50 feet
of our property lino," said Speers.
"The company will undoubtedly
get a use permit to build a road
in back of the building. Besides,
an electric loop and an electric
substation are planned for the
area. This leaves only 10 feet of
the supposed '50-foot green
zone.' "
Spears added that the Univer-1
sity would lose only one-third of 1
an acre, or $8,000 out of $600,000 1
of income, if the zone were moved
back to 70 feet.
"Previous buffer zones h a ve I
been 70 feet. The University did j
not consider the good-neighbor
policy in this -instance," Spears
said.

Stanford Business Manager Alt
E. Brandin replied to the charges:
"The University has always kept I
a good-neighbor policy in mind.
Fifty feet is the normal width of
the district. In other instances the
University was under no obliga
tion to allow over 50 feet. The
present zone meets all qualifica
tions."
Councilwoman Mildred Corcor
an and Councilman Robert ('urn
minus said the district should be
either 70 or 50 feet completely
clear of additions.
The planning commission's mo- J
tion was then passed by a narrow
7-.") margin. Mayor Noel E. Porter
emphasized the vote was a first!
reading only and told Council
members to go home and "think
the question over."
