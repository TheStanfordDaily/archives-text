## 
### 
Through loans by several local
dealers and collectors, the Stan
ford Museum is now showing a
125-piece collection of Korean ce
ramics in its Oriental Gallery.
The show covers the period
from 1000 B.C. to the present.
Many of the shapes of the ceram
ic objects have been borrowed
from the Han period. The Korean
ceramics serve as a cultural
bridge between Chinese and Jap
anese art. but still possess a char
acter of their own.
The Museum is open daily from
1 to 5 p.m. Admission is 25 cents
except to faculty, students and
University personnel, who are ad
mitted free of charge.
