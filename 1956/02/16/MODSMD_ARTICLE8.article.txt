# NSA's Movie Goes Astray

Nu-Art I-' iI m Distributors,
Inc., of New York may be a lit
tle confused, but the National
Students Association carries on.
It seems a niixup in names
had John W. Hendricks, Stan
ford Sigma Chi, on somebody's
mailing list as NSA's Executive
Travel Director.
Hendricks thought it must be
a practical joke. He managed to
disregard congratulatory let
ters, but when a 7(MMoot reel of
color film arrived by mail for
the Stanford NSA showing, his
dudgeon was aroused. Back to
New York went the film, sched
uled to be shown here last
night.
But with characteristic savoir
faire, NSA President Jim Sam
met announced the niixup had
been taken care of, and that the
NSA's honest-to-God, genuine
travel director John Hendricks,
whose middle initial is "V," not
"W," had a copy of the "Same
film with him.
"Very amusing," said Sigma
Chi Hendricks.
