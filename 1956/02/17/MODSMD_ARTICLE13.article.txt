# FEHRING'S DEBUT
## Cards Open Baseball Season Against Strong Alumni Nine 
### 
Baseball opens its 1956 stand on the Farm tomorrow afternoon
when the Varsity plays an All-Star alumni nine at 2:30 on the Sunken
Diamond. The game marks the debut of Dutch Fehring as head base
ball coach. Admission is free.
The Alurrtni team is a talented organization. Most of the players are

now in pro ball, and the list is
headed by Jack Shepard, Pitts
burgh Pirate catcher. The Stan
ford team will present a lineup
quite different from that which
finished out the season last year.
Third baseman Rudy Figueroa,
outfielder Bob Evans and pitchers
Walt Payne and Ray Young rep
resent the top returnees from
193.5, and Hal Messner, first base,
is back. All other positions have
tiew faces, although Mickey Holz
man and Bob Fletcher, who split
keystone duties last year, are now
playing center and right field, re
spectively.
Keystone Combo
Three freshmen have broken
into Fehring's starting lineup: A 1
Shaw, who hit .345 last season, is
at second; Bob Flanders, leading
frosh hitter with .400, is at short
stop, and Doug Camilli is behind
the plate.
Figueroa is the top hitter of
the group. Swinging from the left
side of tfTe plate, he swatted .374
last year and was voted the Most
Valuable Player award for 1955.
Once again, pitching is a strong
point. Young and Payne are prob
ably the top pitching pair on the
Coast and are abetted by Ray
Looney, up from tho Braves; Ed
Verdurmen and Dick Jones.
Professionals
The Alums boast ex-New York
Yankee Bobby Brown, now a San
Francisco doctor, and Lloyd Mer
riman, ex-Redleg and Cub, now
with Portland, as well as a host
of players now in the minors.
Ray Swarts, up for a try with
the Pirates this spring; Chuck
Essegian, who has hit more balls
out of the Sunken diamond than
anyone else; Rick Scramaglia,
Varsity shortstop last spring;
Monte Pfyl and Art Abrahamson
will do the hitting and fielding
for the All-Stars.
Bob Murphy, ex-Oak la rider; Rog
Osenbaugh and Mike Acker, now
with Sacramento; Phil Page of
Portland and ex-pro Dave Dahle
form a formidable pitching staff
for the squad which will be out
to beat their alma mater.
An hour before this game gets
under way, there will bo a game
between non-professional grads,
with the odd-year classes chal
lenging the even-year graduates.
This same gets under way at 1:30.

under way, there will bo a game
between non-professional grads,
with the odd-year classes chal
lenging the even-year graduates.
This same gets under way at 1:30.
Baseball opens its 1956 stand on the Farm tomorrow afternoon
when the Varsity plays an All-Star alumni nine at 2:30 on the Sunken
Diamond. The game marks the debut of Dutch Fehring as head base
ball coach. Admission is free.
The Alurrtni team is a talented organization. Most of the players are

now in pro ball, and the list is
headed by Jack Shepard, Pitts
burgh Pirate catcher. The Stan
ford team will present a lineup
quite different from that which
finished out the season last year.
Third baseman Rudy Figueroa,
outfielder Bob Evans and pitchers
Walt Payne and Ray Young rep
resent the top returnees from
193.5, and Hal Messner, first base,
is back. All other positions have
tiew faces, although Mickey Holz
man and Bob Fletcher, who split
keystone duties last year, are now
playing center and right field, re
spectively.
Keystone Combo
Three freshmen have broken
into Fehring's starting lineup: A 1
Shaw, who hit .345 last season, is
at second; Bob Flanders, leading
frosh hitter with .400, is at short
stop, and Doug Camilli is behind
the plate.
Figueroa is the top hitter of
the group. Swinging from the left
side of tfTe plate, he swatted .374
last year and was voted the Most
Valuable Player award for 1955.
Once again, pitching is a strong
point. Young and Payne are prob
ably the top pitching pair on the
Coast and are abetted by Ray
Looney, up from tho Braves; Ed
Verdurmen and Dick Jones.
Professionals
The Alums boast ex-New York
Yankee Bobby Brown, now a San
Francisco doctor, and Lloyd Mer
riman, ex-Redleg and Cub, now
with Portland, as well as a host
of players now in the minors.
Ray Swarts, up for a try with
the Pirates this spring; Chuck
Essegian, who has hit more balls
out of the Sunken diamond than
anyone else; Rick Scramaglia,
Varsity shortstop last spring;
Monte Pfyl and Art Abrahamson
will do the hitting and fielding
for the All-Stars.
Bob Murphy, ex-Oak la rider; Rog
Osenbaugh and Mike Acker, now
with Sacramento; Phil Page of
Portland and ex-pro Dave Dahle
form a formidable pitching staff
for the squad which will be out
to beat their alma mater.
