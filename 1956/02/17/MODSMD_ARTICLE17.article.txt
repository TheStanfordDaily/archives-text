assumed that Howie Dallmar's
crew will be eager lo get back on
the w inning road after two
straight losses.
Troy, however, also has quite
an incentive for the upcoming
series, as the team from Figueroa
Street has' lost two conference
games already (one to Cal and
one to Oregon) and cannot afford
to lose many more if they arc to
remain within striking distance of
UCLA and the conference title.
Defensive Battle
The upcoming series promises
to be a tremendous defensive bat
tle, as SC leads the conference in
defense and Stanford is third in
line. Troy is also second in of
fense and first in field goal per
centage.
Southern Cal's fop scorer so far
this year has been Jack Dunne,
followed closely by Jack Lovrich
and Larry Hauser. Dunne has hit
for 126 points in 10 games, mostly
on jump shots, at which he excels,
and set shots from the outside.
Lovrich, at the Reason's outset,
was rated no higher than fourth
string at center. Against Dart
mouth in San Francisco, however,
he exploded for 23 points, which
earned him the starting berth for
the Trojans. Hauser is the sopho
more sensation who shattered
scoring records as a frosh last
year, leading SC in shooting per
centage this year both from the
field and from the free throw line.
Other Starters
Troys other two starters will
be Jim Kaufman and twoyear
letterman Tony Psaltis.
George Selleck moved into fiftb
place in conference scoring with
157 points as a result of his 42-
point outburst against the Bruins.
Gary Van Galder leads the PCC
with a shooting record of 50 per
cent from the floor.
Last year the two teams split
four games, each taking two on
its home eotirt. The Indians v\ill

assumed that Howie Dallmar's
crew will be eager lo get back on
the w inning road after two
straight losses.
Troy, however, also has quite
an incentive for the upcoming
series, as the team from Figueroa
Street has' lost two conference
games already (one to Cal and
one to Oregon) and cannot afford
to lose many more if they arc to
remain within striking distance of
UCLA and the conference title.
Defensive Battle
The upcoming series promises
to be a tremendous defensive bat
tle, as SC leads the conference in
defense and Stanford is third in
line. Troy is also second in of
fense and first in field goal per
centage.
Southern Cal's fop scorer so far
this year has been Jack Dunne,
followed closely by Jack Lovrich
and Larry Hauser. Dunne has hit
for 126 points in 10 games, mostly
on jump shots, at which he excels,

Lovrich, at the Reason's outset,
was rated no higher than fourth
string at center. Against Dart
mouth in San Francisco, however,
he exploded for 23 points, which
earned him the starting berth for
the Trojans. Hauser is the sopho

scoring records as a frosh last
year, leading SC in shooting per
centage this year both from the
field and from the free throw line.
Other Starters
Troys other two starters will
be Jim Kaufman and twoyear
letterman Tony Psaltis.
George Selleck moved into fiftb
place in conference scoring with
157 points as a result of his 42-
point outburst against the Bruins.
Gary Van Galder leads the PCC
with a shooting record of 50 per
cent from the floor.
