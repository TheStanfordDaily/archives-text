### 
Stanford's red-vesied pep hand, which makes
the timbers of the Pavilion resound with red
hoi tunes during basketball season, deserves a
long-overdue round of applause.
'I hi* weekend, leader George Sheldon and
31 of his down beating music-makers will' he
filling the soundwave* at the Pan-Pacific Audi
torium in Los An <i«-les during the I St 1 game.
Tomorrow afternoon they will eatch the re
gional TV eye.
For their efforts, the ragliiners receive no
unit credit as do th«- football and spnng hands.
They plav for sheer enjoyment and the scat
tered applause, of the haskethall fans.

The 7."i men from whom the pep hand mem
bership is drawn average more than an hgur
of practice every week to perfect their reper
toire of fiO selections.
Sometimes we fail to recognize the contri
bution being made bv this ragtime outfit.
The enjoyment of a basketball game would
certainly be diminished without the Sheldon
touch. The music creates the rijdit atmosphere
fan atmosphere transplanted to Smogland this
weekend but returning to the Pavilion Mar. 3).
Let's not fail to give senior (George Sheldon
and the red-hot red-vests that long-overdue
applause.
