## How LASSU's Traffic Proposals Will Attack the Campus Problem 
### Frank Huntress 
During the past few weeks ASSH Legisla
ture ha.-- been attacking the campus traffic
problems.
\t last count student legislators had passed
10 resolutions to help alleviate the traffic situ
ation. The resolutions were recommended by
a student traffic committee headed by Jloh
Maddock.
Their effort* to dale include the following
resolutions:
• Directing of traffic by police officers dur
ing the noon hour ::l the Post Office, Physics
(lorner, corner of Galvez and Serra Streets
(near Encina to take care of Western Civili
zation and General Biology rushes on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday), corner of Escondido
and Galvez Streets and corner of Santa Teresa
and Lomita Streets.
The law-makers believe individual patrol
ling at these points will help keep traffic mov
ing and prevent pedestrians from holding up
traffic by jay*walking.
• Painting of white lines on all streets. They
specifically recommended lines be painted to
indicate parking spaces and Palm Drive be
marked as a four-lane road.
• Campus Drive be made a "through" street.
Legislature indicated the stop sign for this
road be turned so traffic coming in on Escon
dido Road stop instead of traffic coming in on
Campus Drive, as it is now.
• The Oval be restricted for the use by off
campus and Village students. This would cre
ate 200 parking spaces for their private use.
The purchase and distribution of stickers
for this zone parking will he handled by the
students involved, while the police will enforce
Ihe zone.
• Placing of a "Stop for Pedestrians" sign
and a pedestrian crosswalk between Stern and
\\ ilbur halls across Escondido.
The danger here lies in that it is possible
for a car starting from a dead stop at the inter
section of Campus Drive and Escondido to be
traveling at a dangerous rate of speed by the
time it reaches the pedestrian crossing.
• An outlet be made for the Branner park
ing lot. The outlet was closed during the con
struction of Wilbur and now causes traffic con
gestion.
• Opening of Los Arboles Road to traffic.

The Traffic Committee prefers this road to be
opened for two-way traffic. But if this is im
possible ihey suggest it be one-way for out
bound trallic from the site of the present barri
cade to Foothill Road.
The road was closed because the street was
a traffic hazard to pedestrians, but it has cre
ated a larger traffic congestion in front of
Lagunita Goiirt since it has been closed.
• Creation of a 30-minute parking zone in
front of Fncina to insure parking space for
those who require only a short time to use the
bank facilities.
• Allowing dormitories with a nearby park
ing lot to restrict parts or all of the lot for
their own residents.
Details would be left up to individual dorms.
This move taken by LASSU would enable, per
sons to park their cars near their residences
and force outsiders to seek other areas in which
to park their cars.
But this brings up another requirement—
the issuance of stickers for the purpose of
identification; a different slicker for access to
each lot.
• Reserved parking spaces be created on the
part of Escondido Road running behind Me
morial Church for faculty personnel. The cars
would be parked against the wall on the west
side of the street in a diagonal manner. No
parking would be allowed on the Quad side.
This would create about 100 new parking
spaces which would be occupied all day, re
moving cars from the main streams of traffic.
Jt probably would result in making 100 more
spaces available for student parking.
Another parking proposal to require man
datory registration of all cars to be parked in
specific locations was defeated last Wednesday
night by Legislature.
Areas which would have required a sticker
before parking in them were the Library park
ing lot, the triangle lot, the Women's Gym
nasium and Quad Office lot and the Oval.
Parking in these areas without a sticker would
have constituted a parking violation.
Legislature recognized the administrative
and policing difficulties of this proposal and
voted it down.
After a quarter and a half of deliberation
it is good to see that LASSU is finally begin
ning to move on the problem of campus traffic
and parking.
