(>iiciul Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
I agree heartily with Mr. Wickland when he
decries the attitude of some individuals who
evaluate foreign opinions about the United States
on a prestige scale, particularly where important
issues sueh as racial problems are involved.
The dignity and equality of men are most cer
lainly matters of principle and not of prestige.
And if these human rights be suppressed, "all
ihe beneficial aspects of this country" could not
justify their suppression even when successful
and. we hope, only temporary.
Unfortunately, foreign students are not en
dowed with the gift of selective vision so that, in
seeing the whole life of this great country, parts
of it—especially the faulty and unsavory as ex

emplified by tho racial issue—may he shut off at
will from their view "and not be brought into
sharp focus" by them, as suggested by Mr. Wick
land.
We students from abroad are privileged not
only to observe but to learn and live the Ameri
can way of life, if only for a short while. To a
few of us the greatness of this country will lie,
not so much in its leadership insofar as material
advancement (for everyone knows this fact), but
rather in its revitalizing Lincoln's ideals of hu
man equality which first came to light at Gettys
burg.
If the American people shall prove Ihemselves
equal to this crucial challenge, then we foreign
students will go home enlightened to apply our
selves, as Mr. Wickland proposed, with increased
vigor to our own problems.
Ernesto C. IVralta
