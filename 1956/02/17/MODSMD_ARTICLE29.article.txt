# JV, Frosh Basketballers Face San Francisco Teams
## Olympic Club and CCSF Invade Farm; Stanford Squads Will Be Hard Pressed 
### 
Basketball fans are in for top court action in the Pavilion this
weekend as the Frosh, victorious in eight straight games, and the
Braves appear in Saturday evening games at 5:45 and 8, respectively.
Captain Paul Neumann and forward John Pflueger will lead the
Papooses against the City College of San Francisco as the Frosh
look for their 10th win of the —

year. Their only defeat was a
thriller with St. Ignatius High of
San Francisco, which edged out
the Papooses on the 41-point per
formance of center Fred LaCour.
The City College Rams are one
of the top quintets in the Big
Fight Conference. Sparking their
attack are two former high school
stars from Lowell High in San
Francisco Clarence Grider and
A 1 Mock. Grider, one of the most
polished young players in north
ern California, has been averag
ing about 15 points a game and is
a rugged rebounder.
Without high-scoring center
John Caple, who is through for
the season due to a foot injury,
Ihe Frosh could be in a rough
spot to win this one. However,
Brent Leonard did a very credit
able job of filling in for Caple
last week, and with the efforts of
Neumann,'offensive leader of the
squad, and Pflueger, the hot
Frosh five could maintain their
winning streak.
The Braves will also take part
in an exciting tilt, but the results
could be much more one-sided
since they meet the undefeated
Olympic Club of San Francisco
paced by several ex-Stanford and
Cal greats of the past few years.
Included in this group could be
Ron Tomsic, one of the greatest
players in Stanford history, and
Bob Matheny, flashy playmaker
from Cal. The Olympic Club quin
tet, winners of 18 straight games,
are perennial contestants in final
rounds of the national AAU bas
ketball championships.
Many of the Olympic Club
stars, certainly worth watching,
are of sufficient experience and
ability to play pro ball, so Coach
George Lynn's quintet will need
to play their best ball of the sea
son to make it a contest.
