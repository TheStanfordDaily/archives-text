## Coach Pessimistic; Cards Are Depleted 
### 
So far this year Stanford has
lost to UCLA once in foot hall and
twice in basketball.
The Indians will get another
crack at the Bruins tonight at
7:30 in the Pavilion, when Coach
Wesley Ruff's Farm ma I men
meet UCLA's grapplers.
"UCLA," said the mat coach,
"is about the same strength as
San Jose State, and San Jose has
been creaming everybody this
year. We don't expect to win. We
just want to keep the score down.
It's a hard match for a crippled
team."
Due to injuries, illness and pres
sure from studies, Coach Rul'f
has just about half his original
first-string left.
Missing from the lineup tonight
will be such standouts as Howard
Demuth, Pete Likins, Don Manou
kian and Ray Miller.
Gerald Lowell, 123 pounds; Bob
Fisher, 130; George Ong, 137;
Fred Ruyman, 147; Bob Carmody,
