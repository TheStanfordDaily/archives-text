LAWRENCE, Kan., Feb. 16
(UP)—A group of 14 senior all
stars, instead of the NCAA tour
nament champions, will represent
college players in the American
Olympic Basketball Tournament,
Chairman A. C. (Dutch) Lonhorg
said today.
Reason for the switch this year
is because the Olympics tourna
ment in Australia is set for No
vember and December, and col
lege students other than present
seniors would miss school next
fall. Lonborg said.
The Olympics tournament will
be held April 2-4 in Kansas City's
municipal auditorium.
Participants beside the college
all-stars will be the national arm
ed services champion, the AAU
champions and the AAU runners
up.
"We had to make the switch
because the NCAA tournament
winners, as a team, probably
wouldn't be able 1o go," Lonborg
told the United Press tonight.
