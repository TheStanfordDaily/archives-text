# Swimmers Open Season Against San Jose Stale
## 
### John Weiser 
The largest freshman swim
ming squad ever to ho assembled
at S t a n for d completely over
whelmed Sail Jose State yester
day by a score of 02 to 14 at the
Fncina pools. Led by furlong
swimmer Alf Brandin and sprint
er Treat Cafferata. the yearlings
evidenced tremendous depth by
shutting out San Jose to third
places in nearly every event.
In the varsity picture, tho fabu
lous Haynie mermen journey to
San Jose State at 4 this afternoon
for their initial contest of the
season.
Card swim secrets will be put
to a good test as the "flying fish"
are going all-out after the slug
gish San Jose pool records. Al
most certain to he cracked are
marks for the medley relay and
individual hoth events
can accommodate nearly every
Haynie secret, including the "turn
of terror."
Raring to go are sprinters Rob
in Moore and Doug Ackerman,
who, in an almost incredible per
sonal duel this past week, have
lowered their times to within a
hairsbreadth of national marks at
50 and 100 yards. Cole Wilbur,
who bullets beneath the water in
world record time, should have a
field day at his specialty, the 200-
yard breast stroke.
All in all. Stanford's colorful
water experts will he off to a fly
ing start as they tie into a full
season of activity.
