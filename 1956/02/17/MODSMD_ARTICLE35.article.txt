# Santa Clara Hosts Stanford Boxers
## 
### 
The Indian glovemen will take
on Santa Clara University at San
ta Clara tomorrow night at 8.
They will face the same squad
that defeated them at Stanford in
January, with the exception of a
new heavyweight. Coach Ray
Lunney will send his ace, Bob
Burkie, against the new threat,
and he is confident that Burkie
will handle him.
Being deficient in two weight
divisions, the Indians were forced
to forfeit the deciding two match
es to the Santa Clarans in the last
meet. Lunney feels that his War
riors will gain the necessary ad
vantage in the 178-pound division.
