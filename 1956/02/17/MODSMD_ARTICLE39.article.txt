# Sheldon, Red-Vested Jazzmen Supply Pep at Games
## Band Features Popular Jazz Arrangements 32-Piece Group Is Heading for USU 
### 
It's a tight moment at Stan
ford's Basketball Pavilion. Scrap
py little George Selleck has just
led the Indian netmen down the
floor lor another two points and
you're yelling yourself hoarse.
But there's somebody hoarser
than you. He's George Sheldon,
leader of Stanford's Basketball
Pep Band, and his voice is usually
down to a froggy croak some
time early in the first half.
Trying to call the next tune
over the noise of the Pavilion is
the least of Sheldon's worries. As
leader of the 32-piece Pep Band,
he has the job of working out
arrangements and finding new
numbers suitable for the Pep
Band, rehearsing each tune, to
perfection and leading them
through their ragtime repertoire
twice each weekend.
Financial Worries
One of the band's worries was
temporarily removed this week
end as the bandsmen were award
ed $600 by the Athletic Board for
their trip to the Southland. Ordi
narily the basketball band re
ceives no financial support from
the University.
Perhaps the most difficult job.
says Sheldon, is finding enough
musicians to fill out the band.
While all the members give the
Pep Band their enthusiastic sup
port, Friday or Saturday night
dates, he explains, take prece
dence over band engagements.
Rotation
To solve the problem, the Pep
Band has been set up with a ros
ter of 7f> members, who take turns
rather than being organized into
two separate bands.
The bandsmen get no Univer
sity credit for their work, unlike
members of the Football Band.
But despite these difficulties,
the Pep Band has been growing
ami improving ever since it was
founded two years ago. It was
founded because members of the
Football Band, one of the nation's
best, felt that Stanford was fall
ing behind in the basketball music
department.
To give the rooters something
more than an occasional six- or
eight-piece section to back them
up, the band members decided on
an organization which would fol
low the same colorful tradition
both in music and in spirit as
their big-brother band.
"Tiger Rag"
They picked red vests and bow
ties to go along with a repertoire
of some 50 jazz tunes and school
songs, including their now well
known arrangements of "Tiger
Rag," "Way Down Yonder in New
Orleans" and "Muskrat Ramble."
They have done special num
bers in other fields also, such as
their arrangements of "Briga
doon" music for the Oregon game.
This weekend the Basketball
Pep Band will be on hand for the
televised Stanford-SC games.
"And,"says Sheldon, "we'll be
leading off as usual with one of
our theme songsâ€”'Come Join the
Band'."
