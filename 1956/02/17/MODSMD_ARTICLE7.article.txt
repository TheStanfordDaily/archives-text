# Plan Adds AB Requirements, Recommends Advising Change
## AB Candidates to Take Science, Math Option, Colloquium; Freshmen May Enter Major Field

Editor's Note: This is the, second of two articles which deal
with Ihe new undergraduate program passed last week by Ihe
University Academic Council.

Totally now in I ho recently approved undergraduate program are
tlie three additional requirements for candidates for the A.B. degree.
Recognizing the heavy program demanded of students in the tech
nical and scientific fields, Study of Undergraduate Education Com
mittee wished to provide a more complete program of general studies
for A.B. candidates. — 1

These new requirements are:
• Choice of Mathematics 1 (or
advanced course), Philosophy 1,
or four units of language reading.
• A natural science, including
mathematics. Philosophy 1, statis
tics and/or Psychology 60, as well
as the usual laboratory science
courses.
• Two two - unit senior collo
quia.
New Malh Course
Mathematics 1 is a new course
which will be designed by the
mathematics department as a ter
minal course for A.B. grads. "Far
too many University students and
graduates are unduly handicap
ped in dealing with . . . mathe
matics or techniques of precise
logical analysis," the committee
said.
Realizing, however, that "some
students have either a marked
aversion to, or an inability to
grasp, mathematical representa
tions," the language reading op
tion was added, and recommended
to be done preferably in the stu
dent's major field.
Natural science requirements
would bring the total units in this
field to 17 for the A.B. candidate.
This would bring the science re
quirements into approximate bal
ance with the number of units re
quired in the humanities and so
cial sciences.
Senior Colloquium
It is the senior colloquium that
is the most experimental of the
new requirements. Patterned
somewhat after the seminar cur
rently in use in the humanities
honors program, the colloquium
offers an "inroad against the in
evitable impersonality of a large
university," said Dr. Robert
Hoopes, SUP] director.
Faculty members in all Univer
sity departments may offer a col
loquium on a specific subject and
students will be free to choose
their topic and leafier through a

prior listing in the time schedule.
Students will be urged to par
ticipate in eolloquia outside their
major,field.
The colloquium will not be a
bull session, hut a thoughtful dis
cussion aimed at closer definition
of the group topic, stressed Dr.
Iloopes. The recommendations in
clude preparation of an essay as
an essential part of the eolloquia.
Faculty Relationships
In the questionnaires given to
last year's seniors and alumni, a
"mighty cry of lament" was
raised by the graduates that they
didn't get close enough to faculty
members, said Dr. Hoopcs.
"Careful cultivation of good
teaching in small groups, such as
we will strive for in the eolloquia,
is much more effective than
forced fraternization," he slated.
Since the new four-year plan is
designed to give students maxi
mum latitude in arranging their
programs, they may enter their
majors as freshmen. At this point
they will be assigned a major ad
viser. responsible for helping the
student complete his require
ments.
Programming
Details of the order in which
classes will be taken will bo left,
largely to the adviser and the in
dividual student. However, it is
recommended that Western Civi
lization. English, and language or
math be taken in the freshman
year in preparation for later ad
vanced courses.
"The committee believes that
there is need for more clear-cut
recognition of the importance of
advising in I he University pro
gram, and that the whole system
is in need of review and improve
ment," the report stated.
As ;i step in the right direction,
the new plan enables students to
change advisers and majors with
out consulting their present ad
viser.
The committee report ends with
» plea that "all members of the
teaching staff in the University
be urged to make good English
composition a consideration in the
grades given to written work."
Stressing that the "distinction
between form and content is un
realistic," I>r. Iloopes pointed out
that freshman English is more
than a requirement, but ;» prepa
ration for all further university
st udies.
