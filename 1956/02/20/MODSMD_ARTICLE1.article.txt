# Racial Integration Is Progressing ... Advance Is Slow—But Evident
## 
### Wally Simpson 
The United States Supreme Court ruled May 17, 1954, that
segregation in public schools is unconstitutional.
The hue and cry in the South following that momentous de
cision has been described in some circles as "the lament of a
dying faith following the infliction of a mortal wound; the death
rattle, the violent despair of a hopeless cause."
Student demonstrations at the University of Alabama over
Autherine Lucy's admission have been characterized as such.
Much has been publicized concerning demonstrations and riots
over "forced" integration of races. Little has been said about
what has been peacefully accomplished in the area of desegre
gation.
Four months after the Supreme Court handed down its de
cision four major cities and scores of smaller towfts in seven
states had begun the process of integration. Most of them now
have completely integrated school systems, without the attend
ance of prophesied violence.

In most of these cases integration was voluntarily begun by
school boards without necessity of court orders. And integration
appears to be successful.
From Baltimore come reports that Negro students have be
come members of athletic teams and even student governments.
This also holds true for some schools in West Virginia and Mis
souri. «
There are. of course, exceptions to these. But. except in the
five hard-core segregation states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisi
ana, Mississippi and South Carolina, desegregation is pretty well
accepted as fact. Even Louisiana is beginning to integrate now.
Schools are but one of the areas involved in the continual
drive toward integration. Very quietly but very effectively was
integration accomplished in the Armed Forces. Here it was
proved beyond doubt that integration could be made without
creating violence.
Integration has been greatly increased in fields of transpor
tation and recreation. Segregation has been completely elimi

nated in interstate passenger vehicles. This has necessitated the
construction of triple waiting rooms in some states: one for
desegregated interstate passengers, one for white intrastate pas
sengers and one for colored intrastate passengers.
Of more than passing interest is the fact that at Atlanta,
Georgia, municipal golf course there is no segregation. This
desegregated condition is not expected to-last, as Georgia's legis
lature is expected to pass a bill lifting the charters of all munici
palities having integrated recreational facilities.
Court rulings within the past. 10 years have opened up other
recreational facilities to members of all races. City-operated
swimming pools in both Maryland and Washington, D. C., are
no longer segreg cl.
Sports promoters in some larger Southern cities have frankly
declared they do not intend to allow segregation laws to interfere
with their sports programs.
The problem of segregation in labor was one of the most
pressing 20 years ago. It still is. But major advances have also

been made in that ai-ea; not as much as has been desired, but
enough to show good progress.
Seven states have passed and rigorously enforce fair employ
ment laws. These have affected workers not only in those states
but in many Segregated states also. For example, integration of
seamen in New York has caused similar integrations in Southern
coastal states. Labor organizations themselves are also further
ing the cause of integration.
Civil rights is now a major issue in political campaigns of
both parties. Each one is trying to outdo the other in its stand
on the necessity for increased integration. Both agree segrega
tion must go. The only issue is how it should go.
In practically every segregated area, integration has been ac
complished by a continual series of proddings in the form of
court orders, administrative rulings and similar orders. Volun
tary action has continued the job by working where court orders
have left off. Voluntary action has done most of the work, and
the predicted violence has been at a minimum.

The hue and cry in the South following that momentous de
cision has been described in some circles as "the lament of a
dying faith following the infliction of a mortal wound; the death
rattle, the violent despair of a hopeless cause."
Student demonstrations at the University of Alabama over
Autherine Lucy's admission have been characterized as such.
Much has been publicized concerning demonstrations and riots
over "forced" integration of races. Little has been said about
what has been peacefully accomplished in the area of desegre
gation.
Four months after the Supreme Court handed down its de
cision four major cities and scores of smaller towfts in seven
states had begun the process of integration. Most of them now
have completely integrated school systems, without the attend
ance of prophesied violence.

In most of these cases integration was voluntarily begun by
school boards without necessity of court orders. And integration
appears to be successful.
From Baltimore come reports that Negro students have be
come members of athletic teams and even student governments.
This also holds true for some schools in West Virginia and Mis
souri. «
There are. of course, exceptions to these. But. except in the
five hard-core segregation states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisi
ana, Mississippi and South Carolina, desegregation is pretty well
accepted as fact. Even Louisiana is beginning to integrate now.
Schools are but one of the areas involved in the continual
drive toward integration. Very quietly but very effectively was
integration accomplished in the Armed Forces. Here it was
proved beyond doubt that integration could be made without
creating violence.
Integration has been greatly increased in fields of transpor
tation and recreation. Segregation has been completely elimi

nated in interstate passenger vehicles. This has necessitated the
construction of triple waiting rooms in some states: one for
desegregated interstate passengers, one for white intrastate pas
sengers and one for colored intrastate passengers.
Of more than passing interest is the fact that at Atlanta,
Georgia, municipal golf course there is no segregation. This
desegregated condition is not expected to-last, as Georgia's legis
lature is expected to pass a bill lifting the charters of all munici
palities having integrated recreational facilities.
Court rulings within the past. 10 years have opened up other
recreational facilities to members of all races. City-operated
swimming pools in both Maryland and Washington, D. C., are
no longer segreg cl.
Sports promoters in some larger Southern cities have frankly
declared they do not intend to allow segregation laws to interfere
with their sports programs.
The problem of segregation in labor was one of the most
pressing 20 years ago. It still is. But major advances have also

been made in that ai-ea; not as much as has been desired, but
enough to show good progress.
Seven states have passed and rigorously enforce fair employ
ment laws. These have affected workers not only in those states
but in many Segregated states also. For example, integration of
seamen in New York has caused similar integrations in Southern
coastal states. Labor organizations themselves are also further
ing the cause of integration.
Civil rights is now a major issue in political campaigns of
both parties. Each one is trying to outdo the other in its stand
on the necessity for increased integration. Both agree segrega
tion must go. The only issue is how it should go.
In practically every segregated area, integration has been ac
complished by a continual series of proddings in the form of
court orders, administrative rulings and similar orders. Volun
tary action has continued the job by working where court orders
have left off. Voluntary action has done most of the work, and
the predicted violence has been at a minimum.
The United States Supreme Court ruled May 17, 1954, that
segregation in public schools is unconstitutional.
