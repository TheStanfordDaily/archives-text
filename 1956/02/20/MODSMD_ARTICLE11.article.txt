(UP)—Louisiana State Universi
ty's board of supervisors has vot
ed overwhelmingly against bar
ring its athletic teams from par
ticipating against Negro players
or tightening entrance require
ments aimed at Negro students.
The action came last night after
a seven-hour meeting behind clos
ed doors during which two tac
tions argued whether LSI! should
play teams which have Negro ath
letes or tighten entrance require
ments to halt an expected flood
of Negro enrollments at the un
dergraduate level.
The board voted 10-2 on the con
tinuation of its present sports
program, which allows LSU to
participate against Negro oppo
nents, and 114 on a 'resolution
not to change its entrance re
quirements.
Following the long closed meet
ing, the board went into an open
session for about four minutes
and made public the resolutions
it had adopted.
Following a meeting two weeks
ago a board member said the su
pervisors would announce the
new racial program in the athletic
and entrance requirements.
"LSU has traditionally carried
on a well-rounded program of
collegiate athletics," the board an
nounced.
The resolution said. "Accord
ingly, the university will continue
to schedule varsity athletic con
tests with major institutions of
this and other sections of the
country."
