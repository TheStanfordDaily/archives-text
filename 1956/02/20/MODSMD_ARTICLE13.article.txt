## 
### 
All that little Billy Loper wanted to do was to find his playmate's
house, hut he lost his way and quite unwittingly touched off a 10-hour
search last Thursday night involving more than 500 persons, includ
ing some 300 Stanford students.
The three-year-old boy was found by a five-man search team asleep

on a knoll near the Isolation Hos
pital, about ono mile from his
home, unharmed and sheltered
from the bitter winds by his pals
two mongrel dogs belonging to
neighbors of the Loper family.
Billy, son of Dr. Robert Loper
of the Speech and Drama Depart
ment, was found to be missing by
his mother at 4 p.m., and, after
condu c t in g an unsuccessful
search herself, Mrs. Loper called
the San Mateo and Santa Clara
counties sheriffs' offices.
Volunteers to help the I.opers
and the police in their search
poured in from everywhere; there
were students from dormitories
and fraternities. Boy Scouts, two
bloodhounds belonging to Russ
Cone of Los Gatos, Mounted Pa
trol officers, hot rod club mem
bers and volunteers from Menlo
Park and Palo Alto.
Dr. Loper said last night he
wished "to express my gratitude
to all the Stanford students for
all the time spent" in the search
for his young son.
And Billy, lie said, suffered no
after-effects at all. "In fact," he
added, "he seems to feel even bet
ter than before."
(When contacted over the tele
phone last night. Dr. Loper was
interrupted bv his adventurous
son, who insisted on putting in a
few words. "I'm just twine." he
said, "and can I come over to your
house?" It seems that his esca
pade last Thursday night did not
teach him much about the dan
gers of roving the countryside at
night, i
When Billy was awakened by
the searchers Thursday night he
exclaimed he had seen "a parade,"
which was probably a parade of
searchers and their flashlights
canvassing the hillside.
