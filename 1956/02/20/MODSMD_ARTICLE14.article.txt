Dr. Fr a n k Gerbode and Dr.
Philip Bailey of Stanford Medical
School announced last week that
they have perfected a technique
for performing complicated heart
operations with virtually no anes
thetic.
It consists of using only the
equivalent of two sleeping pills
and pure oxygen, pumped direct
ly to the patient's lungs.
Danger of ordinary anesthetics I
in a heart operation is their ten
dency to slow down heart action j
and make breathing shallow, thus
greatly increasing the danger of J
heart failure while the operation
is in progress.
The two professors do not know j
why the oxygen -barbituate mix-1
ture works, but believe one rea- j
son for the lack of pain without
anesthesia is that the heart is less i
sensitive to pain than other or
gans.
They expressed doubt that the!
technique would work for other)
operations.
