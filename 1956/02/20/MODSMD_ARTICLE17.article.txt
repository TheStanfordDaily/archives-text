# To Save a Life
## 
### 
Search parties, including 300 Stanford stu
dents. scoured the Stanford countryside for sev
eral hours last Thursday night looking for a lost
child. Â«
Almost every able-bodied man and many
women helped in the search. A large propor
tion of the Stanford volunteers were \\ ilbur
freshmen who responded quickly to the call
for searchers.

The volunteers can be justifiably proud of
their efforts which culminated in success when
three-year-old Hilly l.oper was located and re
turned to his parents.
Stanford University can he proud of them
too.
The searchers prowled for hours through
fields in the intense cold of the night and early
morning.
They saved a life.
