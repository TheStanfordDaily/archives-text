Editor, The Daily:
When I first road Mr. Wickland's letter "On
Foreign Critics" I thought that it was a good
letter; he handled it well and to the point. On
second reading one can perceive his decidedly
careful approach to remain "broad-minded"; how
ever, seeing that Mr. Wickland welcomes and
approves criticism, 1 would like to express my
opinions even at the risk of losing the little objec
tivity that he has so kindly ascribed to foreign
critics like myself.
India was the victim of Mr. Wickland's reason
ing; why he chose India is beyond my compre
hension, for although I am not completely pro-
India and her policy I should like to state that
India, as many other new independent Asian
countries, is going through a stage of national
ism.
Neutrality, nationalism and independence is
something we in the West should be proud of; I
shall not go through the periods of U.S. history
to prove my point. Also, as indicated in his letter,
India has preached democracy since 1948 and ap
parently is failing; well, I wonder how long the
U.S. has been preaching (to use his word).
India's cultural background must be taken into
consideration; to change a country in a decade is

impossible; I think the U.S. occupation's attempt
to reform Japan, from the roots, is a good ex
ample but did it succeed?
Mr. Wickland should realize that democracy
can be in different forms; there can be an "Amer
ican Way of Life," a "British Way of Life," an
"Indian Way of Life" and .so on, because most
countries do not have the choice between color
TV and just plain black and white.
Many of us foreign students are fairly objec
tive, although Mr. Wickland has not met us per
sonally. When I leave this country I shall hold it
in the highest esteem; but we should realize that
any great country is going to be criticized and
more so if you have met some of the thousands
of American troops and tourists overseas who
start each sentence off with "Now bark in the
U.S. . .
We realize, or many of us do, that the U.S. is
a great power in most respects, we know also
what she stands for, that is why we criticize—
for we are bargaining on her success.
Finally, the ridiculous statement on the United
Nations and racial differences problem. 1 had
never even thought of the UN intervening in an
internal problem of the U.S., but on second
thought I most probably would back it up—in
the place of "mob rule."

India and her policy I should like to state that
India, as many other new independent Asian
countries, is going through a stage of national
ism.
Neutrality, nationalism and independence is
something we in the West should be proud of; I
shall not go through the periods of U.S. history
to prove my point. Also, as indicated in his letter,
India has preached democracy since 1948 and ap
parently is failing; well, I wonder how long the
U.S. has been preaching (to use his word).
India's cultural background must be taken into
consideration; to change a country in a decade is

impossible; I think the U.S. occupation's attempt
to reform Japan, from the roots, is a good ex
ample but did it succeed?
Mr. Wickland should realize that democracy
can be in different forms; there can be an "Amer
ican Way of Life," a "British Way of Life," an
"Indian Way of Life" and .so on, because most
countries do not have the choice between color
TV and just plain black and white.
Many of us foreign students are fairly objec
tive, although Mr. Wickland has not met us per
sonally. When I leave this country I shall hold it
in the highest esteem; but we should realize that
any great country is going to be criticized and
more so if you have met some of the thousands
of American troops and tourists overseas who
start each sentence off with "Now bark in the
U.S. . .
We realize, or many of us do, that the U.S. is
a great power in most respects, we know also
what she stands for, that is why we criticize—
for we are bargaining on her success.
Finally, the ridiculous statement on the United
Nations and racial differences problem. 1 had
never even thought of the UN intervening in an
internal problem of the U.S., but on second
thought I most probably would back it up—in
the place of "mob rule."

When I first road Mr. Wickland's letter "On
Foreign Critics" I thought that it was a good
letter; he handled it well and to the point. On
second reading one can perceive his decidedly
careful approach to remain "broad-minded"; how
ever, seeing that Mr. Wickland welcomes and
approves criticism, 1 would like to express my
opinions even at the risk of losing the little objec
tivity that he has so kindly ascribed to foreign
critics like myself.
India was the victim of Mr. Wickland's reason
ing; why he chose India is beyond my compre
hension, for although I am not completely pro-
India and her policy I should like to state that
India, as many other new independent Asian
countries, is going through a stage of national
ism.
