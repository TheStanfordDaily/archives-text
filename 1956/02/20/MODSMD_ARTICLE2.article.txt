# Negro Leader Killed Over Private Issue
## Had Nothing to Do With Segregation 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ga.. Feb. 19 (UP)
Authorities investigating the
fatal shooting of Negro civil
rights leader Thomas H. Brewer
said today the killing apparently
grew out of a private dispute and
had nothing to do with the segre
gation issue.
Seventy-two-year-old Brewer, a
local leader in the National Asso
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People and a member of
the State Republican Central
Committee, was fatally wounded
in the office of department store
owner Lucio Flowers last night.
He died on the way to a hospital.
Nervous Condition
Circuit solicitor John Land said
that Flowers was in a bad ner
vous condition following the
shooting and was placed under
guard in the custody of a doctor.
He was later jailed and is being
held without bond on an open
charge until the case has been
further investigated.
Police Capt. J. D. Armstrong
said the shooting apparently grew
out of arguments concerning the
arrest of a "crazy drunk" Negro
in front of Flowers' store 11 days
ago. He said Flowers and Brewer
had several discussions over the
incident and had one telephone
conversation about the case on
the day of the shooting.
Preliminary Investigation
Land said after a preliminary
investigation of the case, "I'd say
that the killing had nothing in
the world to do with the segrega
tion issue. . . ."
N A A C P executive secretary
Hoy Wilkins, in Atlanta for a
regioanl NAACP meeting, said
today "the shooting apparently is
not connected with any NAACP
activity, campaign or issue."
Wilkins praised Brewer as one
of the NAACP's "most valuable
members," but said that he had
been "very outspoken" about seg
regation matters. He called Brew
er "a fearless champion of the
rights of his people."
