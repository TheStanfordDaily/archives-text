The Varsity made some mis
takes hut showed evidences of a
good nucleus that may well de

when catcher Doug Camilli threw
into eenterfield trying to catch
Chuck Essegian stealing. This on
slaught was off Walt Payne, who
opened for Fehring's crew.
Young Rapped
Ray Young came on to pitch
the middle three innings and ran
into deep trouble in the fifth. A
double play had saved him in the

Ray Swarts hit a double to left

and Merriman singled him in.
Jack Shepard lined a two-base hit
to the base of the fence in left,
