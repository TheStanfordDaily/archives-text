# Bowman Modern Art Display Held Over for Another Week
## 
### 
Artist Richard Bowman's painting display currently in the Art Gal
lery will remain for another week, according to Mrs. Helen Cross,
Art Gallery and Museum associate director.
Last Thursday Bowman explained his modern paintings to a large
gathering in the Gallery. He hopes that all students will take time
t/-\ lnnl' of hiL? rlionlai; ..onrl qll —

ro iooK at nis display —ana an
other displays—since he feels an i
art display is just as much a part
of one's education as reading
books.
He deplored the type of person
who hurries back out of an art:
gallery when he sees that the dis-1
play is something with which he :
is unfamiliar.
"Folks at"the turn of the cen-1
tury w.ere just as unfamiliar with
and skeptical of the automobile
as they are of some types of art
today," he noted.
The artist predicted a time
when modern, impressionistic art
will be hung in the average home
just as are the more "photograph
ic" paintings.
Bowman has added explanatory
information next to his paintings
to assist those unfamiliar with
his style.
In some cases he has placed
actual photographs next to paint
ings to show the similarity. He
does this to convince people, who
think art should be photographic
reproductions of nature, that na
ture also assumes forms like
those in modern art.
