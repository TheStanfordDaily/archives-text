## Mem And Capacity Crowd Sees Performance Livened by Many Pranks, Costume Changes 
### Eda Mendels 
The Vienna Choir Boys, who drew enthusiastic applause from their
audience in yesterday's campus concert, seemed to enjoy themselves
just as much presenting the show.
They played before a capacity crowd at Memorial Auditorium.
Frequent costume changes kept them busy between numbers; but

-Ihe 22 youngsters, all "between 9
and 11 years old, found time to
play around with their friends.
Of course, someone would tickle
a stockinged foot when so many
were around.
Changing from T-shirts to mid
fly blouses was quickly done.
When two sturdy children
brought in a trunk with bags of
shoe polish, they fell to putting
gloss on their shoes.
Donned Dresses
After the staid opening songs,
the boys presented a rollicking
S t r a usa operetta in costume.
Some donned ladies' dresses, had
the nurse adjust their wigs and
they were set set to wrestle with
the stage manager. And members
of lhe bakers' chorus tossed I heir
prop bread gaily overhead, for
want of a better ball.
In the wings, activity was just
as varied. Several took turns at
Indian wrestling with Harry, the
bus driver, in the interval between
their appearances. Another had a
fine time imitating a slide trom
bone during a few stirring meas
ures.
lOcho Song
Mitzi, heroine of the operetta,
I found time to pull up "her" stock
ings between singing and curtain
I calls. During the echo song one
of the "echoes" in the wings non
chalantly combed his hair while
singing the intricate measures in
! perfect time.
The comb proved a versatile in
strument. It was fine for poking
into someone's ribs.
