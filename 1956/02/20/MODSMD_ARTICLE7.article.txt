# Dean's Removal of Post-barricades Calms Rebellious Toyon Residents
## 
### 
Rebellious Toyon residents, all set to storm the post-barri
cades which the University last week placed in the rodd running
behind the eating clubs, were mollified Friday night when sooth
ing Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler ordered the two center
posts removed "pending further study."
The fracas began last week when clubmen noticed the Corp
Yard digging holes in their road, preparatory to putting in the
familiar white posts with red reflectors.
As a diversionary action, the clubmen dragged, pushed and
pulled a worn-out truck from the field behind the clubs, placed it
neatly over the post-holes and deflated the tires.
The next day, the Corp Yard, after pondering the situation,
moved about 20 yards down the road and proceeded to dig more
holes. Before the clubmen.could think up suitable retaliation, the
Yard had inserted the posts in the new holes, removed the truck
from the first ones, inserted posts there and placed a policeman
on guard.
Their dander aroused, the clubmen charged from their Thurs
day night dinner and, under watchful eyes of the man in blue,
ignited one of the posts with a smudge-pot. The post, like the
clubmen, blazed furiously.
So did the policeman, and the Thursday evening episode ended
with the flames out and the clubmen plotting in their Toyon
rooms.
Being Stanford men, their plot was in keeping with Stanford
traditions—"Give 'em |the posts| the Axe."
And it was here that Dean Winbigler entered and the two
center posts left.
As things now stand, the Administration is giving the matter
"further consideration," the clubmen are waiting watchfully and
the posts have a noticeable gap in the middle.
