# Winbigler Gives Stanford Position On Hazing Issue
## 
### 
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler gave the following
statement to United Press con
cerning the problem of hazing,
which culminated last week in
the drowning of Thomas L. Clark,
a student at Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology and initiate
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, when he
fell through thin ice after being
dropped on a country r6ad by fra
ternity members:
"Hazing has been outlawed for
years at Stanford. Fraternity ini
tiations have been restricted to
the house and grounds of the fra
ternity because of just such inci
dents as occurred at MIT; because
of an incident in which a boy lost
his life four or five years ago
over in Berkeley when he was
taken out on a road at night and
was struck by a car walking back.
"We have occasional minor in
fractions, but when they occur,
the fraternity is penalized by the
Inter Fraternily Council judiciary
council."
National council of Delta Kap
pa Epsilon in New York said it
has demanded that its chapters
henceforth confine initiation ac
tivities to fraternity houses.
