# Stanford's Nine to Battle COP Today—Bar Rain
## Seven 1955 Returnees To Lead Farm Club 
### 
With a veteran team paced by
seven 1955 returnees, Stanford's
talent-laden baseball team will
host College of the Pacific this
afternoon at 3:15 in Sunken Dia
mond if it doesn't rain.
Admission is free. Leading the
diamond men in quest of their
first win of the season will be
flashy third baseman Rudy Figu
eroa.
Last season Figueroa, a left
handed hitter, batted .374 and won
Stanford's most valuable player
award. Resides his skill with the
wood, the Los Angeles ball player
boasts a rifle arm.
Other probable starters include
Bob Flanders, shortstop; Al Shaw,
second base; Hal Messner, first
base; Doug Camilli, catcher; and
Rob Evan s, Rob Fletcher and
Mickey Holzman, outfield.
For pitcher, Coach Dutch Fehr
ign has his choice of either Ray
Looney, Dick Jones, Walt Payne,
Ed Verdurmen or Ray Young.
Payne, Young and Verdurmen
worked Saturday in the Indians'
5-5 tie willi a professional-packed
Alumni team.
According to PCC observers,
Payne and Young are the top
pitching pair on the coast. Rut
the two may be tired after their
respective three-inning stints Sat
urday.
Reside Figueroa, Evans, Fletch
er, Holzman, Messner, Payne and
Young are returnees from the
1955 Card nine.
Holzman and Fletcher alternat
ed at second base and shortstop
last year. This year the speedy
duo are ranging far and wide over
the pastures of center and right
field respectively.
Holzman is a speed merchant
centerfielder of the old style. As
a trackman in high school in
Portland, Oregon, he flicked off
a 100-yard dash in under 10 sec
onds.
Three of the members of Coach
Fehring's starting lineup are
sophomores. Bob Flanders, the
leading frosh hitter last year with
a .400 batting average high for
a shortstop—is playing his old po
sition for the varsity.
Completing a sophomore key
stone combination, A 1 Shaw is
holding sway as the starting sec
ond-sacker.
On last year's frosh nine Shaw
slapped out a lusty .345. In Satur
day's alumni game he showed
promise by teaming with Flan
ders to make a double play and
by holding stealing home to score
the tying run in the seventh in
ning.
The other sophomore in the
starting lineup is catcher Doug
Camilli. Carnilli caught seven in
n i ii g s Saturday in his varsity
debut.
