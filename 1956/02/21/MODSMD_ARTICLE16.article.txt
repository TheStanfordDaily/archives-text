Great Reluctance
The action was taken by the
Board of Trustees with great re
luctance, President Sterling said.
Increases were made necessary
by continued high costs of medi
cal education and an expanding
teaching program in the business
school.
Medical School Dean Dr. Wind
sor C. Cutting explained: "The
cost of the School of Medicine is
very expensive. Books, laborato
ries and equipment offer expcirli
tures that no other department
has to worry about.
"The tuition by no means pa\
for the full cost of a Medical
School education. It only pays
one-sixth."
The raise in the tuition h-ts
nothing to do with the foi 1
ing cost of moving the Med School
to Stanford, Cutting said.
No Comment
Business School Dean j. Tlu -h
Jackson had no comment on Ie
increase, but assistant to the pp
ident Frederic O. Glover said 'he
new business school funds would
be used to "broaden the instrm
tional program and operation" of
the school.
A considerable portion of the
increased tuition will be award "I
in 1956-57 student scholarships .for
the two schools, President Vei
ling pointed out.
The last rise in tuition at Stan
ford occurred in the fall of 1.9 m,
when all fees were increased $30
a quarter.
No further tuition increases re
contemplated at this time.
