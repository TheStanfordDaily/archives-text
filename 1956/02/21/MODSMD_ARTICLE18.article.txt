# 'A Little Less Ballast and We'd Have Cleared It'
## A 						Judicious Veto 
### 
Last week Congress threw off on the Presi
dent the natural gas "hot potato,but sure
as a boomerang, the controversial hill re
turned as hot as ever to the chambers on Capi
tol Hill.
The hill, shrouded in corruption and signs of
ugly pressure politics, was vetoed by President
Kisenhower who called the lobby tactics em
ployed in its passage "so arrogant and so much
in defiance of acceptable standards of propriety
as to creating doubt among the American

people concerning the integrity of governmen
tal processes."
Kisenhower objected, not because of the eon
tent of the bill, hut rather because he felt he
could not fairly approve legislation when (ion
gress was still scrutinizing the legality and eth
ics of the methods used in its passage.
Kisenhower is to be commended for his de
mand for justice in the legislative process and
(Congress should be urged to eliminate such
blatant defiances of legal integrity on the part
of pressure groups.
