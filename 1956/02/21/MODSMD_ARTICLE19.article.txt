## Fight Continues for Daily Texan Independence; Other Papers Join In 
### Sally Trapnell 
Th*-. battle over freedom of the press contin
ues at the University of Texas, although one
regent declares the only question is compliance
with state law. He referred to a section of the
Texas legal code that says the Daily Texan may
not be used to influence the outcome of any
electi(fh.
The Board of Regents says that Texan edi
torial policy has not been "balanced" and has
been detrimental to the university in several
instances. Among the issues named were edi
torial comment on the Fulbriglit-Harris bill
and an attack on Texas oil and gas interests.
Two other student papers have joined the
paper in fighting for a free editorial policy, but
these are under attack from fellow students.

At the University of North Carolina the co
editors of the Daily Tar Heel face a recall elec
tion. They are charged with "grossly misrepre
senting the views of the student body."
The paper has attacked editorially such poli
cies as the barring of Negro undergraduates,
big-time athletics and the leadership of the
university's student government.
Defenders of the paper charge that the stu
dent body president and his attorney general
are attempting to get control of the paper.
* * ,*
At Louisiana State, student politicians also
want a hand in the paper's editorial policy.
The student senate recently voted to censure
the paper for not devoting enough space to ac
tivities such as the agricultural convocation.
They would also like to dictate how the stories
are written and where they appear in the paper.

I he February edition of the Pelican, Uni
versity of California humor magazine, has come
under attack for its "off-color tinge." In a re

view the Daily Californian said "the issue is the
lnimor magazine's dirtiest, hut not its clever
est."
The reviewer found the only "clean" 1 stories
weren't the least bit funny. He decided it was
up to the dean's office to decide whether thp
Pelican was in poor taste.

At Syracuse University the administration
evidently found the humor magazine too much
to put up with. The publications hoard has
censored it and put it under faculty supervision.
This action has residted in student protest
and a great increase in sales.

Students at lowa State College are undergo
ing a quiz concerning a dynamite bomb found
in one of the women's dormitories. A note, left
with the time bomb, indicated it was meant to
he found before explosion.
The bomb, containing five sticks of dynamite,
was found by a janitor when a car horn rigged
to the device sounded, waking him up.

UCLA's IFC Council has followed the lead
of I'anhellenic in withdrawing from the Asso
ciated Students group. IFC feels the effort it
has put into the organization does not equal the
benefits received.
The move was based on ASUCLA's desire to
examine racial exclusion clauses in fraternity
constitutions.
Although IFC says it will continue to support
student, council activities, Associated Students
says it will henceforth exclude the groups from
its functions.
The Creeks will also be denied the right to
use the Daily Bruin for notices. This may wreak
havoc on the Bruin social page which has pre
viously used sorority activities as one of its
main features.
