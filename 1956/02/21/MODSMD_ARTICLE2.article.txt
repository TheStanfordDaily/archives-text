# Traffic Com Wants Opening Of Los Arboles
## Traffic Snarls Caused By Los Arboles Closing 
### 
In an effort to unsnarl Stan
ford's growing traffic problem,
Legislature last week passed a
recommendation to the University
administration that Los Arboi<js
Road be reopened to through traf
fic.
.'This load, passing Lagurjlta
Court and the Women's Gymna
sium, has been closed to through
traffic since the beginning of au
tumn quarter when Iho police de
partment decided to take action to
protect Lagunita and Roblc wom
en, especially those crossing the
street to the Wofnen's Gymna
sium.

Bob Maddock, whose Student
Traffic Committee formulated the
proposals, argues that closure of
the road creates an additional
traffic problem in that all cars
moving on and off campus are
now forced to travel on only four
roads Palm Drive, Eseondido,
Galvez and Lasuen (the Row).
Cars leaving campus for the
area behind Stanford are now
forced to use the Row, causing
further congestion at the post of
fice.
< Congestion
Congestion in front of Lagu
nita, the traffic committee argues,
is increased under the present
system since many cars going to
Lagunita on their way off campus
are forced to turn around and
come back through campus.
The women at Lagunita, Mad
dock adds, do not seem to appre
ciate the "protection" they are
receiving. In a poll taken last
quarter, only one-ninth of Lagu
nita's residents wanted the road
kept closed.
Answering the objection to
heavy commercial vehicles trav
eling down Los Arholes to deliver
supplies to Lagunita and Roblc.
Maddock says they must now go
down Palm Drive or Galvez, tying
up traffic and helping to tear up
campus roads.
Traffic Com
Student Traffic Commit Ie e
feels that off-campus students
and commercial vehicles coming
onto campus through back roads
have official business and should
not be penalized into going an
extra mile by another route.
Students, Maddock warns, do
not always obey the traffic bar
riers. often squeezing around the
road block or passing behind the
Red Barn.
Student Traffic Committee was
established as a non-permanent,
non-subsidized fact finding board
by ASSU President George Ralph
early in autumn quarter in re
sponse to requests by Maddock
and others that such a committee
be set up.
