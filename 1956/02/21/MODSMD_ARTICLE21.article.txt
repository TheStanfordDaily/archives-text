## Foreign Students Comment on India 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
1 have been reading with in
terest "Letters to the Editor" in
The Daily. There lias developed a
controversy over the racial prob
lem in American universities in
these letters. Mr. Brian Wiekland
has done well to answer Ihe criti
cism of the foreign students about
the problem.
But he could have done il better
had he pointed out how America
and American people are trying
and making all efforts to solve
the problem instead of telling the
critics that they are not better off
regarding the same problem.
I would have, therefore, liked
him to point out to the foreign
students the efforts made by vari
ous organizations like Civil Lib
erty, etc., to solve the problem as
it has been done to some extent
by the San Francisco Examiner
daily of lGth Feb. in its editorial.
Mr. Brian Wiekland is offended
by criticism made by certain coun
tries like Russia and India. So far
as I know, India does not criticize
other nations except when she
thinks that certain fundamental
issues of peace, imperialism or
racial discrimination are involved
which may lead to disturbance of
world peace.
I would admit that in India we
have caste-system and untoucha
bility. But I would like to point
out that they are fast disappear
ing by the efforts we are making
to remove the discrimination—-
1. Caste and untouchability are
not recognized by the Constitu
tion—every adult, has the right to
vote.
2. By law it is an offense to
practice untouchability.
3. All tefnples of worship are
thrown open to all, even for the
untouchables.
4. in the schools there is no dis
crimination nor segregation for
the untouchables- all children sit
together for studies.
5. The Government has made
special laws to raise the social
status of the untouchables by giv
ing them certain privileges. The
untouchables can get free educa
tion at all levels.
All state governments and the
federal government give prefer
ence to the untouchable candidate
in the appointments made for gov
ernment posts. Every state has
one untouchable as a minister in
the state government.
In the federal government, the
Minister for Transport and Com
munication is an untouchable. Af
ter independence our Constitu
tion was framed by a law minis
ter who was himself an untouch
able. These are some of the ef
forts made in India to remove the
evils existing in our society.
India has also accepted the
United Nations Charter of Human
Rights and therefore would any
time welcome the United Nations
representative to investigate how
far we adhere to our commit
ments.
I disagree with Mr. Brian Wiek
land when he considers the prob
lem of racial discrimination as an
internal problem of the country.
It is a human problem against
which the United Nations has
unanimously passed a resolution

in respect to the South African
government.
1 do not intend to criticize nor
enter into controversy, but only
want to remove misunderstanding
and misinformation.
Kanli Vyas
Editor. The Daily:
1 have been reading all the let
ters that have appeared in your
columns during the past Iwo
weeks pertaining to racial segre
gation in some parts of this coun
try. Both American and foreign
students have freely expressed
and exchanged views on this issue
and it is encouraging to note that
most of them are, at least in prin
ciple, opposed to the existence of
segregation in a democratic sys
tem.
In this context, Mr. Brian Wiek
land (The Daily, Feb. Hi) has
lightly drawn attention to the
complex system of castes and un
touchability in India. I am from
India and I myself have often at
tempted to draw a parallel be
tween Ihe caste system in the In
dian society and racial discrimi
nation in some parts of this coun
try.
It should be mentioned, how
ever, thai Ihe caste system is not
based on racial origin or color,
but it is an ancient and outmoded
socio-religious system. Whatever
tlie origin, all fair-minded people
agree that both the caste system
and racial discrimination are un
democratic in principle and there
fore should have no place either
in India or in this country, both
of which profess to be true de
mocracies striving for equal
rights for all.
Both countries have more or
less outlawed such discrimination,
but it is apparent in both that the
people-at-large are slow to over
come ihe prejudice of caste or
color.
As for criticism, it is perhaps
true that India has believed in the
free exchange of criticisms in all
matters both within the country
as well as in the international
sphere. Such criticism, I think,
has been made in good faith and
was never meant to be an article
of commodity either for export or
import.
It is to be hoped that il will not
be long before conservatism in
both of the countries will yield
place to a liberal attitude toward
caste or race, not out of a fear of
loss of prestige abroad but as an
outcome of realization of the prin
ciple of basic human rights and
equality.
C. S. Veiikaiesh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a piece
of misinformation recently given
about the Indian caste system by
Mr. Wiekland while discussing
the racial problem. It seems that
he is not well informed about
present conditions as regards the
caste system and the untoucha
bility in India.
Caste system, as it existed in
the past, was intended for division
of the masses into different
tions of society, principally on
the basis of profession that one
used to do. In modern India the

basis of this division is recognized
no more both by the law and by
Ihe public spirit.
Every individual has complete
freedom of expression and equal
opportunity in all walks of life:
be it ihe social relations, educa
tion, or profession. Caste system
exists no more!
Same is the case with the prob
lem of untouchables- a section of
society that was not offered all
the benefits of common life. The
problem was none the less chal
lenging than the racial problem
is to this great nation of yours.
But I am giad to inform Mr. Wick
land that untouchability, toward
arry section of society, is a crime
punishable by the law.
Equality in all spheres of life is
guaranteed by the Indian Consti
tution. Besides, people who suf
fered inequality in the past are
offered certain special privileges
by the central and the state gov
ernments.
I hope that this small piece of
clarification will serve its purpose
and give the readers of this col
umn the facts that exist in the
modern India.

has been made in good faith and
was never meant to be an article
of commodity either for export or
import.
It is to be hoped that il will not
be long before conservatism in
both of the countries will yield
place to a liberal attitude toward
caste or race, not out of a fear of
loss of prestige abroad but as an
outcome of realization of the prin

equality.
C. S. Veiikaiesh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a piece
of misinformation recently given
about the Indian caste system by
Mr. Wiekland while discussing
the racial problem. It seems that
he is not well informed about
present conditions as regards the
caste system and the untoucha
bility in India.
Caste system, as it existed in
the past, was intended for division
of the masses into different
tions of society, principally on
the basis of profession that one
used to do. In modern India the

basis of this division is recognized
no more both by the law and by
Ihe public spirit.
Every individual has complete
freedom of expression and equal
opportunity in all walks of life:
be it ihe social relations, educa
tion, or profession. Caste system
exists no more!
Same is the case with the prob
lem of untouchables- a section of
society that was not offered all
the benefits of common life. The
problem was none the less chal
lenging than the racial problem
is to this great nation of yours.
But I am giad to inform Mr. Wick
land that untouchability, toward
arry section of society, is a crime
punishable by the law.
Equality in all spheres of life is
guaranteed by the Indian Consti
tution. Besides, people who suf
fered inequality in the past are
offered certain special privileges
by the central and the state gov
ernments.
I hope that this small piece of
clarification will serve its purpose
and give the readers of this col
umn the facts that exist in the
modern India.

Editor, The Daily:
1 have been reading with in
terest "Letters to the Editor" in
The Daily. There lias developed a
controversy over the racial prob
lem in American universities in
these letters. Mr. Brian Wiekland
has done well to answer Ihe criti
cism of the foreign students about
the problem.
But he could have done il better
had he pointed out how America
and American people are trying
and making all efforts to solve
the problem instead of telling the
critics that they are not better off
regarding the same problem.
I would have, therefore, liked
him to point out to the foreign
students the efforts made by vari
ous organizations like Civil Lib
erty, etc., to solve the problem as
it has been done to some extent
by the San Francisco Examiner
daily of lGth Feb. in its editorial.
Mr. Brian Wiekland is offended
by criticism made by certain coun
tries like Russia and India. So far
as I know, India does not criticize
other nations except when she
thinks that certain fundamental
issues of peace, imperialism or
racial discrimination are involved
which may lead to disturbance of
world peace.
I would admit that in India we
have caste-system and untoucha
bility. But I would like to point
out that they are fast disappear
ing by the efforts we are making
to remove the discrimination—-
1. Caste and untouchability are
not recognized by the Constitu
tion—every adult, has the right to
vote.
2. By law it is an offense to
practice untouchability.
3. All tefnples of worship are
thrown open to all, even for the
untouchables.
4. in the schools there is no dis
crimination nor segregation for
the untouchables- all children sit
together for studies.
5. The Government has made
special laws to raise the social
status of the untouchables by giv
ing them certain privileges. The
untouchables can get free educa
tion at all levels.
All state governments and the
federal government give prefer
ence to the untouchable candidate
in the appointments made for gov
ernment posts. Every state has
one untouchable as a minister in
the state government.
In the federal government, the
Minister for Transport and Com
munication is an untouchable. Af
ter independence our Constitu
tion was framed by a law minis
ter who was himself an untouch
able. These are some of the ef
forts made in India to remove the
evils existing in our society.
India has also accepted the
United Nations Charter of Human
Rights and therefore would any
time welcome the United Nations
representative to investigate how
far we adhere to our commit
ments.
I disagree with Mr. Brian Wiek
land when he considers the prob
lem of racial discrimination as an
internal problem of the country.
It is a human problem against
which the United Nations has
unanimously passed a resolution

in respect to the South African
government.
1 do not intend to criticize nor
enter into controversy, but only
want to remove misunderstanding
and misinformation.
Kanli Vyas
Editor. The Daily:
1 have been reading all the let
ters that have appeared in your
columns during the past Iwo
weeks pertaining to racial segre
gation in some parts of this coun
try. Both American and foreign
students have freely expressed
and exchanged views on this issue
and it is encouraging to note that
most of them are, at least in prin
ciple, opposed to the existence of
segregation in a democratic sys
tem.
In this context, Mr. Brian Wiek
land (The Daily, Feb. Hi) has
lightly drawn attention to the
complex system of castes and un
touchability in India. I am from
India and I myself have often at
tempted to draw a parallel be
tween Ihe caste system in the In
dian society and racial discrimi
nation in some parts of this coun
try.
It should be mentioned, how
ever, thai Ihe caste system is not
based on racial origin or color,
but it is an ancient and outmoded
socio-religious system. Whatever
tlie origin, all fair-minded people
agree that both the caste system
and racial discrimination are un
democratic in principle and there
fore should have no place either
in India or in this country, both
of which profess to be true de
mocracies striving for equal
rights for all.
Both countries have more or
less outlawed such discrimination,
but it is apparent in both that the
people-at-large are slow to over
come ihe prejudice of caste or
color.
As for criticism, it is perhaps
true that India has believed in the
free exchange of criticisms in all
matters both within the country
as well as in the international
sphere. Such criticism, I think,
has been made in good faith and
was never meant to be an article
of commodity either for export or

internal problem of the country.
It is a human problem against
which the United Nations has

Kanli Vyas
Editor. The Daily:
1 have been reading all the let
ters that have appeared in your
columns during the past Iwo
weeks pertaining to racial segre
gation in some parts of this coun
try. Both American and foreign
students have freely expressed
and exchanged views on this issue
and it is encouraging to note that
most of them are, at least in prin
ciple, opposed to the existence of
segregation in a democratic sys
tem.
In this context, Mr. Brian Wiek
land (The Daily, Feb. Hi) has
lightly drawn attention to the
complex system of castes and un
touchability in India. I am from
India and I myself have often at
tempted to draw a parallel be
tween Ihe caste system in the In
dian society and racial discrimi
nation in some parts of this coun
try.
It should be mentioned, how
ever, thai Ihe caste system is not
based on racial origin or color,
but it is an ancient and outmoded
socio-religious system. Whatever
tlie origin, all fair-minded people
agree that both the caste system
and racial discrimination are un
democratic in principle and there
fore should have no place either
in India or in this country, both
of which profess to be true de
mocracies striving for equal
rights for all.
Both countries have more or
less outlawed such discrimination,
but it is apparent in both that the
people-at-large are slow to over
come ihe prejudice of caste or
color.
As for criticism, it is perhaps
true that India has believed in the
free exchange of criticisms in all
matters both within the country
as well as in the international
sphere. Such criticism, I think,
has been made in good faith and
was never meant to be an article
of commodity either for export or
import.
It is to be hoped that il will not
be long before conservatism in
both of the countries will yield
place to a liberal attitude toward
caste or race, not out of a fear of
loss of prestige abroad but as an
outcome of realization of the prin
ciple of basic human rights and
equality.
C. S. Veiikaiesh

I would like to correct a piece
of misinformation recently given
about the Indian caste system by
Mr. Wiekland while discussing
the racial problem. It seems that
he is not well informed about
present conditions as regards the
caste system and the untoucha
bility in India.
Caste system, as it existed in
the past, was intended for division
of the masses into different
tions of society, principally on
the basis of profession that one
used to do. In modern India the

basis of this division is recognized
no more both by the law and by
Ihe public spirit.
Every individual has complete
freedom of expression and equal
opportunity in all walks of life:
be it ihe social relations, educa
tion, or profession. Caste system
exists no more!
Same is the case with the prob
lem of untouchables- a section of
society that was not offered all
the benefits of common life. The
problem was none the less chal
lenging than the racial problem
is to this great nation of yours.
But I am giad to inform Mr. Wick
land that untouchability, toward
arry section of society, is a crime
punishable by the law.
Equality in all spheres of life is
guaranteed by the Indian Consti
tution. Besides, people who suf
fered inequality in the past are
offered certain special privileges
by the central and the state gov
ernments.
I hope that this small piece of
clarification will serve its purpose
and give the readers of this col
umn the facts that exist in the
modern India.

Editor, The Daily:
1 have been reading with in
terest "Letters to the Editor" in
The Daily. There lias developed a
controversy over the racial prob
lem in American universities in
these letters. Mr. Brian Wiekland
has done well to answer Ihe criti
cism of the foreign students about
the problem.
But he could have done il better
had he pointed out how America
and American people are trying
and making all efforts to solve
the problem instead of telling the
critics that they are not better off
regarding the same problem.
I would have, therefore, liked
him to point out to the foreign
students the efforts made by vari
ous organizations like Civil Lib
erty, etc., to solve the problem as
it has been done to some extent
by the San Francisco Examiner
daily of lGth Feb. in its editorial.
Mr. Brian Wiekland is offended
by criticism made by certain coun
tries like Russia and India. So far
as I know, India does not criticize
other nations except when she
thinks that certain fundamental
issues of peace, imperialism or
racial discrimination are involved
which may lead to disturbance of
world peace.
I would admit that in India we
have caste-system and untoucha
bility. But I would like to point
out that they are fast disappear
ing by the efforts we are making
to remove the discrimination—-
1. Caste and untouchability are
not recognized by the Constitu
tion—every adult, has the right to
vote.
2. By law it is an offense to
practice untouchability.
3. All tefnples of worship are
thrown open to all, even for the
untouchables.
4. in the schools there is no dis
crimination nor segregation for
the untouchables- all children sit
together for studies.
5. The Government has made
special laws to raise the social
status of the untouchables by giv
ing them certain privileges. The
untouchables can get free educa
tion at all levels.
All state governments and the
federal government give prefer
ence to the untouchable candidate
in the appointments made for gov
ernment posts. Every state has
one untouchable as a minister in
the state government.
In the federal government, the
Minister for Transport and Com
munication is an untouchable. Af
ter independence our Constitu
tion was framed by a law minis
ter who was himself an untouch
able. These are some of the ef
forts made in India to remove the
evils existing in our society.
India has also accepted the
United Nations Charter of Human
Rights and therefore would any
time welcome the United Nations
representative to investigate how
far we adhere to our commit
ments.

erty, etc., to solve the problem as
it has been done to some extent
by the San Francisco Examiner
daily of lGth Feb. in its editorial.
Mr. Brian Wiekland is offended
by criticism made by certain coun
tries like Russia and India. So far
as I know, India does not criticize
other nations except when she
thinks that certain fundamental
issues of peace, imperialism or
racial discrimination are involved
which may lead to disturbance of
world peace.
I would admit that in India we
have caste-system and untoucha
bility. But I would like to point
out that they are fast disappear
ing by the efforts we are making
to remove the discrimination—-
1. Caste and untouchability are
not recognized by the Constitu
tion—every adult, has the right to
vote.
2. By law it is an offense to
practice untouchability.
3. All tefnples of worship are
thrown open to all, even for the
untouchables.
4. in the schools there is no dis
crimination nor segregation for
the untouchables- all children sit
together for studies.
5. The Government has made
special laws to raise the social
status of the untouchables by giv
ing them certain privileges. The
untouchables can get free educa
tion at all levels.
All state governments and the
federal government give prefer
ence to the untouchable candidate
in the appointments made for gov
ernment posts. Every state has
one untouchable as a minister in
the state government.
In the federal government, the
Minister for Transport and Com
munication is an untouchable. Af
ter independence our Constitu
tion was framed by a law minis
ter who was himself an untouch
able. These are some of the ef
forts made in India to remove the
evils existing in our society.
India has also accepted the
United Nations Charter of Human
Rights and therefore would any
time welcome the United Nations
representative to investigate how
far we adhere to our commit
ments.
I disagree with Mr. Brian Wiek
land when he considers the prob
lem of racial discrimination as an
internal problem of the country.
It is a human problem against
which the United Nations has
unanimously passed a resolution

in respect to the South African
government.
1 do not intend to criticize nor
enter into controversy, but only
want to remove misunderstanding
and misinformation.

Editor. The Daily:
1 have been reading all the let
ters that have appeared in your
columns during the past Iwo
weeks pertaining to racial segre
gation in some parts of this coun
try. Both American and foreign
students have freely expressed
and exchanged views on this issue
and it is encouraging to note that
most of them are, at least in prin
ciple, opposed to the existence of
segregation in a democratic sys
tem.
In this context, Mr. Brian Wiek
land (The Daily, Feb. Hi) has
lightly drawn attention to the
complex system of castes and un
touchability in India. I am from
India and I myself have often at
tempted to draw a parallel be
tween Ihe caste system in the In
dian society and racial discrimi
nation in some parts of this coun
try.
It should be mentioned, how
ever, thai Ihe caste system is not
based on racial origin or color,
but it is an ancient and outmoded
socio-religious system. Whatever
tlie origin, all fair-minded people
agree that both the caste system
and racial discrimination are un
democratic in principle and there
fore should have no place either
in India or in this country, both
of which profess to be true de
mocracies striving for equal
rights for all.
Both countries have more or
less outlawed such discrimination,
but it is apparent in both that the
people-at-large are slow to over
come ihe prejudice of caste or
color.
As for criticism, it is perhaps
true that India has believed in the
free exchange of criticisms in all
matters both within the country
as well as in the international
sphere. Such criticism, I think,
has been made in good faith and
was never meant to be an article
of commodity either for export or
import.
It is to be hoped that il will not
be long before conservatism in
both of the countries will yield
place to a liberal attitude toward
caste or race, not out of a fear of
loss of prestige abroad but as an
outcome of realization of the prin
ciple of basic human rights and
equality.
C. S. Veiikaiesh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a piece
of misinformation recently given
about the Indian caste system by
Mr. Wiekland while discussing
the racial problem. It seems that
he is not well informed about
present conditions as regards the
caste system and the untoucha
bility in India.
Caste system, as it existed in
the past, was intended for division
of the masses into different
tions of society, principally on
the basis of profession that one
used to do. In modern India the

basis of this division is recognized
no more both by the law and by
Ihe public spirit.
Every individual has complete
freedom of expression and equal
opportunity in all walks of life:
be it ihe social relations, educa
tion, or profession. Caste system
exists no more!
Same is the case with the prob
lem of untouchables- a section of
society that was not offered all
the benefits of common life. The
problem was none the less chal
lenging than the racial problem
is to this great nation of yours.
But I am giad to inform Mr. Wick
land that untouchability, toward
arry section of society, is a crime
punishable by the law.
Equality in all spheres of life is
guaranteed by the Indian Consti
tution. Besides, people who suf
fered inequality in the past are
offered certain special privileges
by the central and the state gov
ernments.
I hope that this small piece of
clarification will serve its purpose
and give the readers of this col
umn the facts that exist in the
modern India.
