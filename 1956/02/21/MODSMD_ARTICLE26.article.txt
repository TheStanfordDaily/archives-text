# Cardinal Swimmers Slaughter Spartans, Break Three Marks
## Tom Burton, Doug Ackerman and Cole Wilbur Smash Records in Stifling San Jose Stronghold 
### John Weiser 
The varsity swim lenm handily breezed by San Jose State, 52-32, in
a dual meet last weekend in tiie losers' pool as Coach Tom Haynie's
water wonders broke three pool records.
Leading the natators was versatile Tom Burton. Burton captured
first place in the two most grueling events, the 440-yard freestyle and
the 200-yard individual medley. — ——

In the latter race Burton set a
new pool standard. The finish of
the 440 was close as Stanford's
distance ace Tad Devine made a
last - minute splurge for second
place. Other mermen to set marks
were Doug Aekerman and Colo
Wilbur.
Wilbur made garnering the 200-
yard breast-stroke mark look ri
diculously easy. Aekerman lower
ed the 100-yard free-style stand
ard.
Although the results of the
meet were a success, some indi
vidual performances were lesson
ed by the stifling atmosphere at
the Spartan stronghold.
The heat evidently didn't bother
Carver Nixon and "Jaguar" Moore
too much as they won first places
in their respective events.

In the 200-yard free-style again
a supreme effort by Tad Devine
pushed Moore across the line in
first place. Nixon was followed
closely in the 50-yard sprint by
Phil Cay.
The power-house Indian relay
team, composed of Aekerman,
Moore, Nixon and Cay, was dis
qualified on a missed turn by
Nixon. Their time, if qualified,
would have placed among the top
two times in the nation in this
event.
Coach Haynie was pleased with
his team's performance, but he
related, "There is a lot more work
to be done before we'll be ready
for Yale next month."
The first opportunity Stanford
rooters will have to see their team
in action will be on March 9. On
that date the mermen will host
the national junior college cham
pions, Fuller-ton's swimmers, in a
dual meet at Encina Pool.
