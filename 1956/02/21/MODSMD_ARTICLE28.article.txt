### Jim Price 
Behind the second-half scoring of John Pflueger, the Stanford Frosh
eked out another win, G3-Gl, over City College of San Francisco for
their ninth consecutive victory.
The Frosh, who are beginning to copy USF, led 38-29 at half-time,
but fell behind with only eight minutes remaining. But Pflueger, who

racked up 11 second-half markers,-
and Doug Warren stuffed in a
trio of buckets to rebuild the Pa
poose lead.
Clarence "The Goose" Grider,
former All-Northern California
high school star from San Fran
cisco, nearly pulled his CCSF
teammates 1o a come-from-behind
win.
Glider had poured in 10 points
in (lie first half on jump shots
and tips. He struck quickly in the
second half, pouring in 11 more.
Grider was high scorer for the
night with his 21 markers. Pflue
ger of the Papooses tallied 15.
Starts Fast
The contest started on the same
rapid pace that it ended on. Grider
stuffed in six quick points while
the Rams took an early lead.
The Frosh. though, stayed with-
I in firing distance on the shooting
jof forward Di e k Haga. Haga
! scored all 13 of his points in the
j first half.
A splurge in the last few mo
! ments gave thg Papooses their
' nine-point intermission lead.
When lanky Grider took the
opening tip of the second half and
rammed in a lay-in, it seemed as
if the Rams were going to run
away with the game.
Within three minutes City Col
lege had pulled to a one-point lead
| nn a lay-in by guard A 1 Mock,
| for mer high school teammate of
, Grider. The hustling guard was a
; pain to the Frosh all evening as
he sparkled at "ball-hawking and
I scored 13 points.
Pflueger Hits
After this short lead, John Pflu
t cger took over and by himself
pulled the Frosh back in front on
: a driving lay-in and three free
throws. But Grider dropped in
I three fast buckets and the score
' was knotted at 47-47.
Coach Dick Cleg g inserted
| Doug Warren at this point, and
ihe Papoose guard, a deadly
' threat from.outside, changed the
tide by hitting on two long jumps
and a 30-foot set shot in a three
minute period.
| It was his 30-footer that gave
| the Frosh the lead for keeps at
I 55-53.

The action was furious in ihe
final two minutes as the CCSFers
fought to close the six-point gap.
But in the fight to get the ball,
two costly fouls were committed
by the Rams and Brent Leonard
sank a pair of free throws.
It is beginning to look as if the
Frosh are going to continue their
win streak for some time. But,
unlike the USF champs, they
seem intent on making their wins
as close as possible.
