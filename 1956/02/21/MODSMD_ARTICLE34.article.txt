# Dupas Gains Split Verdict Over Khalfi
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 20
(UP) Lightweight Ralph Dupas
was artistry on canvas before a
home-town crowd of 8,000 tonight
as he harassed and battered
Frenchman Hoeine Khalfi to gain
a split. 10-round decision.
Dupas, four-ranked nationally,
abandoned his stock-in-trade of
speed frequently to mix in fast
slugging action.
