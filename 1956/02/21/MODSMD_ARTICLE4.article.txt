# Negro Music Is Interpreted By Dr. George
## Discussion on Negro Problem to to Be Today 
### 
"Negro spirituals are historical
documents," notqd singer and so
ciologist Dr. Zelma George said
yesterday afternoon at Cubberley
Auditorium.
Dr. George will hold a question
session of all aspects of the Negro
situation today at II a.m. in Me
morial Auditorium. The meeting
will be open to the public.
Using Negro spirituals as the
basis of her talk, Dr. George went
on to explain Ihe Negro's position
in the American society.
Before her race was emanci
pated, she explained, spirituals
voiced the slave's desire for free
dom. Their white masters seemed
unaware that the slave was ex
pressing in song what he was
afraid to state.
"Through spirituals, the Negro
learned to live with his prob
lems," said Dr. George. "These
spirituals were the cultural bag
gage which they brought from
their homelands."
Slave TVlusic
For the Negro slave, "his music
was his life rendered vocal," ac
cording to Dr. George.
Often humorously, Dr. George
presented a clear argument for
why the Negro should be consid
ered equal.
"The Negro must face every
thing. lie must analyze every sit
uation as to whether he will be
accepted or not." Dr. George ex
plained she was talking about Ihe
situation today and not just in
Alabama.
Theme of Talk
The theme of her talk she said
was "as Christian people we have
done an excellent job of teaching
people to give freely and to share
our culture; we must continue to
do this and improve on it, but it
is equally important that we learn
some of the graces and skills of
receiving."
"We have got to learn how to
put ourselves in the other -per
son's place and see why he does
the things he does," said the for
mer dean of women of Tennessee
State College. Speaking on he
world situation, she commented.
"Peace is going to come when we
get to know each other as people."
