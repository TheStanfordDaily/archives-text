# Ralph, Sammet Debate NSA's Achievements
## Lagunita Women Hear Former NSA Official 
### 
Pros and cons of Stanford's
membership in the National Stu
dents Association were debated
last night in Union lobby by NSA
Co-ordinator Jim Sammet and
ASSU President George Ralph.
Last night's meetings touched
off a series of debates leading up
to a campus-wide referendum
next Tuesday and Wednesday to
decide whether Stanford will re
main in the national organization.
At (he same time at Lagunita
Court K. Wallace Longshore, for
mer national affairs vice-presi
dent of NSA, spoke on the advan
tages of membership in the or
ganization.
Outlines Functions
He outlined functions of NSA
and emphasized services it per
forms which individual campus
governments are too limited to
accomplish for themselves.
Both Ralph and Sammet agreed
■ on the merit of the organization's
I basic principles, but parted com
: pany when it came to NSA's suc
cess in putting these ideals into
concrete achievement.
Pointing out that over half the
college students in the United
States are represented in NSA,
Sammet stressed the organiza
tion's role in stimulating student
government, in speaking as the
t "voice of the students" on the na
tional level and in encouraging in
ternational understanding by a
greater world-wide exchange of
students.
Specialized Groups
Feeling that NSA's past actions
have failed to justify Stanford's
membership in the organization,
Ralph said the University's goals
could be better achieved through
specialized local "youth groups"
and student government could be
better helped "through an inter
change of ideas outside NSA."
Last summer at the national
congress (where NSA policy is
made), Ralph found that "they
get the wrong people, people not
well enough acquainted to pass in
telligently on the issues."
"They are often there only for
a good time," he said. "As a party,
it was a great success, but as far
as doing anything concrete, it was
pretty much of a failure."
Achievements
In citing examples of NSA's
achievements, Sammet pointed to
information S tan 112 or d received
from NSA on alleviating traffic
problems and planning student
unions, NSA's influence on Fed
; eral legislation involving stu
dents, NSA-sponsored internation
al student relations seminars,
I NSA's sponsorship of an "aca
demic freedom week," and the
j "intangible factor" of evaluating
and improving student govern
i ment.
Longshore in his talk al Lagu
nita named live levels on which
NSA functions to serve the col
lege student.
NSA Functions
It gives him a national voice on
j issues affecting his campus, ar
i living at decisions on such sub-
I jects as racial integration, aca
i demic freedom and Federal school
aid.
NSA also serves as a "market
place of ideas," said Longshore,
J giving schools new views on stu
j dent government.
Another purpose of the organi
zation is to serve as a means of
developing leadership.
"NSA's final function is as a
i means of discharging responsibil
ity to society," Longshore said.
Th ro u g h scholarship and ev
change programs, the group helps
j improve the higher education sys
i torn in America.

Pros and cons of Stanford's
membership in the National Stu
dents Association were debated
last night in Union lobby by NSA
Co-ordinator Jim Sammet and
ASSU President George Ralph.
Last night's meetings touched
off a series of debates leading up
to a campus-wide referendum
next Tuesday and Wednesday to
decide whether Stanford will re
main in the national organization.
At (he same time at Lagunita
Court K. Wallace Longshore, for
mer national affairs vice-presi
dent of NSA, spoke on the advan
tages of membership in the or
ganization.
Outlines Functions
He outlined functions of NSA
and emphasized services it per
forms which individual campus
governments are too limited to
accomplish for themselves.
Both Ralph and Sammet agreed
■ on the merit of the organization's
I basic principles, but parted com
: pany when it came to NSA's suc
cess in putting these ideals into
concrete achievement.
Pointing out that over half the
college students in the United
States are represented in NSA,
Sammet stressed the organiza
tion's role in stimulating student
government, in speaking as the
t "voice of the students" on the na
tional level and in encouraging in
ternational understanding by a
greater world-wide exchange of
students.
Specialized Groups
Feeling that NSA's past actions
have failed to justify Stanford's
membership in the organization,
Ralph said the University's goals
could be better achieved through
specialized local "youth groups"
and student government could be
better helped "through an inter
change of ideas outside NSA."
Last summer at the national
congress (where NSA policy is
made), Ralph found that "they
get the wrong people, people not
well enough acquainted to pass in
telligently on the issues."
"They are often there only for
a good time," he said. "As a party,
it was a great success, but as far
as doing anything concrete, it was
pretty much of a failure."
Achievements
In citing examples of NSA's
achievements, Sammet pointed to
information S tan 112 or d received
from NSA on alleviating traffic
problems and planning student
unions, NSA's influence on Fed
; eral legislation involving stu
dents, NSA-sponsored internation
al student relations seminars,
I NSA's sponsorship of an "aca
demic freedom week," and the
j "intangible factor" of evaluating
and improving student govern
i ment.
Longshore in his talk al Lagu
nita named live levels on which
NSA functions to serve the col
lege student.
