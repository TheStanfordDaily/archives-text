# Dr. George Gives Views On Spirituals
## Slaves Brought Music To U.S. from Africa 
### 
"America has always been a
mixture of attitudes on the Negro
question," Dr. Zelma George said
in a Memorial Auditorium lecture
Tuesday morning on Negro spir
ituals.
Dr. George, former dean of
women at Tennessee State Col
lego, said many Virginia Negroes
enjoyed a great degree of free
dom in the years before the Civil
War.
"My father's family," she said,
"were among these Negroes."
Negro slaves, according to Dr.
George, brought to this country
certain cultural ingredients which
they often found in opposition to
the life of the areas in which they
came to live.
Some Quaker slave masters, she
said, "frowned upon" the music
of their slaves "as the child of the
Devil. So Negro singers had to go
underground."
Underground
Going underground was less of
a problem for Negroes on sugar
plantations than for those on cot
ton plantations, who lived closer
to "the big house on top of the
hill."
As their cultural code, the
slaves created the famous song
"Steal Away." This song, Dr.
George said, meant "Meet me
back in the woods tonight and
we'll have some fun."
Dr. George illustrated her lec
ture with several Negro songs,
among them "A Long Way from
Home" and "Water Boy"—two of
her favorites.
She said she likes the spiritual
"Go Down, Moses" best, because
Moses "didn't take it lying down."
Musical Talent
Dr. George, answering a ques
tion on whether Negroes have
more natural musical talent than
other races, said: "1 can give you
examples of thousands of Ne
groes who can't sing. Everything
you find that looks like special
talent is actually the result of
generations of social tradition."
