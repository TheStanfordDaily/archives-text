### Gerry Smith 
Editor's Note: The Daily will run two articles explaining the
National Student Association in preparation for Monday and Tues
day's referendum. They will run today and tomorrow.

Stanford joined the National Student Association in 1954.
The question of whether to continue this membership will be
brought before the student body in a referendum Monday and Tues
day. Just what will the students be voting on?
NSA is a federation of 290 student governments at colleges and

universities throughout the Unit--
ed States. It includes more than
half of all college students and is
the only organization officially
recognized as their representa
tive.
NSA's interest is only in na
tional and international problems
affecting students as students.
Policy is formulated at the NSA
Congress held late in August each
year and lasting approximately 11
days. Delegates and alternates
from all member schools attend.
Stanford Delegation
The number of delegates de
pends on enrollment — Stanford
sent six delegates and three alter
nates to last summer's congress.
The cost of belonging to NSA
is between $1000 and $1200 a year,
most of which is used to send del
egates to the congress.
The congress is divided into
four commissions. The interna
t i on a 1 commission co-ordinates
work on international problems.
The student government commis
sion studies student government
organization.
The student affairs commission
studies activities not directly un
der student government, such as
health services and honor codes.
The national affairs commission
deals with any national affairs
affecting NSA, primarily political
issues.
Plenary Session
After these commissions and
subcommissions of approximately
150 delegates each have met, the
last three days of the congress
are spent in plenary sessions.
There is discussion of resolutions
passed by the commissions, and
finally passing or defeating thdm.
Decisions of the congress man
date the member schools to do
all in their power to implement
the resolutions. This may be done
in the schools themselves or by
presenting their ideas to various
legitimate lobbying groups, such
as the American Council of Edu
cation and the National Education
Association.
One bill passed by Congress for
which NSA exerted its influence
was one providing that college
Students be allowed to earn more
than $600 a year and still be con
sidered dependents if their par
ents are paying for half their edu
cation.
NSA also helps solve many
campus problems such as parking
and traffic, by exchanging infor
mal ion on the problem with
schools which have already found
solutions.
Budget
The complete budget for study
of international issues comes not
from the member schools bul
from the Foundation for Youth
and Student Affairs.
NSA members are divided into
19 regions. Stanford is in the Cali
fornia • Nevada-Hawaii regi on,
which includes the University of
California, Mills College. UCLA,
USC, Loyola, Mount St. Mary's,
Immaculate Heart, California In
stitute of Technology. Los Angel
es City College and the Univer
sity of Hawaii. The regional presi
dent is Stanford student A! Wil
son.


HARRY MJNN, former National Student Association president,
addressed ASSU Executive Committee on Nov. 10, 1054, when Stan
ford was considering joining NSA. The question of continued Farm
affiliation with the organization will be submitted to the student
body next Monday and Tuesday.
