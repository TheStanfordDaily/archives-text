in America."
By early afternoon, 52 Negroes
■•eluding 10 members of the cler
gy had been arrested or hud sur
rendered voluntarily. All ore re
leased in $300 bail after being
photographed and fingerprint i.
It was not expected all the other

A grand jury, reporting that it
found the boycott illegal and that
the present trend of race relations
here could bring on violence, in
dicted the leaders of the demon
stration yesterday under 11 cares.
It was believed all the defend
ants were accused of violating a
little-used state law passed in 1021
