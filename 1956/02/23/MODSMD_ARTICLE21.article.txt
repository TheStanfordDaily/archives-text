### Dave Scott 
Next week President Kisenhower is expected
t<* announce his decision upon whether he will
run for a second term.
Stanford students were asked whether they
thought lie should run:
11 \itit \ \V. Getty, '57, off-cam pus: "In the
critical years ahead we must have strong lead
ership and genuinely constructive policies to
meet the threat from abroad and in view of the
record of the present Administration, 1 feel
that this leadership can be found only in IVlr.
Kisenhower.*'
Jack Schwartz, '58, Stern: "No. The Presi
dency of the United States requires a man able
to devote all his energies to the job, not a mere
regent or chairman of the board. For Ike to
undertake this would be to submit himself to
the possibility of physical ruin."
Barbara Westinghouse, '58, Lagunita:
"Since his party is divided, I think he should
run if his health is all right. The country would
be more unified under him, as it has been the
last four years."
Al Farmer, '58, Stem: "If Ike is physically
capable of running again, he owes it to his
country to carry on the line program already
begun. He is one man whose word is respected
by foreign nations."
Carolyn Cogan, '59, Roble: "I think Eisen
hower should run in the next election. In spite
of his physical condition he has and can exe
cute his duties with all of his former strength
ofâ€žwisdoirt. As in the ease of his recent veto of

the natural gas hill, he has shown his acute
alertness and his concern for the integrity of
our government."
Kon Rose, '57, Sigma Chi: "I think he
should run. He could run without hurting him
self if lie followed Hoover's idea of a light load
of work. I feel the Republicans need another
four years to further carry out their plans for
administration."
Klizabeth Marshall, '58, fMgunita: ''Not
only do I think Ike should run again, L think
he will run again. In the international field he
has the respect and the confidence of our allies
as well as Russia. His experience as a military
organizer and administrator has proven to be
a great asset in the civilian aspect of politics."
Richard Harrison, '57, Tormati Hall: "lkc
should not run because if he were elected his
advanced age would not allow him to assume
the full responsibilities of the Presidency.
Thus, by running he would not be doing jus
tice to his party and to those who would vote
for him."
Myrna Cramer, '58, Lagunita: "I think Ike
should run again. Not only does he have the
faculty of choosing outstanding and trustwor
thy men, but he has the willingness to delegate
responsibility to others.
"If the Hoover recommendation concerning
the creation of an executive vice-president to
handle the administrative details is adopted, it
would give the President more time to devote
to foreign affairs."
