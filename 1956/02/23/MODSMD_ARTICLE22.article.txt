'People in Glass Houses . .
Editor, The Daily:
'J'he letters in your columns written by Mr.
Peralta and Mr. Goldsack, along with criticisms
of my friends, urge me to clarify statements
previously made.
In my letter I sought to word my views clearly
and yet in such manner that no one need feel
offended. I hope that these efforts were not en
tirely unsuccessful, although they were inter
preted by one person as a guise of "broad-mind
edness."
I submit to the Stanford readers that criticism
from abroad be accepted for what it actually is.
It is made by people who can be as prejudiced
and opinionated as we Americans can be. For this
reason, their comments should be considered as
a cross-section of opinion rather than as impar
tial judgments. If this offends foreign visitors,
J offer my apologies but not retractions.
When applying ourselves to problems in our
own country, I believe we should think and act
according to the dictates of our own consciences
ami not be overly sensitive to the dictates of pop
ular' opinion, whether at home or abroad.
By this same token, we should respect the
rights of other countries to handle their own in
ternal problems without interference. Most of us
Americans would react violently to a move of
intervention by the United Nations (to quell
"mob rule" in the South, let us say), and hence
vvp should be able to understand the indignation
felt by South Africans when intervention was
suggested for their country.
It is significant of this era, when larger and
more destructive wars occur at increased tempo,
that some people consider the idea of refraining
from meddling in other countries' affairs "ri
diculous."
I do agree with one observation made by Mr.
Goldsack—that different forms of democracy do
exist. Not only is there the British and American
form but also the Indian and (let us not forget)
the Russian version. Obviously this word has
been overworked and misused by bureaucracies
on both sides of the Iron Curtain. If any meaning
is to be attached, however, a declaration of social
equality is included.
We should be honored that world attention is
focused on us while we undergo the problems of
defining and observing social equality. However,
it is e"tr mo'y objectionable to have to come
under fire from people who overlook conditions
in their own country and spend their time criti
cizing those of another.
At the risk of seeming pedantic, I suggest that,

when throwing stones, people who inhabit glass
houses should either install armorplate or, even
better, remove the glass.

What About NSA?
Editor, The Daily:
What is this thing called NSA? Is it a popular
front for subversive student activities? Or is it
truly designed to be the voice of the nation's stu
dents? Now, it may be true that these are some
what perverted generalizations, but how many
Stanford students can truly describe the National
Students Association, an organization to which
we belong and which is about to cause a great
stir?
This letter must not be interpreted as an indict
ment of either our information agencies or our
governmental representatives. For if the student
body had been interested in this problem it would
be so much more conducive to a student's active
participation in a special election such as this if
his vote were a sign of the fact that he were well
informed.
But in being informed one sometimes resents
the arguments advanced by proponents and op
ponents of the measure. This is true not because
of the passionate phraseology in which they are
oftentimes couched, but rather because they are
based on a source of information to which the
overwhelming majority of students have abso
lutely no access—personal experiences at these
organizational meetings.
Now, if more students from this University had
had the opportunity of surveying the NSA Con
gress last summer we would be in a better posi
tion either to rescind or to perpetuate our mem
bership in this,group. But it is alleged that this
was neither practical nor possible during the last
week of spring quarter. 1955, for it was then that
the group of representatives to this Congress was
selected. Therefore it seems quite apparent that
we are going to have to rely on the statements
made by these delegates for any elementary un
derstanding of the merits and the defects of NSA.
But, on the other hand, would not a thorough
going propaganda campaign neither for nor
against, but about, NSA be a much superior
method by which to reach a larger percentage of
the student body? And if there is a serious ob
jection to putting to efficent use our living
groups, our radio station and our newspaper
before the voting date, it should be made known.

Editor, The Daily:
'J'he letters in your columns written by Mr.
Peralta and Mr. Goldsack, along with criticisms
of my friends, urge me to clarify statements
previously made.
In my letter I sought to word my views clearly
and yet in such manner that no one need feel
offended. I hope that these efforts were not en
tirely unsuccessful, although they were inter
preted by one person as a guise of "broad-mind
edness."
I submit to the Stanford readers that criticism
from abroad be accepted for what it actually is.
It is made by people who can be as prejudiced
and opinionated as we Americans can be. For this
reason, their comments should be considered as
a cross-section of opinion rather than as impar
tial judgments. If this offends foreign visitors,
J offer my apologies but not retractions.
When applying ourselves to problems in our
own country, I believe we should think and act
according to the dictates of our own consciences
ami not be overly sensitive to the dictates of pop
ular' opinion, whether at home or abroad.
By this same token, we should respect the
rights of other countries to handle their own in
ternal problems without interference. Most of us
Americans would react violently to a move of
intervention by the United Nations (to quell
"mob rule" in the South, let us say), and hence
vvp should be able to understand the indignation
felt by South Africans when intervention was
suggested for their country.
It is significant of this era, when larger and
more destructive wars occur at increased tempo,
that some people consider the idea of refraining
from meddling in other countries' affairs "ri
diculous."
I do agree with one observation made by Mr.
Goldsack—that different forms of democracy do
exist. Not only is there the British and American
form but also the Indian and (let us not forget)
the Russian version. Obviously this word has
been overworked and misused by bureaucracies
on both sides of the Iron Curtain. If any meaning
is to be attached, however, a declaration of social
equality is included.
We should be honored that world attention is
focused on us while we undergo the problems of
defining and observing social equality. However,
it is e"tr mo'y objectionable to have to come
under fire from people who overlook conditions
in their own country and spend their time criti
cizing those of another.
At the risk of seeming pedantic, I suggest that,

when throwing stones, people who inhabit glass
houses should either install armorplate or, even
better, remove the glass.

What About NSA?
Editor, The Daily:
What is this thing called NSA? Is it a popular
front for subversive student activities? Or is it
truly designed to be the voice of the nation's stu
dents? Now, it may be true that these are some
what perverted generalizations, but how many
Stanford students can truly describe the National
Students Association, an organization to which
we belong and which is about to cause a great
stir?
This letter must not be interpreted as an indict
ment of either our information agencies or our
governmental representatives. For if the student
body had been interested in this problem it would
be so much more conducive to a student's active
participation in a special election such as this if
his vote were a sign of the fact that he were well
informed.
But in being informed one sometimes resents
the arguments advanced by proponents and op
ponents of the measure. This is true not because
of the passionate phraseology in which they are
oftentimes couched, but rather because they are
based on a source of information to which the
overwhelming majority of students have abso
lutely no access—personal experiences at these
organizational meetings.
Now, if more students from this University had
had the opportunity of surveying the NSA Con
gress last summer we would be in a better posi
tion either to rescind or to perpetuate our mem
bership in this,group. But it is alleged that this
was neither practical nor possible during the last
week of spring quarter. 1955, for it was then that
the group of representatives to this Congress was
selected. Therefore it seems quite apparent that
we are going to have to rely on the statements
made by these delegates for any elementary un
derstanding of the merits and the defects of NSA.
But, on the other hand, would not a thorough
going propaganda campaign neither for nor
against, but about, NSA be a much superior

'People in Glass Houses . .
Editor, The Daily:
'J'he letters in your columns written by Mr.
Peralta and Mr. Goldsack, along with criticisms
of my friends, urge me to clarify statements
previously made.
In my letter I sought to word my views clearly
and yet in such manner that no one need feel
offended. I hope that these efforts were not en
tirely unsuccessful, although they were inter
preted by one person as a guise of "broad-mind
edness."
I submit to the Stanford readers that criticism
from abroad be accepted for what it actually is.
It is made by people who can be as prejudiced
and opinionated as we Americans can be. For this
reason, their comments should be considered as
a cross-section of opinion rather than as impar
tial judgments. If this offends foreign visitors,
J offer my apologies but not retractions.
When applying ourselves to problems in our
own country, I believe we should think and act
according to the dictates of our own consciences
ami not be overly sensitive to the dictates of pop
ular' opinion, whether at home or abroad.
By this same token, we should respect the
rights of other countries to handle their own in
ternal problems without interference. Most of us
Americans would react violently to a move of
intervention by the United Nations (to quell
"mob rule" in the South, let us say), and hence
vvp should be able to understand the indignation
felt by South Africans when intervention was
suggested for their country.
It is significant of this era, when larger and
more destructive wars occur at increased tempo,
that some people consider the idea of refraining
from meddling in other countries' affairs "ri
diculous."
I do agree with one observation made by Mr.
Goldsack—that different forms of democracy do
exist. Not only is there the British and American
form but also the Indian and (let us not forget)
the Russian version. Obviously this word has
been overworked and misused by bureaucracies
on both sides of the Iron Curtain. If any meaning
is to be attached, however, a declaration of social
equality is included.
We should be honored that world attention is
focused on us while we undergo the problems of
defining and observing social equality. However,
it is e"tr mo'y objectionable to have to come
under fire from people who overlook conditions
in their own country and spend their time criti
cizing those of another.
At the risk of seeming pedantic, I suggest that,

when throwing stones, people who inhabit glass
houses should either install armorplate or, even
better, remove the glass.

What About NSA?
Editor, The Daily:
What is this thing called NSA? Is it a popular
front for subversive student activities? Or is it
truly designed to be the voice of the nation's stu
dents? Now, it may be true that these are some
what perverted generalizations, but how many
Stanford students can truly describe the National
Students Association, an organization to which
we belong and which is about to cause a great
stir?
This letter must not be interpreted as an indict
ment of either our information agencies or our
governmental representatives. For if the student
body had been interested in this problem it would
be so much more conducive to a student's active
participation in a special election such as this if
his vote were a sign of the fact that he were well
informed.
But in being informed one sometimes resents
the arguments advanced by proponents and op
ponents of the measure. This is true not because
of the passionate phraseology in which they are
oftentimes couched, but rather because they are
based on a source of information to which the
overwhelming majority of students have abso
lutely no access—personal experiences at these
organizational meetings.
Now, if more students from this University had
had the opportunity of surveying the NSA Con
gress last summer we would be in a better posi
tion either to rescind or to perpetuate our mem
bership in this,group. But it is alleged that this
was neither practical nor possible during the last
week of spring quarter. 1955, for it was then that
the group of representatives to this Congress was

we are going to have to rely on the statements
made by these delegates for any elementary un
derstanding of the merits and the defects of NSA.
But, on the other hand, would not a thorough
