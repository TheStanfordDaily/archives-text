# Sculptor Beniamino Bufano Praises Simple Art Form
## 
### Mary Ellen Romney 
"The most effective theory in all art is simplicity."
This statement is the keynote and recurring theme of sculptor
Beniamino Bufano's work, as he interpreted it Tuesday night to a
group of humanities students at a seminar meeting at Professor
Jefferey Smith's home.
Bufano, whose sculpture is characterized by striking use of natural

media, spoke of his materials: "I
like to think of the media as dif
ferent languages. The aesthetic
principles are always the same,
but the moods differ."
The diminutive San Francisco
artist was the guest of senior
Diane Dyer, who is writing an in
terpretive biography on Bufano
for her humanities senior essay.
Donation to Stanford
Bufano last year gave over 100
sculptures and mosaics to Stan
ford, many of which are now on
display in the Stanford art gal
lery and museum..His reason for
giving the $1.5 million gift was
that his works might be enjoyed
by all people, rather than becom
ing buried in private collections.
Sitting on the edge of his chair
and gesturing expressively with
his gnarled hands, Bufano ex
pressed his view that the harder
the material, the greater the
sculpture.
"The more the hands are busy,
the less the mental work," he said.
"The reason children have never
produced anything good in clay is
because their hands are too busy
and their imagination ceases to
function."
Bufano explained how most
sculptors render a work in clay or
other soft material and then have

it mechanically reproduced by a
pointing system. He, in contrast,
works directly with his material,
p1 a nning it by a geometric
"straight-line" system.
Speaking about a beaten copper
bust of his, which had been bor
rowed from the Stanford museum
for the occasion, he told how it
had been rendered directly in the
metal.
"I started with two sheets of
copper and formed them into an
egg-shape. Then I just pushed in
the hollows and beat out the high
points. It's very simple," Bufano
said.
Year in Europe
He told of his past year spent
in Europe and the mosaic work
he did in Rome. "1 make my own
stones," he said, "and form my
own color scale — about three
shades to each color, as the old
masters used."
He passed around examples of
the mosaic stones, formed of
ground quartz and color pigment
and baked in a kiln.
"Most modern mosaics use al
most 8000 different shades, and
! the results are pretty lousy—if
! you'll excuse the expression," he
I said.

his gnarled hands, Bufano ex
pressed his view that the harder
the material, the greater the
sculpture.
"The more the hands are busy,
the less the mental work," he said.
"The reason children have never
produced anything good in clay is
because their hands are too busy
and their imagination ceases to
function."
Bufano explained how most
sculptors render a work in clay or
other soft material and then have

it mechanically reproduced by a
pointing system. He, in contrast,
works directly with his material,
p1 a nning it by a geometric
"straight-line" system.
Speaking about a beaten copper
bust of his, which had been bor
rowed from the Stanford museum
for the occasion, he told how it
had been rendered directly in the
metal.
"I started with two sheets of
copper and formed them into an
egg-shape. Then I just pushed in
the hollows and beat out the high
points. It's very simple," Bufano
said.
Year in Europe
He told of his past year spent
in Europe and the mosaic work
he did in Rome. "1 make my own
stones," he said, "and form my
own color scale — about three
shades to each color, as the old
masters used."
He passed around examples of
the mosaic stones, formed of
ground quartz and color pigment
and baked in a kiln.
"Most modern mosaics use al
most 8000 different shades, and
! the results are pretty lousy—if
! you'll excuse the expression," he
I said.

works to a. group of humanities students. In the background is his
wooden sculpture of St. Francis. —Neat Walker.
"The most effective theory in all art is simplicity."
This statement is the keynote and recurring theme of sculptor
Beniamino Bufano's work, as he interpreted it Tuesday night to a
group of humanities students at a seminar meeting at Professor
Jefferey Smith's home.
Bufano, whose sculpture is characterized by striking use of natural

media, spoke of his materials: "I
like to think of the media as dif
ferent languages. The aesthetic
principles are always the same,
but the moods differ."
The diminutive San Francisco
artist was the guest of senior
Diane Dyer, who is writing an in
terpretive biography on Bufano
for her humanities senior essay.
Donation to Stanford
Bufano last year gave over 100
sculptures and mosaics to Stan
ford, many of which are now on
display in the Stanford art gal
lery and museum..His reason for
giving the $1.5 million gift was
that his works might be enjoyed
by all people, rather than becom
ing buried in private collections.
Sitting on the edge of his chair
and gesturing expressively with
his gnarled hands, Bufano ex
pressed his view that the harder
the material, the greater the
sculpture.

the less the mental work," he said.
