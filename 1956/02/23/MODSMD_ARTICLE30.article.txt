# Coast Conference Reinstates Bear's Recruiting Group
## 
### 
The Southern Seas, group of
recruiters for the University of
California in the Los Angeles
area, have been reinstated by Pa
cific Coast Conference commis
sioner Victor Schmidt.
The Southern Seas first got
into trouble l;/st year when Har
vey Knox, stepfather of the star
UCLA tailback, revealed that he
was receiving $400 a month to aid
in obtaining athletes for the Berk
eley school. Ronnie was presuma
bly one of those recruited. He en
rolled at Cal, but transferred to
UCLA in a controversial move
after his freshman year.
At the winter meeting of the
PCC held in San Francisco it was
hinted that the organization had
repented enough to warrant an
early removal of their suspension.
Bill Monohan, executive direc
tor of the Associated Students,
said, "We are happy to welcome
back this loyal group of Califor
nians and are looking forward to
a pleasant association with them."
