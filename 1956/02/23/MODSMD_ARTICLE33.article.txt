## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 22
(UP) The Pacific Association of
the Amateur Athletic Union takes
under advisement tomorrow night
the case of Tom Moore, director
of the California Relays at Mo
desto, charged with paying top
much money to miler Wes Santee.
In the aftermath of the Santee
case, in which the star Kansas
athlete was suspended "for life"
from running as an amateur.
Moore specifically will be charged
with overpaying the miler to run
in the 1955 relays in a half-mile
match against world record hold
er Lon Spurrier. Santee won.
After suspending meet director
Fred Van Dyke of Stockton and
publicist A 1 Franken of Los An
geles in the Santee case, the na
tional committee of the AAU re
ferred the Moore case to the Pa
cific Association.
It is probable that at the meet
ing tomorrow a committee will be
a p.p oin t ed to investigate the
charges, with no immediate re
port slated for a month or so.
