# Cards Meet WSC; Bears, Washington Battle for Second
## 
### 
L Stanford's Indians, currently!
j fifth in Pacific Coast Conference
J standings, journey to Pullman,
Wash., this weekend to meet the
Washington State Cougats on
Friday and Saturday.
The key contests of the week
end will be the pair of games in
Berkeley, where the second-place
Bears host the University of
Washington. At the moment, the
Bears stand as the only team in
the nine-team league with a
chance to catch the front-running
UCLA Bruins. Should Cal win
both games, they would have a
10-2 record.
UCLA should have a fairly easy
week as they engage Oregon in
Los Angeles. The Bruins, who
have romped to 10 consecutive
league wins, should trample the
Ducks, who have won only three
games. Willie Naulls and Morris
Tail, the two UCLA sharpshoot
ers, should prove to he too great
a task for the Oregon squad,
which has hit the skids after a
good early-season record.
Other action will see Idaho and
Oregon State in a battle between
two teams which are nearing the
end of futile seasons. Idaho is in
last place and has won only one
game, and the Oregon Staters
have been victorious ori.ly twice.
The USC Trojans are inactive
in league pluy this week, but they
should take an easy victory over
Loyola on Saturday nighi in a
non-conference tilt.
