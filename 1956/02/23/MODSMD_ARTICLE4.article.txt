# Winter One-Acts Prove Good Drama; Acting, Direction Show Great Talent
## 
### Wally Simpson 
Stanford should be very pleased
at the amount of talent exhibited
in last night's performance of (he
Winter One-Acts.
Especially good was the plot of
"Chiaroscuro." The torment of a
college boy who struggles to win
success on his own merits, only
to succumb to his father's wishes,
proves good drama, especially
when racial issues are intermixed
with a) tempted abortion.
The minor characters introduc
ed by author Chuck Chesnut in
the form of fraternity members
ably rounded out the plot and
took some of the edge off from
what is really stark tragedy.
Short Part
Very well played was the pari
of Jack by Glenn Dubose. Though
short, his performance appear
ance p rovo k e d a well-earned
round of applause from the audi
ence.
Also well played are the lead
roles of the struggling son, Jim
Meredith, by Dave Whorf, and his
father, Dr. Meredith, by Walt
Brown.
Hart Sprager, Bob Marrin, Ma
rio Brierley and Hugh Lester also
do good work in rounding out this
play, which is well directed by
Warner Leßoy.
"Morning Child" deserves spe
cial credit for a good job of di
recting by Judy Doty. The fan
tasy by Robert Bergquist does
seem to follow a commonly used

plot, but the play holds together
quite well.
Outstanding was the perform
ance of the young Ralph Liddle
in the role of Clive. It is in this
respect that Miss Doty has per
formed her best directing job.
Though not flawless, the boy's
acting endeared him to the hearts
of the audience.
Interpretation
Helen Norris' interpretation of
Aunt Hilda deserves some, com
ment. Looking at it from the over
all viewpoint, she filled the role
quite well—that of an exasperat
ed woman frantically trying to
take care of the details surround
ing a funeral and also trying to
control her young nephew, whose
mind dwells in a dream world
created by the deceased grand
mother. She was portrayed by
Doris Viola in a fantasy scene of
a returned spirit.
She dwdl fcoo much, or so it
seemed, in a high emotional pitch
so that the climactic point, where
she strikes the child, is diminished
somewhat in intensity.
The rest of the cast do admir-1
able jobs in filling out the play.
Carla Wood as "Mrs. Nybcrg" did
actually give the illusion of a
mid-Western housewife and all
too-helpful neighbor. Doris Viola,
as the grandmother, Rebecca, was
very lovable and Don Yates and
Hugh Lester played their roles
convincingly.
Comedy Difficult
It's been said that comedy is
more difficult to portray than
tragedy. That appears to be true
in the case of "As True as Cres
sida," the story of a Trojan girl
stolen from her Trojan prince by |
the strong,• muscle-loving Greek
warrior.
Cressida, played by Shirley
Douglass, while in the bed of Dio
medes the Greek, portrayed by
Lair Parent, sees visions of her j
Trojan prince Troilus, played by j
Gary Waynesmith. In the end she j
discovers that neither loves her,
and thus throws herself into the
arms pf Jim Schurz.

Jeannie Rich and Mike Ger
mai n e play convincing roles.
Glenn Dußose plays a somewhat
ludicrous role of Cressida's fa
ther; one that is not altogether
convincing.
Not listed in the program, but
well played, is the role of Aphro
dite by Susan Fogle. Whether it
was the lines created by John
Benedict or the direction of Ser
guey G. Kondratieff or Susan Fo
gle herself, she was as provoca
tive a girl as one should like to
meet anywhere.


A YAM PISH CRESSIDA makes it known to
Diomedes and Troilus that she bears no love for
either of them in a scene from "As True as
Cressida," one of the three One-Act Plays which

opened last night in the Little Theatre. Left to
right are Shirley Douglass as Cressida, Gary
Waynesinith as Troilus, and Lair Parent as
Diomedes. —Jack Churchill
