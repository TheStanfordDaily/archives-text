# Idea of Brotherhood Week Goes Back Many Centuries
## 
### 
Brotherhood Week, being observed this year from Feb. 19 to 26,
was founded in 1910. But the idea of brotherhood dates back much
farther.
Two centuries ago Benjamin Franklin said, "We had better hang
together or assuredly we shall all hang separately."

In 1931 the National Confer
ence of Christians and Jews, an
incorporated organization with
headquarters in New York City,
suggested the idea of Brother
hood Day.
That year 300 communities
throughout the nation observed
the day.
Development
Brotherhood Day developed into
Brotherhood Week in 1940. Since
then it has grown in importance,
with 10.000 communities partici
pating this year as well as many
individuals.
The 1956 Brotherhood Week
theme is "Brotherhood for Peace
and Freedom. Believe it! Live it!
Support it!"
Its sponsor, the National Con
ference of Christians and Jews,
was formed after the 1928 presi
dential campaign in which Her
bert Hoover defeated A 1 Smith, a
Catholic. The NCCJ was a protest
against the "violent brand of big
otry directed against Smith."
Honorary Chairman
President Eisenhower has been
named honorary chairman of this
year's Brotherhood Week and has
said, "Such efforts . . . are essen
tial to our unity and strength as
a society.."- ' • •
Commenting on the importance
of the week, Charles E. Wilson,
Defense Secretary, said, "Intoler
ance and racial and religious dis
crimination . . . are germs which
do their damage in every type of
human being, and they are just as
contagious and indiscriminate as
chickenpox, while having a mor
tality factor more closely resem
bling that of cancer and tubercu
losis."

The poet Edwin Markham de
livered his definition of brother
hood: "We have committed the
Golden Rule to memory; let us
now commit it to life."
Summing up the theme of Bro
therhood Week was singer Bing
Cros by. He declared: "From
when; I'm sitting, tolerance is
just a big word for peace. War
can't get going where there's a
sympathetic understanding— na
tion for nation, man for man, and
creed for creed."

Brotherhood Week, being observed this year from Feb. 19 to 26,
was founded in 1910. But the idea of brotherhood dates back much
farther.
Two centuries ago Benjamin Franklin said, "We had better hang
together or assuredly we shall all hang separately."

In 1931 the National Confer
ence of Christians and Jews, an
incorporated organization with
headquarters in New York City,
suggested the idea of Brother
hood Day.
That year 300 communities
throughout the nation observed
the day.
Development
Brotherhood Day developed into
Brotherhood Week in 1940. Since
then it has grown in importance,
with 10.000 communities partici
pating this year as well as many
individuals.
The 1956 Brotherhood Week
theme is "Brotherhood for Peace
and Freedom. Believe it! Live it!
Support it!"
Its sponsor, the National Con
ference of Christians and Jews,
was formed after the 1928 presi
dential campaign in which Her
bert Hoover defeated A 1 Smith, a
Catholic. The NCCJ was a protest
against the "violent brand of big
otry directed against Smith."
Honorary Chairman
President Eisenhower has been
named honorary chairman of this
year's Brotherhood Week and has
said, "Such efforts . . . are essen
tial to our unity and strength as
a society.."- ' • •
Commenting on the importance
of the week, Charles E. Wilson,
Defense Secretary, said, "Intoler
ance and racial and religious dis
crimination . . . are germs which
do their damage in every type of
human being, and they are just as
contagious and indiscriminate as
chickenpox, while having a mor
tality factor more closely resem
bling that of cancer and tubercu
losis."
Mark ham
The poet Edwin Markham de
livered his definition of brother
hood: "We have committed the
Golden Rule to memory; let us
now commit it to life."
