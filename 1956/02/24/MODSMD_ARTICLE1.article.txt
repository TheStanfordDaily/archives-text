## California-Nevada-Hawaii Region Separated Into Southern California, Bay Area Districts 
### Gerry Smith 
Editor's Note: This is the second and final article explaining the
National Student Association. Next Monday and Tuesday there
will Ih* a referendum on whether Stanford should continue its mem
bership in the organization.

Yesterday's article dealt with national and international aspects of
NSA and the congress. This article will concentrate on the regional
organization and NSA's founding.
Included in NSA national organization is the national executive
committee, composed of regional presidents and national officers.

The regional president is in
charge of two regional assem
blies; one is held in November
and the other will be held on
April 20, 21 and 22, this year. This
region contains about 60,000 stu
dents, making it one of the largest
of NSA's 19 regions.
It is divided into two districts,
one for Southern California and
the other for the Bay Area. A re
gional meeting is held in each of
the two districts each year.
Spring Meeting
The spring meeting is spent
mostly in preparation for the con
gress. The fall meeting is for fur
ther discussion of congressional
resolutions and methods of im
plementing them. District meet
ings are held every other week;
the next will be on March 1.
A regional executive committee,
made up of regional officers and
NSA co-ordinators from each
member school, meets four times
a year.
Several regional projects are
conducted each year. One of
these, held last week at Mills, was
an international student relations
seminar. The region received a
grant from the Foundation for
Youth and Student Affairs for the
seminar.
Other regional activities include
workshops on campus activities,
such as student government or
newspapers. The main topic for
discussion this year is student
government and higher education,
especially practical problems.
Interim Committee
Besides the annual congress,
NSA has a national interim com
mittee, which meets for emergen
cy police decisions effective until
the next congress. And there is a
natiorial advisory council of in
terested adults, of which Dean
William Craig has recently be
come a member.
NSA was first organized in 1946
at a student meeting at the Uni
versity of Chicago. The first con
gress was held in 1946.
Stimulus for an organization of
United States students came
when several United States stu
dents attended the organizational
meeting of the International Un
ion of Students. At this meeting
the American students realized
students in nearly all other coun
tries had some kind of organiza
tion.
When the Communist nature of
lUS was revealed, the American
students, along with those of all
Western countries except Ecua
dor, immediately severed rela
tions. The students returned to
the United States and NSA was
organized.

mittee, which meets for emergen
cy police decisions effective until

NSA was first organized in 1946
at a student meeting at the Uni
versity of Chicago. The first con
gress was held in 1946.
Stimulus for an organization of
United States students came
when several United States stu
dents attended the organizational
meeting of the International Un
ion of Students. At this meeting
the American students realized
students in nearly all other coun
tries had some kind of organiza
tion.
When the Communist nature of
lUS was revealed, the American
students, along with those of all
Western countries except Ecua
dor, immediately severed rela
tions. The students returned to
the United States and NSA was
organized.
Editor's Note: This is the second and final article explaining the
National Student Association. Next Monday and Tuesday there
will Ih* a referendum on whether Stanford should continue its mem
bership in the organization.

NSA and the congress. This article will concentrate on the regional
organization and NSA's founding.

committee, composed of regional presidents and national officers.

The regional president is in
charge of two regional assem
blies; one is held in November

region contains about 60,000 stu
dents, making it one of the largest
of NSA's 19 regions.
It is divided into two districts,
one for Southern California and
the other for the Bay Area. A re
gional meeting is held in each of
the two districts each year.
Spring Meeting
The spring meeting is spent
mostly in preparation for the con
gress. The fall meeting is for fur
ther discussion of congressional
resolutions and methods of im
plementing them. District meet
ings are held every other week;
the next will be on March 1.
A regional executive committee,
made up of regional officers and
NSA co-ordinators from each
member school, meets four times
a year.
Several regional projects are
conducted each year. One of
these, held last week at Mills, was
an international student relations
seminar. The region received a
grant from the Foundation for
Youth and Student Affairs for the
seminar.
Other regional activities include
workshops on campus activities,
such as student government or
newspapers. The main topic for
discussion this year is student
government and higher education,
