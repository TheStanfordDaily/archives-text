# Consul Says Trade Britain's Top Problem
## 
### 
"The greatest problem in Brit
ain today is the maintenance of a
favorable balance of trade. Wo
must trade in order to earn our
food. If we can't maintain a prof
itable policy to earn our foodâ€”
we've bad it." r
This was one observation made
by John Ford, British Consul to
the western United States, con
cerning current problems facing
Great Britain.
Ford spoke yesterday afternoon
to a large gathering at Bowman
Alumni House as part of the In
stitute of International Relations
consular-cultural talk program.
From Debtor to Creditor
Flaborating on the problem of
British trade, Ford said: "Before
World War I we were the world's
greatest international creditor;
now we are the world's greatest
debtor. We are spending at home
far more than we ought to, and
we are not spending cno u g h
abroad.
"About 40 per cent of the
world's trade is carried out in the
sterling block"; much more trade
goes on in countries using pounds
than dollars.
Yet, he pointed out that "as
years go by, America will become
more and more helpful in main
taining the sterling block in meth
ods similar to the present Mar
shall Plan."
"Trade, Not Aid''
Ford said "as the situation now
stands, we buy more from you
than you buy from us." "Trade,
not aid!" is Britain's cry.
As further corrections to Brit
ain's trade problem, Ford advo
cated more lenient tariff regula
tions and simplification of cus
toms procedures.
Commenting on Europe's feel
ing toward the United States con
cerning the racial problems now
occurring in the South, Ford said
that Europe is very sympathetic
with us.
