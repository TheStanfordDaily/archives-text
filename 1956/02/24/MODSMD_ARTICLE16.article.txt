# Joint Discussion Airs Traffic Bind
## 
### 
Members of the ASSU Traffic
Committee met yesterday with
representatives of the University
administration in an attempt to
arrive at a unified policy for cas
ing the Farm's traffic pinch.
The meeting ended without the
group reaching any decisions, but
because the exchange of ideas was
felt to be valuable another meet
ing was called for March 8.
Representing th e University
were Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler, Business Manager Alt
F. Brandin, Assistant to the Pres
ident Kenneth M. Cuthbcrtson,
Assistant Business Manager Ser
aphim F. Post and Police Chief
Gordon Davis.
Bob Maddoek, chairman of the
Traffic Committee, was accompa
nied by aifles Eric N. Fricker and
Thomas J. F. Tilton.
Main bone of contention be
tween Hie University and Mad
dock's committee is the use of
existing roads in future traffic
plans. The University plans lim
ited access to the central Quad
area and thr> elimination of cross
campus through traffic.
Traffic Committee, approach
ing the problem from another
I angle, feels traffic would be best
handled by using existing through
j traffic roads to their fullest, in
I addition to incorporating the per-
I Ipheral road.
