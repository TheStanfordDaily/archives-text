# ABC Warns Local Bars on 3.2 Law
## 
### 
Department of Alcoholic Bever
age Control agents are delivering
warnings to dealers within a mile
and a half of Stanford not to sell
beer with an alcoholic content of
more than 3.2 per cent.
Similar warnings were sent to
manufacturers and wholesalers in
December, according to Regional
Director Frank Fu lien wider.
It is the responsibility of the
retailer to be sure the beer is not
stronger than the law allows, said
j Fullenwider.
The ABC will start criminal ac
tion against retailers, he said, if
a later recheck shows the warn
ings have not been heeded.
