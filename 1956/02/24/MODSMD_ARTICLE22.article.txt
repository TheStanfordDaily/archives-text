# Public Service
## 
### 
Approximately 100 high school students and
their instructors i 11 be touring the campus
tomorrow.
They are outstanding seniors from the Pe
ninsula and the Bay Area: students on the
threshold of college. Soon they will be making
one tÂ»f the most critical decisions in their lives:
what college they will attend.
Stanford has been fortunate; outstanding
students from every area have chosen to study
at the University. If we are looking toward

the continued leadership of Stanford in the
educational field that situation must con
tinue.
And it will continue as long as such groups
as Cardinals carry out such fine public rela
tions activities as the High School Day they
are again sponsoring tomorrow for the 400 stu
dents and their instructors.
We wish to welcome our guests and to thank
Cardinals for their invaluable public service
on behalf of the I niversitv.
