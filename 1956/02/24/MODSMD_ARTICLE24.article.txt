Moral Mission???
Editor, The Daily:
Permit rne as an alumnus ('32) back as a
leacher and doctoral candidate to mention some
moral and intellectual values which might guide
The Stanford Daily and radio station KZSU, the
Voice of Stanford. If both patterned their news,
cultural-and advertising policies after those of
the Christian Science Monitor, Stanford's voice
might speak with greater effectiveness to a much
wider audience. This audience might come to in
clude potential benefactors of our struggling Uni
versity.
If higher moral and intellectual standards pre
vailed, obnoxious hucksterism like that of Lucky
Strike and Old Gold's Jill Corey would not find
so much space in The Daily, on Stanford's air
waves arid on Feb. 2 even on University door
knobs.
Perhaps at the very least Miss Corey could be
limited to making only once nightly instead of
twice her seductive suggestion that Stanford stu
dents smoke Old Golds "all day long."
The Daily might poll the University commu
nity on-the moral and esthetic issues involved,
and on whether The Daily and KZSU should pro
mote harmful, time-wasting self-iridulgence.
Part of KZSU's pitifully small 'audience com
prises members of the Stanford community un
able to get good music station KEAR. We are a
captive audience of KZSU and would like to see
the Voice of Stanford follow the best in taste and
quality all of the time and not just part of the
time. KZSU's outgoing staffers Frank Smolar
and Bob Christiansen played much excellent
music.
Let us hope that the station's new staff will do
even better, replacing Jill Corey's unesthetic 15

minutes of mediocrity with the best in music and
interviews.
If The Daily and KZSU claim that they need
cigaret ads to avoid deficits, let the facts be de
bated and faced. At least such ads could be drasti
cally shortened and made more suitable for a
supposedly intelligent University audience.
If deficits, following the elimination of tobacco
ads, are small, the ASSU, the student religious
clubs and local churches might meet them. This
would be in line with the Fundamental Standard
and Mrs. Stanford's ideals.
As a substitute for Lucky Strike and Old Gold
hucksterism, KZSU might invite members of the
University community to lend little-heard classi
cal records. Some persons might even comment
on their favorite music in the manner of Frank
de Bellis on KEAR. In addition, the new KZSU
staff might try emulating Ed Murrow's "This 1
Believe."
Brief tape interviews could be made with Presi
dent Sterling, the deans and department heads,
Chaplain Minto and visiting former Chaplain El
ton Trueblood, Quaker Professor Harry Rathbun,
teachers of talent like Ronald Hilton and Thomas
Bailey, and emeritus personalities like Edgar-
Robinson and Margery Bailey.
Stanford's media of communication should be
publicizing highmindedness, austerity, character
and achievement at a time when American stu
dents seem to be going soft. Some attention
should be devoted each week to analyzing how
our universities can better compete with the aus
tere, ruthless Soviet system of higher education
which is apparently surpassing us perilously in
the training of able engineers and scientists
Only thus can KZSU and The Daily fulfill their
moral and intellectual mission.

Stanford's media of communication should be
publicizing highmindedness, austerity, character
and achievement at a time when American stu
dents seem to be going soft. Some attention
should be devoted each week to analyzing how
our universities can better compete with the aus
tere, ruthless Soviet system of higher education
which is apparently surpassing us perilously in
the training of able engineers and scientists
Only thus can KZSU and The Daily fulfill their
moral and intellectual mission.
Charles A. Gaulri
Moral Mission???
Editor, The Daily:
Permit rne as an alumnus ('32) back as a
leacher and doctoral candidate to mention some
moral and intellectual values which might guide
The Stanford Daily and radio station KZSU, the
Voice of Stanford. If both patterned their news,
cultural-and advertising policies after those of
the Christian Science Monitor, Stanford's voice
might speak with greater effectiveness to a much
wider audience. This audience might come to in
clude potential benefactors of our struggling Uni
versity.
If higher moral and intellectual standards pre
vailed, obnoxious hucksterism like that of Lucky
Strike and Old Gold's Jill Corey would not find
so much space in The Daily, on Stanford's air
waves arid on Feb. 2 even on University door
knobs.
Perhaps at the very least Miss Corey could be
limited to making only once nightly instead of
twice her seductive suggestion that Stanford stu
dents smoke Old Golds "all day long."
The Daily might poll the University commu
nity on-the moral and esthetic issues involved,
and on whether The Daily and KZSU should pro
mote harmful, time-wasting self-iridulgence.
Part of KZSU's pitifully small 'audience com
prises members of the Stanford community un
able to get good music station KEAR. We are a
captive audience of KZSU and would like to see
the Voice of Stanford follow the best in taste and
quality all of the time and not just part of the
time. KZSU's outgoing staffers Frank Smolar
and Bob Christiansen played much excellent
music.
Let us hope that the station's new staff will do
even better, replacing Jill Corey's unesthetic 15

minutes of mediocrity with the best in music and
interviews.
If The Daily and KZSU claim that they need
cigaret ads to avoid deficits, let the facts be de
bated and faced. At least such ads could be drasti
cally shortened and made more suitable for a
supposedly intelligent University audience.
If deficits, following the elimination of tobacco
ads, are small, the ASSU, the student religious
clubs and local churches might meet them. This
would be in line with the Fundamental Standard
and Mrs. Stanford's ideals.
As a substitute for Lucky Strike and Old Gold
hucksterism, KZSU might invite members of the
University community to lend little-heard classi
cal records. Some persons might even comment
on their favorite music in the manner of Frank
de Bellis on KEAR. In addition, the new KZSU
staff might try emulating Ed Murrow's "This 1
Believe."
Brief tape interviews could be made with Presi
dent Sterling, the deans and department heads,
Chaplain Minto and visiting former Chaplain El
ton Trueblood, Quaker Professor Harry Rathbun,
teachers of talent like Ronald Hilton and Thomas
Bailey, and emeritus personalities like Edgar-
Robinson and Margery Bailey.
