# Southerners Show Mixed Reactions to Lucy Case
## Rash of Poems Hits State University Paper Concerning Issue Over Alabama Negro Coed 
### Wally Simpson 
Demonstrations attending Autherine Lucy's admission to the Uni
versity of Alabama created much stir among Stanford students. As
can well be expected, no less comment was created and stirred up
among Southern universities and colleges.
Of possible interest are some clippings received from the semi
weekly publication of Florida

State University in Tallahassee,
Florida.
A gentleman from there (it is
not apparent whether he is a stu
dent or faculty member) wrote a
little poem entitled "Lucy Had a
Little Crowd . . which was pub
lished on the editorial page Of
"Flambeau," FSU's paper.
In this poem, the author, Con
Horn, came out with an opinion
that is not generally conceived as
one that would issue from the
deep South.
It starts out:
Lucy had a little crowd,
with lots of rocks to throw,
and everywhere that Lucy
went,
someday tears will flow.
The poem continues by gener
ally deploring the actions of the
demonstrators at Alabama Uni
versity, and then ends with this
frank avowal of the author's
stand:
. . . This is the crisis—
solve the problem now or
twice as
many will arise.
The eyes
of the country are upon you.
I myself would run
the streets of Tuscaloosa with
a gun
and die,
rather than give in to the lie
that passes in the South for
Truth.
Blame it on my youth.
But if Autherine Lucy does
not survive,
why would YOU want to stay
alive?
Needless to say, protests came
to the college paper in the form
of "Letters to the Editor" includ
ing an answering poern from one
of the students.
One of his critics condemned
him quite vociferously: "Not
only," writes this Southern gen
tleman, "were you [Con Hornl
lacking discretion in publishing
your ludicrous poem, but you had
the unmitigated gall to describe
an Alabaman who had the gump
tion to take a definite stand in
opposing the entrance of Lucy as
'red-faced, slow-witted, degener
ate Defender of his decaying
Race.' " "
He further describes Autherine
Lucy as not being sincere in her
desire to attend Alabama Uni
versity and as being "nothing
more than a pawn of the NAACP
or some other subversive organi
zation intent on causing as much
dissension as possible."
This irate Southerner ends his
letter by recommending that the
poet, Con Horn, transfer to Flor
ida A&M (a Negro institution)
"and help expedite integration in
Florida. . . ."
Far less caustic* is the second
critic of Horn. In an answering
poem entitled "Yankees and Car
petbaggers" a gentleman by the
name of Paul Hammond referred
to attempts at integration as base
practices by Yankee Carpetbag
gers who are:

. . . waiting
Like some greedy vulture
To cram integration
With its Southern distaste
On Dixieland's peoples
So you can save face.
Genial Hammond believes that
"Corn" Horn is one of those who:
Think all the poor darkies
Are being persecuted.
And many Flambeau writers
Orchid A. and others
Seem to be desirous
Of many Negro brothers.
Poet Hammond's opinion of the
Alabama demonstrators is one of
putting the blame on Autherine
Lucy. Says Hammond:
She made some Alabama stu
dents
Seem void of common sense -
They aren't murderers and
killers,
They shot in self-defense.
Equal maybe but separate
Is the only possible solution
And that is how I want to
draw
My poem to its conclusion.
Con Horn was given a chance to
answer his critics in a later issue.
In replying to Hammond's charge
of desiring Negro brothers Horn
says, "... I am particularly an
noyed by thes* righteous 'race
purists' who want to know if 1
am in favor of 'Negro brothers,'
for certainly this could only occur
with more than a little white co
operation, correct?"
Horn thinks it quite encourag
ing that "the student body at Ala
bama had little or nothing to do
with the last violent demonstra
tions in Tuscaloosa. . . ."
He says further, "I think it is
encouraging that today's college
students, Southern included, show
an increasing tendency to accept
the Negro and, in many instances,
to side with him against the grad
ually thinning ranks of the racial
reactionaries."
The Florida poet claims that his
other critic "is yielding to super
stition and myth when he refers
to the NAACP as 'subversive.'
This is what the demagogues of
the South would have the Ameri
can public believe, and it is just
for this reason that the NAACP
takes extraordinary care to ex
clude Communists and other 'sub
versives' from its midst."
He ends his answer to critics
by avowing, "I will continue to do
all I can, however, if just to ease
my conscience of this most hein
ous of all 'white men's burdens,'
whether it be to serve as coun
selor in an integrated camp or to
pound out semi-literate verses in
an effort to shatter the compla
cency of an oppressive, con
science-tormented majority."
That is all of the controversy
received. This is but one example
of opinions on a vital issue; an
example from a university where
the issue will probably be faced.

This is what the demagogues of
the South would have the Ameri
can public believe, and it is just
for this reason that the NAACP
takes extraordinary care to ex
clude Communists and other 'sub
versives' from its midst."
He ends his answer to critics
by avowing, "I will continue to do
all I can, however, if just to ease
my conscience of this most hein
ous of all 'white men's burdens,'
whether it be to serve as coun
selor in an integrated camp or to
pound out semi-literate verses in
an effort to shatter the compla
cency of an oppressive, con
science-tormented majority."
That is all of the controversy
received. This is but one example
of opinions on a vital issue; an
example from a university where
the issue will probably be faced.
Demonstrations attending Autherine Lucy's admission to the Uni
versity of Alabama created much stir among Stanford students. As
can well be expected, no less comment was created and stirred up
among Southern universities and colleges.
Of possible interest are some clippings received from the semi
weekly publication of Florida

State University in Tallahassee,
Florida.
A gentleman from there (it is
not apparent whether he is a stu
dent or faculty member) wrote a
little poem entitled "Lucy Had a
Little Crowd . . which was pub
lished on the editorial page Of
"Flambeau," FSU's paper.
In this poem, the author, Con
Horn, came out with an opinion
that is not generally conceived as
one that would issue from the
deep South.
It starts out:
Lucy had a little crowd,
with lots of rocks to throw,
and everywhere that Lucy
went,
someday tears will flow.
The poem continues by gener
ally deploring the actions of the
demonstrators at Alabama Uni
versity, and then ends with this
frank avowal of the author's
stand:
. . . This is the crisis—
solve the problem now or
twice as
many will arise.
The eyes
of the country are upon you.
I myself would run
the streets of Tuscaloosa with
a gun
and die,
rather than give in to the lie
that passes in the South for
Truth.
Blame it on my youth.
But if Autherine Lucy does
not survive,
why would YOU want to stay
alive?
Needless to say, protests came
to the college paper in the form
of "Letters to the Editor" includ
ing an answering poern from one
of the students.
One of his critics condemned
him quite vociferously: "Not
only," writes this Southern gen
tleman, "were you [Con Hornl
lacking discretion in publishing
your ludicrous poem, but you had
the unmitigated gall to describe
an Alabaman who had the gump
tion to take a definite stand in
opposing the entrance of Lucy as
'red-faced, slow-witted, degener
ate Defender of his decaying
Race.' " "
He further describes Autherine
Lucy as not being sincere in her
desire to attend Alabama Uni
versity and as being "nothing
more than a pawn of the NAACP
or some other subversive organi
zation intent on causing as much
dissension as possible."
This irate Southerner ends his
letter by recommending that the
poet, Con Horn, transfer to Flor
ida A&M (a Negro institution)
"and help expedite integration in
Florida. . . ."
Far less caustic* is the second
critic of Horn. In an answering
poem entitled "Yankees and Car
petbaggers" a gentleman by the
name of Paul Hammond referred
to attempts at integration as base
practices by Yankee Carpetbag
gers who are:

. . . waiting
Like some greedy vulture
To cram integration
With its Southern distaste
On Dixieland's peoples
So you can save face.
Genial Hammond believes that
"Corn" Horn is one of those who:
Think all the poor darkies
Are being persecuted.
And many Flambeau writers
Orchid A. and others
Seem to be desirous
Of many Negro brothers.
Poet Hammond's opinion of the
Alabama demonstrators is one of
putting the blame on Autherine
Lucy. Says Hammond:
She made some Alabama stu
dents
Seem void of common sense -
They aren't murderers and
killers,
They shot in self-defense.
Equal maybe but separate
Is the only possible solution
And that is how I want to
draw
My poem to its conclusion.
Con Horn was given a chance to
answer his critics in a later issue.
In replying to Hammond's charge
of desiring Negro brothers Horn
says, "... I am particularly an
noyed by thes* righteous 'race
purists' who want to know if 1
am in favor of 'Negro brothers,'
for certainly this could only occur
with more than a little white co
operation, correct?"
Horn thinks it quite encourag
ing that "the student body at Ala
bama had little or nothing to do
with the last violent demonstra
tions in Tuscaloosa. . . ."
He says further, "I think it is
encouraging that today's college
students, Southern included, show
an increasing tendency to accept
the Negro and, in many instances,
to side with him against the grad
ually thinning ranks of the racial
reactionaries."
The Florida poet claims that his
other critic "is yielding to super
stition and myth when he refers
to the NAACP as 'subversive.'
This is what the demagogues of
the South would have the Ameri
can public believe, and it is just
for this reason that the NAACP

purists' who want to know if 1
am in favor of 'Negro brothers,'
for certainly this could only occur
with more than a little white co
operation, correct?"
Horn thinks it quite encourag
ing that "the student body at Ala
bama had little or nothing to do
with the last violent demonstra
tions in Tuscaloosa. . . ."
He says further, "I think it is
encouraging that today's college
students, Southern included, show
an increasing tendency to accept
the Negro and, in many instances,
to side with him against the grad
ually thinning ranks of the racial
reactionaries."
The Florida poet claims that his
other critic "is yielding to super
stition and myth when he refers
to the NAACP as 'subversive.'
This is what the demagogues of
the South would have the Ameri
can public believe, and it is just
for this reason that the NAACP
takes extraordinary care to ex
clude Communists and other 'sub
versives' from its midst."
He ends his answer to critics
by avowing, "I will continue to do
all I can, however, if just to ease
my conscience of this most hein
ous of all 'white men's burdens,'
whether it be to serve as coun
selor in an integrated camp or to
pound out semi-literate verses in
an effort to shatter the compla
cency of an oppressive, con
science-tormented majority."
That is all of the controversy
received. This is but one example
of opinions on a vital issue; an
example from a university where
the issue will probably be faced.
Demonstrations attending Autherine Lucy's admission to the Uni
versity of Alabama created much stir among Stanford students. As
can well be expected, no less comment was created and stirred up
among Southern universities and colleges.
Of possible interest are some clippings received from the semi
weekly publication of Florida

State University in Tallahassee,
Florida.
A gentleman from there (it is
not apparent whether he is a stu
dent or faculty member) wrote a
little poem entitled "Lucy Had a
Little Crowd . . which was pub
lished on the editorial page Of
"Flambeau," FSU's paper.
In this poem, the author, Con
Horn, came out with an opinion
that is not generally conceived as
one that would issue from the
deep South.
It starts out:
Lucy had a little crowd,
with lots of rocks to throw,
and everywhere that Lucy
went,
someday tears will flow.
The poem continues by gener
ally deploring the actions of the
demonstrators at Alabama Uni
versity, and then ends with this
frank avowal of the author's
stand:
. . . This is the crisis—
solve the problem now or
twice as
many will arise.
The eyes
of the country are upon you.
I myself would run
the streets of Tuscaloosa with
a gun
and die,
rather than give in to the lie
that passes in the South for
Truth.
Blame it on my youth.
But if Autherine Lucy does
not survive,
why would YOU want to stay
alive?
Needless to say, protests came
to the college paper in the form
of "Letters to the Editor" includ
ing an answering poern from one
of the students.
One of his critics condemned
him quite vociferously: "Not
only," writes this Southern gen
tleman, "were you [Con Hornl
lacking discretion in publishing
your ludicrous poem, but you had
the unmitigated gall to describe
an Alabaman who had the gump
tion to take a definite stand in
opposing the entrance of Lucy as
'red-faced, slow-witted, degener
ate Defender of his decaying
Race.' " "
He further describes Autherine
Lucy as not being sincere in her
desire to attend Alabama Uni
versity and as being "nothing
more than a pawn of the NAACP
or some other subversive organi
zation intent on causing as much
dissension as possible."
This irate Southerner ends his
letter by recommending that the
poet, Con Horn, transfer to Flor
ida A&M (a Negro institution)
"and help expedite integration in
Florida. . . ."
Far less caustic* is the second
critic of Horn. In an answering
poem entitled "Yankees and Car
petbaggers" a gentleman by the
name of Paul Hammond referred
to attempts at integration as base
practices by Yankee Carpetbag
gers who are:

. . . waiting
Like some greedy vulture
To cram integration
With its Southern distaste
On Dixieland's peoples
So you can save face.
Genial Hammond believes that
"Corn" Horn is one of those who:
Think all the poor darkies
Are being persecuted.
And many Flambeau writers
Orchid A. and others
Seem to be desirous
Of many Negro brothers.
Poet Hammond's opinion of the
Alabama demonstrators is one of
putting the blame on Autherine
Lucy. Says Hammond:
She made some Alabama stu
dents
Seem void of common sense -
They aren't murderers and
killers,
They shot in self-defense.
Equal maybe but separate
Is the only possible solution
And that is how I want to
draw
My poem to its conclusion.
Con Horn was given a chance to
answer his critics in a later issue.
In replying to Hammond's charge
of desiring Negro brothers Horn
says, "... I am particularly an
