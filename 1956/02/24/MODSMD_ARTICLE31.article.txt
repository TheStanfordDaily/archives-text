# Helen of Troy'—Or 11,000 Beers for Each Farm Student?
## Hollywood Extravaganza Is Fascinating, Like a Lavish Fourth of July Spectacle 
### Richard Mende 
Six million dollars would provide about two beers apiece for every
adult man and woman i.i Italy, 11,000 beers each for every Stanford
student and faculty member (excluding freshmen and assistants, of
course) or, with a couple of carefully placed investments, enough
to supply fraternity parties with beer, forever.

Instead, that amount of money
was spent on making "Helen of
Troy."
Whether or not this expendi
ture is justified, it is difficult to
know how to react to this opulent
display.
The movie's story line follows
the plot of the "Iliad," but the
script is mediocre and has no es
sential relation to the intentions
of the epic poem.
Principals
The principals — Rossana Po
desta as Helen and Jack Sernas
as Paris do not have sufficient
authority to be convincing. (Two
periodicals queried beneath Miss
Podesta's picture: "Is this the
face that launched a thousand
ships?") And Cedric Hardwicke
as Priam seemed trapped behind
a well-curled beard.
The fascination of this picture
- and it does have a fascination -
comes because it is a spectacle,
perhaps without especial mean
ing but, like a Fourth of July fire
works display, interesting never
theless.
To watch vast armies of well

paid extras sweeping across the
CinemaScope screen is impressive
—and a change from watching
herds of cattle sweeping across
the regular black - and - white
screens in a Western.
"Kind of Interest"
To see the lavish sets, expen
sive costumes, meticulously con
structed bacchanalian feasts ar
ranged around the events of the
Trojan War also has a kind of in
terest.
And, as in the stock Westerns,
there are sufficient fights and
killings to sustain a certain kind
of interest even when nothing else
seems to warrant: it.
Homer might conceivably have
preferred the 20th century to the
classic days, but if he knew what
would be done to his "Odyssey"
and "Iliad" he might well have
preferred to remain behind.
By the way, anyone interested
hi patriotism and Civil Defense
might hang around for Mr.
Webb's illustrated exposition of
these topics—"The 24-Hour Alert."
