# Mrs. Stanford's Will Didn't Determine University Rules
## Founding Grant Slated Ultimate Goals, Plus Farsighted Plans for Development 
### Bill Nichols 
Much of the odd and unusual
on the Stanford campus is blamed
on some eccentric provision in
Mrs. Stanford's will. The condi-'
tion of campus roads, smoking on
Inner Quad, pompon girls—all are
associated with the last will and
testament of Jane Lathrop Stan
ford.
Actually, her will has nothing
to do with University rules. All
regulations imposed on the Uni
versity by its founders, Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, are in the
founding grant.
In most cases it is later rulings
by the Board of Trustees which
have caused the discussion. Smok
ing, for example, was practically
unknown in Mrs. Stanford's day.
The Inner Quad ruling is for fire
protection and to avoid litter, not
because Mrs. Stanford thought to
bacco was "evil."
First legal step for the Univer
sity was the California Enabling
Act of 1885, which gave tax bene
fits to any person desiring to set
up an institute of higher learning.
This was state legislation, and, in
return, the new University was
not to charge any tuition to stu
dents from this state.
First Grants
The first founding grants set up
the Board of Trustees and set
aside certain Stanford land which
was to be used for the University.
The ultimate goals of this Uni
versity were also stated. Among
the trustees' duties were:
• To prohibit sectarian instruc
tion, but to have taught in the
University the immortality of the
soul, the existence of an all-wise
and benevolent Creator and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man.
• To afford equal facilities and
give equal advantages in the Uni
versity to both the sexes.
• To maintain on the Palo Alto
Instate a farm for instruction in
agriculture in all its branches.
Founders Farsighted
Both the SI an fords were far
sighled in their provisions. They
instructed the trustees to build
buildings "plain and substantial
in character" and to provide for
art galleries, museums, mechani
cal institutes and conservatories
as needed.
Stanford urged the trustees to
provide a good faculty before ex
tensive buildings.
It was in this first grant that
sale of any University land was
prohibited.
A few years later, in 1897, Mrs.
Stanford made the first amend
ment to the original grant. Its
more noteworthy clauses provid
ed that no buildings be put in the

"Outer Quadrangle" unless of
stone and in general harmony
with present buildings.
She also provided that any fra
ternity house built on campus
must cost at least $5000, and she
banned kindergarten or elemen
tary schools on campus. This lat
ter provision was amended by her
five years later.
Immortal 500
The only currently talked-of
provision that can legitimately be
attributed to Mrs. Stanford was
the limit on enrollment to 500
girls. It was not that she objected
to the fairer sex but that the ratio
of women to men had reached
one to one and Stanford was rap
idly becoming a female school.
Rather than have a university
called Leland Stanford Junior
University become the Vassar of
the West, she limited the school
to 500 women.
She gave the trustees power to
set tuition, although urging that
it be kept low, and suggested a
charge be made for admission to
the Museum as "a partial protec
tion to the valuable articles with
in its walls."
In her later years Mrs. Stan
ford turned more and more func
tions over to the Board of Trus
tees, but she did prohibit any ad
ditional interments in the ceme
tery adjacent to the Mausoleum.
Outlined Ideas
Shortly before her death Mrs.
Stanford made a statement which
outlined her ideas for Stanford's
purpose. She wanted the Univer
sity continued on a non-sectarian,
non-political basis and called upon
professors to avoid electioneering.
Stanford's liberal admission pol
icy toward students from small
high schools was anticipated by
Mrs. Stanford. She asked that
concessions be made to those stu
dents who came from "non-prep"
high schools.
"Students should understand
l hat, while instruction is offered
to qualify them for personal suc
cess and direct usefulness in life,
it. is hoped that they will thereby
become of greater service to the
public," summed up Mrs. Stan
ford's aims for her son's Univer
sity.
