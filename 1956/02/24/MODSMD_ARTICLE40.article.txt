## 
### 
Two assistant football coaches
resigned from their posts at Ihe
University of California Wednes
day apparently because of pies
sure from head coach Lynn < Pap
py) Waldorf.
The two mentors, assistant var
sity coach Zeb C'haney and fresh
man coach Hal Grant, had both
been part of Waldorf's staff since
he came to Cal from Northwest
ern in 19-47.
Head man Waldorf said: "Every
once in a while a change helps.
This is no reflection on the two
men involved. No hard feelings or
dissension is involved. It's merely
ihat 1 feel a change is advisable."
Waldorf did not say when he
would name replacements for the
two. He did state that the jobs
held by backfield coach Wes Fry
and line boss Herm Meister were
not under fire.
The California coaching staff
was under fire last year as the
Bears suffered their first losing
season under Waldorf.
The Golden Bear head man had
this to say: "Our low point is in
the past. It's a very, steep hill
ahead, but I feel that we are on
our way up."
