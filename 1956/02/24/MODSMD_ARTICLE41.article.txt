# Indian Nine Entertains San Francisco Gators
## Fehring Announces Three Lineup Changes; Ed Verdurman Opens on Mound for Tribe 
### Bill Nichols 
Stanford's baseballers take the field tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
against San Francisco State in an effort to win their first game. Ad
mission to the Sunken Diamond is free.
The Cards, who tied the alumni 5-5 last week, will throw a changed
lineup at the Gators tomorrow. Coach Dutch Fehring is still in an

-experimental mood while prepar
i ing his squad for tlie league open
er on March 10 with Santa Clara.
A 1 Spurgeon will start in right
field in place of Bob Fletcher;
Steve Stewart starts at shortstop
for Bob Flanders; and Jerry Mor
gan has replaced Hal Messner at
first.
In another change, Fehring has
moved catcher Doug Camilli into
the clean up spot in the batting
order. Camilli, a solidly put-to
gether boy, got one hit against
the Alumni.
Mound Staff
Pitching for the Cards will be
Ed Verdurmen, who pitched three
nitless innings a week ago. He
will be backed up by Walt Payne
and Ray Young. Young had trou
ble against the old grads when his
curve would not break, but has
shown in the last two years he is
| a top-grade hurlcr.
Payne, a hard thrower, made
i headlines last season when he
pitched and won both ends of a
doubleheader with Santa Clara.
These three pitchers, with Don
Petters and Dick Jones in relief,
give Stanford a well-rounded
pitching staff.
Outfield Trio
Spurgeon, a soph, has yet to
! show he can hit good pitching,
j but he has good power, having
cleared the 365-foot left field wall
in practice. The other two out
fielders, Mickey Holzman and Bob
Evans, are both proven quanti
ties. Evans is a good defensive
player and a line-drive hitter.
Holzman, switched from second
base to the spacious centerfield
gardens, is not too strong a bat
! ter, but is a smart player.
The infield has good hitting,
but the defense is still untried.
Flanders and Stewart are neck
and-neck at short, while Messner
and Morgan are both in conten
i tion at first. Rudy Figueroa at
| third and A 1 Shaw at second will
be hard 1o move out.
The SF Staters are an unknown
I quantity, but they battled the
j Cards to an 8-8 standoff in a mem
orable game that lasted until 0:45
last year.
