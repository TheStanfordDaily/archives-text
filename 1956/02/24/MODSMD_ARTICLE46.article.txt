# Battered Cougar Cagers Host Cards This Week
## Deadly Larry Beck Pares Palouse Quintet; Three Sophomores in WSC Starling Lineup 
### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
Stanford's basketball team will be facing the third sharpest scorer
in the Pacific Coast Conference and the dean of PCC cage coaches
but not much else when they tackle Washington State tonight and
tomorrow night in Pullman.
Jack Friel is in his 28th year as head coach of the Cougar hoop

team. Friel has guided the quin
tet from the Palouse country to
four Northern Division champion
ships and one PCC title during
that time.
The sharp-shooting scoring ace
is forward Larry Beck, a 6-3 jun- !
ior who has averaged 18.1 points !
a game in conference competition
this year.
Beck ranked ninth in field goal
accuracy in the Northern Division
last year as a sophomore with a
35.5 percentage. The rangy for
ward gained a starting spot and
averaged 10 points a contest for
the Cougars.
Beck leads the team in rebound
ing this year as well as point
tallying with 78 In 10 league con
tests.
Perry Shirts
A 1 Perry, senior guard, is the
only other letterman starting on
Friel's young team. The 6-2 back
court man has been a starter for
three seasons.
Rounding out Ihe lineup are
three sophomores — forward Ed
Steele, center Bill Calbraith and
| guard Dick Rask.
The Cougars have captured
only one conference victory this
season out of 10 attempts. Oregon
State split the season openers
with the Palouse five, while USC,
UCLA. Cal and Washington have
swept consecutive series from the
Cougars since then.
Stanford will have an excellent
opportunity to make up ground
on the first-division quintets this
weekend. Second-place California

tackles third • place Washington.
Southern California, tied with the
Huskies, is idle this week.
Card Starters
Ti-ibo Coach Howie Dallmar is
expected to start a team consist
ing of Barry Brown, Bill Bond,
Bill Flanders, Hap Wagner and
Captain George Selleck.
Three of Stanford's starters are
rated in the top 10 in conference
scoring statistics. Selleck has
scored 195 points for a 16.3 av
erage, Bond has netted 171 for a
14.3 average and Brown has av
eraged 13.1 with 157 markers.
Washington State, although
starting a team averaging 6-3 in
cluding 6-7 center Galbraith, is
ranked very poor in rebounding.
The Cougars are the only quintet
who have captured a smaller per
centage of rebounds than Stan
ford in the PCC.
