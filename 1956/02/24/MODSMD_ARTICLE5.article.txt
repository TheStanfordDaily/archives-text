# Prize-Winning Scientist Says Discovery Came to Him in Bed
## Dr. Linus Pauling Speaks to Capacity Crowd In Chemistry Building, Gets Standing Ovation 
### 
One of his most significant discoveries about the structure of pro
teins came to him while lying in bed, after setting down some Doro
thy Sayers' novels, said Nobel Prize-winner Dr. Linus Pauling, speak
ing at a seminar yesterday afternoon in the Chemistry Building.
Known for outstanding work in many fields of science. Dr. Pauling

quipped, "the physicists call me a
chemist and the chemists call me
a physicist."
Accompanying his talk with
slides, some of which were photo
graphs of electron microscope
views, Dr. Pauling outlined many
of the important findings in the
field of structural chemistry,
pointing out- the significance of
work in the field in which he has
become especially notedâ€”protein
chemistry.
Importance of mathematics and
geometry in biochemical investi
gations was brought out, and Dr.
Pauling indicated that X-ray pat
terns tended to bear out predic
tions made on a theoretical basis.
Comparatively Easy
Describing the complexity of
protein structure and the diffi
culty of determining it, Dr. Paul
ing said "10,000 simultaneous
equations with 10,000 unknowns"
would be comparatively easy to
figure out. The problem is "a su
per cross-word puzzle," he said,
that has to be solved "by hook or
by crook." *
Further complicating the situ
ation of determining characterise
tics of proteins is that molecules
might misbehave, breaking prin
ciples of structural chemistry.
Dr. Pauling mentioned that it is
easier to get proteins from natu
ral sources than from synthesiz
ing them.
Many Reasons
Protein structures, Dr. Pauling
concluded, are "well worth work
ing on." Among Ibo reasons he
listed were thai such knowledge
to be gained from protein studies
is necessary for explaining virus
behavior and drug action. It is
necessary, too, he said, for under
standing the principles of living
systems.
The .jammed lecture room whs
insufficient to seal all those who
wanted to come and many were
turned away at the door. Students
and faculty members, packed into
the room, gave Dr. Pauling a
standing ovation.
