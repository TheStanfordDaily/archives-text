# Fifty-Year-Old Cap and Gown Continues Service Tradition
## Women's Honorary Society Raise Funds For Both Foreign, Domestic Scholarships 
### 
Sixteen of Stanford's most out
standing women are this year,
continuing a tradition of leader
ship and service that has been the
purpose of Cap and Gown for the
past 50 years.
The honorary society is com
posed of women who have made
an obvious contribution to under
graduate activities while main
taining a 2.0 average.
Major projects of the organiza
tion are the Stanford Calendar
and the cookie sales to raise funds
for a domestic scholarship and a
joint Cap and Gown-ASSU for
eign scholarship. Recipients this
| year are Dottle Dunham and Ma-
I ria Scaglia of Italy.
The scholarship fund was
J prompted in 1924 by the first
i raise in tuition when the group
| realized that this would prevent
many qualified women students
i from attending Stanford.
President Connie Schulz em
i phasized, "We are not an organi

zation, per se." Members are
tapped because they have been
active in various fields, and they
continue their work in these ac
tivities. If Cap and Gown organ
ized many activities, this would
detract, from the members' contri
butions to other fields.
Kach year, members don black
caps and gowns and proceed to
the women's residences "tapping"
now members. Juniors are gen
erally tapped in the spring and
seniors in the fall.
The only objective criterion for
membership is the necessary 2.G
average. There is no standard
way to decide on new members,
and the group has no numerical
limit.
Two world wars and changing
University policies have altered
many of the organization's past
customs. Until World War I,
members attended Friday morn
ing classes dressed in black caps
and gowns.
