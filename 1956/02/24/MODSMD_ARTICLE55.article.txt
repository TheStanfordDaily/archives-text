# NAME CHANGED. TOO
## WRA Rejuvenation Includes Recreation Plùs Athletics 
### 
Progress and change are Die marks of one Stanford organization
this year as the Women's Recreation Association finishes its rejuve
nation process. »
Formerly Women's Athletic Association, the WRA has undergone
extensive study, change and expansion under a program headed by

; president Sally Phillips.
"We stiJl have some ironing j
out to do in the program next j
quarter, but the major portion of j
the changes have been made," she '
said.
The new name was chosen, ae
| cording to Miss' Phillips, 10 em
phasize that the organization is
for all Stanford women, regard-
I less of individual athletic ability.
"Many of our activities are of
a more recreational than athletic i
, nature," she continued.
Expanded Program
WRA has expanded its pro
gram with sport dinners insti
tuted this fall. These dinners are |
designed to reinforce student
faculty relationships and provide
; closer associations between mem
hers of the organization.
In addition to intormal dinners,
WRA has widened the co-recrea
tion program. "We always helped
organize it," Miss Phillips said,
"but we've been trying to got
more participation and offer more
sports."
The new constitution calls for
closer co-ordination between
WRA, to which all Stanford wom
en automatically belong, and its

four member clubs — Orthosis
(modern dance dub), Swim Club,
Co-ed Folk Dance Club and Ten
nis Club.
New Activities
Also provided for in the revised
schedule are intramural sports,
recreational swimming, intercolle
giate sport days, badminton ses
sions, all-campus sport days and
special activities arranged in
bowling, golf and riding classes
through WRA.
Co-ordination of WRA and
women's physical education
classes has been strengthened
through fhe Board of Managers,
elected from gym classes. Each
member of the Women's Physical
Education Department staff ac
cepts sponsorship of WRA activi
ties.
Further changes planned for
discussion this spring are "mostly
technical points in the constitu
tion," Miss Phillips said. "We
hope that the changes in the or
ganization will help fulfill its pur
pose of providing every Stanford
woman with ample recreational
facilities."
