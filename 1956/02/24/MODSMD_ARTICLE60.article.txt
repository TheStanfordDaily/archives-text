# The 						Road
## Or what paved the way for sixty-one million cars? 
### 
W„, •.N you drive anywhere in America today
it isn't an adventure.
You no longer jolt down unmarked and un
charted roads in unc.ei tain cars. Roads that
are bottomless mudholes or rock-ribbed ruts.
But your father did. For a mere forty years
ago there were harclly- 4,000 miles of paved
roads in this country, and not quite 2,500,000
automobiles to go anywhere on them.
What changed the picture so quickly to
300,000 miles of smooth highways and over
61,000,000 vehicles? For one thing, the simple
need for American business to make a profit.
Example: the automobile manufacturers. Try
ing to sell more cars and make a profit, they
made constantly belter cars. The better the
cars became, the more people bought them.
The more people bought cars, the greater the
need for safe roads. And we built them.
Example: the oil companies. We had to make
a profit, too. So after we refined the gasoline

we scraped the bottom of the barrel, of crude
oil and made asphalt. At first it was a primitive
black-top that was poured right on the roach
Hut lo sell it in competition with costlier mate
rials, we kept improving it.
Kefciilt: today heavy-duty asphalt covers eight
out of every ten miles of American roads. To
day, too, our expanding economy calls for a
third more miles of new and wider highways.

our taxes will pay for these new roads,
so w e hope I lu'\ "re Imi ill of asphalt. Il does
everything any costlier material does. Il
ean save yon as much as .s 78*8-18 per mile.
It's proved itself in paving the May Cor
sixty-one million ears.

W„, •.N you drive anywhere in America today
it isn't an adventure.
You no longer jolt down unmarked and un
charted roads in unc.ei tain cars. Roads that
are bottomless mudholes or rock-ribbed ruts.
But your father did. For a mere forty years
ago there were harclly- 4,000 miles of paved
roads in this country, and not quite 2,500,000
automobiles to go anywhere on them.
What changed the picture so quickly to
300,000 miles of smooth highways and over
61,000,000 vehicles? For one thing, the simple
need for American business to make a profit.
Example: the automobile manufacturers. Try
ing to sell more cars and make a profit, they
made constantly belter cars. The better the
cars became, the more people bought them.
The more people bought cars, the greater the
need for safe roads. And we built them.
Example: the oil companies. We had to make
a profit, too. So after we refined the gasoline

we scraped the bottom of the barrel, of crude
oil and made asphalt. At first it was a primitive
black-top that was poured right on the roach
Hut lo sell it in competition with costlier mate
rials, we kept improving it.
Kefciilt: today heavy-duty asphalt covers eight
out of every ten miles of American roads. To
day, too, our expanding economy calls for a
third more miles of new and wider highways.

our taxes will pay for these new roads,
so w e hope I lu'\ "re Imi ill of asphalt. Il does
everything any costlier material does. Il
ean save yon as much as .s 78*8-18 per mile.
