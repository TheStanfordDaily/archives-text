# Air Raid Sirens To Wail Today
## 
### 
If you hear air-raid sirens at
11 a.m. today, Stanford isn't be
ing bombed.
It's just the Stanford Fire
Department conducting a Civil
Defense siren test drill.
At 11 a.m., according to Fire
Department officials, air-raid
sirens will sound the alert sig
nal, consisting of three minutes'
steady blast on the siren.
There will then be two min
utes of silence followed by a
lake-cover signal. In this signal,
the siren will deliver a three
minute wailing sound.
There will be no public par
ticipation in the drill, according
to Fire Department officials.
The purpose of the drill is
merely to test the air-raid siren,
in accordance with state regu
lations.
