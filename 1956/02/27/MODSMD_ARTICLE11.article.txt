# Don't Make Football of Arabia Tank Shipment Pleads Expert
## Foreign Policy Conference Speaker Appraises U.S. Position in Crisis 
### Bev Johnson 
'The Saudi Arabia lank shipment should not become a football
of internal politics." declared Dr. Artnur Young, former Point Four
director iti the Middle East, speaking last night on the position of ihe
United States in the Middle FJast crisis.
His address was the second in the Fourth Annual Western Colic e

Conference on American Foreign
Policy being held here this wi k.
"In my opinion, Dulles rightly
turned down Israel's request 112 r
arms. As Dulles pointed out, there
is no solution but only danger in
I an arms race."
Dr. Young suggested the United
States follow a "common policy
I of unity of action with France
and England to maintain peace in
the Middle East."
Dr. Young said that Saudi Ara
bia is a "limited military power."
; and the United States has n
aiding it in military* training.
Tanks Shipped
The request for tanks was
made a year ago and shipment;
was about to be made when the
press started inquiries, Dr. Young
explained. The embargo placcd >m
tanks was removed when it was
discovered the shipment was al
ready licensed to go.
"The tanks have been shipped
now," Dr. Young said, "and it is
unfortunate that the decision was
not made first. Any fuss now
could be written off as political
because of the impending election
year."
The Middle East has been for
merly neglected as an area of im
portance to the United States but
it can no longer be neglected," Dr.
Young continued. "It is an area

of serious international conflict
and -a strategic location as the
crossroads of Europe, Asia a .vl
Africa."

is mounting in the Middle Et-.i,
he indicated, and the attitude I"

'The Saudi Arabia lank shipment should not become a football
of internal politics." declared Dr. Artnur Young, former Point Four
director iti the Middle East, speaking last night on the position of ihe
United States in the Middle FJast crisis.
His address was the second in the Fourth Annual Western Colic e

Conference on American Foreign
Policy being held here this wi k.
"In my opinion, Dulles rightly
turned down Israel's request 112 r
arms. As Dulles pointed out, there
is no solution but only danger in
I an arms race."
Dr. Young suggested the United
States follow a "common policy
I of unity of action with France
and England to maintain peace in
the Middle East."
Dr. Young said that Saudi Ara
bia is a "limited military power."
; and the United States has n
aiding it in military* training.
Tanks Shipped
The request for tanks was
made a year ago and shipment;
was about to be made when the
press started inquiries, Dr. Young
explained. The embargo placcd >m
tanks was removed when it was
discovered the shipment was al
ready licensed to go.
"The tanks have been shipped
now," Dr. Young said, "and it is
unfortunate that the decision was
not made first. Any fuss now
could be written off as political
because of the impending election
year."
The Middle East has been for
merly neglected as an area of im
portance to the United States but
it can no longer be neglected," Dr.
Young continued. "It is an area

of serious international conflict
and -a strategic location as the
crossroads of Europe, Asia a .vl
Africa."
A strong rebirth of national I m
is mounting in the Middle Et-.i,
he indicated, and the attitude I"
