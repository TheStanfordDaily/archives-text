# Council to Decide Land Annexation For Lockheed Lab
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council to
night will decide the zoning and
annexation of the 125.7 acres of
Stanford land to be used by the
Lockheed Corporation for con
struction of its laboratories.
The zoning ordinance, which
was passed two week* ago by a
7-5 vote, will come up for second
reading. Upon passage of the zon
ing, the council will consider for
first reading the annexation of
the Stanford land to the City of
Palo Alto. The whole process
must be completed before Lock
heed can begin construction.
Stanford cannot sell the land,
but is allowing Palo Alto to insti
tute a friendly condemnation suit
in order to pass title.
Opposition to the zoning is ex
peeled to come from the citizens
living in the California Avenue-
Matadero Avenue area next to the
proposed L o c k h e e d industrial
park.
Two weeks ago Andrew Spears,
950 Matadero Avenue, complained
that the proposed "O-A Zone"
buffer district between the Lock
heed buildings and property line
of the homes of the area was not
enough. He suggested a zone of
70 feet, and the dose 7-5 approval
of the 50-foot zone followed.
