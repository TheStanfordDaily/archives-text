# U.S. Can Meet New Challenge, Says Hamilton
## Foreign Policy Talk Opens Conference 
### 
With a firm conviction that the
United States will be enabled to
meet the new challenge to its for
eign policy, Maxwell Hamilton de
livered the opening address of the
Western College Conference on
American Foreign Policy yester
day afternoon.
Hamilton, former chief of the
Division of Far Eastern Affairs
in the U.S. State Department,
■ credited the U.S. with a "tough
ness of fiber and strength of
character developed through sim
ple living."
He warned when this, is gone
"the sun sets."
Hamilton cited the recent Ban
dung Conference as an example
of the new world unfolding today,
different from any previously ex
isting. The conference indicated
a now stirring in major parts of
the Far East, a restlessness in
Asia and Africa.
Awareness
"What is new is an awareness
of the people to conditions, a
striving to do something about
thorn and to gain respect among
! other nations," Hamilton said.
"The problem the United States
faces," he continued, "is the rise
of Russia and Red China to major
power and their dedication to
Communism."
There has been a new leader
ship in Russia since Stalin's death
but the core of Communism re
mains unchanged. Communist
i domination of all countries re
mains their goal.
This new approach is harder to
handle than the previous attitude.
Western powers have a tendency
to blow up the importance of any
i "sweet" gesture because the Rus
sians are usually "so completely
cantankerous."
Major Tool
"Great economic strength of
the United States is a major tool
in combating the new challenge,"
he said. There are twin motives
in using this economic strength to
i aid other nations.
Military aid is a hard-headed
reason and justified, Hamilton be
lieves. The second motive, that of
lending a hand to other people, is
I more idealistic and moralistic.
"I believe the United States will
need to maintain a large armed
force in the future," Hamilton
said. "Visible military strength is
a deterrent, steadying factor in
maintaining peace.
Other Tools
"Other tools influential in meet
ing the challenge to foreign policy
are agencies such as the National
I Security Council and the Voice of
I America, an information agency
I that has survived despite vast
criticism."
Hamilton believes that an in
formed citizenry, fostered through
traveling, interchange of people
and exchange students, plays a
j vital part in meeting the new
challenge. He would like to see
more foreign students studying
in this country.
Hamilton concluded the basic
concepts of the free world are
"moral and spiritual."
"The skills and ingenuities of
the frep world will be more than
a match for those of the Commu
nist-dominated world," he said.

sians are usually "so completely
cantankerous."
Major Tool
"Great economic strength of
the United States is a major tool
in combating the new challenge,"
he said. There are twin motives
in using this economic strength to
i aid other nations.
Military aid is a hard-headed
reason and justified, Hamilton be
lieves. The second motive, that of
lending a hand to other people, is
I more idealistic and moralistic.
"I believe the United States will
need to maintain a large armed
force in the future," Hamilton
said. "Visible military strength is
a deterrent, steadying factor in
maintaining peace.
Other Tools
"Other tools influential in meet
ing the challenge to foreign policy
are agencies such as the National
I Security Council and the Voice of
I America, an information agency
I that has survived despite vast
criticism."
Hamilton believes that an in
formed citizenry, fostered through
traveling, interchange of people
and exchange students, plays a
j vital part in meeting the new
challenge. He would like to see
more foreign students studying
in this country.
Hamilton concluded the basic
concepts of the free world are
"moral and spiritual."
"The skills and ingenuities of
the frep world will be more than
a match for those of the Commu
nist-dominated world," he said.
With a firm conviction that the
United States will be enabled to
meet the new challenge to its for
eign policy, Maxwell Hamilton de
livered the opening address of the
Western College Conference on
American Foreign Policy yester
day afternoon.
Hamilton, former chief of the
Division of Far Eastern Affairs
in the U.S. State Department,
■ credited the U.S. with a "tough
ness of fiber and strength of
character developed through sim
ple living."
He warned when this, is gone
"the sun sets."
Hamilton cited the recent Ban
dung Conference as an example
of the new world unfolding today,
different from any previously ex
isting. The conference indicated
a now stirring in major parts of
the Far East, a restlessness in
Asia and Africa.
Awareness
"What is new is an awareness
of the people to conditions, a
striving to do something about
thorn and to gain respect among
! other nations," Hamilton said.
"The problem the United States
faces," he continued, "is the rise
of Russia and Red China to major
power and their dedication to
Communism."
There has been a new leader
ship in Russia since Stalin's death
but the core of Communism re
mains unchanged. Communist
i domination of all countries re
mains their goal.
This new approach is harder to
handle than the previous attitude.
Western powers have a tendency
to blow up the importance of any
i "sweet" gesture because the Rus
sians are usually "so completely
cantankerous."
