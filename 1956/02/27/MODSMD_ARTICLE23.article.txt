### 
Yesterday 11 ie fourth annual Western Col
li -ge Conference on American Foreign Policy
opened at Cubberley -Auditorium.
I lie conference theme, "Foreign Policy Un
der tiie Shadow of the H-Bonib," best reflects
1 lie main concern of peoples the world over:
how lite) can live in peace and avoid the hor
rible spectacle of a world destroyed by super
n.-ii-ntific warfare.
l ew know the solution Lo this problem. Some
think they have the answer, hut they do not
know how t.: put their schemes into operation.
They <So not k» ow what policy to use.
I he solution iy actually quite simple— better
understanding among all nations and their

peoples. Hut we are still searching for the right
policy to use in putting that solution into oper
ation. .
The human is a friendly being; he has a
friendship for others of his kind, a friendship
which transcends all man-made boundaries,
even "iron curtains."'
Such open discussions as this week's confer
ence are valuable in giving expression to this
feeling: in understanding the policies and prob
lems of our fellow humans in other nations.
Perhaps it \\ill be from such a conference
that man will find the policy which will enable
him at last to fulfill his destiny as a civilized
being to live in peace.
