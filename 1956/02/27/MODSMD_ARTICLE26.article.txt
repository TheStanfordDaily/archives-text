Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Charles A. Gauld, moral missionary and
spokesman lor the Uplift, certainly unfurls his
banners on hifh and charges with whoop and
howl into the midst of the illiterati and the sinful.
He is doubtless a sincere man and some of his
points are well taken: Beethoven is still running
well ahead of Bill Haley, --rid Lucky Strike ads
have not begun to give Shakespeare any serious
competition.
Hut his attack on Jill Corey is ill-considered.
T am a gentleman of tne Old South, sirs, and T.
will simply not stand for it. The girl may indeed
be huckstering; she may even be a seductress;
and she is quite possibly tempting the entire male
population of Stanford along the road to lung
cancer and boobery.
Hut J, for )ne, find no complaint with Vampire
Jill's "unesthetic 15 minutes." To tell you the
iruth, after my cranium has been oppressed for
hours with weighty matters of intellect, and my
heart is sore beset with the woes of the day, I
find Jill Corey's 15 minutes a very balm for the
spirit.
To be absolutely candid, she strikes me as re
freshingly sexy. I didn't even object when I found
her charming picture hanging on my door (in
deed. I now carry it, swat-hed in velvet, over my
heart). Whither she i. selling Old Golds or Strad
ivarius violins, I will listen, enraptured, to her
words.
Enough on this matter, however. I am certain
that the great body of Stanford's men and boys
stand solidly behind me. Unite, brothers! We will
defend this blameless maid to the death!
The more controversial points raised by Mr.
Gauld are somewhat nebulous and require care
ful handling, t have been recently informed by
several KZSU officials that the station has no
"moral and intellectual mission" of any serious
c nsequence. I was gratified to learn this; for
when anyone attempts to force either culture or
morality upon mc, then I am moved only to vast
and complete boredom.
1 find such an attempt particularly objection
able when it is concerned with "high mindedness"
or "austerity." I like a little hucksterism; it gives
me the chance to chuckle. And I much prefer it
to being told how I am to improve my "character
and achievement."
Mr. Gauld never defines clearly what is the
evil that is inherent in tobacco ads. I wish he
would, for as matters now stand he sounds rather
like an apostle of the old Demon Rum school—

something which few of us take seriously these
days.
Now, as to the competition between U. S. uni
versities and those of the "austere, ruthless So
viet system," two solutions come instantly to my
mind. One would be to simply render our system
more ruthless than the Russians' (perhaps we
could start by setting up round-the-clock lectures
and broadcasts on "How to Become an Austere
and High-Minded College Student: An Interlude
of Homespun Proverbs and Classic Inspirations).
A happier remedy would be to expand Jill
Corey's 15 minutes into a full hour and pipe it
directly to the Kremlin. The effects on Russian
austerity would be, I am sure, devastating.

Lights Out
Editor, The Daily:
"Help conserve power. Please turn off the
lights."
Perhaps this familiar sentence on the little
cardboard signs should read: "Help conserve
Stanford's bank account. Please turn off the
lights."
And perhaps it should be placed in more prac
tical places than classrooms—street lights, for
instance. Why not put the cute little signs on the
big, tall lamp posts all over the campus, asking
them please not to burn at 2 o'clock in the after
noon?
After that we could ask ourselves if lights are
really needed around Stern and Wilbur during
the day, or is it to keep our men from stumbling
over their noonday shadows, or tripping over a
sunbeam and falling down the outside stairs?
I think we need more little signs or a different
placement of the old ones. Possibly the people
who solicit donations for the University could
stay at home and make these little signs; then,
if they are embarrassed, I will take them to the
appropriate places myself.
Just as it is no disgrace for Stanford to need
money, neither is it a disgrace to try to save
some. If it is necessary- really necessary—then
give us glasses, Seeing-Eye dogs, more carrots,
white canes, contact lenses, or built-in bat radar;
but please let the sun do the job it is so capable
of doing.
Let's not be too literal or zealous in "Let your
light so shine before men . . After all, elec
tricity wasn't so expensive then.

tical places than classrooms—street lights, for
instance. Why not put the cute little signs on the
big, tall lamp posts all over the campus, asking
them please not to burn at 2 o'clock in the after
noon?
After that we could ask ourselves if lights are
really needed around Stern and Wilbur during
the day, or is it to keep our men from stumbling
over their noonday shadows, or tripping over a
sunbeam and falling down the outside stairs?
I think we need more little signs or a different
placement of the old ones. Possibly the people
who solicit donations for the University could
stay at home and make these little signs; then,
if they are embarrassed, I will take them to the
appropriate places myself.
Just as it is no disgrace for Stanford to need
money, neither is it a disgrace to try to save
some. If it is necessary- really necessary—then
give us glasses, Seeing-Eye dogs, more carrots,
white canes, contact lenses, or built-in bat radar;
but please let the sun do the job it is so capable
of doing.
Let's not be too literal or zealous in "Let your

Mr. Charles A. Gauld, moral missionary and
spokesman lor the Uplift, certainly unfurls his
banners on hifh and charges with whoop and
howl into the midst of the illiterati and the sinful.
He is doubtless a sincere man and some of his
points are well taken: Beethoven is still running
well ahead of Bill Haley, --rid Lucky Strike ads
have not begun to give Shakespeare any serious
competition.
Hut his attack on Jill Corey is ill-considered.
T am a gentleman of tne Old South, sirs, and T.
will simply not stand for it. The girl may indeed
be huckstering; she may even be a seductress;
and she is quite possibly tempting the entire male
population of Stanford along the road to lung
cancer and boobery.
Hut J, for )ne, find no complaint with Vampire
Jill's "unesthetic 15 minutes." To tell you the
iruth, after my cranium has been oppressed for
hours with weighty matters of intellect, and my
heart is sore beset with the woes of the day, I
find Jill Corey's 15 minutes a very balm for the
spirit.
To be absolutely candid, she strikes me as re
freshingly sexy. I didn't even object when I found
her charming picture hanging on my door (in
deed. I now carry it, swat-hed in velvet, over my
heart). Whither she i. selling Old Golds or Strad
ivarius violins, I will listen, enraptured, to her
words.
Enough on this matter, however. I am certain
that the great body of Stanford's men and boys
stand solidly behind me. Unite, brothers! We will
defend this blameless maid to the death!
The more controversial points raised by Mr.
Gauld are somewhat nebulous and require care
ful handling, t have been recently informed by
several KZSU officials that the station has no
"moral and intellectual mission" of any serious
c nsequence. I was gratified to learn this; for
when anyone attempts to force either culture or
morality upon mc, then I am moved only to vast
and complete boredom.
1 find such an attempt particularly objection
able when it is concerned with "high mindedness"
or "austerity." I like a little hucksterism; it gives
me the chance to chuckle. And I much prefer it
to being told how I am to improve my "character
and achievement."
Mr. Gauld never defines clearly what is the
evil that is inherent in tobacco ads. I wish he
would, for as matters now stand he sounds rather
like an apostle of the old Demon Rum school—

something which few of us take seriously these
days.
Now, as to the competition between U. S. uni
versities and those of the "austere, ruthless So
viet system," two solutions come instantly to my
mind. One would be to simply render our system
more ruthless than the Russians' (perhaps we
could start by setting up round-the-clock lectures
and broadcasts on "How to Become an Austere
and High-Minded College Student: An Interlude
of Homespun Proverbs and Classic Inspirations).
A happier remedy would be to expand Jill
Corey's 15 minutes into a full hour and pipe it
directly to the Kremlin. The effects on Russian
austerity would be, I am sure, devastating.

me the chance to chuckle. And I much prefer it
to being told how I am to improve my "character
and achievement."
Mr. Gauld never defines clearly what is the
evil that is inherent in tobacco ads. I wish he
would, for as matters now stand he sounds rather
like an apostle of the old Demon Rum school—

something which few of us take seriously these
days.
Now, as to the competition between U. S. uni
versities and those of the "austere, ruthless So
viet system," two solutions come instantly to my
mind. One would be to simply render our system
more ruthless than the Russians' (perhaps we
could start by setting up round-the-clock lectures
and broadcasts on "How to Become an Austere
and High-Minded College Student: An Interlude
of Homespun Proverbs and Classic Inspirations).
A happier remedy would be to expand Jill
Corey's 15 minutes into a full hour and pipe it
directly to the Kremlin. The effects on Russian
austerity would be, I am sure, devastating.

"Help conserve power. Please turn off the
lights."
Perhaps this familiar sentence on the little
cardboard signs should read: "Help conserve
Stanford's bank account. Please turn off the
lights."
And perhaps it should be placed in more prac
tical places than classrooms—street lights, for
instance. Why not put the cute little signs on the
big, tall lamp posts all over the campus, asking
them please not to burn at 2 o'clock in the after
noon?
After that we could ask ourselves if lights are
really needed around Stern and Wilbur during
the day, or is it to keep our men from stumbling
over their noonday shadows, or tripping over a
sunbeam and falling down the outside stairs?
I think we need more little signs or a different
placement of the old ones. Possibly the people
who solicit donations for the University could
stay at home and make these little signs; then,
if they are embarrassed, I will take them to the
appropriate places myself.
Just as it is no disgrace for Stanford to need
money, neither is it a disgrace to try to save
some. If it is necessary- really necessary—then
give us glasses, Seeing-Eye dogs, more carrots,
white canes, contact lenses, or built-in bat radar;
but please let the sun do the job it is so capable
of doing.
Let's not be too literal or zealous in "Let your
light so shine before men . . After all, elec
tricity wasn't so expensive then.

'Refreshingly Sexy*
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Charles A. Gauld, moral missionary and
spokesman lor the Uplift, certainly unfurls his
banners on hifh and charges with whoop and
howl into the midst of the illiterati and the sinful.
He is doubtless a sincere man and some of his
points are well taken: Beethoven is still running
well ahead of Bill Haley, --rid Lucky Strike ads
have not begun to give Shakespeare any serious
competition.
Hut his attack on Jill Corey is ill-considered.
T am a gentleman of tne Old South, sirs, and T.
will simply not stand for it. The girl may indeed
be huckstering; she may even be a seductress;
and she is quite possibly tempting the entire male
population of Stanford along the road to lung
cancer and boobery.
Hut J, for )ne, find no complaint with Vampire
Jill's "unesthetic 15 minutes." To tell you the
iruth, after my cranium has been oppressed for
hours with weighty matters of intellect, and my
heart is sore beset with the woes of the day, I
find Jill Corey's 15 minutes a very balm for the
spirit.
To be absolutely candid, she strikes me as re
freshingly sexy. I didn't even object when I found
her charming picture hanging on my door (in
deed. I now carry it, swat-hed in velvet, over my
heart). Whither she i. selling Old Golds or Strad
ivarius violins, I will listen, enraptured, to her
words.
Enough on this matter, however. I am certain
that the great body of Stanford's men and boys
stand solidly behind me. Unite, brothers! We will
defend this blameless maid to the death!
The more controversial points raised by Mr.
Gauld are somewhat nebulous and require care
ful handling, t have been recently informed by
several KZSU officials that the station has no
"moral and intellectual mission" of any serious
c nsequence. I was gratified to learn this; for
when anyone attempts to force either culture or
morality upon mc, then I am moved only to vast
and complete boredom.
1 find such an attempt particularly objection
able when it is concerned with "high mindedness"
or "austerity." I like a little hucksterism; it gives
me the chance to chuckle. And I much prefer it
to being told how I am to improve my "character
and achievement."
