# Men Chase Naked Witch In 'Unartistic' Finnish Film
## 'The Witch' Mixes Peasants, Bachelors, Thunder And Lightning in a Weird Attempt at Sensuality 
### Richard Mende 
Undiluted sex is the motivation for everybody (except the peas
ants) in ttie Guild's latest attraction, "The Witch," and will undoubt
edly be the motivation for everybody (except a Legion of Decency
member) who goes to see it.
Birgit, a nymphomanic witch who had been sent to an untimely

fate 300 years ago, is brought
back to this world when an earn
est archeologist pulls the stake
from her remains.
That night, amidst thunder and
lightning, her naked and admira
bly constructed body materializes
in the grave.
In this state Birgit is discovered
and brought back to the castle of
a Finnish manor, where she is
given clothes by the man and wife
archeologists.
Clothes Off Soon
The clothes don't, stay on for
long, though, and Birgit goes
from male to male in the manor,
creating enmity between two love
starved bachelors, causing a dou
ble infidelity (while he is chasing
the indefatigable Birgit on the
heath, she is making love to one
of the bachelors) and even pro
voking a quarrel between lecher
ous father and uninitiated but
eager son.
However, B i r g it's other be
witohments startle the peasantry
things like frightening horses
to death, snake-into-stick routines,
disappearing bridges, and the like
â€” and everyone becomes upset,
with much ill-will toward Birgit.
Joins Others
Finally the archeologist, having
given up his prolonged effort to
catch up to the animated fleshpot,
joins others who also have been
unable to keep Birgit in one place
long enough to seduce her. With
a good deal of gusto, the arche
ologist drives another stake
through her heart.
Presumably Birgit will remain
at rest until someone unwittingly
pulls out the stake again. Frank
enstein was saved from ultimate
destruction through several mov
ies, and Birgit may be loose again.
Liftle Skill Evident
If there were anything kind
that could possibly be said about
the movie technique or artistic
accomplishments in this film, I
would hasten to do so. But the
skill in almost any stock Western
is undoubtedly better
In the light, of the confused
chasings - about that went on
"through most of the movie, but
with all due deference to Birgit,
it is only fair to recommend that
the sign announcing this film is
"For Adults Only" be changed to
read: "For Children Onlv."
