# Philosophy Can Be Used, Say Stanford Professors
## Davidson, Suppes Try Music Experiments To Prove Rationality of Student Choices 
### George Phelps 
Have you ever wished that all the bantering and seemingly im
practical speculation that take place in philosophical circles would
become more earthy: rid itself of alto-cumulus hot-air and starry
eyed assumption?
Two professors from Stanford's Philosophy Department appar-

ently have felt the same way for
a long time. Drs. Donald David
son and Patrick Suppes have ceas
ed thinking about the inadequacy
of speculative thought, and have
undertaken a project solidly root
ed in terra firma.
As Dr. Davidson commented,
"We have learned it is one thing
for philosophers to talk about the
experimental method and another
thing for them to practice it."
They confess, however, that they
"have not found the transition
from theory to practice easy."
Empirical Approach
As part of their continuing pro
gram of research, Drs. Davidson
and Suppes have used the "em
pirical method" (research and ex
periment) to test the rationality
of an individual's pattern of pref
erences.
The purpose or one of these ex
periments was to determine the
consistency of an individual's
choices between various phono
graph records (all 12-in. LP's).
Stanford students in advanced
music courses were interviewed
separately and asked to make a
number of choices between pairs
of records, none of which they
owned.
The student was told he would
receive the record of his choice at
the end of the session; therefore
he chose honestly.
50-50 Chance
In the first half of the experi
ment the decision involved only
two records, say, one by Bartok
and another by Beethoven. But
then the experimenters went on
to put the student through the
second hoop involving three rec
ords.
The music major was told he
could have Bartok and then leave
if he wanted, or else he had a half
and-half chance on a Beethoven
or an Offenbach recording. If the
subject elected the chance alterna
tive, he tossed a die marked with
nonsensical syllables: "zoj,"
"wuh," etc.
It did not matter to the experi
menters that Bartok may have
had more appeal to the student
than Beethoven, for they were
testing rationality, not atonality.
The point was to measure the sub
ject's degree of preference and to
see how much a part this played
in his decisions.
Book
As Dr. Davidson explained.
"When some of the choices had
been made, (he experiments pre
dicted what other choices 'ration
ally' consistent persons would
make, and these predictions were
compared with the actual choices
of the subjects."
They are now incorporating
their findings into a book. This
book may well prove that philoso
phers can descend from their
"ivory towers" and substantiate
their speculations.
