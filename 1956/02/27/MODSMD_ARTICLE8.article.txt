# Frosh Suspended For Code Violation
## 
### 
Judicial Council last week found
a freshman guilty of entering an
instructor's office and entering
grades for seven homework as
signments into his grade book.
The man was suspended from
school, effective immediately, un
til autumn quarter.
The student claimed he had
handed in all of the homework in
question, but the reader for the
course had no record of the work
being done.
The instructor had checked his
grade book the m or ning the
grades were entered and had sent
the student a cinch notice because
the assignments were missing.
In the afternoon he returned
after class to his office and found
the defendant waiting to see him.
It was then he found the grades
had been entered.
The instructor then asked the
student to produce all his home
work for the course. The follow
ing day the student turned over
all but four assignments all
graded, although neither the in
structor nor the reader had seen
three papers before.
The reader checked these three
and found they were incorrectly
marker! with 10's, the top grade
given in the class.
The Council explainer! that en
tering grades and trying to pass
bogus "corrected" homework pa
pers constituted a serious Honor
Code violation.
