# COLLEGE CONFERENCE
## Dr. Brodie Makes Keynote Address on World Peace Voices Plea for Strategy Rather Than Pure Diplomacy at Cubberley Meeting Yesterday 
### Barbara Bachman 
"We must get away from thinking of war or peace in terms of all
or nothing according to Dr. Bernard Brodie in his keynote address
to the I<ourth Annual Western College Conference yesterday after
noon.
"Peace won't prevail without complete exclusion of force," he

said, voicing a plea for strategy
rather than pure diplomacy.
Brodie pointed out that free na
tions have so far discovered no
substitute for force and are not
in the process of developing one.
He said that world government
is probably the only answer to
an ultimate peace, but since "we
can't imagine complete world gov
ernment at this time unless we
use force, peace is not to come
soon.
"Therefore, since world gov
ernment will not be realized soon
enough to deal with present-day
problems, an efficient system of
our own must be developed.
Best Defense
"Until we have a world govern
ment we must remember that the
best defense is a strong offense,"
Brodie said.
He claimed today's problems,
being enlarged with the threat of
thermonuclear weapons and in
cluding the whole country, should
be dealt with by representatives
from the political, as well as the
military, departments of govern
ment.
"These new weapons force a
shift in strategic thinking—from
strictly military thinking to po
litical and social thinking," he
said.
American Thoughts
Brodie said American thoughts
and actions are especially impor
tant at this time because "our
allies look to us to determine their
strategic actions."
"If our foreign diplomacy and
strategic plans could be com
bined," he continued, "political
leaders can present political guid
ance to military leaders and a new
type of diplomacy-strategy tech
nique can be devised."
Brodie said that he realiezd the
majority of political leaders "are
n't as well versed in military mat
ters as professional military men
and that until common ground for
understanding can be reached be
tween the two, "any real progress
will have to be made in the mili
tary field itself."
"Not Better Contact"
He pointed out, however, that
the problem was not better con
tact and communication between
the two fields, but better under
standing.
He said even the three main di
visions of the Armed Forces
ground, sea and air—are in need
of more mutual understanding.
"They have never been farther
apart in agreement on fundamen
tal issues than they are now."
Brodie's address was the final
event of the Foreign Policy Con
ference. The Institute of Inter
national Relations, sponsors of
the event, canceled the remainder
of the conference program be
cause of the inability of colleges
to send delegations.

tween the two, "any real progress
will have to be made in the mili
tary field itself."
"Not Better Contact"
He pointed out, however, that
the problem was not better con
tact and communication between
the two fields, but better under
standing.
He said even the three main di
visions of the Armed Forces
ground, sea and air—are in need
of more mutual understanding.
"They have never been farther
apart in agreement on fundamen
tal issues than they are now."
Brodie's address was the final
event of the Foreign Policy Con
ference. The Institute of Inter
national Relations, sponsors of
the event, canceled the remainder
of the conference program be
cause of the inability of colleges
to send delegations.


BERNARD BRODIE
Strategy, not diplomacy
"We must get away from thinking of war or peace in terms of all
or nothing according to Dr. Bernard Brodie in his keynote address
to the I<ourth Annual Western College Conference yesterday after
noon.
"Peace won't prevail without complete exclusion of force," he

said, voicing a plea for strategy
rather than pure diplomacy.
Brodie pointed out that free na
tions have so far discovered no
substitute for force and are not
in the process of developing one.
He said that world government
is probably the only answer to
an ultimate peace, but since "we
can't imagine complete world gov
ernment at this time unless we
use force, peace is not to come
soon.
"Therefore, since world gov
ernment will not be realized soon
enough to deal with present-day
problems, an efficient system of
our own must be developed.
Best Defense
"Until we have a world govern
ment we must remember that the
best defense is a strong offense,"
Brodie said.
He claimed today's problems,
being enlarged with the threat of
thermonuclear weapons and in
cluding the whole country, should
be dealt with by representatives
from the political, as well as the
military, departments of govern
ment.
"These new weapons force a
shift in strategic thinking—from
strictly military thinking to po
litical and social thinking," he
said.
American Thoughts
Brodie said American thoughts
and actions are especially impor
tant at this time because "our
allies look to us to determine their
strategic actions."
"If our foreign diplomacy and
strategic plans could be com
bined," he continued, "political
leaders can present political guid
ance to military leaders and a new
type of diplomacy-strategy tech
nique can be devised."
Brodie said that he realiezd the
majority of political leaders "are
n't as well versed in military mat
ters as professional military men
and that until common ground for
understanding can be reached be
tween the two, "any real progress
will have to be made in the mili
tary field itself."
