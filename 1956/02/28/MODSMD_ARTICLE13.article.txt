# Faults, Merits of Stanford Membership In NSA Aired in Referendum Debate
## MSA Favored for 'Intangible' Values: Opposition Claims 'No Practical Gain’ 
### Bill Wright 
What does Stanford go* out of NSA?
' r he satisfaction of fulfilling an obligation, the "intangible worth
of giving," argued ,'i-n S.immet and Craig Barnes.
Virtually contended George Ralph and Eric Fricker.
"Should Stanford disaffiliate with National Student Association?"

was the topic of the debate third
in a series of "Campus Contro-1
versies" sponsored by the Speech
Association before about 75 stu-1
den's in Cubberley Auditorium!
last night.
ASSU President Ralph and his j
assistant Fricker urged that Stan
ford leave NSA. NSA Coordina
tor Sammet and Barnes, who has
been a participant in an NSA Re
gional International Student Rela
tions Seminar, spoke in favor of
the affiliation.
Referendum
A student referendum today
and tomorrow will decide the is
sue.
Sammet called for Stanford to
live up to its obligation as an im
portant university by participat
ing in the national policy stand be
in" taken by more than half the
college students in the country.
"Stanford should have a part in
what the people hear that stu
dents want," Sammet said.
Sammet cited NSA's three
goals:
• Improving student govern
ments;
» Providing a student voice in
national affairs;
• Promoting international un
derstanding.
Stanford student government is
aided by discussion groups repre
senting numerous colleges and by
the student government informa
tion service — "which is a file,"
Sammet said. From the file of
data, this year Stanford has re
ceived information to help with
the local traffic problem and the
building of the student union.
More Than Aid
But what Stanford gets out of
NSA is more than this aid to stu
dent government, Barnes con
tends.
"Stanford is in little need of ad
vice and support," ho said. "We
must be prepared to give more
than we receive.
"Our advice has been a real
service. And there is value in
service."
Barnes also spoke of the advan
tages of NSA in the field of na
tional and international affairs.
Ralph and Fricker strongly at
tacked NSA's lack of practical
value to Stanford and particular
ly the inefficiency of the national
congress, to which Stanford sends
delegates at the cost of about
$1000 a year.
Questions
'Flicker also questioned what
Stanford really gives 1o NSA. He
said the ASSU is in the process
of dispatching a bundle of infor
mation. "It is going to be filed. It
may even be cross-filed. And it is
going to stay in the file."
Stanford did "give" in the sub
commissions at t lie congress,
Fricker said. "But what has hap
pened In this? It is lost."
Both Fricker and Ralph con
tended that nothing was done at
the national congress that can
help Stanford student govern
ment.
The ideals of I lie NSA resolu
tions are hard to apply to campus
situations, Ralph said.
Exchanged Problems
Ralph added that Ihe delegates
"exchanged plenty of problems,
but we didn't have many an
swers."
Fricker criticized NSA's over
emphasis on political matters,
both national and international,
instead of student government
problems. Ralph suggested that
the political matters would be
more advantageously discussed
among students interested in
those fields, not the students in
terested in student government
who attend the congress,
Fricker favored withdrawing
from NSA to keep the Stanford
student government from being
involved in politics.
Helen Zarifes, ASSU vice-presi
dent, moderated the debate.
