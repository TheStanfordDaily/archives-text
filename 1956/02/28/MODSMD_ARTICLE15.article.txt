r I he polls will be open today

Stanford University Constitution
amendment and on NSA ref. en
dum.
Voting will continue tomorrow
from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. There
will be no polls at the Village this
vear, according to election chair
man Chuck Falkner.
Voting results will be an
nounced at ASSU Legislature
meeting tomorrow night.
Falkner requested all voting
students to carry their student
body cards, free of casing so the
cards may be punched without
any delay.
The referendum, which was
placed before the students by a
petition signed by five per cent
of the student body, provides
"Should Stanford disaffiliate with
National Student Association?" A
simple majority of those voting is
needed for approval.
The Constitutional amendment,
requiring a two-thirds majority of
those voting, crosses out a part of
Article VIII, Section 1, of the

A "yes" vote on the proposi
tion will he a vote for the can
eellation of Stanford NSA mem
bership. A "no" vote will be lot
continued membership.

ASSU Constitution, which re
quires a special process for the
nomination of head yell leader
candidates.
At present the Constitution pro
vides that students may run for
all student government positions,
except head yell leader, by sub
mitting a petition signed by 15
students
Article 11, Section 1, part c, pro
vides, "Nominations for Head
Yell Leader shall be made in ac
cordance with Article VIII, Yell
Leaders, Section I of these By-
Laws."
Article VIII, Section 1, part b,
states, "The four incumbent as
sistant yell leaders shall, by rea
son of their offices, qualify as
nominees for the position of head
yell leader.
"1. If there are not at least
three incumbent assistant yell
leaders who wish to be candidates
for the position of Head Yell
Leader, the following procedure
shall take effect:
"(a> The Yell Leader Nomina
tions Board (below membership)
shall select, not less than one nor
more than two weeks prior to the
spring quarter primary election, a
maximum of six candidates (in
cluding both incumbent Assistant
Yell Leaders and those students
nominated by the board) to ap
peal' on the ballot in a primary
election. Any member of the As
sociation except a member of the
freshman class may be nominated
for the office.
"(b) The two candidates ob
taining the highest number of
votes in the primary shall be
placed on the ballot in the final
election.
"2. The four incumbent assist
| ant yell leaders shall declare their
| intention to run for the position
of head yell leader by the eighth
week of winter quarter in the
presence of the chairman of the
election board."
If the amendment is passed
these special provisions will be
crossed out of the Constitution
and students may run for head
yell leader by the 35-person peti
tion method.
