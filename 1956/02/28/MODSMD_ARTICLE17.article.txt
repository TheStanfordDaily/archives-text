Recently an Mil freshman, taken on a
''[•ledge ride 1 ' by the house he was pledging,
\va< drowned in a'reeervuir while attempting to
fiti*l his way hack to the highway to hitch a ride
hie k to campus.
In a poll of its fraternities, the University of
Connecticut attempted lo find out what they
thought of the incident. The paper found that
I I <fut of 18 fraternities did the same sort of
thing.
rhree fraternities felt it was the pledge's
fault entirely. Many felt the incident was "un
fortunate."' But only three felt the practice
should be abolished. .

l he UCLA Daily Bruin editor is attempting
to oust Irv Drasnin, the student body president,
on charges that he falsified elections and has
deliberately worked against the editor's poli
cies.
It is charged that Drasnin knew that people
with false student body cards were voting
against the editor when he was elected.
Drasnin's congratulatory message was "I did
n't want you to win, but congratulations, any
way." Then he promised the Bruin stall he
would work for the editor's recall.
Crowning blow came when Drasnin pub
ii.»hed a front-page editorial in the Bruin with
out the editors knowledge.
I nderstandably this peeved the editor a bit.
How it came about is unexplained.

Columbia and Cornell Universities are at
tempting to institute an honor system some
thing on the order of Stanford's.
