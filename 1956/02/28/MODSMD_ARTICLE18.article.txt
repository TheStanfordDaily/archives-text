The University of Michigan is considering
discontinuing the practice of dormitory segre
gation for freshmen.
Currently students give their race and reli
gion on application forms as well as submitting
pictures.
Defenders of the system say the freshman

This includes common interests, similar
smoking and sleeping habits, and, of course,

The University of Washington has elected 13
campus queens so far this year, one for every
eight school days.
Such titles as Forest Queen, Miss Safe Driv
ing Day and Nickel Hop Mystery Girl have
been bestowed on campus lovelies.
The W ashington Daily suggests that many or
ganizations are missing a chance to get into the
limelight.
Possibilities are many: Sweetheart of Social
Work Students 1 Club, Miss Institute of Aero
Sciences or Chinese Language Club Chop Suev
Girl.
