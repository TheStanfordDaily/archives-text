Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Gauld is not alone in his opinion of KZSU's
"cultural and advertising" policies ("Letters to
Hi'' Editor, Feb. 24), but, as many others who
have bitterly complained about KZSU's program
ming, he has failed to investigate all the factors
involved.
KZSU serves a dual purpose at Stanford —to
; 'isfy the needs of both the students and the
station staff. Based upon information from audi
' mcc slu eys, we broadcast programs which we
hvl are of interest to uie entire Stanford student
body.
Since student interests cover a tremendous
range, our programming necessarily varies from
i lassical music programs, such as "Starlight Con
< i it"and "Music Till Midnight," to more infor
mal shows, such as "Fridav Night Request Time"
;?nd "Pathway to Passion." Each type of show
satisfies the interest of a particular segment of
the student bod'
It we allowei. our programming to drop into a
narrow, spe alized channel directed exclusively
toward those narrow, specialized students inter
• >ted in rar»> classical recordings and discussions
on the effects of the Punic Wars on Asiatic civili
zation of the 17th century, we would indeed have
;i "pitifully small audience" if any audience at
all.
But our programming policy is not aimed at a
mieroscopii audience; rather, as I've said before,
it is directed toward the entire Stanford student
body. When the need arises within the student
body for more programs on a high moral and in
tellectual plane, KZSU will air them.
Until that time, KZSU will continue its present
programming policy consisting mainly of classi
cal music, Stanford news and special events of
interest to the entire student body.
Mr. Gauld should realize that radio cannot be
forced upon a student audience or upon any au
dience, for that matter. The Stanford student

body is not a captive audience of KZSU. If Mr.
Gauld feels "captivated" by this situation, we
consider this a tribute to our present program
ming policy.
KZSU must compete with Mr. Gauld's favorite
station, KEAR, as well as all other stations serv
ing Stanford and vicinity. Because of this com
petition, and because KZSU serves Ihe Stanford
student body exclusively, we must broadcast pro
grams of interest to the majority of our audi
ence.
KZSU is not attempting to imitate KEAR or
any other station. We offer a type of program
ming which cannot, be found anywhere else.
KZSU's programming must also meet the needs
of the students who produce the shows. KZSU
serves as an experimental station for students
interested in radio, either professionally or as a
hobby. Therefore, whenever possible, students
are allowed to produce any type of show they
wish.
In harmony with this educational policy—and,
after all, Mr. Gauld, this is a university national
advertising (including Lucky Strike and Old
Gold) provides valuable experience to students
in handling national advertising accounts.
And, even more important, national advertising
provides money that's spelled m-o-n-e-y, MON
KY. Operating a radio station is expensive, even
without labor costs.
Since Mr. Gauld feels that donations from re
ligious clubs, churches and the ASSIT can make
up for the loss of national ads, we must wain
prospective contributors that donations will have
to considerably exceed $1500. We will be glad to
accept Mr. Gauld's check, any time.
KZSU has no intention of launching a moral
and intellectual crusade. We have a moral and
intellectual mission only to the extent of meeting
the high standards of respectability and good
taste expected of any Stanford organization—and
we are meeting those standards.

KZSU must compete with Mr. Gauld's favorite
station, KEAR, as well as all other stations serv
ing Stanford and vicinity. Because of this com
petition, and because KZSU serves Ihe Stanford
student body exclusively, we must broadcast pro
grams of interest to the majority of our audi
ence.
KZSU is not attempting to imitate KEAR or
any other station. We offer a type of program
ming which cannot, be found anywhere else.
KZSU's programming must also meet the needs
of the students who produce the shows. KZSU
serves as an experimental station for students
interested in radio, either professionally or as a
hobby. Therefore, whenever possible, students
are allowed to produce any type of show they
wish.
In harmony with this educational policy—and,
after all, Mr. Gauld, this is a university national
advertising (including Lucky Strike and Old
Gold) provides valuable experience to students
in handling national advertising accounts.
And, even more important, national advertising
provides money that's spelled m-o-n-e-y, MON
KY. Operating a radio station is expensive, even
without labor costs.
Since Mr. Gauld feels that donations from re
ligious clubs, churches and the ASSIT can make
up for the loss of national ads, we must wain
prospective contributors that donations will have
to considerably exceed $1500. We will be glad to
accept Mr. Gauld's check, any time.
KZSU has no intention of launching a moral

intellectual mission only to the extent of meeting
the high standards of respectability and good
taste expected of any Stanford organization—and
we are meeting those standards.

Mr. Gauld is not alone in his opinion of KZSU's
"cultural and advertising" policies ("Letters to

have bitterly complained about KZSU's program

involved.
KZSU serves a dual purpose at Stanford —to
; 'isfy the needs of both the students and the
station staff. Based upon information from audi
' mcc slu eys, we broadcast programs which we
hvl are of interest to uie entire Stanford student
body.
Since student interests cover a tremendous
range, our programming necessarily varies from
i lassical music programs, such as "Starlight Con

Until that time, KZSU will continue its present
programming policy consisting mainly of classi

Mr. Gauld should realize that radio cannot be
forced upon a student audience or upon any au
