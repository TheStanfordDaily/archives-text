### Dick Frey 
Amid the quarterly tumult of
registration week, one campus or
ganization calmly and repeatedly
works to allay some of the con
fusion.
That group is Alpha Phi Ome
ga, national service fraternity.
Each quarter the A Phi O's ar
rive early to help freshman wom
en move into their residences and
to sell used textbooks to expense
ridden and line-harried students.
A Phi O's are former members
of Boy Scouts of America who
gel together in college to render
services to the University and the
local community.
The fraternity was founded in
1925 at Lafayette College and has
since grown to 270 member uni

pendently of the national office

Other regular activities which
th'e group performs during the
University year include ushering
at dramatic performances, selling
magazine subscriptions, helping
local Scout organizations and do
ing general odd jobs around the

wards, vice-president in charge of
projects; Bill Pope, vice-president
