# On Campus With Max Shulman
## HUSBANDS, ANYONE? 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy with Cheek," etc 
It has been alleged that coeds go to college for the sole purpose
of finding husbands. This is, of course, an infamous canard, and
I give fair warning that small and spongy as 1 am, anybody who
ever says such a dastardly thing when 1 am around had better
be prepared for a sound hiding!
Girls go to college for precisely the same reasons as men do:
to broaden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas, to drink at the
fount of wisdom, to trail their fingers in the main currents of
American thought. Hut if, by chance, while a girl is engaged in
these lofty pursuits, a likely looking husband should pop into
view, why, what's wrong with that? Eh? What's wrong with
that?
The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a hus
band? A great deal has been written on this subject. Some say
character is most important, some say background, some say
appearance, some say education. All are wrong.
The most important thing — bar none — ill a husband is health.
Though he be handsome as Apollo and rich as Captain
McCutchen, what good is he if he just lays around all day
accumulating bedsores ?

The very first thing to do upon meeting .1 man is to make sure
that he is sound of wind and limb. Before he has a chance to
beguile you with his wit and charm, slap a thermometer in his
mouth, roll back his eyelids, yank out his tongue, pftlpate his
thorax, rap his patella, ask him to straighten out a horseshoe
with his teeth. If he fails to pass these few basic tests, phono
for an ambulance and go on to the next prospect.
If, however, he turns out to be physically fit, proceed to the
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to a
sense of humor.
A man who can't take a joke is a man to be shunned. There are
several simple tests to find out whether your prospect can take
a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his tires. Or burn his
"Mad" comics. Or steal his switchblade. Or turn loose his pet
raccoon. Or shave his head.
After each of these merry pranks, laugh gaily and shout
"Aprii Fool!" If he replies, "But this is November 28," or some
thing equally churlish, cross him off your list and thank your
lucky stars you found out in time.
But if he laughs silverly and calls you "Little minx!" then
put him to the next test: Find out whether he is gentle.
The easiest, quickest way to ascertain his gentleness is, of
course. 1o look at the cigarette lie smokes. Is it mild? Is it
clement ? Is it humane? Is it balm to the palate? Does it minister
tenderly to the taste-buds? Does it coddle the nerve-ends? Is it
the perfect accompaniment to today's easier, breezier living?
Is it genial? Is it bright and friendly and full of dulcet pleasure
from cock-crow till the heart of darkness?
Is it, in short, Philip Morris?
If Philip Morris it be, then clasp the man to your bosom with
hoops of steel, for you may bermre that he is gentle as a summer
breeze, gentle as a mother's kiss, gentle to his very marrow.
And now, having found a man who is gentle and healthy and
blessed with a sense of humor, only one thing remains: namely,
to make sure he will always earn a handsome living. That,
fortunately, is very simple. Just enroll him in Engineering.
