# Frosh Baseballers Will Face Santa Clara Broncos Today
## 
### 
The freshman baseball nine
faces the Santa CJara frosh this
afternoon on the freshman dia
mond at 3:15. It will be their first
test of a 16-game slate.
Coach Dick Clegg expects to
work his pitchers for only three
innings, since this will be the first
game. John Gillis, a left-hander
lrom Buffalo, N. Y., will start.
Bob Wallace, a right-hander, will
chuck the next three frames, and
Joel Mogy, another southpaw, is
scheduled to finish up.

Clegg predicts his hustling Pap
ooses will give the Broncos a real
I scrap. He expects the Santa Clar-
I ans to pitch their tall, right-hand
ed fireballer, Jim Gill.
