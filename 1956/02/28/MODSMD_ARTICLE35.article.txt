### Bill Nichols 
Stanford's baseballers pounded

day ov e i* San Francisco State.
Two Card pitchers, Ed Verdur
men and Ray Young, limited the
Gators to just three hits.

innings, Stanford broke out in the j
third with five hits, two walks, i
and the Gators contributed an er
ror and two wild pitches to bring;
in four runs.
That was the ball game, as the;
Staters could never get a runner

The defense sharpened eonsid-j
erably as the Indians made no
