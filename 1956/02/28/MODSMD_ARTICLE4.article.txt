# Council OK's Lockheed Plans For Annexation
## Zoning Approved Over Mild Opposition With Final 10-4 Ballot 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night approved by a 10-to-4 vote
zoning and annexation of the 125.7
acres of Stanford land to be used
by Lockheed Corporation for con
struction of its laboratories.
Main opposition to the zoning
ordinance came from Andrew
Spears, 930 Matadero Avenue,
representing the citizens of the
Barron Park area. Spears protest
ed that the allotted 50-foot buffer
zone between the 210-foot Lock
heed building and his residence
was not enough and asked for a
70-foot zone.
Hershall Brown, representative
of the missile division of Lock
heed, said moving the buildings
would involve redesigning and re
grading at a large cost to the in
dustry.
"If we moved the building," he
said, "we would have to sacrifice
parking area and cut the size of
the building 10 per cent. If we did
this, there would be no use in hav
ing the buildings."
Spears and Councilman Robert
Cummings objected to a lighted
fence surrounding the building
and to the fact that the buildings
themselves would have to be kept
lighted seven nights a week.
Stanford Business Manager Alf
Biandin replied Lockheed could
move the buildings but probably
would not. Two representatives of
the Palo AJto Chamber of Com
merce backed hirn up, saying if
approval was not given the Lock
heed plans, the corporation would
build its plant in some other Pe
ninsula town.
