# Two Views on NSA
## PRO 
### 
The National Student Associa
tion is the only representative na
tional student organization. The
advantages of membership in
NSA cannot be obtained through
regional groups or local student
government.
NSA gives student leaders the
opportunity to get together and
discuss their common problems,
including the purpose of student
government and student activities
similar to the discussions being
held at Stanford since last spring.
Also, Stanford has used the na
tional office information service
to find out what other campuses
are doing with their college
unions and parking problems.
The association also provides
students with a voice in national
affairs, since its policy is listened
to by members of Congress and
leading educators. A good exam
ple of how this policy can affect
every student is the new income
tax law for students who earn
more than $660. The NSA was a
strong factor in getting it intro
duced and passed in Congress.
Before the main NSA congress
meets, meetings on the subcom*
mission and regional level discuss
issues, drawing clear-cut argu
ments on both sides for presenta
tion to the whole body.
Meetings on various subjects
continue through the night at the
congress. Last summer policy was
made on such issues as segrega- j
tion, discrimination, military!
manpower and academic freedom, j
But I feel that one of the most i
important aspects of jhe associa- 1
tion is its part in international re-;
lations. NSA and other democrat-1
ic unions*of students engage in a
constant struggle wilh Commu
nist unions. The Soviets think j
enough of this activity to support j
it with enormous sums of money.
The question is whether the stu- J
dents of Stanford University will'
accept their responsibility to the |
rest of the world student commu
nity.
