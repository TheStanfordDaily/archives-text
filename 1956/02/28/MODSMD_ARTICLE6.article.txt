Our membership in NSA costs
us more than $1000 annually. The
largest part of this pays for our
delegation to the annual congress.
As a social get-together this year's
convention at Minneapolis was a
great success.
This did not, however, leave me
with much to bring hack to the
Stanford student body. All-night
parties cut heavily into the more
serious program, and every morn
ing those of us who were at the
meetings on time found ourselves
lonelier. %
We exchanged problems at the
convention and consequently had
many more of these to bring
home, but because there were no
experienced resource persons we
got few answers. Stanford has the
most to gain from association
with West Coast schools, whose
problems are most similar. We
attend the annual Pacific Student
Presidents Association confer
ence, which costs us about $200.
In the plenary sessions at the
NSA congress we passed resolu
tions pertaining to United States
Congressional policy and to uni
versity policy. We were recom
mending rather than legislating,
and so the essence of each resolu
tion was of chief importance. And
yel most of our time was wasted
on wording and on parliamentary
procedure.
NSA has the dual purpose of
improving student governments
and increasing student awareness
of national and international af
fairs. The latter is something of a
farce because the wrong people
attend; elected and appointed of
ficials do not prove to be the most
interested in and informed on
these issues. I have mentioned
that the former purpose cnn be
achieved through more satisfac
tory media.
