## Apathy and NSA 
### 
Apathy and scant understanding have continually clouded
the issue ol this University's affiliation with the National Stu
dent Association.
The issue will be submitted to the students in a referen
dum today and tomorrow.
'! lie question now lies with students, and we hope the
decision will reflect a mature recognition of the relative mer
its and disadvantages of Stanford's affiliation with other col
leges and universities through the medium of NSA. %
10 acquaint students with the national organization, a de
bate was held last night in Cubberley Auditorium; this de
bale was broadcast over KZSU: brief discussions were held
at house meetings last week; and explanatory articles have
appeared in The Daily.
11 the student body does decide that Stanford's experiment
with NSA over the past year and a half has been successful
and if we can judge from past experience, the battle between
apathy and idealism will not end.
\\ lien students criticize NSA for failing to inflame Stan
ford students, or American students in general, with a fiery
zeal for perfect and beneficial student government, a greater
idealism and tolerance, and a more eager response to the
challenge of the world s problems, they are. not criticizing
the entity "'NSA" but rather the ingenuity, the spark and the
spirit of American youth.
It can hardly be argued that NSA's principles are worth
less, that if -NSA's goals materialized into accomplished fact,
it would be a detriment to society.
(hie of "NSA s goals is to speak as the "voice of American
students, but il this is to be achieved, students must be will
ing to listen and to learn, to speak out and to act when their
consciences direct them to.
It might be well for NSA's critics to first think of the effort
they are willing to exert for the promotion of NSA's ideals
before they attack the organization as being ineffectual and
incapable of grasping its lofty ideals and bringing them down
to earth where they.may produce some concrete accomplish
ments.
If students do not feel NSA ean put their ideals into prac
tice, a negative vote would be the only forthright answer.
A positive vote would indicate a belief that such practical
implementation is possible.
