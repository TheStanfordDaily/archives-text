### 
Seven hundred eighty students went to the polls yesterday to vote
on a proposal to disaffiliate with National Students Association anc'
a constitutional amendment.
"The turnout is better than I expected," said Chuck Faulkner, chair
man of election board, "but many more could still come out and vote."

Voting will continue today from
8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at Engineer
ing Corner. Results will be an
nounced at the ASSU Legislature
meeting at 7:30 tonight.
Faulkner has requested all vot
ing students to carry their stu
ient borly cards, free of casing, so
the cards may be punched without
delaying the election lines.
Constitutional Referendum
The constitutional referendum,
placed on the ballot by a petition
signed by five per cent of the
student body, provides, "Should
Stanford disaffiliate from the Na
tional Students Association?"
A "yes" vote on the proposition
will be a vote for the cancellation
of Stanford NSA membership. A
"no" vote will be for continued
membership.
A simple majority of those vot
ing is needed for approval of the
referendum.
The constitutional amendment,
requiring a two-thirds majority of
those voting, crosses out a part of
Article V, Section 1 of the Con
stitution which requires a special
process for the nomination of
head yell leader candidates.
Right {o Nominate
Article V says."The right to
nominate by petition shall not be
denied for any elective office ex
cept for Head Cheer Leader who
shall be nominated according to
the By-laws of this Constitution."
The passage of the amendment
will eliminate from the Constitu
tion this special yell leader excep
tion, and in effect eliminate part
of Article VIII, Section 1, of the
ASSU by-laws.
At present the ASSU by-laws
provide students may run for all
student government positions, ex
cept head yell leader, by submit
ting a petition signed by 15 stu
dents.
Article VIII, Setion 1, part b,
says,"The four incumbent assist
ant yell leaders shall, by reason
of their offices, qualify as nomi
nees for the position of head yell
leader.
