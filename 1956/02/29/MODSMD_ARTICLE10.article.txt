## 
### 
Stanford varied its normal June commencement date yesterday
to present a diploma 47 years late.
At special ceremonies in Los Angeles Thomas C. Baker, a re
tired mining engineer, was given the diploma he earned in 1910,
signed by President David Starr Jordan and geology department
head John Casper Branner.
Baker was a member of the class of 1909 but his degree in geol
ogy was refused by a professor who contested some figures on a
required senior - paper.
Baker later.proved to be right, but by then he had gone to Ari
zona as engineer with the Miami Copper Company.
.Registrar Harvey Hall discovered the forgotten document in a
vault a few weeks ago and arranged for the special presentation.
Lack of a diploma didn't seem to affect Baker's career, though.
Before his retirement he was manager - of Mexico's Fresnillo Mines,
Nevada's Comstock mine, Australia's Camp Bird mine and was an
established expert in economic handling of low-grade ores.
