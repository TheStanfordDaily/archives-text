speak on "Key Issues of the 1956
Election" tonight at 8 in Cubber
ley Auditorium under the spon
sorship of the Political Union.

Area Young Republican president,
will also speak.
Brown is the acknowledged
leader of the Democratic party in
California, having held the attor
ney-general post—only top state
position occupied by a Democrat
—since 1950.
Currently managing Adlai Ste
venson's California campaign for

nominee under Stevenson.
Born in San Francisco
Brown was born in San Fran
cisco in 1905. He attended the
University of California and the
San Francisco Law School.
His political career began in
1943 when he was elected San
Francisco district attorney. He
was re-elected to that post in 1947.
Also in 1947 he was elected
president of the District Attor
neys' Association of California.
Brown ran for state attorney
general in 1950 against Republi
can Edward S. Shattuck and won
—the only Democratic candidate
for a high state office in thai elec
tion who did.
Turn«d Down Nomination
In 1954 Brown was offered the
Democratic gubernatorial nomi
nation, but turned it down be
cause he felt his job as attorney
general was "not complete" and
because he thought he "owed it:
to the citizens of California to
complete his task."
He was re-elected attorney-gen
eral in the 1954 state elections.
In his talk at Cubberley tonight
Brown will discuss the issues he
thinks will be important to the
