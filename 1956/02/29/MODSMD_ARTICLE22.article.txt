If the State Department's bobble over ship*
men! of tanks to Saudi Arabia serves no
other purpose, at it will bring to the open
the pitiful wish-wash the United States has
been attempting to pass oil' as a "foreign pol
ic\" toward the Middle East.
The tank issue first came to the public e\e
when a New York reporter accidentally stum
bled on the $2,430,000 shipment on a Brooklyn
pier and exploded the story in the press.
The Stat-: Department's handling of the
touch} issue >*ns strange indeed.
When the news first broke, the shipment
was suspended; ;• day later the embargo was
lifted ami the tanks took oft to add a few
more sparks to the Middle East tiuderbox.
Then villi characteristic lack of finesse, See
retary of State Dulles returned from his vaca
tion in the H".liamas to comment that he knew
nothing of the strange shifting sands in the
State Department.
But he promised earnestly he would "bone
up on the issue" prior to appearing before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee which
has challenged him to explain several recent
foreign pclic) blunders.
The United States' position in the Middle
East is precarious at best. The present Arab-
Israel arms race will only be aggravated hv
American-British policy of supplying arms to
both sides to pieserve a "balance of power" in
t he strategic area.
But should we forget these nations entirely,
Communist countries will eagerly jump into
the vacuum as they have already done in Syria,
Egypt, Afghanistan and India.
The existing balance of power would be
thrown off kilter if we ignored the tiny state
of Israel, for Arab states already have received
considerable military aid from the Soviet bloc.
As a responsible world leader, the United
States must arrive at a consistent policy in her
arms contributions.
She must redirect her attentions toward
more positive solutions including greater eco
nomic and technical aid, now sadly deficient,
and an effective compromise between the gun
toting Arabs and Israelis.
