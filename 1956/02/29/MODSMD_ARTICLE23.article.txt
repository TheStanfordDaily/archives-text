# 'Political Football' or U.S. Blunder? —Opposing Middle Eastern Outlooks
## 
### Jim Palmer 
As political an certain partisans would like
to make it, recent "confusion" concerning the
lank shipment to Saudi Arabia must go down
as an administrative matter in a non-political
sphere.
I nfortunalely for the United States' inter
national standing, some factions have latched
on to the issue and are turning it into the po
litical football Dr. Arthur Young deplored in
his speech here Sunday night.
To comprehend the incident as indicative
of a weak Middle East policy by the Eisen
hower Administration is to misinterpret the
facts, in which a number of pundits have in
dulged.
Actually the crisis in the Arab-Israel area has
presented problems well recognized by the
Administration: How to maintain peace and
prevent a weapons race with both of the two
sides requesting arms? How to keep Kussia
from gaining a foothold by furnishing the
arms which the U.S. won't furnish?
Balance has been the key policy advocated
by the Administration— balance and attempts
at harmony through the proper diplomatic
channels.
On first blush it might seem a shipment of
tanks to Saudi Arabia would upset the bal
ance. This is the reason why tanks were with
held from shipment by officials while signals
were rechecked.
It was apparent to President Eisenhower
and Secretary Dulles that not fulfilling the
Arabian request of a year ago would be an
upsetting factor. Going ahead with the ship
ment might actually help maintain the desired
balance.
Failure to send the promised shipment
would discredit the U.S. with the Arabs and
lead them to place their order with the
Soviets.
The "confusion" charge should be dismissed
for what it was, an administrative signal
checking which can be found in any organiza
tion of complex size.
Any further intimation, as Dr. Young sug
gested, must be written off as political because
of the impending election year.
