'Subtle Parody**
Editor, The Daily:
Either The Daily's reviewer completely missed
the point of "Chiaroscuro" (a common StanDai
reviewer trait) or he continued the tone of the
one-act with a tongue-in-cheek review.
Those who did not. see the play would infer
from last Thursday's Daily that "Chiaroscuro"
was literally a "stark tragedy" rife with father
son conflicts and "racial issues intermixed with
attempted abortion."
It would be inhumane to consider "Chiaros
curo" as serious drama. On the contrary, it was
an extremely successful satire. The author skill
fully combined an untold number of the most
decrepit dramatic conflicts known to man, and
came up with a fast-moving One-Act. to end all
One-Acts.
Purists might claim it to be an act and a third,
however, sii ce the lights were cut and the set.
swept in preparation for the big scene. It was at:
this point that father faced son, and each conflict
in turn was worked over with fiery dialogue.
When considered as a satire, the play was a
minor masterpiece, cleverly written, and, with
one or two exceptions, acted with restraint. In
deed, "Ch irosruro" is comparable to Stephen
Leacock's classic literary caricatures.
All concerned deserve praise- -not for "stark
tragedy," but for subtle parody.

Editor's Note: "Chiaroscuro," although pos
sibly intended to be satire, did not apprar so to
many spectators, including our reviewer. It
seemed to be tragedy with a bit of its edge
taken off by the work of minor characters,
partly through satire.
Our reviewer said, "Especially good was the
plot. . . . very well played was tiie part of -lack
. . . also well played are the lead roles . . . well
directed."
In short, w liked "Chiaroscuro," stark trag
edy, subtle parody, or whatever.
A dramatic presentation is only what it ap
pears to its audience to be. whatever the au

thor's intention. If the spectator says it is trag
edy then tragedy it is, even if the author meant
the play to be satire.
'Leap to Attention*
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial, "Double Welcome," which ap
peared in Friday's Daily was both interesting and
provocative. In welcoming General Young to the
Stanford campus, the writer stated that the Gen
eral occupies a position, as Sixth Army Com
mander, of equal importance with that of a gov
ernor or senator.
We would like to take issue with this statement.
In the system of American government, the mili
tary is subordinate to civil rule. American citi
zens, through their elected representatives and
officials, including .senators and governors, are
responsible for the establishment and mainte
nance of the military.
This fact was both a comfort and a support for
those of us who served in the military. We are
happy to recognize the general as a hard-working
public servant. Hut please don't expect us to leap
to attention.

Editor's Note: We did not say the General
occupies a position equally important with that
of a governor or senator. What we said was,
"We'd guess that they [the six United States
Army Commanders| would rank about even
with a governor or a senator."
We asked no one to "leap to attention"; we
merely welcomed a V.I.F. who has responsibil
ity for the protection of an area comprising
eight states (more territory than any governor
or senator can claim).
We agree that there is not sufficient interest
in activities for training future civilian leaders?
the Fnited States has too few trained public
servants; too many who drift into the political
field through "the back door," as it were.
However, in the unsettled world of today, we
also need military leaders (distinguished men
such as General Young) and the Waiter Army
Society does fill a void in helping train such
leaders.
