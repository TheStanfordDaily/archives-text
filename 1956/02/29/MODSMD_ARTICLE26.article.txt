# Stanford Is Only Major Pacific Coast University Having Own Memorial Church
## 
### Dave Canfield 
For 53 years Stanford has stood
out as the only major university
on the West Coast with its own
church.
Memorial Church, dedicated
Jan. 25, 1903, has in 53 years be
come one of the centers of Uni
versity life.
"Memorial Church," Chaplain
Robert Minto said proudly, "is the
church of the community. Alumni
like to get married here and have
their children baptized here. It's
the one connecting link between
alumni and Stanford."
Fifty thousand people visit Me
morial Church each year, Minto
estimated.
More important than serving as
I a tourist attraction, the church,
according to Assistant Chaplain
David H. Romeis, "attempts to
meet the needs of the community
in as many ways as possible."
For example, Romeis put in a
considerable amount of time last
fall talking to members of the
Stanford varsity football team.
"This doesn't mean football is
any more important than rugby
or any other sport," pointed out
the assistant chaplain, "but 1 feel
j my presence on the athletic field
is every bit as important as my
presence in the-vestry office."
Another activity that takes the
two chaplains away from the ves
try is the hospital visitation pro
gram.
Each morning Chaplains Minto

or Romeis drives out (o the Palo
Alto Hospital, to private homes
and to University residences and
gives spiritual guidance to inca-

pacitated students, facully mom
bers and staff members.
Within the church itself Memo
rial Church conducts a Monday
night, study group, daily prayer
services, Wednesday night candle
light services and Friday Holy
Communion services. •
! Daily prayer services and week

ly Iloly Communion services are
innovations this year.
Students are also free to walk
into the vestry and make use of
the books and art in its' religious
library.
The newest service of Memorial
Church, added three weeks ago, is
the Stan 112 or d Village church
school sponsored in cooperation
with the Village's Family Council.
But the most important church
function is, of course, the Sunday
morning service. "We try to bring
preachers from all over the coun
try," explained the Glasgow Uni
versity graduate, "and have them
meet students while they're here."
Famous preachers who have
graced Memorial Church's pulpit
include Reinhold Ne4buhr, pro
fessor of applied Christianity at
Union Theological Seminary, and
Paul Tillich, professor of religion
at Harvard.
In the future Rev. Minto hopes
lo acquire permanent floodlights
to illuminate Memorial Church at
night.

REV. ROBERT MINTO
Stanford Chaplain
For 53 years Stanford has stood
out as the only major university
on the West Coast with its own
church.
Memorial Church, dedicated
Jan. 25, 1903, has in 53 years be
come one of the centers of Uni
versity life.
"Memorial Church," Chaplain
Robert Minto said proudly, "is the
church of the community. Alumni
like to get married here and have
their children baptized here. It's
the one connecting link between
alumni and Stanford."
Fifty thousand people visit Me
morial Church each year, Minto
estimated.
More important than serving as
I a tourist attraction, the church,
according to Assistant Chaplain
David H. Romeis, "attempts to
meet the needs of the community
in as many ways as possible."
For example, Romeis put in a
considerable amount of time last
fall talking to members of the
Stanford varsity football team.
"This doesn't mean football is
any more important than rugby
or any other sport," pointed out
the assistant chaplain, "but 1 feel
j my presence on the athletic field
is every bit as important as my
presence in the-vestry office."
Another activity that takes the
two chaplains away from the ves
try is the hospital visitation pro
gram.
Each morning Chaplains Minto

or Romeis drives out (o the Palo
Alto Hospital, to private homes
and to University residences and
gives spiritual guidance to inca-

pacitated students, facully mom
bers and staff members.
Within the church itself Memo
rial Church conducts a Monday
night, study group, daily prayer
services, Wednesday night candle
light services and Friday Holy
Communion services. •
! Daily prayer services and week

ly Iloly Communion services are
innovations this year.
Students are also free to walk
into the vestry and make use of
the books and art in its' religious
library.
The newest service of Memorial
Church, added three weeks ago, is
the Stan 112 or d Village church
school sponsored in cooperation
with the Village's Family Council.
But the most important church
function is, of course, the Sunday
morning service. "We try to bring
preachers from all over the coun
try," explained the Glasgow Uni
versity graduate, "and have them
meet students while they're here."
Famous preachers who have
graced Memorial Church's pulpit
include Reinhold Ne4buhr, pro
fessor of applied Christianity at
Union Theological Seminary, and
Paul Tillich, professor of religion
at Harvard.
In the future Rev. Minto hopes
lo acquire permanent floodlights
to illuminate Memorial Church at
