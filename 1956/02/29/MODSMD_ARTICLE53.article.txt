### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 28 (U.R)
-The relentless University of
San Francisco Dons stormed to
their 48th straight victory tonight
and cinched a berth in the NCAA
tournament.
College of Pacific met its fate,
87-49, as USF's Bill Russell tipped
through 28 points.
The 38-point margin was the
largest that the Dons have posted
this season. And they lost little
time handing the Tiger the "shock
treatment."
Blond Carl Boldt took second
place in the scoring honors for
USF with 22 points.
