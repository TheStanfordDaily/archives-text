## Willie the Whale Flails Scoring, Rebounding; Brown, Bond Top Card Hoopmen 
### 
UCLA's devastating duo Willie Naulls of the unstoppable rebound
and Morrie Tuft of the floating jump shot- continue to monopolize
Pacific Coast Conference scoring.
PCC statistics released yesterday show Naulls and Taft one-two in
both total scoring and average points a game. Taft is also second in

field goal accuracy.
For Stanford, little Georgie Sel
leck still maintains a grip on fifth «
place in the scoring race.
Individual scoring honors go
like this:
• Naulls is way out in front
with a 12-game total of 272 points
for an average of 22.7.
• Taft has 2-48 points for a 20.7
average.
• Larry Bock of Washington
State, who harassed the Indians
last weekend, presses Taft with
245 points a 20.4 average for 12
games.
• Bruno Boin, Washington's
hook shot sensation, is next with
236 points in 14 games for a 16.8
average.
• Selleck is one point back with
235 for a 16.7 average.
• Sixth this week, after being
conference leader earlier ihis
month, is Dave Gambee of Ore
gon State with 234 points.
• Stanford's Bill Bond and Bar
ry Brown are next in line with 224
and 186 points for averages ol" 16
and 13.3, respectively.
In the field goal department,
Taft, while he has more buckets
than anyone in the loop, trails
Cal's Boh Blake in accuracy.
Blake has tossed through 59
baskets for a .464 percentage.
Taft's 96 goals are 45.8 per cent
of his shots.
Selleck leads the Indians and is
eighth in the conference with a
.416 percentage. His 93 field goals
rank him third in the PCC behind
Taft's 96 and Naulls' 95.
In the free throw department,
Stanford has only one man Bond :
in the lop 15. And Bond is 15th. j
He's netted 62 charity tosses for a j
.706 percentage.
Doyle Per k ins, Washington
play-maker, heads the list with a
.792 percentage, or 38 out of 48
tries.
Blake is Ihird with a .775 mark
and Naulls is seventh at .732.
In the rebounding statistics, it's
Naulls overwhelmingly. He has
grabbed 179 off the boards, which
is 16.7 per cent of the possible re
bounds in his games.
That gives Willie the Whale
leadership in both departments.
Brown of the Cards is fourth in
both, with 138 rebounds for a .119
percentage. He is the only Indian
hoGpster in the top 15.
Bill Flanders and Gary Van Gal- \
der are the other two Stanford
men named in the statistical com-'
pilation. Flanders has tallied 81 j
points for a 5.8 average and Van
Galder has 57 points for a 4.11
average.
