the traveling team for the na
tional championships at Yale next
month. The Fullerton meet will
be the last competition for the In
dians before the nationals.
"Stanford faces a severe dis
advantage each year at the na
tionals," said swimming coach
Tom Haynie. "All the other teams
are at the end of their conference
seasons; ours doesn't even begin
until after the nationals are over.
"This means that, while eastern
schools can watch how the swim-'
mers fare in a season of competi
tion, I've got to pick my team on
the basis of one or two show
ings," Haynie continued.
Takes Seven
"I really don't know yet myself
who is going," Haynie said. "We
usually take about seven men. but
right now there are about 10 who
have a chance to go.
"It will depend upon who is
consistently the fastest by the
time the Fullerton meet rolls
around."
The mentor did admit that the
crack four-man relay team is a
cinch to go. The team will be com
posed of Doug Ackerman, Robin
Moore, Carver Nixon and either
Tom Burton or Phil Gay.
"There's quite a bit of rivalry
already among the team members
themselves," Haynie said, "and
that's just what we need to get
the best men."
The swimmer with the best
chance of capturing an individual
national title is Cole Wilbur. Wil
bur has been clocked unofficially
in the 100- and 150-yard breast
strokes at belter than the world
record.
Specialty
In New Haven, Wilbur will
swim his specialty, the 200-yard
breast-stroke, in a pool almost
identical to Stanford's.
Also vying for berths on the
traveling squad are backstroker
Ron Grunt, distance ace Tad De
vine and Fred Miller.
Despite the lack of meets, Hay
nie expects his team to be in top
shape by the end of next month.
Cancellation of the water polo
season has given the swimmers
more time in which to prepare.

Tn just two weeks, the Stanford swimming team takes on the na
tional junior college champions from Fullerton.
But victory, which should come easily for the Cards, is not the
important issue.
