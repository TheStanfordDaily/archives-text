# STANFORD SYMPHONY
## Salgo, Crosten 'Excellent' In Tuesday Series Concert 
### Julie Olson 
Sandor Salgo demonstrated his great talent and ability as he mod
estly and humbly conducted the Stanford Symphony through a mag
nificent performance last night at the Tuesday Evening Series.
The orchestra played four - different pieces, each requiring entirely
different orchestral tT-eatment.
The opening number, Haydn's Symphony in G major, showed off

aaigo s aouuy to oienn rnemes
and harmonies. The difficult pas
sages of alternating rests and
string phrases were played per
fectly.
Outstanding were the strong
French horn section and the oboe
solo in the Largo.
In complete contrast to Haydn
was Kodaly's Concerto for Or
chestra. It is not fair to judge a
modern composition like this
upon first hearing it.
Its confusion of harmonies is
difficult for any orchestra to play
and it is a tribute to Salgo's skill
that he interpreted and conducted
this complicated piece with such
effortlessness and understanding.
The instrumental solos, especially
the cello, piccolo, oboe, and
French horn solos, were well done
and pleasant to hear.
Climax of the concert w;is Mo
zart's Concerto for Piano and Or
chestra in C minor, played by
William Loran Crosten, professor
of music at Stanford.
In every way this selection was
perfect. Crosten's artistry was
precise, his phrasing was warm
and relaxed and his style was
clear and dignified.
The orchestra under Salgo's
leadership was the perfect accom
paniment. In this piece as well
as in the others the orchestra
demonstrated its ability to play
softly yet with sureness and feel
ing a difficult thing for an or
chestra to do well. The bassoon
solo in the second movement was
excellent.
Ravel's "Alborada del Gracioso"
was the last selection of the eve
ning. In this piece the ability of
the orchestra to use dynamics
was shown to advantage.
