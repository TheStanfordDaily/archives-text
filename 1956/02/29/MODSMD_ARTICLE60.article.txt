Behind the five-hit hurling of
Walt Payne --and Ray Looney,
Stanford's baseballers whitewash
ed College of the Pacific, 5-0, on
the Sunken Diamond yesterday
for their second shutout victory
in as m«hy days.
It Was COP's 35th consecutive
defeat and continued a three-year
losing streak.
Sharp fielding by third base-,
nan Rudy Figueroa and second- j
sacker AI Shaw contributed to
our Indian double plays which I
prevented the Tigers from getting 1
i runner as far as third base dur-1
ng the rain-dampened game.
Payne tossed live innings, whif
fing five at the plate and allowing
three singles. Looney, playing his
first varsity ball game, was shaky j
in his first innings but grew]
stronger at the last.
Payne Doubles
Only Indian able to collect two j
hits was shortstop Steve Stewart,
who singled twice for one RBI.
Payne collected a double and an
Rlil.
Coach Dutch Fehring's charges
jumped to a one-run lead in the
first inning when Mickey Holz- j
man walked, went to second on a j
ground-out by Figueroa, moved to |
third on a fielder's choice and
romped home on a single by
catcher Doug Camilli.
Two more scores came in the
second. After a walk, a stolen j
base and an error, S'ewart came j
home on a wild pitch by loser Del
Whittier. With Hal Messner on

second, Payne knocked a solid
double to left field to send across
the third tally.
The Indians added one in the
third when a Camilli single and a
Stewart ground-out sent Figue
roa, who had walked, around from
first to pay-dirt.
Final Tally
The final tally was added in a
rainy sixth inning as Looney sac
rificed right fielder A 1 Spurgeon
across alter' a pair of singles.
Right-hander Payne was never
in serious trouble. A trio of errors
in the second inning put COP run
ners on first and second, but
Payne interspersed the bobbles
with three strikeouts to end the
threat. *
In sharp contrast to the fine
infield work of Figueroa and]
Shaw were the five Indian errors, j
three on Stewart and two on
Payne. But none was serious, as j
COP was ineffectual at the bat.
Rain Flurry
A flurry of rain in the bottom j
of the sixth sent spectators scur
rying and for a while threatened !
to end the game short at seven
frames.
But the drops stopped falling
during the seventh, and COP was
able to take the loss on a full nine
inning basis.
Fehring substituted freely in
the later innings, and the only
starling player who finished was
Shaw.
Friday the Indians seek their- 1
third straight against the Univer-1
sity of San Francisco, and Satur- j
day they go against San Jose
State. Both games will be played
in the Sunken Diamond.

base and an error, S'ewart came j
home on a wild pitch by loser Del
Whittier. With Hal Messner on

second, Payne knocked a solid
double to left field to send across
the third tally.
The Indians added one in the
third when a Camilli single and a
Stewart ground-out sent Figue
roa, who had walked, around from
first to pay-dirt.
Final Tally
The final tally was added in a
rainy sixth inning as Looney sac
rificed right fielder A 1 Spurgeon
across alter' a pair of singles.
Right-hander Payne was never
in serious trouble. A trio of errors
in the second inning put COP run
ners on first and second, but
Payne interspersed the bobbles
with three strikeouts to end the
threat. *
In sharp contrast to the fine
infield work of Figueroa and]
Shaw were the five Indian errors, j
three on Stewart and two on
Payne. But none was serious, as j
COP was ineffectual at the bat.
Rain Flurry
A flurry of rain in the bottom j
of the sixth sent spectators scur
rying and for a while threatened !
to end the game short at seven
frames.
But the drops stopped falling
during the seventh, and COP was
able to take the loss on a full nine
inning basis.
Fehring substituted freely in
the later innings, and the only
starling player who finished was
Shaw.
Friday the Indians seek their- 1
third straight against the Univer-1
sity of San Francisco, and Satur- j
day they go against San Jose
State. Both games will be played
in the Sunken Diamond.
