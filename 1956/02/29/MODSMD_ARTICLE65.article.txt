# Fehring Predicts Better Season for Card Nine
## Rookie Coach Expects Stronger Hitting, Tighter Pitching, More Bench Strength 
### Jim Price 
Stanford's varsity baseballers can look forward to improvement
over last year, aceording to rookie coach Dutch Fehring. Fehring,
who is entering his first season as head coach of the Indian nine after
replacing Everett Dean, said that the other members of the PCC's
Southern Division and the CIBA will also be stronger.

The Indians will show vast im
provement in hitting this year
with the addition of A 1 Shaw,
Doug Camilli and A 1 Spurreon:
from last year's frosh and trans
fer Steve Stewart. Last season's]
top batter, third â€¢ baseman Rudy
Figueroa, is also returning.
Mound Depth
Pitching should also be out-1
standing with greater depth and
experience. Fehring expects to
have at least four starters in co
captain Hay Young, Ed Verdur-1
men, Walt Payne and Hay Loo
ney. Of the four, only Young is
a senior.
In fact, on the entire squad
there are only three seniors. Be
sides Young there are co-captain 1
Bob-Evans and Mickey Holzman,
both outfielders.
Fehring is hoping to get in as
many early season games as pos
sible in order to give many of Ihe
younger players sufficient expe
rience before the league season's
opening. At present there are four
sophomores in the starting line
up including Camilli, Spurgeon, |
Shaw and shortstop Bob Flanders.
More Depth
With the addition of the many
talented sophomores and trans
fers, Fehring said, "we will have
more depth this year than we've
had in a few years." Three of
the outstanding transfer players,
first-baseman Merle Lauderdale, i
who should put up a strong fight i
for the first sack job, Ralph Hold- J
ing and A 1 Pollack, are tempo-1
rarily ineligible due to a league
technicality.
The Indians, with a schedule of
35 games, will again compete in
two leagues. In addition to the
Southern Division of the Coast
Conference, consisting of Stan

ford, Cal, UCLA and Southern
Cal, Santa Clara joins in to form
the California Intercollegiate
; Baseball Association.
Coach Fehring mentioned sev
eral points which point up the
improvements on all of these
; teams.
Cal's base bailers will be
I strengthened by members of last
year's outstanding frosh team
which was undefeated in 1G
i games. Among the standouts are
basket bailers Earl Robinson and
Bernie Simpson, both of whom
i are as hot on the diamond as they
are on the basketball court. Hob
; inson, a first-baseman, batted
! near the .500 mark for the frosh.
Japan Tour
I USC's Trojans took a tour to
Japan during the summer, taking
two or three of their outstanding
freshman performers. The Tro
jans played several games against
Japanese teams which had also
112 u r n i she d opposition for the
group of major league all-stars
headed by Lefty O'Doul which an
nually plays Japanese teams.
This experience afforded some
! helpful practice as a unit for this
j year's Trojan team which opened
its season by handily defeating a
group of major league all-stars.
After a pair 01 weak seasons,
Santa Clara's Broncos should
again be fairly strong. Last year's
Bronco nine only won one CIBA
contest.
One of the highlights of the
Card baseball season will be the
annual spring vacation tour of
Southern California. This year's
tour will include two games with
; San Diego State and one each
: with the Marine Corps Recruiting
l Depot and UCLA.
