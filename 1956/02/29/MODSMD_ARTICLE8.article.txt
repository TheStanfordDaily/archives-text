# Ike Expected To Reveal Big Decision Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (U.R)
President Eisenhower may toll
the nation before noon tomorrow
whether he will seek a second
term.
Speculation that he is ready to
answer the big question rose
sharply today when the White
House announced today that the
President will hold a news con
ference at 10:30 a.m. (1:30 p.m.
PST) tomorrow.
News Secretary James C. I lag
orty, who made the announce
ment, sidestepped all efforts to
draw him out fin whether Eisen
hower will take the occasion to
reveal his intentions. Hut many
top Republicans expect him to
at least a qualified "yes" to
their pleas that ho stand for re
election.
These Republicans also admit,
however. I hat their optimism is
based on little more than what
House GOP Leader Joseph W.
Martin Jr. (Mass.) described as a
"Yankee guess."
As far as could be learned, Mr.
Eisenhower has not told anyone
what his decision will be or when
he intends to announce it.
The President passed up an op
portunity to lot GOP Congres
sional leaders in on his plans to
day when ho conferred with them
for more than an hour at the
White House.
There was some indication that
his decision will bo a relatively
last - minute matter. Hagerty,
asked if the announcement is ox
poctod tomorrow, said, "I would
not know."
