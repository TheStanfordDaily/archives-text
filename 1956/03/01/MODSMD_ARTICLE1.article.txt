# LASSU VOIDS AMENDM
## Ike Confident of Ability To Do 'As Well as Ever' Favorable? Medical Reports Aid In Making Decision 
### 
WASHINGTON, FeD. 29 <UP>
President Eisenhower told the
American people tonight he is
willing to accept a second term.
He said he is convinced he can
perform his presidential chores
"as well as I ever have."
While underscoring that the fi
nal decision on his candidacy rests
with the Republican party and
the public, Mr. Eisenhower said
he has received "favorable re
ports" from his doctors on his re
covery from his Sept. 24 heart
attack.
He also said his decision was
prompted by the advice he had
received when he "consulted lit
erally with multitudes" of people
on whether he should run. He con
ceded his health involved some
"undetermined" additional risk
but that this was "not great."
Announced Earlier
The President, who announced
his second-term decision at a news
conference earlier, explained his
Feasoos in a report to the people
carried over all radio and televi
sion networks. He spoke from
notes he had prepared earlier.
"The work that I set out four
years ago to do has not yet reach
ed the state of development and
fruition that I then hoped could
be accomplished within the period
of a single term in this office,"
the President said..
"So if the American people
choose, under the circumstances
I have described, I shall persist in
the way that has been charted by
my associates and myself. I shall
continue, with earnestness, sin
cerity and enthusiasm, to dis
charge the duties of this office."
Jubilant GOP
Jubilant Republicans, who had
waited long and anxiously for this
word from the man who led them
to national control in 1952, served
notice after his news conference
statement that they considered
his stand a flat "yes."
They predicted Mr. Eisenhower
would be renominated by accla
mation, score an "overwhelming"
victory in next November's elec
tions and carry a GOP Congress
back into power with him. Demo
crats dissented and said the Presi
dent's health would be a major
issue.
Addressing "my fellow citizens"
from his White House office, Mr.
Eisenhower said he wanted to talk
to them directly about his second
term decision, which, he said, he
had reached only "after the most
careful and devoutly prayerful
consideration."
"Aims on Record"
Mr. Eisenhower said the aims,
efforts, accomplishments and fu
ture plans of his Administration
arc on the record, and "those
facts constitute my personal plat
form."
The President said he wanted
these facts made clear so every
delegate to the GOP convention
will know that he would "wage no
political campaign in the custom
ary patlern."
"Thereafter, if the people of
the country should elect me, I
shall continue to serve them in
the office I now hold. I have con
eluded that I should permit the
American people to have ihe op
portunity to register their deci
sion in this matter."

notes he had prepared earlier.
"The work that I set out four
years ago to do has not yet reach
ed the state of development and
fruition that I then hoped could
be accomplished within the period
of a single term in this office,"
the President said..
"So if the American people
choose, under the circumstances
I have described, I shall persist in
the way that has been charted by
my associates and myself. I shall
continue, with earnestness, sin
cerity and enthusiasm, to dis
charge the duties of this office."
Jubilant GOP
Jubilant Republicans, who had
waited long and anxiously for this
word from the man who led them
to national control in 1952, served
notice after his news conference
statement that they considered
his stand a flat "yes."
They predicted Mr. Eisenhower
would be renominated by accla
mation, score an "overwhelming"
victory in next November's elec
tions and carry a GOP Congress
back into power with him. Demo
crats dissented and said the Presi
dent's health would be a major
issue.
Addressing "my fellow citizens"
from his White House office, Mr.
Eisenhower said he wanted to talk
to them directly about his second
term decision, which, he said, he
had reached only "after the most
careful and devoutly prayerful
consideration."
"Aims on Record"
Mr. Eisenhower said the aims,
efforts, accomplishments and fu
ture plans of his Administration
arc on the record, and "those
facts constitute my personal plat
form."
The President said he wanted
these facts made clear so every
delegate to the GOP convention
will know that he would "wage no
political campaign in the custom
ary patlern."
"Thereafter, if the people of
the country should elect me, I
shall continue to serve them in
the office I now hold. I have con
eluded that I should permit the
American people to have ihe op
portunity to register their deci
sion in this matter."


PRESIDENT DWK;HT D. EISENHOWER
". . . if the American people choose . . ."
WASHINGTON, FeD. 29 <UP>
President Eisenhower told the
American people tonight he is
willing to accept a second term.
He said he is convinced he can
perform his presidential chores
"as well as I ever have."
While underscoring that the fi
nal decision on his candidacy rests
with the Republican party and
the public, Mr. Eisenhower said
he has received "favorable re
ports" from his doctors on his re
covery from his Sept. 24 heart
attack.
He also said his decision was
prompted by the advice he had
received when he "consulted lit
erally with multitudes" of people
on whether he should run. He con
ceded his health involved some
"undetermined" additional risk
but that this was "not great."
Announced Earlier
The President, who announced
his second-term decision at a news
conference earlier, explained his
Feasoos in a report to the people
carried over all radio and televi
sion networks. He spoke from
notes he had prepared earlier.
"The work that I set out four
