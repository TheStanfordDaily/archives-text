N esterelay Dwight 1). Eistenhower.announced
lie would be. a candidate for President this year.
This creates a dilemma for the Democrats since
lhe incumbent is a hard man to beat, as Thomas
Dewey found out in 1948.
I he Democrats will meet in Chicago a week
before the Republicans gather in San Fran
cisco, and to date there are only two avowed
candidates for the Democratic nomination. The
1952 standard-bearer, Adlai Stevenson, and
I cnuessee Senator Fates Kefauver have entered
in several primaries. Two governors, Averill
Harriman of New York and Frank Lausche of
Ohio, also have a fair measure of support from
the wings.
These four appear to have the inside track
to the nomination, especially since the conven
tion is late in summer and chances of an un
known dark horse can be considered slight.
Stevenson is the logical candidate if the com
ments of Stanford students can be relied upon.
All but two of those interviewed favored the
ex-Illinois governor.
1 he question posed was "Who do you think
is the best Democratic candidate for the Presi
dency?"
JACK LATTA, '56, Tovon—"Stevenson, be
cause his opinions and philosophies are in tune
with the conservative feeling in the country
today.""
MARINA KELLY, '58, Jordan—"The only
Democrat with enough national stature is Ste
venson. The others aren't well enough known.
Even though Eisenhower has beaten Stevenson,
I think Eisenhower will lose this time."
