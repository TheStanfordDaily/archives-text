TONY HODGE, '56, Theta Chi — "They
might as well reincarnate FDR. Nobody can
beat Ike—at least nobody apparent now. Ste
venson is a one-time loser."
JUDY McDANIEL, graduate, off-campus—
"I think Stevenson is the best candidate for
the Democratic party. He has the ability to
express complex political ideas in terms that
not only Americans, but also the rest of the
world, can understand. In his personality, he
represents more of what a President should be
than any other of the Democratic candidates."
TOM POLiLSON, "59, Roble—"Stevenson, J
think, because he is a very intelligent man, and
he has the best interests of the people at heart."
AL LOOM IS. "56, Toyon—"Stevenson is the
only one with a chance. Kefauver can't sell his
brand of liberalism to the American people;
Harriman and Kefauver are both much weaker
than Stevenson, even against Eisenhower. The
only other possibility is Governor Lausche be
cause of his conservative backing and accepta
bility in the South."
MARSHA McEACHERN, '58, Lagunita —
"Harriman. because he is the only Democrat
who can win votcs«away from Eisenhower. I'm
sure the President will win though."
GAIL FOW LER, *59, Roble—"l would say
Stevenson because be has principles as well as
being a clever politician."
DICK JONES, graduate, off-campus—"Adlai
Stevenson. He appears to have a wider appeal
to a greater number of Democrats. He has par
ticular charm as far as the university intelli
gence is concerned with his incisive style and
brilliant mind."
