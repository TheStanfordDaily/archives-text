# Alabama Must Readmit Suspended Negro Coed
## University Cleared of Contempt Charges; Officials 'Cannot Ensure' Miss Lucy's Safety 
### 
BIRMINGHAM. Ala., Feb. 29 (U.R)—A federal .judge ordered the
University of Alabama to reinstate its suspended Negro coed by 9 a.m.
Monday because no one can "carve out a province in north Alabama"
to defy the Supreme Court.
But Judge Hobart Grooms cleared university officials of contempt

charges. He said he did not find
them "derelict in their duty" in
barring Autherine Lucy, 26, from
the campus because of riots.
Judge Grooms ordered her re
admitted despite a warning from
the witness stand by a university
trustee that she "probably will be
killed" if she returns to the cam
pus.
However, University President
O. C. Carmichael promised in ad
vance of the trial to follow the
court's order in the case, although
it might require extra police to
protect Miss Lucy on her return.
Gov. James E. Folsom has pledg
ed indirect support, saying he
would do "all in my power" to
prevent mob rule at the univer
sity or anywhere else in Alabama.
Judge Grooms said, before read
ing the order, that "there is some
feeling this court should carve out
a province in north Alabama and
should defy the Supreme Court
of the United States."
He said Miss Lucy had been ad
mitted under direction of a Su
preme Court decision. Her par
ticular case has not yet reached
the Supreme Court, but Judge
Grooms apparently was banking
on the high court's sweeping rul
ing against segregated public edu
cation of May 17. 1954.
Attorney Andrew Thomas, for
the University of Alabama, would
not comment immediately, but
said the university still plans to
go ahead with an appeal to the
Supreme Court on the original
order directing Miss Lucy's ad
mission.
The strongest warnings against
possible consequences sho u I d
Miss Lucy return were voiced by
a member of Ihe university trus
tees, who said she would risk pos
sible death and that no steps could
be taken now or in the near fu
ture to ensure she would be safe.
At Tuscaloosa, 58 miles away,
the president of the Alabama stu
dent body urged his classmates to
accept Miss Lucy's re-entry in a
"sensible, intelligent and mature
manner."
Since the decision has become
final, said student President Wal
ter Flowers Jr. <>112 Tuscaloosa, "I
sincerely hope that ;ill students
and friends of the university will
put their faith in university of
ficials."

Attorney Andrew Thomas, for
the University of Alabama, would
not comment immediately, but
said the university still plans to
go ahead with an appeal to the
Supreme Court on the original
order directing Miss Lucy's ad
mission.
The strongest warnings against
possible consequences sho u I d

a member of Ihe university trus
tees, who said she would risk pos
sible death and that no steps could
be taken now or in the near fu
ture to ensure she would be safe.
At Tuscaloosa, 58 miles away,
the president of the Alabama stu
dent body urged his classmates to
accept Miss Lucy's re-entry in a
"sensible, intelligent and mature
manner."
Since the decision has become
final, said student President Wal

sincerely hope that ;ill students
and friends of the university will
put their faith in university of

BIRMINGHAM. Ala., Feb. 29 (U.R)—A federal .judge ordered the
University of Alabama to reinstate its suspended Negro coed by 9 a.m.
Monday because no one can "carve out a province in north Alabama"
to defy the Supreme Court.
But Judge Hobart Grooms cleared university officials of contempt

charges. He said he did not find
them "derelict in their duty" in
barring Autherine Lucy, 26, from
the campus because of riots.
Judge Grooms ordered her re
admitted despite a warning from
the witness stand by a university
trustee that she "probably will be
killed" if she returns to the cam
pus.
However, University President
O. C. Carmichael promised in ad
vance of the trial to follow the
court's order in the case, although
it might require extra police to
protect Miss Lucy on her return.
Gov. James E. Folsom has pledg
ed indirect support, saying he
would do "all in my power" to
prevent mob rule at the univer
sity or anywhere else in Alabama.
Judge Grooms said, before read
ing the order, that "there is some
feeling this court should carve out
a province in north Alabama and
should defy the Supreme Court
of the United States."
He said Miss Lucy had been ad
mitted under direction of a Su
preme Court decision. Her par
ticular case has not yet reached
the Supreme Court, but Judge
Grooms apparently was banking
on the high court's sweeping rul
ing against segregated public edu
cation of May 17. 1954.
