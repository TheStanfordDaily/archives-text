## Indians and Tigers Keep Peace This Time; Stanford Takes Fifth Straight in Rugged Tilt 
### 
Stanford's Ruggers, undefeated
again as they downed the Tigers
here yesterday afternoon.
A sparse crowd, «ttending in hi
flamboyant fistic action which v
meeting, had to be surprised when
both squads turned in a game
which featured a lot of straight,
hard rugby.
In the opening 10 minutes of
play,- action was somewhat lethar
gic, with neither team being able
to move the ball very well. Soon
after, however, the visitors from
Stockton got under way, several
times penetrating Cardinal terri
tory—a feat all but impossible for
them in the last encounter be
tween the two clubs at Stockton
about four weeks ago.
Ken Swearingen of the Tigers
booted a penalty kick to climax
this series of thrusts into Indian
land. A big forward, Jack Meeks,
shortly after plowed into pay-dirt,
the try being an anticlimax to a
brilliant 60-yard kick coming from
the COP backfield.
After this flurry Paul Wiggin
dove on a short penalty kick in
Hie end /one to put Stanford on
the scoreboard. Dorsey Atkinson
converted, and the Indians trailed
6-5.
Shortly before the half termi
nated, Scott Jones zigged and zag
ged his way 40 yards downfield
for a try to make the count 8-6 at
intermission.
Second-half action, however
spirited, could not equal the scor
ing done in the initial period. Out
side of Atkinson's 35-yard try and
a few near-misses, the ball stayed
away from the scoring area.

1 in five starts, turned the trick i
of COP, 11-6, in a contest played
opes of again seeing some of the
,vas part of the two teams' last
