# Jones' Batting Leads Braves
## 
### 
Ron Jones drove out three hits
and smashed across five runs as
the Stanford Braves batted and
walked their way to an overwhel
ming 20-6 victory over the Moffett
Field Flyers.
The Braves will meet up with
tougher competition this after
noon when they meet the College
of San Mateo at 3:15.
Moffett Field's pitchers showed
wildness in the early innings as
they walked eight batters and
threw nine wild pitches in the
opening four stanzas while the
Braves racked up all of their runs.
The winning pitcher was soph
omore George Avery, who hurled
three innings of spotless baseball
and then moved to the outfield.
After the move he started hitting
and contributed two base-hits, in
cluding a two-run homer over the
left-field fence on the freshman
diamond.
Wild pitches did most of the
work during the five-run second
inning, though outfielders Gordy
Medaris and Wayne West, along
with Jones, contributed singles.
The biggest inning for Coach
Bill Arce's nine was the third as
11 runs poured across the plate.
Jones' double off the left-field
fence was the big factor in the
scoring splurge, though a majori
ty of the credit goes to eight er
rors by the inexperienced service
men.
