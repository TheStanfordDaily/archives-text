# Dr. Sterling's Appointment Made at Dramatic Meeting
## Board of Trustees Released Choice Just Before Noon on Nov. 19, 1948 
### 
On the morning of Nov. 19, 1948, 11 representatives of newspapers
and press services waited in an outer office of the rooms of the
Stanford Board of Trustees on the 16th floor of the Balfour Building
in San Francisco.
In the Board room grouped around a long table, the Trustees were

taking final action on the appoint
! merit of Stanford's fifth presi
dent. The minutes ticked away.
The reporters on afternoon pa
pers began to fidget as their noon
time deadlines approached.
Trustee Ira Lill i c k came
through the door and asked the
secretary for a copy of the Trus
tees' Manual. He disappeared
again into the green - paneled
room.
Then Trustee Lloyd Dinkelspiel
(now president of the Board)
stuck his head through the door
and summoned Stanford Director
of Information Frederic O. Glover
(now an assistant to the presi
dent». Trustee M. C. Sloss, vice
president of the Board, told Glo
ver, "Dr. Wallace Sterling has
been chosen president of Stanford
University. His appointment will
be effective July 1, 1949."
Campus Gets News
It was 11:55 a.m. The reporters
rushed for telephones. On the
campus, Board President Paul C.
i Edwards received notice of the
final action after casting his own
vote by telephone. He then an
nounced the name of the new
! president at a special meeting of
the faculty. Within minutes The
j Daily was rolling an "extra" from
j its presses.
Thus was reported the selection
of Sterling as the University's
fifth president. He was 42.
The day before the Board had
1 voted formally to offer the posi
tion to Sterling. Edwards tele
phoned him at Pasadena after the
meeting and received his accept
| a nee.
It was nine months to the day
—Feb. 19, 1948 -that the search
for a successor to Donald B. Tres
idder began.
Two Advisory Committees
!
On that day the Board invited
the faculty and alumni to form
advisory committees.
Hundreds of names were sug
gested to the Trustees, directly
and through two advisory com
mittees. The name of Dr. Ster
ling was on lists of both faculty
and alumni groups and his name
survived siftings by Trustees that
brought the list of possible nomi
-1 nees down to six or seven.
Each committee considered
again members of this select
group, then reported back to the
Trustees. The first choice—and,
as it developed, the only choice—
of the Trustees was Sterling.
