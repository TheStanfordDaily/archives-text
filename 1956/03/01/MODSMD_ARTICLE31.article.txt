# President Makes Two Annual Trips To Eastern U.S.
## 
### 
President Sterling will leave in
a few days for a three-week trip
to the East.
Sterling makes two scheduled
trips to the East every year. On
this trip he will visit New York,
Chicago, Washington and Battle
Creek, Mich.
In the fall he attends the annual
conference of the Association of
American Colleges and Universi
ties. Mrs. Sterling accompanies
him on this trip.
The chief executive spends six
weeks a year in the East, a couple
of weeks in the Los Angeles area
and another couple of weeks at
other alumni points in the West.
He spends about 10 weeks of the
34-week University year off cam
pus.
Sterling recognizes the impor
tance of his being on the campus
most of the time, for he once said,
j "The best fertilizer for a farm fs
: the farmer's own footprints."
