### 
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, president of the Board of Trustees, was
asked by The Daily to sum up in one paragraph his feelings toward
Dr. Wallace Sterling as president of Stanford.
Dinkelspiel answered by writing the following:
"In my opinion, one of the greatest attributes which President
Sterling brings to his position is art understanding for and a love of
people. This is reflected not only in his public addresses but in his
everyday contact with students, faculty, trustees and ihe public.
It is, indeed, a rare attribute and priceless to Stanford."
