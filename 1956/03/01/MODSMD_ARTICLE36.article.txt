# Brainier Hall Traditions Date from 1944 Change
## Women's Enrollment Increase Brought Removal Of Men from Dorm to Newly-Opened Village 
### BeV Johnson 
Back in the days when Branner Hall belonged to Stanford men,
Ihe dorm rang with sounds of their activities, informal dances and
smokers. Now Stanford women have replaced these with their own
traditions, not always more subdued.
Branner opened in January, 1924, housing 1.50 Upper Division and

graduate students. Apparently
Branner was originally planned
as one side of a proposed quad
rangle of dormitories with Toyon
! as the central feature.
The 1928 Quad describes Bran
ner and Toyor as "two of the
most modern men's dormitories
of any university in the eoun
} try." There was a long waiting
list every year, with Branner
placing second in preference to
Toyon.
Campus leaders were featured
speakers at smokers planned by
: a special committee. These events
i were designed to "foster a friend
' ly spirit" and aid the men in get
! ting acquainted.
Hating* Clubs
By 1935 many Branner resi
: dents were members of eating
i clubs. Crowded conditions in 1937
| brought about inter-hall informal
I dances with Toyon.
During the early years of World
War 11,- soldier - students were
quartered in Bra n ne r by the
Army. Increased enrollment of
women students in 1944 first
caused it to become a women's
dorm as a temporary measure.
Men took over the dorm again
in the summer of 1946, but the
women suddenly reclaimed it that
autumn. Men students were shut
tled off to the newly opened Vil
lage.
Temporary Basis
Although Branner was turned
! over to the women on a tempo
jrary basis, traditions collected
throughout the past decade have
given their stay a permanent as
!pe c t. Now a freshman dorm,
: Branner has been guided by Ins
! lee Fliekinger, residence director,
since 194(3.
The Branner Banner, first worn
-1 en's dormitory newspaper, made
i its debut in 1949. Pinning and en
j gagement announcements, birth
flay celebrations and singing at
dinner have become one part of
Branner living.
Each year during winter quar
ter residents all join, together to
make their Carnivalâ€”held yester
day- a success. Profits from this
j Carnival increase the fund for a
| scholarship given each year to
1 one or two Branner residents.


BRANNKH HALL, once called one of the "most modern men's
dormitories ot' any university in tin* country," was first taken over
by the women in 1944. Birthday celebrations and an annual carni
val have replaced smokers as dorm traditions.
