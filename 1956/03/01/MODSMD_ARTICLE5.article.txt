# Club Members Hear Talk In ST&T Series
## Brandin Calls Leland Stanford's Land Plan 'A Stroke of Genius' 
### 
"At one time'l thought Leland
Stanford's putting the land on the
Palo Alto Farm into trust was
either a stroke of genius or a
stroke of luck," .said Business
Manager Alf E. Brandin last
night.
Delivering a Stanford Today
and Tomorrow talk before about
40 persons in El Cuadro eating
club, Brandin declared: "Now I
know it was a stroke of genius.
Stanford had the foresight to look
far into the future."
The former Stanford football
star explained that the founder
allowed for any future need of
capital by willing all his lands,
except the University, to be sale
able.
But Stanford reserved the Uni
versity campus for an educational
and cultural place for faculty,
staff and students to live.
According to Brandin, the four
phases in Stanford's development
were: a phase in which develop
ment consisted of raising cattle,
flowers and grains; the topo
graphical phase; the industrial
residential development phase,
and the master-plan phase.
Regarding the first phase Bran
din pointed out, "We are present
ly raising the world's best straw
berries on part of the leasehold
area."
The fourth, or master-plan,
phase calls for development of a
4000-acre campus bounded by Palo
Alto, Menlo Park, Woodside, Ath
erton, El Camino Real and the
Los Altos "spur track."
"At least I always called it the
spur track," said Brandin, "until
I was speaking before the Stan
ford Board of Trustees. I called it
a spur track and Mr. Donald Rus
sell. president of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, said: 'There's
just one thing wrong, Alf. That's
not a spur track; that's a main
line.' "
In another ST&T program last
night at Sigma Alpha Epsilonl
Frederic O. Glover, assistant to
President Wallace Sterling, deliv
ered news for all fraternity men.
"The University is engaging in
a thorough study of the fraternity
housing problem created by a fed
eral tax ruling," said Glover.
At the Phi Kappa Psi house,
Edward H. Brooks, assistant di
rector of admissions, divided his
time between explaining admis
sions policies and land â€¢ develop
ment programs.
