### Stew Toy 
California's genial Attorney-General Edmund G. ("Pat") Brown
last night told a Cubberley Auditorium audience lhat the Democratic
party's inability to win state elections is due mainly to California's
lack of independent and Democratic newspapers.
"The press of California is almost 100 per cent Republican," Brown

said. "And people pay attention
to editorial policies. Day in and
day out the press is the most ef
fective medium for influencing
public opinion."
Other reasons for the Demo
crats' current drought in state
election winners include, he said,
cross-filing and excessive cam
paign costs, accentuated by the
undue length of California cam
paigns.
Brown said California "should
abolish cross • filing" —that "one
campaign is enough," without re
quiring candidates to fight both
their Democratic and Republican
primary opponents and then the
Republicans again in the general
election.
"The primary election date
should be advanced from June to
August," Brown said. "In fact a
plan to do away with direct pri
maries altogether is worth some
study." •
Brown also attacked the Repub
lican state Congressional district
reapportionment of 1950 as "one
of the most dishonest reapportion
ment plans I've ever seen." He
said Republican gerrymandering
has been a large factor in keeping
the Democrats out of power in
California.
Brown, head of the California
Democratic party and state cam
paign manager for Adlai Steven
son, reiterated his faith in Ste
venson and in the Democratic par
ty's candidate whoever he may
be to win next fall's Presidential
election. But lie said if the elec
tion were tomorrow "this might
not happen."
Brown has been mentioned as a
possible Vice - Presidential candi
date under Stevenson. In an in
terview after his speech Blown
said he would "most certainly ac
cept" the Vice-Presidential nomi
nation if it were offered, but that
he had "no anticipation" that it
won Ul be tendered.
