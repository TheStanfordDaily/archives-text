# Opening of All Roads Favored By Traffic Com
## Increase of Facilities For Parking Advocated At LASSU Meeting 
### 
University proposals for block
ing off internal campus roads
were discussed by student traffic
committee chairman Bob Mad
dock before LASSU representa
tives Wednesday night.
Maddock cast a critical eye a'
plans to c'ose a number of roads
on campus in order to achieve the
peripheral traffic system now ad
vocated by the administration.
He made clear the five-student
traffic committee does not share
these ideas, which he felt would
be "darned inconvenient for any
one wanting to drive" on campus.
Instead the group favors use of
all roads, along with enlarged
parking areas.
"We would clear all main
streets of parking," Maddock be
gan, "and increase parking space
available at various lots by 1000
new spaces."
University plans are to close off
Galvez St. below Escondido, Ar
guello at Pine Ave., Lasuen from
the Post Office to Arguello, and
also Serra and Lomita Sts. at
certain points.
Aim is to eliminate traffic haz
ards, noise and congestion in the
immediate campus area, diverting
it to the peripheral system. Also
the desire is to decrease unneces
sary student driving.
Maddock told the LASSU dele
gates that he thought the two
lane peripheral road was "unreal
istic" for handling the peak traf
fic that might be expected.
"It would cause congestion and
unnecessary confusion," he con
tinued, because of left-turn needs,
heavier traffic concentration and
of difficulty involved in getting
"where you want to go."
A motion to have the peripheral
road built before any roads are
closed and suggestions to have a
two-week trial basis were left fnr
continued discussion and exami
nation of the traffic problem.
In other action, LASSU:
• approved new Business
School representative John Mor
gridge.
• received for future considera
tion proposed changes in by-laws
affecting elections, administrative
boards and commissions.
• okayed by-law changes for
the Social Coordinating Board
which add the following stipula
tions: The Board "shall review all
applications for dates that com
pose the over-all social calendar
. . . shall have the power to grant
or deny application for a date by
any group . . . shall review pro
posed plans for all student extra
curricular (all campus) activities
before granting or denying their
application for a date on the so
cial calendar."

streets of parking," Maddock be
gan, "and increase parking space
available at various lots by 1000
new spaces."
University plans are to close off
Galvez St. below Escondido, Ar
guello at Pine Ave., Lasuen from
the Post Office to Arguello, and
also Serra and Lomita Sts. at
certain points.
Aim is to eliminate traffic haz
ards, noise and congestion in the
immediate campus area, diverting
it to the peripheral system. Also
the desire is to decrease unneces
sary student driving.
Maddock told the LASSU dele
gates that he thought the two
lane peripheral road was "unreal
istic" for handling the peak traf
fic that might be expected.
"It would cause congestion and
unnecessary confusion," he con
tinued, because of left-turn needs,
heavier traffic concentration and
of difficulty involved in getting
"where you want to go."
A motion to have the peripheral
road built before any roads are
closed and suggestions to have a
two-week trial basis were left fnr
continued discussion and exami
nation of the traffic problem.
In other action, LASSU:
• approved new Business
School representative John Mor
gridge.
• received for future considera
tion proposed changes in by-laws
affecting elections, administrative
boards and commissions.
• okayed by-law changes for
the Social Coordinating Board
which add the following stipula
tions: The Board "shall review all
applications for dates that com
pose the over-all social calendar
. . . shall have the power to grant
or deny application for a date by
any group . . . shall review pro
posed plans for all student extra
curricular (all campus) activities
before granting or denying their
application for a date on the so
cial calendar."
University proposals for block
ing off internal campus roads
were discussed by student traffic
committee chairman Bob Mad
dock before LASSU representa
tives Wednesday night.
Maddock cast a critical eye a'
plans to c'ose a number of roads
on campus in order to achieve the
peripheral traffic system now ad
vocated by the administration.
He made clear the five-student
traffic committee does not share
these ideas, which he felt would
be "darned inconvenient for any
one wanting to drive" on campus.
Instead the group favors use of
all roads, along with enlarged
parking areas.
"We would clear all main
streets of parking," Maddock be
gan, "and increase parking space
available at various lots by 1000
new spaces."
