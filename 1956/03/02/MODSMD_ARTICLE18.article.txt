# An American Defeat
## 
### 
Autherine Lucy has been expelled from the
I niversity -j{ Alabama.
She was not expelled because she broke some
uii iv ersitv rule or con hi not meet its academic
standards. She was expelled because her skin
is dark, because she had the courage to ask to
receive an education from a school bogged in
its "while superiority" tradition.
A university official said the action was taken
because Miss Lucy made '"loose" charges against
the university.
Any of the charges Miss Lucy made against
the university can hardly be called "loose * by
ar>\ definition of the word. Her charges add up
to what the cast- really is: ihe University of Ala
bama does not want Negroes on its campus.
The ethical problem involved in this issue
lias been worked over and over: no one with
any amount of common decency believes that
anyone should be barred from a school because
of skin coloring.
The liberal thinking, intelligent persons
among us take such reasoning for granted, but

the back-sliding bigot.-, have been so insistent on j
ignoring this truism that the United States Su
preme Court finally had to legally outlaw segre
gation in schools.
But Miss Lucy has been expelled, the bigots i
ha\e won, the American people have been de
feated.
\\ hat are we to tell those abroad?
That the world champion of democracy can
not even practice basic democracy at home?
That the world's greatest legal instrument, the
U.S. Constitution (which is supposed to be the I
method of achieving and keeping that democ
racy), is a failure?
And what are we to tell the children?
That it is not right to go to school with people
whose skin is darker than theirs is?
The University of Alabama has not only
ruined its reputation but it has endangered the
reputation of the United States of America, a
union to which all of us belong, here as well as
in Alabama.
How long can we stand for it?
