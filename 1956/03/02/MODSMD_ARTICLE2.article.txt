## 
### 
Five â€¢ University of Kentucky
students were arrested yesterday
on charges of grand larceny and
illegal possession of barbiturate
drugs.
Two youths not enrolled in
school were charged with living in
university dormitories for some
time without knowledge or con
sent of the school.
About six other students are
under investigation, and at least
two more arrests for selling mari
juana are anticipated, officials
said.
University President H. L. Don
ovan released a report from Dean
of Men Leslie R. Martin which
said activities of the students
since their enrollment last Sep
tember had been connected with
explosions of home - made bombs
in dormitory plumbing fixtures,
31 thefts from campus vending
machines, break-ins of Lexington
storehouses and the sale and dis
tribution of marijuana.
Smashing of the campus gang
camp after investigation by a Fed
eral narcotics agent who posed as
a student and moved in as a room
mate of one of the gang members.
Dean Martin's report said the
students enrolled "with the full in
tent of carrying out a series of
crimes in an organized way, and
they boasted to the agent they
wanted to become 'educated to be
come big-time gangsters'."
They said they decided to en
roll at the university because they
thought as students they would
not be suspected of "big crimes."
The report said the suspects
first came to the attention of uni
versity anrl local authorities last
January when their names kept
coming up in the investigation of
bombs exploded in dormitory
commodes, although no concrete
evidence was found.
