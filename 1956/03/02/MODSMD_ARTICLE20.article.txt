LASSU Takes a Stand
Editor, The Daily:
We feel that the issues involved in the invalida
tion of the constitutional amendment regarding
the election of head ciieer leader were not made
clear to the students in Thursday's issue of The
Daily. Perhaps the following points will clarify
tlie Legislature's action:
1. The members of the Legislature cannot pick
from among the rules those which they wish to
follow. They can only assume that, until the stu
dents change Constitution, they are elected to
carry out its injunctions.
2. The ASSU Constitution provides that all pro
posed constitutional amendments "together with
the parts affected thereby, shall be published in
'I he Stanford Daily on at least two separate days
during the week prior to election day." The above
requirements were not fulfilled, even though the
information provided The Daily in sufficient
time for publication,
3. Several Legislature members mentioned at
the meeting, with the Daily reporter in attend
ance, that many students had complained that
they had not. understood the issue on which they
were voting.
4. Invalidation of the constitutional amend
ment does not necessarily mean that the candi
dates for head cheer leader this year must go
through the screening committee. Direct election
for this year can be provided for by action of the
Legislature in the form of a by-law change. If the
students wish to make the change permanent, the
amendment to the Constitution can again be re
ferred to them in the spring election.

Editor's Note:
ASSU Legislature members were elected to
carry out the wishes of the student body (one
of these wishes was the constitutional change
which Legislature invalidated despite a major
ity desire for the change).
They were not elected to carry out the in
junctions of the Constitution, except in so far
as its provisions can be liberally interpreted to
implement putting legitimate student requests
into action.
The Daily published articles concerning the
amendment on Friday of the week before the
referendum vote and one each on Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday of the week of voting.
Sufficient information was not provided The
Daily by the officer in charge of such material;
he was vague aliout the requirements and seem
ingly wanted The Daily to "flub up," as he de
scribed it.
Only ONE Legislature member mentioned at
the meeting (not "several" as the letter
charges) that "many" students had complained
ih.it they had not understood the issue.
This one member said that only ONE student
had mentioned the fact to him.
However, we do not doubt that confusion on
.he NSA referendum did exist. The negative
wording of the proposal was comnletely un
called for, legal advice notwithstanding, unless
withdrawal of NSA from campus was wanted.
It seems more than coincidence that two of

the leading: members of student government,
who helped draw up the resolution, were vio
lently opposed to NSA.
In sum: The Daily did the best possible job
of listing the proposed changes and trying to
clarify confusion, which existed among the leg
islators themselves.
The Daily specifically noted that a "No" vote
on the ballot would keep NSA on campus, and
a "Yes" vote provide for disaffiliation.
In the cheer leader change we explained that
a "Yes" vote would provide for the cheer leader
to be nominated directly, a "No" vote would
continue the process of having him first go
through a screening board.
It could not have been made any clearer.
Perhaps the confusion exists among Legis
lature officials, who did not see lit to word their
ballots in such a manner.
The NSA question on the ballot was com
pletely confused and the cheer leader question
did not even mention that officer.
Would publishing long columns of type with
the exact legal wording from the ASSU Con
stitution help clarify anything?
Of course it would not (except perhaps to a
minority of students —those in law).
It would have just been a waste of type and
would have necessitated leaving out news of
interest to a majority of our readers.
If, however, when we requested a ruling, it
had been given, we would have complied and
then worked to throw out a rule such as this
which is not to the benefit of most students.
We are in business for the majority of stu
dents, not for a small clique of "legalists" who
insist that a verbose constitution supersede the
will of the majority.
The Daily does not mind playing the "whip
ping boy" for a small group of would-be con
gressmen, for we know the majority of our
readers are behind us.
lint we do resent it when this small group
takes recourse in petty action and subverts the
will of the majority.
Parody in Prose
Editor, The Daily:
Once again the God of democratic process has
used its seemingly magical powers to thwart the
will of a majority of a segment of the U.S. popu
lation.
Again the United States Supreme Court has
subverted the will of its Southern constituents to
a bundle of printed paper—called the United
States Constitution.
In the past month's riots more than 987 stu
dents saw fit to cast their stones approving a
change in the personnel at the University of Ala
bama (fewer than 162 students voted no on this
issue).
But now, the 987 have cast their stones in vain,
because no one can carve out a province in north
Alabama to defy the Supreme Court.
In the words of a Governor, "I will do all in
my power to prevent mob rule at the university
or anywhere else in Alabama."
If the will of a frenzied majority is mob rule
then we plead guilty and are proud of it.
But we will say it again: the wheels of govern
ment move slowly, sometimes they also move
backward.
Honesty is a mustard-cup.
