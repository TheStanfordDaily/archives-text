### Frank Huntress 
Last Tuesday and Wednesday Stanford stu
dents went to tlie polls and \to disaffiliate
with the National Student Association. Th< \
also agreed to amend the c heer leader section
hv an overwhelming majority.
But Wednesday night at Legislature meeting
the student representatives voided the students'
will. 1 hey declared the cheer leader amend*
ment invalid.
Why? Bee anse some of the lawmakers did
not believe Ihe Daily had given enough pub
licity to the wording of the amendment.

Fuesday of this week, The Daily ran lengthy
articles on the front page giving direct quotes -
ami the pros and cons ol the Iwo election sub

642 to 563. Ihe cheer leader amendment re
sulted in ama jority of 825—987 for the amend
ment and 162 against. A total of 1218 students
voted.
It's up to LASSU now. It is their decision
as to whether a new election shall be called
for the amendment or that at least a tempo
rary by-law will be passed until an election is

called.
Hut the students are entitled to another elec-
I ion.
