## Pamphlet Tells Social Effects of Conviction For Buying, Drinking Alcoholic Beverages 
### 
"Stanford Students and the Liq
uor Laws," the booklet prepared
by the Fundamental Standard
Commission, may be picked up
at the ASSU office by students
who did not get copies at resi
dence meetings this week.
The booklet points out both the
laws on purchasing and/or drink
ing liquor and discusses usual lo
cal interpretation of these laws,
ft also discusses the social effects
of conviction for an alcoholic of
fense.
fn California it is a misdemea
nor for a minor to:
• Purchase any alcoholic bev
erage.
• Consume any alcoholic bever
age in any on-sale premises.
• Possess any alcoholic bever

age on any street, highway or any
public place.
• Present any written evidence
of age which is false, fraudulent
or not actually his own in order
to obtain an alcoholic beverage.
Mere possession of a false draft
card or any other government
document is a Federal offense,
punishable by up to a $10,000 fine
and/or five years' imprisonment.
Possession of a false driver's li
cense is a misdemeanor.
It is also a misdemeanor for
any person to sell, furnish, give
or cause to be sold, furnished or
given away any alcoholic bever
age to a minor.
A minor is not prohibited by
law from entering premises where
liquor is sold, but the manage
ment may pr ohibit it as a protec
tive measure.
Drunk Driving
The booklet also discusses
drunk driving. Driving under the
influence of alcohol is a misde
meanor, and the usual penalty in
Palo Alto for first-offenders has
been a fine of about $300, with a
suspended jail sentence.
It is also a misdemeanor to be
drunk in an automobile, although
local law enforcement agents usu
ally encourage a sober driver to
drive drunks home.
Alcohol from the University
viewpoint is also a problem. The
Alcoholic Beverage Control
(ABC> has been turning coopera
tive first - offenders over to the
University for disciplining.
Cooperation
Cooperation involves no vio
lence, giving proper and truthful
identification, and assistance in
identifying any licensees who sold
liquor to Ihe student. On this
basis, the student will not acquire
a criminal record for a liquor law
violation.
In order that state laws be up
held, liquor is banned on campus.
At parties where free liquor is
being dispensed, il is not against
l ho law for minors to be present,
although they are breaking the
law if they imbibe. The booklet
points out that disturbing the
peace is what causes most private
parties to be raided by the police.
People providing liquor to mi
nors at parties at privately owned
locations are guilty of breaking
the law.
Criminal Record
Discussing the effects of a crim
inal record in later life, the book
let says a record can be a serious
detriment.
Doubt as to a student's charac
ter may cost him a job or an ap
pointment. Most companies now
inquire as to previous crimes,
other than minor traffic viola
tions. Professional societies and
licensing agencies consider more
than just technical qualifications.
A criminal record may disqualify
an applicant.
Criminal record raises a rea
sonable doubt as to a person's
character. Any reasonable doubt
must be removed by an applicant
before he can practice law in Cali
fornia.
