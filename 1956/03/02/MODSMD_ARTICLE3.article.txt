Politicians on both sides of the
country are scrambling to keep
up with President Eisenhower's
announcement that he will seek a
second term.
In the West, Senate Republican
Leader William F. Knowland for
mally withdrew his name from
the GOP Presidential sweep
stakes.
Throwing his full weight be
hind the President, Knowland an
nounced he would join California
Governor Goodwin J. Knight and
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon
in sponsoring a slate of California
convention delegates pledged to
Mr. Eisenhower.
Vice-President Nixon also came
into the spotlight with Eisen
hower's announcement, since the
President stated that he would
leave the selection of a Vice-Presi
dential candidate up to the Na
tional Convention.
Nixon critics interpreted this as
a repudiation of the former Cali
fornia Senator, while others read
it as a solid endorsement of the
President's 1!)."52 running mate.
Although the cities pointed to
Eisenhower's repudiation of some
remarks Nixon made alluding to
United States Chief Justice Earl
Warren as a "Republican Chief
Justice" as censure of the Vice-
President, Eisenhower in his
statement emphatically praised
Nixon, although he refused to
commit himself on the choice of a
running mate.
Former New York Governor
Thomas E. Dewey was mentioned
as a substitute if Nixon's is
crossed off the list of candidates.
New York sources said the for
mer GOP Presidential candidate
would probably accept.
