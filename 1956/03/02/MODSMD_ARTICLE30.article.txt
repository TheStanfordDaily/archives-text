## Cowley Thinks New Writers Surpass 'Lost Generation' 
### Stew Toy 
Although Malcolm Cowley is
doubtless one of the finest critics
and loudest exponents of Ameri
can writers of the 1920'5, he
thinks modern writers have the
edge over their Roaring Era coun
terparts.
Cowley, well-known a u th or,
critic, editor and poet, is a visit
ing professor in the English De
partment this quarter.
He sees the difference between
modern writing and that of the
'2(J's as one of technique and tra
dition. "Now." he said, "writers
have more technical facility. And
there is more tradition in writing,
since most of that technical facili
ty is learned.
"Contemporary writers are less
experimental and more tradition
al. even when they don't think
they're traditional."
But he said "this might lead to
my saying thai the writing of the
'20's was better. I don't think it
was."
Cowley was born in Belsano,
Pa., in 1898. He received the A.B.
degree at Harvard in 1920, after
which he studied at the Univer
sity of Montpelier, France, for
two years on a fellowship.
Cowley, in line with the spirit
of the time, enlisted in the French
Army during the "theatrioal per
formance" in World War I.
He, like Hemingway. Fitzgerald
and other young writers, applied
for the ambulance corps. But he
was put in the "camion corps" of
truck drivers.
"We got: paid 5 cents, 4 pounds
of tobacco and a bottle of wine a
day. We were glad for that."
Cowley is perhaps best known
for his work on the New Repub
lic magazine, for which he was
associate editor from 1929 to 1944. |
He has also been on the edi
torial boards of many other pub
lications. At present the only edi
torial post he holds is as an edit or
of the Sherman Sentinel, bi-week
ly mimeographed newspaper of
his home town, Sherman, Conn.
He was recently elected succes
sor to playwright Marc Connelly
as president of the National Insti

tute of Arts and Letters.
At Stanford Cowiey is replacing
English professor- Wallace Steg
ner, on leave of absence. He is
teaching c o urse s in advanced
writing and criticism of fiction.
He thinks Stanford sludents are
a "bright and attractive crowd"
and that Stanford's main assets
are its faculty and student body.
"The weakness of Stanford," he
said, "is the Library—and please
quote me on that! Of course, it's
not the fault of the librarians.
There just aren't enough books."
Cowley is author of a book—
"Exiles Return"—and many arti
cles on Ihe "Lost Generation"
writers. His latest book is "The
Literary Situation."
When he leaves Stanford at the
end of this quarter, Cowley plans
to revise some of his poetry and
publish it in a collection.
But he has no time for writing
while at Stanford.
"I'm willing to give teaching
my whole time."

MALCOLM COW LEY

Although Malcolm Cowley is
doubtless one of the finest critics
and loudest exponents of Ameri
can writers of the 1920'5, he
thinks modern writers have the
edge over their Roaring Era coun
terparts.
Cowley, well-known a u th or,
critic, editor and poet, is a visit
ing professor in the English De
partment this quarter.
He sees the difference between
modern writing and that of the
'2(J's as one of technique and tra
dition. "Now." he said, "writers
have more technical facility. And
there is more tradition in writing,
since most of that technical facili
ty is learned.
"Contemporary writers are less
experimental and more tradition
al. even when they don't think
they're traditional."
But he said "this might lead to
my saying thai the writing of the
'20's was better. I don't think it
was."
Cowley was born in Belsano,
Pa., in 1898. He received the A.B.
degree at Harvard in 1920, after
which he studied at the Univer
sity of Montpelier, France, for
two years on a fellowship.
Cowley, in line with the spirit
of the time, enlisted in the French
Army during the "theatrioal per
formance" in World War I.
He, like Hemingway. Fitzgerald
and other young writers, applied
for the ambulance corps. But he
was put in the "camion corps" of
truck drivers.
"We got: paid 5 cents, 4 pounds
of tobacco and a bottle of wine a
day. We were glad for that."
Cowley is perhaps best known
for his work on the New Repub
lic magazine, for which he was
associate editor from 1929 to 1944. |
He has also been on the edi
torial boards of many other pub
lications. At present the only edi
torial post he holds is as an edit or
of the Sherman Sentinel, bi-week
ly mimeographed newspaper of
his home town, Sherman, Conn.
He was recently elected succes
sor to playwright Marc Connelly
as president of the National Insti

tute of Arts and Letters.
At Stanford Cowiey is replacing
English professor- Wallace Steg
ner, on leave of absence. He is
teaching c o urse s in advanced
writing and criticism of fiction.
He thinks Stanford sludents are
a "bright and attractive crowd"
and that Stanford's main assets
are its faculty and student body.
"The weakness of Stanford," he
said, "is the Library—and please
quote me on that! Of course, it's
not the fault of the librarians.
There just aren't enough books."
Cowley is author of a book—
"Exiles Return"—and many arti
cles on Ihe "Lost Generation"
writers. His latest book is "The
Literary Situation."
When he leaves Stanford at the
end of this quarter, Cowley plans
to revise some of his poetry and
publish it in a collection.
But he has no time for writing
while at Stanford.
