# Tribe Cagers Take On San Jose State Quintet
## Spartans Finish Basketball Season Here Tomorrow John Erceg Leads State Against Tribe 
### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
San Jose State, third-place team
in the now nationally famous Cal
ifornia Basketball Association,
ends its season tomorrow night in
the Stanford Pavilion against the
Stanford Indians at 8 p.m.
The Spartans dropped a 70-60
contest to St. Mary's Tuesday eve
ning to finish behind the Gaels
and the nation's No. 1 team, San
Francisco, in CBA play.
During Ihe entire season the
Spartans have run up a 16-9 rec
ord while ending the ("HA year
with an 8-6 mark.
San Jose, coached by veteran
Walt MePherson, boasts a well
balanced first team. The Spartan
starters will average slightly tall
er than the Cards 6-2 to slightly
over 6 feet.
Forward John Ereeg is State's
chief scoring threat. Erceg is a
6-2 senior from Oakland.
Erceg's running mate is 6-4 Bob
Borghesani, a junior college
transfer. Borghesani averaged 20
points a game for East Contra
Costa JC before coming to San
Jose. The husky junior can switch
to center whenever necessary.
Bear Brother
San Jose's sharpest young eag
er is sophomore guard Eddie Diaz,
brother of California's Mike. Diaz
stands 5-11 and boasts a variety
of shots.
Diaz shattered all of State's
freshman scoring records last
year when he averaged 23.3 points
a contest. The little guard is rated
as the Spartans' outstanding play
maker.
Tom Crane, a steady senior,
will open at the other guard spot.
The veteran 6-footer is one of the
Spartans' most accurate shots and
best defensive players.
Toss-Up
The center position is a wide
open contest at San Jose: Marv
Branstrom, a 6-7 sophomore, and
veteran 6-4 senior Fred Niemann.
Borghesani can also play the post
when necessary.
Branstrom is a Turlock product
but played junior college ball in
Chicago last year. The tall young
ster was named to the Chicago
College All-Star team as he aver
aged 20 points a game and looked
very good on defense.
Niemann, 24, served 14 months
in the Army after starting at cen
ter for the Spartans in 1953. The
husky senior hails from Pied
mont. He was an all-conference
hoopster while playing at San
Francisco City College in 1952.
Card Thorn
Another Spartan eager who
could be a thorn in Stanford's side
is junior forward Ray Goodwin.
The 6-2 speedster is recovering
from an injury which has kept
him out of action for several
weeks. An excellent rebounder,
Goodwin can high-jump 6-5.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
is expected to start the regular
quintet of Bill Flanders and Bill
Bond at forward, Barry Brown at
center, and George Selieck and
Hap Wagner at guard. »
Last year Stanford rolled to an
80-69 victory over San Jose behind
the sharp shooting of Ron Tomsic.
The Cards close out their sea
son with two games against Cal
next weekend. They still have a
mathematical chance for a tie for
second place, although it is only
a slim possibility.
If the Cards win, they will
clinch the Santa Clara county
championship, having whipped
Santa Clara previously.
