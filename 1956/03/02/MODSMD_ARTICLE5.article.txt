# Stanford Professors Expected Ike Would Seek Second Term
## Mixed Reaction Greets President's Decision; Long Uphill Battle Predicted for Democrats 
### 
Eisenhower's decision to run for a second term was no surprise to
Stanford Professors Arnaud B. Leavelle, Robert Holm, Donald Fehr
enbacher and Thomas A. Bailey.
"It was perfectly obvious what he was doing in Georgia," said Dr.
Leavelle, political science professor. "He was operating under the

assumption that any man who"
could shoot 18 holes of golf in a
day could carry the burdens of
the presidency."
Dr. Robert Horn, professor of
political science and Constitution
al law expert, said, "I'll repeat
Teddy Roosevelt's words. 'I'm
dee-lighted' and I think he can
win."
Donald Fehrenbacher, assistant
professor of history, noted that if
Eisenhower wins, he and Ulysses
S. Grant will be the only two Re
publican Presidents to serve two
consecutive terms.
Oddly enough, Eisenhower and
Grant have been the only two
Presidents to graduate from West
Point. Fehrenbacher said that Ei
senhower is an extremely hard
man to heat because of his tre
mendous popularity. "It will be a
long uphill pull for the Demo
crats," he said.
History Professor Thomas A.
Bailey predicts Eisenhower will
do even belter in this election than
he fliri in 1952. Bailey feels Ike
will do even better in the "solid
South."
"Ike will win in a landslide,"
says Bailey. "The only way the
Democrats can win this election is
for Eisenhower to die during the
campaign."
Dr. Leave lie also commented on
the Vice-Presidency, saying, "Nix
on is on his way out. The ['resi
dent showed this when he refused
to take a stand on Nixon in his de
cision this morning."
Leavelle picked Gove rti or
Knight of California and Gover
nor Herter of Massachusetts as
favorites to replace Nixon on the
GOP ticket.
