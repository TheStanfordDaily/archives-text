# University of Alabama Ousts Negro Student Permanently' Despite Federal Court Order
## Trustees Say Autherine Lucy Made 'Baseless... Outrageous' Accusations 
### 
BIRMINGHAM. Ala., March 1 (U.R) The University of Alabama
expelled Negro coed Autherine Lucy today.
No formal announcement was made by the university, but it was
learned that Miss Lucy was expelled because of the charges she made
against university officials in connection with her federal court action

seeking readmission.
Jeff Bennett, assistant to Presi
dent O. C. Carmichael of the uni
versity, said Miss Lucy was ex
pelled because of "loose" charges
against school officials.
John A. Cadell, secretary of the
trustees, said Miss Lucy hud at
tacked "the integrity of the Uni
versity of Alabama and of per
sons responsible for its manage
ment.
He cited charges by Miss Lucy,
contained in a contempt action
filed after she was suspended Feb.
6, that the university connived
with rioters to drive Miss Lucy
from the campus so she could be
barred from further classes on
grounds of safety.
These charges, however, were
withdrawn before Judge Hobart
Grooms ordered the suspension
lifted.
Cadell told a news conference
that Miss Lucy's attorneys thus
"admitted in court" they had no
evidence to back up the conspir
acy allegation. Testimony ai the
hearing, "including thai of Au
thcrine herself, proved its falsity,
Cadell added.
The university's action was
taken at a secret meeting of the
Board of Trustees last night.
It occurred only a few hours
after Federal Judge Hobart
Grooms ordered her readmitted to
the university by 9 a.m. The pre
diction was made publicly in
Judge Grooms' court thai Miss
Lucy might be killed by a mob if
she returned.
The Board of Trustees issued a
brief statement, saying in part:
"It is the sense of this board
that no educational institution
could possibly maintain any sem
blance of discipline if any stu
dents—whether they be black or
white—guilty of the conduct of
Autherine Lucy, be permitted to
remain a member of the student
body after making such baseless,
outrageous and unfounded
charges."
Therefore, it concluded, the Ne
gro coed "is permanently ex
pelled."
Previous to the expulsion an
nouncement, Secretary John Ca
dell had said flatly that if Miss
Lucy had returned to the campus
"she probably will be killed."
Judge Grooms had intended to
rule tomorrow on Miss Lucy's
suit for full rights to the women's
dormitory and the campus dining
facilities.
It was indicated that the next
step in the legal battle would be
announced by Thurgood Marshall,
who is special counsel of the
NAACP.
