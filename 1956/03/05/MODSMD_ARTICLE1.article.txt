# Chivalry Blossoms-Wilbur Gives Brainier a Driveway
## Junipero II Men Reopen Closed Driveway After Administration, LASSU Fail to Art 
### Dave Scott Photos by Jack Churchill 
Junipero II look things into their own hands Saturday and did
what University officials refused fo do. They gave Branner Hall a
second driveway.
When the University was constructing curbs on both sides of Es
condido Avenue last summer as a part of the Wilbur construction

-job, they somehow forgot that
circular driveway in front of
Branner Hall and closed off one
of the exits with af high, solid
cement curb.
Naturally Branner women were
highly perturbed. They went to
various University offices in an
effort to find out who had made
the- mistake. Nobody could tell
them. And they were told by both
I ho University and ASSU Legisla
ture that nothing could be done
about it in the near future.
"A Real Hazard"
In the meantime the driveway
was a real problem. As one Bra li
ner resident said: "It was a real
hazard. People were backing out
of the one exit and some serious
accidents almost developed. Be
side that, it was very inconven
ient."
Consequently, Lyle Sacks and
Steve Johnson from Junipero Ii
wing of Wilbur decided that the
nonsense had gone far enough,
and that if you wanted to get
something done, you had to do it
yourself.
At 1 p.m. Saturday the whole
wing showed up in front of Bran
ner with a trailer full of dry as-'
phalt mix. Spurred on by yells of
encouragement from Branner
women from 1he second floor bal
cony, the Wilbur men began their
task.
"Thanks Wilbur"
They made an inclined drive
way from the edge of the curbing.
Then, to the accompaniment of
great cheers, two of the Wilbur
men drove the first car over the
new driveway.
Within minutes three Branner
women had driven their 1 cars over
the new. exit. A sign was hung
over the balcony saying "Thanks
Wilbur."
Said one Junipero man: "Gosh,
that was fun. We ought to do
things like that more often."
According to wing sponsor Walt
Hays, it was not thought the Uni
versity would do anything about
the construction job.

of the one exit and some serious
accidents almost developed. Be
side that, it was very inconven
ient."
Consequently, Lyle Sacks and
Steve Johnson from Junipero Ii
wing of Wilbur decided that the
nonsense had gone far enough,
and that if you wanted to get
something done, you had to do it
yourself.
At 1 p.m. Saturday the whole
wing showed up in front of Bran
ner with a trailer full of dry as-'
phalt mix. Spurred on by yells of
encouragement from Branner
women from 1he second floor bal
cony, the Wilbur men began their
task.
"Thanks Wilbur"
They made an inclined drive
way from the edge of the curbing.
Then, to the accompaniment of
great cheers, two of the Wilbur
men drove the first car over the
new driveway.
Within minutes three Branner
women had driven their 1 cars over
the new. exit. A sign was hung
over the balcony saying "Thanks
Wilbur."
Said one Junipero man: "Gosh,
that was fun. We ought to do
things like that more often."
According to wing sponsor Walt
Hays, it was not thought the Uni
versity would do anything about
the construction job.

The fair maids of Branne • (five out with the thanks
Junipero II look things into their own hands Saturday and did
what University officials refused fo do. They gave Branner Hall a
second driveway.
When the University was constructing curbs on both sides of Es
condido Avenue last summer as a part of the Wilbur construction

-job, they somehow forgot that
circular driveway in front of
Branner Hall and closed off one
of the exits with af high, solid
cement curb.
Naturally Branner women were
highly perturbed. They went to
various University offices in an
effort to find out who had made
the- mistake. Nobody could tell
them. And they were told by both
I ho University and ASSU Legisla
ture that nothing could be done
about it in the near future.
"A Real Hazard"
In the meantime the driveway
was a real problem. As one Bra li
ner resident said: "It was a real
hazard. People were backing out
of the one exit and some serious
accidents almost developed. Be
side that, it was very inconven
ient."
Consequently, Lyle Sacks and
Steve Johnson from Junipero Ii
wing of Wilbur decided that the
