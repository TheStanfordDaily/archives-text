# This Week on Quad

### JIM PALMER 
RECIPE FOR THIS week on Quad: take one
part sedimentary rocks, throw in a couple ol
bedbugs, season liberally with Herbert. Hoover
wit, stir in a pacifistic viewpoint, slice a Golden
\pple in three sections and mix well with a
ih ied basketball net.
II indigestion follows, that's taken care of too.
Dead week comes roaring in after a Sunday
flick a bromide for the social glutton.
