IF YOU'RE STILL with us by Saturday af
ternoon. the basketball season gives its gasp
in the Pavilion at 2 when captain George
(Mighty Mouse) Selleck leads the Indians
against a motley Golden Bear outfit. It's on TV.
And if you can't hack basketball, take a turn
out at the diamond where the Flying Dutch
Fehring men go against Santa Clara at 2:30.
Other games this week match the baseballers
with S.F. State (tomorrow) and Cal Aggies
(Friday).
If that's not enoiigh for sporters, take a look
at the rugby match between the Injuns and
Bears in the Stadium or the trackmen on Angell
Field in a triangular event, both Saturday.

FLICK FANS will be treated to "The High
and the Mighty" in Cinemaslop Sunday night,
with John Wayne and Claire Trevor flying
around without any gas. They wouldn't make
it down Palm Drive, that's for sure.

VACATION SPOT: And as the quarter
comes to an end (and since this is the last
week of Daily publication until spring) here is
a suggestion for that interesting place to visit
on vacation.
See (lushing, Oklahomaâ€”"the point of great
est concentration of oil pipe lines in the na
