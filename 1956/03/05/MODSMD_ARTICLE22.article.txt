*! ra no iac Exhl hi t i on"
Editor, The Daily:
Before we begin, may we say that we are aware
that everything we say will be categorically de
nied in b'old-faced type.
We wish to compliment you on your recent
paranoiac exhibition the front, page editorial of
March 1, 1956, regarding the recent election.
The ASSU Constitution states in Article IX,
Section 3, Notices: "The proposed amendment,
together with the parts affected thereby, shall be
published in The Stanford Daily on at least two
separate day* r*ur : T» the week prior to election
day. You a( ' an article on the same page,
and we quote: Articles appeaed in The Daily on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week
quoting verbatim the present constitutional pro
v ; ons and defining the proposed change.
"The article Friday outlined briefly the provi
ions and change proposals." By your own ad
mission you were in error. Whether this was a
simple oversight or plain irresponsibility is be
ide the point. You were wrong.
In your editorial you state that "each ballot
had the exact provisions printed on it." We sin
cerely hope that this was the case. The point in
question is whether or not you fulfilled your re
sponsibilities under the ASSU Constitution. By
y ur own admission you did not, and, as this is a
necessary criterion for the legal adoption of an
amendment to the ASSU Constitution, the Legis
lature was completely justified in invalidating
the election.
Many people spent great numbers of hours
drawing up the Constitution. The students went
> the polls and adopted it. It may have things
wrong with it, but you, like the r£st of us, have
to live with it.
The last statement in your editorial—"Revenge
is a reverse gear"—confirms our rather snap

psychoanalysis. Do you really feel someone is out
for revenge? The constitutional provisions for
the passing of an amendment were not met, so
the election was invalidated.
People are always writing letters of complaint
and we are afraid this is one also. But if the edi
torial board could rid itself of its delusions of
persecution and grandeur, which are most pro
foundly exhibited in the aforementioned editorial,
people might not write so many letters in this
vein.
You "flubbed." Now let's see you stand up like
men and admit it instead of stomping your feet
like three-year-olds and screaming NO! NO! NO!
Hoping for a more mature attitude on the part
of the staff, we are yours truly,
Gerald L. Johnson
Richard VV. Samson
.John Edmonds
Editor's Note: Pardon our bold face, but . . .
We did admit to beinjr in error as far as living
up to the fine print in the Constitution, but not
in explaining a completely confusing situation to
our readers —confusion which was caused not by
us but by legislators who gave us no official
ruling, when asked, on what we were "legally"
expected to print.
The majority of our readers did not go to the
jk)lls and adopt the ASSU Constitution; only 25
Iter cent of the student body voted in the referen
dum last spring and 80 per cent of those voting
1352) approved it.
Frankly, the majority of the people for whom
we print The Daily just do not care. We don't
either, except when the Constitution Is used un
fairly as a means of revenge and to thwart ma
jority will.
We repeat: "NO! NO! NO!"
Of course we may be wrong, so we've made an
appointment with our psychoanalyst.

Editor, The Daily:
Before we begin, may we say that we are aware
that everything we say will be categorically de
nied in b'old-faced type.
We wish to compliment you on your recent
paranoiac exhibition the front, page editorial of
March 1, 1956, regarding the recent election.
The ASSU Constitution states in Article IX,
Section 3, Notices: "The proposed amendment,
together with the parts affected thereby, shall be
published in The Stanford Daily on at least two
separate day* r*ur : T» the week prior to election
day. You a( ' an article on the same page,
and we quote: Articles appeaed in The Daily on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week
quoting verbatim the present constitutional pro
v ; ons and defining the proposed change.
"The article Friday outlined briefly the provi
ions and change proposals." By your own ad
mission you were in error. Whether this was a
simple oversight or plain irresponsibility is be
ide the point. You were wrong.
In your editorial you state that "each ballot
had the exact provisions printed on it." We sin
cerely hope that this was the case. The point in
question is whether or not you fulfilled your re
sponsibilities under the ASSU Constitution. By
y ur own admission you did not, and, as this is a
necessary criterion for the legal adoption of an
amendment to the ASSU Constitution, the Legis
lature was completely justified in invalidating
the election.
Many people spent great numbers of hours
drawing up the Constitution. The students went
> the polls and adopted it. It may have things
wrong with it, but you, like the r£st of us, have
to live with it.
The last statement in your editorial—"Revenge
is a reverse gear"—confirms our rather snap

psychoanalysis. Do you really feel someone is out
for revenge? The constitutional provisions for
the passing of an amendment were not met, so
the election was invalidated.
People are always writing letters of complaint
and we are afraid this is one also. But if the edi
torial board could rid itself of its delusions of
persecution and grandeur, which are most pro
foundly exhibited in the aforementioned editorial,
people might not write so many letters in this
vein.
You "flubbed." Now let's see you stand up like
men and admit it instead of stomping your feet
like three-year-olds and screaming NO! NO! NO!
Hoping for a more mature attitude on the part
of the staff, we are yours truly,
Gerald L. Johnson
Richard VV. Samson
.John Edmonds
Editor's Note: Pardon our bold face, but . . .
We did admit to beinjr in error as far as living
up to the fine print in the Constitution, but not
in explaining a completely confusing situation to
our readers —confusion which was caused not by
us but by legislators who gave us no official
ruling, when asked, on what we were "legally"
expected to print.
The majority of our readers did not go to the
jk)lls and adopt the ASSU Constitution; only 25
Iter cent of the student body voted in the referen
dum last spring and 80 per cent of those voting
1352) approved it.
Frankly, the majority of the people for whom
we print The Daily just do not care. We don't
either, except when the Constitution Is used un
fairly as a means of revenge and to thwart ma
jority will.
We repeat: "NO! NO! NO!"
Of course we may be wrong, so we've made an
appointment with our psychoanalyst.
