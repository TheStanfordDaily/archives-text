# 'Man with the Golden Arm' Is Obsessed with Morbid Theme
## Depressing Movie Notable Chiefly Because Drug Theme Defies Censorship Regulations 
### Richard Mende 
It is fairly evident that "The Man with the Golden Arm," now at
the Stanfo 4 tl, is notable chiefly because it deals with drug addiction
in defiance of censorship regulations.
As entertainment it is not past the mark of most of the movies
shown on the Peninsula in the past several months.

Pictures dealing with alcohol--
isin or drug addiction have the al
most insurmountable task of fo
cusing upon tlie human element
in a background which is morbid
and bizarre. In "The Man with the
Golden Arm" only the twisted
and warped surfaces of the dis
eased environment and its inhabi
tants — dope addicts, alcoholics,
bar-flies, petty thieves — are re
corded; there is little penetration
into the more meaningful human
elements of the surroundings.
Animal Reaction
It Is never made clear in the
movie whether Frankie Machine
(Frank Sinatra) is unavoidably
driven, because of his former ha
bituation, into drug addiction. If
this was intended, then we wit
ness in the successive doses the
bizarre and pitiable operation of
a drug; it is purely an animal re
action against which there can be
no real struggle.
If we were to understand that
the effects of Frank Machine's
sordid environment, his neurotic
wife and former gambling asso
ciates drove him back to the hab
it, then the motivation is entirely
unconvincing. Taking the crucial
first shot was implausible, since
a new life was in the offing in a
few days.
Unconvincing
The happy Hollywood ending
tacked on further makes the mov
ie unconvincing and spoils any
truth or force the picture might
have had.
This kind of production tends
toward being depressing. As in
much modern drama, there is not
so much a struggle for man to
control his own destiny as for an
individual to become a whole
man. The result is often pathetic
but never forceful.
Frank Sinatra did some com
mendable acting throughout and
some amazing rolling around on
the floor while taking "the cold
turkey."
