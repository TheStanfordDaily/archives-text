# Young engineers making news at Western Electric
## 
### 
Electric's primary job—which
goes 'way hack to 1882—is to make good
telephone equipment that helps Bell
telephone companies provide good
service. It's a very big job—and a very
important one—which calls for the
pooling of varied types of engineering
skills.
New manufacturing processes and
methods are constantly required to
produce better telephones, better cen
tral office equipment, better wires and
cables, new types of electronic equip
ment to keep pace with the nation's
ever-growing need for more and better
telephone service at low cost.
In addition to doing our job as man
ufacturing unit of the Bell Telephone
System, Western Electric is busy pro
ducing many types of electronic equip
ment for the Armed Forces. Here again,
young engineers of varied training are
doing important work in connection
with the manufacture of radar fire con
trol systems, guided missile systems
and special military communications
systems.


Richard C. Shafer, B.S. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh,
was one of 16 engineers assigned to one of Western Electric's
toughest posf-war projects — developing manufacturing tech
niques for mass-producing (with greot precision!) the tiny but
amazing transistors which are already causing a revolution in
electronics.


Paul J. Gebhard, B.S. M.E. at the University
of Maryland, was one of a team that helped
develop Western's new electroforming
process for coating steel telephone wire
with copper, lead and brass in one continu
ous operation. His job: to develop conductor
resistance-annealing equipment and electro
lyte Filtration and circulating systems.
