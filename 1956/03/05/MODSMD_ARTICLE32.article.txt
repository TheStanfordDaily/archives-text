### Frank Huntress 
Stanford haseballers scored 17 runs this past weekend to take vic
tories from the University of San Francisco and San Jose State.
The Indian Varsity defeated USF Friday by a score of 4 to 0, and
San Jose Saturday, 13 to 5, to remain undefeated. Both games were
played in Sunken Diamond.

Sunken Diamond. On Saturday
they open the CIBA season with
Santa Clara here.
The Indians had accumulated 34
consecutive innings of shutout
ball before San Jose broke the ice
in the third inning Saturday with
three runs.
Young - Thrifty
Ray Young used only GT pitches
to go the distance for the Cards
Friday. Walt Payne pitched the
entire game against San Jose.
The Indians scored two runs
each in the first and second
frames Friday against USF.
Second-sacker A 1 Shaw singled,
then stole second. Doug Camilli
came up with a short single to
right field which sent Shaw to
third.
Co-captain Bob Evans drew a
walk. On a three-and-two pitch to
A 1 Spurgeon, Tony Basques threw
past the catcher: Spurgeon drew
a base on balls, forcing Shaw
home, and Camilli followed while
the ball was loose.
Big Inning
In the second inning Steve
Stewart, Card shortstop, singled
to center. He was forced by Jerry
Morgan at second.
