# Prize-Winning 'Golden Apple' To Open Soon
## Tickets Still on Sale For Musical Epic's Western Premiere 
### 
Tickets for Stanford Players'
Western premiere of the prize
winning musical "The Golden Ap
ple" are still available for $1 and
$1.50 at Memorial Auditorium box
office. The show runs Thursday
through Saturday.
John Latouche's upside-down
epic of the "search for stable
values" in a turn-of-the-20th cen
tury Iliad and Odyssey is set to
Jerome Moross' adaptation of the
popular songs and dances of the
period: waltzes, ragtime, blues
and vaudeville turns, all with a
modern and often satiric air.
No Dialogue
There is no spoken dialogue in
I he show, bul "The Golden Apple?"
evolves from musical comedy ra
ther than opera. Instead of arti
ficial recitative, the sung dialogue
is rendered in short songs. The
effect is that of a series of inter
locking production numbers.
"Our particular approach to the
lyric theater," composer* Moross
has written in his introduction to
the published version, "was to use
the best in musical comedy, opera
and ballet forms with gay aban
don."
Musical director for the Players
production is Kirke Mechem. A
former Stanford sludent, conduc
tor and composer for Ram's Head
Big Game Gaieties, Mechem is
now assistant director of Stanford
Chorus.
