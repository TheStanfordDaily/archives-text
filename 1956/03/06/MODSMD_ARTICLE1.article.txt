## Neff Concedes to $2500 Bribery Attempt As Senate Committee Hearings End Ninth Day 
### 
(Compiled from the United Press)
WASHINGTON, March s—Oil lobbyist John M. Neff conceded to
day he offered a campaign contribution to Senator Bourke B. Hicken
loopei (R., la.) if the Senator 'was in favor" of the controversial
natural gas bill.
lie made the admission after Wendell T. Edson, a Storm Lake, la.,

■attorney, testified that Neff of
fered $2500 to Hickenlooper's cam
paign, or to any other lowa Re
publican fund, if the senator
would vote for the bill.
It was first direct testimony
that Neff's campaign offers were
contingent on a senator's vote on
the gas bill. After receiving it, a
four-man Senate committee closed
nine days of hearings into a simi
lar offer made by Neff to Sen.
Francis E. Case (R-S.D.).
Gold water
Meanwhile, Sen. Barry M. Gold
water (R-Ariz.) told a Senate lob
by investigating committee that
a Chicago resident named Keck
gave him a campaign contribu
tion in 1952.
Goldwater told reporters he did
not know the contributor's first
name or whether he was related
to California oilman Howard B.
Keck.
The United Press yesterday er
roneously identified Goldwater's
contributor as Howard B. Keck,
president of Superior Oil Co. Keck
has figured prominently in the
Senate inquiry into the $2500
"contribution" offered Case, since
Neff claimed that the $2500 he
offered Case came from the "per
sonal funds" of Howard Keck.
Not ".Material"
Committee Chairman Walter F.
George (D-Ga.) said the Gold
water contribution would not be
"material" in "shedding light on
the pattern" of the Case incident
since it took place three years
ago.
Goldwater was asked on a Sun
day TV program whether he had
ever received a contribution from
"Mr. Keck." lie quickly replied
that he had and said Ijo could
name "four or five" Democrats
who also received funds from
"Mr. Keck" as well as Republi
cans.
Goldwater told the United Press
later last night that he thought
his contributor was named "Bill
Keck." He said he would look up
the records and give newsmen de
tails if they would come to his
office today. But today Goldwater
said he had not looked into his
records on the matter and did not
intend to do so.
II ickenlooper
In today's testimony regarding
the Case "contribution," Edson
said that the offer to Hickenloop
er was made by an oil lobbyist
representing Superior Oil Co. He
told the group that he rejected
the offer because he knew Hick
enlooper "would be pretty much
shocked."
Hickenlooper voted for the gas
bill when it was passed by the
Senate last month, however. Case
opposed it. It was vetoed by Presi
dent Eisenhower because of what
he termed "arrogant" lobbying ac
tivities by a small segment of the
oil and gas industry.
Committee counsel Charles W.
Steadman recalled that Neff had
told the committee previously he
had mentioned every campaign
offer he had made since Oct. 1.
