# Traffic Com Acts to Halt Auto Thefts
## Outline Curfew Plan To Help Discourage 'Juvenile Invaders' 
### 
A recent r..sh of robberies and
car- thefts on the campus caused
the Traffic Committee to suggest
a curfew to the Legislature last
Wednesday night.
Legislature defeated the pro
posal.
Traffic Committee Chairman
Bob Maddock suggested the cam
pus curfew after consultation
with the Stanford police depart
ment. The police agreed that a
curfew would enable them to stop
juveniles who are suspected of
the thefts.
Problem Outlined
The following points wore made
at,.the LASSU meeting last Wed
nesday:
• A total of $969 worth of auto
motive accessories have been sto
len so far since the beginning of
autumn quarter.
• Individual losses have ranged
from $8 to ,;200.
• In one case, four wheels in
cluding tubes and tires were
taken off a car in the Library
parking lot.
• Thefts are steadily growing
in number.
• The police are hired prima
rily for the protection of Univer
sity buildings and not student au
tomobiles.
• At present six policemen
cover the patrolling of the cam
pus every day of the week; at
night only one man is on duty.
"Up to Police"
Of the Legislature's defeat of
the proposal, Maddock said that
"the Legislature seemed to think
it was not their responsibility to
consider measures for protection
of students' property. They felt
it was up to the police."
He added the curfew "would
have no effect on Stanford stu
dents or peaceful, law-abiding per
sons.
"It would give the police the
right to hold any persons sus
pected of crime on the campus.
Now a policeman can stop you
but if you appear to be within the
law he must let you go."
Curfew Purposes
In the opinion of the traffic
com. the curfew would serve the
purpose of:
• Discouraging juveniles from
invading the campus for looting
purposes.
• Publicizing the need for dras
tic action on the part of students
and the undermanned police de
partment to catch these thieves.
• Helping drive home to the
"powers that be" the fact that the
police force is undermanned.
• Set a precedent for Legisla
ture, as not just a group of stu
dents interested in student gov
ernment, but as a strong group
interested in the welfare of Stan
ford, California — the town and
University—that is, to set them
up as the town council responsible
for general civic problems.
Students Help
Maddock outlined three things
students can do to help the po
lice in the apprehension of the
thieves.
• Take note of any car full of
high school males driving around
campus late at night. Write down
license number of car and if be
havior is too suspicious report to
police.
• Report all stolen property to
the police no matter how trivial it
may be.
• Lock your car at all times
when not in use and especially at
night.

right to hold any persons sus
pected of crime on the campus.
Now a policeman can stop you
but if you appear to be within the
law he must let you go."
Curfew Purposes
In the opinion of the traffic
com. the curfew would serve the
purpose of:
• Discouraging juveniles from
invading the campus for looting
purposes.
• Publicizing the need for dras
tic action on the part of students
and the undermanned police de
partment to catch these thieves.
• Helping drive home to the
"powers that be" the fact that the
police force is undermanned.
• Set a precedent for Legisla
ture, as not just a group of stu
dents interested in student gov
ernment, but as a strong group
interested in the welfare of Stan
ford, California — the town and
University—that is, to set them
up as the town council responsible
for general civic problems.
Students Help
Maddock outlined three things
students can do to help the po
lice in the apprehension of the
thieves.
• Take note of any car full of
high school males driving around
campus late at night. Write down
license number of car and if be
havior is too suspicious report to
police.
• Report all stolen property to
the police no matter how trivial it
may be.
• Lock your car at all times
when not in use and especially at
night.

A recent r..sh of robberies and
car- thefts on the campus caused
the Traffic Committee to suggest
a curfew to the Legislature last
Wednesday night.
Legislature defeated the pro
posal.
Traffic Committee Chairman
Bob Maddock suggested the cam
pus curfew after consultation
with the Stanford police depart
ment. The police agreed that a
curfew would enable them to stop
juveniles who are suspected of
the thefts.
Problem Outlined
The following points wore made
at,.the LASSU meeting last Wed
nesday:
• A total of $969 worth of auto
motive accessories have been sto
len so far since the beginning of
autumn quarter.
• Individual losses have ranged
from $8 to ,;200.
• In one case, four wheels in
cluding tubes and tires were
taken off a car in the Library
parking lot.
• Thefts are steadily growing
in number.
• The police are hired prima
rily for the protection of Univer
sity buildings and not student au
tomobiles.
• At present six policemen
cover the patrolling of the cam
pus every day of the week; at
night only one man is on duty.
"Up to Police"
Of the Legislature's defeat of
the proposal, Maddock said that
"the Legislature seemed to think
it was not their responsibility to
consider measures for protection
of students' property. They felt
it was up to the police."
He added the curfew "would
have no effect on Stanford stu
dents or peaceful, law-abiding per
sons.
"It would give the police the
right to hold any persons sus
pected of crime on the campus.
Now a policeman can stop you
but if you appear to be within the
law he must let you go."
