# Pacifist Says Racial Strife Drives Asia to Communists
## Muste Claims Hope for Peace Lies in Asian, European Refusal to Support Military Blocs

"Happenings in the American
South today are shuttling a bil
: lion people in underdeveloped
countries to Communism. This is
a constant reminder to them of
white supremacy," said A. J.
I Muste, speaking in Cubberley Au
ditorium last night.
Muste, writer, lecturer and cru
| sader for peace, continued by say
ing, "The hope for peace lies not
in Russia or the United States but
in Japan, Burma, Western Europe
and other such areas, in their re
fusal to support either military
bloc or indiscriminate industriali
zation."
"In the United States the Third
Camp must support these ele
ments in other countries, oppose
; militarism in both the U.S. and
Russia and racism here."
Offer Alternative
"If the Third Camp got itself
organized," Muste said, "it would j
be decisive in event of military ac-j
tion between the two dominant
powers." A group of nations that
builds its social life without mili
tary strength would offer an al
ternative to dictatorship or cajM-1
talism.
Mere neutralism will not be ef
fective, he said. "Independence
will be required if there is to be a
new force for peace. If, in a show
down, the only economic regimes j
in the world arc American capi-1
talism and total Communism all:
people will have to choose be
tween them. In that case gen
uine independence cannot be
achieved."
Socialists have lost the non-mil
itary feeling as they become in

ereasingly tied in with national in
terests and NATO. Now the Com
munist party offers the masses
more assurance of no connection
with America.
"If democratic Socialists had
been sending organizations into
the East as the Communists have,
the situation would be different,"
Muste declared.
Strongest Party
"The strongest party in ilv
world today," Muste said, "that
holds the Third Camp independ
ent pacifist position is the Social
ists in Japan. They want a Japan
independent of both the United
States and Russia."
Muste concluded by saving,
"People in foreign countries have
a desire to know there are some
in the United States who sympa
thize with their need for an inde
pendent position."
