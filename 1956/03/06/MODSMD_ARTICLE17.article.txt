# Drastic Action Needed
## 
### 
Thf m MBF.R of car thefts and petty robberies
on campus has increased to tin* point where
the Stanford Police Department has suggested
that a curfew be established to prevent juvenile
thievery.
The proposal was placed before Legislature
last Wednesday night by student traffic commit
tee chairman Bob Maddock, but it was con
sidered unnecessary and voted down by Legis
lature members.
A curfew is not the only feasible answer, but
if is a possible puggestron that merits further
consideration bv Legislature and the University
administration.
Maddock pointed out that the proposed cur
few would have no ell'cct on Stanford students
or law-abiding citizens. His main point was
that announcement of a curfew would deter
persons bent on looting or vandalism from

entering the campus and would facilitate cap
ture and retention of these persons.
Most other towns and cities enforce curfew
laws to protect the property and citizens of
their communities.
A curfew is not intended as the sole means
of preventing jouth crime, but it does act to
keep potential juvenile looting gangs from
tlieir nightly prowls.
Maddock emphasized that "drastic action"
must he taken, and we agree with him.
We recognize the difficulty of financing a
large police force, and possibly the present
gendarmerie is sufficiently large.
If so, additional measures are needed, and
we would suggest that Legislature reconsider
the curfew proposal as a partial answer to the
looting problem.
