This permits the Greek organizations which
resigned from ASUCLA to be publicized in the

The Student Judicial Board violently op
poses this move, saying it gives the groups spe
cial privileges without demanding commensu
rate obligations. *
Chairman of the board characterizes ihe
council as a bunch of "self-seeking, gutless,
petty politicians" and calls on them to resign
immediately.

Commenting on Stanford's resignation from
NSA, the NSA co-ordinator at Cal says mem
bers of that organization must have more than
"the characteristic American 'what's-in-it-for
me?' attitude."
Hy believes NSA will not be able to develop
a good national program until schools realize
what it is and are willing to do more than sit
back and wait for a return on their money.
One of the group's main purposes, he says,
is to prevent extreme political groups from
being the only student organizations, which
would probably happen if ISSA ceased to exist.
