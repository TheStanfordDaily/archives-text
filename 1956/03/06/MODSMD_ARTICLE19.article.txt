##

Students consider the ruling "shocking and
unrealistic" since il is honored more in the

recently suspended for violation.

Both the University of Washington and the
University of California are agitating for re
peal of restrictions banning political
on their campuses.
At Washington the Board of Regents has said
political speeches are not the business of the
university. The Washington Daily believes this
is an unenlightened altitude and against free
dom of thought.
At Cal the ruling says both sides of any po
litical issue or party must be presented at one
meeting. This effectively prevents partisan ac
tivities such as the Young Republicans from
meeting on campus.
The ruling is the result of a state law that no
school may be used for partisan political pur
poses. Students want a re-evaluation, and say
that fallacious beliefs shouldn't be feared by
an institution of higher education.

Engineering students at the University of
British Columbia face a $100 fine and loss of
their annual budget for publicizing their soci
ety's annual dance.
The group was first fined five dollars for past
ing stickers advertising the "Godiva Gallop" on
campus. Undeterred, the engineers proceeded
to paint red Lady Godivas to inform university
students of the event.
The student council explained its action by
saying the engineers had shown "flagrant dis
respect for student administration." The Übys
sey (student newspaper) says the council's ac
tion was "the act of a petulant child."
