Cancer and Smoking
Editor, The Daily:
In the January issue o£ the Atlantic Monthly,
Dr. Charles S. Cameron, medical and scientific
director of the American Cancer Society, dis
cusses the problem of lung cancer and smoking.
Dr. Cameron states plainly that the Society does
not hold that the smoking of tobacco causes.lung
ranker.
However, at the- close of his article he repeals
the statement of a doctor friend to the effect that
if as much association were to be established be
tween lung cancer and eating spinach as has been
established between lung cancer and smoking, no
one would say a word about excluding spinach
from the national diet.
In other words, Dr. Cameron seems to be very
strongly of the opinion—and the statistics and
facts he qu tes in his article seem reason enough
for opii ion—that there is a direct correlation
between smoking and lung cancer.
I find this statement particularly ominous
when realize the concentrated attempt of to
bacco companies to induce college students to
smoke. The tobacco companies are, of course, in
terested in college students because they will be
long-term customers, because as potential leaders
in all walks of life their habits will be copied, and
because advertising on college radio stations and
in college publications is relatively cheap.
1 wonder if Mr. Terry S. Batcman, KZSU sta
tion manager —who recently stated in a letter to
the editor I hat Ihe "more" important reason for
KZSU':. handling of cigarette advertising (and it
handles a great deal when one considers its lim
ited program) was because of the money the ad
vertising brought in is aware of Dr. Cameron's
article and the reasons why tobacco companies
are interested in advertising over "The Voice of
Stanford"?
It seems a little paradoxical to me that the
radio "Voice" of Stanford, a university suppos
edly dedicated to the truths and implications of
science, should be used to advertise a product
which the medical and scientifi? director of the
foremost cncer research society in America, if
not in the world, implies is directly connected
with lung cancer.

On Writing Letters
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Johnson, Mr. Samson and Mr. Edmonds:
I was quite disappointed in your letter to the
editor Monday. Why don't you nasty fellows leave
The Daily alone? Next time you wrile The Daily
a letter you should consider several things first:

1. You are only typical students representing
student opinion. The Daily, on the other hand, is
representative of that fine segment of public
opinion, the Daily editorial staff.
2. You are unorganized, and therefore your
opinion cannot possibly be of any importance.
The Daily, however, is well organized and disci
plined and therefore always and completely right.
We know this to be true because certain groups
are out to "get revenge" against The Daily, and
if The Daily had ever been wrong one of these
groups would surely have taken over by now.
3. For your own protection you should leave
The Daily alone. Whenever you write The Daily
you are putting yourself in a very precarious
position. The.Daily has a huge supply of bold
face and even some boldface caps.
In addition to the front page and the editorial
column The Daily can strike back at you (or your
group) in the Letters to the Editor column. This
is a special feature of The Daily, for, although all
creditable newspapers and magazines leave their
letters column open to letters from readers, due
to some obscure precedent, set not too long ago,
The Daily is now no longer bound by this .jour
nalistic custom, and the editors are free to use
this space any way they want.
4. Finally, for the sake of the editors' mental
health please leave thom alone. Just last Monday
the situation got so bad it was felt necessary to
publish an editorial complaining about hearing
bells.
When visitors come to Stanford in the future
we don't want to have to tell them that our Daily
is not as good as some papers because the editor
hears bells, do we?
So come on, you guys. Be nice about it now.
Leave The Daily alone.
Frank Smead
Editor's Note: The letters lo the Editor col
innn in The Daily has always been, and still is,
reserved strictly for reader opinion, contrary to
many "creditable newspajwrs and magazines"
who have members of" their own stuffs write let
ters to the editor to stir up controversy or to push
editorial crusades. The list of publications that
do this would surprise many who are unfamiliar
with commercial journalism.
Each and every letter which appears in our
letters column Is written by a reader, never by a
staff member.
The boldface Editor's Notes are used to explain
errors in fact or to clarify a situation.
The hells in question are heard every week by
many disturbed students and we were attempting
to make their Sundays more relaxing.
They don't bother us; we're up at that hour of
the morning putting out the paper.

are out to "get revenge" against The Daily, and
if The Daily had ever been wrong one of these
groups would surely have taken over by now.
3. For your own protection you should leave
The Daily alone. Whenever you write The Daily
you are putting yourself in a very precarious
position. The.Daily has a huge supply of bold
face and even some boldface caps.
In addition to the front page and the editorial
column The Daily can strike back at you (or your
group) in the Letters to the Editor column. This
is a special feature of The Daily, for, although all
creditable newspapers and magazines leave their
letters column open to letters from readers, due
to some obscure precedent, set not too long ago,
The Daily is now no longer bound by this .jour
nalistic custom, and the editors are free to use
this space any way they want.
4. Finally, for the sake of the editors' mental
health please leave thom alone. Just last Monday
the situation got so bad it was felt necessary to
publish an editorial complaining about hearing
bells.
When visitors come to Stanford in the future
we don't want to have to tell them that our Daily
is not as good as some papers because the editor
hears bells, do we?
So come on, you guys. Be nice about it now.
Leave The Daily alone.

Cancer and Smoking
Editor, The Daily:
In the January issue o£ the Atlantic Monthly,
Dr. Charles S. Cameron, medical and scientific
director of the American Cancer Society, dis
cusses the problem of lung cancer and smoking.
Dr. Cameron states plainly that the Society does
not hold that the smoking of tobacco causes.lung
ranker.
However, at the- close of his article he repeals
the statement of a doctor friend to the effect that
if as much association were to be established be
tween lung cancer and eating spinach as has been
established between lung cancer and smoking, no
one would say a word about excluding spinach
from the national diet.
In other words, Dr. Cameron seems to be very
strongly of the opinion—and the statistics and
facts he qu tes in his article seem reason enough
for opii ion—that there is a direct correlation
between smoking and lung cancer.
I find this statement particularly ominous
when realize the concentrated attempt of to
bacco companies to induce college students to
smoke. The tobacco companies are, of course, in
terested in college students because they will be
long-term customers, because as potential leaders
in all walks of life their habits will be copied, and
because advertising on college radio stations and
in college publications is relatively cheap.
1 wonder if Mr. Terry S. Batcman, KZSU sta
tion manager —who recently stated in a letter to
the editor I hat Ihe "more" important reason for
KZSU':. handling of cigarette advertising (and it
handles a great deal when one considers its lim
ited program) was because of the money the ad
vertising brought in is aware of Dr. Cameron's
article and the reasons why tobacco companies
are interested in advertising over "The Voice of
Stanford"?
It seems a little paradoxical to me that the
radio "Voice" of Stanford, a university suppos
edly dedicated to the truths and implications of
science, should be used to advertise a product
which the medical and scientifi? director of the
foremost cncer research society in America, if
not in the world, implies is directly connected
with lung cancer.

Mr. Johnson, Mr. Samson and Mr. Edmonds:
I was quite disappointed in your letter to the

The Daily alone? Next time you wrile The Daily
a letter you should consider several things first:

student opinion. The Daily, on the other hand, is
representative of that fine segment of public
opinion, the Daily editorial staff.
2. You are unorganized, and therefore your
opinion cannot possibly be of any importance.
The Daily, however, is well organized and disci
plined and therefore always and completely right.

from the national diet.
In other words, Dr. Cameron seems to be very
strongly of the opinion—and the statistics and
facts he qu tes in his article seem reason enough
for opii ion—that there is a direct correlation
between smoking and lung cancer.
I find this statement particularly ominous
when realize the concentrated attempt of to
bacco companies to induce college students to
smoke. The tobacco companies are, of course, in
terested in college students because they will be
long-term customers, because as potential leaders
in all walks of life their habits will be copied, and
because advertising on college radio stations and
in college publications is relatively cheap.
1 wonder if Mr. Terry S. Batcman, KZSU sta
tion manager —who recently stated in a letter to
the editor I hat Ihe "more" important reason for
KZSU':. handling of cigarette advertising (and it
handles a great deal when one considers its lim
ited program) was because of the money the ad
vertising brought in is aware of Dr. Cameron's
article and the reasons why tobacco companies
are interested in advertising over "The Voice of
Stanford"?
It seems a little paradoxical to me that the
radio "Voice" of Stanford, a university suppos
edly dedicated to the truths and implications of
science, should be used to advertise a product
which the medical and scientifi? director of the
foremost cncer research society in America, if
not in the world, implies is directly connected
with lung cancer.

On Writing Letters
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Johnson, Mr. Samson and Mr. Edmonds:
I was quite disappointed in your letter to the
editor Monday. Why don't you nasty fellows leave
The Daily alone? Next time you wrile The Daily
a letter you should consider several things first:

1. You are only typical students representing
student opinion. The Daily, on the other hand, is
representative of that fine segment of public
opinion, the Daily editorial staff.
2. You are unorganized, and therefore your
opinion cannot possibly be of any importance.
The Daily, however, is well organized and disci
plined and therefore always and completely right.
We know this to be true because certain groups
are out to "get revenge" against The Daily, and
if The Daily had ever been wrong one of these
groups would surely have taken over by now.
3. For your own protection you should leave
The Daily alone. Whenever you write The Daily
you are putting yourself in a very precarious
position. The.Daily has a huge supply of bold
face and even some boldface caps.
In addition to the front page and the editorial
column The Daily can strike back at you (or your
group) in the Letters to the Editor column. This
is a special feature of The Daily, for, although all
creditable newspapers and magazines leave their
letters column open to letters from readers, due
to some obscure precedent, set not too long ago,
The Daily is now no longer bound by this .jour
nalistic custom, and the editors are free to use
this space any way they want.
4. Finally, for the sake of the editors' mental
health please leave thom alone. Just last Monday
the situation got so bad it was felt necessary to
publish an editorial complaining about hearing
bells.
When visitors come to Stanford in the future
we don't want to have to tell them that our Daily
is not as good as some papers because the editor
hears bells, do we?
So come on, you guys. Be nice about it now.
Leave The Daily alone.

Editor's Note: The letters lo the Editor col
innn in The Daily has always been, and still is,
reserved strictly for reader opinion, contrary to
many "creditable newspajwrs and magazines"
who have members of" their own stuffs write let
ters to the editor to stir up controversy or to push
editorial crusades. The list of publications that
do this would surprise many who are unfamiliar
with commercial journalism.
Each and every letter which appears in our
letters column Is written by a reader, never by a
staff member.
The boldface Editor's Notes are used to explain
errors in fact or to clarify a situation.
The hells in question are heard every week by
many disturbed students and we were attempting
to make their Sundays more relaxing.
They don't bother us; we're up at that hour of
the morning putting out the paper.
Cancer and Smoking
Editor, The Daily:
In the January issue o£ the Atlantic Monthly,
Dr. Charles S. Cameron, medical and scientific
director of the American Cancer Society, dis
cusses the problem of lung cancer and smoking.
Dr. Cameron states plainly that the Society does
not hold that the smoking of tobacco causes.lung
ranker.
However, at the- close of his article he repeals
the statement of a doctor friend to the effect that
if as much association were to be established be
tween lung cancer and eating spinach as has been
established between lung cancer and smoking, no
one would say a word about excluding spinach
from the national diet.
In other words, Dr. Cameron seems to be very
strongly of the opinion—and the statistics and
facts he qu tes in his article seem reason enough
for opii ion—that there is a direct correlation
between smoking and lung cancer.
I find this statement particularly ominous
when realize the concentrated attempt of to
bacco companies to induce college students to

in all walks of life their habits will be copied, and
because advertising on college radio stations and
