### 
Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi was
elected chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee hy his colleagues last Friday. This is
the body which handles civil rights matters.
The wise sages of Capitol Hill must have
been asleep when they made this selection;
Eastland has always been an outspoken critic
of integration and a symbol of defiance against
the Supreme Court's desegregation decision.
But now he's in the driver's seat and you

can be sure that any civil rights progress will
be all but stopped if he has bis »a\ and lie
will.
Senatorial custom be damned, the fact that
Eastland, by custom, should have gotten his

a symbol of defiance against tolerance and fair
play is of the essence.
\ es, the good Senators must surely have been
asleep last Friday.
