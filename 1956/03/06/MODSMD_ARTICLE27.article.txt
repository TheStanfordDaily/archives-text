# Win-Mad Winged '0' Snaps Frosh Cagers' Win String
## Papooses Warm Up by Beating Braves, 58-50, Then Hold Olympic Olympic Club's Bob Matheny to Two 
### Dave Canfield 
The freshman basket ball team's
victory string was snapped at 11
Saturday night, but the Papooses
won a moral victory by giving the
all-powerful Olympic Club a scare.
After warming up Friday night
by beating Stanford's Braves, 58-
fiO, the Papooses came within five
points of smashing ihe Olympic
Club's 19-game win streak. The
score was 73-08.
Coach Dick Clegg's crew also
held Bob Matheny, Olympic Club
guard and former PCC All-South
ern Division for Cal, to two
meager points. Matheny, who en
tered California when most of
Stanford's frosh were in seventh
grade, was only the fifth wheel
for the Winged "O."
Showing little awe of the run
ners-up in last ye.u's National
AAU Tournament, the Frosh
jumped to a 7-2 bulge. .
It was Brent Leonard, 6 ft. 7 in.
beanpole from Shasta, California,
who led this rush by pumping in
two free throws and by faking the
Winged "O" boys right out of

their shoes to score a jump shot.
The Olympic Club's Phil Vuki
cevich then stole the ball and |
flashed down the court for an |
easy lay-in, and the WingodiO was
off.
Four Straight
Paul Saunders, the Olympic
Club's awkward • looking substi
tute guard, poled four straight
30-foot set shots as the Winged
"O" marched to a 25-20 lead. That
five-point bulge was virtually the
margin of victory.
The 43 fouls called attested to
the roughness of a game that saw
George McLaughlin, the Winged
"O's" high scorer witli 21, kick
Paul Neumann, best Frosh point
maker with 19, in the head.
In Friday night's 58-50 win over
the junior varsity, the Papooses
had too much shooting ability and
poise for a dogged Brave club.
Outshooting their older broth
ers, 44 to 22 per cent, the Class of
'59 shot to a 6-0 advantage as
John Pflueger got an early start
toward meshing 18 points.
Frosh Coast
After coasting to a 30-26 half
time cushion, the Papooses iced
the game.
Paced by the rebounding and
shooting of Pflueger, the Frosh
held their big brothers scoreless i
for the first seven minutes of the I
second half. During this time the j
Cleggmen zoomed to a 42-26 ad- i
vantage.
Then the Braves' Tom Dyer
tipped one in—into the Frosh bas
ket, that is—to put his team two
points more in the hole.
But this seemed to open the
flood gates for the junior varsity.
With Dyer, Mansfield, Rose and
Jay Jackson leading the way, the
Lynnmen bottled up their young
er brothers with their far-out de
fense, controlled the boards and
slashed the freshman defense to i
pieces.
