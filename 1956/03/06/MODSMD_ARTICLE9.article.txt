# Men's Council Selects Shoup
## 
### 
Don Shoup, a junior from Now
York City, will replace Fred Stone
as a member of Men's Council
next quarter. Stone is resigning
because he is getting married in
spring vacation.
Shoup was chosen by the Coun
cil after interviews and has been
approved by the Legislature to
fill out Stone's term, which runs
until June. He lives at Stern.
In other action, Men's Council
found three students guilty of
Fundamental Standard violations
last week. The first was arrested
by the police when they found
several cans of unopened beer in
his car. It is illegal for a minor
to possess alcoholic beverages in
public places or on public streets
or highways.
He was sentenced to five hours
of work at the Convalescent Home
and to make a written report to
the Council and to the county
judge who had already given him
a fine and one-day suspended jail
sentence.
The other two students, also
minors, were arrested by the Los
Altos police after they had been
stopped for faulty lights.
They had gone to a store where
one had purchased beer. Then
they drove off and drank it.
The men were returning to
campus when the police stopped
them. Beer was found in the car,
and the two were arrested for
possession of alcohol on a public
highway.
Faeh received a fine and a sus
pended one day sentence and was
turned over to Men's Council for
further action. The Council gave
the students each five hours of
work at Iho Con Home and re
quired a written report be made
to the indue.
