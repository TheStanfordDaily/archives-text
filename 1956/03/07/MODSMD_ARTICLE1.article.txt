# U.S. Reiterates Atom Ban With Proper Inspections
## Eisenhower Stresses Safeguard Arrangements; Insists on Skies Inspection of Russia 
### 
WASHING I ON, March 6 (UP) â€”President Eisenhower told Soviet
Premier Nikolai Bulganin today the United States would agree to ban
future A-bomb and H-bomb production if Russia would help establish
a "satisfactory" arms inspection system.
The new U.S. proposal, contained in a friendly letter to Buleanin,

-specified that any such atomic
arms halt would have to involve
"safeguarded arrangements"- evi
dently to insure against secret vio
lations.
Eisenhower also said his plan
would take effect only after a
combination of his "open skies"
arms inspection plan and Russia's
i ground inspection proposal is in
"satisfactory" operation. Russia
thus far has balked at the Presi
dent's "open skies" proposal.
Eisenhower said his proposed
ban on nuclear weapons produc
tion. coupled with his ear lier plan
for joint contributions of atomic
materials to an international
agency, would "reverse the pres
ent trend" toward ever-increasing
atomic weapons "overhanging the
world."
He recognized the problems, but
said the risks involved in failing
to control atomic weapons "make
it imperative to overcome the dif
ficulties involved . .
"With genuine efforts on both
sides, I feel confident we can suc
ceed in this endeavor," he told
Bulganin.
The proposal would not affect
current stockpiles of atomic weap
ons. Eisenhower said this country
would continue to hold its nuclear
weapons "not for aggression . . .
but as a contribution toward
world stability in this transitional
period."
Eisenhower's proposal was
praised in Congress. But Chair
man Clinton P. Anderson of the
Joint Congressional Atomic Com
mittee said the Soviet Union prob
ably would say "No" because it
thinks this country has more
atomic weapons already on hand.
Sen. Walter F. George (D-Ga.>,
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, praised the
President for a "very good state
ment" and an "approach . . . of
temperateness and conservatism."
Both Republicans and Demo
crats said the President's propos
al was "another step in the right
direction." Sen. Henry M. Jackson
< D-Wash. i praised Eisenhower for
making "an attempt to slow down
the terrible atomic arms race."
The President challenged Rus
sia to new efforts to seek a work
able disarmament plan at forth
coming meetings of a United Na
tions subcommittee in London.
Subcommittee member's are Rus
sia, Britain, France, Canada and
this country.
