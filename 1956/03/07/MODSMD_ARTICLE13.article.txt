# Horns Blare, Drums Rattle, Prof Honored
## Law Students Present Teacher Osborne With Scrolls and Tiger Tail 
### 
A blare of trumpets and a roll
of drums greeted Profess (it-
George Edward Osborne of the
Law faculty yesterday morning as
he entered his 11 o'clock class in
Personal Property and Equity.
The first-year Stanford law stu
dents proceeded with the cere
monies by presenting him with
two scrolls and a tiger's tail on a
black pillow.
The tiger tail was a memento
of an earlier class discussion over
a hypothetical situation posed by
the professor concerning a tiger
trap and a principle of property
possession.
The ceremonies honored Profes
sor Osborne on his final day of
teaching the first-year course.
The scrolls and tiger's tail were
brought into the room by three
first-year students garbed in black
robes and white wigs (created
from mops). The scrolls were
read, the first containing the his
tory of the tiger tail and the
second the signatures of all the
members of the first-year class
bequeathing the tiger tail to Pro
fessor Osborne.
The tail, made by a first-year
student, was then presented to the
professor.
Another roll of drums, a stand
ing ovation and the entire class
singing "For He's a Jolly Good
Fellow" completed the ceremonies
honoring the professor.
Professor Osborne has been a
in cm her of the Stanford Law
School faculty since 1023 and is a
specialist on property security
and trusts. He has had wide ex
perience in government labor me
diation and commercial arbitra
tion.
