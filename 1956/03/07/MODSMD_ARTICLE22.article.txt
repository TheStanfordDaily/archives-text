### 
I I HAS OFTFN been i< 1 ill#'TP is a latent interest
iii political affairs on college campuses, but en
thusiasm for things political seems to remain
Intent most of the lime.
I 11is interest springs to life briefly during the
national campaigns; l>nt then the spark dies and
lies smoldering for the next three and a half
years.
In recognition of tin's fact, a "Citizenship
Clearing House," affiliated vvitb the l.a\4 Outer
of \ew ork University, has been established,
financed and has begun its work to spur greater
interest in political activities throughout the
nation's college* and universities.
Several mouths ago Stanford was selected to
ho the home of the Northern California (Hear

ing House, which would channel funds to po
litical organizations on campuses in this area
and ; .tempt to initiate new activities to stimu
late this "latent interest. "
1" unds have been provided and the iocal elear
ing house, headed by Dr. Hobert Horn of the
political science department, has scheduled its
first aelivity.
It has offered financial aid to the Stanford
Political I nion, whose activities are expected
to mount as the election draws near. >.
We thank the Citizenship Clearing House for
their efforts devoted to the training of tomor
row's leaders, and trust that we, as potential
leaders, will not waste the opportunities they
have offered us.
