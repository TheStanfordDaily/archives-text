Yi sti tuny \ oroit of 2' students met to discuss
I lie formation of a Stanford chapter of the Na
tional Association for Ihe Advancement of Col
ored People.
The merits of having an organization of this
nature on campus are debatable, but if its in
troduction serves no other purpose, it will be
to stimulate student interest in the vital issues
of civil rights and racial integration.

If this chapter continues to function, it will
provide interested students with an opportunity
to study more thoroughly an issue which, most
admit, is of serious concern, but not sufficiently
understood.
But if it fails, we hope it would be for more
valid reasons than the fact lhal students just
do not care.
