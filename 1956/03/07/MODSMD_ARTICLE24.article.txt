### HELEN DEWAR 
The edge was taken off tlie Democratic party's
campaign buoyancy last week when President
Eisenhower made his dramatic annoiuiceinent
ih.u he would endeavor to hold onto the govern
mental reins for another four years.
11 doesn't take much political horse sense to
see that the Democrats will face a bleak, uphill
light in the next eight months.
Hut if their chances are dimmed by the Presi
dent's availability, they are immeasurably
brightened by the indications floating around
Washington that Vice-President Nixon will
again rear his head in the second-place spot.
Despite his acquiescence during the last four
years, the young man's dubious reputation for
making irresponsible and vicious attacks is not
easily erased from the public's mind and the
thought of Eisenhower's incapacitation during
the term and Nixon's assumption of the Presi
dency will be too much for many voters to
stomach.
Eisenhower may find that his 'passive" cam
paign will backfire if he sends Nixon out to do
his trouble-shooting.
As the Democrat most likely to succeed to the
Presidency, Adlai Stevenson faces the prospect
of gambling success in this campaign against a
possible political demise.
Although realizing the political implications
of a two-time defeat, Stevenson has said that
Eisenhower's announcement does not deter his
desire to run.
It is not totally unfeasible that the Demo
crats may win in November if they conduct a
dyn unic, thoroughgoing and constructive cam
paign.
And it is not the character of American po
litical parlies to ; ;'ve up before the fight begins.
The Democrats can be expected to air before
the voters every facet of th»* Eisenhower Ad
ministration in which they detect failure.
It is Stevenson's intellectual capacities, po
litical know-how and personal popularity which
will serve as the best challenge to the "lkr and
Dirk"' team.
