# Three Hats in the Ring-Which Should the Demos Pick to Run?

### JIM PALMER 
The logical man for the Democratic Presiden
tial nomination is Averell Harriman.
With the prospect of President Eisenhower's
renomination and re-election, the Democrats
must choose carefully if they are to prevent
utter devastation in 1956 national voting.
The fact is clear: Republicans will most as
suredly win with Eisenhower.
If Democrats renominate candidate Steven
son they will be spelling Adlai's political doom
for future years. For even if the mian from the
Land of Lincoln gave the President a good race,
it would he his last.
I'wo defeats in the Presidential political
arena spell death for any man. Thomas K.
Dewey found it out. Adlai would too.
Why not Estes Kefauver?
He might as well save his breath. Even
though hiR support is strong from lower party
echelons, the top brass don't like him. The 1952
convention proved that beyond any reasonable
doubt.
The political "bosses"—the men at the top —
favor Stevenson. Kefauver has trodden on too
many important toes to catch the favorable go
ahead from powerful forces.
That leaves Harriman, the logical man by
elimination.
In Harriman, Democrats have the solution to
their worries. Deadlock between Stevenson and
Kefauver forces can he solved through nominat
ing the middle man, a very popular Governor
of New York.
Wise Democrats would save Stevenson an
other four years to catch the Republicans with
their Old Guard down in 1960.
Indeed, Harriman might prove an effective
standard bearer in 1956 and give the President
an interesting race. Even with defeat, Ave could
he a top prospect for 1960.
It is time for the Party of the Donkey to face
reality and plan shrewdly for the future. To
waste the talented Stevenson in '56 would be
folly.
To point to 1960 might be wise.
