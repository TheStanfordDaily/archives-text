# Letters to the Editor

4 lfs About Time*
Editor, The Daily:
I agree wholeheartedly with the letter by Frank
Smead, published in The Daily yesterday. It is
about time that someone has taken the initiative
to tell the editors just where they stand in regard
to some of their answers to letters from conscien
tious students.
There is no problem involved when the Daily
editors express their own opinions and label them
as such, but when they hide behind the title of
"student opinion," who do they think they are
kidding? The editorial on bells certainly did not
express my opinion, nor that of my friends.
Whenever student opinion is commending or
disapproving actions, there is generally a deluge
of letters to the editor. This does not seem to be
true in the "bell case." If we are to believe that
there is need for a campaign against noise, then
why are there no letters complaining of fire
engine sirens or of the horn that, squawks every
day at 5 p.m.?
If there is a true student dislike of the bells,
let there be a survey or a vote taken to establish

the fact, not a casual editorial using non-existent
supposed facts.
Congratulations to Mr. Smead for being un
afraid of the "boldface execution marks."

Editor's Note: We have never claimed that our
editorials were "student opinion," as we said in
our editorial of Monday, Jan. 30:
"Our editorials are unsigned; they express the
opinion of The Daily, not necessarily that of an
individual.
"The reader always has Ihe opportunity to
answer, or to express his own opinion, through
the ietters-to-the-editor column."
The editorial on the hells was in answer to
complaints we had heard from residents of Union
and surrounding' dormitories; In other words, the
result of reporting, which is our .job.
The facts do exist.
We repeal for those unfamiliar with standard
newspaper practices: "The boldface Editor's
Notes are used to explain errors in fact or to
clarify a situation."
Our opinions are reserved for editorials, and
they are based on our observations of the campus
as a whole, also our job.
