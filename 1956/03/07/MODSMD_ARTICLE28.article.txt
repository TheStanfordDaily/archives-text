# Few Stanford Students Hear KZSU; Poll Finds Announcing Main Complaint
## Quality of Music Good, But Programs Lack Professional Polish 
### Dave Canfield 
One hundred thirty students
! work to keep KZSU on the air.
Are their efforts being appreci
ated l>y the Stanford student
body ?
That was the question which
The Daily was trying to answer
when it conducted a poll of 80
students recently in the library
j and the Cellar.
Only 40 per cent of those polled
! said they had ever listened to
KZSU. Ahd of the listening stu
dents, a meager 7 per cent felt
the student station represented
professional quality.
Dislike Announcers
Half of the other 93 per cent
liked KZSU's music as well as
i that on any professional station,
but disliked the announcing.
"The announcers," declared one
sophomore woman, "goof, start
laughing, drop things and play
the wrong records."
Others criticized station an
nouncers for using too many "uhs
and ahs."
Summing up the attitude of
those polled, one woman empha
sized: "You can't expect them to
lie as good as professionals. They
simply haven't Ijad the training."
While rating KZSU inferior to
professional stations, the students
wholeheartedly supported "The
Voice of Stanford" on another
point.
Disagree
Ninety-four per cent disagreed
with the letter to the editor in the
Feb. 24 Daily. That letter criti
cized KZSU's "Jill Corey Show"
for advertising Old Gold cigar
ettes.
"112 (hink the cigarette ads are
the best KZSU has," asserted a
junior woman.
A senior man agreed. "I don't
see how a commercial could cor
rupt a mature college student," he
said. "I don't smoke, and I'm not
going to be corrupted by Jill Co
rey."
Beside showing loyalty to the
"Jill Corey Show," students did
generally approve KZSU pro
gramming as a whole. An even
70 per cent thought the programs
were good, while one-fifth rated
them fair and one-tenth praised
them as "excellent."
Favorite Programs
So far as favorite programs go,
25 per cent liked classical music
best and 25 per cent went to the
other extreme and picked "Stan
\ ford Sadie" as tops.
Other shows mentioned were
broadcasts of basketball games,
"Janitor" and "Relaxation."
A Stern Hall freshman said his
favorite program was that con
ducted by a person in his dorm.
"We listen," admitted this frosh,
"to see if he'll tie up or not."
Many listeners offered con
structive suggestions to KZSU ex
ecutives. Suggestions ranged from
"Kiss off popular music and have
more classical music" to "Have
more sexy programs" and"I think
KZSU should be more like the
Chaparral."

"112 (hink the cigarette ads are
the best KZSU has," asserted a
junior woman.
A senior man agreed. "I don't
see how a commercial could cor
rupt a mature college student," he
said. "I don't smoke, and I'm not
going to be corrupted by Jill Co
rey."
Beside showing loyalty to the
"Jill Corey Show," students did
generally approve KZSU pro
gramming as a whole. An even
70 per cent thought the programs
were good, while one-fifth rated
them fair and one-tenth praised
them as "excellent."
Favorite Programs
So far as favorite programs go,
25 per cent liked classical music
best and 25 per cent went to the
other extreme and picked "Stan
\ ford Sadie" as tops.
Other shows mentioned were
broadcasts of basketball games,
"Janitor" and "Relaxation."
A Stern Hall freshman said his
favorite program was that con
ducted by a person in his dorm.
"We listen," admitted this frosh,
"to see if he'll tie up or not."
Many listeners offered con
structive suggestions to KZSU ex
ecutives. Suggestions ranged from
"Kiss off popular music and have
more classical music" to "Have
more sexy programs" and"I think
KZSU should be more like the
Chaparral."

One hundred thirty students
! work to keep KZSU on the air.
Are their efforts being appreci
ated l>y the Stanford student
body ?
That was the question which
The Daily was trying to answer
when it conducted a poll of 80
students recently in the library
j and the Cellar.
Only 40 per cent of those polled
! said they had ever listened to
KZSU. Ahd of the listening stu
dents, a meager 7 per cent felt
the student station represented
professional quality.
Dislike Announcers
Half of the other 93 per cent
liked KZSU's music as well as
i that on any professional station,
but disliked the announcing.
"The announcers," declared one
sophomore woman, "goof, start
laughing, drop things and play
the wrong records."
Others criticized station an
nouncers for using too many "uhs
and ahs."
Summing up the attitude of
those polled, one woman empha
sized: "You can't expect them to
lie as good as professionals. They
simply haven't Ijad the training."
While rating KZSU inferior to
professional stations, the students
wholeheartedly supported "The
Voice of Stanford" on another
point.
Disagree
Ninety-four per cent disagreed
with the letter to the editor in the
Feb. 24 Daily. That letter criti
cized KZSU's "Jill Corey Show"
