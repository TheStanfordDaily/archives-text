# Prize-Winning 'Golden Apple' Will Open Here
## West Coast Premiere Of New York Musical Scheduled Tomorrow 
### 
The Stanford Players' western
premiere of the prize-winning mu
sical "The Golden Apple" opens
tomorrow night at 8:30 in the Me
morial Auditorium.
A few tickets are still available
for $1 and $1.50 at the box office
from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m. The show
runs through Saturday.
Co-author John Latouche speci
fied in his librettoâ€”and William
Allisdn has executed for the Play
ers a group -of stage settings
that participate as more than a
backdrop for the show's action.
Starting with a basically anti
realistic two-dimensional plan, Al
lison has come up with sets that
do everything but sing.
Paris arrives in a balloon, one
of Ulysses' men shoots off in a
rocket and the whole male popu
lation of Angels' Roost rows down
Ihe river to fight the Trojan War
in a boat with a singing mast
head.
In one scene it is the actors
themselves who are the scenery,
wearing sandwich-board trees and
houses instead of clothing.
To give the show continuity and
a sense of flow, scene changes are
made before the audience's eyes.
The houses of Penelope and Helen
slide in and out, and the whole
city of Rhododendron slides back
lo reveal the homes at Angels'
Roost.
Nearly 200 costumes are requir
ed for the production, mostly in
the turn-of-the-century style
with the inevitable modern twist.
Designer is Virginia Opsvig.
Lights for the production were
designed by Bob Brand, and Terry
Sandke is head of the shift crew.
