# Ike Asks Nixon to Declare Intentions About Running For Vice-President Again
## Several Republicans Think Disclosure Means Nixon Can Have Nomination If He Wants It 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 7 (UP) — President Eisenhower disclosed
today he has asked Vice-President Richard M. Nixon to "tell mc what I
he would like to do" about running for Vice-President again this year.
Several Republicans promptly interpreted Eisenhower's remarks
to mean that Nixon can have the nomination if he wants it. Sen.

"Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), a Nix- j
on supporter, said he was "happy" i
because iho President "apparently
is backing Nixon for Vice-Presi
dent."
Nixon said he would have no
immediate comment "as far as my
own personal political situation is
concerned." He made the state
ment after receiving a standing i
ovation at a National Republican :
Women's conference here.
Won't Bo Pushed
Eisenhower told a news confer-!
ence he would not be "pushed into \
corners" and say "right now, at
this moment" whether he would
accept Nixon as a running mate
this fall, if the Vice-President
wants to run again.
"I do say this," the President
declared: "I have no criticism of
Vice-President Nixon to make—
either as a man, an associate or I
as rny running mate on the tick- j
et."
Angrily, Eisenhower added:
"If anyone ever has the ef
frontery to come in and urge me
to dump somebody that I respect
as I do Vice-President Nixon,
there will be more commotion
around my office than you have
noticed yet."
Sen. H. Alexander Smith (R-
N.J.) agreed that Eisenhower's
statement "indicates that Nixon
would be a most acceptable nomi- j
nee." But Smith said the Presi
dent also wanted to make clear he
was not "dictating" to the GOP j
nominating convention.
Question of Health
Eisenhower also said he will in
form the people "instantly" if he
ever finds that his "organic fit
ness" does not allow him to carry i
on important presidential duties.
He said, amid laughter, that ho
was not speaking of a week's at- •
tack of the flu.
That was in reply to a question
as to what he would do if his
health should deteriorate before j
the Republican convention meets I
in August.
