### Jae Hunley 
In the last meeting of winter
quarter last night, ASSU Legisla- i
ture sauntered through an agenda j
of generalities in near â€¢ record j
time.
Among the more important I
items was the question of when 1
Stanford should disaffiliate from
National Student Association, in
keeping with the referendum
passed by the student body last
week.
Legislature decided that NSA
Board should be dissolved, and
j hence Stanford's membership, by
I April 1. They stipulated that in
dividual groups, such as the Hon
or Code and Fundamental Stand- ;
ard committees, could continue
work pertaining to NSA on their
own time and money.
NSA Discussion
This step followed the regular
discussion on NSA conducted by
NSA Co-ordinator Jim Sammet.
The group also began discus
sion of constitutional by-law
changcs in regard to the election
I of head cheerleader and the social
i regulations.
No decision was made, and
i ASSU president George Ralph re
j quested that members take the is
sues back to their constituencies
in order to prepare for further
[discussion when Legislature
meets again at the beginning of
: next quarter,
.
Seminar Retreats
George Abel, business manager j
for the Institute of International
Relations, appeared to explain and
discuss with Legislature a pro
posed "retreat" for student semi
nars.
Abel explained to the group
: that lIR had learned, on private '
initiative, it would be possible to
secure a "Y" camp near Felton, at
the rate of $1.25 a weekend, plus
cost of food, for student discus
sions and seminars.
Legislature, after great discus
| sion over details as to which;
groups would be permitted use of
the facilities, what they would J
discuss and who would lead the !
discussions, gave the project a
sort of quasi-confidence vote.
A further report of Legislature
discussion will be published in to
morrow's edition of The Daily.
