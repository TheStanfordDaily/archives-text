# Arab Summit Conference Warns Israel 'Any Aggression' Will Spur Retaliation
## Diverting River Jordan for Israeli Irrigation, Land Reforms cited as Explosive Issues 
### 
. CAIRO. March 7 (UP) Any diversion of the river Jordan by Israel
for irrigation or land reform projects will constitute aggression and
bring immediate retaliation, government leaders of Egypt, Syria and
Saudi Arabia agreed today.
The decision was reached at the Arab "summit" conference held in

the elaborately• decorated palace
of former King Farouk.
Although the meeting was held
behind closed doors, an Egyptian
official spokesman said its two
main objectives were the promo
tion of Arab security and formu
lation of plans to help Jordan free
itself of British dependence.
United Arab Action
The spokesman said the Arab
"southern tier" leaders tightened
joint defense plans against "any
aggression" by Israel.
He refused to elaborate, but con
ference sources said this referred
to a proposal of the Jewish nation
to divert water from the Jordan
River for irrigation and land recla
mation projects.
The three anti-Baghdad Pact na
tions were committed to joint ac
tion against any "Israeli aggres
sion." This was extended to cover
the entire Arab world today by
King Saud, Egyptian Premier Ga
mal Abdel Nasser and Syrian
President Shukry El Kuwatly.
War "Unavoidable"
Inside sources said the three put
pressure on Jordan, which last
week ousted the British command
er of the Arab Legion, Lt. Gen.
John Bagot Glubb. The "summit"
leaders hoped Jordan would sever
its ties with Britain.
(In Jerusalem, Herut party
leader Menahim Beigin told Unit
that war in the Middle East is "un
avoidable."
< He said Israel's greatest threat
is Communist penetration through
Egypt, and that a military offen
sive opened by Israel is the only i
hope for settlement.
(Beigin was beaten in the Knes
set (parliament) yesterday in his
attempt to force a vote of no con
fidence in the government of Pre
mier David Ben-Gurion. He said
today that Israel must aim for
"deep penetration into enemy
held territory" when war comes.)

tion of Arab security and formu
lation of plans to help Jordan free

The spokesman said the Arab
"southern tier" leaders tightened
joint defense plans against "any
aggression" by Israel.
He refused to elaborate, but con
ference sources said this referred
to a proposal of the Jewish nation
to divert water from the Jordan
River for irrigation and land recla
mation projects.
The three anti-Baghdad Pact na
tions were committed to joint ac
tion against any "Israeli aggres
sion." This was extended to cover
the entire Arab world today by
King Saud, Egyptian Premier Ga
mal Abdel Nasser and Syrian
President Shukry El Kuwatly.
War "Unavoidable"
Inside sources said the three put
pressure on Jordan, which last
week ousted the British command
er of the Arab Legion, Lt. Gen.
John Bagot Glubb. The "summit"
leaders hoped Jordan would sever
its ties with Britain.
