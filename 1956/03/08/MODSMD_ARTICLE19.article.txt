(UP)â€”ltalian President Giovanni
Gronchi arrived in San Francisco
tonight to carry his personal cam
paign for wider Atlantic economic
co-operation into the banking, ag
ricultural and industrial center of
the Western United States.
Here, where many famous Ital
ians have helped mould the mod
ern U.S. West, Gronchi received
one of the warmest receptions yet
arranged for his North American
tour.
After the spontaneous welcome
of San Franciscans and Califor
nians, Gronchi intended to press
forward with his personal con
tacts with leading businessmen to
enlist their support for broader
Italian - American trade and dy
namic new economic policy for
the entire Western world as the
best means to offset the Soviet
Union's economic aid offensive.
