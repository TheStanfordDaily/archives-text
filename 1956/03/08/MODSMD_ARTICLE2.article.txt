# Ike Happy Over Red Reaction
## Door to Visit Left Open by President 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 7 (UP) !
President Eisenhower tod a y |
hailed as "very favorable" Soviet |
Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin's ini-!
tial reaction to the new U.S. di.s-1
armament proposals.
The President also left the door
open to a possible future invita
tion to Bulganin to come here for
a face-to-face meeting if it would >
advance the cause of peace.
The Soviet premier said yestcr-:
day in somewhat joking fashion i
that he would "welcome" an op-1
portunity to go to Washington for
talks. Asked about that at his
news conference, Eisenhower said
he had not considered it as "an
immediate development."
But he added, "We shall be alert
to follow up any opening that I
looks like it would lead to a lessen- 1
ing of the tensions."
The President made plain this
government's surprise and pleas
ure at Bulganin's quick and
friendly response to Eisenhower's
letter proposing new disarma- !
ment methods, including an even
tual ban on atomic weapons pro- i
duetion.
Bulganin told newsmen in Mos
cow he considered the letter "good
and favorable." He said it would
take much study but added he
would reply formally soon.
