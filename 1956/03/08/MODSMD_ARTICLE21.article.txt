# The 						Clank of Doom

### 
Yesterday, tiie San Francisco Chronicle car
ried a story concerning a letter received by the
San Mateo County Board of Supervisors decry
ing the evils of the machine in our society.
W rilten by a gentleman from Redwood City,
the letter bemoaned "the innocent-looking but
demoralizing devices . . . which are threaten
ing to engulf ns all."
He cited the gum machine as the root of all
the evil. Now that we are not too sure about
but we detect the ring of truth in the statement
that we are about to be engulfed.
Where do we get candy? Cigarettes?

Matches? Change? Combs, kleenev and post
cards? No more a smiling face to ask what
you wish—nothing but cold gray machines.
And now science has devised a more hidegus
creature — a singing stamp machine. It takes
your money, gives you a few bits of colored
paper, and then has the audacity to "thank you
very much."
\\ here will this end? We will soon be the
helots of a cold, clanking society with machines
not only gulping our pay checks but dispens
ing them . . . and if anyone has a quarter, we
would like a package of cigarettes.
