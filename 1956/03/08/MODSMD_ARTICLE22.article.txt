## Will Nixon Be Ike's Running Mate? Students Evaluate the Vice-President 
### DAVE SCOTT 
"Do you think Richard Nixon should be Ei
senhower's running mate in the coming Presi
dential campaign?"
Ginger Millei;, '58, Lagunita: "If Ike died,
Nixon would become President. This would be
fatal for our country. Nixon is over-ambitious.
He would try to make great decisions he doesn't
know anything about because he hasn't had the
experience a man in his position needs.
"He'll get us in trouble with the foreign pow
ers because lie's no diplomat. No one will be
behind him, Republican or Democrat.
John DOYLE, '50, foreign student front Eng
land: "I don't regard Nixon as being an asset
to Eisenhower. 1 think his world-circling 'good
will' fours serve very little purpose. The aver
age Englishman would be very unhappy to
think Nixon might some day have to take over
as head of the United States government."
John Upston, '58,0ff-campus: "A coach does
not change an efficient and well-co-ordinated
team; he supports it. In the same spirit the
American people should rally behind the team
of Eisenhower and Nixon.
"In the light of Nixon's experience, record
and President Eisenhower's endorsement of
him, it would be a mistake to make a change in
the Vice-Presidency."
Bob Levin, graduate, off-campus: "Nixon's
running will weaken the Republicans in the
elections. In many people's opinion, there is
more of a possibility in this election of the Vice-
President having to take over in case something
happens to the President.
"Eisenhower's choice will carry a lot of
weight with the delegates, so it looks like Nixon
will be hi- running mate."
Glenn West Jr., '56, ('.rothers Hall: 'With
Nixon i" uing, I don't think Ike would have
the amount of bi-partisan pull he had in the
"52 election. Nixon has made a lot of enemies
in the past few years. From a 'smart politics'
viewpoint, Ik.c would do well to choose another
running mate."
C vy W .ri: 58, Lagunita: "He might be a
good \ ice-I'resident but lie shouldn't run be
cause he doesn t have the strength of character
to command respect from the people. He'd be
a weak President because he wouldn't have the
backing of his party which a strong President

needs."
Jkff Parrisii, '58, Stern: "Because of Presi
dent Eisenhower's poor health and the possi
bility the \ ice-President may be required to fill
the Presidential office, a man of more able lead
ership is needed to replace Nixon.
"Also Nixon has been a constant source of
strife within his own party and certainly would
not contribute to Ike's success in the '56 elee
tion."
Carolyn Carlson, '58, Lagunita: "Nixon has
such an adverse effect on so many of both Re
publican and Democratic voters that lie ill
definitely lose votes for Ike. If Nixon runs, the
Democrats will make him a major campaign
issue along with Ike's illness."
Hay Roberts, MM, Stern: "Nixon's career in
office lias been clouded with controversy. We
need a new man in '56 as Vice-President who
can start with a clean slate and will be a more
objective candidate for the office."
Bonnie Mcllwaine, '58, Lagunita: "Stassen
would be a better running mate for Ike. One
reason is that if it became necessary for the
\ ice-President to take over the Presidency be
cause of Ike's illness, Stassen would be better
equipped to do this because of his greater expe
rience."
Nancy Snookal, 59, Roblc: "I think Nixon
has done an excellent job this term. As long as
there is probability that the Vice-President
would have to take over for Eisenhower, how
ever. 1 don't think Nixon should run because he
is too young and inexperienced for that job."
Robert 1). Adams, graduate, Terman: 'The
President has already decided that, and 1 am
sorry he is sticking with Nixon. Eisenhower's
decision to seek re-election sent the stock mar
ket up several points. Should his heart fail and
Nixon advance to the Presidency during the
next term, certainly that would serve as even
greater impetus for the money lenders; they
will have found a home in the White House.
'Prosperity and peace,' now easily seen through
rose-colored glasses, would appear even rosier
under Nixon. Until there was hell to pay."
Bobbie Phillips, '59, Roblc: "I think he
should run because he appears to he sincere and
competent. None of the other probable candi
dates seem as well suited for the job."
