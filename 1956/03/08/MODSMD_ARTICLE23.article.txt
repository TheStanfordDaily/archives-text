Do We Want NAACP ?
Editor, The Daily:
The rccent meeting of the revitalized Stanford
chapter of the NAACP | National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People | —which I
attended —has clearly raised the question of the
desirability of such an organization on campus.
I shall state at the outset that I approve of the
principles for which this organization stands
(greater political and social justice for (he Ameri
can Negro); I do not approve of, or believe in,
the principles of white supremacy ramp 4 v.?
South today. However, in approving the
principles, I question their methods, particularly
when emanating from the Stanford campus.
Contrary to much wishful thinking among
those dedicated idealists at the meeting, and per
haps contrary even to campus opinion, the
NAACP is not a discussion group it is a po
litical action group.
As was very evident at the meeting, one does
not question the principles of the organization
in discussions; one accepts, and works for, them.
In other words, il is an organization for the pro
tection of minorities which does not tolerate
minorities within itself.
This statement is not a criticism, per se; it
merely points up the fact that the NAACP is a
political action group rather than any sort of a
discussion group.
One can seriously question the desirability,
even the legality (under Mrs. Stanford's will) of
having such a political action group on campus.
Perhaps 'he I. liversity, the Legislature or the

students (by referendum) should answer this.
One can also doubt the merit of having a po
litical action group of this nature on campus.
Their meetings are, in the main part, appeals to
the whites to allow the Negro to exercise his
rights—and appeals to the Negro to go and exer
cise his rights. This is in principle excellent, but,
in so doing, the end result is to make both white
and Negro acutely conscious of his race.
In some areas of this country this appeal to
race has aroused resentment and even race riots
—and riots which did not occur until an agitator
organization, like the NAACP, emphasized race
consciousness while attempting to point out the
injustices therefrom. No excuse can be given for
the race riots, but incitement of these by agita
tors to either race is equally culpable.
Social reforms, even social revolutions, cannot
be achieved by legislation or federal troops. They
can only be achieved by a gradual process of edu
cation and progress. Social revolution (which is
what Ihe South would term the Supreme Court
order ending segregation) breeds social reaction.
Indeed, the violent agitation by some of the
less moderate idealists has led the South to the
belief that it must stand or die—as was the case
in 1861. Granting that the South is wrong in their
beliefs, they too are entitled to minority rights.
From a practical point of view, agitation and
force will not work for integration—it will serve
only to arouse bitterness and stubbornness
against it. Therefore. I would seriously question
the aspect of having radical agitation, such as
the NAACP advocates, coming from our campus.

injustices therefrom. No excuse can be given for
the race riots, but incitement of these by agita
tors to either race is equally culpable.
Social reforms, even social revolutions, cannot
be achieved by legislation or federal troops. They
can only be achieved by a gradual process of edu
cation and progress. Social revolution (which is
what Ihe South would term the Supreme Court
order ending segregation) breeds social reaction.
Indeed, the violent agitation by some of the
less moderate idealists has led the South to the
belief that it must stand or die—as was the case
in 1861. Granting that the South is wrong in their
beliefs, they too are entitled to minority rights.
From a practical point of view, agitation and
force will not work for integration—it will serve
only to arouse bitterness and stubbornness
against it. Therefore. I would seriously question
the aspect of having radical agitation, such as
the NAACP advocates, coming from our campus.

Editor, The Daily:
The rccent meeting of the revitalized Stanford
chapter of the NAACP | National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People | —which I
attended —has clearly raised the question of the
desirability of such an organization on campus.
I shall state at the outset that I approve of the
principles for which this organization stands
(greater political and social justice for (he Ameri
can Negro); I do not approve of, or believe in,
the principles of white supremacy ramp 4 v.?
South today. However, in approving the
principles, I question their methods, particularly
when emanating from the Stanford campus.
Contrary to much wishful thinking among
those dedicated idealists at the meeting, and per
haps contrary even to campus opinion, the
NAACP is not a discussion group it is a po
litical action group.
As was very evident at the meeting, one does
not question the principles of the organization
in discussions; one accepts, and works for, them.
In other words, il is an organization for the pro
tection of minorities which does not tolerate
minorities within itself.
This statement is not a criticism, per se; it
merely points up the fact that the NAACP is a
political action group rather than any sort of a
discussion group.
One can seriously question the desirability,
even the legality (under Mrs. Stanford's will) of
having such a political action group on campus.
Perhaps 'he I. liversity, the Legislature or the

students (by referendum) should answer this.
One can also doubt the merit of having a po
litical action group of this nature on campus.
Their meetings are, in the main part, appeals to
the whites to allow the Negro to exercise his
rights—and appeals to the Negro to go and exer
cise his rights. This is in principle excellent, but,
in so doing, the end result is to make both white
and Negro acutely conscious of his race.
In some areas of this country this appeal to
race has aroused resentment and even race riots
—and riots which did not occur until an agitator
organization, like the NAACP, emphasized race
consciousness while attempting to point out the
injustices therefrom. No excuse can be given for
the race riots, but incitement of these by agita
tors to either race is equally culpable.
Social reforms, even social revolutions, cannot
be achieved by legislation or federal troops. They
can only be achieved by a gradual process of edu
cation and progress. Social revolution (which is

order ending segregation) breeds social reaction.
