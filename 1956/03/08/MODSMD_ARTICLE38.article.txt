# 'WHITE' CHRISTMAS
## Florida State University Poet Hits Segregation with Satire Con Horn Thanks Daily for Sympathy Shown Over 'Lucy' Controversy in Southern States 
### 
Last month The Daily printed
some letters from Flambeau, stu
dent newspaper at Florida State
University at Tallahassee, in
which a student expressed an
opinion "not generally conceived
as one that would issue from the
deep South."
The writer, Con Horn, expressed
his distaste at "white supremacy"
theories among some Southerners
and in a poem showed his disdain
lor the treatment of Autherine
Lucy at the University of Ala
bama.
His poem ended:
I myself would run
the streets of Tuscaloosa with
a gun
and die,
rather than give in to the lie
that passes in the South for
Truth.
Blame it on my youth.
But if Autherine Lucy does
not survive,
why would YOU want to stay
alive?
Horn's opinions were not well
received by some of his fellow
students, but in later issues of the
paper he "stuck to his guns."
Yesterday The Daily received a
letter from Horn, reading in part:
"... I was flattered and over
joyed to see that the West Coast,
which I had previously associated
only with Brubeck, Rumsey, et al.,
not only has an interest in this
Georgia - Mississippi - Alabama
mess, but through some odd quirk
of fate has elevated me to the po
sition of spokesman for the Dis
loyal Opposition. . . .
"I'm enclosing a poem (see be
low | that was published in Flam
beau just prior to the Christmas
vacation exodus, which may have
accounted for the fact that there
were exactly NO replies, pub
lished or in person, a fact which
amazed me and prompted me to
add my 'Lucy' insult to the 'White
Christmas' injury.
". . . 'White Christmas' drew no
reaction at all and that puzzled
and disappointed me, since I'm
only interested in drawing the
hicks out of the bushes and letting
them hang themselves with the
rope of their own illiterate and il
logical tirades. Hence, the 'Lucy'
poem, which did the job quite well.
"You might be interested to
know that a girl at Wesleyan in
Macon, Georgia, of all places, read
'Christmas' as her final exam in
speech and made an 'A,' and that
a professor at the University of
Florida in Gainesville read it to
all of his classes, all of which indi
cates, I think, that there may be
a faint ray of hope here in the
Squalid South for both the 'nigger'
and the 'nigger-lover.'
"I really enjoy writing to you

out there in the dark void, espe
cially inasmuch as I don't know
who or how many, but anyway
thanks once again for the sympa
thetic attention and the excellent
re-hashing of the 'Lucy' contro
versy here at State.
