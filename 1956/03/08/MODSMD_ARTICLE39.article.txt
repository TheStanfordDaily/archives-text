# DREAMING OF A "WHITE" CHRISTMAS
## 
### Con Horn 
Peace on earth, good will to
ward men;
it's almost Christmas time
again.
I know
there isn't any snow,
but who cares? As long as the
sun is out
you can't say one is out
of luck because he's in the
South
at Christmas time. Why shut
mah mouth,
it's just as bright
and clean and fine down here,
all sweetness and light.

"And brother we aims to keep
it just that way you
hear?
Suppose some damnfool nig
ger boy DID disappear
in Mississippi? What was his
name . . .
Till? Well, just the same,
I ain't worryin' about it none,
and I'd advise
you to forget it too. Eyes
is useful, provided they see
the right things.
So watch out what you see or
some night things
will start to happen 'round
YOUR house. Keep
your nose in close if you want
to enjoy your sleep."
How about a Christmas hymn
for Sheriff Windy Mc-
Call?
Sing hallelujah in a Southern
drawl.
Quick on the trigger, with a
deadly aim, just like
the old-time sheriffs. Deadly.
He must like
to shoot first and ask ques
tions later;
one thing sure—there's not a
yardman, shoeshine boy
or waiter,
or any other member of the
Negro race above five
years of age who does
n't know his place
in sweet Mt. Dorui.
Hell, what's a nigger mora
less if we can make that clear?
And a happy new year.

I'm catching on. You've got to
learn
to overlook some things. Don't
let them turn
your stomach. Enjoy the
beach, the sunshine,
the warm breeze. What dif
ference does one shine
dead or alive make in the
indefinite scheme of
things?
Forget it. Dream of things
to come—a clean pure happy
land for white folks.
That's right, folks,
it's Christmas time.
Give a dime
to the garbage man and shut
the door,
avoid his face. He'll be drunk
before
the night is through.
They're all the same. By God,
there's one damn thing
we've got to do.
Even though
There's not snow
let's make sure it's always a
"white" Christmas.
