# Marines to Be Stationed In Mediterranean
## U.S. Considers Move To Counter Threat Of Arab-Israel War 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 7 (UP)
The Defense Department today
ordered a battalion of Marines
to the Mediterranean. Diplomats
called it a move to show U.S. de
termination to prevent full-scale
war in the Middle East.
At the same time, it was learned
the United States is considering a
new move in the United Nations
to counter the growing danger of
an Arab-Israel war.
This disclosure followed a news
conference statement by Presi
dent Eisenhower that this country
has "constantly restated our posi
tion that we believe that the Unit
ed Nations should take urgent and
early action" to avert a Middle
Eastern war.
Xo Decision Yet
Highly - placed informants said
no decision has been reached yet
on whether some new form of UN
intervention should be sought, and
if so, in what manner. The ques
tion is presumably being dis
cussed with this country's close
allies, particularly Britain and j
France.
The Marine battalion will sail!
about the middle of the month to
join the U.S. Sixth Fleet. Marines
are traditionally used to display
American military power over-1
seas.
There also lias been speculation j
the fleet itself may stage a show
ol' strength in an effort to halt any
warlike moves by either Israel or
the Arab states.
UN Armistice Terms
The President said both Jews
and Arabs should agree to abide
by the UN's armistice terms and
avoid touching off "incidents" so
"we could get peace started."
At the same time, Eisenhower
gave Israel no encouragement on
an early "yes" answer to its re
quest for arms. He said arms
alone will not assure peace since
Israel is vastly outnumbered by I
the Arab states.
The President also emphasized.
that the U.S. decision to let Saudi!
Arabia buy IS light tanks and aux-1
iliary equipment was made last j
June.
