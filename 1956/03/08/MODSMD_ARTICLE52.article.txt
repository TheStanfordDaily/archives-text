# Weiershauser Foresees Strong Team and Rugged Competition
## Coach Welcomes Sixteen Lettermen faced by Champs Herrmann, Nelson Several Sophomore Prospects Will Compete, Including Graves, Johnson, Cobb, Williamson 
### Dave Canfield 
With 1G lettermen, 10 outstanding 1953 freshmen and newcomers
and two 1955 Pacific Coast Conference champions returning, Track
Coach Jack Weiershauser still is not optimistic.
"We'll have good meets against Cal and other teams," reflected
the former Stanford hurdle star, "but the less said about USC and

UCLA the better.
"USC is in a class by itself and
UCLA is right behind," said Wei
ershauser as he took time out
from readying his thinclads for
their first meet —at Fresno State
March 24.
Leading the Cards this year are
Frank Herrmann, last year's PCC
broad- jump champ, and Bernie
Nelson, 1955 conference high-hur
dles winner.
"Other outstanding men," said
Weiershauser, "are Phil Fehlen in
the high .jump, Bill Flint in the
pole vault and Hank Roldan, who
will go over 220 in the javelin."
Spear Throwers
The Indians boast four men
who can heave a javelin over 200
feet namely, Roldan, sophomore
H u g h Johnson, newcomer Jim
Stewart and Kirk Nieland, an
ot her newcomer.
"It's an unusually good javelin
team," declared the track coach.
"However, in practically all the
dual meets in the past five or six
years we've swept the javelin."
Commenting on other outstand
ing prospects, Coach Weiershau
ser predicted, "Maury Graves
should run a 9:10 two-mile."
Graves, on last year's frosh
team, reeled off a 4:20 mile and a
9:34 two-mile.
Chuck Cobb, another sopho
more, Weiershauser thinks will
skim over the high hurdles in 14
Hat. Cobb's best times last spring
were 14.G in the high hurdles and
24.2 in the low hurdles.
Weiershauser took another look
into his crystal ball and predicted
Chuck Hinze, quarter-miler, will
race around the track in 47 flat.
Hinze did not compete last year
because of an injury.
Weight Men
In the weight events one of
Weiershauser's most promising
thinclads is Ray Williamson.
Last year Williamson smashed
Bob Mathias' freshman shot-put
mark with a heave of 49 ft. 9',4 in.
Beside Herrmann. Nelson. Feh
lin, Flint and Roldan, returning
lettermen are Jim Saras, sprints;
Ford Sims. 880-yard run; Chuck
Strong, mile and two-mile; Jim
Luttrell, high and low hurdles; A1
Cheney, shot put; Jim Truher, dis
cus; football player John Stewart,
high pump; Ed Fremouw and Jim
Sebolt, broad jump; and Jim East
er and Bob Hyde, mile relay.
Soph Sensations
Two sophomores Weiershauser
rates as "good prospects" are Don
Richardson, half-mile, and Kent
Hansen, another javelin thrower.
Adding two more names to his
impressive list of talented per
formers, the track mentor said,
"Dave Easley, who wasn't in
school last year, looks very good
in sprints, and Jim Peters, a
transfer student, looks good in the
discus."
Despite such a seemingly ex
perienced and talent-laden squad,
Weiershauser, like all coaches, is
quick to point out any drawbacks.
"We don't have many entries in
the running events," admitted the
dark-haired track coach. Then he
handed the reporter a list of SC,
UCLA and Occidental cindermen's
best performances to date and re

marked, "Here's why we can't do
well."
Southern Cal's track factory,
for example, has turned out two
100-yard-dash men, Dick Dorsey
and Pat Coyle, who have flicked
off their event in 9.G. Not to be
outdone, the Westwood tracksters
boast a possible four-minute miler
in Bob Seaman.*
Seaman has toured the mile in
4:01.4. Maybe Coach Weiershau
ser has a right to be pessimistic. J


DEFENDING PCC CHAMP Frank Hermann will lead Card broad
jumpers during the coming season. The junior walked off with top
honors at last year's Pacific Coast Conference championships in
addition to winning his event in the majority of Stanford's dual
meets, ( oach Weiershauser expects great things of Hermann this
