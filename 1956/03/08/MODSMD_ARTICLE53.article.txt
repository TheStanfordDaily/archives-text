# Santee Case Denounced By Mrs. Thorpe

### 
LOS ANGELES, March 7 (UP)
â€” Big Jim Thorpe's widow called
for a better break today for Wes
Santee than the famed Indian ath
lete received when he was banned
as a professional for taking $50 a
month to live on.
Mrs. Thorpe pleaded with fair
thinking people to save Santee
from the fate that befell Thorpe.
The Carlisle Indian Institute ath
lete was placed under a lifetime
ban as an amateur for playing
semi-professional baseball.
"Let's do away with the AAU
and amateurism completely." Mrs.
Thorpe proposed. "The AAU is
making hypocrites, chiselers and
bums out of our athletes, forcing
them to take money that isn't al
lowed in order to live."
Turning to the case of her late
husband, Mrs. Thorpe declared
"the injustice they did to my hus
band ruined his life. He was
crushed by the AAU when ho
didn't even have enough money
to eat on.
"Let's have athletes, not ama
teurs. The parasitic AAU is a
racket. It's a monopoly on human
beings."
Mrs. Thorpe said that from her
reading of the Santee case she
felt the Kansas miler was a credit
to the nation and should be hon
ored instead of permitting the
AAU to ban him from competi
tion.
