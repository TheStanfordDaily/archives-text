# John Young asks:
## How does research differ from development work at Du Pont? John Aaron answers: 
### 
Well . .Tolin, it's hard to define the difference in a way that
will satisfy everybody, because one always finds a lot of over
lapping between research and development work, lint most
people agree that, there are differences, espeeially in time se
quence. Research work comes first, because one of it s main ob
jectives is to establish or discover new scientific facts that will
supply the foundation for new industrial developments. In
oilier words, research men seek new knowledge about mat
ter, generally working with small quantities of il.
Development work comes later, and l)n Pont has two main
types. First, there is new prorata development. Here scientists
and engineers modify, streamline, and augment (lie findings
of research so that new chemical products can be profitably
made on a large scale—or existing products can be made by
newer and more efficient methods. Pilot-plant and semi-works
operations arc usually included under this heading.
Second, an important kind of development w ork is directed
toward improvement of existing promises and products. Here
the men study how to obtain yield increases, utilize by-prod
ucts, increase outputs, and solve sales service problems as they
arise. This may require considerable research, and that brings
us back to the overlapping I previously mentioned.
There are genuine differences, John, but a good deal of
similarity, too—especially in the constant need for imagination
and creative effort. I think you'll find that research and de
velopment work arc equally challenging and rewarding at
Du Pont.

John E. Young is working toward his B.S. in chemistry from Cali
fornia Institute of Technology thi* June. He has maintained honor
standing in classwork while serving on the school newspaper, in the
debating society, and as treasurer of the student body. John is in
terested iu chemical research and development.


John B.Aaron worked for I>u Pont as a summer
laboratory nssi.stn.nt even before lie graduated from
Princeton with a U.S. in 1940. After military service he
obtained nn M.S.Ch.K. from M.I.T. and returned to
1 >u Pont in 10 V7. Over the years he has had many oppor
tunities to observe I)ti Pont research and development
work. Today John is process and methods supervisor at
the Philadelphia Plant of l)u Punt's Fabrics and Fin
ishes Department.
