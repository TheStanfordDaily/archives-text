# Stanford Ruggers Face Bears In Saturday's Home Engagement
## Both reams to Test Their Undefeated Records; Spare, Atkinson May Miss Tilt 
### KERMIT OLSON 
This Saturday afternoon. Stanford and Cal will renew their rivalry
on the rugby turf in a contest which promises to be, as with all meet
ings between the two schools, another "natural."
Both squads post records unmarred by defeat coming into th's game,

which between the years 1906 and 1
thrills for the Bay Area. The In
dians have won five games along
with ties in meetings with UCLA
and t he Olympic Club.
Cul has been victorious through
out its slate, including success
against the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver consid
ered by many as the hotbed of
North American rugby.
Cal will be expected to sport a
very fast, aggressive scrum,
which is tantamount to the line in
American football. Heading their
list of forwards is Don Gilkey, a
rough customer in last fall's Big
Game.
Herb Jackson will be lending
his speed to a well balanced back
lield, and Noel Bowden. a New
Xealander for whom the Berkeley
publicity department has exhaust
ed its supply of expletives, does
the kicking.
Card coach Pete Kmetovic feels
that the Indians will need to be
at their best to come off the field
with this one.
Bob Long and Bob Spare re
main the tvM» most severe casual
ties on the squad, being definitely
out of this weekend's encounter.
Some consternation, however, has
been caused by Gordy Young's
twisted ankle and Dorsey Atkin
son's pulled leg muscle.
The cautiously optimistic coach
did, however, list his starters with
these injuries in mind. Dick Borda
will open at hook, and Donn Cars
well and Noel Robinson are in the
front row. Carswell is considered
by his coach as the toughest man
in his position on the coast.
Playing in the second row will
be Mark Howel! and Paul Wiggin.
Paul, out this year for the first
time, lias made a remarkable
transition from football to rugby.
Dick Jones will be at lock, with

91J served to provide the Big Game
I Pete Maeken and Gordy Rice at
the breakaways.
Behind this unit Vince Jones
1 will he at scrum half, a position
similar in function to the "split
,T" quarterback. Vince's job will
be to receive the ball from the
scrum and pitch it out to the other
' backs.
Gorcly Young and four-year par
ticipant Scott Jones will be at the
! five-eighths; Jack Taylor will per
form at the three-fourths, and
Dorsey Atkinson and Mike Raf
) tery find themselves in the wing
positions. This group of five com
pares to the American halfback.
A 1 Kirkland is fullback, whose
| operations approximate the de
fensive safety in the grid game.
Atkinson has led the team in
: scoring and probably has improv
■ed more than any other single
player. He now can kick ambi
dextrously and couples this with
a mystifying gait which has al
lowed him to score several tries.
A 1 Kirkland's defensive kicking
I has been remarkable considering
\ this is his first year in the full
j back position.

This Saturday afternoon. Stanford and Cal will renew their rivalry
on the rugby turf in a contest which promises to be, as with all meet
ings between the two schools, another "natural."
Both squads post records unmarred by defeat coming into th's game,

which between the years 1906 and 1
thrills for the Bay Area. The In
dians have won five games along
with ties in meetings with UCLA
and t he Olympic Club.
Cul has been victorious through
out its slate, including success
against the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver consid
ered by many as the hotbed of
North American rugby.
Cal will be expected to sport a
very fast, aggressive scrum,
which is tantamount to the line in
American football. Heading their
list of forwards is Don Gilkey, a
rough customer in last fall's Big
Game.
Herb Jackson will be lending
his speed to a well balanced back
lield, and Noel Bowden. a New
Xealander for whom the Berkeley
publicity department has exhaust
ed its supply of expletives, does
the kicking.
Card coach Pete Kmetovic feels
that the Indians will need to be
at their best to come off the field
with this one.
Bob Long and Bob Spare re
main the tvM» most severe casual
ties on the squad, being definitely
out of this weekend's encounter.
Some consternation, however, has
been caused by Gordy Young's
twisted ankle and Dorsey Atkin
son's pulled leg muscle.
The cautiously optimistic coach
did, however, list his starters with
these injuries in mind. Dick Borda
will open at hook, and Donn Cars
well and Noel Robinson are in the
front row. Carswell is considered
by his coach as the toughest man
in his position on the coast.
Playing in the second row will
be Mark Howel! and Paul Wiggin.
Paul, out this year for the first
