Card swim boss Tom Haynie
yesterday pronounced his water
men "ready" to take on all comers
in the forthcoming national cham
pionships at Yale this month.
Culminating his program with
in over-all intensive drive center
ing about diet, sleep and water
conditioning, the mentor revealed
that this yemr's traveling team is
"the best ever."
Traveling to Yale will be ace
sprinters "Jaguar" Moore and
Doug Ackerman, backstroker Ron
Grunt, distance artist Tad Devine
breaststroker Cole Wilbur and
ieam captain Carver Nixon.
In addition, an alternate of ei
ther Tom Burton or Phil Gay will
be taken along for the four-man
relay event.
"Cole Wilbur is a virtual cinch
to win firs J place and break exist
ing wo.ld's records in the 200-
yard hreaststroke," Haynie said.
"By streamlining like a tuna, un
der the surface, he's completely
ievolutionized hreaststroke swim
rning in the short span of a few
months."
Also having excellent chances
at a national championship will be
Robin Moore. Doug Ackerman
and Ron Grunt, whose adjusted
time in the medley relay tops by
three seconds any competitive
performance in the nation this
season.
"Of course, three seconds is
nothing when you compare them
to Wilbur," Haynie continued.
"His time is eight seconds faster
than the nearest competitor and
four seconds under the world's
record. We hope to make this
time official in the Kullerton meet
tomorrow."
At New Haven the team will
lace the defending champions.

Card swim boss Tom Haynie
yesterday pronounced his water
men "ready" to take on all comers
in the forthcoming national cham
pionships at Yale this month.
Culminating his program with
in over-all intensive drive center
ing about diet, sleep and water
conditioning, the mentor revealed
that this yemr's traveling team is
"the best ever."
Traveling to Yale will be ace
sprinters "Jaguar" Moore and
Doug Ackerman, backstroker Ron
Grunt, distance artist Tad Devine
breaststroker Cole Wilbur and
ieam captain Carver Nixon.
In addition, an alternate of ei
ther Tom Burton or Phil Gay will
be taken along for the four-man
relay event.
"Cole Wilbur is a virtual cinch
to win firs J place and break exist
ing wo.ld's records in the 200-
yard hreaststroke," Haynie said.
"By streamlining like a tuna, un
der the surface, he's completely
ievolutionized hreaststroke swim
rning in the short span of a few
months."
Also having excellent chances
at a national championship will be
Robin Moore. Doug Ackerman
and Ron Grunt, whose adjusted
time in the medley relay tops by
three seconds any competitive
performance in the nation this
season.
"Of course, three seconds is
nothing when you compare them
to Wilbur," Haynie continued.
"His time is eight seconds faster
than the nearest competitor and
four seconds under the world's
record. We hope to make this
time official in the Kullerton meet
tomorrow."
At New Haven the team will
lace the defending champions.
