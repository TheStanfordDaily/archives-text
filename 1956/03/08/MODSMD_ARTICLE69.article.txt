# THE 						ROSE TATTOO'
## Anna Magnani Shows Casual Manner. Interpretive Skill Magnani Plays Moody, Grief-Stricken Widow In Movie Based on Tennessee Williams' Play 
### Stew Toy 
Tennessee Williams' "The Rose Tattoo" scratches through a Si
cilian widow's abiding but skin-deep grief and proves that flesh and
blood are thicker than rose petals.
Williams wrote the Broadway play-turned-movie for the movie ver
sion's star, italnjn actress Anna Magnani. Without Miss Magnani

i ner uncertainty of her English
projecting ability kept her out of
the Broadway production) it is
hard to believe that the play could
exist.
Miss Magnani IS the play. Her
truly unbelievable casual manner
and interpretive skill make her
acting more than merely a good
performance. With ker, "The Rose
Tattoo" becomes in itself a candid
and vital entity.
The movie's scene is the Italian
section of a Louisiana town. Sera
phine Delia Rose (Miss Magnani)
loses her banana-hauling husband
through an accident and for three
years subsists solely on his mem
ory.
World Shatters
But her morbid, rose-colored
world begins to shatter wh en
someone intimates her husband's
faithlessness.
She then tries to find out the
truth of the matter bv mauling
her priest to give up her hus
band's confessional secrets (he
won't give in > and finally by mak
ing a remarkable journey to the
Mardi Gras Club, where the of
fending girl friend works as a
blackjack dealer.
With the horrid truth out, Sera
phine's life is ruined. But along
comes the village idiot. Burt Lan
r ister, 1(i sot the widow right on
a few tilings.
Love Mustn't Die
Lancaster's main comment is
that love is what makes the world
go 'round and that it must not die.
After a series of varyingly poig
ant and hilarious incidents, Sera
phine is convinced.
Lancaster's idiotic bungling is
sufficiently inept, but he is inevit
ably "overshadowed by Miss Mag
nani's fine acting.
For a time it isn't quite clear
whether the movie will end in
stark tragedy or in good-natured
comedy, due to the amazing skill
of Miss Magnani's alternate jocu
larity and brooding.
Either ending could doubtless
have been done well. The play is
a sensitive, compassionate and
realistic vehicle for Miss Mag
nani's tremendous talents.
