### 
The Stanford Players' production of the Jerome Moross-John La
touehe musical, "The Golden Apple," opens tonight in Memorial Audi
torium at 8:15. A few tickets, at $1 and $1.50, are still available.
The current production, which runs through Saturday, is the show's
first performance on the West Coast. During its Now York run it was

voted by the Now York Drama
Critics Circle the best musical of j
the season.
"The Golden Apple" tells the!
stories of Paris and Helen and I
Ulysses and Penelope as theyl
might have happened in the turn
oft he-century United States.
Ulysses' quest "for a stable set J
of values" is told—co-author La-j
louche has written not in terms
of Homeric grandeurs, but as a j
"comic reflection of classical in- j
fluence on the way we think now- j
adays. Any myths we might use'
arise out of our native songs,
dances, jokes and ideas."
Modern Roles
Ulysses thus becomes a Spanish
American War veteran, Paris a
traveling salesman and Helen the
farmer's daughter, with Minerva,
Juno and Aphrodite converted in
to small-town clubwomen.
When Paris flies off (in a bal
loon) with the all-too-willing Hel-J
en, Ulysses and his men row down i
Ihe river to Rhododendron to get ,
her back.
15lit, once there, mayor Hector
conducts them on an Odyssean j
spree in which hula-girl sirens I
tempt them with sex, Madam Ca-1
Ivpso (the "nympho megalo ego j
dipso mania*") with social posi
tion, the merciless' Circe with the
promise of power.
