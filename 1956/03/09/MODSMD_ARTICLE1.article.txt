II Ihe United Stales doesn t support Israel with more arms there
will he no war in the Middle East," Egyptian editor Moussa Sabry
Kamcl said yesterday during a visit to Hoover Library.
Kamel is deputy editor of the Cairo daily newspaper Al Akhbar, and
is editor-in-chief of a weekly magazine, Al Guil Al Guidid.

"It is. a fact that Israel with a
population of 1 '/•> million is more
powerful in armaments than the
Arab states with a population of
40 million," Kamel continued.
"That is why Egypt got arms from
Czechoslovakia, just to protect the
borders of the country from any
attack.
"Egypt doesn't want war. We
have a lot of problems inside the
country to be solved —we don't
i want to waste money and time in
any aggressive war."
Nasser's Reforms
Speaking of Premier Nasser's
reforms, Kamel said Nasser first
fought government corruption
j and is now concentrating on
j changing Egypt's economy from
j primarily agricultural to indus
trial.
"We don't want to depend on
agriculture, so we are encourag
ing foreign capitalists to work in
j side Egypt," he said. Foreign cap
j ital used in Egypt won't be taxable
for 10 years.
Regarding Egypt's refusal to
| join the British - sponsored Bagh
! dad Pact, Kamel said Egypt would
not join because she didn't want to
! deal again with British troops.
British Occupation
j "We suffered very much from
j British occupation of Egypt," he
said. "Then the revolution sue
! ceeded in removing British troops;
jit wouldn't lie logical after the
withdrawal to join any military
pact with the British.
"We want to have our self-de
fense against the Eastern Bloc,
but we want the Western Bloc to
help us without influencing our
internal position."
Kamel noticed several American
characteristics that impressed him
I greatly. Among them, lie included
strong religious influence, respect
I for freedom of the individual, "the
way an American wife co-operates
I with her husband in building a
happy family" and "95 per cent of
the girls in American universities
are very beautiful."
Alabama Riots
Kamel was in the United States
at the time of the University of
Alabama riots against Negro stu
! dent Autherine Lucy. He is in
terested in the problem of the Ne
gro's position in the United Sthtes.
"This problem will solve itself
i in time." he suggested. "There is
no problem of this type in most
American universities. The posi
tion of Negroes is always improv
ing now it is much better than
it was 10 year's ago, and 10 yours
j ago it was much better than 10
j years before that."
