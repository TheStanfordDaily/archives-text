# Cast of ‘The Golden Apple' Performs Melodic Musical in Engaging Manner
## 
### Terry Comito 
"The Golden Apple" is one of
those rarities, a musical whose
substance is as solid as its sur
face is gay, witty and melodic.
Although the current Stanford
Players' production does better
with the froth than with the body,
it still makes for a completely en
gaging show, and even a little
more besides.

Latouche's lyrics arc fresh, oft
en pointed and almost always gen
uinely clever. Jerome Moross' mu
sic can be raucous, but, more un
usual, its serious moments are
honestly poignant without saccha
rine.
Visually and vocally — though
she could use more volume -Mar
ilyn Poppino makes a personable
Helen, slithering with sheer and
cynical sex. and dancer William
Davis as Paris is fluid but main
tains constant control and anima
tion.
It is likewise the precision and
projection of a confident voice and
stage presence that makes Ray
Hammet's Hector a breath of
fresh air in a show which, gener
ally speaking, lacks focus, lacks
sharp movement.
This difficulty is accentuated by
Fred Cone as Ulysses who, despite
a light but very pleasing voice, is
unable to put forth more than
a token characterization, which
reaches its climax In the episodic
second act when the continuity is
finally lost in the hurly-burly of
admittedly clever production num
bers.

The chorus, however, is an au
dible one, Roberta Grant as Pe
nelope has two or three genuinely
moving songs, the orchestra under
Kirke Mechem performs well, and
(he whole show .is handsomely
mounted by designer William Al
lison. To ask for more of "The
Golden Apple" is not to deny that
what one gets is plenty for an un
commonly entertaining evening.


"THIS GOLDEN APPLE" opened last night at
Memorial Auditorium. The Stanford Players'
production stars Frederick C'one as Ulysses

(above) who is on his way to rescue Helen. The
play runs through tomorrow night.—Daily photo
