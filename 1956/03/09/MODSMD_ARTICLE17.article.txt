### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
Three starting seniors give
their farewell appearances to
Stanford basketball tomorrow aft
ernoon at 2 in the Pavilion when
the Indian cagers face California.
Captain George Selleck, high
raping Barry Brown and steady
Bill Flanders will be seeing action

time tomorrow.
The Bear and Indian quintets
collide tonight at 8 in the Berke
ley gymnasium in their series
opener.
Only one of the California start
ers will be lost due to graduation
this year. He is co-captain Bob
Blake, a steady 6-2 forward who
sparkles on both offense and. de
fense.
Protect Win Streak
Stanford will be protecting a
five-game winning streak against
Cal when they open the series to
night. Ron Tomsic, Selleck and
Russ Lawler paced the Tribe to
four consecutive victories over the
East Bay outfit last year.
Stanford's skein goes back to
the closing night of the 1954 sea
son when the Tribe ended Nibs
Price's cage coaching career at
Cal in defeat.
The Bears, now in second place
behind undefeated UCLA, will
need two victories over Stanford
to close the season in undisputed
second. Cal has a 10-4 record while
Washington concluded its season
last week with an 11-5 mark.
Cal Lineup
Joining Blake, the ninth leading
scorer in the PCC, in Cal's start
ing lineup will be forward Larry
Friend, center Duane Asplund and
sophomore guards Earl Robinson
and Bernie Simpson.
Veterans Mike Diaz and Gabe
Arrillaga have rotated with the
starting pair at guard this year.
The deep Bears also have Joe
Hagler to spell Asplund at center
and 6-3 Bert Mastrov to fill in at
forward.
Selleck, Brown and Flanders
will be joined by Bill Bond and
Hap Wagner in Stanford's start
ing five. Selleck and Bond rank
high in PCC scoring. The hustling
Utile captain has averaged 16.S
points a game against conference
opposition for the fifth place, and
Bond is seventh with a 16-poinl
average.
Big Three
While Stanford will be paced by
its Big Three of Selleck, Bond and
Brown, Cal is likely to spread its
scoring around among more of its
players. Although having no one
star, the Bears claim a deep, well
balanced quintet.
The Berkeley outfit has a defi
nite height advantage on the
Tribe. Paced by rebounders As
plund at 6-8, Hagler at 6-7, Friend
at 6-4 and 6-2 Blake, the Cal start
ing five will average 6-3.
The Card quintet averages
slightly over 6 feet.
If Stanford should sweep the
series, the Tribe would end the
season in a tie for thrid place.

the closing night of the 1954 sea
son when the Tribe ended Nibs
Price's cage coaching career at
Cal in defeat.
The Bears, now in second place
behind undefeated UCLA, will
need two victories over Stanford
to close the season in undisputed
second. Cal has a 10-4 record while
Washington concluded its season
last week with an 11-5 mark.
Cal Lineup
Joining Blake, the ninth leading
scorer in the PCC, in Cal's start
ing lineup will be forward Larry
Friend, center Duane Asplund and
sophomore guards Earl Robinson
and Bernie Simpson.
Veterans Mike Diaz and Gabe
Arrillaga have rotated with the
starting pair at guard this year.
The deep Bears also have Joe
Hagler to spell Asplund at center
and 6-3 Bert Mastrov to fill in at
forward.
Selleck, Brown and Flanders
will be joined by Bill Bond and
Hap Wagner in Stanford's start
ing five. Selleck and Bond rank
high in PCC scoring. The hustling
Utile captain has averaged 16.S
points a game against conference
opposition for the fifth place, and
Bond is seventh with a 16-poinl
average.
Big Three
While Stanford will be paced by
its Big Three of Selleck, Bond and
Brown, Cal is likely to spread its
scoring around among more of its
players. Although having no one
star, the Bears claim a deep, well
balanced quintet.
The Berkeley outfit has a defi
nite height advantage on the
Tribe. Paced by rebounders As
plund at 6-8, Hagler at 6-7, Friend
at 6-4 and 6-2 Blake, the Cal start
ing five will average 6-3.
The Card quintet averages
slightly over 6 feet.
If Stanford should sweep the
series, the Tribe would end the
season in a tie for thrid place.
Three starting seniors give
their farewell appearances to
Stanford basketball tomorrow aft
ernoon at 2 in the Pavilion when
the Indian cagers face California.
Captain George Selleck, high
raping Barry Brown and steady
Bill Flanders will be seeing action
in Tribe uniforms for the last
time tomorrow.
The Bear and Indian quintets
collide tonight at 8 in the Berke
ley gymnasium in their series
opener.
Only one of the California start
ers will be lost due to graduation
this year. He is co-captain Bob
Blake, a steady 6-2 forward who
sparkles on both offense and. de
fense.
Protect Win Streak
Stanford will be protecting a
five-game winning streak against
Cal when they open the series to
night. Ron Tomsic, Selleck and
Russ Lawler paced the Tribe to
four consecutive victories over the
East Bay outfit last year.
