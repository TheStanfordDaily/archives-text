# The
						Best Little Man
## 
### 
Till BIST LITTi.F. mail iii basketball will make
his final appearance on llie well-polished hard
woods ol' Stanford Pavilion tomorrow after
noon.
He's George Selleek. You can spot him easily.
He'll be the man on the loose ball, nine times
out of ten. He'll be the one harassing a player
twice lii.H size and stealing the ball at ever) op
port unity.
He'll lead the Indian eagers down the floor,
m iting up plays like a captain and executing
them like a general.
Dribbling through the defense lil. jit didn't
e.\ist, Selleek will give a deft touch to the ball,
balance himself with a protruding forearm and
fake into position for a ewisher.
Or he'll pass off to a teammate behind his
back and drive off to a strategic spot to hawk

the hall down on the rebound if it doesn't con
nect with the net.
You won't see the 5-foot 8-inch "Mighty
Mouse"" committing ver\ many fouls; he plays
ihe game clean.
Tomorrow will mark llie end of the four-year
career of Selleek. It will also mark the end of
a better-than-average Stanford basketball sea
son.
Seniors Barry Brown, Bill Flanders, Ron
Wagner, Carlos Bea and Dave Dunn will also be
closing out their cage careers against Cal.
W helher in victory or defeat, captain George
and his lieutenants have played the fighting
game against tall teams and tall odds.
We salute the 1956 basketball team, its cap
tain and its coach for a job well done in the true
Stanford spirit.
