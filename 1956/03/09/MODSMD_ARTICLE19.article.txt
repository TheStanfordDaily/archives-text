An article in Monday's Daily concerning the
remodeling of a Branner driveway by Wilbur
freshmen put the University administration in
a

The article started: "Junipero II took things
into their own hands Saturday and did what the
University officials refused to do. They gave
Branner Hall a second driveway."
In a press conference with University Busi
ness Manager Alf E. Brandin last Monday after
noon, it was brought out that the area which
includes the driveway is to be landscaped in the
112 uture.
"It was never intended to be a driveway,"
Brandin answered. He indicated that the article
implied that the business office didn't know
what, it was doing.
Brandin brought out landscape drawings to
show what the Toyon-Branner area will look
like in the future. The oval driveway will
be eliminated and landscaped. This has been
planned since last November.
The oval in front of Toyon will also be elimi
nated for the same reason. Additional parking
lots will be located to the right of Branner as
well as in the rear of Toyon.
The business manager indicated that the work
done by the freshmen will not be removed until
the landscaping begins or until a rain washes it
away.
Brandin also said he had received calls con
cerning an editorial which appeared on the
same day entitled "Do You Hear Bells?"
The editorial pointed out that the bells in the
clock lower ring for minutes every Wednesday
evening at 9:30 for the Candlelight Service.
Brandin said he knew no reasons why they
should ring for long periods either.
Do you hear bells?
