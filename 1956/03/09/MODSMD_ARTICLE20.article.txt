## KZSU Survey 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I don't in any way question Davo Canfield's
methods of gathering and compiling his data for
Wednesday's article on KZSU. But I do question
his interpret iion and the obvious slant given to
the matter of "only 40 per cent of Stanford stu
dents listen to the campus radio station, KZSU"
(front page).
The statement of the simple fact "40 percent" is
above reproach, but it appears to me that the judg
ment, "only," suffers from being squeezed into a
highly distorted frame of reference.
Professional radio broadcasters are painfully
aware of the fierce competition for listeners
among the many stations of the San Francisco
Bay region. In fact, any one of the operators
would be wildly ecstatic over the thought that 40
per cent of aH the people in the area of coverage
even so much as know his station exists.
Mr. Stratton of KEAR, the classical music sta
tion in San Francisco, informs me that the station
has recently completed a listener survey. The in
dications are that KEAR has an audience of ap
proximately 260,000 persons.
When compared to the total population in the
Bay Area (about three million, conservatively)
these listeners represent a very small percentage,
by any stretch of the imagination.
Yet regular daily broadcasts are significant evi
dences that this 8.3 per cent rate is to someone,
the sponsors "-d operators, sufficient to justify
the existence of the station.
In another rase, KPFA in Berkeley (a listener
sponsored station, and therefore not directly rep
resentative of broadcasters in general, but one for
which some figures are available) is pushing for
about 10,000 subscribers.
Only 10,000 people in an area the size of San
Francisco! I'm sure this station, too, would be de
lirious with joy if it could claim 40 per cent of the
listeners even in Palo Alto.
The listener rate for most radio stations is
small, and this is simply a result of the mathe
matical and human improbability that there ever

will be great throngs all listening eagerly at their
loudspeakers at any one time. Broadcasters ac
cept this situation as a fact of life.
In any event, it seems to me that rather than
deliver the inferred judgment that KZSU should
render Stanford at least 99 per cent captive, The
Daily might have been more realistic to greet the
existing 40 per cent with wild enthusiasm.

Editor's Note: We are sorVy for the errone
ous use of "only," by which we did not mean to
imply any criticism of KZSU. On the contrary,
we have always considered IvZSU one of the
best college radio stations in operation, and used
the survey to find out if others on the campus
agree.
A 40 per cent audience does seem to imply
that many students agree with us.
Name Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the controversy which appears to pre
vail on this campus with regard to certain letters
written to The Daily by Mr. David G. Cromwell on
the question of racial segregation in the schools
of the South, I should like to call attention to the
fact that there are two students having this last
name at Stanford and that the views so recently
and publicly expressed by one of them, Mr. David
G. Cromwell, do not in any way reflect those of
the other, Mr. Richard S. Cromwell, who is the
writer of this letter.
I am prompted thus to stress this divergence of
opinion between Mr. David G. Cromwell and my
self partly in order, by calling attention to it, to
put a stop to my being repeatedly mistaken for
him and called to account for his ideas and partly,
too, because I cannot convince myself that there
is not a violation of the best tenets of our tradi
tional Christian and civic morality involved in the
practice of race segregation.
I hope — albeit somewhat forlornly — that we
may yet see in our time a just and generous solu
tion of the problem.
Richard S. Cromwell
