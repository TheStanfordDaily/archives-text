# Letters on Establishing NAACP
## 
### 
NAACP Defined
Editor, The Daily:
It is pointless to create one's
own definitions of what the NAA
CP is. The NAACP historically
and nationally has been dedicated
to securing equal rights for all
citizens through legal means. This
cannot be called partisan politics.
Those students who are members
of NAACP will decide what is the
most appropriate activity of the
chapter on campus.
The NAACP could sponsor de
bates, etc., to air views on segre
gation, gradualism ahd rule by
law. As one of those present at
the organizing meeting said, "An
active NAACP on campus would
demonstrate to potential Negro
students that they are welcome at
Stanford."
Another reason for having a
Stanford chapter that has been
suggested is the opportunity it
would offer for Negro-white cul
tural interchange.
There is room for many organi
zations working to secure equal
rights for all citizens. Are the
"minority rights" of which critics
speak, those of the while suprem
ist sections of the South to murder
Negro adults and children without
fear of punishment; or the "mi
nority rights" of the white su
premists to deny the franchise to
Negroes by terror and intimida
tion?
As long as the Negro people in
a community continue to give up
every human dignity in their hous
ing, transportation, education or
personal living, then we are told
that "good race relations" exist.
But as soon as there appears the
slightest sign that the Negro
people are determined to walk up
right with dignity and to partici
pate in the basic human rights
of living in decent homes of their
own choice, etc., however mild the
assertion, then we are told that
"outside agitation" is upsetting
the smooth race relations.
As for gradual processes to
achieve integration, I think there
is also room for education and
whatever other gradual processes
one could suggest in addition to
rule by law. However, one hun
dred years of waiting for one Na
gro student to enter the Univer
sity of Alabama is gradual
enough. •
For those interested in partici
pating or learning more about the
program of the NAACP there will
be a meeting the second week of
the spring quarter.
Alvirt While

group, ihe national charter pro
hibiting the support of particular
parties or candidates. It is politi
cal only to the extent that its mem
bers are in agreement with the
basic principles of the organiza
tion and seek their realization
through the democratic process.
In answer to Mr. Hudson's
charge that the organization does
not tolerate minorities within it
self, membership in the NAACP is
wholly voluntary, composed of
people who are in basic agreement
with the Association's policies as
determined each year by represen
tatives of the local chapters meet
ing in convention.
It was made clear at Tuesday's
meeting by an 18-7 vote that the
local chapter was not to be a dis
cussion group but would adhere to
the national objectives of the or
ganization and reflect activities of
other college chapters.
This 18-7 vote showed, not that
a minority existed within the or
ganization but that certain of
those present did not even share
the basic principles of NAACP
and therefore have no place in it.
Does a Democrat go to a Repub
lican party meeting and complain
that because his views are not ac
cepted his minority rights have
been violated?
Mike Hudson alludes to NAA
CP's methods as if they were sin
ister ones and in no place either
explicitly states what these meth
ods are, nor does he propose al
ternatives. What are these meth
ods?
NAACP is a legal action group
employing highly - regarded law
yers who plead civil rights cases
before the U.S. Supreme Court
and the lower courts.
The local chapters act as sound
ing boards to formulate national
objectives, to gather support for
these objectives, to help finance
the legal staff, and to bring civil
rights violations to the attention
of the national organization.
The methods of the NAACP are
legal action and political petition,
American democratic tradition.
The labels "White" and "Col
ored," over drinking fountains,
waiting rooms, rest rooms and all
other public accommodations in
the South, have created race con
sciousness—not the NAACP.
When a 14-year-old Negro boy is
brutally murdered for whistling at
a white woman, it is not the NAA
CP that is making Negroes con
scious of their race. When a mob
of 3000 white people attempts to
stone a Negro girl because she ex
ercises her constitutional right to
a college education, it is not. the

NAACP that is making Negroes
conscious of their race.
The NAACP was established by
Lincoln Steffens and others in
1909, following a wave of lynching
and a year after the infamous race
riot of 1908 when hundreds of Ne
groes in Springfield, Illinois, were
murdered. When it is in mind
that NAACP chapters in the
South are today composed of the
leading ministers and professional
people, how then can NAACP be
accused of fomenting racial ten
sions.
Mike Hudson doubts that social
reform can be achieved by legisla
tion and calls for "a gradual proc
ess of education and progress.".
The NAACP has been working for
•47 years in the fundamental belief
that social reform can be achieved
through legislation, as the truly
democratic way of achieving prog
ress in our society.
After 70 years of injustice how
long must Negro Americans wait
for the recognition of their demo
cratic rights as citizens? After
looking at the reforms of NAACP
for 47 years, one wonders if Mike
Hudson isn't hiding a do-nothing
policy behind the cloak id' "grad
ualism."
When one sees the astounding
amount of peaceful integration
that has taken place in this coun
try one feels that violence is the
exception rather than the rule and
that those who point up the vio
lence are seeking to cloud this
progress.
The NAACP is and has always
been unalterably opposed to all
violence and works only within
the legal structure of our democ
racy to secure minority rights.
Finally, what advantages does
an NAACP chapter hold for Stan
ford? As was recognized at Tues
day's meeting, Stanford is com
posed of a relatively homogeneous
student body which may not be
adequately prepared to under
stand other groups in our society.
That there are so few Negro stu
dents in such a large University is
indicative of this homogeneity. It
is our belief that an NAACP chap
ter on campus will: (1) provide
contact with Negroes in the area
and other NAACP college chap
ters, (2) provide an atmosphere
whereby Negro parents will feel
their children will be welcome at
Stanford (the administration and
many students have expressed
their desire for more Negro appli
cants), and (31 it will enable Stan
ford students to take a firm and
active stand on the most impor
tant issue facing America today.
