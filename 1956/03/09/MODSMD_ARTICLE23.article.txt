# NAACP Explained

### 
Editor, Tho Daily:
In yesterday's letter to The
Daily Mike Hudson misrepresent
ed the nature and methods of the
NAACP. He said that NAACP is
disguising as a discussion group
and that it is fomenting racial ten
sion and violence in the South. In
this letter we will answer ihese
two charges and show the benefit
an NAACP chapter would bring to
Stanford.
The NAACP chapter has func
tioned on campus in the past. Its
formation was approved by the
Board of Trustees.
The NAACP is not a discussion
group and has never pretended to
be one. It is not a political action
