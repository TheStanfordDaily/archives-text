# On Campus With Max Shulman
## THE 						GRIM AND GRISLY ADVENTURES OF NORBERT SIGAFOOS, AMERICAN 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy with Cheek," etc 
If you squeam, read no further, for today's column is not for
the squeamish.
It is a harrowing story which begins in 191G when Norbert
Sigafoos, im ichthyology major from UCLA, went on a field trip
with his class to Monterey Bay to study the many fish and
crustaceans who make their homes in these waters.
But truth to tell, Norbert was not very interested in ichthyol
ogy. What he was interested in was television, which in 1946
was an exciting new infant industry. While his classmates
leaned over the rail of the boat, studying the tunny and amber
jack which swarmed below, Norbert just leaned and thought
about television. Thus preoccupied, he fell overboard and, all
unnoticed, was washed far out to sea.
A strong swimmer, Norbert, after 43 days, sighted land—a
tiny atoll, far away from the normal sea lanes. Tired but happy,
he clambered ashore. Being a college man, he was, of course,
fearless, resourceful, and clean in mind, body, and spirit. He
built himself a snug shelter, fashioned traps for animals, wove
fishing lines, and arranged day and night signals to attract
any passing ships.

Though nine years went by, Norbert never abandoned hop<
of being rescued. At long last, his patience was rewarded. Or
October 14, 1955, he was picked up by the Portuguese tanker,
Molly O'Day.
Ralph Gomez, the ship's captain, greeted Norbert with a
torrent of Portuguese. "Do you speak English?" Norbert asked.
"A little," said Ralph Gomez, which was no less than the
truth. He did speak a little English: two words. They were "a"
and "little."
But, withal, he was a good hearted man, and he gave Norber
fresh clothes, a razor, and a cheroot.
"No, thank you," said Norbert to the cigar. "I'm a Philip
Morris man myself. Have you ever smoked Philip Morris?"
"A little," said Ralph Gomez.
"Then you know what 1 mean when I talk about their yummy
goodness, their delicately reared tobaccos, their soothing, con
soling, uplifting, unfailing gentleness-pack after pack aftei
pack," said Norbert.
"A little," said Ralph Gomez.
"I suppose you're wondering," said Norbert, "how I kept my
sanity during all those years on the island."
"A little," said Ralph Gomez.
"Well, I'll tell you," said Norbert. "I've been thinking about
television because that's what 1 want to go into when I get back.
For nine years I've been sitting on that island thinking up
brand new shows for television. And I've got some marvelous
new ideas! I've got one terrific idea for a show where a panel
of experts tries to guess people's occupations. 'What's My Line?'
1 call it. Then I've got one, a real doozv, where you pull some
body unexpectedly out of the studio audience and do his whole
life story. 'This Is Your Life,' I call it. Rut that's not all! 1
thought up a real gut-buster of an idea for a quiz show where
you give away not $04, not $6400, but- get this, Ralph Gomez
$6t 4 J)00! Wow, I can hardly wait to get back to the States and
sell these fabulous ideas to the networks!"
There is, fortunately, a happy ending to this chilling tale. Nor
bert never had to suffer the bitter disappointment of learning
that all his ideas had long since been thought of by other people.
Why not? Recause the Portuguese tanker, Molly O'Day, strucl
a reef the day after picking up Norbert and, 1 am gratified to
report, went down with all hands. cm»i shuimnn, i9i*

was an exciting new infant industry. While his classmates
leaned over the rail of the boat, studying the tunny and amber
jack which swarmed below, Norbert just leaned and thought
about television. Thus preoccupied, he fell overboard and, all
unnoticed, was washed far out to sea.
A strong swimmer, Norbert, after 43 days, sighted land—a
tiny atoll, far away from the normal sea lanes. Tired but happy,
he clambered ashore. Being a college man, he was, of course,
fearless, resourceful, and clean in mind, body, and spirit. He
built himself a snug shelter, fashioned traps for animals, wove
fishing lines, and arranged day and night signals to attract
any passing ships.

Though nine years went by, Norbert never abandoned hop<
of being rescued. At long last, his patience was rewarded. Or
October 14, 1955, he was picked up by the Portuguese tanker,
Molly O'Day.
Ralph Gomez, the ship's captain, greeted Norbert with a
torrent of Portuguese. "Do you speak English?" Norbert asked.
"A little," said Ralph Gomez, which was no less than the
truth. He did speak a little English: two words. They were "a"
and "little."
But, withal, he was a good hearted man, and he gave Norber
fresh clothes, a razor, and a cheroot.
"No, thank you," said Norbert to the cigar. "I'm a Philip
Morris man myself. Have you ever smoked Philip Morris?"
"A little," said Ralph Gomez.
"Then you know what 1 mean when I talk about their yummy
goodness, their delicately reared tobaccos, their soothing, con
soling, uplifting, unfailing gentleness-pack after pack aftei
pack," said Norbert.
"A little," said Ralph Gomez.
"I suppose you're wondering," said Norbert, "how I kept my
sanity during all those years on the island."
"A little," said Ralph Gomez.
"Well, I'll tell you," said Norbert. "I've been thinking about
television because that's what 1 want to go into when I get back.
For nine years I've been sitting on that island thinking up
brand new shows for television. And I've got some marvelous
new ideas! I've got one terrific idea for a show where a panel
of experts tries to guess people's occupations. 'What's My Line?'
1 call it. Then I've got one, a real doozv, where you pull some
body unexpectedly out of the studio audience and do his whole
life story. 'This Is Your Life,' I call it. Rut that's not all! 1

sell these fabulous ideas to the networks!"
There is, fortunately, a happy ending to this chilling tale. Nor

that all his ideas had long since been thought of by other people.
