# Bloch Speaks At Student Poli Sci Meet

### 
Drawing on a deep personal ap
preciation of the value of democ
racy to free scientific inquiry, No
bel Prize-winning physicist Felix
Bloch warned that a country "can
not ask for freedom in one specific
field and let it go to pieces in
others."
"Even in a democracy," the
grey-haired professor said to an
initiation meeting of Pi Sigma Al
pha, national political science fra
ternity, "danger signals may
arise."
"People hear of hidden things in
laboratories, they look under their
bods in fear and then make people
swear to oaths. Those who know
of the relation of freedom and sci
ence will not swear to these
oaths."
Dr. Bloch told the group of 60
political science students and fac
ulty how the "very blossom of
Herman science" was crushed by
I lie advent of political repression
in the 1930'5.
He cited the German and Ital
ian scientific declines as warnings
against divorcing scientific free
dom from political freedom and
said "if basic research were lim
ited tomorrow you wouldn't feel
it immediately, hut in the long run
i< would be felt, and felt very
much.
Speaking of a possible modern
"paranoid complex," he concluded
that "when you live in dangerous
times, the worst thing you can do
is to be afraid.
