# Junior Prom to Be At Palace Hotel
## 
### 
The Garden Court of the Shera
ton-Palace Hotel has been reserv
ed for Friday, April 20, for the
Junior From.
The Garden Court is larger than
Castlewood, site of last year's
prom, so there will be no prob
lem of overcrowding, according
to Jim Bass, prom publicity chair
man.
The Garden Court is the site of
many of San Francisco's civic and
social events including the annual
debutantes' ball.
This is the first time a prom
has been scheduled for this room.
