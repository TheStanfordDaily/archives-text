## ...or how automation makes more and better paying jobs 
### 
"You hear a lot of talk these days about how
automation is going to cost people their jobs.
"Me, 1 work in the most'automatized' indus
try of them all—petroleum. And far from cost
ing me my job, automation has made it a
better one.
"When 1 was just getting started in the refin
ery back in 1925 the average production for

the industry was SZ barrels of prcxluct a day
per man. The average investment in refinery
tools at the time was SIO,OOO per man.
"Today the industry's investment in tools for
each refinery employee is $50,000. Offhand
you'd think that that much machinery would
put some refinery people out of work. But just
the opposite is true.
"Bark in 1925 the refineries employed just
over 65,000 people. Today (hey give jobs to
over twice as many—l33,ooo. What's more,
our production has gone up to 59 barrels a day
per man.

Automation, if seems to us here at (lie Union
Oil Company wlicrc Angcll works, illustrates
again the basic strength of America's free com
petitive economy.
So long as business has to compete, it must
constantly improve its products. This calls for
the fullest use of new and better machines.
This has sometimes caused temporary read
justments in an industry. But in the long run

"We produce these 59 barrels in 40 hours a
week, instead of the old 51 in 1925. And we
make more money. In my case my pay is up
288.89% since I started on the job.
u lf this is automation, I'll take more of it!"

it helps to create better paying jobs for more
and more people.
Which is another reason why the number of
Amcricn? at work and the standard of living
they enjoy continue to climb.

"You hear a lot of talk these days about how
automation is going to cost people their jobs.
"Me, 1 work in the most'automatized' indus
try of them all—petroleum. And far from cost
ing me my job, automation has made it a
better one.
"When 1 was just getting started in the refin
ery back in 1925 the average production for

the industry was SZ barrels of prcxluct a day
per man. The average investment in refinery
tools at the time was SIO,OOO per man.
"Today the industry's investment in tools for
each refinery employee is $50,000. Offhand
you'd think that that much machinery would
put some refinery people out of work. But just
the opposite is true.
"Bark in 1925 the refineries employed just
over 65,000 people. Today (hey give jobs to
over twice as many—l33,ooo. What's more,
our production has gone up to 59 barrels a day
per man.
