George Selleck, the "Mighty
j Mite" of Pacific Coast basketball,
; closes out his college career
! against Cal tomorrow.
Selleck, who Coach Howie Dall
j mar calls "the nnest little man,
i pound for pound, in basketball,"
: will leave a lasting mark behind
j him as a Pacific Coast Conference
star.
By scoring only 23 points in the
pair of games against the Bears,
George can move into the fifth

spot in all-time point-making by
players'from the Southern Divi
sion schools. An especially good
weekend could boost the 5-8 star
into fourth place, by-passing the
record of Johnny Moore, a gradu
ate of UCLA last year.
Coach Dallmar, in his second
season as leader of the Indian
cagers, also praised Selleck as "a
great captain and a fine inspira
tional leader."

ors and All-America mention.

of UCLA, has finally passed!

the year Selleck held about a 50-
point lead, I>ut Naulls is on the

season than any player in confer
ence history, with the exception
