### 
WASHINGTON, March 8 (UP)—The White House struck back
today at Democratic charges that President Eisenhower plans to
delegate certain "constitutional duties" to subordinates if elected
to a second term.
Murray Snyder, acting Presidential news secretary, said Eisen
hower has made it clear he "has not delegated his constitutional
duties." He said the President plans only to curtail his "hospi
tality functions."
Snyder issued a statement replying to a nationwide broadcast
last night by Senator John J. Sparkman (D-Ala.). the 1952 Demo
cratic Vice-Presidential nominee. Sparkman delivered the official
Democratic reply to Eisenhower's Feb. 29 second term announce
ment.
Sparkman said Eisenhower would be a "part-time President"
because of his health. He also declared Eisenhower has said he
would hand over to associates certain functions "which, under the
constitution, cannot be delegated."
But Snyder said "I think the President very clearly stated last
Wednesday and yesterday the distinction between his constitu
tional duties and his hospitality functions, the latter being the
department in which he has reduced his activities."
