# Women May Sign Housing Shrinkage Lists on Monday
## 
### 
*
Any woman who remained in
housing drawing and was not
given one of her first three
choices may sign up for shrink
age Monday from 2 to 4:30 p.m.
Sign-ups will be held in the
Housing Office, Room 101 A, In
ner Quad. There will be two
shrinkage periods, one extending
until registration day and the
other through the following two
weeks.
Women may sign up for any
one, two or three choices on their
drawing card and may change the
previous order. If two go into
shrinkage together they may be
separated if only a single vacancy
occurs.
If there is a vacancy it must be
accepted, since a student enters
into a contract with the Univer
sity when she goes on shrinkage.
