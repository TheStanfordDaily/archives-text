' WASHINGTON, March 8 (UP)
President Eisenhower scored a
thumping election-year legislative
victory today when the Senate
crushed a Democratic attempt to
restore high rigid price supports
on four basic farm crops.
The White House said Eisen
hower was "delighted" with the
outcome.
, By a surprising 13-vote margin
of 54 to <41, administration forces
knocked out of the Senate's omni
bus farm bill a provision that
would have restored flat 90 per
cent price supports on cotton,
; corn, peanuts and rice.
For the first time in 20 years
every Senator was on hand for the
vote a clear indication of the im
portance they attached to the is
sue and its probable effect on the
coining fight for control of the
White House and Congress.
Forty-one Republicans and 13
Democrats voted against 90 per
cent supports. Favor in g high
fixed supports were 35 Democrats
and six Republicans, all from the
; Midwest farm belt.
