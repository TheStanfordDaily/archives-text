Proposed changes in ASSU so
cial regulations will be on top of
Legislature agenda when the
group meets again next quarter.
The changes were first intro
duced to Legislature members at
last Wednesday's meeting, the fi
nal one for this quarter.
According to ASSU Viee-Presi
dent and Chairman of Social Co
ordinating Board Helen Zarifes,
the most "radical" ones are in the
patron requirements.
If Legislature approves the new
plan, patrons—or adult guests as
they will be called—will be re
quired at all overnight and open
functions.
Members of the University
staff, parents of members of the
sponsoring group and, in the case
of fraternities, chapter advisers
will be qualified to serve as "adult
guests."
Up for Decision
Also up for decision next quar
ter is a new head yell-leader by
law. It was introduced for the
first time at the Wednesday ses
sion.
In other business, Legislature
gave official approval to the title
of a new Stanford song—"Stan
ford Loyalty March." According
to Student Financial Manager Bill
Tooley, Legislature acquiescence
to the song is necessary if ASSU
is to receive royalty benefits when
the song is played over the radio
and in other public places.
The group also voted thanks to
Alpha Phi Omega for their work
in oiling the boathouse deck. In
conjunction with this, they dis
cussed the question of when to
open Lake Lagunita officially.
