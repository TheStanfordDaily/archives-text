Standard is exploring 40 countries* to
keep America's oil reserves the highest in history
"Swamp buggy" carrying oil geologists into a Louisiana wilderness Cars by 1965
SWAMI' BUGGIES, snowmobiles — even helicop- * $
ters — are used by Standard's geologists, who seek
petroleum throughout the free world and in U.S.
states. Our search never ends. Last year, in t he Western ii
Hemisphere alone, Standard invested $I.'M million pgJjl
three times as much oil to reserves as we brought from Brafßf '
the ground. But U.S. consumption rises steadily. It's
now over million barrels per day and expected to
increase •.j within 10 years. So in 1956 we'll again
invest many millions in exploration, drill scores of new 1956 1965
wells—seeking the oil you'll use tomorrow.
