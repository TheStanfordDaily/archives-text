# Under-the-Quad Parking Lot To Ease Farm Traffic Problem
## 
### 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Stanford, Calif., April 1 A huge
underground parking lot to accommodate 1000 cars will be built
beneath Inner Quad, Business Manager Alf E. Brandin announced
today.
The project, which will cost in the neighborhood of $1,000,000,
will enable students to drive their cars to the campus area and
park them while attending class.
The garage will have three entrances, Brandin said. One enters
from behind Memorial Church, one from the east gate and one
from the west gate.
The mammoth underground parking garage will have service
station and car wash facilities. Students will be employed and the
garage will be under ASSU supervision.
Of the project Brandin said, "The underground'gar age will be
large enough to accommodate students' and administrators' cars.
It will enable them to park near their classes. The administration,
along with the student Traffic Committee, has been looking for
an equitable answer to the problem and we are sure this gigantic
facility is our answer."
The contract and architect have not yet been determined. But
it is hoped that excavation will begin in January of 1957 and the
structure will be completed by April 1, 1958.
Brandin, then, turned to the reporters who were anxious to go
and phone in the scoop. He said, "April fool."
