# That Bug Is Here Again
## 
### 
I)o\n .\ in SUN-SOAKED Florida an all-conquering
bug is fattening himself up for a long journey
which will take him into evcrv corner of the
United States.
The little bug, who has been working out
winter stiffness in the southern sun, is primed
and read) to strike at the vary hearts of the
American people.
He can't miss. weather is right. the time
is right. Spring is here, and with ii -the base
ball hug.
A Middle Fast crisi*? A change in Soviet
policy? Top priority items in everyone's mind,
but not I or long—the bug is moving out of
Florida and soon he'll he sweeping the coun
try.
W ill the Bums do it again? (Lan the Yankees
come back? Is Williams really worth all that
money? How they gonna run the National
League without Leo?
Fves and ears glued to diamonds, radios, TV
sets and newspapers will soon be searching
avidly for answers to' these new "crises."
Football s great, basketball too; Americans

low all sports, hut the one that captures lliein
all is still baseball, the National Pastime.
Millions of Americans grew u|> w illl a bat and
hall in hand, and from the experience gained
something which can never he forgotten—the
spirit of teamwork and friendly com)>etition
which has long characterized "The American
VTav."
Such ugl\ spectacles as an Autherine Lucy
heing mobbed or a Joseph McCarthy setting j
Americans one against the other can never he
erased from the memory, but they can he bal
anced — over-balanced, thank God — by the j
spectacle of a bunch of noisy kids playing hall
on the corner sandlot or a group of Americans
black, white; labor, management; rich, poor'
pulling for "dem Hums" or for "our Yan
kees."
Since its beginnings in the early nineteenth '
century baseball has provided the American
people a great tonic, a great means for common
unity. For when the baseball bug bites, he bites
us all.
Look out, you'll probably be next.
