NAACP anil Discrimination
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Hudson is to be commended for his interest
in the NAACP. It is good that he realizes that
this organization is concerned with taking ac
tion, particularly of a legal nature, wherever and
whenever a Negro's rights, as under our Federal
Constitution, are violated.
Instances where these inherent rights are being
challenged to the extent that legal action is neces
sary are so numerous that the NAACP is obli
gated to spend most of its energies in the specific
area of discrimination. This is as it should be,
for the law of this country does provide the neces
sary framework to protect citizens for illegal
arts against them.
How the guilty parties to these acts mav feel

at the moment is of .small import in so far as the
legal program of the NAACP is concerned. Cer
tainly the effectiveness of this type of action to
stop discrimination but not prejudice, can be said
to be radical.
The radical changes in the improved status of
the American Negro have come since he has
relied on the law to stop discriminatory acts, per
mitting the forces of education and persuasion
to work collaterally in the area of prejudice.
Americans who deeply feel the urgency of pro
viding equal treatment and protection under our
federal laws for all citizens must clearly acknowl
edge that it is legal action through our courts
which will eliminate acts. Most Americans are
impatient for justice and weary of this protracted
shame Which has a legacy of nearly a hundred
years.
