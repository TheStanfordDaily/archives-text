# Foreign Students Visit San Quentin, Afterwards They Call It 'Ideal Prison'
## 
### Peter Kirianoff 
On a recent trip to San Quentin
35 American and foreign men
students from Stanford visited
the California State Prison.
. One of the student visitors
from a foreign country thought
the prison was close to the ideal
prison. He emphasized that his
knowledge of prisons comes
through hearsay and not. through
experience.
Another foreign student from
the Orient was so much im
pressed by the environment that
he was eager to spend a summer
in the prison—as an employee,
however.
All the students were im
pressed by the humane treatment
of prisoners.
Another Stanford student in
quired about the conduct of the
prisoners. "If you treat them like
humans, you won't have any
troubles. After all, they are hu
man beings even if they did make
a mistake," replied the guide of
ficer.
The students were impressed
by the bi-weekly San Quentin
News which is edited by the pris
on inmates.
In one of the recent issues, an
inmate-written editorial said: "So
ciety has begun to understand
what prison is to a greater extent
in the last 10 years than many
believed possible. With that un
derstanding has come the re
sponse of the people to help solve

a social problem. It is a long,
long road yet.
Many of the troubles come
from human environment by re
jecting these people who did
something wrong along the line
like anybody else, but theirs hap
pened to be a little bigger.
To another Stanfordite, the
prison looked more like a factory
with major equipment for textile
and furniture industry operated
by prisoners. They could get paid
for their work— 10 cents an hour.
University of (California fur
nishes education to interested stu
dent prisoners. Since Cal holds a
monopoly on San Quentin educa
tion it is able to claim a higher
percentage of ex-con graduates
than many other universities.
The most impressive display of
the asylum—so thought many of
ihe visitors—was the gas cham
ber, a small green room with air
tight windows all around for
spectators. There were two metal
chairs with many "safety belt"
type straps.
The guide explained to the
group the execution process. The
dropping of a chemical "tablet into
acid produces lethal gas in a mat
ter of seconds and death with no
pain.
The guide's statement stimu
lated the curiosity and thinking

of the group when one of the
group asked how that could be
proven, since no one who has had
that experience has yet come
back to tell us.
