## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute has been handed the problem of
how to save as many lives as possible in event ol atomic attack
upon California's big cities.
For an estimated $600,000 to $800,000, SRI is to make a year-long
study and propose a workable plan of atomic survival.
The announcement was made by Deputy Administrator Stewart
Campbell T>f the Federal Civil Defense regional office in Santa
Rosa.
The federal government will pay the bill for the undertaking,
which will be done in three phases.
The first phase will cost $198,000 and will require four months'
research inio such problems as evacuation routes, traffic* control,
radiation fallout patterns and resettlement of evacuated popula
tions.
The second phase includes development V)f an operational sur
vival plan for each target area -the San Francisco Bay Area, Los
Angeles and San Diego.
Third phase of the project will be actual tests of such plans.
The project is part of the Federal Civil Defense Administra
