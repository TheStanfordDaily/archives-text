# 'VOLCANO'
## Anna Magnani 'Erupts' In 'Volcano' at Cardinal 
### Richard Mende 
Partisans of the principals will probably find it worth while seeing
Anna Magnani and Rossano Brazzi erupting their way through
"Volcano," the feature now at the Cardinal.
Magnani is alone against the world again, having been ordered
back to her poverty-stricken island in the Mediterranean after the

vice squad got * work-weary chas
| ing her on the mainland. All her
neighbors on the small island
| avoid Magnani so she gives her
j self up to the task of keeping her
j sister from following in her foot
steps.
This is no easy thing because
| Rossano Brazzi, a handsome but
sinister fellow, keeps asking the
younger sister to leave the island
with him as a fiancee. His real
intention is to turn the girl over
to a white-slave outfit in Cairo.
Older sister Magnani, who has
been through all this herself, has
her hands full preventing this
drea df u 1 calamity. She has
trouble convincing her younger
sister that this Bra/./,i is a
bounder.
Before the movie is over there
are some interesting if none too
related scenes: a diving-for-treas
ur.c scene where in one man
shoots another with skin-diving
equipment; several attempted se
duction scenes most of which
I l i::zle but one wherein the seducer
| jjets seduced by older sister; the
I eruption of the volcano scene
wherein many buildings come
j tumbling down and wherein the
j wicked are punished, e.g. Ma
gnani.
I If the script is no better than
the one in "The .Rose Tattoo"
Magnani is the same amazing Ma
gnani, flirting boldly one minute,
j overwhelmed by her own weak
j ness the next.
. Laughing, weeping, fighting
; and praying are all necessary to
; her being and she does them all
I with boundless enthusiasm, satu-
I rating the whole with a certain
| mournful quality that audiences
: have found moving.
Magnani fans will find more
Magnani in "Volcano" along with
j a delight fully rak is h Brazzi.
There is also a better-than-avcr-
I ago picture, an older one, "The
I Barefoot Contessa" (with Ava
I Gardner and Humphrey Bogart),
i being shown at the Cardinal.
