George Selleck teamed with San j
Francisco's Bill Russell and K. C.'
Jones on the West team which |
defeated the 103-72, in the;
annual All-Star game before 17,-
852 fans in Madison Square Gar
den. New York City.
Selleck, limited by an injured >
left hand, sank a field goal for two ;
points.
Russell, who lost the most valu
able player award to Temple's Hal
Lear in the NCAA playoffs, was
given that honor in New York. :
The West led nearly all the way â– 
and had a 42-3(5 advantage at half- \
time. However, in the first 5Vj i
minutes of the second half, Rus
sell and Jones helped reel off 14

| straight points for n 57*40 lead.
Russell, who repeatedly blocked
j shots by his rivals, snared 24 re-
I bounds and sank nine of 13 field
goal tries.
The West team was coached by
California's Pete Newell. Tom
Blackburn coached the East.
Russell is one of the 14 collegi-
I ate players selected to play in the
three-day Olympic tryouts in Kan
sas City starting today.
After the game the gangling
G-10 defensive demon remarked he
got a big kick out of blocking a
shot by the East's 7-foot Bill Uhl
iof Dayton, but couldn't under
-1 stand how he missed stuffing in
a basket in the first half.
