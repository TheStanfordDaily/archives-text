Although inexperienced, the organization has grown quickly and

-sweepstakes, that freshmen Joe
Lerner and Dill Wren first con

East with much success. Harvard
and Yale glee clubs were drawing
crowds from miles around, as well
as going on extensive tours, but
i he plan had never been success
ful on I he West Coast.
Lerner and Wren went ahead
with their plans. Sign-up sheets

men were selected, and rehearsals
began immediately.

living groups. According to Ler
ner, several more informal per
formances are planned, as well as
an api earance before the annual

Men's Glee Club, organized less than a year ago, has now developed
into an active and practiced singing group.
Although inexperienced, the organization has grown quickly and
already plans a concert and several informal performances for the
near future.
It was in ihe spring of 1951, after Encina had won the Spring Sing

-sweepstakes, that freshmen Joe
Lerner and Dill Wren first con
ceived the idea of a glee club at
Stanford.
The idea had been tried in the
East with much success. Harvard
and Yale glee clubs were drawing
crowds from miles around, as well
as going on extensive tours, but
i he plan had never been success
ful on I he West Coast.
Lerner and Wren went ahead
with their plans. Sign-up sheets
were posted in men's living
groups, with the result that a
large number of singers appeared
this fall for tryouts. About thirty
men were selected, and rehearsals
began immediately.
Varied Music Selection
With Jot/ Lerner as president
and Ed Forner, a graduate stu
dent in music,, as director, the
group has continued rehearsals
throughout the school year. Their
repertory includes a large and
varied selection of music every
thing from sea chanties to relig
ious music and spirituals.
Although the Men's Glee Club
has made no official appearance
as yet, the group has sung infor
mally for lioblo and other campus
living groups. According to Ler
