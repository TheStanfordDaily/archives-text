### 
PARIS, April 2 (UP)â€”Police
riot squads clashed today with
flag-waving, shouting throngs of
Algerian nationalists who demon
strated in French industrial cities
for the third straight day to pro
test French rule in Algeria.
Authorities said "a number" of
Algerians were injured when po
lice columns baltled noisy protest
marchers in Metz, capital of the
steel - making Lorraine province,
and in Thionville, a rail hub in
eastern France.
Police arrested 120 Algerian
demonstrators in Metz.
The nationalist demonstrations,
centered the past two days in
Paris and the industrial north,
shifted today to the Lorraine steel
centers.
Thousands of Algerians work
ing in France took part in today's
noisy protest marches in response
to appeals from Algerian rebels
fighting French forces in North
Africa.
The unrest was expected to
strengthen the hand of Interior
Minister Gilbert Jules who was
reported strongly opposed to dis
patching any more police and se
curity troops to rebellion-torn Al
geria.
