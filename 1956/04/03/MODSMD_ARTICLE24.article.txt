# The
						Boy Stood on the Burning Fence
## Dulles and the Brink 
### 
No neophyte in brink-walking. Secretary of
State Dulles now stands watching the United
States on the verge of another brink—the brink
of passivity, inactivity and indecision.

Riots mount in Algeria, war threatens in the
Middle Fast, two of our best allies — Britain
and Greece—are at. each other's throats.
It's time for some action, Mr. Dulles.
