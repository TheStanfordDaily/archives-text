Racial integration is still the main problem
on main college campuses. The New Republic
recently studied Negro enrollment in six South
ern colleges. Its findings:
At Tulane there are none enrolled. Negroes
occasionallv visit the campus and there have
never been any unpleasant incidents.
Negroes have attended the University of
Texas since 1950, and although there are no
enrollment figures their number is estimated at
about 100. Virginia Polytechnic has four or
five in a school of 3900. They have caused very
little comment and one is active in campus
affairs.
The graduate school at the University of
North Carolina has been open to Negroes since
1951. There, are also three Negro undergrad
uates ami no trouble of anv sort has developed.
Living quarters are still segregated.
Two schools, Emory and an anonymous col
lege, admit no Negroes at all. Emory believes
that the NAACP is pushing integration too
fast, and that a quieter, slower attitude should
prevail.

Northern universities are also attempting to
aid integration by banning discriminatory
I bias) clauses in fraternities. Columbia, Dart
mouth and the University of Chicago have all
taken this step, as well as USF on the West
("oast.
A battle is raging at Colorado over a step
take)) by the university in this direction. Its
president has proposed that discrimination be
eliminated for nationally-affiliated fraternities
but the bias clause be allowed to remain for
local chapters.
This plan is acceptable to neither students
nor faculty. Colorado's fraternity leaders ob
ject to it on the grounds that it was Communist
backed. They threatened to leave the campus.

The Pelican, Cal humor magazine, may be
subjected to pre-publication censorship here
after because of charges that its March issue
contained sacrilegious material.
The Student Judicial Committee cleared the
issue but recommended that a board be re
quired to approve all Pelican material dealing
with racial minorities and religions ideals prior
to publication.
