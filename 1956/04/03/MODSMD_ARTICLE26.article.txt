Cal students argue that this is a violation of
freedom of the press, since the censorship could
easily spread to other fields and other campus
publications.
Recently, the board backed down and also
agreed it would be "censorship."

The University of British Columbia holds a
referendum this week to decide whether to
withdraw from the National Federation of Ca
nadian University Students, the Canadian
equivalent of NSA.
The choice before the student body will be
whether to quit the organization entirely or
try to reform il from within.
Dissatisfaction with the group has been grow
ing among Canadian colleges. It is charged that
administration costs are too high, representa
tion is unfair, and NFCUS doesn't benefit stu
dents enough.
Five universities have already voted to with
draw and the ÜBC referendum may decide
whether the organization will remain in busi
ness.

Stanford isn't the only college with a traffic
problem. The University of Michigan has an
even worse one, but theirs centers around bi
cycles, not cars.
It is estimated that Michigan students own
more than 4000 bikes but only 1050 parking
places have been prrfvided. Paths are impass
able between classes because of the tangle of
students and bicycles.
Many collisions occur with cars, students and
with other vehicles. A special committee has
been formed to study the problem and provide
more facilities. It sounds so familiar.

One student at the University of North Caro
lina is complaining bitterly about a proposed
adornment to the campus, a §35,000 sundial.
\\ bile he admits this is an attractive object
and even useful if someone happens to forget
his watch, he objects to its being placed in a
space that could have been used for a badly
needed parking lot.
He also suggests the money might have been
expended for scholarships, new dorms or even
to encourage the arts by giving each student a
silk top hat in case be wanted to attend the
opera on opening night.
