# 'Picnic' as Movie Tops Stage Play; Photography Excellent
## Family Sequence Is Show's Holden Miscast as College Flunk-Out By Richard Mende 
### 
There Is a twenty-minute sequence in the film version of "Picnic"â€”
not included in the stage play that is one of the most striking bits
of cinematography to have come out of Hollywood in some time. The
camera work of James Wong Howe has portrayed the "Family at the
Annual Picnic."
This marvelous hit of Americana records the dissonant sounds of

squalling babies, of Legionnaires
speaking and of the high school
band. There is a pie-eating con
test, a three-legged race, merry
making of all varieties, with the
festivities being topped off by the
crowning of the Neewollah queen
(Halloween spelled backwards).
Unfortunately this beautiful
and perceptive photographic essay
has little to do with. Inge's play.
The play is either about sex or
life, the two being equated in
Inge's view of things.
College Flunk-Out
A virile but irresponsible col
lege flunk-out (William Holden),
who rapidly deteriorated to hobo
status, returns to the small home
town of his former roommate.
His masculinity and irresponsi
bility appeal to those desires bur
ied in the souls of ordinary peo
ple, and they rapidly fall in love
with him or pour out their souls
to him.
The lesser contenders fall by
the wayside and Kim Novak, the
town beauty who is tired of just
being told she's pretty, spends the
night with the masculine stranger
and decides the next day to run
off with him.
