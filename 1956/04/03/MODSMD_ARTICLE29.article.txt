# Casting Mistake
## 
### 
The one serious casting mistake
Joshua Logan made was having
William Holden as the hero; un
fortunately, Holden just doesn't
look college-aged and the contrast
with his roommate makes the dis
crepancy more obvious.
There is an easygoing pace to
the movie which makes it diffi
cult to know whether the show is
being peddled as a serious story
or a laugh riot.
