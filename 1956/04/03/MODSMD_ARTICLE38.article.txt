# Haynie Predicts Terrific Future For Soph Moore
## 
### 
Robin Moore, the 19-year-old 50-
yard freestyle swimming cham
pion', hasn't nearly reached his
full potential, Coach Tom Haynie
said yesterday.
Moore, who was clocked in 22.1
seconds in winning the event at
ttie NCAA championships last
week, is expected to be even bet
tor by the time the Olympic trials
roll^round.
"This boy has a very definite
chance to make the Olympic
tefim," Haynie said. "He is a won
derful prospect and he'll get much
better. Right now he is not smooth
at all. He has a lot to learn."
The young athlete from Phoe
nix, .Ariz., also holds the national
interseholastie record for the 100-
yard butterflyâ€”at 60 seconds.
"He started competitive swim
ming about five years ago in high
school," said Haynie, "but this
was his biggest win. I would say
he is the best swimmer I've ever
coached."
Moore, a Stanford sophomore,
stands 6 feet 2 inches and weighs
190 pounds. He has tremendous
shoulders, from which he gener
ates the major portion of his
power.
Right: now Haynie is working
to smooth off the rough spots in
Moore's style. His next major out
ing will be the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate championships at Stan
lord April 17-18-19. Before then
come dual meets with the Naval
Training Station of Long Beach
and University of California.
