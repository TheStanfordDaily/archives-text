# Israeli Arms Plea Turned Down by Ike
## $64 Million Request Temporarily Shelved, Say Officials 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 2 (UP) —
President Eisenhower has decided
to pigeonhole for now at least
Israel's request for .s<>'l million in
U.S. arms to offset Red shipments
to the Arabs, Administration offi
cials said today.
These officials said Mr. Eisen
hower rcached his decision last
Wednesday during a two-hour con
ference with Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles and other top
advisers of the tense Middle East
situation.
They said the President's deci
sion did not rule out the possi
bility that this country may grant
Israel's request later. But they
said Israel will have to look to
Britain, France and other allied
nations in the foreseeable future
for jet fighters and other defen
sive arms.
Israel asked to buy cut • rate
arms from the United States last
Nov. 16 after it was announced
Communist Czechoslovakia would
ship modern arms to Egypt, in
cluding tanks and Red jet bomb
ers.
The United Press was told that
France "in a matter of days" will
deliver 12 jet fighters to Israel.
But. these sources said informa
tion about the sale may be with
held for security reasons until the
planes arc in the hands of the
Israelis.
The White House decision indi
cated that the Administration has
no objections to munitions sales
to Israel by Britain or France.
But there was no assurance the
Administration will encourage its
allies to make such sales.
The Israeli plea for U.S. arms
has received considerable support
in Congress. Only yesterday Rep.
Kenneth B. Keating (R-N.Y.) said
a group of .in House Republicans
are considering adding funds for
Israel to the Administration's $1.9
billion foreign aid bill.
Keating' said the COP bloc
would insist as a "bare minimum"
that the bill include a statement
of congressional intent to aid Is
rael economically.
But Dulles and other State De
partment exports long have con
tended that arms to Israel would
not be a long-range solution to the
problems that have caused rising
tensions in the Middle East.
