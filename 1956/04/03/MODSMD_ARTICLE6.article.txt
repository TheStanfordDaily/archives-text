# Court Decides Stales Cannot Try Commies
## High Court Upholds Pennsylvania Decision Based on Smith Act 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 2 (UP)
The Supreme Court ruled today
that the states do not have the
power to prosecute Communists
and others for conspirihg to ad
vocate violent overthrow of the
federal government.
Chief Justice Earl Warren,
reading the court's 6 to 3 major
ity decision, said the power to
punish sedition became the ex
clusive right of the federal gov
ernment in 1940 when Congress
passed the Smith Anti-Subversive
Act.
The decision upheld the Penn
sylvania Supreme Court which re
versed the conviction of Pitts
burgh. Pa., Communist leader
Steven Nelson who was found
guilty of violating Pennsylvania's
37-year-old anti-sedition law.
The high court's ruling also
had the effect of striking down
similar laws in 41 other states,
Alaska and Hawaii. The only
states without sedition statutes
are Arizona, Missouri, North Da
kota, South Carolina, Oregon and
Washington.
The language of the state sedi
tion laws is similar to that of the
Smith Act. Like the federal law,
they make it a crime for anyone
to teach or advocate the over
throw of the government by force
and violence.
Justice Stanley #F. Reed was
joined by Justices Sherman Min
ion and Harold H. Burton in dis
senting.
In recent years, 27 persons
have been indicted on charges of
violating such state statutes. Be
sides Nelson, the only other per
son to be convicted of a state vio
lation was Carl Braden, former
copyreader for the Louisville Cou
rier-Journal.
Braden now is free on bond
pending his appeal to higher Ken
tucky courts.
