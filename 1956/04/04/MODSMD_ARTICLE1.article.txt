# Students Interested in All Religions But Illiterate About Own, Says Weigel
## Catholic Educator Believes tolerance Masks General Indifference to Other People's Faiths 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
The average college student is illiterate in his religion, declared
Father Gustave Weigel, visiting Catholic educator from Woodstock
College, Maryland, yesterday.
"The American college student lias developed a universal interest
in almost all religions. However, there has been little increase in

-the number of persons that take
their religion seriously."
Weigel will lecture on "Contem
porary American Theology: Cath
olic and Protestant" at Cubberley
Auditorium tonight at 8 and will
also speak to a faculty-student
seminar on "The Ways to Reli
gious Truth" at 4:15 p.m. in Bow
man Alumni House.
Father Weigel, speaking at a
press conference in Memorial
Church, said that there is a gen
eral indifference to other people's
religions that goes under the
name of tolerance.
Tolerance?
"It isn't tolerance," he says;
"people just aren't interested in
examining their and other peo
ple's religions to see what the dif
ferences are.
"They merely look at various
religions in the United States, and
they see that they are all similar
in their superficial features. If a
person is to really believe his re
ligion, he must examine it and
other religions very closely and
discover basic differences.
"Then, with graceâ€”which Is a
divine thing and cannot be forced
a person can develop a religious
philosophy. Then, and only then,
is a person truly religious."
Stanford
Father Weigel plans to return
to Woodstock College early next
week. This is his first trip to Stan
ford, but he says he feels at home
here because he once took a
course in geology in which he
studied the damage to this cam
pus after the 1906 earthquake.
He regards this as one of the
nicest campuses he has ever vis
ited.
