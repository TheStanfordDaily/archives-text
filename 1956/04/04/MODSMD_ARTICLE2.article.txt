# Sign-Ups Remain Open for Roble, Branner Sponsors
## 
### 
Women students who wish to
sponsor in freshman dorms next
year may obtain application
blanks in the ASSU office today
through Friday.
Applications must be returned
by 5 p.m. on Friday and candi
dates may sign up for interviews'
at that time. These interviews will
be held by the sponsor-choosing
committee and will begin Monday.
All candidates must have a "C"
average and be of junior or senior
standing next year.
A new sponsor program being
instituted next year will reduce
the number of sponsors in each
corridor from two to one. Each
sponsor will remain in Roble or
Branner for two quarters and may
serve only once in this capacity.
To free sponsors from official
duties so that they can devote
more time to the freshmen, hall
officers will be chosen at the same
time as sponsors.
Ellie Friar, chairman of the
sponsor-choosing committee, may
be contacted for further informa
tion.
