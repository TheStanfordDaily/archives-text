### 
MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 3 (UP)—Senator Estes Kefauver trailed
President Eisenhower by more than 40,000 votes tonight with more
than half the ballyts counted in the Wisconsin presidential primary's
"popularity race."
With 1393 of the state's 3323 precincts reporting, the President

had 170,39.") votes to 127.023 for—
Kefauver. Editor John Chappie, \
who opposed Mr. Eisenhower on !
the Republican ballot, w;ts far out j
of the running with 6678.
Voting in several areas of the
state was tragically interrupted'
by tornadoes that roared through j
the central portion of the state j
in midday. At least nine died and
moie than 30 were injured.
Head-On Clash
Kefauver and Mr. Eisenhower
collided almost head-on on today's
voting. Kefauver was unopposed
in his bid for Wisconsin's 28 Dem
ocratic convention votes. The
•President's only opponent was a
"Pro-American" slate of delegates
filed by John Chappie, Ashland
newspaper editor.
Each GOP slate includes 30 del
egates.
Republicans and Democrats dif
fered sharply on what would con
stitute a moral victory in the "pop
ularity contest" between Mr. Eis
enhower and Kefauver.
Republican leaders said Kefau
ver would have to poll more than
30 per cent of the total state vote
to claim any victory, but Demo
cratic party heads said more than
25 per cent would be a victory.
Protest Vote
Kefauver made a strong bid for
a protest vote against the Repub
licans' farm program in an elec
tion eve telegram from the South,
where he's campaigning for sup
port in Florida's May 29 primary.
Democrats hoped that, farmers
would bolt their traditionally Re
publican ranks and vote for Ke
fauver. They already had claimed
a farm revolt in the Minnesota
primary, where Kefauver defeat
ed Adlai Stevenson and the Demo
cratic vote far exceeded the vote
for President Eisenhower.
, Milwaukee precincts reported a
near record vote for a spring pri
mary election today, mainly be
cause of a lively contest for mayor
between Socialist Mayor Frank
Zeidlcr, backed by the Democrats,
and Alderman Milton McGuire,
backed by the Republicans.

Head-On Clash
Kefauver and Mr. Eisenhower
collided almost head-on on today's
voting. Kefauver was unopposed
in his bid for Wisconsin's 28 Dem
ocratic convention votes. The
•President's only opponent was a
"Pro-American" slate of delegates
filed by John Chappie, Ashland
newspaper editor.
Each GOP slate includes 30 del
egates.
Republicans and Democrats dif
fered sharply on what would con
stitute a moral victory in the "pop
ularity contest" between Mr. Eis
enhower and Kefauver.
Republican leaders said Kefau
ver would have to poll more than
30 per cent of the total state vote
to claim any victory, but Demo
cratic party heads said more than
25 per cent would be a victory.
Protest Vote
Kefauver made a strong bid for
a protest vote against the Repub
licans' farm program in an elec
tion eve telegram from the South,
where he's campaigning for sup
port in Florida's May 29 primary.

would bolt their traditionally Re

fauver. They already had claimed
a farm revolt in the Minnesota
primary, where Kefauver defeat
ed Adlai Stevenson and the Demo
cratic vote far exceeded the vote
for President Eisenhower.
