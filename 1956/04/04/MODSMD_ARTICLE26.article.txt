HILLSBORO, 0., April 3 (UP)
â€” Sixteen Negro children spent
three hours trying to win admit
tance to the predominantly white
Webster elementary school today
but failed.
The children, accompanied by
four Negro women, arrived at the
school when it opened, hoping to
be admitted under terms of a Mon
day Supreme Court decision call
ing for an immediate end to segre
gation here.
Principal Harold Henry told the
group that they could not enroll
today. He said the school board
had not changed a policy it adopt
ed years ago when it rearranged
the community's school attend
ance zones. Officials said any fur
ther change would overcrowd the
Webster school.
