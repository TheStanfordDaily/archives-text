Km s in a i vivf Rsrrr of the comparative srnall
ness of Stanford, classes oftentimes become no
more than formal lectures ami there is lack of
personal contact between student and teacher.
Many of the most valuable classes taught
here art* held in overflowing lecture rooms, and
consequently many of Stanford's outstanding
instructors are forced into the roll of more
orator than teacher.
Mail) times in such lectures a student is con
fused but ca: hardly he expected to interrupt
a lecture Ix irig given to a hundred or more
other students to question the teacher or to
inject p< rsonal remark which might add to
the whole group's understanding.
This is a problem common to most American
universiSies and one which is getting worse
with tremendously expanded opportunities for
col lege education opening every year.
One answer to this lack of personal student
faculty contact is, of course, the seminar. How
ever, this is a path open to only a compara
tive!) few ii tents, and usually only in their
major field.
Another answer, to help slow down the trend
which has made over many teachers into the
role of mere lecturers: many universities, espe
cially in Kurope and the Eastern United States,
have organized retreats or hostels.
Now the idea has taken hold at Stanford,
thanks mainly to the experiences of foreign
student adviser Werner Warmbrunn and the

groundwork of student* Nate Leanse of Cardi
nals and George Aliel of tin* Institute of Inter
national Relations.
Present plans call for a temporary hostel site
in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with the first
outing scheduled for this weekend. Ihe topic
is current international relations, the price a
mere $4, the experience outstanding.
Unfortunately only 20 students can he accom
modated in the first group of outings which
will run on successive weekends until May 6.
Mut that does not mean plans cannot he ex
panded later, after the plan gets oil" the ground,
to accommodate even more students.
Closer student-teacher relations aren't the
only purpose of the plan; a better understand
ing between American and foreign students
and among students iu general will also result.
If the present plan works —ami it certainly
will if it receives the support it deserves—the
University would he wise to build iLs own per
manent hostel, on campus. Perhaps including
such a site in future building plans would he
in order.
In the open-air informal discussions at such
a hostel the "old-fashioned" personal give-and
take teacher-pupil relationship would be firmly
re-established.
True, this relationship is "old-fashioned,"
perhaps contrary to modern "progressive" edu
cational theories, but it still remains the real—
and the best—foundation for education.
