Strange it is, and indeed unfortunate, that
the Communists are often afforded the oppor
tunity to support the sustenance of civil liber
ties against the actions of zealous, but oft-times
misguided Federal officials.
I ast week, the New York City District Direc
tor of Internal Revenue sparked a nation-wide
clamp-down on Communist party offices; liens
were slapped and party property confiscated
for failure to pay back taxes or declare tax
status.
The action was technically legal. The reve
nues were properly a matter of inquiry as the
Communist Party neither paid taxes nor ap
plied for tax-free status on the supposition that
it had tax immunity automatically as a politi
cal parly, and its organ, the Daily Worker, had
never filed tax statements.
The paper argues that it need not pay taxes
because it operates on a deficit, but the law re
quires that it at least declare its status.
Although the seizures were legal, both the
objectives and methods employed can and
should be questioned.
Any other group derelict in its tax payments
would have been forewarned at least before
property was confiscated. The Communists re
ceived no bills, nor was any attempt made to
collect the taxes under the usual procedure.
\otice of the 1 ix claim was received 18 hours
after the raids.
The relevance of the law employed in the
actual seizure of property was hazy at best.
The government officials invoked the "jeop
a"d\ assessment clause," providing that prop
erly may be confiscated when it is thought the
debtor may leave the country or dispose of his
assets. In the case of the Communists, there was
no evidence of either.
Although the T-inca claim that taxes are all
they want, ulterior motives seemed apparent
when they told the Communists they would be
forced »to pnv back taxes unless they disclosed
Ihe names of contributors and lenders. Sub
scription lists, files and party documents have
bet n confiscated.
II i- the constitutional responsibility of the
government to take no steps leading to censor
ship or political suppression, no matter how
uncomplimemary the publications may be. It
i- within the realm of the courts to punish sedi
lionarv actions.
