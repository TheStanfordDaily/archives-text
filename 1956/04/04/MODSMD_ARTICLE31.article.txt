# Columnists Discuss Income Tax Difficulties of Communist Party
## 
### JIM PALMER 
Everyone has lax troubles about this time of
the year, but Communists in America seem to
have gotten themselves in real deep with the
eternal revenue boys.
About $400,000 in back taxes is involved, say
the men who collect the green stuff every year
from the working classes.
Perhaps the Reds have been so engrossed in
preparing for a revolution that April 15 has
come and gone unnoticed in the offices where
stack the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and—
until recently—Stalin.
This seems peculiar indeed. Certainly good
Marxists would not hesitate to pay their taxes —
distributing the wealth, you know. On the
other hand, money in the pocket of the U.S.
Government would not further the cause of the
revolution or promote the economic collapse of
capitalism either.
Form 1040 probably wound up in a circular
file some place in the rush of Party affairs. I bis
did not go too well with the publishers at the
Treasury Department in Washington.
And so the Comrades awoke one morning last
week and found their offices and their news
paper being occupied by agents of Filthy Capi
talism. Not only that, hut party records and
assets were being given the once-over by the
T-men.
"Foul! yelled the Reds. In other words,
what's a little money between (big smile)
friends?
Characteristically, they refused the Govern
ment's plan for settlement. No doubt they will
shortly have one of their own to offer, as
usual.
Lintil agreement can be reached through
legal channels, and — hopefully — short of a
meeting at the summit, the Comrades are look
ing for a plafe to park their manifestos.
I he Daily \\ orker is no longer working daily.
And generally, things are rough all over.
\\ hich all goes to prove this tax-collecting
hu siness is no passing fancy of the men who
work for George Humphrey. It's here to stay
whether it be considered a thorn in the side of
the proletariat or a necessary evil for govern
ment operation.
Our Communist companions are learning the
hard way this is one state that does not intend
to wither awav.
