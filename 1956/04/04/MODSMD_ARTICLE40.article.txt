# Papoose Netters Face Burlingame
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman tennis
team entertains Burlingame High
School's netters this afternoon.
The match is slated to begin at
2:45 on the Stanford courts.
Pacing the Papoose swatters
will be Dave Nelson and Brooks
Rawlins, first and second singles,
respectively. The two sharp-shoot
ers will probably team to play
first doubles for the frosh.
