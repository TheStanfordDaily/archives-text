# Trees Damaged In Winter Storms To Be Replaced
## 
### 
Eucalyptus trees in the area
around the Stanford Stadium that
were damaged in the Christmas
storms are being removed by the
University corporation yard.
The damaged and dying trees
are being replaced by native Cali
fornia oaks. Over 200 of the oaks
have been set out this year.
Dirk Schroder, University gar
den foreman, says that the area
around the stadium was original
ly intended by Senator Stanford
to be an arboretum. He laid the
area out and planted eucalyptus
trees for shade and windbreak.
"The original eucalyptus trees
grew so fast they forced out the
other plantings, and Stanford was
stuck wit h eucalyptus," said
Schroder.
"Those trees are too old now,
and they are dying back. Twenty
of them blew down in the storms
this winter. We are removing
these trees and other damaged
ones and replacing them with
oaks," ho said. '
Schroder explained that euca
lyptus are "most unreliable" trees
and are very dangerous when they
grow old, since they blow down
without warning.
