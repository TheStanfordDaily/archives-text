### 
The scientists who design Stan
ford's atom-smashing linear ac
celerators are going to have a
bigger workshop.
According to University offi
cials, a $160,000 addition to the
Stanford Microwave Laboratory
will be financed largely by con
tract income and a gift from Var
ian Associates, Palo Alto electron
ics firm.
The Varian - Stanford contract,
under which the firm will manu
facture and market linear acceler
ators for medical and industrial
use, is expected to provide about
half the total cost. The Varian
gift. $50,000, will be paid in $10,000
annual installments. The remain
der will come from general Uni
versity funds.
