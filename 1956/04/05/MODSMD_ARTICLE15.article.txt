# Congress Alone Can Declare War, Says Eisenhower
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 4 (UP)
President Eisenhower, in a rare
display of emotion, emphatically
declared today that he never will
send American troops to war in
the Middle East or elsewhere
without Congressional approval.
His eyes flashing, the President
said Congress alone has power
"to declare war and I am going to
observe" it. U.S. forces may have
to defend themselves or "under
take local warlike acts," he said,
but "that is not going to war."
Eisenhower told a news confer
ence that "I get discouraged
sometimes" because "I have said
this so often that it seems to me
almost ridiculous to ask me the
question."
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said yesterday that Ameri
can marines or other forces con
ceivably could he sent into action
in the Middle East if an emer
gency arose when Congress was
not in session or there was no
time to consult the lawmakers.
Eisenhower also said he has
been in communication with Brit
ish Prime Minister Sir Anthony
Eden on the tense Middle East
situation. Reports from London
said the British were pressing for
more "determined action" by the
United States to avert war in the
area.
The President said, however,
that no one has "pressed" him. If
urged to take a "firmer line" in
the Middle East, he said, he would
have to ask: "Firmer line with
respect to what, where, when, and
all the rest of it."
