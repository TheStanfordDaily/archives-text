# Theology Defined as 'Truth of Man's Ultimate Concern' by Father Weigel In Cubberley Address Last Night
## Catholics Revelationist, Systematic, Conservative, Says Jesuit Speaker 
### Julie Olson 
I' at her Gustave Weigel opened his address on "Contemporary
American Theology" in C'ubberley Auditorium last night by saying,
"Theology is like snakes: fascinating subjects, but you better keep
away from them."
Â«
lie defined theology as the rational co-ordination of data which

is the "amount of isolated truth
which man finds under t he pres
sure and urge of his ultimate con
cern."
There are two methods of co
ordinating this data. One is the
empirical - naturalistic method,
which concludes that the data rel
ative ..to the ultimate concern are
available to any man regardless
of his own concern.
The second method is the reve
lational, which says the ultimate
ground of being is not obvious to
any man unless unveiled to man
by interference from the Divine.
Therefore, tlie data for theologi
cal enterprise will be in the con
versation between God and man
as occurred when Christ was pres
ent on earth.
All Cat holic theologians are rev
elationists, while Protestants are
both naturalistic and revelationist.
Differences
As for the differences between
the two groups of theologists, Fa
ttier Weigel said the Catholics be
lieve the contents is conserved
and legitimately evolved within
the community of the Church.
They find data amid the teach
ing order of the church, who in
turn derive their teachings from
the Scriptures, the "vital light"
of the church and tradition. He
compared the Catholic theology to
a beautiful medieval castle with
modern conveniences.
The Catholic theologians are
concerned with the metaphysical,
conservative and systematical.
The ultimate source of data for
t he Protestant theologians is from
divinely inspired scripture. They
are divided into two schools: the
fundamentalists, who rely only on
scripture, and the non-fundamen
talists, who rely on scripture en
lightened by present environment.
Protestant Principles
The principles of Protestant
theology ait? that the discipline
method is the most popular one
in use at the time; the work is not
tied to tradition and it is not pre
occupied with system.
He drew an analogy between
Protestant theology and a modern
home full of the latest conven
iences, but with a rock garden in
back made up of the ruins of past
structures now covered with beau
tiful flowers.
To facilitate understanding
present theology, Father Weigel
continued with a "bird's-eye view"
of what theologians are doing in
our time.
Improve Church
Both are engaged in the study
and improvement of the church,
emphasizing its spiritual and fel
lowship elements. One result of
Jhis movement is the recently or
ganized World Council of Church
es to promote unity within the
Protestant churches.
Also, theologians are working
to make the Scriptures more read
able and find out what they say
and mean.
