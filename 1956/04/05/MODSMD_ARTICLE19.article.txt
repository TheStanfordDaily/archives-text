# Weigel Says Existence Of God Certain
## Jesuit Calls [illegible] [illegible] Of In [illegible] 
### 
"Only the fool says in his heart
there is no God." This quotation
from an old po?m is true, srvd F
ther Gustave Weigel. "No n n 'i" 1
'scape from the attract - n
invisible po*e,'' whetl.e e "s
this "pole" divinity, the ]' me
Mover or the Supreme Cause.
In his address to faculty and
students assembled at Bowman
Alumni House yesterday, Father
Weigel presented "Ways to Reli
gious Truth."
I-Ie began his discussion by de
fining religion as man's ultimate
concern. Thus religion is the
"feeling or reaction to the attrac
tion of the invisible pole that de
termines lives."
Father Weigel purposely did
lot define that invisible pole as
God. He said that man has to de
cide on the nature of the invisible
pole. Since no man can escape the
attraction of this invisible pole,
"there never was, there isn't and
there never will be an atheist.
Every man has his own religious
commitments and most men like
it."
Three Approaches
Father Weigel went on to de
velop the three approaches to
man's development of these reli
gious commitments. The average
man does not have time to find
the nature of the invisible pole
for himself so he adopts the be
liefs of his neighbors.
This solution to the seeking of
religious truths, Father Weigel
said, is the social conformist way.
It is not an unreasonable ap
proach, the Jesuit priest pointed
out. The Gospel says, "By their
fruits ye shall know them," which
is a reasonable norm for any
man.
The approach to the divine
through nature was developed by
Plato who said that the greatest
good was divinity. Philosophers
through the ages like Aristotle,
the Stoics, Deists, Schweitzer and
Einstein all approached religion
through the naturalistic-humanis
tic approach.
Marxism
Marxists, too, belong to this
category because they believe in
a surging force moving through
nature and history which directs
all things toward their goal. Ac
cording to this principle, contin
ued Father Weigel, the Commu
nists are the most religious group
we have in our time because they
follow their principles with fer
vor to guide their destiny.
Those who find their religious
theories through faith believe
that the invisible pole became vis
ible in a personal way during that
short period when Christ was
teaching.

Those who find their religious
theories through faith believe
that the invisible pole became vis
ible in a personal way during that
short period when Christ was
teaching.
"Only the fool says in his heart
there is no God." This quotation
from an old po?m is true, srvd F
ther Gustave Weigel. "No n n 'i" 1
'scape from the attract - n
invisible po*e,'' whetl.e e "s
this "pole" divinity, the ]' me
Mover or the Supreme Cause.
In his address to faculty and
students assembled at Bowman
Alumni House yesterday, Father
Weigel presented "Ways to Reli
gious Truth."
I-Ie began his discussion by de
fining religion as man's ultimate
concern. Thus religion is the
"feeling or reaction to the attrac
tion of the invisible pole that de
termines lives."
Father Weigel purposely did
lot define that invisible pole as
God. He said that man has to de
cide on the nature of the invisible
pole. Since no man can escape the
attraction of this invisible pole,
"there never was, there isn't and
there never will be an atheist.
Every man has his own religious
commitments and most men like
it."
Three Approaches
Father Weigel went on to de
velop the three approaches to
man's development of these reli
gious commitments. The average
man does not have time to find
the nature of the invisible pole
for himself so he adopts the be
liefs of his neighbors.
This solution to the seeking of
religious truths, Father Weigel
said, is the social conformist way.
It is not an unreasonable ap
proach, the Jesuit priest pointed
out. The Gospel says, "By their
fruits ye shall know them," which
is a reasonable norm for any
man.
The approach to the divine
through nature was developed by
Plato who said that the greatest
good was divinity. Philosophers
through the ages like Aristotle,
the Stoics, Deists, Schweitzer and
Einstein all approached religion
through the naturalistic-humanis
tic approach.
Marxism
Marxists, too, belong to this
category because they believe in
a surging force moving through
nature and history which directs
all things toward their goal. Ac
cording to this principle, contin
ued Father Weigel, the Commu
nists are the most religious group
we have in our time because they
follow their principles with fer
vor to guide their destiny.
