# 'The Silent Generation'

I \ the March 24 issue of The Nation, William
Morris, editor of the Daily Texan (University
of Texas) comments on the recent controversy
between it is paper ami the university's hoard of
regents.
The trouble all began seven weeks ago when
the regents announced they were going to tight
en up on the paper's editorial policy.
The reason: "Obviously they had been high
ly disturbed by certain aspects of the Texan's
categorical defense of student press freedom
and its editorial comments on 'controversial'
state and national issues," says Morris.
The paper bad gone on record against the
Texas governor's administration—Allan Shiv
ers, who appointed the university regents.
The. paper had asked that the slate's oil and
gas interests pay more taxes, had sought intelli
gence, good will and enlightened gradualism
in the university's desegregation problem, and
had lauded Texans for their moderate but tol
erant approach to integration.
It had stood firmly against the Harris-Ful
hright natural-gas bill (one of the few Texas
papers to do so t.
Says Morris: '"In short, it [the Daily Texan |
had committed the crime of being vigorous and
outspoken, naively idealistic and exuberantly
hut not radically liberal in a predominantly
conservative state."
< )f course (his is no "crime," in fact it's the
ideal for wliieh most college dailies (including
The Stanford Daily) strive. Some fail to reach
the ideal simply because of a lack of talent: a
poor situation, but one is at least excused
because the students tried.
But there are many others that have failed
to reach ibis goal because of outside pressure,
pressure such as that put on the Daily Texan
by a board of regents who have asserted the
Daily Texan should not discuss controversial
state and national topics, saying that college
students were not interested in such topics.
This is a familiar line; it has been intimated
to us before, especially in relation to the recent
segregation controversy, but Stanford's admin
istration has had tjie good sense to leave the
student newspaper in control of the students.
A more common form of pressure is that
Ironi students who believe a college newspaper
should be a mere bulletin board announcing
the coming social highlights and be used as a
vehicle of free advertisement for plays and
dances.
We have constantly resisted such pressures
and consequently have been made to hear the
waitings of a steady stream of would-be jour
nalists who pour in and out of the editor's office
with some of the saddest stories ever told.
We have been fortunate; we have a wise ad
ministration which feels that censorship of the
student press would be one of the worst things
that could happen to a university.

And we have a majority of readers who know
that a newspaper's functions, whether college
or otherwise, are in keeping with their ver)
name, i.e., NEWSpapers, not bulletin boards.
And fortunately this majority can see farther
than the noses'on their faces; they are curious
about the world around tlnMr little safe inner
shell at Stanford University.
But there are others. They crawl into that
safe little shell and there they cower, not want
ing to be disturbed by the problems of the bad
outside world.
These are the students who, like the Texas
board of regents, ask, "Why do you comment
on state and national topics? Why are you
qualified to do so?"
\\ by? A Stanford education is enough quali
fication for us. But if it is not a good enough
qualification, then this University had better
close jts doors forever; it is not doing its job.
\\ hen we hear sueh comment we do wonder
if this University is doing its job, for if such
thoughts come from Stanford-trained minds,
they are not being trained in the channels of
liberal education as we know it.
However, the problem is not limited to Stan
ford. As Morris says, "My generation has been
labeled the 'silent one' . . . but the generation
before us was the lost one. . . .• 1 regret we have
never been lost, because we are so smugly cer
tain of our crass goals [materialism |."
Morris points out that a silent press is the
manifestation of a silent age but that he has
"set the newspaper that is briefly mine against
the tenuous fabric of national, institutional and
personal conformity.
"The sporadic reactions, as seen in my fellow
students' defense of press freedom, provide a
foundation of hope . . . (for| the solution to
the dilemma that faces the American as he
moves closer and closer toward collective secu
rity and farther from individual responsibility
to himself, his nation and his God."
How far are those of us at Stanford moving
from this individual responsibility?
The answer is evident. Conformity is here—
but it is not necessarily here to stay, not as long
as our student press remains completely free
and as long as students think rather than blind
ly follow.
With the help of a core of thinking students
The Daily will do its utmost to halt the rush to
conformity.
\\ e will not be dictated to by a student legis
lature; we will not be dictated to by a Univer
sity administration. That is ihe present situa
tion here.
But don't be complacent —it happened in
Texas and it could happen here, not as a result
of any particular ill-feeling toward The Daily
itself, but as a manifestation of the "silent"
generation in their complacency and conform
ity—as at the University of Texas.
