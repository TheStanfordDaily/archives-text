## Will the Stanford Student Body Gain Benefit from the Hostel Program? 
### 
Beginning this weekend a new (for Stan
ford) method of informal study will be insti
tuted here. This is the student hostel program,
which ws'l feature fresh-air student-faculty dis
cussions.
A temporary site for the hostel has been set
up in the Santa Cruz Mountains at Camp Monte
Cristo. The cost is a surprisingly low $4 for the
whole weekend's room and board plus liability
insurance.
I opics included in the open-air seminar
cover such varied and important subjects as
contemporary international relations, sex, eth
ics, segregation and religion, among others.
Outstanding Stanford instructors are slated
to lead regular weekend discussions.
Program "darners have suggested that a per
manent liosicl be set up on campus.
Although the program lias been just recently
instituted, wr have asked for students to com
ment. Here's what they had to say:
Al Ciiant.Y, "56, Delta bpsilnn: "Yes, it ap
peals to ie and should to the rest of the student
body. A similar program seems to have worked
out well at San Jose State.
' It should he a wonderful opportunity for
the professors and the students to approach a
stimulating topic in this informal and congenial
manner."
Everett Kin dig, 58, off-campus: "The idea
seems promising, and given support would ben

efit tlie student body by helping the individual
student achieve better educational training. But
1 doubt if a campus hostel would be far enough
removed from the pressures of school life to
function properly."
Bor Adams, '59, Stern Hall: "It will proba
bly take a while to g<'t it because most people
aren't used to it. Basically, it's a good idea, in
fact, for Stanford it's perfect."
Bill Newsome, '56, Village: "It won't be of
such va % to me individually, but to the stu
dents who are able to participate, 1 think it will
be of tremendous value and interest.
"I only wish I could take advantage of it, but
wi th my Mechanical Engineering program
drawing to a close, it's rather difficult. The in
formality of the hostel program, though, would
be of great advantage to both students and pro
fessors taking part in the discussions and the
outdoor activities."
Marcus Hija, foreign scholar from Indo
nesia, Village: "Provided you have the time,
it would be of great help, especially to the for
eign student in whose country the distinction
between professor and student is more for
mal.
"Education is not only limited to the class
room, but must include the molding of your
own personality, which a program such as this
affords."
