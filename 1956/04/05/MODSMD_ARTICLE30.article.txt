# ASSU to Check Ads This Week
## 
### 
Students planning to publish ad
vertising projects on campus must
contact Student Financial Mana
ger Bill Tooley at the ASStJ office
this week.
ASSU by-laws require that such
projects as blotters and phone
wheels be reviewed by the Publi
cations Board before permission is
granted to them by the Legisla
ture. Unapproved projects may
not be distributed on campus.
