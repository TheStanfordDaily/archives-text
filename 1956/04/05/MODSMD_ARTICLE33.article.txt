The musical comedy "Wonder
ful Town," the story of two
youthful sisters from Ohio when
they descend upon New York in
search of careers, has had a dis
tinguished record. The story was
actually written by one of the sis
ters, Ruth McKenney, and first
appeared in serial form in the
New Yorker magazine.
The stories were adapted by Jo
seph Fields and Jerome Chodorov
who first made them into a non
musical comedy called "Mv Sister

Eileen." Before it was trans
formed into a musical by the
same two men some ten years
later, the story had appeared in
two movies, a book and a radio
series.
"Wonderful Town" opened in
New York in 1953 where it ran
for 554 consecutive performances.
That same year it won the New
York Drama Critics Circle Award
for the best musical comedy of
the season.

have long contributed to the
American stage. They are authors
of, among other plays, "Anniver
sary Waltz" which is currently
playing in San Francisco.

er. is equally distinguished in the
filed of music. Among his many
accomplishments are the back

short comedy opera, "Trouble in
Tahiti," and a musical version of
"Candide."
