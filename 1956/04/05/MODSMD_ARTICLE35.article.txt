### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla., April 4
(UPj â€” Welterweight contender
Vi n c e Martinez floored Cuban
champion Miguel Diaz twice and
outclassed him throughout their
nationally televised bout tonight
to score a unanimous 10-round de
cision at Miami Beach Auditori
um.
Judge Gus Jacobson scored it
99-86 in favor of Martinez; Judge
Stu Winston had it 99-89; and Ref
eree Eddie Coachman agreed, 100-
95. The United Press card read
99-92.
Martinez was simply too much
fighter for Diaz, but it was a more
exciting fight than the lopsided
final score indicated.
