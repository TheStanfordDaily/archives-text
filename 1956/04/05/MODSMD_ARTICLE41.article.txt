### Jim Price 
Trancos ll's gang of skyscrap
ers smashed their way to a 47-38
victory over AKL's quintet of
shrimps to highlight last night's
games in the first round of intra
mural basketball playoffs.
Other games saw Kappa Alpha
I belting Los Arcos, 42-21; Sigma
Chi I wiping out Stern 5 11, 60-11;
and Arroyo 111 edging Crothers
Memorial I, 20-19.
Tup scoring performance of the
night was turned in by Bob Pea
body of KA. He pushed in 18
points while showing the way for
his teammates with his ball-hawk
ing activities.
Hendricks Stars
John Hendricks poured 15
points through the hoop and Paul
Perko tallied 12 in Sigma Chl's
overwhelming win. The night be
fore, Sigma Chi's other team
romped to victory in another first
round game.
Arroyo Ill's conquest was a
slowly played affair with the mea
ger scoring evenly divided. Only
Joe Kullback, who scored nine of
Crothers' 19 points, tallied more
than five points.
In the key contest Trancos 11,
one of the top quintets in the play
offs, performed creditably most of
the time as it led from start to
finish. Its tall, rugged first string
was almost invincible on the back
boards as it captured 37 rebounds.
Height Pays Off
Center Stan Valentine, 6-8
"string bean, took 13 of them, while
Joe Saunders and Dick Mellen
garnered seven apiece. Saunders,
relying mainly on a jump shot,
was the outstanding scorer for
Trancos as he bucketed 17 points.
With Valentine rebounding and
Saunders scoring eight of the first
12 points, Trancos raced to a 13-6
lead and was never caught. Their
half-time margin was 21-15 and
Saunders was responsible for 11
i of them.
Hoagland Everywhere
Jack Hoagland, slender play
| maker for AKL, was everywhere
in the second half and almost suc
ceeded in closing the gap single
handedly. He topped AKL scorers
with 15 points- 10 in the second
half.
Hoagland started hitting his
j jump shots and sets with eight
minutes to go, and AKL pulled to
within three points of the unbeat
en frosh five. But: a short jumper
and a tip-in by Saunders put the
game out of reach. A driving lay

in by Jack Benjamin, with 30 sec
onds left, scored ihe final points
in the 47-38 win.
Trancos II was undefeated in
League 10 this season, winning
six straight games.
League 10 was a powerful group
that included such juggernauts
as Stern I and 11, Cedro I and
Madera 11.
But Valentine & Co. was just
too much lor the rest of the
league. In one game the towering i
Nevadan dunked 31 points.
Late scores had Beta Biz beat
ing Theta Delt, 40-8; Frosh Medics
I whipping Theta Xi I, 38-23; Zete
II swamping Crothers, 41-12; and
Delt I dumping El Capitan I, 55-23.
Considering that the teams in
Ih<* playoffs are supposedly the
cream of the* crop, first - round
playoff games so far have been
surprisingly one-sided.
No less than seven games have
been won by more than 20 points.
Sigma Chi I's 60-11 slaughter of
Stern 5 II was the biggest rout.
