# Tracksters to Venture to Los Angeles; Aim for Upset of Occidental College
## Indians Should Win Javelin Throw, Broad Jump, Two-Mile Run 
### 
Fresh from vi c to r ie s over
Fresno State and the Olympic*
Club, Couch Jack Weiershauscr's
traeksters will travel to Los An
geles Saturday to battle heavilj
favored Occidental College.
Though Occidental is tne favor
ite, comparative marks indicate
Stanford should win at least three
events, the two-mile, broad jump
and javelin throw.
In the two - mile, the Indians'
Maury Graves is expected to
romp home first. In the victory
over Fresno State, Graves reeled
off a 9:20 two-mile.
Best time for Occidental thus
far in that event is 9:34 by Ed
Lingan.
Hermann Favored
In the broad jump, former Pa
cific Coast Champion Frank Her
mann leaped 24 feet 3 inches in
the Olympic Club win and can
jump two feet farther than the
best Oxy broad jumper, W. Wil
liamson.
Stanford figures to finish one,
two in the javelin throw with
Kirk Nieland and Henry Roldan
leading the way.
Nieland and Roldan swamped
Fresno Slate by heaving the jave
lin 199 feet inches and 199 feet
2 inches respectively. Jn contrast,
Occidental is unusually weak in
this event.
Best mark is Lyle Crow's 180-4.
Oxy Domination
But the six other events for
which comparative marks exist
Occidental should dominate.
Among Coach Pay)on Jordan's
stars are Tom Meyer, shot put;
Kelly Hester, discus; B. Gutow
ski, pole vault; Dick Ifaddon, high
jump; and Billy Calling, 100 and
220.
Hester ranks as the second best
discus man on the coast with his
heave of IGS feet 2 inches.
Meyer has put the shot 57 feet
2'a inches and is expected to eas
ily outdistance the Card weight
men.
Haddon, a 6-foot (Pi-inch high
jumper, may receive a battle
from Stanford's Phil Fehlen. To
win his event against Fresno
State, Fehlen cleared the bar at 6
feet 5!4 inches.
Pole Vault
In the pole vault, Gutowski
should be all alone at 1 I feet G l *
inches.
Calling may emerge as a
double winner, having previously
clicked off a 9.8 century and a
21.2 220.
An interesting duel may shape
up in the 120-yard high hurdles.
Vying for first will be former
PCC Champ Bernie Nelson and
sophomore ace Chuck Cobb of
Stanford and Occidental's Ken
Biggs.
Biggs has turned in a 14.9 per
formance but Cobb is expected by
Weiershauser to skim the hurdles
this season in 14 flat.


LOOKING INTENTLY down the field, Occidental shot putter Tom
>leyer prepares to yet off one of his 57-foot heaves. Supervising
Meyer's efforts is Oxy Coach Payton Jordan, who will become
Stanford's track mentor next year. Saturday in Los Angeles. Occi
dental will meet Stanford.
