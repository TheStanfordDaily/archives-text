## Law School Loses First Hound of Regional Competition in Case of the Revealed Wig 
### Stan Gross 
Stanford Law School bowed to the University of San Francisco
last night in the first round of the Northern California State Junior
Bar Association Moot Court Competition.
The winning USF team last night comprised Harold Auerbaeh, a
third-year student, and James Brooke, James Hooper and Eugene

McDonald, all second - year stu-~
dents. Auerbach and Brooke ar
gued the case orally, whereas
Hooper and McDonald assisted in
writing the brief.
Arguing for Stanford were two
three-year students, Jack Brown
ing and Lauren Loveland. They
both argued their case and wrote
the brief.
The court last night consisted
of the Honorable Alfred W. Bow
en, judge of the Municipal Court
of Palo Alto, as Chief Justice,
anrl Stanley R. Evans and John
Lehman, attorneys of Palo Alto,
as Associate Justices.
Fact Involved
The case, Gunderson v. Scrib
bler, involved a tort, or civil in
jury. Scribbler wrote an obituary
notice for his newspaper concern
ing the death of Mrs. Randolph
Gunderson.
In t-he article he mentioned that
Mrs. Gunderson had worn a wig
for several years to cover a bald
; pate due to a case of scarlet fever.
The plaintiff - appellants in the
J case were her two survivors—her
i husband and son.
The Stanford team, counsel for
the appellants, argued lhat the
fact she had worn the wig was a
family secret. They contended that
publication of that fact caused the
appellants mental anguish and
I constituted an invasion of their
I privacy.
i
Not an Injury
As counsel for the respondents
in the case, the JJSF team con-
I tended that in fact the article did
not constitute an injury to the
I appellants either to the decedent
j or to her survivors.
The respondents argued that
tiie law of the right of privacy
would have to bejextended beyond
'its present meaning to cover this
lease, where relations of the in
, jured might claim damages.
They also argued that the fact
; that scarlet fever may cause bald
ness is newsworthy, and that by
light of freedom of the press, the
paper should be able to print such
matter.
The USt''' team will compete
against the winner of the CaJ
! Hastings contest in the second
round of the Northern California
, Moot Court Competition on April
i 11. Winner of that round will
travel to Los Angeles to argue
against the winner of the South
j ern California contest.

Fact Involved
The case, Gunderson v. Scrib
bler, involved a tort, or civil in
jury. Scribbler wrote an obituary
notice for his newspaper concern
ing the death of Mrs. Randolph
Gunderson.
In t-he article he mentioned that
Mrs. Gunderson had worn a wig
for several years to cover a bald
; pate due to a case of scarlet fever.
The plaintiff - appellants in the
J case were her two survivors—her
i husband and son.
The Stanford team, counsel for
the appellants, argued lhat the
fact she had worn the wig was a
family secret. They contended that
publication of that fact caused the
appellants mental anguish and
I constituted an invasion of their
I privacy.
i
Not an Injury
As counsel for the respondents
in the case, the JJSF team con-
I tended that in fact the article did
not constitute an injury to the
I appellants either to the decedent
j or to her survivors.
The respondents argued that
tiie law of the right of privacy
would have to bejextended beyond
'its present meaning to cover this
lease, where relations of the in
, jured might claim damages.
They also argued that the fact
; that scarlet fever may cause bald
ness is newsworthy, and that by
