# ACTION DELAYED
## LASSU Views Planned Social Rule Changes 
### 
Proposed changes in social reg
ulations drawn up by Social Co
ordinating Board were submitted
to Legislature Wednesday night,
and the body postponed action
pending discussion of the provi
sions in individual living groups.
The major alteration, according
to presidential assistant Edic
Flicker, involves changing the re
quirement for patrons for all
over-night and open functions to
that of "adult guests," emphasiz
ing their role as guests rather
than chaperones.
Selection of these guests would
be narrowed in that only mem
bers of the administration and
faculty, resident assistants, house
mothers and directors, parents of
sponsoring groups and fraternity
chapter advisers would be eli
gible.
In the past, outside patrons
could be invited.
Lute Hours
In a heated debate, Legislature
postponed decision on the propo
sal that all on-campus functions
held on week nights be over at
10 except for Registration dances.
It was agreed that late week
night functions do not concur
with an academic climate, but op
ponents of the proposal argued it
would be unfair to graduate slu
dents living on campus and that
affairs held in special social
rooms or separate buildings
would not bother students in resi
dences.
Under the new proposals, fines
are levied against groups holding
functions when Social Co-ordinat
ing Board has withheld approval.
Many Legislature members ar
gued that fines were too severe.
For CincinaScope
Legislature approved a loan of
$3000 for the installment of new
CinemaScope equipment for the
Sunday evening movies. The mon
ey will be repaid gradually from
the extra five cents charged for
admission.
ASSU President George Ralph
explained that he had sent a letter
to Congressman Charles Gubser
and Senators William Knowland
and Thomas Kuehel requesting
further information about a For
mosan student who refused to re
turn to Formosa where he was
still technically in the army and
was under threat of deportation
by the United States.
Letters promising further in
formal ion had been received from
the three officials.
