Stanford's no-longer-orphan crew opens its
season Saturday against the Trojans of USC at
the Redwood City \ acht Harbor.
An allowance of $3000 was given the crew
for the first time this year by the Athletic De
partment. This allowance can be taken as the
Athletic Board's public recognition of the crew
as a bona fide activity at Stanford.
Coach Lou Lindsay's rowers will also meet
Oregon State and California in meets this sea
son.
Also highlighting the sports scene was swim
ming sophomore Robin Moore's performance
in the NCAA championships at New Haven
last weekend.
Moore, who had never finished the 50-yard
race in under 23 seconds, tied Yale's Rex Au
brey in that event. The winning time was
:22.1.
Of Moore's ability, Coach Tom Haynie said,
"This boy has a very definite chance to make
the Olympic team. Right now he is not smooth
at all. He has a lot to learn."
