Housing Changes
Editor, The Daily:
Women students of Stanford, have you care
fully considered the changes in the housing sys
tem which you will soon be voting upon?
First, that all women students must draw every
spring quarter. E\ 'n inough you may be per
fectly satisfied with your present residence, you
still would have to draw and take the chance of
being forced to move.
Second, that seniors will be given preference
and may fill up to 75 per cent of the places in a
given residence. Seniors will also be given the
prerogative of drawing in blocks of five. Fresh
men and soph >mores will have little chance of
living where ihey would like if the residence they
prefer is also pre fn rred by many seniors.
Third, that freshmen and sophomores, when
they draw spring quarter, will draw on an equal
basis. Sophon. res will no longer be placed in
I heir residences before freshmen.
Fourth, that stuc>nts will not be allowed to
draw out of a residence during autumn or winter
quarters. Apparently only transfer students and
sponsors will fill vacancies that occur, and then
they, too, will have to draw at the end of the
year. Even if a student is very unhappy in her
residence, she will have to remain there for an
entire year.
What do these proposals mean? They mean
that when a girl draws for a residence, she will
have no idea with whom she will be living the
next year, except for the girl or girls she draws
with. In the small units this could be especially
difficult, since many girls might find that they
do not fit well into their new living groups, and
they might be unable to find or make friends
within their residence.

These proposals mean that there will be very
little carryover in a living unit from year to year,
and as a result, little group continuity. Most liv
ing groups have certain traditions, such as the
Lagunita Farm Fair and the Row Carnival. Most
living groups elect autumn quarter officers dur
ing spring quarter so that these officers may be
making plans over the summer. Traditions, elec
tion procedures and group continuity would be
disrupted by the proposed housing system.
Most important, these proposals would mean
the breaking up of close friendships that are
made in a living unit, since each living group
would be dissolved and started again every year.
Furthermore, small cliques may form, composed
of girls who draw into a residence together.
You may wonder why these changes are being
suggested. Apparently there has been some dif
ficulty in the past with the present system. Ap
parently some students have been unhappy be
cause they have been unable to draw into the
residence whore they would most like to live.
We are not claiming that the present system
is perfect, but we do believe that the proposed
system would be much worse and would make for
far more unhappiness than the one we have now.
Changes may be in order, but they can still be
made if these proposals are defeated.
We wonder why there has been so little pub
licity about these proposals. We feel that all
women students should have had a hand in shap
ing thorn. We wonder why freshman women will
not be allowed to vote for this system when they
must live under it for three years. We are sur
prised that it will only take a majority vote for
all of these changes to be adopted!
