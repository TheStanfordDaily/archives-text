# ‘Bad Seed’ Is Entertaining Despite Persistent Tedium
## Story of Homicidal Tendencies, Psychiatry Depicted in Current Curran Theatre Production 
### Richard Mende 
If anybody has overlooked the fact in the pressure of exams or
from the demands of vacationing, "Bad Seed," the story of a delight
fully diabolical little girl, is now in production at the Curran Theater
in San Francisco.
In its essential conception and as it is executed in its best moments

"Bad Seed" is an example of what
is known as "good theatre."
It is fascinating contemplating
a creature whose behavior falls
beyond the standard explanations
of psychology, sociology and crim
inology.
Rhoda is a girl born without
the ability to feel any warmth of
emotion or to develop a moral
conscience; when things annoy
her she has strong homicidal ten
dencies and she has the cunning
of a cobra.
It is frightening and exciting
to watch the candy-mannered Rho
da put on a bright smile, throw
her arms around her mother and
caress her face while the details
of her last murder are being pre
cociously thought over..
Nancy Kelly
The cast is fortunate in having
Nancy Kelly, whose natural
warmth shines through the part
of the mother whose terror in
creases as the evidence of her
daughter's fatal inheritance be
comes conclusive.
Although Miss Kelly may wish
to keep it her own professional
secret, it would ho interesting to
know how she can keep her part
so fresh after an extended run on
Broadway and an extensive road
show.
The weaknesses in the play are
so obvious that it is curious they
were not corrected earlier by the
author. The exposition in the first
act is unusually inept, and the de
tails piled on details produce the
expected tedium.
Acting Competent
The acting throughout is con
sistently competent, vy i th Ann
Shoemaker a delightful Monica
the upstairs neighbor and friend
whose three topics of conversa
tion are sex, psychiatry and pills.
Kimetha Laurie has poise and
devastating charm as Rhoda.
