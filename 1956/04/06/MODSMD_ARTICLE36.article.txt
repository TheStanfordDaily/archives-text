# On Campus With Max Shulman
## HOW TO BE A THUMPING BIG SUCCESS ON CAMPUS 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy with Cheek,” etc 
While up in the attic last week hiding 1 from a bill collector I
came across a letter, yellow now with ago, that dear old Dad had
sent me when I was a freshman. 1 read the letter again and
recalled, with many a sigh and not a few tears, what an inspira
tion it had been to me back in my freshman days. 1 reproduce it
below in the hope that it may light your way as it did mine.
"Dear Son, (Dad always called me Son. This was short for
Sonnenberg, which was originally my first name. 1 later traded
it with a man named Max. He threw in two outfielders and a left
handed pitcher ... But I digress.)
"Dear Son, (Dad wrote)
"1 suppose you are finding college very big and bewildering,
and maybe a little frightening too. Well, it need not be that
way if you will follow a few simple rules.
"First of all, if you have any problems, take them to your
teachers. They want to help you. That's what they are there for.
Perhaps they do seem rather aloof and forbidding, but that is
only because they are so busy. ou will find your teachers warm
as toast and friendly as pups if you will call on them at an hour
when they are not overly busy. Four a.m., for instance.
"Second, learn to budget your time. What with classes, activi
ties, studying, and social life all competing for your time, it is
easy to fall into sloppy habits. You must set up a rigid schedule
and stick to it. Remember, there are only 24 hours in a day.
Three of these hours are spent, in class. For every hour in class,
you must, of course, spend two hours studying. So there go six
more hours. Then, as everyone knows, for every hour of study
ing, you must spend two hours sleeping. That accounts for an
other twelve hours. Then there are meals two hours each for
breakfast and lunch, three hours for dinner. Never forget, Son
nenberg, you must chew each mouthful 2XB times. You show
me a backward student, and I'll show you a man who bolts
his food.
"But college is more than just sleeping, eating, and studying.
There are also many interesting and broadening activities, and
you would be cheating yourself if you neglected them. You'll
want to give at least an hour a day to the campus newspaper and
yearbook, and, of course, another hour each to the dramatic and
music clubs. And let's say a total of three hours daily to the
stamp club, the foreign affairs club, and the debating society.
Then, of course, a couple of hours for fencing and bird-walking,
a couple more for square dancing and basket weaving, ai]d one
or two for cribbage and ice-sculpturing.
"Finally, we come to the most important part of each day—what
I call 'The Quiet Time.' This is a period in which v you renew
yourself—just relax and think r/recn thoughts and smoke Philip
Morris Cigarettes.

"Why Philip Morris? because they are the natural comple
ment to an active lite; they are gentle, they are benign, they
are tranquil, they are a treat 1o the tired, a boon to the spent, a
haven to the storm-tossed. That's why.
"Well, Sonnenberg, I guess that's about all. Your mother sends
her love. She has just finished putting up rather a large batch
ol pickles—in fact, !>-)0,000 jars. I told her that with you away
at school, we would not need so many, but lovable old Mother
is such a creature of habit that though I hit her quite hard
several times, she insisted on going ahead.
Your ever lovin'
Dad."

Advice to freshmpu is not the business of the makers of I'hilip
Morris, sponsors of this column. Hut cigarettes for freshmen is. Also
cigarettes for upperclassmen, graduate students, profs, deans, and
everybody else who enjoys a gentle, modern smoke. We mean Philip
Morris, of corris!
