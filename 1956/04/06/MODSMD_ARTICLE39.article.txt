# Trustees Give Reasons for Accepting Responsibility of Governing Stanford
## 
### 
Why are Stanford's Trustees willing to give so
much of their time to govern Stanford without
compensation?
A few of the Board members tell why they grate
fully accepted the job:
James B. Black: "Probably the strongest factor
in my case is the sincere belief that it is of the ut
most importance to this country and our way of
life that non-tax-supported institutions be main
tained at the highest level of distinction; and fur
thermore, that there is an obligation on each of us
to do what we can to assist."
Charles R. Blyth: "I accepted, because through
the years I had been in California I came to look
upon this University as one of the great and grow
ing intellectual institutions in the United States.
Feeling that one derives the greatest, satisfaction
by trying to contribute something to a great ac
tivity of this kind, I made my start."
James F. Crafts: "I have always believed that !
should take an active interest in the community
in which I live and work, giving whatever time and
effort I could to worthy civic, educational and char
itable organizations."

John E. Cushing: "The association with a fine
group of men and women, the interest in the work
itself, and the feeling that one is paying back in a
small way what Stanford gave through fpur happy
years more than compensate for the time spent in
University service."
Leland VV. Cutler: "Being a Trustee of Stanford
University is the greatest honor that any man
could have and trusteeship is everything that the
word implies.
"Anyone would be proud to be elected a Trustee
involving as it does the responsibility for the suc
cess of a gr eat educational institution such as Stan
ford."
Ira S. Lillick: "My success in business stems
back almost directly to my training at Stanford.
Even with my 33 years on the Board I haven't
begun to pay back what I owe the University."
Donald J. Russell: "I feel that it is an honor to
serve the University as a member of the Board of
Trustees, both because of the importance of Stan
ford iir developing young men to be better able
to fill the need for capable leader's tomorrow, and
because, as a former Stanford student, I have a
close personal interest in the University."
