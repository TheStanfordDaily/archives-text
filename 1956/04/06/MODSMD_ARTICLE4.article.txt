# Japan's Kabuki Dancers To Close Concert Series
## 'Song-Dance-Skill' Tells Story Using Dance, Dialogue; Characters Motivated by Love, Fear 
### 
Japan's Azuma Kabuki Dancers and Musicians, whose first appear
ance in the Western world in 1954 created a sensation on Broadway,
will appear in Memorial Auditorium Sunday at 2:30 p.m. under the
auspices of the Stanford Conceit Series.
The unusual art form known as the "Ka Bu Ki" (a literal transla-

lion means "song-dance-skill") is
centuries old in Japan, where the;
dividing line between dance and j
drama is almost an invisible one. j
Kabuki dances tell a story lis- J
ing gesture, dance movement,
music and dialogue. Kabuki char
acters stem from the conflicts of
Japanese life and legend, motivat
ed by the tangible emotions of
love, hate, jealousy, humor and
fear of the supernatural.
Two of the most spectacular
characters are a spider, disguised
as a priest, who attempts to snare
his enemies in a web of hate and
a humorous dragon, addicted to
ear-twitching, eye-rolling and tail
scratching.
Although Japanese dancing is
as old as Japanese folklore, Ka
buki itself was born in the six
teenth century. In a Shinto tem
ple a shrine virgin named O-Kuni
added certain erotic innovations
to her prayer dances. The appeal j
was instantaneous, starting an j
entirely new dance form.
In O-Kuni's day men danced:
with women. After her death,'
however, women took over the
various companies, and thej
troupes became all-female. But
the morals of the troupes deterio
rated, and the government in 1628 j
decided to put an end to the danc-!
ing.
The next development was the |
Kakashu, or young men's Kabuki. j
These young men were so good as j
female impersonators that the
government decided to end this
practice also, and in 1652 the;
young men's Kab uk i were i
banned.
Their performance Sunday will
be the last feature on this year's
Concert Series program. Tickets
are sold out.
