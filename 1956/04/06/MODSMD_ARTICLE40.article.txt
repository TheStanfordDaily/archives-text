# Dinkelspiel Says Staff Makes His President's Job Pleasant
## 
### 
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel. President
of the Stanford Board of Trustees,
spends many days a month on his
job.
He had to hire another man for
his law firm in San Francisco so
he could devote more time to the
position.
Why does he do it ? Dinkelspiel
says:
"The duties of the President of
the Board are slightly greater
than those of the ordinary Board
member because, as in all organi
zations, decisions finally rest with
the top official and, although ad
vised and counseled by others, he
must, take the final step.
"However, my work as Presi
dent of the Board has been made
so pleasant because of the associ
ation with Dr. Sterling and his ex
ceptional staff, that it cannot be
classified as a burden.
"The members of the Board of
Trustees are exceptionally consci
entious and serious about their
work, even though, with few ex
ceptions, they are all otherwise
engaged in other activities. I
think they feel as I do that serv
ing a great University is a real
privilege."
"As to the work, the Board
before it annual problems, par-

I ticularly the balancing of a budget
which in over-all operation ap
proximates $13 million.
"There is present always the
consideration of the balance of
the proper number of students to
the facilities for their accommo
dation, and the adjustment of ac
tivities to the funds available.
"The gifts program and devel
opment of Stanford lands have
brought us increased revenues
which are much needed for the
; payment of current expenses, in
; eluding proper adjustments to fac
ulty salaries.
"The President of the Univer
sity and the Board of Trustees be
lieve that the University, with
these two programs proceeding
satisfactorily, is in a position to
balance the ordinary budget.
"However, the necessity of add
ing new buildings, such as dormi
tories. laboratories and the like,
and particularly the Medical
School, presents an altogether dif
ferent problem requiring unique
consideration in each case.
"Different sources of the funds
must be tapped for these pro
grams which are not part of the
j ordinary giving to the University
I or involved in the development of
I lands."

job.
He had to hire another man for
his law firm in San Francisco so
he could devote more time to the
position.
Why does he do it ? Dinkelspiel
says:
"The duties of the President of
the Board are slightly greater
than those of the ordinary Board
member because, as in all organi
zations, decisions finally rest with
the top official and, although ad
vised and counseled by others, he
must, take the final step.
"However, my work as Presi
dent of the Board has been made
so pleasant because of the associ
ation with Dr. Sterling and his ex
ceptional staff, that it cannot be
classified as a burden.
"The members of the Board of
Trustees are exceptionally consci
entious and serious about their
work, even though, with few ex
ceptions, they are all otherwise
engaged in other activities. I
think they feel as I do that serv
ing a great University is a real
privilege."
"As to the work, the Board
before it annual problems, par-

I ticularly the balancing of a budget
which in over-all operation ap
proximates $13 million.
"There is present always the
consideration of the balance of
the proper number of students to
the facilities for their accommo
dation, and the adjustment of ac
tivities to the funds available.
"The gifts program and devel
opment of Stanford lands have
brought us increased revenues
which are much needed for the
; payment of current expenses, in
; eluding proper adjustments to fac
ulty salaries.
"The President of the Univer
sity and the Board of Trustees be
lieve that the University, with
these two programs proceeding
satisfactorily, is in a position to
balance the ordinary budget.
"However, the necessity of add
ing new buildings, such as dormi
tories. laboratories and the like,
and particularly the Medical
School, presents an altogether dif
ferent problem requiring unique
consideration in each case.
"Different sources of the funds
must be tapped for these pro
grams which are not part of the
j ordinary giving to the University
I or involved in the development of
I lands."
