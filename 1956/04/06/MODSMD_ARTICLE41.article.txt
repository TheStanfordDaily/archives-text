# Waves Invade Diamond For Three Weekend Tilts
## Ray Young Pitching Choice for Series Opener; Top Hitters Stewart and Holzman Are Injured 
### 
The Pepperdine Waves move i
into Stanford's Sunken Diamond 1
this afternoon for a trio of games
with Coach Dutch Fehring's near- j
ly invincible 195 6 baseballers. I
Came time is 3:115 for today's con- j
test. A double-header is scheduled i
for- tomorrow, starting at 1:30.
Right-handed ace Ray Young
will be on the mound for the In
dians today in search of his fifth
victory of the season. He has lost
only once. Walt Payne and Ed
Verdurmen are the probable hurl-1
ers for the twin bill.
Though the local nine is play- j
ing with reserves in two spots, |
they should be able to extend their
season record to 10-2-1. However,
since the two injured regulars
Steve Stewart and Mickey Holz
man—are two of the club's top
hitters, the Cards will have to
fight for the wins.
Stewart Top Hitter
Stewart, who cracked a rib in j
the UCLA series last weekend, j
has been leading all the hitters ■
with a bat mark of .410. Holzman,
the speedy centerfielder, has bat
ted at a .368 clip while pacing the
team in stolen bases and runs
scored. He is nursing a sore shoul
der after being hit by a pitch in
bunting practice earlier in the
week.
The relief shortstop will be one J
of the sophomore pair of Ron I
Jones or Bob Flanders. Jones is a i
little fellow who seems to spend
all his time on the base paths. ;
Flanders is rated a strong hitter j
after leading the freshman team
in batting last year.
Holzman Hurt
Holzman is expected to be re
placed by little Bob Fletcher, who
will move over to center from his
regular rightfield position. Husky
A 1 Spurgeon will take Fletcher's
place.
Fletcher and Bob Evans have
also been hitting well over the .300
mark in the first 15 games.
"Fleteh," one of the smallest men |
on the team, has been smashing j
out a .392 average, while co-cap
tain Evans is hitting .333, includ- 1
ing four triples.
One of the most encouraging;
notes in the statistics released
yesterday was the team's over-all;
batting average of .295.
Admission is free to all three of j
the games in the series, which will !
be played on the Sunken Diamond.!
Injuns Lead
