# Braves Tally Winning Run On Error
## Looney Pitches Well; West Hits Twice As Modesto Falls, 4-3 
### 
The Stanford Braves used a
wild throw to push, across the
winning run in the last of the
eighth inning against Modesto JC
yesterday to take a 4-3 victory.
Roy Looney pitched the dis
tance, throwing only 93 pitches
and allowing only one earned run.
He seemed to improve as he went
on until the final three innings,
when he retired the visiting Pi
rates in rapid order. Looney also
contributed to the Braves' eight
hit attack with a line drive double
in the second stanza.
Stanford edged across the de
ciding run in an extremely tainted
manner in their eighth-inning ral
ly. Buzz Iloff started the inning
with a single off the first-base
man's glove and then moved down
to second on Ron Jones' timely
drag bunt.
Pickoff Goes Awry
As centerfielder Wayne West
struck out, the Modesto catcher's
pickoff attempt on Hoff rolled
into centerfield and Buzzy raced
all the way around to score.
West had hit twice earlier to
play a major part in the first
three runs for Coach Bill Arce's
nine. He was safe on an error and
moved around to score in the first
inning. The husky little fielder
bashed a triple and tripped across
the plate on A 1 Spurgeon's single.
Stolen Bases
Stolen bases were the keynote
of the third run in the sixth frame.
The Braves had been trailing- 3-2,
but a double steal by West and
Ron Jones tied the score.
Modesto jammed all three of
their runs into the third inning
on three singles and an error.
