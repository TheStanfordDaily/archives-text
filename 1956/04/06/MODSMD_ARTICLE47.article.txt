# Stanford Oarsmen Open Year Against Southern California
## USC Out to Avenge Last Season's Swamping In 11:30 a.m. Regatta in Redwood City Harbor 
### 
Coach Lou Lindsay's Stanford ,
crew will make their initial ap
pearance of the season tomorrow
against USC in the only home re
gatta of the year.
This will be the first of two 1
meetings between the two shells;
the second will be at San Pedro j
in a triangular meet involving
UCLA later in the year.
The USC crew will be out to
avenge the double defeats handed
them by the Indians last year as
they row over the regular Olym
pic course of 2000 meters in Red
wood City.
Both the Junior Varsity and the
Frosh will row in preliminary
races before the 11:30 a.m. Var
sity encounter. The Braves take
the water at 10:30 and the Frosh
squads follow at 11.
Card coach Lindsay has been
having trouble filling out the crew
in the first shell since John Schu
macher, Bob Clark and Captain
Gordon Best have been out of ac
tion. However, yesterday after
noon he released a tentative align

ment which is subject to further
change. The first nine are:
William Clark, stroke; Jim
Roodhouse, seven; Pete Haywood,
six; Si Morrison, five; John Reich
mann, four; James Clever, three;
John Painter, two; Will Stinson,
one; Calvin Gogerty, coxswain.
This is the first season, since
moving to their new location on
Redwood Creek in Redwood City,
that the crew has been able to
hold afternoon fall practices. A
special group of practices was
held before Christmas vacation,
stressing technique alone. Regu
lar practice started at the first of
winter quarter.
The course, scene of this week
end's regatta, finishes near the
Stanford Shellhouse, on the Red
wood City Yacht Harbor.
