# Stanford Trackmen Face Rugged Test In Payton Jordan's Occidental Tigers
## Cinder Meet in Southern California Expected to Go Down to Mile Relay Herrmann, Roldan, Cobb, Nelson Pace Indians; Tiger Outfit Strong in Weights, Pole Vault 
### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
Stanford's varsity track team
gets its first real test of the sea
son tomorrow afternoon at Eagle
Rock when they are entertained
by the potent Occidental Tigers.
The meet figures to be very
close with a possibility existing
lhat the relay could decide it.
Payton Jordan will be sending
his charges against Stanford for
the last time before coming to the
Farm next year. Jordan will re
place Indian cinder coach Jack
Weiershauser, who is retiring to
enter private business.
Last year Jordan masterminded
his thinelads to a narrow 66-65
victory over the Tribe. Weiers
hauser will be seeking revenge in
his last season at the helm for
Stanford.
Stanford looks toughest in this
meet in the sprints, hurdles, jave
lin and-broad jump.
Sprint Duel
A real duel is shaping up in the
sprints, where Jim Saras and
Frank Herrmann of Slanfcr'd will
match strides against Oxy's Bill
Calling and Larry Newquist. All
four are capable of running the
century in under 10 seconds.
John Zetzman of the Tigers will
add even more competition in the
furlong.
Zetzman and his quarter-mile
running mate. Lanny Carter, may
face more than they can handle
in Stanford's 440 trio. Chuck Ince
is the Tribe's best, but Bill Carls
and Jim Luttrell are also very
line middle-distance runners.
Luttrell, a hurdler last year, is
running the quarter to train for
the Olympics. Instead of the 220-
yard hurdles as American colleges
run, the international games fea
ture a 400-meter hurdle race. This
is roughly equivalent to a quarter
mile.
Occidental's trio of Eddie Shinn,

I Chauncey Pa and Ty Hartley
should run off with a sweep in
the 880.
The distance events shape up
as a battle between Stanford's
Maury Graves and a host of Ti
mers. The Jordanmen are Hartley,
j Larry VVray, Eel Lingan and Bucl
| Stokesbary.
The Indians' Bernie Nelson and
Chuck Cobb could run 1-2 in both
: hurdles races. If Newqujst skips
the 22(J in favor 1 of the low bar
; riers, an exciting duel can be ex
pected there.
In the field. Oxy. has sure win
! ners in the pole vault, shot and
: discus, w hile Stanford has the
broad jump and javelin sewed up.
, The high jump could go either
: way.
I!-() Vaulter
Bob Gutowski looks like a shoo
in in t he pole vault with a best of
over 14-6. Stanford's Hi 11 Flint
managed to tie the Tiger ace last
i year at 13-6 and hit that same
| nr.rk last weekend.
Tom Meyer and Kelly Hester
should pretty well dominate the
I weight events for the Jordanmen.
Meyer h&s bests of 57-2% in the
shot and 153-0 in the discus. Hes
ter has thrown the platter 165-2.
A1 Cheney in 1 he shot and Jim
Truher in the discus have little
: chance of winning but they should
pick up second places for the
| Tribe.
Spear Throwers
Hank Rolrtan and Kirk Nieland
I are a solid bet to finish 1-2 in the
( javelin. Both can throw 200 feet,
! which is well ahead of Oxy's best,
Lyle Crow, who boasts a 180-4.
Frank Herrmann of Stanford
will probably be ihe only thinelad
| in the meet to better 23 feet in the
broad jump. Frank will probably
i have no trouble getting over 24.
Occidental's Dick Haddon and
| Phil Fehlen of Stanford are ex
pected to stage a battle in the

high jump. Both can clear around
6-6. Jon Jamison and Gary Jeff
ries of the Tigers will duel for
third place.
The Tigers w i th a probable
team of Shinn. Happy Hicks, ('al

slight edge over Stanford'* quar
tet of Myron Hollister, Carls. Lut

i year at 13-6 and hit that same
| nr.rk last weekend.
Tom Meyer and Kelly Hester
should pretty well dominate the
I weight events for the Jordanmen.
Meyer h&s bests of 57-2% in the
shot and 153-0 in the discus. Hes
ter has thrown the platter 165-2.
A1 Cheney in 1 he shot and Jim
Truher in the discus have little
: chance of winning but they should
pick up second places for the
| Tribe.
Spear Throwers
Hank Rolrtan and Kirk Nieland
I are a solid bet to finish 1-2 in the
( javelin. Both can throw 200 feet,
! which is well ahead of Oxy's best,
Lyle Crow, who boasts a 180-4.
Frank Herrmann of Stanford
will probably be ihe only thinelad
| in the meet to better 23 feet in the
broad jump. Frank will probably
i have no trouble getting over 24.
Occidental's Dick Haddon and
| Phil Fehlen of Stanford are ex
pected to stage a battle in the

high jump. Both can clear around
6-6. Jon Jamison and Gary Jeff
ries of the Tigers will duel for
third place.
The Tigers w i th a probable
team of Shinn. Happy Hicks, ('al
ter and Zetzman seem to have a
slight edge over Stanford'* quar
tet of Myron Hollister, Carls. Lut
trell and Ince.
