# AWS Housing Proposes New Drawing Policy
## Women Would Draw Every Spring Quarter For New Residence 
### 
I A now housing policy and
! drawing system for women stu-
S dents has been proposed by AVVS
Housing Evaluation Committee
to moot needs of increasing num
bers of women students and cor
rect the inequities existing under
the present system.
The first major change is de
signed to make the system more
democratic, so that all women
have an equal opportunity every
year to get the living group of
their choice.
To accomplish this goal every
one will enter the drawing each
(spring rather than some remain
| ing in their present dorms. Worn
i en may draw back into their pres
ent living groups but have the
same chance as anyone else to
do so.
Old System
Under the old housing system,
: living groups were supposedly or
; ganized in a 3-2-1 ratio of seniors,
juniors and sophomores. Mow-
I ever, this plan did not work out
! at all in practice.
In the proposed system senior
I women would be given preference
I in two ways. A 75 per cent maxi
mum senior limit would be set for
each house and they may draw in
groups of six for their senior
year.
Future sophomores and juniors
would draw together as one class
i under this plan. The present sys
tem provides for separate draw
ing. with juniors given prefer
ence.
Other Changes
Other proposed changes include
a single spring drawing so that
women move only once a year.
There would be no between-qua r
iters drawing, and shrink ;i g e
would be only over the summer.
Mid-year vacancies in living
groups would be filled in January
by off-campus women, transfers
and returning students, and in
March by sponsors ahd returning
J students.
This-new plan will be discussed
in the next two living group
house meetings. April <Â» and 16,
with at least one Housing Com
mittee member present in each
: group.
Women students, with the ex
ception of freshmen, will vote on
this proposal during the week of
April 16.
Brenda Sorey is chairman of
the Housing Evaluation Commit
i tee.
