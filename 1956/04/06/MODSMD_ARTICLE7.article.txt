I Special tn the Stim/ord Dully
A resolution to investigate con
: ditions on the island of Cyprus
was approved by the "ad hoc" Po-
I litical Committee of the sixth an- j
nual Model United Nations at Cor- j
| vallis, Oregon, yesterday.
The resolution will be placed
J before the General Assembly to- !
morrow. If adopted, a commission !
representing ten neutral nations
, would spend four months investi- j
| gating conditions on Cyprus.
The 15-member Stanford dele- j
gation representing Israel at the
Model UN holds seats in the Po- j
litical and Security Committee; :
Social, Cultural and Humanitari
i an Committee; Trusteeship Com
j mittce and also the "ad hoc" Po- i
j litical Committee.
Israel's prime concern is her
j national existence, according to
- delegation chairman Chuck Revn- j
i olds. Therefore, in the United Na-1
I lions her principal job is combat- j
| ing the very strong Arab bloc in i
their declared aim to drive the j
| state of Israel into the sea.
Israel's delegation has been sue- j
; cessful in placing her case for the\j
! censure of Egypt for holding up j
j Israeli shipping in the Suez Canal j
before the International Court of I
Justice.
The Arab claim is that such 1
shipping is intended to increase
the military strength of Israel.
"We are fighting to disprove
this," said Reynolds. "This should ;
not be a difficult task since the !
'Bat Galim' was in actuality car-;
rying animal hides, lumber and j
other very domestic cargoes when !
it was seized by Egypt. Our posi-1
tion seems quite hopeful."
Reynolds himself has been ac-1
tive on the executive committee I
which is drafting the Model UN \
Charter, which will be signed by i
all participating schools in a cere- j
mony at the General Assembly.
Purpose of this charter is to
j state more formally the associa
: tion of Western schools in the
Model UN, which has been in er
j istence for the past six years.
According to Reynolds, George
Papadoupolo, Executive Secretary
of the sixth session, has done an
outstanding job in preparation for
this year's conference.
The delegation expects to re
turn Sunday night.
