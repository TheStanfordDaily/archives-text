# Tresidder Concert Is 'Year's Best'
## Mozart's Mass Called Major Work, Includes Soloists and Chorus 
### Stew Toy 
The Stanford Chorus and Choir
and San Francisco Symphony
combined their talents last night
in the finest concert presented at
Stanford this year.
The occasion was the Tresidder
Memorial Concert, held in Memo
rial Church and honoring the
memory of Stanford's fourth
president, Donald Bertram! Tres
idder.
Under the increasingly able di
rection of Enrique Jorda, the
Symphony opened the program
with Ralph Vaughn Williams'
"Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas
Tallis."
In this selection, Vaughn Wil
liams again seems to meditate on
his übiquitous and ethereal Uto
pia. The music is calmly reflec
tive but ponderous, and Jorda
conducted it with a fine sense of
these qualities.
Excellent Form
Two sections of Monteverdi's
"Vespro della Beata Virgine" fol
lowed, with the Stanford Choir
joining the orchestra. The choir
was in excellent form, but the or
chestra's rather muddy brass sec
tion was distracting.
The major work of the evening
was Mozart's tremendous Mass
in C Minor, with the Stanford
Chorus. Soloists were Phyllis
Althof, soprano; Ruth Roehr, so
prano; Stanley Noonan, baritone;
and James Schwabacher, tenor.
In the first choral sections of
the "Credo" and "Sanctus" Jorda,
the Chorus and Mo/art reached
their highest achievements of the
work.
The performance of these sec
tions was inspiring and flawless
and full of Mozart's almost over
powering majesty, although the
Sanctus' shod obligato for un
accompanied steam pipe was un-
Outstanding Soloists
The soloists were also outstand
ing. Miss Althof was particularly
exceptional.
The final "Hosanna" section
was possibly too powerful, and
Jorda's direction seemed a bit
speedy—but these defects are de
batable. On the whole the Mass
was extremely well done.
The only major criticism of the
concert could be the acoustics of
Memorial Church, which left
something to be desired, and the
placement of the orchestra. The
echo effect in the Vaughn Wil
liams fantasia was partially lost,
and the orchestra itself Often
sounded distorted during soft
passages.
Choir and chorus director Har
old Schmidt deserves congratula
tions for his work with the two
groups. No praise is too high for
their performances last night.

The major work of the evening
was Mozart's tremendous Mass
in C Minor, with the Stanford
Chorus. Soloists were Phyllis
Althof, soprano; Ruth Roehr, so
prano; Stanley Noonan, baritone;
and James Schwabacher, tenor.
In the first choral sections of
the "Credo" and "Sanctus" Jorda,
the Chorus and Mo/art reached
their highest achievements of the
work.
The performance of these sec
tions was inspiring and flawless
and full of Mozart's almost over
powering majesty, although the
Sanctus' shod obligato for un
accompanied steam pipe was un-
Outstanding Soloists
The soloists were also outstand
ing. Miss Althof was particularly
exceptional.
The final "Hosanna" section
was possibly too powerful, and
Jorda's direction seemed a bit
speedy—but these defects are de
batable. On the whole the Mass
was extremely well done.
The only major criticism of the
concert could be the acoustics of
Memorial Church, which left
something to be desired, and the
placement of the orchestra. The
echo effect in the Vaughn Wil
liams fantasia was partially lost,
and the orchestra itself Often
sounded distorted during soft
passages.
Choir and chorus director Har
old Schmidt deserves congratula
tions for his work with the two
groups. No praise is too high for
their performances last night.
The Stanford Chorus and Choir
and San Francisco Symphony
combined their talents last night
in the finest concert presented at
Stanford this year.
The occasion was the Tresidder
Memorial Concert, held in Memo
rial Church and honoring the
memory of Stanford's fourth
president, Donald Bertram! Tres
idder.
Under the increasingly able di
rection of Enrique Jorda, the
Symphony opened the program
with Ralph Vaughn Williams'
"Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas
Tallis."
In this selection, Vaughn Wil
liams again seems to meditate on
his übiquitous and ethereal Uto
pia. The music is calmly reflec
tive but ponderous, and Jorda
conducted it with a fine sense of
these qualities.
Excellent Form
Two sections of Monteverdi's
"Vespro della Beata Virgine" fol
lowed, with the Stanford Choir
joining the orchestra. The choir
was in excellent form, but the or
chestra's rather muddy brass sec
tion was distracting.
