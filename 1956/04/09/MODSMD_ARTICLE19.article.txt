ami drawing system for Stanford's women stu

This new .system is designed to make the
women's housing program more democratic
and to eliminate "frustrations" found in the
present one, according to Committee members.
I he changes provide that all women students
must draw at the end of each spring quarter;
senior women may draw in groups of six; a 7.»
per cent maximum senior limit will be set for
each house; sophomores and juniors (this
year's freshmen and sophomores) will draw as
one elasss; there will be no between-quarters
drawing; and shrinkage will take place only in
the summer.
These proposals will he voted on during the
week of April 16. No freshmen will he per
mitted to vote.
\\ e do not approve of this system. We do
not think that it will remedy any defects in the
present housing program; rather, we expect
dial it will multiply them.
I he goal of making the housing program
more d< mocratic is a laudable one, and we
agree that if all women are forced to draw
;it the end of every year, there would he a
mueh greater chance for women to draw into
some houses. This may he democracy hut there
are other considerations.
II a woman student is happy in her resi
dence, we do riot think it is right that she
should he forced to move elsewhere. Further
more. if there is a complete turnover of resi

dents in each house every vear, the houses will
lose all traditions ami become mere "places to
live.**
I h«' Housing (Committee is betraying its goal
of "more democracy" by setting a maximum of
75 per cent seniors iu each house and permit
ting seniors to draw iu groups of six. Seniors
would be given practically unlimited prefer
ence and the juniors and sophomores, half of
Stanford's women students, would be shunted
into whatever space remained.
The end result of these proposals would be
that freshmen would live where the University
placed them, sophomores and juniors would be
flung into any available space that the seniors
did not want, and seniors would be given com
plete and total choice. No woman student
would be given much preference as to where
she would live until her senior year and one
year of preference does not make up for three
years of no choice at all.
We do not approve of the proposal abolish
ing between-quarters drawing, it is not right,
nor democratic, for a woman to be placed in
one house for an entire year if she finds herself
unhappy there.
Finally, we question tlu* forbidding of a
vote to the freshman women. They are the
ones who will he most affected by these
changes and certainly, denying them a vote

The Housing Evaluation Committee should

ami drawing system for Stanford's women stu
dents.
This new .system is designed to make the
women's housing program more democratic
and to eliminate "frustrations" found in the
present one, according to Committee members.
I he changes provide that all women students
must draw at the end of each spring quarter;
senior women may draw in groups of six; a 7.»
per cent maximum senior limit will be set for
each house; sophomores and juniors (this
year's freshmen and sophomores) will draw as
one elasss; there will be no between-quarters
drawing; and shrinkage will take place only in
the summer.
These proposals will he voted on during the
week of April 16. No freshmen will he per
mitted to vote.
\\ e do not approve of this system. We do
not think that it will remedy any defects in the
present housing program; rather, we expect
dial it will multiply them.
I he goal of making the housing program
more d< mocratic is a laudable one, and we
agree that if all women are forced to draw
;it the end of every year, there would he a
mueh greater chance for women to draw into
some houses. This may he democracy hut there
are other considerations.
II a woman student is happy in her resi
dence, we do riot think it is right that she
should he forced to move elsewhere. Further
more. if there is a complete turnover of resi

dents in each house every vear, the houses will
lose all traditions ami become mere "places to
live.**
I h«' Housing (Committee is betraying its goal
of "more democracy" by setting a maximum of
75 per cent seniors iu each house and permit
ting seniors to draw iu groups of six. Seniors
would be given practically unlimited prefer
ence and the juniors and sophomores, half of
Stanford's women students, would be shunted
into whatever space remained.
The end result of these proposals would be
that freshmen would live where the University
placed them, sophomores and juniors would be
flung into any available space that the seniors
did not want, and seniors would be given com
plete and total choice. No woman student
would be given much preference as to where
she would live until her senior year and one
year of preference does not make up for three
years of no choice at all.
We do not approve of the proposal abolish
ing between-quarters drawing, it is not right,
nor democratic, for a woman to be placed in
one house for an entire year if she finds herself
unhappy there.
Finally, we question tlu* forbidding of a
vote to the freshman women. They are the
ones who will he most affected by these
changes and certainly, denying them a vote
cannot he considered "democratic."
