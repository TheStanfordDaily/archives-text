## Housing Change Reply 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Women students of Stanford, in answer to your
letter of last Friday; yes, we have considered the
changes in the housing system which will soon be
voted upon.
First, it is a privilege that all women students—
rather than only those who are dissatisfied with
their present residences draw each spring, thus
affording all women equal opportunity to live in
the residence of their preference.
Second, although sophomores and juniors have
less chance to live in a preferred area, their
chances as seniors under the new system are al
most unlimited.
Are you efraid that you are not mature enough
as college women to be able to adjust to the resi
dence in which you find yourselves? Was your
freshman >.»ar sc unbearable? Are you afraid
that you will 1 ive to make some new friends if
yoif change rt ulences every year? We feel that
one residence per quarter is instability, one year
is stability, and morp than two years is stagna
tion.
"Most important, these proposals would mean

the breaking up of close friendships thai are
made in a living unit. . . Just how close is a
friendship which can be dissolved when the
friends are separated by a few blocks? What are
you going to do over the summer? Also, could
cliques that might be formed by small groups
drawing together into a residence be worse than 1
carry-over cliques?
Furthermore, how likely is it that a group of
six drawing together would form a clique? Most
girls want more than six friends.
"We wonder why there has been so little pub
licity about these proposals." In spite of poor
publicity, it seems you have had little difficulty
in finding out about the proposals disclosed on
the same day as your rebuttal.
And, yes, wouldn't it have been wonderful if
all women could have had a hand in shaping the
policy in a marathon discussion at Frost Amphi
theater?
