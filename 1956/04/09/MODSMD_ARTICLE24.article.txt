League member Harold Roberts
asked, "Are Palo Alto people to
be taxed to provide traffic facili
ties for Stanford's industrial de
velopment ?"
Another League member, Har
old Kay, said, "We're stuck with
the Stanford industrial develop
ment; it's running amok."
Commenting on, the League
meeting, Stanford Business Man
ager Aif E. Brandin denied that
the industrial development was
running amok and that Palo Alto
citizens had to pay taxes to pro
vide for Stanford facilities.

company, has to provide facilities,
