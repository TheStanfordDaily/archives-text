# Kiyohime and Hats
## 
### 

Tokuho Azuma IV as "Kiyohime" dances with red "kasa" hats and
recalls happy memories of her girlhood in Japan's Azuma Kabuki
Dancers performance in Memorial Auditorium yesterday. The Ka
buki group, currently on their second American tour, played to an
overflow audience at Stanford as the last feature of this year's
ASSU Concert Series. The group opens tomorrow night for a six
day engagement at San Francisco's Cur ran Theater.
