## Indians Undefeated Since Moving to Present 2000-Meter Course in Redwood City Harbor 
### 
Stanford's varsity crew continued its domination of Redwood City
Harbor waters Saturday by sweeping to a one-half-length victory
over Southern California.
It was the ninth annual dual-meet victory over the Smogland oars
men for the Indians, who arc undefeated on the 2000-meter course

since moving there last season.
Hundreds of spectators lined
the shores to see Coach Lou Lind
sey's sophomore-manned shell
stave off a late rally by USC to
win in (5:28 on a choppy, windy
course.
In earlier races, the Stanford
freshmen breezed to an easy 3-
length triumph over the SC frosh
in 6:54, and the Trojans nipped
out a 6-foot victory in the junior
varsity opener in 6:39.

With three of his veterans on
the sick list, Lindsey put six soph
omores, a junior and a senior at
(he varsity oars and then watched

spite a fast-moving SC crew at
the finish.
Stanford opened with a 32-
stroke and then settled to a steady
30 count as they opened up a full
length at halfway. USC started
fast at 37, but at the 1000-meter
mark was down to a 29.
The Trojans turned on the pres
sure in the home stretch, but there
was still a half-length gap at the
finish and the Indians had won.
