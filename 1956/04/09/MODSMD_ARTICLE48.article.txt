TIIKKF SKIICKS OF the Chico Water Ski Club pass pyramid style
in front of Lake Lagunita's boat house at last Saturday's water
carnival. Presented by the junior class to publicize their April 20
prom, the carnival included some 20 skiers who brought applause
from the crowds on the shoreline when they performed such stunts
as jumping the wake, skiing with undersized 12-inch skis and ski
dancing a water ballet. â€”Daily photo by George Phelps.
