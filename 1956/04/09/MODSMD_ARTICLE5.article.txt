Watching two slim shells glide
over the water here in Redwood
City Harbor, one wonders at the
sheer beauty of crew racing.
Eight oars dip into the ruffled
blue surface in precision timing,
and the thin craft sho.ots ahead
toward a well-calculated goal.
Eight men straining every mus
cle, contorting their faces on each
pull and sweating profusely in the
morning sun as they follow the
harsh commands of a coxswain
perched in the stern, megaphone
clasped over his mouth.
A wind whips roughly across
the press launch following closely
behind the two crews, and binocu
lars are raised to catch the strain
and precision that are the s r port.
Close by shoots the official out-1
board boat, spewing foajji behind j
it carefully away from the course (
of the oarsmen. The coach, weal
ing a bright red jacket, follows
closely every stroke like a field
general overseeing a battle.
With a stopwatch in one hand 1
and a public address mike in the {
other, a crew member is keeping i
fans at the finish line informed j
of the strokes and progress of
each shell.
"I felt that last start my stom
ach turned over just like I was
in the shell," he comments later.;
Now the shells have rounded
the turn and are on the finish
stretch. From the shore come the ;
cheers of fans as the end ap- j
p roaches.
As victory is signaled, the press
launch blasts its horn in celebra- j
tion, camera • carrying onlookers
give a shout and the crews sym-1
bolically toss their coxswains in
the cold water.
Another regatta has reached its j
climax.
