# Students Return to Tell Of Model UN Experiences
## Stanford Represents Israel in Conference Where Tone Was Formed Before It Had Begun 
### Wally Simpson 
The sixth annual Model United Nations got under way on the
evening of April 4, with opening addresses by former Governor of
Oregon Charles Sprague, former United States alternate delegate to
the United Nations, who presided over the General Assembly of the
Model United Nations, and Dr. Frank Munk,.international economics

-expert from Reed College, who
spoke on "The Coming UN."
But even before the opening ad
dresses had been made the lone of
the conference had been formed
I in early caucuses among the pow
er blocs such as NATO, SEATO
and others.
Israel, represented by Ihe Stan
ford delegation, tried hs did oth
ers to become part of the cau
cuses but was rebuffed by all the
major blocs except for occasional
questions as to the delegation's
I stand on certain issues.
In the cloakrooms and Ihe hall
ways the major powers were
quite willing and ready to express
their deepest sympathies toward
Israel's fight for national exist
j ence. But neither on the floor nor
j in the committees did any great
power come forward to support
Israel in any resolution she
brought up.
The reason? Arab oil.
Israel Fights Back
But Israel fought back. She
won a censure of Egypt in the In
ternational Court of Justice in
what has been described and
| lauded as "a brilliant piece of rep
| resentation and argumentation"
by Israel's delegate to the court,
! freshman Steve Breyer.
But the greatest proof of the
I Stanford delegation's efforts at
the Model UN was their ability
in the committees and on the
floor to keep resolutions detri
mental to Israel from passing.
The greatest opposition to Is
; rael was from the Arab nations.
The delegates from these states
were very aggressive and used a
lot of emotionalism in their strat
egy at the session.
Two-Minute Silence
When news reached the Model
UN of the fighting along the Gaza
border strip the Arabs introduced
resolutions into all committee
meetings calling for a two-min
ute silence in tribute to those
Egyptians who had lost their
lives.
Following the open in g ad
dresses chief delegates of the five
major pow e r s made short
speeches to the General Assem
! blv. The delegate from China,
I represented by University of Ore
' gon, made a violent attack on
Russia. The chief Russian dele
gate from San Jose State pro
: tested three limes, finally suc
ceeding on the third try in forc
ing China's delegate from the
floor before he had finished his
address.
All debates on current happen
ings gave every indication that
; most of Ihe delegations appeared
to have assimilaled quile well the
character and national feelings of
their assigned nations.
