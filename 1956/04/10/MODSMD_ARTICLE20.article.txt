# Negro College Student Body Boycotts Classes In Protest To Investigation of
## None of 1498 Students Go To Classes 'Peaceful Strike' Is Latest in Segregation Controversy Series 
### 
ORANGEBURG, S. C., April 9
I (UP) The entire student body at
j South Carolina State College for
: Negroes boycotted classes today
in apparent protest against a plan
ned state investigation of campus
activities of the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People.'
The "peaceful strike" was the
latest episode in a series of dis
putes over the segregation issue
at the state-supported institution
and at a neighboring chu r c h
school, Clal'lin College for Ne
groes.
Although none of the 1198 stu
dents appeared willing to say so,
the walkout was apparently in
protest against a resolution pass
ed by the South Carolina legisla
ture and calling for a legislative
investigation of NAACP activity
at South Carolina State.
No One in Classes
James Robinson, a junior at the
Negro college, said everybody at
the coed institution was out of
classes "indefinitely."
"Nobody feels like going to
class," he said, but added there
was "no particular reason."
Wallace C. Bethea, chairman of
the board of trustees, said the
student body had been scheduled
to resume classes today after the
Easter vacation, and the students
not in classrooms would be mark
ed "absent."
He agreed the strike was 100
per rent effective.
"Heard Nothing"
Dr. B. C. Turner, college presi
dent, said he had "not yet met
with student leaders" and he had
"heard nothing from them yet."
The college campus has been
under police surveillance since
Saturday by order of Gov. George
Bell Timmerman Jr., who said he
had been informed that "certain
subversive elements" planned a
demonstration.
Claflin College students also
have demonstrated in sympathy
with State College students. For
a brief time they picketed the
stores of white merchants, and
members of both student bodies
have boycotted white stores since
the merchants joined the pro-seg
regation white citizens' councils.
The student strike is the second
in the South to be tied directly to
the segregation issue. A boycott
of segregated buses at Montgom
ery, Ala., is now in its nineteenth
week.

Easter vacation, and the students
not in classrooms would be mark
ed "absent."
He agreed the strike was 100
per rent effective.
"Heard Nothing"
Dr. B. C. Turner, college presi
dent, said he had "not yet met
with student leaders" and he had
"heard nothing from them yet."
The college campus has been
under police surveillance since
Saturday by order of Gov. George
Bell Timmerman Jr., who said he
had been informed that "certain
subversive elements" planned a
demonstration.
Claflin College students also
have demonstrated in sympathy
with State College students. For
a brief time they picketed the
stores of white merchants, and
members of both student bodies
have boycotted white stores since
the merchants joined the pro-seg
regation white citizens' councils.
The student strike is the second
in the South to be tied directly to
the segregation issue. A boycott
of segregated buses at Montgom
ery, Ala., is now in its nineteenth
week.
