In many areas of the country, college editors

Student leaders are fighting for the right to

of 32 teachers for refusal to sign the Hoard of
Regents' speeial loyalty oath.
Although functioning primarily iu the edu
cational sphere, academic freedom logically re
lates to the very quality of American society,
for within the walls of its schools and colleges,
the minds of its citizens are trained to think
independently and creatively.
A society which expects to mold the minds
of its younger generation to conform with its

it has created docile, non-thinking persons un
able lo cope with new problems or protect
their dignity as individuals.
The task of the student in the present cli
mate of conformity and resignation is a large
one, hut the very challenge it entails is vital
lo the existence of American democracy.

able lo cope with new problems or protect
their dignity as individuals.
The task of the student in the present cli
mate of conformity and resignation is a large
one, hut the very challenge it entails is vital
lo the existence of American democracy.
