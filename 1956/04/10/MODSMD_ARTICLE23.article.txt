## Administration Moves to Control UCLA Student Council Activities 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
I lie UCLA administration, which last year
look control of the editorial policies of the
Daily Bruin, is making the same move in re
gard to the university's student council.
ASUCI.A last week rejected a directive from
the Dean of Students' office, which created five
new council positions and abolished seven oth
ers. The directive also asked next year's coun
cil to draw up a new constitution to submit to
the university chancellor.
The directive's slated purpose is the con
tinuance of democratic student government.
However, the administration also wishes to
clarify the position of ASUCLA as an official
department of the university, two goals which
look vaguely contradictory.
The basic question at stake is whether IJC
LA government is really under control of the
students or if they will only be allowed to op
crate within narrow limits set by the university.

One student at the University of Michigan
v as "really snowed" when he won a hi-fi set
for naming the filter tip of a famous cigar
rite in a nation-wide contest.
How successful this promotion was is du
bions, however.
I he student submitted three names, none
of which he can remember at this point. He
has no idea ichich one of them won the prize.
He aim smokes non-filler cigarettes. So
much for promotion contests.

bird in the contest.

I he Everett Junior College Clipper took a
poll hist week on what the school's students

thought of foreign women. Most interesting
comment:
"1 think foreign women are the greatest. I
was stationed in Seattle for two and one-half
years, and there isn't an American girl any
where that's as nice as the women from that
country."

An incident which occurred at Texas A&M
last week shows that segregation can have some
very odd sidelights.
At a coliseum event 23 rows had been re
served for Negroes. Only eight rows were filled
and 12 were completely empty. Some white
A&M students tried to sit in the seats, to get
a better view, have more room or whatever.
Hut such things are not done in Texas and
the students were quickly told to get out, al
though a few returned later on. Just proving
the old adage that a knife can cut both ways.

The Brigham Young University reports
the story of a young woman driver stopped
for making a right turn when her directional
blinkers indicated she teas going left.
Her defense: she thought the lights told
drivers behind her ichich way they should
turn.

The Bethany College Messenger has ob
served the progression of subtlety which occurs
in recitation answers during a student's college
career.
Freshman—/ don't knotv.
Sophomore—l am not prepared.
Junior—l do not remember.
Senior—l don't believe I can add anything
to what has already been said.
