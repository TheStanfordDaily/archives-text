'Occasional Lapse*
Fditor, The Daily:
Probably the majority of readers accept with a
certain disregard the occasional lapses in accu
racy which occur in The Daily. However, I do
leel it necessary to point out a complete misrepre
sentation which occurred in The Daily for April 5
in the article on Father Gustave Weigel's lee
lure in Cubberley Auditorium on the evening of
April 4.
Father Weigel did not say, "Theology is like
snakes: fascinating subjects, but you better keep
away from them.' He did say that many people
leel that theology is like snakes: fascinating sub
jects, but you better keep away from them.
He went on to say that he did not know about
snakes, but he felt that was a wrong attitude
t ward theoiogy, that people generally should
know a great deal more about theology, that he
in tact hoped that because of his remarks at least
fix people in his audience might become theolo
gians. The D •!' 's quotation is so wrenched out
ot context ; s to be a complete reversal of Father
Weigel's meaning.
This error is all the more serious because one
ol the charges most frequently leveled at the
Catholic Church by non-Catholics is that the
clergy discourages any attempt on the part of
ihe laity to study either theology or the Bible,
preferring to have the laity remain in as cloudy
a state of ignorance and blind obedience as pos
sible.
When, therefore, a Catholic priest invites a lay
audience to the study of theology and not only
Catholic theology, but all theologies—in the in
terests of truth his remarks, perhaps unexpected

to some, deserve to be reported accurately for the
benefit of those in the University community
who may be interested in them.

'High Motives'?
Editor, The Daily:
After viewing a spectacle Monday morning I
wonder where and whether the high-sounding
motives of fraternities exist. Upon leaving West
ern Civ lecture several youths were pounced on
and beaten into submission. After the struggle
they were tied to a nearby tree as the "mob"
charged across the yard for more victims.
Why such an irrational act should occur at
Stanford or anywhere puzzles me. Is this not the
20th century and are we not college students of
supposed higher intellect than certain violent
mob rule groups, i.e., Alabama Negro haters, rad
ical-inspired labor groups and associated gang
ster-infested organizations.
There can be no plausible explanation for the
outrage or its method. Why have such fine moral
objectives as most fraternities claim in their
charters and then act in that way? Where can
an existence of fellowship and friendship be
found in that barbaric action?
If the guilty group can give any, even partial,
rational explanation then I am open to correction.
Perhaps it is time to again consider the "values"
of fraternities and their actions. Why are they
by definition fine, high sounding but some in
practice altogether the opposite? I am not con
demning the entire group but only certain guilty
portions.

Why such an irrational act should occur at
Stanford or anywhere puzzles me. Is this not the
20th century and are we not college students of
supposed higher intellect than certain violent
mob rule groups, i.e., Alabama Negro haters, rad
ical-inspired labor groups and associated gang
ster-infested organizations.
There can be no plausible explanation for the
outrage or its method. Why have such fine moral
objectives as most fraternities claim in their
charters and then act in that way? Where can
an existence of fellowship and friendship be
found in that barbaric action?
If the guilty group can give any, even partial,
rational explanation then I am open to correction.
Perhaps it is time to again consider the "values"
of fraternities and their actions. Why are they
by definition fine, high sounding but some in
practice altogether the opposite? I am not con
demning the entire group but only certain guilty
portions.

'Occasional Lapse*
Fditor, The Daily:
Probably the majority of readers accept with a
certain disregard the occasional lapses in accu
racy which occur in The Daily. However, I do
leel it necessary to point out a complete misrepre
sentation which occurred in The Daily for April 5
in the article on Father Gustave Weigel's lee
lure in Cubberley Auditorium on the evening of
April 4.
Father Weigel did not say, "Theology is like
snakes: fascinating subjects, but you better keep
away from them.' He did say that many people
leel that theology is like snakes: fascinating sub
jects, but you better keep away from them.
He went on to say that he did not know about
snakes, but he felt that was a wrong attitude
t ward theoiogy, that people generally should
know a great deal more about theology, that he
in tact hoped that because of his remarks at least
fix people in his audience might become theolo
gians. The D •!' 's quotation is so wrenched out
ot context ; s to be a complete reversal of Father
Weigel's meaning.
This error is all the more serious because one
ol the charges most frequently leveled at the
Catholic Church by non-Catholics is that the
clergy discourages any attempt on the part of
ihe laity to study either theology or the Bible,
preferring to have the laity remain in as cloudy
a state of ignorance and blind obedience as pos
sible.
When, therefore, a Catholic priest invites a lay
audience to the study of theology and not only
Catholic theology, but all theologies—in the in
terests of truth his remarks, perhaps unexpected

to some, deserve to be reported accurately for the
benefit of those in the University community
who may be interested in them.

'High Motives'?
Editor, The Daily:
After viewing a spectacle Monday morning I
wonder where and whether the high-sounding
motives of fraternities exist. Upon leaving West
ern Civ lecture several youths were pounced on
and beaten into submission. After the struggle
they were tied to a nearby tree as the "mob"
charged across the yard for more victims.
Why such an irrational act should occur at
Stanford or anywhere puzzles me. Is this not the
20th century and are we not college students of
supposed higher intellect than certain violent
mob rule groups, i.e., Alabama Negro haters, rad
ical-inspired labor groups and associated gang
