'Democracy* 1
Editor, The Daily:
This is a protest against nomoc
racy. Too much Democracy. As
almost every female member of
the student body must know by
now, we, in about a week, are to
vote on a new housing policy
which is supposed to initiate a new
democratic method of drawing.
But is it democratic? We think
not; for this reason: only a simple
majority will be required to pass
this policy. Therefore, 51 per cent
of the women have it in their
power to dictate this policy affect
ing 100 per cent of the women.
This means that if two more
women vote for than vote against
this policy it will pass. Since all
the women aren't required to vote,
a majority of <10 per cent, 35 per
cent or even 30 per cent could
pass this policy.
Is this democratic? Every pre
vious AWS policy, including the
Bermuda shorts issue of last year,
was important enough to require
a two-thirds majority to pass it.
Is this such a weak policy that
the only way it can be passed is
by a simple majority?

Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the "anony
mous, subversive" AWS Housing
Evaluation Committee (thanks to
The Daily, which conspicuously
omitted printing the members'
names on two occasions), I wish
to rise in protest along with the
Editor that a reconsideration be
made.
A reconsideration by those who
have emotionally made pre-judg
ments against the proposed sys
tem and have quickly rejected it
without even waiting to hear the
Committee's reasoning behind
their proposal, rather than a re
consideration by the Committee
itself, who after all are only a
group of students not professing
to be any wiser than the students
at large, who were selected by
your representatives on the AWS
Cabinet and have devoted a full
quarter's diligent work to this
project.
It is not and never has been our
desire to impose any new drawing
system upon you. The Committee
was established by AWS Cabinet
and instructed by them to care
fully examine the present system
and propose a new one which then
could be brought to the women
students, rationally and unemo
tionally considered by them, and
finally accepted or rejected by the
women students in a democratic
vote.
We certainly do not profess that
this proposed system is perfect;
however, we do feel that it is a
great improvement over the old,
and all we ask is that you sin
cerely ,-ittempt to understand the
reasons behind our proposal and
then make the final decision your
self.
■ Let us not fall into the illiterate
trap of arguing over such sub
sidiary, loaded questions as "los
ing traditions," "disrupting friend
ships," concern over method and
time of electing officers (which
can easily be changed and greatly
improved), concern over cliques
• which exist now and will always
exist no matter what system is in
use), the "secretive" working of
the Committee and losing group
continuity (or isn't "conformity"
a more appropriate word?).
Whereas, the two basic propos

als are a more democratic system
and an actual workable senior
preference as compared to the
present system, which is neither
a democratic one nor one which
gives any class a preference.
Let us not reject the new sys
tem simply because it proposes
that we make a change, but rather
let us rise above our own emo
tional feelings, conditioned by out
own past experience and the par
ticular living group in which we
live, and rationally as well as un
emotionally consider the interest
of the whole campus, the long-run
effects of the systems, and finally
the real reasons behind the pro
posed system.

Editor's Note: Because of space
limitations the names of the com
mittee members were omitted
from the housing stories. The
names were important to the story
but not us important as the other
facts, hence we followed our gen
era I procedure of deleting the
names before the facts because of
short space.
