CLEARING THE BAR in the pole vault for Stanford's track team
is Kill Flint. The veteran senior cleared 14 feet for the first time
last week in the Tribe's cinder loss to Occidental. Flint, a member
of El Toro eating club, is one of Stanford's hopes to capture a first
place against UCLA this Saturday in Stanford Stadium. Flint's
main opposition will come from Lindy Kell, who cleared 13-10 last
year, and Jon Mitchell, who got over the 13-0 harrier for the Bruins.
