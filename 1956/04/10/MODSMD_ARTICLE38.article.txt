SAN FRANCISCO. April 9
(UP)â€”The annual trek to the Pa
cific Coast League ball parks
starts tomorrow as the 54-year-old
minor loop opens with two single
games and two day-night double
headers.
In the solo Portland is
at Sacramento and Vancouver at
San Francisco. Split twin bills
feature defending champion Se
attle at Hollywood and Los An
geles at San Diego.
The league was considerably
wrenched around after last sea
son with two key changes involv
ing the shift of the Oakland Oaks
to Vancouver and the purchase of
the floundering San Francisco
Seals by Boston.
Plenty of new faces will be in
the league this year.
