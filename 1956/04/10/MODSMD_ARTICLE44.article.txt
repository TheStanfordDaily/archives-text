# Boeing production engineering—precision on a big scale
## 
### 
This Hoeing H-52 wing jig is one ol' a
battery of four. Each one is 90 feet long
and weighs more than 1,000 tons. Yet
many of its tolerances are within 1/1000
of an inch —as close as a fine watch!
Almost-absolute accuracy on a tremen
dous scale like this means that Hoeing
production engineers face some of tin
most stimulating challenges in engineer
ing today.
These production engineers are of
many types. And, because of steady ex
pansion, Boeing needs more of them:
industrial, civil, mechanical, electrical
and aeronautical engineers.
There is "grow ing room" for topnotch
production engineers at Boeing's \Yuhita
and Seattle plants. Riy programs are nou

under way on the airplanes and guided
missiles of a few years hence. And Hoeing
production engineers are responsible lor
the high quality and continuous develop
ment of such industry-leading airplanes
as the H-52 —famous "Long Rifle" of
Strategic Air Command —and the 707 —
the world's first jet tanker-transport.
At Hoeing, production engineers find
individual recognition in tightly inte
grated teams in design-analysis, test, and
liaison service. They find that Hoeing is
an "engineers' company,"' with a long
standing policy of promotions from with
in the organization.
Career stability and growth are excep
tional at Hoeing, which now employs
more than twice as manv engineers as at

tlit* peak of World War II. Boeing en
gineers enjoy a most liberal retirement
plan. And life for them is pleasant in thr
progressive, "just size communities
of Seattle and Wichita.
There are opportunities at Boeing in
design and research, as well as in pro
duction. If you want joh security, satis
faction and growth, it will pay you to
investigate a Boeing career today.
