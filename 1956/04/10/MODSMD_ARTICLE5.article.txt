Two tickets to the Junior Prom and $20 in cash will be the
reward to the lucky Stanford student who succeeds in "cracking"
the safe which will be in front of the Cellar starting tomorrow.
Riddles giving clues to the safe's combination will be pub
lished in The Daily tomorrow, Thursday and Friday.
Anyone is eligible to try to find the combination to the safe,
according to Junior Prom Publicity Chairman Jim Bass.
The one who succeeds in opening it will win a bid to the prom
for himself and date plus enough money for a night out on the
town.
Ticket sales for the Prom continue today through April 21.
Booths are open at Engineering Corner and the Cellar from 8
a.m. to 3 p.m. daily.
Bids are $3.50 a couple for the annual formal dance.
Jerry Gray and his band will play for the Prom, which will be
held in the Sheraton-Palace Hotel from 9 to 1.
