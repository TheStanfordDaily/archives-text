JERUSALEM, Israeli Sector, April 9 (UP)—One major clash and
several lesser skirmishes between Israeli and Egyptian forces lent
urgency today to United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammar

airport tomorrow with UN truce

Burns in view of the latest flare
up along the Gaza strip, in which
both sides claimed heavy casual
ties. Original plans called for

where he received a blessing for
his mission today from Pope Pius
XII.

the clashes which began with ar
tillery duels last Wednesday rose
to 81 on the basis of figures from
both sides.

attacked Gaza strip villages last
week to obstruct Hammarskjold's
mission.
