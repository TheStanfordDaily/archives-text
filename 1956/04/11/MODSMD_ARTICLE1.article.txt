# Reds May Plan Economic Invasions, Warns Briton
## Embassy Official Says Russia Has Changed Policy Completely, Now Following Easy Line 
### Wally Simpson 
"We've got to learn to coexist with our friends if we're going to
have to co-exist with our enemies." This was the conclusion of Fred
erick J. Leishman, First Secretary of the British Embassy in Wash
ington, in a talk in Cubberley Auditorium yesterday.
Speaking on the topic of coexistence with the Communist world

-and what it means both to the
| Communists and to the Western
world, Leishman emphasized the '
necessity for the West to prevent
the Communists from gaining an
economic hold on neutral nations.
Communist strategy has follow- j
ed a zig-zag line, said Leishman.
During different epochs of mod- :
ern history it has waxed both hard
and easy, depending upon the sit-'
nation. The present Soviet policy i
is following the easy line.
New Doctrines
This has been characterized, ac-
I cording to Leishman, by two new
j doctrines w h ic h have emerged j
j from within the Kremlin. First,
the new Communist theory that
war is no longer inevitable is a I
complete change from the doc-1
trines of early Communist lead- j
ers.
It has resulted from the realiza-!
tion by Soviet leaders that war, if
carried to its full potential, would
result in nothing but destruction
of both sides.
The se.cond doctrine referred to
by Leishman is the new Russian
statement that there are different
roads to socialism. Within certain
countries where there is political
consciousness Communism can
take over by legal, constitutional j
methods.

The purpose of this second doc
trine, Leishman said, is to enable
Communist parties, which are |
clearly unable themselves to
achieve their aims, to join forces
with other extremist groups in a
common aim. Thus increased ac
tivity in Communist-front organi
zations can be expected and should
be watched out for.
The goal of present Communist
strategy is to maintain a holding
action against the West while
wooing neutral nations with what
ever resources and promises they
can.
It is clearly up to the West, said
Leishman, not to try to woo the
neutral nations over to our side,
but to try to aid them in remain
-1 ing neutral—both from the Com
munists and from ourselves.
Alienate Neutrals
They must make their own de
cision. The only thing the West
would accomplish by attaching
strings to their foreign aid would
be the alienation of the neutrals.
Leishman said it was still too
early to fully assess the impor
tance of the recent repudiation of
Stalin. But it does denote one
thing. That ts that the Russians
"feel much greater confidence and
strength than they did in the
past."

be the alienation of the neutrals.
Leishman said it was still too
early to fully assess the impor
tance of the recent repudiation of
Stalin. But it does denote one
thing. That ts that the Russians
"feel much greater confidence and
strength than they did in the
past."
"We've got to learn to coexist with our friends if we're going to
have to co-exist with our enemies." This was the conclusion of Fred
erick J. Leishman, First Secretary of the British Embassy in Wash
ington, in a talk in Cubberley Auditorium yesterday.
Speaking on the topic of coexistence with the Communist world

-and what it means both to the
| Communists and to the Western
world, Leishman emphasized the '
necessity for the West to prevent
the Communists from gaining an
economic hold on neutral nations.
Communist strategy has follow- j
ed a zig-zag line, said Leishman.
During different epochs of mod- :
ern history it has waxed both hard
and easy, depending upon the sit-'
nation. The present Soviet policy i
is following the easy line.
New Doctrines
This has been characterized, ac-
I cording to Leishman, by two new
j doctrines w h ic h have emerged j
j from within the Kremlin. First,
the new Communist theory that
war is no longer inevitable is a I
complete change from the doc-1
trines of early Communist lead- j
ers.
It has resulted from the realiza-!
tion by Soviet leaders that war, if
carried to its full potential, would
result in nothing but destruction
of both sides.
The se.cond doctrine referred to
by Leishman is the new Russian
statement that there are different
roads to socialism. Within certain
countries where there is political
consciousness Communism can
take over by legal, constitutional j
methods.

The purpose of this second doc
trine, Leishman said, is to enable
Communist parties, which are |
clearly unable themselves to
achieve their aims, to join forces
with other extremist groups in a
common aim. Thus increased ac
tivity in Communist-front organi
zations can be expected and should
be watched out for.
The goal of present Communist
strategy is to maintain a holding
action against the West while
wooing neutral nations with what
ever resources and promises they
can.
It is clearly up to the West, said
Leishman, not to try to woo the
neutral nations over to our side,
but to try to aid them in remain
-1 ing neutral—both from the Com
munists and from ourselves.
Alienate Neutrals
They must make their own de
cision. The only thing the West
would accomplish by attaching
strings to their foreign aid would
be the alienation of the neutrals.
