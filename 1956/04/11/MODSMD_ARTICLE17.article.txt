# Stevenson Given Big Vote of Confidence in Home-State Primary
## Ex-Governor Outpolls Both Kefauver, Ike Half of Vote Counted; Estes' Write-In Drive Is Apparent Failure 
### 
CHICAGO, April 10 (UP)- Ad
lai E. Stevenson drew a rousing
vote of confidence from home
state Democrats in the Illinois pri
mary tonight, out polled President
Eisenhower and derailed a write
in drive by Sen. Est.es Kefauver.
With 5,199 of the state's 9,511
precincts counted in today's pri
mary, Stevenson amassed 442,855
votes. Kefauver had 9,673 write-in
votes.
In the Republican race, 5,077
precincts gave President Eisen
hower 313,732 votes, while Sen.
William F. Knowland of Califor
nia drew 15,151.
With over naif of the votes
counted, most of the returns were
from Cook County (Chicago), a
Democratic stronghold where Ste
venson had solid organization
backing.
But the former Illinois gover
nor also was running well in pre
dominantly Republican downstate
areas. He was unopposed on the
Democratic ballot.
Small Turnout
Stevenson seemed certain to
pass the 526,301 votes amassed by
Kefauver in the 1952 Presidential
primary, when the Tennessee sen
ator was alone on the ballot. And
this was with a light vote today
that gave indications of being the
smallest in 30 years.
Kefauver had based his hopes
on a write-in vote of 10 per cent
of the Democratic total. Although
many areas delayed counting the
write-ins, when his vote began
rolling in it appeared far behind
expectations.
Stevenson had been expected lo
out poll Eisenhower, partly be
cause of a lack of any significant
competition in the GOP race.
3 to 1 Over Ike
But he was almost three to one
over the President in Cook Coun
ty, despite a trend in recent years
toward a greater GOP vote in I In
populous Chicago area. Republi
cans outpolled Democrats in Cook
County in the 1952 primary and
were only slightly behind in the
off-year 1954 primary.
In the GOP bailiwick downstate,
Eisenhower was about two to one
over Stevenson.
The apparent failure of the
write-in drive for Kefauver was
reflected in Cook County, where
the senator had some 2,000 votes
in 1,958 precincts. In these same
precincts the Stevenson vote wa:,
220,978.
