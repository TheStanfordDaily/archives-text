# The 						Growing Tradition
## 
### 
I. \ v I u:\tc the c.i.ass ()!•' 1955 set a precedent
which is certain to become one of Stanford's
outstanding traditions lhat of the Heritage
Fund.
I ntil last vear's graduates decided to leave
a more meaningful remembrance of their pass
ing, graduating clasf.es had left the usual sym
bolic tokens — a drinking fountain, a stone
bench or some other pretty but useless gift to
the I niversity.
I he Heritage Fund which the class estab
lished provided II full-year, full-tuition schol
arships, donated by I'alo Alto businessmen
after tin; plan had b 'en explained to them by
class m< rubers.
This year the class of 56 plans to carry on
the Heritage Fund tradition. And this is one
tradition that should be carried on, for the
sake of Stanford students as well as for tin
sake of future I niversity business-education
relations.
We have always taken a dim view of tradi
liou as a meaningless thing which adds nothing
lo .i student's intellectual growth, but rather
hampers him by tying him to past practices.
\V e learn our lessons from the past, for historv

is perhaps I Ik* best «»f all masters, but we
should not Mindly follow what wan done in
that past, merely because it i.s "tradition."
Drinking fountains and stone benches are
empty reminders of adherence to useless tra
dition. The Heritage Fund stands as a re
minder of a valuable and useful tradition
one which will assure that many who have the
ability and the will to become leaders of the
future will realize their potential through a
Stanford education, which they otherwise
might not afford.
Seven of the original 1 I scholarships were
awarded lo incoming freshineh- and now the
freshmen have responded to that generosit)
by donating the profits from their Big t.ame
Dance of last autumn — about 8600 to the
Heritage Fund for scholarship administration
lo a member of the class of '59.
So the tradition keeps growing, thanks to
the initiative of the progressive students of
today who have grasped the device of tradi
tion as a means of doing good for their fellow
students, not merely as a means to glorify their
class memory or to add another meaningless
drinking fountain t«» campus scenery.
