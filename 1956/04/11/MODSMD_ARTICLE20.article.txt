### HELEN DEWAR 
Although basking in the aura of a nervous
peace, jlie American people are now nearer the
outbreak, of war than they have been since th»-
demise of the Korean crisis in 1953.
Hostilities in the Middle East are on a touch
and go basis. The snowball of national and
ethnic animosities, economic rivalries and ar
mament contributions from the great power
blocs coupled with territorial guarantees by
Western countries threatens to convert an area
of localized struggle to an international battle
ground.
Although it is quite possible that an Arab-
Israeli war may suck in the United States and
many United Nations members pledged to
combat aggression, if is highly improbable that
the Soviet Union will want to use this as a
means of taking on the United States in all-out
war at this time.
Soviet leaders are having troubles of their
own destroying the Stalin myth and attempting
to create a new, supposedly less authoritarian
"collective leadership."
1 hey are emphasizing a new policy of peace
ful penetration of neutral countries with tanta
lizing offers of economic and technical aid.
I he danger rather lies in the possibility that
I \ efforts at drawing an effective truce be
tween the Arabs and the Israelis may go up
in 1 lie smoke of the most extensive war we have
seen yet in the area.
I he Arabs, confident ihey are leading from
strength, have become more insistent in their
demands for Israeli territory, namely the Ne
jxe\. which t lit Israelis are equally determined
to bold onto.
Hammarsk|old's task approaches the super
human, but it is possible that he can achieve
a postponement of hostilities providing time
for tempers t,> cool and some compromise to be
worked out.
And i( Hammarskjold's efforts prove unsuc
cessful, there rs little the West can do to fore
stall further outbreaks.
Both /Jitoiifih I \ obligations and the pro
nouncement Monday by President Eisen
hower, the ( nited States is pledged to op
pose aggression in this sensitive area, and if
necessary. oppose it by military force.
I? was not difficult to define the aggressor in
the Korean War. but it will not be so easy this
time.
ho is to t.41 who fired the first shot when
the Israelis scream it was the Arabs and the
Arabs scream it was the Israelis?
All hopes seem to be staked on Hammar
skjold s visit, the outcome of which may deter
mine whether it's war or peace iy the next
few years.
