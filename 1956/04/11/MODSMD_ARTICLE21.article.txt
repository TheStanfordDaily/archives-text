# Will Peace Efforts Be Effective In Israeli-Egyptian War Threat?
## 
### JIM PALMER 
I'eace in the Middle East hinges on the
strength of both United Nations and United
States efforts to maintain Iruce between the
Arab nations and Israel.
What are these efforts and how effective will
they be? This is the question of the hour: its
answer may decide if war will come.
Earlier this week President Eisenhower took
a firm stand in promising to oppose any ag
gression in the Middle East within the limits of
the Constitution.
At this very moment UN mediators are fe
verishly talking with both Egyptians and Is
raelis to reach some position of understanding.
Meanwhile Holy Land pot shots are continuing
at the Gaza strip.
If war breaks out despite peace efforts, the
United States and other United Nations coun
tries will find themselves in the midst of it.
They will be committed to fight the "aggres
sor"—whoever it may be —under the Eisen
hower declaration and provisions of the UN
Charter.
Our stake in the Middle East is no small one.
We cannot afford to be disinterested.
Hopes of the peace-loving nations are that
mediation can be achieved as it was a few years
ago hv Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph
Bundle when he stepped into the Holy Land
storm and brought quiet.
No one can know how successful peace-seek
er Dag Hammarskjold will be. We do know
that the odds against him are heavy.
• Ihe aggressor is undefined; Egyptians
say it is Israel and vice versa. Skirmishes on
both sides make it difficult to place the blame
on any one party and get to the core of the
trouble.
• The friendship of both the Israelis and
the oil-rich Arab world is at stake. To achieve
settlement without treading on somebody's
toes is a task of superman proportions. Both
these countries can be considered vital to the
free world; one or possibly both may be lost
by unbalanced mediation.
• Animosity between the parties is deep
seated and not likely to be overcome at a truce
table. Desire of either for a real and lasting
peace is doubtful.
I lie answer lies in the strength of the U.S.
and the coercion the UN is able to muster.
Only if the belligerents-potential are made su
premely aware of the consequences of their
conflict and only if the UN is able to provide
suitable alternatives to settlement can war be
avoided.
America's position has been well defined.
It is up to the machinery of the UN to sa>e
the World from another battlefield.
Be forceful, Mr. Hammarskjold.

say it is Israel and vice versa. Skirmishes on

on any one party and get to the core of the
trouble.
• The friendship of both the Israelis and

Be forceful, Mr. Hammarskjold.
I'eace in the Middle East hinges on the
strength of both United Nations and United
States efforts to maintain Iruce between the
Arab nations and Israel.
What are these efforts and how effective will
they be? This is the question of the hour: its
answer may decide if war will come.
Earlier this week President Eisenhower took
a firm stand in promising to oppose any ag
gression in the Middle East within the limits of
the Constitution.
At this very moment UN mediators are fe
