# Frosh Entertain Santa Rosa High On Diamond Today
## 
### 
Coach Clegg's frosh nine will
carry a -1-1 record onto the battle
field at 3:15 this afternoon-when
they face Santa Rosa High in their
sixth game of the season.
Clegg is uncertain about his
starting lineup, after the Papoose
baseballers dropped their first
game of the slate to Palo Alto in
a tight contest Saturday.
Either Mike Lindeman or Joel
Mogy will probably start on the
mound and Dave Dow will be the
starting receiver. Clegg is unde
cided about the first-base slot, as
he has three candidates for the
job.
Bob Nicolet and Tom Schilling
will be the keystone combination
and Dennie Farrar will occupy the
hot-corner. In the outfield, Rich
DeFabio, Harry Rodda and Brooks
Dyer will start in left, center and
right fields, respectively.
The game should be a good
scrap as outfielder Gary Stone of
Santa Rosa, who hit a home run
against the Indian frosh last year
when he was a junior, and Dolph
Camilli, Santa Rosa catcher and
brother of Varsity catcher Doug
Camilli, will be hitting-threats in
Santa Rosa's batting order*.
