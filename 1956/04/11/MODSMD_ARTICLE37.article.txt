# Stanford Track Hopes Rest on Field Events
## Nieland, Flint, Fehlen, Herrmann Have Best Chance Against Bruins on Saturday 
### 
UCLA's fast â€¢ stopping Bruin
track team, perhaps a strong
enough aggregation to beat the
unbeatable SC Trojans, will prob
ably make it useless for the In
dians to enter the running events
on the Stadium oval Saturday aft
ernoon.
liut in the field events it may
be a different story.
Past performances indicate that
Stanford will be favored to win
two of the six jumping and throw
ing events and could conceivably
win two more.
Kirk Nieland, Hank Roldan and
Hugh Johnson will be able to hold
their own against the Bruins' best
in the.javelin. No Uclan could bet
ter 18-i last weekend, while both
Nieland and Roldan tossed the
spear over 2QO feet.
After clearing 14 feet against
Occidental last Saturday, pole
vaulter Bill Flint should be fa
vored over the Bruins' Lindy Kell
and Jon Mitchell,
UCLA's versatile sophomore Ra
fer Johnson and football wingback
Chuck Holloway will be favored
in the broad jump, but one of John

Hermann's best leaps could take
the event.
Nick Dyer topped 6-7 lor UCLA
in the high jump last week, but
Phil Fehlen, who has bee* consist- j
ently over 6-4, and Bernir Neison
ai-e capable of pressing )irn.
