# Latin Newsmen Shown Informal Western Living
## Hispanic-American Director Hosts Journalists For Lunch, Croquet Match 'Played' in Spanish 
### 
Visiting Latin-American newsmen got an idea of informal Cali
ornia living yesterday at the home of Ronald Hilton, director of
lispanic-American studies.
The journalists were guests at a luncheon and croquet match at
lilton's campus home. Students and faculty of the Hispanic-American

""Studies Department were also
guests.
For the Latin-Americans, cro
quet was a new sport. Antonio
Faustino Porto tried to use the
croquet ball as a soccer ball but
failed.
The croquet match was as much
a diversion for the Stanford stu
dents as it was for the newsmen,
because it was "played" in Span
ish.
Beginners' luck failed to come
to the aid of the newsmen, and
Judy Hearing and Gloria Gordon
won the first two matches. But
Oscar Armando Yanes of Vene
zuela won second place ;ind Porto
won honorable mention "for prog
ress."
Rain prevented further play but
referee Joseph Shirley fell the
South American guests would
have doubtless "come out ahead"
in the final playoffs.
During Ihe luncheon following
the tournament, the newsmen dis
cussed their impressions of the
United States.
One of thorn said that when he
arrived in New York he heard
that California was the most beau
tiful state, San Francisco the most
beautiful city there and that the
most beautiful part of San Fran
cisco was its women. Since then
he has found it to he true.
Yesterday the newsmen were
Hilton's guests on a tour of the
Stanford campus. They liked tho
Latin American influence on cam
pus, not only in the Hispanic-
American Studies Department but
also in the Spanish architecture
of the buildings.
The visitors will tour Moffett
J Air Force base today. Tonight
! they will be guests for dinner at
| Lagunita.
The journalists will leave to-
I morrow for San Francisco.
