# Anita Ekberg Top Issue In Series Debate
## Scandinavians Make Entertainment Main Object, Ignore Issues 
### Anne Johnson 
A very entertaining evening
was had by all at the Tuesday
Evening Series debate last night
in Memorial Auditorium.
The Scandinavian team rose to"
the defense of Swedish beauty
queen Anita Ekberg and accused
America of having corrupted her.
Stanford team member It. Dobie
Langenkamp repudiated the
charge, claiming that he could see
a certain,reason for European bit
terness over losing her.
Andreas Brown, also represent
ing Stanford, jumped into the bat
tle to declare that European mon
archs look with a great deal of
interest at American women.
Envious Looks
Earlier Poul J. Svanholm from
the University of Copenhagen had
declared, "Americans look with
envy to monarchial countries;
take, for example, Grace Kelly's
wedding a sacred thing for most
Americans."
His teammate. Harald Uncas
Serner, explained why European
men like the Prince of Monaco
marry American women: "Most
men like women to admire them
and to have inferiority feelings
towards them."
The topic announced for the de
bate was "Resolved: That Ameri
cans Have a European Complex."
The Scandinavian team started off
the festivities, perhaps under the
impression that American audi
ences like to be entertained.
Their Stanford opponents found
that the challenge to be funny was
too enticing to be ignored.
And with such a genial air es
tablished, compliments and
thanks naturally had to open and
close very short statements. The
Scandinavian team likes America,
especially San Francisco's Inter
national Settlement, because it is
closer to their homelands.
Sports Car Fanatics
The American team deplores
the fact that some Stanford fanat
ics drive around in foreign sports
cars, thus adding to European su
premacy.
Getting back to the basic issue,
Langenkamp scored a point when
he brought up the fact that "we
don't have kings, the Louvre, the
Mona Lisa, but we have the movie
'Marty' and it won the Interna
tional Film Festival."
On this basis, Brown could go
on to say that America is making
serious inroads into European cul
ture and economics.
Neither side seemed to be con
vinced that it was wrong at the
debate's end. Which wasn't too
surprising because the audience
was undecided as to who had com
plexes when, where and why.

Getting back to the basic issue,
Langenkamp scored a point when
he brought up the fact that "we
don't have kings, the Louvre, the
Mona Lisa, but we have the movie
'Marty' and it won the Interna
tional Film Festival."
On this basis, Brown could go
on to say that America is making
serious inroads into European cul
ture and economics.
Neither side seemed to be con
vinced that it was wrong at the
debate's end. Which wasn't too
surprising because the audience
was undecided as to who had com
plexes when, where and why.
A very entertaining evening
was had by all at the Tuesday
Evening Series debate last night
in Memorial Auditorium.
The Scandinavian team rose to"
the defense of Swedish beauty
queen Anita Ekberg and accused
America of having corrupted her.
Stanford team member It. Dobie
Langenkamp repudiated the
charge, claiming that he could see
a certain,reason for European bit
terness over losing her.
Andreas Brown, also represent
ing Stanford, jumped into the bat
tle to declare that European mon
archs look with a great deal of
interest at American women.
Envious Looks
Earlier Poul J. Svanholm from
the University of Copenhagen had
declared, "Americans look with
envy to monarchial countries;
take, for example, Grace Kelly's
wedding a sacred thing for most
Americans."
His teammate. Harald Uncas
Serner, explained why European
men like the Prince of Monaco
marry American women: "Most
men like women to admire them
and to have inferiority feelings
towards them."
The topic announced for the de
bate was "Resolved: That Ameri
cans Have a European Complex."
The Scandinavian team started off
the festivities, perhaps under the
impression that American audi
ences like to be entertained.
Their Stanford opponents found
that the challenge to be funny was
too enticing to be ignored.
And with such a genial air es
tablished, compliments and
thanks naturally had to open and
close very short statements. The
Scandinavian team likes America,
especially San Francisco's Inter
national Settlement, because it is
closer to their homelands.
Sports Car Fanatics
The American team deplores
the fact that some Stanford fanat
ics drive around in foreign sports
cars, thus adding to European su
premacy.
