# Ike Pulls Ahead by Slim Margin in 'Popularity' Illinois Primary Election
## Adlai Wins Demo Confidence Vote in Home State Elections 
### 
( HICACjO, April 11 (UP)—President Eisenhower topped Adlai E.
Stevenson today in a nip-and-tuck battle for the most votes in the
Illinois Presidential preference primary.
With most of the vote counted, Eisenhower's state wide total ran
about 18,000 votes ahead of Stevenson's. The bulk of missing pre-

■cincts were in predominantly Re
publican territory.
Stevenson, seeking to get .his
bandwagon rolling after a pri
mary defeat in Minnesota, rolled
up a vote of confidence from
home-state Democrats and smash
ed a write-in bid by Sen. Estes
Kefauver.
But he saw Eisenhower come
from behind and surge ahead of
him in a dramatic tide of late
votes in the "popularity" sweep
stakes.
With 9,026 of the state's 9,511
precincts counted in yesterday's
primary, Eisenhower had 711,864
votes. Stevenson had 694,096 votes
in 8,948 precincts.
Chicago Margin
Stevenson, former Illinois gov
ernor and the 1952 Democratic
Presidential nominee, outpolled
the President by a nearly two to
one margin in Chicago, long a
Democratic stronghold.
But downstate and in the Chi
cago suburbs, both predominantly
Republican, Eisenhower had a bet
ter than two to one edge over
Stevenson.
Kefauver, whose name was not
on the Democratic ballot but
whose backers bid for write-in
votes, limped in with 31,000 votes.
Stevenson was unopposed for
President on-his party's ballot,
while Eisenhower shared the GOP
ticket with Sen. William F. Know
land of California, who was too
late to withdraw after backing the
President, and a perennial candi
date, Lar Daly. Knowland drew
about 31,000 votes and Daly about
9,000.
Satisfaction
Although both sides publicly de
clared satisfaction with the re
sults, there were few definite con
clusions to be drawn from the
Stevenson-Eisenhower battle.
Illinois primary voters are not
permitted to cross party lines, and
Ihe vote for the two men largely
reflected traditional areas of party
strength in the state. Actually the
total vote was the lightest in 12
years.
Nevertheless. Eisenhower and
Stevenson appeared to have cap
tured the 50 convention delegates
elected by each party. Delegates
were not bound by the results of
the Presidential preference vot
ing, but most, if not all, of those
elected were expected to support
Stevenson and Mr. Eisenhower.
