# Housing Vote Rule Changes Are Announced
## Two-Thirds Majority Of Women Students Required to OK Plan 
### 
A two-thirds vote will be re
quired to institute the proposed
new women's drawing and hous
ing system, AWS Cabinet announ
ced yesterday.
As well as increasing the vote
needed to change the old plan
from a simple majority, the cabi
net has decided to allow freshmen
to participate in the referendum,
according to AWS President Ellie
Kron field.
Because of Ihe changes, the fi
nal vote on the proposal has been
postponed to allow the intensive
education of freshmen on both
sides of each provision.
Several riew suggestions were
presented at the cabinet meeting
Tuesday. They will be announced
next week and will, along with
each part of the original proposal,
be subjected to an informal "straw
vote" at house meetings on Mon
day, April 23.
Although all women students
are represented by the Housing
Committee, their opinions are
wanted on the individual issues,
Miss Kronfield said.
After the "straw vote" the com
mittee will draft a final plan to
be voted on, taking opinions on
the various systems into consid
eration.
It was not previously planned
to allow freshmen to vote, the ar
guments being raised that they
had never lived under the old sys
tem and that their large numbers
might decide the vote.
AWS now feels that the two
plans can be explained well
enough to make up for their lack
of experience and that a two
thirds vote would lessen freshman
influence.
Discontent with the original
proposal expressed at Monday's
house meetings led to the special
Tuesday suggestion meeting.
