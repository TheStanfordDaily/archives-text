# LASSU OK's Parking, Social Rule Changes
## 
### Jae Hunley 
Working without a writ ton
agenda, Legislature last 11 ir h t
wandered through an evening con
sisting mostly of voiced approvals
of appointments and by-law
changes.
Foremost was the motion pass
ed okaying the changes in social
rules. As presented by ASSU Vice-
President Helen Zarifes, the new
set of regulations limits the num
ber of functions at which patrons
or adult guests, as they will be
called, will be required.
The new proposals will go into
effect as of May 1, and all parties
or events taking place after that
date must be re-registered in or
der to conform to the new system.
Legislature also passed changes
in the by-laws and standing rules
for the Associated Women Stu
dents constitution. The group also
recommended that AVVS Presi
dent Harriet Thomas request the
AWS Cabinet to consider the pos
sibility of requiring more than a
simple majority vote to make any
basic policy changes.
Bob Maddock presented the
Traffic Commitee's weekly report,
[legislature passed his resolution
' reducing the number of visitors'
! parking spaces in front of Hoover
1 Tower to eicht and the number of
spaces in front of History Corner
to six.
He requested these changes on
the basis of "spot checks* indicat
ing that the allotted number HK
' in front of the Tower, 13 at His
' lory Corner) was not being used
by visitors.
In other business, Legislature
I heard the first reading of propos
ed by-law changes for Rally Com
[ mittee. These changes would
make the Committee a Commis
sion, similar to Pro-registration
Commission, and also remove it
I from Cardinals control.
