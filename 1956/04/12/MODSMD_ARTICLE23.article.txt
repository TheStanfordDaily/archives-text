The proposed housing legislation will probably
work hardships on Stanford women as a whole
because it does not in any way encourage the
optimum in leadership or group cohesiveness.
The autumn quarter officers for each group may
be elected in a meeting of the future residents
shortly after drawing or shortly after moving in.
This will mean that the electors will not know
i he qualifications of the nominees and it will be
a matter of chance if the people most competent
to fill the positions will be elected.
The over all caliber of leadership will probably
fall, i.nd inevitably there will be less co-operation
with Those leaders, which will cut down the ef
fectiveness ol living group government consid
erably. The leaders' loyalty to the group, too, is
crucially important for its happiness and effec
tiveness.
When officers are elected under this system
Ihey will not know their group and, therefore,
may not have much allegiance to it. Poor repre
sentation and apathy are the inevitable result.
The spirit and cohesiveness of a group are
largely determined by the friendship among all
its members as a unit. The new system will result
in cliques despite our best efforts and intentions.
I think the Roble-ites who wrote Monday's letter
were wrong in assuming that there are carryover
cliques under the present system unless these
cliques are based on the tendency to stick with
< lassmates.
From experience we know that a girl who
draws by herself makes many new friends in her
new living group, but when two or three draw
together they don't expand their circle of friends
as much. They tend to go to meals together, talk
together and are generally a social unit within
themselves.
Under the new system, seniors could draw in
groups of six and they would live in gx-oups of
six for the most part. Sophomores and juniors
won't have as much chance of living in their pre
ferred residence if seniors are competing with
them on the proposed terms, and, therefore, their
incentive to draw by themselves is almost de
stroyed.
Many of them will draw with the same people
every year. This encourages loyalty to one's own
group but not to the whole living group. Each
residence will probably be a multitude of little
c liquesâ€”none of them very obtrusive perhaps,
but each an extremely effective barrier to living
group unity.
Before we rush into anything so radical, let's
give the present system a chance to work with
the new Florence Moore living group or other
proposals for the solution of our housing prob
lems ample time to be considered.

We have just come from a housing meeling
where we learned about the new, compulsory de
mocracy with preference for seniors, exemplified
by the new housing system.
By this syst >n, ah women students who find
themsel\cs unhappy in their surroundings will
be allowed .o stay there for a whole year.
Those seniors v ho are fortunate enough to be
among the preferred 75 per cent on their one
chance to draw, will be practically minus the in
fluence of their primitive, uneducated, lower-class
men. Those juniors ard sophomores who will be
stuffed into the more unwanted areas of campus
will not be put upon by the interfering, stodgy,
vegetable influence of seniors.
Since every woman will be mandatorily, demo
cratically allowed to draw every year, no one will
need to fear the occurrence of unwanted stability
in any house. Why should any group desire to put,
by their own sacrifice, unnecessary improvements
into a house 'i.e., television, telephone, tableware
and recreational supplies) when they may not
remain there to be bothered by them? Why should
anyone need to work for an apparently unwanted,
stable, homelike atmosphere and- a thriving,
house-proud, group spirit?
The old system accommodated both the travel
ing types and the homebodies among our student
population, while the new system pleases neither.
The old system provides a conservative carry-over
and the benefits of new blood, following the ex
amples of governmental senates and councils.
The old system gives seniors still a preference,
as an equal number of openings in a given house
will be, percentage-wise, beneficial to the smallest
class, called "senior."
The new system would be fine if it allowed for
quarterly changes for the unhappy few who will

create friction regardless. It would he fine if it
allowed for a stable, certain carry-over to main
tain tradition and an atmosphere from which one
can draw with the assurance that it will remain.
It would be fine if it didn't include greater division
among the classes. It would be fine if ... What's

Our members read Mr. Reic-hert's letter in Tues
day's Daily with considerable interest and with
no small amount of puzzlement. Was he serious?
What he saw was only a small part of our vast
horror system in which we hope to perpetuate our
group of sadists.
Beating the boys to submission on the sidewalk
in front of Mem Aud was only the beginning of
what we did. You should have seen the vats of
boiling tar, the razor mattresses, the whips, burn
ing mats and other fiendish devices we use to
convert them from normal humanism to that in
sidious breed of man known as a fraternity mem
ber.
If Mr. Reichert was serious, then let us hasten
to correct some of the misinformation he gath
ered. No one was beaten when we picked up our
pledges after a Pledge Sneak. No one was tied to
a tree; no one was hurt.
We did bring them up to the house to clean up
and replace the things they stole last Friday night.
All the beds in the house were taken, all of our
cooking utensils stolen, the front door removed
and certain essential plumbing fixtures were dis
abled. This they had to repair.
Although we welcome criticism of the frater
nity system, for it is only through criticism that
we can improve, we do not feel it fair that anyone
knowing as little about it as Mr. Reichert appar
ently does should make the flat statement that
"there can be no plausible explanation for the out
rage or its methods."
As we understand it, Mr. Reichert's only in
volvement with the episode was as a witness.
However, we apologize if his sensitivities were
injured by the sight of healthy young men being
caught and carried off to the just punishments
by their fraternity brothers.
If Mr. Reichert is sincerely interested in the
motives for the "irrational act.," we invite him to
our chapter house at any time. Our address is 540

'Barbarian Chants'
Editor, The Daily:
As I read the headlines of your excellent paper,
the gloom of the morning rain was pierced by a
ray of bright light which descended from the
heavens, no doubt, and affixed itself to your ar
ticle reporting an attack on a certain Nat Cole.
Although many NAACP (National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People) individ
uals may consider this act as an act perpetrated
by an anti-integration group under the guise of
protesting to "rock and roll," I choose to regard
this commendable act of violence in a more sig
nificant light.
These have been the first overt acts of defiance
on behalf of the American public to the disgust
ing jumble of obscene jingles, vulgarisms and
barbarian chants which have occupied the posi
tion of American "popular music" during the past
twenty years.
This popular "music" has overshadowed the
Golden Era of American music (roughly 1927-
1935) and has degraded the tastes of the fast
degenerating American public which actually
pays money to see a rendition of this jungle
jumble performed by their favorite contortionist,
sexual pervert or formerly unemployed individ
ual who, by effeminancy, affectation and obscen
ity, has succeeded in delighting many Americans.
I have three regrets over the outcome of this
incident, however.
First, that the performer attacked happened
to be colored. I do hope that the NAACP will
refrain from martyring jazz-singers.
Second, that there were not several hundred
actively defiant music lovers present to admin
ister punishment to the audience, that vast group
of consumers who subsidize the degenerate exhi
bitions of sensualism which so typify current
popular music.
I regret, thirdly, that the three individuals who
perpetrated this defiant act were arrested. It was
the depraved audience and main exhibitionist
which ought to have been treated thus.

As I read the headlines of your excellent paper,
the gloom of the morning rain was pierced by a
ray of bright light which descended from the
heavens, no doubt, and affixed itself to your ar
ticle reporting an attack on a certain Nat Cole.
Although many NAACP (National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People) individ
uals may consider this act as an act perpetrated
by an anti-integration group under the guise of
protesting to "rock and roll," I choose to regard
this commendable act of violence in a more sig
nificant light.
These have been the first overt acts of defiance
on behalf of the American public to the disgust
ing jumble of obscene jingles, vulgarisms and
barbarian chants which have occupied the posi
tion of American "popular music" during the past
twenty years.
This popular "music" has overshadowed the
Golden Era of American music (roughly 1927-
1935) and has degraded the tastes of the fast
degenerating American public which actually
pays money to see a rendition of this jungle
jumble performed by their favorite contortionist,
sexual pervert or formerly unemployed individ
ual who, by effeminancy, affectation and obscen
ity, has succeeded in delighting many Americans.
I have three regrets over the outcome of this
incident, however.
First, that the performer attacked happened
to be colored. I do hope that the NAACP will
refrain from martyring jazz-singers.
Second, that there were not several hundred
actively defiant music lovers present to admin
ister punishment to the audience, that vast group
of consumers who subsidize the degenerate exhi
bitions of sensualism which so typify current
popular music.
I regret, thirdly, that the three individuals who
perpetrated this defiant act were arrested. It was
the depraved audience and main exhibitionist
which ought to have been treated thus.

The proposed housing legislation will probably
work hardships on Stanford women as a whole
because it does not in any way encourage the
optimum in leadership or group cohesiveness.
The autumn quarter officers for each group may
be elected in a meeting of the future residents
shortly after drawing or shortly after moving in.
This will mean that the electors will not know
i he qualifications of the nominees and it will be
a matter of chance if the people most competent
to fill the positions will be elected.
The over all caliber of leadership will probably
fall, i.nd inevitably there will be less co-operation
with Those leaders, which will cut down the ef
fectiveness ol living group government consid
erably. The leaders' loyalty to the group, too, is
crucially important for its happiness and effec
tiveness.
When officers are elected under this system
Ihey will not know their group and, therefore,
may not have much allegiance to it. Poor repre
sentation and apathy are the inevitable result.
The spirit and cohesiveness of a group are
largely determined by the friendship among all
its members as a unit. The new system will result
in cliques despite our best efforts and intentions.
I think the Roble-ites who wrote Monday's letter
were wrong in assuming that there are carryover
cliques under the present system unless these
cliques are based on the tendency to stick with
< lassmates.
From experience we know that a girl who
draws by herself makes many new friends in her
new living group, but when two or three draw
together they don't expand their circle of friends
as much. They tend to go to meals together, talk
together and are generally a social unit within
themselves.
Under the new system, seniors could draw in
groups of six and they would live in gx-oups of
six for the most part. Sophomores and juniors
won't have as much chance of living in their pre
ferred residence if seniors are competing with
them on the proposed terms, and, therefore, their
incentive to draw by themselves is almost de
stroyed.
Many of them will draw with the same people
every year. This encourages loyalty to one's own
group but not to the whole living group. Each
residence will probably be a multitude of little
c liquesâ€”none of them very obtrusive perhaps,
but each an extremely effective barrier to living
group unity.
Before we rush into anything so radical, let's
give the present system a chance to work with
the new Florence Moore living group or other
proposals for the solution of our housing prob
lems ample time to be considered.

by their own sacrifice, unnecessary improvements
into a house 'i.e., television, telephone, tableware

anyone need to work for an apparently unwanted,

We did bring them up to the house to clean up

All the beds in the house were taken, all of our

What he saw was only a small part of our vast

Beating the boys to submission on the sidewalk

If Mr. Reichert was serious, then let us hasten

a tree; no one was hurt.
We did bring them up to the house to clean up
and replace the things they stole last Friday night.
All the beds in the house were taken, all of our
cooking utensils stolen, the front door removed
and certain essential plumbing fixtures were dis

Although we welcome criticism of the frater

As I read the headlines of your excellent paper,
the gloom of the morning rain was pierced by a
ray of bright light which descended from the
heavens, no doubt, and affixed itself to your ar
ticle reporting an attack on a certain Nat Cole.
Although many NAACP (National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People) individ
uals may consider this act as an act perpetrated
by an anti-integration group under the guise of
protesting to "rock and roll," I choose to regard
this commendable act of violence in a more sig
nificant light.
These have been the first overt acts of defiance
on behalf of the American public to the disgust
ing jumble of obscene jingles, vulgarisms and
barbarian chants which have occupied the posi
tion of American "popular music" during the past
twenty years.
This popular "music" has overshadowed the
Golden Era of American music (roughly 1927-
1935) and has degraded the tastes of the fast
degenerating American public which actually
pays money to see a rendition of this jungle
jumble performed by their favorite contortionist,
sexual pervert or formerly unemployed individ
ual who, by effeminancy, affectation and obscen
ity, has succeeded in delighting many Americans.
I have three regrets over the outcome of this
incident, however.
First, that the performer attacked happened
to be colored. I do hope that the NAACP will
refrain from martyring jazz-singers.
Second, that there were not several hundred
actively defiant music lovers present to admin
ister punishment to the audience, that vast group
of consumers who subsidize the degenerate exhi
bitions of sensualism which so typify current
popular music.
I regret, thirdly, that the three individuals who
perpetrated this defiant act were arrested. It was
the depraved audience and main exhibitionist
which ought to have been treated thus.

The proposed housing legislation will probably
work hardships on Stanford women as a whole
because it does not in any way encourage the
optimum in leadership or group cohesiveness.
The autumn quarter officers for each group may
be elected in a meeting of the future residents
shortly after drawing or shortly after moving in.
This will mean that the electors will not know
i he qualifications of the nominees and it will be
a matter of chance if the people most competent
to fill the positions will be elected.
The over all caliber of leadership will probably
fall, i.nd inevitably there will be less co-operation
with Those leaders, which will cut down the ef
fectiveness ol living group government consid
erably. The leaders' loyalty to the group, too, is
crucially important for its happiness and effec
tiveness.
When officers are elected under this system
Ihey will not know their group and, therefore,
may not have much allegiance to it. Poor repre
sentation and apathy are the inevitable result.
The spirit and cohesiveness of a group are
largely determined by the friendship among all
its members as a unit. The new system will result
in cliques despite our best efforts and intentions.
I think the Roble-ites who wrote Monday's letter
were wrong in assuming that there are carryover
cliques under the present system unless these
cliques are based on the tendency to stick with
< lassmates.
From experience we know that a girl who
draws by herself makes many new friends in her
new living group, but when two or three draw
together they don't expand their circle of friends
as much. They tend to go to meals together, talk
together and are generally a social unit within
themselves.
Under the new system, seniors could draw in
groups of six and they would live in gx-oups of
six for the most part. Sophomores and juniors
won't have as much chance of living in their pre
ferred residence if seniors are competing with
them on the proposed terms, and, therefore, their
incentive to draw by themselves is almost de
stroyed.
Many of them will draw with the same people
every year. This encourages loyalty to one's own
group but not to the whole living group. Each
residence will probably be a multitude of little
c liquesâ€”none of them very obtrusive perhaps,
but each an extremely effective barrier to living
group unity.
Before we rush into anything so radical, let's
give the present system a chance to work with
the new Florence Moore living group or other
proposals for the solution of our housing prob
lems ample time to be considered.

We have just come from a housing meeling

mocracy with preference for seniors, exemplified
by the new housing system.
By this syst >n, ah women students who find
themsel\cs unhappy in their surroundings will
be allowed .o stay there for a whole year.
Those seniors v ho are fortunate enough to be
among the preferred 75 per cent on their one
chance to draw, will be practically minus the in
fluence of their primitive, uneducated, lower-class
men. Those juniors ard sophomores who will be
stuffed into the more unwanted areas of campus
will not be put upon by the interfering, stodgy,
vegetable influence of seniors.
Since every woman will be mandatorily, demo
cratically allowed to draw every year, no one will
need to fear the occurrence of unwanted stability
in any house. Why should any group desire to put,
by their own sacrifice, unnecessary improvements
into a house 'i.e., television, telephone, tableware
and recreational supplies) when they may not
remain there to be bothered by them? Why should
anyone need to work for an apparently unwanted,
stable, homelike atmosphere and- a thriving,
house-proud, group spirit?
The old system accommodated both the travel

population, while the new system pleases neither.
The old system provides a conservative carry-over
and the benefits of new blood, following the ex

We have just come from a housing meeling

by the new housing system.
By this syst >n, ah women students who find
themsel\cs unhappy in their surroundings will
be allowed .o stay there for a whole year.
Those seniors v ho are fortunate enough to be
among the preferred 75 per cent on their one
chance to draw, will be practically minus the in

stuffed into the more unwanted areas of campus
will not be put upon by the interfering, stodgy,

Since every woman will be mandatorily, demo

need to fear the occurrence of unwanted stability
in any house. Why should any group desire to put,
by their own sacrifice, unnecessary improvements
into a house 'i.e., television, telephone, tableware
and recreational supplies) when they may not
remain there to be bothered by them? Why should
anyone need to work for an apparently unwanted,
stable, homelike atmosphere and- a thriving,
house-proud, group spirit?
The old system accommodated both the travel

The old system provides a conservative carry-over

The old system gives seniors still a preference,
as an equal number of openings in a given house

The new system would be fine if it allowed for

What he saw was only a small part of our vast

Beating the boys to submission on the sidewalk

If Mr. Reichert was serious, then let us hasten

a tree; no one was hurt.
We did bring them up to the house to clean up
and replace the things they stole last Friday night.
All the beds in the house were taken, all of our
cooking utensils stolen, the front door removed
and certain essential plumbing fixtures were dis

Although we welcome criticism of the frater

As I read the headlines of your excellent paper,
the gloom of the morning rain was pierced by a
ray of bright light which descended from the
heavens, no doubt, and affixed itself to your ar
ticle reporting an attack on a certain Nat Cole.
Although many NAACP (National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People) individ
uals may consider this act as an act perpetrated
by an anti-integration group under the guise of
protesting to "rock and roll," I choose to regard
this commendable act of violence in a more sig
nificant light.
These have been the first overt acts of defiance
on behalf of the American public to the disgust
ing jumble of obscene jingles, vulgarisms and
barbarian chants which have occupied the posi
tion of American "popular music" during the past
twenty years.
This popular "music" has overshadowed the
Golden Era of American music (roughly 1927-
1935) and has degraded the tastes of the fast
degenerating American public which actually
pays money to see a rendition of this jungle
jumble performed by their favorite contortionist,
sexual pervert or formerly unemployed individ
ual who, by effeminancy, affectation and obscen
ity, has succeeded in delighting many Americans.
I have three regrets over the outcome of this
incident, however.
First, that the performer attacked happened
to be colored. I do hope that the NAACP will
refrain from martyring jazz-singers.
Second, that there were not several hundred
actively defiant music lovers present to admin
ister punishment to the audience, that vast group
of consumers who subsidize the degenerate exhi
bitions of sensualism which so typify current
popular music.
I regret, thirdly, that the three individuals who
perpetrated this defiant act were arrested. It was
the depraved audience and main exhibitionist
which ought to have been treated thus.

The proposed housing legislation will probably
work hardships on Stanford women as a whole
because it does not in any way encourage the
optimum in leadership or group cohesiveness.
The autumn quarter officers for each group may
be elected in a meeting of the future residents
shortly after drawing or shortly after moving in.
This will mean that the electors will not know
i he qualifications of the nominees and it will be
a matter of chance if the people most competent
to fill the positions will be elected.
The over all caliber of leadership will probably
fall, i.nd inevitably there will be less co-operation
with Those leaders, which will cut down the ef
fectiveness ol living group government consid
erably. The leaders' loyalty to the group, too, is
crucially important for its happiness and effec
tiveness.
When officers are elected under this system
Ihey will not know their group and, therefore,
may not have much allegiance to it. Poor repre
sentation and apathy are the inevitable result.
The spirit and cohesiveness of a group are
largely determined by the friendship among all
its members as a unit. The new system will result
in cliques despite our best efforts and intentions.
I think the Roble-ites who wrote Monday's letter
were wrong in assuming that there are carryover
cliques under the present system unless these
cliques are based on the tendency to stick with
< lassmates.
From experience we know that a girl who
draws by herself makes many new friends in her
new living group, but when two or three draw
together they don't expand their circle of friends
as much. They tend to go to meals together, talk
together and are generally a social unit within
themselves.
Under the new system, seniors could draw in
groups of six and they would live in gx-oups of
six for the most part. Sophomores and juniors
won't have as much chance of living in their pre
ferred residence if seniors are competing with
them on the proposed terms, and, therefore, their
incentive to draw by themselves is almost de

ister punishment to the audience, that vast group
of consumers who subsidize the degenerate exhi
bitions of sensualism which so typify current
popular music.
I regret, thirdly, that the three individuals who
perpetrated this defiant act were arrested. It was
the depraved audience and main exhibitionist
which ought to have been treated thus.
