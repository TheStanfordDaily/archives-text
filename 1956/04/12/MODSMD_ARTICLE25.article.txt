# ‘Well, What Did You Unlearn Today?'
## Heresy in History 
### 
Poor little Russian student, lie lias enough
to learn—what with '"dialectic materialism,"
"proletarian democracy," "labor theory of
value" and other mouthings of the Bolshevik
bureaucrats.
But with a swift kick at the dead Joe Stalin,
the Soviet high command has made his history
lessons even harder.

No longer is Stalin the kindly old "Uncle
Joe. Kussia s enemies are now her friends, her
traitors her patriots and her laurels her thorns.
New party slogans have to he memorized, new
rationalizations made.
And just think what happens if he learns
his lessons wrong.
