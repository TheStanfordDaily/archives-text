## Stanford Women Give Evaluation Of New AWS Housing Proposal 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Do you think that the proposed AWS hous
ing plan is an improvement over the old svs
tem ?
Stanford women had this to say in answer
to the controversial question:
Carol Eyviann, '57, Mariposa: "Since not
every woman on campus can live in her first
choice residence every year, some sacrifices
must be made. Realizing this, the Housing
Evaluation Committee has suggested a svstem
of senior preference. In order for this system
to operate, it would he necessary that all wom
en draw every year because of the correspond
ence between the number of senior women
and the sizes of our living area.
"]No one is pretending the proposed system
is the only answer; it is a suggestion to stimu
late thinking which will lead to the adoption
of improvements favored hv the majority of
women."
Kehy L Holpton, 58, Oaks: "I live in a house
with 50 per cent seniors, and I think 75 per
cent, seniors would he a little too much. Stan
ford doesn't have sororities and they always
have promoted the 'family' way of life. This
new system would not be 'homey' at all. It
would be more like a glorified hotel."
Barbara Nik it man n, '59, lirannor: "Yes, it
is worth just about any sacrifice to me to have
senior preference. In be sure of having one of
my first preferences as a senior it would he
worth moving as a sophomore and junior. I
like the idea of six pirls drawing together and
drawing for individual houses (such as in Lap).

It will break down the idea of preferred places
on campus."
Heather Alexander, "57, Mariposa: "Al
though 1 disagree with several parts, I think
the majority of proposals in the plan are pood.
We do need a change in the drawing policy.
One had feature is that sophomore and fresh
man women have equal drawing opportunities,
w Inch isn t fair. I lie sophomores have had
more experience in tlie residence system: thev
should have [(reference privileges over the
freshmen."
Lois Brockiioef, "59, Robin: "I think it's a
very good idea, because those people who have
not yet had an opportunity to live where the\
want to will have n better chance."
Charlotte Putman, '57, Mariposa: "The
changes proposed by the new system, includ
ing the new senior preference svstem, are fine.
Hut I would like to see the mid-quarter draw
ing permitted."
Ja\ TaImADGE, '58, Oaks: "The way it is
now there isn t any real ratio. Under the new
system there wouldn't he either. I don't think
they should set any ratio at all."
Valerie \\ ili.iams, '59. Koble: "I'm in favor
of it. It's much more democratic and gives
more people a chance."
Liz Lund, 57. Mariposa: "The compulsory
drawing system included in the new proposals
is all right for the freshmen and the sopho
mores, hut I think the junior women should
he allowed to remain for their senior year, if
they prefer."

Kehy L Holpton, 58, Oaks: "I live in a house
with 50 per cent seniors, and I think 75 per
cent, seniors would he a little too much. Stan
ford doesn't have sororities and they always
have promoted the 'family' way of life. This
new system would not be 'homey' at all. It
would be more like a glorified hotel."
Barbara Nik it man n, '59, lirannor: "Yes, it
is worth just about any sacrifice to me to have
senior preference. In be sure of having one of
my first preferences as a senior it would he
worth moving as a sophomore and junior. I
like the idea of six pirls drawing together and
drawing for individual houses (such as in Lap).

It will break down the idea of preferred places
on campus."
Heather Alexander, "57, Mariposa: "Al
though 1 disagree with several parts, I think
the majority of proposals in the plan are pood.
We do need a change in the drawing policy.
One had feature is that sophomore and fresh
man women have equal drawing opportunities,
w Inch isn t fair. I lie sophomores have had
more experience in tlie residence system: thev
should have [(reference privileges over the
freshmen."
Lois Brockiioef, "59, Robin: "I think it's a
very good idea, because those people who have
not yet had an opportunity to live where the\
want to will have n better chance."
Charlotte Putman, '57, Mariposa: "The
changes proposed by the new system, includ
ing the new senior preference svstem, are fine.
Hut I would like to see the mid-quarter draw
ing permitted."
Ja\ TaImADGE, '58, Oaks: "The way it is
now there isn t any real ratio. Under the new
system there wouldn't he either. I don't think
they should set any ratio at all."
Valerie \\ ili.iams, '59. Koble: "I'm in favor
of it. It's much more democratic and gives
more people a chance."
Liz Lund, 57. Mariposa: "The compulsory
drawing system included in the new proposals
is all right for the freshmen and the sopho
mores, hut I think the junior women should
he allowed to remain for their senior year, if
they prefer."
What do YOli think?
Do you think that the proposed AWS hous
ing plan is an improvement over the old svs

Stanford women had this to say in answer
to the controversial question:
Carol Eyviann, '57, Mariposa: "Since not
every woman on campus can live in her first
choice residence every year, some sacrifices
must be made. Realizing this, the Housing
Evaluation Committee has suggested a svstem
of senior preference. In order for this system
to operate, it would he necessary that all wom
en draw every year because of the correspond
