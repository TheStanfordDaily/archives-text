## 
### 
Students at the University of |
California, known also as "The
Factory," are viewing with alarm |
"a reign of terror" at UCLA.
Recently in the Daily Cal an i
editorial described the Los An
geles branch chancellor Raymond
B. Allen as a "despot" who has
been conducting "something of a
reign of terror" in student govern
ment during the last two years.
"His (Allen's) administrations,
actions and methods rival those of
history's greatest despots," assist
ant editor Robert Falk wrote.
The editorial arose from the
chancellor's attempts to revise the
Student Legislative Council of
UCLA.
