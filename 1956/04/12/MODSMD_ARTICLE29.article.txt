look at Stanford's 1956 track team
in intercollegiate competition Sat
urday when the thinclads host

The meet will begin al 1:30 p.m.
in Stanford Stadium. Five Stan
-I'ord-UCLA dual meet records will
be jeopardized by the Bruins' xni
ler Bob Seaman ;ind weight man
Don Vick.
Seaman, the Bruins' great mid
die-distance man, could possibly
break three records Saturday.
In a quadrangular meet last
week at West wood, Seaman click
ed off a 4:07.9 mile.
That lime was almost three sec
onds under the dual meet record
of 4:10.7 set last year by the same
Seaman.
Having last year tied the half
mile mark of 1:54.7, Seaman
boasts a clocking of 1:49.9, well
under the record.
Seaman also threatens the two
mile mark of 9:20.5. He has re
corded a 9:20.6 two-mile and could,
on a good day, shatter the present
record.
Vick challenges two marks.
Having pushed the shot 57 feet 5
inches and heaved Ihe discus 107
leet 4 inches, Vick should crack
the dual-meet marks of 50% and
166-5 respectively.
