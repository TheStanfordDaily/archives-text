# Stanford Thinclads Host Speedy UCLA Tracksters
## Bruins Choice In Stadium Meet At 1:30 Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's varsity eindermen
will meet UCLA tomorrow in both
teams' first PCC dual meet of the
season at Stanford Stadium.
Field events will begin at 1:30
p.m. and the track races are sched
uled to get under way at 2.
UCLA will be favored in the
20th meeling of the two teams.
Last year the Bruins won a
down-to-l he-relay thriller, 69 to 62.
Stanford leads in the series, 13-6.
Coach Ducky Drake's team is
led by decathlon world record
holder Rafer Johnson. Johnson is
entered in the hurdles in four field
events shot, discus, broad jump
and javelin.
He has been timed this year at
: 14.1 in the highs and:22.7 in the
lows. Last year he matched the
time in the high sticks while run
ning a :22.5 low hurdle time.
Broad Jumper
Johnson jumped 24 feet 6%
inches last year also. His best
thus far this season lias been 23
feet 3 inches, which he did last
weekend.
His last year's marks would j
have been good enough to take
the 1953 NCAA meet low hurdles
and broad jump.
The Bruins will be out to break i
seven meet records. Russ Ellis is j
eyeing the present :47.3 time in |
the 440, and Bob Seaman, who ran j
the fastest collegiate clocking of i
the season of 4:07.9 in the mile, I
appears a cinch to wipe out his !
own meet mark of 4:10.7.
Johnson threatens both stick
standards.
Field Event Threats
Three field events are threat
ened by the Bruins. Don Vick's
57 feet 5 inches in tho shot is a
sure win, while his 175 foot Vz
inch toss of the discus should take
second and top that record also.
Ron Drummond has a best of 180
feet 0 inches. Nick Dyer is another j
potential meet record-breaker with i
0 feet 7's inches in the high jump. !
Stanford could win the century j
with Jim Saras. :09.7. UCLA's
Don Molloy and Nick Panagiotis
have hit the tape in 10 flat.
Bernie Nelson and Chuck Cobb
should offer Johnson trouble in
the high sticks. Nelson's best time
is :14.4.
Maury Graves with 9:34 in the
two-mile should heat Ted Banks
with 9:18. In the furlong, Saras
and Frank Herrmann should place
unless Ellis should enter. He has
been clocked in 21.3.
Herrmann Looks Good
Herrmann also looks the best
in the broad jump with a 24 foot!
3 inch best. Johnson of UCLA has i
been able to hit only 23 feet 3 inch- j
es thus far, which is over a foot!
under his all-time best. Footballer
Chuck Holloway has a best of 23
feet ll 7 / 8 inches.
Kirk Nieland and Hank Roldan i
have been flirting with 200 feet j
in the javelin.
Tricky winds in Stanford Sta
dium and second and third places
could conceivably make the meet
a close one.
