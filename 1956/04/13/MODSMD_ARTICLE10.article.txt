# War Threat in Middle East Grows Despite Arab-Israel Pledges Against Aggression
## U.S. Military Doubts Major War Imminent Western Big Three Meet on Middle East Proposed by French 
### 
(Compiled from United Press)
The Middle East came closer to
war yesterday despite the peace
making efforts of United Nations
Secretary-General Dag Hammar
skjold and behind-the-scenes at
tempts to soothe Arab-Israeli an
tagonism.
While the UN announced in
New York that Egypt and Israel
had given Hammarskjold uncon
ditional pledges to refrain from
aggressive warlike action, the
increasingly bitter border skir
mishes between Egypt and Israeli
ground forces spread to the air
and each side claimed it shot
down an enemy plane.
Israel said its interceptors
jumped two Egyptian British
built Vampire jets and two pro
peller - driven planes deep inside
Israeli territory, downing one of
the jets and seriously injuring
the pilot.
Egypt said one of its planes
"force landed" in Israel after
chasing an Israeli plane from its
air space. Egypt also said one of
its own aircraft shot down an
Israeli plane of unidentified type
over the El Auja demilitarized
zone dividing the two countries.
U.S. Doubt
Simultaneously, U.S. military
authorities expressed doubt that,
a full-scale Arab-Israel war is im
minent. The official U.S. military
view is that neither Egypt nor
even the "Arab bloc" nations com
bined have the military strength
as yet to defeat the Jewish na
tion.
This, they said, gives Dag Ham
marskjold, UN Secretary-General,
a limited "breathing space" in
which to try to ease the embit
tered tension in the gunfire-stud
ded Holy Land.
The U.S. government, mean
while, flatly denied rumors that
additional American forces are
being sent to the Mideast to keep
the peace.
Deny Marines
The State Department and the
Greek government also denied a
report from Athens that negotia
tions are under way with Greece
to station 1000 Marines on the
Mediterranean island of Crete for
possible use in the Mideast.
The Navy said the U.S. Sixth
Fleet, now stationed in the Medi
terranean with an 1800-man Ma
rine battalion aboard, will visit
Crete early next month for train
ing as it has done "many times in
the past."
French Plea
French plea for a conference ol
the Western Big Three foreign
ministers on the Mideast crisis
was made to Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles yesterday by
French Ambassador Maurice
Couve de Murville.
Informants said France be
lieves Dulles should meet with
French Foreign Minister Chris
tian Pineau and British Foreign
Secretary Selwyn Lloyd "very
rapidly" if the current Egypt-Is
rael tension remains critical or
grows worse.
