# Greek Explains Cyprus Issue In Talk Here
## Greek Consul Denies Country's Connection With Cyprus Crisis 
### 
In an unexpected answer to
"The Greek Side of the Cyprus
Question," Christian A. Axclos,
Consul - General of Greece, said
"there isn't a Greek side."
Denying Greece is directly con
nected with the current situation
in Cyprus, he said to the audience
at Bowman Alumni House yes
terday,"The real issue is not be
tween Greece and Great Britain;
it is between Cyprus and Great
Britain."
Axclos said the Cyprus prob
lem is "crystal clear." "One-half
million people no longer want to
live undev colonial rule, alien re
gime and foreign domination.
They want to be able to claim the
inalienable right of self-determi
nation. They insist to be left free
to decide for themselves their
freedom."
Greece wants Cyprus to be free
a lift is sponsoring the Cyprus is
sue in the United Nations, since
Cyprus can't do it herself, he
pointed out.
Three alternatives, as Axelos
sees it, arc: Cyprus will become
a crown colony of Great Britain;
she will gain her independence;
or she will unite with Greece.
"Greece would be the first to
accept and willingly abide no
matter what the verdict," he said.
Axelos said the Greeks on the
mainland are very sympathetic to
the Cypriots and their problems,
since they speak Greek, think
Greek and worship in the Greek
Orthodox faith.
