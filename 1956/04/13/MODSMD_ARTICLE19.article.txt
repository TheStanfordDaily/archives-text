I f iis wf.kk, temporarily ai leapt, Stanford stu
<lÂ«-111s lost I lie opportunitv of hearing and moot
ing Senator Ksies F. efauver, one of Iho fore
running candidates in tliis year's Presidential
election.
Phe senator, called back to Washington for
\\ ednesday's farm bill vote, had to postpone
liis Western visit until Monday, thus riding out
his Sunday appearance on this campus.
According t o his campaign headquarters in
San Francisco, i' was necessary for him to fid
fill campaign obligations in Florida before
hitting out for the West Coast. They empha
sized, though, that the senator would do his
best to come here some time in May dur
ing his v'uiri for the Democratic primary
bid.

Politicians are aware that university cam
puses are not the most lucrative areas for
amassing voles and that many, including Stan
lord, forbid any political campaigning'within
their domain.
.Nevertheless, several national figures have
devoted considerable attention, to the imple
mentation of political education on campuses,
many times sacrificing precious campaign time.
During the 1952 contests many candidates,
including Governor Goodwin Knight, his Dem
ocratic opponent, Richard Graves, and the
Democratic senatorial aspirant, Sam Yortv,
took time out to speak at Stanford.
We join with the Political Union in hoping
that, in the future, many more will see the
value of their appearance on this campus.
