# Evaluation of New AWS Housing Policy, Drawing System Proposal
## 
### 
mum limit of 7. r ) percent seniors would be set
for each group.
!t lias been pointed out that these two pref
erences destroy the "democracy" and "equal
opportunity'* which is stressed hv the authors
of tlie proposal. By giving seniors privileges
not offered other classes, the AWS Evaluation
Committee takes away "equal opportunity"
from the juniors and sophomores.
1 hey would fill the spaces left over by the
seniors, who would be given their choice.
After a week of discussion and campus opin
ion expressed in the Daily columns, the com
mittee has amended their proposal.
Freshmen will be allowed to vote on the
issue and a two-thirds majority will be required
to pass the plan. Before, it took only a simple
majority.
Final vote on the issue was scheduled for
April 16, but now, since it lwis become such an
explosive item, the "straw vote" will be de
layed a week until April 23.
It is an accepted fact that the present system
doesn't work. Ifut will the neic one ho any
betterY
Before the final vote is taken many more
amendments will have to be made, and they
probably >\ill be. Bv airing out the question
iu corridor and house meetings the equitable
answer can be reached.
