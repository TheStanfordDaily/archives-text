' Editor, The Daily:
Delia Upsilon: Gentlemen, I'm
| sorry if I misinterpreted your
| "just punishment of young boys." j
i But in your explanation of the !
! cause you bring out what I had
I expected. Had the spirit of fellow
ship prevailed as your high mo
tives pei 1 charter state, then why
were the irrational pledge acts
motivated?
By children, or by the tradition J
that all pledges should tend to
i tear the house down during their
| probationary trial period as neo
| phytes?
j Quoting from my pledge man
: ual, "Although one's rights re
main entirely unimpaired when
j one joins a fraternity, he must
adapt himself as much as possible
to its ways and standards." This
testing of a pledge had a purpose?
"The house should offer an out
i let for unselfish service, that it
I may stir the best emotions and
I develop latent manhood."
For some strange reason, when
j comparing your action with the
| quote there is some divergence.
: Unselfish service, best emotions,
j purpose—where and how do you
define and integrate these with
reality? My letler of Tuesday was
as I saw it and I wilj continue to
maintain it as true and unexag-
I gerated.
If the truth hurts, then perhaps '
you had better read your rule
book and see if it says that pledg
es should act as they did in a
j pledge sneak. If it is stated as
! such you will certainly receive a
formal apology from me for your
' "just punishment," as you call it. :
This I'm sure is nowhere de
| fined in your charter.
I realize that the young troops'
get a bit out of hand now and '
then, but what they did certainly
! isn't original. Why, in your high-,
j motive strivings, don't you rem-1
edy this? More help than hell !
would go along to "develop latent;
manhood." Perhaps some of this
(energy could go to increasing
| scholastic quality.
All the quotes used are true
! and can be verified by me at
Remele Hall, 110 Stanford Village.

Three cheers for Brian Wick
! land—defender of culture! Watch- i
! dog of public morals! Crusader ;
against savage instincts!
j' We, too, agree that appropriate j
action has been taken against a i
. singer like Nat "King" Cole, with j
I his "jumble of obscene jingles,
J vulgarisms and barbarian chants."
A look into some of his past popu
lar hits will reveal such savage
rock-and-roll as "Mona Lisa," "Na
j ture Boy," "Too Young," "Sand
; and the Sea" and "Y o un g at
! Heart."
Down with Nat "King" Cole,
Bing Crosby and the rest of the
jungle perverts!
We further agree with your
closing three regrets:
First, that the performer hap
pened to be a Negro. Why, it's per-,
fectly obvious that Perry Como j
would have received a similar wel-'
' coming. Pretty clever of you to j
| see through the NAACP's plan to !
j use Cole as a martyr.
j Sccond, that the audience was
! not punished with Mr. Cole. It's
| very clear that the millions of
Americans who listen to that type
| of music every day are just as un
civilized as Cole, Eddie Fisher and
Frank Sinatra. We offer this prac- |
tical suggestion: Why punish
them halfway? Off with their)
: heads!
Thirdly, that the individuals]
were arrested. They should be i
made national patriots for pre- j
serving the good old American j
culture. And why not send them
abroad as part of the State De
partment's good-will program?
We are both greatly indebted to
' you for your farsightedness and
your supreme command of the
English language. See you later,

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily editorial of Wednes
day was appreciated by the '56
Heritage Fund Committee. Al
though this committee does not
come in direct contact with the
student body, this publicity is en
couraging to us.
Since early this year the '56
Heritage F un d, through Senior
Class Excom, has been in opera
tion. Through the invaluable as
sistance of the General Secreta
ry's office, we have been able to
expand this tradition.
The efforts of 22 seniors on the
committee have resulted in more
than $10,000 in pledges, with so
licitations not yet closed. Penin
sula business men have responded
generously indeed.
We wish to express our grati
tude to the class of '59 for their
generous contribution. They them
selves, in fact, have established a
tradition by contributing to a pro
gram which will provide direct aid
to their own class members.
When the '56 Heritage Fund is
completed we hope to provide the
classes of '59 and '60 approximate
ly 20 scholarships.

' Editor, The Daily:
Delia Upsilon: Gentlemen, I'm
| sorry if I misinterpreted your
| "just punishment of young boys." j
i But in your explanation of the !
! cause you bring out what I had
I expected. Had the spirit of fellow
ship prevailed as your high mo
tives pei 1 charter state, then why
were the irrational pledge acts
motivated?
By children, or by the tradition J
that all pledges should tend to
i tear the house down during their
| probationary trial period as neo
| phytes?
j Quoting from my pledge man
: ual, "Although one's rights re
main entirely unimpaired when
j one joins a fraternity, he must
adapt himself as much as possible
to its ways and standards." This
testing of a pledge had a purpose?
"The house should offer an out
i let for unselfish service, that it
I may stir the best emotions and
I develop latent manhood."
For some strange reason, when
j comparing your action with the
| quote there is some divergence.
: Unselfish service, best emotions,
j purpose—where and how do you
define and integrate these with
reality? My letler of Tuesday was
as I saw it and I wilj continue to
maintain it as true and unexag-
I gerated.
If the truth hurts, then perhaps '
you had better read your rule
book and see if it says that pledg
es should act as they did in a
j pledge sneak. If it is stated as
! such you will certainly receive a
formal apology from me for your
' "just punishment," as you call it. :
This I'm sure is nowhere de
| fined in your charter.
I realize that the young troops'
get a bit out of hand now and '
then, but what they did certainly
! isn't original. Why, in your high-,
j motive strivings, don't you rem-1
edy this? More help than hell !
would go along to "develop latent;
manhood." Perhaps some of this
(energy could go to increasing
| scholastic quality.
All the quotes used are true
! and can be verified by me at
Remele Hall, 110 Stanford Village.

We further agree with your
closing three regrets:

The Daily editorial of Wednes
day was appreciated by the '56
Heritage Fund Committee. Al
though this committee does not
come in direct contact with the
student body, this publicity is en
couraging to us.
Since early this year the '56
Heritage F un d, through Senior
Class Excom, has been in opera
tion. Through the invaluable as
sistance of the General Secreta
ry's office, we have been able to
expand this tradition.
The efforts of 22 seniors on the
committee have resulted in more
than $10,000 in pledges, with so
licitations not yet closed. Penin
sula business men have responded
generously indeed.
We wish to express our grati
tude to the class of '59 for their
generous contribution. They them

licitations not yet closed. Penin
sula business men have responded
generously indeed.
We wish to express our grati
tude to the class of '59 for their
generous contribution. They them
selves, in fact, have established a
tradition by contributing to a pro
gram which will provide direct aid
to their own class members.
When the '56 Heritage Fund is
completed we hope to provide the
classes of '59 and '60 approximate
ly 20 scholarships.

' Editor, The Daily:
Delia Upsilon: Gentlemen, I'm
| sorry if I misinterpreted your
| "just punishment of young boys." j
i But in your explanation of the !
! cause you bring out what I had
I expected. Had the spirit of fellow
ship prevailed as your high mo
tives pei 1 charter state, then why
were the irrational pledge acts
motivated?
By children, or by the tradition J
that all pledges should tend to
i tear the house down during their
| probationary trial period as neo
| phytes?
j Quoting from my pledge man
: ual, "Although one's rights re
main entirely unimpaired when
j one joins a fraternity, he must
adapt himself as much as possible
to its ways and standards." This
testing of a pledge had a purpose?
"The house should offer an out
i let for unselfish service, that it
I may stir the best emotions and
I develop latent manhood."
For some strange reason, when
j comparing your action with the
| quote there is some divergence.
: Unselfish service, best emotions,
j purpose—where and how do you
define and integrate these with
reality? My letler of Tuesday was
as I saw it and I wilj continue to
maintain it as true and unexag-
I gerated.
If the truth hurts, then perhaps '
you had better read your rule
book and see if it says that pledg
es should act as they did in a
j pledge sneak. If it is stated as
! such you will certainly receive a
formal apology from me for your
' "just punishment," as you call it. :
This I'm sure is nowhere de
| fined in your charter.
I realize that the young troops'
get a bit out of hand now and '
then, but what they did certainly
! isn't original. Why, in your high-,
j motive strivings, don't you rem-1
edy this? More help than hell !
would go along to "develop latent;
manhood." Perhaps some of this
(energy could go to increasing
| scholastic quality.
All the quotes used are true
! and can be verified by me at
Remele Hall, 110 Stanford Village.

Three cheers for Brian Wick
! land—defender of culture! Watch- i
! dog of public morals! Crusader ;
against savage instincts!
j' We, too, agree that appropriate j
action has been taken against a i
. singer like Nat "King" Cole, with j
I his "jumble of obscene jingles,
J vulgarisms and barbarian chants."
A look into some of his past popu
lar hits will reveal such savage
rock-and-roll as "Mona Lisa," "Na
j ture Boy," "Too Young," "Sand
; and the Sea" and "Y o un g at
! Heart."
Down with Nat "King" Cole,
Bing Crosby and the rest of the
jungle perverts!
We further agree with your
closing three regrets:
First, that the performer hap
pened to be a Negro. Why, it's per-,
fectly obvious that Perry Como j
would have received a similar wel-'
' coming. Pretty clever of you to j
| see through the NAACP's plan to !
j use Cole as a martyr.
j Sccond, that the audience was
! not punished with Mr. Cole. It's
| very clear that the millions of
Americans who listen to that type
| of music every day are just as un
civilized as Cole, Eddie Fisher and
Frank Sinatra. We offer this prac- |
tical suggestion: Why punish
them halfway? Off with their)
: heads!
Thirdly, that the individuals]
were arrested. They should be i
made national patriots for pre- j
serving the good old American j
culture. And why not send them
abroad as part of the State De
partment's good-will program?
We are both greatly indebted to
' you for your farsightedness and
your supreme command of the
English language. See you later,

couraging to us.
Since early this year the '56

sistance of the General Secreta
ry's office, we have been able to
expand this tradition.
The efforts of 22 seniors on the
committee have resulted in more
