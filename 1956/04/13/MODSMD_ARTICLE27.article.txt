ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 3
Today, ranging again into the fascinating world of social
science, let us take up the subjgct of anthropology — the study
of man and his origins.
The origin of man was indeed a vexing question until the
Frenchman, Jean-Louis Sigafoos, discovered the skull and shin
bone of Pithecanthropus Erectus in Java in 1891. (What Siga
foos was doing in Java is, incidentally, quite an odd little story.
Sigafoos was a Parisian born and bred. By day one could always
find him at a boulevard cafe, sipping liiere de Racine and ogling
the girls; each night he went to a fashionable casino where he
gambled heavily at roulette ar.d jacks, in between times he
worked on his stamp collection.

CWell sir, one summer Sigafoos lost his entire fortune gam
bling at the casino, and he was seriously contemplating suicide
when a ray of hope appeared in an unexpected quarter. It seems
thut Sigafoos, through the international stamp collectors'jour
nal, had long been in correspondence with a girl in Java, a
mission-educated savage named Lotus Petal McGinnis, herself
an enthusiastic stamp collector. The nature of their correspond
ence, though friendly, had been entirely philatelic. Now, sud
denly, a new kind of letter came from Lotus Petal. She declared
that although she had never laid eyes on Sigafoos, she loved
him and wanted to marry him. She said she was eighteen years
old, beautiful, and her father, the richest man in his tribe, would
give half his fortune to the husband of her choice. Sigafoos,
in his reduced circumstances, had no alternative; he sold his
last few belongings and boojcrd passage for .Java.
(The first sight of his prospective bride failed to delight
Sigafoos. She was, as she said, beautiful — but only by local
standards. Sigafoos had serious doubts that her bright red
pointed teeth and the chicken bones hanging from her ear lobes
would be considered chic along the Champs Elysees.
(.But sobering as was the sight o<" Lotus Petal, Sigafoos had
an even greater disappointment coming when he met her father.
The old gentleman was, as Lotus Petal had represented, the
richest man in his tribe, but, unfortunately, the medium of ex
change in his tribe was prune pits.
(Sigafoos took one look at the mound of prune pits which
was his dowry, gnashed his teeth, and stomped off into the
jungle, swearing vilely and kicking at sticks and stones and
whatever else lay in his path. Stomping thus, swearing thus,
kicking thus, Sigafoos kicked over a heap of old bones which —
what do you know!—turned out to be the skull and shin of
Pithecanthropus Erectus.)
But I digress... From the brutish Pithecanthropus, man
evolved slowly upward, growing more intelligent and resource
ful. By the Middle Paleolithic period man had invented the
leash, which was a remarkable technical achievement, but
frankly not terribly useful until the Mesolithic period when man
invented the dog.
in the Neolithic period came far and away the most important
development in the history of mankind —the discovery of agri
culture. Why is this so important, you ask? Because, good
friends, without agriculture there would be no tobacco, and
without tobacco there would be no Philip Morris, and without
Philip Morris you would be without the gentlest, mildest, sun
niest, pleasantest, happiest smoke that money can buy, and I
would be without a job.
Phat S why. (T,Mh Shulman, 19' C
To their Neolithic ancestor#, the makers of Philip Morris extend
a grateful salute. And so ivill yon when yon try today's neic gentle
Philip Morris in today's neiv pack of red, white and gold.
