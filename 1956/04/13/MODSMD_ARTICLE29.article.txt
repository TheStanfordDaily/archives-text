# HEALTH EDUCATION FOR MILLIONS
## World Health Organization Celebrates Eighth Anniversary with 79 Members 
### Peter Kirianoff 
On April 7, World Health Or
ganization, a permanent agency
of the United Nations, celebrated
its eighth anniversary with the
observance of World Health Day.
Proposed originally at the San
Francisco United Nations Confer
ence in 1945, the organization
became a reality when represen
tatives of 61 nations met at the
International Health Conference
in 1946. A constitution was drawn
up and on Sept. 1, 1948, WHO was
officially incorporated into the
United Nations.
WHO now has 79 member
states and three associate mem
bers. Since 1948 nine Central and
Eastern European countries and
China have dropped their mem
bership.
WHO Objective
WHO's objective is "the attain
ment by all peoples of the high
est level of health." In its con
stitution health is defined as "a
state of complete physical, men
tal and social well-being and not
merely the absence of disease or
infirmity."
Major e m p It asis has been
placed by WHO on attempts to
reduce the toll of endemic and
epidemic communicable diseases.
Concentrated efforts have been
made toward improving resist
ance to these diseases, control
ling the carriers of disease, re
ducing animal and human reser
voirs of infection and promoting
research.
A world campaign of malarial
control was organized with WHO
assisting countries in the 1 malaria
belt from Afghanistan to tiie
Windward Islands.
TB Campaign
An International Tuberculosis
Campaign ended in June 1951
after .'-58 million children in 22
countries had been tuberculin
tested and 18 million non-reactors
had been vaccinated wilh BOG.
This was the first time mass tu

berculin testing had been carried
out in countries such as Burma,
Pakistan, Egypt and India.
A second program carried out
by WHO in co-operation with
UNESCO is the training of teach
ers in mental hygiene and en
couraging them to take advan
tage of opportunities afforded
within schools for promoting
mental health among children.
An expert advisory panel on
the health education of the public
was established by WHO in 1951.
Health Consultants
Not only is WHO providing per
sonnel for fundamental education
programs, it is furnishing health
education consultants and admin
istrators for governments of vari
ous countries.
Note has been taken of increas
ing awareness of many countries
to the fact that effective develop
ment of health programs depends
to a considerable extent on health
education.
In line with this, WHO has con
tinued to assist countries in train
ing leaders in health education
and, at the same time, has placed
emphasis upon professional train
ing in health education and on the
type of work that stimulates a
bettor understanding of the need
for health education and the
methods for meeting that need.
Nutrition Training
Nutrition training is another
program carried out by WHO.
Malnutrition is due largely to
poverty, but a considerable
amount of it is traceable to the
lack of knowledge of what con
stitutes a well-balanced diet.
Through experience WHO has
discovered that to be effective
health education should be car
ried out on the village level.
Educational programs directed
by WHO are of two typos:
• The development: of public
health education programs, meth
ods and techniques.
• The training of public health

and health education personnel]
through provision of fellowships
and actual field training courses, j
WHO Regions
There are six WHO regions: \
African region, with headquar
ters at Brazzaville; region of the
Americas, with headquarters in
Washington; Southeast Asia re
gion, with headquarters in New
Delhi; European region, with
headquarters in Geneva; Eastern
Mediterranean region, with head
quarters in Alexandria, and West
ern Pacific region, with headquar
ters in Manila.
The United States is also one of
the nations covered by the field
operations of WHO and is also
receiving the benefits of its pro
grams financially.
United States investments
abroad amounted to $10 million.
During the period from 1919 to
1952 U.S. industry increased its
direct investments in Africa and
Asia by 65 per cent and in Latin
America by 25 per cent.
More Americans Abroad
Because of this, there has been
an enormous increase in the num-!
her of Ameri can s working
abroad. The health conditions of
the countries in which the United
States has investments have be
come increasingly important.
Economy is most stable only
under circumstances of increas
ing trade and, with less well de
veloped areas of the world, can
continue to grow only as the
economy of those areas improves.
One means of attaining this
improvement is the betterment of
health conditions. This is what j
WHO is doing.

WHO Regions
There are six WHO regions: \
African region, with headquar
ters at Brazzaville; region of the
Americas, with headquarters in
Washington; Southeast Asia re
gion, with headquarters in New
Delhi; European region, with
headquarters in Geneva; Eastern
Mediterranean region, with head
quarters in Alexandria, and West
ern Pacific region, with headquar
ters in Manila.
The United States is also one of
the nations covered by the field
operations of WHO and is also
receiving the benefits of its pro
grams financially.
United States investments
abroad amounted to $10 million.
During the period from 1919 to
1952 U.S. industry increased its
direct investments in Africa and
Asia by 65 per cent and in Latin
America by 25 per cent.
More Americans Abroad
Because of this, there has been
an enormous increase in the num-!
her of Ameri can s working
abroad. The health conditions of
the countries in which the United
States has investments have be
come increasingly important.
Economy is most stable only
under circumstances of increas
ing trade and, with less well de
veloped areas of the world, can
continue to grow only as the
economy of those areas improves.
One means of attaining this
improvement is the betterment of
health conditions. This is what j
WHO is doing.
On April 7, World Health Or
ganization, a permanent agency
of the United Nations, celebrated
its eighth anniversary with the
observance of World Health Day.
Proposed originally at the San
Francisco United Nations Confer
ence in 1945, the organization
became a reality when represen
tatives of 61 nations met at the
International Health Conference
in 1946. A constitution was drawn
up and on Sept. 1, 1948, WHO was
officially incorporated into the
United Nations.
WHO now has 79 member
states and three associate mem
bers. Since 1948 nine Central and
Eastern European countries and
China have dropped their mem
bership.
WHO Objective
WHO's objective is "the attain
ment by all peoples of the high
est level of health." In its con
stitution health is defined as "a
state of complete physical, men
tal and social well-being and not
merely the absence of disease or
infirmity."
Major e m p It asis has been
placed by WHO on attempts to
reduce the toll of endemic and
epidemic communicable diseases.
Concentrated efforts have been
made toward improving resist
ance to these diseases, control
ling the carriers of disease, re
ducing animal and human reser
voirs of infection and promoting
research.
A world campaign of malarial
control was organized with WHO
assisting countries in the 1 malaria
belt from Afghanistan to tiie
Windward Islands.
TB Campaign
An International Tuberculosis
Campaign ended in June 1951
after .'-58 million children in 22
countries had been tuberculin
tested and 18 million non-reactors
had been vaccinated wilh BOG.
This was the first time mass tu

berculin testing had been carried
out in countries such as Burma,
Pakistan, Egypt and India.
A second program carried out
by WHO in co-operation with
UNESCO is the training of teach
ers in mental hygiene and en
couraging them to take advan
tage of opportunities afforded
within schools for promoting
mental health among children.
An expert advisory panel on
the health education of the public
was established by WHO in 1951.
Health Consultants
Not only is WHO providing per
sonnel for fundamental education
programs, it is furnishing health
education consultants and admin
istrators for governments of vari
ous countries.
Note has been taken of increas
ing awareness of many countries
to the fact that effective develop
ment of health programs depends
to a considerable extent on health
education.
In line with this, WHO has con
tinued to assist countries in train
ing leaders in health education
and, at the same time, has placed
emphasis upon professional train
ing in health education and on the
type of work that stimulates a
bettor understanding of the need
for health education and the
methods for meeting that need.

ling the carriers of disease, re
ducing animal and human reser
voirs of infection and promoting
research.
A world campaign of malarial
control was organized with WHO
assisting countries in the 1 malaria
belt from Afghanistan to tiie
Windward Islands.
TB Campaign
An International Tuberculosis
Campaign ended in June 1951
after .'-58 million children in 22
countries had been tuberculin
tested and 18 million non-reactors
had been vaccinated wilh BOG.
This was the first time mass tu

berculin testing had been carried
out in countries such as Burma,
Pakistan, Egypt and India.
A second program carried out
by WHO in co-operation with
UNESCO is the training of teach
ers in mental hygiene and en
couraging them to take advan
tage of opportunities afforded
within schools for promoting
mental health among children.
An expert advisory panel on
the health education of the public
was established by WHO in 1951.
Health Consultants
Not only is WHO providing per
sonnel for fundamental education
programs, it is furnishing health
education consultants and admin
istrators for governments of vari
ous countries.
Note has been taken of increas
ing awareness of many countries
to the fact that effective develop
ment of health programs depends
to a considerable extent on health
education.
In line with this, WHO has con
tinued to assist countries in train
ing leaders in health education
and, at the same time, has placed
emphasis upon professional train
ing in health education and on the
type of work that stimulates a
bettor understanding of the need
for health education and the
methods for meeting that need.
Nutrition Training
Nutrition training is another
program carried out by WHO.
Malnutrition is due largely to
poverty, but a considerable
amount of it is traceable to the
lack of knowledge of what con
stitutes a well-balanced diet.
Through experience WHO has
discovered that to be effective
health education should be car
ried out on the village level.
Educational programs directed
by WHO are of two typos:
• The development: of public
health education programs, meth
ods and techniques.
• The training of public health

and health education personnel]
through provision of fellowships
and actual field training courses, j
WHO Regions
There are six WHO regions: \
African region, with headquar
ters at Brazzaville; region of the
Americas, with headquarters in
Washington; Southeast Asia re
gion, with headquarters in New
Delhi; European region, with
headquarters in Geneva; Eastern
Mediterranean region, with head
quarters in Alexandria, and West
ern Pacific region, with headquar
ters in Manila.
The United States is also one of
the nations covered by the field
operations of WHO and is also
receiving the benefits of its pro
grams financially.
United States investments
abroad amounted to $10 million.
During the period from 1919 to
1952 U.S. industry increased its
direct investments in Africa and
Asia by 65 per cent and in Latin
America by 25 per cent.
More Americans Abroad
Because of this, there has been
an enormous increase in the num-!
her of Ameri can s working
abroad. The health conditions of
the countries in which the United
States has investments have be
come increasingly important.
Economy is most stable only
under circumstances of increas
ing trade and, with less well de
veloped areas of the world, can
continue to grow only as the
economy of those areas improves.
One means of attaining this
improvement is the betterment of
health conditions. This is what j
WHO is doing.
On April 7, World Health Or
ganization, a permanent agency
of the United Nations, celebrated
its eighth anniversary with the
observance of World Health Day.
Proposed originally at the San
Francisco United Nations Confer
ence in 1945, the organization
became a reality when represen
tatives of 61 nations met at the
International Health Conference
in 1946. A constitution was drawn
up and on Sept. 1, 1948, WHO was
officially incorporated into the
United Nations.
WHO now has 79 member
states and three associate mem
bers. Since 1948 nine Central and
Eastern European countries and
China have dropped their mem
bership.
WHO Objective
WHO's objective is "the attain
ment by all peoples of the high
est level of health." In its con
stitution health is defined as "a
state of complete physical, men
tal and social well-being and not
merely the absence of disease or
infirmity."
Major e m p It asis has been
placed by WHO on attempts to
reduce the toll of endemic and
epidemic communicable diseases.
Concentrated efforts have been
made toward improving resist
ance to these diseases, control
ling the carriers of disease, re
ducing animal and human reser
voirs of infection and promoting
research.
