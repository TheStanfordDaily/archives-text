## 
### 
Students are warned that there
are two or more "transient maga
zine salesmen" now illegally prac
ticing their trade on campus, ac
cording to Police Chief Gordon
Davis.
Two complaints of such ped
dlers came in recently to the Stan
ford police. The woman who is
sued one complaint had paid a
strange salesman $18 as a down
payment.
The other complainant, also a
woman, said she had signed a
blank check and given it to a ped
dler.
One salesman, according to the
complaint, was stockily built and
wore a blue suit. Mentioned in the
other complaint was a peddler
clad in a bright pink sports shirt
and tan slacks.
Anyone possessing any infor
mation as to the whereabouts of
either' of these salesmen is re
quested to call the Stanford Police
Department, according to Davis.
It is legal for students to sell
magazines on campus. However,
selling by strangers is prohibited,
Davis said.
