# Cards Out to Hold CIBA Lead Against Hapless Santa Clarans
## Payne to Pitch Saturday Game On Home Field 
### Bill Nichols 
Stanford's le&gue-leading base
bailers relurn to California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association ac
tion this weekend with two games
against Santa Clara.
Stanford journeys to Washing
ton Field today for a 3 p.m. game,
and Santa Clara comes to the
Sunken Diamond tomorrow for a
3:15 contest.
Stanford, currently leading by
only percentage opints over USC,
will be hard pressed to maintain
that lead because the Trojans play
last-place UCLA twice this week
end.
Coa<;h Dutch Fehring will pitch
Ray Young (5-1 > on Friday and
Walt Payne (4-1) on Saturday.
Payne beat the Broncos in both
ends of a doubleheader last sea
son, and Young pitched Stanford
to a 15-4 win over Santa Clara
early this season.

Mediocre Opponents
The Cards have a 16-3-1 record
so Car this season bu! have not
played too many top-flight oppo
nents. The Alumni, San Jose State
and the San Diego Marines have
been the only non - conference
teams to play close contests with
the Indians.
That situation will be remedied
next weekend, though, when I JSC
comes in for a doubleheader.
Santa Clara has some good hit
ters, John Rusu, .542 in CIBA ac
tion, and Dick Venezla topping
the list, but their pitching has held
them back. Only sophomore Zip
Keitgis has pitched winning ball
for the Broncos.
Hefty Averages
Stanford can counter with a
lineup of nine hitters over the .300
mark and a first-team average, ex
clusive of pitcher, of .358. The
over-all team average is a healthy
.311.
II u d y Figueroa, lowest hitter
among the regulars with a .314
average, has been hitting at a
much higher rate lately. He has
pulled his mark up from .200 dur
ing the last three weeks.
The pitchers also can put forth
some fancy figures. The team's
earned-run average is 1.99 com
pared to 0.72 for the opposition.
Stanford hurlers have chalked up
115 strikeouts in IG7 innings of
pitching while allowing 123 hits
and walking 61.
Ed Verdurmen, who pitched the
first no-hit, no-run game in Stan
lord record books which go back
to 1920, has given up only two hits
in his last 15 innings of pitching
and will be in the bull pen. if either
Young or Payne falter.
Few Homers
Bob Evans leads the team in
hits \Vith 20. followed closely by
A 1 Shaw with 25. Mickey Holzman
is the top walk-getter with 23 and
base-stealer with 14. Steve Stew
art has five doubles, Evans has
five triples and four have a homer
apiece to lead the extra-base blow
department.
Evans has a big lead in the runs
batted-in column with 26.
The probable lineup and bat
ting averages for the two games:
Mickey Holzman, cf 369
Bob Fletcher, rf 353
A 1 Shaw, 2b 374
Hal Messner, lb 366
Bob Evans, If 338
Rudy Figueroa, 3b 314
Steve Stewart, ss 393
Ralph Holding, c 384
Ray Young, p 310
Walt Payne, p 300
For pinch-hitters, Fehring can
call upon Doug Camilli, who was
first-string catcher until recently;
George Avery, up from the Frosh;
and A 1 Spurgeon.
