# Minnesota Faculty Votes Down Renewal of Rose Bowl Pact
## Pact Is Up for Renewal Next Year; ten Must Vote at May Meeting 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., April 12 (UP) The Faculty Senate of the
University of Minnesota today rejected a proposed renewal of the
I Rose Bowl pact with Ihe Pacific Coast Conference, forcing the Big
i Ten to submit renewal to another vote.
Professor Henry Rottshaefer, Minnesota faculty representative,

said the senate rejected the pro
posal "overwhelmingly" in a quick
vote.
Minnesota thus maintained its
consistent opposition to the Rose
Bowl agreement with its fourth
| adverse vote.
The action will force the Big
Ten to re-submit renewal of the
â€¢ pact to all conference representa-
I tives at their next meeting in Min
| neapolis, May 25-26.
The present Bowl pact with the
j Pacific Coast Conference is the
[ third and has one more year 1o
run.
The PCC two months ago in
vited the Big Ten to renew the
agreement on a "continuing" ba
sis. The proposed contract would
be for an indefinite period and
could be terminated on notice by
; either party as long as two games
I are played after the termination
i notice is given.
