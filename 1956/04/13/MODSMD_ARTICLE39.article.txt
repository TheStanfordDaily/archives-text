intramural thriller to move into
ihe semi-finals of the basketbalf

Sigma Chi I raced to an easy
45-23 victory over the Frosh Me
dics. In the other contest played
in the gym, Delt I, led by a 14-
point barrage by Denny Mahoney,
.overcame a late KA I rally to post
a 45-29 conquest.
Jim Kelly and Dick Farmer
pushed in 12 and 10 points respec
tively to aid Mahoney fill out the
Delts' rounded attack.
Zetes Romp
The rough-and-tumble Zetes, de
fending intramural basketball
champs, ground Chi Psi I into the
hardwoods, 33-20. Hotshot Rick
Carver, big gun for the Zotes, tal
lied 11 points to pace their attack.
The Zetes used their strong re
bounding advantage to great use
as they often took three or four
shots to score. Footballers Bill
Tarr and John Brodie continually
hounded the ball, setting up many
<jf the Zetes' scoring plays with
accurate passes.
Size Helps
Chi Psi threatened occasionally,
but greater size helped the Zetes
to hold a comfortable margin all
the way. The half time score was
15-7.
John Furst's spectacular driv
ing lay-ins were the top scoring
threat for the Chi Psi's. Furst
knifed his way through the de
tense for seven points.
The Zetes just outmanned the
ironman Chi Psi five.
The Kappa Sig- Sigma Chi II
game was rated as one of the sea

son's top games hy an official.
Sigma Chi fired their way to an
early lead and held on to it for a
1(5-13 bulge at the halfway mark.
Good defensive work by Kappa
Sig star Larry Ghilarducci kept
high-scoring Rock Conklin of Sig
ma Chi away from the ball on of
fense throughout the game. Ghi
larducci himself paced a Kappa
Sig drive in the race-horse finish.
Sophomore gridder Jack Taylor
turned out to be an effective eager
as he racked up three field goals,
one of them a flashy driving lay
in, and a free throw for seven
first-half points. He added five
more in the second half.
Brother Act
Sigma Chi held on to their lead
until the second half was about
seven minutes old. George Ghilar
ducci swished a pair of free
throws to close the margin to 22-
19, and brother Larry Ghilarducci
stuffed in a lay-in a moment later.
George again took the spotlight
as the halfway mark was reached
in the second stanza by shoving a
follow shot through the nets. This
gave Kappa Sig their only lead at
23-22.
Undefeated Record
After a brief time-out, Sigma
Chi set out to protect their defeat
less record in earnest. Roch Conk
lin pushed in a free throw to knot
the score.
Caution was the word for the
next few minutes as both quintets
looked carefully for an opening.
Wally Oates of Sigma Chi found it
and quickly potted a 20-foot set
shot and a pair of free throws to
open a four-point gap. After that,
despite hot shooting by Larry Ghi
larducci in the final two minutes,
Sigma Chi was never threatened.
The final score was 33-29.
