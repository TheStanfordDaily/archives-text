### 
Stanford Art Gallery and Mu
scum will purchase three new
paintings annually.
Previously most paintings have
been either borrowed or rented.
A few have been donated by
friends of the University.
Starting with the first annual
Purchase Awards Exhibition, to
bo open to the public in the Art
Gallery from April 17 to May 20,
the Committee for Art at Stan
ford wrtl annually select three
paintings from each exhibition to
purchase for permanent displays.
Purchase Awards Exhibitions
will have one painting from each
of a large group of carefully se
lected artists.
The Committee for Art, which
is a private group not officially
connected with the University,
will award first, second and third
prizes, and Ihe three top entries
will he purchased at individually
established prices not to exceed
$1000.
Mrs. Helen Cross, associate di
rector of both tho Art Gallery and
the Museum, pointed out that in
many cases t he pictures would or
dinarily have selling prices at
above $1000, but that most artists
arc willing to sell to a university
for less because of the honor and
prestige.
All artists at the coming display
arc contemporary, and their paint
ings range from abstract through
realistic.
