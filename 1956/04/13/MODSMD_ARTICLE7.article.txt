# Patron System Change Passed By Legislature
## Last Quarter's Social Regulation Plan Cuts Closed Party Patrons 
### 
Wednesday night in Legisla-:
ture, changes in the social regula
| tions system proposed by Social
| Co-ordinating Board last quarter i
j were finally passed.
The new system will become
effective on May 1 and according
| to ASSU Vice-President Helen Za
| rifes, all parties which have al
ready been registered for dates
i after May 1 must be re-registered
| to conform to the new rules.
Among the changes in the so
cial set-up are those eliminating
1 the requirement of a patron or
, adult guest at closed parties on
or off campus. Two patron
couples will be required, how
ever. for all-campus parties or
those involving more than one
j living group, casa or corridor.
Miss Zarifes amplified this by '
explaining that one Lagunita casa
j could hold a closed party and
would not be required to have a
patron. However, if two Lagunita j
casas sponsored a closed party, I
j two patron couples would be re-
I quired.
Overnight Parties
According to the new system,
two couples, including one mar
ried couple, must be present at
all overnight parties.
Changes were also made in the
j eligibility requirements for adult
guests. According to the new set
up, members of the University
staff, academic or administrative,
resident assistants, house mol ti
ers, directors or parents of mem
bers of the group sponsoring the
party may be adult guests,
i Chapter advisers also qualify
as adult guests in the case of fra
i ternities.
Somewhat different regulations
have been set up for all freshman j
events. They will have the same
requirements in regard to all-cam-j
pus and overnight functions but.
in addition, one adult guest
I couple will be required for all
closed events.
Sponsors Included
Sponsors or faculty residents
are included in this category.
In addition, the new system in
cludes the fining schedule used
by SCB for failure to register par
ties, registering them late or for
proceeding to hold a party after
it has been disapproved by SCB.
Deadlines for party registra
tion, according to Miss Zarifes,
are:
• For all closed functions, 5
p.m. on the Tuesday preceding
the party.
• For overnight parties and all
campus functions, 5 p.m. on the
Tuesday two weeks before the
party.
Informal exchanges may be
registered at any time up until
the date it takes place, Miss Za
i rifes said.
She also pointed out that, al
; though in some instances groups
will no longer be required to have
j patrons, this does not prohibit
them from inviting adult guests.
