## 
### Frank Huntress 
UCLA's Rafer Johnson took
only one leap in the broad jump
and swept both hurdle events for
three first places to pace the
Bruins to a smashing 86! 3 to 44%
victory over the Indians Saturday
in Stanford Stadium.
The world decathlon record
holder's winning .jump was 24
feet, 10'i inches. His top competi
tor. PCC champion Frank Herr
mann. pulled a muscle on his sec
ond jump and had to retire for
the rest of the day. Herrmann
was scheduled to run in the 100-
and 220-yard dashes.
Johnson finished ahead of In
dian Bernie Nelson in the high
sticks in :11.3 and took the lows
in :23.6.

Three meet records were bro
ken in what was Stanford's worst
defeat at the hands of the Bruins.
Phil Fehlen of Stanford cleared
the high jump bar at 6 feet, 5 7/ s
inches—three-eighths of an inch
better than the previous meet
best—for a new meet record.
Bruin Don Vick heaved the shot
56 feet, 5% inches for another
meet standard. The old record
was 56-% set by former Stanford
great Otis Chandler.
The third record was set by
Ron Drummond in the discus. He
bettered his own meet record
which he set last year with a
toss of 166 feet, 10 Ms inches.
Saras Doubles
UCLA's middle distance star,
Russ Ellis, took the 440-yard dash
in :48.9 and ran the anchor lap
of the mile relay.
Jim Saras was Stanford's only
double winner. He took the cen
tury in 10 seconds flat and the
furlong in :22.2.
Saras trailed Bruin Nick Pana
giotis for the first 75 yards of the
100-yard dash. But 10 yards from
the finish the chunky Indian
speedster passed him for tlie win.
In the 220 Saras led favored
Ellis all the way to win.
The only other dual winner of
the day was Bruin Bob Seaman.
He won the mile in a slow 4:19.0
and the 880 in 1:55.6.
Graves Victorious
Stanford's distance ace. Maury
Graves, won his specialty the
two-mile run in 9:34.5 and tied

The Indians were favorer! to
win the pole vault but Bill Flint
and John Whalcn managed to
clear only 13-6 to tie John Mitch
ell for second place. Lindy Kell
of UCLA did his season's best by
clearing the bar at 14-%.
Tight Relay

any bearing on the meet it was
exciting. Bob Goldstone managed
a yard and a half lead on Stan
ford's Bob Hyde on the opening
lap. Bob Carne increased the
Bruins' lead to six yards over-
Bill Carls and Seaman kept it at
six over Myron Hollistcr.
On the last lap Chuck Incc
