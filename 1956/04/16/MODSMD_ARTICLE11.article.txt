WASHINGTON, April 1.1 (UP)
Communist nations have grant
ed more tlian half a billion dol
lars in aid to 12 underdeveloped
nations in the past year in an ef
fort to woo them from the free
world.
A United Press survey showed
that at least $506 million in credit
has been extended by Soviet bloe
countries in 19.").") and the first few
months of 1956. The survey was
based on official information as
sembled from a variety of govern
ment sources.
There is no doubt but that. So
viet progress in playing down the
sword and playing up the plow
share has the Administration
worried. Most U.S. officials fear
that the economic penetration of
underdeveloped nations by the
Reds is sure to he accompanied
by political penetration.
The new Communist strategy,
particularly its possible impact on
the turbulent Middle East, is un
der intensive review at the State
Department.
