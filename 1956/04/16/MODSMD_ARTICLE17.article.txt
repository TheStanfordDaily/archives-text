# Hiss and Americanism
## 
### 
a new spark, touched off an old controversy
last week when Princeton University's debate
society invited Alger Hiss to speak before the
group on "The Meaning of Ceneva."
112 irmly declaring that the invitation did not
imply tacit approval of Hiss' past actions,
spokesmen for the group explained that its
aiin is to "present speakers whose views may
contribute to the understanding of public is
sues."
"We feel," they said, "that Hiss is in a posi
tion to further this aim."
Princeton's student newspaper, The Prince
lonian, has also joined the fight and last
'4 hursday sent a telegram to several New Jer
sey Congressmen further defining the issue.
"Yi hether or not we approve of the act of
perjury," it concluded, "as we most certainly
do not is not the question. The question is
w ill you allow us to be curious or will you in
sist upon telling us what to be curious about."
I he howl of protest did not take long in
coming.
Last Saturday a columnist in the San Fran
cisco Call-Bulletin first condemned the group's
action as "morally revolting" and then dis
missed it as a publicity stunt.
In its editorial columns the same day, the
San Fivneiseo Examiner castigated the group
a- committing an "adolescent goof" and said
the incident "shapes up as one of those rebel
lious gestures of the young that has no reason
to support it.*"
I \cn the halls of Congress did not escape
the storm. Representative James Tumulty (!)-
NJ.I somewhat facetiously suggested "there's
a little poison ivy creeping into tin* JU \
I iCauue."

ll seems to us thai these critics are blinded
by that intangible, evasive "Communist threat"
which so often throws a.wet blanket on the in
tellectual pursuits and healthy "re
bellious'" youth.
But this damper imposed on student, curi
osity is more than just frustrating to those who
try t») understand the why's of history—those
who would rather question than accept.
It is symptomatic of a nation's nervousness,
somewhat quieted now, over a threat blown out
of all proportions to its worth.
It is an effort to suppress free inquiry, al
though it is couched in the appealing and fair
sounding phrases of patriotism and American
ism.
If the individuals who brand free inquiry of
this type as anti-American would make a
closer examination of the meaning of American
history, they would find that Americanism in
the real sense has never stood for fear, cowar
dice or protectionism.
They would find that experimentation, cu
riosity and free will have molded American
thought far more than blind acceptance of the
existing as perfect and rejection of dissident
cries as subversive.
• I liese critics are paying no compliment to
the political maturity of students in one of
the nation's greatest universities when they
infer that "left-wing"" comments made by a
convicted perjurer may influence their
thoughts and political philosophy.
Academic curiosity is one of the students'
most cherished prerogatives. We hope it will
not he buried under a barrage of pseudo
patrolic attacks detrimental to mature think
ing.
