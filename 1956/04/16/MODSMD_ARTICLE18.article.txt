A Misunderstanding

Editor, The Daily:
A lesson may be learned from an examination
' I the recent heated exchange between The Stan
ford Daily and one of its impassioned readers.
Letter writer Brian Wiekland and the Daily
editorial writer who terms Mr. Wiekland a "hood
lum delender" take equally adamant positions on
the topic of intolerance. Both arc partially right;
racism is an evil and acts of violence in any name
arc reprehensible. Popular tastes, as Mr. Wick
land laments, in areas such as music also are
often offensive.
But the solution to any controversy, especially
in thi wide area of public opinion, lies elsewhere
than in immoderate recrimination.
Mr. Wiekland noted "the gloom of the morning
1.-in" in beginning his appeal for action against
the vocal manifestations of a deteriorating mo
rality. Another observer some three centuries
earlier saw in rainfall a gentle, softening influ
ence.
Both parties should remark on William Shake
peare's familiar description of mercy, the qual

ity that must ultimately rule disputing factions
if their controversies of whatever dimensions are
to he resolved.
"It is twice blessed," indeed.
J. Arnold
Editor's Note: There was 110 "heated exchange"
between The Daily ami letter-writer VVickland;
Ihe editorial in question was written mainly con
cerning the attack on Nat Cole, not on Mr. Wick
land's comments on that attack.
We certainly did not term Mr. YViekland a
"hoodlum defender." We used that title in desig
nation of fhe "self-styled defenders of the so
called white race." They admitted to carrying
brass knuckles, blackjacks and rifles, hence fhe
term "hoodlum defenders" |of fhe "white raee"|.
We did mention the writer's intolerance toward
popular taste —may we ask today's writer: To
whom are popular fastes offensive?
Perhaps to the self-styled arbiters of what is
good and bad, who base their decisions not ac
cording to what the majority of fhe people think
is good or bail, but according to what these "ar
biters" KNOW is good.
