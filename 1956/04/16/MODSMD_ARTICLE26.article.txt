### Joe Ramsey 
The frosh baseball nine won
their fifth victory of the season
Saturday m or n in g when they
came from behind in the eighth
inning to edge Oakland Tech
High, 7-6. Harry Rodda supplied
the necessary punch with a long
double Ihat bounced over the left
field fence to drive two team
mates across with the tying and
winning runs.
The versatile Rodda had a day
for himself. He played the early
part of the season as a shortstop
and has played center field in the
last three games. When starting
pitcher John Gillis developed back
trouble in the first inning, Rodda
came in to pitch.
With the bases filled and two
outs, Rodda successfully forced
Tech hitter Bob Braden to pop out
and end the inning. This gave re
liefer Joel Mogy time to warm up
and he came in to pitch in the
second inning.
The frosh then jumped off to a
4-0 lead which they successfully
held until, in the Tech fourth, the
visitors managed to score one un
earned run. Then, in the seventh
inning, the roof fell in on the
Papooses.
Tech Itally
With one away, reliefer Mike
Lindeman gave up a single to
Tech lead-off man Larry Cruz.
After striking out the next man,
he filled the bases by walking
Tech's Ernie Goldsby and Larry
I laskins.
A single by Hal Sampson then
scored two for the visitors and

the score stood Stanford 4, Tech 3.
The next hitter, Bob Braden.
swung late and sent a line shot to
right field, where Papoose right
fielder Phil Weigand was the vic
tim of a freak accident as he slip
ped on the wet turf.
By the time the ball was recov
ered. Braden had chased his two
teammates all the way around and
was credited with a home run.
The Papooses trailed by two.
In Stanford's half of the sev
enth, Rodda opened the inning
with a long triple over the center
fielder's head and scored on an
overthrow at home. The frosh
failed to score again that inning
and Lindeman shut Tech out in
the first half of the eighth.
Farrar Starts It
Trailing by one run in their
half of the eighth, the first frosh
batter, Dennie Farrar, shot a hard
liner right at the Tech first-base
man for one out. Stanford second
baseman Tom Schilling then
worked a walk, and Lindeman
looked like out number two as
he hit a high pop-up to the Tech
catcher.
The catcher dropped the ball
and Schilling scampered around
the bases to end up on third. The
stage was set for Rodda's game
winning double.
Lindeman retired the visitors
without any trouble in the first
half of the ninth.
