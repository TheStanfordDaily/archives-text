# Cinema Version of 'Carousel' Is Almost Complete Success
## Contains Music That Is Part of Americana, Choreography That Is Artfully Executed 
### Richard Mende 
"Carousel" is und(jubtedly one of the handsomest productions of
this season and a good many seasons past. Its cast and credits list
arc bristling with names that have deservedly earned reputations
for competence and imagination.
The music comes up to the best from the fertile collaborative ef-

forts of Richard Rodgers and Os
car Hammerstein II with tunes I
that have become a part cf Amer
icana: "June Is Bust in' Out All
Over," "You'll Never Walk Alone"
and "If I Loved You."
There is brilliant and stirring
choreographic work conceived by
Rod Alexander and Agnes De-
Mille, all artfully executed.
The singing and acting efforts
of Gordon Macßae, who plays Bil
ly Bigelow, the chronically unem
ployed carousel barker, and Shir
ley Jones, his faithful wife, come
up to the high standards that have
been set.
Gordon Macßae has one long
sequence, one of the finest parts
of the movie, when he describes
in a monologue all the things he
would like his coming child to be.
CineinaScope 55
All this is recorded in a new
photographic process labeled Cin
emaSeope 55, which is described,
In the jargon of those who study
these things, as having better def
inition, sharper locus and greater
clarity. In any case, the filming
technique has produced a three
dimensional effect and has elimi
nated distortion.
The real mar to the production
comes in the story-telling which
stumbled into a rather tearful
sentimentality. In less imposing
surroundings this rendering for
which the director is perhaps
most to blame might be labeled
a tear-jerker. But the other sub
stantial efforts keep this weak
ness from being fatal.
Broadway Success
If there is anybody who is still
unfamiliar with the adaptation of
Ferenc Molnar's fantasy "Liliom."
"Carousel" (which has had three
successful Broadway runs) is
about the love between a mill
worker and a former carousel
barker who can't bring himself to
go to work.
He allows himself to be talker!
into committing a robbery which
ends disastrously but which shows
what his wife knew all along
that, though he is thoroughly ir
responsible, he is a good enough
fellow underneath.
The movie version of "Carou
sel" has an imposing collection of
talents and comes very close to
being a complete success.

The singing and acting efforts
of Gordon Macßae, who plays Bil
ly Bigelow, the chronically unem
ployed carousel barker, and Shir
ley Jones, his faithful wife, come
up to the high standards that have
been set.
Gordon Macßae has one long
sequence, one of the finest parts
of the movie, when he describes
in a monologue all the things he
would like his coming child to be.
CineinaScope 55
All this is recorded in a new
photographic process labeled Cin
emaSeope 55, which is described,
In the jargon of those who study
these things, as having better def
inition, sharper locus and greater
clarity. In any case, the filming
technique has produced a three
dimensional effect and has elimi
nated distortion.
The real mar to the production
comes in the story-telling which
stumbled into a rather tearful
sentimentality. In less imposing
surroundings this rendering for
which the director is perhaps
most to blame might be labeled
a tear-jerker. But the other sub
stantial efforts keep this weak
ness from being fatal.
Broadway Success
If there is anybody who is still
unfamiliar with the adaptation of
Ferenc Molnar's fantasy "Liliom."
"Carousel" (which has had three
successful Broadway runs) is
about the love between a mill
worker and a former carousel
barker who can't bring himself to
go to work.
He allows himself to be talker!
into committing a robbery which
ends disastrously but which shows
what his wife knew all along
that, though he is thoroughly ir
responsible, he is a good enough
fellow underneath.
The movie version of "Carou
sel" has an imposing collection of
talents and comes very close to
being a complete success.
"Carousel" is und(jubtedly one of the handsomest productions of
this season and a good many seasons past. Its cast and credits list
arc bristling with names that have deservedly earned reputations
for competence and imagination.
The music comes up to the best from the fertile collaborative ef-

forts of Richard Rodgers and Os
car Hammerstein II with tunes I
that have become a part cf Amer
icana: "June Is Bust in' Out All
Over," "You'll Never Walk Alone"
and "If I Loved You."
There is brilliant and stirring
choreographic work conceived by
Rod Alexander and Agnes De-
Mille, all artfully executed.
