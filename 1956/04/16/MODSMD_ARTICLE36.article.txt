# KZSU Announces Changes, Additions To Program Polity
## 
### 
A minor "revolution" has struck
KZSU's program policy, according
to Chris Hauscr, publicity direc
tor.
Elements of the revolution are:
• Playing more classical music,
in response to student sugges
tions.
• Broadcasting weekdays from
4 to 11 p.m. instead of taking an
hour off for dinner, as before.
• Eliminating block program
ming, a policy by which the same
shows appeared each clay at the
same time, and increasing the va
riety of programs.
• Adding many new shows.
Highlights of the new pro
grams, according to program man
ager Jean Koeneman, are "The
Instruments," "Nights of Love
and Laughter" and "Preludes and
Prologues."
"The Instruments," to be broad
cast at 8 p.m. each Tuesday, will
feature historical sketches and re
corded illustrations of musical in
struments.
\
"Nights of Love and Laughter"
will go on the air each Thursday
night at 7 and emphasize Gilbert
and Sullivan records.
"P relu d e sand Prologues,"
scheduled for 7 p.m. each Sunday,
will preview music to be played
at coming Bay Area concerts.
