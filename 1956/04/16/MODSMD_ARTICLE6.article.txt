Although she interpreted the
limericks incorrectly. Lagunita
sophomore B a r bara Duhrkoop
successfully opened the safe plac
ed in front of the Cellar last week
and collected her two Junior Prom
tickets and a. certificate for $20.
"I'm really embarrassed." Mss
Duhrkoop said. "It was Just a co
incidence that I figured out Ihe
right combination."
Robert Iloopes, assistant pro
fessor of English, composed the
limericks containing the clues to
the combination. The "poems"
were constructed so that the num
ber of turns required for each
number was contained in the last
phrase beginning "Hut don't ig
nore . .
Spirit of *7(5
The numbers of the combina
tion were hidden in the beginning
phrases of the limericks. Thus,
the first number was 70 because
it is in Abbots Hall. Massachu
setts, where the Spirit of '70 is
housed.
The second limerick refers to
Act 11, Scene I in "Midsummer
Night's Dream" where the line
"Nine men's morris filled up with
mud" appears. The date of Stan
ford's founding grant, 188."), gives
the third number, 85.
German Line
At the end of the first limerick
is a German lino which means
"Two hearts in three-quarter
time." This gives three alternate
numbers for tho correct number
of turns preceding the first rligit.
By eliminating the numbers giv
en in the following clues, which
were three for iambic trimeter
and two for snake eyes, four be
comes the correct number of
turns for the first number of the
combination.
