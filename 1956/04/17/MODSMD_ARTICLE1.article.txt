in a new program aimed at pump
ing an extra billion dollars into
the farm economy this year.
Accusing Democrats of making
a "political football" out of the
farm issue, Eisenhower announc
ed in his veto message that the
Administration itself will raise
price supports on five basic < vops
and dairy products, as well as per
ishable farm commodities.
The Agriculture Department es
timated the Administration action
would mean an additional $."">OO
million for farmers in 19:10.
In a radio-TV speech tonight ex
plaining his veto of the politically
hot farm bill, Eisenhower called
on Congress to revive his "soil
bank" under a plan providing for
speeded-up subsidies for partici
pating farmers.
Soil Bank Plea
He said this would raise farm
income another $500 million this
year, or about $1 billion altogeth
er. Democrats had claimed the
vetoed bill would boost farm in
come about $2 billion.
Democratic Congressional lead
ers were in no mood to speed ac
tion on the President's request.

an apparently hopeless attempt to
override the veto in the House on
Wednesday. They appeared to
have no chance of mustering the
required two-thirds vote.
Eisenhower told Congress in his
veto message, sent to the House
at noon, that he vetoed Ihe catch
all farm bill because it was "con
tradictory and self-defeating" and
would "harm both farmers and
consumers."
Attempt to Override
In Congress some Midwest Re
publicans joined Democrats today
in denouncing the veto. They call
ed it a serious economic blow to
farmers and a. political mistake.
House Democratic leader John
W. McCormack (Mass.) announc
ed that an attempt to override
veto will be "the first order of
business" Wednesday. But there
was almost no chance the move
would win the required two-thirds
majority.
Speaker Sam Rayburn (Tex.)
was asked if he thought the House
would vote to override.
"I don't know,"he replied. "I
never know until the roll is called
the last time."
"Crushing Blow"
Senate Democratic leader T,yu
don B. Johnson (Tex.) called the
veto "a crushing blow to the hopes
and legitimate desiiVs of Amei i
can agriculture."
The American Farm Bureau
Federation, representing 1,622,(")()
farmers, lauded the President's
action as "based on sound eco
nomic principles."
But others condemned the veto
and predicted it will mean a Re
publican loss in the Novembei

Democratic Congressional lead

required two-thirds vote.

veto message, sent to the House
at noon, that he vetoed Ihe catch

would "harm both farmers and

Attempt to Override

farmers and a. political mistake.
House Democratic leader John

veto will be "the first order of
