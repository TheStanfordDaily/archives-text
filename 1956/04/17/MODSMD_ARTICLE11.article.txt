# Hammer & Coffin Had Shaky Beginning
## 
### 
Fifty years ago today, ten students met in
Meyers Boer Hall in Menlo Park, consumed juicy
T-bone steaks costing 25 cents apiece, quaffed
some 64 tankards of the cup that cheers and
founded the Hammer and Coffin Society.
Less than an hour after the last of these stu
dents blearily made his way to bed, California
was subjected to the worst earthquake in its
recorded history.
One of the students awoke to find the plaster
ceiling had fallen on him. In a statement still
cherished by present-day members of the society,
he said, "This is the first time I've ever gone to
sleep plastered and waked up also plastered."
Primary purpose of Hammer and Coffin is to

publish the Stanford Chaparral. Tho Golden An
niversary issue will be on sale at the usual spots
tomorrow.
Of interest to students of Voltaire will be the
Old Boy's Illustrated, Expurgated Candide.
Graduating seniors will find the photographic
essay on the work being dune by the Stanford
Placement Service of immense value.
Included in the photographic line is evidence
of the Old Boy's spring vacation at Balboa.
Allen Hayes has written an article on the his
tory and development of Hammer and Coffin.
On the practical side, there is a fascinating
how-to-do-it article. It is called "Ilow to Sell Your
Soul to the Devil."
