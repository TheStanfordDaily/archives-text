# Sen. Kefauver Expresses Regret Over Ike's Veto While in SF
## He and Ike Are Only Candidates Running In New Jersey Primary Elections Today 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (UP)—Sen. Estes Kefauver today ex
pressed "deep regret" over President Eisenhower's veto of the farm
bill, despite the fact it will provide a heavy weapon for the Demo
cratic party in the Presidential campaign.
Shortly after his arrival here this morning, Kefauver denounced

"big business domination" of the
federal government and predicted
he would he the victim of "organ
ized confusion" in the New Jer
sey primary tomorrow.
Kefauver is the only Democratic
Presidential aspirant in the New
Jersey race. President Eisenhow
er is the only Republican candi
date on the ballot.
The Democratic hopeful was
asked for a statement on the Pres
ident's veto as he hit nearby San
Rafael in a whistle-stop tour of
the Bay Area population centers.
"The distress of the farmers is
so widespread and so deep I would
have been willing to forego any
political advantage if assistance
could have been# gotten to them
promptly," he said.
Veto's Effect
The Tennessee senator admitted
the vetoed bill was "not perfect,"
but he said it represented "about
the best effort that could have
been expected this year in view
of the adamant positions taken by
Secretary (Ezra T.] Benson and
President Eisenhower."
Kefauver predicted the veto
would have the effect of shifting
the full blame (for the farm situ
ation) onto the shoulders of the
President.
"The fat mors of the nation have
almost universally been blaming
Secretary Benson for the failure
of this Administration to deal ade
quately with their problems," he
said. "By his veto, it seems cer
tain that President Eisenhower
will now take the full blame for
Hie callous attitude of his Admin
istration for the difficulties of the
farmers.
Three-Day Visit
"This, of course, is precisely
where the blame should have been
put all the time."
Kefauver. who arrived here this
morning for a three-day swing of
the Northern California area, said
he would break off his campaign
tour "whenever it is necessary to
fly back to Washington to vote to
override the veto."
