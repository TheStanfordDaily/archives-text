## AAUP Censures Fight Colleges For Firing of Communist Profs 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
I he American Association of University Pro
lessors, in it? annual meeting last week, officially
censured the I niversity of California and seven
other universities for firing professors because
of suspected Commit.list leanings.
Although tliis is a commendable action, in
I lie case of Cal il is a little belated. The pro
fessors were fired in 1949 for refusing to sign a
I niversity loyally oalh, and Cal has since been
forced bv court action to reinstate them w illi
ful! back pay.
In its censure, which may be removed if the
colleges co-operate, the AAUP said that a teach
er should not be lired for belonging to the Com
munist party unless it is shown he is unfit to
teach, but no criteria are mentioned.
* *
Cleanest story of the week comes from the
I niversity of Illinois where a student union em
ployee became fascinated by a new dish washer
one with a conveyor belt to send dishes
through 24 feet of soaping and rinsing.
If this could work for dishes, the student
asked himself, why not for humans? Being a
man of action he promptly ran a dry test on
himself.
As he sailed through the final ivash, hp teas
greeted by tlie union's supervisor. Although the
experiment teas a great success, the student paid
the price, and has now taken his great discovery
elsewhere.
