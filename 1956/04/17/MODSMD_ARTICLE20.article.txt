Editor, 'l'he Daily:
In defense or ,he Classes of *40, '41 '42, '43 and
IT, 1 should like to comet an impression con
veyed by an editorial in last Wednesday's Daily.
Those classes, like '55 and '56, chose a more mean
ingful gift than drinking fountains—they estab
lished the Senior Class Scholarship.
An endowment wa* initiated by the Class of '40
under Class President Bob Livingston, and given
If) the University for investment in order to pro
duce perpetual income for scholarships. Four
: in i'ceding senior classes followed '40's lead by
adding to the endowment, which now amounts to
$"7,600, and which supports a scholarship of ap
proximately $3°o per year.
The scholarship has been in constant use for
1 1 years, and it will continue to be awarded as
long as there is need for scholarships at Stanford.
1 he classes of '24, 25, '26, '33 and '35 also made
gifts to the University for scholarships.
To classes and student groups such as the
ASSU, residence clubs, Women's Recreation As
sociation, Cap and Gown, and others who have
contributed toward scholarships, I want to say
thank you, on behalf of the Committee on Finan
cial Awards, for their thoughtful and generous
gifts.

Editor, The Daily:
The foot-dragging penny-wise pound-foolish at
iitude of the University Administration toward

parking problems is a source of continual amaze
ment to me.
The University is well known for the excellence
of its planning as demonstrated in the Shopping
Center and Industrial Park developments. The
general public is impressed and even, to some
extent, appreciative.
Yet. the University's planning with respect to
parking, a problem which affects almost every
member of Ihe faculty, staff and student body, is
intolerably poor.
Even the simplest and cheapest steps toward
making full use of parking facilities presently
available seem to be ignored.
Can there be any possible excuse for the waste
ful hodge-podge parking one sees every day in
the triangle parking lot (between Stern and En
gineering Corner) except that the University Ad
ministration is too disinterested to spend the few
dollars necessary to mark out proper parking
places and to have a policeman visit the lot oc
casionally to enforce the basic rudiments of prop
er parking procedures?
An enlightened and progressive approach to
parking problems would be more in character to
the otherwise excellent University Administration
than the present approach.
Such an approach has been repeatedly urged
by the student body through their representa
tives. Such an approach would impress and be
appreciated by all Stanford people. Why can't
we have it?
An enlightened approach, in itself, isn't ex
pensive.

The scholarship has been in constant use for
1 1 years, and it will continue to be awarded as
long as there is need for scholarships at Stanford.
1 he classes of '24, 25, '26, '33 and '35 also made
gifts to the University for scholarships.
To classes and student groups such as the
ASSU, residence clubs, Women's Recreation As
sociation, Cap and Gown, and others who have
contributed toward scholarships, I want to say
thank you, on behalf of the Committee on Finan
cial Awards, for their thoughtful and generous
gifts.

The foot-dragging penny-wise pound-foolish at
iitude of the University Administration toward

parking problems is a source of continual amaze
ment to me.
The University is well known for the excellence
of its planning as demonstrated in the Shopping
Center and Industrial Park developments. The
general public is impressed and even, to some
extent, appreciative.
Yet. the University's planning with respect to
parking, a problem which affects almost every
member of Ihe faculty, staff and student body, is
intolerably poor.
Even the simplest and cheapest steps toward
making full use of parking facilities presently
available seem to be ignored.
Can there be any possible excuse for the waste
ful hodge-podge parking one sees every day in
the triangle parking lot (between Stern and En
gineering Corner) except that the University Ad
ministration is too disinterested to spend the few
dollars necessary to mark out proper parking
places and to have a policeman visit the lot oc
casionally to enforce the basic rudiments of prop
er parking procedures?
An enlightened and progressive approach to
parking problems would be more in character to
the otherwise excellent University Administration
than the present approach.
Such an approach has been repeatedly urged
by the student body through their representa
tives. Such an approach would impress and be
appreciated by all Stanford people. Why can't
we have it?
An enlightened approach, in itself, isn't ex
pensive.

In defense or ,he Classes of *40, '41 '42, '43 and
IT, 1 should like to comet an impression con
veyed by an editorial in last Wednesday's Daily.
Those classes, like '55 and '56, chose a more mean
ingful gift than drinking fountains—they estab
lished the Senior Class Scholarship.
An endowment wa* initiated by the Class of '40
under Class President Bob Livingston, and given
If) the University for investment in order to pro
duce perpetual income for scholarships. Four
: in i'ceding senior classes followed '40's lead by
adding to the endowment, which now amounts to
$"7,600, and which supports a scholarship of ap
proximately $3°o per year.
The scholarship has been in constant use for
1 1 years, and it will continue to be awarded as
long as there is need for scholarships at Stanford.
