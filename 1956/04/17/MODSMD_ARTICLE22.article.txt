League of Nations pioneer, Pres
ident Woodrow Wilson, wo u 1 d
have passed away with less bitter
ness in his heart had he ever seen
Model United Nations in action.
This body, meeting annually
and consisting of aspiring young
"parliamentarians" from m or e
than 60 colleges of the Great Pa
cific West, has done more to pro
mote the ideals of UN among its
ardent participants than innumer
able lectures on international re
lations.
The four days of conferences,
caucuses and General Assembly
meetings, in a setting that differs
little from Lake Success, give not
only a practical understanding of
the problems faced by UN, but an
excellent school of parliamentary
procedure, lobbyism and political
strategy as well.
Personal UN
The success was to a large ex
tent due to George Papadopoulo,
Secretary General, who is actual
ly a personal miniature UN. Born
on Cyprus, baptized with a Greek
name, raised in Egypt, studying
in the U. S. on a United Kingdom
passport — such is his amazing
background.
To qualify for his administra
tive duties, he spent a month at
Lake Success last year to pick up
valuable hints from the profes
sionals. Then he went home to
Oregon and,organized the finest
Model UN to date.
A veteran in the field of inter
national relations, ex - governor
Charles A. Sprague, presided over
General Assembly meetings with
dignified authority. Nothing could
bring him out of order. When the
shooting started at the Gaza strip,
the Arab bloc decided to play a
dirty trick on Israel.
, Meditation
At noon the next day they called
for a two-minute meditation in all
committees to honor the Arabs
"murdered" by Israel attacks. De
spite vehement protests from Is
rael, there was a one-minute med
itation in most committees that
day. In the General Assembly
President Sprague overruled the
motion with the following words:
"There is already set aside one
minute of meditation before the
General Assembly dissolves to
night. I suggest "that the distin
guished delegates of Egypt com
press all their prayer and medita
tion into this one minute."
Another humorous incident that

i took place during the sessions of
the General Assembly occurred
i ihe last day of the conference.
I United Kingdom de live-red a
speech with much ardor and re
tused to leave the microphone
when its time was up.
Two strong guards physically
i removed the tiny delegate from
j the speaker's chair on President
| Spi ague's request. A worse dis
| honor has seldom befallen the
British lion, and United Kingdom
demonstrated its fury by walking
out of the General Assembly.
The Memorial Union, a big brick
! building on the Oregon State
i quad, was the nerve-center of the
Model UN. Here was the guide
I service, press room and delegates'
lounge, all within easy reach. In
I the General Assembly Hall (cor
ridor of Memorial Union) flags of
all member nations were hanging
I along the walls.
Few Triumphs
There were few triumphs for
I the delegation from Stanford (or
j Israel) during the four days of
debate. Israel was thrown out: of
the Afro-Asian bloc with Arab ac
clamation.
Typical example of Arab tactics
displayed itself in the Economic
and Finance Committee, where
Israel forwarded a resolution ask
ing for a Middle East Trade Com
i mission. Egypt (Reed College) de
livered a soap-box performance of
hysterical emotionalism, never
touching the topic of discussion at
all. To obstruct matters further,
Iraq asked the president to check
credentials for Israeli members of
the committee. This was a ridicu
lous move and unworthy of the
relative high standing of parlia
mentarianism of the committee.
Finally, Israel was voted down
with 30 nations abstaining. Nor
way was the only country voling
j for the Israeli resolution. Nor
-1 way's position in this case was
dubious, but the representative
j was a compatriot of this writer
! and thus loyal.
Long Struggle
In the Ad Hoc Peace and Ob
servation Committee a similar in
cident. took place. Alain Coriat,
ASSU scholar from Algiers, and
Tom Lanyi, Wilbur freshman,
struggled a whole day with Iraq
<U. of Arizona), who opposed an
Israeli resolution asking for cen

sure of the Egyptian government i
on the blockade of the Suez Canal.
Israel lost here, too, but by a nar-1
row margin, and the delegation
was able to parry a dangerous
resolution forwarded by the
Arabs.
The Trusteeship Committee was
the only place beside the Interna
tional Court of Justice where Is
rael was really successful. A reso
lution introduced by Karen Cris-1
con, Lagunita sophomore, request-!
Ed the establishment of a subcom- j
mittee to examine petitions of i
non-self-goyerning and trust terri
tories. The Arab bloc graciously
rose en masse and abstained dur
ing the voting. But the resolution !
was passed.
Many Arabs
People have asked me: What is
the idea ol Model UN? Why both
er playing with issues we have so
little knowledge about?
Emanuel Feuchtwang, an Israe
li engineering student who has
been an indispensable adviser of
our delegation during all winter
quarter, told me that he had been
in the war between Israel and the
Arab countries, but not till now
did he realize fhe mentality of
these people.
There were quite a few Arabs
at Model UN, and also the Ameri
can Arab delegates acted their
parts well. So if Emanuel, with
his experience behind him, could
learn something about the prob
lems of his own country from an
amateurish meet of college stu
, dents in the Pacific West, we
j could learn everything. And we
! did.
Complexity of World
r'or a few days we saw in a
glimpse the complexity of the
world. We were no longer mute
witnesses to nationalism and colo
nialism—traditions, passions, em
otions—the whole drama of our
century.
We were in it. We made the
headlines. We made the speeches.
We tried to find the remedies. Our
i identity was erased; we were no
longer the good - natured college
kids in an academic Ivory Tower.
We represented oirr country and
all it stood for. And, however im
perfect and childish this show
I may seem at times, it taught us a
practical lesson of international
i relations.

little knowledge about?
Emanuel Feuchtwang, an Israe
li engineering student who has
been an indispensable adviser of
our delegation during all winter
quarter, told me that he had been
in the war between Israel and the
Arab countries, but not till now
did he realize fhe mentality of
these people.
There were quite a few Arabs
at Model UN, and also the Ameri
can Arab delegates acted their
parts well. So if Emanuel, with
his experience behind him, could
learn something about the prob
lems of his own country from an
amateurish meet of college stu
, dents in the Pacific West, we
j could learn everything. And we
! did.
Complexity of World
r'or a few days we saw in a
glimpse the complexity of the
world. We were no longer mute
witnesses to nationalism and colo
nialism—traditions, passions, em
otions—the whole drama of our
century.
We were in it. We made the
headlines. We made the speeches.
We tried to find the remedies. Our
i identity was erased; we were no
longer the good - natured college
kids in an academic Ivory Tower.
We represented oirr country and
all it stood for. And, however im
perfect and childish this show
I may seem at times, it taught us a
practical lesson of international
i relations.

ness in his heart had he ever seen

This body, meeting annually
and consisting of aspiring young
"parliamentarians" from m or e
than 60 colleges of the Great Pa
cific West, has done more to pro
mote the ideals of UN among its
ardent participants than innumer
able lectures on international re
lations.
The four days of conferences,
caucuses and General Assembly
meetings, in a setting that differs
little from Lake Success, give not
only a practical understanding of
the problems faced by UN, but an
excellent school of parliamentary
procedure, lobbyism and political
strategy as well.
Personal UN
The success was to a large ex
tent due to George Papadopoulo,
Secretary General, who is actual
ly a personal miniature UN. Born
on Cyprus, baptized with a Greek
name, raised in Egypt, studying
in the U. S. on a United Kingdom
passport — such is his amazing
background.
To qualify for his administra
tive duties, he spent a month at
Lake Success last year to pick up
valuable hints from the profes
sionals. Then he went home to
Oregon and,organized the finest
Model UN to date.
A veteran in the field of inter
national relations, ex - governor
Charles A. Sprague, presided over
General Assembly meetings with
dignified authority. Nothing could
bring him out of order. When the
shooting started at the Gaza strip,
the Arab bloc decided to play a
dirty trick on Israel.
, Meditation
At noon the next day they called
for a two-minute meditation in all
committees to honor the Arabs
"murdered" by Israel attacks. De
spite vehement protests from Is
rael, there was a one-minute med
itation in most committees that
day. In the General Assembly
President Sprague overruled the
motion with the following words:
"There is already set aside one
minute of meditation before the
General Assembly dissolves to
night. I suggest "that the distin
guished delegates of Egypt com
press all their prayer and medita
tion into this one minute."
Another humorous incident that

i took place during the sessions of
the General Assembly occurred
i ihe last day of the conference.
I United Kingdom de live-red a
speech with much ardor and re
tused to leave the microphone
when its time was up.
Two strong guards physically
i removed the tiny delegate from
j the speaker's chair on President
| Spi ague's request. A worse dis
| honor has seldom befallen the
British lion, and United Kingdom
demonstrated its fury by walking
out of the General Assembly.
The Memorial Union, a big brick
! building on the Oregon State
i quad, was the nerve-center of the
Model UN. Here was the guide
I service, press room and delegates'
lounge, all within easy reach. In
I the General Assembly Hall (cor
ridor of Memorial Union) flags of
all member nations were hanging
I along the walls.
Few Triumphs
There were few triumphs for
I the delegation from Stanford (or
j Israel) during the four days of
debate. Israel was thrown out: of
the Afro-Asian bloc with Arab ac
clamation.
Typical example of Arab tactics
displayed itself in the Economic
and Finance Committee, where
Israel forwarded a resolution ask
ing for a Middle East Trade Com
i mission. Egypt (Reed College) de
livered a soap-box performance of
hysterical emotionalism, never
touching the topic of discussion at
all. To obstruct matters further,
Iraq asked the president to check
credentials for Israeli members of
the committee. This was a ridicu
lous move and unworthy of the
relative high standing of parlia
mentarianism of the committee.
Finally, Israel was voted down
with 30 nations abstaining. Nor
way was the only country voling
j for the Israeli resolution. Nor
-1 way's position in this case was
dubious, but the representative
j was a compatriot of this writer
! and thus loyal.
Long Struggle
In the Ad Hoc Peace and Ob
servation Committee a similar in
cident. took place. Alain Coriat,
ASSU scholar from Algiers, and
Tom Lanyi, Wilbur freshman,
struggled a whole day with Iraq
<U. of Arizona), who opposed an
Israeli resolution asking for cen

sure of the Egyptian government i
on the blockade of the Suez Canal.
Israel lost here, too, but by a nar-1
row margin, and the delegation
was able to parry a dangerous
resolution forwarded by the
Arabs.
The Trusteeship Committee was
the only place beside the Interna
tional Court of Justice where Is
rael was really successful. A reso
lution introduced by Karen Cris-1
con, Lagunita sophomore, request-!
Ed the establishment of a subcom- j
mittee to examine petitions of i
non-self-goyerning and trust terri
tories. The Arab bloc graciously
rose en masse and abstained dur
ing the voting. But the resolution !
was passed.

struggled a whole day with Iraq
<U. of Arizona), who opposed an
Israeli resolution asking for cen

sure of the Egyptian government i
on the blockade of the Suez Canal.
Israel lost here, too, but by a nar-1
row margin, and the delegation
was able to parry a dangerous

Many Arabs
People have asked me: What is
the idea ol Model UN? Why both
er playing with issues we have so
little knowledge about?
Emanuel Feuchtwang, an Israe
li engineering student who has
been an indispensable adviser of
our delegation during all winter
quarter, told me that he had been
in the war between Israel and the
Arab countries, but not till now
did he realize fhe mentality of
these people.
There were quite a few Arabs
at Model UN, and also the Ameri
can Arab delegates acted their
parts well. So if Emanuel, with
his experience behind him, could
learn something about the prob
lems of his own country from an
amateurish meet of college stu

j could learn everything. And we
! did.
Complexity of World
r'or a few days we saw in a
glimpse the complexity of the
world. We were no longer mute
witnesses to nationalism and colo
nialism—traditions, passions, em
otions—the whole drama of our
century.
We were in it. We made the
headlines. We made the speeches.
We tried to find the remedies. Our
i identity was erased; we were no
longer the good - natured college
kids in an academic Ivory Tower.
We represented oirr country and
all it stood for. And, however im
perfect and childish this show
I may seem at times, it taught us a
practical lesson of international
i relations.

This body, meeting annually
and consisting of aspiring young

mote the ideals of UN among its
ardent participants than innumer
able lectures on international re

The four days of conferences,

meetings, in a setting that differs
little from Lake Success, give not

excellent school of parliamentary
procedure, lobbyism and political
strategy as well.
Personal UN
The success was to a large ex
tent due to George Papadopoulo,
Secretary General, who is actual
ly a personal miniature UN. Born
on Cyprus, baptized with a Greek
name, raised in Egypt, studying
in the U. S. on a United Kingdom
passport — such is his amazing
background.
To qualify for his administra
tive duties, he spent a month at
Lake Success last year to pick up
valuable hints from the profes
sionals. Then he went home to
Oregon and,organized the finest
Model UN to date.
A veteran in the field of inter
national relations, ex - governor
Charles A. Sprague, presided over
General Assembly meetings with
dignified authority. Nothing could
bring him out of order. When the
shooting started at the Gaza strip,
the Arab bloc decided to play a
dirty trick on Israel.
, Meditation
At noon the next day they called
for a two-minute meditation in all
committees to honor the Arabs
"murdered" by Israel attacks. De
spite vehement protests from Is
rael, there was a one-minute med
itation in most committees that
day. In the General Assembly
President Sprague overruled the
motion with the following words:
"There is already set aside one
minute of meditation before the
General Assembly dissolves to
night. I suggest "that the distin
guished delegates of Egypt com
press all their prayer and medita
tion into this one minute."
Another humorous incident that

i took place during the sessions of
the General Assembly occurred
i ihe last day of the conference.
I United Kingdom de live-red a
speech with much ardor and re
tused to leave the microphone
when its time was up.
Two strong guards physically
i removed the tiny delegate from
j the speaker's chair on President
| Spi ague's request. A worse dis
| honor has seldom befallen the
British lion, and United Kingdom
demonstrated its fury by walking
out of the General Assembly.
The Memorial Union, a big brick
! building on the Oregon State
i quad, was the nerve-center of the
Model UN. Here was the guide
I service, press room and delegates'
lounge, all within easy reach. In
I the General Assembly Hall (cor
ridor of Memorial Union) flags of
all member nations were hanging
I along the walls.
Few Triumphs
There were few triumphs for
I the delegation from Stanford (or
j Israel) during the four days of
debate. Israel was thrown out: of
the Afro-Asian bloc with Arab ac
clamation.
Typical example of Arab tactics
displayed itself in the Economic
and Finance Committee, where
Israel forwarded a resolution ask
ing for a Middle East Trade Com
i mission. Egypt (Reed College) de
livered a soap-box performance of
hysterical emotionalism, never
touching the topic of discussion at
all. To obstruct matters further,
Iraq asked the president to check
credentials for Israeli members of
the committee. This was a ridicu
lous move and unworthy of the
relative high standing of parlia
mentarianism of the committee.

British lion, and United Kingdom
demonstrated its fury by walking
out of the General Assembly.
The Memorial Union, a big brick
! building on the Oregon State
i quad, was the nerve-center of the
Model UN. Here was the guide
I service, press room and delegates'
lounge, all within easy reach. In
I the General Assembly Hall (cor
ridor of Memorial Union) flags of
all member nations were hanging
I along the walls.
Few Triumphs
There were few triumphs for
I the delegation from Stanford (or
j Israel) during the four days of
debate. Israel was thrown out: of
the Afro-Asian bloc with Arab ac
clamation.
Typical example of Arab tactics
displayed itself in the Economic
and Finance Committee, where
Israel forwarded a resolution ask
ing for a Middle East Trade Com
i mission. Egypt (Reed College) de
livered a soap-box performance of
hysterical emotionalism, never
touching the topic of discussion at
all. To obstruct matters further,
Iraq asked the president to check
credentials for Israeli members of
the committee. This was a ridicu
lous move and unworthy of the
relative high standing of parlia
mentarianism of the committee.
Finally, Israel was voted down
with 30 nations abstaining. Nor
way was the only country voling
j for the Israeli resolution. Nor
-1 way's position in this case was
dubious, but the representative
j was a compatriot of this writer
! and thus loyal.
Long Struggle
In the Ad Hoc Peace and Ob
servation Committee a similar in
cident. took place. Alain Coriat,
ASSU scholar from Algiers, and
Tom Lanyi, Wilbur freshman,
struggled a whole day with Iraq
<U. of Arizona), who opposed an
Israeli resolution asking for cen

sure of the Egyptian government i
on the blockade of the Suez Canal.
Israel lost here, too, but by a nar-1
row margin, and the delegation
was able to parry a dangerous
resolution forwarded by the
Arabs.
The Trusteeship Committee was
the only place beside the Interna
tional Court of Justice where Is
rael was really successful. A reso
lution introduced by Karen Cris-1
con, Lagunita sophomore, request-!
Ed the establishment of a subcom- j
mittee to examine petitions of i
non-self-goyerning and trust terri
tories. The Arab bloc graciously
rose en masse and abstained dur
ing the voting. But the resolution !
was passed.
Many Arabs
People have asked me: What is
the idea ol Model UN? Why both
er playing with issues we have so
little knowledge about?
Emanuel Feuchtwang, an Israe
li engineering student who has
been an indispensable adviser of
our delegation during all winter
quarter, told me that he had been
in the war between Israel and the
Arab countries, but not till now
did he realize fhe mentality of
these people.
There were quite a few Arabs
at Model UN, and also the Ameri
can Arab delegates acted their
parts well. So if Emanuel, with
his experience behind him, could
learn something about the prob
lems of his own country from an
amateurish meet of college stu
, dents in the Pacific West, we
j could learn everything. And we
! did.
Complexity of World
r'or a few days we saw in a
glimpse the complexity of the
world. We were no longer mute
witnesses to nationalism and colo
nialism—traditions, passions, em
otions—the whole drama of our
century.
We were in it. We made the
headlines. We made the speeches.
We tried to find the remedies. Our
i identity was erased; we were no
longer the good - natured college
kids in an academic Ivory Tower.
We represented oirr country and
all it stood for. And, however im
perfect and childish this show
I may seem at times, it taught us a
practical lesson of international
i relations.
