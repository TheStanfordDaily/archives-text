### Jim Price 
A ninth-inning squeeze play at

halt yesterday as the Vallejo Jun
ior College Redskins scraped past

play, the Braves started to work

with him, Spurgeon galloped into
second on the pitcher's wild throw.
Dwight raced to third.
It seemed that the Braves were
a cinch to tie it up, but fate step
ped in in the form of a double
play. After Doug Camilli had flied

plate in an attempt to squeeze
across Dwight. Both runners were
off with the pitch and, when it
was in the dirt, were both caught
off base.
Wild throws played an impor
tant part in each of the Braves'
two-run rallies. Wayne West was
safe on an error and went to third
on a bad pickoff try. George
Avery, Bob Flanders and Bob
Dwight all got walks which, when
combined with fielder's choices by
Ron Jones and A 1 Spurgeon, push
ed across the runs.
Phil Castellucci's pinch-hit base
