# Traffic Plans To Be Topic Of Meeting
## University, Student Officials to Confer On Proposals Today 
### 
Stanford's traffic problem will
be aired by University and stu
dent officials today in the busi
ness conference room in Encina
at 1 p.m.
Student Traffic Committee
Chairman Bob Maddock will pre
sent his committee's plan to Uni
versity Business Manager Alf E.
Brandin at the meeting.
At a previous conference the
two plans were found to be attack
ing I lie problem in two entirely
different ways. The students' plan
would open all roads, while the
University favors closing all roads
and utilizing the peripheral road.
"We wo u 1 d clear all main
streets of parking," Maddock said,
"and increase parking space avail
able at various lots by 1000 new
spaces."
University officials plan to close
off Galvez Street below Escon
dido, Arguello at Pine Avenue,
Lasuen from the Post Office to
Arguello, and Serra and Lomita
streets at points not yet deter
mined.
Arguello would be connected to
the peripheral road system next
summer when Russell House is
torn down and the road built in
front of Moore Hall, back of Lake
Lagunita.
Their aim is to eliminate traffic
hazards, noise and congestion in
the immediate campus area, di
vert ing it to the peripheral sys
tem. It would also decrease un
necessary student driving.
Maddock told Legislature last
month he thought the two-lane
for handling the peak traffic that
peripheral road was "unrealistic"
might be expected.
"It Would cause congestion and
unnecessary confusion," he said,
"because of left-turn needs, heav
ier traffic .concentration and diffi
culty involved in getting where
you want to go."
Assistant to the President Ken
neth M. Cuthbertson and Assist
