# Foreign Students Discuss Views of U.S. World Role
## Three Continents Participate in Cosmo Club Panel; Dean Carl Spaeth Represents U.S. 
### 
Representatives of three continents expressed varied opinions on
"An American's Responsibility Toward World Peace" last night in
Cubberley at Cosmo Club's first annua} peace discussion.
Moderator Fred Leckie, of Scotland, set the mood for the discus
sion by saying the topic was choscn since the United States is leader

of the Western world.
First on the panel was Dr. Kan
ti Vyas, from India. He feels that
first of all an adequate informa
tion service should be set up so
that Americans as a whole will
know what happens outside of the
States.
Dr. Vyas said Americans should
allow freedom of thought on the
international scale just as they do
in their own homes. He was re
ferring to the fact that Ameri
cans, as he put it, expect everyone
to want: American - style "democ
racy.
Attracted to Communism
He said poor people fire attract
ed to Communism. Wars increase
poverty and th us Communism.
Because of this the United States
should work by peaceful methods
instead of force to combat Com
munism. he feels.
Udo Nkamare, representing Af
rica. saifl world peace would bo
much better promoted if colored
j Americans abroad could speak of
i America as he heard one woman
speak of Stanford.
His main point was that friend
ly relations between all races at
home make for friends abroad.
Jurgcn Schrader of Germany,
giving a European opinion, said
the UN should eventually be
strengthened to be a real world
government. Americans, he said,
should support "broad • mii.ided"
Congressmen who will grant more
foreign aid.
Will -loin World
Eventually, he said, the Com-
I munists will realize' they can't
dominate the world and will join
the worlfl government.
Hark Paik from Korea empha
sized the importance of the indi
vidual and how much good or bad
influence one person can have.
For example, he said, a Japan
ese consul was refused service in
a Los Angeles barber shop. "As
he closed the shop door he also
closed the floor on American de
mocracy" He became a Commu
nist. Paik said.
Dean Carl Spaeth of the Law
School answered with the Ameri
can viewpoint. He feels that each
person in each country is respon
sible for maintaining world peace-;
that the responsibility is every
one's, not just America's.

"An American's Responsibility Toward World Peace" last night in
