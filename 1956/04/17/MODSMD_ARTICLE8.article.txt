# Alabama Tornadoes liaise Two-Week Death Toll to 69
## Winds Claim Twenty-three In Alabama 1100 Left Homeless As More Than 300 Homes Are Smashed 
### 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., April 16
(UP)â€”Sixty-nine persons have
died over the past two weeks in a
series of tornadoes beginning in
the Midwest.
The death toll climbed to 23 to
day in this area while rescuers
continued to search more than 300
smashed homes in five towns for
other possible victims.
More than 100 were injured and
1100 left homeless. Several still
lay in critical condition at Fair
field, an industrial center just
west of Birmingham where vic
tims were taken from the outly
ing storm belt.
Although the weather bureau
still had no direct confirmation
that the giant windstorm which
flattened the area late yesterday
was a tornado, the havoc could
only have been created by a fully
developed twister, disaster work
ers agreed.
Two weeks ago a series of tor
nadoes cut across the midwest
with a total death toll of 46 bul
the worst single storm toll then
was 17 at Grand Rapids, Mich.
The Alabama storm, which con
tinued east with 50 to 70 mile
winds across parts of Tennessee,
Georgia, and South Carolina, ap
parently dissipated itself at sea.
But a cold front moved north
from its path bringing predictions
of rain and even snow in the east
for tomorrow's major league base
ball openers.
The Red Cross reported the
winds demolished 166 homes in
the five-community arda, badly
damaged 162 others and left 1113
persons homeless.
The Alabama National Guard
moved in to block looting while
Salvation Army, Red Cross and
Civil Defense crews aided the
homeless in moving what little
they had left from the storm.
