# Earthquake Has Golden Anniversary
## $2 Million Damage, Two Die on Campus In 1906 Temblor 
### Rich Brown 
Another bright spring morning
began to dawn on the campus of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity exactly half a century ago—
Wednesday, April 18, 1906.
But before tho hands of the
clock on Memorial Church tower
could fully read 5:13, the tower
itself sank into the Church. From
Memorial Arch stones began fly
ing like water spurting from a
fountain.
in 47 seconds the greatest earth
quake man has ever known in
California killed two at Stanford
and did $2 million damage to the
campus, with destruction ranging
from cracked plaster to totally
devastated buildings.
Loss of life undoubtedly would
have been much higher had the
quake struck later in the day.
Buildings Tossed
At Stanford the awakenfed resi
dents either jumped or were boun
ced unwillingly out of bed as the
buildings were tossed like ships
on an angry sea.
Everyone's immediate destina
tion was outside, as a terrific din
caused by falling stones and tim
bers resounded over the campus.
They were greeted by a swirling
cloud of dust arising from and
even concealing the Quad.
From Engineering Building
masses of steam rose like a vol
cano, and from the Church and
the Arch a fine bluish dust mixed
with steam from broken lines to
present an eerie effect.
At Encina Hall the two heavy
chimneys collapsed and ripped
through all the floors to the base
ment, carrying down four men
among the bricks and splinters.
Sophomore Killed
One of the four, sophomore Jun
ius R. Hanna, was later pulled
from the wreckage dead. Two es
caped practically uninjured, while
another was hurt, but not too seri
ously.
The only other death at Stan
lord occurred when electrician
Otto Gerdes ran back into the
powerhouse to shut off the elec
tricity, thus averting a fire. As he
came back out he was buried in
■tons of rubble from the tall brick
chimney, which had snapped like
the lash of a whip.
A woman in old Roble Hall had
gone to sleep on the fourth floor
and woke up in the parlor, as the
toppling chimneys opened holes
in the floor. Miraculously she es
caped injury.
J library Destroyed
The new Library, almost com
pleted on I.asuen Street opposite
the Chemistry Building, was dam
aged beyond repair. The high
dome had gaily swayed'back and
forth, knocking down the brick
and mortar wings.
Strangely, the dome stayed in
tact, resembling a giant bird cage.
Even the glass windows remained,
brightly reflecting the morning
sunlight.
The new brick wings at the Mu
seum went down, never to be re
placed, and many priceless display
items were splintered beyond rec
ognition. The main Museum struc
ture of reinforced concrete with
stood the quake with only super
ficial damage.
Quad Hoped Of 112
Dangerous areas of the Quad
and other buildings were roped
off by 7 a.m., and guards kept the
curious from unsafe areas. Souve
nir hunters were also discouraged.
By this time the crowd num
bered several thousand, as every
one for miles around had ridden
jor walked to see the disrupted
! campus. .
! Although the crowd fed* the
| most part was solemn and quiet,
I there were bursts of laughter as
they saw the statue of Agassi/,
plunged head-first into the con
crete.
He had "dived" from his perch
on Zoology Building (now Jordan
Hall) and he evoked such com
ments as "He always was a man
of great penetration" and "Mr.
Agassi/, was good in the abstract
but not in the concrete."
One student even shook hands
with him.
Chi Psi Rocked
Wooden residences rode out the
quake remarkably well. Fallen
chimneys and plaster were the
main damage, although the Chi
j Psi house was knocked 10 feet off
its foundations.
Back at Encina, 300 men joined
| in the rescue of buried students.
I Ropes and ladders were brought
from the firehouse, the jammed
door was broken down with a
heavy pole, and the rescue gang
I formed a long line, passing rubble
out as they uncovered the victims.
About seven, in all, received in
juries which required medical at
tention. Most injuries were caused
I when students leaped out of upper
I floor windows.
One Encina man. at the first
| rumbling of the quake, leaped out
| of his fourth-floor window, jump
led up instead of down, caught the
eaves and hung there until he was
snatched back in by astonished
' friends.

Another Enci na man sat
; through Hie quake, but when a
water lank burst and flooded his
room he yelled, "Tidal wave!" and
ran. A Roble woman had the ex
perience of grabbing a door knob
and then feeling the floor sink out
from under her.
The day wore on, and the cam
-1 pus became a camping ground as
I bedding was brought out and
! some tents were pitched. Since
i more quakes were predicted, no
| one felt safe to sleep indoors for
; several flays.
President David Starr Jordan
| had predicted that another hard
quake would come about 11 that
1 morning. A Chinese cook remark
! ed. "Why he no telly us about the
! first one?"
Next day the campus paper an
; nounced work suspended for the
| semester (Stanford was on a se
mester system until 1917). Stu
! dents would be rated on class
standing. Thus, those with ade-
{ quale grades would receive full
! credit, while the others would
have to take special exams at a
later date.
Teddy ( allies
United Stales President Theo
dore Roosevelt cabled a message,
run jn Friday's Daily, in which he
expressed hope the damage to
Stanford was not as severe as re
ports indicated.
The New York Times ran two
I main headlines on the 19th; one
! was about San Francisco, while
i the other read: "Ruins Where
Stanford Stood." The London
j Times received a report that all
' buildings but one were wrecked.

The campers at Stanford—and
everyone was a camper for sev
eral days—were fairly happy. In
the evenings they sang to the ac
companiment of mandolins ~- as
the glow of burning San Francisco
loomed in the sky.
By Wednesday evening both
Palo Alto and Stanford, stricken
as they were, went to the aid of
the city. Supplies were collected
at the Palo Alto Congregational
Church. Stanford students and
volunteered their serv
ices in passing out food in San
Francisco.
Back on Its Feet ***
The University immediately set
about climbing back on its feet.
On Aug. 23 it lived up to its sched
ule and reopened. And on Sept. 15
the members of the Class of 1906
received their diplomas at a slight
ly belated graduation ceremony-
Despite repair costs, the Board
of Trustees did not establish a
tuition charge, although there was
a slight registration fee. Tuition
came later for different reasons.

masses of steam rose like a vol
cano, and from the Church and
the Arch a fine bluish dust mixed
with steam from broken lines to
present an eerie effect.
At Encina Hall the two heavy
chimneys collapsed and ripped
through all the floors to the base
ment, carrying down four men
among the bricks and splinters.
Sophomore Killed
One of the four, sophomore Jun
ius R. Hanna, was later pulled
from the wreckage dead. Two es
caped practically uninjured, while
another was hurt, but not too seri
ously.
The only other death at Stan
lord occurred when electrician
Otto Gerdes ran back into the
powerhouse to shut off the elec
tricity, thus averting a fire. As he
came back out he was buried in
■tons of rubble from the tall brick
chimney, which had snapped like
the lash of a whip.
A woman in old Roble Hall had
gone to sleep on the fourth floor
and woke up in the parlor, as the
toppling chimneys opened holes
in the floor. Miraculously she es
caped injury.
J library Destroyed
The new Library, almost com
pleted on I.asuen Street opposite
the Chemistry Building, was dam
aged beyond repair. The high
dome had gaily swayed'back and
forth, knocking down the brick
and mortar wings.
Strangely, the dome stayed in
tact, resembling a giant bird cage.
Even the glass windows remained,
brightly reflecting the morning
sunlight.
The new brick wings at the Mu
seum went down, never to be re
placed, and many priceless display
items were splintered beyond rec
ognition. The main Museum struc
ture of reinforced concrete with
stood the quake with only super
ficial damage.
Quad Hoped Of 112
Dangerous areas of the Quad
and other buildings were roped
off by 7 a.m., and guards kept the
curious from unsafe areas. Souve
nir hunters were also discouraged.
By this time the crowd num
bered several thousand, as every
one for miles around had ridden
jor walked to see the disrupted
! campus. .
! Although the crowd fed* the
| most part was solemn and quiet,
I there were bursts of laughter as
they saw the statue of Agassi/,
plunged head-first into the con
crete.
He had "dived" from his perch
on Zoology Building (now Jordan
Hall) and he evoked such com
ments as "He always was a man
of great penetration" and "Mr.
Agassi/, was good in the abstract
but not in the concrete."
One student even shook hands
with him.
Chi Psi Rocked
Wooden residences rode out the
quake remarkably well. Fallen
chimneys and plaster were the
main damage, although the Chi
j Psi house was knocked 10 feet off
its foundations.
Back at Encina, 300 men joined
| in the rescue of buried students.
I Ropes and ladders were brought
from the firehouse, the jammed
door was broken down with a
heavy pole, and the rescue gang
I formed a long line, passing rubble
out as they uncovered the victims.
About seven, in all, received in
juries which required medical at
tention. Most injuries were caused
I when students leaped out of upper
I floor windows.
One Encina man. at the first
| rumbling of the quake, leaped out
| of his fourth-floor window, jump
led up instead of down, caught the
eaves and hung there until he was
snatched back in by astonished
' friends.

Another Enci na man sat
; through Hie quake, but when a
water lank burst and flooded his
room he yelled, "Tidal wave!" and
ran. A Roble woman had the ex
perience of grabbing a door knob
and then feeling the floor sink out
from under her.
The day wore on, and the cam
-1 pus became a camping ground as
I bedding was brought out and
! some tents were pitched. Since
i more quakes were predicted, no
| one felt safe to sleep indoors for
; several flays.
President David Starr Jordan
| had predicted that another hard
quake would come about 11 that
1 morning. A Chinese cook remark
! ed. "Why he no telly us about the
! first one?"
Next day the campus paper an
; nounced work suspended for the
| semester (Stanford was on a se
mester system until 1917). Stu
! dents would be rated on class
standing. Thus, those with ade-
{ quale grades would receive full
! credit, while the others would
have to take special exams at a
later date.
Teddy ( allies
United Stales President Theo
dore Roosevelt cabled a message,
run jn Friday's Daily, in which he
expressed hope the damage to
Stanford was not as severe as re
ports indicated.
The New York Times ran two
I main headlines on the 19th; one
! was about San Francisco, while
i the other read: "Ruins Where
Stanford Stood." The London
j Times received a report that all
' buildings but one were wrecked.

The campers at Stanford—and
everyone was a camper for sev
eral days—were fairly happy. In
the evenings they sang to the ac
companiment of mandolins ~- as
the glow of burning San Francisco
loomed in the sky.
By Wednesday evening both
Palo Alto and Stanford, stricken
as they were, went to the aid of
the city. Supplies were collected
at the Palo Alto Congregational
Church. Stanford students and
volunteered their serv

Francisco.
Back on Its Feet ***
The University immediately set
about climbing back on its feet.
On Aug. 23 it lived up to its sched
ule and reopened. And on Sept. 15
the members of the Class of 1906
received their diplomas at a slight
ly belated graduation ceremony-
Despite repair costs, the Board
of Trustees did not establish a
tuition charge, although there was
a slight registration fee. Tuition
came later for different reasons.

California breeds men and Stan

Another bright spring morning
began to dawn on the campus of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity exactly half a century ago—
Wednesday, April 18, 1906.
But before tho hands of the
clock on Memorial Church tower
could fully read 5:13, the tower
itself sank into the Church. From
Memorial Arch stones began fly
ing like water spurting from a
fountain.
in 47 seconds the greatest earth
quake man has ever known in
California killed two at Stanford
and did $2 million damage to the
campus, with destruction ranging
from cracked plaster to totally
devastated buildings.
Loss of life undoubtedly would
have been much higher had the
quake struck later in the day.
Buildings Tossed
At Stanford the awakenfed resi
dents either jumped or were boun
ced unwillingly out of bed as the
buildings were tossed like ships
on an angry sea.
Everyone's immediate destina
tion was outside, as a terrific din
caused by falling stones and tim
bers resounded over the campus.
They were greeted by a swirling
cloud of dust arising from and

dome had gaily swayed'back and
forth, knocking down the brick
and mortar wings.
Strangely, the dome stayed in
tact, resembling a giant bird cage.
Even the glass windows remained,
brightly reflecting the morning
sunlight.
The new brick wings at the Mu
seum went down, never to be re
placed, and many priceless display
items were splintered beyond rec
ognition. The main Museum struc
ture of reinforced concrete with
stood the quake with only super
ficial damage.
Quad Hoped Of 112
Dangerous areas of the Quad
and other buildings were roped
off by 7 a.m., and guards kept the
curious from unsafe areas. Souve
nir hunters were also discouraged.
By this time the crowd num
bered several thousand, as every
one for miles around had ridden
jor walked to see the disrupted
! campus. .
! Although the crowd fed* the
| most part was solemn and quiet,
I there were bursts of laughter as
they saw the statue of Agassi/,
plunged head-first into the con
crete.
He had "dived" from his perch
on Zoology Building (now Jordan
Hall) and he evoked such com
ments as "He always was a man
of great penetration" and "Mr.
Agassi/, was good in the abstract
but not in the concrete."
One student even shook hands
with him.
Chi Psi Rocked
Wooden residences rode out the
quake remarkably well. Fallen
chimneys and plaster were the
main damage, although the Chi
j Psi house was knocked 10 feet off
its foundations.
Back at Encina, 300 men joined
| in the rescue of buried students.
I Ropes and ladders were brought
from the firehouse, the jammed
door was broken down with a
heavy pole, and the rescue gang
I formed a long line, passing rubble
out as they uncovered the victims.
About seven, in all, received in
juries which required medical at
tention. Most injuries were caused
I when students leaped out of upper
I floor windows.
One Encina man. at the first
| rumbling of the quake, leaped out
| of his fourth-floor window, jump
led up instead of down, caught the
eaves and hung there until he was
snatched back in by astonished
' friends.

Another Enci na man sat
; through Hie quake, but when a
water lank burst and flooded his
room he yelled, "Tidal wave!" and
ran. A Roble woman had the ex
perience of grabbing a door knob
and then feeling the floor sink out
from under her.
The day wore on, and the cam
-1 pus became a camping ground as
I bedding was brought out and
! some tents were pitched. Since
i more quakes were predicted, no
| one felt safe to sleep indoors for
; several flays.
President David Starr Jordan
| had predicted that another hard
quake would come about 11 that
1 morning. A Chinese cook remark
! ed. "Why he no telly us about the
! first one?"
Next day the campus paper an
; nounced work suspended for the
| semester (Stanford was on a se
mester system until 1917). Stu
! dents would be rated on class
standing. Thus, those with ade-
{ quale grades would receive full
! credit, while the others would
have to take special exams at a
later date.
Teddy ( allies
United Stales President Theo
dore Roosevelt cabled a message,
run jn Friday's Daily, in which he
expressed hope the damage to
Stanford was not as severe as re
ports indicated.
The New York Times ran two
I main headlines on the 19th; one
! was about San Francisco, while
i the other read: "Ruins Where
Stanford Stood." The London
j Times received a report that all
' buildings but one were wrecked.

The campers at Stanford—and
everyone was a camper for sev
eral days—were fairly happy. In
the evenings they sang to the ac
companiment of mandolins ~- as
the glow of burning San Francisco
loomed in the sky.
By Wednesday evening both
Palo Alto and Stanford, stricken
as they were, went to the aid of
the city. Supplies were collected
at the Palo Alto Congregational
Church. Stanford students and
volunteered their serv

Francisco.
Back on Its Feet ***
The University immediately set
about climbing back on its feet.
On Aug. 23 it lived up to its sched
ule and reopened. And on Sept. 15
the members of the Class of 1906
received their diplomas at a slight
ly belated graduation ceremony-
Despite repair costs, the Board
of Trustees did not establish a
tuition charge, although there was
a slight registration fee. Tuition
came later for different reasons.
"Stone Ase"
In the early days of building
construction at Stanford, Presi
dent Jordan had dubbed the peri
od "Stanford's Stone Age." After
ihe quake he spoke of the "Second
Stone Age."
But on the day of the quake he
had emphatically announced that
the University would carry on. It
did. And it does. That spring
morning he had told the crowd
gathered in front of Encina, "Men,
not buildings, make a college, and
California breeds men and Stan
ford calls them."
Another bright spring morning
began to dawn on the campus of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity exactly half a century ago—
Wednesday, April 18, 1906.
But before tho hands of the
clock on Memorial Church tower
could fully read 5:13, the tower
itself sank into the Church. From
Memorial Arch stones began fly
ing like water spurting from a
fountain.
in 47 seconds the greatest earth
quake man has ever known in
California killed two at Stanford
and did $2 million damage to the
campus, with destruction ranging
from cracked plaster to totally
devastated buildings.
Loss of life undoubtedly would
have been much higher had the
quake struck later in the day.
Buildings Tossed
At Stanford the awakenfed resi
dents either jumped or were boun
ced unwillingly out of bed as the
buildings were tossed like ships
on an angry sea.
Everyone's immediate destina
tion was outside, as a terrific din
caused by falling stones and tim
bers resounded over the campus.
They were greeted by a swirling
cloud of dust arising from and
even concealing the Quad.
From Engineering Building
masses of steam rose like a vol
cano, and from the Church and
the Arch a fine bluish dust mixed
with steam from broken lines to
present an eerie effect.
At Encina Hall the two heavy
chimneys collapsed and ripped
through all the floors to the base
ment, carrying down four men
among the bricks and splinters.
Sophomore Killed
One of the four, sophomore Jun
ius R. Hanna, was later pulled
from the wreckage dead. Two es
caped practically uninjured, while
another was hurt, but not too seri
ously.
The only other death at Stan
lord occurred when electrician
Otto Gerdes ran back into the
powerhouse to shut off the elec
tricity, thus averting a fire. As he
came back out he was buried in
■tons of rubble from the tall brick
chimney, which had snapped like
the lash of a whip.
A woman in old Roble Hall had
gone to sleep on the fourth floor
and woke up in the parlor, as the
toppling chimneys opened holes
in the floor. Miraculously she es
caped injury.
J library Destroyed
The new Library, almost com
pleted on I.asuen Street opposite
the Chemistry Building, was dam

of great penetration" and "Mr.

but not in the concrete."
One student even shook hands
with him.
Chi Psi Rocked
Wooden residences rode out the
quake remarkably well. Fallen
chimneys and plaster were the
main damage, although the Chi
j Psi house was knocked 10 feet off
its foundations.
Back at Encina, 300 men joined

I Ropes and ladders were brought
from the firehouse, the jammed
door was broken down with a
heavy pole, and the rescue gang

out as they uncovered the victims.
About seven, in all, received in
juries which required medical at
tention. Most injuries were caused
I when students leaped out of upper
I floor windows.
One Encina man. at the first

led up instead of down, caught the
eaves and hung there until he was
snatched back in by astonished
' friends.

Another Enci na man sat

water lank burst and flooded his
room he yelled, "Tidal wave!" and
ran. A Roble woman had the ex
perience of grabbing a door knob
and then feeling the floor sink out
from under her.
The day wore on, and the cam

have to take special exams at a

Teddy ( allies
United Stales President Theo

run jn Friday's Daily, in which he
expressed hope the damage to
Stanford was not as severe as re
ports indicated.
The New York Times ran two

' buildings but one were wrecked.

The campers at Stanford—and
everyone was a camper for sev
eral days—were fairly happy. In
the evenings they sang to the ac
companiment of mandolins ~- as
the glow of burning San Francisco
loomed in the sky.
By Wednesday evening both
Palo Alto and Stanford, stricken
as they were, went to the aid of
the city. Supplies were collected
at the Palo Alto Congregational
Church. Stanford students and
volunteered their serv

Francisco.
Back on Its Feet ***
The University immediately set
about climbing back on its feet.
On Aug. 23 it lived up to its sched
ule and reopened. And on Sept. 15
the members of the Class of 1906
received their diplomas at a slight
ly belated graduation ceremony-
Despite repair costs, the Board
of Trustees did not establish a
tuition charge, although there was
a slight registration fee. Tuition
came later for different reasons.
"Stone Ase"
In the early days of building
construction at Stanford, Presi
dent Jordan had dubbed the peri
od "Stanford's Stone Age." After
ihe quake he spoke of the "Second
Stone Age."
But on the day of the quake he
had emphatically announced that
the University would carry on. It
did. And it does. That spring
morning he had told the crowd
gathered in front of Encina, "Men,
not buildings, make a college, and
California breeds men and Stan
ford calls them."
Another bright spring morning
began to dawn on the campus of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity exactly half a century ago—
Wednesday, April 18, 1906.
But before tho hands of the
clock on Memorial Church tower
could fully read 5:13, the tower
itself sank into the Church. From
Memorial Arch stones began fly
ing like water spurting from a
fountain.
in 47 seconds the greatest earth
quake man has ever known in
California killed two at Stanford
and did $2 million damage to the
campus, with destruction ranging
from cracked plaster to totally
devastated buildings.
Loss of life undoubtedly would
have been much higher had the
quake struck later in the day.
Buildings Tossed
At Stanford the awakenfed resi
dents either jumped or were boun
ced unwillingly out of bed as the
buildings were tossed like ships
on an angry sea.
Everyone's immediate destina
tion was outside, as a terrific din
caused by falling stones and tim
bers resounded over the campus.
They were greeted by a swirling
cloud of dust arising from and
even concealing the Quad.
From Engineering Building
masses of steam rose like a vol
cano, and from the Church and
the Arch a fine bluish dust mixed
with steam from broken lines to
present an eerie effect.
At Encina Hall the two heavy
chimneys collapsed and ripped
through all the floors to the base
ment, carrying down four men
among the bricks and splinters.
Sophomore Killed
One of the four, sophomore Jun
ius R. Hanna, was later pulled
from the wreckage dead. Two es
caped practically uninjured, while
another was hurt, but not too seri
ously.
The only other death at Stan
lord occurred when electrician
Otto Gerdes ran back into the
powerhouse to shut off the elec
tricity, thus averting a fire. As he
came back out he was buried in
■tons of rubble from the tall brick
chimney, which had snapped like
the lash of a whip.
A woman in old Roble Hall had
gone to sleep on the fourth floor
and woke up in the parlor, as the
toppling chimneys opened holes
in the floor. Miraculously she es
caped injury.
J library Destroyed
The new Library, almost com
pleted on I.asuen Street opposite
the Chemistry Building, was dam
aged beyond repair. The high
dome had gaily swayed'back and
forth, knocking down the brick
and mortar wings.
Strangely, the dome stayed in
tact, resembling a giant bird cage.
Even the glass windows remained,
brightly reflecting the morning
sunlight.
The new brick wings at the Mu
seum went down, never to be re
placed, and many priceless display
items were splintered beyond rec
ognition. The main Museum struc
ture of reinforced concrete with
stood the quake with only super
ficial damage.
Quad Hoped Of 112
Dangerous areas of the Quad
and other buildings were roped
off by 7 a.m., and guards kept the
curious from unsafe areas. Souve
nir hunters were also discouraged.
By this time the crowd num
bered several thousand, as every
one for miles around had ridden
jor walked to see the disrupted
! campus. .
! Although the crowd fed* the
| most part was solemn and quiet,
I there were bursts of laughter as
they saw the statue of Agassi/,
plunged head-first into the con
crete.
He had "dived" from his perch
on Zoology Building (now Jordan
Hall) and he evoked such com
ments as "He always was a man
of great penetration" and "Mr.
Agassi/, was good in the abstract
but not in the concrete."
One student even shook hands
