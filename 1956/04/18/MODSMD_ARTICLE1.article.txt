# Earthquake Has Golden Anniversary
## $2 Million Damage, Two Die on Campus In 1906 Temblor 
### Rich Brown 
Another bright spring morning
began to dawn on the campus of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity exactly half a century ago—
Wednesday, April 18, 1906.
But before tho hands of the
clock on Memorial Church tower
could fully read 5:13, the tower
itself sank into the Church. From
Memorial Arch stones began fly
ing like water spurting from a
fountain.
in 47 seconds the greatest earth
quake man has ever known in
California killed two at Stanford
and did $2 million damage to the
campus, with destruction ranging
from cracked plaster to totally
devastated buildings.
Loss of life undoubtedly would
have been much higher had the
quake struck later in the day.
Buildings Tossed
At Stanford the awakenfed resi
dents either jumped or were boun
ced unwillingly out of bed as the
buildings were tossed like ships
on an angry sea.
Everyone's immediate destina
tion was outside, as a terrific din
caused by falling stones and tim
bers resounded over the campus.
They were greeted by a swirling
cloud of dust arising from and
even concealing the Quad.
From Engineering Building
masses of steam rose like a vol
cano, and from the Church and
the Arch a fine bluish dust mixed
with steam from broken lines to
present an eerie effect.
At Encina Hall the two heavy
chimneys collapsed and ripped
through all the floors to the base
ment, carrying down four men
among the bricks and splinters.
Sophomore Killed
One of the four, sophomore Jun
ius R. Hanna, was later pulled
from the wreckage dead. Two es
caped practically uninjured, while
another was hurt, but not too seri
ously.
The only other death at Stan
lord occurred when electrician
Otto Gerdes ran back into the
powerhouse to shut off the elec
tricity, thus averting a fire. As he
came back out he was buried in
■tons of rubble from the tall brick
chimney, which had snapped like
the lash of a whip.
A woman in old Roble Hall had
gone to sleep on the fourth floor
and woke up in the parlor, as the
toppling chimneys opened holes
in the floor. Miraculously she es
caped injury.
J library Destroyed
The new Library, almost com
pleted on I.asuen Street opposite
the Chemistry Building, was dam
aged beyond repair. The high
dome had gaily swayed'back and
forth, knocking down the brick
and mortar wings.
Strangely, the dome stayed in
tact, resembling a giant bird cage.
Even the glass windows remained,
brightly reflecting the morning
sunlight.
The new brick wings at the Mu
seum went down, never to be re
placed, and many priceless display
items were splintered beyond rec
ognition. The main Museum struc
ture of reinforced concrete with
stood the quake with only super
ficial damage.
Quad Hoped Of 112
Dangerous areas of the Quad
and other buildings were roped
off by 7 a.m., and guards kept the
curious from unsafe areas. Souve
nir hunters were also discouraged.
By this time the crowd num
bered several thousand, as every
one for miles around had ridden
