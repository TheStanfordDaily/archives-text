# Traffic Com Agrees to SU Five-Year Plan
## 
### 
Student Traific Committee
agreed yesterday to the Univer
sity's long-range, five-year traffic
plan in a conference held in the
business manager's map room in
Encina Hall.
University officials plan to use
a peripheral road which encircles
the campus. The inner campus
roads will be closed so all traffic
will be drained to the peripheral
system.
Three legs of the circling road,
which will be enlarged to four
lanes, have yet to be built.
The legs include: one, from Ar
guello Street to Lasuen to ip front
of Moore Hall; another, from
Palm Drive to the medical and
science quads; and the third, from
that point to Willow Road.
Arguello
Arguello will be connected to
the peripheral road system next
summer when Russell House is
torn down and the road built in
front of Moore Hall.
Legs two and three will not be
finished for three to five years.
In the interim Lomita will serve
as the north boundary of the sys
tem.
The delay brings up two tempo
rary traffic problems at the Post
Offico and on Calve/ Street beside
Crothers and Encina.
Building of the music building
on the corner of Lasuen and Santa
Teresa streets next to the Post
Office has caused campus Police
Chief Gordy Davis to close the
corner to traffic.

Business Manager Alf E. Bran
din said Galvcz Street from Escon
dido to Scrra will be closed during
summer quarter in an effort to
make the area safer for pedes
trians. "Stanford is a cultural and
educational institution, not an au
tomobile rink," he said.
Disagreement came only when
Student Traffic Committer Chair
man Bob Maddock asked that San
ta Teresa in front of Lagunita be
opened. The University officials
explained that the road must re
main closed "for the safety of the
women living there."
Parking was another topic that
the students and University offi
cials tackled.
Assistant to the President Ken
neth M. Cuthbertson. Dean of Stu
dents 11. Donald Winbigler, As
sistant Business Manager Sera
phim F. Post and Chief Davis rep
resented the University at the
meeting.
