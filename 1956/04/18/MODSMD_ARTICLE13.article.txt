NEWARK, N. J., April 17 (UP)
Gov. Robert B. Meyner picked
up an early 2-1 lead over Sen.
Estes Kefauver tonight in a popu
larity contest which highlighted
New Jersey's primary election.
With 1898 election districts out
of the state's 1160 reporting. Mey
ner's list of unpledged delegates
had received 127,029 votes to 52,-
998 for Kefauver's slate of pledg
ed delegates.
In the preferential part of the
ballot, in which the voters picked
their choice as a President, the
tally was:
Eisenhower 1 (>.3,371 with 2538
districts reporting.
Kefauver 78,402 with 2329 dis
tricts reporting.
Adlai Stevenson had received
553 write-in votes.
The fight over delegates was
considered the main event in the
primary. Meyner has insisted that
the organization's slate remain un
pledged, but the state Democratic
organization was considered as fa
vorable to Stevenson.
Though Mey ner's delegates
were pulling ahead on the tabu
lated delegates-at-large race, there
was a chance Kefauver would gain
strength in the tabulation for dis
trict delegates.
At stake were the state's 36
votes in the Democratic National
Convention.
