Tin pagfs of history are filled with enormous
details, masses of faets about the significant
and the insignificant. Take the page for April
18, IW6; on it is recorded a quite significant
♦■vent, the San Francisco earthquake.
Coupled with this significant event is one of
those insignificant facts: the founding of the
Hammer and Coffin Society and, even more
insignificant, the decision of that society to
lake over publication of the Stanford Cha
parral.
Expressing the credo, "It is better to have
lived and laughed than tiot to have laughed at
all," The Chuparral has managed to eke out u
nionth-to'inonth existence for many years. Of
course, it has had a few breaks in publication—
when thoughtful deans decided stafT members
needed a temporary rest from their labors.
Actually The Chaparral lias made us laugh—
not 100 often, but, nevertheless, we have
laughed.
\\ • feel like a big brother to our once-a

month cousin. Why, we even like The Cha
parral. in fact, we read if (they send us a com
plimentary copy of every issue).
Like all little brothers, The Chaparral
times has nasty words for big brother Daily,
hut, like a true big brother, we laugh it off, pat
the little fellow on the hack ami put our knife
away for a mouth.
Now that it's Chappie lime again, we've
sharpened up our knife for the customary game
of mutual admiration.
But on second thought we're going to put
tlown the knife (for this month anyway) and
w»y thanks.
Thanks to the Hammer and Coffin hoys for
keeping all of us from that worst of all human
frailties: taking ourselves too seriously.
Indeed, it is better to have lived and laughed
than not to have laughed at all (even if some
times at the expense of our favrtrite news
paper) .
Happy birthday.
