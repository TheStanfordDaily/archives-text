# Isolated Fans
## 
### 
Ma.jor lf.a<;uf. hasfbai.L got under way yester
da\ and millions of Tails were making their
choices and predicting tlie nnteonie of Aineri
ca's National Pastime.
I iifortunately, Hay Area big - league fans
found thcmsclxe* isolated from tlie opening day
action. Tin \ might as well have been on the
other side of the world.
I here v\as no radio coverage of any game
\est«-rday. fans had to rely on random news
broadcasts or word-of-mouth for the statistics.
The disheartening fact: radio station KVA,
which has given tin* Hay Area recreated daily
broadcasts or word-of-mouth for the bare sta
moving to night game coverage. Presumably
ihis will eliminate any conflict with afternoon
Seals games.
\\ hile there is certainly no complaint against
broadcasting night games, sports fans may
well feel they are being shortchanged on the

whole deal as the season progresses and crucial
daytime tilts are scheduled in pennant-contend
ing cities.
Haseball is a sport of such wide popular in
terest that there is no sound reason why day
games sliould not he brought direct to the Hay
Area and its major league fans.
Time differentials are such that direct broad
casts would not normally interfere with Pacific
Coast League games.
Mutual Broadcasting Company stations have
''Game of the Day" programming available, as
in the past. Signing a contract to receive these
direct broadcasts involves only money.
As for money —there should he no substan
tial problem signing advertisers. It has been
done before, both nationally and locally.
Why limit baseball fans to recreated niglit
games arid a Saturday TV contest?
Let's have major league ball every day.
