As with many manifestations of the Ameri
can political process, the election forecaster
can often get more from reading between the
lines of primary election returns than lie can
l>\ taking them at face value.
The difficulty of reading these results,- ac
curately and the very dependability of relying
on returns as indications of a candidate's
strength are easily seen in the contradictory in
terpretations each party gives to the final tabu
lations.
Last week's Illinois primary, for instance,
looked on the surface much like an Eisenhower
victory: yet Stevenson's home state rallied be
hind him far stronger than it did in '52.
To the Republicans, this was a thumping en
dorsement of Ike: to the Democrats, a stirring
rally behind Stevenson.
For the Democrats, yesterday's New Jersey
primary was a contest between Kefauver and a
technically unpledged, but actually pro-Steven
son delegation led by the state's Governor Rob
ert Meyner. Kefauver has an advantage here
because his name appears directly on the ballot,
whereas his major contender's does not.
Nevertheless, despite the hazy conclusions
drawn from the past four primaries in New
Hampshire, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois,
several points are worth serious consideration.
Kefauver's folksy appeal has done well in
undermining Democratic hopes for Stevenson.
\lthough far from lead, Stevenson may find
his path through the Democratic National Con
veil lion obstructed by the Tennessee senator
and the ever-present "dark horse."
Although declaring he will not compromise
hi- ideals, Stevenson, having learned a lesson
from his opposition, is now ready to step down
from the rostrum and meet the people.
Eisenhower's popularity has diminished little
except in the farm slates, and even Nixon's was
given a surprising boost when 22,930 New
llampshirites wrote in his name on the GOP
ballot.
Primaries in three of the four tested slates
-how that the President's glow has been severely
tarnished by declining farm prices and disgust
with Administration action in this field. Ike
lid in Illinois and lost 18 per cent of his '52 fol
low ing in W lNConsin.
Predictions from primary results are politi
cally loaded and it is only the summer conven
tions and November ballot boxes that can ac
curately decipher the primary jargon.
