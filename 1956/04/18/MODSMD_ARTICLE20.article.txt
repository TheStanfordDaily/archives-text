# Primary Election Implications Discussed by Daily Columnists

### JIM PALMER 
Going into yesterday's New Jersey primary,
the battle for convention votes between Senator
Kstes ("I will get the nomination") Kefauver
and job-seeker Adlai ("My opponent is a mud
slinger") Stevenson was very close.
Out of a Democratic Convention total vote of
1372, Kefauver had votes and Stevenson
61 y 2 sewed up as of Monday. Sixty-six votes
were uncommitted, and Governor Averell Har
riman of New York had a single pledged dele
gate from Maine.
Early primaries indicate just how close the
convention will split, but thus far the only real
test has been the Minnesota primary. It is dan
gerous to rely too heavily on others.
Key tests will he in Florida (May 29) and
California (June 5). That is why both candi
dates are devoting a majority of their time to
these two states.
Lesser weight must he given the Illinois vote
(where Adlai ran unopposed with home state
support), New Jersey (where Estes battled an
"unpledged'" delegation) and Wisconsin (where
Estes received little opposition, campaign-wise).
In the final analysis, primary votes may mean
little in the actual convention unless an un
usual (and unexpected) lopsided total can be
run up by one of the hopefuls.
Even though the Kefauver bandwagon gained
speed in Minnesota, it still has tremendous ob
stacles to overcome.
If Kefauver is to he nominated he must gain
the support of the "big city machines" (e.g.
DeSapio of Tammany and Avery of Chicago).
This support was not received in 1952 and is not
forthcoming at this time.
Nomination of the Tennessee Senator may
split the South and cause a walk-out reminiscent
of the 1918 Convention. Southern segregation
ists do not like Kefauver's stand on the Negro
problem.
"Pledged" delegates are pledged only so long
as they want to he (in other words, as long as
their candidate looks like a winner.) Opposi
tion from the top echelons to Kefauver may kill
support as rapidly as it did in 1952.
Hut it must not be overlooked that primary
elections can influence minds of these top eche
lons. Repetition in Florida and California of
the Minnesota sweep may give Kefauver the
boost he needs.
As for the Republicans, it's strictly no contest
all the way along. Primaries are only reinforc
ing the conclusion that Republicans want no
one but Ike.

the battle for convention votes between Senator
Kstes ("I will get the nomination") Kefauver
and job-seeker Adlai ("My opponent is a mud
slinger") Stevenson was very close.
Out of a Democratic Convention total vote of
1372, Kefauver had votes and Stevenson
61 y 2 sewed up as of Monday. Sixty-six votes
were uncommitted, and Governor Averell Har
riman of New York had a single pledged dele
gate from Maine.
Early primaries indicate just how close the
convention will split, but thus far the only real
test has been the Minnesota primary. It is dan
gerous to rely too heavily on others.
Key tests will he in Florida (May 29) and
California (June 5). That is why both candi
dates are devoting a majority of their time to
these two states.
Lesser weight must he given the Illinois vote
(where Adlai ran unopposed with home state
support), New Jersey (where Estes battled an
"unpledged'" delegation) and Wisconsin (where
Estes received little opposition, campaign-wise).
In the final analysis, primary votes may mean
little in the actual convention unless an un
usual (and unexpected) lopsided total can be
run up by one of the hopefuls.
Even though the Kefauver bandwagon gained
speed in Minnesota, it still has tremendous ob
stacles to overcome.
If Kefauver is to he nominated he must gain
the support of the "big city machines" (e.g.
DeSapio of Tammany and Avery of Chicago).
This support was not received in 1952 and is not
forthcoming at this time.
Nomination of the Tennessee Senator may
split the South and cause a walk-out reminiscent
of the 1918 Convention. Southern segregation
ists do not like Kefauver's stand on the Negro
problem.
"Pledged" delegates are pledged only so long
as they want to he (in other words, as long as
their candidate looks like a winner.) Opposi
tion from the top echelons to Kefauver may kill
support as rapidly as it did in 1952.
Hut it must not be overlooked that primary
elections can influence minds of these top eche
lons. Repetition in Florida and California of
the Minnesota sweep may give Kefauver the
boost he needs.
As for the Republicans, it's strictly no contest
all the way along. Primaries are only reinforc
ing the conclusion that Republicans want no
one but Ike.
