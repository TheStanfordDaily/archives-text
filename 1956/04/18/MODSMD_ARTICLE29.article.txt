MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING
1 have asked the makers of Philip Morris - an enterprising
and aggressive group of men; yet at the same time warm and
lovable; though not without acumen, perspicacity, and drive;
which does not, however, mask their essential greatheartedness;
a quality evident to all who have ever enjoyed the beneficence and
gentleness of their wares; 1 refer, of course, to Philip Morris
Cigarettes, a smoke fashioned with such loving care and ten
dered with such kind regard that these old eyes grow misty when
1 think upon it - 1 have asked, 1 say, the makers of Philip Morris
- that aggregate of shrewd but kindly tobacconists, that covey
of enlightened Merry Andrews, that cluster of good souls bound
together by the profit motive and an unflagging determination
to provide all America with a cigarette forever gentle and
eternally pleasing - 1 have asked, 1 say, the makers of Philip
Morris whether 1 might use today's column to take up the
controversial question: Should a coed share expenses on a date?
"Yes," said the makers simply. We all embraced then and
squeezed each other and exchanged brave smiles, and if our
eyes were a trifle moist, who can blame us?
To the topic then: Should a coed share expenses on a date? I
think 1 can best answer the question by citing the following
typical case:
Poseidon Nebenzal, a student at Oklahoma A and M, majoring
in hides and taHow, fell wildly in love with Mary Ellen Flange,
a flax weevil major at the same school. His love, he had reason
to believe from Mary Ellen's sidelong glances and maidenly
blushes, was not entirely unrequited, and by and by he mustered

up enough courage to ask her the all-important question: "Will
you wear my 4-11 pin?"
"Yes," she said simply. They embraced then and squeezed
each other and exchanged brave smiles, and if their eyes were
a trifle moist, who can blame them?
For a time things went swimmingly. Then a cloud appeared.
Mary Ellen, it seems, was a rich girl and accustomed to costly
pleasures. Poseidon was bone-poor and he quickly ran out of
money. Unable to take Mary Ellen to the posh places she fancied
and too proud to tell her the reason, he turned surly and full of
melancholy. Senseless, violent quarrels developed. Soon it ap
peared that the romance, so promising at the beginning, was
headed for a breakup, but at the last moment, Poseidon man
aged to blurt out the truth.
"'Oh, beloved agrarian!" cried Mary Ellen, grappling him
close. "Oh, proud husbandman! Oh, foolish reaper! Why have
you not told me before? I have plenty of money, and 1 will con
tribute according to my ability."
Poseidon, of course, protested, but she finally persuaded him
of the wisdom of her course. From then on they split all ex
penses according to their incomes. Rather than embarrass
Poseidon by handing him money in public, a joint bank account
was set up to allow him to write checks. Into this account each
week they faithfully deposited their respective allowances — 35
cents from Poseidon; $2.°.00 from Mary Ellen.
And it worked fine! Gone was all the arguing and bickering.
They were happy —truly happy! And what's more, when they
graduated they had a nice little nest egg - eight million dollars
— with which to furnish a lovely apartment in Lubbock, Texas,
where today they operate the local laundromat.
So you see? You too can salvage your failing romance if you
will only adopt a healthy, sensible attitude toward money.
