# April 18, 1906, the Day the Earthquake Hit Stanford
## Repairs to SU Not as Costly As Anticipated Founder's Foresight Greatly Reduces Earthquake Damage 
### 
Throughout the summer of 100(5
passes were required to gain en
trance to the Quad. During this
time work was quickly - but care
fully carried on to put the cam
pus in working order for the fall
semester.
sA\ first look, damage to the
campus had appeared tremen
dous. But it was soon found that
the working part of the Univer
sity as distinguished from the
architectural effects had rela
tively minor damage.
Total damage to all Stanford
property has been estimated at $2
million. Nearly $700,000 was need
ed to put the campus back in
working order. Another $650,000
went for the restoration of Memo
rial Church. There was no insur
ance, and all money came from
regular income or donations.
Not Complete Reconstruction
Reconstruction figures would
undoubtedly be higher had every
thing been restored. The arcade
behind Memorial Church, which
connected Engineering and Geol
ogy corners, for example, was not
put back up.
The arch part of Memorial Arch '
is only a memory, although plans !
were afoot in 1906 to rebuild it !
lower than it had been. The quake |
knocked off the top part, includ- |
ing an observation floor.
Encina was repaired — without|
the ornamental chimneys - — and j
the rear walls of the wings were '
rebuilt.
Minor Koble Damage
Roble encountered minor dam
age, mainly from its chimneys,
and was soon fixed up. Later it
was renamed Sequoia, and in re
cent years the tipper floors were
removed. It now houses statistical
offices.
New decorative entrance gates
had just been completed where
Palm Drive begins at the Palo
Alto city limits. In the few sec
onds which the quake lasted, the
gales were reduced to gravel and
dust.
Half of the Leland Stanfords'
University home was knocked
down. The other half was later
repaired and became the Conva-:
lescent Home.
While planning the University j
back in the '80s, Leland Stanford j
had talked to an old Mexican who i
remembered an earthquake in
1812. With California's "instabil
ity" in mind, the founder instruct
ed the original architects to plan 1
for earthquakes.
Many give Senator Stanford
credit for saving a large number
of lives in Encina and Roble (both i
built during his lifetime), for his
long-range planning had kept the
damage to a minimum in the dor- j
mitories.
Because so many buildings were j
so well planned, the University j
was able to carry on during the j
following semester almost as nor- j
mally as before.


•WHO LBT THE WATER out of the pool?" The statue of Agassi/,
dived from its perch on the present Jordan Hall as the 190(5 temblor
rocked the campus. Terrified as they were, quake victims could not
help laughing at Agassi/ in his undignified position. One student
even shook hands with him.


SWINGING BACK AM) FORTH, the dome of
the almost-completed Library wrecked the brick
wings. The dome itself was practically uninjured
in the 1 !)<)(» temblor and stood like a giant bird-

cage. Both the Library and the Gymnasium were
under construction on Lasucn Street; their re
mains served as grim reminders of the disaster
for many years.

Minor Koble Damage
Roble encountered minor dam
age, mainly from its chimneys,
and was soon fixed up. Later it
was renamed Sequoia, and in re
cent years the tipper floors were
removed. It now houses statistical
offices.
New decorative entrance gates
had just been completed where
Palm Drive begins at the Palo
Alto city limits. In the few sec
onds which the quake lasted, the
gales were reduced to gravel and
dust.
Half of the Leland Stanfords'
University home was knocked
down. The other half was later
repaired and became the Conva-:
lescent Home.
While planning the University j
back in the '80s, Leland Stanford j
had talked to an old Mexican who i
remembered an earthquake in
1812. With California's "instabil
ity" in mind, the founder instruct
ed the original architects to plan 1
for earthquakes.
Many give Senator Stanford
credit for saving a large number
of lives in Encina and Roble (both i
built during his lifetime), for his
long-range planning had kept the
damage to a minimum in the dor- j
mitories.
Because so many buildings were j
so well planned, the University j
was able to carry on during the j
following semester almost as nor- j
mally as before.


•WHO LBT THE WATER out of the pool?" The statue of Agassi/,
dived from its perch on the present Jordan Hall as the 190(5 temblor
rocked the campus. Terrified as they were, quake victims could not
help laughing at Agassi/ in his undignified position. One student
even shook hands with him.


SWINGING BACK AM) FORTH, the dome of
the almost-completed Library wrecked the brick
wings. The dome itself was practically uninjured
in the 1 !)<)(» temblor and stood like a giant bird-

cage. Both the Library and the Gymnasium were
under construction on Lasucn Street; their re
mains served as grim reminders of the disaster
for many years.
Throughout the summer of 100(5
passes were required to gain en
trance to the Quad. During this
time work was quickly - but care
fully carried on to put the cam
pus in working order for the fall
semester.
sA\ first look, damage to the
campus had appeared tremen
dous. But it was soon found that
the working part of the Univer
sity as distinguished from the
architectural effects had rela
tively minor damage.
Total damage to all Stanford
property has been estimated at $2
million. Nearly $700,000 was need
ed to put the campus back in
working order. Another $650,000
went for the restoration of Memo
rial Church. There was no insur
ance, and all money came from
regular income or donations.
Not Complete Reconstruction
Reconstruction figures would
undoubtedly be higher had every
thing been restored. The arcade
behind Memorial Church, which
connected Engineering and Geol
ogy corners, for example, was not
put back up.
The arch part of Memorial Arch '
is only a memory, although plans !
were afoot in 1906 to rebuild it !
lower than it had been. The quake |
knocked off the top part, includ- |
ing an observation floor.
Encina was repaired — without|
the ornamental chimneys - — and j
the rear walls of the wings were '
rebuilt.
