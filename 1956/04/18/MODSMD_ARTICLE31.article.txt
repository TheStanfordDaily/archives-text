"It is reported from Palo Alio
ihat all but one of the buildings
of Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity have been destroyed by an
♦ arthquake and that the beautiful
Memorial Church of the Univer
sity, perhaps the most beautiful
of all buildings in the United
States, is a mass of ruins."
That announcement appeared in
Ihe London Times of April 19, j
\906, in England's first report of :
the disaster.
On April 18, at 13 minutes past
5, the severest earthquake in mod
ern times swept across the Santa
Clara Valley. An earthquake that
lasted 20 seconds all but destroyed
a magnificent church which had
taken three years to build.
The church's towering Gothic
spire toppled northward into Out
er Quad, and the northern and
southern ends of the church were
blown out.
Mosaics Scattered
The force of this "explosion"
scattered the spectacular mosaics,
above the church entrance, all
over the campus.
Mosaics later turned up near!
the Stanford Oak Tree and in the
bed of San Francisquito Creek.
In the inside of the church,
walls cracked, disfiguring stained
ylass windows and costly mosaics,
interior decoration losses alone
amounted to nearly $600,000.
Of the demolition of the church
ihe Daily Palo Alto on April 21,
1906, said. "Timbers, bricks, mor
tar, stones weighing hundreds of
pounds were hurled into the body
of the church, smashing windows,
statuary and woodwork, wrecking
pews and ornaments, and littering
the interior with debris."
Organ Saved
Luckily, the front wall of the
church did not tumble inward and

crush the organ. That valuable in
strument later was able to be re
stored.
Two leaders who had helped en
hance Memorial Church's great
ness were not around to see their
edifice wrecked.
One was Mrs. Leland Stanford,
who had decided upon the inscrip
tions which lined the walls of the
building and who had located the
church "at the heart of the cam
pus." Mrs. Stanford had died in
1905, one year before the earth
quake.
The other was Dean Hodges,
University chaplain. Hodges had
preached his farewell sermon on
April 15, 1906, three days before
the earthquake, and had returned
to his ministry in Cambridge,
Mass.
Not until 1913 was the church
restored. Restoration involved the
painstaking task of numbering
the scattered stones and blocks
which had made up the church
and fitting them together as if in
a jigsaw puzzle.
Even in 1913, though, the beau
tiful tower could not be erected.

Organ Saved
Luckily, the front wall of the
church did not tumble inward and

crush the organ. That valuable in
strument later was able to be re
stored.
Two leaders who had helped en
hance Memorial Church's great
ness were not around to see their
edifice wrecked.
One was Mrs. Leland Stanford,
who had decided upon the inscrip
tions which lined the walls of the
building and who had located the
church "at the heart of the cam
pus." Mrs. Stanford had died in
1905, one year before the earth
quake.
The other was Dean Hodges,
University chaplain. Hodges had
preached his farewell sermon on
April 15, 1906, three days before
the earthquake, and had returned
to his ministry in Cambridge,
Mass.
Not until 1913 was the church
restored. Restoration involved the
painstaking task of numbering
the scattered stones and blocks
which had made up the church
and fitting them together as if in
a jigsaw puzzle.
Even in 1913, though, the beau
tiful tower could not be erected.
"It is reported from Palo Alio
ihat all but one of the buildings
of Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity have been destroyed by an
♦ arthquake and that the beautiful
Memorial Church of the Univer
sity, perhaps the most beautiful
of all buildings in the United
States, is a mass of ruins."
That announcement appeared in
Ihe London Times of April 19, j
\906, in England's first report of :
the disaster.
On April 18, at 13 minutes past
5, the severest earthquake in mod
ern times swept across the Santa
Clara Valley. An earthquake that
lasted 20 seconds all but destroyed
a magnificent church which had
taken three years to build.
The church's towering Gothic
spire toppled northward into Out
er Quad, and the northern and
southern ends of the church were
blown out.
Mosaics Scattered
The force of this "explosion"
scattered the spectacular mosaics,
above the church entrance, all
over the campus.
Mosaics later turned up near!
the Stanford Oak Tree and in the
bed of San Francisquito Creek.
In the inside of the church,
walls cracked, disfiguring stained
ylass windows and costly mosaics,
interior decoration losses alone
amounted to nearly $600,000.
Of the demolition of the church
ihe Daily Palo Alto on April 21,
1906, said. "Timbers, bricks, mor
tar, stones weighing hundreds of
pounds were hurled into the body
of the church, smashing windows,
statuary and woodwork, wrecking
pews and ornaments, and littering
the interior with debris."
