# Observers Tell Impressions Of Chaos, Panic, Destruction
## Students Organized as Guards to Protect Danger Spots While Dust Rose from Ruins 
### Rich Brown 
This 50th anniversary of the
great earthquake of 1906 brings
back vivid memories to many who
were students at the time. Three
of those eyewitnesses tell their
impressions of that fateful day.
John Brainier, son of Stanford's
second president, lived with his
parents on Alvarado Street. At
that time,his father was head of
the Geology Department.
"I thought surely the house was
going to cave in," he said as he
recalled the violent shaking which
woke him up. He ran to the front
door, and as he opened it the big
plate glass window of the parlor
fell in.
"There was a terrific noise from
the crashing of the church spire
and Encina's chimneys." Like all
the chimneys, the Branners' chim
ney also fell down.
Dr. Branner noted that the old
est buildings, designed by a Bos
ton architect firm, withstood the
quake much better than some of
the newer structures.
Another student whose father
was a professor is Mrs. Helen
Green Cross, now associate direc
tor of the Art Gallery and Mu
seum.
Insane Roam Country
She recalls the excitement and
near-pbnic resulting when word
was received that the walls of
Agnew Insane Asylum near San
Jose were down and the inmates
had run of the country.
"Fortunately none of them got
as far as Stanford, but we were
on edge for a while."
She mentions that many men
students organized as guards aft
er the quake. These guards kept
people from potential danger
spots ar*l also guarded the Roble
women while they slept on the
lawn.
"One n|f the two men who took
telegram*; from Stanford knew
the Morsie code and was able to
lend a helping hand to overworked
telegraphers at Sacramento," she
recalls.
Minor Panics
She said each aftershock caused
minor panic, because each move
ment was thought to be the be
ginning (rtf another major quake.
The preisent associate editor of
The San Francisco News, Paul
Edwards, in 1906 was the Stan
ford correspondent for the San
t Francisco Bulletin. (The Bulletin
was later j merged with The Call
by Williaijn Randolph Hearst and
became t life present Call-Bulletin.)
Edwards, who now lives in Los
Altos, belonged to Delta Upsilon
fraternity on Salvatierra Street.
He remerrtbers waking up to find
the house doing a rumba.
Into Pajamas
He jumijed out of bed. snatched
his clothes and began getting

dressed. As lie ran out, however,
ho discovered he had gotten hack
into his pajamas instead of his
clothes.
As he went down the street lie
could see clouds of dust rising
lrom the Quad and Eneina.
Remembering his duty to con
vey the latest news to The Bulle
tin, he tried to send his "scoop"
by the communications systems
but found them out of order.
So he went with another stu
dent correspondent,* John Cash
ing, who worked for The ('ail then
and is now president of Oceanic
Steamship Co., and the two hired
horses and a surrey at Palo Alto
Livery Stables.
The dashing young reporters
reached the town of Colma, on the
edge of San Francisco, and were
informed the military had taken
control of the city.
They left the surrey in Colma
and walked the rest of the way.
In San Francisco they parted and
headed for their respective papers.
At Van Ness and Market a po
liceman halted Edwards. "But I
just have to get this story to the
newspaper," the student protested.
"They've All Burned"
"There aren't any papers—they
have all burned up," replied the
officer.
He wandered through the part
of the city which was not afire
and eventually reached the water
front. "Fireboats were pumping
I wildly, but it was like spitting at
a volcano."
I He worked in a relief agency
' lor several days and at the same
time watched the fiery destruc
tion of much of the city.
He remembers how smoke from
the 112 1 a m in g metropolis mush
roomed out. in later years pio
tures of the atomic bomb were to
rekindle his memories of the flam
ing San Francisco of April 18, lit
and 20 of 1906.

He jumijed out of bed. snatched
his clothes and began getting

dressed. As lie ran out, however,
ho discovered he had gotten hack
into his pajamas instead of his
clothes.
As he went down the street lie
could see clouds of dust rising
lrom the Quad and Eneina.
Remembering his duty to con
vey the latest news to The Bulle
tin, he tried to send his "scoop"
by the communications systems
but found them out of order.
So he went with another stu

ing, who worked for The ('ail then
and is now president of Oceanic
Steamship Co., and the two hired
horses and a surrey at Palo Alto
Livery Stables.
The dashing young reporters
reached the town of Colma, on the
edge of San Francisco, and were
informed the military had taken
control of the city.
They left the surrey in Colma
and walked the rest of the way.
In San Francisco they parted and
headed for their respective papers.
At Van Ness and Market a po
liceman halted Edwards. "But I
just have to get this story to the
newspaper," the student protested.
"They've All Burned"
"There aren't any papers—they
have all burned up," replied the
officer.
He wandered through the part
of the city which was not afire
and eventually reached the water
front. "Fireboats were pumping

his clothes and began getting

dressed. As lie ran out, however,
ho discovered he had gotten hack
into his pajamas instead of his
clothes.
As he went down the street lie
could see clouds of dust rising
lrom the Quad and Eneina.
Remembering his duty to con
vey the latest news to The Bulle
tin, he tried to send his "scoop"
by the communications systems
but found them out of order.
So he went with another stu
dent correspondent,* John Cash
ing, who worked for The ('ail then
and is now president of Oceanic
Steamship Co., and the two hired
horses and a surrey at Palo Alto
Livery Stables.
The dashing young reporters
reached the town of Colma, on the
edge of San Francisco, and were
informed the military had taken
control of the city.
They left the surrey in Colma
and walked the rest of the way.
In San Francisco they parted and
headed for their respective papers.
At Van Ness and Market a po
liceman halted Edwards. "But I
just have to get this story to the
newspaper," the student protested.
"They've All Burned"
"There aren't any papers—they
have all burned up," replied the
officer.
He wandered through the part
of the city which was not afire
and eventually reached the water
front. "Fireboats were pumping
I wildly, but it was like spitting at
a volcano."
I He worked in a relief agency
' lor several days and at the same
time watched the fiery destruc
tion of much of the city.
He remembers how smoke from
the 112 1 a m in g metropolis mush
roomed out. in later years pio
tures of the atomic bomb were to
rekindle his memories of the flam
ing San Francisco of April 18, lit
and 20 of 1906.
