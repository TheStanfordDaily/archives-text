# 'Stock' Jokes Prove Burden To Chappie Staff
## 
### 
If the Chappie's heralded 50th
anniversary edition doesn't ap
pear on Quad today as sched
uled, it won't he because its edi
tors have finally run out of old
jokes.
Boys will he boys, and appar
ently the. Old Boy's boys are no
exception.
Said Circulation Manager Bel
ton Fleisher yesterday: "When
I went to the University Press
to pick up the Chappie copies,
one of the Hammer and Coffin
pledges offered to help me car
ry them back to the office.
"When I opened the car door
to put the magazines in, he
grabbed me, and nine other neo
phytes jumped out from their
hiding places and also grabbed
me.
"They took me to the .Mauso
leum, hid the magazines and the
car, tied me up, hung six ham
mers from the ropes and pad
locked me in stocks."
Fleisher said it was a "pledge
sneak" and the first one in Ham
mer and Coffin lie had heard
about.
A Daily reporter obligingly
removed the stocks from his
shoulders.
Said Fleisher: "Since we don't
have the magazines, I don't
know when this issue will come
out."
