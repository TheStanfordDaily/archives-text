### 
Roy Kepler, owner of Kepler's Book and Magazine store on El Ca
mino Real in Menlo Park, has refused to pay his 1955 income taxes.
Kepler, in a letter to the Internal Revenue Bureau in San Francisco,
said by this move he and his wife are "able to make clear our com
plete disapproval of the use to which more than 80 per cent of all

income tax revenue is put: for
armament and military pur
purposes.
"Much of our tax money is to
go into the development of the
intercontinental ballistic missile
with an H-bomb warhead. This
policy of 'deterrence' through mu
tual terror and the threat of 'mas
sive retaliation' is preparation for
mass killing on one hand and sui
cide on the other.
"Since we agree that modern
warfare and its preparation are
I patently crimes against humanity,
and that atomic weapons and guid
ed missiles can produce only geno
cide and suicide, we respectfully
notify you of our conscientious
refusal to supply the money neces
sary for such inhumane pur
poses."
Kepler filled in on his tax form
the amount that was due, but sim
ply refused to pay it."I would
have done this before," he said,
"but this is the first year 1 have
I not been subject to the withhold
ing tax." Kepler has operated his
store 11 months.
In San Francisco an official of
the Bureau of Internal Revenue
said "the matter will be handled
in a routine fashion."
He explained that "letters of
this type are not at all unusual.
When his tax form is processed
he will be sent a bill like all negli
gent taxpayers.
Commenting on the consequen
ces of his refusal, Kepler said: "I
know I'm not bigger than the gov
ernment. Eventually I will have
to pay the tax. But they will have
to come down here to get it from
me.
