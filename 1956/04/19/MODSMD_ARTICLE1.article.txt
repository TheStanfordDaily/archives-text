# Mouse Backs Ike's Veto Of Farm Bill
## Rejects Bill by Vote Of 21 1-202; Mailed As Tribute to Ike 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 18 (UP)
The House, in a smashing per
sonal victory for President Eisen
hower, today approved his veto of
the farm bill, which had passed by
a 56-vote margin only a week ago.
The Democratic move to over
turn the veto not only failed to
get the required two-thirds mar
gin but was rejected by a 211-to
-202 majority. Jubilant GOP lead
ers hailed the outcome as a "tre
mendous tribute" to Eisenhower's
popularity.
House Republican leader Joseph
W. Martin Jr. told a reporter the
vole indicated that the Democrats
have failed to develop a vote-catch
ing farm issue they were counting
on to help win the White House
and Congress next November.
Ike's ('oattails
One Democratic farm leader,
Rep. W. R. Poage (Tex.) acknowl
edged the vote indicated that most
House members figured that
"Ike's coattails are the safest
place to be in this election year."
But he said "they will find out
differently come November."
Poage aimed his statements pri
marily at the farm state Repub
licans who voted for the bill last
Wednesday but reversed them
selves and supported the veto to
day. Only 20 Republicans voted to
override, although 18 had voted
for the measure originally.
Vote Tally
The 20 GOP members voting to
override were joined by 182 Dem
ocrats. Voting to uphold the veto
were 173 Republicans and 38 Dem
ocrats. Thirty-five Democrats had
voted against the bill last Wednes
day.
Martin said the vole showed
that "House members have faith
the President will give farmers
help in an orderly way without
building up surpluses."
Democratic leaders served no
tice that they plan to take credit
for the increase in supports. They
contended the President never
would have raised supports if they
had not pushed their- plan to re
store flat !)() per cent supports on
basic crops.
