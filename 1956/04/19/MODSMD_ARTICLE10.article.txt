# Self-Government Certain For Nigeria, Expert Says
## UN 						Commissioner of Cameroons Tells Bowman Audience It Will Happen in Next Few Years 
### 
Nigeria is ready for the self-government it's certain to get in the
next few years, Brigadier Edward J. Gibbons, UN Commissioner' of
the Cameroons, said yesterday.
Gibbons, who spoke at Bowman Alumni House, is an expert on
Nigeria. He has worked in Nigeria and other parts of British Africa

since 1929.
Nigeria lias a population of 31
million, over half (hat of British
Africa. Its people are almost en
tirely African with only a sprin
kling of Europeans, most of whom
are there for missionary work,
civil service, trade or research.
Great Britain assumed political
responsibility for Nigeria in 1900
and soon began the slow process
of preparing the country for mem
bership in the British Common
wealth, Gibbons said.
Nationhood
The job of assisting African
people lo nationhood has been
slow, ho noted. One of the main
problems has been social diver
gencies.
Nigeria eonta-ins a mixture of
Moslems, Christians and pagan
peoples, as well as diverse cli
mates. In the north the country is
often arid and merges into the
Sahara Oesert. Southern Nigeria
is mostly tropical fore,si area.
When the British came into Ni
geria they established a system
of local government based on in
digenous institutions Moslem
emirs in the north and village
confederations in the south, Gib
bons said. Since World War I
more and more Africans took po
sitions in government. Now only
a few British remain, and whether
those will leave will be derided at
a conference in London Ibis fall.
ICcoiiomit's
Nigeria's economic system is
mainly made up of subsistence
farming by peasant farmers and
local trade. Most of Nigeria's in
come stays at home, Gibbons said,
but she conducts a lucrative trade
with Britain and other European
count ries.
Communist influence in Nigeria
is slight. Only a few minor leaders
have Communist tendencies, he
said. "A line of propaganda for
totalitarianism makes them laugh.
They say. That's where we were
when we began and we don't want
to go back.' "
