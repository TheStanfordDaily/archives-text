# Some Sharing Needed
## 
### 
Nf.\\ STORACK REGULATIONS for WOtneil students
were released by the University Monday night
during house meetings.
These regulations provide that nothing other
than trunks and footloekers may he stored v\ith
the I Diversity over the summer. In other
words, Ih<* days are gone when women students
eon Id leave lamps, chairs, skis, hookeases and
other bulky, unerated items with the Univer
sity.
Vie sympathize with the Administration and
I In ir problems in providing spaee for the pos
sessions of nearly tN.'OO women students.
Nevertheless, we. think that it might be pos
sible to work out some system whereby women
students could leave items, too large to tie
packed into a normal-sized trunk, with the lirti
\ ersity.
If ilie University thinks this too expensive,
perbapr:oni. charge eonld be worked out. (ler
lainly, a plan like ibis would not be as expen
sive as storing items with commercial compa
nies over the summer or shipping them back
to (lie student's home would be.
Another possible point where the University
eonld .iiÂ» 1 women students in moving would be.

in arranging some sort of co-ordinated system
with local transfer companies.
If each woman is forced to provide for her
own transfer company every time she moves to
another residence, the end of each quarter will
see a melee of moving trucks popping up at
each residence dozen- of times eaeh day.
Also, the University might make clear
whether each student is required to have a stor
age company move her trunk or whether it is
possible for her to arrange to have someone not
connected with the University, such as her fa
ther or brother, move trunks for her.
We realize the University is growing and that
space for even the hare necessities, like dor
mitories, is becoming short. Nevertheless, it
should be possible lo make moving and storage
easier for the women students, particularly
since many more will be moving eaeh. quarter
ii the proposed housing policies go into ef
fect.
Expansion is no reason for the University lo
dump obligations it has assumed in the past
upon the shoulders of the student.
Some sharing of the responsibility should be
possible.
