# Fricker's Resignation
## 
### 
T.AS'r NIGHT THE ASSU lost one of it.> hardest
working members when Assistant to the Presi
dent Kric Fricker resigned.
The position of presidental assistant, is new
ami as the first student to (111 the oflice Fricker
carried the responsibility of proving that such
a position was needed.
He has shown it. a necessity, for without.
Fricker's work we wonder if this year's student
administration could have functioned in many
of its areas.
Fricker also carried into the new post a re
sponsibility for setting the pace and defining
the duties which his successors would follow.
Few student administrators will be able to
follow the pace set by Fricker. Even Fricker
himself found there was just too much to do if
he was to realize the full benefits of study at
Stanford.
It lias been the presidential assistant who has
carried the main burden during the present stu

dent administration. Flicker Ikih done much
of the work, and received too little of tlie credit.
It is extremely unfortunate that the Associ
ated Students must lose one of their most valu
able supporters simply because lie was so over
loaded with work, having too much concern
with too many details best handled by others.
Flicker has stood as a hard-to-follow exam
ple for others in the student leadership, giving
them quite a mark for which to shoot.
But his example was not followed often
enough; too much work seemed to be piled on
the shoulders of the presidential assistant. Had
this work been more wisely shared Eric Fricker
probably would not have had to leave his po
sition.
We are sorry to see such a hard worker leave
student government but we hope his loss will
at last show student administrators the neces
sity for a more thorough sharing of work and
responsibility.
