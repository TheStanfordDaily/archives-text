## Students Comment on U.S. Policy In Crucial Middle Eastern Dispute 
### DAVE SCOTT 
/ "\\ hat do you think the United States policy
toward the Arab-Israel dispute should be?"
Stanford students had this to say on the cru
cial problem:
( Iliff Kimber, '56, Thcta Chi: "America must
support Dag Hammarskjold efforts 011 this ques
tion. A peaceful settlement of this dispute must
he paramount to preserve the interests of 'the
1 nited S'ates and the rest of the world.
"Side-taking by the United States and ship
mcnt of arms to either or both would do nothing
but aggravate an already touchy situation. The
I .S. <fuust exercise firm leadership toward the
peaceful settlement of this question in order to
maintain its position as a leader in world af
fairs."
Karen Erickson, "58, Lagunita: "Squeezed
between the demon and the deep Fed sea, the
I nited States has tripped as lightly as possible
nwr this Ik ' «>f thorns by its move asking that
Dag be sent to 'get thr facts.'
"Su< !> a non-committal policy is not produc
tive ol action, but action is the last thing the
Middle Fast hot bed needs at the present time.
"By packing a brief case instead of a gun in
her Middle East wanderings, the United States
is attempting to show that neutrality pays.
\ctualU, ihe U.S. does appear to be almost
too naive in her attitude toward the Egyptian
premier. Howevrr, if we insist, on playing
the anxious, but innocent observer, what oth»<r
possible line can wc deliver in the Middle
East?"
(xaude Lavai,, '57, Alpha Sigma Phi: "1
think we should stav out of it as a nation. But

if Soviet support of the Arab Nations continues,
and if the United Nations can't neutralize the
condition, then we will be forced to act, whether
we want to or not."
Bob Pence, '59, Wilbur: "1 think we should
support Israel more than we are. If we leave
Israel alone, while Russia is supporting the
Arab states, Israel will go under. However, we
should find a way of helping Israel without get
ting into a war."
Dick. Reyna, "56, Alpha Sigma Phi: "We are
already committed to the side of Israel. But if
we arm Israel, and the Russians arm Egypt, the
stage is set for another Korea.
"The United Nations could set up a heavv
bonier patrol, amounting to an occupation of
the border, to keep Israel and the Arab nations
apart while things cool off."
Herbert Hyvians, '57, Off-Campus: "The
United States should al all costs retain the amity
of both sides in the dispute. This is important
in order to keep stability in the Middle East
and to keep our influence there strong.
"\\ e should supply neither side with arms.
Rather, we should offer our 'good offices' to
settle the dispute peaceably.
Don Brown, '57, Off-Cam pun: "The United
States should strive to create long-run Arab-
Israeli cooperation. Resettlement of refugees
and equitable settlement of the Jordan River
Pro ject are means to this end.
"Meanwhile, we should throw our support
behind any plan which will ease t<4isions—such
as UN mediation and avoidance of an arms
race." *'
