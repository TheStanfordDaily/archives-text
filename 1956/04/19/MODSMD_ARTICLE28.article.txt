a well-balanced starting five.
Dueling Boern for control of
the boards will l>e Sig center Paul
Perko. Also sure to be in the thick
of the action for Sigma Chi I are

fensive ace.
McGrath may face the task of
stopping the basket-happy Brodie.
Brodie laid in 16 points in Zete's
semi-final win.
The former All - PCC quarter
back is also an excellent team
player and, along with Tarr, sets
up Zete plays with sharp passes.

Sigma Chi 11, 34-26.
