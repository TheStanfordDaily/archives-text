WASHINGTON, April IX
(UP) Twelve nations, includ
ing flin United Slates and Rus
sia, today unanimously approv
er! a charier for a new interna
tional atomic energy agency to
develop peaceful aspects of
atomic energy.
The charter, worked out after
nearly two months of closed
door negotiations here, will be
presented to a full-scale inter
national "atoms-for-peace" con

ference in New York next Sep
tember.
!f adopted by the conference,
the new world body will come
into existence to carry out the
peaceful atomic program first
suggesterl by President. Eisen
hower.
Announcement of the 12-na
tion accord was made in a brief
communique. It said several del
egations reserved their positions
on some details. But it adrled

that "r'lll delegations voted in
favor of the statute hs h whole."
Kisenhower, in his atoms-for
peace proposal before the Unit
ed Nations Dee. K, 1953, pro
posed that world atomic power's
put n share of their fissionable
materials into an International
agency. The agency would act
as a "bank" and parcel out the
material for peacetime projects.
Informed sources have said
dur ing working meetings of the

12-nation group here thai the
final charter would include the
"atomic bank" idea. They said
both the United States and Rus
sia apparently agreed on that
point. <
Russia originally sought to
have the new atomic agency
closely linked to the LIN Secu
rity Council, where the Soviel
Union and other major powers
could exercise a veto over its
actions.

Sources close to the conferees
said during earlier meetings,
however, that Russia had drop
ped its insistence on that point.
The 12 nations are Australia,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech
oslovakia, France, India, Portu
gal. Union of South Africa, Rus
sia, Britain and United States.
Their representatives met in 18
sessions from Feb, 27 to today
to hammer out the charter, us
ing an American draft.
