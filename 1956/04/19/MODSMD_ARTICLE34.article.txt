# Brave Nine to Aim For Seventh Win
## 
### 
Ray Looney will probably be
on the mound this afternoon as
the Brave nine go in search of
their seventh victory of the year
when they tackle the visiting
Stockton College Mustangs.
Game time is 3:15 p.m. on the
Freshman 1 )iamond.
The Braves, led mainly by Ihe
powerful batting of third-baseman
Bobby Dwight and catcher Doug
Cami 1 1 i, should have a good
chance to knock off the Mustangs,
who are an unknown quantity.
Last time Looney hurled he pitch
ed a neat five-hitter to defeat Mo
desto Junior College.
