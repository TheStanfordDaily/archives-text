# Stolen Chappies Returned, To Be Sold on Quad Today
## 
### 
Better late than never, as the saying goes.
It appears that the Chappie will make its belated appearance
this morning. Yesterday afternoon, a heavily laden station wagon
was observed lurching its way to the Chappie office. In it were the
3500 wayward issues of the Chappie.
The magazines had spent the night in an "unidentified" house in
Menlo Park. Members of Hammer and Coffin, who publish the
rag . . . cr . . . mag, claim they spent the night hunting over the
surrounding countryside for the lost issues.
They were informed late yesterday of the hiding place. The
magazines were retrieved.
Ron Freund, editor in chief of the Chappie, says the humor sheet
will hit the stands at the usual time and at the usual places today.
Freund observes that Thursday is a poor day on Quad to sell the
magazine. He says he will wait to see how the sales go before he
decides whether or not to do murder on the persons of the Hammer
and Coffin neophytes.
