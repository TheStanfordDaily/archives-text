# Richards: Don't Confuse Party Labels with Goals
## Democratic Senatorial Candidate Speaks Out Against Defending South's Civil Rights Attitude 
### Wally Simpson 
"Democrats should not attempt to reconcile the unreconcilable,"
said Stale Senator Richard Richards, Democratic Candidate for
United States Senator from California, in a luncheon address yes
terday.
Speaking before northern Santa Clara Democratic leaders at tiie

a itauci a civ. inv-
Old Plantation, Richards said just
because one Democrat says some
thing is right doesn't mean it is.
"Party objectives, by and large,
are correct," he said. "But we
must not confuse the party label
with the goal itself."
Citing Senator Eastland <D-
Miss.) as an example Richards
said, "Eastland is a Democrat. His
background, however, on civil
rights issues is widely known. His
attitudes on civil rights are not
to be defended. I am not about to
defend them."
Richards attacked the Republi
can party on a few issues. There
are, he said, misconceptions on
where Republicans stand on civil
rights issues. Their platforms, he
said, are strong on civil rights,
but Republican legislators do little
in the way of civil rights legis
lation when they get into office.

A Fair Employment Practices
Commission bill was introduced
in the California State Senate by
Richards lust year. According to
Richards, the FEPC bill intro
duced by him and a similar one
which had been introduced into
and had cleared the Assembly
were both killed in a Senate com
mittee by a 5-4 vote. All five Re
publicans voted against them, he
said.
Every four years the Republi
cans seem to undergo h liberal
revolution, claimed Richards. Re
publicans, he said, say that the
Taft-Hartley Act should be amend
ed. But, said Richards, not one
Democrat sponsored amendment
was even given a committee hear
ing, while the Republican spon
sored amendments that did pass
only made the Taft-Hartley Act
more inequitable.
"The Taft-Hartley Act should
be repealed and a new. decent bill
should be enacted," Richards said.
Foreign Policy
Richards personally attacked
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles' policies as "inconsistant
and immature." Dulles' state
ments. Richards said, "have cre
ated confusion abroad. The gains
we had made in international
friendship at the beginning of the
Korean war are gains we have
lost out-right by the policies of the
last three years."

"Democrats should not attempt to reconcile the unreconcilable,"
said Stale Senator Richard Richards, Democratic Candidate for
United States Senator from California, in a luncheon address yes
terday.
Speaking before northern Santa Clara Democratic leaders at tiie

a itauci a civ. inv-
Old Plantation, Richards said just
because one Democrat says some
thing is right doesn't mean it is.
"Party objectives, by and large,
are correct," he said. "But we
must not confuse the party label
with the goal itself."
Citing Senator Eastland <D-
Miss.) as an example Richards
said, "Eastland is a Democrat. His
background, however, on civil
rights issues is widely known. His
attitudes on civil rights are not
to be defended. I am not about to
defend them."
Richards attacked the Republi
can party on a few issues. There
are, he said, misconceptions on
where Republicans stand on civil
rights issues. Their platforms, he
said, are strong on civil rights,
but Republican legislators do little
in the way of civil rights legis
lation when they get into office.
Fi;PC Hills
A Fair Employment Practices
Commission bill was introduced
in the California State Senate by
Richards lust year. According to
Richards, the FEPC bill intro
duced by him and a similar one
which had been introduced into
and had cleared the Assembly
were both killed in a Senate com
mittee by a 5-4 vote. All five Re
publicans voted against them, he
said.
Every four years the Republi
cans seem to undergo h liberal
revolution, claimed Richards. Re
publicans, he said, say that the
Taft-Hartley Act should be amend
ed. But, said Richards, not one
Democrat sponsored amendment
was even given a committee hear
ing, while the Republican spon
sored amendments that did pass
only made the Taft-Hartley Act
more inequitable.
"The Taft-Hartley Act should
be repealed and a new. decent bill
should be enacted," Richards said.
Foreign Policy
Richards personally attacked
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles' policies as "inconsistant
and immature." Dulles' state
ments. Richards said, "have cre
ated confusion abroad. The gains
we had made in international
friendship at the beginning of the
Korean war are gains we have
lost out-right by the policies of the
last three years."
