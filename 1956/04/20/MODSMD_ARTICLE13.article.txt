# Missing Bawlout Holds Up Quad
## 
### 
Quad distribution may be held
up this spring, according to
Quad officials. Production can't
continue until a certain marked
Bawlout is found. ,
The Bawlorit is one of three
which Quad editors were using
to compile the index for the
Quad. When last seen it was
being delivered to a woman at
liussell House who promised to
give it to Lucretia Moore.
Miss Moore did not receive it
and the Quad staff member who
took the book to Russell can't
remember to whom she gave it.
Will someone find the Bawl
out so the Quad can finish their
work?
