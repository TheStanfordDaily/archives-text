NIKOLAI AM) NIKITA have come to call on the
good Sir Anthony ami his people.
How things have changed. No more do we
the black-bearded revolutionaries with a
bomb in c 'ie hand and the Communist Mani
festo in the oilier. This new brand of red leader
lias suddenly become the polished world-travel
ing diplomat.
\\ e are not certain what all this means, but

in any case it's nice to see a smile from our
Soviet friends for a change.
And whenever Mr. Eden's guests can tear
themselves away perhaps I hey would pay a visit
to old Uncle Sam.
But first we hope that Sir Anthony would
search that luggage. Somehow we feel it might
contain a little bomb and a certain book.
Things haven't changed that much.
