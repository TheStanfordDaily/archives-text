# Medical School Unveils 'Cancer Gun'
## Long Research Went Into Linear Electron Accelerator Machine 
### 
The long-awaited "cancer gun"
was unveiled yesterday at Stan
ford Medical School in San Fran
cisco.
The six-million-volt, six-foot ma
chine is a linear electron acceler
ator, baby brother of the massive
220-fooMong atom smasher locat
ed on campus. Construction of the
junior-size medical version took
more than lour years of intensive
research and development by mi
crowave scientists.
Though in operation only a few
weeks and still undergoing oper
ational tests, the medical linear
accelerator already is treating se
lected cancer patients on a limited
capacity schedule.
"It is still much too early for an
appraisal of the machine's ulti
mate value in radiation therapy of
cancer," said Dr. Henry S. Kaplan,
head of the Radiology Depart
ment. "However, its performance
so far is both clinically and tech
nically gratifying."
The six-million-volt beam of
electrons, converted to high en
ergy X-rays, is expected to de
s t r o y cancerous growths deep
within the body. Medical scientists
hope it will accomplish this with
minimal damage â€” compared to
conventional X-rays to outer lay
ers of skin.
"It will be five to ten years be
fore we can tell with certainty
whether the new accelerator pro
vides a significant improvement
in this type of treatment," said
Dr. Kaplan.
Medical reports in the past have
indicated that the high energy X
iays make no distinction between
bone, muscle and fat as do "soft
er" conventional X-rays. The high
energy rays penetrate all three
wiih about equal ease. Thus bone
is less likely to be damaged by
radiation absorption during treat
ment of nearby tissues, and the
target area will show no untreat
ed "bone shadows."
