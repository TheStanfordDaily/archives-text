# Spring Show Choreographer Explains How He Does Job
## 
### 
While watching dancers run through intricate steps, many ques
tions come to mind. How does the choreographer create the dances so
they correspond to the music? What makes a good choreographer?
"A choreographer needs to have both the experience of dancing and
the feeling of how to combine the steps he knows and tlie ability of

his dancers with the music," says
Bill Davis, choreographer for the
forthcoming Stanford production
of "Wonderful Town."
In planning the steps for "Won
derful Town," Davis listened to
i the music on tape. He says the
I tape has full orchestration ■ — a
great advantage.
As he listens to the music, he
i forms a general idea of the mood
or type of steps he will use—slow
: and "slinky" for a tango, or fast
i and jerky for a Charleston.
"In the ballet numher, I started
on the floor plan with the posi
tions of the dancers in mind and
then worked-in the steps, whereas
for the ragtime, which is rhyth
mic, I started with the steps and
moved the dancers around into a
pattern."
Once he has the steps worked
out and has chosen the cast, he
begins molding the dancers to the
choreography. "Molding" is the
word used because the director,
when choosing people from try
outs, looks for their quality of
movement and mentally categori
alized them as to the type of danc
ing they are most suited for.
"In most of the dances we have
a featured group with dancers
suitable for Ihat type of song,
i supported by background dancers.
Different combinations of dancers
are used in each of the featured
spots," says Davis.
The dancing in "Wonderful
Town" is all quite modern with
! variations on the jazz rhythm.
The opening number is a semi
! ballet, fairly rapid with a lot of
pantomime, according to the cho
reographer. The dancers freeze in
their positions at several times
during the song, at which inter
vals short pantomimes are enact
' ed by the Greenwich Villagers.
