# Stanford Tennis Team Entertains Bruin Racketmen And Southern California's Defending Titleholders
## Renker Hangs Hopes For Indian Victory On Frost, Douglas 
### Dave Canfield 
A victory over last year's
NCAA eha'mpions is what Tennis
Coach Bob Renker will be count
ing on today at 1 p.m. when the
Indian notrnen host Southern Cal
ifornia.
"We should beat USC," predict
ed Renker. "They are weak at
number live and six singles and
we are strong there. They won
two close doubles matches in our
last match with them, and up here
those two matches should go the
other way."
After battling USC today, the
Card racqueteers will take to the
varsity courts tomorrow at 1 p.m.
against UCLA. The Indians will
be out to avenge an early-season
8-1 defeat.
Frost In Form
Jack Frost, Stanford's former
national j un i or champion who
was once ranked 13th nationally,
is back in form after a leg injury,
according to Renker.
The Monterey showboat will
battle his old USC rival, Mexican
Davis Cupper Pancho Contreras,
this afternoon in the number two
singles showdown.
In the first singles match, Jack
Douglas will play Afex Olmedo.
The hard-luck kid from Santa
Monica held a match point on
Olmedo in the third set of their
early season match but lost out.
Douglas' three-set loss to Ol
medo preceded two more heart
breaking marathon defeats to top
rivals Mike Franks of UCLA and
Rir/zie Summers of Cal.
Franks-Douglas Rivalry
Saturday the sophomore star
will try for a revenge win over
Franks. The Franks-Douglas ri
valry dates back to when the two
netters were battling for the Na
tional Junior Championship.
On different occasions each was
favored to win the meet but nei
ther ever took it. Each year a
darkhorse, like UCLA's number
three man, Johnny Lesch. or
Frost, copped the crown.
Farlier in the season in West
wood, Douglas carried Franks to
three sets. Like the Douglas-
Franks tussle, the second singles
duel Saturday between Frost and
Mike Green may turn into a
grudge match.
Frost hoped for a spot on the
Davis Cup team two years ago
but Green beat him out.

this afternoon in the number two
singles showdown.
In the first singles match, Jack
Douglas will play Afex Olmedo.
The hard-luck kid from Santa
Monica held a match point on
Olmedo in the third set of their
early season match but lost out.
Douglas' three-set loss to Ol
medo preceded two more heart
breaking marathon defeats to top
rivals Mike Franks of UCLA and
Rir/zie Summers of Cal.
Franks-Douglas Rivalry
Saturday the sophomore star
will try for a revenge win over
Franks. The Franks-Douglas ri
valry dates back to when the two
netters were battling for the Na
tional Junior Championship.
On different occasions each was
favored to win the meet but nei
ther ever took it. Each year a
darkhorse, like UCLA's number
three man, Johnny Lesch. or
Frost, copped the crown.
Farlier in the season in West
wood, Douglas carried Franks to
three sets. Like the Douglas-
Franks tussle, the second singles
duel Saturday between Frost and
Mike Green may turn into a
grudge match.
Frost hoped for a spot on the
Davis Cup team two years ago
but Green beat him out.
