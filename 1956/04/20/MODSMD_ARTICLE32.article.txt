Sigma Chi ended the three-year
dynasty of the Zete intramural
basketball team last night with a
decisive 52-44 victory over the de
fending champions.
The Zete quintet had won every
All-University title since 1952,
when they lost to Fiji in the fi
nals.
Sigma Chi was forced lo battle
from behind as the Zetes jumped
off to an early 5-0 lead. After
trailing by a 7-1 margin later in
the initial quarter, the Sigs closed
the gap to 9-7.
John Hendricks began the sec
ond quarter with a 20-foot jump
shot and a fast break lay-up to
give the Sigs a lead they never re
linquished.
Hendricks and Jerry Gustafson
paced the well-balanced Sig scor
ing attack. Hendricks tallied 13
points, Gustafson netted 10, Ben
Heirs potted nine and Gunnar
Christiansen hit seven.
Guards John Brodie and Bill
Tarr were the Zetes' top scorers.
Brodie sank 12, Tarr netted 11
and Eric Wittenberg added nine
more for the losers.
Gustafson, Jack McGrath and
Paul Perko outmuscled the rug
ged Zetes on the boards. With
Hendricks, Heirs and Kenny Seese
gunning from the outside and the
tall trio scoring underneath, the

I Sigs proved 100 balanced for the
j upper row quintet.
Sigma Chi ledL 24-lti, at half
j time and ran up a '11-25 score early
in the fourth qifcirter for their
biggest lead. ,
Following the fihials. The Daily
picked the first annual All-Intra
mural Tourrtamient basketball
team. The cagers were
named to the quintet:
F —Jerry Gtist;#fson (Sig I)
F —Dick Farmiiki (l)elt I)
(' —Jack McGrattli (Sig I)
G—John BrodieJ (Zete I)
G —YVally Oates! (Sig II)
Gustafson was tlie outstanding
eager on the court In last night's
final. His sharp-shotting and hus
tle made the difference. McGrath
was probably the beist defensive
player in the tourney and reboun
ded excellently.
Brodie was the Zones' chief of
fensive threat and was always in
the right place at tl*e right time.
Oates and Farman paced their
teams to the semi-firtals.
