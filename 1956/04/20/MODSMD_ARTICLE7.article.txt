# Future Plans Of Model UN Told LASSU
## Stanford Will Host Next Year's Meeting If Housing Available 
### 
The problems and long-range
plans for holding next year's Mod
el United Nations on the Stanford
campus were explained to Legis
lature Wednesday night.
Tentative plans had been marie
at this year's conference at Ore
gon State College to hold the
next session here pending approv
al from the University and Legis
lature.
The student legislators withheld
approval of the scheme until the
Model United Nations steering
committee could solve the riddle
of how to feed and house the 800
delegates expected to attend.
Won by Default
Chairman of this year's delega
tion, Chuck Reynolds, said the rea
son the Stanford group agreed to
host the conference was that no
other university wanted the job.
Student Financial Manager Bill
Tooley was authorized to work
with the University to change or
modify a provision which prohib
its any campus organization from
keeping proceeds from benefit
performances.
Ski Club President Leon Nelson
explained the problems faced by
groups such as Ski Club which are
not financed by the University
and yet are legally prohibited
from making money from public
performances.
Walt Hays and Kay Thomas
were approved as next year's For
eign Scholarship Committee co
chairmen.
Men's Council
Instead of providing for the
election of a Men's Council repre
sentative to complete the term of
Jerry Fuller, who will not return
next year, Legislature voted to
appoint the new member, prefera
bly from among the incumbents.
A newly-formed Irish Republi
can Club submitted its constitu
tion to Legislature, but the body
became curious as to the purposes
and nature of the organization,
and tabled the matter until fur
ther information could be gained.
Legislature also approved next
year's student financial manager,
Bill Mathewson, as assistant man
ager for the rest of this year.
It approved by-laws for Rally
Committee and Cardinals and ap
propriated $45 to replace the old
banner which ripped during last
week's winds.
