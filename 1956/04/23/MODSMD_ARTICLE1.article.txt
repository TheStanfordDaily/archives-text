## U.S. Colonel Claims Egyptians Mistaken In Bomber Incident 
### 
TEHRAN, Iran, April 22 (UP> —
The pilot of a U.S. military trans
port forced down by Egyptian jet
fighters denied today he was fly
ing over a prohibited military zone
when the incident occurred.
Col. Jesse L. Hardin, of Panama
City, Fla., made his firm denial in
a statement Issued by the U.S.
Embassy here.
Hardin was piloting an army
C-47 when it was forced down by
Egyptian jets while on a flight
from Tehran to Cairo April 14
with 21 persons'aboard. The U.S.
transport was carrying members
of the U.S. military mission in
Tehran and their wives on a tour
ist junket.
Denies Charge
The Egyptians charged that the
plane was flying over a secret
military base. But the pilot's
statement today said he was not
over or anywhere near a prohibit
ed zone when the Egyptian jets
forced him to land at Fayid Air
port.
Hardin said he was in touch
with the Cairo air traffic control
tower when one of the Egyptian
jets, lowering its wheels to slow
it down to the speed of the lumber
ing C-17, came alongside.
The pilot motioned to Hardin to
follow him down. The C-47 was
then over port and eventually was
brought in to land at Fayid Air
port.
Prohibited Zone?
At the airport, Hardin said,
Egyptian officials including an
air force general, accused him of
violating a prohibited zone. The
embassy statement said Hardin
showed the Egyptians his flight
log and pointed out it would have
been impossible for the C-47, on
its plotted course to-go near a pro
hibited area.
Four crew members and 17 pas
sengers were treated with court
esy by Egyptian personnel at
Fayid, the statement said. Some
of the passengers had complained
yesterday they had been handled
roughly at the Egyptian base.
Hardin said he was allowed to
continue to Cairo Airport, where
two Egyptian army officers asked
permission to search the plane for
any films taken from the air. They
found nothing and permitted the
passengers and crew to leave, the
statement said.

port.
Prohibited Zone?
At the airport, Hardin said,
Egyptian officials including an
air force general, accused him of
violating a prohibited zone. The
embassy statement said Hardin
showed the Egyptians his flight
log and pointed out it would have
been impossible for the C-47, on
its plotted course to-go near a pro
hibited area.
Four crew members and 17 pas
sengers were treated with court
esy by Egyptian personnel at
Fayid, the statement said. Some
of the passengers had complained
yesterday they had been handled
roughly at the Egyptian base.
Hardin said he was allowed to
continue to Cairo Airport, where
two Egyptian army officers asked
permission to search the plane for
any films taken from the air. They
found nothing and permitted the
passengers and crew to leave, the
statement said.
