# Bulganin Hints Good Will Visit To U.S. Soon
## Hostile Mob Stages Protest March Against Visiting Soviet Chiefs 
### 
LONDON, April 22 (UP)â€”Pre
mier Nikolai Bulganin and Com
munist Chief Nikita Khrushchev
would like to visit the United
States after (his year's president
tial elections, Soviet sources said
today.
The Soviet hint was dropped as
more than 20,000 Iron Curtain ref
ugees staged a silent march
through London today to protest
the presence in Britain of the So
viet leaders.
The Soviet leaders did not sec
the solemn parade, carried out in
orderly fashion under the anxious
eyes of strong police reinforce
ments.
Bulganin and Khruschev con
tinued their "little summit" talks
with Prime Minister Anthony
Eden at Eden's country residence
and then went to Windsor Castle
for tea with Queen Elizabeth.
They presented the Queen a lux
urious sable fur wrap.
Second Demons!ration
The Soviet chiefs returned to
London tonight for a county coun
cil reception long after the protest
marching was over.
But the Soviet chiefs were
greeted outside the County Hall
building by a new hostile demon
stration. As they entered the
building several hundred demon
strators marched outside, chant
ing: "the Reds, the Reds, we've
got to get rid of the Reds" and
"down with Communism." Mount
ed and foot police scattered the
demonstrators.
Bulganin, in a brief speech at
the County Hall, admitted many
difficulties in the talks with the
British leaders.
"On the basis of our negotia
tions so far, I can say that each
side wants the talks to end satis
factorily. That is absolutely
clear," he said. "But we have to
overcome many difficulties."
Seek U.S. Visit
The Moscow leaders, far from
dismayed at their unenthusiastic
British reception, were hoping for
a similar visit to the United States
to push their "co-existence" cam
paign, Soviet sources said.
Soviet sources said Bulganin
and Khrushchev look on their
stay in Britain as only the first
stage in a campaign to woo the
West over to friendship with Rus
sia. They were hoping a U.S. visit
could be fixed up after the end of
the American electorlal campaign.
Diplomats here, believed
though, that President Eisen
hower's speech to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors was
a clear warning that the Soviets
would have to show more basic
policy changes before any invita
tion could be expected.
They pointed out the President's
words fully backed Eden's warn
ings to the Soviets that "deeds
rather Than words" arc necessary
to end the cold war.
Bulganin and Khruschev met
with Eden and other British gov
ernment leaders at Eden's country
estate this morning on the fourth
day of their talks. The talks lasted
two hours and were followed by
lunch, attended also by a delega
tion of socialist opposition lead
ers headed by Party Chief Hugh
Gaitskell.
"Informal" talks then continued
on the terrace with the socialist
delegates taking part.
