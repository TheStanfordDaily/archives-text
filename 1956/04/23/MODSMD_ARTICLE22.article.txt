# Is It 'Going to Hell'?

\o vvo\der student government is going to
lu 11. No one is interested." Election Board
(hairinan (ihtuk Falkner made this statement
last week when few candidates Itad filed nomi
nation slips.
Saturday night after the nominations closed,
l .ilkner seconded his earlier statement with,
"Student government has gone to hell."
Falkner deserves commendations. The ASS 11
and class offices nominations this year have
reached an all-time high in apathy.
In last year's nominations, 114 students filed.
At closing time Friday for this year's nomina
tions, only 55 candidates hat! been ambitious
enough merely to get 15 names on a petition.
East year every office was contested. Eight
offices will go uncontested this year, anil for
two positions no candidate filed.
How can Stanford enjoy efficient student gov
ernment when talking 15 people into signing
a petition is all candidates have to do to obtain
' important posts like junior class business man
ager, men's row rep/-tentative, off-campus rep
resentative, row representative, president of
W omens' Recreation Association and head yell
leader?

The number of candidates this year ranks the |
lowest since only 46 file<! in 1940.
Ih apathy in student government harmful be-j
cause it develops apathetic citizens later on or
is it heneliciul because it indicates Stanford lias
few "reel-hots/'
"Red-hot" is, of course, an unfortunate term.
"Red-hot*" like the Eric Frickers, Hill Toolevs
and Chuck Falkners of today may become the
Dwight D. Eisenhowers of tomorrow.
rÂ» .
Eisenhower went to West Point. If he had
attended Stanford in 191)6 instead of West Point
way hack when, the present President might
have heen labeled as that most vile of students, j
most vulvar and despicable of men, a "red-hot." |
High in his classscholastically and one of the
campus's athletic and student leaders, "Ike" 1
impressed his fellow students with his enthusi
astic attitude.
From the number of students who filed peti
tions last week, there seem to he few potential
Dwight IJ. Eisenhowers at Stanford. Let's hope
apathy in student government isn't as much of
a problem at other universities as it is at Stan
fort I
If it is, our future national government may
just "go to hell," too.
