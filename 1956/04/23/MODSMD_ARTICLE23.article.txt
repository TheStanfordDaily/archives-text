# The
						Responsibility of '59
## 
### 
WE aki PROUD of today's Daily and we think our
readers will share the feeling after a look
through this Frosh Edition.
The Daily is slill guided by the theory that
a college newspaper is not a mere bulletin
board, or an organ of a student government; but
that its function is that of a supplement to n
i-ludent's education.
It offers the prime opportunity to see the im
plications of today's news today before it goes
lo reM in tomorrow's history texts.
More than this a college newspaper offers
something which no other publication can pre
sent comment from the group which is in the
process of forming the ideals which will guide
tomorrow's world. It requires some intellectual
probing to answer the opinions and comment of
a fellow student and the newspaper supplies
I he sounding hoard for that probing, an invalu
able tool of the educational process.
This then is the Daily's responsibility. We
are constantly seeking to utilize our limited tal
ent* toward the goals expressed in this obliga
l ion to our readers.

Today we turn over this responsibility to the
class of '59 who have earned the opportunity
through their skill and devoted efforts (or the
Daily's readers.
Our special appreciation is due Dave Can
field, who is acting as editor and who wrote to
day's lead editorial. Look over the others in the
stafl' listing and you will see tomorrow's cus
todians of The Stanford Daily with its right of
independence, nurtured in Stanford's air of
freedom— a right which makes possible our
functions of informing and stimulating the stu
dent.
This is a right to be jealously guarded, and
one which more and more college publications
are losing in the rush toward forcing intellec
tualism into the straight jacket of collective se
curity.
We are gratified in our realization that some
day soon today's freshmen will have the oppor
tunity to carry the Daily's purposes to a higher
level than we can ever reach.

Daily Editorial Hoard
