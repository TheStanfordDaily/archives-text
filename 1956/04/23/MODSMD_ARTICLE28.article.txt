# Film Relates Alcoholic Fate

### Stew Toy 
"T'li Cry Tomorrow," inebriated
epic of neurotic disintegration,
proves once again that alcohol and
alcohol don't mix.
The movie of singer Lillian
Roth's progression from obscurity
to fame to obscurity, now playing
at the Varsity Theatre, plays on
the public's insatiable fascination
for drunkenness and stardom.
As a study of inebriation the
film is indeed fascinating. Susan
Hay ward, who portrays Miss
Roth, is convincingly dissolute
and shows in a few realistic scenes
that she can act, after all.
The plot is a simple one, shown
by its many prototypes to be a
sure money-maker.
NfMirotic Pushing
Lillian Roth, through her moth
er's neurotic pushing, has tried
since she was a small tyke to
break into the wonderful game of
show business.
She gets a few small child parts
which grow overnight into star
ring movie roles. Her name is in
lights and she is a Star.
While stardom is her mother's
final goal for her in life, Miss
Roth complicates things by falling
in love with a childhood boy-friend
and announcing that a career as
Wife is good enough for her.
Her mother, looking out for Lil
lian's best interests, understand
ably blows up.
I.over Dies
But even when her boy friend
dies, Lillian refuses to give him
up. She takes to drink and mar
ries a few times, identifying her
various husbands with her first,
last and only love.
A well-done but interminable
nightmare of drunkenness fol
lows, but its convincingness is ef
fective propaganda for the WCTIJ.
The hero of story is Eddie
Albert., Alcoholic Anonymous and
his usual disgusting self. He and
his AA friends save Miss Roth
from a life of degradation and
shame.
They ride off into the sunset of
NBC's Hollywood television stu
dios for a heart-rending appear
ance on "This Is Your Life" and
a New Life together.
