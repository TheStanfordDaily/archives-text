# Surgeons Use Artificial Heart-Lung in Operation
## University Medics Save Life of Alameda Girl By Application of Professor Osborn's Device 
### 
University surgeons, using an artificial heart-lung machine of
improved design, have repaired a crucial defect inside the heart of
an eight-year-old girl, the University announced Friday.
Melody Merritt of Alameda had a hole in the wall separating her
two heart ventricles. The hole prevented Melody's heart from pump-

ing blood at a normal rate and
made her a semi-invalid. In a few
years, experts estimated, her
heart deficiency might have taken
her lile.
Incurable Defect
Such a defect had been incura
ble until John J. Osborn, Stan
lord professor of medicine, devel
oped the heart-lung machine. The
machine took the place of Mel
ody's heart and lungs for 17. min
utes.
While her blood was shunted
through the artificial organ, sur
geons opened the right ventricle
of the now-empty heart. Within 15
minutes th e y had sutured the
opening between the two pumping
chambers and closed up the heart
again.
The artificial heart • lung was
then disconnected from the blood
stream. Soon the young heart

again began to pump its own
blood.
Other Centers
A few other medical centers
throughout the world have car
ried out successful operations
with heart-lung machines. But a
major hazard has continued to be
the danger of injuring blood cells.
In Stanford's heart-lung opera
tion the blood has shown no evi
dence of damage. The surgeons
praised the machine and pronoun
ced Melody's operation a complete
success.
Osborn spent four years of re
search and $3000 on his heart
lung machine. Equally as impor
tant as the machine, Osborn em
phasized,, is the surgical team
trained to use it.
The surgeons who operated on
the Merritt youngster asked that
their names not go into print.
