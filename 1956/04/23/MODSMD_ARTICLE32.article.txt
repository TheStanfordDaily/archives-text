inning was the fourth, when three
runs romped across the plate, two
of them on a booming triple off
the left-field bank by starting
pitcher Walt Payne. Payne stroll
ed in with the third score on A 1
Shaw's line single.
Payne continued without a care
until the Bruins came to bat in
the sixth inning. Three singles,
wrapped around a two-bagger by
first-baseman Billy Cox, produced
the first run.
Throwing as hard as he could,
Payne struck out the side. Mean
while, two runs walked in. Bob
Mesa rapped in the last of the
four tallies in the inning.
