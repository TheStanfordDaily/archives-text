April 22 (UP) Israeli Premier
David Ben-Gurion warned today
that the danger of war between
Israel and its Arab neighbors is
increasing despite Iho ceasefire
on the Egyptian border.
UN Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold last week won
agreement from Egypt and Israel
to observe a ceasefire along their
troubled frontiers. The UN peace
missionary is seeking to arrange
similar agreements between Israel
and Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
Ben-Gurion, speaking during a
tax debate in the Knesset (Parlia
ment >, warned that the danger of
full-scale war in the Middle East
had not been diminished by the
ceasefire.
"The only way of averting war
is tho immediate dispatch of arms
to this country," the fiery white
haired Israeli Premier declared.
He emphatically rejected the
suggestion of armed American
and British intervention in the
event all-out war exploded in the
Middle East.
"External military intervention
entails a grave danger to world
peace," he said.
Ben-Gurion pledged Israel would
respect the armistice agreements
as long as the Arab nations do so.
"To our regret, this has not
boon the attitude of our neigh
bors." he said. "The agreements
they have signed in the past have
been nothing more than scraps of
paper."
Ben-Gurion said that since tlie
end of the Palestine war the Arab
states "have not ceased either
openly or secretly to prepare for
a second round."
