## Four ASSU Candidates Open Primary Campaigns In Toyon Lobby Speeches Bosworth, Freelen, Coshow, Duke Outline Student Government Plans 
### 
Speaking before 60 persons last night in the Toyon Lobby, four of
the six candidates for ASSU offices gave their campaign platforms.
'I wo of the three aspirants for the office of ASSU president were
present, one of the two for vice-president, and the one head yell leader
candidate.
Bob Freelen and Arthur Bosworth spoke for the office of president;

Sue Coshow, vice-president and
Bill Duke, head yell leader.
Presidential aspirant Bart Hoo
ley and vice-presidential hopeful
Jack Mearns were not present.
Electfon Board Chairman Chuck
Falkner introduced the speakers
and acted as moderator.
Biz Manager
Bob Freelen listed his qualifica
tions as junior class business man
ager and assistant to the student
financial manager. His platform
consists of three main divisions.
lie spoke first of the ASSU Leg
islature. He said he would like to
see the legislative body broken
down into subcommittees and
that Legislature members should
hold meetings with their constitu
ents at weekly house meetings.
Freelen also suggested Legisla
ture hold a retreat at the begin
ning of the academic year next
autumn quarter for the purpose of
"getting acquainted with each
other."
Election Change
Second point in his platform
was the need for a change in the
election system. He advocates a
program where nominations
would be held during dead week
of winter quarter since campaign
ing is not allowed during this time
anyway.
Freelen's third point was to es
tablish a liaison between the stu
dents and the dean of student's
office. In connection with this he
advocates a benefit concert for
University libraries with the pro
ceeds going for books, general im
provements and an undergraduate
library.
Bosworth spoke next. He struck
out il campus apathy in student
and national affairs.
"The individual has no place on
this campus;" said Bosworth. "he
is put down every time he tries to
rise."
Opinion Polls
He would make use of public
opinion pblls to determine what
the students want in the way of
legislation.
His platform would include the
broadening of campus activities
and religious activity on the cam
pus. Bosworth would like to make
a reevaluation of women's regula
tions, particularly one dealing
with required attendance at house
meetings. He said it should be on
a voluntary basis.
Bosworth added that he believed
that too much emphasis in the
Frosh Handbook is placed on
Rally Com. the Axe and other
such "red-hot" activities.
If elected he would work closely
with The Daily in accomplishing
his aims.
Education
Vice-President aspirant Sue Cu
show was the third speaker. Her I
campaign consisted of two points
- educating the social chairmen
of regulations and violations of
the now social code and using the
Social Coordinating Board as a
sounding board in feeling out in
terest in such activities as Con
Home Week and Back to the Farm
Week.
Bill Duke, the only candidate
seeking the job of head yell lead
er, spoke last. His reason for
campaigning for an office which
is virtually his is to meet people
on the campus and get their ideas
on yell leading.
Duke considers the head yell
leader as "the middle man be
tween the football team and the
cheering section. They're just not
a bunch of gorillas running
around on a field of grass," he
quipped.
