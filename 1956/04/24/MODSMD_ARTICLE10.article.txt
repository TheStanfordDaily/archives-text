## Denies Demo Charges That Foreign Policy Has Been Negative 
### 
NEW YORK, April 23 (UP)â€”
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles called today for the expan
sion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization into a political and
economic force as well as a mili
tary bulwark against Commu
nism.
. . The time has come to ad
vance NATO from its initial phase
into the totality of its meaning,"
Dulles said in a major foreign
policy address.
Further Development
". . . The time has, I believe,
come to consider whether its or
ganization does not need to be
further developed, if it is ade
quately to serve the needs of this
and coming generations.
"If that be the common desire
of the NATO member nations, the
United States will join eagerly in
exploring the possibilities which
now beckon us forward."
Dulles did not detail his ideas
on a closer NATO union. But he
made it clear the U.S. does not en
vision a complete federation.
Rather, he appeared to favor a
system in which each nation
would keep a large measure of
independence in foreign and do
mestic affairs.
. Moral Bulwark
He predicted the second post
war decade would mark a new
phase in the struggle between the
forces of Soviet despotism and
Western freedom and hailed the
West's "moral bulwarks" that
have subjected Russian and Chi
nese Reds to "a kind of moral,
social and to some extent, eco
nomic ostracism."
Dulles denied Democratic char
ges he had conducted a "nega
tive" foreign policy and said "deep
satisfaction" could be taken from
the fact that "we can today see
within Russia some signs of light
which could mark the dawning of
(a) new day."
