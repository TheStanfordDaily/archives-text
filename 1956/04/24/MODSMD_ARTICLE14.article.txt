LONDON, April 23 (UP> Soviet Communist chief Nikita Khrush
chev warned the West today that Russia "very soon" will have an
intercontinental guided missile with an H-bomb warhead capable of
hitting "any point in the world."
In a blunt off-the-cuff speech at Birmingham, Khrushchev claimed

that Russia leads the world in hy-,
drogen bomb developments. He
said the Soviets have exploded an
H-bomb from a plane while the
Americans have done so only on
the ground.
Khrushchev, pushing a Soviet
campaign for trade with the West,
alsf) boasted that Russia's arms I
drive cannot be halted by any ;
Western ban on strategic exports
to the Soviets.
The Soviet leader stunned an
audience of British civic and busi
ness leaders with his unscheduled I
speech boasting of Russia's arms
prowess.
"Great stress is being laid on .
Kuift e d missiles," Khrushchev
said. "We can compete there, too.
I am quite sure we will have very
soon a guided missile with a hy
drogen bomb warhead which could
hit any point in the world."
"And in spite of that," he arlded,
"you do not want to trade with
us." *
Khrushchev also claimed Russia
is at least equal, if not ahead of
the West in plane production.
