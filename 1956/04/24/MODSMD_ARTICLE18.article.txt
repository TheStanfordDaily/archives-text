# Court Invalidates State Bus Segregation Laws
## Upsets Thirteen Southern Stale Racial Statutes 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 23 (UP)
—The Supremo Court today in ef
fect overturned state laws requir
ing segregation on buses.
At the same time it indirectly
rebuked South Carolinians whV)
brought a bus segregation case
before the court. It implied they
had "needlessly" wasted the tribu
nal's time by trying to get sup
port for segregation.
The action came in a brief unan
imous decision turning down an
appeal from a lower court deci
sion banning South Carolina's bus
segregation law as unconstitution
al. It was issued last July by the
fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals.
Doesn't Apply
The high court move does not
necessarily mean an immediate
end to segregated seating on
Southern buses. The case involved
did not bear directly on the vie lit
of privately owned transportation
companies, operating within a
state, to have segregation rules of
thier own.
Today's case was begun by Sa
rah Mae Flomming, a Negro who
was put off a bus in Columbia,
S.C., because she took a seat in
the section reserved for white pas
sengers. She sued for $25,000 d'im
ages.
The ban on intrastate bus segre
gation came in years after the
Supreme Court struck down com
pulsory separation of the race by
state law in buses crossing state
lines.
Doctrine End
The Interstate Commerce Com
mission last Nov. 26 issued an
order ending segregation on in
terstate trains and buses and in
waiting rooms used by interstate
travelers.
The various court and ICC ;><•
tions mark the end of the doctrine
of "separate but equal" aceommo
dations in the transportation field.
Thirteen states have laws that
require segregation in tranj por
tation wilhin their holders: Ala
bama. Georgia, the Carolinas, Mis
sissippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkan
sas, Florida, Kentucky, Oklaho
ma, Tennessee and Virginia.
