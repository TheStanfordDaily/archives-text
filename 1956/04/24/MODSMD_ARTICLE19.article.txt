# "We're Letting the United Nations Stay, But We're Warning Them"
## The 						Ladies on the Far Right 
### 
nf.w.s ITEM: The Daughters of the American
Revolution held their 65th annual convention
in \\ ashington, D.C., last week.
As usual the so very patriotic group pushed
their "America for the Americans"' line—this
lime they renewed their support of the McCar
ran-W alter Immigration Act which would limit
immigration to the United States mainly to
those of Northern European origin (where, in
cidentally, there are few interested in coming
to the U.S.).
One of the members voiced the reason behind
Mich support —and was loudly applauded by
the delegates. Said she: "If we take in too
much of varying philosophies, America will be
gone."
This one bare statement shows the real pur
pose behind the DAR—not to protect the de
mocracy on which the United States is built,
but to protect America itself in a grand isola
tion which would separate the world from its
democratic leader.
It is a pitiful fact that such flag-waving as
practiced by the DAR and its kind is at the very
base of the United States' continuing loss of
prestige abroad, and the consequent Soviet
gains.
We preach tolerance and democracy and then
a group of self-styled aristocratic society ma
trons break down the ideology with their un
believable narrow-mindedness—with their stu
pidity.
! it<• whole purpose of the world today would
seem to be to avoid that which could casilv
destroy the whole human race World War 111.
Most of our statesmen, conservative and lib
eral alike, are striving for that goal.
I he DAR ladies, however, are not primarily
interested in a world at peace, they are more in
terested in a superior America, looking down
from its height at all those "foreigners" and
their "varying philosophies. What happened
to the great American doctrine of equality?
The ladies preach democracy, \et make it
mandatory that their members have Revolu
tionary War ancestors on their family trees.
We usually are quite amused at the anti-in
tellectual actions of the DAR, never bothering
to take the ladies too seriously. However, we
were also quite amused at the egotistical rav
ings of Joseph McCarthy but soon found out
that not only would the voters of a whole state
back him but also that he had gained many
supporters in his anti-intellectualism—and lie
became dangerous to the peace of the world.

Recently the DAK has made some ridiculous
charges concerning the United Nations, charges
which any student of international relations can
easily refute.
They say the UN is set up as a world govern
ment, when in fact its charier guarantees the
sovereignty of each and every member nation.
With a little more study the good daughters
would find that World War 11 and its horrible
slaughter of human lives (or. of more interest
to the DAR, of American lives) could have been
avoided had the League of Nations been use/l
properly—use which only U.S. membership
could have assured.
The United Nations is the League of Nations
under a different title. Its proper use, requiring
a liberal understanding and toleration of all
philosophies, will keep us from World War 111.
The DAR cannot seem to understand this
simple fact. They preach ignorance of things
foreign, of "varying philosophies." They damn
the UN, which is merely trying to avoid the
bloodshed of another world war and which is
trying to leach a greater understanding among
all the peoples of the world—an understanding
which is the only thing which will keep all
peoples, Americans included, from the horrors
of a world war which will not only remove
America from th* Americans, hut the world
frum human beings.
We might ask that the DAR and its support
ers ponder the words of Ben llecht:
" I he need to fight Communism with our guns
is the result of our stupidity in tackling it with
our minds. We lost the political debate with
1 he (.omniunists by imitating their hysteria and
mendacity at which we are comparative ama
teurs.
"We have left only the chance to prove we
are physically stronger than the Red armies—
and as eager to die for our muddleheadedness
as the Russians are for their fresher lunacies.*'
The anti-intellectualism of the DAR repre
sents the greatest example of the "stupidity in
tackling it [Communism] with our minds."
Such thought has indeed paved the way for the
chance to "die for our muddleheadedness."
Rut there is still some hope left, the ladies
of the DAR and their kind are moving so far
to the right they may soon disappear com
pletely in the ridicule of their contemporaries.
The United Nations may yet be used to peace
ful advantage.
These are our only hopes.
