Housing Regulation
Editor, The Daily:
Last Monday night the AWS representatives
that came to Branner to discuss changes for the
housing program received a pleasant shock. One
panel group of about 70 girls actually broke into
applause for a proposal. Since it was unfamiliar
to some of us, we want to make sure that every
one is aware of this plan, and to voice our strong
support of it:
1) We would restrict row houses for juniors
and seniors.
2) We would place a maximum of two-thirds
seniors in any living group.
3) We suggest that a girl be allowed to draw
between quarters if she desires, as under the pres
ent system.
We feel that this plan, when considered from a
realistic and long-range viewpoint, includes the
best points of both the existing system and the
proposed changes.
Firstly, every girl is insured of being placed in
the living group of her first choice at least one,
and probably two years.
Secondly, the disadvantages of being compelled
to draw every year are avoided, for girls can slay
in the residence of their preference and with their
friends if they wish.
Thirdly, this alternative plan would renovate

the whole spirit of Lagunita. Wo have found that
the general response to tlie question "Where do
you want to draw next year?" is "Moore, Row
houses, but not Lag." Face it, girls, we just won't
all lit so we'd better do something to make Lag
more preferable—and we can. Under this plan.
Lagunita would be primarily a sophomore dorm
.except for those upperclass women who want to
be there.
No longer would girls be there only because
they drew tiie fated high numbers. They would
have the same interests and likes, class unity
would be increased, and the Roble-Branner di
vision would be overcome before we move into
smaller living groups.
Forthly, each of the dorms would have inter
mixing ol classes.
We all seem to agree that the existing system
can be improved. By this alternate proposal we
receive the full benefits of the ideas behind the
new proposals, without many of the disadvanta
ges. • j
We freshmen, by postponing for one year the
opportunity of living in the row houses, insure for
everyone the chance of living where she wants;
we would add not only to the spirit of Lagunita,
but to the general happiness of all the living
groups. We feel this is, in many ways, the best
plan. What do you think?
