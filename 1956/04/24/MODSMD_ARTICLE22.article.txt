## University of Washington Lifts Ban On Partisan Political Speakers 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
After many months of contro
versy, the University of Washing
ton has liberalized its 40-year-old
ban on political speakers on cam
pus.
The new plan, which includes
anti-subversive restrictions, would
permit publicly declared candi
dates for public office or their
supporters to speak on the cam
pus.
In announcing the new program
the Board of Regents declared
that no other university has the
tight speaker's ban presently em
ployed by Washington and they
doubt that they can readily de
fend the present strict program.
Under provisions of Stanford's
Founding Grant, political activity
of a purely partisan nature, such
as party organizations, are prohib
ited on this campus although po
litical figures may appear to dis
cuss subjects of an educational
nature.

Another story to prove that pro
fessors aren't infallible comes
from the University of Texas.
There, professor of paleontology
while giving an exam, left the key
to the answers out on the desk.
As students turned in their pa
pers, the key became thoroughly
mixed up in the stack.
When the professor began to
grade the exam he decided he
must have lost the answer sheet
and made up another one.
When all the papers had been
graded, including the original key,
the professor began to record the
grades.
The key had conie out with a
score of 70.
An idea which Stanford might
take up is one being tried by Ore
gon State. A new political party
has been formed there, the Do-
Nothings.
Candidates on the Do-Nothing

slate won't campaign, the party
itself will do nothing (besides get
ting elected), and they are aiming
their appeal at the student bloc
which shows no interest in elec
tions or voting.
Stanford has plenty of raw ma
terial for this type of party, al
though it's doubtful whether the 1
active membership would be very
large.
Latest example of administra
tion stifling of university press
freedom has occurred at the Uni
versity of Florida.
There, the dean of students of
fered to gel a campus printing
plant for the student newspaper
on the condition that the paper
accept a board of publications
composed of faculty members.
Funds were unavailable for the
printing plant, it turned out, but
the board of publications was cre
ated anyway to make certain that
undergraduate publications would
please the administration.
The dean is a noted segrega
tionist, and one student editor
commented that "the existence of
a democratic and constitutional
process on this campus is a sham."
However, not a murmer of pro
test about his latest move has
been heard from the Florida stu
dent body.

uphold his constitutional rights

a trial by jury.
This was granted him. The usu

student's fine after the trial:

slate won't campaign, the party
itself will do nothing (besides get

their appeal at the student bloc
which shows no interest in elec

Stanford has plenty of raw ma
terial for this type of party, al
though it's doubtful whether the 1
active membership would be very
large.
Latest example of administra
tion stifling of university press
freedom has occurred at the Uni
versity of Florida.
There, the dean of students of
fered to gel a campus printing
plant for the student newspaper
on the condition that the paper
accept a board of publications
composed of faculty members.
Funds were unavailable for the
printing plant, it turned out, but
the board of publications was cre
ated anyway to make certain that
undergraduate publications would
please the administration.
The dean is a noted segrega
tionist, and one student editor
commented that "the existence of
a democratic and constitutional
process on this campus is a sham."
However, not a murmer of pro
test about his latest move has
been heard from the Florida stu

A student at Asbury College,

arrested for speeding, decided to
uphold his constitutional rights
and demanded that he be allowed
a trial by jury.
This was granted him. The usu

student's fine after the trial:

After many months of contro
versy, the University of Washing
ton has liberalized its 40-year-old
ban on political speakers on cam
pus.
The new plan, which includes
anti-subversive restrictions, would
permit publicly declared candi
dates for public office or their
supporters to speak on the cam
pus.
In announcing the new program
the Board of Regents declared
that no other university has the
tight speaker's ban presently em
ployed by Washington and they
doubt that they can readily de
fend the present strict program.
Under provisions of Stanford's
Founding Grant, political activity
of a purely partisan nature, such

Another story to prove that pro
fessors aren't infallible comes
from the University of Texas.
There, professor of paleontology
while giving an exam, left the key
to the answers out on the desk.
As students turned in their pa
pers, the key became thoroughly
mixed up in the stack.
When the professor began to
grade the exam he decided he
must have lost the answer sheet
and made up another one.
When all the papers had been
graded, including the original key,
the professor began to record the
grades.
The key had conie out with a
score of 70.
