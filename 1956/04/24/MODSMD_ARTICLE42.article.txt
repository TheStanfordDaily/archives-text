## Composer Boasts Varied Accomplishments, Career in Symphony, Jazz, Ballet Music 
### 
Leonard Bernstein, noted musi
cian and composer, is the author
of the m us i c for "Wonderful
Town," this year's Spring Show.
The annual event put on by Ram's
Head will open May 9 in Memorial
Auditorium.
Bernstein has a long record of
musical accomplishments includ
ing being a brilliant pianist, ex
associate director of the New
York Philharmonic and "long
hair" composer of renown, accord
ing to Bill Scott, musical director
of "Wonderful Town."
Although most of the music he
has composed is in the jazz idiom,
he has written the music for the
ballet "Fancy Free," the Jeremia
Symphony, show music for "Trou
ble in Tahiti," "On the Town" and
a new musical version of "Can
dide."
Walker Arranged
Don Walker arranged the
Broadway orchestration of "Won
derful Town," which is being used
in the Spring Show. He also ar
ranged the music for the musical
"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."
Scott says the music for "Won
derful Town" consists mostly of
jazz numbers with rhythm appeal,
and the show is predominantly
dancing. "It has a rhythmic foun
dation rather than melodic con
tent; therefore, it is the only show
that has been a smash success

without what could he termed a
'hit song'."
Writing Music
In writing the music for a hook,
the composer chooses sequences
in the story which lend themselves
to musical number or dance rou
tines. according'to Scott. Then, in
coordination with the authors of
the book, he sets it to music.
One of the songs of "Wonderful I
TÂ»wn," which is played at the Vil
lage Vortex, is called "Let It Come
Down." It is orchestrated for wind
instruments and percussion and
is "extremely sophisticated jazz of
a blues character."
The majority of the vocal num
bers are solos, duets and trios
with the chorus, says Scott. Al
though generally the dancers do
not sing, in one number, "Swing,"
the entire dance ensemble sings
while it does intricate dance steps.
Scott, as musical director, pri
marily works with the singing
parts and with the 28-piece or
chestra and cooperates closely
with Choreographer Bill Davis.
