## Favorite Son Wins in Massachusetts; Ike Heads Stevenson in Pennsylvania 
### 
(Compiled from United Press)
I he area thought to be the coldest proved to he the hottest yester
day, at least pojitically. For the first time in the territory's history,
Alaskan voters went to the polls to name their choices for presidential
candidates.
The Alaskan primary was fho only one of three presidential pri-

Maries yesterday which provided
ft direct contest between Adlai E.
Stevenson and Sen. Estes Ke
fauver as early returns began to
I rickle in.
On the Republican side, Presi
dent Eisenhower was ahead of
Sen. William F. Knowland (R-
Cjdlif.) by a 94 to 8 margin.
Knowland withdrew some months
ago, but not in time for his name
from I he ballot.
Massachusetts Vole Light
Although lack of a real contest
left the voters apathetic, Mass
achusetts Democrats gave a re
sounding victory to "favorite son"
candidate John W. McCormack in
yesterday's presidential primary.
The veteran House leader easily
defeated Stevenson and Kefauver,
but trailed President Eisenhower.
Gov. Christian A. Herter offered
only token opposition to Eisen
hower in the GOP section.
McCormack. who has said he
has no aspirations for a place on
the national ticket, went ahead of
Stevenson with heavy support
from his native Boston.
Kefauver withdrew several
weeks ago and urged support of
McCormack, thereby limiting in
terest in the contest. Stevenson
did not enter officially though
there was a month-long campaign
urging write-ins on his behalf.
Pennsylvania Vote Also Mild
Pennsylvania's primary yester
day showed a light turnout devoid
of any major contests and featur
ing a Presidential popularity poll
between Eisenhower and Steven
son.
Eisenhower, benefiting from a
heavier Republican turnout for
state office Contests, ran well
ahead of Stevenson as the vote
count mounted.
Eisenhower had only nominal
opposition from Knowland, who
declined nomination too late to
have his name removed from the
ballot.
Stevenson was unopposed on
the Democratic ballot, and there
were only a few write-ins for Ke
fauver and Gov. Averell Harri
man of New York.
Still, Stevenson received more
votes than the total of 152,002
votes cast in the Democratic pref
erential primary of 1952.
The Republican ballot featured
only contests for nominations of
U.S. Senator and state-wide of
fices. All Democratic candidates
were unopposed.
