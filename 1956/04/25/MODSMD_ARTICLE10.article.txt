# Menlo JC Students Protest School Food; Stage Dinner-Hour Walkout
## 
### 
Menlo College students turned their backs on dinner and stalked
out of the dining hall Monday night., reportedly in a demonstration
against poor food and health conditions at the school.
Menlo officials were unable to pinpoint the cause of the walkout,
and one attributed it to a case of "spring fever," saying that the
administration was not concerned.
Phone calls were received by various Bay Area newspapers, say
ing that the protest was caused by the fact that about half the
students were suffering from diarrhea.
San Mateo County health officials said, after an investigation of
kitchen facilities, they were unable to see anything wrong off
hand.
Preparatory students who eat food prepared in the same kitchen
reported very few cases of diarrhea. The number of college cases
was estimated at 70.
No immediate discipline action is planned by the administration,
but one official said:
"It would be interesting to know who is intensely disloyal."
