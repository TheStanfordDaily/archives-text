# Physicians Panel Discusses Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment
## Local Doctors Answer Common Questions About Cancer at Tuesday Series Program 
### 
Diagnosis and treatment of cancer was the topic for last night's
Tuesday Evening Series presentation. An American Cancer Society
film and a panel discussion by local doctors formed the program.
Dr. R. W. Jamplis served as panel moderator and led the discussion
through a systematic diagnosis and treatment of a hypothetical case

of cancer from the first examina
tion by the doctor of internal
medicine, Dr. Samuel C. Bonar, to
the radiologist's x-ray examina
tion, Dr. Stanford B. Rossiter; and
the pathologist's examination of
tissue, Dr. Carl A. Peterson.
Cancer Defined
"From One Cell," a short docu
mentary film preceded the panel
discussion and traced the human
life from a single cell to its final
form and function through eerl di
vision, explaining cell regenera
tion and degeneration. Cancer
was defined as a condition involv
ing abnormal cell regeneration
through division. Why this pro
cess starts seems to be the un
known quantity in cancer re
search.
( ause Unknown
Some of the questions most
commonly asked about cancer
were answered, indicating that
cancer's cause is unknown, it is
not infectious or contagious, it
spreads by local extent ion, is not
necessarily painful in many of its
types, and is treated by surgery
or radiation depending upon the
nature of the tissue.
At the close of the program Dr.
George II. Houck, Health Service
director, made the statement that
no age group is immune to cancer,
j Statistics baser! on eight years of
; study at Stanfor d show that there
is an average incidence of five
cases of cancer (not including
skin cancer i here per year.
