# A Waste of Time

### 
Thf. U.S. Supreme Court once more has shown
that it means what it says -tliis lime in refer-
Mice to its stand against segregation.
Monday the Court unanimously turned down
an appeal from a lower court decision which
banned tlie state bus segregation statute in
South Carolina, thn« making all such state laws
unconstitutional.
Here is another step toward reaching the
"enlightenment" which seems to he gripping
the nation today—toward the goal of complete
desegregation, toward a democratic America
wherein color is not the deciding factor in a

person's access to rights—on buses or anywhere.
In giving its decision the Court implied that
the South Carolinians who brought the case
before it were needlessly wasting the tribunal's
time by tr)ing to get support for segregation.
VTe hope the die-hard segregationists will
take heed of this implication. What it all boils
down to is that the United States government
will not long abide the anti-democratic practice
of segregation.
The world has changed for the better—and
it's going to be a permanent change.
The die-hards had better stop wasting their
own time as well.
