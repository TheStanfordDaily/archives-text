serving as its vice-president since 1952. %
His passing leaves j real void on the Stanford
scene for it will be difficult to replace a man of
Cushing's energies and devotion to the Uni
versity.
For the past two years he had worked on

the Board's land development committee, the
committee whose work will help decide the
future of Stanford. The University's progress
is intricately bound to this program.
For all his business activity iti the shipping
industry (lushing managed to devote consider
