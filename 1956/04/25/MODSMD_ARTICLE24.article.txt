### HELEN DEWAR 
\ rry destined to strike a familiar ring in the
cars of American voters by the time the !\o
vember elections roll around is that of busi
ness influence in government.
As long as evidences of our shaky prosperity
and dubious peace remain apparent, it is doubt
ful that Democratic allegations against the sub
lie manipulations of the financiers-turned-poli
ticians will hive much effect on the average
citizen.
Yet the battle cries of the Democrats and
tlie smug assurance of a confident Administra'
lion indicate more than just smoke from the.
lieat of an election campaign.
Behind the smoke there's fire that may well
singe the bin! of our "blossoming prosperity."
Though effective campaign weapons, the ar
guments that peace and prosperity, such as they
are, are the handiwork of the Eisenhower Ad
ministration, rather than factors controlled by
the natural course of industrial expansion and
post-war desire of all nations to avoid another
world-wide cataclysm, do not stand the test of
critical analysis.
The Republicans, claiming to be the party
of free enterprise and champion of the individ
ual caught in the maze of centralized and un
ionized restrictions, nevertheless since 1952
have seen small business profits go down 66
per cent, farm income decline 27 per cent and
small business failures rise 36 per cent.
Instead of becoming a freer element in the
economic sphere under the present adminis
tration. small businesses are bached up to the
wall and unless they hare sufficient capital,
lhey arc forced to collapse.
In the GOP tax bill passed in 1954, from
every dollar of "tux relief" corporations got
73 cents, families earning more than $5000 got
18 cents and families earning less than $5000
got only 9 cents.
1 he Vdministration has fostered such worthy
causes as Federal aid to schools and an ex
panded highway program, but much of the tax
payers money will never reach the roads or
schools, but will be siphoned off in high interest
rates to banking firms.
Business has its own special sphere of influ
ence in Ike's official coterie and, often a bit
confUS', d, the .' resident has watched resources
and land ' â€¢ st developed under Federal super
visions pass to private industries as lucrative
subsidies.
// is dangerous and indeed contrary to Amer
ican principles that one sector oj the economy
should hare such a dominant influence on na
tional life.
