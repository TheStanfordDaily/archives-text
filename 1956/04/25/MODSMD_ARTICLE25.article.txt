# Columnists Discuss Big Business And the Eisenhower Administration

### JIM PALMER 
The often-repeated charge thai the Eisen
hower Administration is dominated and de
voted to the interests of big business is one of
those popular fallacies which have gained as
cendancy among oul-of-office political critics.
Republicans need hot quiver in their boots
at this charge, nor should the American voter
be swayed by glib arguments advanced in its
favor. The charge can be. met squarely for what
it is—a baseless and meaningless attack.
To answer such attackn by inference and in
nuendo, Republicans can advance the follow
ing facts:
• The President has aimed at getting "the
best man for the Job" in so far as possible.
Highly skilled business executives have been
chosen for certain key positions because of their
ability in administrative positions. Previously
many of these jobs were filled by political cro
nies (whose ability as well as ethics was cer
tainly of a questionable nature).
• Every eftort is made to sever financial ties
between governmental appointees and any pri
vate business with which they may have some
connection. Undue influence possibilities are
further cut down by the fact that many policy
actions are formulated on lower levels of offi
cialdom and the appointee in question may
have much less of a hand in the matter than is
supposed.
• If the problem boils down to individual
ethics and honesty, the personal integrity of a
respected person at the top of his profession
must he given considerably more weight than
that of a political spoils appointee.
• Policy decisions are dictated by economic
conditions of the times. Actions which appear
favorable to industry are taken within the con
text of what is good for the economy and the
American people. Thus a corporate lax cut isn't
made because business dominates the Adminis
tration, but because business dominates the
economy's future.
• I he Administration has taken an unprece
dented number of actions against too-big busi
ness under anti-trust laws. President Eisenhow
er has takers an undeniably firm stand against
influence by big business in his veto of the gas
bill. He has repeatedly called for legislation
favoring workers and revision of labor laws.
These farts do not indicate any dominnvce of
big business in this Administration.
The current popular fallacy falls of its own
weight when the facts are examined and the
record compared with that of previous admin
istrations.

be swayed by glib arguments advanced in its
favor. The charge can be. met squarely for what
it is—a baseless and meaningless attack.
To answer such attackn by inference and in
nuendo, Republicans can advance the follow
ing facts:
• The President has aimed at getting "the
best man for the Job" in so far as possible.
Highly skilled business executives have been
chosen for certain key positions because of their
ability in administrative positions. Previously
many of these jobs were filled by political cro
nies (whose ability as well as ethics was cer
tainly of a questionable nature).
• Every eftort is made to sever financial ties
between governmental appointees and any pri
vate business with which they may have some
connection. Undue influence possibilities are
further cut down by the fact that many policy
actions are formulated on lower levels of offi
cialdom and the appointee in question may
have much less of a hand in the matter than is
supposed.
• If the problem boils down to individual
ethics and honesty, the personal integrity of a
respected person at the top of his profession
must he given considerably more weight than
that of a political spoils appointee.
• Policy decisions are dictated by economic
conditions of the times. Actions which appear
favorable to industry are taken within the con
text of what is good for the economy and the
American people. Thus a corporate lax cut isn't
made because business dominates the Adminis
tration, but because business dominates the
economy's future.
• I he Administration has taken an unprece
dented number of actions against too-big busi
ness under anti-trust laws. President Eisenhow
er has takers an undeniably firm stand against
influence by big business in his veto of the gas
bill. He has repeatedly called for legislation
favoring workers and revision of labor laws.
These farts do not indicate any dominnvce of
big business in this Administration.
The current popular fallacy falls of its own
weight when the facts are examined and the
record compared with that of previous admin
istrations.
