Another Complaint
Editor, The Daily:
I know one more thing that "lacks in Stanford
education", it is a Daily in which the reports sent
to it are not distorted by the refusal of printing
the texts as ihey are and by the attribution 1o
the authors of opinions that were neither implicit
nor explicit in their articles.
I complain, not only that sentences were taken
out of context—what I feared might happen—
worse than that, I object against the fact that
were made up and attributed to me.
I did not mean to say that "little is lacking in
Stanford education"- why say "little" anyway,
why not say "nothing's lacking" and make your
leaders even more happy?
The only thing that was left which was mine
in the report I wrote about last weekend at the
hostel was my name; that is not enough to make
it reflect my opinions.
1 hereby send you a copy my original text,
hoping that you will insert it as well as this letter.

Editor's Note: The Daily has a siafl of report-'
ers whose job it is to report the news. Sometimes,
as in the ease of the hostel, we are unable to send
u reporter to an event and request a report from !
another source —to be rewritten into news style
by The Daily.
Any student who wishes to join in this news
gathering' and writing is welcomed with open
arms to join the staff —but otherwise such work
is strictly in hands of staff members.
Unfortunately, few newspapers have the space
to devote to a verbatim account of all news hap
penings—nor do readers have the time or desire
to read such accounts. Hence the process of "boil
ing down" the news to more manageable propor
tions, something which naturally involves taking
quotes out of context.
. The original text says: "There is such a lot of
baloney and mullarkey that one would wonder
how Stanford can turn out such good products as
it has."
The Daily of Monday, April 23 says: "There are
such a lot of foolish views in America today that
one would wonder how Stanford can turn out as
