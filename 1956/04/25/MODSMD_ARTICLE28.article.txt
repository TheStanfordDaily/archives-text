# Stanford to Receive De Voto Collection of Americana
## Friendship with Stegner Family Responsible For Mrs. De Voto's Gift to Campus Library 
### 
Stanford recently acquired the
5000 volume collection of the late
Bernard De Voto, eminent histo
rian on Western Americana.
The collection, covering man's
westward movement, was pur
chased from De Voto's estate, and
will soon be shipped from his
home in Cambridge, Massachu
setts, to the Stanford Library.
The collection should prove a
"gold mine" to anyone interested
in history, particularly that of
Western United States, according
to Dave Heron, special assistant
to the Library director.
De Voto is well known for his
historical contributions in both*
books and magazine articles.
"Easy Cliair"
I lis column, "The Easy Chair,"
in Harper's magazine had many
followers. Prior to his associa
tions with Harper's he served as
editor of The Saturday Review of
Literature.
Probably his best known books
are "Mark Twain's America"and
"The Year of Decision."
This latter work concerned the
year 184(J in which the United
States faced a multiplicity of de
cisions on such issues as the Ore
gon compromise with Great Brit
ain and the Western boundary dis
pute with Mexico.
The author-historian died last
November and'left a highly prized
estate. Many prominent universi

tie.s immediately tried to acquire
his library.
