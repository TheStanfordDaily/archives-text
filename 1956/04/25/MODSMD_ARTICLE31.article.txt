Young, Spurrier Here
Although the Olympic Club
lacks depth, they have at least
one strong contender in most
events. Highlighting the group are
vo Olympic Games aspirants, Cy
Young, who has tossed the javelin
210 feet already this season, and
Lon Spurrier, a feature in the
880-yard event. Spurrier was up
set last week by Lang Stanley, a
returnee to San Jose State from
the Army, with a 1:48.7 mark.
Other top representatives of the
San Francisco delegation are Tod
Lewis, a favorite in the broad
jump with a 21 foot, 4!4 inch ef
fort this year; Jack Razetto, who
high jumped 6 foot 7 inches
against San Jose State, and Len
Simpson, a miler with a 4:18.7
