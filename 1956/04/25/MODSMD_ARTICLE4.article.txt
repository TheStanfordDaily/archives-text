# Soviets Invite Physics Prof To Conference
## SU Scientist Among 14 To Confer with Russ On Atom Development 
### 
Physics professor Wolfgang K.
11. Panofsky has received an invi
talion from the Soviet Union to
confer with top Soviet scientists
concerning high-energy nuclear
physics in Moscow next month.
Panofsky is one of 14 known
United States' scientists to receive
similar invitations during ihe past
six weeks. The notifications were
sent separately to the American
physicists and were signed by the
USSR Academy of Sciences.
Upon learning of the Soviet's
proposal, the Atomic Energy Com
mission, after some study, said it
has no objection to the Americans'
visit. In addition, the State De
partment has agreed to issue pass
ports, and the National Science
Foundation has offered to pay
round-trip travel expenses.
Three C'al Physicists
Panofsky Has consented to the
trip, as have three University of
California physicists. He plans to
leave May 10 and to return May
29.
Information concerning the
matter to be discussed has not
been released, but no classified
scientific knowledge is involved,
according to the New York Times.
High-energy nuclear physics con
cerns the effects of*atom smash
ers with large amounts«of energy
on atoms.
At Stanford, Panofsky is Direc
tor of the High-Energy Physics
Laboratory, one of the two Plan
son Laboratories on campus. He
is currently doing research in nu
clear physics and accelerator de
sign on Mark 111, a linear electron
accelerator. This is the only, and
the most powerful, machine of its
type in Ihe world. It has recently
generated as much as 600 million
electron volts.
Born in Berlin
Bo r n in Berlin, Germany in
1919, Panofsky became an Ameri
can citizen in 1912. He acquired
the A. B. degree at Princeton Uni
versity and the Ph. D. at Califor
nia Institute of Technology.
He is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, as well as several scientific
societies, and has published many
scientific papers in professional
journals.
