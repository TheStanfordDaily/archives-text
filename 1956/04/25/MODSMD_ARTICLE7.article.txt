# Dulles Declares Red Satellite Crip Loosening
## Secretary of State Introduces Long Range NATO Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 24 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today Russia's grip on
the European satellites is begin
n in g to loosen because of the
Kremlin's new cordial attitude
toward Yugoslavia.
He told his weekly news confer
ence Moscow's new policies have
put a premium on "Titoism"—the
phrase used to describe Yugoslav
Marshal Tito's 1948 breakaway
from Soviet domination.
Dulles said Russian leaders do
not want their hold on their other
satellites to weaken. But some of
the satellites, such is Poland and
Czechoslovakia, may see Tito is
getting the best of two worlds and
wonder why they should not fol
low the same path.
The Secretary also told news
men his new concept of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) is to make it a long
range permanent organization to
prevent future European wars. He
declined to go into detail on his
ideas, first expressed in a New
York speech yesterday. He said,
however, he will make specific
suggestions at next week's Paris
meeting of the NATO Council.
Dulles indirectly entered the
sharp dispute between President
Eisenhower and Democratic polit
ical figures on whether the United
States is losing the cold war with
Russia.
The Secretary said it now is
widely judged the Soviet Union is
not to be feared. If Russia is being
more tolerant now and more lib
eral in its domestic affairs, that
in itself is a great cold war vic
tory, he said.
