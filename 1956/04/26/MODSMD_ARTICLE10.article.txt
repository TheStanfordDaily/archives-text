# To Censure Or Not to Censure Is the Question
## Everyone Protests As LASSU Ponders Political Union Hassle 
### Jae Hunley 
"My motion includes the whole
kit and kaboodle — everything,"
said ASSU Vice-President Helen
Zarifes with a flourish.
"This is ridiculous" cried stu
dent legislature member Bobby
Clark. "We're being as foolish as
some of these people."
And ASSU Legislature last
night continued an hour-long
wrangle over whether Political
Union could censure its own mem
bers for joining an "illegal" dele
gation to a mock political conven
tion at the University of Southern
California on April 8. %
The debate arose when the Leg
islature minutes-reading commit
tee questioned the censure, by Po
litical Union, of the delegation
which was recognized at the USC
convention, because "they ob
tained recognition without the
consent of the Political Union."
I'oli Union's Story
The situation, as explained by
Political Union president Ernest
Hart/, was that Political Union:
• Gave notice that a mock po
litical convention would be held
at USC.
• Invited all interested to sign
up to join the delegation.
• Formed a delegation and sent
it to USC.
• Found another group at the
convention had obtained "key
positions" through connections in
the convention set up, making it
impossible for the "official" Po
litical Union delegation to be rec
ognized.
• Was therefore "censuring"
this usurping group as a way of
registering a strong protest and
making sure that this "didn't hap
pen again."
Hartz justified the censure, say
ing that all members of the
"other" delegation could have
been part of the official one if
they had so requested.
He said that Political Union was
"beating the bushes" hunting for
people to be on the delegation and
that he sent the delegation chair
man to the convention with
"strict instructions" to include in
his delegation any bona fide Stan
ford student.
Outraged Innocence
At this point, outraged inno
cence in the form of Steve Nye,
a member of the censured body,
rose to protest the protest.
According to Nye and also Eve
rett Kindig, another "censured"
member, those taking part in the
illegal delegation felt the Political
Union group was not representing
the majority opinion of Stanford
students.
And then the fun began.
Legislature, which had origi
nally started out to approve the
minutes of the subsidiary bodies,
found itself in a political hassle
over the censure.
What's Happening?
Complicating this problem were
the charges and counter-charges
between Hartz and the "others,"
Legislature's tendency to attempt
to pass judgment on the individual
delegations, and the fact that no
one really knew what was happen
ing.
It eventually came to light that
the crux of the matter was Mike
Hudson, unfortunately absent
from the harangue. Hudson was
the person who, as head of the
Republican caucus of Political
Union, handled the formation of
the delegation on campus.
According to Hartz, Hudson was
hunting for people to represent
the Stanford area at the conven
tion and had included Everett
Kindig as part of the delegation.
Full House
Kindig. however, told Ihc Legis
lature repeatedly he was informed
by Joe Pool, a member of the dele
gation, that the delegation was
short of members and that when
he asked Hudson about it, he was
told again and again that the dele
gation was "full."
After several minutes more of
this back and forth accusation and
denial, Nye questioned ASSU
President George Ralph as to
what high body the censured
group can go to when it feels that
it has been dealt with unjustly by
other members "^b/'
Ralph Jhut jwjt.
lature was the { "irl 'high
authority, and from 'he solu
tion to the problem, albrty tempo
rary, was derived.
Legislature approved the min
utes, and thereby the Political
Union censure, heard the appeal
from Nye, as a "member of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University and of the censured
group" and moved to have Ralph
i select a sub-committee to look
! into the entire matter and report
! back to Legislature next week.
A detailed report of other Leg

Outraged Innocence
At this point, outraged inno

According to Nye and also Eve

member, those taking part in the
illegal delegation felt the Political
Union group was not representing
the majority opinion of Stanford
students.
And then the fun began.
Legislature, which had origi
nally started out to approve the
minutes of the subsidiary bodies,
found itself in a political hassle
over the censure.
What's Happening?
Complicating this problem were
the charges and counter-charges
between Hartz and the "others,"
Legislature's tendency to attempt
to pass judgment on the individual
delegations, and the fact that no
one really knew what was happen
ing.
It eventually came to light that
the crux of the matter was Mike
Hudson, unfortunately absent
from the harangue. Hudson was
the person who, as head of the
Republican caucus of Political
Union, handled the formation of
the delegation on campus.
According to Hartz, Hudson was
hunting for people to represent
the Stanford area at the conven
tion and had included Everett
Kindig as part of the delegation.

Kindig. however, told Ihc Legis

by Joe Pool, a member of the dele

After several minutes more of

night continued an hour-long
wrangle over whether Political
Union could censure its own mem

The debate arose when the Leg
islature minutes-reading commit

which was recognized at the USC
convention, because "they ob
tained recognition without the
consent of the Political Union."
I'oli Union's Story
The situation, as explained by
Political Union president Ernest
Hart/, was that Political Union:
• Gave notice that a mock po
litical convention would be held
at USC.
• Invited all interested to sign
up to join the delegation.
• Formed a delegation and sent
it to USC.
• Found another group at the
convention had obtained "key
positions" through connections in
the convention set up, making it
impossible for the "official" Po
litical Union delegation to be rec
ognized.
• Was therefore "censuring"
this usurping group as a way of
registering a strong protest and
making sure that this "didn't hap
pen again."
Hartz justified the censure, say
ing that all members of the
"other" delegation could have
been part of the official one if
they had so requested.
He said that Political Union was
"beating the bushes" hunting for
