Student Apathy
Geyer, a Phi Sigma Kappa from
Oakland, defined the main issue
of the thus-far lethargic campaign
as "student apathy toward the
coming elections and student body
government in general."
He later told The Daily that the
"apathy is a positive statement of
protest by the student body
against the overemphasis of the
importance of student govern
ment by some of its members."
"It is both the right and privi
lege of these enthusiasts 10 par
ticipate in student government if
they do not attempt to act in ex
cess of the powers inherent in a
student government, or forget:
that they represent the whole stu
dent body rather than one faction
in it,"he said.
Proposes Changes
Candidate Bob Freelen proposed
changes in the election system in
order to offset "general apathy."
"I suggest holding ASSU nomi
nations the week before Dead
Week of winter quarter to give
candidates time to prepare their
platforms and to avoid having
elections interfere with s pr in g
quarter midterms."
He also advocates using the
ASSU President's office as a liai
son between students and the dean
of students office.
Candidate Arthur Bosworlh cen
ters his platform on the "need to
develop student interest in both
politics and religion."
Among his proposals are for
mation of a religious union simi
lar to the present political union.
He also advocates a change in
women's regulations.
Re-Eva! nation
"There should be a re-evalua
tion, an outlet for those girls in
the minority who may not wish to
attend house or corridor meet
ings."

Falkner has requested thai all
other candidates interested in
write-in campaigns see him in the
ASSU office from 4 to 5 today.
