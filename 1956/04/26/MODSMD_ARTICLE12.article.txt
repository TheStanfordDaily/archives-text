# Portrait from Memory Is 'Painfully Effective' Play
## Stanford Players Production Described As Work Perching on the Edge of Melodrama 
### Terry Comito 
That Irene Griffin's original play, "Portrait from Memory," perches
insecurely on the edge of melodrama doesn't keep it from being a
work of sincerity and power. That the current Stanford Players pro
duction comes unfortunately close to pushing it over that brink
doesn't keep it from having some painfully effective moments.

M ore painful ones, however,
than moving, and few that might
be called tragic. The snuffing out
of Rose Perry has a harrowing
force, but "Portrait from Mem
ory" suffers both from the inert
completeness and the unreasoning
shrillness of its depair.
Motion at times seems com
pletely atrophied: Rose does noth
ing but squirm irresolutely as one
horror after another is dropped
onto her head. What is left is a
series of circular arguments, often
powerful, but apparently without
direction.
The horrors themselves, more
over, are so continuous, so black,
so often familiar the drunken
husband steals his wife's heirloom
jewels to buy more drink as to
seem often more t he author's than
the circumstance's caprice.
That they are for the moment,
accepted is due largely to Astrid
Willsrud as Rose. Her face and
whole body melt, jerk and collapse
in grief like an unstrung puppet.
If the same cannot be said if
the figures about her, part of the
trouble.lies in the determined lu
gubriousness with which they are
played. Surely there is evidence
enough in Miss Griffin's script to
indicate that an air of abusive
vulgarity would have been more
appropriate than Natalie Merrill's
venomous intensity, th a n John
McElhaney's albeit skillful
loathsomeness. Even Miss Wills
rud lacks in her early scenes the
vigor, the apparent strength, that
one of the characters later attrib
utes to her, and that would have
made her fall more devastating.
Miss Griffin's play is, neverthe
less. notable for its willingness to
face up to unpleasant situations.
One hopes that in her future
works, without compromising this
honesty, she will extend it to see
her material more closely in its
full three dimensions.
