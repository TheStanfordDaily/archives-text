T/:simti constitutional cijakanti'is against
ascendancy of the military over the civil ele
ment in our society, several vivid violations of
this basic principle have occurred during the
past year.
I-specially striking was last summer's case
of Merchant Marine cadet Kugene l.andy and
several others who were refused commission in
the armed services because relatives or close
associates had been affiliated at one time with
; he (lommunist I'arty.
The l.andy case arose from present Army
rulings whereby draftees uir subjected to lov
altv investigations and are forced to sign a strict
loyalty oath.
Failure to sign the oath or indications of
subversive tendencies in a soldier's background
have become sufficient cause for general (less-
I han-honorable) discharge.
The power wielded by the armed forces in
investigating and judging an individual's per
sonal background is one out of all proportion
10 the constitutional basis for our civil govern
ment and one dangerous to the expression of
free thought among the nation's youth.
This power becomes a real danger when it
implies broad censorship of actions and beliefs
of its citizens, when it punishes retroactivelv
I or mistakes made and disavowed, when it con
-11 e m n s individuals who have done nothing
wrong except to associate with persons who for

some reason or another arc considered ".securitv
rinks,
I he real threat is nol that "security risks"
may infiltrate the armed forces to the extent
that our whole defense system will he under
mined, as some claim, hut rather that the pat
tern of individual thought and action may he
so directed by fear of future repercussions that
minds will become stereotyped, timid and in
capable of originality.
Questions brought up in security investiga
tions include not only past activities and former
associates: ihey also cover hooks read, meetings
attended, college activities; and in many case?
allegations prove to be false only after a per
son's reputation has been permanently marred.
A "general discharge" is more than jusl
a release from military service. It entails a
(•loud of suspicion destined to hang over a per
son for the rest ol his life; for, in calling nil
individual a "risk to his country, the govern
ment is branding him as an unworthy citizen,
a person who might well be a traitor, or at least
a subversive, corrosive element.
It can hardly he denied that the military
possess the right to punish for crimes com
mitted while in service, hut it is offensive to
our very system of American justice to allow
further unbonorable dismissals for actions
committed prior to induction, especially when
these actions do not even fall within the cate
gory of "criminal."
