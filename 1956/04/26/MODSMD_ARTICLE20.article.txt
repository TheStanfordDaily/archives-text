# What Do YOU Think?
## Is Anyone for Apathy? Apparently They Areâ€”in Student Government 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Last year I I I candidates were nominated for
ASSU and class offices. This year about were
nominated for ASSU, class and WRA positions.
I here are three candidates for student body
president, one for vice-president and one for
yell leader. Why this apparent apathy?
Jeanne Menkkn, '58. Robin: "I think the
ASSU posts must he too difficult or time-con
suming for the reward. Or perhaps there is too
much pressure from the various organizations,
100 much politics."
Joii.v Sturgeon, i>7. Alpha Sigma Phi: "It
seems to me that a lot of it results from tlie
lack of concrete programs undertaken by the
ASST. The Legislature bickers over abstract
principles, which ends up with some foolish
action. The yell leader referendum will serve
as an example."
Dorcas Crawford, '57, Mariposa: "One rea
son for the apathy is the laek of sororities at
Stanford. The fraternities' influence in student
government is weak because they have no so
rorities to impress.
"Inhere is very little participation because
student leaders are not respected or admired.
There would be more interest if athletes ran
for offices. We need more well-rounded leaders
rather than just intellectuals or parliamenta
rians.
' Also people are scared that if they run for
offices they will be labeled 'red hots'."
(it.aire Smith, '59, Roble: "The cause of
student apathy, I feel, is thai too much respon
sibility is placed on each officer. There isn't
enough cooperation to lessen the burdens of
individuals in the student government. Take

for example Eric Fricker, who resigned because
of lack of recognition and assistance in propor
tion to the work involved."
Kill Allen, "56, off-campus: "Last year at
this time there was a great deal of interest in
the ASSU elections, due largely to a candidate
who promised to streamline the committees,
remove the sycophants and provide a generally
efficient government.
"Somewhere during the elections, however,
the steam was blown off, leaving nothing. In
short, the previews were good and had everyone
interested; but the show was very bad and now
no one is interested."
Sydney Howell, '57 r off-campus: "There
was a great amount of enthusiasm generated
by George Ralph last year.
'"Rut the student government wasn't stream
lined this year as was promised. Students prob
ably figure that a person with as much indi
vidualism as Ralph seemed to have couldn't do
anything with student government. They cer
tainly couldn't.
"There simply is no respect or recognition
for student officers. As far as I can see, not a
thing can be done about it."
Dick Lee, '57, St<>rn: "With the present laek
of confidence in student government, who
would want to make the sacrifice of time and
energy involved by assuming these positions?
"Few students want a job with no praise and
lots of criticism. Support student government,
or criticize only if willing to participate as
well.
"Otherwise, leave the 'red hols' alone; they
may accomplish much that is worth while."
