'Unofficial' Rally
Editor, The Daily:
As The Daily reported, Election Commission
originally planned to have a political rally at
Rudy's this Friday afternoon. Regulations set
forth by ASSU Legislature have prohibited this.
Vnoffioially, as a representative student at Stan
lord, I can stale mv own opinion.
I think that if most of the Stanford students

would migrate to Rossotti's about three o'clock
1 his Friday afternoon, and if the candidates also
happen to be there, it would be an excellent
chance for the voters to meet the candidates who
might wish to do some informal electioneering.
It might even be as much fun as a reunion.
Remember, this is just a personal opinion.
Chuck Falkner, chairman
Election Commission
