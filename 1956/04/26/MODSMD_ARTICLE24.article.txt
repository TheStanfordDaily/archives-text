# Army Often Discharges 'Security Risk' Draftees
## Soldiers Who Refuse to Sign Loyalty Pledge Subject to General Discharge, Benefit Loss 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
"You have a father who is re
ported to have said if Communism
offered anything good he would
accept it." This is one of the sev
eral reasons why hundreds of
draftees will have brief Army ca
reers.
Either during the first days of
service or just prior to induction,
all draftees are investigated to de
termine their loyalty. Upon induc
tion, the draftee is required to
sign a loyalty oath.
For a number of reasons, many
draftees refuse to sign under the
Fifth Amendment. This automati
cally starts discharge proceedings.
Once started, there is no stopping.
Discharges
The primary difficulty is that in
these cases the Army gives a "gen
eral" discharge for "security" rea
sons. There are four main cate
gories of discharges. The most fa
m i 1 i a r is the "honorable" dis
charge.
Then comes the "general" and
the two "yellow discharges" so
called because they are printed on
yellow paper. These last two are
the "bad conduct" and "dishonor
able" discharges.
Loses Benefits
The recipient of a "general" dis
charge or a "yellow discharge"
loses all veteran benefits and gets
no mustering-out pay. He also will
experience difficulty getting a job.
Eight soldiers have challenged
the Army's discharge policy in the
Federal courts. They claim if the
Army wants to discharge a man
for political views held before he
joined, he should be given an hon
orable discharge.
In an attempt to alleviate this
problem, the Army has suggested
that it conduct, all investigations
prior to induction; then if the fu
ture draftee is regarded as a "se
curity risk" he would be given a
special draft classification.
The eight soldiers hold that this
would debase a man in civilian
life. They claim this would allow
the Army to set itself up as a po

| litical censor over all men of draft
j age. To hold the threat of such
I debasement over the heads of so
j many young people would serve
' to govern their activities, their
; thoughts and their very way of
; life.
Denies Right
Judge David N. Edelstein in
Federal District Court, New York,
handed down a decision denying
the Army's right; to give a general
discharge for these reasons. Re
ferring to the Supreme Court rul
ing that a man may not be tried
by the Army after discharge for
a crime committeed in service, Ed
elstein said, ". . . to put a soldier
in jeopardy of a less than honor-
I able discharge for acts committed
| prior to induction- and for acts
which were not crim in a I—is
scarcely less offensive to our no
tions of rudimentary fairness."
Several members of Congress
are interested in the problem, and
j studies are now going on. As yet
i no definite policy has been de
cided.

"You have a father who is re
ported to have said if Communism
offered anything good he would
accept it." This is one of the sev
eral reasons why hundreds of
draftees will have brief Army ca
reers.
Either during the first days of
service or just prior to induction,
all draftees are investigated to de
termine their loyalty. Upon induc
tion, the draftee is required to
sign a loyalty oath.
For a number of reasons, many
draftees refuse to sign under the
Fifth Amendment. This automati
cally starts discharge proceedings.
Once started, there is no stopping.
Discharges
The primary difficulty is that in
these cases the Army gives a "gen
eral" discharge for "security" rea
sons. There are four main cate
gories of discharges. The most fa
m i 1 i a r is the "honorable" dis
charge.
Then comes the "general" and
the two "yellow discharges" so
called because they are printed on
yellow paper. These last two are
the "bad conduct" and "dishonor
able" discharges.
Loses Benefits
The recipient of a "general" dis
charge or a "yellow discharge"
loses all veteran benefits and gets
no mustering-out pay. He also will
experience difficulty getting a job.
Eight soldiers have challenged
the Army's discharge policy in the
Federal courts. They claim if the
Army wants to discharge a man
for political views held before he
joined, he should be given an hon
orable discharge.
In an attempt to alleviate this
problem, the Army has suggested
that it conduct, all investigations
prior to induction; then if the fu
ture draftee is regarded as a "se
curity risk" he would be given a
special draft classification.
The eight soldiers hold that this
would debase a man in civilian
life. They claim this would allow
the Army to set itself up as a po

| litical censor over all men of draft
j age. To hold the threat of such
I debasement over the heads of so
j many young people would serve
' to govern their activities, their
; thoughts and their very way of
; life.
Denies Right
Judge David N. Edelstein in
Federal District Court, New York,
handed down a decision denying
the Army's right; to give a general
discharge for these reasons. Re
ferring to the Supreme Court rul
ing that a man may not be tried
by the Army after discharge for
a crime committeed in service, Ed
elstein said, ". . . to put a soldier
in jeopardy of a less than honor-
I able discharge for acts committed
| prior to induction- and for acts
which were not crim in a I—is
scarcely less offensive to our no
tions of rudimentary fairness."
