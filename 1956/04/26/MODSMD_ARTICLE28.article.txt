# Frosh Net Squad Offers Hope for Future Varsity
## Coach Rates Papooses Above UCLA Frosh; Nelson, Rawlins, Gould Pace Racqueteers 
### Dave Canfield 
Tennis fans who felt discouraged after watching IJSC and UCLA
batter Stanford last weekend may gain encouragement by examining
ihis year's freshman net team.
That is the opinion of Coach Bob Renker, Farm tennis mentor
since 1950. Renker didn't act hysterically happy over this year's frosh
club. But lie obviously considers

it one of his best.
"Our freshman team," declared
Renker calmly, "is better than
1 JCLA's this year."
Most promising Papoose pros
pects are, according to Renker,
Dave Nelson, Brooks Rawlins and
Dick Gould.
State Champ
Nelson won the Illinois State
high school tennis championship
last May. He is rated one of Chi
cago's m os t promising players
since Frank Parker came out of
the Windy City a decade ago to
win the national championship
two years in a row.
"But we have a lot of depth on
the freshman team," Renker poin
ted out. "We have 14 players on
the team who, if I hey work hard,
can win."
A top frosh prospect next year
will be high-ranking northern Cal
ifornia junior Robin Higleman.
Higleman, now a senior at
Downey High in Modesto, will en
roll next fall at Stanford.
Future Hopes
Summing up his hopes for the
future, Renker predicted, "Three
year s from now we hope to
achieve the -level of UCLA and
give them a good battle. But you
never know what's going to hap
pen," the rleeply bronzed coach
quickly added.
"They | USC and UCLA] get
these Peruvians, these Mexicans,
Ihese Fgyptians."
The first singles man this .year
for USC, Alex Olmedo, is from
Peru, and the next three singles
players, Pancho Contreras, Jau
()iiin Reyes and Yves LeMaitre,
are all Mexican Davis Cuppers.
Despite his hopes for the fu
ture, Renker isn't losing sight of
the season at hand.
"In spite of the fact we've been
beaten by USC. I think we're the
second best team in the confer
ence," he quietly asserted. "We've
got a lot of depth. We beat both
USC and Cal at the bottom posi
-1 ions."
Lead Way
Leading this year's netsters are
returning leltermen Jack Frost,
Roger- Keesing, Dave Duff, Bob
Prince and Ernie Du√üray and
sophomores Jack Douglas, Gil
White and Bob Bowden.
Douglas, White, Bowden and
Prince will return next year for
further competition.
Frost, a senior from Monterey,
enjoyed his best season in his
sophomore year, when ho finished
second in the California State
Tournament and ranked 13th in
the nation.
But, hampered this year by a
leg injury and a period of ineiigi
bility for scholastic reasons, Frost
has been beaten by USC's, UCLA's
and Cal's second singles men.
With Frost slipping to second
singles, Douglas has gotten his
chance to play first singles.
"Douglas will he our most prom
ising player next year," Renker
said. "He's a good athlete, a good
competitor and a hard worker. He
really wants to get better."
