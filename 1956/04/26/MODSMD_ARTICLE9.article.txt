# Bus Desegregation Meets Resistance
## 
### 
MONTGOMERY. Ala., April 2.~>
(UP) Negroes sat freely with
whites on busses in some southern
cities today but the same hard
core of resistance that has delayed
school integration kept the races
com part men ted in others.
(Generally, a compliance with
the new Supreme Court Action
foretelling the end of segregation
in transportation fell into what is
becoming a familiar southern pat
tern.
Some cities in Virginia, North
Carolina and Eastern Tennessee
| where faint beginnings have been
made in integrated education put
up no barriers against first-come
first serve seatings.
