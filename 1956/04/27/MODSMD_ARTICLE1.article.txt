# Participants Clarify Positions in 'The Case of the Disputed Delegation'
## 
### Jae Hunley 
Conflict continued yesterday in the case of the disputed delega
tion with both sides of the argument emphasizing and clarifying
their stands.
The situation arose Wednesday night in Legislature meeting
when the Legislature minutes reading committee questioned the
Political Union executive hoard's censure of a delegation that at
tended the jyiock political convention at the University of Southern
California on April 7 and 8, without Political Union sanction.
Appearing at Legislature meeting to explain the Political Union
stand was the group president, Ernie" Hart/.. Appearing for the
"censured group" were Steve Nye, Bob Sprinkel, Everett Kindig
and Cliff Kimber.
The result was an hour-long series of charges and counter
charges between the two sides which wound up with Legislature
approving the minutes and therefore, the censure; hearing the
censured group's appeal; and voting to have ASSU President
George Ralph appoint a special sub-committee to investigate the
whole affair.
The special committee consists of ASSU Vice-President, Helen
Zarifes, chairman; Marie Dußois, Sue Coshow, Tex Randall and
Bob Norman. They will report on their findings at Legislature
meeting next week.
Before the appointment of the committee, however, it became
apparent to Legislature members that the "other side" of the hassle
the Political Union side was not quite represented. Absent were
Mike Hudson, Republican caucus chairman and member of Political
Union executive board, and Joe Pool, chairman and sole member of
tiie delegation which found its position usurped upon arrival at
use.
Hudson was the person in charge of the formation of Stanford's

Republican delegation to the convention.
Yesterday The Daily contacted Hudson, Pool, Sprinkel, Kimber,
Nye and Kindig, and in separate interviews, heard their stands on
the question at hand.
According to Hudson, the University of Southern California sent
a letter containing information about the impending convention to
University President Wallace Sterling, the Political Science De
partment and Ralph early last quarter.
All three letters were subsequently turned over to Political Union
for further action. Political Union, in an executive board meeting,
appointed Hudson, as Republican caucus chairman, and Helen De
war, as Democratic caucus chairman, to handle formation of dele
gations to the convention.
Hudson said that a meeting, "duly publicized" was held and that
all persons interested in the convention were invited to sign up to
attend.
Hudson added I hat "seven or eight people signed up" and ex
plained that when he saw a person connected with the arrange
ments for the mock convention at a Republican State Convention,
he requested that Stanford be allowed to represent Wisconsin a
state which would require approximately 10 student delegates.
He told The Daily that he thought he could manage to get several
more to sign up and that he did.
Referring to one of the main charges of the "censured" group
that he deliberately excluded "certain prominent Republican stu
dents" from participation on the delegation—Hudson said that "at
the time I was contacted by Sprinkel and Kindig, the delegation
was full."
"However," he continued, "I told everyone who asked me that 1
had temporarily closed the lists but that I was sure people would
be dropping out and I was making a list of alternates."
Hudson also said that he informed "them" that if he got a list
of five alternates, he would write and request a 15 student state.
Hudson then explained that "people started dropping out like

flies" and that when spring quarter opened, all he had signed up
were Kindly, Bob Baker and Pool.
He said he contacted Kindig and told him to contact Pool for
details about the convention.
Hudson said that he knew nothing of another delegation until,
by accident, we (Pool and Hudson > found out in a circular sent
out by USC. that the Stanford delegation was to be contested. This
was the afternoon Joe (Pool) was flying down."
According to Hudson, Pool did not contest the delegation because
he was, by then, the only delegate and"it would look pretty ridicu
lous for one man to say he wanted to have both states (Stanford,
by this time, had been assigned two states)."
Also, Hudson asserted that the "others" had delegates in key
positions at the convention (Nye was chairman of the credentials
committee) and inferred that it would have been hard for Pool to
be recognized as the official Stanford delegation.
In summary, Hudson deplored the manner in which the "other
delegation consistently went around the law" and said that if they
felt they were being unjustly dealt with, they could have appealed
to Political Union executive board or Legislature "before the con
vention."
He said "I know for a fact that they (the other delegation) de
cided among themselves that they were not going to tell me or any
one who might know me that they were going to send a delegation
down."
"If the censurc does not go through," he said, "we envision the
setting of a precedent and at any meeting to which Stanford is
invited to send a delegation, it will be a simple case of the recog
nition of the first with the most.
"It will render null and void any screening process here."
On the olher side, Nye and company claim that the censure is
illegal in that three members of the delegation were in no way
connected with Political Union, the delegation did not go as Po
litical Union representatives but as Republican students, and they

do not believe a non partisan group, such as Political Union, has
any right to appoint members of a delegation to a partisan con
vention.
They also claim that the convention has the "only say" as to the
legality of members.
The "censured" group also claim the censure is unfair, holding
to their contention that there was "difficulty in getting on the
delegation," that they "co-operated with the Political Union dele
gate at the convention."
Nye and Sprinkel pointed out that Pool never brought this case
to the credentials committee but "settled it on the side" with the
dispued delegation. They also assert that none of their delegation
had any key positions at the convention at that time—namely, that
Nye was not chairman of the convention credentials committee
when the problem first arose.
Furthermore, they say, and Hudson agrees, that Hart/, and Hud
son sent letters with Pool authorizing him to permit the group to
join him.
According to Nye and Sprinkel, they joined and furthermore,
elected him to the position of chairman of the State of Virginia
delegation and gave him, from their group, enough representatives
for his state to allow it to be qualified to vote.
'I hey cite, in their favor, that the delegation's conduct at the con
vention reflected well on Stanford since they held offices, assisted
in the organization of the convention, and "kept Stanford from the
ignominy of having but one person interested enough to attend.
N,\e and Spiingel justify the separate delegation on the grounds
that their delegation's political views were more representative of
Stanford students.
They plaintively said that they "thought everything was fine
when we left the convention but when we got up here . . ."
Wednesday night Legislature will decide the right and wroni?
of it. h
