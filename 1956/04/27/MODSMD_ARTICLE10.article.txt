Palo Alto residents will be
handed circulars urging them to
go to church this weekend. Sixty
members of the Phi Delta Thcta
fraternity will distribute some
12,0(i(i of the circulars.
The fraternity is working on
"Operation (Jo To Church" as
part of a national plan by the
fraternity to replace aimless use
of lime with "Community Service
I >ays."
All the chapters of the frater

will go to those chapters judged
as having the greatest success.
National headquarters hopes
that Community Service Days
will become an annual tradition
with all chapters.
