### 
WASHINGTON, April 26 (UP) ;
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon |
told a "delighted" President Eisen- j
hower today that he would be
honored to run for re-election on
the 1956 Republican ticket.
His decision, and the Presi
dent's pleased reaction, made it all
but sure the GOP ticket next No
vember again will be headed by
the Eisenhower-Nixon team which
won out over Adlai E. Stevenson
in 1952.
Barring some utterly unexpect
ed development, all that remained
was for the GOP convention to
ratify the ticket at the San Fran-

Cisco conclave starting Aug. 20.
Nixon's "second term" an
nouncement was made after a
lengthy private talk with Eisen
hower. who had invited his 1952
running mate to "chart his own
course" this year.
The decision ended weeks of
speculation about Nixon's politi
cal future and was expected to
silence some talk of a "dump Nix
on" movement within the GOP.
Senate Republican leader Wil
liam F. Knowland, a fellow Cali
fornian, said he believes Nixon's
announcement "clarifies the po
litical atmosphere." He said it was

no surprise to him.
"It will permit Republicans to
close ranks now and concentrate
on the election of a majority in
the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives," Knowland said.
The 43-year-old Vice-President
announced his decision to report
ers at the White House after leav
ing what he described as a "mu
tually arranged" conference in
Eisenhower's office.
"I informed the President that
in the event that the President
and the delegates to the conven
tion reached the decision that it
was their desire for me to serve
as the nominee of the Republican
party for Vice-President, that I
would be honored to accept the
nomination again as I was and as
1 did in 19.">2," Nixon said.
At this point White House news
secretary James C. Hagerty in
terrupted. "The President has ask
ed me to tell you gentlemen that
he was 'delighted' to hear of the
Vice-President's decision," Hager
ty said.
