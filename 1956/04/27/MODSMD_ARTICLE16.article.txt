Hiss receiver! polite applause from
an audience of Princeton Univer
sity students tonight for a foreign
affairs speech that was consider
ably less controversial than the
scheduling of his appearance here.
The VVhig-Cliosophic Society, a
campus literary, debating and po
litical discussion group, churned
up a storm of protest by inviting
Hiss here for his first public ap
pearance since his release from
prison. But the speech itself came
off without incident and roused
lit llc controversy.
Some cheers and applause broke
out, followed by a few boos, when
he mounted the steps leading into
the hall.
