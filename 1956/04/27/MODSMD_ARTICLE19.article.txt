# Why Not a Visit?
## 
### 
President Eisenhower has rejected any visit
to the United States by Soviet leaders Khrush
chev and Rulganin.
His reasoning is that "all the issues on which
there should he some agreement were threshed
out at Geneva last summer . . . that some new
ideas should he brought forward" before any
such visit.
'Hie President seems to be forgetting the pri
mary purpose of such \isits, namely: good will.
Today the Soviet Union and the United States
are the leading nations in the world ami the
farther they drift apart the closer the world
which they lead comes toward an armed clash.
Ideologically opposed as we are, the only way
to "co-exist" (seemingly the only alternative to
war) is to get together and talk on all issues

many more of whirl) will ho brought out in the
casual air of a good visit than in the tension
filled atmosphere of a Geneva Conference.
Who knows hut that the So\iet leaders do
have some new ideas to bring up. A few relaxed
"good will " chats might bring out something
new.
\X e are just plain eurious to see what makes
the Red leaders tick. The closer they are to us
the easier they may he to understand, and the
more we understand them the more the chances
for a "hot war 1 ' are narrowed down.
Our present policy seems to be concentrating
on keeping the status quo iu the U.S.S.R.-U.S.
stand-off, perhaps a little good will visit will
help move us forward. The "cold" war cannot
last forever.
