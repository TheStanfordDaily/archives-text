### FRANK HUNTRESS 
'I he recent hullabaloo of ASSU elections has
brought to the foreground the lack of student
interest in student government.
This apathy which began last fall has spread
to other organizations around the campus.
\\ hat is the reason? One is that students just
don t like to he called "red-hols. But let s face
it. someone has to run the ASSU.
Last year 114 persons ran for offices during
spring quarter primary elections. This is com
pared with the 55 running this year.
Many have blamed George Ralph for point
ing out the uselessness of student government
as a waste of time. This may he true, but v\hv
should the apathy spread to other clubs and
organizations on the campus?
So far, three candidates for the office of
ASSU president have v ithdrawn from the race.
Dave Jenks and Cal Tilden did so before their
names could he put on the primary ballot.
Mart Hooley chose to wait until Tucsdav to
decline his nomination and therein leaving his
name on next week's primary election ballot.
Ihe candidate for vice - president, Jack
Meanis, waited until Tuesday also to decline
his nomination. The post of ASSU veep is usu
ally held by a woman who heads the social
coordinating board. Mearns left the race, which
is now uncontested.

Russia's Bobbsey twins, B. and k., finished
their talks with British Premier Anthony Kden
this week. Premier Nikolai Bulgauin and Party
First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev are pres

rally conducting a "good-will" tour throughout
the world.
U hat are the two up to? It's anybody's guess.
Maybe they really want peace, and themselves
believe in ditching Stalin's belligerent method.
Khrushchev on visiting St. Paul's Cathedral
in London remarked, when pointing to the
point where Hitler dropped his bomb, '"Look
ing ahead, Dean, you won't need a repair job
if an H-bomb falls."'
At Cambridge the boys got. a ribbing. At
breakfast one morning the cops intercepted a
letter for B. and K. It contained one snub-nosed
bullet and a warning that "each of you will gel
one of these inside you."
Well, whatever their purpose is, it can't be
said that the Russians can't throw ;i party. As
in Geneva last summer, their parties turn into
blasts, with Secret Service men and guests
knocking each other over.
They may visit Uncle Sam soon.
