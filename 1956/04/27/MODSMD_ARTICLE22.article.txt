# Hispanic-American Dept. Offers Varied Studies
## Program Follows French Setup of Crossing Departmental Boundaries; Offers Degrees 
### 
Planning the itinerary of the recent visit of nine Latin American
newsmen to the Stanford area and then being hosts to the journalists !
during their stay was just one of the many activities carried out by i
the Department of Hispanic American Studies.
This department, founded in 1944 and directed by Ronald Hil-!

ton, is interested in all Hispanic ,
activities and has entertained I
many Latin visitors who bring to J
them' fresh opinions and views of
events in Spanish speaking coun
tries.
Academically, the department j
offers a program of Latin Ameri-1
can studies which lead to the A.B.
and advanced degrees. These
studies include a regional pro
gram of Courses in Latin Ameri
can civilization, history, geogra
phy, political science, literature
and the Spanish and Portuguese :
languages.
The program is unique in its
policy of "cutting across depart
mental boundaries. According to
Hilton, he is attempting to bring
about a free exchange of ideas as
is possible in the French univer
sities where departmental divi
sions as known in the United
States do not exist.
Departmentalism
"Departmentalism is the curse
of American universities" said j
Hilton. "There is no doubt that
the example set by scientists of j
working in teams must be fol-!
lowed by scholars in their fields.:
We have far more to gain by co
operation with our colleagues
than by fighting with them. Life j
in a university should be a con-1
tinuous colloquim although this i
does not necessarily mean intel
lectual agreement."
Hilton's philosophy is carried
out in the Hispanic American i
Studies Seminar as well as in the
academic program of the depart
ment.
The editorial and advisory board.i
of the Hispanic American Report, j
the monthly journal of Latin i
American current events pub-!
lished by the department, includes !
members of Stanford's depart
ments of political science, econom-;
ics, Germanic and Romanic lan-'
guages, geography, mineral sci
ences, the Law School arrd the
Stanford Research Institute.

Publication of the Hispanic
American Report makes the de
partment more than a program
of courses in Latin American
civilization. Since 1948, seminar
members have been writing this
magazine which is sent out to 1000
subscribers throughout the world.
The magazine was founded by
Hilton, its editor, to fulfill a need
for a "methodical publication of
the developments of events in
Latin America." Most existing
publications are simply business
propaganda, or' have been care
fully slanted to follow current
government policy, he said.
Information
To obtain information for the
events in each country month by
month, students read and clip
other news publications ranging
from Chase National Bank and
State Department releases to the
daily newspapers of principle Lat
in American cities, the United
States, and London.
From these and news maga
zines written in both English and
Spanish, seminar students com
pile as complete an unbiased a
news story as possible.
