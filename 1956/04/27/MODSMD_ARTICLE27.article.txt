PHI BETA KAPPA, 1 LOVE YOU!
Once there was a Chi Omega named Alfreda Pectate who
was beautiful and well-formed and wore clothes of the most
tasteful cut and smoked the gentlest of all cigarettes — Philip
Morris, of corris!—and had, in addition to these admirable
qualities, a brain so massive and retentive that she used to read
the Britannica just for kicks.
Alfreda had one great ambition: to be elected to Phi Beta
Kappa. Consequently she was all a-dither when she heard a
rumor one night that a man from the Phi 15eta Kappa selection
board was coming over to the Chi Omega house to interview
her. Being all a-dither, Alfreda sat down and lit a Philip Morris,
as she always did when she was all a-dither, for gentle Philip
Morris, as wise Alfreda knew, is comfort to the troubled, balm
to the beset, and a haven to the vexed. But gentle Philip Morris,
as Alfreda, with her mighty intellect, was well aware, is not
only a cigarette for times of stress and strain, but also the
perfect accompaniment to happiness and light. For gentle
Philip Morris is sunny and cheery and jolly and merry and
yummy! All this Alfreda, with her giant cerebellum, knew.
By and by there came a loud, masculine knock on the door, and
Alfreda, composing herself, went to answer it. "Won't you come
in?" she said to the man outside. "1 am Alfreda Pectate."
"And I am Ed Fester," said the man, entering with a friendly
smile. Ed had found that a friendly smile was a great asset in the
Venetian blind game, which happened to be Ed's game. He had
nothing to do with Phi Beta Kappa; he had come over to see
about a new blind for the house mother's bedroom. But, of
course, Alfreda knew nothing of this.
"Do sit down," said Alfreda.
"Thanks, hey," said Ed. "But I can't stay long."
"Of course," said Alfreda and proceeded without delay to
demonstrate how wide and comprehensive was her learning.
"Deer," she said, "have no gall bladders."

la that so?" said Ed, who until this moment had believed
deer had Kail bladders.
"Ben Jonson," said Alfreda, "was buried in a sitting position."
"Hmm," said Ed.
"'Fortnight' is a contraction of 'fourteen nights,'" said
Alfreda. »
"What do you know!" said Ed.
"Many people think it is forbidden to wash an American
flag," said Alfreda. "That is not true. It is perfectly proper to
wash an American flag."
"Learn something every day," said Ed.
"The smallest fish in the world," said Alfreda, "is the Pan
ilaka Pygmea, which is under a half inch when full grown."
"How come they buried that Jonson sitting up?" said Ed.
"It's terribly crowded in Westminster Abbey," said Alfreda.
"Oh," said Ed.
"Ann Boleyn had six fingers on her left hand," said Alfreda.
"Heavens to Betsy!" said Ed.
i 'Are there any questions you'd care to ask me?" said Alfreda.
"Just one," said Ed. "How big is your hoiVse mother's
window?"
A tear ran down Alfreda's cheek. "Well, that's the way it
goes," she sighed. "You work and slave and study and then they
catch you on a trick question! ... Oh, well, that's life, I guess."
Forlorn and bereft, she rose and shambled to her bed and
fell upon it and wept for several days. But finally she pulled
herself together, and today she is with Byrd in the Antarctic.
