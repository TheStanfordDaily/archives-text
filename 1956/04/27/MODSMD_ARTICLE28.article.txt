# Stanford Press—From Bawlouts to Syllabuses
## Seventh Largest University Press In Nation on Amount Published 
### 
Dozens of pieces of printed ma
terial, from Bawlouts to class syl
labuses, are read by the average
Stanford student each day.
But few realize that the plant
which puts out this matter is lo
cated right on campus, the second
largest university press on the
West Coast.
The Stanford Press employs 90
to 100 people and is headed by
Leon Seltzer, recently appointed
director. Much of the actual pro
duction work is supervised by his
assistant, Jay K. Miller.
The first Stanford press was
set up by Julius A. Quelle, a law
student, in 1892. The plant grew
rapidly and in 1917 was bought
out by the University and made
into a regular department.
Seventh in U.S.
The Stanford Press has since
become the seventh largest col
lege press in the United States in
number of books printed. In size
it ranks higher, because it runs
its own printing plant too.
The Press prints about 45 books
a year, mainly non-fiction, about
40 per cent of which are written
by Stanford professors.
Among titles published here are
the "Stanford Short Stories" se
ries, Richard Bibler's "Little Man
on Campus" and many specialized
books on California.
Magazines
The Stanford Press also prints
five magaines — The Chaparral,
Pacific Spectator, Stanford Re
view, Stanford Law Review and
Stanford Medical Bulletin.
The Daily also uses Press facili
ties, and jobwork for the Univer
sity, such as letterheads and pro
grams, is handled by them.
Since the Press is run as a regu
lar University department, each
book published there must first
be approved by a five-man faculty
board to make certain that the
subject matter will be a credit to
Stanford.
Break Even
How much profit a book will
make is not a main factor in its
acceptance for publication. The
Press's only object is to break
even, and many books printed by
it lose money.
Because university presses op
erate at lower costs than commer
cial houses, they are rapidly tak
ing over serious non-fiction books
which sell relatively few copies.
College presses now publish 15

to 25 per cent of these books that
are put out each year, according
to Seltzer.
University I'ress
The place of the university
press is to reflect the scholarly
strength of its college and the uni
versity's intellectual role in the
entire country, not merely to pub
lish a provincial selection of
books, Seltzer believes.
It takes from six months to a
year for the Stanford Press to
publish a book. After a work has
been approved for publication, it
is taken to the Press and set up
in type in the composing room.
Proofs of this type are then
sent to proofreaders where errors
are marked for correction. These
are made and another set of
proofs is taken which the author
must apprbve.
Book Printing'
Sixteen pages are printed at one
time on the presses, either from
the original type or a photograph
ic plate, the latter being put on
an "off-set" press.
Finally the pages are ready for
cutting, folding, trimming and
binding. Covers are made sepa
rately at the Press and are put on
at the final stage of the operation.
The book is now ready for promo
tion and distribution by the Press.
The Stanford Press' plant con
tains about ten printing presses,
suitable for any size work. There
are also facilities for color print
ing and a special department for
gold stamping.
The Press does most of the re
binding work for the University
and Hoover libraries. A complete
camera room permits the Press to
do all its own photography and
developing.

Dozens of pieces of printed ma
terial, from Bawlouts to class syl
labuses, are read by the average
Stanford student each day.
But few realize that the plant
which puts out this matter is lo
cated right on campus, the second
largest university press on the
West Coast.
The Stanford Press employs 90
to 100 people and is headed by
Leon Seltzer, recently appointed
director. Much of the actual pro
duction work is supervised by his
assistant, Jay K. Miller.
The first Stanford press was
set up by Julius A. Quelle, a law
student, in 1892. The plant grew
rapidly and in 1917 was bought
out by the University and made
into a regular department.
Seventh in U.S.
The Stanford Press has since
become the seventh largest col
lege press in the United States in
number of books printed. In size
it ranks higher, because it runs
its own printing plant too.
The Press prints about 45 books
a year, mainly non-fiction, about
40 per cent of which are written
by Stanford professors.
Among titles published here are
the "Stanford Short Stories" se
ries, Richard Bibler's "Little Man
on Campus" and many specialized
books on California.
Magazines
The Stanford Press also prints
five magaines — The Chaparral,
Pacific Spectator, Stanford Re
view, Stanford Law Review and
Stanford Medical Bulletin.
The Daily also uses Press facili
ties, and jobwork for the Univer
sity, such as letterheads and pro
grams, is handled by them.
Since the Press is run as a regu
lar University department, each
book published there must first
be approved by a five-man faculty
board to make certain that the
subject matter will be a credit to
Stanford.
Break Even
How much profit a book will
make is not a main factor in its
acceptance for publication. The
Press's only object is to break
even, and many books printed by
it lose money.
Because university presses op
erate at lower costs than commer
cial houses, they are rapidly tak
ing over serious non-fiction books
which sell relatively few copies.
College presses now publish 15

to 25 per cent of these books that
are put out each year, according
to Seltzer.
University I'ress
The place of the university
press is to reflect the scholarly
strength of its college and the uni
versity's intellectual role in the
entire country, not merely to pub
lish a provincial selection of
books, Seltzer believes.
It takes from six months to a
year for the Stanford Press to
publish a book. After a work has
been approved for publication, it
