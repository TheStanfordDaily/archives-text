### Larry Jensen 
Coach Jack Weiershauser's
Stanford thinclads take on the
Olympic Club and Santa Clara
County Youth Center in a triangu
lar meet tomorrow in the Stan
lord Stadium. The field events
start at 1:30 with the track events
beginning at 2:00.
Stanford should take the meet
without too much trouble although
Olympic Club and the Youth Ou
ter have some outstanding indi
vidual performer's.
Jim Saras should come up with
a double win for the Indians in
the sprints although he will be
pressed by a number of entrants
who have been around 10 flat and
22 flat this season. Among these
are teammate Frank Herrmann
and Hob Yates and Don Cruick
shank of the Olympic Club.
Young Entered
Another event which promises
some excitement is the javelin
throw which will probably wind
up with Olympic Club throwers
ahead of the field. Favored is
former Olympic champion Cy
Young who has a toss of 242-9 lo
his credit this year. Pressing him
will be former Stanford aces Leo
Long and John Bugge, both of
whom are in the 230-foot class.
Another Olympian, Dick Righter,
has whipped the spear out 218-9.
On the basis o£ previous times
this year, the Indians should pick
up a sweep in the 440. Jim Lut
tit'll. Chuck mce, and Myron Hol
lister are the Stan fords most
likely to succeed although Fred
Jacobs of the Youth Center may
be in the thick of things.
This will be Luttrell's first ap
pearance of the year. The former
hurdling ace has had to forego
the timber topping because of a
gimpy leg, but he has showed
speed in the 440.
Spurrier in BXO
Lon Spurrier, Olympic Club's
world record holder in the 880,
should win that event with 'ease
although teammate Len Simpson
may apply some pressure. Spur
rier also looks like a good bet to
take second place in the mile be
hind another Olympian, Lowell
'/Sellers. Maury Graves will be
Stanford's prime hope to give
tellers and Spurrier a battle.
The high jump could shape up
to be a thriller with four men en
tered capable of climbing 6-7 or
higher. The two favorites will be
the Youth Center's Vern Wilson
and Herman Wyatt.
Wilson has a 6 9 this year and
Wyatt is perenially one of the top
jumpers in the nation. Phil Feh
len, Stanford, and John Razzetto,
Olympic Club, both have been
credited with 6-7 efforts this sea
son.
Flint Challenged
Bill Flint will be Stanford's
hope in the pole vault, but he faces
a rugged task in attempting to
top George Mattos of the Santa
Clarans and Fred Barnes and Ray
Kring of the Olympic Club. Flint
has gove 14 feet, but Mattos and
Barnes are in the 14-6 class, and
Kring has gone 14-2.
Herrmann, Stanford's top broad
jumper, will hold out of that event
because a pulled leg muscle, but
Kent Hansen may pull through
for the Indians. His chief compet
itors figure to be Olympian Tod
Lewis and Santa Claran Emmett
Kirtman.
Stanford is favored in both
hurdle events with Bernie Nelson
in the highs and Chuck Cobb in
the lows. Olympians Ted Rade
maker and Bob Yates and Nelson
will give Cobb a tussle in the race
over the low sticks.
Graves Favorite
Graves will probably pick off a
first for Stanford in the two mile
with Zellers giving him the most
trouble.
Big A 1 Cheney should give the
Indians the shot put, but there
will be a battle for second among
Santa Clarans Billy Wright and
Proverb Jones and Stanford's Ray
Williamson.
Woody Linn of the Youth Cen
ter is the prime favorite in the
discus throw with Indians Jim
Truher and Fred Peters fighting
for the second.

Graves will probably pick off a
first for Stanford in the two mile
with Zellers giving him the most
trouble.
Big A 1 Cheney should give the
Indians the shot put, but there
will be a battle for second among
Santa Clarans Billy Wright and
Proverb Jones and Stanford's Ray
Williamson.
Woody Linn of the Youth Cen
ter is the prime favorite in the
discus throw with Indians Jim
Truher and Fred Peters fighting
for the second.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's
Stanford thinclads take on the
Olympic Club and Santa Clara
County Youth Center in a triangu
lar meet tomorrow in the Stan
lord Stadium. The field events
start at 1:30 with the track events
beginning at 2:00.
Stanford should take the meet
without too much trouble although
Olympic Club and the Youth Ou
ter have some outstanding indi
vidual performer's.
Jim Saras should come up with
a double win for the Indians in
the sprints although he will be
pressed by a number of entrants
who have been around 10 flat and
22 flat this season. Among these
are teammate Frank Herrmann
and Hob Yates and Don Cruick
shank of the Olympic Club.
Young Entered
Another event which promises
some excitement is the javelin
throw which will probably wind
up with Olympic Club throwers
ahead of the field. Favored is
former Olympic champion Cy
Young who has a toss of 242-9 lo
his credit this year. Pressing him
will be former Stanford aces Leo
Long and John Bugge, both of
whom are in the 230-foot class.
Another Olympian, Dick Righter,
has whipped the spear out 218-9.
On the basis o£ previous times
this year, the Indians should pick
up a sweep in the 440. Jim Lut
tit'll. Chuck mce, and Myron Hol
lister are the Stan fords most
likely to succeed although Fred
Jacobs of the Youth Center may
be in the thick of things.
This will be Luttrell's first ap
pearance of the year. The former
hurdling ace has had to forego
the timber topping because of a
gimpy leg, but he has showed
speed in the 440.
Spurrier in BXO
Lon Spurrier, Olympic Club's
world record holder in the 880,
should win that event with 'ease
although teammate Len Simpson
may apply some pressure. Spur
rier also looks like a good bet to
take second place in the mile be
hind another Olympian, Lowell
'/Sellers. Maury Graves will be
Stanford's prime hope to give
tellers and Spurrier a battle.
The high jump could shape up
to be a thriller with four men en
tered capable of climbing 6-7 or
higher. The two favorites will be
the Youth Center's Vern Wilson
and Herman Wyatt.
Wilson has a 6 9 this year and
Wyatt is perenially one of the top
jumpers in the nation. Phil Feh
len, Stanford, and John Razzetto,
Olympic Club, both have been
credited with 6-7 efforts this sea
son.
Flint Challenged
Bill Flint will be Stanford's
hope in the pole vault, but he faces
a rugged task in attempting to
top George Mattos of the Santa
Clarans and Fred Barnes and Ray
Kring of the Olympic Club. Flint
has gove 14 feet, but Mattos and
Barnes are in the 14-6 class, and
Kring has gone 14-2.
Herrmann, Stanford's top broad
jumper, will hold out of that event
because a pulled leg muscle, but
Kent Hansen may pull through
for the Indians. His chief compet
itors figure to be Olympian Tod
Lewis and Santa Claran Emmett
Kirtman.
Stanford is favored in both
hurdle events with Bernie Nelson
in the highs and Chuck Cobb in
the lows. Olympians Ted Rade
maker and Bob Yates and Nelson
will give Cobb a tussle in the race
over the low sticks.
Graves Favorite
Graves will probably pick off a
first for Stanford in the two mile
