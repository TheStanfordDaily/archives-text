INDIAN QUARTER-MILERS Chuck Ince, Bill
Carls, Myron Hollister, and Jim Luttrell will be
running lor a sweep in the 440 in tomorrow's
meet in the Stadium. The foursome will also
team up in the relay event. Dice, the fastest of
the Indians to date, will be hard pressed lo whip
Luttrell and Hollister. Ince and Hollister have
an equally good time at 48.8 this season, and

Luttrell will be competing lor the first time after
being forced out of his specialty, the hurdle
events, because of a leg injury. The former
hurdler has been clocked in 48.7 for the quarter.
Carls' best time this year has been a 49.5. This
will probably be tin* foursome that will carry the
baton for the Cards in tlie forthcoming Big Meet.
