# Grace Kelly Plays Royal Princess Role in 'The Swan'
## Statuesque Carriage, Bean-Pole Proportions; Resembles 'Character with Spinal Paralysis' 
### Stew Toy 
"The Swan," timely picture of outdated pomp and courtly manners,
glides complacently under the protective wings of Grace Kelly's over
worked charms and emerges only for a few feather edged kicks by
Britain's impish Alec Guiness.
Miss Kelly plays a princess of a dying family whose only hope to

regain the lost crown is to marry
her off to the Crown Prince.
Hut when the prince comes on a
courting visit, the princess com
plicates things by falling in love
with her tutor.
Certain embarrassing incidents
follow, all extremely contrived
and contributing to the general
tedious tone of the picture.
Overdone Farce
Thus the meager plot unfolds,
with intrigue after intrigue all but
overshadowing the saving graces
of Alec Guinness.
The few sly digs at royalty that
Guinness manages to put across
in the film's less boring moments
give this over d on e Hollywood
farce more of a tone of satire than
it really deserves.
Agnes Moor ehc a d, as the
prince's domineering mother, also
manages to salvage some humor
from the film's confusion.
Hardly ji Swan
But Louis Jourdan, who plays
the tutor with an astonishing fa
cility for romantic folderol, is in
tolerable.
So is Miss Kelly. Her statuesque
carriage, bean-pole proportions
and unchanging expression make
her less of a swan than a charac
ter in a living tableau with a spi
nal paralysis.
