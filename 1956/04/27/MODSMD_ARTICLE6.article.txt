USC. whose only loss to date
also came from the right arm of
Slang, will be forced to go with
their number three pitcher, Ed
Isherwood. saving their two top
men. Marly Zuanich and Jerry
Parker, for the Indians.
Fehring will use his third pitch
er, Ed Verdurmen, today against
the Broncos, saving Ray Young
and Walt Payne for the big ones
tomorrow. Stanford has won two
from the Santa Clarans so far.
but the last game was a 2-1 squeak
behind the four-hit pitching of
Young, the top CI 13A pitcher.
Split .Needed
The Cards need at least a split
in the Trojan games to stay in
the running. After this weekend
Stanford has one game with San
ta Clara, three games with Cal
and two with USC remaining on
the CIBA schedule. All but one
