# Slang Pitches
## 
### 
USC. whose only loss to date
also came from the right arm of
Slang, will be forced to go with
their number three pitcher, Ed
Isherwood. saving their two top
men. Marly Zuanich and Jerry
Parker, for the Indians.
Fehring will use his third pitch
er, Ed Verdurmen, today against
the Broncos, saving Ray Young
and Walt Payne for the big ones
tomorrow. Stanford has won two
from the Santa Clarans so far.
but the last game was a 2-1 squeak
behind the four-hit pitching of
Young, the top CI 13A pitcher.
Split .Needed
The Cards need at least a split
in the Trojan games to stay in
the running. After this weekend
Stanford has one game with San
ta Clara, three games with Cal
and two with USC remaining on
the CIBA schedule. All but one
C'al game are away Raines.
Stanford will open its regular
lineup, vv i th the possibility of
Young when he is not pitching
playing in center field to add bat
ting punch. Stanford is fourth in
team hitting with a .257 mark,
while USC has ;i .2!t(i average.
The Tro jans' lop rapper is Tony
Santino, player of the year last
season, who is hitting a .032 for
six games. Hud Pritc-hard is sec
ond in the CI HA hit parade with
a .'l5B mark and leads in RBl's
with 12. Kent Iludley, Trojan first
sarker, has three CI HA homers
to his credit.
Mickey Molzman is the top Card
in the C'IHA ha*ting race with a
.3 IS mark. This is two points more
than half of Santino's mark. Hub
Kvans, A 1 Shaw and Hal Messner
are other Cards who are over the
.30(1 mark.
Young, willi a 1-1 league record,
is the KRA leader among pitchers,
with nine or more innings pitched,
and has been the hardest worker,
having pitched 3H'-';, innings out of
Stanford's league total of Go
Hayne's ERA is 6.75, and the
Trojans' Zuanieh has a 2.15) aver
age compared to Young's 1.10.
KXSU will broadcast both USC
games on Sal unlay with Walt
Hrown and Hob Rhodes handling
the microphone chores.


Til HSU TW O IIAKI) THH()VVIN(i righthanders, Walt Payne and
Kd Verdurmen, will take to the mound against Stanford's weekend
foes. Verdurmen, who threw a no-hitter recently, will he toeing
the slab when the Cards face Santa Clara today at Washington
Park in Santa Clara. Payne will start one of the games against
powerful Southern Cal Saturday in the Sunken Diamond. The
three weekend contests rate as crncials as the Cards must win to
day to stay ahead of CSC who trail Stanford by only one-half game
and then get at least a split tomorrow with the Trojans to maintain
that lead.
