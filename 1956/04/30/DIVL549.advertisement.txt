It's HIGH FIDELITY UNLIMITED'S THIRD ANNIVERSARY and
look who celebrates—YOU!! We wanted to be able to feature an out
standing value on this occasion and we are happy to report that our
buyer outdid himself. He brought from Indianapolis, Indiana, the great
tst deal in HIGH FIDELITY UNLIMITED history. He made a special
purchase of 50 Regency FM toners, a tuner which has been selling all
over the United States for $149 and well worth the price. This beautiful
tuner has ten tubes, Foster-Seely discriminator, cathode follower, draft
free AFC, and 5 microvolts sensitivity to insure absolutely quiet reception.
This was not manufactured as a "price" tuner. It is one of the fea
tured items made by the company which makes the famous $1000 amp
lifier. Its appearance, design, the way it is engineered for a life-time of
trouble-free service, plus its amazing performance mark this as a top
quality high fidelity tuner.
We don't know how. but he bought these tuners so that we can sell
them to you for only $64.50 FOB Indianapolis or $67.50 delivered right
in our store where they are now on display.
You don't believe there could be such a tuner for $67.50? Neither
did we. But we ask you to lock at this tuner and buy under these con
ditions: If you don't feel that this is better than any tuner on the market
selling for up to $1 25, bring or ship it back for full refund. There's a 90
day warranty also.
This would make a perfect Mother's Day gift, but you'll have to order
right away as supply is definitely limited.
Mail orders please add 3% California sales tax. Phone orders filled
in order received.
Here's the perfect companion for the Regency FM 100 above:
The Miller High Fidelity Germanium Diode Broadcast Band Tuner.
We've heard it! And we're amazed! All the range and fidelity of FM
on an AM tuner selling for only $20. The reviewers are ecstatic and you
will be too when you hear it. We will make the same offer as on the
Regency above: If you can find a better sounding tuner for under $100
we will cheerfully refund your money. )ust another High Fidtlity Un
limited Third Anniversary special.
AT LAST: We lave in stock for immediate delivery Acoustic Research
AR-1 full range speaker systems ($194,501 plus AR-1W
woofers ($152.50) in all available models including un
finished. These are scarce as hen's teeth but right now they're
stacked right up to the ceiling.
OF COURSE We have a full supply of the Janszen push-pull Electro
static tweeter, companion unit for the AR- IW. Order either
blond $188) or mahogany ($193). So much has been
