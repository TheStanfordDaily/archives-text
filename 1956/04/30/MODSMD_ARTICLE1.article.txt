Olympic champion Cy Young romped down the runway, reared back
and let fly with a javelin toss of 259 feet BV* inches in a quadrangular
meet Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Stanford won the meet, which began as a triangular affair with
the San Francisco Olympic and the Santa Clara Youth Center. Then

three athletes from Fort Old
showed up and were given per
mission to compete. The Indians
finished with 73 2/3 points, OC
with 45 1/3, SCYC with 37 and
Fort Ord with 3.
A seven-way junior college and
freshmen meet held its track
events in the Stadium along with
the varsity.

Franklin (Bud) Held, a former
Stanford athlete, has done better
officially. Held holds the world
record of 268-2% which he set last
year at the Modesto Relays. Bill
Miller, formerly of Arizona State,
has thrown an unofficial 266-10 in
an all-comers meet last year.
Six Indian thinclads bettered or
equalled their all-time bests dur
ing the meet.

three-way tie with the Youth
Center's Vern Wilson and Herm
Wyatt in the high jump with a
leap of 6 feet, 7% inches. It also
