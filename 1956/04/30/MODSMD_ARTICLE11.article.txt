# Primaries Get Underway Today As Smallest Slate of Candidates In 16 Years Faces Its First Test
## Five Polling Places Will Be Open For Student Voters Car Parade Fails, Candidates Show Lack of Interest 
### 
Students will climax one of the
quietest ASSU election campaigns
in many years when they go to
the polls today to vote for 51
ASSU, class and WRA officers in
the primary election.
Five election booths will be open
at Engineering Corner from 8:30
to 3:30 today and 8:30 to 1:30 to
morrow. Final elections will be
held Thursday and Friday.
Election board chairman Chuck
Falkner has pleaded to voters, "If
you have your student body card
out and ready to be punched, it
will only take about two minutes
to cast your ballot."
The last time there were as few
nominees was in 1940, when only
46 candidates were nominated.
End of Campaign
The election marks the end of a
campaign that saw five candidates
in the race for ASSU president at
one time, then had three drop out,
leaving a write-in candidate, Bill
Geyer, to run against the two re
maining candidates, Arthur Bos
worth and Bob Freelen. Bart Hoo
ley's name will remain on the bal
lot, since he dropped out after the
declination period had officfally
ended.
Sue Coshow is running unop
posed for ASSU vice-president. At
the beginning of the week Judy
Babb and Jack Mearns were the
only candidates. Mearns' name
will still appear on the ballot.
Bill Duke is the only candidate
for head yell leader. Brent Leon
ard staged a write-in campaign for
the job, but was declared ineligi
ble because he had less than the
required 75 units.
Lack of Interest
Lack of student interest in the
ASSU candidates expressed itself
in the attendance at the candi
dates' talks at the dormitories.
Sixty attended the candidates'
speeches at Toyon, and 30 came
to Lagunita and Roble. At Stern
and Union there were more candi
dates than audience.
Saturday's scheduled car parade
of candidates was called off be
cause of lack of interest by the
candidates.
All three Women's Recreation
Association positions — president,
vice-president and corresponding
secretary — have only one candi
date. WRA recording secretary
has no nominees. The office will
be determined by a write-in basis
in today's election.
Unopposed Candidates
Candidates for men's row rep
resentative, off-campus represent
ative and Row representative are
running unopposed. There were
no candidates for Union represent
ative, but LASSU in Wednesday's
session removed the ballot from
this year's election.
Four out of seven candidates
will be chosen for men's council,
and three out of four nominees
will be elected to women's council.
Falkner has emphasized that
candidates may run for office on
a write-in basis and may be print
ed on the final ballot if they re
ceive more than two per cent of
the vote. Write-ins may win in the
primary if they receive a majority
of the votes cast.
If write-in candidates make the
final ballot, they must turn in ex
pense slips. All candidates are lim
ited to $10 in campaign expenses,
with the exception of president,
vice-president and head yell lead
er, who may spend $20.
