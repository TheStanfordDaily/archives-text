Editor's Note: This is the
first in a series of two articles
on political activity on the Stan
ford campus, restrictions im
posed by the Founding Grant
and the authorization and
growth of the Political Union as
an agency of political education.

What is the responsibility of a
university in the political educa
tion of its students?
To what degree is a university
administration justified in re
stricting political activity on its
campus and closing its doors to
partisan figures whose thoughts
and words might shed light on the
great political issues of the day?
All university administrations
face this problem in varying de
grees of intensity, the perplexity
of which is only complicated by
restrictions of founding charters
and board of trustees' rulings de
signed to prevent the university
from becoming linked in the pub
lic eye with any partisan figures
or political party.
The recent past has shown stu
dent outbursts on many college
campuses, including the Univer
sity of Washington and several
Southern universities, against
complete curtailment of political
action by the ruling bodies of the
institutions.
Liberal Restrictions
At Stanford, political activity
does not go unfettered; yet the
restrictions are much more liberal
in the sense that the administra
tion looks with favor upon activ

ity and discussions of a "purely
educational" nature.
The frown appears when the
speaker's or group's purpose
transgresses the educational and
stresses the partisan nature of
its purpose, when its goal be
comes aggrandizement of a
party's or candidate's vote in
stead of furtherance of the stu
dents' political development.
The line of demarcation be
tween the two is often hazy, but
progress toward a broadened
scope of political education was
augmented in 1953 with the Board
of Trustees' decision to interpret
the Founding Grant in such a way
as to permit the organization of
a political union led by students
on a non-partisan basis.
Since its approval by the Cali
fornia Legislature and sanction
by the courts in 1885, Mrs. Stan
ford's Founding Grant has out
lawed even the slightest partisan
or sectarian activity on this cam
pus.
It is this document which guides
the Trustees decisions in such
matters, and it is from this grant
that student groups of a sectarian
religious orientation or partisan
political affiliation are forced to
meet off campus.
To assure there will be no direct
tie-in with the University, politi
cal groups refer to themselves
not as the Stanford Young Repub
licans" but "Stanford Area Young
Republicans."
The Grant provides that "the
University must be forever main
tained upon a strictly non-parti
san and non-sectarian basis. It
must never become an instrument
in the hands of any political party
or any religious sect or organiza
tion.
Moral Development
"I believe." Mrs. Stanford said,
"that the moral and religious de
velopment of the University will
be better accomplished if entirely
free from all denominational al
liances. however slight the bond
may be."
Mrs. Stanford further provided
that "no professor shall elec
tioneer among or seek to domi
nate other professors or the stu
dents for the success of any poli
tical party or candidate in any po
litical contest."
She said a professor has as in
trinsic appeal for an audience
simply because he is a professor,
and often his audience will be
lieve he is voicing the views of the
university he is representing.
Complete liberty of speech
must be allowed when the in

dividual is accountable to himself,
she said, but a person "should
keep quiet," when he, wittingly
or unwittingly, creates the decep
tive impression that he is speak
ing for the University.
"The Administration encourag
es students to take part in par
tisan activities off campus," Fred
rick O. Glover, assistant to the
president, said, "and we have high
hopes for the Political Union."
The problem of politically-en
thusiastic students is not the only
one during an election year, he
said, but each four years parties
filter on campus and "violate the
non-partisan spirit of the Univer
sity."
In 1952, the campus was invad
ed by pre-election parades and
sound trucks. Campaigning lit
erature was distributed at foot
ball games.
"During the current election
year," Glover said, "the Presi
dent's office will be in touch with
both party headquarters to re
quest cooperation with Universily
restrictions."
Citing the danger of students
who are overly enthusiastic about
campaigning, Glover said two
years ago two students spent the
night in jail for tearing down a
campaign poster for Harold Tag
gert, Democratic candidate for
Congress from San Mateo County.
