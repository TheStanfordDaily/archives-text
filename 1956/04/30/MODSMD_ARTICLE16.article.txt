# 'Apathy' and the Vote
## 
### 
The TIME FOR STUDENT BODY elections is here
again and with it the usual plea to get out the
vote. The plea is traditionally taken up by the
campus newspaper with the usual "vote as you
please, but please vote" editorial.
Such editorials are most often a waste ol both
the reader's and the writer's time and serve no
constructive purpose for the student body to
whom they are addressed.
The usual lack of interest in campus elec
tions is merely a part of the over-all lack of
interest in student government.
A large voter turnout docs not mean that
such "apathy" in student government has been
overcome, even temporarily. Merely placing ;ui
"X" on a ballot does not make the voter an
interested citizen.
He may be voting because "the guy down
the corridor is running" or because the candi
dates have made whirlwind tours of the campus
in unusual approaches to the voters.
Karely is he voting because he sees in the
vote a chance to express his interest in student
government —an interest that is usually lacking.
During the last presidential election cam
paign (jeorge Ralph brought the so-cii "apa
thetic" students to the polls with his gimmick
filled approach.
The voters came out in record numbers, but
just as soon as they had voted they went back
to their "apathy" — as did president-elect
Ralph, who has run the student government
in an adequate, hut hardly unique or outstand
ing manner.
W hat lies behind the "apathy" toward stu
dent government is the very operation of that
government. The officers of the Associated Stu
dents do not actually preside over or lead a
student body.
The individual student is not touched by
student government, hence he does not care for
whom he votes —or if he votes at all. The candi
dates are mere names with whom he will never
have any direct contact.
I bis is a necessary situation in a professional

government, simply because of 1 lie size of the
area which it governs be it a city, a state or
a nation. Hot it is certainly not necessary in a
student government and one to which hardly
more than 70(10 students belong.
The individual student's interests will l>e
served by and through his own special interest
group leadership—if not directly, at least in
directly through proposals submitted to ASS Li
Legislature for the customary automatic ap
proval.
Students may he happy with this situation,
and, if they are, then we see no reason for a
change, since a government is supposedly oper
ated on the wishes of the majority.
But if ''apathy" is to he removed from stu
dent government, there would seem to he one
sure method: Make the student feel his student
government—not just once a year through elec
tion campaigns, hut throughout the whole year
by giving the student government leadership
more contact with the individual student, by
giving that leadership more responsibility,
more concrete things to do.
Take the Student Legislature: 99 per cent of
its time is concerned with either writing or
approving new constitutions and bylaws and in
directing elections. >
Most of a student legislature's time should
not be taken up with such business, which is
merely a base for the action il should he taking.
Elections, coustilulitCMS and bylaws should be
tin; foundation for action, not tlx* end-all and
do-all of that action.
If the reason for a vote is to end "apathy"—
and we think it should be—and if the voter sees
in a candidate one who will help bring about
such an apathy-ending situation, we urge him
If) vote. Otherwise such a vote will he merely
an "X" on a piece of paper. It will be a vote
to continue "apathw"
Voting will not end "apathy" in student gov
ernment, but a proper use of the mandate pro
vided by that vote will —if students do indeed
want an end to this "apathy."
