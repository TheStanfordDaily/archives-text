# Pub Rel Hoard Conducts Poll On Apathy in Student Activities
## Hundreds Questioned, 80% Feel Activities Can Help Those Who Participate in Them 
### Barbara Bachman 
"Student aetivities are definite
ly <« value to those who partici
pate in them."
This was the answer given by
80 per cent of a sample contacted
in a poll conducted last week by !
the Public Relations Board.
In an effort to determine stu
dents' familiarity with their gov
ernment, questionnaires were dis
tributed to several hundred stu
dent s in all classes and living
groups. They consisted of objec
tive and essay-type questions.
Co-chairmen Hall Seely afnd Ma
ry Kay Bronson expressed ap
proval and satisfaction over the
results and attitudes resulting
from the inquiry. They expect
that the information gained will
be both helpful and enlightening
in setting up government policies
for the next school year.
Contradictory Answers
In light of the current storm of
"apathy" charges, the poll reveal
ed seemingly contradictory an
swers.
Q. "Did you plan to enter stu
/lent activities when you enrolled
as a freshman?"
A. 90 per cent—"Yes."
Q. "Have you participated in
any such activities since you en
rolled?" t
A. 60 per cent—"Yes."
Q. "Do you feel that these ac
tivities are definitely of value to
those who participate in them?"
A. 80 per cor. 1- -"Yes."
Probable reasons for the above
results were offered by John Mc-
Kelvy, chairman of the Public Re
lations Board. He said that per
haps students are more interested
and involved in house, wing and
dorm activities, ignoring the main
public offices which have recently
been involved with the "apathy"
charge.
This is possibly supported with
the answers to the following ques
tions:

Q. "How familiar are you with
the structure aud operation of
your student government?
A. 15 per cent, very familiar;
40 per cent, slightly familiar; and
45 per cent, hardly at all.
Q. "Have you received adequate
information concerning student
government activities?"
A. 80 per cent—"No."
Eighty per rent of the students
feel that "student government ac
tivities tend to be monopolized by
a small group of students."

present form of government are:
