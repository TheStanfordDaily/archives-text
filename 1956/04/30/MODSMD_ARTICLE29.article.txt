# Employers Are Competing For '56, ’57 Graduates
## Engineers, M.B.A.'s, Technicians Most Wanted Graduates, According to Placement Service 
### Rich Brown 
Are you graduating this year?
Next year? If so, it's a great
time to be getting out.
Employers are competing for
college graduates more than they
ever have before. Topping the list
of most-wanted graduates are en
gineers, M.B.A.'s and technicians.
In order to help students and
employers know more about each
other, Stanford maintains a cen
tralized Placement Service in
Building 1, Inner Quad. Dr. Eu
gene VV. Dils is director of the
service.
Any employer may use the
Placement Service facilities. The
service is divided into four parts:
business and technical placement,
teacher placement, educational
administrative and supervisory
placement, and the Student Em
ployment Office which handles
temporary and part-time, includ
ing summer, jobs.
Divisions United
Prior to 1946 each department
maintained its own placement di
vision. Under President Donald
B. Tresidder all these divisions
were brought together.
Some schools such as Law and
Medicine continue to operate their
own placement services which co
operate with but are independent
of the centralized office.
"In addition to the placement of
men in technical I'ielYls, we also
have quite a brisk business in the
placement of Stanford women,"
said Dils.
Last year,' for example, a
woman math major who regis
tered with Placement Service was
snatched up by an airplane com
pany, for computing work.
Present Demand
Present demand for college
grads is brought op by two main
factors, Dils explained.
First, because of the rapid
economy expansion more skilled
personnel are sorely needed. At
Ihe same time, less people are
available because the deprssion of
the '30s sharply cut the birth rate.
Coupled with these are other
social problems. The draft law,
for instance, forces many young
men to postpone their industrial
careers or take time out from
them once they have joined a
company.
In six short years the employ
ment conditions have drastically
changed. One example is in re
gard to graduating engineers.
Fortune magazine reports that
the number of engineering grads
in the United States has dropped
almost half—from 53,000 in 1950
to an estimated 30,000 in 1956.
Salaries
Salaries have, of course, soared
Stanford Placement Service
tries to achieve the best place
ment possible through its elabo
rate system of files.
For a total of $1, the student—
or alumnus if he's looking-for a
better job—may be active with
the Service for a year.
A file showing the student's
courses, extracurricular activities
and other information is main
tained. Then when a student
wishes to interview a prospective
employer, he merely requests that
his file be shown to the employer.
This saves hours of filling out

forms which would be required if
the interview were arranged pri
vately. Another Placement Serv
ice time-saver is photostating
machine.
Representatives
Companies send representatives
to campus at scheduled times. A
list is run in The Daily the day
before the campus visits. This
gives the student a chance to sign
the schedule in the office and se
lect a special time for his inter
view.
Anyone may sign an interview
schedule whether or not he is
registered with the Placement
Service. Those already registered
are saved much time since the
complete file on them is already
available.
'We don't coach students for
interviewing," said Dils. "Some
schools place so much emphasis
on 'proper performance' that an
artificial barrier is erected be
tween interviewer and inter
viewee at the time of their talk."
Military Service
Dils advises all men who plan
to enter military service upon
graduation to register with the
Placement Service, and assemble
statements from their major pro
fessors while the profs remember
them.
Upon their discharge, the Place
ment Service will be able to tell
them of current conditions in the
job market and will assist in lo
cating a civilian job.
Concerning military service,
Dils said: "Although three years
now seem like a lifetime, they will
be over before one can realize it."

Stanford Placement Service
tries to achieve the best place
ment possible through its elabo
rate system of files.
For a total of $1, the student—
or alumnus if he's looking-for a
better job—may be active with
the Service for a year.
A file showing the student's
courses, extracurricular activities
and other information is main
tained. Then when a student
wishes to interview a prospective
employer, he merely requests that
his file be shown to the employer.
This saves hours of filling out

forms which would be required if
the interview were arranged pri
vately. Another Placement Serv
ice time-saver is photostating
machine.
Representatives
Companies send representatives
to campus at scheduled times. A
list is run in The Daily the day
before the campus visits. This
gives the student a chance to sign
the schedule in the office and se
lect a special time for his inter
view.
Anyone may sign an interview
schedule whether or not he is
registered with the Placement
Service. Those already registered
are saved much time since the
complete file on them is already
available.
'We don't coach students for
interviewing," said Dils. "Some
schools place so much emphasis
on 'proper performance' that an
artificial barrier is erected be
tween interviewer and inter
viewee at the time of their talk."
Military Service
Dils advises all men who plan
to enter military service upon
graduation to register with the
Placement Service, and assemble
statements from their major pro
fessors while the profs remember
them.
Upon their discharge, the Place
ment Service will be able to tell
them of current conditions in the
job market and will assist in lo
cating a civilian job.
Concerning military service,
Dils said: "Although three years
now seem like a lifetime, they will
be over before one can realize it."
Are you graduating this year?
Next year? If so, it's a great
time to be getting out.
Employers are competing for
college graduates more than they
ever have before. Topping the list
of most-wanted graduates are en
gineers, M.B.A.'s and technicians.
In order to help students and
employers know more about each
other, Stanford maintains a cen
tralized Placement Service in
Building 1, Inner Quad. Dr. Eu
gene VV. Dils is director of the
service.
Any employer may use the
Placement Service facilities. The
service is divided into four parts:
business and technical placement,
teacher placement, educational
administrative and supervisory
placement, and the Student Em
ployment Office which handles
temporary and part-time, includ
ing summer, jobs.
Divisions United
Prior to 1946 each department
maintained its own placement di
vision. Under President Donald
B. Tresidder all these divisions
were brought together.
Some schools such as Law and
Medicine continue to operate their
own placement services which co
operate with but are independent
of the centralized office.
"In addition to the placement of
men in technical I'ielYls, we also
have quite a brisk business in the
placement of Stanford women,"
said Dils.
Last year,' for example, a
woman math major who regis
tered with Placement Service was
snatched up by an airplane com
pany, for computing work.
Present Demand
Present demand for college
grads is brought op by two main
factors, Dils explained.
First, because of the rapid
economy expansion more skilled
personnel are sorely needed. At
Ihe same time, less people are
available because the deprssion of
the '30s sharply cut the birth rate.
Coupled with these are other
social problems. The draft law,
for instance, forces many young
men to postpone their industrial
careers or take time out from
them once they have joined a
company.
In six short years the employ
ment conditions have drastically
changed. One example is in re
gard to graduating engineers.
Fortune magazine reports that
the number of engineering grads
in the United States has dropped
almost half—from 53,000 in 1950
