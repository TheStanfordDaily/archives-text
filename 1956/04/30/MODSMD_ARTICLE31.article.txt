# Cap and Gown Panel Discusses 'Role of the RA'
## 
### 
A panel discussion to clarify
and evaluate "The Role of the
Resident Assistant" was spon
sored recently by Cap and Gown,
senior women's honorary society.
The discussion was part of the
organization's preparation for an
educational program for fresh
men women, scheduled for May
14 and 21.
Dr. Helen Schrader, assistant
professor of speech, drama and
education was the moderator.
Panel members included Cap
and Gown members Jo Davis,
Dottie Dunham, Connie Schulz
and Claudette Yeoman and resi
dent assistants Jean Bailey, Jane
Cosgrove, Pat Crawford, Pat Dob
son, Patsie Lovell and Bev Miles.
The role of the RA was defined
as a technical administrator, an
adult satisfying the demands of
society and parents, a liason offi
cer between the administration
and women students and a coun
selor.
Panel members commented on
the ambiguity in the "liaison" re
lationship, citing that students do
not understand the responsibility
and authority the RA has for
student actions.
Panelists also felt students
think RA's do not express their
own opinions, substituting in their
stead what the University thinks.
