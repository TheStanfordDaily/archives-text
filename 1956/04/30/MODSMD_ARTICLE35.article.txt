# NAACP Carries On Negro Drive for 1st-Class Citizenship, Requests Open Democracy Doors
## 
### Wally Simpson 
"Mr. President, Mr. President,
your Negro citizens stand on the
steps of their White House, ask
ing that the doors of democracy
be opened so that they can come
in."
And a spontaneous statement
made on the steps of the White
House by Roscoe Conglink Sim
mons, President of the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored Peoples, in 1929 be
came the symbol of the drive for
"first-class" citizenship for Negro
citizens of America.
Simmons was visiting the White
House to present a list of griev
ances to President Hoover in a
year when lynching was at its
height. This was his question to a
President that refused to see him
or listen to his cause.
The organization he headed
came into being in 1909 following
a bloody race riot in Illinois the
previous year. A group of people
in and around New York who
were interested in the race prob
lems came together to study the
problems of race discrimination
in labor and society.
On February 12, 1909, this
group, led by such people as Mary
Ovington White, a social worker
in Harlem; Oswald Garrison Vil
lard, editor of the New York Her
ald; and John Haynes Holmes,
pastor of the Unitarian Church,
met at Coopers Building to dis
cuss ways to aid Negroes. Out
of this meeting NAACP was
formed.
One Negro Only
Incorporated in the State of
New York the new organization
had on its board only one Negro,
Dr. W. E. Burghardt Du Bois,
professor of history and econom
ics at Atlanta University, and an
outspoken critic of Booker T.
Washington's claim that the
Negro should make the best out
of his situation rather than at
tack the basis of the Negro's prob
lems. This was because there
were few Negroes trained for
administrative work.
Du Bois was assigned the job
of putting out the NAACP's offi
cial organ, "The Crisis," which be
came an immediate success with
a subscription rate of 12,000 be
fore the end of the first year.
Moorfield Storey, an attorney
from Boston and president of the
Bar Association, was the first
president of the NAACP. Storey
consistantly urged a policy of
agitation by colored peoples as
the only method for securing their
rights.
The principal aims of the new
organization were to influence

legislation and to make use of the
courts to obtain redress for Negro
citizens. The NAACP's greatest
success came through the courts.
Money was raised to provide ex
penses for hiring the best lawyers
possible to defend Negroes who
were being "railroaded" into con
victions. Their first case was of
a Negro charged with murder in
Ashbury Park, New Jersey. Three
days after the lawyer had been
provided the Negro was free.
Thereafter NAACP's reputation
was established and cases involv
ing Negroes in the New York area
were almost sure to be repre
sented by NAACP lawyers.
Supreme Court Case
NAACP's first Supreme Court
case involved the "grandfather"
clause in Oklahoma's voting reg
istration laws. Storey represent
ed the plaintive and through the
efforts of NAACP was able to get
the clause declared unconstitu
tional.
More and more cases began to
appear in courts with NAACP
fighting to secure the rights of
Negroes and to end segregation
in the United States. These court
battles culminated in the school
segregation ruling in 1954.
NAACP was never conceived
of as a mass membership organi
zation. Instead, it was just a

combination of liberal whites and
"that intellectual tenth" of the
Negro race. However, prominent
Negroes began taking over lead
ership of NAACP as membership
increased rapidly over the years.
It is now close to 500,000,
NAACP is prohibited by its
constitution from supporting any
group that considers racial segre
gation laws
