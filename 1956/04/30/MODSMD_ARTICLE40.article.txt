The freshman baseball squad
won their ninth game of the sea
son Saturday on the frosh dia
mond when they defeated the
strong Sacred Heart High team
from San Francisco, 4-1. The Pap

Clegg's charges were never in
trouble behind the pitching of
lefty Joel Mogy. They scored their
first run in the third and added
three more in the seventh.
In the third inning, second-base
man Tom Schilling led off with a
long triple to left-center and was
driven in with a sharp single by
first-baseman Joel Newkirk.
In the Papoose seventh, center
fielder Harry Rodda singled after
the visitors had two outs and was
driven in a moment later by a
triple off the bat of right-fielder
Mike Lindeman that almost clear
ed the left-field barrier.
Stanford catcher Art von Wron
ski punched out a single to score
Lindeman and was driven across
himself by another Schilling tri
ple.
Sacred Heart failed to score un
til their half of the ninth when,
with one away, Mike Soto got a
single and was advanced to second
on the fielder's choice.
Bud Tripaldi, hitting for Sacred
Heart pitcher George Alvarado,
delivered the bacon with an RBT
single to lefi that gave the visitors
their only tally.
Sacred Heart's lone run was the
first earned run in 38 innings that
Mogy has given up, with the ex
ception of the Campbell High
game in which he relieved in the
ninth inning. ■
