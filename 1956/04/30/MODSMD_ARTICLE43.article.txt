ahead of the always-threatening
Middlecoff.
Gene won the $10,000 first prize
for the second straight year with
his sterling four-day performance
—but he won If In't have been in
the first 10 if it hadn't been for
one of the finest putting shows

ing, Middlecoff couldn't gain. 110

of 75-70-74-69 for a 288. That was
good for $2,200.
