# Are You Hungry? It's the Clock
## 
### 
If you felt hungry all day
yesterday because you found
out your dining hall wasn't serv
ing breakfast, it's not because
Stanford cooks and hashers are
on strike.
It's your clock. Yes, clock.
C-L-O-C-K. Daylight-saving time
started yesterday — or, to be
more exact, at 1 a.m. yesterday
morning —to the great confu
sion of the masses.
Perforce, if you haven't al
ready done so, be a conformist
and set your clock ahead one
hour. Catch up with the rest of
California. You didn't need that
extra hour of sleep anyway.
