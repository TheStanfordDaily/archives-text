# 3 ASSU Presidential Aspirants Take a Stand on 9 Top Issues
## The 						Candidates Answer 
### 
The Issues
Editor's Note: The Daily has
queried tl>i* three ASSU presiden
tial aspirants as to their feelings
on ten issues of vital interest to
the students who will be voting
in the upcoming* election.
The candidates were given a list
of questions pertaining to these
issues, and I hey were asked to
hand in one paragraph replies to
each, to be published today, on the
f irst day of spring elections.
The issues, the questions and
the answers follow:
THE ROLE
What do you consider to be the
role of student government at
Stanford?
CONSTITUTION
What would you base your gov
ernment on? Manifested student
desire or on a strict interpretation
of the ASSU Constitution?
COMMITTEE USE
Are ASSU committees being
used properly? How would you
use them? Or are there too many?
PARTICIPATION
Are there enough students out
side the regular officers working
in stud e n t government? How
would you bring more in?
APATHY "CURE"
Last year 114 candidates ran for
ASSU and class offices. This year
there were 55 nominees. What do
you think is the cause of this ap
parent student apathy toward stu
dent government, and what
you do to cure this condition?
REPRESENTATION
Is student government really
representing the student or mere
ly an exercise for those in its ad
ministration?
LEGISLATURE
What do you think the role of
the ASSU Legislature should be in
student government? I)o you be
lieve it has been a mere parlia
m< ntary debating society this
year?
A DM INISTR A TIV E ASSIST A NT
The office of administrative as
sistant to the president has now
had one year's trial. Would you
put it to the same use next year,
or would you change the duties of
this office?
traffic: problem
The parking and traffic prob
lem has been discussed a lot this
year. Do you have any specific
plans regarding the problem next

The role of student government
at Stanford is to give the student
a voice and opportunity to partici
pate in a variety of activities un
der ASSU.
I have no intention of changing
the present constitution. I feel it
is an effective piece of machinery,
but I do intend to make use of
public opinion polls to a great ex
tent. The results of these polls
can be worked out quite thorough
ly through the ASSU Constitution.
Any administration reserves the
right to examine the effectiveness
of ASSU committees in terms of
the administration's objectives. By
and large, the present committees
are useful, but broader interests
should be stressed as outlined in
my platform.
*
Any effective student govern
ment requires as many partici
pants as possible. I believe that a
personal approach through public
opinion polls will help dramatize
the problems of student govern
ment.
The causes of student apathy
are too numerous and complex to
cite in detail here. But the trend
toward mediocrity and excessive
conformity must be reversed. 1
Bringing about the latter will cure
the former. It is my intention to
attack both these problems vigor-'
ously. My entire platform is di-i
rected at overcoming student ap
athy by providing the necessary
stimulus.
While there are many excellent
committees with hard - working
people, some will undoubtedly re
quire overhauling.
/
The ultimate role of the Legis
lature is to put into effect the stu
dent's desire. Since the new con
stitution is only a year old, it is
too early to assess its effective
ness.
I intend to make full use of the
office of administrative assistant.
This problem is primarily the
problem of the University admin
istration, but the student body
through the ASSU should be con
sulted.

At Stanford, student govern
ment should reflect ideas and de
sires of the students to the admin
istrative officials of the Univer
sity. It should provide the mechan
ics for planning and executing
student activities.
. I would base my government on
a combination of both. The con
stitution is supposed to represent
manifested student desire, but this
has not always been the case.
Therefore, current student desire
must be given serious considera
tion.
I would try to emphasize the
service aspects of ASSU commit
tees. Some examples: Foreign
scholarship, Cardinals hostel pro
gram, Traffic Committee, etc. A
comprehensive study of commit
tees is being made. Until this
study is completed (probably
within the next two weeks), state
ments pertaining to the useful
ness or excessiveness of commit
tees are worthless speculation.
Since there is a problem of at
tracting an adequate number of
students to try out for commit
tees, I would assume student gov
ernment is satisfying the inter
ested people. Because we do not
have facilities to bring more in, I
believe the answer rests with the
Tresidder Memorial Union. The
faster the Union is constructed,
the faster we will have more stu
dents and more interest in student
government.
I believe the problem centers in
the following areas: 1) Current
facilities are less than desirable,
2) The election system discour
ages a stimulating campaign by
forcing candidates to conduct a
personalized campaign over 60
living groups or 3000 people in
eight days, 3) The level of student
awareness is at an ebb, and 4)
Communication between ASSU
and students never has been culti
vated.
Currently student government
does not represent the students.
But it is more than an exercise for
the participantsi With proper lead
ership of the Legislature and Cab
inet, student interests could be
properly represented.
r
In addition to problems within
its jurisdiction, the Legislature
should convey student desires or
criticism to the president so that
he may effectively act as a liaison
between students and administra
tive officials. It should also be
used as a sounding board for
ASSU and University policies. It
has not functioned efficiently this
year.
I would not allow the adminis
trative assistant's job to assume
the proportions of the past year.
Otherwise I have no suggestions
until I have had an opportunity,
if elected, to evaluate the situa
tion from the president's chair.
The Traffic Committee is cur
rently compiling statistics in or
der to make a comprehensive re
port of the problem. Until the sta
tistics are completed, I see no rea
son to speculate. I would be very
happy to make an evaluation once
the report is published.

Student government at S t a n
ford exists to help the administra
tion administer student affairs in
areas where the students them
selves often are in a better posi
tion to understand the problems
than the administration.
I believe student desire should
take precedence over strict consti
tutional interpretation. The con
stitution was only drawn up to be
a codification of the wishes of the
students, and it is ridiculous to
use it as an instrument to frus
trate these wishes when they un
dergo substantial changes.
By and large, I think the com
mittees are doing about as well as
could be expected. I would, how
ever, like to see issues more thor
oughly defined in committees so
that the Legislature does not have
to waste so much time debating
minor points when these issues
reach its floor. There are about
enough committees in extracurric
ular activities, but I do advocate
several new ones to aid academic
affairs.
Again there are about enough
avid enthusiasts in the extracur
ricular side of student govern
ment, but there should be more
encouragement toward those who
would only like to do some small
job. I think, on the academic side,
it will prove easier for a student
to be a part-time participant in
student government, in direct con
nection with his academic inter
ests, so the response here should
be quite favorable.
Apathy is a positive protest by
the students against the failure of
student government to realize that
it is just student government. This
results in much bitterness and in
efficiency. The students feel that
their votes are useless because
government has been isolated into
the hands of a small group who
run government more than their
own ideas, rather than trying to
adhere to lines which will be most
in accord with the desires of the
majority of the students. The only
way to cure this is to realize the
limitations of student government
and run the open-minded and ef
ficient government in which there
is really "something for every
body."
Student government at present
tends more to be an exercise for
those in it and less of a true repre
sentation of the needs and desires
of the student body. It should have
both of these functions, but at
present the most important one
tends to be almost ignored by
those in control,
The Legislature is the law-mak
ing body of the government, and
as such it should be to some de
gree a mere rubber stamp on com
mittee actions, and it should act
quietly and with consideration
upon measures and dispense with
the parliamentary red-tape, bick
ering and haggling over minor
points which have often marked it
this year and only served to make
it appear ridiculous in the eyes of
the students.
The administrative assistant to
the president is an excellent job
and should continue to do the
busy work and red-tape cutting—
which appear to be a semi-neces
sary evil of any government—for
the president.
I would attempt to get down to
cases with the administration and
work out a solution which would
be satisfactory to both it and the
students, if such a thing exists.
Traffic Com has existed for a year
without doing so. I also see no
particular reason why the road
past Lagunita should continue to
inconvenience students in being
closed.

of questions pertaining to these
issues, and I hey were asked to
hand in one paragraph replies to
each, to be published today, on the
f irst day of spring elections.
The issues, the questions and
the answers follow:
THE ROLE
What do you consider to be the
role of student government at
Stanford?
CONSTITUTION
What would you base your gov
ernment on? Manifested student
desire or on a strict interpretation
of the ASSU Constitution?
COMMITTEE USE
Are ASSU committees being
used properly? How would you
use them? Or are there too many?
PARTICIPATION
Are there enough students out
side the regular officers working
in stud e n t government? How
would you bring more in?
APATHY "CURE"
Last year 114 candidates ran for
ASSU and class offices. This year
there were 55 nominees. What do
you think is the cause of this ap
parent student apathy toward stu
dent government, and what
you do to cure this condition?
REPRESENTATION
Is student government really
representing the student or mere
ly an exercise for those in its ad
ministration?
LEGISLATURE
What do you think the role of
the ASSU Legislature should be in
student government? I)o you be
lieve it has been a mere parlia
m< ntary debating society this
year?
A DM INISTR A TIV E ASSIST A NT
The office of administrative as
sistant to the president has now
had one year's trial. Would you
put it to the same use next year,
or would you change the duties of
this office?
traffic: problem
The parking and traffic prob
lem has been discussed a lot this
year. Do you have any specific
plans regarding the problem next

The role of student government
at Stanford is to give the student
a voice and opportunity to partici
pate in a variety of activities un
der ASSU.
I have no intention of changing
the present constitution. I feel it
is an effective piece of machinery,
but I do intend to make use of
public opinion polls to a great ex
tent. The results of these polls
can be worked out quite thorough
ly through the ASSU Constitution.
Any administration reserves the
right to examine the effectiveness
of ASSU committees in terms of
the administration's objectives. By
and large, the present committees
are useful, but broader interests
should be stressed as outlined in
my platform.
*
Any effective student govern
ment requires as many partici
pants as possible. I believe that a
personal approach through public
opinion polls will help dramatize
the problems of student govern
ment.
The causes of student apathy
are too numerous and complex to
cite in detail here. But the trend
toward mediocrity and excessive
conformity must be reversed. 1
Bringing about the latter will cure
the former. It is my intention to
attack both these problems vigor-'
ously. My entire platform is di-i
rected at overcoming student ap
athy by providing the necessary
stimulus.
While there are many excellent
committees with hard - working
people, some will undoubtedly re
quire overhauling.
/
The ultimate role of the Legis
lature is to put into effect the stu
dent's desire. Since the new con
stitution is only a year old, it is
too early to assess its effective
ness.
I intend to make full use of the
office of administrative assistant.
This problem is primarily the
problem of the University admin
istration, but the student body
through the ASSU should be con
sulted.

At Stanford, student govern
ment should reflect ideas and de
sires of the students to the admin
istrative officials of the Univer
sity. It should provide the mechan
ics for planning and executing
student activities.
. I would base my government on
a combination of both. The con
stitution is supposed to represent
manifested student desire, but this
has not always been the case.
Therefore, current student desire
must be given serious considera
tion.
I would try to emphasize the
service aspects of ASSU commit
tees. Some examples: Foreign
scholarship, Cardinals hostel pro
gram, Traffic Committee, etc. A
comprehensive study of commit
tees is being made. Until this
study is completed (probably
within the next two weeks), state
ments pertaining to the useful
ness or excessiveness of commit
tees are worthless speculation.
Since there is a problem of at
tracting an adequate number of
students to try out for commit
tees, I would assume student gov
ernment is satisfying the inter
ested people. Because we do not
have facilities to bring more in, I
believe the answer rests with the
Tresidder Memorial Union. The
faster the Union is constructed,
the faster we will have more stu
dents and more interest in student
government.
I believe the problem centers in
the following areas: 1) Current
facilities are less than desirable,
2) The election system discour
ages a stimulating campaign by
forcing candidates to conduct a
personalized campaign over 60
living groups or 3000 people in
eight days, 3) The level of student
awareness is at an ebb, and 4)
Communication between ASSU
and students never has been culti
vated.
Currently student government
does not represent the students.
But it is more than an exercise for
the participantsi With proper lead
ership of the Legislature and Cab
inet, student interests could be
properly represented.
r
In addition to problems within
its jurisdiction, the Legislature
should convey student desires or
criticism to the president so that
he may effectively act as a liaison
between students and administra
tive officials. It should also be
used as a sounding board for
ASSU and University policies. It
has not functioned efficiently this
year.
I would not allow the adminis
trative assistant's job to assume
the proportions of the past year.
Otherwise I have no suggestions
until I have had an opportunity,
if elected, to evaluate the situa
tion from the president's chair.
The Traffic Committee is cur
rently compiling statistics in or
der to make a comprehensive re
port of the problem. Until the sta
tistics are completed, I see no rea
son to speculate. I would be very
happy to make an evaluation once
the report is published.

Student government at S t a n
ford exists to help the administra
tion administer student affairs in
areas where the students them
selves often are in a better posi
tion to understand the problems
than the administration.
I believe student desire should
take precedence over strict consti
tutional interpretation. The con
stitution was only drawn up to be
a codification of the wishes of the
students, and it is ridiculous to
use it as an instrument to frus
trate these wishes when they un
dergo substantial changes.
By and large, I think the com
mittees are doing about as well as
could be expected. I would, how
ever, like to see issues more thor
oughly defined in committees so
that the Legislature does not have
to waste so much time debating
minor points when these issues
reach its floor. There are about
enough committees in extracurric
ular activities, but I do advocate
several new ones to aid academic
affairs.
Again there are about enough
avid enthusiasts in the extracur
ricular side of student govern
ment, but there should be more
encouragement toward those who
would only like to do some small
job. I think, on the academic side,
it will prove easier for a student
to be a part-time participant in
student government, in direct con
nection with his academic inter
ests, so the response here should
be quite favorable.
Apathy is a positive protest by
the students against the failure of
student government to realize that
it is just student government. This
results in much bitterness and in
efficiency. The students feel that
their votes are useless because
government has been isolated into
the hands of a small group who
run government more than their
own ideas, rather than trying to
adhere to lines which will be most
in accord with the desires of the
majority of the students. The only
way to cure this is to realize the
limitations of student government
and run the open-minded and ef
ficient government in which there
is really "something for every
body."
Student government at present
tends more to be an exercise for
those in it and less of a true repre
sentation of the needs and desires
of the student body. It should have
both of these functions, but at
present the most important one
tends to be almost ignored by
those in control,
The Legislature is the law-mak
ing body of the government, and
as such it should be to some de
gree a mere rubber stamp on com
mittee actions, and it should act
quietly and with consideration
upon measures and dispense with
the parliamentary red-tape, bick
ering and haggling over minor
points which have often marked it
this year and only served to make
it appear ridiculous in the eyes of
the students.
The administrative assistant to
the president is an excellent job
and should continue to do the
busy work and red-tape cutting—
which appear to be a semi-neces
sary evil of any government—for
the president.
I would attempt to get down to
cases with the administration and
work out a solution which would
be satisfactory to both it and the
students, if such a thing exists.
Traffic Com has existed for a year
without doing so. I also see no
particular reason why the road
past Lagunita should continue to
inconvenience students in being
closed.

CONSTITUTION
What would you base your gov
ernment on? Manifested student
desire or on a strict interpretation
of the ASSU Constitution?
COMMITTEE USE
Are ASSU committees being
used properly? How would you
use them? Or are there too many?
PARTICIPATION
Are there enough students out
side the regular officers working
in stud e n t government? How
would you bring more in?
APATHY "CURE"
Last year 114 candidates ran for
ASSU and class offices. This year
there were 55 nominees. What do
you think is the cause of this ap
parent student apathy toward stu
dent government, and what
you do to cure this condition?
REPRESENTATION
Is student government really
representing the student or mere
ly an exercise for those in its ad
ministration?
LEGISLATURE
What do you think the role of
the ASSU Legislature should be in
student government? I)o you be
lieve it has been a mere parlia
m< ntary debating society this
year?
A DM INISTR A TIV E ASSIST A NT
The office of administrative as

had one year's trial. Would you
put it to the same use next year,
or would you change the duties of
this office?

The parking and traffic prob

The role of student government
at Stanford is to give the student
a voice and opportunity to partici
pate in a variety of activities un
der ASSU.
I have no intention of changing
the present constitution. I feel it
is an effective piece of machinery,
but I do intend to make use of
public opinion polls to a great ex
tent. The results of these polls
can be worked out quite thorough
ly through the ASSU Constitution.
Any administration reserves the
right to examine the effectiveness
of ASSU committees in terms of
the administration's objectives. By
and large, the present committees
are useful, but broader interests
should be stressed as outlined in
my platform.
*
Any effective student govern
ment requires as many partici
pants as possible. I believe that a
personal approach through public
opinion polls will help dramatize
the problems of student govern
ment.
The causes of student apathy
are too numerous and complex to
cite in detail here. But the trend
toward mediocrity and excessive
conformity must be reversed. 1
Bringing about the latter will cure
the former. It is my intention to
attack both these problems vigor-'
ously. My entire platform is di-i
rected at overcoming student ap
athy by providing the necessary
stimulus.
While there are many excellent
committees with hard - working
people, some will undoubtedly re
quire overhauling.
/
The ultimate role of the Legis
lature is to put into effect the stu
dent's desire. Since the new con
stitution is only a year old, it is
too early to assess its effective
ness.
I intend to make full use of the
office of administrative assistant.
This problem is primarily the
problem of the University admin
istration, but the student body
through the ASSU should be con
sulted.

At Stanford, student govern
ment should reflect ideas and de
sires of the students to the admin
istrative officials of the Univer
sity. It should provide the mechan
ics for planning and executing
student activities.
. I would base my government on
a combination of both. The con
stitution is supposed to represent
manifested student desire, but this
has not always been the case.
Therefore, current student desire
must be given serious considera
tion.
I would try to emphasize the
service aspects of ASSU commit
tees. Some examples: Foreign
scholarship, Cardinals hostel pro
gram, Traffic Committee, etc. A
comprehensive study of commit
tees is being made. Until this
study is completed (probably
within the next two weeks), state
ments pertaining to the useful
ness or excessiveness of commit
tees are worthless speculation.
Since there is a problem of at
tracting an adequate number of
students to try out for commit
tees, I would assume student gov
ernment is satisfying the inter
ested people. Because we do not
have facilities to bring more in, I
believe the answer rests with the
Tresidder Memorial Union. The
faster the Union is constructed,
the faster we will have more stu
dents and more interest in student
government.
I believe the problem centers in
the following areas: 1) Current
facilities are less than desirable,
2) The election system discour
ages a stimulating campaign by
forcing candidates to conduct a
personalized campaign over 60
living groups or 3000 people in
eight days, 3) The level of student
awareness is at an ebb, and 4)
Communication between ASSU
and students never has been culti
vated.
Currently student government
does not represent the students.
But it is more than an exercise for
the participantsi With proper lead
ership of the Legislature and Cab
inet, student interests could be
properly represented.
r
In addition to problems within
its jurisdiction, the Legislature
should convey student desires or
criticism to the president so that
he may effectively act as a liaison
between students and administra
tive officials. It should also be
used as a sounding board for
ASSU and University policies. It
has not functioned efficiently this
year.
I would not allow the adminis
trative assistant's job to assume
the proportions of the past year.
Otherwise I have no suggestions
until I have had an opportunity,
if elected, to evaluate the situa
tion from the president's chair.
The Traffic Committee is cur
rently compiling statistics in or
der to make a comprehensive re
port of the problem. Until the sta
tistics are completed, I see no rea
son to speculate. I would be very
happy to make an evaluation once
the report is published.

Student government at S t a n
ford exists to help the administra
tion administer student affairs in
areas where the students them
selves often are in a better posi
tion to understand the problems
than the administration.
I believe student desire should
take precedence over strict consti
tutional interpretation. The con
stitution was only drawn up to be
a codification of the wishes of the
students, and it is ridiculous to
use it as an instrument to frus
trate these wishes when they un
dergo substantial changes.
By and large, I think the com
mittees are doing about as well as
could be expected. I would, how
ever, like to see issues more thor
oughly defined in committees so
that the Legislature does not have
to waste so much time debating
minor points when these issues
reach its floor. There are about
enough committees in extracurric
ular activities, but I do advocate
several new ones to aid academic
affairs.
Again there are about enough
avid enthusiasts in the extracur
ricular side of student govern
ment, but there should be more
encouragement toward those who
would only like to do some small
job. I think, on the academic side,
it will prove easier for a student
to be a part-time participant in
student government, in direct con
nection with his academic inter
ests, so the response here should
be quite favorable.
Apathy is a positive protest by
the students against the failure of
student government to realize that
it is just student government. This
results in much bitterness and in
efficiency. The students feel that
their votes are useless because
government has been isolated into
the hands of a small group who
run government more than their
own ideas, rather than trying to
adhere to lines which will be most
in accord with the desires of the
majority of the students. The only
way to cure this is to realize the
limitations of student government
and run the open-minded and ef
ficient government in which there
is really "something for every
body."
Student government at present
tends more to be an exercise for
those in it and less of a true repre
sentation of the needs and desires
of the student body. It should have
both of these functions, but at
present the most important one
tends to be almost ignored by
those in control,
The Legislature is the law-mak
ing body of the government, and
as such it should be to some de
gree a mere rubber stamp on com
mittee actions, and it should act
quietly and with consideration
upon measures and dispense with
the parliamentary red-tape, bick
ering and haggling over minor
points which have often marked it
this year and only served to make
it appear ridiculous in the eyes of
the students.
The administrative assistant to
the president is an excellent job
and should continue to do the
busy work and red-tape cutting—
which appear to be a semi-neces
sary evil of any government—for
the president.
I would attempt to get down to
cases with the administration and
work out a solution which would
be satisfactory to both it and the
students, if such a thing exists.
Traffic Com has existed for a year
without doing so. I also see no
particular reason why the road
past Lagunita should continue to
inconvenience students in being
closed.

The role of student government
at Stanford is to give the student
a voice and opportunity to partici
pate in a variety of activities un
der ASSU.
I have no intention of changing
the present constitution. I feel it
is an effective piece of machinery,
but I do intend to make use of
public opinion polls to a great ex
tent. The results of these polls
can be worked out quite thorough
ly through the ASSU Constitution.
Any administration reserves the
right to examine the effectiveness
of ASSU committees in terms of
the administration's objectives. By
and large, the present committees
are useful, but broader interests
should be stressed as outlined in
my platform.
*
Any effective student govern
ment requires as many partici
pants as possible. I believe that a
personal approach through public
opinion polls will help dramatize
the problems of student govern
ment.
The causes of student apathy
are too numerous and complex to
cite in detail here. But the trend
toward mediocrity and excessive
conformity must be reversed. 1
Bringing about the latter will cure
the former. It is my intention to
attack both these problems vigor-'
ously. My entire platform is di-i
rected at overcoming student ap
athy by providing the necessary
stimulus.
While there are many excellent
committees with hard - working
people, some will undoubtedly re
quire overhauling.
/
The ultimate role of the Legis
lature is to put into effect the stu
dent's desire. Since the new con
stitution is only a year old, it is
too early to assess its effective
ness.
I intend to make full use of the
office of administrative assistant.
This problem is primarily the
problem of the University admin
istration, but the student body
through the ASSU should be con
sulted.

At Stanford, student govern
ment should reflect ideas and de
sires of the students to the admin
istrative officials of the Univer
sity. It should provide the mechan
ics for planning and executing
student activities.
. I would base my government on
a combination of both. The con
stitution is supposed to represent
manifested student desire, but this
has not always been the case.
Therefore, current student desire
must be given serious considera
tion.
I would try to emphasize the
service aspects of ASSU commit
tees. Some examples: Foreign
scholarship, Cardinals hostel pro
gram, Traffic Committee, etc. A
comprehensive study of commit
tees is being made. Until this
study is completed (probably
within the next two weeks), state
ments pertaining to the useful
ness or excessiveness of commit
tees are worthless speculation.
Since there is a problem of at
tracting an adequate number of
students to try out for commit
tees, I would assume student gov
ernment is satisfying the inter
ested people. Because we do not
have facilities to bring more in, I
believe the answer rests with the
Tresidder Memorial Union. The
faster the Union is constructed,
the faster we will have more stu
dents and more interest in student
government.
I believe the problem centers in
the following areas: 1) Current
facilities are less than desirable,
2) The election system discour
ages a stimulating campaign by
forcing candidates to conduct a
personalized campaign over 60
living groups or 3000 people in
eight days, 3) The level of student
awareness is at an ebb, and 4)
Communication between ASSU
and students never has been culti
vated.
Currently student government
does not represent the students.
But it is more than an exercise for
the participantsi With proper lead
ership of the Legislature and Cab
inet, student interests could be
properly represented.
r
In addition to problems within
its jurisdiction, the Legislature
should convey student desires or
criticism to the president so that
he may effectively act as a liaison
between students and administra
tive officials. It should also be
used as a sounding board for
ASSU and University policies. It
has not functioned efficiently this
year.
I would not allow the adminis
trative assistant's job to assume
the proportions of the past year.
Otherwise I have no suggestions
until I have had an opportunity,
if elected, to evaluate the situa
tion from the president's chair.
The Traffic Committee is cur
rently compiling statistics in or
der to make a comprehensive re
port of the problem. Until the sta
tistics are completed, I see no rea
son to speculate. I would be very
happy to make an evaluation once
the report is published.

Student government at S t a n
ford exists to help the administra
tion administer student affairs in
areas where the students them
selves often are in a better posi
tion to understand the problems
than the administration.
I believe student desire should
take precedence over strict consti
tutional interpretation. The con
stitution was only drawn up to be
a codification of the wishes of the
students, and it is ridiculous to
use it as an instrument to frus
trate these wishes when they un
dergo substantial changes.
By and large, I think the com
mittees are doing about as well as
could be expected. I would, how
ever, like to see issues more thor
oughly defined in committees so
that the Legislature does not have
to waste so much time debating
minor points when these issues
reach its floor. There are about
enough committees in extracurric
ular activities, but I do advocate
several new ones to aid academic
affairs.
Again there are about enough
avid enthusiasts in the extracur
ricular side of student govern
ment, but there should be more
encouragement toward those who
would only like to do some small
job. I think, on the academic side,
it will prove easier for a student
to be a part-time participant in
student government, in direct con
nection with his academic inter
ests, so the response here should
be quite favorable.
Apathy is a positive protest by
the students against the failure of
student government to realize that
it is just student government. This
results in much bitterness and in
efficiency. The students feel that
their votes are useless because
government has been isolated into
the hands of a small group who
run government more than their
own ideas, rather than trying to
adhere to lines which will be most
in accord with the desires of the
majority of the students. The only
way to cure this is to realize the
limitations of student government
and run the open-minded and ef
ficient government in which there
is really "something for every
body."
Student government at present
tends more to be an exercise for
those in it and less of a true repre
sentation of the needs and desires
of the student body. It should have
both of these functions, but at
present the most important one
tends to be almost ignored by
those in control,
The Legislature is the law-mak
ing body of the government, and
as such it should be to some de
gree a mere rubber stamp on com
mittee actions, and it should act
quietly and with consideration
upon measures and dispense with
the parliamentary red-tape, bick
ering and haggling over minor
points which have often marked it
this year and only served to make
it appear ridiculous in the eyes of
the students.
The administrative assistant to
the president is an excellent job
and should continue to do the
busy work and red-tape cutting—
which appear to be a semi-neces
sary evil of any government—for
the president.
I would attempt to get down to
cases with the administration and
work out a solution which would
be satisfactory to both it and the
students, if such a thing exists.
Traffic Com has existed for a year
without doing so. I also see no
particular reason why the road
past Lagunita should continue to
inconvenience students in being
closed.

The role of student government
at Stanford is to give the student
a voice and opportunity to partici
pate in a variety of activities un
der ASSU.
I have no intention of changing
the present constitution. I feel it
is an effective piece of machinery,
but I do intend to make use of
public opinion polls to a great ex
tent. The results of these polls
can be worked out quite thorough
ly through the ASSU Constitution.
Any administration reserves the
right to examine the effectiveness
of ASSU committees in terms of
the administration's objectives. By
and large, the present committees
are useful, but broader interests
should be stressed as outlined in
my platform.
*
Any effective student govern
ment requires as many partici
pants as possible. I believe that a
personal approach through public
opinion polls will help dramatize
the problems of student govern
ment.
The causes of student apathy
are too numerous and complex to
cite in detail here. But the trend
toward mediocrity and excessive
conformity must be reversed. 1
Bringing about the latter will cure
the former. It is my intention to
attack both these problems vigor-'
ously. My entire platform is di-i
rected at overcoming student ap
athy by providing the necessary
stimulus.
While there are many excellent
committees with hard - working
people, some will undoubtedly re
quire overhauling.
/
The ultimate role of the Legis
lature is to put into effect the stu
dent's desire. Since the new con
stitution is only a year old, it is
too early to assess its effective
ness.
I intend to make full use of the
office of administrative assistant.
This problem is primarily the
problem of the University admin
istration, but the student body
through the ASSU should be con
sulted.

At Stanford, student govern
ment should reflect ideas and de
sires of the students to the admin
istrative officials of the Univer
sity. It should provide the mechan
ics for planning and executing
student activities.
. I would base my government on
a combination of both. The con
stitution is supposed to represent
manifested student desire, but this
has not always been the case.
Therefore, current student desire
must be given serious considera
tion.
I would try to emphasize the
service aspects of ASSU commit
tees. Some examples: Foreign
scholarship, Cardinals hostel pro
gram, Traffic Committee, etc. A
comprehensive study of commit
tees is being made. Until this
study is completed (probably
within the next two weeks), state
ments pertaining to the useful
ness or excessiveness of commit
tees are worthless speculation.
Since there is a problem of at
tracting an adequate number of
students to try out for commit
tees, I would assume student gov
ernment is satisfying the inter
ested people. Because we do not
have facilities to bring more in, I
believe the answer rests with the
Tresidder Memorial Union. The
faster the Union is constructed,
the faster we will have more stu
dents and more interest in student
government.
I believe the problem centers in
the following areas: 1) Current
facilities are less than desirable,
2) The election system discour
ages a stimulating campaign by
forcing candidates to conduct a
personalized campaign over 60
living groups or 3000 people in
eight days, 3) The level of student
awareness is at an ebb, and 4)
Communication between ASSU
and students never has been culti
vated.
Currently student government
does not represent the students.
But it is more than an exercise for
the participantsi With proper lead
ership of the Legislature and Cab
inet, student interests could be
properly represented.
r
In addition to problems within
its jurisdiction, the Legislature
should convey student desires or
criticism to the president so that
he may effectively act as a liaison
between students and administra
tive officials. It should also be
used as a sounding board for
ASSU and University policies. It
has not functioned efficiently this
year.
I would not allow the adminis
trative assistant's job to assume
the proportions of the past year.
Otherwise I have no suggestions
until I have had an opportunity,
if elected, to evaluate the situa
tion from the president's chair.
The Traffic Committee is cur
rently compiling statistics in or
der to make a comprehensive re
port of the problem. Until the sta
tistics are completed, I see no rea
son to speculate. I would be very
happy to make an evaluation once
the report is published.

Student government at S t a n
ford exists to help the administra
tion administer student affairs in
areas where the students them
selves often are in a better posi
tion to understand the problems
than the administration.
I believe student desire should
take precedence over strict consti
tutional interpretation. The con
stitution was only drawn up to be
a codification of the wishes of the
students, and it is ridiculous to
use it as an instrument to frus
trate these wishes when they un
dergo substantial changes.
By and large, I think the com
mittees are doing about as well as
could be expected. I would, how
ever, like to see issues more thor
oughly defined in committees so
that the Legislature does not have
to waste so much time debating
minor points when these issues
reach its floor. There are about
enough committees in extracurric
ular activities, but I do advocate
several new ones to aid academic
affairs.
Again there are about enough
avid enthusiasts in the extracur
ricular side of student govern
ment, but there should be more
encouragement toward those who
would only like to do some small
job. I think, on the academic side,
it will prove easier for a student
to be a part-time participant in
student government, in direct con
nection with his academic inter
ests, so the response here should
be quite favorable.
Apathy is a positive protest by
the students against the failure of
student government to realize that
it is just student government. This
results in much bitterness and in
efficiency. The students feel that
their votes are useless because
government has been isolated into
the hands of a small group who
run government more than their
own ideas, rather than trying to
adhere to lines which will be most
in accord with the desires of the
majority of the students. The only
way to cure this is to realize the
limitations of student government
and run the open-minded and ef
ficient government in which there
is really "something for every
body."
Student government at present
tends more to be an exercise for
those in it and less of a true repre
sentation of the needs and desires
of the student body. It should have
both of these functions, but at
present the most important one
tends to be almost ignored by
those in control,
The Legislature is the law-mak
ing body of the government, and
as such it should be to some de
gree a mere rubber stamp on com
mittee actions, and it should act
quietly and with consideration
upon measures and dispense with
the parliamentary red-tape, bick
ering and haggling over minor
points which have often marked it
this year and only served to make
it appear ridiculous in the eyes of
the students.
The administrative assistant to
the president is an excellent job
and should continue to do the
busy work and red-tape cutting—
which appear to be a semi-neces
sary evil of any government—for
the president.
I would attempt to get down to
cases with the administration and
work out a solution which would
be satisfactory to both it and the
students, if such a thing exists.
Traffic Com has existed for a year
without doing so. I also see no
particular reason why the road
past Lagunita should continue to
inconvenience students in being
closed.

The Issues
Editor's Note: The Daily has
queried tl>i* three ASSU presiden

on ten issues of vital interest to
the students who will be voting
in the upcoming* election.
The candidates were given a list
of questions pertaining to these
issues, and I hey were asked to
hand in one paragraph replies to
each, to be published today, on the
f irst day of spring elections.
The issues, the questions and
the answers follow:

Are ASSU committees being
used properly? How would you
use them? Or are there too many?
PARTICIPATION
Are there enough students out
side the regular officers working
in stud e n t government? How
would you bring more in?
APATHY "CURE"
Last year 114 candidates ran for
ASSU and class offices. This year
