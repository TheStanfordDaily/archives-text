# '56 Campaign Proves Quiet; Not So in the Former Battles
## Sterling Speech Highlighted '52 Campaign; ‘Snarl-Ups' Featured in '53, '54—Ralph in '55 
### 
As primary elections open to
day there are 51 candidates run
ning for office—as compared with
the 114 who ran in last year's
competition.
The smaller number of candi
dates is also reflected in the
am'ount of campaign enthusiasm*,,
this year—very quiet as compared
with the hilarity of last year.
Some say this means "apathy,"
others say that perhaps the can
didates running are the only ones
qualified for their positions, and
that they are taking this respon
sibility seriously.
Whatever the answer, this has
been a quiet campaign.
1952 Campaign
During the 1f152 campaign,
President Wallace Sterling spoke
to students at a "Student Govern
ment Day Election Assembly."
His topic: "Country Club or
College." In his speech he praised
the ability of students to shoulder
their responsibility for self-gov
ernment and said Stanford was
dubbed a "country club" because
it is physically well-equipped—
something which others envy.
A total of 3411 votes, 52.9 per
cent of the student body, were
cast in the,finals in which Dick
Weismann was elected ASSU
President.
1953 Confusion
In the 1953 election battle Don
Lozabniek was elected president
in the. primary as 3111 ballots
were cast. But others "elected"
found ballots marked for them
invalidated by ASSU Excom.
There was some confusion on
eligibility of some seniors to vote
for graduate and living group rep
resentatives to Excom and for
Men's and Women's Councils.
Later Excom clarified the situ
ation and declared the original
"winners," the actual winners.

_ Finally things were ironed out
as 2400 votes were cast in the
finals
1954 "Snarl Up"
After the 1954 primaries The
Daily's lead headline said, MIXUP
SNARLS ELECTIONS — and did
it. Five of the elections were in
validated by Excom after they
had heard protests that some
seniors had not been allowed to
vote for student body president.
In desperation Excom appointed
a committee to "codify" election
procedures. Finally things were
straightened out enough so that
Pete Bing could be elected presi
dent—in an up-to-then record
turnout.
3132 votes were cast, represent
ing 4:5.5 per cent of eligible stu
dent voters.
The '51 Record
There was no "snarl up" in last
year's election but there was a
new voting record set. George
Ralph's campaign brought almost
4000 voters out, GO per cent of the
student body.
Ralph was swept in on a "re
form" platform complete with
gimmicks running from slogans
of "I Hate Government" to motor
cycle processions on campus.

turnout.
3132 votes were cast, represent
ing 4:5.5 per cent of eligible stu
dent voters.
The '51 Record
There was no "snarl up" in last
year's election but there was a
new voting record set. George
Ralph's campaign brought almost
4000 voters out, GO per cent of the
student body.
Ralph was swept in on a "re
form" platform complete with
gimmicks running from slogans
of "I Hate Government" to motor
cycle processions on campus.
As primary elections open to
day there are 51 candidates run
ning for office—as compared with
the 114 who ran in last year's
competition.
The smaller number of candi
dates is also reflected in the
am'ount of campaign enthusiasm*,,
this year—very quiet as compared
with the hilarity of last year.
Some say this means "apathy,"
others say that perhaps the can
didates running are the only ones
qualified for their positions, and
that they are taking this respon
sibility seriously.
Whatever the answer, this has
been a quiet campaign.
1952 Campaign
During the 1f152 campaign,
President Wallace Sterling spoke
to students at a "Student Govern
ment Day Election Assembly."
His topic: "Country Club or
College." In his speech he praised
the ability of students to shoulder
their responsibility for self-gov
ernment and said Stanford was
dubbed a "country club" because
it is physically well-equipped—
something which others envy.
A total of 3411 votes, 52.9 per
cent of the student body, were
cast in the,finals in which Dick
Weismann was elected ASSU
President.
1953 Confusion
In the 1953 election battle Don
Lozabniek was elected president
in the. primary as 3111 ballots
were cast. But others "elected"
found ballots marked for them
invalidated by ASSU Excom.
There was some confusion on
eligibility of some seniors to vote
for graduate and living group rep
resentatives to Excom and for
Men's and Women's Councils.
Later Excom clarified the situ
ation and declared the original
"winners," the actual winners.

_ Finally things were ironed out
as 2400 votes were cast in the
finals
1954 "Snarl Up"
After the 1954 primaries The
Daily's lead headline said, MIXUP
SNARLS ELECTIONS — and did
it. Five of the elections were in
validated by Excom after they
had heard protests that some
seniors had not been allowed to
vote for student body president.
In desperation Excom appointed
a committee to "codify" election
procedures. Finally things were
straightened out enough so that
Pete Bing could be elected presi
dent—in an up-to-then record
turnout.
3132 votes were cast, represent
ing 4:5.5 per cent of eligible stu
dent voters.
