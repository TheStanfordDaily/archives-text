# Sue Coshow Gives Election Statement
## 
### 
In a community as large as I
ours, the coordination of social
activities becomes a very neces-1
sary area of regulation.
To this end the Vice-President j
assumes a responsibility primar- i
ily to the students but also to the â€¢
administration and the outside j
world. Ultimately, after the busy
work has been filed away, she 1
must try to increase the success
and broaden the scope of the so-!
cial area.
