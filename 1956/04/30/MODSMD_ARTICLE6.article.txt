# Farm CIBA Championship Hopes Vanish
## Trojans Drub Indian Nine in Double-Header, SC Game Cancelled 
### 
Stanford's hopes of snatching
the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association champion
ship away from defending cham
pion Southern California were
practically demolished over the
weekend as the Trojan nine drub
bed the Tribe in a double-header,
3-2 and 9-3.
The Indian encounter against
Santa Clara scheduled for Friday
was cancelled because of rain and
wet ground.
The two victories gave the Fig
ueroa Street nine an 8-1 record for
the season. Stanford's seasonal
mark stands at 6-3 after t ho twin
defeats.
Card Coach Dutch F eh r in g
stuck with his original plan of
sterling veteran Ray Young and
junk-ball-lhrowing Ed Verdurmon
at the Trojans. This move left
fireballing Walt Payne on the
bench in case a reliefer would be
needed.
Young dueled Matt Zuancih in
Ihe opener Saturday. SC drew
first blood in the fourth with a
solo tally. The Trojans dented the
plate twice more in the sixth on
two unearned runs.
Stanford fought back with sin
gle runs in the seventh and ninth,
but four double plays by the visi
tors broke the back of most of the
Indians' rallies.
USC wasted no time getting to
Verdutmen in the second encoun
ter. The Trojans scored four times
in the second and romped in be
ll ind the scattered nine-hitting
pitching of Ed Isherwood.
Southern California first-base
man Kent lladley was the batting
star of the day. Besides swatting
a 410-foot home run over the right
field wall, Hadley punched out
three singles during the two con
tests.
The Trojan first-sacker's blow
was only the third ever hit over
the right-field wall by a collegiate
baseballcr. It was the 36th ever
hit out of the Sunken Diamond.
Stanford lead-off man Mickey
Holzman paced Ihe Tribe at the
bat. The stocky center-fielder

smacked two singles in five trips
and stole a base in the first game.
In the second contest, Mickey
slapped out another pair of sin
gles in three times up.

Stanford's hopes of snatching
the California Intercollegiate

ship away from defending cham
pion Southern California were
practically demolished over the
weekend as the Trojan nine drub
bed the Tribe in a double-header,
3-2 and 9-3.
The Indian encounter against
Santa Clara scheduled for Friday
was cancelled because of rain and

The two victories gave the Fig

the season. Stanford's seasonal
mark stands at 6-3 after t ho twin
defeats.
Card Coach Dutch F eh r in g
stuck with his original plan of

fireballing Walt Payne on the

needed.
Young dueled Matt Zuancih in
Ihe opener Saturday. SC drew
first blood in the fourth with a
solo tally. The Trojans dented the
plate twice more in the sixth on
two unearned runs.
Stanford fought back with sin

but four double plays by the visi

USC wasted no time getting to

Southern California first-base

a 410-foot home run over the right

The Trojan first-sacker's blow
