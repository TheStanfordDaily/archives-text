### 
HAVANA, Cuba, April 29 (UP)
—C ivil i a n revolutionaries in

were underway.
Attack Unsuccessful
Garcia said the revolutionaries
drove up to the garrison head
quarters of the Fourth Regiment
in sand trucks, poured out of the
vehicles and opened fire. Not a
single attacker got inside the gar
rison gate, Garcia said.
The revolutionaries fled to pri
vate homes in Matanzas after be
ing beaten off at the military
headquarters. The army laid siege
to the homes and in the ensuing
gunfight killed and captured
many of the rebels. Among the
wounded were three soldiers and
one non-combatant.
Garcia said the ringleader of
the revolt was Reynol Garcia of
Matanzas, who was killed in the
fighting. The revolt leader was
an employee of the ministry of
communications during the re
gime of ousted former president
Carlos Prio Socarras and was a
member of Prio's Revolutionary
Authentico Party, the Colonel
said.
Prio Arrested
Prio was arrested in Havana.
The former president, who re
turned here from exile only six
months ago, has been charged by
the government with mastermind
ing all revolutionary disturbances
in Cuba during recent weeks.
Garcia said he could not esti
mate the number of prisoners
taken in Matanzas or the number
of revolutionaries involved in the
outbreak. "There were plenty of
them," was the Colonel's only
comment.
