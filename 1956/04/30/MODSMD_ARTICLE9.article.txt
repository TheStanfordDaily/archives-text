### 
The second issue of Sequoia
will make its appearance on Quad
Wednesday. The magazine will
sell for 40 cents.
The main contributor for this
issue is Malcolm Cowley, nation
ally-known critic and author, who
was a visiting professor of Eng
lish at Stanford last quarter.
This is continuing the policy of
accepting one article from an es
tablished author unconnected with
the Stanford student body.
The other two articles include
one by John Benedict, "The Rig
Dylan Thomas Jag," and an arti
cle by Diane Dyer on the sculptor
Benjamin Bufano.
Bufano was a guest lecturer
here last quarter and has donated
several statues and mosaics to the
Stanford Museum. Two photo
graphs will accompany the article.
The second issue is four pages
larger than the first and includes
three short stories by Dennis Mur
phy, Joanne Hardy and Dick Sam
son. The five poets represented in
the maga/inc are Ellen de Young
Kay, Moore Moran, Will Jumper,
Irene Curtis and Jane Helm.
The staff and board of Sequoia
are interested in receiving mate

cially short stories and poetry.
