LKXTNGTON, Vaâ€ž April 30
(IJP) Sen. Allien W. Barkley of
Kentucky collapsed and died today
of a heart attack while addressing
students at Washington and Lee
University.
Barkley, former Vice-President,
was 78.
Barkley slumped to the plat
form during his keynote address
at the students' mock Democratic
convention at approximately 5
p.m. He was carried out on a
stretcher.
But he never reached Ihe hospi
tal. Dr. Robert Munger, a heart
specialist who accompanied him
in the ambulance, pronounced him
dead at 5:30.
Heart Attack
The heart attack was apparent
ly almost instantly fatal to the
veteran of a half-century of hurly
burly politics who was almost al
most always in robust health.
Barkley's last words were, "I
would rather he a servant in the
house of the Lord than sit in the
seat of the mighty." After saying
this, he fell to the floor.
There were approximately 1700
people present. The meeting fol
lowed a float parade in which Sen.
Barkley had ridden in the leading
car. He had been named tempo
rary chairman of the convention
and was introduced by Governor
Thomas B. Stanley. Witnesses said
he had finished approximately
half his speech when he collapsed.
Allien W. Barkely's 48-year ca
reer as a public servant carried
him from a Kentucky tenant farm
to the Vice-Presidency of the Unit
ed States, but it never quite put
him in the White House.
Good Humor
His ready wit and cheerful good
humor made him one of the most
popular figures of his generation.
His skill at political compromise
and his reputation for party loy
alty stamped him as a Democratic
party wheelhorse.
Once he sought the Presidency.
Once, as events proved, he came
close to getting the world's tough
est job unwittingly. Both times
the road turned well shy of the
White House.
The first Vice President to be
married in office, Barkley's 1949
courtship was followed with in
terest across the nation. Four
years later, after 40 years' service
on Capitol Hill, the retiring Vice-
President launched a new career
as a television commentator.
He had hoped that the path
from Capitol Hill would leaf! to
the Presidency. He was an active
candidate for the Presidential
nomination at the ID.">2 Democrat
ic convention in Chicago.
