# Supreme Court Orders Study Of Ruling Against Communists
## Subversive Activities Control Board Told To Remove 'Taint' Surrounding 1952 Decision 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP)—The Supreme Court today oidcn i
the Subversive Activities Control Board to remove a "taint" .mi
rounding its 1952 ruling that the Communist Party is a Ru,-.;.mi
controlled subversive organization.
In a fi-to-3 decision, the court directed the board to dispose oI ih

party's charge that three govern
ment witnesses were "profession
al perjurers." The three were ex-
Communists P'aui Crouch, Man
ning Johnson and Harvey Matu
sow.
The court said the board could
make sure its finding was based
on "untainted evidence" by hold
ing new hearings on the party's
charge or by merely removing the
Crouch-Johnson-Maiusow testimo
ny from the record.
"In either event,"the court said
in an opinion by Justice Felix
Frankfurter, "the board must then
reconsider its original determina
tion in the light of the record as
freed from the challenge that now
beclouds it."
By handing the case back to the
j board, the court put off a ruling
on the constitutionality of the
1950 Internal Security Act which
established ihe board. Justice Tom
C. Clark, speaking for the three
dissenters, argued that the court
should have ruled on the constitu
tional question.
The court's action stemmed
from the party's contention that
Matusow, Crouch and Johnson,
who testified at the board's 1952
hearings, were "professional in
formers" who "committed perju
ry" and "should be accorded no
credence."
On the basis of its hearings, the
board branded the party a "for
eign-controlled conspiracy under
the Internal Security law and or
dered it to register with the Jus-
I tice Department. The party's com
i pliance with the order has been
1 held up for four years through
j actions challenging the con-
I stitutionallty of the law and the
i fairness of the board hearings.
