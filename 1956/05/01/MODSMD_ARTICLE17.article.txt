# Only Halfway

01 n\ THE daily has reiterated the value ami
inherent right of free political discussion on the
campuses of the nation's colleges anil univer
sities.
It has often lent editorial support to serious
i (forts b\ students from universities where ad
ministrations curtail political activity of any
natun, especially state schools where regents
refuse to permit political comment running
contrary lo the policy of the party in power.
!t lo understand, we have said, how
lh»'.-e universities can justify this hlatant form
o| censorship when it is the historic obligation
of lhe.se institutions to lay an educational frame
work from which youth can develop into aware,
<1 i-cri initiating citizens.
Al Stanford the fetters of state politics are
non-existent. The only restrictions are those
imposed |»v Stanford's law-of-laws, the Found
ing <»rant, which prohibits politics of a partisan
nature, hut is interpreted to allow organizations
and discussion for the stimulation of political
education.
In a sense, Stanford students are fortunate
lo have the liberties they have, hul they are
justified in wondering why many of the exist
in:' restrictions have not been removed.

It is an accepted fact that constitutions, if to
prove flexible and applicable to varying situa
tions. must be interpreted liberally.
The Founding <»rant is no different; it can
not he made to suit adequately the needs of the
mid-twentieth century if it is interpreted as it
was 70 years ago.
Already having seen the necessity for liberal
interpretation of the Grant, the Trustees have
gone half-way in permitting and encouraging
the establishment of the Political Union.
For all practical purposes, the Stanford Area
Young Republicans anil Young Demourats, be
ing composed entirely of Stanford students, are
campus organizations although forced to meet
off campus.
The point that these groups direct their at
tention down partisan channels is only a par
tially valid argument in this case, for political
education inherently implies a study and un
derstanding of the workings of our partisan ma
chinery.
Allowing these groups to function on campus
would not imply sanctioning of their princi
ples; it would mean llie University appreciates
the value of llieir contribution lo the political
education of its students.
