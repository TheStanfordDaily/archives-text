COMBINING THE RARK GIFTS of ail adroit politi
cian, a compassionate democrat and a beloved
national leader, Alben Barkley often seemed
the very exponent of "Americana. '
From his early life in a log cabin and while
working his way through college as a janitor
and up the often depressing ladder of politick,
I lie erudite Keiltuckian never lost his feel for
the people, his understanding of human nature
and ability to effect an agreement from the most
contentious factions.
I'Veling that politics is an art of compromise,
the man w ho was often labeled "Mr. Democrat'"

dealt with Congressional divergencies with an
unrivaled talent that justified his definition of
American politics.
To this man, the job of politics was not an
odious task, hot rather a pleasant, exciting one
that brought him closer to the American people
for whom he felt a sincere affection.
His death yesterday afternoon will leave an
unmistakable void in the Senate where lie
served for 40 years. More than that, it will de
prive the American people of one of their
finest leaders.
