# Stanford's Two-Year-Old Poli Union...A Pioneering Effort
## 
### Helen Dewar (Last in a series) 
Political interest at Stanford
has never been completely dor
mant. Yet it has taken since the
University's founding to estab
lish an organization such as the
Political Union, which was fi
nally formed in 1953 through
student, faculty and adminis
tration aspirations.
The primary reason for this
delay was the University's

Founding Grant, which forbade
any form of partisan political
activity on campus.
From its inception in 1885 to
1953, Stanford had no organiza
tion whose purposes were at all
political in nature. The closest
approximation to this was the
Law Forum, a forerunner of the
Political Union, which was ori
entated primarily for law stu
dents and usually held closed
meetings.
Impetus for the formation of

a political organization came
from students who found many
in the faculty and administra
tion eager to back their plans.
Preceding the submission of a
plan for an organization of a
political but non-partisan nature
were extensive talks with Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbig
ler and the appointment by the
ASSU Executive Committee of
a student-faculty group to study
successful political organiza
tions such as the Oxford, Yale

and Harvard unions.
During the spring and fall of
1953 a constitution was devised
and open meetings were held,
held.
By November the Board of
Trustees had reached a decision
and authorized the formation of
a new experiment—an agency
and outlet for political evalua
tion and f*pe discussion on a
campus devoid of such an out
let for almost 90 years.
Party caucuses Democratic,

Independent and Republican—
were set up within the Union
to provide greater opportunity
for partisan debate and a closer
grass-roots approach to politics.
The infant organization, al
though not yet officially sanc
tioned, was on its feet by Octo
ber when Democratic Congress
man John B. Shelley spoke.
During the first year, the Un
ion attracted such public figures
as Governor Goodwin Knight,
Senator Thomas Kuchel, sena

torial aspirant Samuel Yorty
and gubernatorial candidate
Richard Graves.
Spring of 1953 and fall of 1954
were periods of comparative po
litical interest on the campus,
and the enthusiasm of students
was greater than it proved to be
during the next year and a half.
"I'm hopeful," Fuller s a i d,
looking to the future, "that the
Political Union will continue as
it is, now that we are out of the
McCarthy hysteria and there

are less chances that free politi
cal discussions will be discour
aged."
Summing up tho far-reaching
purposes of the pioneering Po
litical Union, Fuller said "our
object is to establish the tradi
tion of political discussion and
education on this campus. If
this happened it would make no
difference whether or not there
was a Political Union."

this happened it would make no
difference whether or not there
was a Political Union."
Political interest at Stanford
has never been completely dor
mant. Yet it has taken since the
University's founding to estab
lish an organization such as the
Political Union, which was fi
nally formed in 1953 through
student, faculty and adminis
tration aspirations.
The primary reason for this
delay was the University's

Founding Grant, which forbade
any form of partisan political
activity on campus.
From its inception in 1885 to
1953, Stanford had no organiza
tion whose purposes were at all
political in nature. The closest
approximation to this was the
Law Forum, a forerunner of the
Political Union, which was ori
entated primarily for law stu
dents and usually held closed
meetings.
Impetus for the formation of

a political organization came
from students who found many
in the faculty and administra
tion eager to back their plans.
Preceding the submission of a
plan for an organization of a
political but non-partisan nature
were extensive talks with Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbig
ler and the appointment by the
ASSU Executive Committee of
a student-faculty group to study
successful political organiza
tions such as the Oxford, Yale

and Harvard unions.
During the spring and fall of
1953 a constitution was devised
and open meetings were held,
held.
By November the Board of
Trustees had reached a decision
and authorized the formation of
a new experiment—an agency
and outlet for political evalua
tion and f*pe discussion on a
campus devoid of such an out
let for almost 90 years.
Party caucuses Democratic,

Independent and Republican—
were set up within the Union
to provide greater opportunity
for partisan debate and a closer
grass-roots approach to politics.
The infant organization, al
though not yet officially sanc
tioned, was on its feet by Octo
ber when Democratic Congress
man John B. Shelley spoke.
During the first year, the Un
ion attracted such public figures
as Governor Goodwin Knight,
Senator Thomas Kuchel, sena

torial aspirant Samuel Yorty
and gubernatorial candidate
Richard Graves.
Spring of 1953 and fall of 1954
were periods of comparative po
litical interest on the campus,
and the enthusiasm of students
was greater than it proved to be
during the next year and a half.
"I'm hopeful," Fuller s a i d,
looking to the future, "that the
Political Union will continue as
it is, now that we are out of the
McCarthy hysteria and there

are less chances that free politi
cal discussions will be discour
aged."
Summing up tho far-reaching
purposes of the pioneering Po
litical Union, Fuller said "our
object is to establish the tradi
tion of political discussion and
education on this campus. If
this happened it would make no
difference whether or not there
was a Political Union."
