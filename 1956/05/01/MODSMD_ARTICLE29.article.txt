# Netters Will Battle San Jose State
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
will invade San Jose State College
this afternoon with hopes of re
pealing an early-season slaughter
of the Spartans.
The Indians slammed San Jose,
9-0, on Feb. 25, although playing
without stellar performers Jack
Douglas, Jack Frost and Dave
Duff.
Douglas, Frost and Duff will
probably play today. The Card
netters will be staging their first
dual meet since losing on April 21
to UCLA. 9-0.
