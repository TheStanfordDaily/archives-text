SAN FRANCISCO. April 30
(UP)â€”Big Bill Russell, Univer
j sity of Sun Francisco's All-Ameri-
I can basketball star, high-jumped
(J feet 8 inches on a sore heel today
as he moved another half-inch to
| ward his goal of a seven-foot leap.
His best previous mark was 6
| feet 7Vi inches.
Russell's 6 foot 8 inch effort
ranks as the best high jump so far
this spring on the entire Pacific
Coast.
Second best Coast jump was
turned in by Stanford's Phil Feh
len. The Indian ace cleared the bar

at G feet T-'U inches last Saturday
in leading Stanford to a quadran
gular meet win.
Russell, whose coach says he'll
be the first man to clear the long
sought mark, stole the show as
his team was defeated, 81-19, in a
wind-swept dual meet with Col
lege of Pacific.
The gangling athlete, who re
sumed jumping only a week ago
after a two-year layoff, cleared 6-8
and then barely brushed off the
crossbar at 6 - 10 1 .
The world record is 6 -11 Vj, set
by Walt Davis,of Texas A&M.
