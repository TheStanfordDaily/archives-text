## The 						New Leaders 
### 
Student voters have chosen a new ASSU president and we
wish to extend our congratulations to both Bob Freelen and
to tin* others who have been chosen for the next Associated
Student admiuistration.
\X e (eel the voters 1 confidence was not misplaced. I hrough
out the re<eut campaigning i'reelen has shown himself as
a real supporter of solid, constructive ideas for student gov
ernment.
His campaign ami his platform were solid hut they were
not the actions of a "stand-patter." The president-elect
realizes that something is basically wrong 111 Stanford's stu
dent government and he has formulated a solid program to
help alleviate that weakness, a combination of many factors
which, grouped together, are termed "apathy."
We like especially his plans to do the utmost to inform
students of ASSU activities. Knowledge of these activities is
the only way a student will know his ASSU and the only way
in which he can form a valid judgment on whether such
activity is worthwhile for him as an individual.
Hut most important is the thought behind Freelen's plan.
He said: . . this is not an attempt to push activities on
students, it merely intends to inform."
We arc looking forward to a progressive and enlightened
student administration next fall. And so long as that ad
ministration effectuates its present plans The Daily will be
one of its campus supporters.
