# Kuchel Scores Opponents For Defense Policy Stand
## Junior Senator Opens Bay Area Campaign For Re-election with Speech at Rickey's 
### Jim Palmer 
Senator Thomas H. Kuchel fired the opening salvo in his Ray Area
campaign for re-election last night at Rickey's when he scored his
Democratic opponents for "promising to oppose the defense and
foreign policy recommendations of the President."
An audience of 70 persons heard the 45-year-old junior Senator

from California firmly promise to
"follow and assist Dwight. D.
Eisenhower in these next four
years."
"If I were a private citizen, I
would want to see my representa
tive place his faith in President
j Eisenhower. I can proudly say I
have done that during these past
three years."
It was the kick-off speech of
Kuchel's campaign in the Bay
Area for the June 5 primary elec
tion in which democrats Samuel
Yorty and Richard Richards are
also nomination candidates.
Forcefully, Kuchel pointed to
bills he had introduced in the
Senate which have now become
j "the law of the land."
"I have sponsored legislation in
, the Senate . . . for federal as
sistance in solving the water prob
lem, both that of not enough and
i too much ... I reintroduced an
' aii' pollution research bill . . .
and bills for necessary public
; const met ion."
I le listed a quarter-million dol
-1 lar flam project and a $40 million
j San Francisco Federal Building
as among his legislative achieve-1
: ments.
Then the Senator, who was ap-j
pointed to complete Vice-Presi
dent Nixon's term in 19.13, turned
to accomplishments of the Eisen
hower Administration.
"During the past three yeafrs
we have made more progress than
ever before in showing there is
no second class citizenship in the
United States."
As for foreign policy, Kuchel
said he believed adoption of the
Formosa resolution last year "de
terred a war which otherwise
would have broken out in that I
part of the world."
