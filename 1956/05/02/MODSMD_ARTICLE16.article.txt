# English University Aims Explained By Series Speaker
## 
### 
English universities aim at
striking a balance between the
student body and the faculty, said
Tuesday Series speaker Bernard
E. C. Davis last night during his
talk on "English Universities To
day," in Memorial Auditorium.
"At once static and dynamic,
tradition and change are combined
so as to fulfill the function of a
university today," he explained.
Davis, a faculty member in Eng
lish literature at the University of
London, said that Oxford and
Cambridge are strongholds of tra
dition but are aligning themselves
with the new while defending the
causes they have so long stood
for.
English university standards
have not been lowered, although
the public schools are contribut
ing many more students today,
according to Davis. "The aim is
still to encourage the uncommon
man."
He said that English education
policies have required great in
creases in finances in order to
open the universities to all stu
dents of suitable ability and also
to train more teachers, which are
greatly needed.
Since the second world war Brit
ish universities have had to ac
cept and adjust to changes such as
compulsory service, said Davis.
He added he hoped this change
would be reduced some day.
Davis' last point was that a uni
versity should be liberal rather
than technological.
