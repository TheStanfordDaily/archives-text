# The 						Tyranny at UCLA
## 
### 
I (J,A HAS FINALLY HKACHF.D the end of ils
travel down the road toward complete stifling
of student freedom. It lias indeed reached its
destination, for the .university administration
lui*. now taken over in the whole area of student
government. •
In 1954 students had to stand hy while uni
versitv officials issued a directive telling them
how they should elect the editor of the campus
newspaper.
This was the last step in securing complete
administrative control over the student press
at UCLA. As is the case at many state univer
sities the phrase freedom of the press has been
redefined to mean freedom of the press to print
anything— anything of which the administra
tion approves.
The big factor in such control from above is
that student writers may say some things that,
even though true, may "hurt"" the university,
financially, politically or otherwise. They sub
stitute security for freedom.
Smug in the security of a controlled and un
critical press, the administration has expanded
its ''control from above" policy.
Ivirly last month the dean of students' office
s :;l a directive to the associated students call
ing for a redistribution of representatives on
the student legislative council.
I lie council rejected the directive. The ad
ministration's reason for sending the directive
was a classic example of double talk which
fooled no one, especially the student legislators,
ft went something like this: "To continue dem
ocratic student government and to clarify the
position of the associated students as an official
department of the university [i.e., under direct
adniinistrative control]."
II the student government at UCLA was in
deed democratic then one would think the di
rective would have died on the vine, for it was
Ie jected hy that government. Rut the university
administration would have none of this. They
know what is "right" for student's own govern
ment and they aim to see their directives im
plemented, freedom be damned.
They forced the student legislature to com
promise itself on an issue of freedom—on which
t hey ran never be any compromise. Freedom is

an absolute thing, either a student government
has it in an absolute form or it does not have
it at all.
The compromise involved putting the pro
visions of the administrative directive on the
ballot in a referendum. Putting issues or per
sonalities before students is a privilege in abso
lute custody of students—no administration has
a right to make such a move.
The council's compromise is just as disheart
ening an action as would have been an approval
of the directive. Roth acts would attack the
students right of initiative in his own govern
ment, free from any outside interference.
Even the compromise was wasted on the all
knowing UCLA administration.
The administration has denied—and this is
unbelievable to hold ASUCLA elections them
selves, without approval of the governing body
of the ASUCLA; in fact, without the approval
of any students at all. This is an odd interpre
tation of democracy.
Rut the most unbelievable action of all: The
elections, conducted by the university adminis
tration, without student permission, will be
financed by student funds. Shackling student
political freedom is not enough for these South
ern California tyrants, now they are hitting
the pocketbooks.
Latest move of the tyrants was removal of
Dra.'-nin as ASUCLA President for "conduct not
to the best interests of the university." (He bad
cast the deciding vote in the council decision
not to accept the administration's directive).
Following the ouster'came another move
which takes the right to vote from graduate
students.
There are two alternatives to a solution of
the U< ILA difficulty:
• Abolish student government all-together.
It does not exist now, except in name.
• Remove from the UCLA administration
the men who would practice their academic
tvrrany on students in their charge.
If you believed in the ideals and practice of
American democracy and the liberal educa
tional practices which it inspires, which alter
native would you chose?
