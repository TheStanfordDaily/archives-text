### HELEN DEWAR 
Each closet has its skeleton, and the hack
rooms of our political parties are no exception.
The leaders of hoth the Republican and
Democratic parties face baffling problems in
tr\ing to stifle the closeted cries of conserva
tive, and many times reactionary, elements in
their midst.
This problem has loomed before Eisenhow
er during the past three years, and the indirect
influence of the Old Guard GOP has had
considerable effect on both his domestic and
foreign policy.
Another skeleton, the scepter of Richard
\i\on emerging as President of the United
kites, has been rattling noisily within audible
range of many worried voters.
The strength of conservative influence on
Democratic leadership is comparatively weak,
hut the results of their inter-party feud will
probably be felt in the November elections,
A\lien the one-time Dixiecrats, feeling that the
chances of a Democratic victory are nil any
way, may rise up and bolt the party in protest
to the civil rights tack of the party's liberals.
Election year '56 is peculiar indeed and frus
trating to the person who seeks to find a clear
i(!e<)logical distinction between the two parties'
platforms.
Differences, it often seems, are greater within
the parties than they are between them.
Eisenhower's professions of liberalism are
sincere, and the oratory during the coining
campaign will probably center more around
rousing attacks on and defenses of past Admin
istration action than on clear and distinct dif
ferentiations on policy.
There is much room for criticism of the
Administration, but even here mist beclouds
tin- facts.
Democratic charges of ineptitude and short
sightedness that may well prove valid in the
long run will seem nothing more than the usual
campaign sound and fury in this unusual pe
riod of apparent peace and prosperity.
The no man's land of inaction lying some
where between Eisenhowers campaign prom
ises and actual record of accomplishments will
be overshadowed by tinâ€¢ popularity contest be
tween Eisenhower and the Democrath- nomi
nee.
/he personalities of the contestants u ill be
f/aramoutit, the issues nearly forgotten.
