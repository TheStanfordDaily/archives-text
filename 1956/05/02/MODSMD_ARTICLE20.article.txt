# Inter-Party Breaches Cause Clatter And Clank from Political Skeletons
## 
### JIM PALMER 
Bolli major parties have skeletons in thuir
closets which lliey lik<» to keep locked up tight,
hut an election always seems to loosen the
latch and expose some of the remains.
The Democrats never fail to liarken back
to the Harding scandals and the Depression
days, while Republicans take joy in exposing
the corruption of Democrat bossism and the
decadent Donkey Southern icing.
All this interplay is part of the wonderful
game of politics and sometimes comes out as
a mixture of dirt and moisture known as mud.
Hut the frame ends when the spotlight shifts
to factional disputes within the individual
party organizations. It is the left wing against
the right, and the differing interests fight it
out.
Fortunately for Republicans, 1956 finds
them in at least a surface unity and harmony
behind the President. No split between the
Old Guard I aft wing and the liberal element
w ill occur this year as it did in 1952.
But down at the stalls, the donkeys are get
ting ready for a tremendous inter-party strug
gle which, after the dust is cleared, may leave
only the jawbone of the ass left to slay the lion
at the polls. And they'll need a Sampson to
do it.
Democrats have never seemed to be able to
escape internal strife ever since they "inher
ited" the Solid South after the Civil War. Even
in the days of its greatest successes, the South
has been tugging at the bash in divergent
directions.
This year, the north-south split over segre
gation and states' rights looms as a central
problem as it did in 1918, when the South
walked out of the convention and formed the
1 )ixic< •rats.
Only by reinstating southern slates in tin
electoral column can the Democrats even hope
to make it a. close race in 1956, They must
heal the breath in Chicago this August.
The cost of attaining inter-party harmony
will he high. Tl ic platform must he right and
the candidate must he right, or else the donkey
will he split in two. No longer can the South
he counted on as a sure thing.
And while acquiescing to the South, the
donkey may find his head cut off by those on
tlii' north side of the Mason-Dixon chopping
block.
