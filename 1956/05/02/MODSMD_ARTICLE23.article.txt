1) Inasmuch as the Row sophomores are the
only sophomore girls concerned about losing their
places, is it fair that 40 girls (the approximate
number of sophomores on the Row) should be
granted an exception not given to 1500 other
Stanford women?
If these 40 girls are allowed to remain, only 20
other girls from their class will be able to live
on the Row for their junior year. Furthermore,
due to this greater carry-over of sophomores,
there will be fewer vacancies on the Row for their
class in the spring drawing of 1957.
2) Since the Union Units will not be used as
residences next fall, and since Florence Moore
will be ready for occupancy, we feel the entire
system should be instituted this spring. The
straw ballot indicated that over two-thirds of the
girls wanted a change. Why not make it now?
We sincerely believe this is a good proposal
and should be accepted without reservations in
the elections today.
