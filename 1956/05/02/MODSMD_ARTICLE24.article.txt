# 'Sequoia' Wins Early Repute
## 
### Stew Toy 
Although the issue of Sequoia
magazine which will be sold on
Quad loday is only the editors'
second atlempt to raise the level
of local reading fare, one feels
after reading il that the magazine
has already achieved a lasting and
important place in Stanford's in
tellectual life.
A professor in the University
of Minnesota Journalism School
called Sequoia's first issue "the
best undergraduate literary mag
azine I've ever seen." He would
probably be even more enthusi
astic about the second issue.
Lead article of the new issue is
by Malcolm Cowley, famed author
and critic, who projects himself
to the year 2000 and evaluates
current American fiction fro m
that vantage point.
Says Cowley: "Most of the new
novelists are interested in some
form of depth psychology. . . .
|They| are trying to present the
full complexity of individual feel
ing and behavior.

"Sometimes it seems that they
have all been reading Freud or
going to analysts, with the result
that their books present a curious

work, a short story by Dennis
Murphy entitled "A Camp in the
Meadow," bears out Cowley's re
marks.
Murphy studies the frustration
and insecurity of a young Ameri
can soldier stationed in a bleak
Army camp in France. His story
is sincere and touching and is
written with a very professional
sense of style, although the dia
logue is a bit unconvincing.
Diane Dye r's article on San
Francisco sculptor Beniamino Bu
fano is a fascinating personality
sketch of a vital and controversial
figure.
The other student article is
"The Big Dylan Thomas Jag," by
John Benedict. Benedict takes a
few justified digs at the current

attitude of elevating the Welsh
poet's sensational life above the
merits of his poetry.
Short Stories
Sequoia contains two other
short stories, "The Night Before
the Game," by Joanne Hardy, and
"Let There Be Light," by Richard
Samson. Neither story is bad, but
they fail to meet the excellent pro
fessional standards set by the
other writing.
Also included are poems by Will
Jumper, Ellen de Young Kay, Jane
Helm, Moore Moran and Irene
Curtis.
While Sequoia's physical make
up might be improved, the content
of its second issue is, for the most
part, excellent. The issue sets a
fine precedent for future editions
to live up to.

Also included are poems by Will
Jumper, Ellen de Young Kay, Jane

Curtis.
While Sequoia's physical make
up might be improved, the content
of its second issue is, for the most
part, excellent. The issue sets a
fine precedent for future editions
to live up to.
Although the issue of Sequoia
magazine which will be sold on
Quad loday is only the editors'
second atlempt to raise the level
of local reading fare, one feels
after reading il that the magazine
has already achieved a lasting and
important place in Stanford's in
tellectual life.
A professor in the University
of Minnesota Journalism School
called Sequoia's first issue "the
best undergraduate literary mag
azine I've ever seen." He would
probably be even more enthusi
astic about the second issue.
Lead article of the new issue is
by Malcolm Cowley, famed author
and critic, who projects himself
to the year 2000 and evaluates
current American fiction fro m
that vantage point.
Says Cowley: "Most of the new
novelists are interested in some
form of depth psychology. . . .
|They| are trying to present the
full complexity of individual feel
ing and behavior.

"Sometimes it seems that they
have all been reading Freud or
going to analysts, with the result
that their books present a curious

work, a short story by Dennis
Murphy entitled "A Camp in the
Meadow," bears out Cowley's re
marks.
Murphy studies the frustration
and insecurity of a young Ameri
can soldier stationed in a bleak
Army camp in France. His story
is sincere and touching and is
written with a very professional
sense of style, although the dia
logue is a bit unconvincing.
Diane Dye r's article on San
Francisco sculptor Beniamino Bu
fano is a fascinating personality
sketch of a vital and controversial
figure.
The other student article is
"The Big Dylan Thomas Jag," by
John Benedict. Benedict takes a
few justified digs at the current

attitude of elevating the Welsh
poet's sensational life above the
merits of his poetry.
Short Stories
Sequoia contains two other
short stories, "The Night Before
the Game," by Joanne Hardy, and
"Let There Be Light," by Richard
Samson. Neither story is bad, but
they fail to meet the excellent pro
fessional standards set by the
other writing.
Also included are poems by Will
Jumper, Ellen de Young Kay, Jane
Helm, Moore Moran and Irene
Curtis.
