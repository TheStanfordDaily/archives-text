# Card Rowing Crew Rates High
## Olympic Tryouts Eyed This Summer; National Recognition Despite Woes 
### Jerry Kelly 
Collegiate crew Kaeing, uncon
testably the most grueling of in
tercollegiate sports, has taken a
firm hold on Stanford sports ac
tivities. Under the auspices of the
Stanford Crew Association, which
financially have held on by their
shoestrings, the Indians are now
rated in the top 15 nationally.
This June a Stanford varsity
boat will enter the U.S. Olympic
tryouts at Syracuse, N. Y. Last
season the eager oarsmen placed
second behind Navy in the West
ern S j) r in t championships and
fifth in the Intercollegiate Row
ing Association Regatta at Syra
cuse.
With one eye on the June re
gattas, the IRA and the Olympic
tryouts, the Cards have their oth
er eye trained on the Bears of
California. The two arch - rivals
face each other this Saturday aft
ernoon on the Oakland Estuary in
varsity, junior-varsity and fresh
man duels.
Sporting the new look, the In
dian shells were arduously pulled
across the finish line ahead of
both Washington and California —
perennially among the national
rowing leadership last year for
the first' time since 1919. It was a
grand season, indeed, for coach
Lou Lindsey in his initial year as
the unsalaried Stanford coach.
Currently the Indians are the
only partially self-supporting crew
in the major rowing ranks. In the
past, assistance has come from
various sources, including Red
wood City, which has provided
the Stanford crew with land and
money to build the shellhouse in
their city.
Crew activities on the Farm go
back to 1903. In the first meeting
of the three coast powers Stan
lord, Washington and California
in 1907, all three boats were
swamped in a triangular meeting
in Sausalito, Calif.
The Indians won coast titles in
1912 and 1915 and entered the IRA
Regatta both years, placing sixth
in 1912 and second behind a strong
Cornell crew in 1915.
In 1916 Stanford dumped the
Bears for the fifth time, but that
was all the winning until last year
in Los Angeles, when the Cards
out-oared both California and
Washington.

However, the coast has domi
nated collegiate rowing despite
having only two major represent
atives in the past. Washington
has won the national regatta nine
times, while California has held
the crown in six different years.
The Bears won the Olympics in
1928, 1932 and 1948, and Washing
ton was world champ in 1936.
Despite financial handicaps and
training difficulties, the Stanford
crew organization worked hard re
vamping and making future plans.
The Indians participated in the
National Regattas from 1949
through 1953 and again last sea
son. A third place in 1950 was
Stanford's best effort.
During the spring of 1954 the
ci»ew members built their own
shellhouse at Redwood City, using
donated materials. The switch
from the Palo Alto harbor follow
ed from/considerations'which of
fered calm water and afternoon
practice sessions at Redwood City.
Lou Lindsey took over the reins
as coach last year. Representing
a San Francisco investment coun
selor. Lindsey travels to Redwood
City each day to handle the coach
ing chores. In his initial year his
varisty posted wins over Wash
ington, California, Oregon State,
UCLA, USC, Boston, Princeton,
Wisconsin, MIT, Columbia and
Syracuse.
This season Stanford has six re
turning varsity crewmen, five jun
ior varsity oarsmen back and all
of last year's fine freshman crew.
On Saturday California will be
out to revenge their first loss to
the Cards in 39 years. Both crews
dropped USC this season.
After the Cal race, Stanford
treks to Seattle in meeting a
strong Washington squad May 12.
The IRA Regatta will again be at
Syracuse June 16, and the Olym
pic tryouts run June 28, 29 and 30.


HUSKY JIM TRUIIER, the Indians' top representative in the
discus event this Saturday, is being counted on by Coach Jack
Weiserhauser to garner valuable points against the Bears of Cali
fornia in the Big Meet here. Truher's competition comes in the
name of Charles Butt, who has tossed the discus 174 feet 6 inches.
Saturday's meet will be the (ilsf renewal of the cinder classic, in
which Stanford has topped Cal 3! times with two ties.
