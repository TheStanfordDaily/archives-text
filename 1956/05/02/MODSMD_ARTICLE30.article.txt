## 
### 
When the Cards host California
in the Big Meet this Saturday,
Stanford will face a much strong
er track and field squad than the
UC team which fell victim to the
Indians last year, 87-44.
He a de d by two sophomores,
Leamon King and Don Bowden,
the Bears are out to even the
mark in this the Big Meet for the
two squads. Seven Big Meet rec
ords are in the balance, as both
coaches report their outfits in top
shape.
Bowmen, who has run a 4:08
two-mile and a 1:51.5 half-mile, is
listed as a probable starter after
being sidelined since April 7 with
a painful Achilles ten.do n. He
takes the favorite's role in both
events, as does King in the 100
and 220-yard dashes.
Stanford's Phil Fehlen and Mau
ry Graves are being watched also
for record-breaking performances.
Fehlen's 6 foot 7% inch high jump
is tops on the coast this year and
betters a mark set in 1938 in Big
Meet competition.
Graves, another sophomore
grabbing coast recognition despite
strong opposition from the Los
Angeles area schools, sports a
9:18 two-mile mark this season,
four seconds under a 12-year rec
ord. Graves was edged last Satur
day by a returning Olympic Club
veteran, Lowell Zellers, but he
nevertheless set a new school
record.
Fans will also have Iheir eyes
on an expected close duel in the
shot-put circle. Indian putter A 1
Cheney battles Cal's Charley Butt
in what could produce another Big
Meet record. Both throw over 55
feet.
Chuck Cobb, a double winner
last Saturday in the hurdle events,
and teammate Bernie Nelson have
their guns aimed at a 1-2 finish
again this week. Joe Griffin, the
Bears' best, offers the competi
tion.

Anotlfer consistent Indian win
ner of late, Jim Saras, will prob
ably be seeing heels in Saturday's
match. Leamon King, out for Big
Meet records in both dashes, has
traveled tlie century in 9.4 and
the 220 yards in 21.3 —top figures
nationally.
Close duels are expected in the
pole vault event, where Card vaul
ter Bill Flint challenges UC's Lar
ry Anderson, and in the javelin
event ,wi!h Kirk Nieland of Stan
ford meeting Bill Neufeld of the
Bears.

Bowmen, who has run a 4:08
two-mile and a 1:51.5 half-mile, is
listed as a probable starter after
being sidelined since April 7 with
a painful Achilles ten.do n. He
takes the favorite's role in both

ry Graves are being watched also

strong opposition from the Los
Angeles area schools, sports a
9:18 two-mile mark this season,
four seconds under a 12-year rec
ord. Graves was edged last Satur
day by a returning Olympic Club
veteran, Lowell Zellers, but he
nevertheless set a new school
record.
