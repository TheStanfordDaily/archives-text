# Wilson Says Russia Ahead In H-Bombers
## U.S. Plans Expansion Of Heavy Aircraft Wings to 40 Planes 
### 
WASHINGTON, May I (UP)-
Defense Secretary Charles E. Wil
son conceded today that Russia is
outstripping the United States in
the production of globe-girdling
hydrogen bombers.
But he refused to say whether
he agrees with Gen. Curtis E. Le-
May, Strategic Air commander,
that the Soviet Union will be
ahead of this country in long
range striking power by 1958-60.
"From the best information I
have," Wilson told a news confer
ence, "they are currently building
at a higher rate than we are."
Heavy Bombers
He also disclosed that the Air
Force plans to expand its B-52
heavy bomber wings from 30 to 45
planes. He said this was made pos
sible because a recent production
speed-up order will mean "more
planes quicker."
Gen. Earle E. Partridge. Air De
fense commander, has warned
Senate investigators that Russia
has a new jet bomber that can fly
higher than any U.S. interceptors
now in use*
But he said the United States
has some new supersonic inter
ceptors coming along that will re
capture the defensive advantage.
The Army has told Congress it
"expects to be able to defeat" the
dread intercontinental ballistics
missile, although defense against
it will be a big job.
New Missiles
Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin, the
Army's research chief, also said
new anti-aircraft missiles are so
good he sees little chance of sur
vival for manned enemy bombers.
Asked whether this would apply
to the unmanned missiles, he re
plied that "this is a different
thing." His next remarks wore
stricken from the record, but later
he said:
"The Nike family will give us
an 'anti-missile missile.' This is a
very difficult problem. A lot of us
here have worked on it. I have.
We respect the challenge it offers.
"We expect to be able to defeat
the ICBM and the IRBM [inter
mediate range ballistics missile],
but it is going to be a job."
