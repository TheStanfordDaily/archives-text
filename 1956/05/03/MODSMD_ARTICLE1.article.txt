# $3-Million Med-Dental Building to Be Constructed
## 
### 
Ten acres of land have been
rented to several financiers for
the construction of a $3,000,000
medical-dental building on the
campus.
The announcement was made
by University Business Manager
Alf E. Brandin. He is also the
executive officer for land de
velopment.
The acreage which is leased for
99 years is between the Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital site and Wil
low Road. It marks the opening
of a long-range professional-ad
ministrative development in the
area.
The builders are a San Fran
cisco-Peninsula group which is
in the process of setting up a
California corporation for this
purpose. Peninsula Associates
of Palo Alto, Haas and Hayne,

the Palo Alto Clinic, Ltd. and in
dividual Peninsula physicians
and dentists comprise the in
vestors.
Haas and Haynie will construct
the building, which is scheduled
to be ready for occupancy by De
cember, 1957.
Warnecke and Warnecke ai'e
the architects.
Present plans call for a rein
forced concrete structure with a
minimum of 135,000 to 150,000
square feet of rental space.
The building is designed to
provide self-contained units for
the practice of all branches -of
medicine, dentistry and needed
ancillary services. Facilities will
include both medical and dental
laboratories and x-ray rooms.
Prescription pharmacy, surgi
cal supply service and dispensing

opticians will be located on the
garden floor along connecting
arcades between the medical and
dental sections.
Adequate parking will be avail
able to both tenants and patients
near the location. The site is in
the 50-acre professional and ad
ministrative area, lying along
Willow Road, which Palo Alto
annexed in 1953.
"We expect the new medical
dental building," Brandin said,
"to be the first of a number of
facilities to be constructed in the
area to meet the needs of pro
fessional people."
"I am not referring exclusively
to physicians and dentists," he
added. "Lawyers, architects, en
gineers, accountants, investment
and insurance companies, to
name a few, are interested in lo

eating here."
Also to be built in the near
future is a new $15-million medi
cal school on the campus. Stan
ford plans to raise enough money
to finish the $11-million first
stage of the medical school by
the end of 1958.
Location of the medical school
will be some distance behind the
Stanford Museum and the Chem
istry building, away from the
University's main quadrangle.
Edward D. Stone, the architect
for the building, has described
the site as "ideally suited and
drained, with excellent natural
planting."
Serving the medical school will
be new roads yet to be built, in
addition to Willow and Arbore
tum Roads and Lomita Drive.

the building, which is scheduled
to be ready for occupancy by De

Warnecke and Warnecke ai'e
the architects.
Present plans call for a rein
forced concrete structure with a
minimum of 135,000 to 150,000
square feet of rental space.
The building is designed to
provide self-contained units for
the practice of all branches -of
medicine, dentistry and needed
ancillary services. Facilities will
include both medical and dental
laboratories and x-ray rooms.
Prescription pharmacy, surgi
cal supply service and dispensing

opticians will be located on the
garden floor along connecting
arcades between the medical and
dental sections.
Adequate parking will be avail
able to both tenants and patients
near the location. The site is in
the 50-acre professional and ad
ministrative area, lying along
Willow Road, which Palo Alto
annexed in 1953.
"We expect the new medical
dental building," Brandin said,
"to be the first of a number of
facilities to be constructed in the
area to meet the needs of pro
fessional people."
"I am not referring exclusively
to physicians and dentists," he
added. "Lawyers, architects, en
gineers, accountants, investment
and insurance companies, to
name a few, are interested in lo

eating here."
Also to be built in the near
future is a new $15-million medi
cal school on the campus. Stan
ford plans to raise enough money
to finish the $11-million first
stage of the medical school by
the end of 1958.
Location of the medical school
will be some distance behind the
Stanford Museum and the Chem
istry building, away from the
University's main quadrangle.
Edward D. Stone, the architect
for the building, has described
the site as "ideally suited and
drained, with excellent natural
planting."
Serving the medical school will
be new roads yet to be built, in
addition to Willow and Arbore
tum Roads and Lomita Drive.
