## 
### 
A rumor that 80 Stern Hall
students were afflicted with
food poisoning was repudiated
last night by Miss Margaret. Ri
assetto, public health nurse.
Miss Riassetto attributed the
affliction to a "virus of the gas
tro-intestinal tract" and said 15
to 20  cases have been reported.
"The disease is confined to
one section in Stern Hall, and
this rules out food," she pointed
out.
"Also, the attacks have been
spread over a period of time too
long for food poisoning. They
started on Monday and are still
going today.
"People not living in Stern
who eat there didn't get it,"
Miss Riassetto said. "A janitor
who doesn't eat there got it."
