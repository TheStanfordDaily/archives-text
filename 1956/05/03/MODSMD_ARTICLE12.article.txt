# Twelve Law Students to Vie In Moot Court
## Four Victors Tonight, Tomorrow to Qualify For Finals Next Fall 
### 
Semi-finals of the Marion Rice
Kirkwood Moot Court competition
will formally open tonight in the
Stanford Law School. Twelve
second-year law students will
argue as counsel tonight and to
morrow night at 7 in the Moot
Court Room.
Presiding both nights as Chief
Justice of the "District Court of
Appeals of the District of Stan
ford, California" will be George E.
Osborne, Cromwell Professor of
Law. Associate Justices will be
Professors Gordon E. Scott and
Henry Brandis.
Tonight's Counsel for Helen L.
O'Farrell will be Wayne E. Alley
and James H. Bruce. Robert C.
Dedekam and Marshall A. Staun
ton will be Counsel for John Ag
new, and William E. Murane and
Laurence K. Brown will represent
Robert Walter Craig.
The case itself, O'Farrell v.
American Trust Co., is, of course,
imaginary, but is based on a real
case now pending in California
courts.
The issue in this will-trust case
is: Should the property in the
trust bo distributed according to
the provisions of the will, or
should it be distributed to those
persons who would have taken the
property under the law of Califor
nia had Craig never made a will?
Four winners will be selected
from this group to argue in the
final round next autumn quarter.
