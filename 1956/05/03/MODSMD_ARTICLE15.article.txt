# NAACP Man Says Emotions Hinder Ideals
## 
### 
"The average American is suf
fering from the 'American Di
lemma.' For years he has been
taught in the public schools that
he should love his fellow man, re
gardless of race, color or creed.
His emotions, however, sometimes
get in the way of these ideals.
That is the American Dilemma."
These were some of the re
marks of Franklin H. Williams,
regional director of the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, who spoke last
night on "The Fifteenth Amend
ment: Its Betrayal and Realiza
tion."
Williams is a prominent San
Francisco constitutional lawyer.
In his talk, Williams traced the
legal fight the NAACP has been
waging against discrimination.
Since its inception in 1908, the
NAACP has taken more than 40
cases to the Supreme Court in the
fight to assure the voting right of
the Negro under the 15th Amend
ment to the Constitution.
He pointed out the many legal
dodges that are used by various
states to circumvent Supreme
Court rulings upholding the Ne
gro's right to vote.
"For instance," he sain, "one of
the states ohce tried to have the
Democratic party declared a pri
vate cluh. This would allow them
to keep Negroes out.
"In arguing the case before the
court, one of the attorneys point
ed out that the Democratic party
was like the Baptist church, in
that they had the light to restrict
membership in their organization.
"Whereupon, the judge leaned
over the bench and said: 'Gentle
men, the Democratic party in this
state elects the governor. The Bap
tist church does not elect God'."
The case was dismissed.
