total number of votes cast was
1285 and the necessary two-thirds
majority was 857.
The new policy will go into ef
fect on May 10 when drawing will

present residences.
There will be a two-thirds limit

maining vacancies will be filled by
juniors in a two-to-one ratio.
Two Petitions
Two petitions were submitted
to AWS cabinet this week on the
policy. One, signed by women on
the Row, asked that this year's
sophomores be exempt from com
pulsory drawing.
The other petition, from Bran
ner and Roble, expressed the feel
ing that the plan should go into
effect in its entirety next year
with no exceptions.
The cabinet acted on these pe
titions by including on the ballot
the provision that the plan should
go into effect on May 10.
According to Ellie Kronfield,
AWS President, it was felt that
women who approved the Row
petition could express their opin
ion by voting "no" on the measure.
Before Cabinet
The AWS Constitution states
that petitions concerning a stand
ing rule or lesser proposal change
may be brought before the cabi
net. The cabinet may either de
cide the petition by a simple ma
jority vote or, if it hasen't been
acted on within 15 days, the ques
tion goes to be voted on.
The cabinet voted on neither
petition submitted, according id
Miss Kronfield, because they
didn't wish to favor one over t ho
other. They felt that women eon If I
express their opinion on the que
tion simply by voting yes or no on
the question as stated by the bal
lot, thus carrying out the second
provision of the constitution.
The cabinet believed that women
had the chance to express them
selves on the subject already on
the "Straw ballot." At Ihat lime,
a majority did not believe that
sophomores should be excepted
from compulsory drawing this
year.

had the chance to express them
selves on the subject already on
the "Straw ballot." At Ihat lime,
a majority did not believe that
sophomores should be excepted
from compulsory drawing this
year.
The new AWS housing and
drawing policy was passed yestei •
day by a vote of 949 to 336. The
total number of votes cast was
1285 and the necessary two-thirds
majority was 857.
The new policy will go into ef
fect on May 10 when drawing will
be held for next fall's residences.
The new system provides com
pulsory drawing for all freshmen
and sophomores. Juniors may
either draw or remain in their
present residences.
There will be a two-thirds limit
on seniors in any residence. Re
maining vacancies will be filled by
juniors in a two-to-one ratio.
Two Petitions
Two petitions were submitted
to AWS cabinet this week on the
policy. One, signed by women on
the Row, asked that this year's
sophomores be exempt from com
pulsory drawing.
The other petition, from Bran
ner and Roble, expressed the feel
ing that the plan should go into
effect in its entirety next year
with no exceptions.
The cabinet acted on these pe
titions by including on the ballot
the provision that the plan should
go into effect on May 10.
According to Ellie Kronfield,
AWS President, it was felt that
women who approved the Row
petition could express their opin
ion by voting "no" on the measure.
Before Cabinet
The AWS Constitution states
that petitions concerning a stand
ing rule or lesser proposal change
may be brought before the cabi
net. The cabinet may either de
cide the petition by a simple ma
jority vote or, if it hasen't been
acted on within 15 days, the ques
tion goes to be voted on.
The cabinet voted on neither
petition submitted, according id
Miss Kronfield, because they
didn't wish to favor one over t ho
other. They felt that women eon If I
express their opinion on the que
tion simply by voting yes or no on
the question as stated by the bal
lot, thus carrying out the second
provision of the constitution.
The cabinet believed that women
had the chance to express them
selves on the subject already on
the "Straw ballot." At Ihat lime,
a majority did not believe that
sophomores should be excepted
from compulsory drawing this
year.
