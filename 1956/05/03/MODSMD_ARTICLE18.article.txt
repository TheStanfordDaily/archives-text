# Baseballers Preparing For California Series
## Fehring Seeks More Punch In Card Lineup 
### 
Coach Dutch Fehring gave his
baseball squad a day off yester
day, hut he will have the players
hard at ii again today in prepara
tion for the California Intercol
legiate Baseball Association hat
ties with California's Bears this
weekend.
Stanford travels to Berkeley to
morrow, and the teams meet Sat
urday on the Sunken Diamond.
League-leading USC plays UCLA
twice in Los Angeles, and Stan
ford, a game and a half behind,
cannot afford to drop another
game.
Several changes in the outfield
are being contemplated by Fehr
ing. Mickey Holzman is the only
sure bet for the outfield lineup,
and even his starting position Is
in doubt. lie may be in left in
place of Bob Evans or in center
field, his regular position.
Evans, hitting at a .346 clip, was
benched Monday for the Santa
Clara game. JIo got only two hits,
neither solid, against USC, and
his base-running leaves much to
be desired.
Outfield Jumble
If Evans does not play, Holz
man will be in left, Bob Fletcher
in center and A 1 Spurgeon in
right. Ray Young will be in center
field when he is not pitching, and
there is a possibility Walt Payne
may join Young in picket line
duties this weekend.
Ralph Holding, generally con
ceded to be a better defensive
catcher than Doug Camilli, has
slipped at the plate of late, and
the latter may see action against
the Bears.
Ray and Walt
Fehring plans to use Young on
the mound tomorrow and Payne
here on Saturday. Young lost to
the Bears, 3-2. two weeks ago in
the only previous meeting be
tween the two teams.
According to the official aver
ages released yesterday, A 1 Shaw
and Evans are almost neck and
neck for the batting lead. Shaw is
hitting at a .3469 average, while
Evans has .3461. Walt Payne, with
only 26 at bats, is also at .3461.
Evans and Shaw are tied for
most extra-base hits with nine
each, but Steve Stewart has col
lected the most doubles, six.
Few Circuit Clouts
Evans leads in triples with five,
Shaw has four, and Young three.
Hal Messner has hit two of Stan
ford's five homers to take honors
in that department.
Rudy Figueroa and Evans are
Ihe top RBI men on the club.
Evans has 27 to Figueroa's 20.
Evans also dominates the strike
out department, having whiffed
12 times.
Hoi 7.man's 28 walks and 17
steals give him leadership here,
while Figueroa and Stewart each
have five sacrifice hits for domi
nation in that column.
