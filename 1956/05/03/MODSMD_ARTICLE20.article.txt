# Freshmen Blow 3-Run Lead, Tie Menlo Junior College, 5-5
## 'Best Ever' California Frosh Nine Plays Cleggmen Here Saturday in Return Tilt 
### 
The freshmen baseballers battled Menlo J.C. to a standstill yester
day afternoon in their twelfth engagement of the season. The game
was called at the end of seven innings because of a 5:40 time limit.
Papoose bats had punched out what looked like a comfortable lead
as the score stood Stanford five and Menlo'two at the first half of the
seventh.
Dave Brewer opened the visitors', seventh with a walk to start the

trouble. He was driven across by
a booming triple off the bat of
Jack Scramaglia.
Still needing two to tie and three
to win, Menlo's next batter, Gary
Demartini, was safe on an error
and Scramaglia scored.
Demartini scored on a single to
center by Eddie Burns, Menlo's
All-American Junior College foot
baller.
The frosh had jumped off to an
early lead as they scored one run
in the first and another in the sec
ond. Joel Mogy got a single in the
first and then stole second and
third. He scored on a Harry Rodda
single.
Frosh Tally
Phil Weigand walked to open
the Papoose second and was
driven in with a double by short
stop Wayne Marion.
Menlo made it two all in their
half of the third when Joe McCar
ron walked to open the inning and
stored on a double by Tony San
chez. Sanchez went to third on the
play and scored on a fly ball by
Brewer.
In the fourth, Ihe frosh gained
a two run advantage when the
Menlo infield fell apart. Weigand
and Mike Lindemann drew suc
cessive passes to open the inning.
Menlo Miscues
Marion dropped a near perfect
bunt down the third base line
which forced the Menlo third base
man to hurry his throw. The throw
pulled the first baseman off the
bag and into the firing line where
he collided with Marion and
dropped the ball.
By the time the ball was recov
ered, Weigand and Lindeman had
scored and Marion was perched on
second base.
