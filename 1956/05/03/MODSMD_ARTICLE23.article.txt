# Card Oarsmen Seek Win Against Bears Saturday
## 
### 
California, feared perennially as
a national rowing powerhouse and
three-time Olympic Games champ,
and Stanford, the up-and-coming
crew of this decade, race this Sat
urday on the Oakland Estuary.
Varsity shells compete at 5:15.
Freshman, junior varsity and
varsity boats compete in the dual
classic beginning at 4. The Frosh
race two miles, while the varsity
and JV squads row three miles.
All races finish at the Fruitvale
Avenue bridge. Tide and wind con
ditions necessitate late afternoon
starts.
The Indians out-oared the Bears

for the first time in 39 years last
season in coach Lou Lindsey's
first year as unsalaried mentor,
and the Cards take a slight edge
over Cal again this year in recog
nition of last year's performance
and Stanford's decisive win over
USC this year.
Olympic Winners
But, Ky Ebright's Bears have
other ideas, and past perform
ances during Olympic Game years
prove their ability to win the big
ones. California has nine national
collegiate titles and three world
championships tucked away.
Friday afternoon on the Oak
land Estuary, Stanford's and Cali
fornia's third varsity and second
frosh boats race in a preview of
what's to follow on Saturday aft
ernoon. Two boats from each
school race in each of the three
races Saturday.
Stanford has six returning var
s i t y crewmen who are backed
strongly by five returning JV
boatmen and the entire crew from
last year's Frosh boat. The var
sity is led by captain-elect Gordy
Best, stroke in the No. 1 shell.
B<*ars Lead
This will be the 27th meeting
between the two sports rivals.
The Cards have won 5 duels and
the Bears 21, mostly after 1917.
After losing by a length to Ore
gon State College last month, the

Lindsey-men got down to serious
practice for the Cal race. Both
crews beat USC, and the Bears
also dropped a close one to Troy
earlier in the season.
Stanford meets the Huskies of
Washington in Seattle May 12;
UCLA and USC at San Pedro May
19, and then heads east for the
National Intercollegiate Rowing
Regatta at Syracuse, N. Y., June
16, and the U.S. Olympic tryouts,
June 28, 29 and 30.
