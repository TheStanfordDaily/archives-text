# Progress vs. Security
## 
### 
THE FRUSTRATION OF SCIENTISTS who find ma
terial they need for scientific research stamped
"classified"' by the government and kept be
yond their reach for security reasons is indeed
a natural one.
It is also the inherent duty of newspapers and
the general public to question the right of the
government to suppress vital, but non-strategic
information.
With its propensity to hide behind the "classi
fied" label any information that hints of sec
recy or might be of political import to the op
posing party, the government often screens the
public off from news which, as citizens and
voters, they have a right to know.
The case of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer was
probably the most outstanding example of the
government's timidous super-caution in its ap
proach to the security problem; it was also a
blatant infringement of an American citizen's
right to persue his work free from arbitrary re
strictions and the smudge of derogatory allega
tions. *
The issue is not dead. Nor will it ever be so

long as tlie fear of war necessitates caution in
the release of strategic information.
Upon the government falls the gargantuan
responsibility of dividing the classified from
the non-classified, of judging on the merits of
each individual case whether progress will he
hindered by the cloaking of semi-classified in
formation.
Often in the past, the security aspect has been
over-stressed and progress blocked.
In the sense that security is never a static
thing, but dependent on constantly changing
conditions throughout the world, the govern
ment is only defeating itself by concentrating
on the negative rather than the positive.
Yesterday Defense Secretary Charles Wilson
confirmed rumors that the Russians have passed
us by in the development of hydrogen bombers,
leaving us with the thought that we probably
trail the Russians in other areas also.
The public's acquaintance with this has been
mainly through heresay; it is time the Admin
istration stood up and told us where we stand in
scientific and technological development.
