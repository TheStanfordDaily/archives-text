International Dinner
Editor, The Daily:
On April 28, the Stanford eating clubs very gen
erously donated their facilities to Ihe Institute of
International Relations enabling Iho foreign stu
dents to put on an international dinner. About
200 people were expected at the dinner, and almost
300 came.
American students had a first hand opportunity
1o meet ihe foreign students and got to know
ihern. All of the foreign students very much en
joyed talking to eating club members and other
Stanford students.
On behalf of the Institute of International Re
lations, Cosmo Club, and all the foreign students,
we would like to thank the eating clubs and ex
press our appreciation for Iheir help in making
the dinner a success.

On behalf of my candidate, Myron G. Apathy,
I request a recount of ihe vote for ASSU presi
dent. Your newspaper, The Stanford Daily, print
ed the "results" of yesterday's voting as giving
the maximum number of votes (a mere 1177) to
Mr. Freelen.
I maintain, however, that no vole at all is a vote
for Apathy. Therefore every vote not cast is ac
tually a definite vole for Apathy. Since Stanford
has about 7000 students eligible to vote, it is ap
parent that my candidate should have won by a
large margin in spite of the votes cast for other
candidates.
Obviously, if Mr. Freelen is allowed to take of
fice, Ihe feelings of the majority of Stanford stu
dents are not being justly represented. It is on
Ihese grounds that I desire the recount, or at least
a re-evaluation, of the vote for ASSU president.
