## 70 Long Years Ago Mrs. Stanford Nixed Partisanship—No Change Yet 
### DICK MEISTER Editor 
Because of provisions in Stan
ford's Founding Grant, University
officials have always insisted on
a policy of not allowing partisan
political activity on campus.
The provision they cite as basis
for such policy says in part: . .
The University must be forever
maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non-sectarian basis."
Such restriction on political ac
tivity is slight compared to that
found at many universities where
state politics enter the picture.
However, many students won
der why Stanford has even this
slight restriction. From all ap
pearances, the restriction is not
kept as a basic part of adminis
tration policy because of a desire
for strict interpretation of Mrs.
Stanford's desires expressed in
the light of events of 70 years ago.
Rather, it is kept in operation
because of the wishes of a some
what over-cautious Board of Trus
tees and University administra
tion.
As a result of this 70-year-old
ban on partisan activity, Young
Democratic and Young Republi
can groups have been forced to
hold their activities off-campus.
University rules say they must be
referred to as Stanford Area
Young Democrats or Republicans,
not as Stanford Young Democrats
or Republicans.
Some progress toward enlight
enment has been made by the
slow-moving Board of Trustees,
for in 1953 they approved the for
mation of the Political Union on
campus—an organization for po
litical evaluation and discussion.
The Union does have its inter
nal Republican and Democratic
caucuses, but they must remain

under the wing of the parent
union.
The partisan political activity
ban has both supporters and crit
ics among the student body:
Dick Bolton, '1)7, Toyon: "At
present we have a situation where
everybody loses. The partisan
groups are denied the advantages
and facilities of the campus. The
administration is unable to main
tain any surveillance over these
groups, for whose actions it may
be held responsible in the public
eye.
"Finally, the individual student
is handicapped in his contacts
with real political groups, and is
offered instead, more or less as a
sop, the Political Union.
"This outfit, inslead of co-oper
ating with the off-campus parti
san groups to achieve a well-,
rounded program, carries on or
ganizational dogfights with them,
such as the recent ridiculous 'cen
sure' episode. The best interests
of all clearly indicate bringing the
partisan groups on campus."
Kit Adams, '58, Stern: "How
could the Young Democrats and
Young Republicans have their
Friday afternoon 'lawn parties' if
they met on campus?"
(«ary Cinder, '57, Alpha Sigma
Phi: "The Young Republicans and
Young Democrats are interested
enough to participate in these or
ganizations, and the University is
not allowing them to pursue their
interests. This seems pointless to
me, especially during an election
year, when interest is at its
height."
Bob Richardson, '56, off - cam
pus: "By banning partisan politi
cal activity, the University implies
that something is wrong with po
litical parties. Actually they per
form a very important function

in our government and, on the
whole, are free from corruption.
"Wherever non-partisan politics
has flourished, public interest in
government has dwindled, and as
a consequence the quality of gov
ernment has diminished.
"Let's abandon ivory-tower
idealism and face the facts of poli
tics. The presence of partisan dis
cussions might well stimulate
greater interest in student gov
ernment here, too."
John Sturgeon, '57, Alpha Sig
ma Phi: "I think the barring of
partisan activity on the campus
tends to lead to a minimizing of
student interest in national poli
tics, an interest which is impor
tant in our system of responsible
government. This leaves Stanford
in the position of being in a politi
cal vacuum."
Sandra Bull, '59, Branner: "This
isn't a question of whether poli
tics should or should not lie al
lowed on campus. It is already
here.
"The question is whether or not
we should allow active political
campaigning on campus. I, for
one, do not want to see political
huckstering at Stanford.
"However, one should be allow
ed to examine the basic issues of
the political parties. To this end,
I feel that Political Union, as now
organized, serves the purpose."
Betsy Putraw, '57, Lagunita: "I
don't think an active political
group should be a campus-spon
sored organization. It could get
one-sided very easily. The present
set-up of political speakers at Cub
berley is as far as active politics
on campus should be allowed to
go. I think the University has
taken a realistic view of the situ
ation."

What do YOU think?
Because of provisions in Stan
ford's Founding Grant, University
officials have always insisted on
a policy of not allowing partisan
political activity on campus.
The provision they cite as basis
for such policy says in part: . .
The University must be forever
maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non-sectarian basis."
Such restriction on political ac
tivity is slight compared to that
found at many universities where
state politics enter the picture.
However, many students won
der why Stanford has even this
slight restriction. From all ap
pearances, the restriction is not
kept as a basic part of adminis
tration policy because of a desire
for strict interpretation of Mrs.
Stanford's desires expressed in
the light of events of 70 years ago.
Rather, it is kept in operation
because of the wishes of a some
what over-cautious Board of Trus
tees and University administra
tion.
As a result of this 70-year-old
ban on partisan activity, Young
Democratic and Young Republi
can groups have been forced to
hold their activities off-campus.
University rules say they must be
referred to as Stanford Area
Young Democrats or Republicans,
not as Stanford Young Democrats
or Republicans.
Some progress toward enlight
enment has been made by the
slow-moving Board of Trustees,
for in 1953 they approved the for
mation of the Political Union on
campus—an organization for po
litical evaluation and discussion.
The Union does have its inter
nal Republican and Democratic
caucuses, but they must remain

under the wing of the parent
union.
The partisan political activity
ban has both supporters and crit
ics among the student body:
Dick Bolton, '1)7, Toyon: "At
present we have a situation where
everybody loses. The partisan
groups are denied the advantages
and facilities of the campus. The
administration is unable to main
tain any surveillance over these
groups, for whose actions it may
be held responsible in the public
eye.
"Finally, the individual student
is handicapped in his contacts
with real political groups, and is
offered instead, more or less as a
sop, the Political Union.
"This outfit, inslead of co-oper
ating with the off-campus parti
san groups to achieve a well-,
rounded program, carries on or
ganizational dogfights with them,
such as the recent ridiculous 'cen
sure' episode. The best interests
of all clearly indicate bringing the

The provision they cite as basis
for such policy says in part: . .
The University must be forever
maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non-sectarian basis."
Such restriction on political ac
tivity is slight compared to that
found at many universities where
state politics enter the picture.
However, many students won
der why Stanford has even this
slight restriction. From all ap
pearances, the restriction is not
kept as a basic part of adminis
tration policy because of a desire
for strict interpretation of Mrs.
Stanford's desires expressed in
the light of events of 70 years ago.
Rather, it is kept in operation
because of the wishes of a some
what over-cautious Board of Trus
tees and University administra
tion.
As a result of this 70-year-old
ban on partisan activity, Young
Democratic and Young Republi
can groups have been forced to
hold their activities off-campus.
University rules say they must be
referred to as Stanford Area
Young Democrats or Republicans,
not as Stanford Young Democrats
or Republicans.
Some progress toward enlight
enment has been made by the
slow-moving Board of Trustees,
for in 1953 they approved the for
mation of the Political Union on
campus—an organization for po
litical evaluation and discussion.
The Union does have its inter
nal Republican and Democratic
caucuses, but they must remain

under the wing of the parent
union.
The partisan political activity
ban has both supporters and crit
ics among the student body:
Dick Bolton, '1)7, Toyon: "At
present we have a situation where
everybody loses. The partisan
groups are denied the advantages
and facilities of the campus. The
administration is unable to main
tain any surveillance over these
groups, for whose actions it may
be held responsible in the public
eye.
"Finally, the individual student
is handicapped in his contacts
with real political groups, and is
offered instead, more or less as a
sop, the Political Union.
"This outfit, inslead of co-oper
ating with the off-campus parti
san groups to achieve a well-,
rounded program, carries on or
ganizational dogfights with them,
such as the recent ridiculous 'cen
sure' episode. The best interests
of all clearly indicate bringing the
partisan groups on campus."
Kit Adams, '58, Stern: "How
could the Young Democrats and
Young Republicans have their
Friday afternoon 'lawn parties' if
they met on campus?"
(«ary Cinder, '57, Alpha Sigma
Phi: "The Young Republicans and
Young Democrats are interested
enough to participate in these or
ganizations, and the University is
not allowing them to pursue their
interests. This seems pointless to
me, especially during an election
year, when interest is at its
height."
Bob Richardson, '56, off - cam
pus: "By banning partisan politi
cal activity, the University implies
that something is wrong with po
litical parties. Actually they per
form a very important function

in our government and, on the
whole, are free from corruption.
"Wherever non-partisan politics
has flourished, public interest in
government has dwindled, and as
a consequence the quality of gov
ernment has diminished.
"Let's abandon ivory-tower
idealism and face the facts of poli
tics. The presence of partisan dis
cussions might well stimulate
greater interest in student gov
ernment here, too."
John Sturgeon, '57, Alpha Sig
ma Phi: "I think the barring of
partisan activity on the campus
tends to lead to a minimizing of
student interest in national poli
tics, an interest which is impor
tant in our system of responsible
government. This leaves Stanford
in the position of being in a politi
cal vacuum."
Sandra Bull, '59, Branner: "This
isn't a question of whether poli
tics should or should not lie al
lowed on campus. It is already
here.
"The question is whether or not
we should allow active political
campaigning on campus. I, for
one, do not want to see political
huckstering at Stanford.
"However, one should be allow
ed to examine the basic issues of
the political parties. To this end,
I feel that Political Union, as now
organized, serves the purpose."
Betsy Putraw, '57, Lagunita: "I
don't think an active political
group should be a campus-spon
sored organization. It could get
one-sided very easily. The present
set-up of political speakers at Cub
berley is as far as active politics
on campus should be allowed to
go. I think the University has
taken a realistic view of the situ
ation."

Because of provisions in Stan
ford's Founding Grant, University
officials have always insisted on
a policy of not allowing partisan
political activity on campus.
