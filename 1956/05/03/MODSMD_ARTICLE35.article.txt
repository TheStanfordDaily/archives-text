# 'Silk Stockings' Good-Natured, Pleasantly Spiced Musical
## Gretchen Wyler Demonstrates There's Nothing Like Lingerie to Bring Out Woman in a Woman 
### Richard Mende 
Nearly everybody who likes sex
has a good time at a musical, for
it is dished up in generous pro
portions, set in lavish surround
ings and accompanied by tunes
that are likely to become the hits
of the day.
The best feature of "Silk Stock
ings," now at the Curran, is an
exuberant bawdiness, which for
the most part takes the form of
Gretchen Wyler, who does a de
lightful satire on Hollywood stars.
She stopped the show with "Sat
in and Silk," a number which
demonstrates conclusively, by
word and illustration, there is
nothing like expensive lingerie to
bring out the woman in a woman.
Miss Wyler delivers her songs in
a knockabout fashion exuding
equal parts of Parisian sex, Kan
sas vitality and her own personal
charm.
The book to "Silk Stockings,"
the collaborative effort of Messrs.
Kaufman, Burrows and Mac-
Grath, is probably best character
ized as serviceable. It keeps the
tremendous machinery of the mu
sical from creaking, even provid
ing a more substantial plot than
is thought necessary al these af
fairs.
But most of the humor relies on
gags rather than situation, and
the amusement from the dialogue
derives almost as much from our
feud with the Russians as from
intrinsic* wit. Two examples:
"Dead? I didn't even know he was
arrested"; and a book titled "Who
Was Who?" Still, it is fun and is
at its best when it is frankly

burlesque.
The plot, if anyone hasn't heard,
concerns the efforts of a Russian
cultural commissar to bring the
world-famous composer Peter Tly
itch Boroff (Philip Sterling) back
from Paris.
The three emissaries who come
to fetch him, and Ninotchka, who
comes to fetch the emissaries, are
seduced by the charms of Parisâ€”
made to seem even more charm
ing through the efforts of boroff's
conniving American agent, Don
Ameche.
Mr. Ameche, who falls in love
with the thoroughly indoctrinated
Ninotchka, is personable and
suave. Jan Sherwood as Ninotch
ka does about all she can with her
part, but she might have been a
little more convincing if she were
less rigid when spouting doctrine.
Cole Porter's music and Jo Mi
elziner's settings were all right,
but showed practically no trace
of what has made those names
outstanding in show business.
"Silk Stockings" is a tolerably
good-natured affair, pleasantly
spiced, and it is not too much
more than we expect from our
musicals.
