THE MANY LOVES
OF THORYVALD DOCKSTADER
W hen Thorwald Dockstader—sophomore, epicure, and sports
man-first took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first
brand of cigarettes that came to hand. No, indeed! He did what
any sophomore, epicure, and sportsman would do: he sampled
several brands and then picked the gentlest, tastiest, most
thumpingly, wondrously, unfailingly pleasing of all — Philip
Morris, of corris!
Similarly, when Thorwald Dockstader took up girls, he did
not simply select the first one who came along. No, indeed!
Thorwald sampled. He took out several likely girls and then he
compared their charms and then he made his choice.
His first date was with an English lit major named Elizabeth
Barrett Grish, a wisp of a girl with luminous eyes and a soul
that shimmered with a pale, unearthly beautv. Trippingly
trippingly, she walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat
with him behind a windward dune and listened to a sea shell
and sighed sweetly and took out a little gold pencil and a little
morocco notebook and wrote a little poem
-1 will lie upon the shore,
J will be a dreamer.
1 will feel the sea once more
Pounding on my femur.
Thorwald s second date was with a physical ed major named
Peaches Glendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile and a
size 18 neck. She took Ihorwald down to the cinder track wherfc
they jogged around thirty or forty times to open up the pores,

Then they played four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 36
holes of golf, nine innings of one-o-cat, four periods of rugger,
six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile and a quarter of leap frog.'
Then they worked out for a few hours on the parallel bars, the
flying rings, and the bongo board, and then went ten rounds
with the eight-ounce gloves. Then they had heaping bowls of
bran and whey, exchanged a manly handshake, and went home
to their respective whirlpool baths.
Thorwald's final date was with a golden-haired, creamy-browed,
green-eyed, red-lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi McEstway!
Totsi was not majoring in anything. As she often said, "Gee
whillikers, what's college for anyhow - to fill your head full of
morbid old facts, or to discover the shining essence that is
YOU?"
Totsi started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious res
taurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock
hen. From there they went to a de luxe movie palace where Totsi
had popcorn with butter and a bag of chocolate covered raisins
-also with butter. Then they went to a costly ballroom and
cha-cha'd till dawn, tipping the band wildly all the while. Then
they went to a Chinese restaurant where Totsi, unable to deci
pher the large and baffling menu, solved her problem by order
ing one of everything. Then Thorwald took her to the women's
dorm, boosted her in the window, and went downtown to wait
for the Morris Plan office to open. '
While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and
came to a decision. "It is clear," said Thorwald, "that I am not
yet ready for girls." "It is equally clear," he continued, "that
a man needs a gentle corooanion, and who," he asked, "will be
my gentle companion?" "Why, PHILIP MORRIS, of corris,"
he answered. "Philip Morris will be my tender comrade, my
solace and my strength, my friend in adversity, my shelter in
vicissitude, my boon and bosom buddy," and, so saying, Thor
wald lit a PHILIP MORRIS and was content. © Mm shuim.n, i««
Ihe milkers of Philip Morris, who hring you this column every
week, hope that Thorwald u'ill soon find the f>irl of his dreams, and
that they will make heuutiful smoke litifis together—uith I'hilip Morris,
of corris!
