# '56 Notices
## 
### 
Orders are still being taken at
the Bookstore for '56 programs
and announcements. The engraved
announcements sell for 15 cents,
and the white, leather-bound pro
grams cost $1.50.
The senior scroll, which will be
placed in the Quad along with
other '56 records, may still be
signed at the ASSU Office.
The senior ferryboat ride is set
for May 25. The boat will leave
Fisherman's Wharf at 9 p.m. and
return at midnight. Tickets for
the event will go on sale next
week, according to John Leland,
senior class president.
