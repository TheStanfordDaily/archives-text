# Suspended UCLA Student President Says Administration Seeks Scapegoat

The UCLA administration is seeking a scape
goat, not a remedy for its current problems with
student government, declared Irv Drasnin, sus
pended ASUCLA president, in an exclusive Daily
interview yesterday.
"I believe that my suspension is unjust, and I
think the Student Council feels it is too," Drasnin
said, in giving his side of the events leading up to
his ousting.
Drasnin stated that there has been friction be
tween the university and the student leaders since
the administration took over the Daily Bruin two
years ago and issued directives on editorial elec
tions.
"The Student Council either agreed to the di
rectives or they took effect anyway," Drasnin said.
"Everything came to a head this year."
The events leading to Drasnin's suspension be
gan last December with another Daily Bruin elec
tion in which some students used fake student
body cards to vote as many as ten times.
Drasnin admits that he and another council
member had heard rumors of the fake cards but
said nothing about them.
"I had no visual proof, only knowledge of the
intent to use them. Also, there is no unanimity
even now among the students whether aft officer
should be required to inform on his fellow stu
dents."
Drasnin said that later investigation showed
that there had been indiscretions on both sides and
no recommendation was made for punishment.
Later, the student council passed a resolution
condemning the election and censured school lead
ers, including Drasnin, who failed to restrain their
supporters.
However, according to Drasnin, the Dean of
Students' Committee on Student Conduct decided

the censure was not strong enough and removed
Drasnin from student activities for his part in
the election.
"I am not thoroughly convinced that this was
the only reason," Drasnin said. "The suspension
came forth months after the election, three weeks
after the censure, and only one day after I had
cast the tie-breaking vote not to carry out the ad
ministration's latest directive.
This directive had been handed down a few
weeks earlier by the Dean of Students. It changed
the composition of the Student Council and or
dered that the ASUCLA constitution be revised
within a year.
Drasnin commented that much of the content of
the Dean's latest directive was unnecessary in
any event. The student council had already be
gun moving to consider proposals for a new con
stitution.
The directive also ordered that more stringent
election rules be introduced. Drasnin said that
he and the election board chairman had just fin
ished drawing up the most stringent proposals
he had ever seen before the edict was handed
down.
Drasnin's tie-breaking vote resulted in the ad
ministration taking over this year's student elec
tions, removing them completely from Student
Council control
About 700 grad students with ASUCLA cards
have been disenfranchised by the university's rul
ing that this will be an undergraduate election.
The money of these students, as well as of
those eligible to vote, is being used by the uni
versity without Student Council consent, accord
ing to Drasnin.
Two members of the Student Council have con
sulted a lawyer to see whether these expenditures
are legal, Drasnin said, but there has been no
decision as yet.
