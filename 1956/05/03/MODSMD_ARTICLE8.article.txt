## Indian Says His Country Respects U.S. Friendliness 
### 
"India has great admiration for the American people's friendliness
and generosity, but it looks with opposite views on the United State's
political and economic policies."
With these words of introduction, Dr. Eddy Asirvathan went on to
justify and explain his views on the situation of United States-Indian

relations at an lIR-sponsofed talk
at Bowman Alumni House yes
terday.
The topic "Is the United States
Losing Out in India?" was an
swered by Dr. Asirvathan with:
"Both yes and no, but I would say
most ly yes."
The Indian statesman elaborat
ed on reasons why and why not
the U.S. was "losing" in India.
His main criticism concerned the
economic and technical assistance
programs. He said it is not well
managed, mainly because the U.S.
is not aware of the needs and situ
ation nf the Indian people. "If you
want to help Asia, you must plan
with the Asians. This occurs not
because you don't want to help,
but because of carelessness."
However, the program itself is
very beneficial to the people, he
said, "but instead of free gifts
we'd rather you give us a long
term loan."
Reasons for the United States'
unpopularity in India are the un
complimentary remarks directed
at Prime Minister Jawaharal Ne
hru: "Every time you haul Nehru
over coals of fire, you lose out,"
he explained.
