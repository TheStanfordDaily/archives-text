# New Farm Bill Passes House With Ike's 'Soil Bank' Plan
## Representatives Approve Bill by Roll-Call Vote of 314 to 78; Now Goes to Senate 
### 
W ASHING lON, May 3 (UP)—Tho House today passed a new farm
bill, including an enlarged $1.25 billion soil bank, after twice rejecting
Ii esident Eisenhowers request for authority to make "advance pay
ments" this year.
The bill was approved by a roll call vote of 314 to 78. It now goes
to the Senate.
The bill does not contain tho rigid high price supports or two plans

for wheat and rice which prompted
President Eisenhower to veto the
first Democratic farm bill 17 days
ago.
Although it contained one fea
ture opposed by Eisenhower
higher price supports for feed
grains—Democratic leaders pre
dicted Eisenhower would sign it if
it clears the Senate in its present
form.
Reverses Cotton Supports *™~"
Shortly before the final vote,
the House reversed itself and vot
ed 208 to 186 against raising cot
ton price supports. On an earlier
standing vote the lawmakers had
decided to boost supports from
82.5 to 84 per cent of the "fail
parity price."
The big fight came on two un
successful GOP efforts to author
ize the administration to pay farm
ers in "advance" this year for con
tracting to put surplus-producing
acres into the soil bank next year.
Democrats, assailing the pro
posal as unsound, charged the ad
vance payments would be used to
buy votes in the November elec
tions. Republicans said the only
aim was to give hard-pressed
farmers some ready cash.
Before the first showdown on
this issue—vyhich the Democrats
won 181 to 157—Rep. Wayne L.
Hays iD-O.i tried unsuccessfully
to label the proposed advance pay
ment a "political expenditure."
No Reports to Clerk
Members, amidst laughter, vot
ed down, 125 to 102, his proposal
to require that all such payments
be reported to the Clerk of the
House, like other political outlays.
The GOP made another bid for
approval of the prepayment plan
just prior to final passage of the
bill but were defeated by a roll
call vote of 211 to 184.
The soil hank, starting this year,
would provide payments to farm
ers of up to $1.25 billion annually
for four years, but not until they
actually have reduced their plant
ings of surplus crops.
