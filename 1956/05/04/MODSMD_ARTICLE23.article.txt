# The 						Tyranny Spreads

### 
I 111 ADMINISTRATIVE TYRANNY AT UCLA has
pread its tentacles to the main nniversijy at
Berkeley. Not content v\ith their complete au
thoritarian control.in VV estwood, the UCLA ad
iniiiistration has taken a slap at the student
government up north.
Raymond B. Allen, the UCLA chancellor, has
written a letter to the student body at Cal in
which he disapproves of editorials which have
appeared in the Daily Californian, student
m w-paper at Berkeley.
The editorials were an honest and frank ex
pression of disgust over the UCLA administra
lion's move in taking over the student govern
nit lit at the southern school.
Some ol the Daily Cal's comments:
". . . As free eitizens, students have the right
fo organize, elect representatives and publish
opinion."
"'I hose responsible for tin' protection of stu
dent prerogatives have usurped student prerog
atives by force."
". . . Meanwhile the council met in the coun
eil room and read the king's new rules. They
•cut a message to the king saying they didn't
like the rules and wouldn't accept them.
"So the king ran the elections hiniselL He
look control over the councils election funds."

Anil iliis is what happened at UCLA — tin*
"kill}:'' (llu* UCLA administration) sent down
a direetive which the UCLA student legislative
council turned down, and then the "king" ran
(is running) the student elections —with stu
dent funds (used without student permission).
Chancellor Allen didn't like such comment.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, Mr. Allen?
Worse yet — the California students them
selves have fallen under the authoritarian spell
of the all-powerful Alien. Student hody presi
dent Bob Hamilton has taken the editorial writ
ers to task and a special meeting has heen
planned to discuss "the policy hehind the vari
ous articles on UCLA."
He thinks the editorials "have not heen help
ing the situation. Ww wonder to which situa
tion Hamilton is referring? That of the tyran
nical administrators, or tluit of the students of
which Hamilton is supposedly a leader?
II the Daily Cal does not stand up to hucli
ridiculous usurping of free press rights, which
include the inalienable right to print the truth
and a paper's opinions, the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley will find itself in the same
position as its southern campus—ruled hy de
cree from above, not by democracy from below.
Thank God the press and the student gov
ernment are still free at Stanford.
