Editor, The Daily:
The question of whether Stanford students are
apathetic towards student government seems to
be a problem of current concern;«for those who
feel that apathy is the case, we think we may have
some reasons why this condition exists.
Recently, in some of the house meetings at Wil
bur, the men asked their Wilbur Exeom represen
tatives to see about revising a dress regulation
which the same exeom had made previously this
year.
in a regular excom meeting, by proper proced
ure, the issue was voted. After the voting was
over, Mrs. Sumner, director of the hall, who is
present at all meetings, told the excom to cheek
with the Dean of Men to see if the decision was
valid. (The revision was for sport shirts instead
of coats and ties for the Sunday dinners during
spring quarter.)
Needless to say, the unanimous choice had been
for the change, and it is probably also needless to
add that the work of the excom was marie invalid
by the University.
As freshmen at Stanford we are still slightly
"red hot" from high school, and about many of
ihe class members still lingers the sweetness of
success in student government; and if not, they
certainly looked forward to it here.
After experiencing a few setbacks on such
simple problems as the one described above, it

seems likely that we, too, will lose all interest
and hope of governing ourselves.

lias noted that his office is glad to consider any
recommendations concerning such matters, but
that responsibility and decision for dress regu
lations at Wilbur rests with the University and
not, with the freslunen.
(Last fall the "coat ami tie 011 Sunday" regu
lation was effected by the University in an at
tempt to "improve the general tone" in the
dormitory. Craig considers such social training
as 11 necessary part of a student's education).
Sophomore, .junior ami senior men students
set their own dress rules through individual liv
ing group voting.
All women students —including freshmen —
also set their own dress regulations to apply
within their own living group, by a general
house vote at a house meeting. These regula
tions usually include a rule requiring "dressy
dresses and heels" at Sunday dinners.
On-campus dress regulations for women are
decided by AW'S rules which have been voted
on hy women students at large.
There are 110 general campus dress regula
tions for men.

Editor, The Daily:
The question of whether Stanford students are
apathetic towards student government seems to
be a problem of current concern;«for those who
feel that apathy is the case, we think we may have
some reasons why this condition exists.
Recently, in some of the house meetings at Wil
bur, the men asked their Wilbur Exeom represen
tatives to see about revising a dress regulation
which the same exeom had made previously this
year.
in a regular excom meeting, by proper proced
ure, the issue was voted. After the voting was
over, Mrs. Sumner, director of the hall, who is
present at all meetings, told the excom to cheek
with the Dean of Men to see if the decision was
valid. (The revision was for sport shirts instead
of coats and ties for the Sunday dinners during
spring quarter.)
Needless to say, the unanimous choice had been
for the change, and it is probably also needless to
add that the work of the excom was marie invalid
by the University.
As freshmen at Stanford we are still slightly
"red hot" from high school, and about many of
ihe class members still lingers the sweetness of
success in student government; and if not, they
certainly looked forward to it here.
After experiencing a few setbacks on such
simple problems as the one described above, it

seems likely that we, too, will lose all interest
and hope of governing ourselves.

Editor's Note: I)ean of Men William Craig
lias noted that his office is glad to consider any
recommendations concerning such matters, but
that responsibility and decision for dress regu
lations at Wilbur rests with the University and
not, with the freslunen.
(Last fall the "coat ami tie 011 Sunday" regu
lation was effected by the University in an at
tempt to "improve the general tone" in the
dormitory. Craig considers such social training
as 11 necessary part of a student's education).
Sophomore, .junior ami senior men students
set their own dress rules through individual liv
ing group voting.
All women students —including freshmen —
also set their own dress regulations to apply
within their own living group, by a general
house vote at a house meeting. These regula
tions usually include a rule requiring "dressy
dresses and heels" at Sunday dinners.
On-campus dress regulations for women are
decided by AW'S rules which have been voted
on hy women students at large.
There are 110 general campus dress regula
tions for men.
