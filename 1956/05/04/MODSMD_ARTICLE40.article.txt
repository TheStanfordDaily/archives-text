# Varsity Swimmers Fly South to USC
## 
### 
Varsity swimmers fly south to
day to meet USC in what should
be the closest dual contest to face
the Indians in five years.
The smallest traveling squad
since 1948 will go south.
The Indians have a record of
59 straight dual meet victories
over a six-year span.
Commenting on the situation,
swim bass Tom Haynie said, "I
know we've got them whipped,
but if we should suffer a bad
break, such as a relay disqualifi
cation, it could lead to our first
defeat in a long time."
In the freestyle, it will be Car
ver Nixon, Robin Moore, Tad De
vine, Tom Burton, Phil Gay and
Doug Aekerman. Breast and but
terfly events will be taken care of
bv Bill Hynes, Cole Wilbur and
Fred Miller. Lone backstroker is
Ron Grunt. Joe Critchfield and
Bob Mclntyre will handle the div
ing.
