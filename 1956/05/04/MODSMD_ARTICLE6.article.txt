## Is Ordered to Show Cause by May 10 Or Admit Press, Public 
### 
SACRAMENTO, May 3 (UP) â€”
The Third District Court of Ap
peals today refused to stop a mur
der trial where the press and the
public have been excluded by the
trial judge.
Sonoma County Superior Judge
Donald Geary has excluded the
press and public from the'murder
trial of Mrs. Charlotte Black, ac
cused of killing her husband Feb.
25. It was reported she shot her
husband after he forced her into
an act of sexual perversion.
The Third District Court issued
an alternative writ of mandate
telling Judge Geary either to ad
mit the press and public or to
"show cause" May 10 why he did
not do so.
"Meager Record"
But the appellate court said
"the meager record ... is not suf
ficient to warrant arbitrary in
terference with Ihe conduct of the
present proceedings in the trial
court."
Thus, the effect of the court
order is to lead to a determination
for handling such California cases
in the future, but have no effect
on the Black murder trial itself.
The Black trial will be completed
by May 10.
Geary said Mrs. Black broke
down under cross-examination to
day, but would not disclose the
nature of her testimony.
He said, however, Mrs. Black's
testimony was "shocking" and
said "I'm very glad I made the
I exclusion | order. I know in my
heart that I am right."
Reviewed Decision
Justice Paul Peek of the Third
District Court said the court re
viewed the Valente - United Press
decision in New York before is
suing the alternative writ.
Peek said that in the New York
Court of Appeals* decision, the
court ruled the guarantee of a
public trial is a right of the de
fendant which does not necessari
ly extend as a right of the gen
eral public and the press.
Petitioners attempting to open
the California case included the
Hearst Publishing Co., the Chron
icle Publishing Co., the Press-
Democrat Publishing Co., Santa
Rosa, and McClatchy Newspa
pers, Sacramento.
