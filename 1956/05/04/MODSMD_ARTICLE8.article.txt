on committees sponsoring class
functions.

establish an activities committee
made up of representatives from
the various living groups where
the sophomores are present.-
"This committee, as I see it,
would be headed by the president
of the class, who would coordinate
excom and the committee. The
purpose of the committee would
be to inform members of the class
