# PCC Penalizes Huskies For Using 'Slush Fund'
## Out of Conference Ratings, Pasadena Games Two Years 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 6 (UP)
—The University of Washington
was banned for two years from
conference ratings, all post-season
sports participation, and fined the
equivalent of $."33,000 as the Pacific
Coast Conference levelled its
heaviest disciplinary action in his
tory.
In the most drastic action ever
taken in the West, the PCG
slapped Washington for its "know
ing participation" in the so-called
"Slush Fund" that helped athletes.
In a report after a two-day hear
ing on the disbursal of money for
athletes at the university, the Con
ference:
• Placed Washington on proba
tion until July 1, 1958, and there
after until such time as the Con
ference may terminate such pro
bationary status after satisfactory
evidence and assurances are pro
vided to the Conference from
which it shall appear that the
athletic program of the institution
then is and will continue to be op
erated upon a sound basis.
• That during that period of
such probation: a > the school shall
not be considered for selection as
the Conference representative in
the Rose Bowl; b) shall not be per
mitted to participate in any post
season athletic event or divisional
or Conference championship ath
letic event; c) shall not be eligible ;
for listing or consideration as di
visional or Conference champion; j
di shall not be permitted to par
ticipate in any NCAA sponsored I
athletic event.
• That during the period of its
probation, Washington shall not
be entitled or permitted to par
ticipate in the distribution of the
receipts of the Rose Bowl, includ
ing receipts for radio and televi
sion rights from the Rose Bowl
game, and all other receipts which
now are or may hereafter be in
eluded in the total receipts of Iho j
Rose Bowl game. (Last year each i
school received about $26,700 as;
its share of the receipts, so the
two-year loss would total around i
$53,000).
• Shall not be permitted to ap-1
pear on any national television;
program from its home grounds.
• All contact between the so-;
called Greater Washington Adver- j
tising Fund and prospective stu
dents at University of Washington j
shall be discontinued and such
discontinuance shall be for an in
definite period of time until tor-1
minated by the Conference.
• The University shall be di-j
rooted to present at the winter I
1956 meeting of the Conference
evidence which shall clearly dem
onstrate that the Greater Wash
ington Advertising Fund has been
completely and finally dissolved
and discontinued.
• The University is directed to
present to that meeting a detailed j
account of the steps and proced- j
ures taken to secure information
as to the identity of the students
of the university who were recip
ients of financial aid from the
fund.
In another, and separate action,
the PCC ruled ineligible all stu
dents who had received "loans"
from the Evergreen Educational
Foundation until such time as the
loans have been fully repaid.
The action followed disclosure
three months ago of a fund, not
administered by the school under
Conference regulations, by which
athletes (mostly football players)
were paid an average of $60 a
month above the Conference pay
rate of $75 a month.
(Torrance has said the fund was
used "primarily for transporta
tion, entertainment and expenses
for prospective athletes." Former
coach Johnny Cher berg has
charged he was fired because "Mr.
Torrance was faced with the pos
sibility of giving up this so-called
fund.")
The Conference report, com
piled by Commissioner Victor O.
Schmidt, stated that $28,000 had
been contributed to the Greater
Washington Advertising Fund in
Mid-1955; that head football coach
Cherberg (and others connected
with the school) knew of the fund;
and that a considerable number of
athletes were receiving aid from
this fund.
The session of athletic directors
and Conference faculty represen
tatives concluded tonight without
any action on the so-called "under
the table" payments at UCLA.
Action on this is expected to be
taken when tly next session of
the group is held at Victoria, 8.C.,
May 18-23.

Rose Bowl game. (Last year each i
school received about $26,700 as;
its share of the receipts, so the
two-year loss would total around i
$53,000).
• Shall not be permitted to ap-1
pear on any national television;

called Greater Washington Adver- j
tising Fund and prospective stu
dents at University of Washington j
shall be discontinued and such
discontinuance shall be for an in
definite period of time until tor-1
minated by the Conference.
• The University shall be di-j
rooted to present at the winter I
1956 meeting of the Conference
evidence which shall clearly dem
onstrate that the Greater Wash
ington Advertising Fund has been
completely and finally dissolved
and discontinued.
• The University is directed to
present to that meeting a detailed j
account of the steps and proced- j
ures taken to secure information
as to the identity of the students
of the university who were recip
ients of financial aid from the
fund.
In another, and separate action,
the PCC ruled ineligible all stu
dents who had received "loans"
from the Evergreen Educational
Foundation until such time as the
loans have been fully repaid.
The action followed disclosure
three months ago of a fund, not
administered by the school under
Conference regulations, by which
athletes (mostly football players)
were paid an average of $60 a
month above the Conference pay
rate of $75 a month.
(Torrance has said the fund was
used "primarily for transporta
tion, entertainment and expenses
for prospective athletes." Former
coach Johnny Cher berg has
charged he was fired because "Mr.
Torrance was faced with the pos
sibility of giving up this so-called
fund.")
The Conference report, com
piled by Commissioner Victor O.
Schmidt, stated that $28,000 had
been contributed to the Greater
Washington Advertising Fund in
Mid-1955; that head football coach
Cherberg (and others connected
with the school) knew of the fund;
and that a considerable number of
athletes were receiving aid from
this fund.
The session of athletic directors
and Conference faculty represen
tatives concluded tonight without
any action on the so-called "under
the table" payments at UCLA.
Action on this is expected to be
taken when tly next session of

Conference regulations, by which
athletes (mostly football players)
were paid an average of $60 a
month above the Conference pay
rate of $75 a month.
(Torrance has said the fund was
used "primarily for transporta
tion, entertainment and expenses
for prospective athletes." Former
coach Johnny Cher berg has
charged he was fired because "Mr.
Torrance was faced with the pos
sibility of giving up this so-called
fund.")
The Conference report, com
piled by Commissioner Victor O.
Schmidt, stated that $28,000 had
been contributed to the Greater
Washington Advertising Fund in
Mid-1955; that head football coach
Cherberg (and others connected
with the school) knew of the fund;
and that a considerable number of
athletes were receiving aid from
this fund.
The session of athletic directors
and Conference faculty represen
tatives concluded tonight without
any action on the so-called "under
the table" payments at UCLA.
Action on this is expected to be
taken when tly next session of
the group is held at Victoria, 8.C.,
May 18-23.
