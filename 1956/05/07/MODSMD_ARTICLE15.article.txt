# Time for a House-Cleaning

Tuf. Pacific Coast Conference has stepped
in and put the squelch on the University of
Wa hiugton and its football "slush fund," and
in doing so has meted out the heaviest penalty
in conference history.
I he penalty was deserved. From its past per
formances one would judge the PCC commis
sioners are a conservative group who would not
make such a drastic move unless events most
assuredly warranted it. In fact, it was the least
they could have done if they were to put PCC
athletics back on a sane basis.
The University of Washington does not de
serve any sympathy, they took their chances
and they lost.
The Washington mess leaves in its aftermath
the knowledge that the Huskies are not the only
ones they just happened to get caught.
This is no time for the other conference
schools to assume a "holier-than-thou" attitude,
for they have all, including Stanford, been
guilty of varying degrees of professionalism in
their pursuance of "/iiiateur" football.
This "heaviest-yet*' penalty is probably only
the first move in a seriously-needed cleanup of
PCC football practices.
It is now or never for the commissioners.
Fit her move now and stop the widespread viola
tions or ignore them and see PCC football as
sume an all-out professional aspect.
We can see how a university would be guilty
of professional conduct. College professional
ism is not right, but it is understandable.
College athletics have become big business
with universities receiving astronomical sums
as their share of gate receipts. The very people"
who make these receipts possible—the players
— are still expected to remain amateurs, with
the university exploiting them lor the money
and prestige their talents bring.
In order to improve that talent and conse
quently to produce a winner that will bring in
even more money to the athletic coffers players
are avidly proselyted and the competition for
iheir services leads to such things as the Wash
ington "slush fund" or the University of Cali
fornia "Southern Seas" or to the Stanford "Buck
Club."
Let's face it, most college football players are
not real amateurs, they are just professionals to
varying degrees. The degree of professionalism
depends 011 how willing the university they at
tend is to help them through college, either
through direct financial aid, or indirectly
through scholarships.
As we said, the practice of "play-for-pay"
athletes in college is not to be condoned, but
it is to be understood. With college athletics
going big business the whole theory of amateur
ism has been revised.
No one has defined this revision so well as
San Francisco Chronicle columnist Bill Leiser,
an ex-Daily editor. Savs Bill:

. . the new idea is quite simple. The con
tention is that amateurs should be paid. Wages
should be limited, but amateurs should be paid
a living wage. Forget the idea that amateurs
are persons who compete for nothing, or for
I'uii, and at the outside can accept only com
pensation for personal costs of competition.
"The proposal that a college athlete should
receive whatever it cogts him to live is a pro
posal that the man he paid all eosts of a college
education for being, say, a football player.
"There's not a shred of'amateurism' in that.*"
As Leiser points up, the feeling under this
new definition of amateurism is that the rules
are outdated—and that they should be changed
to make them more "realistic' "in this age of big
business athletics on campus.
He goes on to say:
"The rules do need some changes, but hardly
1o the extent of making amateurs nothing more
than low pay professionals.
"Our own old idea of what college rules
should be, we suppose, will never have a chance
of acceptance. We start with the simple idea
that colleges and universities are attended only
by students who wish to learn something . . .
"Our only rule would be' that any bonafide
undergraduate student should be eligible to
compete on any intercollegiate team represent
ing the university whose faculty certifies him
as competent and in good standing.
"If he's not a satisfactory student, let the fac
%
ulty throw him out. If he is a satisfactory stu
dent, let him compete in anything no matter
whose uncle helps him through college . . .
"It actually was that way once, and we never
had any agitation to pay athletes the cost of
living; and we never had cases in which code
violations were defended by the contention that
rules were unreasonable, outdated, and in need
of change to make right of what was accepted
as wrong."
Now it appears that the PCC commissioners
are moving in the direction of putting Leiser's
ideas of what rules should be into practice. We
hope they go all the way.
For until they are put into practice, the col
lege football player in almost every case will
never deserve the title of "amateur" and there
will always be cases like that at the University
of Washington — where someone was playing
the game by the same "rules" as its contempo
raries hut had the poor luck to be caught in
violation of the other "rules" which are given
mere lip service by 99 per cent of today's com
petitors in intercollegiate football.
I his latest move by the PCC commissioners
is the only one that could have been made if
PCC football was to be given back to those to
whom it belongs—the real amateurs.
We hope they will go even further and
tli oroughly clean house. There are other viola
tors —much worse than the University of Wash
ington.
