## Cal Wins Joffre Debate (This Year) 
### George Phelps 
"When the Stanford team
walked across the stage to their
ante-room on the further side, they
were cheered heartily." This was
the account of the annual Joffre
Debate which appeared in the
Daily Palo Alto of 1900 (now the
Stanford Daily).
"The men with red vests and the
women with cardinal streamers
arose as a body and assured the
team that they were 'all right,' "
the account continued.
Last Thursday night witnessed
the 62nd year of this greatest of
all intercollegiate forensic rival
ries in which Keith Jewell of the
University of California won the
first-place medal. Steve Breyer of
Stanford took second place honors,
and Cal's Howard Streifford. came
in third.
Traveling to Berkeley, the Stan
ford team of three met their UC
opponents at 4:30 in the afternoon.
The debate's general topic, "Post
war Franco-German relations,"
had been selected three months
prior to the debate, but the speci
fic question was not opened until
three frantic hours before the 8
p.m. starting time: "Resolved,
That France should have ratified
the treaty creating a European
Defense Community."
While the coaches from the two
universities, faculty, guests, and
members of the Alliance Francaise
(a French society which sponsors
the contest) went to a pre-debate
banquet, the six contestants shut
themselves in separate rooms to
consult their books and plan their
attacks.
The contest is not necessarily
between the two schools, but
among the individual speakers.
The Joffre medal goes to the first
place winner and not the team as
a whole. And the rules for this
oldest and most unique debate in
the country also state that neither
of the schools can have all their
members on one team, nor can
there be less than two debaters on
any side.

The speakers are only allowed i
15 minutes for their arguments.!
Usually they will spend eight or i
nine minutes on a constructive
speech and six or seven on a re
buttal when their turn comes
around again.
The Joffre medal, established by
a French baron, Pierre de Couber
tin, was named in honor of Mar
shall Joffre, one of France's great
World War I heroes. Originally,
when it was first offered in 1891,
the award was named for Sadi
Carnot, martyred President of
France. It was changed to its pres
ent title in 1917.
When UC's campanile struck 8
bells, the debaters entered the
University's Dwinelle Hall to be
applauded by an audience of 150
who braved the rain to attend.
Stanford's Elizabeth Marshall was
the first to speak. She was fol
lowed by Princeton Lyman, UC;
Breyer; Dobie Langenkamp, Stan
ford; Streifford, and Jewell.
The debate has another tradi
tion; the five judges are always
men of responsibility and often
times national fame. There have
been Supreme Court justices,
presidents of famous universities,
and noted churchmen, sit in as

judges. This year's slate was no
different. Dr. Stuart Anderson,
President of the Pacific Schoolof
Religion, and Rabbi Saul White of
Temple Beth Sholom, San Fran
cisco, were two theologian judges;
Bernard Wit kin, attorney and San
Francisco legal scholar represent
ed the bar; Earl Behrens, political
editor of the Chronicle, viewed the
proceedings through the eyes of a
newspaperman; and the Hon.
Louis E. Goodman, a United States
District Court Judge, assumed a
second judgeship for the night.
The record now stands at 31
wins apiece for the two schools,
with the debate next year to be
held at Stanford. This "Big Game"
of the debating world (to which
some 2000 Stanford students in
1924 once boarded a special train
and traveled to Berkeley, complete
with cheering section, yell leaders
and a brass band), promises to be
a hotly contested affair next year
when it hits the campus.

"When the Stanford team
walked across the stage to their
ante-room on the further side, they
were cheered heartily." This was
the account of the annual Joffre
Debate which appeared in the
Daily Palo Alto of 1900 (now the
Stanford Daily).
"The men with red vests and the
women with cardinal streamers
arose as a body and assured the
team that they were 'all right,' "
the account continued.
Last Thursday night witnessed
the 62nd year of this greatest of
all intercollegiate forensic rival
ries in which Keith Jewell of the
University of California won the
first-place medal. Steve Breyer of
Stanford took second place honors,
and Cal's Howard Streifford. came
in third.
Traveling to Berkeley, the Stan
ford team of three met their UC
opponents at 4:30 in the afternoon.
The debate's general topic, "Post
war Franco-German relations,"
had been selected three months
prior to the debate, but the speci
fic question was not opened until
three frantic hours before the 8
p.m. starting time: "Resolved,
That France should have ratified
the treaty creating a European
Defense Community."
While the coaches from the two
universities, faculty, guests, and
members of the Alliance Francaise
(a French society which sponsors
the contest) went to a pre-debate
banquet, the six contestants shut
themselves in separate rooms to
consult their books and plan their
attacks.
The contest is not necessarily
between the two schools, but
among the individual speakers.
The Joffre medal goes to the first
place winner and not the team as
a whole. And the rules for this
oldest and most unique debate in
the country also state that neither
of the schools can have all their
members on one team, nor can
there be less than two debaters on
any side.

The speakers are only allowed i
15 minutes for their arguments.!
Usually they will spend eight or i
nine minutes on a constructive
speech and six or seven on a re
buttal when their turn comes
around again.
The Joffre medal, established by
a French baron, Pierre de Couber
tin, was named in honor of Mar
shall Joffre, one of France's great
World War I heroes. Originally,
when it was first offered in 1891,
the award was named for Sadi
Carnot, martyred President of
France. It was changed to its pres
ent title in 1917.
When UC's campanile struck 8
bells, the debaters entered the
University's Dwinelle Hall to be
applauded by an audience of 150
who braved the rain to attend.
Stanford's Elizabeth Marshall was
the first to speak. She was fol
lowed by Princeton Lyman, UC;
Breyer; Dobie Langenkamp, Stan
