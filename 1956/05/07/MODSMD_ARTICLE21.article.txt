IT'S LATER THAN YOU THINK!
All year long you've been promising yourself to go
there. Now summer vacation is just around the corner and
you still haven't set foot in the place. Shame on you!
, But it's not too late. Right now, this very minute, before
you weaken, lift up your head and forward march to the
place you have been avoiding ever since school began. I refer,
of course, to the library.

Now here you are at the library. That wasn't so bad, was
it? Of course not! Go inside. What do you see? A sign that
says "No Smoking." Go outside. Light a Philip Morris.
Smoke. Go back inside.
Because now you are ready. Now your trembling
resolution is rigid. Now your pulsing psyche is serene. You
have been gentled by gentle Philip Morris. You have been
tranquilized by a smoke that dotes and pampers and caresses,
that lifts the fallen, repairs the shattered, straightens the
bent, unravels the knotted, rights the askew, and fastens the
unbuttoned.
In the center of the library you see the main circulation
desk. Look in the card catalogue for the number of the book
you want, write the number on a slip, and hand it to the
efficient and obliging young lady at the desk. The efficient
and obliging young lady then gives the slip to an efficient
and obliging page boy who trots briskly back into the stacks,
curls up on a limp leather encyclopedia, and sleeps for an
hour or two. Then, puffy but refreshed, he returns your slip
to the efficient and obliging young lady at the desk, who tells
you one of three things: (a) "Your book is out." (b) "Your
book is at the bindery." (c) "Your book is on reserve."
Having learned that the circulation desk the
least intention of ever parting with a book, let us now go
into the periodical room. Here we spend hours sifting through
an imposing array of magazines—magazines from all the far
corners of the earth, magazines of every nature and descrip
tion—but though we search diligently and well, we cannot
find Mad or Confidential.
Next let us venture into the reference room. Here in this
hushed, vaulted chamber, we find the true scholars of the
university — earnest, dedicated young men and women who
care for only one thing in the world: the pursuit of knowledge.
Let us eavesdrop for a moment on this erudite couple
poring over heavy tomes at the corner table. Hush! She
speaks:
She: Whatcha read in', hey?
He: "The Origin of Species." You ever read it?
She: No, but 1 seen the movie.
He: Oh.
She: You like readin'?
He: Naah.
She: What do you like?
He: Hockey, licorice, girls, stuff like that.
She: Me too, hey.
He: You pinned or anything?
She: Well, sort of. I'm wearin' a fellow's motorcycle
emblem.... But it's only platonic.
He: Wanna go out for a smoke?
She: Philip Morris?
He: Of corris!
And as our learned friends take their leave, let us too wend
our way homeward —a trifle weary, perhaps, but enlightened
and renewed and better citizens for having spent these happy
hours in the library. Aloha, librarv, aloha! 6 „, xShnta . n , 1958
The makerx of Philip Morris, who sponsor this column, could write
volumes about the gentleness of today'* I'liili/t Morris, hut we'll
only tell yon this: Take a leaf from our hook. Enjoy Philip Morrit.

All year long you've been promising yourself to go
there. Now summer vacation is just around the corner and
you still haven't set foot in the place. Shame on you!
, But it's not too late. Right now, this very minute, before
you weaken, lift up your head and forward march to the
place you have been avoiding ever since school began. I refer,
of course, to the library.

Now here you are at the library. That wasn't so bad, was
it? Of course not! Go inside. What do you see? A sign that
says "No Smoking." Go outside. Light a Philip Morris.
Smoke. Go back inside.
Because now you are ready. Now your trembling
resolution is rigid. Now your pulsing psyche is serene. You
have been gentled by gentle Philip Morris. You have been
tranquilized by a smoke that dotes and pampers and caresses,
that lifts the fallen, repairs the shattered, straightens the
bent, unravels the knotted, rights the askew, and fastens the
unbuttoned.
In the center of the library you see the main circulation
desk. Look in the card catalogue for the number of the book
you want, write the number on a slip, and hand it to the
efficient and obliging young lady at the desk. The efficient
and obliging young lady then gives the slip to an efficient
and obliging page boy who trots briskly back into the stacks,
curls up on a limp leather encyclopedia, and sleeps for an
hour or two. Then, puffy but refreshed, he returns your slip
to the efficient and obliging young lady at the desk, who tells
you one of three things: (a) "Your book is out." (b) "Your
book is at the bindery." (c) "Your book is on reserve."
Having learned that the circulation desk the
least intention of ever parting with a book, let us now go
into the periodical room. Here we spend hours sifting through
an imposing array of magazines—magazines from all the far
corners of the earth, magazines of every nature and descrip
tion—but though we search diligently and well, we cannot
find Mad or Confidential.
Next let us venture into the reference room. Here in this
hushed, vaulted chamber, we find the true scholars of the
university — earnest, dedicated young men and women who
care for only one thing in the world: the pursuit of knowledge.
Let us eavesdrop for a moment on this erudite couple
poring over heavy tomes at the corner table. Hush! She
speaks:
She: Whatcha read in', hey?
He: "The Origin of Species." You ever read it?
She: No, but 1 seen the movie.
He: Oh.
She: You like readin'?
He: Naah.
She: What do you like?
He: Hockey, licorice, girls, stuff like that.
She: Me too, hey.
He: You pinned or anything?
She: Well, sort of. I'm wearin' a fellow's motorcycle
emblem.... But it's only platonic.
He: Wanna go out for a smoke?
She: Philip Morris?
He: Of corris!
And as our learned friends take their leave, let us too wend
our way homeward —a trifle weary, perhaps, but enlightened
and renewed and better citizens for having spent these happy
hours in the library. Aloha, librarv, aloha! 6 „, xShnta . n , 1958
The makerx of Philip Morris, who sponsor this column, could write
volumes about the gentleness of today'* I'liili/t Morris, hut we'll
only tell yon this: Take a leaf from our hook. Enjoy Philip Morrit.
