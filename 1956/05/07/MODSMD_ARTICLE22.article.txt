# Up-and-Coming Crewmen Beat Bears by 3½ Lengths
## Stanford Wins on Estuary After 27 Years; Lindsey's Rowers Forge Ahead After Trailing 
### Jerry Kelly 
California lost their 30-year
command of the Oakland Estuary
late Saturday afternoon when
eight husky Indian oarsmen pull
ed the Stanford shell Farnsworth
across crew racing's three-mile
finish mark a comfortable three
and one-half lengths ahead of the
once-proud Bear's No. 1 boat.
Thus the Stanford varsity crew
proved last year's two and one
half length victory over Cal at
the Card's Redwood City course
was no fluke and Stanford is in
actuality the up-and-coming crew
in collegiate ranks.
First, in a Long Time
The water-tu£ging boys from
the Farm hadn't beaten UC on
their home course, the Oakland
Estuary, since 1915). Stanford's un
salaried coach, Lou Lindsey, may
now stand shoulder to shoulder
alongside Cal mentor Ky Ebright,
for years known as the old man
of the Estuary.
In preliminary races Saturday
California's junior varsity and
freshman shells scored wins over
Stanford's representatives by two
and one-fourth and two and three
fourths lengths, respectively.
In the Big Race the Bears, open
ing the matWi at the three-mile
start at a torrid 40-strokes-per
minute pace, pulled a half-length
in ihe lend after the first quarter
mile.
The Cards, in rowing their best
and smoothest race of the season,
after a relatively fast start drop
ped to a steady 30-strokes-per-min
ute pace, and, though Cal was
pulling faster, the Indians' shell
pulled alongside Cal's pride at the
half-mile mark and then slowly
gained the advantage.
Rhythm on the Blue
The courageous Cards rhyth
matically pulled their oars at be
tween 30 and 31 strokes per min
ute throughout the dual affair.
Meanwhile, a sometimes clumsy
Cal eight changed their beat to
34, then 30, again 34, and at the
finish were hitting at 35.
Stanford passed the one - mile
marker in four and one-half min
utes, with a quarter-length lead.
By the two-mile mark, the Cards
were a length and a half out front
and continued to pull away.
Stanford's time was 15 minutes
34 seconds —over 14 seconds fast
er than the Bear boat.
Cal's JV craft, also challenging
Stanford in a three-mile match,
took an early command with a
smooth stroke, and at the halfway
mark the Bears led by one length.
UC continued the race one beat
under the Indians, although pull
ing away. Both boats were forced

to veer to the l ight halfway flown
the cours-e to avoid a large
freighter leaving her dock.
The JV winning time was 16
minutes 20 seconds, with Cal
crossing the finish line nine sec
onds ahead of Stanford.
The Indian Frosh, coached by
Phil Waters, lost their race in the
first mile of the two-mile affair.
The Papooses started slow, and,
though out-oaring the Cal Cubs in
the second half, it was too late to
catch up. Cal won in 10 minutes
33 seconds.

first mile of the two-mile affair.
The Papooses started slow, and,
though out-oaring the Cal Cubs in
the second half, it was too late to
catch up. Cal won in 10 minutes
33 seconds.
California lost their 30-year
command of the Oakland Estuary
late Saturday afternoon when
eight husky Indian oarsmen pull
ed the Stanford shell Farnsworth
across crew racing's three-mile
finish mark a comfortable three
and one-half lengths ahead of the
once-proud Bear's No. 1 boat.
Thus the Stanford varsity crew
proved last year's two and one
half length victory over Cal at
the Card's Redwood City course
was no fluke and Stanford is in
actuality the up-and-coming crew
in collegiate ranks.
First, in a Long Time
The water-tu£ging boys from
the Farm hadn't beaten UC on
their home course, the Oakland
Estuary, since 1915). Stanford's un
salaried coach, Lou Lindsey, may
now stand shoulder to shoulder
alongside Cal mentor Ky Ebright,
for years known as the old man
of the Estuary.
In preliminary races Saturday
California's junior varsity and
freshman shells scored wins over
Stanford's representatives by two
and one-fourth and two and three
fourths lengths, respectively.
In the Big Race the Bears, open
ing the matWi at the three-mile
start at a torrid 40-strokes-per
minute pace, pulled a half-length
in ihe lend after the first quarter
mile.
The Cards, in rowing their best
and smoothest race of the season,
after a relatively fast start drop
ped to a steady 30-strokes-per-min
ute pace, and, though Cal was
pulling faster, the Indians' shell
pulled alongside Cal's pride at the
half-mile mark and then slowly
gained the advantage.
Rhythm on the Blue
The courageous Cards rhyth
matically pulled their oars at be
tween 30 and 31 strokes per min
ute throughout the dual affair.
Meanwhile, a sometimes clumsy
Cal eight changed their beat to
34, then 30, again 34, and at the
finish were hitting at 35.
Stanford passed the one - mile
marker in four and one-half min
utes, with a quarter-length lead.
By the two-mile mark, the Cards
were a length and a half out front
and continued to pull away.
Stanford's time was 15 minutes
34 seconds —over 14 seconds fast
er than the Bear boat.
Cal's JV craft, also challenging
Stanford in a three-mile match,
took an early command with a
smooth stroke, and at the halfway
mark the Bears led by one length.
UC continued the race one beat
under the Indians, although pull
ing away. Both boats were forced

to veer to the l ight halfway flown
the cours-e to avoid a large
freighter leaving her dock.
The JV winning time was 16
minutes 20 seconds, with Cal
crossing the finish line nine sec
onds ahead of Stanford.
