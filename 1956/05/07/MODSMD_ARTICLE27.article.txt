CAPTAIN JIM SARAS spurts across the finish line uncontested
in the 220-yard dusli run Saturday against California. Saras, a
consistent Stanford winner, was expected to run second to < al's
Leamon King. King's unexpected leg injury gave Saras, running his
last dashes at Stanford, complete command of the 100 and 220-yard
sprints.
