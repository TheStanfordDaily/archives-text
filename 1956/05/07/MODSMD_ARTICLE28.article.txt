# Bears Capture Baseball Win
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball fortunes
continued their tumble Saturday
when California whipped the
Cards, 10-1, while USC won twice
from UCLA in the southland.
The Friday fracas between the
Indians and Bears was rained out
and will be played today at Berke
ley's Edwards Field.
Ray Young, the Cards' work
horse on the mound, was the vic
tim of bad support as the Bears
picked up six runs in as many in
nings. Although Young gave up
10 hits before giving way to Dick
Jones, the Bears only scored one
earned run.
Despite the loss, Stanford still
clings onto second place in the
CIBA, one game ahead of Cal and
three behind the league - leading
USC Trojans.
Errors accounted for the Bears'
lone tally in the third and two
more in the fourth.
Stanford got its lone counter in
the third. Hickey Holzman col
lected the first of four Card hits
off the Bear's ace hurler, Gene
Stang. An error and a walk loaded
the bases, and then Stang walked
Bob Evans to force Holzman
across.
Stang, the winner, struck out
eight and was in no trouble after
the third inning.
California . .012 201 130—10 13 2
Stanford .. .001 000 000— 1 4 4
