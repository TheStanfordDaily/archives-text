### 
For the fourth consecutive year,
the Stanford three-man fencing
team outscored California in a
dual match, 18-9. Seniors John
McDougall and Robert "To ny"
Hodge and a junior, Robert Si

Saturday in Berkeley.
Using three weapons each, the
Indians won all three different
team competitions. Both the Stan

been competing since each entered
college as freshmen.
