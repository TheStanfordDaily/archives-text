# H-Bomb Now Capable Of 'Earthquake' Destruction
## AEC Reveals Further Surface Destruction; First H-Bomb Air Drop Postponed to Wednesday 
### 
ABOARD S.S. MT. McKINLEY AT ENIWETOK, May 6 (UP)â€”A
new, "earthquake" dimension of the H-bomb's destructive power was
revealed today as bad weather forced postponement of this country's
first H-bomb air drop from May 8 to May 9.
Man now can wreck his cities at will with artificial earthquakes

caused by surface or sub-surface
explosions of multi-megation ll
bombs.
Fired in the heart of a target
city, the H-bomb becomes a
"quake bomb" capable of demol
ishing ordinary brick homes in
distant suburbs. It is a new di
mension to the H-bomb's killing
heat, blast, radiation and fall-out.
The new effect was disclosed to
reporters in an air-boat-truck tour
of old and new H-bomb test sites
in the proving ground.
Scientists said that a medium
sized H-bomb exploded higher in
the air can inflict enough blast
damage on brick homes 12 miles
distant to kill 83 per cent of the
occupants.
But the newly-disclosed effects
of the big surface explosion of
March, 1954, reveal that a ground
burst could wreck homes with
earthquake shock at least 20 miles
from the target center, bringing
brick walls down on the occu
pants.
Dr. William E. Ogle, acting dep
uty commander of the test task
force, disclosed the quake-like ef
fects of the 1904 giant on two
massive reinforced concrete bunk
ers at distances of seven and 20
miles from the blast center.
The nearer bunker was displac
ed about two feet, while the more
distant one got a less severe
shove. Neither bunker was struc
turally damaged, but officials
pointed out that both were built
to withstand a shock that would
collapse ordinary brick houses.
