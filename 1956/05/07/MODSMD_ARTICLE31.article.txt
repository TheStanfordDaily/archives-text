## Whites Topple Red Team 
### 
With only two quarterbacks
available for action, Stanford's
gridders were put through anoth
er rough scrimmage Saturday on
the rugby field. The first-string
pigskinners rallied to down the
second team by a 12-7 margin.
No. 1 signal-caller John Brodie
is out for the remainder of the
spring drills with a broken toe.
Jack Douglas is expected to turn
out this week, after having fin
ished a season on the tennis
cou lis.
Sophomore ace Jack Taylor
cracked a rib early in Saturday's
practice and was forced to sit out
the drill. Freshman Jim Ukropina
and sophomore Les Hopkins did
all the signal-calling in the prac
tice.
Ukropina shot a 33-yard pass
to halfback Jerry Angove for the
second team's only score. Doug
Kick kicked the conversion for
the Red eleven.
Red halfback Roy Stephen ear
lier had a 50-yard punt return
through a broken field called back
because of clipping.
Chuck Shea tallied the White
team's first touchdown as he in
tercepted a Ukropina pass and ran
70 yards to paydirt.
The lanky freshman Signal-call
er was moved to the White team
later in the scrimmage and engi
neered the first team to their win
ning score.
Ukropina passed 11 yards to
Paul Camera and 11 more to Gary
VanGalder to place the ball on the
one-yard stripe. A 1 Harrington
plunged over from that point.
Coach Chuck Taylor termed the
drill as ragged, but did aclrrtit that
his gridders were hitting hard.
