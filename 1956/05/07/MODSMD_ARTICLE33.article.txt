ciety are based on a code of ethics
derived from a set of standards
set up by society. This was the
conclusion reached in the fifth
and last hostel discussion group,
held last weekend.
Dr. William Verplanck, associ
ate professor of psychology, said,
"In a child we could build any
ethical system we want, and in
ethics we could do anything we
want, but we must leave to other
people the maximum of choice."
In a second discussion, Dr. Har
ry Rathbun, professor of law,
declared, "Ethical standards
|norms] are the best drives from
man."
He said the three basic drives
in man as a living organism are
self-preservation, reproduction by
keeping the species alive, and the
fulfillment of potentiality.
The need to be loved and to love
was stressed by Dr. Rathbun as
well as the matter of being ac
cepted and having a place in so
ciety.
He also described the difference
between man and animals. "Man
can't trust his instincts; animals
are safe by theirs."
The discussion came to a con
clusion that "we are all in the
same boat; therefore, we depend
on each other."
