# Farm Telescope to Explore Sun
## 
### 
A new type of radio telescope
soon will begin exploring the
sun's turbulent atmosphere from
an observation point on campus.
Professor Ronald N. Bu*icewell,
a new member of Stanford's Ra
dio Propagation Laboratory, will
direct the project.
Construction of the apparatus,
which will possess the finest scan
ning ability yet achieved, is being
financed by grants totaling $143,-
000 from the Air Force Offipe of
Scientific Research.
Called a microwave spectro
heliograph, the device will consist
of 32 parabolic aluminum anten
nas, known as "dishes." These will
be aligned in two rows to form a
huge cross occupying a level, two
acre meadow.
The dish antennas will scan the
sun's surface in the same way a
television camera scans its sub
ject to produce a picture. But the
antennas will pick up solar micro
wave radiations in the 3000-meg
acycle region, ralher than light
waves.
The photograph produced by
this technique will show the mys
terious solar "chromosphere"—a
billowing layer of incandescence
rising to heights of 6000 miles
above the sun's surface.
As yet science knows* little
about the chromosphere, although

it was discovered many years ago
at the time of solar eclipses. With
the development of radio astron
omy in the postwar years, there
has been a renewed effort to
probe its secrets.
"We know the apparatus will
work," Dr. Bracewell said, "be
cause its two basic principles have
already been tested by scientists
at Sydney, Australia. These are
the parabolic antenna idea and the
arrangement of long lines of an
tennas in a cross.
"What will be new here is the
combining of these two principles
into a spectroheliograph.
"The bigger the antenna, the
finer its scanning ability," he ex
plained. "Our individual dishes
will be only 10 feet in diameter,
but each line of them will be 350
feet long. This will give us the
same photograph that a single
'steerable' parabolic antenna 350
feet in diameter would produce
but which would be impractical
to build.
"We will be able to scan solar
areas as small as three-thousand
ths of one square degree. This
definition is much finer than any
one has yet achieved in radio as
tronomy or in radar."
The 32 antennas will look
straight at the sun, scanning its
surface in unison and following

automatically as it crosses the
sky. A photograph of the entire
solar orb will be completed in
about two hours. Clouds will not
affect antenna efficiency.
Preparation of the site will be
gin this summer, Dr. Bracewell
said. He hopes to have the radio
telescope in operation by the end
of the year.

television camera scans its sub
ject to produce a picture. But the
antennas will pick up solar micro
wave radiations in the 3000-meg
acycle region, ralher than light
waves.
The photograph produced by
this technique will show the mys
terious solar "chromosphere"—a
billowing layer of incandescence
rising to heights of 6000 miles
above the sun's surface.
As yet science knows* little
about the chromosphere, although

it was discovered many years ago
at the time of solar eclipses. With
the development of radio astron
omy in the postwar years, there
has been a renewed effort to
probe its secrets.
"We know the apparatus will
work," Dr. Bracewell said, "be
cause its two basic principles have
already been tested by scientists
at Sydney, Australia. These are
the parabolic antenna idea and the
arrangement of long lines of an
tennas in a cross.
"What will be new here is the
combining of these two principles
into a spectroheliograph.
"The bigger the antenna, the
finer its scanning ability," he ex
plained. "Our individual dishes
will be only 10 feet in diameter,
but each line of them will be 350
feet long. This will give us the
same photograph that a single
'steerable' parabolic antenna 350
feet in diameter would produce
but which would be impractical
to build.
"We will be able to scan solar
areas as small as three-thousand
ths of one square degree. This
definition is much finer than any
one has yet achieved in radio as
tronomy or in radar."
The 32 antennas will look
straight at the sun, scanning its
surface in unison and following

automatically as it crosses the
sky. A photograph of the entire
solar orb will be completed in
about two hours. Clouds will not
affect antenna efficiency.
Preparation of the site will be
gin this summer, Dr. Bracewell
said. He hopes to have the radio
telescope in operation by the end
of the year.
A new type of radio telescope
soon will begin exploring the
sun's turbulent atmosphere from
an observation point on campus.
Professor Ronald N. Bu*icewell,
a new member of Stanford's Ra
dio Propagation Laboratory, will
direct the project.
Construction of the apparatus,
which will possess the finest scan
ning ability yet achieved, is being
financed by grants totaling $143,-
000 from the Air Force Offipe of
Scientific Research.
Called a microwave spectro
heliograph, the device will consist
of 32 parabolic aluminum anten
nas, known as "dishes." These will
be aligned in two rows to form a
huge cross occupying a level, two
acre meadow.
The dish antennas will scan the
sun's surface in the same way a
television camera scans its sub
ject to produce a picture. But the

wave radiations in the 3000-meg
acycle region, ralher than light
