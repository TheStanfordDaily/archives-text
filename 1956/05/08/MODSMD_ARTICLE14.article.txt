"The flu epidemic at Stern Hall
is abating," said Public Health
Nurse Margaret Riassetto yester
day."and that would indicate in
itself the thing is a virus and not
a food disease."
The epidemic began last Mon
day. "If it had been anything but
virus, all would have come down
within a few hours," Miss Riasset
to said.
Not all cases that have occurred
have been reported, Miss Riassetto
said.
