# Taylor Says No Job Preference For Grid Team
## $85,009 Annually in Grants-in-Aid Helps Needy Players, Coach Says 
### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
Stanford football players are treated no differently than other stu
dents in relation to university jobs, says Card grid coach Chuck Taylor.
" I he only money football players here get without earning it is in
the form of tuition grants-in-aid," Taylor said. '"They have to work for
any other money they receive here."
All money for grants-in-aid is contributed by the Stanford Duck
Club, the athletically minded ■

alumni organization.
$85,000 A Year
The husky Carri grid chief ap
proximated the amount which the
Buck Club contributes annually to
Stanford athletics at $85,000. Fig
ures disclose that last year the
alumni group's contribution was
$7(5,700 and that tlie previous year
it was $83,000.
All tuition grants are adminis
tered by the scholarship commit
tee office. Just as in the case of
academic scholarships, athletic
grants-in-aid are based on need.
Taylor said that several Stan
ford grid stars of the past and
present have received no mone
tary aid from the school. Among
them were such pigskin greats as
Bob Mathias, Bobby Garrett, John
Steinberg and Sam Morley.
"C" Average Necessary
Stanford athletes must keep a
"C" average in order to retain
their grants. Taylor pointed out
t hat all grants are of the four year
variety as long as the need con
tinues.
"Some prospective football play
ers have come to Stanford on
football grants and have never
turned out," Taylor said. "Never
theless, the students retain the aid
until iheir graduation."
During the present school year,
52 Farm football players are re
ceiving full tuition grants-in-aid.
Another 18 receive grants paying
for their tuition for one or two
quarters. About $45,000 was given
to football players out of the Buck
Club's contributions.
While needy Stanford athletes
can receive free tuition, they must
work for room and board. Hash
ing jobs are the usual method of
getting free board for both ath
letes and non-athletes.
80 Hashing Jobs
The Board of Athletic Control
is given 80 hashing jobs a year
all over campus. Robert Young,
athletic department Manager of
Operations, assigns athletes to the
jobs. Young stressed that his in
fluence is merely in the initial as
signment and that the athletes
must do their work in order to re
tain the jobs.
At present, about 40 pigskinners
are working off-campus while 16
jobs exisl on-campus.
"Beginning next year, 12 new
jobs will be available on the cam
pus at $2 an hour for football play
ers," Taylor said. "Although the
Pacific Coast Conference limit is
$100 a month for athletes' earn
ings on-campus, few players here
will have time to earn more than
$40 or $50."

jobs will be available on the cam
pus at $2 an hour for football play
ers," Taylor said. "Although the
Pacific Coast Conference limit is
$100 a month for athletes' earn
ings on-campus, few players here
will have time to earn more than
$40 or $50."
Stanford football players are treated no differently than other stu
dents in relation to university jobs, says Card grid coach Chuck Taylor.
" I he only money football players here get without earning it is in
the form of tuition grants-in-aid," Taylor said. '"They have to work for
any other money they receive here."
All money for grants-in-aid is contributed by the Stanford Duck
Club, the athletically minded ■

alumni organization.
$85,000 A Year
The husky Carri grid chief ap
proximated the amount which the
Buck Club contributes annually to
Stanford athletics at $85,000. Fig
ures disclose that last year the
alumni group's contribution was
$7(5,700 and that tlie previous year
it was $83,000.
All tuition grants are adminis
tered by the scholarship commit
tee office. Just as in the case of
academic scholarships, athletic
grants-in-aid are based on need.
Taylor said that several Stan
ford grid stars of the past and
present have received no mone
tary aid from the school. Among
them were such pigskin greats as
Bob Mathias, Bobby Garrett, John
Steinberg and Sam Morley.
"C" Average Necessary
Stanford athletes must keep a
"C" average in order to retain
their grants. Taylor pointed out
t hat all grants are of the four year
variety as long as the need con
tinues.
"Some prospective football play
ers have come to Stanford on
football grants and have never
turned out," Taylor said. "Never
theless, the students retain the aid
until iheir graduation."
During the present school year,
52 Farm football players are re
ceiving full tuition grants-in-aid.
Another 18 receive grants paying
for their tuition for one or two
quarters. About $45,000 was given
to football players out of the Buck
Club's contributions.
While needy Stanford athletes
can receive free tuition, they must
work for room and board. Hash
ing jobs are the usual method of
getting free board for both ath
letes and non-athletes.
80 Hashing Jobs
The Board of Athletic Control
is given 80 hashing jobs a year
all over campus. Robert Young,
athletic department Manager of
Operations, assigns athletes to the
jobs. Young stressed that his in
fluence is merely in the initial as
signment and that the athletes
must do their work in order to re
tain the jobs.
At present, about 40 pigskinners
are working off-campus while 16
jobs exisl on-campus.
"Beginning next year, 12 new
jobs will be available on the cam
pus at $2 an hour for football play
ers," Taylor said. "Although the
Pacific Coast Conference limit is
$100 a month for athletes' earn
ings on-campus, few players here
