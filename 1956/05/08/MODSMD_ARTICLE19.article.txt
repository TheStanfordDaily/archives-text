## Presidents Demand PCC Self-Examination Of Athletic Policies 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 7 (UI J )
â€” Pacific Coast Conference col
lege presidents, in the wake of
startling disclosures of "under
the-table" payoffs to athletes at
University of Washington and
other schools, today ordered elf
examination" of athletic policies
at all nine schools.
At the same time, the univer
sity leaders gave the faculty rep
resentatives on the PCC the "go
ahead" signal in leveling fines and
bans on schools caught disobey
ing the rules.
The presidents decided to "let
stand" the decision reached ye
terday that placed University of
Washington on a two-year ban on
all post-season athletic contests,
and cut the Huskies out of an e -
timated $53,000 as their sh u
the Rose Bowl receipts for the
next two seasons.
More to Come
And indicating that more action
is to come, President Robert Gor
don Sproul of University of Cali
fornia said:
"We have been discussing th?
Washington and the UCLA cases
on under-the-table payments to
athletes."
Meanwhile, Dr. Henry Sehmitz
of Washington denied published
reports that Washington was con
sidering withdrawal from the con
ference as the result of the most
drastic action ever taken on an
athletic program in the West.
"Not Up to Me"
"I can flatly deny that I ever
made such a statement," said Dr.
Sehmitz, "and besides it would
not be up to me to make that de
cision.
"I can say, however, T am deep
ly disturbed at the action agai t
our basketball, baseball, tennis
and other teams over something
that had only to do with our foot
ball team.
"But I am of the personal opin
ion we will remain in the confer
ence."
The major factor in the b in on
Washington was the "underlie
table" payments to athletes, aver
aging $00 a month above the
ferenee limit of $75. Commit . n
er Victor O. Schmidt, after v: i<
ing Seattle three different I ane-, in
two months and talking to "finite
a few" of the athletes, revealed
that the payments were made
with the knowledge of membra s
of the athletic staff and othei .
