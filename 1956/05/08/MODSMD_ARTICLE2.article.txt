# Station KEAR To Stop AM Broadcasting
## 
### 
KEAR, the Bay Area AM "good
music" station, is going off the air.
The station, which has provided
classical music to Bay Area listen
ers for nine years, is being leased
to a radio company from Mil
waukee. The call letters will be
changed from KEAR to KACE.
The station will no longer broad
cast exclusively classical music.
"This change is a reluctant one
for KEAR to undertake," said
Steve Cisler, president of Bay Ra
dio, Inc., owners of KEAR.
Nine Years
"The nine years of good music
audience built up on KSMO and
then KEAR is not being discarded,
nor the change made without re
gard for the popular support we
have bar! for the cultural service
we feel we owe the listeners of the
Bay Area."
"We cannot continue to pay the
operation expenses of the station,"
Cisler continued.
He attributed the lack of income
to incompatibility of "good music"
with modern advertising methods,
demands of radio unions for more
money and less work and the ne
cessity to straighten out the com
pany's finances.
FIVI Classics
"The leasing of KEAR will allow
us to continue classical music on
our FM station. The call letters
of our present FM station in San
Francisco, KXKX, will be changed
to KEAR. We plan to increase the
FM station's hours on the air, its
power and its quality," Cisler said.
The change is scheduled to take
place between June 1 and July 1.
