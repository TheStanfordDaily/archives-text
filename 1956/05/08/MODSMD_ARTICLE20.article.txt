### 
Willi tiik second issue ol' Stanford's literary
magazine making its successful appearance last
week, it became-apparent that Sequoia will be
no fleeting publication—here today and gone
tomorrow.
Kditor Linda Lovelace and her start' have
well shaped the destiny of Sequoia and wisely
lempered intellectual appeal with an attractive
ness for the reader of average literary tastes.
Already favorable comment has descended
(»ii Sequoia from varied corners, including the
I niversity of Minnesota Journalism School.
The ground-work has been firmly laid by the
directing forces of volume one.
W helher Sequoia can maintain its early suc
cess depends in a large part on liow the talent
i,i the Uni\ersity responds to the call for ma
terial which is the very life-blood of the maga
zine. t

There is writing talent at Stanford. Some of
it has already shown itself, more of it is wait
ing to be uncovered. Those who are skeptical
need only to look at any of the copies of "Stan
ford Short Stories" <lf the last 10 years.
Current Book-of-the-Month Club selection is
by a former Stanford man too. The facts ex
plode any myth of a "vacuum''' as far as talent
is concerned.
(letting the talent out of its hiding place is
I lie problem which confronts Sequoia. It is
what will chart the future course of the literary
magazine.
The first achievements of Sequoia have been
promising and the efforts of those who are re
sponsible for it should he saluted.
We can only hope that the students who can
maintain Sequoia's early success through their
contributions will do so.
