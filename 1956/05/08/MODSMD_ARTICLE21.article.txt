More traffic suggestions that Stanford might
use in solving its own parking problem come
from the University of North Carolina which
has troubles of its own.
• Buy every one a surplus Sherman tank, let
them loose, and run like mad. (has possibilities,
but the noise would be a drawback.)
• Eliminate parking tickets. ( Whether this
would eliminate the problem is doubtful, but
it would certainly make life more pleasant.)
• Get drunk. (Good way to forget the prob

Cheating has become big business recently on
some campuses.
The University of Illinois announced that it
had expelled 23 students for cheating—one for

three for selling copies at $5 apiece and 20 more
for buying or using copies.
When caught after one student mistakenly
tried to sell an exam to a fraternity house ad
visor, the group's total profit had reached $87. \
