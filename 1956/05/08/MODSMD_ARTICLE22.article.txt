Down with Freedom!
Editor, The Daily:
Wow! Golly gee! Horrors! So the University
of California, L.A., has seen fit to exercise some
control over its students, and UC (at Berkeley)
student leaders have been sufficiently mature to
vp train violent attacks by their college paper on
i he chancellor of their sister institution. Certainly
nothing untoward or sinister; many might see in
these actions a healthy trend.
But not so the crusading Stanford Daily! For
its editorial writers, events at UCLA and UC pro
vide the best cause celebre since Autherine "I
just wanna be a librarian" Lucy. For The Daily,
1 lie matter is the Boston Massacre, the Stamp Act,
Charles I's dissolution of Parliament and the Hit
ler putsch all rolled into one. "Tyrannical . . .
usurping ... of inalienable rights!" bleats The
Daily: "thank God we have a free press and stu

dent government at Stanford."
But what benefit do we get from our "free
press"? As a rule, its editorials on national sub
jects are nothing but unswerving, toadying mouth
ings of the extreme-left line, entirely devoid of
any of the free thought supposedly engendered
by press freedom; its editorials on campus or col
lege questions, at best, say nothing of importance,
and, at worst, are inane rantings of the "tyranny"
sort.
As for our "free student government," election
turnout should indicate what the Stanford student
body considers its significance. Indeed, The Stan
ford Daily, filled with juvenile rantings and a
ridiculous determination to be "tolerant and lib
eral," is a powerful argument against a "free stu
dent press."

Editor's Note: Confidentially, we're subversive.
