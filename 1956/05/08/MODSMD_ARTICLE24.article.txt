# LASSU Will Hear Appeal On Censure
## Political Union GOPs Split into Eisenhower, McCarthy Factions 
### Jae Hunley 
One of the topics at Legislature
meeting tomorrow will he the
question of whether Legislature
will grant an appeal to the group
of students censured by Political
Union two weeks ago.
The "censured" students re
quested an appeal in Legislature
meeting after members had spent
an hour haggling over the ques
tion and decided that the "legal
way" of dealing with the situation
involved approving the Political
Union Executive Board minutes,
and therefore the censure, and
then considering an appeal by the
"censured" group.
According to Political Union
president Ernie Hartz, the censure
was the executive board's way of
registering a strong protest
against actions by members of
Political Union and the Stanford
Area Young Republicans at a
mock convention early in April at
the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
Pool Contested
According to reports from Mike
Hudson, Political Union Republi
can Party Caucus chairman, and
Joe Pool, sole Stanford Political
Union delegate at the convention,
a group of nine Stanford students
appeared at the convention to con
test Pool's representation of Stan
ford.
Hudson said that since Pool was
the only delegate, he did not pro
test the "usurpation" of authori
ty. The other side, headed by Bob
Sprinkel and Steve Nye, claim
that they thought they had reach
ed an amicable agreement with
Pool and were "very much sur
prised" by the censure from Po
litical Union executive board.
Underlying the whole series of
charges and counter - charges is
the "censured" group's protest
that Pool's delegation—in short,
Pool—did not represent the ma
jority opinion of Stanford Repub
lican students.
McCarthy vs. Eisenhower
The basis of the situation is that
Pool and Hudson have, generally,
supported a McCarthy-Republican
point of view, and the others an
Eisenhower - Republican point of
view. The dispute is a ramifica
tion of an interparty feud on a
non-professional level.
Hudson, who admits McCarthy
support, seemed, in a Daily inter
view, to be protesting mostly the
illegal means his opposition took
to gain their ends.
Not supporting a Machiavellian
, point of view, Hudson said that if
the Eisenhower Republicans felt
they were being excluded from
participation on the delegation
(one of Nye's main points of at
tack) they could have resorted to
Political Union Executive Board
or Legislature, itself,
Same Results
The results, he says, would have
been the same. The delegation
would have participated in the
same way and they would have
been authorized by Political
Union.
Authorization by Political
Union is an important element in
the affair because Stanford Uni
versity does not sanction any par
tisan action, and, according to
Dean of Students H Donald Win
bigler, if any group such as Po
litical Union appears to be becom
ing involved with a professional
party activity it will face Univer
sity action.
Winbigler pointed out that an
official position frequently usurps
an individual's position and that
a person publicly connected with
a certain group (Stanford, in this
case) must consider in what way
his own opinions will reflect upon
the group's reputation.
Winbigler said, however, that
the University administration is
planning no official action in this
case and is quite satisfied to Keave
the matter in student government
hands.
He repeated his warning that if
there were any further indications
that the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans or Stanford Area Young
Democrats were assuming the re
sponsibility of representing the
Associated Students of Stanford
University, the administration
"might have to take some action."

versity does not sanction any par
tisan action, and, according to
Dean of Students H Donald Win
bigler, if any group such as Po
litical Union appears to be becom
ing involved with a professional
party activity it will face Univer
sity action.
Winbigler pointed out that an
official position frequently usurps
an individual's position and that
a person publicly connected with
a certain group (Stanford, in this
case) must consider in what way
his own opinions will reflect upon
the group's reputation.
Winbigler said, however, that
the University administration is
planning no official action in this
case and is quite satisfied to Keave
the matter in student government
hands.
He repeated his warning that if
there were any further indications
that the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans or Stanford Area Young
Democrats were assuming the re
sponsibility of representing the
Associated Students of Stanford
University, the administration
"might have to take some action."
One of the topics at Legislature
meeting tomorrow will he the
question of whether Legislature
will grant an appeal to the group
of students censured by Political
Union two weeks ago.
The "censured" students re
quested an appeal in Legislature
meeting after members had spent
an hour haggling over the ques
tion and decided that the "legal
way" of dealing with the situation
involved approving the Political
Union Executive Board minutes,
and therefore the censure, and
then considering an appeal by the
"censured" group.
According to Political Union
president Ernie Hartz, the censure
was the executive board's way of
registering a strong protest
against actions by members of
Political Union and the Stanford
Area Young Republicans at a
mock convention early in April at
the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
Pool Contested
According to reports from Mike
Hudson, Political Union Republi
can Party Caucus chairman, and
Joe Pool, sole Stanford Political
Union delegate at the convention,
a group of nine Stanford students
appeared at the convention to con
test Pool's representation of Stan
ford.
Hudson said that since Pool was
the only delegate, he did not pro
test the "usurpation" of authori
ty. The other side, headed by Bob
Sprinkel and Steve Nye, claim
that they thought they had reach
ed an amicable agreement with
Pool and were "very much sur
prised" by the censure from Po
litical Union executive board.
Underlying the whole series of
charges and counter - charges is
the "censured" group's protest
that Pool's delegation—in short,
Pool—did not represent the ma
jority opinion of Stanford Repub
lican students.
McCarthy vs. Eisenhower
The basis of the situation is that
Pool and Hudson have, generally,
supported a McCarthy-Republican
point of view, and the others an
Eisenhower - Republican point of
view. The dispute is a ramifica
tion of an interparty feud on a
non-professional level.
Hudson, who admits McCarthy
support, seemed, in a Daily inter
view, to be protesting mostly the
illegal means his opposition took
to gain their ends.
Not supporting a Machiavellian
, point of view, Hudson said that if
the Eisenhower Republicans felt
they were being excluded from
participation on the delegation
(one of Nye's main points of at
tack) they could have resorted to
Political Union Executive Board
or Legislature, itself,
Same Results
The results, he says, would have
been the same. The delegation
would have participated in the
same way and they would have
been authorized by Political
Union.
Authorization by Political
Union is an important element in
the affair because Stanford Uni
versity does not sanction any par
tisan action, and, according to
