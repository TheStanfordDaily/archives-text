# Stanford Out of Contention For PCC Baseball Honors
## Fehringmen Tumble Before California Threat; Cal Chucker Throws Cool 4-Hitter at Tribe 
### 
Indian baseball hopes seem to
have succumbed at last. The
Tribesmen went down to defeat,
5-1, before the four-hit chucking
of Cal's Doug Weiss in a make-up
game played at Edwards Field at
Berkeley yesterday. The contest
was originally scheduled for Fri
day but was postponed because of

of Stanford bats as he pitched no
hit ball until the sixth, when cen
ter-fielder Ray Young broke the
ice with a lone single to center.
Young's bingle was the only
safety allowed by the crafty CaT
moundsman until the ninth. Go
ing into that frame with his one
hit shut-out, Weiss was touched
for three base hits that scored
Stanford's only tally.
Rudy Figueroa singled and was
advanced on a safety by Bob Ev
ans, who was hitting for Hal
Messner. Catcher Doug Camilli
then came through with the RBI
punch that scored Figueroa.
The Bears jumped off to an
early lead as they scored two in
the first frame on two walks, a
timely single and a double, steal.
In the third, the home team tal
lied once more on a double pilfer
after a walk, a single and a balk.
Two more r un s in the Cal
fourth put the game on ice as
three base hits boomed off the
Bear bats.
Weiss allowed two walks and

struck out six. There were three
California errors.
The untimely loss put the In
dians into third place and a half
game behind Cal, who now occu
pies the second slot because of the
victory.

Stanford 000 000 001—1 4 1
Cal 201 200 OOx—s 8 3
Batteries: Payne and Camilli;
Weiss and Stewart.
