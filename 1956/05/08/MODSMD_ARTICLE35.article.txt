# Braves Whip Sacramento JC In Home Tilt
## Indian Nine Outslugs Visiting Sac Panthers In Thrilling Slugfest By Jim Price 
### 
Base hits were in style yester
day and the Braves baseballers
got 14 of them to methodically
bat out an 81 triumph over Sacra
mento Junior College.
Pesky Ron Jones, the local sec
ond-baseman, got three of the hits
and rolled around to score each
time. Slugging outfielder Gordy
Medaris contributed a mighty tri
ple to the batting attack, and Bob
Dwight and Wayne West each
collected two singles.
The Braves opened the scoring
in the first inning when Jones, a
master at the drag bunt, edged
the first pitch down the third-base
line for a single. Wayne West's
single moved him to second, and
he tallied on Bob Dwight's line
single.
One-basers by Buzz Iloff and
pitcher Looney knocked across
two runs in the second frame.
Jones scored the fourth run when
Goidy Medaris skied out deep to
center field.
Outfielder Medaris touched off
the big outburst for the Braves
when he stepped to the plate in
the last of the eighth. He bombed
the first pitch up against the bank
in center, just beneath, the 500-
foot sign in the Sunken Diamond.
John Dito's single scored Med
aris. Phil Castellucci, Jones and
West wrapped singles around the
first two outs while two more
runs came in. The Jones Boy trot
ted across easily with the final
run on Merle Lauderdale's line
smash.
