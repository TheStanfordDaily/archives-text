# Iraqi Denies Communist Danger in Middle East
## Iraq Feeling Called Pro-Russian by Dean Of Baghdad College of Law in Visit Here 
### Gerry Smith 
"There is no real Communist danger in the Middle East," Abdul
Rahman Al-Bazzar, dean of the College of Law in Baghdad, Iraq, said
yesterday in an interview. ;
"There is a growing feeling for Russia, but it is more a feeling of
anti-Western powers. It is pro-Russia rather than pro-Communist

because the Middle East feels she
gains sympathy from Russia.
"There are a few Communists
but not many are indoctrinated.
They are rather seeking sym
pathy," he said.
The Russians utilize every West
ern speech that might possibly be
used to give the idea Russia sup
ports the cause of nationalism and
the Western world doesn't.
"Surely there is tension in the
Middle East and reasons for that
tension," Al-Bazzar said. "But we
must all co-operate to discern the
reasons for tension.
"It is no good to sit aside and
criticize others without trying to
help and finding solutions. And I
believe the American people could
do a lot in this direction.
"But before being able to do
anything they must learn the real
situation," he continued. "The
people are generally fair but they
lack real information.
Half Truths
"Unfortunately the general
means of information are not al
ways fair in giving the public the
real information. They give some
thing equivalent to half of the
truth, which might amount to a
complete lie, as one of the emi
nent British judges said."
As an example of half truth, he
cited a recent news story saying
four Israeli children were killed
by Egyptians. But what was with
held was that the day before the
Israelis had bombarded Arab refu
gees and killed 59, including about
a dozen women and about ten
children, Al-Bazzar said.
Turning to the problem of edu
cation in the Middle East, he said
in Iraq and the rest of the Arab
countries a large percentage of the
people are illiterate.
"All governments are doing
their best in building schools and
training teachers to combat illiter
acy," he said. "It takes enormous
effort and some time, but we are
improving every year.
Holds Progress
"The tension caused by the
Israelis holds back progress. We
must defend our own case, but
many Arab countries are not rich
and can't afford to spend so much
for arms.
Even Iraq is only potentially
rich and needs her money to raise
the standard of the individual and
improve the social and economic
situation."
He has a dual purpose in travel
ing through the United States. He
is visiting law schools for the
Iraqi Ministry of Education to see
how they can copy and cooperate
with the United States to improve
their legal studies.
His second purpose is to
acquaint Americans with the
Middle East under the auspices of
the American Friends of the
Middle East.

Rahman Al-Bazzar, dean of the College of Law in Baghdad, Iraq, said
yesterday in an interview. ;
"There is a growing feeling for Russia, but it is more a feeling of
anti-Western powers. It is pro-Russia rather than pro-Communist

because the Middle East feels she
gains sympathy from Russia.
"There are a few Communists
but not many are indoctrinated.
They are rather seeking sym
pathy," he said.
The Russians utilize every West
ern speech that might possibly be
used to give the idea Russia sup
ports the cause of nationalism and
the Western world doesn't.
"Surely there is tension in the
Middle East and reasons for that
tension," Al-Bazzar said. "But we
must all co-operate to discern the
reasons for tension.
"It is no good to sit aside and
criticize others without trying to
help and finding solutions. And I
believe the American people could
do a lot in this direction.
"But before being able to do
anything they must learn the real
situation," he continued. "The
people are generally fair but they
lack real information.
Half Truths
"Unfortunately the general
means of information are not al
ways fair in giving the public the
real information. They give some
thing equivalent to half of the
truth, which might amount to a
complete lie, as one of the emi
nent British judges said."
As an example of half truth, he
cited a recent news story saying
four Israeli children were killed
by Egyptians. But what was with
held was that the day before the
Israelis had bombarded Arab refu
gees and killed 59, including about
a dozen women and about ten
children, Al-Bazzar said.
Turning to the problem of edu
cation in the Middle East, he said
in Iraq and the rest of the Arab
countries a large percentage of the
people are illiterate.
"All governments are doing
their best in building schools and
training teachers to combat illiter
acy," he said. "It takes enormous
effort and some time, but we are
improving every year.
Holds Progress
"The tension caused by the
Israelis holds back progress. We
must defend our own case, but
many Arab countries are not rich
and can't afford to spend so much
for arms.
Even Iraq is only potentially
rich and needs her money to raise
the standard of the individual and
improve the social and economic
situation."
He has a dual purpose in travel
ing through the United States. He
is visiting law schools for the
Iraqi Ministry of Education to see
how they can copy and cooperate
with the United States to improve
their legal studies.
His second purpose is to
acquaint Americans with the
Middle East under the auspices of
the American Friends of the
Middle East.
