About TOO persons are expected
to attend the gathering, which
will last a week. Panofsky's trip

kind," says Panofsky. "It is the
second to be held in Moscow and
the first of the meetings in Rus
sia that United States scientists
are attending.
"The meetings are designed to
provide a place for the free ex
change of non-classified nuclear

political meetings," Panofsky

"I hope to spend a week just
sightseeing in Russia," he said.
He admitted that his sightseeing
will be mostly confined to visiting
a number of nuclear laboratories.
