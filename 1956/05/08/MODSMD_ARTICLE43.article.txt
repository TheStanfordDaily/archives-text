# 'Rainmaker' Is Excellent Production of Good Play
## 
### Richard Mende 
It may take considerable cajol
ing or, more likely, some filching
to get tickets for the limited en
gagement of "The Rainmaker" at
San Mateo's Hillbarn Theatre —
but it's probably worth the try.
This production brings out the
finest features of Richard Nash's
amiable play—sincerity, warmth
and good humor. The characters
in the western ranch community
ring true; they are plain and
straightforward, but not simple;
they are honest people, but not
lacking in subtlety.
Unlike the ingenues that have
flitted through so many recent
comedies, Lizzie, the heroine, is a
plain girl.
Donna Torburn (who is a good
deal more attractive than the
script would have her) sympa
thetically portrays the feelings of
the girl at the anguished age be
fore turning into confirmed spin
sterhood, when native intelli
gence, sensitivity and generosity
are seemingly of no avail and the
bumbling efforts of her well
meaning family make matters
worse.
Nash tells this story between
some fairly standard theatrical
trappings on the one hand —con
cerned with a drought on the
ranch and what appears at first
glance to be irrelevant humor on
the other.

The theatrics never divert one
from the main story, and the hu
mor is skillfully placed to keep
the play from stumbling into sen
timentality.
For example, there is the scene
where the charlatan rainmaker,
who was the first to help Lizzie
think of herself as a woman, is
asking her to leave with him.
The sheriff begs her not to go
and then reveals his secret admir
ation for her. The father pipes in
to Lizzie to remember that, no
matter what happens, she won't
have to go through life as a girl
who's never been asked.
Except for the rainmaker, who
seems to have little romance in
him, not to mention poetry, the
cast could not have been better
chosen, and it is a pleasure to see
the honesty in their parts.
Ingenious staging successfully
overcomes the difficulties of the
tiny theatre and contributes to
one of the finest interpretations
of "The Rainmaker" likely to
come along for a Jong, long time.
