# B-52 jack screw —a typical Boeing design challenge
## 
### 
On Boeing B-52 bombers, the hori
zontal tail surface has more area than the
wins* of a standard twin-engine airliner.
Yet it can be moved in flight, up or down,
to trim the aircraft.
I he device that performs this function
is a jack screw, whiqh, though it weighs
Only 255 pounds, can exert a force of
approximately 225 tons I
Many kinds ol engineering skills went
into designing and developing a jack
screw so precise that it automatically com
pensates for stretch and compression
under load. Civil, electrical, mechanical
and aeronautical engineers, and mathe
maticians and physicists — all find chal
lenging work on Boeing de sign projects
for the B-52 global jet bomber, and for
the 707 jet tanker-transport, the BO-

MABC IM 99 pilotlcss interceptor, and
aircraft of the future.
Because of Boeing's steady expansion,
there is continuing need for additional
engineers. There are more than twice as
many engineers with the company now
as at the peak of World War II. Because
Boeing is an "engineers' company," and
promotes from within, these men find
unusual opportunities for advancement.
Design engineers at Boeing work with
other topnotch engineers in close knit
project teams. They obtain broad experi
ence with outstanding men in many
fields, and have full scope for creative
expression, professional growth and indi
vidual recognition. And they find satis
faction in the high engineering integrity
that is a Boeing byword.

In addition to design engineering,
there are openings on other Boeing teams
in research and production. Engineers
like the lile in the "just»right" size com
munities of Seattle and Wichita. They
may pursue advanced studies with com
pany assistance in tuition and participate
in a most liberal retirement plan. There
may be a place for you at Boeing Seattle
or Boeing-Wichita.

Because of Boeing's steady expansion,
there is continuing need for additional
engineers. There are more than twice as
many engineers with the company now
as at the peak of World War II. Because
Boeing is an "engineers' company," and
promotes from within, these men find
unusual opportunities for advancement.
Design engineers at Boeing work with
other topnotch engineers in close knit
project teams. They obtain broad experi
ence with outstanding men in many
fields, and have full scope for creative
expression, professional growth and indi
vidual recognition. And they find satis
faction in the high engineering integrity
that is a Boeing byword.

In addition to design engineering,
there are openings on other Boeing teams
in research and production. Engineers
like the lile in the "just»right" size com
munities of Seattle and Wichita. They
may pursue advanced studies with com
pany assistance in tuition and participate
in a most liberal retirement plan. There
may be a place for you at Boeing Seattle
or Boeing-Wichita.
