# Battleship Hits Destroyer Off Virginia Coast
## Accidental Collision Damages 'Wisconsin' More Than in 2 Wars 
### 
NORFOLK, Va., May 7 (UP) —
More heavily damaged than in
two wars, the mighty battleship
Wisconsin hobbled into port today
after a collision with a destroyer
that resulted from a false report
of a man lost from a third war
ship.
The escort destroyer Eaton,
rammed and left down by the
bow by the Wisconsin yesterday
in fog-wrapped waters, also was
headed for shore. She was being
towed stern-first, with almost her
entire forward area flooded, in a
ticklish operation.
The Wisconsin was moored at
the Norfolk Naval Base this aft
ernoon and will undoubtedly have
to go into dry dock for major re
pairs.
Only Casualty
Almost incredibly, the only cas
ualty of the destructive collision
was a scratched nose suffered by
a sailor on the Eaton when he
"fell off a ladder or something,"
said the ship's commander.
The Wisconsin carries a 1280-
man complement, and the Eaton
280 officers and men.
"It was a miraculous thing that
there were no casualties," said
Capt. F. S. Keeler, who was on
the aircraft carrier Hornet when
it was sunk in World War 11.
"Had the Wisconsin been going
any faster it would probably have
cut us in two."
Buckled Decks
As it was, the Wisconsin chew
ed a 30-foot gash from the deck
to the v/aterline of the smaller
ship, stove in her own bow and
buckled her decks.
The collision occurred at 3:10
(EST) yesterday during a joint
civilian orientation cruise exer
cise, after a man was reported
overboard by the big aircraft car
rier Coral Sea.
