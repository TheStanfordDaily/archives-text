## University of Kyoto Head Describes New Japanese Education 
### 
Dr. Yokitoki Takikawa, presi
dent of the University of Kyoto,
Japan, and noted Japanese crimi
nal lawyer, was a visitor at Stan
ford yesterday while on a short
tour of the United States.
Takikawa discussed several as
pects of Japanese education in a
brief interview yesterday after
noon. "After the war," he said,
"Japan changed her educational
system through the Civil Infor
mation and Education section of
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's head
quarters.
"In the CIE were many who
were graduates of Stanford's edu
cation department. It is not an
exaggeration to say that Stanford
graduates changed the system. If
the system works out well, it is
to the merit of Stanford gradu
ates," he laughed, "and if it does
not, it must also bo attributed to
them."
JJOOO Students
Kyoto University has a student
body of 9000 and a faculty of 500.
One thing that particularly im
pressed Takikawa was the large
campuses of Stanford and the
University of California.
"1 feel that to take the United
States educational system as is
into Japan would be a mistake
because of the great difference in
size. The whole country is smaller
than California and has a popula
tion of 80 million. Most Ameri
cans don't think of the vast size
of their own country in compari
son to others."
Discussing Communist influ
ence in Japanese universities. Ta
kikawa said the actual number of
Communists is very small.
"In Kyoto there are only 20
registered members of the Com
munist Party, possibly 60 includ
ing secret members. That is very
few for a school of 9000.
Not Large.
"But these members get finan
cial aid from the Communist Par
ty, which has a large fund for
propaganda purposes. Since they
are the richest, they are more ac
tive. The group looks large, but
it is not."
He was once the center of a na
tional controversy in Japan. In
1933 he was dismissed from the
Kyoto law faculty by the Minister
of Education because of a speech
he made expressing a liberal view
toward punishment of criminals.
All other members of the law fac
ulty resigned in protest.

Japan, and noted Japanese crimi
nal lawyer, was a visitor at Stan
ford yesterday while on a short
tour of the United States.
Takikawa discussed several as
pects of Japanese education in a
brief interview yesterday after
noon. "After the war," he said,
"Japan changed her educational
system through the Civil Infor
mation and Education section of
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's head
quarters.
"In the CIE were many who
were graduates of Stanford's edu
cation department. It is not an
exaggeration to say that Stanford
graduates changed the system. If
the system works out well, it is
to the merit of Stanford gradu
ates," he laughed, "and if it does
not, it must also bo attributed to
them."
JJOOO Students
Kyoto University has a student
body of 9000 and a faculty of 500.
One thing that particularly im
pressed Takikawa was the large
campuses of Stanford and the
University of California.
"1 feel that to take the United
States educational system as is
into Japan would be a mistake
because of the great difference in
size. The whole country is smaller
than California and has a popula
tion of 80 million. Most Ameri
cans don't think of the vast size
of their own country in compari
son to others."
Discussing Communist influ
ence in Japanese universities. Ta
kikawa said the actual number of
Communists is very small.
"In Kyoto there are only 20
registered members of the Com
munist Party, possibly 60 includ
ing secret members. That is very
few for a school of 9000.
Not Large.
"But these members get finan
cial aid from the Communist Par
ty, which has a large fund for
propaganda purposes. Since they
are the richest, they are more ac
tive. The group looks large, but
it is not."
He was once the center of a na
tional controversy in Japan. In
1933 he was dismissed from the
Kyoto law faculty by the Minister
of Education because of a speech
he made expressing a liberal view
toward punishment of criminals.
All other members of the law fac
ulty resigned in protest.
