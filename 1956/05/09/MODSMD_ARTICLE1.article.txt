## Presidential Hopeful's Speech to PA Audience Combines High-Brow 'Preaching,' Wry Humor 
### Stew Toy 
Democratic Presidential aspirant Adlai E:. Stevenson, in a speech
combining high-brow "preaching" and wry humor, told a Palo Alio
crowd yesterday thai a "revolution of rising expectations" is ehangi.. :
the ideological character of American society.
Speaking in Palo Alto's Cogswell Plaza on his whirlwind Peninsula

tour, the former Illinois governor
said the political and technologi
cal revolutions of the 20th century
have ended the "quantity" strug
gle for life's necessities of the last
century and have brought about
a now "quality" principle in mod
ern life.
He said that "most of the old
spectres of want have now disap
peared" and that people are now
"moving into a new area of life."
More Leisure
"We produce more and more
with less ar.d less effort, giving
us more leisure time," Stevenson
said. "And we often occupy this
time only with amusements and
faster automobiles.
"But . society is not going to
decay. It is going to blossom."
Stevenson said that not since
the 17th century, when the Turks
were driven from Vienna, "have
we found a true challenge in
Western ideals."
But such ideals as intellectual
freedom, he said, are often for
gotten. "I blame the Administra
tion for its indifference to the in
tellectual growth of the country
and for the current lack of intel
lectual freedom."
He said "hysteria, fear and anx
iety" have enveloped America,
"all in the name of national se
curity."
Freedom Export
"America must assert itself as
the land of the free and the home
of the brave. This is the great
American export: freedom."
Stevenson h'as been touring Cal
ifornia intermittently for several
months, campaigning for the June
5 state primary. *
At one rally someone presented
him with a specially engraved golf
putter. Said Stevenson: "What I
think this country needs is not a
putter hut a driver."
Stevenson was his usual quip
ping self in Palo Alio yesterday.
He said at one point that he did
not know "whether it's history or
my campaign that's destroying
me."
Stevenson said he thought con
servation of natural resources
was "one of the most important
issues of the year." Ho called the
Eisenhower Administration "in
different" to conservation prob
lems.
Education
Education, he said, is an "even
greater resource needing conser
vation." "Competitively we are at
a great disadvantage when the So
viet Union turns out 120,000 engi
neers a year and we produce only
70.000." '
Stevenson was introduced by
Stanford English professor Wal
lace Stegner, now on leave of ab
sence. Stegner said Stevenson has
a great opportunity to improve
the country an opportunity "as
yet untouched, except for -a few
Republican fingerprints."
Stevenson spoke in San Jose.
Monday. Yesterday morning he
visited Mountain View, Sunnyvale
and the new Ford plant at Mil
pitas before coming tr» Palo Alto.
His special campaign bus left
the Peninsula late yesterday mor
ning for Alameda County.
