# Student-Faculty Traffic Planning Board Proposed
## 
### 
Proposal for a Traffic and Park
ing Planning Board was suggest
ed yesterday in a meeting of stu
dent and University officials at
the Planning Office.
Student Traffic Committee
chairman Bob Maddoek made the
proposal of a board which would
consist of five students and five
Stanford officials.
Dean of students, one assistant
to the president, the business man
ager, one senior professor and one*
junior professor would represent
the University. A Legislature rep
resentative, the student financial
manager and three other students
would fill the other five posts.
The Administration approved
the proposed board. Maddoek
plans to present his plan to Legis
lature tonight for - approval.
The remainder of the meeting
was spent rehashing the periph
eral road system, with emphasis
placed on the stretch of road to be
built in front of Moore Hall.
It was decided that pedestrian
overpasses would probably have
to be built to accommodate the
heavy student traffic past the
peripheral road near key points
such as dormitories.
Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbigler said a map and article
on the entire traffic and parking
plan will be ready for public com
ment soon. He said the plans are
being drawn up now.
