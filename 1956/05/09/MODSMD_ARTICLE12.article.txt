## Liberian Official Views Hoover Libe Facilities 
### 
The first Liberian public official to visit Stanford, Charles Benedict
Roberts, saw the facilities of Hoover Library yesterday.
Roberts is the assistant secretary of public works and utilities for
his country. He is on a 10-month Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship
tour of the United States, and is visiting public projects of many cities

and towns. His wife is accompa
nying him.
Liberia, which is about the size
of Ohio and has some 2 x k million
inhabitants, is currently acceler
ating its public works programs.
"The government feels that
good roads and communication
are essential to Liberia's econom
ic development," Roberts said.
Liberia was founded in 1822 by
the American Colonization Socie
ty, which governed the state until
18-17. At that time Liberia formed
its own republican government,
which has been functioning ever
since.
Independent State
Until World War II, Liberia was
I he only independent African
state, the others all being con
trolled by major. European pow
ers.
American influence is still felt
in such forms as the movie indus
try. Incidentally, English is Li
beria's official language.
"American movies can have a
good or bad influence, depending
upon the picture," said Roberts.
He pointed out that Liberia exer
cises mild movie censorship in
cases where a picture would be
apt to cause ill effects like juve
nile delinquency.
"Those pictures which end with
the guilty party getting caught
and punished have a moralizing
effect." He added that many*Li
berian children like to play "cow
boy" as a result of Western mo
vies.
( apital City
Because Liberia's capital and
largest city, Monrovia, has a pop
ulation of only 12,000. Roberts has
preferred to study public projects
in smaller U.S. cities.
Although be spent some time in
New York and Chicago, he has
devoted more to other places. His
lorgest stay was six weeks in
Puerto Rico, which has many of
Hie same situations, including cli
mate, as are found in Liberia.
"Stanford is an added attraction
for us." said Mr. and Mrs. Rob
erts. "Most Liberians who get to
America see only the eastern part
and thus think of the whole coun
try as I>*-Â»i11<r like the East."
