# Series Speaker Discusses Sound In Modern Living
## 
### 
Demonstration and discussion
of "Sound in Modern Living" was
featured at the Tuesday Evening
Series program at Memorial Au
ditorium last night with Dr. Vin
cent Salmon of Stanford Research
Institute lecturing.
Salmon explained the two as
pects of sound, physical and psy
chological, or the wave motion
and the sensation produced by
that motion.
He demonstrated the attributes
of sound loudness, pitch and
quality with a decibel and an
oscillator. His explanation was
largely based on musical theory.
Salmon also spoke on commu
nication and industrial acoustics,
explaining the physicist's role in
architectural acoustics and dem
onstrating various means of con
trol by absorption and obstacles.
After defining noise as any un
wanted sound, Salmon demon
strated means of noise reduction
with an electric razor.
Salmon concluded with a dis
cussion of industrial acoustics and
li i • f i components. Following a
demonstration of ultrasonic sound
with an oscillator, Salmon ex
plainer! its uses for testing and
for control with a flog whistle.
