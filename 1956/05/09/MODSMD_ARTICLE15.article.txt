# Ike Wins Over Kefauver In Indiana Race
## Republican Vote High Despite Income Drop In Farm Communities 
### 
Compiled from UP Dispatches
President Eisenhower won a
"popularity" contest with Senator
Estes Kefauver in Indiana's first
presidential preference pr imary in
28 years yesterday.
Eisenhower swept to comfor
table leads over Kefauver in most
farming areas where the farm
price situation had cast a question
mark on his party's strength.
The veto, and the farm income
situation in general, seemed to
have little effect on the Hoosier
farmers at the polls.
In Florida, Governor Leroy Col
lins, who refused to be stampeded
into a reactionary stand on racial
segregation, won the overwhelm
ing endorsement of his state's
voters to win renomination.
"Maintain Segregation"
Throughout the campaign, Col
lins ran on a platform to bring
"integrity and stability" to Flor
ida government. He pledged to
maintain segregation, but by law
ful means and a calm approach to
Supreme Court mandates.
Governor Frank Lausche of
Ohio ran into heavy opposition in
his bid to capture all of the state's
58 delegates in his favorite son bid
for the Democratic national nomi
nation.
The count for the delegate can
didates was slow, but early returns
indicated Lausche would lose two
and maybe three of his home state
delegation.
Demo Nomination
Republican Attorney General C.
William O'Neill and former fed
eral price stabilized Michael V. Di-
Salle apparently won the Repub
lican and Democratic nominations
for governor.
President Eisenhower was not
entered in the contests. However,
he was sure of the state's 56 dele
gates, who are pledged to Senator
John W. Bricker of Ohio as a fav
orite son candidate.
In New Mexico, Governor John
F. Simms widened his lead as re
tufns continued to pour in in the
three-sided race for the Demo
cratic gubernatorial nomination.
There was no presidential pref
erence in the primary but since
Simm has been an Adlai Stevenson
backer and his leading opponent
supports Harriman, the winner
will be in a strong position as
titular head of the party's 16 con
vention delegates.
