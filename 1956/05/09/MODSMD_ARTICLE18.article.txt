# The 						Price of Commercialism
## 
### 
I\ A It VY SHORT MONTHS part of one of the
areas strongholds of culture will he pushed
out In that old devil commercialism.
k EAR, "the good music station," has been
forced lo drop its AM broadcasting and will hi*
replaced by ""popular personalities aiul music."
li will continue its fine music offerings over I' M
channels, hut will reach a much more limited
audience than it now serves.
ItEA K has long been a friend of most of us,
providing cheapjy and conveniently in a way
which no # other radio station could a respite
of classical music.
Station managers have announced that the
change is necessary because of a lack of financ
ing. 'I'hey say "good music" is incompatible
with "some of the demands of the hysterical
school of so much advertising:
continued upward demands of radio unions for
less work regardless of operating losse's; and
our own interest in squaring all financial obli
gations of our company, and of being able to
continue line music in some form."
In other words, tue> backers of KEAR and its

serious music are making a strategic withdraw
ul. TlÂ»ey will continue to strive desperately foj
the support they need to expand fine music
programming.
Thev are still looking lor needed support
from loeal institutions and individuals with an
interest in serious music.
\\ e are somewhat taken aback that an area
so steeped in culture, sophistication and tradi
tion as San Francisco could not find the means
to help continue KEAR, commercialism or not.
Hut it is not too late. If the listeners in the
area want to continue REAR and its tradition
of fine music, they can help.
As the say: "We are not
losing our faith in the usefulness of fine music.
We just are making a strategic withdrawal to
acquire more ammunition."
We hope others have not lost that faith in
fine music, and we hope that KEAR will indeed
acquire more "ammunition.' 1
It would he a hit lonesome without KEAR,
"the good music station.
