### HELEN DEWAR 
Students of political theory have long quest
ed after lliat delicate balance of human quali
ties 111 a I blend mystically into the ideal leader
the man with an entrancing personality, capa
bilities of dynamic and persuasive leadership
and a sensitive and sympathetic insight into
human nature.
1 more exact definition of this man changes
n ilh ill'.' times. Franklin Roosevelt, captivating
llie American people during the restive thirties
was able tit contrusccnd the constitutional limi
tations of his office with a type of leadership
prohibitive during a period of relative security
and calm.
During this present period of apparent tran
quility and satisfaction, Dwight Eisenhower
has impressed his country with a new interpre
tation of leadership.
The intricacies of policy formation and in
tra-governnrental guidance and persuasion have
been pushed to the back of people's minds by
the disarming and thoroughly appealing nature
of the man's personality.
The Eisenhower smile, the high-sounding
platitudes, the picture of the great war-time
hero leading the nation in peace as he did in war
have wiped from the country's mind the seem
ingly mechanical deficiencies of his administra
tion.
A "return to normalcy" has characterized the
past three years, and although it has frustrated
many who are not content with things as they
stand, it has apparently conformed to the pre
vailing political mood.
Forced through the stringencies of a depres
sion and all-out war, the nation seems to want
a rest. It seems unwilling to recognize the need
for firmer leadership than has been offered;
rather it sees in Eisenhower "the perfect man"
who by his charming personality and non-an
tagonizing moderation, seems capable of seal
ing any breach whether on the domestic or in
ternational scene.
In this the President has often succeeded
I he breach in the Republican Party was patched
over, England has joined the United States in
a new pact of friendship and, although mainly
through Russian initiative, the Soviets are now
-miling rather than glowering.
Nevertheless, despite the mending, the weak
nesses are still there. Ihe Old Cuard influence
is strongly felt on Administration policy, the
community of free nations, especially the At
lantic alliance, is dissolving into the luxury of
intramural squabbles and it seems fairly evi
dent the Soviet smiles arc nothiuglmore than
a luring ( arce to unwary, trusting souls.
At the risk of sounding like "prophets of
doom." many fear that the historical parallel
u ill repeat itself and then cry for more dynamic
leadership lest the nation be caught nap/ting
as it was during the twenties.
\ repeat performance can be averted if the
country and its leaders will awake to the chal
lenge.
