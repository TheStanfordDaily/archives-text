# What Makes Eisenhower Popular: Nation's Mood or Achievements?
## 
### JIM PALMER 
The popularity of President Eisenhower,
which led lo his landslide election in 1952, has
maintained itself anions the American public
throuhout his first term and looms as a major
threat to Democratic hopes for success in 1950.
The pollsters confirm the consistent approval
by a substantial ma jority of the way the isres
ident has handled his office. As a Republican
"strong man," Ike is riding the crest of a re
markable popularity wave.
The reasons for this can Inâ€¢ summed up in a
few words: respect for a man of outstanding
hitman achievements, admiration for character
</nalities as demonstrated in his military and
political careers and confidence in a man de
voted to his country above everything else.
Respect, admiration and confidence. These
form the foundation for Eisenhower's popular
ity, and it is these bases that will most assuredly
sweep him into office for a second term Nov. 6.
lint there is great and perhaps disastrous
danger in approaching the political campaign
with a smug attitude, and Republican leaders
know it.
One man can not assure a party victory. If
the GOP were to put all their eggs in the Eisen
hower basket, the results could be fatal on Con
gressional, Senatorial and gubernatorial levels.
This is not to say that there is nothing to be
gained by coat-tail riders. But it does mean that
too much "me too*' smugness may find Repub
lican candidates everywhere awakening to a
Democratic victory on all but the highest levels.
And its influence could carry over even into the
White Mouse decision.
With this warning in mind, Republicans must
shape their 1056 campaign not alone on the
basis of a great popular leader.
Every effort must be made to meet the des
perate Donkey attacks on all levels. For a chain
is only as strong as its weakest link.
Eisenhower is the chain's strongest link, for
whatever straw-grasping comments the opposi
tion can pull out of the hat, his genuine ac
complishments greatly outweigh his human
failures.
An honest appraisal of the first Eisenhower
Administration will list shortcomings, to be
sure, but a good deal of the failures have arisen
not from the executive, but from the legislative
branch of the federal government.
I he struggle for control of that branch will
be the most fierce fight (if 1956. A rubber-stamp
(.ongress is not the aim of Republicans, for even
with COP control from 1952-54 there was no
movement in that direction, instead a more posi
tive atmosphere as concerns the President's
programs is the goal to In* realized.
Becoming aware of the real battles shaping
up in the Senate and tin; Congress is a necessarv
condition if Republicans are to capitalize on
the fortune of Eisenhower's second term candi
dacy and to convert it into party triumph.
Only supreme efforts by all party faithful can
assure adequate sup/tort for the I*resident's next
four years.
