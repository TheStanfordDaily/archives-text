RICHMOND, Calif., May 8
(UP) Adlai Stevenson renewed
his attack tonight on the State De-
partment, which he charged was
"bluffing our enemies, boasting to
our friends and misleading our
people at home."
"We must stop this dangerous
drift in foreign affairs that leaves
us without a policy," the 1952
Democratic standard-bearer told
an audience in Richmond Audi-
torium.
The former Illinois gov • re
called upon the people to return
the Democratic party to power.
The Democratic party, he said, is
the "only party possessing the
creative imagination and boldness
to . . . meet the needs of our peo
ple and at the same time provide
the jobs we need."
Stevenson's speech contained
none of the barbed attacks on key
Republican officials which were
prominent in his remarks ye -ti r
day in a campaign swing along
the Central California coast. In
Monterey he labeled Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles as "un
guided missile that traveled so
fast neither Knowland nor Nixon
could contradict him twice in the
same country."
