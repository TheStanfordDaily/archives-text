# LASSU to Give Opinion on AWS Housing Petitions
## 
### 
Petitions to postpone parts of
the new Associated Women Stu
dents housing policy until next
year will be discussed by ASSU
Legislature tonight at its weekly
meeting in the Committee Room,
7:30. *
The AWS Cabinet has referred
these requests, presented by soph
omore women on the Row, to Leg
islature to see what action should
be taken on them.
Two petitions were received
last week and a third has been
drawn up since the new drawing
plan was passed. These ask that
sophomore women be allowed to
remain in their present residences
next year if they wish to do so.
Under the approved housing
system, all sophomores would be
required to draw out of their pres
ent dorms, and the plan would be
come effective on May 10 (tomor
row).
The AWS constitution provides
that petitions may be voted on by
the cabinet or presented to wom
en students for a vote within 15
days.
It was felt by AWS that these
petitions would become a dead
issue when the plan, which speci
fied May 10 as a starting date,
was approved, Ell ie Kronfield,
AWS president, said last week.
However, the third petition has
reopened the issue and is being
sent to Legislature for its opinion
and interpretation of the AWS
constitution.
Other items to be brought up at
tonight's meeting include the in
troduction of a new Women's Rec
reation Association constitution.
An appeal of the Political Union
censure will also be made.
