# Spring Show Production Termed 'Bright Musical'
## 'Wonderful Town' Is Sprightly Presentation About Bohemian Life in Greenwich Village 
### Richard Mende 
Leonard Bernstein's bright musical comedy "Wonderful Town"
about Bohemian life in Greenwich Village during the depression is
probably not more than a notch below such standards for the genre
as "South Pacific," "Guys and Dolls" and "Kiss Me Kate."
The story is centered around two sisters from Ohio and the diffi-

culties they have accommodating
themselves to the odd breed of life
they find in the Village; in the
book by Joseph Fields and Jerome
Chodorov the odd assortment of
characters are treated with good
humor and warmth. The story is
unfolded easily; it is told sprightly
but without the "pace" that
plagues so many productions.
The Rams' Head production of
this show has a great deal to com
mend it. While there are no show
stealing stars the cast is uniformly
good. The chol egraphy and danc
ing are of professional calibre and
the sets are bright, tasteful and
imaginative.
Principal Drawback
The principal drawback to the
performance is surprising lack of
p reparation; opening night
seemed like a technical rehearsal
although Warner Leßoy's direc
tion was generally sound.
The individual credits are almost
too numerous to mention but Fred
Cone, as (he editor who falls in
love with Fileen's sister, has a fine
resonant voice and is able to put a
song across in a very pleasing
fashion.
Hart Sprager, with his usual ex
uberance, is a very amusing Bo
hemian; there are very few people
that would be willing lo chance
most of a show dressed in shorts.
The two sisters from Ohio, Bar
bara Tantau and Marilyn Poppino
'were quietly charming and fit in
with the easy pace of the show.
Bohemian ('haracters
Many others in Ihe cast were
able to create some amusing, if
somewhat bizarre Bohemian char
acters. Especially memorable were
Charles Lyons as Appolous, a
painter landlord who had his "blue
green period" and Paul Harwood
as Valenti, proprietor of a jazz
palace called trie Vortex.
"Wonderful Town" is a warm
hearted, amusing comedy. With
its abundance of talent Ram's head
might have done it complete jus
tice had they given it more com
plete preparation.

probably not more than a notch below such standards for the genre
as "South Pacific," "Guys and Dolls" and "Kiss Me Kate."
The story is centered around two sisters from Ohio and the diffi-

culties they have accommodating
themselves to the odd breed of life
they find in the Village; in the
book by Joseph Fields and Jerome
Chodorov the odd assortment of
characters are treated with good
humor and warmth. The story is
unfolded easily; it is told sprightly
but without the "pace" that
plagues so many productions.
The Rams' Head production of
this show has a great deal to com
mend it. While there are no show
stealing stars the cast is uniformly
good. The chol egraphy and danc
ing are of professional calibre and
the sets are bright, tasteful and
imaginative.
Principal Drawback
The principal drawback to the
performance is surprising lack of
p reparation; opening night
seemed like a technical rehearsal
although Warner Leßoy's direc
tion was generally sound.
The individual credits are almost
too numerous to mention but Fred
Cone, as (he editor who falls in
love with Fileen's sister, has a fine
resonant voice and is able to put a
song across in a very pleasing
fashion.
Hart Sprager, with his usual ex
uberance, is a very amusing Bo
hemian; there are very few people
that would be willing lo chance
most of a show dressed in shorts.
The two sisters from Ohio, Bar
bara Tantau and Marilyn Poppino
'were quietly charming and fit in
with the easy pace of the show.
Bohemian ('haracters
Many others in Ihe cast were
able to create some amusing, if
somewhat bizarre Bohemian char
acters. Especially memorable were
Charles Lyons as Appolous, a
painter landlord who had his "blue
green period" and Paul Harwood
as Valenti, proprietor of a jazz
palace called trie Vortex.
"Wonderful Town" is a warm
hearted, amusing comedy. With
its abundance of talent Ram's head
might have done it complete jus
tice had they given it more com
plete preparation.
