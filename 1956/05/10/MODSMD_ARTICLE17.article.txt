# Detonation of U.S.'s First H-Bomb by Air Scheduled for Today
## Bad Weather Postpones Test 3 Times Newsmen to Witness First Hydrogen Blast At Bikini Test Site 
### 
ABOARD U.S.S. MT. McKIN
LEY EN ROUTE TO BIKINI,
Thursday, May 10 (UP)- Atomic
task force officials, keeping their
fingers crossed against the hex of
bad weather, began "D-minus 1"
preparations today for the deto
nation of America's first air-drop
ped hydrogen bomb.
The H-bomb blast, one of the
big shots of the 1956 nuclear test
series and the first hydrogen ex
plosion ever witnessed by news
reporters, is scheduled for 0 a.m.
tomorrow (about 11 a.m. today
PDT),
It has been postponed three
times during the past week due
to unfavorable wind conditions
which threatened to waft the dead
ly radioactive fall-out over inhab
ited regions.
Weather Report
The latest weather report from
"Operation Redwing" headquar
ters said conditions were "contin
uing to improve" and the present
situation justified going on D
minus-1 status.
In order to carry put the sched
uled blast, winds at all altitudes
must be such as to carry all radio
active fall-out safely to sea.
Cloud conditions must be light,
enough to permit visual drop by
the eight-jet B-52 bomber assigned
to this historic job.
The big drop has been given
the code name "Cherokee."
The United States' 1956 nuclear
test series was touched off at this
mid - Pacific proving ground last
Saturday with the surface explo
sion of an atomic warhead.
500-Foot Crater
Though "small" in comparison
to other atomic and thermonu
clear weapons, it gouged .a 500-
foot crater in tiny Runit island of
Eniwetok atoll.
Tomorrow's Cherokee blast at
Bikini is not expected to produce
a crater—or even very much fall
out—because it will be exDloded
about two miles above the Pacific.
The best unofficial guess is that
the B-52, commanded by Maj. Da
vid Critchlow, will fly over Bi
kini's tiny Namu island at an alti
tude of about 50,000 feet. The
bomb is expected to burst about
10,000 feet above the illuminated
bulls-eye on Namu.
Unofficially, this device is esti
mated to equal in power some
five to 10 million tons of TNT.
Official Decision
Today's official decision to
"turn the shot on" sent the entire
task force of 13,500 men and more
than 100 planes and 50 ships into
action.
The Mt. McKinley is carrying
15 newsmen and 17 Civil Defense
officials, who are the first unoffi
cial observers ever to watch the
awesome fury of an exploding hy
drogen bomb.
The McKinley must steam
miles from its anchorage at Eni
wetok to a position at sea about
32 miles from the bomb burst.
The drop plane is getting its
final check.

the code name "Cherokee."
The United States' 1956 nuclear
test series was touched off at this
mid - Pacific proving ground last
Saturday with the surface explo
sion of an atomic warhead.
500-Foot Crater
Though "small" in comparison
to other atomic and thermonu
clear weapons, it gouged .a 500-
foot crater in tiny Runit island of
Eniwetok atoll.
Tomorrow's Cherokee blast at
Bikini is not expected to produce
a crater—or even very much fall
out—because it will be exDloded
about two miles above the Pacific.
The best unofficial guess is that
the B-52, commanded by Maj. Da
vid Critchlow, will fly over Bi
kini's tiny Namu island at an alti
tude of about 50,000 feet. The
bomb is expected to burst about
10,000 feet above the illuminated
bulls-eye on Namu.
Unofficially, this device is esti
mated to equal in power some
five to 10 million tons of TNT.
Official Decision
Today's official decision to
"turn the shot on" sent the entire
task force of 13,500 men and more
than 100 planes and 50 ships into
action.
The Mt. McKinley is carrying
15 newsmen and 17 Civil Defense
officials, who are the first unoffi
cial observers ever to watch the
awesome fury of an exploding hy
drogen bomb.
The McKinley must steam
miles from its anchorage at Eni
wetok to a position at sea about
32 miles from the bomb burst.
The drop plane is getting its
final check.

LEY EN ROUTE TO BIKINI,
Thursday, May 10 (UP)- Atomic
task force officials, keeping their
fingers crossed against the hex of
bad weather, began "D-minus 1"
preparations today for the deto
nation of America's first air-drop
ped hydrogen bomb.
The H-bomb blast, one of the
big shots of the 1956 nuclear test
series and the first hydrogen ex
plosion ever witnessed by news
reporters, is scheduled for 0 a.m.
tomorrow (about 11 a.m. today
PDT),
It has been postponed three
times during the past week due
to unfavorable wind conditions
which threatened to waft the dead
ly radioactive fall-out over inhab
ited regions.
Weather Report
The latest weather report from
"Operation Redwing" headquar
ters said conditions were "contin
uing to improve" and the present
situation justified going on D
minus-1 status.
In order to carry put the sched
uled blast, winds at all altitudes
must be such as to carry all radio
active fall-out safely to sea.
Cloud conditions must be light,
enough to permit visual drop by
the eight-jet B-52 bomber assigned
to this historic job.

the code name "Cherokee."
