## Paly Movies Wax Fat at Expense Of Farm Students — What to Do? 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Stanford students who attended "The Man
in I lie Crey Flannel Suit""' last week in Palo Alto
practically had lo sell their grey flannel suits
to see this film.
Making use of its usual practice of charging
11at the traffic will bear, tin* Stanford Theater
charged SI .25 a head to see a |»idurc which
wasn't exactly making its West Coast premiere.
The Varsity Theater also charges $1.25 for
any film ranging from mediocre to good. The
I'ark and the Guild in Menlo Park, a hit farther
away from campus, charge $1 and the Cardinal
Theater charges just 80 cents.
A first run theater up in San Francisco sel
dom charges more than SI .25 for a picture.
I iowever, Stanford students have little choice.
If it is a weekday night and they want to see a
show and get lo bed early, there is hardly an
other place to go hut Palo Alio. The choice is
pay SI .25 or no flick, so the student pays $1 .25
and sees a passable movie.
But what can he done about this situation?
As long as the student is willing lo pay, the
theaters will continue to charge abnormally
high rates.
Complaints to the management would do no
good. The management would probably reply,
"We have full houses every night, why change?"
Roycott may he an answer. Rut this solution
probably wouldn't he carried out hv enough
students to make it effective.
W hat some Stanford students have to say
about the situation:
Ritsy Wilson, '59, Branner: "Palo Alto is
a college town and other merchants cater to
college trade. I think the theaters are taking
unfair advantage of students. Maybe something
could he done through the Chamber of Com
merce to get them lo lower prices."
Judy Williams, '59, Branner: "I think the
prices are unreasonably high. There should he
student rates. The prices should he lowered at
least a little hit because the students go there
so much and many can't afford to go at the pres
ent prices."
Claire Smith, "59, Roble: "Prices are defi
nitely too high. At Cal they have student rate
cards, which are bought for SI and entitle the
be arer to have reduced prices equal to junior
admission."
Sydney Howell, '57,'nff-campus: "The prices
are too high for the accommodations available.
Other towns have student rates, whv can't Palo

Alto? Also we don't get much in the way of
quality of pictures, the movies just go from one
Peninsula theater to another.
" I he theater managers should be approached
by student committees or petition."
Dick Smith, '57, off-campus: "I II stick to the
Sunday night Hicks."
Roiiert Pockrass, %raduate, off-rum pus:
" The prices are outrageous. I have seen half
empty theaters with reasonably good pictures
playing. They appear to be cutting their own
throats. They charge more than most theaters
in San Francisco."
Jack Lylf, graduate, off-ram pus: "The prices
are so high, I do not patronize the local theaters.
After being stuck with those high prices for a
couple of them, I now go out of town to see
movies."
Dick Williams, '58, Stem: "They're cheaper
than my home town. I think somebody from
ASSU should talk to them. 1 don't think il
would do.any good, though."
Dick Grundy, '58, Stem: "I think they're a
little high. 1 think if they'd cut the prices they'd
have more kids going. I'll go home and see
movies on weekends rather than pay the prices
here."
Dick Cotega, '58, Stern: "I see no reason at
all for charging prices that high. Everybody
around here has prices for Stanford students.
Some charge less—others charge more. Just
don't go to them, I guess."
Richard Luke, '57, Stern: "T think they're
much too high for the quality of movies they
show. \\ hat can we do about them? They're too
slow about changing the shows. One can see
them all over the Peninsula before they get
down here."
Al Farmer, '58, Stem: "About all we could
do is boycott the theaters. If we could get one
manager to lower his prices, we could show that
by our support of his theater that the others
would do better if they lowered theirs.
"We could also have an extra flick on cam
pus. That would hurt Paly theaters. A Satur
day night flick would be good. Lots of people
have tests Monday."
Bruno Morelli, '57, Stern: "Outrageous.
They have a monopoly on entertainment for
Stanford students and they capitalize on it.
They charge downtown prices for second run
movies. Unless they boycott the movies I don't
see what they can do."
