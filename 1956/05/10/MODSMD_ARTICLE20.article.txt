KEAR Support
Editor, The Daily:
Your editorial "The Price of Commercialism,"
which was devoted to the plight of KEAR, dis
played a naivete unexpected from a student in
a mass-media.
Nearly all radio stations in the United States
are businesses — businesses designed to make
money. The investors in KEAR have not been
operating the station with altruistic intentions of
titling musical tastes. They planned the program
ming of "fine" music because they assumed that
ihe area served by the station would have enough
listeners to support the station. •
I believe this assumption is still valid, but an
other factor must be considered: listeners are gen
erally apathetic in responding to radio program
ming with letters of encouragement or comments
to advertisers and sponsors. Some pressure groups
have exertPd much effort in exposing "poor"
radio, but individual and group efforts in support
of what is "good" are rare.
How many KEAR listeners have written fre
fluent ly to the station or to the sponsors and
advertisers? Probably most of KEAR's listeners
have never written. Your editorial says "KEAR

has been a friend of most of us . . We usually
talk to our friends. We can talk to a radio station
by little, investment in time and money.
Your paragraph concerned with management's
reasons for KEAR's change of programming is
misleading. You have attached yourself so com
pletely to management's problems that you con
vey the implication that the radio broadcasting
personnel of KEAR should be less demanding
because the station is having financial difficulties.
Do you mean to suggest that a skilled radio
operator bo paid less on a "fine music station"
than he would be if he were spinning Eddie Fisher
or Pattie Page on a "jukebox station"? I'm con
fident you would answer "No." Let's not ask Ihe
operators to be satisfied with less pay or poorer
working conditions because we like the "fine
music."
If you want to give KEAR "ammunition," stress
the importance of audience support. If each KEAR
listener invested 50 cents in 25 postal cards which
were then used periodically in writing to the sta
tion and the advertisers, the station would be
given its most valuable "ammunition."

a mass-media.
Nearly all radio stations in the United States
are businesses — businesses designed to make
money. The investors in KEAR have not been
operating the station with altruistic intentions of
titling musical tastes. They planned the program
ming of "fine" music because they assumed that
ihe area served by the station would have enough
listeners to support the station. •
I believe this assumption is still valid, but an
other factor must be considered: listeners are gen
erally apathetic in responding to radio program
ming with letters of encouragement or comments
to advertisers and sponsors. Some pressure groups
have exertPd much effort in exposing "poor"
radio, but individual and group efforts in support
of what is "good" are rare.
How many KEAR listeners have written fre
fluent ly to the station or to the sponsors and
advertisers? Probably most of KEAR's listeners
have never written. Your editorial says "KEAR

has been a friend of most of us . . We usually
talk to our friends. We can talk to a radio station
by little, investment in time and money.
Your paragraph concerned with management's
reasons for KEAR's change of programming is
misleading. You have attached yourself so com
pletely to management's problems that you con
vey the implication that the radio broadcasting
personnel of KEAR should be less demanding
because the station is having financial difficulties.
Do you mean to suggest that a skilled radio
operator bo paid less on a "fine music station"
than he would be if he were spinning Eddie Fisher
or Pattie Page on a "jukebox station"? I'm con
fident you would answer "No." Let's not ask Ihe
operators to be satisfied with less pay or poorer
working conditions because we like the "fine
music."
If you want to give KEAR "ammunition," stress
the importance of audience support. If each KEAR
listener invested 50 cents in 25 postal cards which
were then used periodically in writing to the sta
tion and the advertisers, the station would be
given its most valuable "ammunition."
