# Senate Farm Committee Approves Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 3 (UP)
The Senate Agriculture Commit
tee tonight approved a catch-all
farm bill authorizing President
Eisenhower's $1.2 billion soil bank
but incorporating the House ban
on his controversial prepayment
plan.
The hill, approved 18 to 1, also
would increase price supports on
feed grains. To get the higher
price props, farmers would have
to put 15 per cent of their average
feed grain acreage for the past
three years into the soil bank.
Eisenhower and Agriculture
Secretary Ezra T. Benson strong
ly opposed raising supports on
the feed grains barley, grain sor
ghums, oats and rye.
The committee-approved bill is
an amended version of the new
farm bill passed recently by the
House as a substitute for Demo
cratic-sponsored legislation vetoed
by Eisenhower last month.
The Senate committee amended
â™¦he House bill to provide for a
two-price system for rice and a
two-year freeze of present parity
prices for corn, peanuts and
wheat. This would tend to keep
support prices on their crops at
higher levels.
The committee went along with
the President as to what crops
would be eligible for the soil bank.
But it followed the House lead and
rejected his request for authority
to pay farmers up to $500 million
this year for promising to take
land out of surplus production
next year.
