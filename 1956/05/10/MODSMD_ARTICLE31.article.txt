Like Wine
Like good wine, the Card golf
activities improved with the years
in the 1930'5. Between 1938 and
the temporary conclusion of NC
AA competition in 1942, Stanford
walked off with four national
crowns.
Top golf names in those days
included Sandy Tatum, national
individual champ in 19-12; Warren
Berl and Bud Brownell, both fi
nalists in individual NCAA play;
and "Bud" Finger, one of two in
dividual Stanford medalists in the
1941 PCC finals.
Â» Coach Finger teamed with Gor
don Ilough, Bud Brownell and Dee
Replogle in 1941 to capture four
out of four team match plays
against PCC teams, win the PCC
Southern Division and then go on
to take the national.
