# Landy Gives Graves Lesson in Stadium
## 
### 
How does it feel to receive a lesson from John
Landy on how to run the mile?
Maury Graves, holder of the Stanford two-mile
mark, found out yesterday afternoon. Graves, for
the second time, spent an hour jogging around
the Stadium track with the mile world record
holder.
After the workout Landy was not available
for comment. But Graves said, "About all I did
was ask him for advice."
Landy, Graves said, suggested a training pro
gram of alternate sprints and long distances.
On whether or not he'll adopt Landy's pr ogram,
the sophomore sensation modestly asserted, "I'll
try anything."
Both Graves and Landy plan to compete Satur
day in the Fresno Relays.

Landy is scheduled to run in the Special Mile,
while Graves will try the 5000 meters.
"I'm running," pointed out Graves, "but not
against him, although I'd like to run against
him."
Landy's chief competition in the Fresno Relays
will come from Villanova's Ron Delany. Like
Oregon's Jim Bailey, who edged the Australian
star last Saturday in a blazing 3:58.6, Delany is
a runner who likes to lag behind for the first
three laps and then turn on a tremendous stretch
"kick."
Landy's best time to date is 3:58 flat, while
Delany has never broken the four-minute bar
rier. But Bailey, until last Saturday, had never
clicked off a mile faster than 4:05.6. The time of
3:58 is the world's record.
