# Legislature Solves 'Case Of Disputed Delegation'
## Republican Group 'Condemned,' Not Censured, For Participating in Mock Political Convention 
### Gerry Smith 
Finally solving the baffling "case of the disputed delegation," ASSU
Legislature waded through a bog of semantic garble to "condemn"
the actions of the errant group at the USC mock political convention
last April.
To "condemn," not "censure" was the verdict because, according to

student legislator Sue Coshow,
"censure" implies condemnation
of the persons themselves and
"condemn" implies condemnation
of the actions taken by the per
sons.
But a decision didn't come so
quickly.
First the report, drawn up by a
special Legislature sub-committee,
had to be pared down, for there
was an unacceptable paragraph,
one commending the group for
their behavior at the convention.
'Go to Hell'
"But to condemn is the same as
saying 'go to hell,' " Bobbie Clark
quipped. "It's silly to pat them on
the back after condemning their
action in going down."
So after much discussion, the of
fending clause was removed.
Then came more discussion.
Steve Nye, member of the con
demned delegation, asked if Legis
lature felt his appeal was justified.
"We didn't feel it was a purely
black and white picture, but when
we put the two stories together,
we came up with a mixture of
muddles," said Helen Zarifes, act
ing in place of George Ralph, who
is in Vancouver, Wash., for a stu
dent body presidents' convention.
Condemnation
Jack Pike, another member of
the delegation, was concerned
whether the condemnation would
be entered on his record.
Helen Zarifes replied it would
remain only in Legislature books
and in the Political Union execu
tive board minutes.
Following a roll-call vote on the
vole to take a vote asked for by
Andy Kjos, Ihe motion condemn
ing the group for attending the
convention as Stanford delegates
not a part of the Political Union
delegation was passed by an 8-to-4
vote.
After the meeting. Nye said:
"We anticipate a student reaction.
If any student were lo hear the
recordings of the Legislature pro
cedure, they would be shocked at
their representation."
Political Union member Mike
Hudson's comment was: "I ap
prove of t lie measureâ€”they got
what they deserved."
