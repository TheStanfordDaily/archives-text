# Ike Wins Key Farm State Primary Vote
## Demonstrates Strong Popularity Despite Veto of Farm Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 9 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower demonstrat
ed his popularity in a key mid
west farm .state today as returns
from five state primary elections
were scanned for national signifi
cance.
The primaires also saw the re
sounding defeat of strongly pro
segregationist candidates for gov
ernor and U.S. senator in Florida.
A complete but unofficial count
in Indiana showed the President,
on the Republican ticket, out poll
ed Sen. Estes Kefauver on the
Democratic ballot by a margin
similar to the one Eisenhower
polled against Adlai E. Stevenson
in the 1952 general election.
Unofficial Count
Final unofficial tabulations
from 4384 precincts gave the
President 354,546 votes to 13,312
for Lar Daly, an America First
candidate. Kefauver polled 217,499
votes in 4080 precincts.
Highlights of the other prima
ries:
Florida: Gov. Leroy Collins won
an unprecedented second term by
swamping five opponents, includ
ing an ardent segregationist and
a former governor. Collins, a
"moderate" on the segregation
issue, is the first man in Florida's
history to win without a run-off.
He captured 54 per cent of the
total vote to become the first Flor
ida governor to succeed himself.
In Florida's other major race,
Sen. George A. Smathers (Dem.)
handed a crushing defeat to his
segregationist poponent, Earle
Griffis.
Ohio: Democratic Gov. Frank J.
Lausche suffered some damage to
his prestige by losing two and pos
sibly three delegates from his "fa
vorite son" delegation to the Dem
ocratic National Convention. The
governor, who says he has no
chance for the Presidential nomi
nation, probably will release his
delegates to Stevenson, who did
not enter the Ohio primary race.
Sen. John W. thicker (Rep.) won
56 Republican "favorite son" del
egates, which he will release to
Eisenhower.
Eansche Wins
Lausche won his party's nomi
nation for the U.S. Senate without
opposition, polling 194,151 votes,
lie will face Sen. George Bender
(Rep.), who was unopposed for
tenomination and led the GOP
ticket with 242,023 votes.
In the Ohio governorship race,
GOP Attorney General C. William
O'Neill and former federal price
chief Michael V. DiSalle, Demo
crat, easily won their respective
primary contests.
West Virginia: Gov. William C.
Marland and his attorryy general.
John G. Fox, fought a see-saw bat
tle for the Democratic nomination
to fill the unexpired term of the
late U.S. Sen. Ilarley M. Kilgore.
Former U.S. Sen. Chapman Rev
ereomb ran away with the GOP
senatorial nomination over four
opponents.
New Mexico: Gov. .1 oh n F.
Simms, a Stevenson supporter,
apparently won renomination on
the Democratic ticket in a close
race with Ingram B. Pickett, a
backer of New York Gov. Averell
Harriman for the Democratic
Presidential nomination.
