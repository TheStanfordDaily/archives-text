# Law Professor Gives Security Lecture Today
## Was Once Masted By Fulton Lewis Jr. Over Study Grant 
### 
"Security Clearance: Practice
and Procedures" will be the sub
ject of a lecture by Professor Her
bert Packer of the Stanford Law
School.
The lecture is sponsored by the
Law Forum Board and will be in
Room 161-K at 2:15 today.
Professor Packer was recently
involved in the controversy over
the study grant presented to Stan
ford by the Fund for the Republic.
Packer Attacked
Radio commentator and news
analyst Fulton Lewis Jr. attacked
Packer early this year, saying
that Packer had been appointed
to the Stanford faculty for the
express purpose of administering
the Fund for the Republic grant.
Packer was defended by Fredric
O. Glover, assistant to University
president Wallace Sterling. Glo
ver pointed out Packer had been
under consideration for a position
on the faculty long before the
Fund for the Republic made its
offer.

Directed to Lawyers

Packer's coming lecture will be
directed to practicing lawyers in
the Bay Area and to law students.
It will cover some of the practical
problems of security clearance.
These include things to consider
before accepting a security case
as a client, and where, when and
how to get security clearance for
a client.
The Law Forum Board suggests
that persons interested in attend
ing the lecture read the recent ar
ticle in the March issue of the
Stanford Law Review entitled
"The Role of Employer Practices
in the Federal Industrial Person
nel Security Program."
