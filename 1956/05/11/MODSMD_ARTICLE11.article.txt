# Dulles Says Cuts in Aid Peril Peace
## Secretary Thinks 'Slight Adjustments May Be Appropriate' 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 10 (UP) â€”
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles warned Congress today
that "reckless" cuts in President
Eisenhower's $4.9 billion foreign
aid program would undermine
free world defenses.
But he opened the way for some
cuts when he told the House For
eign Affairs Committee that
"some slight adjustments may be
appropriate ... in view of new
information which has developed
since the program was submitted."
Informed sources had said the
administration felt the program
could be cut from $500 million to
$200 million without danger. Some
congressmen are talking in terms
of cuts of $1 billion or more.
Vital to Security
Dulles said Eisenhower and the
entire administration regard the
$4.9 billion aid program for the
new fiscal year starting next July
1 as vital to the security of the
United States and the free world.
"It would be reckless not to help
these countries to help themselves
and at the same time help us," he
declared. He said the prospects of
peace have improved but "nothing
has yet happened, in my opinion,
to make it prudent to terminate or
curtail the present program."
Dulles was the final witness be
fore the committeee, which has
been considering the program
since March 20, and soon begins
voting on various phases of the
measure. Chairman James P.
Richards (D-S.C.) said he hopes to
report a bill to the House by the
end of next week.
'Advanced Weapons'
As recommended by Eisen
hower, the program contains $3
billion in military aid, including
$530 million in "advanced weap
ons," and $1.9 billion in economic
aid for U.S. allies around the
world.
Richards said the committee
cuts "might be one dollar or $100
million or $1.5 billion. That's a lot
of money they've asked and I ser
iously doubt that it will be passed
in full."
