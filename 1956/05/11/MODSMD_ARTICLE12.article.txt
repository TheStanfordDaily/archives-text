# Leader in Senate Removes Support From Farm Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 10 (UP) —
The administration's farm leader
in the Senate withdrew his support
today from a compromise farm
bill. But there was no sign this
action portends a second presiden
tial veto.
Sen. George D. Aiken (R-Vt.),
the administration spokesman,
first told newsmen it was "not
likely" Eisenhower would veto the
farm bill approved last night by
the Senate Agriculture Committee.
The bill would establish the pres
ident's coveted $1.2 billion "soil
bank." It also would boost price
supports of feed grains eight per
cent this year.
After restudying the measure,
Aiken said the feed grain provision
differed from his original under
standing of it. Aiken, Senator GOP
member of the agriculture com
mittee, was willing to boost feed
grain props this year but opposed
a House-approved proviso for even
higher supports next year. The
committee voted 8-4 against revis
ing this plan.
Despite this opposition, Aiken
did not go so far as to predict
Eisenhower would veto the bill in
its present form. Sen. Allen J. El
lender (D-La.), committee chair
man, said he believes the President
will sign it.
