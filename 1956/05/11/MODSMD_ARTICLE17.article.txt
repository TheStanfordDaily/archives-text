## Recounts Problems Of Diplomat Working In Communist Areas 
### Truls Treider 
"There is nothing constructive
you can do as a diplomat in a cur
tain country," said white-haired
Consul General of The Nether
lands, Junker Willem Van Tets, in
a meeting at Bowman Alumni
House yesterday afternoon.
"Life becomes very difficult,
and the main task is to avoid
trouble."
Speaking before a small group
of students, the wartime secre
tary of Queen Juliana told about
four years he spent as head of t he
Dutch diplomatic mission in Cze
choslovakia from 1949.
After the Communist coup d'-
etat, life in Prague became very
restrictive for all Western diplo
mats.
Home Staffs
All home staffs were picked by
the Foreign Ministry, and at one
time the French Embassy was lit
erally besieged for a week by the
secret police.
All entrances were watched,
and the wife of the ambassador
had to show identification every
time she entered the embassy
building.
With a smile, Van Tets recalled
the Greek ambassador who in
stalled two sentinel boxes for the
secret police who constantly had
watched his residence. He install
ed stoves and painted them in the
national colors of Greece.
Secret Police
Then he wrote to the secret po
lice, who gratefully accepted the
gift.
As an example of Communist
obstruction techniques in dealing
with Western diplomats, the con
sul mentioned a case of a Dutch
business man whd got arrested
presumably for having smuggled
belongings of political refugees
out of the country after the coup
, d'etat. For 1 years the Dutch
mission worked to free him.
In the process three members
I of the staff were expelled.
