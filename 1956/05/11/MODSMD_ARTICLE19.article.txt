# UN 						Leader Sees Peace In Palestine
## Hammarksjold Gets Israel, Arab Powers To Sign Cease-Fire 
### 
UNITED NATIONS. N. Y., May
10 (UP)â€”Secretary-General Dag
Hammarskjold said tonight that
a chain reaction for Palestine
peace may have been started by
agreement of Israel and fo u r
Arab nations to a cease fire in the
Holy Land.
In a final report to the United
Nations Security Council on his
four-week peace mission to Pal
estine, Hammarskjold said t hat
he had obtained agreement of Is
rael, on one side, and Egypt, Sy
ria, Lebanon and Jordan, on the
other, to a ceasefire with sell
defense reservations.
But even as he submitted his
long-awaited report, new incidents
were reported along the Egypt inn
Israeli frontier. Egyptian authori
ties complained to UN truce ob
servers that Israeli soldiers bay
onetted an Arab farmer in the
Gaza strip and seriously wounded
an Arab national guardsman.
Charge Denied
Israeli source s denied Ihe
charge. They said Arabs crossed
the Gaza border into Israeli terri
tory and were chased back.
He asked Israel and its Arab
neighhors to do all they can "to
keep the situation under such con
trol as to minimize or eliminate
further incidents."
He urged world opinion to avoid
distorting Palestine border inci
dents in any way that would
"weaken faith in the cease-fire or
discredit the good will" of the
Middle East belligerents.
He advised Israel that it should
not resume work on its Jordan
River diversion project, to which
Syria objects, and reminded it
that it is bound by a Security
Council directive not to do so.
Council Ruling
He told Egypt that it, in similar
manner, was bound by a council
ruling against restrictions impos
ed on Israeli shipping passing
through the Suez Canal.
He appealed for settlement of
the tinderbox Palestine situation
within the framework of the UN
and without "organizational inno
vations."
This was interpreted by some
observers as a warning to ihe
major powers not to invoke such
mechanisms as the Baghdad Pact,
NATO or the American-British-
French 1950 guaranteee of the
Palestine status quo. But most
agreed that the full import of
Hammarksjold's 7500-word report
would not become clear until he
explains it at a news conference
tomorrow.
