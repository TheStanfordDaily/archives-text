The United Nations is far from perfect —a
fact that supporters of the international organi
zation would he first lo admit, But it is onl\
through intelligent study and thorough under
standing that its defects can he corrected.
Such knowledge must not he limited to the
university community or the small body of the
UN staff, hill must reach out to the American
citizenry as a whole before the UFN can expect
the support and constructive criticism that it is
the <1111v of every American citizen to give. And
il is the public education system which must
first lay the groundwork for this understanding.
We commend II U for recognizing their part
in the grand scheme of American education
and hope their supplementary efforts to bring
about a more complete understanding of the
UN may permeate the resilient exteriors of
many Jess hroad-ininded school officials.
