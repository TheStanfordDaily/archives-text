Willi 'HIE WIDE-EYED ENTHUSIASM of youth,
more llian 130 high school students will con
verge on the campus this weekend for the eighth
annual high school conference on the United
Nations.
sponsored by the Institute of International
I * • lalions, the conference will afford these
\oiuig -indents from 25 schools throughout
California the opportunity to acquire a broad
:1 11<I comprehensive knowledge of the goals, ac
tivities and principles of the United Nations.
I hat these studejits will benefit from their
experience here is confirmed by the recurrent
enthusiasm that has been generated at the past
se\en conferences.
I hat there is a serious responsibility imposed
on I lie educational institutions of this country
to provide all students with the opportunity to
learn all the facets of international organiza
tion is recognized and appreciated by such
groups as Stanford's lIR.
It is fortunate that such endeavors as this
• •an somewhat overshadow the negative features
nl inn educational pi'ngram in some areas of the
-late, especially in Los Angeles county which
has outlawed the study of UNESCO ( United

Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization) for several years.
11K last year had to change the name of its
high school meet from "conference on UNES
CO" to "conference on U M so that students
from the I a r«r«* Los Angeles area could partici
pate.
The United Nations is far from perfect —a
fact that supporters of the international organi
zation would he first lo admit, But it is onl\
through intelligent study and thorough under
standing that its defects can he corrected.
Such knowledge must not he limited to the
university community or the small body of the
UN staff, hill must reach out to the American
citizenry as a whole before the UFN can expect
the support and constructive criticism that it is
the <1111v of every American citizen to give. And
il is the public education system which must
first lay the groundwork for this understanding.
We commend II U for recognizing their part
in the grand scheme of American education
and hope their supplementary efforts to bring
about a more complete understanding of the
UN may permeate the resilient exteriors of
many Jess hroad-ininded school officials.
