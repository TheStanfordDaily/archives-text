'"censure" to "condemn" against the disputed
Political Union delegation to the USC mock
political convention on April at its weekly
meeting last Wednesday night.

mendation of vice-president-elect Sue Coshow.
She said that "censure" implies condemnation
k liile "condemn ' implies condemnation of the
actions taken by the persons.
Action was taken against the disputed dele
gation because tliey had not had the blessing of
I lie Political Union. They had obtained "key
positions" at the convention, making it impos
sible for the official group to be recognized.

sured the unofficial group upon its return. At
the next Legislature meeting lie formally
brought charges against the delegation.
