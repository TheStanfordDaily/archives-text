LASSU Criticism J
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter as an open criticism of
LASSU's procedure. I feel justified from exper
ience, having been a member of last year's ASSU
Excom.
Last Wednesday I witnessed LASSU consider
the resolution of a special subcommittee which
condemned an independent student delegation to
the Mock Republic Convention at USC on the
weekend of 4-6 April. The subcommittee was to
investigate Political Union's censure of that dele
.'■■'it ion and said delegation's appeal to that censure.
What appalled me was:
1 ) that no written explanatory report of the
subcommittee was submitted (it submitted only
its resolution);
thai the chairman of the subcommittee (also
chairman of LASSU meeting! ) admitted that on
Hie evidence that it considered it could not make
a black and white decision, and yet the subcom
mittee's resolution, particularly as amended by
the Legislature, was blaek and white;
3) thai the chairman also admitted that both
pa< lies (the Political Union and the contested del
egation) were at fault, but the subcommittee did
re olve 1 hat only one of the parties should be con
demned;
4) that on such a flimsy presentation of the
ubeommittee the Legislature approved the sub
committee's resolution by a vote of eight to four.
My recommendation is that in such a case the
■ubeommittee should submit a written explana
tory report, dropping the childish censure (or
condemnation, if you will), stating plainly that
both parties were at fault, and setting a definite
procedural policy for the future.

Editor, The Daily:
Wednesday night, our student Legislature voted
to "condemn" a group of students who attended
a Mock Republican National Convention held
earlier 1 his quarter. The Legislature based its
decision, which added to the already existent cen
sure of the group by the Political Union, on the
fact that the group was not "officially recognized"
by the Republican caucus of the Political Union.
It is an open secret that this caucus is controlled
by representatives of the isolationist, reactionary,
McCarthyist viewpoint in political thought. They
required an anti-Eisenhower oath of all partici-

pants, and excluded all prospective delegates who
were "liberal."
The group, now both censured and condemned
by our so-called "representative government," at
tended the convention realizing that they would
be held responsible for their actions upon their
return.
Nevertheless, they realized that it was their
duty to the liberal viewpoint held by the majority
of the students at Stanford to speak out for that
viewpoint if the name of our University was to
be used.
Last night our Legislature could not see the
forest for the trees, and condemned them.

Editor, The Daily:
The current situation of Radio Station KEAR
presents Stanford University with a singular op
portunity which will, by the nature of things,
undoubtedly never materialize.
Such a station would greatly benefit the radio
curriculum on the campus. The many ways in
which this would be true are too obvious to need
illustration. Still further, possession of such a
station would give Stanford a commercial prop
erty which, given a few more years, would very
probably become self-sustaining (sooner if ihe
Stanford name were behind it).
As a prestige factor in the status of the Uni
versity, possession of such a station would be
enormous since this University is supposedly a
proponent of the views and aims toward and for
which the present owners of KEAR have so long
and, now it seems, futilely striven. Off the cuff,
the relation between prestige and endowment is
another matter for brief note. It has been illus
trated, particularly in the better eastern univer
sities, that money is not necessarily given only as
a reward for athletic prowess.
Unfortunately, any kind of action by Stanford
in this matter certainly lies within the realm of
wishful speculation. It apparent that the
authorities will continue to struggle with Ihe med
ical school, which is by no means Ihe best possible
of all financial investments.
It seems a pity that such an opportunity as the
one now existing in relation to KEAR (and one
which arises very seldom) will pass into limbo
without serious consideration by Stanford's aca
demic (and commercial) powers that be.

The current situation of Radio Station KEAR
presents Stanford University with a singular op
portunity which will, by the nature of things,
undoubtedly never materialize.
Such a station would greatly benefit the radio
curriculum on the campus. The many ways in
which this would be true are too obvious to need
illustration. Still further, possession of such a
station would give Stanford a commercial prop
erty which, given a few more years, would very
probably become self-sustaining (sooner if ihe
Stanford name were behind it).
As a prestige factor in the status of the Uni
versity, possession of such a station would be
enormous since this University is supposedly a
proponent of the views and aims toward and for
which the present owners of KEAR have so long
and, now it seems, futilely striven. Off the cuff,
the relation between prestige and endowment is
another matter for brief note. It has been illus
trated, particularly in the better eastern univer
sities, that money is not necessarily given only as
a reward for athletic prowess.
Unfortunately, any kind of action by Stanford
in this matter certainly lies within the realm of
wishful speculation. It apparent that the
authorities will continue to struggle with Ihe med
ical school, which is by no means Ihe best possible
of all financial investments.
It seems a pity that such an opportunity as the
one now existing in relation to KEAR (and one
which arises very seldom) will pass into limbo
without serious consideration by Stanford's aca
demic (and commercial) powers that be.

LASSU Criticism J
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter as an open criticism of
LASSU's procedure. I feel justified from exper
ience, having been a member of last year's ASSU
Excom.
Last Wednesday I witnessed LASSU consider
the resolution of a special subcommittee which
condemned an independent student delegation to
the Mock Republic Convention at USC on the
weekend of 4-6 April. The subcommittee was to
investigate Political Union's censure of that dele
.'■■'it ion and said delegation's appeal to that censure.
What appalled me was:
1 ) that no written explanatory report of the
subcommittee was submitted (it submitted only
its resolution);
thai the chairman of the subcommittee (also
chairman of LASSU meeting! ) admitted that on
Hie evidence that it considered it could not make
a black and white decision, and yet the subcom
mittee's resolution, particularly as amended by
the Legislature, was blaek and white;
3) thai the chairman also admitted that both
pa< lies (the Political Union and the contested del
egation) were at fault, but the subcommittee did
re olve 1 hat only one of the parties should be con
demned;
4) that on such a flimsy presentation of the
ubeommittee the Legislature approved the sub
committee's resolution by a vote of eight to four.
My recommendation is that in such a case the
■ubeommittee should submit a written explana
tory report, dropping the childish censure (or
condemnation, if you will), stating plainly that
both parties were at fault, and setting a definite
procedural policy for the future.
