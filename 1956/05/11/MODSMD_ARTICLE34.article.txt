# Freshmen Meet Cal In Baseball Finale
## 
### 
Berkeley's Bearcubs will play
host to the Papoose baseballers
tomorrow at 10 a.m. when the tra
ditional rivals will square off in
the rubber game of their 1 1956
series.
Both squads have won a game,
as Stanford took the first and Cal
bounced back to even the count
last Saturday.
Clegg will send the same team
against the Berkeleyites, but has
shaken his lineup almost upside
down. Third-baseman Phil Wei
gand will lead off and Tom Schil
ling will bat second.
