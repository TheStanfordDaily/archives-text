# Village Dining Hall To Close Next Fall
## 
### 
Stanford Village dining hall will
bo closed next year, according to
John M. Yarborough, University
residences and Village director.
The small number of Village
residents and the financial aspect
has caused the decision. Plans are
currently being studied to provide
meals on campus to those villag
ers who desire them.
The Village situation has caus
ed a slight alteration of policy.
Formerly undergraduates in Uni
versity residences were required
to eat in a University dining hall,
but this requirement will not ap
ply to villagers next year because
of the distance to the campus and
its dining halls.
