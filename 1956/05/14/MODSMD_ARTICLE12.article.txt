### 
Editor's Note: Stanford President Wallace Sterling is one of the
most widely traveled university administrators in the nation today.
Early this month his travels took him to Honolulu, where ex-Daily
reporter Hay Loynd covered his speech to an alnnini gathering.
This is typical of the rrtfcny talks Sterling is called on to make in his
annual tours of the "alumni circuit."
HONOLULU, Hawaii, May 3—President Wallace Sterling stood in
the Reef Hotel on the beach at Waikiki tonight and told more than
200 Stanford alumni that "Stanford stands alone as an institution of
its type in the western two-thirds of the United States."
Here to dedicate the new University of Hawaii library, Presi-

dent Sterling said "Stanford has
strategic geographic importance,
and, were it allowed to get weak,
it would be a blow to higher edu
cation in the whole country."
Talking nearly an hour in an
after-dinner speech, Sterling dis
cussed Stanford's progress in fac
ulty salaries, curriculum changes,
enrollment and land development.
"In the last tour yearfc faculty
salaries al Stanford have increas
ed 42 per cent,"' he said. "There
is no moral justification for de
pressed faculty salaries."
And Stanford is not going to
sacrifice quality for quantity.
Stresses Quality
"We can accommodate more
graduate students," Sterling said,
"but we cannot accommodate
more undergraduates w i th o u t
making some unfavorable adjust
ments. We are going to stress
quality performance rather than
expansion for expansion's sake."
In 1900, S t e r li n g continued,
Stanford's enrollment was llfiO
24.8 per cent of the total college
attendance in California. This
year Stanford has 8403 students
but only 3 per cent of California's
college students.
Enrollment Increasing
If Stanford doesn't put on the
brnkes, Sterling said, it will have
9(500 students by 1960 and 11,860
by 1965, according to recent rates
of growth.
The cost of running Stanford
University, he continued, is met
48 per cent by tuition, 20 per cent
by gifts, 1!) per cent from endow
ments and 4 per cent from gov
ernment contracts.
The total income from gifts and I
endowments in 1051 was $2,400,-
000, he said. Last year Stanford
received $7,700,000 from such
sources and more than $10 million
is expected this year.

enrollment and land development.
"In the last tour yearfc faculty
salaries al Stanford have increas
ed 42 per cent,"' he said. "There
is no moral justification for de
pressed faculty salaries."
And Stanford is not going to
sacrifice quality for quantity.
Stresses Quality
"We can accommodate more
graduate students," Sterling said,
"but we cannot accommodate
more undergraduates w i th o u t
making some unfavorable adjust
ments. We are going to stress
quality performance rather than
expansion for expansion's sake."
In 1900, S t e r li n g continued,
Stanford's enrollment was llfiO
24.8 per cent of the total college
attendance in California. This
year Stanford has 8403 students
but only 3 per cent of California's
college students.
Enrollment Increasing
If Stanford doesn't put on the
brnkes, Sterling said, it will have
9(500 students by 1960 and 11,860
by 1965, according to recent rates
of growth.
The cost of running Stanford
University, he continued, is met
48 per cent by tuition, 20 per cent
by gifts, 1!) per cent from endow
ments and 4 per cent from gov
ernment contracts.
The total income from gifts and I
endowments in 1051 was $2,400,-
000, he said. Last year Stanford
received $7,700,000 from such
sources and more than $10 million
is expected this year.
Editor's Note: Stanford President Wallace Sterling is one of the
most widely traveled university administrators in the nation today.
Early this month his travels took him to Honolulu, where ex-Daily
reporter Hay Loynd covered his speech to an alnnini gathering.
This is typical of the rrtfcny talks Sterling is called on to make in his
annual tours of the "alumni circuit."
HONOLULU, Hawaii, May 3—President Wallace Sterling stood in
the Reef Hotel on the beach at Waikiki tonight and told more than
200 Stanford alumni that "Stanford stands alone as an institution of
its type in the western two-thirds of the United States."
Here to dedicate the new University of Hawaii library, Presi-

dent Sterling said "Stanford has
strategic geographic importance,
and, were it allowed to get weak,
it would be a blow to higher edu
cation in the whole country."
Talking nearly an hour in an
after-dinner speech, Sterling dis
cussed Stanford's progress in fac
ulty salaries, curriculum changes,
enrollment and land development.
