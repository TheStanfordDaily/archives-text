# Women to Learn Dorms Tomorrow
## 
### 
Results of house drawing will
he posted in all women's resi
dences tomorrow afternoon by
5, according to housing chair
man Sharon Roach.
Housing Committee requests
that women students do not call
the Housing Office for results.
It is impossible, she said, for
them to find out their assign
ments before lists are posted.
Women may go on shrinkage
next Monday.
Women who have not receiv
ed one of their first three
choices of residence may sub
mit their names to shrinkage
lists.
Thus, if a woman does not
come back the next quarter,
women on shrinkage are moved
into dormitories of their choice
in the order in which their
names were entered on shrink
age lists.
