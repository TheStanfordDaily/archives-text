# Recall Petitions for 7 LASSU Members Circulated—Then...?
## About 400 Signatures Received But No Trace Left of Petitions Petition Sponsors Are Still Unidentified; Disposition of Signatures Still a Mystery 
### Wally Simpson 
Petitions have been circulating around campus living groups since
Thursday asking for a recall of seven members of ASSU Legislature.
Unofficially it has been reported that about 400 signatures have been
gathered.
According to Article V Section 2 of the ASSU Constitution, a special

election may be called together by
a petition of five per cent of the
students. Four hundred signa
tures is well over five per cent of
the students.
The petitions have disappeared.
Yesterday The Daily made a
number of inquiries into the
whereabouts of the petitions and
when they would be presented to
Legislature for action. The follow
ing results were obtained:
• According to three students,
all petitions which they had been
circulating in their respective liv
ing groups were turned in to Steve
Nye, one of a group which had
been 'condemned" recently by
Legislature.
All three denied any personal
connection with the petitions.
They were circulating them as a
favor to Nye.
• Nye, himself, denied any con
nection with the petitions. He said
he had been approached by one of
his fraternity brothers, whose
name he did not divulge, with a
petition but refused to sign be
cause "I think they have gone too
far on this legislature business."
When asked about the present
whereabouts of the petitions he
said he did not know since he had
been away Saturday and the
"flood of phone calls" he received
yesterday over the petitions were
a surprise to him.
• ASSU vice-president Helen
Zarifes told The Daily she had
heard of the petitions but that she
did not know what had been done
with them. She said she had heard
a rumor to the effect that the peti
tions would not be turned in.
• About 9:15 Chris tsrookhouse
came to The Daily office asking
for a retraction of the last para
graph of a letter he had written
to the Editor of The Daily. When
asked why he wanted to retract
that part of the letter he said that
"since an agreement had been
made with members of Legisla
ture" there was no point to the
last paragraph.
He also claimed he knew noth
ing of the whereabouts of the pe
titions, but that he had received
his from Nye and had returned
them to Nye yesterday morning.
He was also unable to elaborate
further on the "agreement."
• A second call to Nye produced
no further clarification of the
mystery. He admitted he had seen
three copies of the petition but.
had no further connection with
them.
He also said that he had heard
that one had been destroyed.
When asked if he knew whether
it was legal to destroy petitions
without the consent of the signers,
he claimed he did not know.
• At 10 an un-identified caller
said that the whole thing was an
anti-Daily plot to get publicity.
From the sound of his voice the
caller appeared to be drunk. He
would not elaborate further.

Petitions have been circulating around campus living groups since
Thursday asking for a recall of seven members of ASSU Legislature.
Unofficially it has been reported that about 400 signatures have been
gathered.
According to Article V Section 2 of the ASSU Constitution, a special

election may be called together by
a petition of five per cent of the
students. Four hundred signa
tures is well over five per cent of
the students.
The petitions have disappeared.
Yesterday The Daily made a
number of inquiries into the
whereabouts of the petitions and
when they would be presented to
Legislature for action. The follow
ing results were obtained:
• According to three students,
all petitions which they had been
circulating in their respective liv
ing groups were turned in to Steve
Nye, one of a group which had
been 'condemned" recently by
Legislature.
All three denied any personal
connection with the petitions.
They were circulating them as a
favor to Nye.
• Nye, himself, denied any con
nection with the petitions. He said
he had been approached by one of
his fraternity brothers, whose
name he did not divulge, with a
petition but refused to sign be
cause "I think they have gone too
far on this legislature business."
When asked about the present
whereabouts of the petitions he
said he did not know since he had
been away Saturday and the
"flood of phone calls" he received
yesterday over the petitions were
a surprise to him.
• ASSU vice-president Helen
Zarifes told The Daily she had
heard of the petitions but that she
did not know what had been done
with them. She said she had heard
a rumor to the effect that the peti
tions would not be turned in.
• About 9:15 Chris tsrookhouse
came to The Daily office asking
for a retraction of the last para
graph of a letter he had written
to the Editor of The Daily. When
asked why he wanted to retract
that part of the letter he said that
"since an agreement had been
made with members of Legisla
ture" there was no point to the
last paragraph.
He also claimed he knew noth
ing of the whereabouts of the pe
titions, but that he had received
his from Nye and had returned
them to Nye yesterday morning.
He was also unable to elaborate
further on the "agreement."
• A second call to Nye produced
no further clarification of the
mystery. He admitted he had seen
three copies of the petition but.
had no further connection with
them.
He also said that he had heard
that one had been destroyed.
When asked if he knew whether
it was legal to destroy petitions
without the consent of the signers,
he claimed he did not know.
