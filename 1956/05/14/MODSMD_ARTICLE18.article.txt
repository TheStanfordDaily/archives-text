# UCLA Students Vote Down Recent Faculty Directive
## 
### 
The directive from the UCLA
administration to the stu den t
council which stirred considerable
controversy during the last month
was voted down last week in a
studen4 referendum. '
Twenty - two hundred seventy
eight students voted "No" on the
question "Should the students ac
cept and implement the Adminis
trative Directive?" while 1360
were in favor of the proposal.
The directive ordered the UCLA
legislature to do away with som â€¢
offices and institute new ones. In
doing so, it changed the ASUCLA
Constitution without student con
sent.
The student council itself refus
ed to implement the directive by
deciding not to hold elections this
year. This action climaxed a chain
of events which Irv Drasnin, AS
UCLA president, claims led to his
suspension from office.
Since the Administration ran
the elections in which the direc
tive was voted down, they are ob
ligated to abide by the student
body's decision.
What action will replace the
directive is not yet clear. The new
student council which will take
office next year may decide 1o
revise the constitution on their
own initiative. If not, the string
of Administration orders may not
have ended yet.
