\MID A SMOK.KSCRKFN of evasion, confusion and
"cloak and dagger" secrecy, a petition calling
for tht* recall of seven members of ASSU Legis
lature was circulated this weekend.
> e-terday the petitions were apparently de
stroyed. We say "apparently" because those
ic.oponsihlc for the petitions have refused to
divulge any concrete information concerning
I hem.
Neither have those who would have been
affected by the petitions Legislature leaders
chosen to comment.
Obviously, then, both sides in this ridiculous
controversy are hiding something from the stu
dent. I hey have alluded to a "secret agreement"
between the two parties which resulted in the
apparent destruction of the petitions.
II the petitions in question were destroyed
lli' i certainly they were destroyed without con
s< :il of the signers—there obviously was not
enough time to reach the alleged 400 signers.
Such destruction may be technically legal,
hul it is ethically wrong. The signers affixed
i!m ir signatures in £,ood faith, fully expecting
I lie recall of an incompetent Legislature.
Now their good faith has been overthrown.
\nd what is worse, those who destroyed the pe
tit ions, betraying student confidence, do not
have the decency to tell the signers the reason.
Ii is unfortunate that The Daily should have
to waste so much of its short space on the

meanderiugs of two such groups-so incompetent
and iinniatnre (lie Legislature and the mem
bers of the "disputed delegation" who resort
to such inane and childish conduct to prove
that they are right—if indeed they are.
Hul The Daily must devote its limited space
to such petty actions. hether the groups' ac
tions involve a concern for publicity or an
honest, though petty, effort to prove themselves
right, students deserve a thorough account of
ilicir humbling actions.
From the start Legislature handled the "cen
sure case" in a completely indefensible man
ner —after a week of committee study they man
aged to come up v*itli the earth-shaking decision
that the delegation should he "condemned,"
not "censured." This is reminiscent of their
work earlier in the present administration,
when the big concern of Legislature vtfas "shall
we call them by-laus or standing rules?"
Words, not action the core of an apathetic
government.
The Legislature "censured," or "condemned"
if you will, the action of the delegation in going
to the USC Mock Convention. This "con
demned" group exerted their perogative, how
ever petty it may have been, in attempting to
register protest against Legislature's decision.
Then tlie\ backtracked and called the whole
thing off.

\MID A SMOK.KSCRKFN of evasion, confusion and
"cloak and dagger" secrecy, a petition calling
for tht* recall of seven members of ASSU Legis
lature was circulated this weekend.

stroyed. We say "apparently" because those
ic.oponsihlc for the petitions have refused to
divulge any concrete information concerning
I hem.
Neither have those who would have been
affected by the petitions Legislature leaders
chosen to comment.
Obviously, then, both sides in this ridiculous
controversy are hiding something from the stu
dent. I hey have alluded to a "secret agreement"
between the two parties which resulted in the
apparent destruction of the petitions.
II the petitions in question were destroyed
lli' i certainly they were destroyed without con
s< :il of the signers—there obviously was not
enough time to reach the alleged 400 signers.
Such destruction may be technically legal,
hul it is ethically wrong. The signers affixed
i!m ir signatures in £,ood faith, fully expecting
I lie recall of an incompetent Legislature.
Now their good faith has been overthrown.
\nd what is worse, those who destroyed the pe
tit ions, betraying student confidence, do not
have the decency to tell the signers the reason.
Ii is unfortunate that The Daily should have
to waste so much of its short space on the

meanderiugs of two such groups-so incompetent
and iinniatnre (lie Legislature and the mem
bers of the "disputed delegation" who resort
to such inane and childish conduct to prove
that they are right—if indeed they are.
Hul The Daily must devote its limited space
to such petty actions. hether the groups' ac
tions involve a concern for publicity or an
honest, though petty, effort to prove themselves
right, students deserve a thorough account of
ilicir humbling actions.
From the start Legislature handled the "cen
sure case" in a completely indefensible man
ner —after a week of committee study they man
aged to come up v*itli the earth-shaking decision
that the delegation should he "condemned,"
not "censured." This is reminiscent of their
work earlier in the present administration,
when the big concern of Legislature vtfas "shall
we call them by-laus or standing rules?"
Words, not action the core of an apathetic
government.
The Legislature "censured," or "condemned"
if you will, the action of the delegation in going
to the USC Mock Convention. This "con
demned" group exerted their perogative, how
ever petty it may have been, in attempting to
register protest against Legislature's decision.
Then tlie\ backtracked and called the whole
thing off.
