## LASSU Recall Petition 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I feel that I can no longer remain silent on the
subject of our student government.
i have been told that as a Stanford student I
am. in genenil, apathetic toward student govern
ment and maybe 1 am. There seemed to lie little
reason to choose from one exponent of medioc
rity over another. *
But 1 was wrong. A representative of apathy*
becomes irresponsible. This is not theory; it was
demonstrated in the case of the Eisenhower dele
gation to USC and in the refusal of a petition for
procedural regularity in the women's housing
question. Attempts by some members of the leg
i lative group to get full information were shout
ed down to "get through with this business."
The point is that we don't have to put up with
this kind of uninterested, unrepresentative stu
dent government. And if we show that we won't,
maybe future Legislatures will think twice about
fioir careless and ill-considered and unfair pro
cedure. The name of apathy which swept them
into office shouldn't have to support them in
ii responsibility once they're in.
I have been asked to distribute a petition call
ing for the recall of seven of those who have
most flagrantly abused the position of a student â€¢
office. I have accepted with pride. The two-thirds
vote may not be obtained at the polls, but an
honest protest from those interested in a sem
blance of honest government will, in my opinion,
be what student government at this University
needs.

Editor's Note: Precisely.
