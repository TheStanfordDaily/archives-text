# 'Unjust Condemnation'
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
There seems to be some confusion as to the
"legality" of the two delegations attending the
USC Mock Convention. Perhaps a few facts con
coning the matter would be appropriate:
1. Under the rules of the Republican National
Convention, which the Mock Republican Conven
tion naturally adopted, the "official" dele
gation from any area is the one recognized by
the Credentials Committee.
Until the committee passes on the legality of
any group, no delegation has the right to claim
to be the one and only official delegation from
an area. Any other course on the part of any
• roup would be a contravention of the convention
lilies.
This is aside, of course, from the idea that
whenever a school sponsors and organizes a con
vention of any sort, one of its committees should
have the privilege of aiding in the determination
ol who shall officially attend.
l' USC realized that most collegiate partisan
political groups are off-campus. Therefore, the
f ' mmittee on Organization so constructed the
•iter of invitation (and subsequent correspond
ence) that, although no interested student could
I"' denied affiliation with the group attending
I :iC. these partisan bodies wotdd not be enabled
tn take a major part in the convention.
In every case except Stanford this hope was
II ilized; all other schools at which groups existed
<ori or off campus) forwarded the letter to such
bodies, which handled it from there. Only at
• hools lacking such organizations (not the case
•it Stanford) did a Political Science Department
• onfider stepping in to organize a delegation.
In no case except at Stanford was the invita
tion so misconstrued as to permit a student body
legislature, or any non-partisan group under it,
to feel entitled to appoint and send down an "of
ficial" delegation (Stanford being the only col
lege which attempted to send down an "author
ized" delegation to the Mock Convention), and
one that was to be accepted, despite the rules, "or
else" (the tone the condemnation assumed).

3. The statement by Frank Huntress in the
Daily article of May 11 displays an amazing un
awareness of the events as they took place. It
read: "They 11he condemned delegation] had ob
tained key positions at the convention, making it
impossible for the official group to be recog
nized." Now, 1 think it would be highly irregular
for a member of a disputed delegation to be an
official on a committee reviewing the legality of
his delegation.
To credit the USC Organizational Committee
with any intelligence, I must say I am sure it
would feel the same way and act accordingly.
But such opinions are theoretical, for in fact the
two delegations merged (by mutual consent) be
fore the convention or any of its committees
(save Organization USC only) began to function.
These are only a few of the reasons why the
disputed delegation feels the condemnation was
unjust, but I believe they are enough. If anyone
wishes confirmation of the above, he is invited
to write the Political Science Department at USC,
or else Ralph Goodson, president of the USC
Young Republicans, the group which organized
Ihe Mocjjrßepublican Convention.

Editor, The Daily:
There seems to be some confusion as to the
"legality" of the two delegations attending the
USC Mock Convention. Perhaps a few facts con
coning the matter would be appropriate:
1. Under the rules of the Republican National
Convention, which the Mock Republican Conven
tion naturally adopted, the "official" dele
gation from any area is the one recognized by
the Credentials Committee.
Until the committee passes on the legality of
any group, no delegation has the right to claim
to be the one and only official delegation from
an area. Any other course on the part of any
• roup would be a contravention of the convention
lilies.
This is aside, of course, from the idea that
whenever a school sponsors and organizes a con
vention of any sort, one of its committees should
have the privilege of aiding in the determination
ol who shall officially attend.
l' USC realized that most collegiate partisan
political groups are off-campus. Therefore, the
f ' mmittee on Organization so constructed the
•iter of invitation (and subsequent correspond
ence) that, although no interested student could
I"' denied affiliation with the group attending
I :iC. these partisan bodies wotdd not be enabled
tn take a major part in the convention.
