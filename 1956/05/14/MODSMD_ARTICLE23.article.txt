# An 'Impartial Judge'
## 
### 
Editor, The DaiJy:
So many false ideas, statements and impres
sions have been bandied about lately with regard
to the Political Union's censure (later changed by
the ASSU Legislature to condemnation) of the
illegal Republican delegation that I feel I must
set the record straight.
First of all, the reasons for our censure of the
group are perfectly expressed by' the report as
amended by Legislature (which is imparted ex
cept for the members of it who belong to the
Stanford Area Young Republicans; to my knowl
edge, none of Legislature belongs to the Political
Union).
Second, it is a fact that every single person
who asked to become a member of the Political
Union's delegation was accepted; not one was
denied access.
The fact remains that all but two of the
illegal delegation never did ask to become a part
of the Union's delegation (these two were also
on the Union's delegation), and, in fact, I specif
ically asked Cliff Kimber, vice-president of the
county Young Republican organization, to try to
get people from the Young Republicans to sign
upâ€”which he did, with no results.
Steve Nye and company planned their action
weeks in advance, but kept it a secret from any
one trying to organize the Union's delegation.
The invitation to go to the convention went to
President Sterling, George Ralph and the politi
cal science department, who turned it over to us.
We negotiated it, arranging for our assignment
of states, etc.
Mike Hudson was simply organizing the dele
gation. No unit rule or anti-Eisenhower pledge
was ever considered, much less imposed.
The delegation could choose its own chairman;
therefore, if the Young Republicans had turned
out, they could have selected the delegation's
chairman.
It there was anything irregular in Hudson's
handling of the organization, an appeal to myself,
anyone on Legislature or to the Administration
would have brought quick results, but none was
ever registered.
It is obvious that the leaders of the Young Re
publicans simply decided that they would have
to lie the whole show, that by pulling a few
strings at the convention they could get their
way. The time, effort and work by the Union
thus is tossed aside by a few self-centered people
who cannot accept a viewpoint of an impartial
judge (Legislature), but typically strike back at
anyone or anything that does not do exactly as
they wish.
