# This Week on Quad
## 
### JIM PALMER 
The voices of hundreds of Stanford men and
women will highlight this week on Quad in
Friday's annual Spring Sing in Frost Amphi
theatre. This event is a traditional ear-pleaser
(chirping crickets cover the sour notes fairly
well) and should attract music-lovers who are
being disenfranchised by KEAR but don't
mind.
The match-lighting ceremony (which is the
University's way of conserving electricity and
at the same time assuring a handsome side
profit from the Diamond Match Co.) will be the
big thrill of the evening for all you pyro
maniacs.

Monday's blues will get that pink tinge at
4:15 in Cubberley when Yugoslav Ambassador
Lett Mates speaks on "Postwar Development of
Yugoslavia and Her Foreign Policy." Party
members will get the best seals, and if you fhy
""Fitsent me,'' yon may get an all-expense paid
trip lit front nun-center.
Not to be outdone by the Slavs, the School of
Mineral Sciences Journal Club presents a 4 p.m.
lecture on ''Lower Jurassic Pectens of Western
North America" in Room 320 of the Geology
Bldg. by Dr. Siemon W. Muller of Stanford.
This challenging topic gives us all something to
think about I i.e., what the hell are pectens?),
■» * *
Three lectures comprise Tuesday's agenda.
Starting with "Social and Economic Develop
ments in the Belgian Congo" we move to "Fungi
and Fellowman" and finally hear about "French
Politics and the North African Crisis."
The initial talk will be by Dr. J. A. Coris of
the Relgiurn Information Rureau ami will lake
place in Rownxan Alumni House. All alums
from Relgium and also Prince Albert (nitl the
one in a can) have been invited.
The fungi on campus have a field-day when
Dr. William H. Weston of Harvard devotes his
entire lecture to the little stuff at 4:30 p.m. in
Cubberley. Moldy bread, mushroom stools and
Stern food will receive special attention, un
doubtedly.
History Professor H. Stuart Hughes delivers
the I uesday Series talk at 7:30 iu Memorial
Auditorium on the African situation. Students
of Dr. Hughes' "Europe Since 1914" classes who
like good grades should attend and furnish ap
plause, laughter and cheers at propitious mo
