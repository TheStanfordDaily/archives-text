# Roy Stephen Leads Whites To 26-21 Win
## Coach Taylor Shows Optimism After Grid Scrimmage Saturday 
### Dave Canfield 
"We have the possibilities for
the best team we've ever had,"
exclaimed Coach Chuck Taylor
after Saturday's spring football
scrimmage.
Forty-seven points were scored
Saturday as relative unknowns
stole the show from veterans. Per
haps the brightest light in Tay
lor's galaxy of newcomers was
Roy Stephen, a slippery scatback
from Santa Ana Junior College.
On the second play, Stephen
dazzled the crowd of about 200.
Picking up a fumble on his own
2-yard line, Stephen neatly revers
ed his field with half the Red
team chasing him and sprinted 43
yards before being run out of
bounds.
The former Marine went on to
score two touchdowns and lead
the Whites to a come-from-behind
26-21 win over the Reds.
Nicolet Scores
Following S t e p h en's 43-yard
dash, the Whites kept right on
going to paydirt. Quarterback Bob
Nicolet, an expert sleight-of-hand
artist, dove over for the touch
down.
The conversion was missed. The
Whites kicked off to the Reds,
and before the Red eleven could
move the ball down the field,
White end Carl Isaacs blocked a
punt for a safety.
Another kickoff to the Reds re
sulted in another White touch
down. This time Stephen inter
cepted a Red pass on the Red 30
to set up the score.
Four plays later Stephen hur
dled over the Red line for the 14th
point. Again the extra-point try
failed.
Hopkins Pitches
With soph quarterback Les
Hopkins doing the pitching, the
Red team fought back. Hopkins
faded back on his own 32 and hit
halfback Wally Honeywell in the
clear 36 yards downfield. Honey
well sprinted the rest of the way
to the end zone.
Hopkins booted the extra point
and the score was 14-7. Less than
five minutes later, Red halfback
Doug Dick found a huge hole
off-tackle and barreled 40 yards
straight into the end zone. Dick
booted his own extra point to even
the count, 14-14.
On virtually the same scoring
play, wifh a different ball carrier,
the Reds later snatched a 21-14
lead. This time it was Samoan A 1
Harrington who slashed his way
40 yards off-tackle to paydirt.
Ukropina at Helm
Wi,th freshman Jim Ukropina
at the helm, the Whites drove
back 75 yards for a retaliatory
TD. On successive plays of this
drive, Ukropina fired a perfect 15-
yard pass to Bob Gergen and a 48-
yard touchdown strike to Gordy
Young.
Stephen pulled off his second
interception later on the Red 25.
It took just two plays from here
to wrap up the'game.
A Nicolet-to-Isaacs pass ate up
17 yards. From the 8, Stephen,
behind perfect blocking, drove off
guard untouched into the end
zone.
Again the extra point was no
good. After that the Reds never
threatened.
Injuries removed two freshman
hopefuls from play in Saturday's
scrimmage. White end Joe Hook
er suffered a dislocated shoulder,
which may keep him out of next
Saturday's final scrimmage. Red
guard Troy Barbee sprained an
ankle.
"The scrimmage was quite an
improvement over the last one,"
Taylor said. "There was some real
good playing and some real bad
playing. The blocking and tack
ling were quite good."

It took just two plays from here
to wrap up the'game.
A Nicolet-to-Isaacs pass ate up
17 yards. From the 8, Stephen,
behind perfect blocking, drove off
guard untouched into the end
zone.
Again the extra point was no
good. After that the Reds never
threatened.
Injuries removed two freshman
hopefuls from play in Saturday's
scrimmage. White end Joe Hook
er suffered a dislocated shoulder,
which may keep him out of next
Saturday's final scrimmage. Red
guard Troy Barbee sprained an
ankle.
"The scrimmage was quite an
improvement over the last one,"
Taylor said. "There was some real
good playing and some real bad
playing. The blocking and tack
ling were quite good."
"We have the possibilities for
the best team we've ever had,"
exclaimed Coach Chuck Taylor
after Saturday's spring football
scrimmage.
Forty-seven points were scored
Saturday as relative unknowns
stole the show from veterans. Per
haps the brightest light in Tay
lor's galaxy of newcomers was
Roy Stephen, a slippery scatback
from Santa Ana Junior College.
On the second play, Stephen
dazzled the crowd of about 200.
Picking up a fumble on his own
2-yard line, Stephen neatly revers
ed his field with half the Red
team chasing him and sprinted 43
yards before being run out of
bounds.
The former Marine went on to
score two touchdowns and lead
the Whites to a come-from-behind
26-21 win over the Reds.
Nicolet Scores
Following S t e p h en's 43-yard
dash, the Whites kept right on
going to paydirt. Quarterback Bob
Nicolet, an expert sleight-of-hand
artist, dove over for the touch
down.
The conversion was missed. The
Whites kicked off to the Reds,
and before the Red eleven could
move the ball down the field,
White end Carl Isaacs blocked a
punt for a safety.
Another kickoff to the Reds re
sulted in another White touch
down. This time Stephen inter
cepted a Red pass on the Red 30
to set up the score.
Four plays later Stephen hur
dled over the Red line for the 14th
point. Again the extra-point try
failed.
Hopkins Pitches
With soph quarterback Les
Hopkins doing the pitching, the
Red team fought back. Hopkins
faded back on his own 32 and hit
halfback Wally Honeywell in the
clear 36 yards downfield. Honey
well sprinted the rest of the way
to the end zone.
Hopkins booted the extra point
and the score was 14-7. Less than
five minutes later, Red halfback
Doug Dick found a huge hole
off-tackle and barreled 40 yards
straight into the end zone. Dick
booted his own extra point to even
the count, 14-14.
On virtually the same scoring
play, wifh a different ball carrier,
the Reds later snatched a 21-14
lead. This time it was Samoan A 1
Harrington who slashed his way
40 yards off-tackle to paydirt.
Ukropina at Helm
Wi,th freshman Jim Ukropina
at the helm, the Whites drove
back 75 yards for a retaliatory
TD. On successive plays of this
drive, Ukropina fired a perfect 15-
yard pass to Bob Gergen and a 48-
yard touchdown strike to Gordy
Young.
Stephen pulled off his second
interception later on the Red 25.
