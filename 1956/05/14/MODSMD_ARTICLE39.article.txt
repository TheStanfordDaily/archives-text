Humiliating is the only word!
for what Stanford Frosh baseball
ers did to the Cal Teddy Bears at
Berkeley Saturday. The Papooses
ground out 12 big runs as they
tromped all over the hapless Cal
frosh to win the game 12-8.
Although it would appear to be
a hitting game, it was more a ease
of Stanford's coming through in
the clutches and Cal's folding up
under the same conditions. The
Papooses scored their 12 runs on
13 walks and only eight key hits.
With the score reading Stanford
6, Cal 5 in the top of the eighth,
Papoose bats pounded out six big
runs in their half of that frame to |
put the game on ice.

With the top of the order lead
ing off in that inning, Stanford's
first three hitters were granted
free passes to fill the bags and
call for Cal relief pitcher Ken Mai
lary.
Mallary, supposedly one of
Northern California's most talent
ed young chuckers, walked the
first man to face him, Captain
Rich DeFabio, to drive in a run
and make the count 7-5 in favor
of Stanford.
Then the roof fell in on the
Bearcubs as successive singles by
Mike Lindeman, Joel Newkirk and

Art von Wronski drove five more
tallies across.
The Frosh had jumped off to an
early lead and were never behind
in the game.
Stanford 310 100 100—12
Cal 010 020 203 — 8
