For the first time this spring,
students have conducted outings
to a Stanford hostel, Camp Monte
Cristo in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains.
Has the hostel program been a
success? To learn the answer to
this question, The Daily question
ed several faculty members and
one student who participated in
the hostel.
All the hostelers readily af
firmed the success of the innova
tion. Among their enthusiastic
comments were: "no substitute
for it," "a program not duplicated
in the classroom" and "terrific
spontaneity."
"The hostel," commented Polit
ical Science Professor Alfred de-
Grazia, "is more beneficial than
much of classroom work, hour
per hour. There is no substitute
for it. Anything that makes intel
lectual and cultural work part of
the day's routine is good."
The spontaneity encouraged by
a hostel is one of its strong points,
according to graduate student
Goff Newcomb. Newcomb attend
ed the April 13-15 outing, at which
segregation was discussed.
"Two or three discussions were
going on at one time," said Ncw

comb, "and none of them were on
the subject supposedly under dis
cussion. That's important because
it shows the kids don't need a
catalyst to start talking."
Leading "Sex and Ethics" dis
cussions at the hostel last week
end, Harry Rathbun, law profes
sor, and Edmund Volkart, sociol
ogy professor, were involved in
the only hostel to attract the full

quota of 20 students.
V o Ik a r t explained this "full
house" hy saying: "I think that
was not because of the topic, but
because the word had gotten
around. Several people said to me
that they had heard favorable
things about previous weeks' hos
tels. Since it was the last hostel
of the year, everyone wanted to
sign up."
