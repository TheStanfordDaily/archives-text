# Robin Moore Leads Indian Mermen to Win Over Bears
## Moore Swims Relay Lap in Record 48.9 Time; Five Coast Conference Records Are Shattered 
### 
Led by Robin "Jagur" Moore, Stanford's flashy mermen breezed by
a mediocre California team, 56-28, in the wind-up of the dual season
here on Saturday. In what Card coach Tom Haynie termed "the team's
best performance yet," a world's freestyle record was bettered, a
national breaststroke mark eclipsed, and five Pacific Coast Confer
ence standards smashed.
Anchoring the victorious four man relay team, ace sprinter and

national champion Moore sizzled
out a fantastic 48.9 for his hun
dred yard lap, bettering the exist
ing world's record of 49.0 held by
Hawaii's Dick Cleveland.
Although there were two special
watches on Moore, the time will
not be counted officially as it was
made during a relay event.
Earlier in the meet, "Jaguar"
smashed two P.C.C. records as he
won the 50 and 100 yd. freestyle
events in the times of 22.5 and
49.5, respectively.
New NCAA Mark
Breaststroke artist Cole Wilbur
finally produced in a meet the per
formances which he has been reg
istering in practice. Touring the
200 yd. breaststroke distance in
2:20.7, Wilbur obliterated the Na
tional Collegiate mark of 2:24 and
the P.C.C. standard of 2:25.5.
The four man relay, composed
of team captain Carver Nixon,
Tad Devine, Phil Gay and Robin
Moore broke its own conference
standard with a speedy 3:25.9 per
formance. According to Coach
Haynio, this time places the In
dian relay team among the top
three foursomes in the nation.
In the distance events, Tom Bur
ton handily defeated touted Jack
McNees of California in t he 440 yd.
freestyle in 4:53.1.
Earlier in the meet, Burton was
runner-up in the 220 yd. freestyle
to Tad Devine, who was victorious
with the time of 2:12.2.
Medley Victory
Other outstanding perform
ances for the Cards were the win
of the medley relay composed of
Ron Grunt, Fred Miller and Car
ver Nixon, and Phil Gay's close
second to Moore in the 50 yd. free
style.
The mermen continued their
rout over the Bears as Bob Mc-
Intyre and Joe Critchfield placed
first and third in the three meter
dive.
In the frosh swimming meet,
which was held simultaneously
with varsity events, Stanford's
yearlings narrowly squeaked out
a 45-39 victory over the Bears.
Outstanding performances were
turned in by Wayne Mahl, who
established a new meet standard
of 2:17.0 in the 200 yd. backstroke,
and diver Scott Catlett. who easily
defeated all comers in the 3 meter
dive.
This week, the mermen termi
nate their sixth straight season as
undefeated when the P.C.C.
championship meet will be staged
at Encina Pools, May 17-19.
Catlett, whom coach Haynie
rates a top diver nationally, amas
sed over 200 points in the event.
The meet concluded an undefeat
ed season for him.

Led by Robin "Jagur" Moore, Stanford's flashy mermen breezed by
a mediocre California team, 56-28, in the wind-up of the dual season
here on Saturday. In what Card coach Tom Haynie termed "the team's
best performance yet," a world's freestyle record was bettered, a
national breaststroke mark eclipsed, and five Pacific Coast Confer
ence standards smashed.
Anchoring the victorious four man relay team, ace sprinter and

national champion Moore sizzled
out a fantastic 48.9 for his hun
dred yard lap, bettering the exist
ing world's record of 49.0 held by
Hawaii's Dick Cleveland.
Although there were two special
watches on Moore, the time will
not be counted officially as it was
made during a relay event.
Earlier in the meet, "Jaguar"
smashed two P.C.C. records as he
won the 50 and 100 yd. freestyle
events in the times of 22.5 and
49.5, respectively.
New NCAA Mark
Breaststroke artist Cole Wilbur
finally produced in a meet the per
formances which he has been reg
istering in practice. Touring the
200 yd. breaststroke distance in
2:20.7, Wilbur obliterated the Na
tional Collegiate mark of 2:24 and
the P.C.C. standard of 2:25.5.
The four man relay, composed
of team captain Carver Nixon,
Tad Devine, Phil Gay and Robin
Moore broke its own conference
standard with a speedy 3:25.9 per
formance. According to Coach
Haynio, this time places the In
dian relay team among the top
three foursomes in the nation.
In the distance events, Tom Bur
ton handily defeated touted Jack
McNees of California in t he 440 yd.
freestyle in 4:53.1.
Earlier in the meet, Burton was
runner-up in the 220 yd. freestyle
to Tad Devine, who was victorious
with the time of 2:12.2.
Medley Victory
Other outstanding perform
ances for the Cards were the win
of the medley relay composed of
Ron Grunt, Fred Miller and Car
ver Nixon, and Phil Gay's close
second to Moore in the 50 yd. free
style.
The mermen continued their
rout over the Bears as Bob Mc-
Intyre and Joe Critchfield placed
first and third in the three meter
dive.
In the frosh swimming meet,
which was held simultaneously
with varsity events, Stanford's
yearlings narrowly squeaked out
a 45-39 victory over the Bears.
