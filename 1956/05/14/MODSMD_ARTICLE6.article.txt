# Husky Crews Defeat Tribe Rowing Teams
## 
### 
Washington's perennially
strong rowing team proved too
strong for the upstart Stanford
Indians in Seattle Saturday. The
Husky crew was victorious in var
sity, junior varsity and freshman
races against the ever-improving
Cards.
Called the possible "crew of the
year" by Stanford coach Lou
Lindsey, Washington's oarsmen
were pressed all the way before
opening up two lengths between
their boat and the Tribe.
The Huskies moved to the front
early and led hv three-quarters of
a length after the first mile. UW
coxswain Wayne Waters, of all
name's, called for a "Big Ten" at
this point and the Husky eight
stretched their lead to two full
boat lengths.
Stanford slowly narrowed the
gap to one boat distance before
the victors turned on the pressure
in the stretch.
Washington's winning time
over the 2"H-mile course was 14:
26.1. The Tribe oarsmen turned in
a 14:34.5 time over the choppy
course.
The second Husky boat, practi
cally as fast as the first, had lit
tle trouble in subduing Stanford
JV's, winning handily by seven
lengths.
In the freshman race, Washing
ton turned in a time of 10:46.8
over the two-mile course to cap
ture the victory. Stanford trailed
by six lengths and was timed at
11:10.
The Indian crew will not have
another shot at the mythical Pa
cific Coast Conference champions
until the IRA regatta in Syracuse
next month.
