# Adlai, Estes Speak From Same Stage
## Kefauver Arrives In Lincoln Convertible But Adlai Rides Horse 
### 
LOS BANOS, Calif., May 13
(UP)—Adlai Stevenson and Estes
Kefauver spoke from the same
platform today. Both men lam
basted the Administration's farm
program before an audience of
2000 at the Los Banos Annual
Spring Fair.
A coin was flipped by Los Ba
nos Mayor John Erreca to deter
mine who should speak first. Ste
venson won.
The two rivals bumped into
each other earlier at the festival
while they were busy shaking
hands, and exchanged cordial
greetings. Neither mentioned the
other in his address.
Stevenson and Kefauver were
a study in contrasts as they rode
in the parade preceding the fair.
The Tennessee senator, dressed in
a conservative business suit,
cruised down the main street of
this small San Joaquin Valley
town in an expensive Lincoln con
vertible.
Stevenson rode a horse, decked
out in tight-fitting dungarees and
a 10-gallon hat.
In his speech, Stevenson called
for a three-point program to re
lieve the farmer's problems:
• A clean-cut farm price sup
port program.
• A soil bank plan going "much
further" than present proposals
to make it financially attractive
to the farmer to withhold his land
from production.
• Utilization of crop surpluses
to reduce "want, and hunger at
home and abroad."
Kefauver charged that the far
mers "have been treated badly."
"We know that you are not go
ing to be fooled by false prom
ises," he said. "We want the kind
of economy in which all the peo
ple—farmer and banker—can live
in prosperity and peace."
Later in the day, Stevenson, ar
riving in Oregon for his final drive
for primary votes, said the Ad
ministration has fallen down on
meeting the needs of the people,
especially the farm population. He
also struck at Republican han
dling of highway, school and so
cial security programs.
