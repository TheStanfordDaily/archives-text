# Court Okays Autherine Entry Order
## Denies Reversal Of Lower Court Admission Ruling 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 14 < UP)
The Supreme Court today re
buffed an effort by the University
of Alabama to upset a lower court
order requiring it to admit negro
co-ed Autherine J. Lucy.
In a brief order and without a
written opinion, the high court re
jected the contention of university
officials that the Lucy case should
have been heard by a three-judge
lower court instead of by District
Judge H. H. Grooms alone.
Grooms last year ordered the
university to admit the Jefferson
County, Ala., coed. The univer
sity at first complied, but its ac
tion provoked a series of anti
negro riots on the campus that at
tracted nationwide attention.
The school subsequently ex
pelled Miss Lucy on grounds that
she made baseless charges against
university officials. She had said
that she plans to seek re-admission
in the future.
The Supreme Court's decision to
leave the Grooms order standing
will have no practical effect on the
educational fuutre of Miss Lucy.
But it was the latest in a series
of court actions holding that tax
supported colleges and universi
ties in the south must admit quali
fied negroes promptly and with
out delay.
In other major actions, the Su
preme Court:
• Refused to reconsider its rul
ing last month that the Federal
Government has assumed exclu
sive jurisdiction over the prosecu
tion of subversives. The decision,
which freed Pittsburgh commu
nist leafier Steve Nelson, had the
effect of nullifying the sedition
laws of 13 states.
• Agreed to speed up the issu
ance of its formal order requiring
the Subversive Activities Control
Board to hold further hearings in
the case against the Communist
Party. The order, handed down
on April 30, normally would have
taken 2.1 days to become effective.
The Government sought the
speed-up so the board can reopen
the case without delay.
• Refused to hear an appeal by
the Union Oil Company of Califor
nia. which contends that Califor
nia's "Smog Control" law is un
constitutional. The high court said
no federal issue is involved in the
enforcement of the anti-pollution
law.
