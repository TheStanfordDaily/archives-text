# Recall Petition Mystery Is Still Unsolved
## Daily Gets Anonymous Phone Call, Conflicting Rumors Circulate 
### 
The mystery of the recall peti
tions is no closer to solution today
than it was yesterday. Rumors
have been floating around campus
with all sorts of conjectures find
ing their way into The Daily's of
fices.
The petitions were circulated
among campus living groups call
ing for the ouster of seven mem
bers of ASSU Legislature for ir
responsible acts in the perform
ance of their legislative duties. As
of last night there was no evidence
of their whereabouts.
Anonymous Call
Last night a call came into The
Daily from a woman who called
herself a Stanford student. She
refused to identify herself further.
She said that she was quite sure
the net it ions would be presented to
ASSU Legislature, calling for a
campus-wide vote to recall seven
members of the Legislature. When
asked to elaborate, she abruptly
hung up.
Zarifes Surprised
ASSU vice-president Helen Zari
fes appeared surprised when told
of the anonymous call. She ex
pressed the hope that the call was
just a prank and that the petitions
would not be presented.
Several sources have indicated
that the petitions have been de
stroyed. Though none of these
sources would allow themselves to
be quoted, they all felt quite sure
no more than two of the petitions
are still in existence.
Two other sources were equally
sure that the petitions had not
been destroyed, but were either
unable or unwilling to tell why.
