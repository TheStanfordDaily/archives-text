### 
BERKELEY, May 14 (UP) â€”
Democratic Sen. Estes Kefauver,
handshaking his way through Cal
ifornia, lit into the Eisenhower
Administration today for "not
having a policy of its own."
The Presidential hopeful from
Tennessee also told some 5000
University of California students
that "we have lost many friends
and much prestige by relying only
on our military might."
"This Administration," Kefau
ver said, "has been bypassing the
United Nations and going it alone
by developing mass scares."
Speaking at the university's
west gate, traditional meeting
place of political candidates, Ke
fauver charged that the present
Administration ignored the
"greatest organization for peace
there is" by failing to vote $40
million for the United Nations.
"We must follow our heritage,"
he said, "and demand individual
dignity among nations as well as
men."
The Tennessee Democrat slam
med the Republican Administra
tion "for not having a policy of
its own, not knowing where we
stand and for continuously equiv
ocating."
