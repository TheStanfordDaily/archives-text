# Law, Med School Fiendishly Plot to Win Golf Tourney
## 
### 
The cunning brains of the Stanford Legal Eagles have come up
with what looks like a fool-proof way to circumvent the recent move
on the part of the Body Snatchers to cinch the coming golf tourney.
The Body Snatchers (the faculty of the Stanford School of Medi
cine) have established the "Carl Spaeth Fellowship in Physical
Medicine." This is an honorary position named for the dean of the
Stanford Law School.
"Sandy" Tatum is to be awarded the fellowship. Tatum, a Stan
ford graduate and practicing lawyer, is a one-time winner of the
Intercollegiate Golf Championship.
The fellowship will enable him to play on the Body Snatchers team.
To combat this sly move, the Legal Eagles are planning to have
Phil Neal, professor of law, play as Tatum's opponent.
"If Tatum is sane the following morning, it won't be Neal's fault,"
said Spaeth. It seems Neal has never won a match.
This is the Third Annual Body Snatcher-Legal Eagle Golf Tourney.
The faculties of the respective schools are competing for possession
of a trophy to be presented by Spaeth. The trophy is enscribed:
"Lex versus Lux. (law versus light).
