# Yugoslav Diplomat Tells Of Postwar Development
## Ambassador Says Tito Collectivism Differs In Theory from Marx, Russian Communism 
### Stew Toy 
Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States Leo Mates told a Cub
berley Auditorium audience yesterday that Yugoslavia at the end of
World War II faced an "even greater emergency" than that in the
preceding years of strife.
"It was the end of the shooting war," the ambassador said, "but it

was the beginning of a new war—
a war against poverty and desti
tution."
Mates, speaking on Yugoslav
ia's postwar development and for
eign policy, said his country's
first task after the war "was to
get the state going again—and
from this I mean to start from
scratch."
During the war, he said, Yugo
slavia's "liberators" divided the
country into seven occupation
zones and replaced all national in
stitutions with "Quisling institu
tions."
From the Bottom
The postwar return to national
rule required "complete reorgani
zation from the bottom in all
fields, which had to be accom
plished in a state of emergency
not unlike that in a country rav
aged by floods."
Because of this situation "con
siderable centralism had to be in
troduced, run on an emergency
basis."
Yugoslavia's goal in its postwar
reorganization, he said, was to
form a state "to serve its citizens,
not to make the citizens an annex
to state machinery."
Differs from Russia
The Yugoslav brand of collec
tive ownership differs from that
in the Soviet Union. Mates said.
In Yugoslavia "workers run the
affairs of the factories, which are
public property entrusted to
them."
lie said "we've borrowed much
from the Soviet Union in econom
ics and in many other respects.
But we've found that, as a perma
nent way of organizing the state,
the Soviet method is bad because
of the overwhelming role of the
state.
"As much as this system may
increase efficiency, it results in
the ultimate power of material
goods over human beings."
Mates said "Marx has helped us
solve our problems. His writings
ate very illuminating in studying
social development. But he didn't
show us the pattern of things to
come in the future."
Foreign Policy
Yugoslavia's internal develop
ment has naturally had an impor
tant effect on its foreign policy,
the ambassador said. "Necessari
ly, our national differences have
projected themselves on the inter
national outlook of the country."
Yugoslavia has had tense rela
tions with each of its surrounding
European' neighbors in the 10
years since the end of the war.
Mates called the Russo-Yugo'slav
dispute of 1948 "the greatest ten
sion short of war known in our
history."
But Yugoslavia is now on
friendly terms with all countries,
fie said. "We don't feel hostility
or tension toward any nation in
the world."
He said he is "convinced" his
country is "making progress in
foreign relations and helping to
solve the world's problems.

in the Soviet Union. Mates said.
In Yugoslavia "workers run the
affairs of the factories, which are
public property entrusted to
them."
lie said "we've borrowed much
from the Soviet Union in econom
ics and in many other respects.
But we've found that, as a perma
nent way of organizing the state,
the Soviet method is bad because
of the overwhelming role of the
state.
"As much as this system may
increase efficiency, it results in
the ultimate power of material
goods over human beings."
Mates said "Marx has helped us
solve our problems. His writings
ate very illuminating in studying
social development. But he didn't
show us the pattern of things to
come in the future."
Foreign Policy
Yugoslavia's internal develop
ment has naturally had an impor
tant effect on its foreign policy,
the ambassador said. "Necessari
ly, our national differences have
projected themselves on the inter
national outlook of the country."
Yugoslavia has had tense rela
tions with each of its surrounding
European' neighbors in the 10
years since the end of the war.
Mates called the Russo-Yugo'slav
dispute of 1948 "the greatest ten
sion short of war known in our
history."
But Yugoslavia is now on
friendly terms with all countries,
fie said. "We don't feel hostility
or tension toward any nation in
the world."
He said he is "convinced" his
country is "making progress in
foreign relations and helping to
solve the world's problems.


AMBASSADOR LEO MATES
In Yugoslavia, Postwar Poverty
Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States Leo Mates told a Cub
berley Auditorium audience yesterday that Yugoslavia at the end of
World War II faced an "even greater emergency" than that in the
preceding years of strife.
"It was the end of the shooting war," the ambassador said, "but it

was the beginning of a new war—
a war against poverty and desti
tution."
Mates, speaking on Yugoslav
ia's postwar development and for
eign policy, said his country's
first task after the war "was to
get the state going again—and
from this I mean to start from
scratch."
During the war, he said, Yugo
slavia's "liberators" divided the
country into seven occupation
zones and replaced all national in
stitutions with "Quisling institu
tions."
From the Bottom
The postwar return to national
rule required "complete reorgani
zation from the bottom in all
fields, which had to be accom
plished in a state of emergency
not unlike that in a country rav
aged by floods."
Because of this situation "con
siderable centralism had to be in
troduced, run on an emergency
basis."
Yugoslavia's goal in its postwar
reorganization, he said, was to
form a state "to serve its citizens,
not to make the citizens an annex
to state machinery."
Differs from Russia
The Yugoslav brand of collec
tive ownership differs from that
in the Soviet Union. Mates said.
In Yugoslavia "workers run the
affairs of the factories, which are
public property entrusted to
them."
lie said "we've borrowed much
from the Soviet Union in econom
ics and in many other respects.
