In most academic matters the Regents are
apparently carrying out their responsibilities
epiite well, for the University of California is
rightfully counted as one of the nation's lead
ing educational institutions.
However, in the field of practical political
education the Regents are woefully neglect in
their duties.
They insist on enforcement of a university
rule (Mule 17) which says, in effect, that both
>ides of any political or partisan issue must be
presented at any political meeting on campus.
The unrealistic approach to the problem of
political education taken by the Board in en
forcing this rule is evident. If nothing else, it
shows us at Stanford thai, though we rightfully
complain that our hwi against partisan activity
among students on campus is unreal, there are
programs which are even more unrealistic.
The Hoard of Regents must feel that (lal stu
dents have very weak and impressionable minds
indeed.
I hey are also worrying about the state legis
lature with its varying partisan pressures from
one side and then the other.
Hul the Roaid of Regents is forgetting to
worry about the only real thing il should he
within their province to worry about: Ihe (!al

I he following editorial from the Daily C.ali

about the unrealistic situation into which they
have been forced by Rule 17:
Gijttkral Sounds
It seems somewhat unfortunate that the man
who has received more votes than any Demo
cratic presidential candidate in history was
compelled to speak from a gutter yesterday.
Adlai Stevenson addressed more than 2000
students at Vt est <»ate—2ooo who stood on cam
pus while he spoke of academic freedom from
a rostrum on the edge of Oxford Street.
Although he himself may have been sincere,
his words were hypocritical in the utterance,
for academic freedom, in the broader sense,
doesn't exist on this campus.
Nor does it exist on any campus where stu
dents are denied an education in the field of
activities that will effect their future lives more
than anything else will.
Many students heard Stevenson speak at West
(»ate almost three times as many as can fit into
I lie largest lecture hall on campus. This number
speaks for itself in demonstrating the amount
of interest in political issues. The University,
of course, doesn't deny that students are in
terested in politics. It merely denies them the
right lo express and build a sound basis for that
interest.
Yesterday's main speaker made no mention
of University Rule 17. But we could not forget
it, and even laughed a little at it, as we stood
on the property of the Regents and listened to
an electronic voice from the "outside world."

In most academic matters the Regents are
apparently carrying out their responsibilities
epiite well, for the University of California is
rightfully counted as one of the nation's lead
ing educational institutions.
However, in the field of practical political
education the Regents are woefully neglect in
their duties.
They insist on enforcement of a university
rule (Mule 17) which says, in effect, that both
>ides of any political or partisan issue must be
presented at any political meeting on campus.
The unrealistic approach to the problem of
political education taken by the Board in en
forcing this rule is evident. If nothing else, it
shows us at Stanford thai, though we rightfully
complain that our hwi against partisan activity
among students on campus is unreal, there are
programs which are even more unrealistic.
The Hoard of Regents must feel that (lal stu

It seems somewhat unfortunate that the man
who has received more votes than any Demo
cratic presidential candidate in history was
compelled to speak from a gutter yesterday.
Adlai Stevenson addressed more than 2000
students at Vt est <»ate—2ooo who stood on cam
pus while he spoke of academic freedom from
a rostrum on the edge of Oxford Street.
Although he himself may have been sincere,
his words were hypocritical in the utterance,
for academic freedom, in the broader sense,
doesn't exist on this campus.
Nor does it exist on any campus where stu
dents are denied an education in the field of
activities that will effect their future lives more
than anything else will.
Many students heard Stevenson speak at West
(»ate almost three times as many as can fit into
I lie largest lecture hall on campus. This number
speaks for itself in demonstrating the amount
of interest in political issues. The University,
of course, doesn't deny that students are in
terested in politics. It merely denies them the
right lo express and build a sound basis for that
interest.
Yesterday's main speaker made no mention
of University Rule 17. But we could not forget
it, and even laughed a little at it, as we stood
on the property of the Regents and listened to
an electronic voice from the "outside world."
