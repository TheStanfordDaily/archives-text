Young GOP Stand
Editor, The Daily:
This is official clarification of the true stand
taken by the leadership of the Stanford Area
Young Republicans on the recently circulated re
call petition.
This recall petition which I have seen and been
asked to sign is a rather ill-considered, stupid and
puerile attempt at a retaliatory effort by several
of Stanford's imaginative students — three of
whom were on the condemned delegation to the
southland, three or four more were "disappointed"
with the efforts of LASSU on this women's hous
ing problem, and several others were apparently
just along for the ride.
I have met with the Executive board of the
Stanford Area Young Republicans and we defi
nitely feel that any action taken by any one or
more individuals within our organization must
have our official sanction to be a true representa
tion of the policy of the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans, and at no time was the policy-making
board of the organization contacted for considera
tion of this display of youthfully imaginative ex
uberance. We state now for the record that:
Our position on this recall petition is a definite
disassociation from and complete denial of any
responsibility for any part of the recall movement.
This means that at no time have we been involved
in the ill-considered, ill-starred and ill-fated recall
movement, and further, that any action taken by
any one or minority of our number on this issue
shall in no way be construed as any sort of policy
official or unofficial — of the Young Republi
cans.
This must be understood, for it is the aim of the
Stanford Area Young Republicans to engage only
i?i partisan political support of the Republican
< andidates for public office, and to provide an in
telligent program of political education in con
junction with all the social activity which makes
the whole program quite enjoyable. We do not
attempt to engage in intrigues of any sort, much
less any of the Capt. Midnight variety.
Anything we have done or will do will be proudly
admitted to. We have always operated completely
above-board and will continue to do so.
Such a half-baked attempt to recall the majority
of the honestly elected student representatives—
an attempt acknowledged by its instigators and
signatories to obviously fail if actually placed on
the ballot—shows precisely the same short-com-
in these instigators and signatories as they
claim exist in the legislators--i.e., immature, in
capable of considered judgement and unrestrained
In intelligent reflection. Our representatives have
riven us many hours of representation perhaps
not always to our liking, but that is the nature of
the l>east. We can't always win.
I personally feel that the original Poli-Union
censure was a crazy result of over-emotionalism
on the part of the Poli-Union ex-hoard, and once
done could not be retracted. My conversation with
several other members of that board seems to
bear this out. It didn't boost Poli-Union stock in
the free market. This is too bad.
I further feel that the LASSU condemnation was
too bad also, for my own information and con
science pointed to a complete dismissal of the
issue. But what's done is done, and if the whole
thing refuses to be forgotten, a petition requesting
revocation of legislative action and a reconsidera
tion of the issue would be in order.
Those people who initiated the petition and later
saw reason to withdraw same have no obligation
to continue a farcical production once they recon
sider for the good of the student community, as
they apparently have done. Congratulations.

President of the Stanford Area Young
Republicans, Vice-President of the
P6litieal Union
Editor's Note: Are you certain that all those
who signed the petitions "saw reason to with
draw"? Or was it just the sponsors of the pe
tition?

Not 'Not'
Editor, The Daily:
Due to an unfortunate error in the Monday
Daily, a "not" was inserted before the words "be
enabled" in my letter on the unjust condemnation
of a contesting delegation at USC Mock Conven
tion. The sentence should have read, "these par
tisan [political] bodies would be enabled to take
a major part in the convention."
Everett Kindig
Stanford and Apathy
Editor, The Daily:
It is widely recognized and greatly deplored by
every person conscious of the vital importance of
politics to the democratic way of life that there
exists today a terrible apathy on the part of a
great many citizens to political processes and the
personalities of our politicians.
Obviously one of the most important jobs for
all our educational institutions is to combat this
apathy in every possible way and to foster and
encourage political consciousness on the past oi
all students.
Why then was Stanford so completely indiffer
ent to Mr. Stevenson's whistle stop in Palo Alto?
| Last Tuesday | If The Daily had not carried an
announcement of the stop, the students would not
even have been aware of it. Here is a vital part
of the political scene being played right in Stan
ford's front yard, and there is not even official
recognition of the fact.
Stanford is a great educational institution. It
cannot live up to its responsibilities by ignoring
the vital realm of politics. The least that could be
expected in this case was an announcement in all
8, 9, and 10 o'clock classes of the event, and all
students encouraged to attend.
It will be argued that no university does such
things. Perhaps that is a contributing factor to
the present apathy toward politics. Political con
sciousness is not something separate and apart
to be taught like mathematics.
It is a fundamental element in the make up of
every citizen of a democracy. It must be taught
and fosterefT by all our educational institutions
from kindergarten to our graduate schools just
as integrity and moral responsibility are taught
and fostered in an all pervasive fashion.
This was a very convenient opportunity to take
politics out of the classroom (for those students
taking political science) and off the campus and
give all students an opportunity to see national
politics in action.
The event should have been given the recog
nition due it. We all deplore political apathy. Let
us make Stanford a leader in doing something
about it.

'Mysterious Contraption'
Editor, The Daily:
To clear up The Daily's confusion regarding the
"mysterious contraption" which appeared in Mon
day's front page expose: What your newsman
failed to ascertain was that this "mysterious con
traption" is not a mysterious contraption at all,
but a fountain spanner, designed and executed in
tubular steel by Tad Cody and friends.
What The Daily photographer witnessed was
the combined testing and dedication ceremony per
formed by three visiting professors of structure
from Harvard. The fountain-spanner was origin
ally designed as a tea-house, and after it was con
demned as a fountain-spanner it became, subse
quently, a space-spider and a pavilion for Con
Home publicity.
It is now on permanent display behind the archi
tecture buikiing where it has become a shrine and
place of retreat for bedevilled students of art and
architecture.
