## USC Students Injure Newsmen In Fraternity ‘Row Rioting’ 
### 
By Sally Trapnell
The University of Southern
California showed signs of the
seasonal ailment, spring fever,
last week, but with more seri
ous results than occur usually.
In their case, a fraternity
"row riot" was the result, in
which firecrackers, bottles and
beer cans were thrown, street
lamps were broken, a bonfire
was lighted and tomatoes and
eggs were tossed.
This might have ended up as
a back-page incident in 1..A.
papers except tliut the fun
wound up with some of the
hoys breaking two ribs of a
newspaper photographer who
was trying to find out what
the whole thing was about.
Police have refused to enter
the Row during future demon
strations unless absolutely ne
cessary to protect lives and
property.
Reason for this is that stu
dents have torn radio aerials
and searchlights off police cars
and slashed the ears' tires dur
ing previous rioting.

The PCC has been condemn
ed by the University of Wash
ington for its "sadistic" pun
ishment of banning the college
from the Rose Bowl.
A faculty representative ac
cused Time magazine of "slant
ing the news" in a recent story
011 the university. He said that
it was from such stories and
headlines alone that PCC had
made its decision.
He questioned the legality of
the imposed $52,000 fine and
suggested that the heavy pen

alty was leveled because Cali
fornia feared upcoming univer
sity football and basketball
teams.

The Florida Flambeau has
answered a suggestion made
last month by Harper's maga
zine that young women should
be drafted to teach in public
schools to solve the current
shortage.
"It should not be impossible
to work out a practical scheme
for drafting wo m e 11 college
graduates for a six -month
course in basic training for
teaching, plus 18 months' serv
ice in the schools.
"But we submit that the an
swer to the dfantic shortage of
teachers lies not in force of
persuasion hut in the elevation
of the teacher to the dignity he
should possess.
"Teachers' salaries may have
risen, but not in comparison
with those paid in other walks
of life. The teacher, according
to recent and exhaustive re
ports, occupies a less favorable
economic position than he did
some years ago.
Not only in wealth does ho
or she suffer. We treat our
teachers like glorified baby-sit
ters. And this type of treat
ment, this negligence in mat
ters of salary, is hardly calcu
lated to draw into the profes
sion those whom it needs."
To quote one of our profes
sors, "A teacher must want to
teach."
At Kansas State College's
mock national convention, the

group became so embroiled in
compromises between elephant
and donkey and male and fe
male that they ended up with
a somewhat unorthodox slate.
The team they plan to back
in the November elections is
Kstes Kefauver for President
and Clare Booth Luce for Veep.
At least, no one can accuse
tlieni of being partisan.

The University of Georgia's
Red and Black is the latest col

the school administration in a
battle for freedom of the press.
The newspaper was censored
for attacking the "obvious po
litical move" of changing tradi
tional Alumni Day from gradu
ation day to a time more con
venient with the political plans
of Herman Talmadge, current
alumni president.
"It is unfortunate that such
a political climate exists in this
state. Its evil manifestations
reach far; but. it should not
touch an institution dedicated
to higher learning and molding
future citizens," the Red and
Black challenged.
O #
lowa State students have hit
on a unique method of escap
ing ROTC drill. Each week the
class votes for one person to
come to drill in a torn and dirty
uniform.
The instructor is then so
busy figuring out demerits
that drill is temporarily for
gotten and sometimes altogeth
er omitted.
