# Spring Sing's 15-Year History Varied
## 
### 
In the spring of 1941, Tom How
ard decided that Rally Committee
should have a spring project, and
thus Spring Sing was born.
MoreMhan 3400 came to the
first sing, which the Chi Omegas
and the Medical School won. Med
School appeared in their impres
sive white coats singing "Fair
Stanford," an original hymn, and
thus began Iheir 15-year winning
streak.
The name "Spring Sing" was
not attached until postwar years.
In its earlier days "All-University
Sing" and later "Spring Song
fest" were its first lilies.
In 1945 it was a senior 'week
activity, and in '47 a street dance
behind Memorial Auditorium fol
lowed the Sing.
An early Spring Sing tradition
was a carillon concert as the
groups were assembling in Frost
Amphitheater. Unrehearsed com
munity singing was also a part of
the first showy.
During the war The Daily cau
tioned participants they would be
immediately notified in case of an
air raid or sudden blackout.

In 1947, Fred Waring played
"Come Join the Band" on his na
tional radio show in honor of the
Sing, and the Union Units girls
won in return by singing his ar
rangement of "In the Still of the
Night."
The match - lighting ceremony
was introduced in 1949, and Life
magazine featured the ceremony
in a 1950 issue. It has now become
a regular part of the event.
In 1953 the Alpha Delts man
aged to get the sweepstakes away
from Med School with their per
formance of "Abstracts from
American Cultural Themes"—an
assortment of beautifully render
ed singing commercials. The same
year the Delts and Guthrie made
history by "Singing in the Rain"
— literally. The shower began
with their number and stopped
shortly afterwards. "With help

from above," ihey won their di
vision, as the emcee put it.
Other traditions remain from
year to year—for instance, the
audience joining in "The Siar-
Spangled Banner" at the begin
ning of the Sing, and the last ap
pearance of the head cheer lead
er, leading the Alma Mater, at the
conclusion.
Defending champion in this
year's 15th Spring Sing is Roble
Hall, which won sweepstakes last
year for its performance of a
Gershwin medley.
In the under-40 division the
ATO's and Breakers-Ventura won
last year, and Kappa Sig-Adelpha-
Eucalypto took the 40-80 prize.
Med School took home its usual
award for the 80-plus division,
and the nurses reciprocated in
the women's division.
