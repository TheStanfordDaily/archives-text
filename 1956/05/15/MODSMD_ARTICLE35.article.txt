In a tune-up for Saturday's season wind-up against Cal, Stanford's
varsity baseball team will trot onto the Sunken Diamond greenery
today at 3:15 p.m. and host Fort Ord.
Ed Verdurmen and Walt Payne will divide the pitching. The In
dians will be seeking season's victory number 24 against nine losses

and one tie. Splitting the catching
duties, Coach "Dutch" Fehring
said, will be Ralph Holding and
Doug Camilli.
Steve Stuart may not hold down
the second-base spot today due to
an injured shoulder suffered last
Saturday against USC. Ready to
step in if needed is Bob Flanders,
until lately the Braves' hitting
star.
Saturday's contest with Cal will
decide second place in the Califor

hold second by a narrow Va-game
edge over the Bears. Game time
