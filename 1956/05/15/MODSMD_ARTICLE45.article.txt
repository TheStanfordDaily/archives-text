# Ralph, Freelen Travel North For Presidents' Convention
## 
### 
ASSU president George Ralph and president-elect Bob Freelen
traveled to Vancouver, 8.C., last week for the annual Pacific Stu
dent President's Association convention.
The purpose of the convention is to bring together old and new
student body presidents so the old presidents can help orient the
new ones, according to Ralph.
About 200 delegates from 68 Western colleges attended the con
vention. In order to discuss mutual problems more easily, the dele
gates into small discussion groups. Freelen said that a
report containing the compiled results of all the discussions will be
sent to those who attended the convention. This report will be
valuable because it will integrate the whole program of discussions,
Freelen said.
Freelen obtained many practical ideas from the discussions. One
of the most helpful sessions he attended dealt with planning a new
student union, a project Stanford is undertaking at present.
Another area about which Freelen received ideas concerned the
continuity of student government. He is going to present his ideas
on this subject to University officials.
Prominent Vancouver citizens spoke at the luncheons and dinners.
These speakers and the other Canadians Freelen met impressed him
with their alertness and enthusiasm, he said. He felt they were
"vibrating with optimism over Canada's future potential success."
Elected president of the Association for next year was Roy Free
man, incoming president of San Jose State. The convention will be
held at Arizona State College.
Ralph and Freelen's trip cost $180 and was financed by the ASSU.
