# UCLA Directive Goes Into Effect Despite Students
## 
### 
The UCLA administration's di
rective changing the student body
constitution has been put into ef
fect despite a special referendum
which defeated the move by a
vote of 2278 to 1360.
"The directive goes into effect
immediately," explained Richard
Hill, administrative assistant to
the dean of students.
"It is on the ballot just so we
can find out how students feel
about it."
Hill had predicted that the di
rective would be rejected by the
students. He denied that putting
it into effect in spite of possible
student protest would be undemo
cratic.
Students protesting the direc
tive claim that it would restrict
the operations of student govern
ment and would deny representa
tion to UCLA's 4000 graduate stu
den Is.
The new directive will remove
seven voting seats from the Stu
dent Legislative Council, includ
ing the graduate representatives.
This would necessitate a revision
of the ASUCLA constitution.
