# Temporary Buildings Get Paintbrush Going-Over
## Olive-Drab Structures Have Been Permanent University Fixtures for Past Ten Years 
### 
"I understand thoy are temporary buildings," said University Pres
ident Donald R. Tresidder 10 years ago, "but there is nothing more
permanent lhan a temporary building."
These temporary buildings, lying to the east of the Education Build
ing, have been quasi-permanent fictures for the past 10 years, but

yesterday their exterior, at least,
got the beginning of a going-over.
The University Corporation
Yard manned their brushes yester
day and the familiar olive drab of
the old metal buildings began to
disappear under a brand-new coat
of cream-colored paint.
The temporary character of
these buildings was stressed by
Frederick O. Glover, assistant to
President Wallace Sterling, who
said the buildings would be dis
posed to a more inauspicious lo
cation as soon as Eneina is refurn
ished.
The scheme of painting the
structures was hatched by Phi
»)elta Theta fraternity who, ac
cording to its president Jim Saras,
felt "fraternities should do some
thing to help the University."
The University had agreed to the
plan and purchased $300 worth of
paint for the project, but because
of the rain during the last few
.veeks and because the University
felt the project should be done be
fore the meeting of the alumni
this weekend, the University took
over the job.
