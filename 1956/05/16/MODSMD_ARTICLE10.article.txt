# Hughes Says African Crisis Center Is Egypt
## History Prof Believes France Must Negotiate With Algerian Rebels 
### 
The center of trouble in Africa
is Nasser and Cairo, said Stan
ford professor E. Stuart Hughes
last night, speaking to a Tuesday
Series audience last night.
France must try to negotiate
with Algeria, because the alterna
tive is a Cairo-oriented Algeria
where Frenchmen cannot live, he
explained.
Hughes' topic was "French Pol
itics and the North African Cris
is," but he termed it simply "The
French Crisis." This crisis is both
a domestic and colonial one.
In France twb elements have
formed a coalition during the
present government. But Edgar
Faure's group advocates standing
firm on colonial policy and con
tinuing the oppression now being
carried on in Algeria. Pierre Men
des-France favors conciliation be
tween the colonies and has given
Premier Guy Mollet a time limit
to settle the problem.
Dissatisfaction
"The Right and Left are united
in being dissatisfie d," said
Hughes. "But there is the danger
that the dissatisfaction of the Left
will enforce the dissatisfaction of
the Right and produce an explo
sion.
"Included in the Right is Pierre
Poujades' party, which is ultra
imperialist in regard to the colo
nies," continued Hughes.
Hughes explained that the dif
ference between Morocco, Tunisia
and Algeria was that France, in
theory, lias regarded Algeria as
part of France and not a colony.
But this is constitutional fiction,
according to him. Moslems are
governed like wards of the state.
Serious Problem
The problem is much more seri
ous than the Negro problem in
the United States, because pig
mentation is the only difference
in that case, the speaker said.
"The struggle has now reached
major proportions with the bulk
of the French army tied up in it."
The only possible U.S. view
point lies in the notion of Arab
states run by Arab leaders who
are willing to maintain some cul
tural ties to France which are
necessary to both, explained
Hughes.
His personal viewpoint on Al
geria is to have two nations and
two cultures living side by side
in an independent nation.
There is some hope for this,
Hughes concluded, if France will
begin negotiations with Algerian
nationalist leaders who have been
ignored up to this point.
