# Grad Complains Of Extortion In Letter to Knight
## 
### 
Graduate student Joseph E.
Carrier has written a letter com
plaining to Governor Knight that
the State Board of Equalization is
trying to "extort" a 3 per cent sales
tax on a Volkswagen he bought in
Maine two months before coming
to Stanford.
Carrier paid the 2 per cent Maine
sales tax but was billed $54 by
California as a "use tax."
Unjust Levy
He has been corresponding with
Board of Equalization officials for
several months, trying to persuade
them that the levy is unjust.
Carrier's request was rejected
in a recent letter from sales tax
administrator Harry L. Sary, who
said" Carrier's decision to attend
Stanford was pending before he
bought the car.
. . Since you did decide to at
tend Stanford and the vehicle was
brought here soon after its pur
chase, the use tax is properly
owing," Sary said.
Action Defended
George Reilly, first district
board member, defended the ac
tion.
"All we are doing," Reilly said,
"is administering the state law
which states that cars and other
property bought in other states
and brought into California are
subject to a 3 per cent use tax."
Reilly said most states have
similar laws. They are set up to
protect merchants in California
from competition in slates where
there is no sales tax or where the
tax is lower I Han 3 per cent.
"It's one of the oldest taxes we
hr've." Reilly said. "If we didn't
have il our merchants would lose
millions of dollars of business."
Carrier said many out of state
Stanford students who have regis
tered for California licenses have
encountered I he same problem.
