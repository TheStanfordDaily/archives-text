# Belgian Says Colonialism Matured Congo Natives
## Settlers Have Integrated African Inhabitants Into White Society from Rut of Environment 
### 
The natives of the Belgian Congo are being removed from the rut
of environment and more or less integrated into white society, ac
cording to Dr. J. A. Goris, director of the Belgian Information Bureau
for the United States.
Dr. Goris, speaking yesterday afternoon in Bowman Alumni House

on "Social and Economic Develop
ments in the Belgian Congo," said
the natives are taken from medi
ocre hut safe surroundings and
made into men who stand on their
own feet.
This change, he admitted, cre
ates a series of crises. "The na
tives have to learn in a short time
what our ancestors learned in
2000 years."
Dr. Goris emphasized that the
Belgians do not feel themselves
superior to the natives, and that
they have not exploited the coun
try for its vast mineral resources.
Improve Congo
He said the widespread belief
that the Congo made Belgium a
rich country is in error. "We
found that the only way to or
ganize a primitive country was to
extract its wealth and then give
it back to the country in improve
ments."
Belgium, he said, accepted the
Congo, which is 80 times the size
of the mother country, "with re
luctance." They found a chaotic
country full of hostile tribes, can
nibals and slave traders, and ruled
by cruel, tyrannical potentates.
Indirect Rule
The Belgians initiated a system
of indirect rule, he said, and left
natives in positions of power
whenever they could. "Eighty per
cent of the natives are ruled by
their own customs and their own
people."
"We have brought in our own
moral and intellectual values," he
said. "For the time being, we
know best and must teach them.
Our ideal is to elevate I hem so
that they can take their fate in
their own hands, but first they
must have a chance to prove their
talents."
Dr. Goris cited achievements
brought about under Belgian pro
tection. "One of the most pro
found revolutions we introduced,"
he said, "was the idea of the dig
nity of women."
