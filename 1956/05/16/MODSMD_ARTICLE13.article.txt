# Wilbur Freshmen Storm Toyon Hall
## 
### 
A couple of hundred Wilbur
freshmen fctormed Toyon Hall late
last night, but the storm fizzled as
spirits were dampened by retalia
tory waterbagging and sentinel
duty of Director Mrs. Dorothy C.
Loofbourow.
In ihe process of what one Stan
ford policeman termed "just going
crazy," the frosh: %
• Rallied at 11:30 p.m. in front
of Toyon with shouts of "(let the
sophomores!" (the Frosh ■ Soph
Jamboree is this weekend).
• Sent a Daily photographer
running for cover when they rush
ed toward him with threatening
shouts.
• Tossed a few firecrackers and
honked a few horns.
• Were the victims of water
tossed from Toyon windows and
of flashlight • commanding Mrs.
Loofbourow.
• Retired noisily to Wilbur at
midnight without much to show
for their exuberance.
