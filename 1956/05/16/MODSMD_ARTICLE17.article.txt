### 
EUGENE, Ore., May 15 (UP) —
Adlai Stevenson and Sen. Estes
Kefauver, campaigning for write
in votes in Oregon's primary elec
tion Friday, toured separate parts
of the state by air 1 today, di
recting criticism at the Eisen
hower Administration.
The two candidates for the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination
were to met face-to-face here to
night at 8:30 p.m. (PST) when
they speak at McArthur Court on
the University of Oregon campus.
They were not to debate but each
was to speak about 20 minutes.
Sen. Wayne Morse (D-Ore.), a
candidate for re-election this year,
was to introduce them.
Both seek support of Oregon's 16
delegates to the Democratic Na
tional Convention. Their names
will not be on the ballot.
Kefauver Drive
Kefauver, following Stevenson
into the state by more than a day,
opened his final Oregon drive in
Klamath Falls and then flew over
the Cascade Mountains to south
ern Oregon and northward to Eu
gene. Stevenson, who has been in
Oregon since Sunday night, flew
to Pendleton and The Dalles in
eastern Oregon today and will
speak in southern Oregon tomor
row before leaving the state.
Kefauver, at Medford, said he
would strive to improve Social Se
curity and old-age pension bene
fits should he be elected president.
He also said he would try to get
the eligibility age for women low
ered to 62.
Interior Dept.
At Klamath Falls, he said the
first act of the Democratic party
when it returns to power must be
to "clean out the Department of
Interior and return the custody of
the great national heritage which
it administers to the people."
Stevenson, in a talk at The
Dalles this afternoon, charged the
administration with being unwill
ing to make money available "for
public projects that would serve
the total public interest."
He said there was nothing wrong
in theory with the partnership
for power projects. "But there has
been a great deal wrong with the
way the Republicans have prac
ticed it,"he added. More often
than not, he said, "it has been an
excuse for putting off the con
struction of needed public power
facilities — or developing them to
only a fraction of their capacity
and thus wasting the great poten
tial that belongs to all the people."
