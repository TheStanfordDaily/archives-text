# Demo Candidate Harriman Calls for Bigger Natural Resource Developments
## N.Y. Governor Says Republicans Gave Away Hell's Canyon; Other Dam Sites Threatened 
### 
SPOKANE, May 15 (UP)â€”Gov. Averell Harriman, campaigning
in the power-hungry Pacific Northwest, called for "new vision" in
developing the nation's natural resources.
The New York governor, who earlier at Missoula, Mont., removed
all doubt that he is an active candidate for the Democratic Presiden-

tial nomination, said the Eisen
hower Administration sees "only
little plants."
He mentioned specifically that
the Republicans "have given away
Hell's Canyon" and have "given up
the fight" on Libby Dam in north
western Montana. He also said
full development of Paradise Dam
is "threatened."
Myth of Prosperity
"President Eisenhower talks of
prosperity but for many of out
people this is a # cruel myth," ho
said. "The farmer is having hard
times and small business is grow
ing weaker or being forced to quit.
"We Democrats want business
to prosper, large and small, hut
prosperity is not healthy if it is
not shared by all groups among
our people."
He said the "new type" Eisen
hower money policy puts another
squeeze on small business. "The
giant corporations have adequate
resources whereas the small busi
nessman and farmers who need
credit are having difficulty getting
it."
Ignored Aged
Speaking at a Democratic rally
earlier in Butte, Mont. Harriman
said Eisenhower and the GOP have
ignored "one of the great emerg
ing problems of our society the
need to make possible a more pro
ductive and fuller and richer life
for the aging."
The former ambassador to Rus
sia said the Soviets' reduction of
arms and military manpower was
an economic move to strengthen
Moscow's "new look" foreign pol
icy. America, he said, should not
reduce its armed forces "because
we have only a small fraction of
men under arms compared to the
Russians."
