# They Did Try

### 
Ol R I.ITTLE BROTHER ACROSS the street has done
il again; the Chaparral will hit the streets to
day. How he does it we'll never know —and
don't really care. But WHY he does it is beyond
us.
Anyway the Chappie is here, we're stuek with
it. Might as well read it.
This month they come on with the annual
Crash Comics(?). Actually this is the medium
in which the Chappies shine the best. We can't
think of a group with minds better fitted for the
writing of comics.

They Iry, oh how they try. They do try.
Give them credit for that at least.
Today's issue is filled with the usual unsuc
cessful tries, and the usual ties.
There is one inspiring strip for all the would
lie-journalists in the crowd—the magnificent
story of Mike Schmud, who gets his "Big Story,"
and of course there's "Hack," an editor of the
old school.
Any resemblance we're sure is purely inten
tional.
But little brothers will be that way at times.
And what the hell . . . they did try.
