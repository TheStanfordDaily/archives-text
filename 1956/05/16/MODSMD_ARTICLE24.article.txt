### HELEN DEWAR 
The symptoms have appeared, the fever has
struck, and now the nation is wrestling with
that intermittent but persistent malady known
as "election fever." •Ind unlike most diseases,
the patient loves it.
lu one camp anyway, election year '56 will
be one of the most intensified, vigorous and
dynamic the country has seen.
To combat the personal appeal of Eisenhower
mid tin' inertia of a complacent electorate lulled
by the apparent security of the past several
years, the Democratic candidate, whoever he
may be, will have to conduct an intensified per
sonal campaign, taking into consideration the
fact that personalities, not issues trill be para
mount and that he must reach the heart of the
voter through television, wliistle-stop tours,
sidewalk chats or ten-gallon hats and chaps.
lu the primaries, the pace has been set by the
amiable Kefauver who is at his best with the
folksy handshake. Stevenson, his succinct wit
shining better from the orator's platform, has
been forced a little awkwardly into what cam
paign managers consider a more productive
(vote-getting) role.
Most probably conducting a modified form
of the front-porch campaign, Eisenhower will
nestle back into relative seclusion from the elec
tion hassle, and from there attempt to smother
fury Democratic charges with vapid platitudes
ivhich he has become so dexterous in issuing.
The necessity of capturing the independent
and non-voting element will make television
and radio one of the key factors in the cam
paign.
The Republicans with their abundant financ
es and concern over the President's health may
concentrate on these media for reaching the
voter, putting the squeeze on the less well
financed Democrats who will feel the necessity
of meeting the GOP in radio and TV time.
TV makes politicians into actors, and Eisen
hower, still exuding the appealing qualities of
an amateur in politics, can charm his audience
with his boyish, eager mode of delivery, and.
scarcely be harmed by the fact that what he
says is little more than euphonious phraseology.
Democratic organization in '52 was poor, and
more attention has been given this year to pro
fessional, skilled management. Despite the ef
fective organization behind Stevenson and Ke
fauver, the "long wait" till August will leave the
Democrats far behind their opponents in a
concerted, cohesive campaign for one candidate,
especially if a dark horse should be chosen.
H hat to do with the reactionary Southern
faction in the party will be one of the perplex
ing problems the Democrats must face. The loss
of the Southern vote may throw the Presidency
to the Republicans, but there are many who
think its about time to clean house, for once
and for all.
The Democrats' forte will lie in pointing out
to the voter the laxity of the past Administra
tion in providing strong, united leadership and
the relatively stronger capacities of Democratic
leaders.
