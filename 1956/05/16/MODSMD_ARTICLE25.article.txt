# Political Strategists Put Their Brains to Work on '56 Campaign
## 
### JIM PALMER 
The all-seeing eye of television will be one of
the main tools of strategists in the 1956 cam
paign. How effectively it is employed will shape
the trend of votes on election day.
It trill be the key nutlet for President Eisen
hower's campaign, although it will not be the
only one. Present GOP strategy is to reach the
American voter with the on TV and Hick on the
political platform.
Meanwhile, grass roots organizations will
carry the load more than ever before in GDP
history. Citizens for Eisenhower-Nixon, Young
Republicans and women's groups will be highly
activated.
In the crucial congressional campaign, hope
ful candidates will have their pictures taken
alongside the President. Nixon will appear al
rallies in all parts of the country to boost the
local candidate's chances.
A big conference is now being organized in
Washington for all GOP congressional candi
dates from all parts of the country —especially
the marginal districts which were carried b\
either party in 1954 by five per cent or less of
the vote.
Cabinet members, Eisenhower and Nixon
will speak at this pow-wow, and all candidates
can have their pictures taken for hometown
consumption.
Coajt-tail riding of this sort may give the can
didate that extra boost needed to assure elec
tion. It depends, of course, on strength the can
didate has previously established on his own
merits.
The value of TV can easily be overestimated,
and there is danger in believing the President
can "get by" with just assorted TV appearances
throughout the campaign. Personal appear
ances on a conservative scale are definitely being
planned for the President. The degree of whirl
wind pressure will be. sharply reduced from
1052.
Over on the Democrat side, there is an aura
of hesitation as everyone awaits the selection of
a standard-bearer. This columnist has said be
fore (March 7) that Averell Harriman would
he the logical choice for the Democrats.
With Harriman as a candidate, Democratic
strategy would be molded by Carmine DeSapio
of Tammany Hall, ex-President Harry Truman
and former National Democratic Committee.
Chairman Frank E. McKinney of Indiana.
I bis means a give-'em-hell, fair-dealing type
of campaign, likely waged on the lowest levels
under the leadership of the above three.
Factors working against the Democrats this
year as far as campaign strategy include:
• No knowledge of who the candidate will
be until late August.
• Segmented grass roots organizations will
have to be united at a late date and will be far
behind the opposition.
• Congressional Democratic candidates will
have to rely on local appeal alone, and will have
to fight the national ties of Republican op
ponents.
It will take some pretty fast thinking for
Democrat strategists to make a race of it this
year.
