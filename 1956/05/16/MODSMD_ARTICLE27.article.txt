Hostel Success
Editor, The Daily:
Over the past four years I've developed a deep
and abiding love for Stanford. But every now and
again I'm amazed by the inspiring enthusiasm
shown by Stanford students and faculty over
something new and untried. Some Stanford stu
dents may be apathetic, but others more than
make up for it with their tremendous energy,
creativity and imagination.
It is a group of these others who have made
the Stanford hostel possible, and have made it
work. I feel everyone should know those who
have given this project their thought, time and
energy. Fifi Asaf Loutfi el Sayed from Egypt
thought of the idea and presented it to Werner
Warmbrunn, Foreign Student Adviser. He spoke
to Dick Lawson, president of lIR, and Dick ob
tained tentative use of Camp Monte Cristo from
Rev. Ralph A. Benson of the North Fair Oaks
Community Church.
The idea grew weekly in scope through discus
sions at the Off-Campus Men's and Women's
clubs and at the Community Committee for For
eign Student's' luncheons. Geoff Newcomb and
Eric Miller put in many hours working on the
schedule, budget and menu. Financially, incident
ally, the program ended in the black. George
Ralph and Bill Tooley gave the project ASSU
backing, and Nate Lcanse gave it Cardinals spon
sorship.
Everywhere among student body and faculty
there has been immense enthusiasm and interest.
Important ideas concerning the administration,
programming and policy of the Stanford hostel
were contributed by Prof. James T. Watkins IV
of Political Science, Dean Carl B. Spaeth of the
Law School, Dean of Students Hugh I). Winbig
ler, Prof. Harry J. Rathbun of the Law School,
Chaplain Robert M. Minto, Assistant Chaplain
David H. Romeis, Foreign Students Adviser Wer
ner Warmbrunn, A 1 Brouse of Political Science
and many, many others.
One pVofessor said, "You'll never get kids out
there unless you talk about religion, sex or poli
tics." He was right. The program did have a
greater and more universal appeal, and the aver
age turnout was 31 students per weekend.
All the professors and students who partici
pated in the hostel discussions were positively

impressed and felt such an institution would be
of permanent value to Stanford.
It is hoped that enough student enthusiasm
will be shown next year to show the administra
tion that there is need for a permanent facility
on the Stanford campus. This should be decided
at this time, while it can still be included in the
Master Land Development Plan. Plans have al
ready been discussed ASSU and Cardinals
officers to have a funds drive devoted to making
such a permanent facility possible.
If Stanford is to have the use of some of its
own rural land for the use of its own students
(as Sen. and Mrs. Stanford would have wanted),
now is the time for the students to make their
desires known. If we are to have our own hostel
on Stanford land, near Searsville Lake, we'd bet
ter speak up now. It's unlikely we'll have another
chance, for it won't be long before Palo Alto
grows up and over Skyline Blvd.

'To Hell with '58'
Editor, The Daily:
This is to intorm each and every sophomore
that they will not have the slightest chance of
winning in Ihe freshman-sophomore jamboree.
Not only do the members of the Class of '58 brag
beyond reason of their athletic prowess, but the
sophomore women do not deserve the right of
being classified as females. I have the suspicion
that the sophomore women may well outdo the
sophomore men, judging from what I have seen
of their masculine features. If anything ap
proaches the third sex, they do.
They won last year! What a laugh! Could it
be that they hedged a bit on points, or was it that
'57 was even weaker than they are? If we in
vestigate the incident, I am sure that we would
uncover a giant hoax. .
The freshmen this year have athletes of col
legiate ability. I seriously think that it would be
better for the sophomores if they were to concede
the whole event to the Class of '59.
I would also like to offer the suggestion that
the Class of '59 compete with high school sopho
mores. It would be more fun that way--and the
women would be more mature.
Tough luck, sophomores.
