# A 						Campus-to-Career Case History
## "There's opportunity in a growing company" 
### 
As an Engineer in the Transmission
Sectimi of Hell Telephone Company of
Pennsylvania, Richard M. Walsh plans
for the future.
"Our group'9 responsibility," says
Dick, "is to see that we have sufficient
facilities to handle present and future
needs. Telephone usage is growing every
year, and we keep up with this growth
by keeping ahead of it.
"For instance, to meet the increasing
demand for communication circuits in
our area, we're adding 70,000 new c han
nel miles this year alone, at a cost of
$3,500,000. Laying new ca bio will give
us 40.000 of those channel miles, and
we'll get the other 30.000 through use of
carrier equipment, which lets us send a

number of long distance rails on each
pair of wires simultaneously.
"Thus, though a cable might have only
300 pairs of wires, we can. with carrier,
make it carry over 3000 telephone rails
at one time. Using carrier equipment to
get extra circuits out of cable —which is
expensive to make and lay—is an example
of how we engineer to give high-grade
service at tlie lowest possible rost.
"Refore 1 graduated from college I had
interviews with twenty-eight companies.
Out of all these 1 chose the telephone
company berause it had (lie most t<» offer
in the wry of interesting work, training
and opportunity. This certainly turned
out to be true. In a growing business
your opportunities grow, loo."
