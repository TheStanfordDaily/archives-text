should be an easy winner in the
one and three meter diving.

of breaking both the 50-yard and
100-yard freestyle marks. Last
Saturday in a meet against Cal,
Moore set a new PCC record in
both events. He also broke the
existing world standard in the
100-yard distance while swimming
the anchor lap on the relay team.
However, this, being in a relay,
cannot officially count as a rec
ord breaker.

erman and Phil Gay and Cal's

200-yard breaststroke. Only Bob
Hughes of SC has a best time
near Wilbur's tops.
Other Stanford point-getters
will be Tom Burton in the 440-
yard freestyle, Ron Grunt in both
backstroke events and the Indi
ans' 440-yard freestyle relay team.

Thrilling individual races and a
tight team battle between Stan
ford's Indians and USC will fea
ture the annual Pacific Coast Con
ference, Southern Division, swim
ming championships in Encina
Pools this weekend.
There will be no admission
charge for any of the events which
will take place on Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday.
The only event on opening day
will be the 1500 meter race start
ing at 4 p.m. On Friday and Sat
urday trials will begin at 10 a.m.
and the finals at 3 p.m.
Individual stars of the four com
peting schools Stanford, South
ern California, Cal and UCLA—
are so evenly matched that only
three races are figured to have
cinch winners.
Moore Favorite
Robin Moore, the Stanford flash
and NCAA 50 yard champion, is a
heavy favorite in both the 50 and
100 yard free style events. Dick
Connor of Southern California
should be an easy winner in the
one and three meter diving.
At least six of the competitors
in the Southern Division meet are
considered as candidates for the
American Olympic Team — Bob
Hughes and Jim Stevenson of
Southern California; Don Rosen
thal of UCLA; and Stanford's Big
Three of Robin Moore, Colburn
Wilbur and Tad Devine.
Several Southern Division rec
ords are in jeopardy and two or
three probably will fall.
Robin Moore has a good chance
of breaking both the 50-yard and
100-yard freestyle marks. Last
Saturday in a meet against Cal,
Moore set a new PCC record in
both events. He also broke the
existing world standard in the
100-yard distance while swimming
the anchor lap on the relay team.
However, this, being in a relay,
cannot officially count as a rec
ord breaker.
