# Bray Too Much? Try a Lobotomy
## 
### 
"To bray or not to bray?"
Picaro brays too much. At
least, that's what his neighbors
say. Picaro, being a donkey,
was not available for comment.
However, bis veterinarian, Dr.
Louis Johnson of Sacramento,
plans to quiet Picaro's nerves —
and his braying —with a brain
operation.
Picaro has not given his ion
sent yet, but his owner, 12-year
old Ruth Ann Fugett, apparent
ly agrees with the doctor.
T her e's been no comment
from the neighbors over the
proposed operation. All indica
tions are that lh<»y are "hope-
In I" for its success.
