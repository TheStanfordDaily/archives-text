# PCC Trackmen In Final Meet This Weekend
## Defending Champion Southern California Is Favored Again 
### 
Stanford's track squad will
journey to Cal's Edwards Field
this Saturday to join with the
other eight members of the Pa
cific Coast Conference in the an
nual PCC final meet.
Defending national champion
USC will undoubtedly be favored
to capture the league crown. How
ever, several other schools should
be well represented in the scor
ing, especially UCLA and Oregon.
Among the top attractions of
the meet will be the duel in the
mile run between Oregon's Jim
Bailey, the man who beat John
Landy in America's first four
minute mile, and Bobby Seaman
of UCLA. This pair could possibly
run very near the four-minute
mark.
Stanford men who should score
will include the sophomore dis
tance ace Maury Graves, who will
enter the mile or the two-mile. He
may. run in both events. Broad
jumper Frank Hermann, defend
ing league champion, should put
up a good fight to -retain his
championship. His chief competi
tion will come from UCLA's all
around track man Rafer Johnson.
Pole-vaulter Bill Flint, who has
cleared 14 feet, could anrrex a first
in this event. His competitors will
include Lindy Kell of UCLA and
USC's Walt Levak.
Sprinter Jim Saras and shot
putter A 1 Chaney probably will
rank in the final results.
UCLA's 1 one - man track team,
Rafer Johnson, will be hard to
beat in both hurdles races as well
as starring jn the broad jump.
Beside the chance for a new in
tercollegiate record in the mile,
Cal's splendid 1 sprinter Leamon
King will give the world's record
for the 100-yarcf dash a good fight.
In last Saturday's West Coast Re
lays, King tied the world mark of
9.3 seconds, but he may be slowed
up this week because of a lack of
close competition.
