# Card Nine Shuts Out Fort Ord; Fletcher Bat Star with 3 Hits
## Stanford Closes Home Season with 23rd Win; Walt Payne, Ed Verdurmen Hurl Four-Hitter 
### 
Bob Fletcher rapped out three
hits and scored three runs as the
Varsity baseballers closed out
their home season by blanking
the Fort Ord Warriors on the
four-hit pitching of Walt Payne
and Ed Verdurmen.
For the Indians it was their
23rd victory in 32 games. The vis
iting Army team was defeated for
the sixth time this year. They
have won 19 times.
Fletcher was practically a one
man show in the loosely-played
contest. Besides his three singles,
Bob drew a walk and swiped two
bases. Every starter in the local
lineup got at least one hit, includ
ing pitcher Payne.
Payne hurled ihe first six in
nings and was never seriously in
trouble until his final inning,
when he permitted his only three
walks. However, he got out of the
frame without being scored on.
The Warriors boomed a triple
to right field to threaten in the
fourth stanza, but two were out
and the side was safely retired.
While Payne was chalking up his
seventh win of the campaign, he
struck out three and walked
three.
Reliever Ed Verdurmen wasn't
particularly effective, but the
Fort Ord nine still didn't score.
After the Cards had racked up the
9-0 lead, Coach Dutch Fehring
substituted freely.
It was Ralph Holding's two
base hit which sparked the first
of the Indians' two four-run out
breaks. Two runners raced in on

the hit. Bob Evans, co-captain and
outfielder, also contributed a dou
ble to the 13-hit attack.
In the fifth inning it was husky
first-baseman Hal Messner who
supplied the big stick. With the
bases full of Indians, Messner
slappod a single to score a pair.
Shortstop. Steve Stewart, who
was expected to miss the contest
because of an injury to his shoul
der, appeared for six chapters and
got one hit.

It was Ralph Holding's two
base hit which sparked the first
of the Indians' two four-run out
breaks. Two runners raced in on

the hit. Bob Evans, co-captain and
outfielder, also contributed a dou
ble to the 13-hit attack.
In the fifth inning it was husky
first-baseman Hal Messner who
supplied the big stick. With the
bases full of Indians, Messner
slappod a single to score a pair.
Shortstop. Steve Stewart, who
was expected to miss the contest
because of an injury to his shoul
der, appeared for six chapters and
got one hit.

Verdurmen and Holding, Camilli.


A DOUBLE PLAY is in the making: as shortstop Steve Stewart
pivots and throws to first base (luring yesterday's 9-0 baseball win
over the Fort Ord Warriors. The Indians made two twin-killings as
they belted out their 23rd win in the season's final home game. The
locals meet C'al in Berkeley in the final game Saturday.
Bob Fletcher rapped out three
hits and scored three runs as the
Varsity baseballers closed out
their home season by blanking
the Fort Ord Warriors on the
four-hit pitching of Walt Payne
and Ed Verdurmen.
For the Indians it was their
23rd victory in 32 games. The vis
iting Army team was defeated for
the sixth time this year. They
have won 19 times.
Fletcher was practically a one
man show in the loosely-played
contest. Besides his three singles,
Bob drew a walk and swiped two
bases. Every starter in the local
lineup got at least one hit, includ
ing pitcher Payne.
Payne hurled ihe first six in
nings and was never seriously in
trouble until his final inning,
when he permitted his only three
walks. However, he got out of the
frame without being scored on.
The Warriors boomed a triple
to right field to threaten in the
fourth stanza, but two were out
and the side was safely retired.
While Payne was chalking up his
seventh win of the campaign, he
struck out three and walked
three.
Reliever Ed Verdurmen wasn't
particularly effective, but the
Fort Ord nine still didn't score.
After the Cards had racked up the
9-0 lead, Coach Dutch Fehring
substituted freely.
