# ATOM SMASHER
## Physics Lab Will Enlarge Accelerator 
### 
Expansion of the W. W. Hansen
Laboratories of Physics here will
enable scientists to make the
world's biggest linear electron ac
celerator even bigger.
University trustees have ap
propriated $45,000 for additional
office and shop space in a new
wing to be added to the Microwave
Laboratory, one of the two Han
sen Laboratories buildings. This
will nearly double the present size
of the laboratory .
Completion of the wing, which
is hoped for by early 1957, will free
space in the High-Energy Labora
tory where the 200-foot Mark 111
linear accelerator is located. Then,
after other plans for remodeling
the huge atom "smasher are suc
cessfully eompleted, the scientists
intend to use the extra space to
add 40 feet to its length.
These changes are expected to
increase the accelerator's output
of energy by at least 200,000,000
electron volts, which will greatly
improve its usefulness in nuclear
research. The higher the energy
of the electrons it accelerates, the
finer the details they can "see" in
the nucleus of the atom.
The higher energy electron
beam therefore would lend greater
precision to electron scattering ex
periments now in progress, the
physicists said. It also might pro
duce more and heavier mesons dur
ing bombardment of the nucleus.
