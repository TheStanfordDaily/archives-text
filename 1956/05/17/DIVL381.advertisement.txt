THE TRUE AND TYPICAL CASE <>1
CHATSWORTH OSCEOLA
The school year draws to an end, and everybody is
wondering about the future—everybody, that is, except the
engineers. Today there is not a single engineer on a single
campus who has not received a dozen fabulous offers from
a dozen corporations.
All this, of course, you know. But do you know just how
fabulous these offers are? Do you have any idea how wildly
the corporations are competing? Let me cite for you the true
and typical case of Chatsworth Osceola, a true and typical
senior.
Chatsworth, walking across the M.I.T. campus one
day last week, was hailed by a man parked at the curb in a
yellow convertible studded with precious gemstones. "Hello,"
said the man. "I am Darien T. Sigafoos of the Sigafoos Rear
ing and Bushing Company. Do you like this car?"
"Yeah, hey,*' said Chatsworth.
"It's yours," said Sigafoos.
"Thanks, hey," said Chatsworth.
"Do»you like Philip Morris?" said Sigafoos.
"Of corris!" said Chatsworth.
"Here is a pack," said Sigafoos. "And a new pack will be
delivered to you at six-hour intervals every day as long as
you shall live."
"Thanks, hey," said Chatsworth.
"Does your wife like Philip Morris?" said Sigafoos.
"I'm not married," said Chatsworth.
"Do you want to be?" said Sigafoos.
"What American boy doesn't?" said Chatsworth.

Sigaf«os pressed a button on the dashboard of the
convertible, and the trunk opened up, and out came a nubile
maiden with golden hair, flawless features, a perfect disposi
tion, and the appendix already removed. "This is Laurel
Geduldig," said Sigafoos. "Would you like to marry her?"
"Is her appendix out?" said Chatsworth.
"Yes," said Sigafoos.
"Okay," said Chatsworth.
"Congratulations," said Sigafoos. "And for the happy
bride, a pack of Philip Morris every six hours for the rest
of her life."
"Thanks, hey," said Laurel.
"Now then," said Sigafoos to Chatsworth, "let's get down
to business. My company will start you at $45,000 a year.
You will retire at full salary upon reaching the age of 28.
When you start work, we will give you a three-story house
made of bullion, complete with a French Provincial swimming
pool. We will provide sitter service for all your children
until they are safely through puberty. We will guarantee to
keep your teeth in good repair; also the teeth of your wife
and children unto the third generation. We will send your
dentist a pack of Philip Morris.every six hours as long as
he shall live.... Now, son, think carefully about this offer.
Meanwhile, here is one thousand dollars in small, unmarked
bills, which places you under no obligation whatsoever."
"It certainly seems like a fair offer," said Chatsworth.
"But there is something you should know. I am not an en
gineer. In fact, I don't go to M.I.T. I am a poetry major
at Harvard. I just came over here on a bird walk."
"Oh," said Sigafoos.
"1 guess I don't get to keep this money and the convertible
and Laurel now, do I?" said Chatsworth.
"Of course you do," said Sigafoos. "And if you'd like the
job, my offer still stands. ©Mux Shulman, 19& C
