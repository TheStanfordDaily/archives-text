best timing and most coordinated
synchronized swimming.
Skillful Solo

ductor" presented a ballet num
ber composed of many difficult
stunts, all of which were executed
with remarkable skill and finesse.

was cleverly comic if slightly dis
organized. "Three Notes," swum
by Beverly Camp. Gail Kirkman
and Marjorie Madison was anoth
er faintly comic water ballet in
terpretation.
Graceful Duo
Smooth, graceful swimming
combined with unusual compos
ure and presence gave the "Blue
Bass" rluet a look of ease that is
difficult to achieve in ;in intricate
number. Joanne and Karen Al
brecht proved themselves capable
and poised in choreography and
execution.
Simplicity keynoted the "Swym
phony" finale. Directed by the
Swim Club show chairman Mary
linda Wheeler and Joy Engle, the
1(5 girls swam with remarkable
precision, using refreshing modi
fied strokes.

The show was plagued with the
usual first-night mishaps, mainly
flue to mistaken musical cues.
Aside from a preponderance of
If'ggy stunts and occasional rag
ged swimming, the show was ef
fective in its simplicity and inter
pretive accuracy.

Bass" rluet a look of ease that is
difficult to achieve in ;in intricate
number. Joanne and Karen Al
brecht proved themselves capable
and poised in choreography and
execution.

"Harmony in music, motion and color in water" was the partially
realized aim of the Stanford Swim Club's annual show last night.
"Swymphony" will he presented again tonight at the Women's Pool
at 8:30.
Outstanding choreography and simple, effective costuming were

coupled with some smooth and
some ragged swimming to make
the water ballet show rather un
even.
Of the large group numbers,
the "Strings," directed by Joanne
and Karen Albrecht, displayed the
best timing and most coordinated
synchronized swimming.
Skillful Solo
Soloist Sue Brady as the "Con
ductor" presented a ballet num
ber composed of many difficult
stunts, all of which were executed
with remarkable skill and finesse.
"Woodwinds," a novelty num
ber swum to Dixieland jazz music,
was cleverly comic if slightly dis
organized. "Three Notes," swum
by Beverly Camp. Gail Kirkman
and Marjorie Madison was anoth
er faintly comic water ballet in
terpretation.
Graceful Duo
Smooth, graceful swimming
combined with unusual compos
ure and presence gave the "Blue
Bass" rluet a look of ease that is
difficult to achieve in ;in intricate
number. Joanne and Karen Al
brecht proved themselves capable
and poised in choreography and
execution.
