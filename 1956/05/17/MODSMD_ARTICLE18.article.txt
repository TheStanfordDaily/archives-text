# "We're Agreed, Thenâ€”-The Supreme Court Is Unconstitutional"
## The 						Judicial 'Experts' 
### 
The reactionary Mr. McCarthy has not yet
vanished from the American political scene
which he once so ruthlessly tried to rule. Now
he has allied himself with that narrowest of
minds from Mississippi, Senator James (). East
land, among others.
lit association with his new bedfellows the
Wisconsin solon, who would save the United
States from itself, has declared Supreme Court
members have acted as "politicians instead of
lawyers who seek to pass laws instead of in
terpreting them."
McCarthy says the justices "just don't know
what they are doing." Perhaps they don't. All
Chief Justice Warren and his associates have
done is to presume that the laws of tlte United
States all stem from a constitution which prom
ises equality for all.
These latest mutterings from McCarthy and
new friends came in a Senate internal security
meeting which was holding bearing on bills
which would, in effect, nullify recent Supreme
Court rulings and restore states the power to

enforce their own sedition laws in regard to
subversive activities.
We have always been under the impression
that such sedition was a crime against all the
people of the United States, in whatever state
the crime happened to be connnitteed.
But McCarthy, Eastland and company, the
self-styled judicial experts, think otherwise.
Think of subversion hearings in the hands of
narrow-minds of the likes of McCarthy or East
land.
"Subversion" would once again be judged as
to the degrc-e of nonconformity to their extreme
dictates.
We would once more find ourselves in the
hands of the self-seekers who would punish
"sedition"' to further either themselves or their
home state, not to benefit the people of the
United States as a whole.
Besides, at this moment the only "protection"
we seem to need is from the likes of McCarthy
and his newly-found partners.
