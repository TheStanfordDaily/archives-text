## 'Sentiment and Altruism' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have just seen your account of the Carl B.
Spaeth Fellowship in Physical Medicine and I
wish to correct a few impressions that your article
may have left with some of its not too observant
readers.
In the first place, the faculty members of Stan
ford's finest school are not body-snatchers. In
fact they regard the human body as sacred and
devote their lives to the study of keeping this body
intact and in good health.
Secondly, it was said that our faculty plans to
crush, annihilate, scrunch and generally ruin the
faculty of the School of Law. 1 am sure Dr.
Spaeth's many friends who so gladly contributed
to the Carl B. Spaeth Fellowship would resent this
interpretation of their action.
Even a cynical editor would have been touched
if he had seen the tears in the eyes of hard-headed
businessmen, penniless professors, struggling
writers, etc. who so willingly contributed to the
Fellowship. A prominent trustee of this Univer
sity, sick abed in the Maternity Department of
Stanford Hospital arose, despite the frantic ap
peals of his doctors, to tender his gift in honor of
the Dean of the Law School.
Finally you implied that Frank Tatum, Rhodes
Scholar, formerly Assistant Dean of the Stanford
Law School, a power for the right in the life of
San Francisco, has been chosen for the honor
merely because of his golfing ability. A position
on the faculty of this Institution is a mark of
honor among all men and we feel that Frank Ta
tum, Jr., is worthy of that honor.
Let not youthful cynics and skeptics scoff at
sentiment and altruism as displayed by their
elders.
CÂ«. B. Robsnn, >1.1).
