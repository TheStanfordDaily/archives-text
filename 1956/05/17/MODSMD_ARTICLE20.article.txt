Editor, The Daily:
The amount of comment, and I must sny criti

cism, that has come to my attention since your
coverage of the forthcoming annual Medical
School-Law School Faculty Golf Match in your
issue of Friday, May 11, moves me to write to set
the record straight.
In the circumstances, comments such as "dis
loyal," "chicanery," "proselytism" and the like
(some unprintable) have disturbed me deeply.
It is my understanding that the faculty of the
Medical School was moved to promote the estab
lishment of the "Carl 13. Spaeth Fellowship in
Physical Mcdicine," by the feeling that Dean
Spaeth's contribution to Stanford and particularly
to the relationship between the Law School and
the Medical School faculties called for suitable
recognition. This background was emphasized to
me at the time I received notification of my ap
pointment as the first Carl B. Spaeth fellow in
Physical Medicine.
I am—or at least I was—a personal friend of
Dean Spaeth. I share the regard that the Medi
cal School faculty has for him, as it has been ex
pressed to me. I considered it a signal honor,
therefore, to have been nominated not only as a
fellow but the first fellow to enjoy this fellow
ship. It was in this spirit that my nomination was
made and accepted. Accordingly, it is most dis
turbing to have it misconstrued.
I have been advised that there is some sort of
golf match between the two faculties scheduled
for some time this month. The Medical School
very kindly has invited me to play, in order that
I might get to know some of my faculty members
better in an atmosphere of convivial sportsman
ship. In the circumstances, I could hardly refuse
to accept such an invitation.
I trust that this letter will help minimize the
misconstruction of your coverage of this matter.
In any event, I sincerely hope I can justify an
honor that has been accorded me.
