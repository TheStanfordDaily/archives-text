Eighty hashing jobs are cur
rently set aside by the Univer
sity for the specific use of stu
dents competing in athletics.
This leaves 80 fewer hashing
jobs for the use of non-athletic,
but often just as needy, stu
dents.
Many believe that it would
be fairer to give all hashing
jobs on the basis of need rather
than partially on the basis of
activity. It is thought that the
policy amounts to little more
than a form of athletic subsidi
zation.
Some Stanford students have
this to say:
Joel Mog-y, '59, Stern: "I
think the present policy should
continue. Hashing affords an
opportunity for an athlete to
help pay his way through col
lege. Due to the nature of ath
letics, an athlete must some
time engage in sports out of
town. If he tried to hold a reg
ular job, he would soon lose it
because of absenteeism. This is
taken into account when he is
offered a hashing job."
Clare Flarerty, '57, Guthrie:
"All things being equal, I think
it is all right for a certain per
centage of hashing jobs to be
reserved for athletes. However 1 ,
I think scholastic ability should
be considered before athletic
ability."
.Joan Carlson, '59, Branner:
"People come to Stanford pri
marily for an education rather
than for athletics. On this ba
sis, I don't see any reason for
athletes to be given preference
over students in more need."
Norman Ellis, '57, off cam
pus: "If athletes now hashing
had to work off campus, they
would be unable to maintain
even a 'C' average and continue
with sports. I think this is an
excellent way to subsidize ath
letics."
Betty Jacobsen, '59, Branner:
"I think hashing jobs should
be given on the basis of need
before all other considerations.
Since Stanford considers itself
an educational institution, it
should not give preference of
this sort to athletes."
Jan Winkler, '57, Guthrie: "It
is fair because the school needs
men for a well-rounded athletic
program in comparison to oth
er universities.

"Stanford furnishes little
other financial aid to athletes
beside scholarships. If it were
not for the hashing jobs, finan
cially restricted men would
have to find outside jobs which
would be more time-consuming
and would cut down on their
already limited study time."
Scott Bowersock, '58, Stern:
"i think it should remain like
it is. Since athletics bring mon
ey to the University, and since
athletes are part of this, they*
should get some of the re
turns."
Bobbie Herrmann, '59, Bran
.ner: "If the athletes are actu
ally capable of Stanford work,
and definitely want a Stanford
education, I don't see any rea
son why they shouldn't have
the hashing jobs. But I defi
nitely don't think it's fair if
they are chosen and given the
jobs just because they will give
us a better football team."
Nancy Beard, '59, Branner:
"No. In all fairness, if we hold
jobs for athletes, we should
hold Ihem as well for student
body officers, committee heads,
debaters, and the like. They
work, too, to bring recognition
to the school and to get satis
faction for themselves."
Anne Cooley, '59, Branner:
"It's fine for them to have
hashing jobs if the University
accepted them in the first place
with the same qualifications as
anyone else and if they have
sufficient need.
"Personally, I have respect
for any athlete who can qual
ify for Stanford in the first
place and is able to keep up a
good grade average, work for
most of his money and partici
pate successfully in sportsâ€”all
at the same time. Yes, they
should be given a job, because
there are a sufficient number
of jobs here at Stanford for
anyone who wants one badly
enough to look for it."
Tina Bailey, '59, Branner:
"No, I don't think athletes
should be given priority for
hashing jobs. Certainly they,
no more than any other stu
dents who need financial help,
deserve to be handed a job by
the University. Put hashing on
a competitive basis, and when
the hashing jobs are filled, let
athletes and non-athletes try
elsewhere."
