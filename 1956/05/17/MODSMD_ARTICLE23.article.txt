# Too Much Fuel Causes Plane Crash After Delayed Landing
## 
### 
OTTAWA,. May 1G (UP)—The
pilot of a Royal Canadian Air
Force jet was trying to burn up
excess fuel when his rocket-laden
plane erupted in flames and plun
ged like a meteor into a rest home
for nuns, killing 15 persons, De
fense Minister Ralph Campney
disclosed today.
The supersonic jet, returning
from an interceptor mission, had
radioed its base that it would re
main aloft for some time because
its fuel load was too heavy for a
safe landing, Campney said.
The message went out just min
utes before the CF-100 went into
a screaming nosedive of nearly
six miles and slammed into the
living quarters of the rambling
villa St. Louis where 33 gray sis
ters of the Cross lay sleeping last
night.
Eleven n un s were killed. A
priest, a woman cook and the
plane's two crewmen also died in
the flaming inferno that left only
a shell of the sedate gray stone
building built only two years ago
in the quiet community of Hia

watha Park, eight miles east of
here.
Campney, addressing the House
of Commons, said the Air Force
had not been able to determine
what caused the crash. But he
said the plane apparently went
into an almost perpendicular nose
dive from 33,000 feet.
The Defense Minister said the
crash seemed to prove that "man's
mastery of machines can never be
complete" despite modern ingenu
ity.
An RCAF investigator at the
scene said "we might never know
for sure" what caused the plane
to burst into flame and hurtle to
the ground.
Air Force personnel and police
teamed together in the grim day
long search for bodies in the char
red rubble.
