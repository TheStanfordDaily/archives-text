# Pacific Coast Conference Swim Meet Begins This Afternoon in Encina Pool
## Burton and Devine Favored in Opening Race Here Today 
### John Weiser 
Action for the PCC champion
ship swim meet gets under way
today at â€¢! p.m. with the finals of
the 1500-meter freestyle.
An entry field of nine swim
mers will compete in two consecu
tive heats to be conducted upon a
time basis.
Swimming the race for Stan
ford will be Tom Burton and Tad
Devine. Both these men are seed
ed the fastest in the conference,
with the time of 20 minutes flat.
According to Coach Tom Maynie,
the finish for the event should be
unusually close as Burton and De
vine have consistently hit identi
cal times for all distances above
1000 yards.
The conference record for tlie
event is held by Stanford's Dan
Osborne in the time of 19:075.
However, as shown by season per
formances to this date, there is
not much likelihood of the mark
being lowered.
Competition
Ho t t e s t competition for the
Cai'ds will come from SC's Ron
Severa and California's Cliff llu
bach, both of whom are close to
the registered 20 minutes by De
vine and Burton.
During the first 500 yards of
the event Coach Hayne has ad
vised his milers to utilize the spe
cial "turn of terror," where the
swimmer exerts a special kick at
the wall enabling him to gain two
to three feet over conventional
ists. As this technique requires
considerable effort, Haynie has
not suggested that it be used for
the final 1100 yards of the race.
Olympic Event,
The distance of 1500 meters is
an official Olympic event which is
swum tin 1 year round by competi
tors of all nations. It has peculiar
demands of psychology and pace
which make it unique in the swim
ming world.
In the final this afternoon De
vino and Burton will utilize the
same sort of psychology that Jim
Bailey used at Los Angeles re
cently in defeating John Landy.
By allowing Severa of USC and
Hubach of Cal to "set the pace,"
the Card sharks will lay back
about five feet, "putting the pres
sure" on the front swimmers.
When approximately 200 yards
remain, Devine will lead Burton
into a sprint calculated to surpass
the fading Hubach and Severa.
Final Performance
This event is particularly suited
to the temperament of Tad De
vine. A senior in his final per
formance for Stanford, Tad will
utilize four years of training and
psychiatric conditioning when he j
begins the last mile of his col-!
legiate career.
Tomorrow and Saturday final I
races commencing at 3 p.m. will
draw over 200 entries for the 12
scheduled events. Swimmers from
California, USC and UCLA will
be pitted against the Cards, who
have not been defeated in this
meet for six years.
While favored to win their sev
enth straight, the Hayniemen will
face the toughest competition in
a long while as nearly every event
except the sprints is comparative
ly wide open for first place.
There will be no admission
charge on any of the three days
of competition.


TKAINKI) TO A PEAK for the current conference championships
are seniors Tad Dcvine and Phil (Hay, and junior Tom Kurton. liolli
Dcvine and Hurt on are entered in this afternoon's 1500 meter free
style event. Leading a favored Stanford team into the first race of
a three day meet, the Card distance aces are heavily favored to
place one-two in today's opener.
