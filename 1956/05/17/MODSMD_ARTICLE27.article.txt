# Papoose Baseballers Smash St. Ignatius on Frosh Field
## John Gillis Pitches Frosh to 10-6 Victory; Joel Newkirk Blasts Grand-Slam Home Run 
### 
Papoose bats pounded out a 10-6 victory at the expense of St. Igna
tius High School of San Francisco yesterday afternoon on the frosh
diamond as they won their eleventh game of the season.
They have lost only three during the season and have tied one.
The Frosh led most of the afternoon as they broke a 1-1 deadlock

in the third frame when first
baseman Joel Newkirk poled out
a long home run with the bags
bulging.
St. Ignatius chucker Bill Con
lon had issued three free passes
to set the stage for Newkirk's
grand-slammer.
With the Frosh coasting along
on a comfortable five-run lead in
the visitors' half of the sixth in
ning, the roof momentarily fell in
as the Wildcats pushed two runs
across in both the sixth and the
seventh to close the gap to one
run.
St. Ignatius runs scored in the
seventh when right-fielder George
LaCove blasted out the second
home run of the game after catch
er Bob Portman had singled.
With a narrow one-run lead, 7-6,
the Frosh went into the last half
of the seventh almost assured of
victory because of a (5 o'clock time
limit.
But the hustling Papooses were
not satisfied. They bombed the
St. Ignatian chucker for three big
runs to add insult to injury.
