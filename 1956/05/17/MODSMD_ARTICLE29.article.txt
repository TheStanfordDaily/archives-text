## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 16 (UP) Wel
terweight champion Johnny Sax
ton won a technical knockout vic
tory over middleweight Gil Tur
ner in the Chicago Stadium to
night when Dr. Irving N. Slott
refused to let Turner come out
for the tenth round.
Saxton surprisingly outweighed
his opponent, 151 1 - pounds to 151,
and he coolly outmaneuvered his
swarming foe to gain the victory.
The turning point in the fight
actually came in tlie first round
when Saxton slashed a small cut
on the upper and outer edge of
Turner's right eye. Thereafter,
though Turner's handlers stem
med the flow of blood from time
to time, Saxton kept widening the
slash steadily.
The victory avenged one ol' Sax
ton's four defeats a split deri
sion to Turner, June 15, 1953,
which ended the streak of 39 vic
tories and one draw with which
he opened his professional career.
It was only the second time
that Turner has been finished in
a bout. He lost to Kid Gavilan in
a try for the welterweight title
with an llth-round knockout July
7, 1952.
