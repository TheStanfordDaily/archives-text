### Stew Toy 
Stanford Theatre manager
John Nylen told The Daily yes
terday he is "ready and happy"
to institute a movie price dis
count plan for Stanford stu
dents similar to those in oper
a t i on at virtually all major
West Coast universities.
His offer came as a result of
The Daily's "What Do YOU
Think?" column last week, in
which students overwhelming
ly indicted Palo Alto theaters
for their "monopoly" price pol
icies.
Nylen, who was instrumen
tal in inaugurating the student

rate movie card plan at the
University of California when
he managnd a Berkeley thea
ter, said he has urged the
plan's adoption at Stanford in
the past but has met only with
apathy on the part of student
leaders.
The plan, pending ASSU ap
proval, would take effect next
fall. Students could buy $1 dis
count cards at the Pavilion dur
ing registration, entitling them
to "junior" admission prices at
the five Fox West Coast thea
ters on the Peninsula for the
rest of the school year.
Fifty cents of the discount

card price would go to the the
aters and 50 cents would he re
tained by the ASSU, to be used
for whatever student project
they chose.
Peninsula theaters included
in the plan which would give
students approximately a 25
per cent ticket price cut
wtoald be the Stanford in Palo
Alto ihe Fox in Redwood City,
the Carlos in San Carlos, the
San Mateo in San Mateo and
the Peninsula in Burlingame.
Nylen said his plan has been
rejected in the past because it
involved only the Stanford
Theatre. "We feel it's a won

derful plan, and we hope Stan
ford students will accept it,"
he said.
He emphasized that the time
element is important in its
adoption. "This thing has to be
settled before the end of the
current school year in order to
get things rolling by next fall."
Manager Dorothy Jessen of
the Varsity Theatre said that
her- theater "couldn't possibly"
subscribe to such a plan.
"Our policies are governed
by the United California Thea
tres, and they won't allow us
to give student discounts. We
tried a year ago, but they turn-

Ed us down," Miss Jossen said.
She said the Varsity must
often give 60 per cent of its re
ceipts to the chain. "Since our
seating capacity is only 900,
the theater is almost always
filled, and we can't afford to
lot cut-rate admissions take up
seats which could he filled with
regular-price moviegoers." The
Stanford Theatre has 1400
seats.

Stanford Theatre manager
John Nylen told The Daily yes
terday he is "ready and happy"
to institute a movie price dis
count plan for Stanford stu
dents similar to those in oper
a t i on at virtually all major
West Coast universities.
His offer came as a result of
The Daily's "What Do YOU
Think?" column last week, in
which students overwhelming
ly indicted Palo Alto theaters
for their "monopoly" price pol
icies.
Nylen, who was instrumen
tal in inaugurating the student

rate movie card plan at the
University of California when
he managnd a Berkeley thea
ter, said he has urged the
plan's adoption at Stanford in
the past but has met only with
apathy on the part of student
leaders.
The plan, pending ASSU ap
proval, would take effect next
fall. Students could buy $1 dis
count cards at the Pavilion dur
ing registration, entitling them
to "junior" admission prices at
the five Fox West Coast thea
ters on the Peninsula for the
rest of the school year.
Fifty cents of the discount

card price would go to the the
aters and 50 cents would he re
tained by the ASSU, to be used
for whatever student project
they chose.
Peninsula theaters included
in the plan which would give
students approximately a 25
per cent ticket price cut
wtoald be the Stanford in Palo
Alto ihe Fox in Redwood City,
the Carlos in San Carlos, the
San Mateo in San Mateo and
the Peninsula in Burlingame.
Nylen said his plan has been
rejected in the past because it
involved only the Stanford
Theatre. "We feel it's a won

derful plan, and we hope Stan
ford students will accept it,"
he said.
He emphasized that the time
element is important in its
adoption. "This thing has to be
settled before the end of the
current school year in order to
get things rolling by next fall."
Manager Dorothy Jessen of
the Varsity Theatre said that
her- theater "couldn't possibly"
subscribe to such a plan.
"Our policies are governed
by the United California Thea
tres, and they won't allow us
to give student discounts. We
tried a year ago, but they turn-

Ed us down," Miss Jossen said.
She said the Varsity must
often give 60 per cent of its re
ceipts to the chain. "Since our
seating capacity is only 900,
the theater is almost always
filled, and we can't afford to
lot cut-rate admissions take up
seats which could he filled with
regular-price moviegoers." The
Stanford Theatre has 1400
seats.
