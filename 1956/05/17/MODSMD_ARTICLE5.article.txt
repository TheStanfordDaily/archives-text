# UCLA Dean Says Student Government Is Privilege
## Gites Unworkable Constitution Reason For Removal of Graduate Student Council 
### 
Richard Hill, UCLA administrative assistant to the dean of stu
dents, told The Daily yesterday that "student government at UCLA
exists as a privilege granted to the students hy the university."
Hill, clarifying the UCLA administration's stand on the recent stu
dent government upheaval, climaxed hy a university directive order-

ing the expulsion of graduate Stu
dent Council representatives and
the drafting of a new constitution,
said student government: is "an
integral part of the university
structure, not a separate entity."
He said "administration offi
cials must hear the responsibility
for everything that goes on in the
university, and they must there
fore have the necessary regula
tive authority."
The administration's reform di
rective, Hill said, was ordered
"mainly because the present con
stitution is unworkable. The Stu
dent Council was riven by dissent.
Its actions broke down completely
on more than one occasion."
Unanimous Agreement
Hill said he believed the stu
dents were in "unanimous agree
ment" that the constitution was
unworkable. "But the council fail
ed to act to revise it, because it
could not act."
He said only four or six Stu
dent Council members were left
from the original membership of
14 at the time of the directive.
Because of the student govern
ment "privilege of existence" situ
ation, the administration had the
authority to. require a constitu
tional revision, he said.
The administration's main idea
behind the directive, Hill said, was
to "make up a student council
broadly representative of the un
dergraduate students."
Referendum
The Student Council hold a spe
cial referendum last week on the
directive. Students voted 2278 to
1360 against the administration
order.
Contrary to previous reports,
Hill said the directive had taken
effect before the election was held
and that the council was appar
ently trying merely to get an ex
pression of student opinion.
Although students protested
that the university's disenfran
chiserhent of UCLA's 4000 gradu
ate students was undemocratic,
Hill said that grads are not con
sidered regular members of the
student horiy.
Compulsory Fee
"The undergraduate must pay a
compulsory fee of $."5 ;» semester
to join the Associated Students.
Graduates may .join the ASUCLA
by paying a voluntary $2 fee."
Four hundred of the 4000 grad
students are ASUCLA members.
"The graduate students are cur
rently holding elections to decide
on the formation of their own
graduate association," Hill said.
He said such an association would
be a representative body for grad
students similar to the ASUCLA,
which will now represent only
undergrads. %

Although students protested
that the university's disenfran
chiserhent of UCLA's 4000 gradu
ate students was undemocratic,
Hill said that grads are not con
sidered regular members of the
student horiy.
Compulsory Fee
"The undergraduate must pay a
compulsory fee of $."5 ;» semester
to join the Associated Students.
Graduates may .join the ASUCLA
by paying a voluntary $2 fee."
Four hundred of the 4000 grad
students are ASUCLA members.
"The graduate students are cur
rently holding elections to decide
on the formation of their own
graduate association," Hill said.
He said such an association would
be a representative body for grad
students similar to the ASUCLA,
which will now represent only
undergrads. %
Richard Hill, UCLA administrative assistant to the dean of stu
dents, told The Daily yesterday that "student government at UCLA
exists as a privilege granted to the students hy the university."
Hill, clarifying the UCLA administration's stand on the recent stu
dent government upheaval, climaxed hy a university directive order-

ing the expulsion of graduate Stu
dent Council representatives and
the drafting of a new constitution,
said student government: is "an
integral part of the university
structure, not a separate entity."
He said "administration offi
cials must hear the responsibility
for everything that goes on in the
university, and they must there
fore have the necessary regula
tive authority."
The administration's reform di
rective, Hill said, was ordered
"mainly because the present con
stitution is unworkable. The Stu
dent Council was riven by dissent.
Its actions broke down completely
on more than one occasion."
Unanimous Agreement
Hill said he believed the stu
dents were in "unanimous agree
ment" that the constitution was
unworkable. "But the council fail
ed to act to revise it, because it
could not act."
He said only four or six Stu
dent Council members were left
from the original membership of
14 at the time of the directive.
Because of the student govern
ment "privilege of existence" situ
ation, the administration had the
authority to. require a constitu
tional revision, he said.
The administration's main idea
behind the directive, Hill said, was
to "make up a student council
broadly representative of the un
dergraduate students."
Referendum
The Student Council hold a spe
cial referendum last week on the
directive. Students voted 2278 to
1360 against the administration
order.
Contrary to previous reports,
Hill said the directive had taken
effect before the election was held
and that the council was appar
ently trying merely to get an ex
pression of student opinion.

chiserhent of UCLA's 4000 gradu
