# When Mercury Climbs, It's Lake Lag Time

### 
wave has liit the Bay Area this week with
the temperatures ranging over 90 degrees yes
terday. To cool off students have resorted to
raids, like the one at Toyon Tuesday night, and
basking in the sun at Lake Lagunita. If you think

you were hot you should have been in San Rafael.
It was 102. It was 91 in San Francisco. A car
parked in the Stern parking lot had one of its
windows blown out from the heat.
