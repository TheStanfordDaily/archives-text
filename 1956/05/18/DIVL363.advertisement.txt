The secret—they're SYNCHRO-DYNEDt
They're called the sweetest playing clubs in the book, and;
for good reason. Spalding's exclusive SYNCHRO-DYNED®j
club process, a scientifically exact system of weight coordi
nation, gives each club in the set the identical swing and
"contact feel" to help groove your swing.
And this new Bobby Jones set is as handsome as they corner
The irons feature an exclusive tough alloy steel with a,
glistening high-polish finish that lasts season after season.

DYNED clubs at your Spalding dealer's.
