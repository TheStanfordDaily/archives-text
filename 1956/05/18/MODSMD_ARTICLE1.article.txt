# 2000 Cal Students in Giant Panty Raid As 24 Women's Houses Stormed by Men
## 
### Stew Toy 
Two thousand University of
California students staged a mass
"panty-raid" assault on 22 sorori
ty houses and two women's dor
mitories Wednesday night. The
raid started as a "friendly water
hag fight" and ended in an orgi
astic melee causing damage esti
mated at more than $10,000.
Doors were ripped off hinges,
windows broken and furniture
smashed as gleeful men made the
rounds of the houses and dorms,
terrorizing coeds for nearly four
hours.

One raider boasted, "Man, we
didn't miss a single sorority
house."
Coeds were "knocked around,
assaulted, carried outside in pa
jamas or nude," a Daily Califor
nian editorial said.
Police Capt. L. H. Baird, who
directed the squads of Berkeley
police rushed to the scene, said
things were "not that bad," but
that a few women were "pulled
out of bed and their nightclothes
ripped off."
He said "there are probably a
lot of people who don't have a

pair of pants to wear."
The water fights which sparked
the riot panty-raid started at 5:30
Wednesday afternoon. Water-bag
ging continued until 10:30, when
the ever-gathering mobs of male
students burst with renewed en
thusiasm and began the concerted
Putsch for the lingerie drawers.
From then on, there was no
stopping them.
Male students crashed into one
sorority house after another,
smashing down hastily - erected
barricades. As police broke up
one group, another would make
a raid in a different direction.
Delta Zeta, one of the hardest
hit sororities, was attacked at
11:30. The mob climbed in
through broken third-floor win
dows.
Mauled
"Most of the girls locked them
selves in the house - mother's
room," a Delta Zeta coed said.
"But they broke in and pulled us
out. One girl kept them away by
brandishing an iron. They mauled
another."
The mob then pushed down
stairs, broke furniture and lamps,
and emptied cans of milk on the
floor.
Delta Zeta estimated its dam
age to personal belongings, in
cluding stolen underwear, dress
es, watches, a typewriter and a
wedding trousseau, at close to
$3000. Damage to the house is not
yet known.
Damage High
Average damage to each of the
22 sororities, not including per
sonal losses through theft, was
"conservatively estimated" at be
tween $400 and $500.
"The houses which put up the
most resistance were hardest hit,"
John Vlahos, a Daily Californian
editor, said. He said there was a
general feeling at Cal that "no
damage was intended," but that
"things just got out of hand."
A SUC president Jim Kidder
made a futile attempt to stop the
raids. He claimed many students
would have liked to end the riot
ing, but they "didn't have any or
ganization."
Thief's Active
The Oakland Tribune claimed
certain "bald-headed men" also
took part in the raids. It suggest
ed that thiefs may have seen an
opportunity to rob coeds unmo
lested.
The raids finally subsided at 2
a.m. But the aftermath will be
felt for some time.
William S h e p p a r d, assistant
dean of students, was "horrified."
He moaned, "Nothing like this
has ever happened before."
Reparation flans
Several student and administra
tion committees have been organ
ized to determine the extent of
the damage and to establish re
sponsibility for ropafyitions.
Men's living groups have been
urged to turn in their\ooty to a
central pool. A system Hf volun
tary contributions rather than
fines »#> make up the losses has
also been suggested.
It took 40 Berkeley policemen
every available man—to quell the
riots and clean up the mess.
Said journalist Vlahos of the
raiders, "I guess the heat just got
to them."

ALPHA PHI'S at Cal were beseiged by panty

from houses. University officials estimated the
damage at more than $10,000.

Two thousand University of
California students staged a mass
"panty-raid" assault on 22 sorori
ty houses and two women's dor
mitories Wednesday night. The
raid started as a "friendly water
hag fight" and ended in an orgi
astic melee causing damage esti
mated at more than $10,000.
Doors were ripped off hinges,
windows broken and furniture
smashed as gleeful men made the
rounds of the houses and dorms,
terrorizing coeds for nearly four
hours.

One raider boasted, "Man, we
didn't miss a single sorority
house."
Coeds were "knocked around,
assaulted, carried outside in pa
jamas or nude," a Daily Califor
nian editorial said.
Police Capt. L. H. Baird, who
directed the squads of Berkeley
police rushed to the scene, said
things were "not that bad," but
that a few women were "pulled
out of bed and their nightclothes
ripped off."
He said "there are probably a
lot of people who don't have a

pair of pants to wear."
The water fights which sparked
the riot panty-raid started at 5:30
Wednesday afternoon. Water-bag
ging continued until 10:30, when
the ever-gathering mobs of male
students burst with renewed en
thusiasm and began the concerted
Putsch for the lingerie drawers.
From then on, there was no
stopping them.
Male students crashed into one
sorority house after another,
smashing down hastily - erected
barricades. As police broke up
one group, another would make
a raid in a different direction.
Delta Zeta, one of the hardest
hit sororities, was attacked at
11:30. The mob climbed in
through broken third-floor win
dows.
Mauled
"Most of the girls locked them
selves in the house - mother's
room," a Delta Zeta coed said.
"But they broke in and pulled us
out. One girl kept them away by
brandishing an iron. They mauled
another."
The mob then pushed down
stairs, broke furniture and lamps,
and emptied cans of milk on the
floor.
Delta Zeta estimated its dam
age to personal belongings, in
cluding stolen underwear, dress
es, watches, a typewriter and a
wedding trousseau, at close to
$3000. Damage to the house is not
yet known.
Damage High
Average damage to each of the
22 sororities, not including per
sonal losses through theft, was
"conservatively estimated" at be
tween $400 and $500.
"The houses which put up the
most resistance were hardest hit,"
John Vlahos, a Daily Californian
editor, said. He said there was a
general feeling at Cal that "no
damage was intended," but that
"things just got out of hand."
A SUC president Jim Kidder
made a futile attempt to stop the
raids. He claimed many students
would have liked to end the riot
ing, but they "didn't have any or
ganization."
Thief's Active
The Oakland Tribune claimed
certain "bald-headed men" also
took part in the raids. It suggest
ed that thiefs may have seen an
opportunity to rob coeds unmo
lested.
The raids finally subsided at 2
a.m. But the aftermath will be
felt for some time.
William S h e p p a r d, assistant
dean of students, was "horrified."
He moaned, "Nothing like this
has ever happened before."
Reparation flans
Several student and administra
tion committees have been organ
ized to determine the extent of
the damage and to establish re
sponsibility for ropafyitions.
Men's living groups have been
urged to turn in their\ooty to a
central pool. A system Hf volun
tary contributions rather than
fines »#> make up the losses has
also been suggested.

Two thousand University of
California students staged a mass
"panty-raid" assault on 22 sorori
ty houses and two women's dor
mitories Wednesday night. The
raid started as a "friendly water
hag fight" and ended in an orgi
astic melee causing damage esti
mated at more than $10,000.
Doors were ripped off hinges,
windows broken and furniture
smashed as gleeful men made the
rounds of the houses and dorms,
terrorizing coeds for nearly four
hours.

One raider boasted, "Man, we
didn't miss a single sorority
house."
Coeds were "knocked around,
assaulted, carried outside in pa
jamas or nude," a Daily Califor
nian editorial said.
Police Capt. L. H. Baird, who
directed the squads of Berkeley
police rushed to the scene, said
things were "not that bad," but
that a few women were "pulled
out of bed and their nightclothes
ripped off."
He said "there are probably a
lot of people who don't have a

pair of pants to wear."
The water fights which sparked
the riot panty-raid started at 5:30
Wednesday afternoon. Water-bag
ging continued until 10:30, when
the ever-gathering mobs of male
students burst with renewed en
thusiasm and began the concerted
Putsch for the lingerie drawers.
From then on, there was no
stopping them.
Male students crashed into one
sorority house after another,
smashing down hastily - erected
barricades. As police broke up
one group, another would make
a raid in a different direction.
Delta Zeta, one of the hardest
hit sororities, was attacked at
11:30. The mob climbed in
through broken third-floor win
dows.
Mauled
"Most of the girls locked them
selves in the house - mother's
room," a Delta Zeta coed said.
"But they broke in and pulled us
out. One girl kept them away by
brandishing an iron. They mauled
another."
The mob then pushed down
stairs, broke furniture and lamps,
and emptied cans of milk on the
floor.
Delta Zeta estimated its dam
age to personal belongings, in
cluding stolen underwear, dress
es, watches, a typewriter and a
wedding trousseau, at close to
$3000. Damage to the house is not
yet known.
Damage High
Average damage to each of the
22 sororities, not including per
sonal losses through theft, was
"conservatively estimated" at be
tween $400 and $500.
"The houses which put up the
most resistance were hardest hit,"
John Vlahos, a Daily Californian
editor, said. He said there was a
general feeling at Cal that "no
damage was intended," but that
"things just got out of hand."
A SUC president Jim Kidder
made a futile attempt to stop the
raids. He claimed many students
would have liked to end the riot
ing, but they "didn't have any or
ganization."
Thief's Active
The Oakland Tribune claimed
certain "bald-headed men" also
took part in the raids. It suggest
ed that thiefs may have seen an
opportunity to rob coeds unmo
lested.
The raids finally subsided at 2
a.m. But the aftermath will be
felt for some time.
William S h e p p a r d, assistant
dean of students, was "horrified."
He moaned, "Nothing like this
has ever happened before."
