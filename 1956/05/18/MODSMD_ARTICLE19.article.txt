# Last At-Bats
## 
### 
A trio of Stanford baseballers will be making
their last appearances for the Indians when the
season comes to a close tomorrow afternoon at
Berkeley.
Twirler Ray Young, co-captain Bob Evans
and centerfielder Mi.'key Holzman will be tak
ill•' their last turns at hat against the California
Bears.
Each of these three has played varsity ball
for three years. Young was sensational as a
ophomore and he received the Most Valuable
I 'layer award. As a junior he overcame back
and arm trouble to post'a respectable pitching
record.

This year he has been effective off-and-on,
but has remained the "workhorse" of the team
by playing in the outfield when not on the
mound.
Boh Evans, leftfielder, is leading the Stanford
batters at the plate this season, and Holzman is
«'lose behind for third-place honors.
Coach Dutch Fehring's first year at the helm
started out with promise, hut losses to USC and
California dropped the team out of CIBA pen
nant contention. Nevertheless, the season has
been a better-than-average one and the future
looks bright.
Best luck to Dutch, and the entire Stanford
baseball team in their season finale.
