'Protector Reilly'
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to the article published in the May
1G issue of The Stanford Daily concerning my
protest about a California use tax levy, there are
a lew points I would like to make clearer:
• The automobile in question was not pur
chased in Maine. It was purchased in Massachu
setts while I was on active duty with the Navy
there.
• The tax I paid to the authorities in Maine
was a use and not a sales tax, since the car was
not purchased in that state. I paid that tax be
cause my home is in Maine and because I re
turned home shortly after release from duty.
• In earlier correspondence, the State Board
of Equalization notified me that if I could prove
that I had not purchased the car with the specific
intent of using it in California, I would not be
subject to the tax. I feel that I have proved this,
but the Board seems to have changed its mind
about this making any difference.
In answer to Mr. George Reilly, protector of
California merchants, I would like to point out
1 hat, since—by his own admission "most states
have similar laws," there is very little to "pro
tect" Calilornia merchants against.
On the other hand, one could take the point of
view that all Americans who purchase automo
biles outside the state of California are cheating
California merchants of, not "millions of dollars,"
but literally billions of dollars' worlh of business.

KZSU Survey
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to express our thanks to all the
students who responded to our recent survey to
determine the "radio tastes" of the Stanford

audience. The response was better than antici
pated, and we certainly appreciate the comments
and criticisms received.
Special thanks are due the members (especial
ly the secretaries) of the fraternities and row
houses. Due to limited time for the survey, we
were forced to poll the row area by mail, and we
were very pleased with the replies.
The results of this survey will be a guide to
KZSU's programming next fall, so the students
who paiticipated in the survey can feel that they
have played a large part in determining what
they will hear on KZSU next year.

Volleyball Thanks
Editor, The Daily:
We have just returned from Seattle, where we
placed second in the National Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Tournament. This letter is an inadequate
attempt to express our thanks to those people
whose aid and encouragement were invaluable
to us.
People like Howard Dullum, Lois Baker, Cooley
Butler, Jerry Angrove, the Palo Club of Palo
Alto, Spiro's Sporting Goods, the Stockton volley
ball team and Smith's Sporting Goods who made
the trip possible. But most of all we would like
to thank Mr. A1 Masters, whose help and gener
osity we could not have done without.
Thank you.

but the Board seems to have changed its mind
about this making any difference.
In answer to Mr. George Reilly, protector of
California merchants, I would like to point out
1 hat, since—by his own admission "most states
have similar laws," there is very little to "pro
tect" Calilornia merchants against.
On the other hand, one could take the point of
view that all Americans who purchase automo
biles outside the state of California are cheating
California merchants of, not "millions of dollars,"
but literally billions of dollars' worlh of business.

KZSU Survey
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to express our thanks to all the
students who responded to our recent survey to
determine the "radio tastes" of the Stanford

audience. The response was better than antici
pated, and we certainly appreciate the comments
and criticisms received.
Special thanks are due the members (especial
ly the secretaries) of the fraternities and row
houses. Due to limited time for the survey, we
were forced to poll the row area by mail, and we
were very pleased with the replies.
The results of this survey will be a guide to
KZSU's programming next fall, so the students
who paiticipated in the survey can feel that they
have played a large part in determining what
they will hear on KZSU next year.

Volleyball Thanks
Editor, The Daily:
We have just returned from Seattle, where we
placed second in the National Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Tournament. This letter is an inadequate
attempt to express our thanks to those people
whose aid and encouragement were invaluable
to us.
People like Howard Dullum, Lois Baker, Cooley
Butler, Jerry Angrove, the Palo Club of Palo
Alto, Spiro's Sporting Goods, the Stockton volley
ball team and Smith's Sporting Goods who made
the trip possible. But most of all we would like
to thank Mr. A1 Masters, whose help and gener
osity we could not have done without.
Thank you.

'Protector Reilly'
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to the article published in the May
1G issue of The Stanford Daily concerning my
protest about a California use tax levy, there are
a lew points I would like to make clearer:
• The automobile in question was not pur
chased in Maine. It was purchased in Massachu
setts while I was on active duty with the Navy
there.
• The tax I paid to the authorities in Maine
was a use and not a sales tax, since the car was
not purchased in that state. I paid that tax be
cause my home is in Maine and because I re
turned home shortly after release from duty.
• In earlier correspondence, the State Board
of Equalization notified me that if I could prove
that I had not purchased the car with the specific
intent of using it in California, I would not be
subject to the tax. I feel that I have proved this,
but the Board seems to have changed its mind
about this making any difference.
