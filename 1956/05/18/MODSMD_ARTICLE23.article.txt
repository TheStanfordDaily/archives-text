# A 						Letter from an Ex-Stanford Gridder
## Speaks in Defense of Big-Time Football on the Farm 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I was greatly disturbed to read The Daily's
story, and the accompanying student opinions,
on athletes and hashing jobs. This is just an
other phase of the move to de-emphasize ath
letics. Lately, every newspaper writer in Cali
fornia has been criticizing intercollegiate ath
letics, especially football. I think it is about time
that someone spoke up against these narrow
minded, ill-informed individuals.
Since the majority of the attack has been di
rected against football, and since half of the
hashing jobs in question go to football players,
an analysis of the intercollegiate football pro
gram would-be the best place to start.
The first question is, Do we want big time
football, or do we want to de-emphasize and go
"Ivy League"? This question has already been
answered for us by Stanford's administrative
body. Yes, we want big time football. The reason
is obvious when one looks to the University of
Chicago where intercollegiate football has been
eliminated.
There the undergraduate enrollment has
dropped to one seventh of its former total. There
is almost no undergraduate social life because
the main rallying point for undergraduate en
thusiasm is gone. The situation at Chicago is
so bad that its administration is seriously con
sidering reinstating football as a major sport.
The skeptics will answer that we don't have to
eliminate football, but rather de-emphasize it,
in the way Harvard has done. The difference
between Stanford and Harvard is obvious. Har
vard can financially afford to switch to small
time, athletics, while Stanford can't. Football,
the way Harvard plays it, is a losing proposition
and the financial losses are absorbed by the gen
eral funds of the university. The general funds
of Stanford can't afford any greater strain.
As I mentioned above, finances are very im
portant in the issue of whether to have big foot
ball or not. A lot of the critics of football don't
realize what would happen if football, as a source
of revenue, were eliminated. There would be no
intramural or intercollegiate athletics of any
sort, since football money supports all other
sports.
No other sport at Stanford makes money, and
only basketball pays its own way. As you can
see, football revenues are vital to the University.
If we had Ivy League football the loss in reve
nue would be astounding, and the result is that
the cost of all sports and the intra mural pro

gram would be thrown on the University.
Also, if there were no football on a large scale,
there would be no funds for maintneance of the
athletic grounds and such things as the swim
ming pools, tennis courts and the golf courses
would be eliminated. Up until the last two years
the golf course lost money and was subsidized
by football revenues. I might also point out to
the uninformed that the Women's Gym and
Branner Hall were built with football money.
So football makes money. Making money is
no sin, especially in light of the use it is put to.
To make money, we must have good teams. To
have a good team we must have good ball play
ers. In orcjer to get football players away from
other schools, it must be to their advantage to
come to Stanford.
Let's look at what UCLA can legally offer a
high school footballer. He need pay no tuition.
He can probably live at home, so no room and
board to pay. Also he will get a $100-a-month job,
which is within conference limits.
What does he get from Stanford? A grant-in
aid for tuition and a $35-a-month job. Now we
know that Stanford's education is a better one,
hut can we expect the boy to come here and
starve? Certainly not. The hashing job must
therefore be available.
I might point out that grants-in-aid and hash
ing jobs are never given to an athlete who is not
in financial need. Some of Stanford's outstand
ing competitors have paid their own way
through. I might mention the names of Garrett
and Mathias as examples. In fact, if all the hash
ing jobs were given on a basis of need, they
would probably wind up in the same hands as
t hey are now.
To sum up, if the athlete's hashing jobs are
eliminated, the immediate results will be poorer
teams, necessitating withdrawal from the con
ference, since we would no longer be able to com
pete. This would lose us all athletic revenues,
and the entire student body would suffer.
I have attempted to point out the practical
necessity of football. There are of course intan
gible benefits, such as all the friends the athletic
teams win for Stanford. I suggest that the next
time the critics rise up against the athletic pro
gram, they take a good look at Stanford's facili
ties and imagine what the situation would be
like if there were no football revenues to support
and maintain those facilities.

the golf course lost money and was subsidized
by football revenues. I might also point out to
the uninformed that the Women's Gym and
Branner Hall were built with football money.
So football makes money. Making money is
no sin, especially in light of the use it is put to.
To make money, we must have good teams. To
have a good team we must have good ball play
ers. In orcjer to get football players away from
other schools, it must be to their advantage to
come to Stanford.
Let's look at what UCLA can legally offer a
high school footballer. He need pay no tuition.
He can probably live at home, so no room and
board to pay. Also he will get a $100-a-month job,
which is within conference limits.
What does he get from Stanford? A grant-in
aid for tuition and a $35-a-month job. Now we
know that Stanford's education is a better one,
hut can we expect the boy to come here and
starve? Certainly not. The hashing job must
therefore be available.
I might point out that grants-in-aid and hash
ing jobs are never given to an athlete who is not
in financial need. Some of Stanford's outstand
ing competitors have paid their own way
through. I might mention the names of Garrett
and Mathias as examples. In fact, if all the hash
ing jobs were given on a basis of need, they
would probably wind up in the same hands as
t hey are now.
To sum up, if the athlete's hashing jobs are
eliminated, the immediate results will be poorer
teams, necessitating withdrawal from the con
ference, since we would no longer be able to com
pete. This would lose us all athletic revenues,
and the entire student body would suffer.
I have attempted to point out the practical
necessity of football. There are of course intan
gible benefits, such as all the friends the athletic
teams win for Stanford. I suggest that the next
time the critics rise up against the athletic pro
gram, they take a good look at Stanford's facili
ties and imagine what the situation would be
like if there were no football revenues to support
and maintain those facilities.

Editor, The Daily:
I was greatly disturbed to read The Daily's
story, and the accompanying student opinions,
on athletes and hashing jobs. This is just an
other phase of the move to de-emphasize ath
letics. Lately, every newspaper writer in Cali
fornia has been criticizing intercollegiate ath
letics, especially football. I think it is about time
that someone spoke up against these narrow
minded, ill-informed individuals.
Since the majority of the attack has been di
rected against football, and since half of the
hashing jobs in question go to football players,
an analysis of the intercollegiate football pro
gram would-be the best place to start.
The first question is, Do we want big time
football, or do we want to de-emphasize and go
"Ivy League"? This question has already been
answered for us by Stanford's administrative
body. Yes, we want big time football. The reason
is obvious when one looks to the University of
Chicago where intercollegiate football has been
eliminated.
There the undergraduate enrollment has
dropped to one seventh of its former total. There
is almost no undergraduate social life because
the main rallying point for undergraduate en
thusiasm is gone. The situation at Chicago is
so bad that its administration is seriously con
sidering reinstating football as a major sport.
The skeptics will answer that we don't have to
eliminate football, but rather de-emphasize it,
in the way Harvard has done. The difference
between Stanford and Harvard is obvious. Har
vard can financially afford to switch to small
time, athletics, while Stanford can't. Football,
the way Harvard plays it, is a losing proposition
and the financial losses are absorbed by the gen
eral funds of the university. The general funds
of Stanford can't afford any greater strain.
As I mentioned above, finances are very im
portant in the issue of whether to have big foot
ball or not. A lot of the critics of football don't
realize what would happen if football, as a source
of revenue, were eliminated. There would be no
intramural or intercollegiate athletics of any
sort, since football money supports all other
sports.
No other sport at Stanford makes money, and
only basketball pays its own way. As you can
see, football revenues are vital to the University.
If we had Ivy League football the loss in reve
nue would be astounding, and the result is that
the cost of all sports and the intra mural pro

gram would be thrown on the University.
Also, if there were no football on a large scale,
there would be no funds for maintneance of the
athletic grounds and such things as the swim
ming pools, tennis courts and the golf courses
would be eliminated. Up until the last two years
the golf course lost money and was subsidized
by football revenues. I might also point out to

minded, ill-informed individuals.
Since the majority of the attack has been di
rected against football, and since half of the
hashing jobs in question go to football players,
an analysis of the intercollegiate football pro
gram would-be the best place to start.
The first question is, Do we want big time
football, or do we want to de-emphasize and go
"Ivy League"? This question has already been
answered for us by Stanford's administrative
body. Yes, we want big time football. The reason
is obvious when one looks to the University of
Chicago where intercollegiate football has been
eliminated.
There the undergraduate enrollment has
dropped to one seventh of its former total. There
is almost no undergraduate social life because
the main rallying point for undergraduate en
thusiasm is gone. The situation at Chicago is
so bad that its administration is seriously con
sidering reinstating football as a major sport.
The skeptics will answer that we don't have to
eliminate football, but rather de-emphasize it,
in the way Harvard has done. The difference
between Stanford and Harvard is obvious. Har
vard can financially afford to switch to small
time, athletics, while Stanford can't. Football,
the way Harvard plays it, is a losing proposition
and the financial losses are absorbed by the gen
eral funds of the university. The general funds
of Stanford can't afford any greater strain.
As I mentioned above, finances are very im
portant in the issue of whether to have big foot
ball or not. A lot of the critics of football don't
realize what would happen if football, as a source
of revenue, were eliminated. There would be no
intramural or intercollegiate athletics of any
sort, since football money supports all other
sports.
No other sport at Stanford makes money, and
only basketball pays its own way. As you can
see, football revenues are vital to the University.
If we had Ivy League football the loss in reve
nue would be astounding, and the result is that
the cost of all sports and the intra mural pro

gram would be thrown on the University.
Also, if there were no football on a large scale,
there would be no funds for maintneance of the
athletic grounds and such things as the swim
ming pools, tennis courts and the golf courses
would be eliminated. Up until the last two years
the golf course lost money and was subsidized
by football revenues. I might also point out to
the uninformed that the Women's Gym and
Branner Hall were built with football money.
So football makes money. Making money is
no sin, especially in light of the use it is put to.
To make money, we must have good teams. To
have a good team we must have good ball play
ers. In orcjer to get football players away from
other schools, it must be to their advantage to
come to Stanford.
Let's look at what UCLA can legally offer a
high school footballer. He need pay no tuition.
He can probably live at home, so no room and
board to pay. Also he will get a $100-a-month job,
which is within conference limits.
What does he get from Stanford? A grant-in
aid for tuition and a $35-a-month job. Now we
know that Stanford's education is a better one,
hut can we expect the boy to come here and
starve? Certainly not. The hashing job must
therefore be available.
I might point out that grants-in-aid and hash
ing jobs are never given to an athlete who is not
in financial need. Some of Stanford's outstand
ing competitors have paid their own way
through. I might mention the names of Garrett
and Mathias as examples. In fact, if all the hash
ing jobs were given on a basis of need, they
would probably wind up in the same hands as
t hey are now.
To sum up, if the athlete's hashing jobs are
eliminated, the immediate results will be poorer
teams, necessitating withdrawal from the con
ference, since we would no longer be able to com
pete. This would lose us all athletic revenues,
and the entire student body would suffer.
I have attempted to point out the practical
necessity of football. There are of course intan
gible benefits, such as all the friends the athletic
teams win for Stanford. I suggest that the next
time the critics rise up against the athletic pro
gram, they take a good look at Stanford's facili
ties and imagine what the situation would be
like if there were no football revenues to support
and maintain those facilities.

Editor, The Daily:
I was greatly disturbed to read The Daily's
story, and the accompanying student opinions,
on athletes and hashing jobs. This is just an
other phase of the move to de-emphasize ath
letics. Lately, every newspaper writer in Cali
fornia has been criticizing intercollegiate ath
letics, especially football. I think it is about time
that someone spoke up against these narrow
minded, ill-informed individuals.
