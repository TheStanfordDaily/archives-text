# House Foreign Affairs Group Rejects Long-Term Aid Idea
## Committee Softens Blow by Approving Policy Statement on Foreign Aid 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 17 (UP)—-The House Foreign Affairs Com
mittee handed President Eisenhower a major setback today by flatly
rejecting his plea for authority to make long-range foreign aid com
mitments.
It softened the blow, however, by approving a policy statement that

the United States will continue aid
to its allies as long as it is needed
to combat Soviet imperialism and
Communist infiltration.
The committee also rejected
Eisenhower's request for $100
million, to be used at his discre
tion, for emergency economic aid
to the Middle East.
$100 Million Asked
The actions were taken in closed
session as the committee con
tinued its point-by-point consider
ation of the President'ss4.9 billion
foreign aid program for the fiscal
year beginning next July 1.
Eisenhower had asked Congress
for authority to commit $100 mil
lion a year over the next 10 years
for long-range major economic
projects in friendly nations.
Richards, who opposed long
term commitments, offered the
policy statement. It declares that
so long as the danger of Commu
nist aggression exists, the United
States will "make available to free
nations and peoples upon request
assistance ... in such amounts as
the United States is able to provide
to help them maintain their free
dom."
Allies' Fears
The statement was intended to
meet the President's expressed
fears that some U.S. allies are
afraid that the United States may
cut off their military and economic
aid.
The committee specified that
the $100 mililon fund—as well as
other economic aid to Asia and the
Middle East - be granted on a loan
basis rather than as outright gifts.
