# Cards Close Out Baseball Season Against California
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team takes
its slightly tarnished record up to
Berkeley tomorrow for the season
closer against California. The In
dians need a victory to take sec
ond place in the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association
race behind USC.
Cal is only a half-game behind
the Indians and has trimmed
Stanford three times to date.
Dutch Fehring and his players
are anxious to avenge those de
feats to some extent, and Card
ace Ray Young will be pitching.
Bear coach George Wolfman
will counter with his ace, Gene
Stang, who has beaten Stanford
twice this year 1 . The Bears have
had a screwy league record. They
split four games with fourth-place
UCLA, lost to last-place Santa
Clara, 30-12, and lost three to
USC.
But their ability to beat Stan
ford has cost the Cards all chance
for a league title. Stanford has an
8-6 league record and has a rained
out game with Santa Clara still
on the schedule, but it is doubtful
that it will be played.
Stanford has a 23-9-1 record
over the season, while the Bears
have a practically identical record
of 23-10.
