Dedicated March 15, 1956
Gift of Sarah J. Garretson,
Stanford Class of '94,
to Bowman Alumni House
Miss Garretson is a familiar
Stanford figure. The tiny lady at
tended the University in its first
three years, 1891 to 1893. She ma
jored in mathematics; she also at
tended Indiana University.

Palo Alto and spends much of her
time on campus. With more en
ergy than many Stanfordites one*
quarter her age, she frequently
walks from Palo Alto to campus.
Early last fall Miss Garretson
noticed a little redwood tree grow
ing in a small space between the
sidewalk and curb in downtown
Palo Alto. This is a very unusual
place to find a redwood, and Miss
Garretson knew that the potential
giant would soon die if it were
not given more root space.
After talking to numerous peo
ple on campus, Miss Garretson

arranged for a place to put the
tree in back of Bowman and paid
the Corporation Yard to trans
plant the little tree.
Finally, in early spring arrange
ments were completed and the
tree was planted and dedicated in
its new home, with ample grow
ing space.
Now the tree is thriving and is
more than 20 feet tall. It still re
ceives loving care from Miss Gar
retson, who personally waters it.
In their desire to share Miss
Garretson's unusual gift with suc
ceeding Stanford generations, the
Bowman office staff arranged for
the plaque, which was a surprise
for Miss Garretson.
