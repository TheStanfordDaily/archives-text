# Budget Surplus Forecast, But No Tax Cut in Sight

### 
WASHINGTON, May 17 (UP)
— The Administration told Con
gress today it expects a $1.8 bil
lion budget surplus this year—
about eight times as large as it
predicted in January.
The Administration's two top
fiscal officials seemed to rule out
any hope of a tax cut, however.
They said the surplus "will make
a most welcome reduction in our
huge national debt."
Despite election • year pressure
from Democrats and some Repub
licans for a personal income tax
cut, President Eisenhower has
thus far stood firm on his deter
mination to give first priority to
a "modest" payment on the na
tional debt.
Today's forecast of a $1.8 bil
lion surplus was made by the
Treasury Department in an un
usual public statement. This was
a whopping increase over the
Treasury's January estimate of a
$230 million surplus for the fiscal
year ending June 30.
The statement also showed gov
ernment spending is up. The gov
ernment now expects to spend
$65.9 billion this year, $1.6 billion
more than it previously antici
pated.
