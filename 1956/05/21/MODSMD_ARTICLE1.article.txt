# More to Come?...UCLA Punishment May Trigger Further PCC Action
## 
### Dick Meister Editor 
Slapping down UCLA with the
most severe penalty ever handed
a university has placed the Pa
cific Coast Conference and its
hard-charging officials squarely
in the glare of the spotlight of
publicity which is certain not to
dim until every school in the con
ference has been thoroughly in
vestigated.
In "fining" UCLA the equiva
lent of $100,000 and banning the
university from the Rose Bowl
for three years the PCC chiefs
have brought out loud howls of
"what about the other guy?"
UCLA Chancellor Raymond B.
Allen said he helped PCC Com
missioner Victor O. Schmidt ob
tain the data on the UCLA boost
er clubs, which led to the punish
ment, "under the explicit under
standing with the clubs that the

information would be considered
by the conference along with the
results of similar investigations
of booster clubs at all other in
stitutions in the conference."
Even Harvey Knox joined the
act. "Why should the Pacific
Coast Conference penalize the
boys at UCLA? . . . USC and
California are just as guilty,"
said the outspoken Mr. Knox.
Bruin coach Red Sanders said,
"I believe sincerely that we are
operating as least as honestly as
any other member in the confer
ence." Despite persisting rumors
that Sanders' job is in jeopardy,
as well as that of Chancellor
Allen, the obviously edgy coach
said last night in Victoria, B.C.
that "I don't necessarily feel my
job is in jeopardy."
Here at Stanford Athletic pub
licist Don Liebendorfer said,
"We welcome any and all inves

tigation, and if we're wrong in
any way we'll be very happy to
clean up any spots as fast as we
can."
He noted that President Wal
lace Sterling has set the pattern
for Stanford athletics in line with
the fact that Stanford was an
outstanding educational institu
tion long before it became an
athletic power. Today the Uni
versity remains that same out
standing educational institution
as well as being a power in PCC
athletics.
Saturday, only a few minutes
after the PCC ban on UCLA had
been officially announced, Presi
dent Sterling told an alumni
gathering that "violation of the
code is a dishonest act . . . we at
Stanford have set our faces
against this [violation) —win,
lose or draw."
"As long as the present code

is in existence, it is a covenant
among members of the confer
ence. There have been knowl
edgeable violations of the code by
some universities."
The President did not name the
universities to which he was re
fering.
Sterling's counterpart at the
University of California, Robert
Gordon Sproul, has declined to
comment, saying only that he
will make a statement in a few
days when he has studied the
case.
(He has asked the conference
for a letter of particulars).
Latest word from conference
officials in Victoria hints that
there will be no more severe
crackdowns at the session but a
United Press observer said, "Con
ference officials are so secretive
about what they are doing any
thing could happen."

At a PCC coaches meeting Cali
fornia mentor Pappy Waldorf
brought out one of his special
limericks in honor of the UCLA
ruckus. "This one was a dandy,"
said the United Press, "but a
shade on the risque side for
print."
Waldorf did say that he
thought it was "too bad the con
ference has to handle rule viola
tions in a piecemeal fashion." He
said he thought it better to con
sider all the troubles at once
rather than string out the painful
procedures.
When UCLA officials sat down
to take stock of the "heaviest
ever" penalty they found them
selves faced with the following
penalties and complaints:
• They were banned from par
ticipating in Rose Bowl shares
through 1959 (this amounts to
about $85,000) and the Associ

ated Students of UCLA were as
sessed $15,000 because UCLA
Chancellor Allen refused confer
ence commissioner Schmidt the
opportunity to investigate
charges of "under-the-table pay"
to Bruin football players.
• They were banned from win
ning a conference or national
championship in any sport or
from participating in any post
season or NCAA event.
• UCLA cannot participate in
any national TV contract after
the 1956 game against USC.
• They were placed on proba
tion, the period beginning Aug. 1,
1956 and lasting until July 1,
1959.
• UCLA was disallowed any
contact between prospective
athletes and the university boost
er clubs (the "Bruin Bench" and
"The Young Men's Club of West
wood"). They were the groups

responsible for furnishing illegal
athletic aid to Bruin athletes.
(The Commissioner said he had
asked to see the clubs' books "on
many occasions during the last
seven years," but had been re
fused.)
• They were taken to task for
laxity in the employment pro
gram for UCLA athletes, who
were not required to put in all
the work time for which they
were paid; for unearned pay
ments to junior college athletes
apparently committed to UCLA;
for athletic staff members know
ingly co-operating in such activ
ity; and for failing to identify
students who were aided.
• The PCC noted that the pro
bation would only end if UCLA
proved it could mend its ways
by the July 1959 date.
PCC officials had frequently
warned UCLA that the booster

clubs were violating conference
rules, but the violations contin
ued.
The case against UCLA first
broke out into widespread
knowledge this past March when
George Stephenson, former Bru
in gridder, told Commissioner
Schmidt that he had seen all the
violations for which UCLA was
subsequently charged.
Stephenson's charges corrobo
rated those presented the com
missioner by other athletes and
observers over a period of
years.
Earlier this month the officials
"fined" the University of Wash
ington $53,000.
The PCC meetings will con
tinue this week with every con
ference school cocking an anx
ious and perhaps anticipatory
eye toward the north and Vic
toria, B. C.

ference has been thoroughly in
vestigated.
In "fining" UCLA the equiva
lent of $100,000 and banning the
university from the Rose Bowl
for three years the PCC chiefs
have brought out loud howls of
"what about the other guy?"
UCLA Chancellor Raymond B.
Allen said he helped PCC Com
missioner Victor O. Schmidt ob
tain the data on the UCLA boost
er clubs, which led to the punish
ment, "under the explicit under
standing with the clubs that the

information would be considered
by the conference along with the
results of similar investigations
of booster clubs at all other in
stitutions in the conference."
Even Harvey Knox joined the
act. "Why should the Pacific
Coast Conference penalize the
boys at UCLA? . . . USC and
California are just as guilty,"
said the outspoken Mr. Knox.
Bruin coach Red Sanders said,
"I believe sincerely that we are
operating as least as honestly as
any other member in the confer
ence." Despite persisting rumors
that Sanders' job is in jeopardy,
as well as that of Chancellor
Allen, the obviously edgy coach
said last night in Victoria, B.C.
that "I don't necessarily feel my
job is in jeopardy."
Here at Stanford Athletic pub
licist Don Liebendorfer said,
"We welcome any and all inves

tigation, and if we're wrong in
any way we'll be very happy to
clean up any spots as fast as we
can."
He noted that President Wal
lace Sterling has set the pattern
for Stanford athletics in line with
the fact that Stanford was an
outstanding educational institu
tion long before it became an
athletic power. Today the Uni
versity remains that same out
standing educational institution
as well as being a power in PCC
athletics.
Saturday, only a few minutes
after the PCC ban on UCLA had
been officially announced, Presi
dent Sterling told an alumni
gathering that "violation of the
code is a dishonest act . . . we at
Stanford have set our faces
against this [violation) —win,
lose or draw."
"As long as the present code

is in existence, it is a covenant
among members of the confer
ence. There have been knowl
edgeable violations of the code by
some universities."
The President did not name the
universities to which he was re
fering.
Sterling's counterpart at the
University of California, Robert
Gordon Sproul, has declined to
comment, saying only that he
will make a statement in a few
days when he has studied the
case.
(He has asked the conference
for a letter of particulars).
Latest word from conference
officials in Victoria hints that
there will be no more severe
crackdowns at the session but a
United Press observer said, "Con
ference officials are so secretive
about what they are doing any
thing could happen."

At a PCC coaches meeting Cali
fornia mentor Pappy Waldorf
brought out one of his special
limericks in honor of the UCLA
ruckus. "This one was a dandy,"
said the United Press, "but a
shade on the risque side for
print."
Waldorf did say that he
thought it was "too bad the con
ference has to handle rule viola
tions in a piecemeal fashion." He
said he thought it better to con
sider all the troubles at once
rather than string out the painful
procedures.
When UCLA officials sat down
to take stock of the "heaviest
ever" penalty they found them
selves faced with the following
penalties and complaints:
• They were banned from par
ticipating in Rose Bowl shares
through 1959 (this amounts to
about $85,000) and the Associ

ated Students of UCLA were as
sessed $15,000 because UCLA
Chancellor Allen refused confer
ence commissioner Schmidt the
opportunity to investigate
charges of "under-the-table pay"
to Bruin football players.
• They were banned from win
ning a conference or national
championship in any sport or
from participating in any post
season or NCAA event.
• UCLA cannot participate in
any national TV contract after
the 1956 game against USC.
• They were placed on proba
tion, the period beginning Aug. 1,
1956 and lasting until July 1,
1959.
• UCLA was disallowed any
contact between prospective
athletes and the university boost
er clubs (the "Bruin Bench" and
"The Young Men's Club of West
wood"). They were the groups

responsible for furnishing illegal
athletic aid to Bruin athletes.
(The Commissioner said he had
asked to see the clubs' books "on
many occasions during the last
seven years," but had been re
fused.)
• They were taken to task for
laxity in the employment pro
gram for UCLA athletes, who
were not required to put in all
the work time for which they
were paid; for unearned pay
ments to junior college athletes
apparently committed to UCLA;
for athletic staff members know
ingly co-operating in such activ
ity; and for failing to identify
students who were aided.
• The PCC noted that the pro
bation would only end if UCLA
proved it could mend its ways
by the July 1959 date.
PCC officials had frequently
warned UCLA that the booster

clubs were violating conference
rules, but the violations contin
ued.
The case against UCLA first
broke out into widespread
knowledge this past March when
George Stephenson, former Bru
in gridder, told Commissioner
Schmidt that he had seen all the
violations for which UCLA was
subsequently charged.
Stephenson's charges corrobo
rated those presented the com
missioner by other athletes and
observers over a period of
years.
Earlier this month the officials
"fined" the University of Wash
ington $53,000.
The PCC meetings will con
tinue this week with every con
ference school cocking an anx
ious and perhaps anticipatory
eye toward the north and Vic
toria, B. C.

have brought out loud howls of
"what about the other guy?"
UCLA Chancellor Raymond B.
Allen said he helped PCC Com

tain the data on the UCLA boost
er clubs, which led to the punish
ment, "under the explicit under
standing with the clubs that the

information would be considered
by the conference along with the
results of similar investigations
of booster clubs at all other in
stitutions in the conference."
Even Harvey Knox joined the
act. "Why should the Pacific
Coast Conference penalize the
boys at UCLA? . . . USC and
California are just as guilty,"
said the outspoken Mr. Knox.
Bruin coach Red Sanders said,
"I believe sincerely that we are
operating as least as honestly as
any other member in the confer

that Sanders' job is in jeopardy,
as well as that of Chancellor
Allen, the obviously edgy coach
said last night in Victoria, B.C.
that "I don't necessarily feel my

Here at Stanford Athletic pub
licist Don Liebendorfer said,
"We welcome any and all inves

clean up any spots as fast as we
can."
He noted that President Wal
lace Sterling has set the pattern
for Stanford athletics in line with
the fact that Stanford was an
outstanding educational institu
tion long before it became an
athletic power. Today the Uni
versity remains that same out
standing educational institution
as well as being a power in PCC
athletics.
Saturday, only a few minutes
after the PCC ban on UCLA had
been officially announced, Presi
dent Sterling told an alumni
gathering that "violation of the
code is a dishonest act . . . we at
Stanford have set our faces
against this [violation) —win,
lose or draw."
"As long as the present code

is in existence, it is a covenant
among members of the confer
ence. There have been knowl
edgeable violations of the code by
some universities."
The President did not name the
universities to which he was re
fering.
Sterling's counterpart at the
University of California, Robert
Gordon Sproul, has declined to
comment, saying only that he
will make a statement in a few
days when he has studied the
case.
(He has asked the conference
for a letter of particulars).
Latest word from conference
officials in Victoria hints that
there will be no more severe
crackdowns at the session but a
United Press observer said, "Con
ference officials are so secretive
about what they are doing any
thing could happen."

At a PCC coaches meeting Cali
fornia mentor Pappy Waldorf
brought out one of his special
limericks in honor of the UCLA
ruckus. "This one was a dandy,"
said the United Press, "but a
shade on the risque side for
print."
Waldorf did say that he
thought it was "too bad the con
ference has to handle rule viola
tions in a piecemeal fashion." He
said he thought it better to con
sider all the troubles at once
rather than string out the painful
procedures.
When UCLA officials sat down
to take stock of the "heaviest
ever" penalty they found them
selves faced with the following
penalties and complaints:
• They were banned from par
ticipating in Rose Bowl shares
through 1959 (this amounts to
about $85,000) and the Associ

ated Students of UCLA were as
sessed $15,000 because UCLA
Chancellor Allen refused confer
ence commissioner Schmidt the
opportunity to investigate
charges of "under-the-table pay"
to Bruin football players.
• They were banned from win
ning a conference or national
championship in any sport or
from participating in any post
season or NCAA event.
• UCLA cannot participate in
any national TV contract after
the 1956 game against USC.
• They were placed on proba
tion, the period beginning Aug. 1,
1956 and lasting until July 1,
1959.
• UCLA was disallowed any
contact between prospective
athletes and the university boost
er clubs (the "Bruin Bench" and
"The Young Men's Club of West
wood"). They were the groups

responsible for furnishing illegal
athletic aid to Bruin athletes.
(The Commissioner said he had
asked to see the clubs' books "on
many occasions during the last
seven years," but had been re
fused.)
• They were taken to task for
laxity in the employment pro
gram for UCLA athletes, who
were not required to put in all
the work time for which they
were paid; for unearned pay
ments to junior college athletes
apparently committed to UCLA;
for athletic staff members know
ingly co-operating in such activ
ity; and for failing to identify
students who were aided.
• The PCC noted that the pro
bation would only end if UCLA
proved it could mend its ways
by the July 1959 date.
PCC officials had frequently
warned UCLA that the booster

clubs were violating conference
rules, but the violations contin
ued.
The case against UCLA first
broke out into widespread
knowledge this past March when
George Stephenson, former Bru
in gridder, told Commissioner
Schmidt that he had seen all the
violations for which UCLA was
subsequently charged.
Stephenson's charges corrobo
rated those presented the com
missioner by other athletes and
observers over a period of
years.
Earlier this month the officials
"fined" the University of Wash
ington $53,000.
The PCC meetings will con
tinue this week with every con
ference school cocking an anx
ious and perhaps anticipatory
eye toward the north and Vic
toria, B. C.
Slapping down UCLA with the
most severe penalty ever handed
a university has placed the Pa
cific Coast Conference and its
hard-charging officials squarely
in the glare of the spotlight of
publicity which is certain not to
dim until every school in the con
ference has been thoroughly in
vestigated.
