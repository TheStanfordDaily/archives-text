# Fallout Hits S.F., Reports KZSU
## 
### 
For those who last night
packed their bags for safer
places â€” relax: KZSU's news
broadcast reporting black radio
active clouds drifting toward
San Francisco from yesterday's
Bikini atoll 11-homh test was a
fake.
Lloyd Ilownton, a graduate
journalism student, was the
modern-day Orson Welles who
performed the "psychological
experiment." His social psychol
ogy class required an experi
ment on rumor, and Ilownton
decided his Sunday night KZSIJ
news program was the perfect
place to perform it.
The object, KZSU manager
Terry Bateman said, was to find
out how many people would call
up about the broadcast and how
the story would change from
person to person.
