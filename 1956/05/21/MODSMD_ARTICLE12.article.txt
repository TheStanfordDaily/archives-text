# Sterling Asserts SU Enrollment 'Great Problem'
## Half of Men, Two-fifths of Women Applicants Refused 1956 Admission 
### Wally Simpson 
Enrollment constitutes the greatest problem of Stanford now and
in the years to come. President J. E. Wallace Sterling said in an
address at the Alumni Conference Saturday.
One out of every two scholastically eligible men and three out of
every five eligible women for next year's freshmen class were re-

fused admission, Sterling said.
This is in contrast to 1951, when
every eligible man who applied
and seven out of every eight
eligible women were accepted as
freshmen.
Sterling said the administration
is setting up an enrollment con
stant. Under this constant Stan
fords' enrollment will hold to a
level of one-third of one percent
of the total national college and
university enrollment. Following
this constant, the anticipated en
rollment in 1960 would be 9660, and
in 1965 will be 11.960.
Increased Enrollment
This increased enrollment will
raise some policy problems, said
Sterling. "It seems wisest to us to
hold the undergraduate enrollment
to the present level." As far as the
Stanford ratio is concerned, Ster
ling said, "Men will continue to
enjoy a numerical advantage—the
women, a matrimonial advantage."
The keen competition for faculty
members is another problem fac
ing the University, Sterling said.
This competition is not only be
tween colleges and universities.
In recent years there has also been
competition between colleges and
universities, on the one hand, and
industry on the other. Salaries, he
said, are no doubt a great induce
ment for attracting quality faculty
men.
Faculty Salaries
"There is absolutely no moral
justification for the level of fac
ulty salaries that exists in this
country," said Sterling. In the last
five years salaries have been in
creased up to 35 per cent, but still
the average salary for a full pro
fessor is less than $9000.
Sterling opened his address by
enumerating the highlights of the
present school year. This year, he
said, was the first time that a for
mal academic convocation was
held. It was organized and stimu
lated by the students themselves.
Said Sterling, "This bids fair to be
a new institution at the Univer
sity."
More than 1100 alumni attended
the conference, at which Dr. Wil
liam L. Rogers of San Francisco,
who was graduated from Stanford
in 1923 and received the M.D. de
gree in 1926. was elected president
of the Alumni Association for next
year.

country," said Sterling. In the last
five years salaries have been in
creased up to 35 per cent, but still
the average salary for a full pro
fessor is less than $9000.
Sterling opened his address by
enumerating the highlights of the
present school year. This year, he
said, was the first time that a for
mal academic convocation was
held. It was organized and stimu
lated by the students themselves.
Said Sterling, "This bids fair to be
a new institution at the Univer
sity."
More than 1100 alumni attended
the conference, at which Dr. Wil
liam L. Rogers of San Francisco,
who was graduated from Stanford
in 1923 and received the M.D. de
gree in 1926. was elected president
of the Alumni Association for next
year.
Enrollment constitutes the greatest problem of Stanford now and
in the years to come. President J. E. Wallace Sterling said in an
address at the Alumni Conference Saturday.
One out of every two scholastically eligible men and three out of
every five eligible women for next year's freshmen class were re-

fused admission, Sterling said.
This is in contrast to 1951, when
every eligible man who applied
and seven out of every eight
eligible women were accepted as
freshmen.
Sterling said the administration
is setting up an enrollment con
stant. Under this constant Stan
fords' enrollment will hold to a
level of one-third of one percent
of the total national college and
university enrollment. Following
this constant, the anticipated en
rollment in 1960 would be 9660, and
in 1965 will be 11.960.
Increased Enrollment
This increased enrollment will
raise some policy problems, said
Sterling. "It seems wisest to us to
hold the undergraduate enrollment
to the present level." As far as the
Stanford ratio is concerned, Ster
ling said, "Men will continue to
enjoy a numerical advantage—the
women, a matrimonial advantage."
The keen competition for faculty
members is another problem fac
ing the University, Sterling said.
This competition is not only be
tween colleges and universities.
In recent years there has also been
competition between colleges and
universities, on the one hand, and
industry on the other. Salaries, he
said, are no doubt a great induce
ment for attracting quality faculty
men.
Faculty Salaries
"There is absolutely no moral
justification for the level of fac
ulty salaries that exists in this
country," said Sterling. In the last
five years salaries have been in
creased up to 35 per cent, but still
the average salary for a full pro
fessor is less than $9000.
