# Men's Rooting Section at UC Is Abolished
## 
### 
The traditional men's rooting
section at the University of Cali
fornia has been abolished in the
wake of last week's rampaging
panty raids on sorority houses
and women's dormitories.
Action came at a meeting of the
executive committee of the Asso
ciated Students Thursday night.
The committee, after prolonged
discussion, voted 8-6 to scrap the
men's rooting section, which was
first organized in 1899.
The rooting section, long hold
"a source of trouble" by univer
sity officials, was told to watch
its behavior two years ago.
The action was described as an
attempt to eliminate "a source of
trouble for a number of years"
by Chancellor Clark Kerr, who
further commented:
"Students traditionally have
held great responsibility for the
conduct of student affairs. This
question lies primarily within
their area . . . some corrective
measures have been imperative."
Beginning in fall, the cheering
section will be integrated, with
men and women students sitting
together.
Meanwhile, university and stu
dent authorities continued a check
into the devastating raid on soror
ity houses and women's dormi
tories that caused an estimated
$10,000 to $20,000 damage.
The Daily Californian, campus
newspaper, urged student groups
to post a $500 bond with police as
a guarantee against future out
breaks.
