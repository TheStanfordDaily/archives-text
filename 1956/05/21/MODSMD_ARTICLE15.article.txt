# Don't Stop Now

The Pacific Coast Conference lias made the
second drastic move in its clean-up of PCC
football. As in the rase of the University of
\\ aTiington, the '"fine" and ban slapped on
I CLA Saturday were thoroughly deserved.
l\ow that two schools have been punished for
their gross violations of the PCC football eode
we are wondering who will he next. We know
who should be next, as does anyone who has
had any connection with PCC athletics.
If the other code violating schools are not
punished the UCLA and Washington punish
ments will stand as isolated cases of discrimina
tion and nothing more.
If the other guilty schools are not slapped
down then all the UCLA and Washington pun
ishments will prove is that it doesn't pay to gel
caught.
It is more than coincidental that the two
schools which have been getting most of the
headlines about dishonesty in athletics should
be the first two to be jpunished. Thanks to Har
vey Knox the UCLA situation has been getting
more than its share of publicity. Hut for once
the loud-mouth iYlr. Knox is beginning to talk
some sense when he says "USC and (!al are just
as gui Ity. 11
Only the most nai've and uninformed among
us will doubt that statement. Harvey's com
ment is pure sour grapes but it is also pure
truth.
Then there was John Cherberg and Washing
ton's "slush fund," in sports headlines for
months.
We hope the PCC Officials finish up their

job and punish all the culprits, not just those
who have beeu given the glare of poor publicity.
If the PCC actions end now the only conclusions
to come to is that the PCC chiefs have acted
because of poor publicity, not because rules
were broken.
The PCC codes have been broken for many
years with the officials apparently closing their
eyes to obvious violations and only acting when
publicity reared its head.
Now they have the golden opportunity to do
otherwise, to enforce the code equally among
all conference members.
Until the code is equitably enforced the Coast
Conference and its rules will remain what they
have always seemed to many observers, the
height of hypocrisy, with each school interpre
ting them as they, as individual schools, see fit.
Some schools have proved themselves more
honest than others, now the conference chiefs
can step in and show them what honesty really
entails, since many don't seem to know.
Otherwise they might as well break up the
PCC and let each member go its own separate
way, with those who think football should he
a,means of financing their universities install
ing their own "win at all costs" code and with
the more enlightened ones instituting a code
which will keep athletics in it* proper role as
an integral part of educational training.
We hope they will enforce the code.
They must enforce it, for as President Wal
lace Sterling has commented, "To engage in
knowledgeable violations of the eode is to en
gage in the corruption and not the enlighten
ment of youth."
