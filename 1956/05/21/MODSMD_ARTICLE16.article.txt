# Only Themselves to Blame...

University of California got the ax, but it
wasn't Stanford that gave them the lethal blow.
It was the executive organ of their own stu
dent government that decided to abolish the
long-standing tradition of the men's rooting sec
tion and with it what ASUC President Bob
Hamilton termed "a tradition . . . that has out
lived its usefulness."
We are sorry to see the color and sparkle of
the California rooting section dulled, for we
have enjoyed for many years the stunts and
spirit of the Blue and Gold across the turf on
Big Game day.
\\ hat disturbs 11s more, though, is the fact
that the men at Cal have failed too many times
to keep their bubbling enthusiasm within the
bounds of good taste and propriety, bringing
upon themselves just punishment.
It is not our intent to cast our eyes across the
Bay with a look of "holier than thou," but
rather to emphasize the serious repercussions
that arise from enthusiasm unlempered by re
straint.

Condemning mob action is easy. We look at
the results of the riots earlier in the year at the
University of Alabama and the destruction
caused by the IJC panty raiders last week, and
it is not difficult to say it is wrong, that it easts
a large question-mark around the degree to
which students accept and honor the responsi
bility they must assume if they are to justify
the faith placed in them by university admin
istrators.
It is more difficult to understand mob psy
chology and iry to temper the swelling emotion
of a crowd which says and does things that at
other times would be cast aside as immature
and degrading.
Student government at UC faced the problem
of actual and potential mob action on their
campus and, in an attempt to remove one of
the danger spoU, liquidated a cherished tradi
tion.
The students have little reason to complain.
They brought it on themselves.
