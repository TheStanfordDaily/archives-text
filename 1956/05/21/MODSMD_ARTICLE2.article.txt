A MOTLEY CREW of Hammer and Coffin mem
bers, looking their best, make another fruitless
attempt to belittle The Daily at Spring: Sing.
They sang;, to the tune of the Air Force Song::
"Breakfast time, goody, another Daily; frauding'
facts, twisting the truth. Stellar staff, all of them

bonehead writers, smelling had, looking uncouth.
Toilet time, flushing another Daily down with
one terrible roar. If g-ives us pain, so down the
drain with the dirty Daily editor." Naturally,
they didn't win.

A MOTLEY CREW of Hammer and Coffin mem
bers, looking their best, make another fruitless
attempt to belittle The Daily at Spring: Sing.
They sang;, to the tune of the Air Force Song::
"Breakfast time, goody, another Daily; frauding'
facts, twisting the truth. Stellar staff, all of them

bonehead writers, smelling had, looking uncouth.
Toilet time, flushing another Daily down with
one terrible roar. If g-ives us pain, so down the
drain with the dirty Daily editor." Naturally,
they didn't win.
