Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Jerry Goldberg's letter in The Daily headed
"In Defense of Big-Time Football on The Farm,"
raises some serious questions. Mr. Goldberg says
that the University's policy of giving athletes, es
pecially football players, priority in getting hash
ing jobs is justified because: l) Football is es
sential to school spirit and, consequently, to Stan
ford's undergraduate enrollment: 2) The revenue
from football is necessary to the University finan
cially; 3) Football "wins friends" for Stanford.
Mr. Goldberg may be right; the fact that the
University gives athletes a priority in getting hash
ing jobs seems to support him. If this is true, stu
dents and faculty members who take some pride
in maintaining that Stanford "always places aca
demic considerations first" haven't got much to
stand on.
It appears that Stanford's policy does not differ
in principle, but only in degree, from a school
like UCLA (mentioned by Mr. Goldberg), where
athletes are given special privileges. UCLA gives
a football player a $10()-a-month job; Stanford of
fers only $35.
The fact that football is providing morale,
money, and friends for the alma mater isn't going
to be much consolation to a physics major or pre
law student who fails to get a hashing job because
it has ben given arbitrarily to an athlete, merely
because he's good for the University's public re
lations. '
There is only one fair way in which to give hash
ing jobs- on the basis of financial need and per
sonal merit. If the University feels that "big
time" football is essential to its welfare (and this
is highly debatable, depending on your definition
of "welfare"), then it should find other ways of
financing its players.
Ways that will not penalize worthy students
merely because they don't play football well
enough to perform for the paying public.
(Incidentally, I haven't been embittered by be
ing turned down for a hashing job. I've never ap
plied for one. I'm merely interested in this ques
tion as a matter of principle.)

What Do YOU Think?
Editor, The Daily:
1 have been attending Stanford for a number of
years ,and 1 have always been very amiable
towards editorial policy. The latest "What Do
YOU Think" column, however, was very poorly

handled. Of the eleven students questioned, six
were Branner freshmen.
Now the Lord knows I have nothing against
Branner freshmen, but it seems to me that The
Daily could range a little farther afield than the
doors of a freshmen girls dormitory, especially
considering the present stir in West Coast college
football circles.
The Daily may not claim that their public
opinion polls represent the Stanford student body
as a whole, but the intimation is there. It seems
to me a wider cross-representation could be ob
tained in future polls, and not just the opinions of
a few uninformed freshmen women.
11. Bradley Oshorn
Editor's Note: Although it is true that six of
the eleven students whose opinions were listed in
the column were Branner freshmen they were not
the only ones questioned. The reader will note that
both sides of the question were expressed in the
quotes. This is what we consider important in
their selection—not the source of the quote hut the
opinion expressed.
We fully anticipated and hoped for such an
answer as we received and printed Friday from
Jerry Goldberg which gave the usual argument for
big-time football on the Farm, an argument which
most of us know by heart.
You are right in saying that we do not claim
that the opinion polls represent the Stanford stu
dent body as a whole. And if the intimation is
there that such is the case, it is certainly not put
there by The Daily. There are almost 7000 stu
dents at Stanford, and there are about 10 Daily
reporters.
Spring Sing Thanks
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to thank publicly all those who
contributed to the success of this year's Spring
Sing. Bill Crookston did a terrific job as master
of ceremonies, and Jane Kleerup handled publicity
extremely well. Thanks to the members of Rally
Com for all their hard work, and thanks, also to
The Daily for the good coverage they gave the
Sing.
Finally, I want to compliment the various
groups which sang last Friday night. It was the
general opinion of the audience that the-calibre of
this Spring Sing was noticeably higher than it has
been in past years. You all deserve a pat on the
back.

sential to school spirit and, consequently, to Stan
ford's undergraduate enrollment: 2) The revenue
from football is necessary to the University finan
cially; 3) Football "wins friends" for Stanford.
Mr. Goldberg may be right; the fact that the
University gives athletes a priority in getting hash
ing jobs seems to support him. If this is true, stu
dents and faculty members who take some pride
in maintaining that Stanford "always places aca
demic considerations first" haven't got much to
stand on.
It appears that Stanford's policy does not differ
in principle, but only in degree, from a school
like UCLA (mentioned by Mr. Goldberg), where
athletes are given special privileges. UCLA gives
a football player a $10()-a-month job; Stanford of
fers only $35.
The fact that football is providing morale,
money, and friends for the alma mater isn't going
to be much consolation to a physics major or pre
law student who fails to get a hashing job because
it has ben given arbitrarily to an athlete, merely
because he's good for the University's public re
lations. '
There is only one fair way in which to give hash
ing jobs- on the basis of financial need and per
sonal merit. If the University feels that "big
time" football is essential to its welfare (and this
is highly debatable, depending on your definition
of "welfare"), then it should find other ways of
financing its players.
Ways that will not penalize worthy students
merely because they don't play football well
enough to perform for the paying public.

What Do YOU Think?
Editor, The Daily:
1 have been attending Stanford for a number of
years ,and 1 have always been very amiable
towards editorial policy. The latest "What Do
YOU Think" column, however, was very poorly

handled. Of the eleven students questioned, six
were Branner freshmen.
Now the Lord knows I have nothing against
Branner freshmen, but it seems to me that The
Daily could range a little farther afield than the
doors of a freshmen girls dormitory, especially
considering the present stir in West Coast college
football circles.
The Daily may not claim that their public
opinion polls represent the Stanford student body
as a whole, but the intimation is there. It seems
to me a wider cross-representation could be ob
tained in future polls, and not just the opinions of
a few uninformed freshmen women.
11. Bradley Oshorn
Editor's Note: Although it is true that six of
the eleven students whose opinions were listed in
the column were Branner freshmen they were not
the only ones questioned. The reader will note that
both sides of the question were expressed in the
quotes. This is what we consider important in
their selection—not the source of the quote hut the
opinion expressed.
We fully anticipated and hoped for such an
answer as we received and printed Friday from
Jerry Goldberg which gave the usual argument for
big-time football on the Farm, an argument which
most of us know by heart.
You are right in saying that we do not claim
that the opinion polls represent the Stanford stu
dent body as a whole. And if the intimation is
there that such is the case, it is certainly not put
there by The Daily. There are almost 7000 stu
dents at Stanford, and there are about 10 Daily
reporters.
Spring Sing Thanks
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to thank publicly all those who
contributed to the success of this year's Spring
Sing. Bill Crookston did a terrific job as master
of ceremonies, and Jane Kleerup handled publicity
extremely well. Thanks to the members of Rally
Com for all their hard work, and thanks, also to
The Daily for the good coverage they gave the
Sing.
Finally, I want to compliment the various
groups which sang last Friday night. It was the
general opinion of the audience that the-calibre of
this Spring Sing was noticeably higher than it has
been in past years. You all deserve a pat on the
back.

ing jobs seems to support him. If this is true, stu
dents and faculty members who take some pride
in maintaining that Stanford "always places aca
demic considerations first" haven't got much to
stand on.
It appears that Stanford's policy does not differ
in principle, but only in degree, from a school
like UCLA (mentioned by Mr. Goldberg), where
athletes are given special privileges. UCLA gives
a football player a $10()-a-month job; Stanford of
fers only $35.
The fact that football is providing morale,
money, and friends for the alma mater isn't going
to be much consolation to a physics major or pre
law student who fails to get a hashing job because
it has ben given arbitrarily to an athlete, merely
because he's good for the University's public re
lations. '
There is only one fair way in which to give hash
ing jobs- on the basis of financial need and per
sonal merit. If the University feels that "big
time" football is essential to its welfare (and this
is highly debatable, depending on your definition
of "welfare"), then it should find other ways of
financing its players.
Ways that will not penalize worthy students
merely because they don't play football well
enough to perform for the paying public.
(Incidentally, I haven't been embittered by be
ing turned down for a hashing job. I've never ap
plied for one. I'm merely interested in this ques
tion as a matter of principle.)

What Do YOU Think?
Editor, The Daily:
1 have been attending Stanford for a number of
years ,and 1 have always been very amiable
towards editorial policy. The latest "What Do
YOU Think" column, however, was very poorly

handled. Of the eleven students questioned, six
were Branner freshmen.
Now the Lord knows I have nothing against
Branner freshmen, but it seems to me that The
Daily could range a little farther afield than the
doors of a freshmen girls dormitory, especially
considering the present stir in West Coast college
football circles.
The Daily may not claim that their public
opinion polls represent the Stanford student body
as a whole, but the intimation is there. It seems
to me a wider cross-representation could be ob
tained in future polls, and not just the opinions of
a few uninformed freshmen women.

Editor's Note: Although it is true that six of
the eleven students whose opinions were listed in
the column were Branner freshmen they were not
the only ones questioned. The reader will note that
both sides of the question were expressed in the
quotes. This is what we consider important in
their selection—not the source of the quote hut the
opinion expressed.
We fully anticipated and hoped for such an
answer as we received and printed Friday from
Jerry Goldberg which gave the usual argument for
big-time football on the Farm, an argument which
most of us know by heart.
You are right in saying that we do not claim
that the opinion polls represent the Stanford stu
dent body as a whole. And if the intimation is
there that such is the case, it is certainly not put
there by The Daily. There are almost 7000 stu
dents at Stanford, and there are about 10 Daily
reporters.
Spring Sing Thanks
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to thank publicly all those who
contributed to the success of this year's Spring
Sing. Bill Crookston did a terrific job as master
of ceremonies, and Jane Kleerup handled publicity
extremely well. Thanks to the members of Rally
Com for all their hard work, and thanks, also to
The Daily for the good coverage they gave the
Sing.
Finally, I want to compliment the various
groups which sang last Friday night. It was the
general opinion of the audience that the-calibre of
this Spring Sing was noticeably higher than it has
been in past years. You all deserve a pat on the
back.
