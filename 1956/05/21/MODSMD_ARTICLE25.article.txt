# Taylor Calls Drills 'Best Yet' As Reds Top Whites in Finale
## Scrimmage Highlighted by Aerial Attack As Stanford Squad Wraps It Up for Season 
### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
A rugged line and strong pass
ing of Jack Taylor and Bob Nieo
let paced the Reds to a 19-7 vic
tory over the Wiiites Saturday
afternoon in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor termed the
drill "the best final spring scrim
mage in my six years at Stun
ford."
The Reds were forced to bounce
back after' John Brodie engineer
ed a 53-yard White drive to pay
dirt. Br odie hit Gordy Young once
and Joel Freis twice for complet
ed passes during the drive. After
Doug Dick sprinted 13 yards to
the eight, Young bucked over.
Dick booted the extra point.
The remainder of the first half
was played almost exclusively in
White territory. The Red line,
paced by captain Gary Van Gal
der at end, All-American Paul
Wiggin at tackle and guard Don
Manoukian, continually punched
holes for ihe Red ball-carriers and
afforded great protection for Tay
lor- and Nieolet.
The Reds drove wilhin the
White 20-yard stripe four times
before punching across.
The tally was set up when A 1
Harrington's punt from his own
end zone was partially blocked
and rolled out on the White 28.
The Reds took nine plays and a
penalty inside the two-yard line
to score. Roy Stephen leaped over
from the one on fourth down.

Jack Taylor moved the Reds 81
yards in 21 plays the first time
the Reds got the ball in the sec
ond half. The versatile sophomore
mixed passes to Carl Isaacs and
Van Galder with runs by fullback
Chuck Shea and halfback Jeri Me-
Millin to gain a first flown on the
White two.
After the Whites had hold on
three plays, and a penalty for too
much time had set the ball back
to the eight, the Reds got a break
when pass interference in the end
zone was called on their oppo
nents.
Shea took a handoff from Tay
lor and drove through left guard
for the touchdown. This gave the
victors a 12-7 lead.
The Reds' third score was set
up by Paul Wiggin and his run
ning mates in the line. After Bi o
die had worked the Whites to
their own 47, a holding penalty
moved the pigskin back to the 26.
On both of the next two plays,
the burly Red line forced Brodie
to eat the ball. The Whites had a
fourth-and-52 situation facing
them on their own five.
Young received a low, bouncing
pass from center and barely man
aged to get his kick away. It went
out of bounds on the White 18.
From this point, Nieolet passed
to Dennie Farrar for a first down
on ihe four: The freshman signal
caller then cut inside right tackle
for the final tally. Wally Honey
well converted.
