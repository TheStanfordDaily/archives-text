# Crew Captures Harback Cup; Eyes Regatta at Syracuse
## 
### 
California's first annual Harback Cup fell in the arms of the
Stanford s varsity crew Saturday after the courageous rowing eight
swept across the San Pedro finish line ahead of USC and UCLA.
Next stop for Lou Lindsey's proud shell is Syracuse, New York,
where in June Stanford competes in both the Intercollegiate Regatta
and the U. S. Olympic tryouts.
The rrojans gave the Indian number one boat a run for their
money in the varsity race. But Stanford's coxswain called an up
beat to stave off USC's last minute rush and won by half a length.
Ihe Cards junior varsity and freshman boats also won in their
respective matches against the southern schools .
Stanford, victor over Cal before bowing to Washington in Pa
cific Coast action this season, was timed at 11:06 minutes; USC at
11:08 and the Bruins at 12:04. Both the javee and frosh shells
stretched five lengths over their nearest competitor.
Coach Lindsey, who is preparing his boys for the eastern trip
commencing June 10, switched his number one boat lineup for the
Harback trophy race. Co-captain Gordy Best was stroke as usual
with Ken Riedman, No. 7; Bob Clark, No. 6; Nate Toped, No. 5; John
Schumacher, No. 4; Will Stinson, 'No. 3; Pete Haywood, No. 2; Co
captain Ron Rose, bow and Cal Gogerty, coxswain.
The University of Washington continued their winning ways
Saturday by dumping Cal's Bears by five lengths on the Oakland
Lstuary. Ihe Huskies will be the Pacific Coast's top representative
in the National Intercollegiate next month with Stanford also riding
one of the top roles.
This coming Saturday will be the last west coast appearance for
Stanford's 1956 crew association. The Cards will stage an interclass
race at their Redwood City course with the sophomore boat serving
notice in the favorites position.
