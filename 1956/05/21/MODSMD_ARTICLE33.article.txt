# New SUE Plan Not Open To Enrolled Students
## Some Advantages of Plan Will Be Available For Those Interested in Course Changes 
### 
Students currently enrolled in
the University will not be able to
change over to the new four-year
undergraduate education pro
gram, General Studies Committee
Chairman Robert Walker announ
ced last week.
But almost all the advantages
of the new plan will be made
available to old students next
year, he said. New courses recom
mended by the Study of Under
graduate Education report are be
ing set up for next year. All stu
dents may enroll.
Plans for six five-unit terminal
courses in the social sciences were
approved by the committee last
week. These courses, which will
be designated by the number 1,
are in anthropology, sociology,
economics, political science, psy
chology and geography.
Most of these subjects have
been taught in 10-unit sequences
in the past. The Lower Division
Committee has approved students
currently enrolled taking Econom
ics 1 with one of the other five
unit courses to fill social science

requirements next year, and a
similar substitution is being con
sidered in the other subjects. ,
The committee met Saturday
with representatives from the hu
manities department to consider
the establishment of similar ter
minal survey courses in the hu
manities fields.
Two other innovations to be es
tablished next year are a new
mathematics course and the sen
ior colloquia. The Mathematics 1
course will be designed for A.B.
candidates and will be a general
survey of mathematics, requiring
only high school algebra and ge
ometry as prerequisites.
The senior colloquia will prob
ably begin next winter quarter.
The two - unit discussion course
will be an A.B. requirement under
the new plan, but old students are
welcome to try it, said Walker.
The General Studies Committee
has met once a week since its or
ganization at the first of this
quarter. Its purpose is to put the
new undergraduate education pro
gram into effect and to provide a
continuous examination of the
program.
A recently innovated subcom
mittee, under the chairmanship of
Professor Leonard Strothmann, is
in charge of the advisory system.
Their purpose is twofold:
• To gear the new plan for next
year's incoming freshmen. Four
meetings are scheduled with all
advisers next week to discuss the
new system.
• To make an intensive study
of the whole advisory system and
make a comprehensive report to
the General Studies Committee.
This will probably take most of
next year.
"We are aware of problems in
the advising system," said Walk
er. He said that criticism and sug
gestions from graduating seniors
will be carefully considered.
