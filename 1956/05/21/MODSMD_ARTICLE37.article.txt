# Student Opinions to Be Collected To Improve Advisory Program
## 
### 
Members of the Student-Facul
ty Committee will start inter
viewing people in their living
groups this week and next to de
termine student opinion on the
adviser program.
The committee has been work
ing on .this problem for the past
year with the intention of im
proving the current system. One
of their suggestions, passed last
week by Legislature, was that
some academic recognition should
be given to advisers.
This would result in advisers
being able to give more time to
advising their students. At pres
ent faculty members are given no
recognition for this work, and
promotion is largely dependent on
the number and quality of pub
lished works.

A subcommittee of the General
Studies Committee has been set
up to look into the problem next
year. Many colleges and univer
sities, including Harvard, have al
ready initiated this program.
The Student-Faculty Committee
will also hold interviews for new
members on Thursday and Fri
day from 2 to 5 p.m. in the Wom
en's Clubhouse. Anyone is eligible
to try out, and sign-ups will be
available outside the ASSU office.
