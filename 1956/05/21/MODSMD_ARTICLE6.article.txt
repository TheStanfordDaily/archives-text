# Group to Give Park Proposal To Legislature
## Preserving Farm's 'Rural Atmosphere' Is Primary Concern 
### 
A group of students concerned
about the receding rural atmos
phere of the Farm will present to
ASSU Legislature a proposal to
reserve a section of Stanford
lands as a "wilderness recreation
park area." \
The idea, formulated at an in
formal meeting of a small group
of students and faculty last week,
would set aside a tract of land
near Searsville Lake for future
student use.
The area includes rough ter
rain. with hills and canyons suit
able for hiking, picnicking and
other outdoor recreation. It would
also serve as a site for the recent
ly established Stanford hostel.
The group, led by George Abel,
expressed growing concern over
the transformation of scenic Stan
ford countryside into industrial
and residential areas.
Victor K. Thompson, associate
professor of architecture, outlined
the Searsville Lake area geogra
phy. The site under consideration
is a rough semi-circle with about
a six-mile perimeter of ridge land
and is accessible by foot from
Sandhill Road.
San Francisquito Creek winds
its way at the foot of the ridge,
and a lush growth of redwoods
covers the slope. The spot is only
about a 10-minute drive from the
heart of campus and is on Stan
ford lands leased to a private
ranch.
Ideally, a reserve area would
include a strip along the creek
beginning from the campus to the
wilderness area. The park area
itself would be a six-mile strip in
the form of a horseshoe.
At present the University has
no plans for the kind of a park
wilderness envisaged by the
group. There are plans to use
nearby territory for five-acre es
tates and also to expand Sears
ville Lake.
