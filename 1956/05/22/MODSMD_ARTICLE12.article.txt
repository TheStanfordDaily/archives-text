# Female of Species Backfires (Literally) in Frog Contest
## 
### Dave Scott 
Female frogs lay eggs.
Six Stanford men can attest to this fact.
Last Friday night Rick Ruud, Steve Brown, Jim Kleerup, Maurie
Hurt, Rick Morehouse and Chuck Pilgrim realized that Stanford,
so ahly represented by Jack Squat and Dean Wiggler in last year's
28th annual frog leaping contest, was not entered for the event the
following day.
So they went to Lake Lagunita and managed to corral three of
the amphibious creatures.
The next day dawned bright and full of hope for the three Stanford
stablemates. But on the way to Angels Camp in Calaveras County
two of the bontestants became unable to compete.
So all of the Farm's hope lay on one lonely bug eyed monster.
Hundreds were watching with breathless anticipation as the Stan
ford entry squirmed nervously before making its crucial leap from
the center of the circle. The world record up to then stood at 16 feet
10 inches.
Then it happened. Stanford's pride and joy lay a half a dozen
eggs right on the spot. She gamely jumped anyway. But frog eggs
are slippery and the potential mother only cleared 2.9 feet.
The jumping contest was taken by a frog owned by a 12 year old
Oakland boy. The champion leaped to 15.9 feet. The collegiate di
vision was won by a California entry.
Stanford's she-frog's leap fell way below last year's prize entry,
Jack Squat, who cleared 10 feet 2Va inches.
In order to assurp continued amateur status of their frogs, the
owners divorced from the AAU and formed the AAA, the Association
for Amphibious Amateurs.
"That Wes Santee incident brought our distrust of the AAU," de
clared one owner.
At last contact it was not decided whether egg laying athletes
would be eligible.
