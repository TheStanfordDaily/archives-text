# UCLA Gridders Lose Year's Eligibility; Penalty Ends Careers of Eleven Juniors
## PCC Officials Levy Penalty For 'Under-the-Table' Payoffs 
### 
VICTORIA, 8.C., May 21 < UP) The Pacific Coast Conference aimed
a final kayo puncn at UCLA today when it penalized every member
of the 1955 varsity an J freshman football teams one year of eligibility
for taking "under the table" payoffs above the PCC scale of $75 a
month.
Following on the heels of a $95,000 fine against the Bruins and a

three-year ban from the Rose|
Bowl, the PCC directors put the
finishing touches on what was
termed an "out-of-hand recruiting
system."
However, the blow was some
what softened by a conference
ruling which allows a player to
decide what year he will stay off
the squad.
Thus, all members'of last year's
1955 freshman squad could join
the varsity this season, but then
sit out either their junior or sen
ior year. And a sophomore from
last season's varsity returning as
a junior either could play this
coming season or the next, but
would have to miss one of them.
All juniors from last year's Rose
Bowl team are finished.
Ineligibility Recommended
Indications were that coach Red
Sanders will huddle with his play
ers when he gets back to Los An
geles to deicde what year he needs
certain men and what year he can
do without them.
Ineligibility for the athletes was
recommended by UCLA's faculty
representative to the PCC, Dr. Jo
seph Kaplan, and was approved
by the directors.
It was the stiffest penalty as
sessed against college athletes
since West Point kicked out many
of its football stars five years ago
following the infamous "cribbing"
scandals. '
The only possibility left for the
football players to participate in
the college sport again would be
to prove that they had not re
ceived the pay.
"Guilty Till Innocent"
"They will be charged as guilty
until proven innocent," said a con
ference spokesman.
The loss of a year's eligibility
means that all 11 of the junior
members of the 1955 team that
lost to Michigan State in the Rose
Bowl will be ineligible to play
again.
Included are junior stars tail
back Ronnie Knox, blocking back
Don Shinnick, halfback Gerry Mc-
Dougall, halfback Doug Bradley,
fullback Bruce Ballard, ends Tom
Adams and Pete O'Garro, wing
back Chuck Hollaway and line
men Don Birren and Chuck Gel
fand as well as Tom Thaxter, who
failed to letter last year because
he was injured in the first game
of the season.
Frosh Available
The six lettermen who would
still have a year of eligibility de
spite loss of a year's play are
quarterback Bob Enger, guard Es
ker Harris, center Jim Matheny,
tackle Gerald Penner, center Dan
Peterson and end Hall Smith.
Eighteen members of the cham
pionship frosh team still would be
available as well as five non-let
termen from last year's squad
plus a few junior college trans
fers.
Coach Sanders was shocked by
the decision.
"They took the bone and sinew
of my team," said the coach. "I'll
probably have enough players to
field a ball club, but the humane
society will take a dim view of it."
New Transfer Rule
In other action taken this eve
ning PCC officials announced that
the transfer rule had been amend
ed to make athletes who transfer
from one member school to an
other permanently ineligible for
further athletic competition un
less he can prove the transfer was
for reasons other than athletics.
This move obviously was aimed
at ending such cases as that of
Ronnie Knox, who transferred
from California to UCLA just to
play football.
The conference made it clear
that this was designed to end
"tramp athletes" from moving
from one school to another. How
ever, the conference said if a stu
dent who is an athlete transfers
from one school to another be
cause of academic reasons, then
he will have to sit out only one
year before becoming eligible for
athletic competition at his new
school, providing seven other con
ference schools, excluding the
school he transferred from and
| the school he goes to, endorse fur-
I ther athletic competition by a
' unanimous vote.
