# Where Are the Cries?

Shouts of "Tyranny in tiif. Southland!"
have been smothered, not so much hy tin* dic
tutorial conduct of the UCLA administration
as hy the cold fog on an inert and languid
student body.
A weakened student council has made mod
erate attempts to prevent the Goliath of Chan
cellor Raymond B. Allen's regime from stomp
ing out the last gasp of student will, while the
intended value of student opinion, The Daily
Bruin, has remained ominously silent on the
whole issue.
This lack of determined action on the part
of the leaders may he partially justified hy the
fact that any expression of criticism against the
administration is either censored, punished or
ignored.
liut in their failure to register any animated
protest against a flagrant usurpation of their
rights, the students are in a sense giving passive
support to the administration's allegation that
they have been derelict in the assumption of
their duties.
Failure to protei# against such dictatorial
encroachment on student government is just
as much a negation of their responsibility as
are neglect and misconduct in the actual execu
tion of their official duties.
It is possible the administration had good
cause to doubt the competence of the present
student government; but, instead of cooperat
ing with its leaders to fortify its foundations,
the administration only further undermined

the debilitated sense of responsibility that now
exists in the esclielons of the UCLA student
government.
The very essence of student government is
that it is an amateur effort. Mistakes will hap
pen, but if the students become aware of the
faith placed in them and of the importance
of their task, the quality of leadership will not
sink to the depths it has at IJCLA.
No one can deny that, technically, govern
ment by students is a privilege and that there
is no law prohibiting university administrations
from dissolving the privileges they created in
the first place; but these privileges have be
come so valuable an ad junct to the American
educational system that their revocation would
deprive students of the opportunity to learn
the rudiments of civil government in a rela
tively idealistic atmosphere.
For two years the UCLA administration has
directed the editorial policy of The Daily
Bruin. Last month they ousted the student body
president, invalidated elections, removed elect
ed representatives from the student council
and, in total disregard of student opinion, put
through a directive which would require AS
UCLA constitutional revision.
And for the time being they have killed stu
dent government at UCLA. It will remain dead
until the students rise up and fight.
If they remain silent and inert, there is no
reason why they should be handed the right
to govern themselves.
