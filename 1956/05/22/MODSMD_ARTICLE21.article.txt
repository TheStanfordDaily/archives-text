# Petty Feuding
## 
### 
Despite a "double crackdown' 1 threat from
Congress,'the feud between the Army and the
Air Force is moving into full swing. After years
of mild sniping, the armed services are coming
out with downright condemnation of each
other.
112 or the moment the squabble centers around
the Nike missile, the Army's principal anti-air
craft weapon, which the Air Force indignantly
• alls "unsuitable for the anti-aircraft defense
of the United States."
Congress and Secretary of Defense Charles E.

Wilson have voiced strong disapproval of this
"public airing of petty jealousies."
As far as making public these mutual accusa
tions goes, there is no reason for silence. It is
better to get these so-called "petty jealousies"
out in the open now than to allow them to cause
a major schism in the future, possibly when
united action is even more urgently needed.
Maybe both sides have valid criticisms, but
their methods of presenting them have certain
ly appeared childish in the light of their re
sponsible positions of trust.
