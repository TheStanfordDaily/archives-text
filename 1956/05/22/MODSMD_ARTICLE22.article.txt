## U. of Washington Students Forced To Pay Former Coach Full Salary 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
The University of Washington has begun
handing down the same type of directives to
their student council as has become common
at UCLA.
Last week ASUW was ordered by the univer
sity president to pay former football coach
John Cherberg a full year's salary, overruling
a student decision to pay only half the amount.
In handing down the directive, the university
president made use of an attorney general's de
rision that the student government is "an arm
and agency of the university."
Cherberg, who asserts he was granted a one-
Near oral contract by the Board of Regents, will
receive his full 1956 pay of $12,000 rather than
a $6000 settlement proposed by ASUW, who
supposedly is in charge of such matters.

The student, body at Texas A & M decided
last week to continue racial segregation by a
rote of 1066 to 620. The Student Senate had
ret/nested a referendum to determine student
o/>inion on the subject.
Previously the Senate had voted against seg
regation by a margin of 23 to 7. Students pro
tested that this wasn't a representative view,
and, sadly enough, they seem to have been
light.

A professor at Hunter College, I\eiv York,
has compiled ten ways to get through college
without even trying. A sampling:
• Bring the professor news clippings dealing
with his subject. If you don't find clippings
dealing with his subject, bring in clippings at
random. He thinks everything deals with his
subject.
• If you must sleep, arrange to he called at
the end of the hour. It creates an unfavorable
impression if the rest of the class has left and
you sit there alone, dozing.
<• Be sure the book you read during lecture
looks like a book from the course. If you do
math in psychology class, ami vice versa, match
the books for size and color.

• Avoid announcing that you have found the
answer to a question the professor couldn't an
swer — and in your younger brother's second
reader, at that.

A seven-foot boa constrictor caused some con
sternation at the University of Texas last week
when it was discovered that he was missing
from his cage at a fraternity house where a
biology major was keeping him.
Although the snake, named Crazy Boy, had
just been fed and wasn't full-grown, it was
feared that he might harm a cat or a dog, or
children who tried 1o pick him up.
However, a sigh of relief was breathed bv
the community when Crazy Hoy ivas found the
next morning imprisoned in a garbage can dan
gling from high atop a flagpole—a humiliating
ordeal for such a stati'ly reptile.

A French poodle recently captured 405 votes
and ran third in a student council election at
the University of British Columbia.
The dog was entered as Kiki Graham by a
student who wanted to prove that voters do not
investigate the background of candidates or
know much about them in the first place.

The University of Michigan Daily has discov
ered just what police think of college students
by sneaking a look at an officer's report of a
campus commotion:
"The pinheads in South Quad were attempt
ing to shout down the pinheads in West Quad.
. . . A number of firecrackers were thrown and
insults were yelled at officers. . . .
"In general, these subjects were displaying
their ignorance, which is not necessary to any
one involved with this type of individual.
"Considered the source, drove away and left
them to en joy this gay type nf sport."
