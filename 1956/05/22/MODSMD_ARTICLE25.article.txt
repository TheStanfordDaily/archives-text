# Con Home Story—Tradition, Growth
## 
### Sally Trapnell 
The Con Home Drive being held
this week to raise money for the
Stanford Convalescent Home con
tinues an annual tradition follow
ed by Stanford students since its
founding in 1917.
The Con Home was opened in
1917 as the "campus auxiliary to
Clinic" and grew ra
pidly until today it covers 27 acres
and can accommodate 80 children.
Since its founding, more than
5500 children of all races and
creeds have been cared for at the
home. The patients come mostly
from San Francisco clinics, but
also are admitted from all over
the West.
The home is for children be
tween the ages of two and 12 who
are recovering from non-contagi
ous diseases. Most patients are
victims of polio, rheumatic fever
or asthma.
Rest Is Treatment
For some, suffering from such
diseases as malnutrition or rick
ets, fresh air, good food and rest
are the main treatment.
The Convalescent Home is
unique, since it is the only insti
tution of its kind located on a
college or university campus in
the United States.
The vast majority of children
cared for at the home are com
plete charity cases. Costs of $13
to $25 a day for each one's care
are met by the Con Home drive,
civic organizations, charity agen
cies and six auxiliaries to ihe
home in the Bay Area.
Most patients stay at the home
an average of three months.
Schooling is provided for those of
school age by the Palo Alto School
Board.
Children may also join such or
ganizations as the Cubs, Brown
ies, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
The home is staffed by about
50 people directed by Mrs. Ruth

S. Atwood, who has been director
since the home was founded. All
the doctors donate their services.
Sam McDonald has been one of
the best - known figures at the
home, serving as its patron saint.
He retired two years ago as su
perintendent of athletic buildings
and grounds, after 50 years as a
Stanford employee.
Workday Tradition
But retirement and illness nave
not stopped his devotion to the
Con Home, where he is known
and loved by each young patient.
He has donated all royalties from
his book "Sam McDonald's Farm"
to the Con Home.
The tradition of the workday—
this year to be done by Ihe fresh
men—was begun in 1920. At this
event students paint buildings, re

pair toys and do general odd jobs
around the home.
In previous years over $5000
has been raised by the Con Home
Drive, but this year's goal of
$7500 will bring th§ total higher
than ever before.
An unusual donater of money
to the home is the Allied Arts
Guild. It enables people to watch
skilled craftsmen making jewelry
and other art objects while they
shop for gifts. All proceeds from
the sales go to the home.
