# Young Pitches Last Game, Against Broncos Today
## Senior Right-Hander Strives for 20th Victory; Indians Need Win to Tie for Second in CIBA 
### Dave Canfield 
Senior right hander Ray Young will climax a brilliant college base
ball career this afternoon at 2:15 at Santa Clara when he starts his
final game.
Young thus far this year has racked up eight wins against five
losses in conference and non-conference games.

The veteran churker boasts a
three-year record of 19 wins and
12 losses. In his sophomore year
he was named the California In
tercollegiate Baseball A s so c i a
tion's most valuable player.
Youpg last year made the CIBA
All-Stars.
May Be Weary
Young hurled 13 innings last
Saturday in the Cal loss and may
he under-par today.
But he may not need too much
stuff against the Broncos. Santa
Clara ranks last in the league and
has lost three times this year to
the Indians.
The Cards will need a win today
to tie for second with California.
Other Regulars
Other regulars who will be
playing their last game in a Stan
ford uniform today include center
fielder Mickey Hol/man and left
fielder Bob Evans.
Holzman and Evans will be
missed next spring. Evans is cur
rently pacing Indian batsmen
with a lusty .319 batting average,
while Hol/man stands right be
hind with .314.
