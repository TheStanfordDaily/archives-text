# Lease of KEAR To Popular Music Station Cancelled
## 
### 
Stephen A. Cisler, owner of San
Francisco "good music" station
K E A R, announced that the sta
tion's pending lease to a Mil
waukee firm which had planned to
broadcast popular music over the
outlet has fallen through.
But Cisler said he is still "con
sidering four or five other offers."
Some of these would call for a
continued good music policy and
some, like the original offer, would
mean a complete change in pro
gramming.
Milton Stern Jr., KEAR stock
holder- and an attorney, wrote
Cisler last week demanding a
stockholders' meeting to block
KEAR's transformation into a
popular music stat'on.
Stern said he and other stock
holders are now entitled to a ma
jority on the station's board of di
rectors. He said California law
permits preferred stockholders to
take majority control of a corpora
tion which pays no dividends for
two years.
If his group should succeed in
ousting th e present majority,
Stern said he and other listeners
do not want to take over the sta
tion's operations. They want 1o
make sure instead that it will he
sold or leased to someone interest
ed in good music. â€¢
The preferred buyer, he said,
would be KFAC, the prosperous
good music station in Los Angeles.
