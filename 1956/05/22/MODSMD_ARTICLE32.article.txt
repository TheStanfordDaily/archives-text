# Papooses End Season With 14-3 Victory
## 
### 
Finishing lip their season in tri
umphant fashion, Papoose bats
men pounded out 16 base hits to
blast Norte Del Rio High School
off the Frosh Diamond Saturday
afternoon.
The frosh literally turned the
contest into a rout as early as the
second inning, when they scored
nine runs—enough by themselves
to have humbled the visiting ba.se
ballers.
In that inning three Norte Del
Rio errors and seven Stanford
base its combined to produce the
fabulous nine runs as il Papooses
trooped to the platter before the
visitors could retire the side.
The inning was capped with a
long triple off the bat of captain
Rich DeFabio.
The Papooses added one more
run in their third, three in their
fourth and another in the seventh
to complete their wipe-out.
The visitors were handcuffed
by the efficiency of Papoose
chucker Joel Mogy, who gave up
single runs in the third, sixth and
eighth frames.
