# Card Nine Falls to Third Place By Dropping 13-Inning Thriller
## 
### 
The Indian baseball team slipped to third place in CIBA standings
last Saturday. Stanford lost a tight 13-inning. 5-4 game to Cal to drop
to one-half game back of the Bears.
With the bags bulging with Bears in the last half of the 13th, Cal
first baseman Warren Lavorel singled to drive in the winning tally.

Stanford had pulled temporarily
ahead in the top half of that in
ning, 4-3.
The loss gives the Card nine a
record of eight wins and seven
losses in California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association play.
The Bear diamond men boast a
slightly bettor 9-7 record. Ray
Young's strong right arm lasted
13 innings for Stanford Saturday.
Though he was charged with the
loss, the veteran chucker slammed
out three singles in five at-bats to
pace all hitters.
Gene Stang, victor over the
Cards twice previously this spring,
was the Bears' starting hurler.
Stang needed relief in the seventh
from Tom Weiss, the eventual win
ner.
