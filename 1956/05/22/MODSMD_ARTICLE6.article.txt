# Park, S.F. Fox Theaters Agree to Give Discounts
## Seven Movie Houses Now Offer Special Rates For Stanford Students; LASSU Must Approve 
### 
The Park Theatre in Menlo Park and the Fox Theatre in San Fran
cisco have agreed to give Stanford students discount prices on movie
admissions, Stanford Theatre Manager John Nylen, whose theater
last week was the first to offer students such discounts, said yesterday.
The Park and the Fox bring to seven the number of theaters who

have agreed to the discount plan.
Others include the Stanford, the
Fox in Redwood City, the Carlos
in San Carlos, the San Mateo in
San Mateo and the Peninsula in
Burlingame.
Nylen said he had heard the Var
sity Theatre would also go along
with the plan. But Varsity Man
ager Mrs. Dorothy Jessen said
"nothing has been settled" and that
she would have to hear from her
policy-setting theater chain, the
United California Theatres, before
she can say anything definite.
Discount Plan
The discount plan, which re
sulted from The Daily's recent
"What Do YOU Think?" column
asking for lower movie prices for
Stanford students, must be ap
proved by Legislature. President
elect Bob Freelen plans to bring
the matter up for discussion at
tomorrow night's meeting.
If the plan is adopted students
will be admitted to the seven
theaters for "junior" prices—gen
erally 25 cents less—on purchase
of a $1 discount card good for one
year.
Price Split
Fifty cents of the card price
would go to the ASSU for a worthy
campus project, and 50 cents
would be retained by the theaters.
LASSU must approve the plan
before the end of the current aca
demic year, Nylen said, to allow
enough time to "get things roll
ing."
The nontransferable discount
cards would be sold at the Pavilion
on fall quarter registration day.
