# Stanford Players Open Shakespeare Satire Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Stanford Players' produc
tion of Shakespeare's "Loves'
Labour's Lost' ? opens tomorrow
night at 8:15 in the Little Theatre.
The show, directed by Robert
Loper, runs through Saturday and
next week Wednesday through
Saturday.
The comedy, a satire on "the fol
lies of education," is being de
signed by former junior artist in
residence James Stearns as his
thesis project.
"Love's Labour's Lost," as
Loper said, "is a masque: it's de
liberately artificial and it's deli
cate. The literal weight of tradi
tional canvas scenery might well
crush its spirit entirely."
Steam's sets, therefore, are ex
ecuted in a material new to the
theater, a plastic netting called
viophane.
Designed to be lit from behind,
the sheets of transparent net are
painted where objects are not to
be seen so that the figures stand
out like those on a photographic
negative. %
"What we're trying to do," Lo
per said, "is get away from tra
dition without overwhelming the
play with sheer novelty."
Tickets are still available for $1
and $1.50 at the Memorial Hall
box office from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m.
