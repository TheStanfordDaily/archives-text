### Lynn Bramkamp 
The Body-Snatchers went down
in defeat before the overwhelm
ing might of the Legal-Eagles in
last week's hard-fought golf bat
tle.
The score was: Law School 22,
Med School 6.
"Of course, the Legal • Eagles
had to bring in the Army to beat
us," said Dr. George B. Robson of
the Medical School. Robson was
referring to several Army law
yers that were brought in at the
last minute to play for the Law
School.
John Merryman, Stanford Law
School, observed: "There is an in
creasing awareness on the part of
the Law Faculty that there is a
great importance in Military Law.
We, out of common courtesy, in
vited a few of our Army brothers
in-law to play with us.
"It was indeed touching to see
Dean Spaeth being introduced to
his winning team," said Robson.
"The dean meets a number of nice
people that way every year.
"We of the Medical School are
proud," said Robson. "There has
been a definite improvement in
the physical qualities of the Law
School Faculty. In fact, they all
managed to get around the entire
18 holes without assistance."
Merryman countered by observ
ing that there was something
lacking in the physical fibre of
the Medical School faculty, be
cause they all had caddies where
as the Law School faculty had
none.
"This is an interesting com
mentary on the economic status
of the Medical School faculty as
opposed to the Law School fac
ulty," said Merryman.
As a parting shot, Robson ob
served: "We have accomplished
what we set out to do, namely, to
improve the physical qualities of
the Law School faculty. Now, I
would like to see some sort of a
Mont Court set up between the
students of the two schools. We
of the Medical School feel we
have a moral obligation to at
tempt to raise the intellectual
standards of the Law School."
