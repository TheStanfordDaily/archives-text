# Stanford Is One Of 8 Colleges Fined by PCC
## Charged Minor Violation Fee of $250 For Irregular Athletic Labor Plan 
### 
VJCIORIA, 8.C., May 22 (UP)—The Pacific Coast Conference -re
sumed its drastic crackdown on athletic code violations today by or
der ing member schools to break with any downtown booster club that
isn't closely supervised by the university and handed out fines to eight
schools including Stanford.
Stanford was among the eight schools fined for "minor violations

of the code. The fine was $250.
The hardest hit was California,
which was assessed $1550 for im
proper issue of complimentary
tickets, irregularities in the cam
pus labor program and conduction
of off-campus interviews with a
prospect.
Labor Program
Stanford was charged with an
irregular campus labor program
for athletes.
Idaho was fined $1000; Oregon
State, $650; Southern California,
$500; UCLA, $350; Oregon, $350;
and Washington, $250. Washing
ton State was the only school given
a clean bill of health.
At Stanford, Athletic Publicist
Don Liebendorfer said, "I am not
sure of the exact reason for the
fine but it is almost impossible for
a ball club to operate completely
within PCC rules.
Athletes Pleased
' The athletes were, very pleased
that Stanford was at the bottom
of the list. It proves that you can
operate a top flight team within
PCC rules."
On the new booster club regula
tions, Liebendorfer said, "We are
in a good position as the new rules
will not change the operation of
the Buck Club. Its books have al
ways been open. Not a cent of
their funds have ever gone for
anything except tuition for needy
athletes and this money is paid
directly to the University."
Booster Club Rules
Also, PCC officials ruled today
that schools only will be allowed
to affiliate with such organizations
if:
• That organization has on file
with the institution a copy of its
constitution and by-laws; the
statement of its objectives, poli
cies and operational procedures
and a list of its current officers.
• The organization agrees in
writing to permit the institution
and conference to examine upon
demand its books and records, in
cluding names of all members and
contributors as well as the amount
contributed by each.
• The organization submits to
the institution its books and rec
ords at least once every 12
months."
This regulation goes into effect
next August 15.

The PCC stunned UCLA last
Saturday by banishing the Bruins
from any Rose Bowl consideration
for the next three years and cut
ting them out of the Bowl receipts.
This was equivalent to a $95,000
fine.
Another blockbuster was lev
elled yesterday when the school
itself announced that members of
last year's freshman and varsity
football teams would lose a year's
eligibility unless they could prove
they had not taken side payments.
Earlier this month, Washington
was handed a two year Rose Bowl
ban and lost out on the receipts.
This amounted to a fine of about
$52,000.

On the new booster club regula
tions, Liebendorfer said, "We are
in a good position as the new rules
will not change the operation of
the Buck Club. Its books have al
ways been open. Not a cent of
their funds have ever gone for
anything except tuition for needy
athletes and this money is paid
directly to the University."

The PCC stunned UCLA last
Saturday by banishing the Bruins
from any Rose Bowl consideration
for the next three years and cut
ting them out of the Bowl receipts.
This was equivalent to a $95,000
fine.
Another blockbuster was lev
elled yesterday when the school
itself announced that members of
last year's freshman and varsity
football teams would lose a year's
eligibility unless they could prove
they had not taken side payments.
Earlier this month, Washington
was handed a two year Rose Bowl
ban and lost out on the receipts.
This amounted to a fine of about
$52,000.
