tration office that Sproul was be
ing hanged in effigy and that stu
dents and alumni were blaming
him for the disciplinary action
against UCLA, one of eight cam
puses of the University of Cali
fornia.
"I especially deplore the fact
that unhappiness over recent Pa
cific Coast Conference penalties
against UCLA has been directed
against President Sproul," the
Chancellor said.
"It is regrettable that well
meaning UCLA supporters have
attacked the unity of the Univer
sity of California. Nothing in the
long run could do the Los Angeles
campus more harm.
"Sproul has served as the Uni
versity of California's Chief Ex
ecutive for 25 years and has di
rected efforts to make it one of
the most distinguished institutions
of learning in the world."
Student and alumni anger was
directed against Sproul because of

ceived from Dr. Allen reports of
booster group activities and
