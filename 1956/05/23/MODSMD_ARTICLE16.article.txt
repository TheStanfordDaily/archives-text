# The 						Big Week

### 
At THF. F.ND of a little road on the edge of cam
pus is the Stanford Convalescent Home.
In the home are 80 children from two to 12
years old. Most of them are charity cases, chil
dren who haven't had a chance to pet the right
treatment when they've been ill.
Sonic of them arc suffering from malnutri
tion or rickets. Others are recovering from
asthma, polio or rheumatic fever. For once in
their lives they're getting the care they need.
And for once iu their lives they're happy.
They have friends, like Sam McDonald, the
Con Home's "patron saint. He has been ill
himself hut that hasn't affected the deep de
votion he feels for the Con Home children.

This week is Con Home Weekâ€”tlie one hip
week of the year for Stanford student.- and fac
ulty to contribute to the welfare of these chil
dren.
Last year $7000 was raised hv the Con Home
Drive. This year's goal is 87500. It's going to
take plenty of faculty and student co-operation
to reach (his goal. J
Stanford students are often isolated iu their
own world of academics and activities. We go
along from day to day without much thought
ahout things outside our little world.
This is one chance tor us to hreak throupii
that shell ol isolation. It's certainly worth it.
