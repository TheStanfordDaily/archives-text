# Stanford's Paradise, Lost?
## 
### 
Stanford's greatest asset is the rural beauty
ol its campus a beauty which is gradually re
ceding before the onslaught of commercialism
and an expanding, growing University.
W bile there is economic wisdom in the ad
vances in land development made by the llni
versity iu the past years, a number of members
of the Stanford Family are concerned that there
may be a great loss suffered if adequate steps
are not taken to insure retention of Ihe Farm's
atmosphere.
Fortunately, the land development planners
recognize the problem at hand and have moved
to set aside substantial port ions of Slant nrd land
for enjoyment by the students.

I he action of a student group who met last
week and formulated a proposal for a "wilder
ness recreation park area** is an attempt to draw
the attention of the Administration to desires of
"students and faculty to guarantee a suitable re
serve area for recreational uses.
This is the first plan for such an area, and if
successfully implemented it can give future gen
eral ions ol si ii den Is t lie enjoyment of Stanford's
greatest asset.
\\ hat is needed now is a specific, definite
voice from I he students to achieve a lasting com
mitment. Legislature can provide*that voice,
if it will, tonight.
