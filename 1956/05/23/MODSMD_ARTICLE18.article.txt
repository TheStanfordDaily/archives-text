## Incumbent Sen. Kuchel, Newcomer Richards Matched in June 'Race' 
### HELEN DEWAR JIM PALMER 
It's been 12 years since a Democratic Senator
from California lias seen the inner circles of
the Senate Chambers in Washington, but 1957
may see a new figure emerge on the national
scene in the person of Richard Richards.
It itli a rapid rise up the Democratic ranks
behind him, the youthful, dynamic state sena
tor presents a serious challenge to Republican
incumbent ihomas Knchel.
Racked by a 20-year career combining legal
practice and work for the Democratic Party,
the 39-year-old Richards in 1954 defeated Re
publican state senator Jack Tenney, who had
represented the populous Los Angeles County
in Sacramento for 12 years.
In the state senate, Hichards, representing 42
per cent of the voters in the state, led an un
successful light for the establishment of a Fair
Fmployment Practices Commission, and among
other things fought for increased appropria
tions for school and institutional construction
and against civil rights infringements.
Roth in his senate term and during his cam
paign, Richards has striven determinedly for
greater equity in state and national <'ix il rights
programs. Striking at the reactionary Demo
cratic Senator James Eastland, Richards buried
the party hatchet and condemned Eastland and
other Democrats for their stand against civil
rights for the Negro.
Knchel voted for Eastland's appointment as
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommit
tee, explaining that this did not mean sanction
ot Eastland's principles, but rather compliance
v>ith the Senate seniority tradition.
Richards hotly attacked him for his custom
ary /tussive. inactive response to such measures,
pointing out that he did not raise a finger lit
correct tlw outdated seniority rule.
1 Jeniocratic incumbent-challengers tradition
ally have difficulty in California because of the
cross-filing system, hazy party organization, ten
dency of the voter to sanction the familiar name
of the incumbent and indifference, and often
hostility, of a Republican press.
Although he ivas endorsed by the Democratic
organization in California by a vote of 1480 to
121. Richards faces some opposition in the pri
mary from Samuel Yorty, ulio, failing to get
the party s nod. has struck out on a campaign of
his own.
Kuchel, his main competitor, has earned for
himself the dubious reputation of being one of
the foremost Eisenhower "yes-men" in Con
gress.
There are many throughout the state who de
plore the lack of dynamism the nodding head
—of the Republican incumbent and see in Rich
ards a man who will speak his convictions anil
not look first to the man in the White House
for the official word.

California's primary election for U.S. Sen
ator next month will match an experienced in
cuinbent and a young newcomer — Senator
Thomas 11. Knchel and Democrat Richard
Richards with a once-defeated Samuel Yorty
tagging along for exercise.
Knchel is in the liabil of winning elections,
ami the 46-year-old Anaheim man is nut about
to lose to upstart Richards in the battle j<tr a
full six years.
The Senator is running on his own record anil
with the added strength of promising to sup
port President Eisenhower all the way. These
two factors combined make defeat look highly
unlikely.
What is Kuchcl's record? He speaks proudly
of sponsoring nearly 50 hills during his three
year stay on Capitol Mill, hills which are now
"the law of the land." He points to water con
trol projects and municipal building projects
as among his accomplishments.
Characterized as "quiet and lackluster" in (lis
early days as Senator, Knchel has begun to blos
som forth in the legislative chamber. In 195k
lie was an election winner oyer Yorty for the
remaining two years of Nixon's term.
Knchel told this columnist earlier this month
that he believed he could win the nominal ion of
both parties in the June primary if it ivere not
for his Senatorial duties that keep him off the
campaign trail.
Knchel s campaigning thus far has been very
light. He had to cut short a planned IJav Area
tour t<i fly hack to the Senate last month.
Hut, lie says, he has surprisingly little op
position to combat in the way of attacks and
charges against him and his record. Richards
and Yorty, while not talking about each other,
have directed their comments to the Viee-Prcs
idenoy or the Administration's defense policy.
Herein lies the tale of the race for II.S. Sen
ator. At the most, the ('.DC-endorsed Richards
may gain experience. At the age of 39, it can be
a valuable, although not immediately reward
ing, experience.
\\ hatever Richards' capabilities are, the pub
lic has not been made aware of them. Certain!)
his experience in public office does not begin to
measure up to that of Kuchel's, who has a wide
background in California legal as well as po
litical areas.
Richards and his campaign issues (whatever
they are) have certainly not been mode dis
tinguishable yet. Much more of a political of
fensive will hai e to be waged by the Democratic
hopeful if he desires to frighten incumbent
Knchel, icho stands protected by his record, by
the cross-filing system and by the coat-tails of a
very popular President.

tor presents a serious challenge to Republican
incumbent ihomas Knchel.
Racked by a 20-year career combining legal
practice and work for the Democratic Party,
the 39-year-old Richards in 1954 defeated Re
publican state senator Jack Tenney, who had
represented the populous Los Angeles County
in Sacramento for 12 years.
In the state senate, Hichards, representing 42
per cent of the voters in the state, led an un
successful light for the establishment of a Fair
Fmployment Practices Commission, and among
other things fought for increased appropria
tions for school and institutional construction
and against civil rights infringements.
Roth in his senate term and during his cam
paign, Richards has striven determinedly for
greater equity in state and national <'ix il rights
programs. Striking at the reactionary Demo
cratic Senator James Eastland, Richards buried
the party hatchet and condemned Eastland and
other Democrats for their stand against civil
rights for the Negro.
Knchel voted for Eastland's appointment as
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommit
tee, explaining that this did not mean sanction
ot Eastland's principles, but rather compliance
v>ith the Senate seniority tradition.
Richards hotly attacked him for his custom
ary /tussive. inactive response to such measures,
pointing out that he did not raise a finger lit
correct tlw outdated seniority rule.
1 Jeniocratic incumbent-challengers tradition
ally have difficulty in California because of the
cross-filing system, hazy party organization, ten
dency of the voter to sanction the familiar name
of the incumbent and indifference, and often
hostility, of a Republican press.
Although he ivas endorsed by the Democratic
organization in California by a vote of 1480 to
121. Richards faces some opposition in the pri
mary from Samuel Yorty, ulio, failing to get
the party s nod. has struck out on a campaign of
his own.
Kuchel, his main competitor, has earned for
himself the dubious reputation of being one of
the foremost Eisenhower "yes-men" in Con
gress.
There are many throughout the state who de
plore the lack of dynamism the nodding head
—of the Republican incumbent and see in Rich
ards a man who will speak his convictions anil
not look first to the man in the White House
for the official word.

California's primary election for U.S. Sen
ator next month will match an experienced in
cuinbent and a young newcomer — Senator
Thomas 11. Knchel and Democrat Richard
Richards with a once-defeated Samuel Yorty
tagging along for exercise.
Knchel is in the liabil of winning elections,
ami the 46-year-old Anaheim man is nut about
to lose to upstart Richards in the battle j<tr a
full six years.
The Senator is running on his own record anil
with the added strength of promising to sup
port President Eisenhower all the way. These
two factors combined make defeat look highly
unlikely.
What is Kuchcl's record? He speaks proudly
of sponsoring nearly 50 hills during his three
year stay on Capitol Mill, hills which are now
"the law of the land." He points to water con
trol projects and municipal building projects
as among his accomplishments.
Characterized as "quiet and lackluster" in (lis
early days as Senator, Knchel has begun to blos
som forth in the legislative chamber. In 195k
lie was an election winner oyer Yorty for the
remaining two years of Nixon's term.
Knchel told this columnist earlier this month
that he believed he could win the nominal ion of
both parties in the June primary if it ivere not
for his Senatorial duties that keep him off the
campaign trail.
Knchel s campaigning thus far has been very
light. He had to cut short a planned IJav Area
tour t<i fly hack to the Senate last month.
Hut, lie says, he has surprisingly little op
position to combat in the way of attacks and
charges against him and his record. Richards
and Yorty, while not talking about each other,
have directed their comments to the Viee-Prcs
idenoy or the Administration's defense policy.
Herein lies the tale of the race for II.S. Sen
ator. At the most, the ('.DC-endorsed Richards
may gain experience. At the age of 39, it can be
a valuable, although not immediately reward
ing, experience.
\\ hatever Richards' capabilities are, the pub
lic has not been made aware of them. Certain!)
his experience in public office does not begin to
measure up to that of Kuchel's, who has a wide
background in California legal as well as po
litical areas.
Richards and his campaign issues (whatever
they are) have certainly not been mode dis
tinguishable yet. Much more of a political of
fensive will hai e to be waged by the Democratic
hopeful if he desires to frighten incumbent
Knchel, icho stands protected by his record, by
the cross-filing system and by the coat-tails of a
very popular President.

In the state senate, Hichards, representing 42
per cent of the voters in the state, led an un

other things fought for increased appropria

and against civil rights infringements.
Roth in his senate term and during his cam
paign, Richards has striven determinedly for
greater equity in state and national <'ix il rights
programs. Striking at the reactionary Demo
cratic Senator James Eastland, Richards buried
the party hatchet and condemned Eastland and
other Democrats for their stand against civil
rights for the Negro.
Knchel voted for Eastland's appointment as
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommit
tee, explaining that this did not mean sanction
ot Eastland's principles, but rather compliance

cross-filing system, hazy party organization, ten
dency of the voter to sanction the familiar name
of the incumbent and indifference, and often
hostility, of a Republican press.
Although he ivas endorsed by the Democratic
organization in California by a vote of 1480 to

the party s nod. has struck out on a campaign of
his own.
Kuchel, his main competitor, has earned for
himself the dubious reputation of being one of
the foremost Eisenhower "yes-men" in Con

There are many throughout the state who de
plore the lack of dynamism the nodding head
—of the Republican incumbent and see in Rich
ards a man who will speak his convictions anil
not look first to the man in the White House
for the official word.

California's primary election for U.S. Sen
ator next month will match an experienced in
cuinbent and a young newcomer — Senator
Thomas 11. Knchel and Democrat Richard
Richards with a once-defeated Samuel Yorty
tagging along for exercise.
Knchel is in the liabil of winning elections,
ami the 46-year-old Anaheim man is nut about
to lose to upstart Richards in the battle j<tr a
full six years.
The Senator is running on his own record anil
with the added strength of promising to sup
port President Eisenhower all the way. These
two factors combined make defeat look highly
unlikely.
What is Kuchcl's record? He speaks proudly
of sponsoring nearly 50 hills during his three
year stay on Capitol Mill, hills which are now
"the law of the land." He points to water con
trol projects and municipal building projects
as among his accomplishments.
Characterized as "quiet and lackluster" in (lis
early days as Senator, Knchel has begun to blos
som forth in the legislative chamber. In 195k
lie was an election winner oyer Yorty for the
remaining two years of Nixon's term.
Knchel told this columnist earlier this month
that he believed he could win the nominal ion of
both parties in the June primary if it ivere not
for his Senatorial duties that keep him off the
campaign trail.
Knchel s campaigning thus far has been very
light. He had to cut short a planned IJav Area
tour t<i fly hack to the Senate last month.
Hut, lie says, he has surprisingly little op
position to combat in the way of attacks and
charges against him and his record. Richards
and Yorty, while not talking about each other,
have directed their comments to the Viee-Prcs
idenoy or the Administration's defense policy.
Herein lies the tale of the race for II.S. Sen
ator. At the most, the ('.DC-endorsed Richards
may gain experience. At the age of 39, it can be
a valuable, although not immediately reward
ing, experience.
\\ hatever Richards' capabilities are, the pub
lic has not been made aware of them. Certain!)
his experience in public office does not begin to
measure up to that of Kuchel's, who has a wide
background in California legal as well as po
litical areas.
Richards and his campaign issues (whatever
they are) have certainly not been mode dis
tinguishable yet. Much more of a political of
fensive will hai e to be waged by the Democratic
hopeful if he desires to frighten incumbent
Knchel, icho stands protected by his record, by
the cross-filing system and by the coat-tails of a
very popular President.
It's been 12 years since a Democratic Senator
from California lias seen the inner circles of
the Senate Chambers in Washington, but 1957
may see a new figure emerge on the national
scene in the person of Richard Richards.
It itli a rapid rise up the Democratic ranks
behind him, the youthful, dynamic state sena
tor presents a serious challenge to Republican
incumbent ihomas Knchel.
Racked by a 20-year career combining legal
practice and work for the Democratic Party,
the 39-year-old Richards in 1954 defeated Re
publican state senator Jack Tenney, who had
