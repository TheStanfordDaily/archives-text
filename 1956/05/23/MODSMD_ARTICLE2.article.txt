# KZSU Finds Fallout Rumor Spreads Easily
## Radiation Story Gets Wide Response; Many Phone Calls Received 
### 
i Rumors spread easily.
That was what KZSU newscast
. er Lloyd Downton learned Sunday
. night after his 8:45 "Your World
Tonight" broadcast.
As an assignment for Professor
Paul Farnsworth's psychology
class, Downton broadcast a rumor
about a "radiation fallout" in San
Francisco.
At the start of his show Down
ton warned, "Stay tuned for an
experiment in rumor." And after
reporting the radiation fallout he
1 repeatedly admitted it was "un
confirmed."
' But many listeners excitedly
1 overlooked Downton's hints, sta
tion manager Terry Bateman said
yesterday.
15 Phone Calls
Bateman said, "Wo received 15
phone calls. Most of them were
jokesters, but at least three or
four of them seemed sincerely
concerned about friends in San
Francisco."
The FCC does not have jurisdic
tion over KZSU, according to the
"Voice of Stanford" staff mem
bers.
Metropolitan I'rcss
Downton phoned The Daily yes
terday and said: "The metropoli
tan press in reporting the KZSU
'fallout report' completely misrep
resented what had actually hap
pened, mainly in the number of
phone calls and in some other
facts. The Stanford Daily was the
only paper to give the correct
story."
Bateman himself did not spon
sor the plan, as previously re
ported. He did not even know the
report was a fake until after
Downton's newscast.
The station manager had gone
on the air at 10 p.m. and empha
sized that the report was "uncon
firmed." At the midnight sign-off
time, KZSU broadcast a retrac
tion of the rumor.
