# Scientists to Check Effects of H-Bomb
## 
### 
Dr. Robert Harry, lecturer in
ichthyology at Stanford, will lead
a group of seven American scien
tists in an expedition to the South
Pacific to check the direction and
speed of water contaminated by
current nuclear tests at Bikini.
The group, under the auspices
of the Atomic Energy Commis
sion and other government agen
cies, also plans an extensive study
of coral reef life and the effects
of radioactivity upon marine life.
Dr. Harry said the scientists
would begin about 3000 miles
west of the hydrogen blast site.
He estimated that it would take
the water three or four months
to travel that distance.
