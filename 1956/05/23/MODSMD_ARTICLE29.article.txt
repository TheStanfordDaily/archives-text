# Moore Called Top Olympic Swim Hopeful
## Coach Believes World Record Holder Can Win 100-Meter Sprint 
### 
Indian swim mentor Tom Hay
nie says that his sophomore ace
Robin Moore is the top candidate
to win the 100-meteyfreestyle in
the Olympics at Melbourne.
Haynie backs up his claim for
his 18-year-old whiz by pointing
to the new world mark of :48.9
for 100 yards that he set last
weekend in the PCC meet.
:47.5 Is Goal
Moore himself believes that he
can swim the distance in :47.5 be
fore the Olympic tryouts, Haynie
said. Robin holds the national col
legiate record in the 50-yard
sprint in 22 flat.
On Moore's form Haynie says:
"it's terrible, but very effective.
Robin is such a powerful kid that
he just thrashes his arms and
legs, with water flying in all di
rect if >ns.
"I'll say this—he would never
make a synchronized swimming
team the way he beats the water,
but I'm certainly not going to
change his style."
Strong Swimmer
Haynie calls his "Jaguar" the
strongest swimmer he has ever
known.
Moore came to Stanford from
Phoenix, where he was all-state
prep star in swimming, football
and track.
He has been invited by football
coach Chuck Taylor to attend the
early grid practice next fall, but
all of this is out the window if he
is selected to the U. S. Olympic
team.
Haynie lists three reasons for
Moore's greatness:
• Supreme confidence in his
ability. He is not cocky but con
fident.
• Tremendous physical
strength in his arms and legs.
• Numerous hours spent in
workouts in the Encina pool.
