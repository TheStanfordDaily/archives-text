LOS ANGELES, May 22 (UP)
Star passer Ronnie Knox an
nounced today he intended wag
ing a fight to retain his eligibility
next fall with the UCLA football
team because he was innocent of
accepting "under-the-table" finan
cing.
The brilliant halfback was join
ed by his step-father, the contro
versial Harvey Knox, in declaring
Ronnie was "clean" and would at
tempt to clear himself with the
Pacific Coast Conference.
The PCC yesterday ruled all
players on the 1955 UCLA varsity
and freshman teams should lose
a year of eligibility unless they
cleared themselves.
"I consider myself entirely eli
gible and I am ready to take any
test the conference desires to
prove that I am eligible," the slim
young player announced.
On the UCLA campus the only
topic of conversation was the con

ference ruling, which, unless mod
ified in individual cases, would
ban about a dozen players of 17
or 18 lette'rmen and veterans
available for the 1956 team.
One of the first manifestations
of UCLA's feelings was the hang
ing in effigy of conference com
missioner Victor O. Schmidt on a
downtown Los Angeles street.
A placard attached to the dum
my read:
"Victor Schmidt, RIP â€”PCC.
His motto: discrimination. Epi
taph: he tried to give PCC sports

the noose; now he sports the
noose!"
Strategy to be employed by
Knox and fellow members of the
team in fighting the ruling in the
eases of those who considered
themselves innocent will be map
ped at a secret meeting, it was
reported.
