# Scientist Talks On Cosmology At Tues. Series
## Gives Description Of Universe; Illustrates Galaxies with Slides 
### 
The universe as a whole—its
size, scope and motion—was dis
cussed last night in a Tuesday
Evening Series lecture by Dr. Wil
liam Hunter McCrea, British sci
entist. whose topic was "Cosmol
ogy: Some Current Problems."
McCrea first defined cosmology
as the study of the universe of
galaxies and showed a number of
slides illustrating individual spi
ral galaxies and galaxy clusters
at various angles and distances
from the earth.
McCrea stressed the "wonder
ful skies and work done by the
Pacific Coast observatories." His
slides were made from photo
graphs taken with the 200-inch
telescope at Mt. Palomar.
Discus Shape
After discussing the disc u s
shape of our own Milky Way
galaxy, McCrea explained the sim
ilarities of other galaxies which
are all members of a vast system.
In discussing the motion of the
galaxies, McCrea explained their
constant velocity away from Ihe
earth, with the speed proportion
ate to the distance from the earth.
This expansion theory of the uni
verse has led to some new con
clusions since its acceptance, in
cluding the indication that all gal
axies must have been together or
near one another approximately
five billion years ago, McCrea
said.
Uniformity of Universe
He also told of the Cosmologi
eal Principle, or the theory of the
Uniformity of the universe, which
states that all galaxies would ap
pear the same if seen on other
galaxies looking toward ours, de
pendent on the evolutionary stage
or cosmic epoch of the universe.
He further explained the tenuous
nature of the universe, saying its
density would bq equal to one
dime spread out to the size of the !
earth.
McCrea mentioned several proh-j
lems facing the cosmologist at J
present, including whether or not ;
there is material between the gal- j
axies, and how, as present infor- ■
mat ion seems to indicate, the ma- 1
terial of the universe can be older
than the universe itself.
At present McCrea is a guest j
professor in mathematics at the
University of California at Berke- :
ley and is regularly on the faculty
of the Royal Holloway College,
University of London.
He concluded his lecture with
a theoretical discussion of the in
let dependence ,of laws and the
objects to which they apply in
this case physics and the uni
verse.

Discus Shape
After discussing the disc u s
shape of our own Milky Way
galaxy, McCrea explained the sim
ilarities of other galaxies which
are all members of a vast system.
In discussing the motion of the
galaxies, McCrea explained their
constant velocity away from Ihe
earth, with the speed proportion
ate to the distance from the earth.
This expansion theory of the uni
verse has led to some new con
clusions since its acceptance, in
cluding the indication that all gal
axies must have been together or
near one another approximately
five billion years ago, McCrea
said.
Uniformity of Universe
He also told of the Cosmologi
eal Principle, or the theory of the
Uniformity of the universe, which
states that all galaxies would ap
pear the same if seen on other
galaxies looking toward ours, de
pendent on the evolutionary stage
or cosmic epoch of the universe.
He further explained the tenuous
nature of the universe, saying its
density would bq equal to one
dime spread out to the size of the !
earth.
McCrea mentioned several proh-j
lems facing the cosmologist at J
present, including whether or not ;
there is material between the gal- j
axies, and how, as present infor- ■
mat ion seems to indicate, the ma- 1
terial of the universe can be older
than the universe itself.
At present McCrea is a guest j
professor in mathematics at the
University of California at Berke- :
ley and is regularly on the faculty
of the Royal Holloway College,
University of London.
He concluded his lecture with
a theoretical discussion of the in
let dependence ,of laws and the
objects to which they apply in
this case physics and the uni
verse.
The universe as a whole—its
size, scope and motion—was dis
cussed last night in a Tuesday
Evening Series lecture by Dr. Wil
liam Hunter McCrea, British sci
entist. whose topic was "Cosmol
ogy: Some Current Problems."
McCrea first defined cosmology
as the study of the universe of
galaxies and showed a number of
slides illustrating individual spi
ral galaxies and galaxy clusters
at various angles and distances
from the earth.
McCrea stressed the "wonder
ful skies and work done by the
Pacific Coast observatories." His
slides were made from photo
graphs taken with the 200-inch
telescope at Mt. Palomar.
