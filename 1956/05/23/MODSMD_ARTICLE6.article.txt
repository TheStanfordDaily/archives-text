The traditional Con Home workday and barbecue
planned for tomorrow afternoon will include only
freshmen this year.
In previous years, making the workday an all
campus affair has not worked out too well, ac-

cording to Tom Pierce, Con Home
Drive chairman. Many people did
not come' out, either to work or
to eat.
Including only freshmen, Pierce
said, makes organization tighter
and the dinner easier to run. Also,
freshmen put more spirit into the
event and come out in larger
groups.
Freshman sponsors will serve
dinner, and the barbecue \X'ill be
paid for by dining halls. Meal
tickets will be punched and no
dinners will be served at fresh
man residences.
The workday starts at 1 p.m.
an*l runs until 5:30 when the bar
becue begins. Tools and jobs will
be distributed at the playground
in the center of the Con Home
area.
Sam McDonald, who is recover
ing from a series of operations,
will be on hand for the event. He
retired two years ago after 50
years as a Stanford employee, but
still retains his interest in the
Home.
