# PCC Is Leveling Its Sights On 'Irregularities' at USC
## 'Documentary Evidence' Tells Of $71,235 in 'Secret Aid' 
### 
The action for which the.whole Pacific Coast has been waiting is
on the way the University of Southern California is to be investi
gated by the PCC for alleged irregularities in its athletic program.
Early last conference officials, spurred on by "documentarv
evidence," announced from Victoria, 8.C., that they intend to give

"prompt attention" to any case
which might involve violation of
PCC rules.
They said such action would
come whenever "the conference,
through its own investigation, the
investigation of the individual in
stitution or any other Source, may
come into possession of adequate
information indicating a serious
institutional violation."
Late yesterday the officials were
apparently supplied with such
"adequate information" in the
form of charges leveled al USC by
a member of UCLA's alumni ad
visory board.
112 "Secret Aid"
Board member J. Miller Leavy
charged Southern California with
paying out $71,235 over a two-year
period in "secret aid" to athletes.
"I am convinced that other
schools in the conference have vio
lated the code and that the con
ference in taking action only
against two of the member
schools, has taken an arbitrary,
unjustified and undemocratic at
titude."
(Earlier the PCC had "fined
UCLA about $100,000 and took a
year's eligibility from all mem
bers of the 1955 varsity and fresh
man football squads, banning the
school from Rose Bowl sharing or
participation for three years.
(They also "fined" the Univer
sity of Washington $53,000 and
banned them from Rose Bowl
sharing for two years).
Leavy sent PCC officials "docu
mentary evidence which directs
their attention to the existence of
'undercover' activities of another
member of the conference. This
school is the University of South
ern California."

A report in the Los Angeles
Examiner says the University
of Southern California claims
to have a "gimmick" that will
implicate Stanford ami the Uni
versity of California in the in
vestigations concerning athletic
code violations now being con
ducted by the Pacific Coast Con
ference.

He didn't name the organization
which administered the $71,235
but said it was not either of the
University's two loading booster
organizations, the Trojaneers and
the Trojan Club.
At least 60 athletes received aid
from the unnamed source, accord
ing to the charges. Leavy said the
amounts ranged as high as $900
a year to individual athletes.
He would not disclose the
source of his information but said
that as a lawyer he considered it
'good evidence."
Leavy is not the first to com
plain about the "discrimination"
of PCC action against UCLA and
the University of Washington.
Student groups at UCLA hanged
PCC Commissioner Victor O.
Schmidt in effigy Tuesday.
Conference members have made
no statements about the com
plaints except for an agreement
by conference spokesman Glenn
Seaborg (UC) to "plead your
case."
Nor is Leavy the first to charge
USC with violations of Ihe PCC
code. For years there have been
many uninvestigated charges of a
great number of irregularities in
Trojan athletic programs.
Recent Charges
Among more recent charges
were those made earlier this week
by Rommie Loudd, Harvey Knox
and Hardiman Cureton.
Loudd, All-American end at
UCLA in 1955, said USC had nf
feted him $75 a month over the
$75 allowed athletes under PCC
regulations.
Knox, the outspoken father of
Ronnie Knox, who was otic of the
Bruins declared ineligible by the
conference, said "USC and Cali
fornia are just as guilty (as
UCLA |."
Latest charges came from
UCLA All-American guard Cure j
ton. who said: "We get peanuts
compared to what those guys are j
getting. Southern California pays |
a football player anywhere from j
$50' to $110 in addition to the per
mit ted $75 a month.
"Then, there are automobiles
and other rewards."

Student groups at UCLA hanged
PCC Commissioner Victor O.
Schmidt in effigy Tuesday.
Conference members have made
no statements about the com

by conference spokesman Glenn
Seaborg (UC) to "plead your
case."
Nor is Leavy the first to charge
USC with violations of Ihe PCC
code. For years there have been
many uninvestigated charges of a
great number of irregularities in
Trojan athletic programs.
Recent Charges
Among more recent charges
were those made earlier this week
by Rommie Loudd, Harvey Knox
and Hardiman Cureton.
Loudd, All-American end at
UCLA in 1955, said USC had nf
feted him $75 a month over the
$75 allowed athletes under PCC
regulations.
Knox, the outspoken father of
Ronnie Knox, who was otic of the
Bruins declared ineligible by the
conference, said "USC and Cali
fornia are just as guilty (as
UCLA |."
Latest charges came from
UCLA All-American guard Cure j
ton. who said: "We get peanuts
compared to what those guys are j
getting. Southern California pays |
a football player anywhere from j
$50' to $110 in addition to the per
mit ted $75 a month.
"Then, there are automobiles
and other rewards."
The action for which the.whole Pacific Coast has been waiting is
on the way the University of Southern California is to be investi
gated by the PCC for alleged irregularities in its athletic program.
Early last conference officials, spurred on by "documentarv
evidence," announced from Victoria, 8.C., that they intend to give

"prompt attention" to any case
which might involve violation of
PCC rules.
They said such action would
come whenever "the conference,
through its own investigation, the
investigation of the individual in
stitution or any other Source, may
come into possession of adequate
information indicating a serious
institutional violation."
Late yesterday the officials were
apparently supplied with such
"adequate information" in the
form of charges leveled al USC by
a member of UCLA's alumni ad
visory board.
112 "Secret Aid"
Board member J. Miller Leavy
charged Southern California with
paying out $71,235 over a two-year
period in "secret aid" to athletes.
"I am convinced that other
schools in the conference have vio
lated the code and that the con
ference in taking action only
against two of the member
schools, has taken an arbitrary,
unjustified and undemocratic at
titude."
(Earlier the PCC had "fined
UCLA about $100,000 and took a
year's eligibility from all mem
bers of the 1955 varsity and fresh
man football squads, banning the
school from Rose Bowl sharing or
participation for three years.
(They also "fined" the Univer
sity of Washington $53,000 and
banned them from Rose Bowl
sharing for two years).
Leavy sent PCC officials "docu
mentary evidence which directs
their attention to the existence of
'undercover' activities of another
member of the conference. This
school is the University of South
ern California."

A report in the Los Angeles
Examiner says the University
of Southern California claims
to have a "gimmick" that will
implicate Stanford ami the Uni
versity of California in the in
vestigations concerning athletic
code violations now being con
ducted by the Pacific Coast Con
ference.

He didn't name the organization
which administered the $71,235
but said it was not either of the
University's two loading booster
organizations, the Trojaneers and
the Trojan Club.
At least 60 athletes received aid
from the unnamed source, accord
ing to the charges. Leavy said the
amounts ranged as high as $900
a year to individual athletes.
He would not disclose the
source of his information but said
that as a lawyer he considered it
'good evidence."
Leavy is not the first to com
