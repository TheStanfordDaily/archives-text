# LASSU Okays 1956-7 Budget, Discount Plan
## Approves Proposal For Special Hostel Area on Campus 
### Helen Dewar 
Rambling slowly over an
"omnibus" agenda, Legislature
gave unanimous approval last
night to the 1956-57 ASSU budget
and commended Student Financial
Manager Bill Tooley for work
done on (he 33-page document.
Few budget changes were sug
gested although representative
Bobbie Clark suggested a complete
going-over for the entire scope of
student activities.
Legislature felt the suggestion
merited future consideration, but
that such an impressive task could
not be handled before this year's
budget was approved.
Movie Discount
The student movie discount
service was "accepted in theory"
by the body with the understand
ing that the summer student gov
ernment would work on the de
tails in preparation for its imple
mentation in the fall.
As of now, the price discount
service, available to students for
$1 a quarter, would apply to seven
Peninsula theaters. The discount
would slice about 25 cents off
theater prices, according to next
year's ASSU President Bob Free
len.
Legislature gave their stamp of
approval to George Abel's propos
al that Legislature request the
University administration to give
"serious consideration" to setting
aside a special tract of land to re
main as a wilderness â€¢ recreation
area for exclusive student use.
Specific Area
The recommendation was not
for a specific area, although Abel
and the committee working with
him have drawn up tentative
plans for a park area near Sears
ville Lake. Abel said he and the
committee felt this is a good place
to establish a permanent hostel.
After a squabble over whether
Legislature should set a maxi
mum limit on the number of stu
dents attending next year's Model
United Nations meet here, Legis
lature sanctioned Stanford's hold
ing the conference.
But they added the stipulation
that Model United Nations steer
ing committee make no commit
ment to accept over 400 students
prior to the second Legislature
meeting in autumn quarter, when
the issue would be brought up
again.
Steering Committee chairman
Chuck Reynolds said "it's silly for
this group |Legislature| to set a
number when they haven't looked
into the situation."
