# The 						Threadbare Program
## 
### 
Laying a iiatchf.t to President Eisenhower's
liberal foreign assistance program, the House
Foreign Affairs Committee voted early this
week to slash $1,100,000 from the President's
$4,900,000 expenditure proposal.
Committee Chairman James P. Richards (D.-
S.C.) argued that the 22 per cent cut had noth
ing to do with the recent shift iu Russian policy,
but was rather a reflection of the large stock of
unspent military and economic funds left over
112 rom previous administrations.
I bus, it seems, at a time when Russian tactics
are being concentrated on the lure of neutral
and underdeveloped countries by attractive
promises of military and economic assistance,

Congressional leaders are proposing to lot the
United States aid program stagnate.
Instead of hiking allocations to show this
eonntry's determination to see a firm basis for
democracy and economic independence estab
lished in these countries, they are willing to see
the Soviet Union capitalize on the initiative
they have already gained in this field.
Although the Russian promises may fie shal
low, 11 ley have had their effect.
Liberal-sounding American policy statements
strike a hypocritical note in the ears of foreign
, nations when they are backed by an aid pro
gram slashed to a threadbare minimum.
