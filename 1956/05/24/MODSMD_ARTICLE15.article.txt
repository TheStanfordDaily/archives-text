# What Do YOU Think?
## Are Stanford's Development Plans Harming the 'Farm' Atmosphere? 
### DAVE SCOTT 
A group of Stanford students has proposed
;i wilderness recreation park area for Stanford.
Some of them think the present development
ol Stanford for industrial and residential pur
poses is destroying nuich of the rural beauty of
campus lands.
Although Stanford's land development plan
ners have set aside much land for the enjoy
ment of Stanford students, many think this is
not enough, while some think il sufficient:
Kay I iiomas, 57, Mariposa: "Development,
of Stanford lands for industrial and residential
purposes seems to he a necessary evil which the
I uiversity needs to maintain its standing among
the top universities in the country.
"A recreation park area would he a valuable
asset to Stanford and would guarantee for stu
dents a spot in the 'wilderness* regardless of
building plans. Using a part of this area as a
hostel camp site would help to further a very
worth-while program and make it a Stanford
I radition."
Scott Siikrrill, '58, Alpha Sigma Phi: "The
horseshoe plan of development surrounding us,
with the factories at one end and the residences
at the other, leaves Stanford with plenty of
undeveloped land, I don I see how the develop
ment can affect the immediate area."
J fan McC.artf.r, 57, Manzauita: "Preserving
an area for recreational purposes is an extreme
ly good idea. The designated spot seems to be
an ideal one for the hostel, because it is not a
long distance from the campus but is far enough
away so that campus activity will not interfere.
"I hope the University will not lease too

much land for tract homes or industrial devel
opment near the campus, because we would
soon have that hemined-in feeling from all di
rections. Ihe feeling of being removed from
the craze of the city is one of the most attractive
aspects of the University. Too much expansion
might destroy I his."
Mike McCwnnis, .>6, Thcia Xi: " The pro
posed wilderness park area doesn't make much
sense. The immediate area around the Quad
will never have its beauty destroyed and can
serve the purpose of this park.
"Also, spring quarter is the only time when
such a park would be used bv the students, and
even then most students would rather go to the
beach."
Hat. Griffin,'s9, Wilbur: "I think Alf Bran
din is doing a good job on the internal improve
ments — for instance, the shopping center. I
don't think the Stanford 'farm' atmosphere is
being destroyed by these projects that are being
put through, but the idea of having a wilderness
park is pretty good because it will help preserve
the atmosphere."
Frkd Peters, '57, Thvta Xi: "Anyone who
wants to gel out and into the wilderness can do
so without having to do it through something
connected with the University."
Hill (»alf, 59, If ilbur: "I don't want homes
built in the hills behind Stanford. Al Cal you
can t tell where the campus ends and Berkeley
begins."
Sandy Seaton, '57, Union: "I would rather
have a little more industry than a higher tui
tion."
