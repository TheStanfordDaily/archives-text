Editor, The Daily:
Rise up, O men of Stanford, and fight, fight,
fight! The banner of the mighty Stanford Daily
leads the way! We're not at college to get an
education! We're here to enforce student gov
ernment! Let's not allow the Goliath of Presi
dent Sterling's regime to stomp out the last gasp
of student will.
At least we know that The Stanford Daily will
never remain ominously silent. Or could it be
that there are more (5'ar more) important things
than student government? Could it be that there
are things far more important than such a valu
able adjunct to the American educational sys
tem?
Could it be that The Daily was half cracked
when it didn't support ASSU President George
Ralph in his efforts at getting the student govern
ment problem in a little better perspective?
Could be. . . .
Chuck Marler
Editor's Note: We doubt if the "regime of
President Sterling" will ever interfere in student

government—tliey are much too wise in the ways
of education for this. (Something which cannot
lie said for their counterparts at UCLA.)
All flit* academic training in the world is worth
less unless those who receive such training are
given an area of freedom in which to practice
that training am? in which to mature intellectu
ally. This area of freedom is student government.
Since student government is rightfully in the
hands of students, we, as a student newspaper,
consider it our duty to uphold the continuance of
freedom in that area —one of our most important
jobs.
So far as we can see, ASSU President George
Ralph lias done little for student government
which would call tor our support. There have |
been a lot of words but precious little action.
To lhe Point
Editor, The Daily:
I hereby complain that I am not in accord with
the decision which reduced the Con Home Bar
becue from an excellent all-campus affair to a
Frosh Barbecue.
