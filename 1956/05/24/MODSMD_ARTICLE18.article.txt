### 
The boundaries of a proposed 35-acre annexation to Palo Alto, con
sisting of the future sites of the Stanford - Palo Alto Hospital and re
lated facilities, were approved last week by the Board of Trustees.
The boundaries of an additional 22.6-aere area to be leased to the
city for its hospital were also approved. The lease area will include

the main facilities that will serve
both hospital wings.
The annexation area will in
clude the Stanford
rehabilitation center and out-pa
tient clinic. Its boundary will run
along the edge of the Medical
School buildings and will take in
a road connecting the site to Wil
low Road, putting all of Willow
Road in the city.
The lease boundary is arranged
to include all core facilities and
Palo Alto's hospital, plus a large
adjoining area for expansion,
parking and landscaping.
More than two years ago the
city annexed a section of the fu
ture hospital grounds as part of
a large annexation covering Stan
ford Shopping Center, its reserve
and a professional-administrative
zone—all located west of El Ca
mino Real.
The new annexation is contigu
ous to the professional-adminis
trative zone. It will pick up the
land on which the buildings will
stand.
Stanford and Palo Alto will
work out some details of actual
location of roads and utilities at
a later date.
Boundaries the trustees approv
ed were planned by the Palo Alto
and Stanford hospital committees.
"Throughout the negotiations
between the two committees there
has been a high degree of coop
eration," commented Alf Brandin,
Stanford land development offi
cer.
