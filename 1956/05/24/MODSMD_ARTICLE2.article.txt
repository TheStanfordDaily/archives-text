WASHINGTON, May 23 (UP)â€”
President Eisenhower, in an im
plied rebuke to feuding military
leaders, said today an officer who
fails to carry out orders of his
Commander-in-Chief is unfit for
command.
With tight-lipped forcefulness,
he told his news conference that
military commanders have a
"duty" to argue defense strategy
provided they do so in a proper
manner. But once a top-level de
cision is made, he said, "that de
cision must stick."
"The day that discipline disap
pears from our forces," he de
clared, "we will have no forces and
we would be foolish to put a
nickel into them."
The President replied with in
tensity to questions about the new
outbreak of inter-service feuding
over military weapons, roles and
strategy. The Army and Air Force
in particular are engaged in a row
over rival anti-aircraft missiles.
Eisenhower appeared anxious to
minimize the squabble. He said
there have been inter-service dif
ferences ever since he can remem
ber. He added that military lead
ers must fight for their points of
view, but "in such a way thai we
don't alarm everybody else."
