# Stanford Gridders Seek First Rose Bowl Squad Since 'Too-Many-Milkshake' Team Lost to Illinois
## Card Eleven Loaded with Backs and Ends; John Brodie and Paul Wiggin Form Nucleus 
### Bob Mierow Sports Editor 
This could be the year.
Stanford has not fielded a Rose
Bowl team since 1951 when Big
Bill McColl, the giant end. gained
Ail-American honors for the sec
ond consecutive year.
The Tribe scored nine straight
victories that year, Chuck Taylor's
maiden season in the Pacific Coast
Conference, before falling to Cali
fornia in Big Game and rugged Il
linois in the Rose Bowl.
Taylor's outfit next season will
boast the speediest and deepest in
some seasons. Quarterback John
Brodie, among the top ten passers
in the nation both of the last two
years, and All-American tackle
Paul Wiggin will form the nucleus
of next year's eleven.
Thin Line
The Big Red machine of 1956
claims a great deal of depth and
experience at end and in the back
field. From tackle to tackle, the
husky red-headed mentor faces a
problem.
Only one tackle, one center, and
three guards who earned letters at
those positions return from last
year's squad.
At tackle, Wiggin can hold down
the forte on one side. Steve Docter
and Rich Elliott, both lettermen
at end, have been switched to
tackle. John Kidd and Ward Mac-
Donald cavorted for the varsity
last year but did not earn letters.
Chris Plain, a giant 250-pounder
who moves like a cat, and rugged
Eric Protiva will also battle, for
tackle slots. Both sat out last sea
son because of injuries after play
ing freshman ball in 1954.
Cars well Returns
Donn Carswell, Noel Robinson
and Don Manoukian are the three
lettermen returning at guard.
Manoukian, built like a barrel but
awfully quick, showed about the
most improvement of any of the
Tribe gridders during spring prac
tice.
Behind this trio, Taylor will have
to count on untested sophomores
such as Bob Peterson, switched
from fullback, Troy Barbee, Don
Crosby and Ralph Koldinger.
The loss of Joe Long at center
leaves a big pair of shoes to fill
but any of three pivot men could
do the trick. Letterman Bob Long
has the edge right now because of
experience.
Roeh Conklin, a fast developing
youngster who played for the
Braves last year, and Russ Steele,
out for a year because of a leg in
jury, have the ability to' displace
Long.
Strong At End
Four lettermen, the star wing
man of the 1954 frosh team and
two of last year's yearling flank
men will be battling for the end
posts.
Jerry Beatie, Gary Van Galder
and Carl Isaacs all saw plenty of
front line action last year. Bob
Gergen, small but rugged for an
end, started several games as a
sophomore two years ago.
Sticky-fingered Joel Freis, a

tricky runner once he gets his
hands on the ball, saved a year of
eligibility last year after starring
for the freshmen two seasons
back.
Frosh Ben Robinson and Dennie
Farrar both showed talent in the
final spring scrimmage last Satur
day.
Too Many Backs
In the backfield Coach Taylor
faces the same problem as the old
lady who lives in a shoe. He has
more backs than he knows what
to do wilh.
Brodie, one of the nation's top
passers, will face stiff competition
for his signal calling post. Letter
men Jackie Douglas and Jack Tay
lor, the latter a former fullback,
are both strong runners, passers
and defensive backs.
Sophomore.Les Hopkins, a for
mer Brave, and freshmen Jim
Ukropina and Bob Nicolet all
showed flashes of excellence in
spring ball.
Coach Taylor has made some
switches among his more talented
running backs. Gordy Young,
small at 185 pounds but a hard
runner, has been moved to full
back. Shifty A 1 Harrington will
do his running from right half
back.
Young At Full
Joining Young at the deep back
position are Archie Schmitt,
Chuck Shea and Lou Valli. Schmitt
is the highly regarded transfer
from Taft Junior College. Shea
saw duty with the varsity last year
after a season at Menlo JC.
Valli saw action in only a few
games last year because of a knee
injury. The explosive soph sat out
spring practice because of the in
jury.
Harrington, Bill Tarr's sub at
full last year, and scatback Jeri
McMillin have the inside track at
right half. Varsity squad mem
bers Doug Dick and Roy Stephen
showed great improvement this
spring.
Paul Camera, Jerry Angove and
Mickey Raferty, the first three
wingbacks from last year's eleven
are all back. Both Camera and
Angove are deadly pass receivers
and tough on defense.

Jerry Beatie, Gary Van Galder
and Carl Isaacs all saw plenty of
front line action last year. Bob
Gergen, small but rugged for an
end, started several games as a
sophomore two years ago.
Sticky-fingered Joel Freis, a

tricky runner once he gets his
hands on the ball, saved a year of
eligibility last year after starring
for the freshmen two seasons
back.
Frosh Ben Robinson and Dennie
Farrar both showed talent in the
final spring scrimmage last Satur
day.
Too Many Backs
In the backfield Coach Taylor
faces the same problem as the old
lady who lives in a shoe. He has
more backs than he knows what
to do wilh.
Brodie, one of the nation's top
passers, will face stiff competition
for his signal calling post. Letter
men Jackie Douglas and Jack Tay
lor, the latter a former fullback,
are both strong runners, passers
and defensive backs.
Sophomore.Les Hopkins, a for
mer Brave, and freshmen Jim
Ukropina and Bob Nicolet all
showed flashes of excellence in
spring ball.
Coach Taylor has made some
switches among his more talented
running backs. Gordy Young,
small at 185 pounds but a hard
runner, has been moved to full
back. Shifty A 1 Harrington will
do his running from right half
back.
Young At Full
Joining Young at the deep back
position are Archie Schmitt,
Chuck Shea and Lou Valli. Schmitt
is the highly regarded transfer
from Taft Junior College. Shea
saw duty with the varsity last year
after a season at Menlo JC.
Valli saw action in only a few
games last year because of a knee
injury. The explosive soph sat out
spring practice because of the in
jury.
Harrington, Bill Tarr's sub at
full last year, and scatback Jeri
McMillin have the inside track at
right half. Varsity squad mem
bers Doug Dick and Roy Stephen
showed great improvement this
spring.
Paul Camera, Jerry Angove and
Mickey Raferty, the first three
wingbacks from last year's eleven
are all back. Both Camera and
Angove are deadly pass receivers
and tough on defense.


CHUCK TAYLOR
Coach charts T-formation
This could be the year.
Stanford has not fielded a Rose
Bowl team since 1951 when Big
Bill McColl, the giant end. gained
Ail-American honors for the sec
ond consecutive year.
The Tribe scored nine straight
victories that year, Chuck Taylor's
maiden season in the Pacific Coast
Conference, before falling to Cali
fornia in Big Game and rugged Il
linois in the Rose Bowl.
Taylor's outfit next season will
boast the speediest and deepest in
some seasons. Quarterback John
Brodie, among the top ten passers
in the nation both of the last two
years, and All-American tackle
Paul Wiggin will form the nucleus
of next year's eleven.
Thin Line
The Big Red machine of 1956
claims a great deal of depth and
experience at end and in the back
field. From tackle to tackle, the
husky red-headed mentor faces a
problem.
Only one tackle, one center, and
three guards who earned letters at
those positions return from last
year's squad.
At tackle, Wiggin can hold down
the forte on one side. Steve Docter
and Rich Elliott, both lettermen
at end, have been switched to
tackle. John Kidd and Ward Mac-
Donald cavorted for the varsity
last year but did not earn letters.
Chris Plain, a giant 250-pounder
who moves like a cat, and rugged
Eric Protiva will also battle, for
tackle slots. Both sat out last sea
son because of injuries after play
ing freshman ball in 1954.
Cars well Returns
Donn Carswell, Noel Robinson
and Don Manoukian are the three
lettermen returning at guard.
Manoukian, built like a barrel but
awfully quick, showed about the
most improvement of any of the
Tribe gridders during spring prac
tice.
Behind this trio, Taylor will have
to count on untested sophomores
such as Bob Peterson, switched
from fullback, Troy Barbee, Don
Crosby and Ralph Koldinger.
The loss of Joe Long at center
leaves a big pair of shoes to fill
but any of three pivot men could
do the trick. Letterman Bob Long
has the edge right now because of
experience.
Roeh Conklin, a fast developing
youngster who played for the
Braves last year, and Russ Steele,
out for a year because of a leg in
jury, have the ability to' displace
Long.
Strong At End
Four lettermen, the star wing
man of the 1954 frosh team and
two of last year's yearling flank
men will be battling for the end
posts.

Brodie, among the top ten passers
in the nation both of the last two
years, and All-American tackle
Paul Wiggin will form the nucleus
of next year's eleven.
Thin Line
The Big Red machine of 1956
claims a great deal of depth and
experience at end and in the back
field. From tackle to tackle, the
husky red-headed mentor faces a
problem.
Only one tackle, one center, and
three guards who earned letters at
those positions return from last
year's squad.
At tackle, Wiggin can hold down
the forte on one side. Steve Docter
and Rich Elliott, both lettermen
at end, have been switched to
tackle. John Kidd and Ward Mac-
Donald cavorted for the varsity
last year but did not earn letters.
Chris Plain, a giant 250-pounder
who moves like a cat, and rugged
Eric Protiva will also battle, for
tackle slots. Both sat out last sea
son because of injuries after play
ing freshman ball in 1954.
Cars well Returns
Donn Carswell, Noel Robinson
and Don Manoukian are the three
lettermen returning at guard.
Manoukian, built like a barrel but
awfully quick, showed about the
most improvement of any of the
Tribe gridders during spring prac
tice.
Behind this trio, Taylor will have
to count on untested sophomores
such as Bob Peterson, switched
from fullback, Troy Barbee, Don
Crosby and Ralph Koldinger.
The loss of Joe Long at center
leaves a big pair of shoes to fill
but any of three pivot men could
do the trick. Letterman Bob Long
has the edge right now because of
experience.
Roeh Conklin, a fast developing
youngster who played for the
Braves last year, and Russ Steele,
out for a year because of a leg in
jury, have the ability to' displace
Long.
Strong At End
Four lettermen, the star wing
man of the 1954 frosh team and
two of last year's yearling flank
men will be battling for the end
posts.
Jerry Beatie, Gary Van Galder
and Carl Isaacs all saw plenty of
front line action last year. Bob
Gergen, small but rugged for an
end, started several games as a
sophomore two years ago.
Sticky-fingered Joel Freis, a

tricky runner once he gets his
hands on the ball, saved a year of
eligibility last year after starring
for the freshmen two seasons
back.
Frosh Ben Robinson and Dennie
Farrar both showed talent in the
final spring scrimmage last Satur
day.
Too Many Backs
In the backfield Coach Taylor
faces the same problem as the old
lady who lives in a shoe. He has
more backs than he knows what
to do wilh.
Brodie, one of the nation's top
passers, will face stiff competition
for his signal calling post. Letter
men Jackie Douglas and Jack Tay
lor, the latter a former fullback,
are both strong runners, passers
and defensive backs.
Sophomore.Les Hopkins, a for
mer Brave, and freshmen Jim
Ukropina and Bob Nicolet all
showed flashes of excellence in
spring ball.
Coach Taylor has made some
switches among his more talented
running backs. Gordy Young,
small at 185 pounds but a hard
runner, has been moved to full
back. Shifty A 1 Harrington will
do his running from right half
back.
Young At Full
Joining Young at the deep back
position are Archie Schmitt,
Chuck Shea and Lou Valli. Schmitt
is the highly regarded transfer
from Taft Junior College. Shea
saw duty with the varsity last year
after a season at Menlo JC.
Valli saw action in only a few
games last year because of a knee
injury. The explosive soph sat out
spring practice because of the in
jury.
Harrington, Bill Tarr's sub at
full last year, and scatback Jeri
McMillin have the inside track at
right half. Varsity squad mem
bers Doug Dick and Roy Stephen
showed great improvement this
spring.
Paul Camera, Jerry Angove and
Mickey Raferty, the first three
wingbacks from last year's eleven
are all back. Both Camera and
Angove are deadly pass receivers
and tough on defense.

This could be the year.
Stanford has not fielded a Rose
Bowl team since 1951 when Big
Bill McColl, the giant end. gained
Ail-American honors for the sec
ond consecutive year.
The Tribe scored nine straight
victories that year, Chuck Taylor's
maiden season in the Pacific Coast
Conference, before falling to Cali
fornia in Big Game and rugged Il
linois in the Rose Bowl.
Taylor's outfit next season will
boast the speediest and deepest in
some seasons. Quarterback John
Brodie, among the top ten passers
in the nation both of the last two
years, and All-American tackle
Paul Wiggin will form the nucleus
of next year's eleven.
