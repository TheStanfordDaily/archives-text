# Expert Says Big Problem of Africa Is Race Conflict
## 
### 
The biggest problem by far in
South Africa today is ihe conflict
between whites and Africans, said
Dr. Alfred Fisk, world traveler
and lecturer, at a talk yesterday
afternoon at Bowman Alumni
House.
All major problems Inevitably
arising from this initial conflict
would be considerably eased if the
race situation could be reconciled,
Fisk said. Originally, the whites
came into the Union of South Af
rica and treated the inhabitants in
such a manner that a tremendous
hatred for them arose.
Now the whites, who are out
numbered four to one, live in con
stant fear of the colored people.
Their policemen, who, never trav
el in groups of less than four,
commonly carry sub-machineguns
for protection.
Fisk said neither the whites nor
the Africans feel that one group
is superior to the other; it is just
that the two peoples are different.
They prefer find demand to live
separately.
The Union of South Africa's
Liberal Party says that "ultimate
ly the Africans will have a state
of their own. African dentists will
pull African teeth, white dentists
pull white teeth. There will be
two separate states; two sepa
rate economies."
At present, there are five dif
ferent racial groups in the terri
tory, each of which is to be placed
in separate communities, accord
ing to Liberal Party plans, Fisk
said.
In addition, their religious be
liefs, resulting from a combina
tion of Dutch Reformed and Cal
vinism. stress that God ordained
that there were to be separate
racial groups in the world.
