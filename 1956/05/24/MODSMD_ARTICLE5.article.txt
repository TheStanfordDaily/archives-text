### 
The story of racial integration
is "a story of a social revolution
that has occurred within the life
time of most of us in this room."
This was how Franklin Wil
liams. Western Regional Director
of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored Peo
ple, described, the story behind
the 1954 Supreme Court decision
against racial segregation in
schools.
In 1934 a group of Negroes met
at Howard Institute in a Negro
intercollegiate fraternity confer
ence. At this meeting, the ques
tion of getting more Negroes into
professional fiejds was brought
up.
"Startling" Theory
One of the members there was
attorney Charles Houston, a mem
ber of the legal staff of NAACP,
who proposed the "startling" the
ory that through use of a series
of legal cases school segregation
could be declared unconstitution
al. His theory was given a try.
Maryland was picked as the
state, a Negro named Donald Mur
ray became the candidate and in
1935 the Maryland Supreme Court
ruled that when a state provided
opportunities for graduate educa
tion for one segment of its cit
izenry it must provide Ihe same
opportunity for all segments.
Since Maryland has no law
school for Negroes, Murray was
admitted to the University of
Maryland Law School.
Separate Hut Kqnal
In 1951 a Supreme Court fie
cision destroyed th e classical
'separate but equal" doctrine in
law schools by its decision that
lawyers, if they are to practice in
front of white judges, must have
the opinions and contacts of white
prospective lawyers in the class
rooms.
It was only a matter of time for
abolished. NAACP got together
segregation to be completely
abolished. NAACP got together
six test cases involving all levels
of education and different types
I of state laws. The 1954 decision
â–  was the successful climax of
these cases.
