# Kreps, Horn See Election Victory for Ike
## Two Faculty Members Debate Issues for '56 Before Political Union 
### Joan Woods 
Dwight Eisenhower will be re
elected next November, according
to Theodore of the Busi
ness School and Robert A. Horn
of the political science depart
ment.
The two men spoke yesterday
in Cubberlcy Auditorium on "The
Issues for '56."
Kreps, speaking for the Demo
cratic side, and Horn, giving the
Republican view of the issues,
found many other areas of agree
ment, but not enough to prevent
some colorful political sniping.
Kreps, former economic adviser
to Presidents Roosevelt and Tru
man, spoke first. He said the
Democrats are divided into three
groups, "the largest of which
elected Eisenhower."
This group is largely satisfied
with the Eisenhower Administra
tion's continuation of New Deal
reforms and will vote for him
again this November. He said
they hold the opinion that the
"second team sat on the bench so
long they got a little irresponsible
in their Monday morning quarter
backing."
Second Team
These people believe in giving
the second team a chance, but
"only when the first team is way
ahead in the score."
The second camp in the Demo
cratic party ranks is the one sup
porting Estes Kefauver. Kreps
sairl the strategy for this group is
to wage the kind of a campaign
battle that Harry Truman did in
1948.
These Democrats could write
such a liberal platform that the
South would be lost but the North
would be united, he said. Minority
groups and the farm vote would
be appealed to on a vigorous anti
monopoly, civil rights platform.
The third group supports the
"eggheads' darling," Adlai Stev
enson. A scholar and a statesman,
Stevenson would not stand for
such "nonsense as ino per cent
parity," but would be moderate in
his farm and civil rights policies,
promising only what he felt he
could accomplish. "He would rath
er stand for something he believes
he can do, than win. As a result
he will lose."
Nomination
Kreps predicted that Stevenson
would receive the nomination over
Kefauver. This statement is inter
esting in view of the fact that
Kreps is an active campaigner for
Kefauver in the Bay Area. He
does not feel that Kefauver could
win even if he received the nomi
nation this summer.
Horn began his talk'on the is
sues for '56 by saying there are
no issues in this election. "It is
the greatest tribute that could be
paid to the Eisenhower Adminis
tration."
The only iss u e, he said, is
whether an administration with
such a record of accomplishment
should be continued in office.
Among the Republican achieve
ments he cited were establishing
peace in Korea and stopping in
flat ion.
He said the purchasing power
of the dollar has remained fairly
constant and the budget balanced
with reduced taxes. The farm re
volt is only Democratic talk and
is actually non-existent, he said.
Farm Policy
He attacked the Democratic
farm policy with the words, "The
only farm commodity the Demo
crats are interested in is farm
| votes."
Horn accused the "Democratic
high command" of losing touch
with reality and practicing the
"most cynical kind of block poli
tics auction-block politics."
The Democrats have a "crisis
mentality," he said, and "where
they have not found a crisis they
have made one. They present ev
ory issue of public policy in glori
ous Technicolor, wide screen and
stereophonic sound."
