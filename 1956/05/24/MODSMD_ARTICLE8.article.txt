# Cast Shows Quick Exhilaration Of Spirits in Players' Comedy
## 'Love's Labour's Lost' Sets, Costumes Catch Mood Charmingly with Make-Believe Elegance 
### Terry Comito 
If the Stanford Players sometimes miss the sharp sense of style
of "Loves' Labour's Lost—and, incidentally, of their own designer
James Stearns—they nevertheless catch the quick exhilaration of
high spirits that is, after all, the show's chief delight.
The slender tale of plotting lovers is carried off in a holiday mood.

Shakespeare knows his "gaudy
blossoms" can't last, but for the
time, nothing seems more beauti
ful than love, nothing more excit
ing than words.
If he makes fun of lovers and
poets, it's only because he is him
self so enthusiastically both. All
his excesses are meant to be en
joyed as well as laughed at.
Steam's sets and costumes cap
ture and mood entirely and charm
ingly. Their elegance doesn't
stifle because it's so obviously
make-believe, more whimsical, in
fact, than really plush.
The action at its best suggests
the same sort of good-natured
artifice. Director Robert Loper
lets his full-skirted characters
flow and curtsey about the stage
like dancers. They're really people,
but they're playing a game—not
too solemn, but very precise.
Precision
Most of the precision belongs to
David O'Brien as Berowne. In his
sharpness of diction, his defini
tion, is the excuse for Shake
speare's verbal enthusiasms.
He's lithe, impudent, ingratiat
ing or maybe a surprising twist
reveals the real tenderness he
neath. The fact that he talks
j poetry at any rate and talks it
I lovingly, doesn't hinder his char
acterization but is the way he
achieves it.
Ellen Kay, too, as the Princess
of France has a really command
ing graciousncss, and Berenice
Boynton makes an engaging Rosa
line. But the actors, even when
i they achieve personality, lend to
| do it at the expense of poetry.
"Mushy"
Lacking the hard surface of
i O'Brien, their scenes often become
mushy and indistinct. Shake-
I speare's verbal wit, much of which
! is by now pretty obscure anyway,
sinks out of siKht.
Luckily Shakespeare's clowns
have, as well as their Elizabethan
puns, humor of a more basic sort
j that carries its own weight.
And the Players have a multi
j tude of perhaps inelegant but very
! funny clowns: Virginia Stone us
I much-handled and almost certain
slut; Robert Lehrer, a spiderous
Boyet; Lair Parent, a thunderous
I Mo femes.
William Kinsolving, although he
j misses some of the pathos In the
I part, is skillful enough as a some
(what distracted Armando.
The Players' production, iti
short, preserves with charm and
wit that part of Shakespeare's
play which ages best: his youth
I and irrepressible sense of fun.
