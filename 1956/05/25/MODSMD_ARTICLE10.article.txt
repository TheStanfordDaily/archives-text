# New Republic Editor Claims Costs Force Consolidation
## High Prices Cause Many Publications to Cater To Average IQ, Says Former Chappie Editor 
### Rich Brown 
Most communications arc mass communication because of high
costs, New Republic Editor Bruce Bliven, told a large Intermezzo audi
ence yesterday in the Library's Bender Room.
Stanford graduate Bliven, who was Chaparral editor in the spring
semester of 1911 and also worked on Sequoia, the Quad and San Fran-

Cisco Bulletin during his Stanford
days, spoke yesterday on "Mass
Communication and American
Taste."
High costs have forced many
newspapers to consolidate, he said,
and have for the most part caused
publications to cater to an average
IQ. "There are a few editors with
'Puritan' complexes. who try to
present something better than the
average," ho added.
The reeding audience can oc
casionally be guilty of trying to ap
pear snobbish.
Philosophy Book
Will Durant's hook on philos
ophy sold almost like a best seller,
for instance, but many people used
it only for display to impress their
neighbors.
The editor pointed out how re
cent the mass media trend has
been. Only in the past hundred
years has there been a concerted
effort at educating anyone except
the "gentlemen."
The idea is still developing
"American tastes are really get
ting better; give its another hun
dred years to see this develop
ment."
While Americans don't read as
many hooks, as stirh, as Euro'
peans, Bliven estimates they read
far more in magazines where
many books are run in serial form.
Television Powerful
Television, he said, is the new
est and most powerful of rommu
nications and is the greatest social
revolution since the automobile.
When 'Richard TTI* was produced
on TV, more people saw it in one
afternoon than had seen it in all
its performances since Shake
speare wrote It."
Comic books with their U.S.
sales of 70 million a week arc an
important mass media. He feels
the recent "clean-up" campaign
has had much effect, hut room for
improvement still exists.
The 25-cent publications are a
j growing field. Although the pres
ent percentages in that field show
a majority of "low class" stories,
there is a gro vv in g tendency
toward better quality.
Many more fine books are now
lacing reprinted in paperback edi
tions each year. Added to these
are an expanding number of good
works making their first appear
ance in 25-cent books.
