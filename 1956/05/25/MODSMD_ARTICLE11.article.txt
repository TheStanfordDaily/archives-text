# Truman Calls It ‘Hell of a World’

### 
ROME, May 24 (UP)—For
mer President Truman, fresh
from a. furor over a remark
about a "squirrel - headed gen
eral," confided today that "it's
a hell of a world."
But no one disagreed this
time. It. was much unlike the
situation Tuesday when the
word "squirrel-head'' crept into
a conversation about the World
War II landings at Salerno.
Truman apparently was re
ferring 1 to that furor today
when he gave newsmen a know
ing look and commented, "It's
a h«'|l of a world."
But ii benign smile accompa
nied Truman's remark. Both he
and the newsmen accompany
ing him on bis European vaca
tion trip appeared hopeful thai
the incident over a "squirrel
headed general" had been for
gotten.
