# Con Home Drive Will End Today With Hobo Carnival, Crowning of King & Queen
## Booths, Concessions, Kisses, Prizes Liquid Refreshments Also Offered 
### 
Con Home Drive winds up with a bang today with the Hobo Carni
val, whose main attraction will be the crowning of the Con Home king
and queen.
The carnival will be held from 2 to 6 p.m. at Mangini's Barn. En
trance fee is 25 cents and the theme is to "come hobo" although those

in more iormai ature win not be
discouraged, according to Tom
Pierce, drive chairman.
Twenty-three living groups have
set up booths, including the Delt's
Rat Race, Theta Xi's "Squirt-the-
Candle" and Ventura's "Douse-the-
Dolly."
Food booths will sell ice cream,
peanuts, cheese and crackers and
garlic bread. Five cent tickets will
be sold for use at the booths.
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler will crown the king and
queen, congratulating the latter
with a kiss. He will also inspect
the booths to choose the most
original.
Prizes will be awarded for the
best and most profitable booths.
Awards will also be given to the
tournament finals winners in ping
pong, foursome golf and other
games.
A certificate to Rudy's for "one
keg of liquid refreshment," do
nated by the junior class, will be
given to the living group or cor
ridor contributing the most per
capita for solicitations.
In spite of Wednesday's un
seasonable weather, more than
$500 was raised for the Con Home
by the Strawberry Brunch. All re
ceipts went to the drive, since in
gredients were donated by Palo
Alto merchants.
Off-campus solicitations which
were done by 50 freshmen couples
ended last night. Incomplete re
sults show that. $1,793.84 was
raised for the Home from the Palo
Alto and Menlo Park areas.
Living group solicitations end
today. So far, $616.81 has been col
lected from students.
