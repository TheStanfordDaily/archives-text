# Charlie Brown Trails Zinck In King Voting
## Winbigler to Tell Results of Voting Today at Carnival 
### 
Results of yesterday's voting in
the Con Home king and queen
contest show that "Flex" Zinck
still leads for king with 3654 votes
while Ginny Hagey remains ahead
for queen With 1463.
Close behind Zinck, a wrestler,
is Charlie Brown, who has 3567
votes. Some mystery surrounds
tho identity of this contender for
king, since no one .seems quite
sure whether this is the mythical
Charlie Brown of "Peanuts" fame
or a student in the geology de
partment.
Votes have been cast for him on
both assumptions, according to
contest personnel.
Sam, the Alpha De 11 boxer,
trails with 2695 votes.
"Toad" Getchell with 2158 votes
has dropped back to fourth place.
The nearest rival of Miss Ha
gey, who is a Roble freshman, is
A. M. Hendrickson, who has 1393.
No one seems quite certain of the
latter's identity, but he madfl
great gains in the closing minutes
of polling yesterday.
Interesting entries for the royal
honors include Harvey and Ron
nie Knox, entered for king and
queen respectively. Mamie Stover
has also been nominated, but none
of the three is a serious contender
for the titles.
Balloting continues today in
front of the Cellar from 9 a.m. to
3 p.m. To add to the suspense, all
voting will be secret. The results
will be announced by Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler at the
Hobo Carnival about 4:30, at
which time the winners will be
crowned.
