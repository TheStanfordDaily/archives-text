## 
### 
No word has been received as
yet from Pacific Coast Confer
ence officials on the proposed in
vestigation of alleged "irregulari
ties" in the athletic program at:
the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
Last night, as the final PCC
spring meeting closed, the offi
cials announced that they would
investigate any charges brought
agairfst a conference school.
.T, Miller Leavy, a UCLA alumni
hoard member, sent them "docu
mented charges" of PCC code vio
lations by USC. The last word
was that the officials might call
a special meeting to consider this
evidence.
