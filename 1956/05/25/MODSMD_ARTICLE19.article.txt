# Those Poor ‘Boys'

-*Thk kids aren't looking for the handout,
inil they are almost forced to'take it."
Harvey Knox, spokesman extraordinaire for
Harvey Knox and family, made this statement
Monday night in connection with the Pacific
Coast Conference's action which took a year's
eligibility from each merribft of the I9~). r ) UCLA
freshmen and varsity football teams.
Papa Knox's statement containing the usual
mixture of hot air and sour grapes came as no
surprise, hut statements of a similar type by the
American Civil Liberties Union and by State
Senator Richard Richards reach us in another
light.
We have always considered both the ACLU
and Richards as two of the best spokesmen for
individual rights we have known. However,
they are way off base in the PCC case.
The ACLU asked reconsideration of the pun
ishment on the basis that the Bruin athletes
were "guilty until proven innocent" of receiv
ing money in excess of the $75 a month allowed
under I lie PCC Coda.
Does the Civil Liberties Union propose a jury
trial for tin*, tramp athletes? They were not
convicted of violations under existing American
civil laws but under a Pacific Coast Conference
code which lliey had agreed lo respect.
The athletes are guilty. Anyone who has been
on the UCLA campus elm tell first hand what
has been going on these past seven years. The
facts of guilt are in black and white for anyone
to see, including the Civil Liberties Union.
However, if any athlete can produce facts

proving In* is not guilty (which we seriously
doubt) then the PCC will reinstate hint. \\ e kcc
no violation of "civil liberties* in that.
Richards' statements echo those of Papa
Knox. He claims the Bruin players should he
reinstated immediately and the hlame placed
"on the adults who are responsible for this
„ *9
mess.
The PCC is not dealing with children. As
San Francisco Chronicle columnist Vt ill Con
nolly said, "These are not 'hoys.' They are
shrewd and designing young men . . . they don't
steal cars or burglarize a supermarket hut the
taking of money under the table is no less im
moral, considering their academic advantages.
They should know better, otherwise we give
up.
We hope every athlete guilty of a PCC viola
tion is punished, as well as every administrator
or coach who lias condoned or encouraged such
conduct or who has been negligent enough to
let such things 11 is very nose.
Otherwise American education as practiced on
the Pacific Const lias become a hypocritical
farce.
At Stanford such violations would be pun
ished under tin- Fundamental Standard, for the
PCC Code is a regulation agreed to by the Uni
versity and hence by the Stanford athlete.
Other less enlightened schools may let their
students gel away with such flagrant violations
of personal honor, but at Stanford punishment
would certainly be harsher than merely ban
ning players from the gridiron for a year.
The "boys" are getting off liglil indeed.
