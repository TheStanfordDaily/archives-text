# Shortsighted Action

### 
Dropping a wft blanket on the enthusiasm
and optimism of the students working on next
yeai's Model United Nations, Legislature Wed
nesday night temporarily limited to 400 the
number of delegates attending the scheduled
conference.
Such action would he justified if the investi
gation being conducted now by the Model UN
steering committee had indicated that facilities
at Stanford and the surrounding area could not
accommodate a larger body of students.
But this is not the case.
Steering committee chairman Chuck Reyn
olds estimates there is sufficient housing at
hotels and motels in the area to accommodate
up to 1000 students and dining room facilities
for more than 600 delegates.
The main difficulty, according to the com
mittee, will he scheduling classrooms and time.
Upon this, they say, will depend the number
of visitors they can handle.
In its enviable position of being one of the
most respected universities in the country, Stan
lord has the opportunity to make an outstand

ing contribution to the furtherance of the al
ready successful tradition of the Model United
Nations.
Rather than limiting the number of dele
gates for the sake of convenience, Stanford
might go a little out of its way to make next
year's conference the most successful ever held.
We agree that large numbers alone do not
constitute a good conference, but a .skillfully
managed conference giving more schools the
opportunity to semi mpre delegates will do
much to provide a better understanding of the
principles and practices of international organ
ization, at the same time setting the Model UN
oil more stable foundations.
The committee said no commitment would
be made until next year, but Legislature, by its
insistence that I lie number be limited to 400
until the matter is brought up again early in
autumn quarter, intimated its lack of interest
in the matter and conservative concern over the
slight inconvenience a large conference might
cause Stanford-- a case of counting each tree
and missing the forest.
