### FRANK HUNTRESS 
Officials «»f" the Pacific Coast Conference are
making history this month hy cleaning up the
conference.
Only one other con for cure has /ml the
squeeze on a school as light as the I'CC has done
to llieir members. The Soul Incest C(inference
banned Texas A&M from the C.otlon Ifoul for
three years.
The Aggies are now oil" probation. Their
(loach Hear Bryant is under constant surveil
lance. Big Ten put Ohio Stale on ice for two
\ »'ars.
In the PCC, hoth Washington and UCLA
have "taken gas" and the fumes are spreading
over to USC. It is this writer's guess that Stan
ford will have a paved road to the Hose Howl
hy the time the gas stops spreading.
USC has said that if they get "it" they will
tell on Cal ami Stanford. Hoth schools have
publicly naiil that they are as pure as hoiled
water. *
I'alo Alto Times Sports Editor Wall dam
age asked Coacli Chlick Taylor before he left
last weekend to attend the I'CC meeting at Van
couver if he honestly felt that Stanford icas in
the clear as far as living up to the conference
rides.
Taylor replied, "I certainly do. I'll say this:

I'm not troubled with a guilty conscience. I
sleep well every night."
Southern Cal has been charged with paying
out $71,235 over a two-year period in "secret
aid" to athletes.
PCC officials arii acting on the charge now
and USC is expected to he penalized. If so, the
Indians have their chief competition eliminated
in their quest for the Hose Howl bid.
Earlier UCLA was banned from the howl for
three years with an estimated income loss of
$100,000. Washington is ineligible for two years
with a $53,000 fine.
UCLA's Cureton Hardiman, a senior, said he
has attended swimming parties when' Trojan
players dire f«>r dimes and llie person coming
n/t with one gels a new suit of clothes, liommio
Loudd, another liruin lold of instances where
USC. offered above the $75 limit.
Konnie Knox, one of the Bruins who was de
clared ineligible, said he will prove his in
nocence in an effort to play next year.
All in all the PCC action is a brave one —one
which may spread to other conferences. For we
agree with the statement "It's a privilege, not
an inherent right," San Francisco writer Will
Connolly said, "to play a game in the colors of
a college."
