# Sam McDonald Reminisces About Beginning of Barbecue
## Former Grounds Superintendent Continues Con Home Contact in Spite of Amputation 
### Ellen Spiegl 
"Sam McDonald had a farm," goes the old folk song. But Stanford's
Sam McDonald still has a far m, and, instead of animals, people and
children inhabit the local Sam McDonald's farm.
In spite of his retirement two years ago and a serious illness which
resulted in the loss of his legs, the former superintendent of athletic

fields and grounds has continued
his active association with the
Convalescent Home children.
Sam used to visit the Con Home
often, par ticipated as a leader for
the Boy Scout program and took
an active part in the Con Home
barbecue every year.
This year, after his illness, Sam
visited "his youngsters" occasion
ally, supervised at the barbecue
last night and has donated the
royalties from his recent book,
"Sam McDonald's Farm," to Con
Home.
Barbecue Beginning
In his enthusiastic voice, Sam
tells the story of the beginning
of his barbecuing fame. When he
first started working at Stanford
in 1903 he became friendly with
many of the students who worked
with him.
He occasionally invited them
into his horpe near the track field
for a sandwich. "Then it grew to
more of the boys and their lady
friends all going out for a party,"
Sam "They were the ones
who said I could barbecue, and
talked about it so much I began
to believe it."
Beside his continuing work with
the Con Home children, Sam leads
an active life. He calls his recent
illness "a blessing in disguise" be
cause it taught him "how to live
for other people's joy."
Sam has plans already for writ
ing another book soon this one
about his 'new life."
Students' Kindness
Sam says Stanford students and
other friends, through their kind
ness while he was ill, gave him
"the desire to live that I'd lost
when 1 got sick."
"The Rally Com saved my life,"
he said referring to the Big flame
dedication last year. "I didn't
know so many people could he so
nice."
Of all his recent honors â€” in
cluding an honorary membership
in Stanford Alumni Association
and being honored guest at tin 1
barbecue Sam says, "It's so emo
tional. It's just too much."
With his remarkable memory
for the thousands of names of all
of his friends, Sam is still anxious
to make new friends. People are
his life, and with his wry smile
he always says to anyone he
meets: "Come see me sometime.
I like to know people."
