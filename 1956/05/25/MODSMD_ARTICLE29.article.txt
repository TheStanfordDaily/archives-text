# On Campus With Max Shulman
## TILL WE MEET AGAIN 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy With Cheek," etc 
1 always find myself yawning hugely when a comedian,
having finished his act, steps out in front of the curtain,
takes off his putty nose, assumes a sincere stance, and de
livers an oration full of tender and lofty sentiments.
So how come I'm doing precisely the same thing right now?
Two reasons. First, because I couldn't possibly make you
laugh at this time of the year; cramming for finals has left
you wan, woebegone, and in no mood for mnocent merriment.
Second, because this is the last column of the current
series, and I'd be a liar if I didn't admit I was just a tiny
bit choked up.
It was two years ago that the makers of Philip Morris
asked me to write this column. My first impulse, frankly,
was to say no. Though 1 am a man who likes a dollar as well
as the next fellow, my talents just do not seem to lead me
in the direction of writing advertising copy. When called
upon to rhapsodize about soap or sox or cigarettes, 1 get to
giggling uncontrollably and have to be helped home.
"Buddies," said I to the makers of Philip Morris, "I smoke
Philip Morris myself, and I think it's a jim-dandy cigarette.
But that's all I think it is —a cigarette. Not a graven image.
Not a love object. Just a smoke. I'm afraid 1 can't get rev
erent enough to write ad copy for you."
To my astonishment, thfcy seemed delighted. "Reverence
is not required," said the people at Philip Morris. They fis
sured me that 1 would not be required to write fulsome com
mercials — that I could rib the cigarette and the company all
I liked —that my columns would be mine alone, with no
editing, no suggestions, and no supervision.
"Hah!" I said by way of reply.
But they kept insisting and finally, my thin breast full of
misgivings, I went to work.
For the first few weeks they were scrupulously true to
their words. Not one syllable, not one comma, was ever
changed; not,one quarter-ounce of pressure was ever exerted.
But my doubts were not laid to rest. "When will the honey
moon be over?" I kept asking myself.

The answer, gentle readers, is that the honeymoon is
still going on. This finishes my second year for Philip Morris.
During that time, though I'm sure my copy caused an occa
sional conniption fit in the boardroom, my carte blanche has
remained as blanche as the day it was issued. Whatever I've
perpetrated in this column has been, as they guaranteed,
mine alone.
They've been living dolls, the makers of Philip Morris,
and I think I may be forgiven for getting a trifle misty. And
as long as the stops are out, let me say that it's also been a
big charge writing for you, the college population of America.
Your response has warmed my old heart, and on the occasions
when I've visited your campuses, it's been deeply gratifying
to see that you're still as pleasantly disorganized as ever.
1 figure that as long as the likes of you exist, I'm in business.
So, for now, goodbye. Stay well. Stay happy. Stay loose.
Shulman, 1956
Old Max hiis said it all. We, the makers of I'liilip Morris, ran only
add a heartfelt second chorus: Stay well. Stay happy. Stay loose.

is not required," said the people at Philip Morris. They fis
sured me that 1 would not be required to write fulsome com
mercials — that I could rib the cigarette and the company all
I liked —that my columns would be mine alone, with no
editing, no suggestions, and no supervision.
"Hah!" I said by way of reply.
But they kept insisting and finally, my thin breast full of
misgivings, I went to work.
For the first few weeks they were scrupulously true to
their words. Not one syllable, not one comma, was ever
changed; not,one quarter-ounce of pressure was ever exerted.
But my doubts were not laid to rest. "When will the honey
moon be over?" I kept asking myself.

The answer, gentle readers, is that the honeymoon is
still going on. This finishes my second year for Philip Morris.
During that time, though I'm sure my copy caused an occa
sional conniption fit in the boardroom, my carte blanche has
remained as blanche as the day it was issued. Whatever I've
perpetrated in this column has been, as they guaranteed,
mine alone.
They've been living dolls, the makers of Philip Morris,
and I think I may be forgiven for getting a trifle misty. And
as long as the stops are out, let me say that it's also been a
big charge writing for you, the college population of America.
Your response has warmed my old heart, and on the occasions
when I've visited your campuses, it's been deeply gratifying
to see that you're still as pleasantly disorganized as ever.
1 figure that as long as the likes of you exist, I'm in business.
So, for now, goodbye. Stay well. Stay happy. Stay loose.

1 always find myself yawning hugely when a comedian,
having finished his act, steps out in front of the curtain,
takes off his putty nose, assumes a sincere stance, and de
livers an oration full of tender and lofty sentiments.
So how come I'm doing precisely the same thing right now?
Two reasons. First, because I couldn't possibly make you
laugh at this time of the year; cramming for finals has left
you wan, woebegone, and in no mood for mnocent merriment.
Second, because this is the last column of the current
series, and I'd be a liar if I didn't admit I was just a tiny
bit choked up.
It was two years ago that the makers of Philip Morris
asked me to write this column. My first impulse, frankly,
was to say no. Though 1 am a man who likes a dollar as well
as the next fellow, my talents just do not seem to lead me
in the direction of writing advertising copy. When called
upon to rhapsodize about soap or sox or cigarettes, 1 get to
giggling uncontrollably and have to be helped home.
"Buddies," said I to the makers of Philip Morris, "I smoke
Philip Morris myself, and I think it's a jim-dandy cigarette.
But that's all I think it is —a cigarette. Not a graven image.
Not a love object. Just a smoke. I'm afraid 1 can't get rev
erent enough to write ad copy for you."
To my astonishment, thfcy seemed delighted. "Reverence
is not required," said the people at Philip Morris. They fis
sured me that 1 would not be required to write fulsome com
mercials — that I could rib the cigarette and the company all
I liked —that my columns would be mine alone, with no
editing, no suggestions, and no supervision.
