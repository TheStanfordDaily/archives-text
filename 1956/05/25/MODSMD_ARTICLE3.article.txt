# Summer President, VP, Other Officers Approved by LASSU
## Wednesday's Action Combines Charity Drives; Axe Handbook, Con Home Barbecue Criticized 
### 
Twenty-year-old junior Art Gorli was approved as summer quarter
student body president by Legislature in their weekly meeting last
Wednesday night.
Godi, an economics major, transferred to Stanford last fall from
Stockton College where he served as student body president.

Serving with him in the sum
mer student government will be
vice-president Hall Sealy and Leg
islature members Joan Bennett,
John Binns and Neil Popiano,
who were chosen by tryout last
week.
Legislature also heard a discus
sion of the relative merits of one
rather than two annual charity
drives and decided that there shall
be one large drive next year, sub
ject to change by next year's Leg
islature and Drives Committee.
One Drive
Under this system the two
drives committees would be com
bined into one and work with dou
ble strength to contact parts of
the campus that have not been
contacted before, according to Jim
Sammet.
All drives except Con Home
would be concerted into one week
â€”a "holy week," as Sammet de
scribed it during which all other
campus activities would be kept
to a minimum.
An eager fan of the Con Home
barbecue, Malcolm Maddy, pro
tested to Legislature the conver
sion of the barbecue from an all
campus function to a "freshman
activity." .
ASSU student financial mana
ger Bill TooJey suggested that
Cardinals be urged to make ar
rangements next year for upper
classmen who wished to attend
the barbecue.
Activity Handbook
The way in which the Axe So
ciety Activity Handbook was writ
ten this year came in for sharp
rebuke from several members of
Legislature, especially Bobby
Clark, who suggested that the
handbooks be burned.
Legislature decided that send
ing the handbooks to freshmen
i prior to their arrival at Stanford
would put too much pressure on
I them to enter activities. The hand
I books will be passed out to the
j freshmen after they arrive.
Composition of the planned
i Parking and Traffic Advisory
j Bon I'd was approved by the legis
| la tors. Also approved were chang-
I es in the Women's Recreation As
sociation bylaws.
