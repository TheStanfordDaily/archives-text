# Crews Row Here for Last Time Tomorrow Before Leaving for Olympic, IRA Races
## 
### Jerry Kelly 
"Stanford's varsity crew could
very well surprise the nation
when il rows against the coun
try's best in the U. S. Olympic try
outs next month."
That's the adept opinion of In
dian mentor Lou Lindsey and oili
er California crew racing special
ists who have observed practice
and warm-up trends in this the
"Big Year" for rowing.
"We're aiming at the Olym
pics," Lindsey said, "and we all
l'eel we have a good chance to
represent the United States in
Australia despite little national
recognition to date."
Plan of Attack
From all indications, that's the
plan ol attack for the Card crew.
The varsity members leave Cali
fornia June 10 for Lake Onon
daga near Syracuse, N. Y., where
they will challenge the nation's
best II shells in the Intercollegi
ate Rowing Association Regatta,
June Mi, and then compete in the
Olympic tryouts on the same
course June 28 to :■{().
Lindsey has his "fired-up" var
sity on the watt r in intensive
drills an hour extra a day, work
ing out six days a week. The oars
men practice on a 2000 - meter
course (approximately 1M - mile
distance) now the distance trav
eled in the Olympic tryouts.
"We're working on the shorter
distance and sprints until a week
before the Regatta, with the
Olympic success in mind," the
energetic admiral admitted. "Our
varsity has rowed the three-mile
course 11lie designated IRA dis
tance] in competition and has
proved its ability there."
Assumption
In formulating his assumption
of a "Stanford surprise," Coach
Lindsey outlined the national
lowing trends and conditions this
year. As he explained, the Eastern
schools, including Cornell, the de
fending IRA champ, have had
great difficulty finding favorable
practice weather this year. There
fore, all 1 lie teams in the East are
far behind Schedule in training
so far behind it is probable that

Saturday morning will be the last chance for local water
racing fans to see the Stanford Rowing Association in action.
The first annual inter-class race will he the feature on the Red
wood City course, with the sophomore hoat holding the favorites
role.
Also on the agenda will he a mixed girls-hoys race (four girls
in each shell with four crew members) and a varsity-jayvee-frosh
race. The new shell, the Redwood Warrior, will he christened at
the boat house.

the necessary rugged condition
ing will not be accomplished by
June.
The University of Washington
Huskies are, therefore, picked as
the crew to beat, and on paper
that's rightly so. Washington out
lasted Stanford onLake Washing
ton. Seattle, by two lengths and
stretched almost five lengths
ahead of California on the Oak
land Estuary three-mile course.
However, Lindsey has several
p 1 a us ib 1 e explanations which,
when analyzed, seem fair. Prob
ably the biggest determinant in
Seattle was the fact that the
Cards were using their newly pur
chased shell, the "Redwood War

rior," for the first time, and that
after only one afternoon workout
in it.
In addition, the Indians had
only one afternoon's practice on
Lake Washington, after flying to
the northern city that same morn
ing, and most of the time was uti
lized in making oar and seating
adjustments. Thirdly, the lake
was choppy with a crosswind un
familiar to Stanford rowers.
