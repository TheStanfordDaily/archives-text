# Sterling Talks At Dedication Of Wilbur Hall
## Says Wilbur Helped Establish New Athletic Board, Sponsor Plan 
### 
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's
third president, was instrumental
in the establishment of the inter
fraternity council, the athletic
board and the expansion of resi
dence facilities in which student
sponsors would perform services
of guidance and supervision, Pres
ident Wallace Sterling said at the
Wilbur Hall dedication Saturday.
Sterling and Ray Lyman Wil
bur Jr. were the principal speak
ers at the dedication of the new
$3% million freshman men's dor
mitory.
More than 200 people heard
Sterling describe Dr. Wilbur as
"a man who took a long stride
. . . matched by the sweep of his
mind.
"Hir knowledge of nature, his
knowledge of man and man's his
tory was broad and deep, and he
brought this knowledge to the
service of Stanford.
Student Confidence
"For student government as we
know it, we can thank Dr. Wil
bur's confidence in the students
and his concern to have them
share actively in their own devel
opment," Sterling continued.
Under his influence a welcome
was extended to new students
through assemblies and convoca
tions, replacing the "outmoded
practices of hazing."
Ray Lyman Wilbur Jr., son of
Stanford's former president, men
tioned "with sadness the passing
of Encina Hall as the men's fresh
man dormitory."
Necessary Transition
"But the necessary transition
from Encina to Wilbur is a proud
one for us. My father found little
patience for those who wanted
Stanford to remain the same
while all about them in their
homes and business life, changes
were going on.
"My father had a deep perpet
ual interest in youth and a pene
trating insight on their prob
lems," he said. "He was tolerant
of their errors and failures so
long as they tried."
After the dedication, the hall
was opened to the public.
