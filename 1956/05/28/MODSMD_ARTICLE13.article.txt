# 'Sour-Grape-itis'
## 
### 
o\f. of America's most respected educators,
Robert Cordon Sproul, has been attacked by a
group of little men from Southern California
who intimate that the UC president is biased
toward Berkeley athletics at the expense of
those at LJ( iLA.
A Los Angeles City Councilman, Ernest E.
Debs, made the ridiculous charge that Sproul
'"has worked against development of UCLA."
Other members of the L.A. council had not
1 lie courage of Debs' convictions, and their final
resolution read only that the northern confer
ence members were trying to wreck UCLA and
use.
Every day since the UCLA ban has dawned
with the newspapers full of sour grapes, what
one would expect from the "win at all costs"
school of thought exemplified by Harvey Knox
and other victory-crazed Southern California
football backers.
But to hear such petty comment from a group
of supposedly responsible civic administrators
iy indeed disheartening.
Their charges are false, and we dare anyone

with similar statements to spew to the four
winds to honestly hay they are any more llian
the petty mouthings of those afflicted with
"Bour-grape-itis."
Vie know the University of California has
been guilty of P( 1(! rule violations—but this
does not mean that a man of the stature of
Robert Gordon Sproul has either condoned
such practice or "has worked against the de
velopment of UCLA" — except that he has
worked against the development of an atmos
phere at UCLA and at Cal which would lead
to further PCC violations, which in turn lead
to what Stanford President Wallace Sterling
calls "the corruption of youth."
Such work is Dr. Sprout's job, one which he
has carried out extremely well, despite the pet
tiness of the likes of Ernest Debs of the Los
Angeles City Council.
We suggest that the next time Mr. Debs wants
to throw around his false and unfair accusa
tions he piek on someone of his own intellectual
stature, someone who could answer his charges
without stooping too low to make it worth
while.
