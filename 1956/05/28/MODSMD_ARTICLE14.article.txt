# The 						Courage of Willie Morris
## 
### 
Till'. MOST POTENT PEN in college journalism
has been stilled; Daily Texan editor Willie
Morris has ended his career at the University
of Texas.
In this age of apathetic conformity Morris
has been a fighter for those of us who still be
lieve the key to happiness lies within the indi
vidual, who decry a channeling of thoughts into
patterns "in the best interests of collective se
curity," who decry this forgetfulness of free
dom's fundamentals.
Who will take Willie Morris' place? Where
is the college editor who will stand up to the
governing board of his university and demand
rights of free expression even though such ex
pression "is not in the best interests of the
university"?
Where? Practically nowhere. Few have the

insight to follow any thoughts hut those direct
ed from above, as it were. Most do not .have the
intelligence to even eare about such problems.
They, like most of their fellow students, are
smug in their great materialism: "Hell, why
be philosophical? I have a new car. Why cause
any trouble? Things are dandy just the way
they are."
And of the few who are wise enough to see
the h reakdown of freedom in the materialism
of American society —how many of them will
have the courage of Willie Morris?
Yes, we'll miss Willie Morris, his strength
and his courage. Some day the world at large
will wake up and find they have no more Willie
Morrises in their midst.
Then we will have reached the end of the
line—too late to turn back.
