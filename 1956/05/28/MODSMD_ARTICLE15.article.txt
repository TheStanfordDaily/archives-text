# This Week on Quad
## Daily Preparing to Hibernate As Memorial Day, June Come Along 
### JIM PALMER 
As Volume 129 concludes its existence this
week 011 Quad, The Daily goes into hibernation
after Friday's issue. It will have a busy last
week from which to recover.
Things start out quietly with a discussion on
asexual reproduction and end up with a clang
of cymbals at a Stanford Symphonic Band and
Brass Choir concert Sunday. Along the way
we'll celebrate Memorial Day (with classes as
usual) and welcome the month of June to the
campus.
* * *
Monday gets the week under way with a
School of Mineral Sciences Journal Club meet
ing on "Engineering Geology of the California
Water Plan" at 4 p.m. Fifteen minutes later the
Department of Biological Sciences Seminar con
siders "A Comparative Study of the Dodeca
ceria with Special Reference to Asexual Repro
duction, and Their Relation to Calceraeous Ma
terials."
These topics arc designed to wake a dull day
bright with intellectual discovery. Ifut you may
he kept wondering how they fit into the Great
Scheme of Things. After all, dodecaceria with•
out sex are like calendars without Monroe.
Speaking of heavenly bodies, at 8:30 the ama
teur astronomers gel out tluyr telescopes to
observe Saturn, Jupiter and Venus. All are wel
come in this pursuit (but don't let the stars get
in your eyes).
* * *
'"Romeo et Juliette is the Tuesday Evening
Series presentation, and under ihe baton of
Sandor Salgo will be the Stanford Symphony
< )rchestra.
"Japan—Occupation and After" will b<> the
topic of a lecture by Dr. Kurt Steiner of the
political science department at 8 p.m. Tuesday
in Bowman Alumni House. Perhaps he'll ex
plain why they have ruled out prostitution over
there. It's hurt red-light production, yon know.

And as the mighty cars roar at the Indianap
olis death-trap, the ROTC will participate in a

Memorial Day observance ceremony at Memo
rial Church Wednesday at 11 a.m. They'll he
commemorating the blood spilled in wars, not
on the race track (where the only commemora
tion will be a grind of gears, a roar of exhaust
ami probably a sudden smashup).
Theatre Matinee presentation at 4:15 p.m.
will be "Peaches Yellow," an original TV play.
At 8:15 the Stanford Players will stage "Love's
Labour's Lost" once again, Wednesday through
Saturday.

Thursday's film series will feature "The Mag
nificent Ambersons," directed by Orson Welles
and starring Joseph Cot ten and Anne Baxter.
Tickets are no longer available, sadly enough.
Discussion topics Thursday include "Coun
ter-Examples to the Poineare Inequality" at a
2:15 Mathematics Colloquium, "Absolute Dif
ferential Cross-Section for Electrons and Pro
tons" at a 4 p.m. Physics Journal Club meeting,
and "Investigations on the Structure of Virus
es*' at a 4:15 biology and chemistry seminar.
A motley combination.
* * *
All Spanish students can try out their vocab
ulary knowledge at Friday night's production
in Cubberley Auditorium on "Madrugada,"
which will be done completely in Spanish. Si, si,
ja vol, merci.
Dead week descends on campus Friday, but
it gets in a very lively mood Sunday night when
the Stanford Symphonic Hand and Brass Choir
clash cymbals at H:l5 p.m. in Memorial Audi
torium. A large audience of music lovers and
pet)pie - who-thnught-there-was-a-Sunday-flick
tonight is expected.
* # #
And there you are. We pull in our heads
under our shells and retire to contemplate and
meditate until next September. In parting
comes this message of comfort to Stern dining
hall customers:
Although goldfish prefer live food, such as
flies, earthworms and mosquito larvae, they
also will eat scrambled egg, chopped lettuce,
boiled spinach and even ground dog biscuit.
