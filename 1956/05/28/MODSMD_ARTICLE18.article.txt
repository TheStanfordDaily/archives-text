# Resident Assistant Program Studied By Cap and Gown
## 
### 
The resident assistant program
in women's living groups has
been the subject of a study made
over the past quarter by Cap and
Gown, women's honorary society.
The study was initiated as the
result of a survey made last win
ter quarter by the group. The sur
vey showed wide discrepancies in
opinion concerning the role of the
RA in women's residences.
Jo Davis, Cap and Gown mem
ber, said "the women had an en
tirely different' idea of the RA's
than the RA's themselves
had."
As a result of the study, Cap
and Gown members began a pro
gram of education this quarter.
They defined and clarified the
role of the RA to freshman wom
en in Branner and Rbble house
meetings last week.
The freshmen, who will be liv
ing under the system next yÂ§ar
for the first time in upper class
dormitories, heard the differences
between the position of the spon
sor and the RA. The RA is a grad
uate student who is usually new
to the University. They are se
lected from many different
schools to bring in new ideas.
It was pointed out that they are
paid staff members in charge of
the residence, and concerned with
technical, academic and social
problems, but that they are not
disciplinarians.
Their role, in general, is that of
a liaison between students and
the director.
