# Traffic Com Presents New Parking Plan; On-Campus Students Will Walk to Class
## 
### 
Master campus parking plan
for 5000 automobiles, with the de
cision that on - campus students
"walk to classes," has been work
ed out by the all-University Traf
fic and Parking Committee.
The parking plan provides for
a four-point program to be put
into effect at the beginning of au
tumn quarter. ,
The committee, headed by Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler,
said three classes of windshield
stickers will be issued at the start
of each autumn quarter. These
three classes, along with visitor
parking, make up the four-point
program, which is:
• Senior faculty and staff mem
bers. Spaces to be marked in blue.
• Off-campus students and oth
er faculty and staff members.
Curbs to be painted yellow.
• On-enmpus students. Not
marked.
• Visitor and time-limit park
ing. Curbs to be painted green.
"The committee has attempted
to reserve sufficient space in con
venient lots and along curbs to

provide one parking space for
each driver in the categories,"
Winbigler said.
Except for an "emergency"
space next to the chemistry build
ing, the parking spots for on
campus students are in the imme
diate vicinity of the living groups.
"This arrangement involves a
fundamental committee decision,"
Winbigler said. "We decided it is
not possible to provide on-campus
residents with two or more park
ing spaces—that is, one by their
residences and another in various
close-in places around the Quad.
"The plan supposes that nearly
all on-campus students will walk
to classes."
Less Drastic
Winbigler added that the step is
"less drastic than measures taken
at other universities. Banning of
freshman cars is becoming more
frequent, and a few colleges have
banned all student cars."
Therefore, he said, the plan fa
vors the off-campus student. The
off-campus resident must drive to
class and use his car for storing
books and other materials which
an on-campus student would nor
mally keep in his room.
The chemistry building lot will
be reserved for on-campus drivers
who are coming from distant
points on the campus or who ex
pect to drive off campus after
class without returning to their
living groups.
Unrestricted
An unrestricted 250-car lot
along Campus Drive across from
Moore Hall will be available for
on-campus parking, as will spaces
near Encina, behind Memorial Au
ditorium and along lower Galvez.
An estimated 900 spaces will be
needed for off - campus drivers.
The lots reserved for them are
the Women's Gymnasium -Health
Service lot for 100 cars, the lower
part of the Stern-triangle lot for
175 cars, and 150 spaces in the Li
brary lot. The remaining stalls
are provided along curbs over the
campus.
Time-limit zones to accommo
date visitors are to be established
along the curbs in front of Wil
bur, Branner, Stern and across
the street from Stern.

No changes are contemplated at
Roble, Lagunita, wo m en's row
houses or fraternities. Drivers
will be required to obtain stickers
to park there, though.
The two lots reserved for-fac
ulty—behind Cubberley and near
Geology Corner—will continue to
bo used for this purpose.
Half of Ihe visitors' parking in
front of the Hoover Library is to
be converted to a 30-minute zone
for general use. Visitor and time
limit parking along the front of
Quad arc to be maintained as at
present
Elimination of parking on the
block of Alvadaro Row w hi c h
runs along the triangle lot and on
Escondido in front of the dormi
tories is being considered. Time
limit parking will remain in these
areas.
Stickers are to be issued to resi
dents of dormitories which will
bear markings making it possible
to associate cars with living units.
Areas to be reserved for the
dorms, based on car ownership,
are:
• Wilbur: lots between the hall
and Campus Drive.
• Branner: a new lot to be con
structed at the southeast corner
of the hall at the time the front
of the hall is landscaped.
• Stern: the new lot adjacent
to the Stern addition, the upper
part of the triangle lot and curb
spaces along both sides of Galvez.
• Ciothers: curb space along
both sides of Galvez and 50 spaces
in the Library lot.
• Crothers Memorial: the cor
ner lot next to Toyon.
• Toyon and Eating Clubs: the
eating club lot and the area to
the rear of Toyon.

Master campus parking plan
for 5000 automobiles, with the de
cision that on - campus students
"walk to classes," has been work
ed out by the all-University Traf
fic and Parking Committee.
The parking plan provides for
a four-point program to be put
into effect at the beginning of au
tumn quarter. ,
The committee, headed by Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler,
said three classes of windshield
stickers will be issued at the start
of each autumn quarter. These
three classes, along with visitor
parking, make up the four-point
program, which is:
• Senior faculty and staff mem
bers. Spaces to be marked in blue.
• Off-campus students and oth
er faculty and staff members.
Curbs to be painted yellow.
• On-enmpus students. Not
marked.
• Visitor and time-limit park
ing. Curbs to be painted green.
"The committee has attempted
to reserve sufficient space in con
venient lots and along curbs to

provide one parking space for
each driver in the categories,"
Winbigler said.
Except for an "emergency"
space next to the chemistry build
ing, the parking spots for on
campus students are in the imme
diate vicinity of the living groups.
"This arrangement involves a
fundamental committee decision,"
Winbigler said. "We decided it is
not possible to provide on-campus
residents with two or more park
ing spaces—that is, one by their
residences and another in various
close-in places around the Quad.
"The plan supposes that nearly
all on-campus students will walk
to classes."
Less Drastic
Winbigler added that the step is
"less drastic than measures taken
at other universities. Banning of
freshman cars is becoming more
frequent, and a few colleges have
banned all student cars."
Therefore, he said, the plan fa
vors the off-campus student. The
off-campus resident must drive to
class and use his car for storing
books and other materials which
an on-campus student would nor
mally keep in his room.
The chemistry building lot will
be reserved for on-campus drivers
who are coming from distant
points on the campus or who ex
pect to drive off campus after
class without returning to their
living groups.
Unrestricted
An unrestricted 250-car lot
along Campus Drive across from
Moore Hall will be available for
on-campus parking, as will spaces
near Encina, behind Memorial Au
ditorium and along lower Galvez.
An estimated 900 spaces will be
needed for off - campus drivers.
The lots reserved for them are
the Women's Gymnasium -Health
Service lot for 100 cars, the lower
part of the Stern-triangle lot for
175 cars, and 150 spaces in the Li
brary lot. The remaining stalls
are provided along curbs over the
campus.
Time-limit zones to accommo
date visitors are to be established
along the curbs in front of Wil
bur, Branner, Stern and across
the street from Stern.

No changes are contemplated at
Roble, Lagunita, wo m en's row
houses or fraternities. Drivers
will be required to obtain stickers
to park there, though.
The two lots reserved for-fac
ulty—behind Cubberley and near
Geology Corner—will continue to
bo used for this purpose.

front of the Hoover Library is to
be converted to a 30-minute zone

Master campus parking plan
for 5000 automobiles, with the de
cision that on - campus students
"walk to classes," has been work
ed out by the all-University Traf
fic and Parking Committee.
The parking plan provides for
a four-point program to be put
into effect at the beginning of au
tumn quarter. ,
The committee, headed by Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler,
said three classes of windshield
stickers will be issued at the start
of each autumn quarter. These
three classes, along with visitor
parking, make up the four-point
program, which is:
• Senior faculty and staff mem
bers. Spaces to be marked in blue.
• Off-campus students and oth
er faculty and staff members.
Curbs to be painted yellow.
• On-enmpus students. Not
marked.
• Visitor and time-limit park
ing. Curbs to be painted green.
"The committee has attempted
to reserve sufficient space in con
venient lots and along curbs to

provide one parking space for
each driver in the categories,"
Winbigler said.
Except for an "emergency"
space next to the chemistry build
ing, the parking spots for on
campus students are in the imme
diate vicinity of the living groups.
"This arrangement involves a
fundamental committee decision,"
Winbigler said. "We decided it is
not possible to provide on-campus
residents with two or more park
ing spaces—that is, one by their
residences and another in various
close-in places around the Quad.
"The plan supposes that nearly
all on-campus students will walk
to classes."
Less Drastic
Winbigler added that the step is
"less drastic than measures taken
at other universities. Banning of
freshman cars is becoming more
frequent, and a few colleges have
banned all student cars."
Therefore, he said, the plan fa
vors the off-campus student. The
off-campus resident must drive to
class and use his car for storing
books and other materials which
an on-campus student would nor
mally keep in his room.
The chemistry building lot will
be reserved for on-campus drivers
who are coming from distant
points on the campus or who ex
pect to drive off campus after
class without returning to their
living groups.
