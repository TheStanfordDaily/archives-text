## Figueroa, Holding, Evans, Holzman, Shaw, Stewart Join Ace Hurler on All-League Nine 
### 
Stanford hurler Ray Young has
become the first baseball player
in California intercollegiate base
ball history to win the most-valu
able-player award two out of three
years.
CIBA coaches again awarded
Young the MVP prize, having ac
corded the senior pitcher the same
honor in 1954.
He was also named a unani
mous choice on the all-league
team for the third straight year,
according to an anouncement re
leased yesterday.
Stanford and league-winner
Southern California each placed
seven stars on the first and sec
ond teams. USC landed five on
the first and two on the second,
while the Indians garnered three
first-string spots and four second- .
team posts.
First Team
Catcher Ralph Holding and all
around utility man Rudy Figue
roa made the first team.

76% innings.
Belying the old axiom that
pitchers can't hit, Young compiled
a career batting average of .302
and drove in 26 runs.
Four Stanford aces were named
to the second team. Two of them,
Bob Evans and Mickey Holzman,
will graduate next month, while
the other pair, A 1 Shaw and Steve
Stewart, will return next year.
Hanks Fourth
Outfielder Evans ranked fourth
among CIBA batsmen with a po
tent .352. Six spots down the hat
ting averages at 10th was Holz
man. The senior utility man

loop.

Other unanimous choices beside
Young were Southern California's
first - baseman Kent Hadley and
outfielder Tony Santino, Santa
Clara's outfielder John Ruso and
UCLA's third-baseman Jim Deck
er.
Ruso edged out Santino for the
league batting crown by slam
ming out a blistering .475 to the
USC ace's .429.

pitchers can't hit, Young compiled
a career batting average of .302
and drove in 26 runs.
Four Stanford aces were named
to the second team. Two of them,
Bob Evans and Mickey Holzman,
will graduate next month, while
the other pair, A 1 Shaw and Steve
Stewart, will return next year.
Hanks Fourth

among CIBA batsmen with a po

loop.

first - baseman Kent Hadley and
outfielder Tony Santino, Santa
Clara's outfielder John Ruso and
UCLA's third-baseman Jim Deck
er.
Ruso edged out Santino for the
league batting crown by slam
ming out a blistering .475 to the
