# Traffic Plan Encourages Use Of Peripheral Road in Fall
## 
### 
Campus drivers will be encouraged to use Campus Drive, the
peripheral road, under the latest traffic plan submitted by the all-
University traffic and parking committee.
Drivers who are accustomed to using Galvez Street to connect
with the back areas of the campus will be headed toward Campus
Drive beginning autumn quarter, according to Committee Chairman
H. Donald Winbigler.
Later, it is planned to close off Galvez at the north side of Escon
dido in order to make the area a pedestrian walk so dormitory resi
dents can walk the entire length of Escondido to the Quad without
crossing any major lanes of traffic. *
Galvez will not be closed off until Campus Drive is completed in
front of Moore Hall.
"Cars headed for the triangle lot by Stern or the lot behind Cub
berley will be expected to use Escondido Road," Winbigler said.
Campus Drive, utilizing two blocks of the former Arguello Street,
now stops in front of the Russell House. The house will be razed
to the ground this summer and Campus Drive extended to the front
of Moore Hall and then to Lomita Drive.
Lomita, which runs along the Geology and Physics side of Quad,
will become the temporary western edge of the peripheral road.
Within five years the four-lane peripheral road is to encircle Lake
Lagunita, Roble and Lagunita halls and the proposed science build
ings to rejoin Palm Drive below the Museum.
Lasuen from Campus Drive to Engineering Corner will be closed
to autos after the traffic pattern around the Post Office and Union
are worked out.
Improved directional signs are among other minor traffic pro
posals made by the committee.
