â€”The Democrats challenged Pres
ident Eisenhower to a public de
bate with their presidential can

rejected "as far as I am con

Hall and Butler appeared for
the program armed with small TV
"reminder cards" listing general
areas of discussion. But they tore
them up when they launched into
a row over who was responsible
for unfair campaign tactics.
Butler said the 19. r >6 election
campaign would be "clean" pro

Nixon and other GOP candidates
"don't run around the country
calling the other party the 'party
of treason.' "
