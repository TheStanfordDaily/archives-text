# Art Hendrickson Wins Queen of Con Home, Flex Zinck His King
## Alpha Delt Dog Takes Second In Close Race Record Contributions From Contest, Brunch Make Drive Success 
### 
Flex Zinch was elected Con
Home King and A. M. "Art" Hen
drickson was elected Queen in a
close last-minute race Friday.
Exact figures on the number of
votes cast were not available but
Sam, the Alpha Delt boxer, is re
ported to have come in second in
the King contest.
The goal of the contest was $500
but an approximate count revealed
that more than $630 was collected.
The Strawberry Brunch also set
a record of sorts. It collected
about $500, $100 more than last
year. Mrs. Dorothy Tibby, Wom
en's Clubhouse Hostess, said this
amount was the largest collected
by the Brunch since World War
11.
Solicitations
Combined solicitations amount
ed to over $4100, $3100 from the
freshmen off-campus drive. The
junior class has announced it will
provide liquid refreshment to the
dormitory or house donating the
largest sum.
Unofficial estimates show Sig
ma Chi is leading in the solicita
tions. They donated $147, most of
which was collected through the
efforts of the Sigma Chi Travel
ers, a vocal and instrumental trio.
The Travelers went to local res
taurants and literally "sang for
their supper" with the proceeds
going to the Con Home.
Proceeds
There were no final estimates
available for the proceeds of the
Carnival. The trophy awarded an
nually for the most original booth
went this year to Ventura for their
"Douse the Dolly" booth, in which
wet sponges were thrown at Ven
tura girls.
The trophy usually given to the
booth making the most money has
not yet been awarded pending
final estimates.
Co-chairmen for the drive were
Marilyn Marshek and Dave Jenks.
