ALGIERS, Algeria, May 27 (UP)
â€” More than 7000 French para
troopers and police invaded the
teeming Casbah of Algiers today,
seizing large quantities of arms
and rounding up more than 2000
persons suspected of rebel activi
ties.
Six thousand troops, armed with
tommy-guns, and 1500 police con
ducted the daylong house-to-house
search through the narrow, twist
ing streets of the storied native
quarter. It was the biggest such
operation in the history of Algiers.
The invading forces threw a
cordon around the Casbah at
dawn, blocking all exits and en
trances. They then moved in for
the search that uncovered secret
arsenals, rebel army uniforms and
insignia and propaganda pam
phlets.
