# Ike Approves Farm Bill—- 'Second Plan'
## Presidential Go-Ahead Given Despite Certain 'Shortcomings' in Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 28 (UP) —
President Eisenhower signed the
"second chance" Farm Bill today,
but said he was disappointed it
does not authorize his controver
sial soil bank prepayment plan.
Eisenhower said in a statement
that the advantages of the bill out
weigh its harmful provisions, how
ever. He said he signed it despite
these "shortcomings."
"I am gratified wtih the con
structive features it contains, and
1 am hopeful that the Congress
will review and repair its short
comings," the Chief Executive
added.
Among other things the meas
ure authorizes the President's $1.2
billion soil bank, provides for a
mandatory increase in feed grain
price supports and authorizes a
discretionary two-price plan on
rice.
In Record Time
The President's approval of the
bill came just 43 days after he ve
toed the original Farm Bill be
cause of its rigid high price sup
port features. The new bill was
rushed through Congress in rec
ord time.
The President's action capped a
four-month election-year battle be
tween the White House and the
Democratic Congress over farm
legislation.
The final bill would authorize
soil bank payments this year to
farmers who take land out of pro
duction of surplus crops during
the current growing season.
Prepayment Refused
Congress refused to grant the
President's request for authority
to make soil bank payments to
farmers this year for promising to
take land out of production next
year.
Democrats denounced this plan
as a political gimmick to win farm
votes. Republicans contended it
was necessary to give hard-pressed
farmers some ready cash now.
Eisenhower obviously was
pleased about the soil bank itself
as he signed the bill in the pres
ence of Sherman Adams, his top
White House assistant, and Gerald
Morgan, his Chief Counsel.
Praises Soil Bank
He said the measure basically
is "rich with promise for improv
ing our agricultural situation."
The soil bank, he added, "will
make for better land use in those
areas of the Great Plains which
have experienced dust storms."
But Eisenhower said the long
Congressional farm fight "makes
it virtually impossible to put the
soil bank properly into effect in
1956. and I am disappointed that
advance payments to farmers are
not provided for."
He noted that, "most of the
harmful provisions" of the origi
nal Democratic farm bill were
either deleted or changed. But he
said that some still remain and
"some new ones have been added."
