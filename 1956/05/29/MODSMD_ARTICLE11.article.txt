# UCLA 'Sleuths' Maintain They Have 'The Goods' on Stanford
## Varsity Theatre to Initiate Price Reductions Tomorrow Stanford Students Will Be Given New 80-Cent Rate at Palo Alto Movie House, Manager Says 
### 
Beginning tomorrow Stanford students will be admitted to Palo
Alto's Varsity Theatre for 80 cents upon presentation of their student
body cards.
Dorothy Jessen, Varsity manager, announced the plan late yester
day afternon, saying, "If we're going to give the Stanford students

a break, we're going to give them
oneâ€”and right now."
Two weeks ago the Stanford
Theatre okayed plans to issue dis
count cards to Stanford students
which would give about a 23 per
cent admission cut to the bearers.
They would cost $1 with half the
purchase price going directly to
the theater and the other half re
tained by the ASSU, the selling
agent.
LASSU Approval
Last week Legislature approved
the plan "in principle," with de
tails to be worked out by the sum
mer student legislators. It is ex
pected to go into effect beginning
autumn quarter.
Other theaters have followed
the Stanford's load. They include
Fox (Redwood City), Park (Menlo
Park), Fox (San Francisco), Car
los (San Carlos), San Mateo (San
Mateo) and the Peninsula (Burlin
game).
At the time that the Stanford's
plan was announced Miss .lessen
said the Varsity "couldn't pos
sibly" subscribe to such a plan,
because the theater's policies were
governed by the United California
Theatres, a chain which wouldn't
allow student discounts.
Column Prompts Plan
However, Miss .lessen sent of
ficers of ihe governing chain a
copy of The Daily's "What Do
YOU Think?" column which or ig
inally prompted the S t a n 112 or d
Theatre discount plan.
The officers felt that the Stan
ford should have some sort of a
discount plan "and right now,"
to quote Miss .lessen.
Everyone Privileged
They felt that the $1 discount
card plan wasn't "enough of a
break for the students." The of
ficials have expressed more con
fidence in their plan, noting that
use of a special card in the other
plan would "segregate a minority
of students who would buy such a
card . . . under our plan everyone
is privileged."
Miss .lessen said the Varsity
plan would remain in effect until
at least autumn quarter when pos
sibly another plan can be worked
out. But she noted thai if students
abused the discount privilege with
unnecessary noise in the theater it
would be withdrawn.
