KATMANDU, Nepal, May 28
(UP)â€”Swiss mountaineers con
quered the world's highest un
climbed mountain and matched
the British conquest of Everest
twice within one week, the Swiss
legation here disclosed today.
Tackling the Himalayas for the
first time, the five Alpine vet
erans won out over a raging
storm and an attack of appendi
citis.
The Swiss scaled the previously
unreached peak of Lhotse I,
fourth highest mountain 'in the
world at 27,890 feet, on May 18.
But this record-setting feat was
overshadowed by their double vic
tory over Everest last Wednesday
and Thursday.
A victory message from the
Swiss climbers said aircraft tech
nician Adolf Reist and Alpine in
structor - Fritz Luchsinger master
ed Lhotse, and then the entire
party tackled Everest.
Chemist Ernest Schmied and
Juerg Marmet reached the top
May 23. The following day Reist
and Dr. Hans-Ruedi von Gunten,
a chemist, made the summit.
For 31-year-old mountaineer
Luchsinger, the trail-blazing climb
up Lhotse was a personal triumph
over illness.
On the way up the lower slopes
he suffered an attack of appendi
citis.
Runners carried a plea for help
back to Katmandu. Switzerland
launched a round-the-world air
lift to bring him medicine by air
line to India, by Air Force plane
to the Himalayas and by para
chute to the base camp.
But Luchsinger responded to
treatment on the spot and was*
well enough to conquer Lhotse.
