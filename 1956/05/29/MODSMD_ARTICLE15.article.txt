# Claim Could Place USC, Cal Under PCC Rose Bowl Ban
## 
### 
Charging that they "have the goods, but not the signed proof" on
Stanford, a group of UCLA "sleuths" rocked the Pacific Coast last
night with charges the United Press says would place USC and the
University of California under the Rose Bowl ban.
An unamed spokesman for the group said, "We've got it all down

in black and white on Southern
California and we have the dope
just about ready on California.
"1 would say we have it on Stan
ford, too, except we can't get it
signed. The man who gave us the
dope on Stanford says that Dr.
Wallace Sterling, University pres
ident, has warned that he'll fire
every man on the Stanford ath
letic staff if anything is ever
found wrong with the recruiting
and pay to athletes there. And
this fellow doesn't want to see
football coach Chuck Taylor get
the axe."
"That's a Laugh"
A 1 Masters, Stanford Athletic
Director, chortled, "That's a
laugh," when he was informed of
the statements.
"You are apt to find occasional
under-the-table payments to an in
dividual, but we don't know of
any."
Earlier this week the director
said: "If they have anything us,
let them speak up. We're ready
,o take our medicine if we have
done anything wrong. . . . I'll give
them a battle if they come up
with just phony rumors about
us."
Masters' statement that "I per
sonally feel we are in the clear
and they know it" seemed to best
sum up official University feel
ings.
No Name
The spokesman for the
"sleuths" refused to reveal his
name to the public, but definitely
said his group, working on behalf
of UCLA, has "all the facts neces
sary" to ban Cal and USC from
the Rose Bowl.
He said the group was also in
vestigating the situation at Ore
gon, Oregon State and Washing
ton State.
"However," he said, "I don't
think we'll ever get anything on
Idaho . . . can you imagine? They
spent money |and were fined] for
recruiting men for their boxing
team."
At the University of California,
President Robert. Gordon Sproul
said that athletes suspected of re
ceiving under-the-table payments
at UCLA would not be forced to
prove their innocence.
Considers Report
He met with leaders of both
UC and UCLA over the weekend
to "consider the report of action
taken by the Pacific Coast Con
ference at . . . Victoria, B. C."
The PCC had indicated that all
of UCLA's football players who
had accepted payments exceeding
the $75 a month allowed would
lose a year's eligibility, and that
they would be judged guilty un
less they could prove their inno
cence.
"The action of the conference
does not lay upon the individual
athlete the responsibility of prov
ing that he has not accepted un
authorized payments. . . . Clear
ance by his institution will per
mit him to compete," Sproul com
mented.
Football Only
He said the ineligibility applied
only to football.
Sproul is expected to release his
findings on the UCLA case in the
next day or two. Rumor is that
the president may fire all con
nected with the Bruin scandal.
(If head football coach Red
Sanders were fired, it would cost
the UCLA student body $150,000
the terms of Sanders' long-term
contract. This would be in addi
tion to the $15,000 ASUCLA was
fined by the PCC earlier this
month for not allowing Confer
ence Commissioner Victor O.
Schmidt to investigate alleged vio
lations at the school.)
For the moment, anyway, Pa
cific Coast Conference officials
apparently had nothing to say
concerning these latest develop
ments in the biggest clean-up
campaign in PCC history.
