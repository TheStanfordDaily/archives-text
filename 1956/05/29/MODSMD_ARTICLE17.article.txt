# Florida Holds Presidential Primary Today
## Adlai, Estes Close Campaigns in Crucial Fight for Nomination 
### 
MIAMI, May 28 (UP)—Estes
Kefauver and Adlai Stevenson
ended their bitter, hard-fought
campaign in Florida today with
each claiming victory and hoping
the results will pave the way to
the Democratic nomination.
Each candidate gave the cam
paign his all-out effort, recogniz
ing that the winner would carry
more prestige into next week's
California primary — their last
head-on clash. Kefauver and Ste
venson also knew that a loss in
one or both states might kill their
chances at the convention in Au
gust.
Their fate in Florida was left
in the hands of about 450,000
Democrats who may go to the
polls in 1779 precincts between 7
a.m. and 7 p.m. (EST) tomorrow.
Secretary of State R. A. Gray es
timated that the contest has not
"stimulated enough interest" to
attract much more than one-third
of the registered Democrats.
Kefauver in Miami
Kefauver spent a final 19-hour
day campaigning in Dade County
(Miami), which will produce al
most one-fourth of the votes to
morrow.
"But I think I'll do well in just
about every section," he said in a
late night television and radio
broadcast. "I've been mighty en
couraged from reports I received
during my tour this week."
Stevenson left Miami during
the morning for California to get
his final week of campaigning
under way there. He said his
chances in Florida "are good."
Gratitude for Welcome
"My heart is full of gratitude
lor the welcome I have received
throughout Florida during this
primary campaign," he said.
Both Kefauver's and Steven
son's names will appear on to
morrow's ballot at the head of a
slate of 40 delegate candidates.
