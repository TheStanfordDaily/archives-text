# The 						Cry-Baby 'Sleuths'
## 
### 
Thf. cry-babifs are HOWLING. Now some UCLA
"sleuths" way they have the "goods" on USC,
Cal and Stanford. Well, at least they are being
true to form —cowardly to the last.
The PCC Code has been violated at schools
other than UCLA—this is obvious. There is no
need for the cowardly retaliation of the UCLA
"sleuths."
These men are backing athletics, they call
themselves "sportsmen." But they do not know
the first thing about that which they are sup
porting. Sportsmanship is the core of athletics.
One has to be a man in every sense of the word
to be a sportsman.
Such cry-baby conduct is a long way from
sportsmanship. Such retaliation is more in
filling with the conduct of untrained infants.
A man worthy of the name couldn't stoop so

low.
No! only is their action cowardly, it is stupid.
Tliev charged Stanford with violations but say
that tliev cannot get the proof because Presi
dent Wallace Sterling would fire football coach
Chuck Taylor. This is an example of one of the
weakest devices of the cry-baby.
They have no "poods" on Stanford, there are
no "goods" to get on Stanford. Any violations
of the PCC (lode that have taken place here —
if any- -have been done without the knowledge
of anyone hut the individuals involved.
The "sleuths" know this.
We challenge them to come out in the open,
to "put up or shut up"—if they dare.
The doors at Stanford arc open. Vl e have
nothing to hide.
(".ome ahead. Or else start crying on the inside.
