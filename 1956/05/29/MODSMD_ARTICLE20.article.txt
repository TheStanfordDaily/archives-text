# On Other Campuses
## Student Government, Free Press Were Top Issues During Past Year 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
Things have been fairly quiet on other cam
puses this year. Only a few, mainly on the West
Coast, have seen major upheavals, usually cen
tering on student-administration relationships.
UCLA's troubles started last December with
fraudulent editorial elections. Sorrows multi
plied when sororities and fraternities withdrew
from student government over racial restric
tions in their constitutions.
In rapid succession, the university adminis
tration sent down a directive changing the
ASIJCLA Constitution, kicked council president
Irv Drasnin out of office and finally took over
student body elections which were later invali
dated.
On the positive side of student-faculty rela
tions, the University of Washington newspaper
was finally able to persuade the Board of Reg
ents to liberalize a 40-year-old ban on political
speakers appearing on campus.

Sports probably provided the next most lively
topic of controversy on other campuses the past
year.
Beginning with the firing of football coach,
John Cherberg, and a fight over this that ended
in the state legislature, the University of Wash
ington has had nothing but trouble with the
gridiron game.
Most recently both it and UCLA have been
banned from the Rose Bowl for some years to
come because of their non-observance of PCC
rules.
I he University of California daily paper has
suggested a widely-debated requirement for non
conference games next year.
Students have proposed that no Cal teams
play colleges which allow segregation on their
campuses. No action has been taken yet, and
violent protest has come from southern schools.

Freedom of the press took a beating but came
out a winner at the University of Texas. There,
the University Board of Regents tried to take
over control of the student paper's editorial
policy and lost in the attempt, after a bitter
battle which attracted nation-wide attention.
Editors of the University of North Carolina
Daily iar Heel also rannnto trouble and were,
threatened with a recall election for expressing
opinions not precisely in line with those of stu
dent officers. Hut they seem to have won their
right to free speech.
Even humor magazines have had their

troubles. The Cal Pelican and the Syracuse
University magazine were both put under Uni
versity censorship because of the content of re
cent publications.
At both colleges Hie main result was an enor
mous increase in sales of the issues involved.

Student body elections on other campuses
have run into exceptional apathy this year, and
some rather ingenious remedies have been
found for the situation.
At the University of Oregon, two new parties
called the Ho-llums and the Do-l\otliings put
up candidates for president, although the for
mer teas too tired to get very far.
Polly Adler brought out a wave of student
voters at the University of California at River
side.
Since this is a presidential election year, many
universities held mock political conventions,
the western one being at USC. And you know
what happened there.
Kansas State nominated Estes Xefauver and
Clare Booth Luce on a non-partisan ticket. Ohio
State, the most recent, saw an interesting upset
in which Senator John Bricker was nominated
for Republican vice-presidential candidate after
a long contest with Richard Nixon.

During the past fetv weeks many campuses
have shown signs of spring fever. The panty
raids at Cal are probably the most notable ex
ample, but Kansas State also saw demonstra
tions and USC's high spirits developed into a
full-scale riot.

Race problems have been ever-present on
other campuses.
I he University of Michigan is debating a re
moval of segregation in campus dormitories,
and, on the other side, students at Texas A&M
have just decided to keep racial restrictions
there as long as they can.
And of course there was the University of
Alabama and Autherine Lucy.

Fraternities haven't made many headlines
this year, except in their withdrawal from
UCLA student government.
I hey did make the nation s front pages once,
though, when a pledge at MIT drowned while
trying to find his way back to campus after be
ing taken on a pledge ride.
I lie incident had repercussions in many other
colleges and quite a few fraternities have given
up hazing practices as a result.
