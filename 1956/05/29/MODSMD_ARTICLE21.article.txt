On Publicity
Editor, The Daily:
Last Sunday at the Stanford Men's Glee Club
Concert in Cubberley Auditorium, a majority of
the audience was made up of older people. The
small attendance was due in part to lack of pub
licity. Other than posters distributed by Glee Club
members, and an article in the Palo Alto Times,
little attention was paid to this organization's con
cert. The Stanford Daily graciously donated one
small article which ran for one day.
It was suggested to the Daily editor that he pub
licize the Glee Club in an editorial. .To this the edi
tor responded with cries that he was not to be
pressured in the selection of his editorial topics.
Personally, we have failed to be impressed with
his previous topics. It is his prerogative to refuse,
certainly, but we fail to see the logic of his indig
nation.
The Daily should have at least devoted more
than just passing attention by giving more pub
licity and showing more interest in an organiza
tion which has worked since October, and per
formed at the Veteran's Hospital, several campus
residences, Spring Sing, five alumni conference
dinners and the Cubberley Auditorium concert.
We feel The Stanford Daily is a reflection of the
much-publicized apathy.

Editor's Note: We are not in operation to serve
t lie interests of those looking for publicity ; our job
is to inform our readers of what we consider to be
significant news. As far as we are concerned the
concert in question received exactly the play and
news space which it merited in consideration with
the other news items which were on hand during
the week of the concert.
We do not "donate" space. We print our news
for the benefit of one group and one group only—
the readers. Those looking for free advertising or
publicity had better find another medium in which
to advertise —that's the purpose of posters.
True, we will not be pressured in our selection of
editorial topics —but it is completely untrue that
we informed any "publicity agent" of this with
"cries of indignation." We explained the facts and
let it go at that.
Our editorials are written for those whose in
terests may lie beyond their own little organiza
tion. The Glee Club is certainly deserving of com
mendation, but so are 100 other hard-working cam
pus groups, most of which are content with par
ticipating in their activity and not worrying over
the "glory" of publicity. And as one of our favo
rite professors is fond of saying, "There are
weightier matters."
As for apathy, The Daily does not make the
news, it prints it. And certainly no one with any
perception could call The Daily itself "apathetic."

members, and an article in the Palo Alto Times,
little attention was paid to this organization's con
cert. The Stanford Daily graciously donated one
small article which ran for one day.
It was suggested to the Daily editor that he pub
licize the Glee Club in an editorial. .To this the edi
tor responded with cries that he was not to be
pressured in the selection of his editorial topics.
Personally, we have failed to be impressed with
his previous topics. It is his prerogative to refuse,
certainly, but we fail to see the logic of his indig
nation.
The Daily should have at least devoted more
than just passing attention by giving more pub
licity and showing more interest in an organiza
tion which has worked since October, and per
formed at the Veteran's Hospital, several campus
residences, Spring Sing, five alumni conference
dinners and the Cubberley Auditorium concert.
We feel The Stanford Daily is a reflection of the
much-publicized apathy.

Editor's Note: We are not in operation to serve
t lie interests of those looking for publicity ; our job
is to inform our readers of what we consider to be
significant news. As far as we are concerned the
concert in question received exactly the play and
news space which it merited in consideration with
the other news items which were on hand during
the week of the concert.
We do not "donate" space. We print our news
for the benefit of one group and one group only—
the readers. Those looking for free advertising or
publicity had better find another medium in which
to advertise —that's the purpose of posters.
True, we will not be pressured in our selection of
editorial topics —but it is completely untrue that
we informed any "publicity agent" of this with
"cries of indignation." We explained the facts and
let it go at that.
Our editorials are written for those whose in
terests may lie beyond their own little organiza
tion. The Glee Club is certainly deserving of com
mendation, but so are 100 other hard-working cam
pus groups, most of which are content with par
ticipating in their activity and not worrying over
the "glory" of publicity. And as one of our favo
rite professors is fond of saying, "There are
weightier matters."
As for apathy, The Daily does not make the
news, it prints it. And certainly no one with any
perception could call The Daily itself "apathetic."

Editor, The Daily:
Last Sunday at the Stanford Men's Glee Club
Concert in Cubberley Auditorium, a majority of
the audience was made up of older people. The
small attendance was due in part to lack of pub
licity. Other than posters distributed by Glee Club
members, and an article in the Palo Alto Times,
little attention was paid to this organization's con
cert. The Stanford Daily graciously donated one
small article which ran for one day.
