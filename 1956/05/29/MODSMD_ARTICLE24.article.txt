# Communist Victory in India Unlikely, Says New Delhian
## 
### Dave Canfield 
The Communists have little
chance of taking over India, in
the opinion of Tula Pareek, a
business school graduate student
from New Delhi.
Pareek this year has been
awarded the Davis B. Gray Me
morial Award, presented each
spring to the second-year business
student best fitted for a purchas
ing career.
"India," pointed out Pareek,
"receives her opinion about Amer
ica on the basis of 25-cent books
and your cowboy movies, which
do not impress me at all."
Propaganda
On the other hand, Russian
propaganda in India is quite ef
fective, he thinks.
"Russian literature is in small
quantity compared to American
in India, but theirs is of better
quality."
But he doubts that the Commu
nists will ever annex India. His
reasons for this belief are:
• Communism clashes with In
dia's philosophy of non-violence.
• The standard of living is im
proving in India.
"Communists achieve their goal
by violent as well as non-violent
methods. The Indian nation, since
the leadership of Mohatma Gan
dhi, has believed in non-violence."
Five-Year Plans
The five-year plans in India
have, Pareek emphasized, improv
ed the lot of the masses and have
warded off Communism's appeal.
"People have faith in Nehru,"
Pareek said.
As an aid in learning about
India, American students should
spend some time studying in that
country.
"Students have a better chance
in a year or so to mix with the
people than tourists do in a few
weeks. You don't learn about a
country in a few days' time."
Pareek, who received the B.S.
degree in 1944 and the LL.B. in
1946 from Delhi University, point
ed out several differences be
tween Indian universities and
Stanford. »
"In India," he said, "there is
only one final exam. There are
preliminary exams during the

year, but they are for the stu
dent's benefit and not for a grade.
"The professor who gives an
exam is from a different univer
sity than the students taking the
exam."
This system, if applied to the
United States, would result in a
professor from Harvard, for exr
ample, giving an exam to Stan
ford students.
Pareek lauded the plan by say
ing, "It eliminates discrimina
tion."
He will conclude his two years'
study at. Stanford on Memorial
Day. After receiving sales train
ing this summer in New York,
the scholar from India will return
to his former post as sales super
intendent for New Delhi's DCM
Chemical Works.
"He will take back to India with
him an improved opinion of the
United States, he said.
Favorable Opinion
Beside being awed by America's
material power, Pareek has ac
quired a more favorable idea of
the American people.
"After coming to this country,"
he enthused, "I have changed my
opinion about Americans in gen
eral. People here are very co
operative."
Probably none of Pareek's ex
periences in America could com
pare in excitement with one he
had several years ago in India.
"I had a chance to shoot a tiger
that was 15 feet from my car,"
reminisced Pareek, smiling. "But
I was not prepared for it —no
gun."
