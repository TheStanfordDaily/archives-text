# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Sam the Sad Boxer Mad at Charlie Brown 
### 
| Editor, The Daily:
! I had originally planned to ad
dress my electorate over a KZSU
nation-wide hookup, but their
; capitalistic sponsors refused to
give up their radio time to me.
So I am turning to The Daily,
which I have always viewed as a
courageous defender of student
self-expression.
Even though the election is all
over, and I have lost, I want to
make it clear that I am not, nor
have I ever been, associated with
the group responsible for the up
rising erroneously called the
"Boxer Rebellion."
I have reason to believe that
the person responsible for this
rumor is my opponent Charlie
Brown, a member of the extrem
ist faction of the Y. R. which was
recently censured, condemned ...
condoned, or something. This
very same person you pictured
with the words "good grief," in
apparent disregard of the fact
that it was I who took second in
, the election, not Brown.
Why was he pictured instead
of me?
I'm not one to complain, but
my story has not been a happy
one. An exchange student from
the Palo Alto Pound, Harvey
Hall nevertheless refused to al
low me to register for classes, so
I have to audit. A few weeks
later the Quad refused to allow
me to be pictured with my living
group. (But, then, Brown didn't
make it, either.)
I still was very devoted to
Stanford students, however, so I
tried to serve their best interests
by chasing Carl the Cop, as he
was escaping with a motorcycle
which had been parked outside
the ASSU Office. For this I got
exiled to the Pound overnight.
And finally, in a community
where democracy is nearly dearf.
The Daily has indeed added in
sult to injury by omitting my
picture. I hope this matter will
be quickly corrected.
