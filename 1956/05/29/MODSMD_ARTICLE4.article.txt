# Medical School Is Recipient Of Commonwealth Fund Grant
## University Must Match Million-Dollar Award With Sufficient Private Donor Collections 
### 
Stanford's Medical School received the largest single gift in its his
tory recently when the Commonwealth Fund of New York announced
it was awarding the school a $1,000,000 grant.
In order to receive the money the University is obligated to match
the $1,000,000 with an equal amount collected from private donors.

Deadline for matching the grant
is Sept. 30, 1957. However, the
medical school may draw its grant
in $25,000 portions as similar
amounts are raised.
"The awards may be used in
whatever way the schools consid
er most effective to improve Iheir
programs of medical education,"
fund officials said.
The Stanford grant was part of
a $4,850,000 award to a number
of medical schools.
Fund officials designated Stan
ford a recipient of the grant par
tially because of the projected
move of the medical school from
San Francisco to the campus.
University officials do not as
yet have any "specific" plans for
raising the necessary matching
funds or for spending the money.
According to Associate General
Secretary Lyle Cook, the Univer
sity staff is "doing background
work, studying the means of de
veloping a program to raise the
matching million dollars and the
best use of the money."
The Commonwealth Fund was
established in 1918 by Mrs. Ste
p hen Harkness.
