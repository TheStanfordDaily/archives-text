# Pro-Western Parties Score Victory in Italian Election
## Communists Drop Nearly Million Votes, Center Coalition Loses Control of Some Major Cities 
### 
ROME, May 29 (UP)—ltaly's pro-Western center parties scored
a major victory over the Communists today in the first test of the
Kremlin's "smile offensive" at the ballot boxes of a Western nation.
Nearly complete returns from the elections that ended yesterday
showed the Communists had dropped about a million votes—2o per

cent- compared to the last local
election in 1951. The government
Christian Democrats and their
ccnter allies registered solid
gains.
But the pro-Western center coa
lition lost its full control of Rome
and a number of other key cities,
creating a deadlock that gave Fas
cists and Monarchists a City Hall
balance of power.
Premier Antonio Segni's Chris
tian Democrats turned back an
all-out Communist bid to capture
the city administration in Rome
and other big centers.
But the race in Rome, Tviilan,
Venice and Genoa ended in such
a deadlock that the center parties
failed to win the absolute majori
ty needed to control city councils.
As a result the balance of power
passed to the extreme right par
ties.
The resulting deadlock could
lead to administrative chaos at a
time when the center parties had
hoped to institute long-range re
forms and public development
plans.
The Communists retained their
hold on industrial Bologna and
Leghorn (Livorno), site of a big
U. S. Army supply base that had
pumped $1 million a month into
the seaport city's economy.
But the center won a majority
in Verona, which a week ago re
placed Leghorn as headquarters
of U. S. troops in Italy. The Com
munists waged a camp a i g n
against the American "invasion."
In the over-.all popular vote
standings, the Christian Demo
crats and their center allies led
the Communist-leftwing Socialist
bloc by a margin of three to two.
Nearly complete returns gave
the center coalition of Christian
Democrats, Social Democrats. Lib
erals ;uid Republicans 10.111,536
votes; the Communist bloc 6,742,-
209; and the extreme right Fas
cists and Monarchists 2,500,707.

The Communists retained their
hold on industrial Bologna and
Leghorn (Livorno), site of a big
U. S. Army supply base that had
pumped $1 million a month into
the seaport city's economy.
But the center won a majority
in Verona, which a week ago re
placed Leghorn as headquarters
of U. S. troops in Italy. The Com
munists waged a camp a i g n
against the American "invasion."
In the over-.all popular vote
standings, the Christian Demo
crats and their center allies led
the Communist-leftwing Socialist
bloc by a margin of three to two.
Nearly complete returns gave
the center coalition of Christian
Democrats, Social Democrats. Lib
erals ;uid Republicans 10.111,536
votes; the Communist bloc 6,742,-
209; and the extreme right Fas
cists and Monarchists 2,500,707.
