# Stevenson Defeats Kefauver In Key Florida Democratic Primary by Narrow Margin
## Stevenson Nabs 22 of 28 Delegates, Leads by Narrow 3000-Vote Margin 
### 
MIAMI, May 29 (UP) Adlai Stevenson squeezed by Sen. Estos
Kefauver by a slim margin tonight in a dramatic Florida popularity
contest, apparently taking 22 of the state's 28 Democratic National
Convention votes.
Returns'from 1."596 of the state's 1779 precincts at 11:30 p.m. EST

gave Stevenson 200,025 votes and
Kefauver 196,831.
It was the first time since 9:15
p.m. that either man had been able
to go more than 1000 votes ahead
in a see-saw contest that reflected
the bitterness of the last few days
of the campaign.
Stevenson was thus leading in
the balloting for the 2'l at-large
delegates with half a convention
vote each. lie also had clinched
four delegates with a full vote
each in two Congressional dis
tricts and was leading in three
other districts with two votes
each.
Late Count
Kefauver at a late count was
leading in three districts with two
votes each giving him potentially
six of the 28 votes for the Conven
tion while Stevenson was on his
way to taking 22.
Stevenson held the early lead
but Kefauver passed him at 9:15
p.m. EST. Then Dade County's
(Miami) complete count gave
Stevenson a spurt to the front but
Kefauver's supporters were
matching the expected winner al
most vote for vote as the count
proceeded.
Convention Votes
At stake were 12 Convention
votes from the State at large for
the overall winner and two votes
going to the winner of each of the
State's eight congressional dis
tricts. Stevenson appeared to have
clinched four of the district votqs,
including two from the first dis
trict which includes Tampa and St.
Petersburg.
The Northwest Florida votes
that were helping Stevenson came
from the "hog and hominy" belt
where segregation is a crucial is
sue and Rep. Robert Sikes (D-
Fla.), Stevenson's manager for
Florida, has his constituency.
President Eisenhower, mean
while, won easily in the Republi
can primary where he received
only token opposition from Cali
fornia Sen. William F. Knowland,
who had entered the race before
the President announced his sec
ond term intentions.
