# Steiner Warns Of Japan Swing To Militarism
## 
### 
"The pendulum is swinging
back," said Dr. Kurt Steiner last
night in speaking on "Japan -Oc
cupation and After" before an
audience in Bowman Alumni
House. He said there is a marked
tendency for those in power be
fore the occupation to be coming
back.
Dr. Steiner, who served in Japan
from 1945 to 1951 as a U.S. army
officer and was a prosecutor in the
Japanese war crime trials, divided
the U.S. occupation of Japan into
two phases.
During the first, he said, empha
sis was on demilitarization and
democratization. Later the United
States became more interested in
creating an ally for the power
struggle and the question of arma
ment became important.
The constitution created during
the occupation outlaws rearma
ment. "The objection to rearma
ment ties in with the hope for de
mocracy," Dr. Steiner said. There
is a movement in Japan backed by
the conservatives to revise the
constitution.
These revisionists want fo turn
the clock back and stress the in
herent right of the emperor to |
rule. ' Opponents feel," Dr. Steiner i
continuen, "that people are just
getting used to the idea of having
rights."
