# Which Alternative?

Today is Memorial Day. This is the day when
we honor our war dead; those who have died
in the most wasted of all causes.
But what have we learned from this needless
slaughter? Two things:
• War is hell.
• No one wins in any war.
Have we learned to apply these lessons?
No. The armament races continue—now with
atomic and hydrogen power. These two latest
developments in the weapons of war are a con
tinuance of the century-to-century growth of
warfare.
Once wars were fought on a limited scale,
willi only a comparatively small group of pro
fessional militarists waging the battles and suf
fering the casualties.
I hese wars left no wisdom in their wake, for
soon the art of warfare became something that
involved whole populations. Millions of men
were slaughtered to prove that one nation was
"■belter" than another.
liul, victor or vanquished, both sides lost,
l itis they realized, but, despite the realization,
I lie nationalistic cries continued. The seeming

stupidity of tin* human rare was shown in all
of its glory.
Ami now, in 1956, as we look ba<*k upon cen
turies of warfare we can see that stupidity
clearly. But can we «lo anything about assur
ing future generations thai our lessons will he
learned; that we at last have enough sense to
acknowledge that the only race in the world is
the human race, a race which cannot continue
to he divided against itself if it is to remain
in existence?
We can if we will. Vi e can if those groups
who are most in evidence on this commemora
tion of Memorial Day will stop their concen
tration on flexing America's military muscles
and cease their derogatory cries at the United
Nations and its affiliates, who are taking the
human race on its first real steps along the road
to peace.
The only alternative to a working United
Nations is war. The human race has faced such
alternatives before—and has chosen war; vv;ir
which led to the needless massacre of the mil
lions of men whom we honor today.
The choice is ours. Which alternative d«» we
choose?
