### HELEN DEWAR 
Three months have passed since the ticker
tape's been swept up from the littered conven
tion floors, since the smoke's cleared out from
the crowded back rooms and since hundreds of
tired hut happy delegates have left Chicago
and San Francisco for their homes across the
country.
Il's Nov. 6. 1056, and the rotor enters the
election booth, /muses a few moments beforn
marking his bold "A * beside the name of the
man he would see as the next I*resident of the
United States.
What issues has this voter decided? What
influenced his decision? Was it the sense of
prosperity and security, the appealing person
ality of the candidate, a traditional party affili
ation—or was it a feeling that the'country need
ed more dynamic leadership, that the past four
years had seen an administration making no
disastrous mistakes, but constantly avoiding the
essence of a problem and glossing it over with
transient palliatives?
If he was influenced by the latter rather neb
idolis feeling, he will harbor no great aversion
for the candidate he was voting against. In fact,
he probably feels a great sense of warmth
toward this kindly, personable rutin —the very
picture of the story-book American.
As President, this candidate was spared de
famatory criticism to an almost unrivaled de
gree. Failures of his underlings, especially in
the fields of foreign affairs, agriculture and
national defense, have not been identified with
him personally, but rather the man Eisenhower
has been more a moral force, more an image
of what every American would like to be than
a forceful, daring executive of the type that
have been called upon to lead the country
through economic disaster or international
chaos.
Moderation—a philosophy of the middle of
the road—has become the political watchword.
Stepping neither too far to one side nor the
other has created a careful, passive gowrnmont,
frustrating our allies who are confused by the
dissimilarity of our words and actions, and sat
isfying those at home who hare no pressing
demands to make on the government.
Hut is this weird conglomeration of New Deal
social philosophy, big business interests and
\\ ilsonian utopiauism, tempered by a military
man's caution, sufficient to lead the nation for
another four years when it is possible that the
booming economy may fizzle, ihe Middle Fast
burst into flames or the Russian tactics take a
turn for the worse?
Adding to this a recalcitrant ( on gross heav
ily influenced by reactionaries from both po
litical benches, one wonders if the I'resident's
philosophy of passive and indirect leadership
could escape crucial defeat.
I hough 1956 often looks issueless, there are
serious issues in agriculture, civil rights and
civil liberties, public power and foreign policy.
I pon the Democratic candidate will devolve
the responsibility for clarifying to tin* voter
the real issues and of piercing holes in the po
litical illusion that has characterized the na
tional scene for the past four years.
