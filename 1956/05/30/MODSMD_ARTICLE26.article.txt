# Student-Faculty Committee Has Long Record of Achievement
## Croup Established Only Two Years; Sponsors Lunch Plan, Works for Departmental Clubs 
### 
Student-Faculty Committee has had a relatively short life as ASSU
committees go, but it has a long record of achievement in the two short
years since it was created by Legislature.
The need for closer relations between students and faculty had long
been realized and the Student-Faculty Committee, working with the

Legislature and the Cabinet, has
initiated several programs design
ed to bring about more informal
contacts.
One of their most successful
projects this year was the stu
dent-faculty lunch plan, in which
faculty members regularly eat
lunch in a University residence.
The cost of these lunches is paid
by a fund administered by the
dean of students' office.
• A similar fund has been estab
lished lo enable faculty members
to entertain students in their
homes at informal coffee hours.
Another project of the commit
tee that met with some degree of
success this quarter was a cam
paign to give academic recogni
tion to advisers. This would ena
ble advisers to give more time to
their students.
Recommendation
This recommendation was pass
ed by Legislature and will be
taken under consideration next
year by a sub-committee of the
General Studies Committee, which
is studyir t e current adviser
system wiui an eye to possible
improvement.
Passed by Legislature along with
this proposal was another pet
project of the Student - Faculty
Committee. The committee felt
that students should be present
as consultants and advisers on ad
ministrative committees of the
University.
This does not mean that stu
dents would have a vote in the
administrative rulings of the Uni
versity, but it would make avail
able to the policy-forming bodies
the opinions of students. This has
already been done on several com
mittees.
Departmental Clubs
The Student-Faculty Committee
members have also been working
for the creation of departmental
clubs in which faculty members
and the majors in that depart
ment could eat and talk together
in informal surroundings. The ul
timate aim is a lounge in every
department for this purpose. So
far, this project has been ham
pered by the lack of space in Quad
buildings, but most future expan
sion plans call for the addition of
such lounges. The Philosophy De
partment will construct a lounge
this summer.
Tom Tilt on, present Student-
Faculty Committee chairman, said
that next year's plans call for
close cooperation between the
committee and the Pre-Registra
tion and Foreign Student Hostel
committees. They also plan to
work closely with Legislature and
the ASSU Cabinet.
Next year's officers for this
committee will be Bob Faust as
chairman and Ellen Flint as sec
retary.

paign to give academic recogni
tion to advisers. This would ena
ble advisers to give more time to
their students.
Recommendation
This recommendation was pass
ed by Legislature and will be
taken under consideration next
year by a sub-committee of the
General Studies Committee, which
is studyir t e current adviser
system wiui an eye to possible
improvement.
Passed by Legislature along with
this proposal was another pet
project of the Student - Faculty
Committee. The committee felt
that students should be present
as consultants and advisers on ad
ministrative committees of the
University.
This does not mean that stu
dents would have a vote in the
administrative rulings of the Uni
versity, but it would make avail
able to the policy-forming bodies
the opinions of students. This has
already been done on several com
mittees.
Departmental Clubs
The Student-Faculty Committee
members have also been working
for the creation of departmental
clubs in which faculty members
and the majors in that depart
ment could eat and talk together
in informal surroundings. The ul
timate aim is a lounge in every
department for this purpose. So
far, this project has been ham
pered by the lack of space in Quad
buildings, but most future expan
sion plans call for the addition of
such lounges. The Philosophy De
partment will construct a lounge
this summer.
Tom Tilt on, present Student-
Faculty Committee chairman, said
that next year's plans call for
close cooperation between the
committee and the Pre-Registra
tion and Foreign Student Hostel
committees. They also plan to
work closely with Legislature and
the ASSU Cabinet.
Next year's officers for this
committee will be Bob Faust as
chairman and Ellen Flint as sec
retary.
Student-Faculty Committee has had a relatively short life as ASSU
committees go, but it has a long record of achievement in the two short
years since it was created by Legislature.
The need for closer relations between students and faculty had long
been realized and the Student-Faculty Committee, working with the

Legislature and the Cabinet, has
initiated several programs design
ed to bring about more informal
contacts.
One of their most successful
projects this year was the stu
dent-faculty lunch plan, in which
faculty members regularly eat
lunch in a University residence.
The cost of these lunches is paid
by a fund administered by the
dean of students' office.
• A similar fund has been estab
lished lo enable faculty members
to entertain students in their
homes at informal coffee hours.
Another project of the commit
tee that met with some degree of
success this quarter was a cam
paign to give academic recogni
tion to advisers. This would ena
ble advisers to give more time to
their students.
