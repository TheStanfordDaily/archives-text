# Dallmar Named Top Coach —He Wins Clutch Games
## Daily Picks Cage Head For Winning Contests When Least Expected 
### Dave Canfield 
Coming through with victories
when least expected - that has
been the keynote of the career of
J lowie Dallmar, basketball coach
and The Daily's Stanford "Coach
of the Year."
As a player, he performed on
Stanford's 1912 national cham
pions. That year the Cards, paced
by a towering sophomore named
Jim Pollard and All • American
I>on Burness, streaked to the Pa
cific Coast Conference title and to
the final game in the NCAA play-
Of Is.
But before the championship
game with Dartmouth's Indians
from the East, Pollard contracted
a bad sinus infection and Burness
suffered a leg injury. Neither
could suit up for the finale.
With Stanford's two stars out
of action, the dopesters had Dart
mouth a shoo-in victor. But the
experts did not reckon witli the
clutch play of Dallmar.
15 Points
The 6 foot 4 inch guard pumped
in 15 points at crucial points as
the Cards ran away from the Han
over hoopsters in the second half,
53-38.
Dallmar was picked by the Na
tional Coaches Association as the
most valuable player in the final
NCAA game.
Being called into service the
next year led to more basketball
lor Dallmar. While a naval train
ee at* Pennsylvania he captained
the Quakers to the Ivy League
title. He was voted the outstand
ing player to visit New York in
1945.
When the war ended Dallmar
turned professional for the Phila
delphia Warriors. He got a re
ported $10,000 his first season—
3916-47 and he earned it.
All Pro
Performing the virtually un
heard-of feat of being named all
pro league his first year in the
circuit, Dallmar attracted enough
attention to receive an offer to
coach at Pennsylvania.
Being named head basketball
coach at a major university only
six years after graduating from
Stanford didn't deter Dallmar
from becoming one of the coun
try's winningest coaches.
One hundred and five wins
against only 51 losses was the
phenomenal cumulative record
Dallmar compiled in six seasons
with the Quakers.
In Ivy League competition the
Dallmarmen amassed a 48-26 rec
ord. Their best year was 1953,
when they cdpped the league
crown.
In April. 1954, Dallmar was ap
pointed Stanford's head cage men
tor to replace Bob Burnett. Bur
nett was retiring to enter private
business.
Coaches Cards
With Dalimar calling the sig
nals and Ron Tomsie and Russ
Lawler wearing out the nets, the
Indians of 1954-55 played one of
their toughest schedules in his
tory, yet racked up a 17-8 mark.
Having lost Ternsie and Lawler,
Dallmar faced a big rebuilding
job this year. But he groomed Bill
Bond and Barry Brown into high
scoring stars and midget-phenom
George Selleek into an all-PCC
guard.
It was 1942 all over again as
Dallmar again pulled off several
wins he theoretically shouldn't
have.
Nobody expected the Dallmar
men would upset Washington's
predicted PCC champs two nights
in a row, or edge lowa's eventual
Big Ten titleholders, 54-52.
When The Daily's sports writ
ers voted for coach of the year,
the election wasn't even close.
Swim coach Tom Ilaynie, crew
boss Lou Lindsey and frosh bas
ketball-baseball mentor Dick
Clegg each received one vote.

One hundred and five wins
against only 51 losses was the
phenomenal cumulative record
Dallmar compiled in six seasons

In Ivy League competition the

nett was retiring to enter private

Coaches Cards
With Dalimar calling the sig
nals and Ron Tomsie and Russ
Lawler wearing out the nets, the
Indians of 1954-55 played one of
their toughest schedules in his
tory, yet racked up a 17-8 mark.
Having lost Ternsie and Lawler,
Dallmar faced a big rebuilding
job this year. But he groomed Bill
Bond and Barry Brown into high
scoring stars and midget-phenom
George Selleek into an all-PCC
guard.
It was 1942 all over again as
Dallmar again pulled off several
wins he theoretically shouldn't
have.
Nobody expected the Dallmar
men would upset Washington's
predicted PCC champs two nights
in a row, or edge lowa's eventual
Big Ten titleholders, 54-52.
When The Daily's sports writ
ers voted for coach of the year,

Swim coach Tom Ilaynie, crew

COACH HOWIE DALLMAR
Card "Coach of the Year"
Coming through with victories
when least expected - that has
been the keynote of the career of
J lowie Dallmar, basketball coach
and The Daily's Stanford "Coach
of the Year."
As a player, he performed on
Stanford's 1912 national cham
pions. That year the Cards, paced
by a towering sophomore named
Jim Pollard and All • American
I>on Burness, streaked to the Pa
cific Coast Conference title and to
the final game in the NCAA play-
Of Is.
But before the championship
game with Dartmouth's Indians
from the East, Pollard contracted
a bad sinus infection and Burness
suffered a leg injury. Neither
could suit up for the finale.
With Stanford's two stars out
of action, the dopesters had Dart
mouth a shoo-in victor. But the
experts did not reckon witli the
clutch play of Dallmar.
15 Points
The 6 foot 4 inch guard pumped
in 15 points at crucial points as
the Cards ran away from the Han
over hoopsters in the second half,
53-38.
Dallmar was picked by the Na
tional Coaches Association as the
most valuable player in the final
NCAA game.
Being called into service the
next year led to more basketball
lor Dallmar. While a naval train
ee at* Pennsylvania he captained
the Quakers to the Ivy League
title. He was voted the outstand
ing player to visit New York in
1945.
When the war ended Dallmar
turned professional for the Phila
delphia Warriors. He got a re
ported $10,000 his first season—
3916-47 and he earned it.
All Pro
Performing the virtually un
heard-of feat of being named all
pro league his first year in the
circuit, Dallmar attracted enough
attention to receive an offer to
coach at Pennsylvania.
Being named head basketball
coach at a major university only
six years after graduating from
Stanford didn't deter Dallmar
from becoming one of the coun
