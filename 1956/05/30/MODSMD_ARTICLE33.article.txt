# Dodgers Stop Pirate Streak; Yankees Lose
## Mantle Hits Home Run; Gus Bell Shuns Three In Cincinnati Win 
### 
Don Newcombe fired his way
past the Pittsburgh Pirates yester
day afternoon to halt the Pirates'
six-game winning streak and move
the Dodgers to within 2\'-> games
of the league-leading Milwaukee
Braves.
Homerun belter Dale Long was
hitless in four trips to stop homer
streak at eight straight games.
The losing Pirates fell 1 V> games
behind the Braves and the St.
Louis Cardinals who were both in
active. Brooks Lawrence breezed
to his sixth victory without a loss
while his Cincinnati teammates,
namely Gus Bell, bombed the hap
less Chicago Cubs, 10-4.
Bell walloped three homeruns
and drove across seven of the
runs. The Redlegs are fourth in
the National League.
In the American League, well
known Yankee-beater Willard Nix
on held the league-leaders to three
hits as he chalked up his first con
quest of the season. This was his
first start after being sidelined
with a sore arm.
No Hit Ball
Nixon threw hitless ball for
sevenfcind two-thirds innings until
Billy Martin drove out a triple for
the first hit. The Yanks got their
three runs in the nintli inning with
the aid of Mickey Mantle's 1 Sth
homerun.
Ted Williams made his first
start since the third day of the sea
son and he failed to hit in four
tries. However, Billy Goodman
and Sammy White made up for il
with three safeties apiece.
Bonus baby Harmon Killebrew
replaced Washington star Pete
Runnels today after the latter had
been badly spiked and promptly
whacked a pair of homeruns to
lead Washington to a 6-5 triumph
over Baltimore.
Chi Sox Win
The Chicago White Sox fought
the Kansas City Athletics for
twelve innings last night until Ihe
A's finally succumbed 7-4 in a
game delayed over an hour by
rain. Relief pitcher Jim Wilson
took the win, his sixth of the sea
son.
The Memorial Day doublehead
ers should see little change in the
.standings as most of the first di
vision clubs meet also rans.
The most important activity in
the National League will be the
twinbill in St. Louis where the
Cardinals battle Cincinnati.
