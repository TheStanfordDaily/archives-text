INDIANAPOLIS, May 29 (UP)
â€”A new record for the annual
500-mile Memorial Day speedway
race appeared probable today wit h
the fastest field in the history of
the event ready to take off in the
annual spectacle at 9 a.m. (PDT)
tomorrow.
The 33 starting cars set new
one-lap and four-lap qualification
records. The entire field averaged
142.507 miles per hour, nearly
four miles per hour faster than
last year's group.
The chance for a new record
was heightened, too, by the weath
er forecast. It called for partly
cloudy, warm and humid with
widely scattered thundershowers
and a high temperature of 86.
Three former winners have
been tabbed as among the favo
rites. This trio is headed by last
year's champion, Bob Sweikert.
The others are Johnny Parsons
and Troy Ruttman, winners in
1950 and 1952 respectively.
