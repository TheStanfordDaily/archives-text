### 
WASHINGTON, May 29 (UP*
—Rep. Alfred D. Sieminski <D-
N.J.i introduced legislation today
to forgive former heavyweight
boxing champ Joe Lewis for about
$1 million in back taxes.
"Joe has done a lot for the United
States Government," he said in a
statement. "Whenever he was
called upon, he was there to help.
I hope the Congress will see fit to
help him."
Louis, whose real name is Jo
seph L. Barrow, earned a lot of
money before he retired from the
r ing and piled up a huge backlog
of unpaid taxes. He estimates his
debt to the Government at more
than $1 million but said the Treas
ury never has given him an exact
figure.
Recently, the former champ has
been wrestling and refereeing in
an effort to get out of hock.
Sieminski's bill would free Louis
of "all outstanding liability to the
United States for all taxes . . . for
the period from Jan. 1, 1939, to
Dec. 31, 1954, including* all out
standing liability for additions, ad
ditional amounts, assessable pen
alties, and'interest and for all out
standing interest thereon."
