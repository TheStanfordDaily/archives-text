# SU Symphony, Chorus Give 'Fine Concert'
## Salgo Directs Groups In Interpretation Of 'Romeo et Juliette' 
### Barbara Bachman 
Talented soloists, superb direc
tion, skillful musicians and a pow
erful, dramatic symphony com
bined to render an excellent con
cert for a nearly full house at
Memorial Auditorium last night.
The Stanford Symphony and
Chorus, under the baton of Con
ductor Sandor Salgo, wilh soloists
Margot Helmuth-Blum, contralto;
Churchill Jackson, tenor, and
Stanley Noonan, baritone, pre
sented an emotional, euphonic in
terpretation of Hector Berlioz's
symphony "Romeo el Juliette,"
Shakespeare
Rased on Shakespeare's tragedy
"Romeo and Juliet," the sympho
ny gives the musical version of
the fight between the Montagues
and Capulets, romantic scenes of
Romeo and Juliet and finally the
death of the two lovers.
These acts were well conveyed
to the audience through the musi
cians' exacting and ready re
sponse to Salgo's keen interpre
tations, variations and live feel
ing for the music.
Careful Articulation
From the first movement
through the last, careful articula
tion and varied expression
marked both the orchestral and
choral passages. The symphony
was at its peak in the more deli
cate, quieter scenes, where the
outstanding string and woodwind
sections were allowed to exhibit
their full capacities.
Oboe solos in Part II were
played to perfection. The flute
and harp duet accompanying Con
tralto Blum's solo, provided a
light, melodious background, for
her not-too-powerful voice, as
well as displaying their own re
freshing qualities.
Liveliness
Jackson's spirited liveliness and
precision made up for his lack of
volume, and added the zestful ex
pression needed in this particular
passage.
In the finale, with full chorus
and orchestra combined, Noonan
entered with a strong, correct
voice that held the audience's ear
and added the complementary
touch to the evening.
Although the chorus, nearly 100
strong, had only a comparatively
minor part, they showed readiness
and enthusiasm derived from
Harold Schmidt's rehearsing, and
sang well and correctly both by
themselves and with the entire or
chestra.
Even combined with the 80-piece
instrumental group, they dis
played the admirable trait of
quietness, allowing the soloists to
be clearly heard.
Last night's performance was
the last of this year's 7'uesday
Evening Series sponsored by the
Committee on Public Exercises.

Evening Series sponsored by the
Committee on Public Exercises.
Talented soloists, superb direc
tion, skillful musicians and a pow
erful, dramatic symphony com
bined to render an excellent con
cert for a nearly full house at
Memorial Auditorium last night.
The Stanford Symphony and
Chorus, under the baton of Con
ductor Sandor Salgo, wilh soloists
Margot Helmuth-Blum, contralto;
Churchill Jackson, tenor, and
Stanley Noonan, baritone, pre
sented an emotional, euphonic in
terpretation of Hector Berlioz's
symphony "Romeo el Juliette,"
Shakespeare
Rased on Shakespeare's tragedy
"Romeo and Juliet," the sympho
ny gives the musical version of
the fight between the Montagues
and Capulets, romantic scenes of
Romeo and Juliet and finally the
death of the two lovers.
These acts were well conveyed
to the audience through the musi
cians' exacting and ready re
sponse to Salgo's keen interpre
tations, variations and live feel
ing for the music.
Careful Articulation
From the first movement
through the last, careful articula
tion and varied expression
marked both the orchestral and
choral passages. The symphony
was at its peak in the more deli
cate, quieter scenes, where the
outstanding string and woodwind
sections were allowed to exhibit
their full capacities.
Oboe solos in Part II were
played to perfection. The flute
and harp duet accompanying Con
tralto Blum's solo, provided a
light, melodious background, for
her not-too-powerful voice, as
well as displaying their own re
freshing qualities.
Liveliness
Jackson's spirited liveliness and
precision made up for his lack of
volume, and added the zestful ex
pression needed in this particular
passage.
In the finale, with full chorus
and orchestra combined, Noonan
entered with a strong, correct
voice that held the audience's ear
and added the complementary
touch to the evening.
Although the chorus, nearly 100
strong, had only a comparatively
minor part, they showed readiness
and enthusiasm derived from
Harold Schmidt's rehearsing, and
sang well and correctly both by
themselves and with the entire or
chestra.
Even combined with the 80-piece
instrumental group, they dis
played the admirable trait of
quietness, allowing the soloists to
be clearly heard.
Last night's performance was
the last of this year's 7'uesday
Evening Series sponsored by the
Committee on Public Exercises.
