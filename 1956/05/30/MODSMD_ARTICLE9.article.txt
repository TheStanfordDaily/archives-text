WASHINGTON, May 29 (UP)
President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to slop up the U.S.
atomic energy program to speed
development of peaceful uses and
take advantage of "recent techno
logical advances" in n u 1 c 1e a r
weapons.
While the White House did not
say so, improvements in the
weapons field may have stemmed
from recent tests in the Pacific
where the United States for the
first time dropped a hydrogen
bomb from a plane.
Eisenhower has said the tests
were a success.
The President asked Congress
to authorize an additional $112.5
million for the atomic program in
the fiscal year starting July 1.
This would he in addition to the
$1 (5 billion he originally sought
in his fiscal 1957 budget.
The White House said some
funds will be used "on an accele
rated program in the development
of civilian atomic power reactors."
