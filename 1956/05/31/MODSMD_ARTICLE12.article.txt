# Quads Will Be Distributed On Monday, Tuesday Only
## 
### 
The 1956 Quad, sporting a new black and white cover, will be dis
tributed Tuesday and Wednesday, according to Don Goodrich, Quad
Business Manager.
Students may pick up their books in the Quad office from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Goodrich said students who ordered their names on the
cover must get their Quads Tuesday, while those who ordered their
books without their names may pick them up Wednesday.
These will be the only days for Quad distribution this quarter.
A limited number of the 3600 copies ordered remain to be sold.
Orders for these books will be taken until Tuesday, but studenta
must wait to receive them until Wednesday.
Other innovations in the 1956 Quad include organization by classes
instead of seasons, more candids and a new four-color process in
stead of last year's three-color process.
