# LASSU Votes No Letter On Partisan Ban
## Defeats Plan to Ask Trustees to Change Old Political Ruling 
### Gerry Smith 
Legislature roared through
what was supposed to bo its last
meeting of the year last night, but
they didn't quite make it.
For the members kept leaving
the Ark, two by two, and by the
time the last item on the agenda
came up there wasn't a quorum.
In fact, there weren't enough
members to vote on whether to
have another meeting, but there
will be another meeting next Wed
nesday night.
Among the items brought up at
last night's meeting was a pro
posal by ASSIJ President George
Ralph that Legislature send a
letter to the Hoard of Trustees ask
ing them tu reconsider the prohi
bit inn of p.u'tisan political groups
on campus.
Legislature member Bobbie
Clark had something to say on the
matter. "These groups could
work through the Political Union
if they would just forget their own
personal prejudices. Besides, I
think it's much more fun to ope
rate off campus."

I«i true cloak-and-dagger fash
ion, a procession of Legislature
members shepherded by club
wielding ASSU I* resident
George Ralph marched into the
Daily Shack last night—but not
to pay compliments.
The legislators see nt e d to
have a strange fascination for
film, namely, negatives of the
pictures taken at last night's
Legislature meeting, In fact,
they were so fond of their pho
tographs they carted off two
rolls of film —without permis
sion.
But at filching they're com
parative amateurs —as they left
three rolls of film untouched.
These appear above.

Another Legislature member,
Andy Kjos, said, "When groups
from the Stanford area go to con
ventions, people feel they repre
sent Stanford anyway. And on
campus the school can keep a
closer eye on these groups if they
wish."
Miss Clark had more to say.
"Political education should be in
cluded but not partisan activity.
Political Union provides the means
and everyone has equal opportu
nity."
ASSU President-elect Bob Free
lon answered, "1 must admit our
padded cell at Stanford is pretty
nice. But 1 think we should open
the virgin air of Stanford to par
tisan political activity."
The logic of Miss Clark and
others prevailed the motion was
defeated.
