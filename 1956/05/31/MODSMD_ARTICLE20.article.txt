### DAVE SCOTT 
On June 17, 1165 seniors will receive their
diplomas in Frost Amphitheater.
\\ hat have these graduates io look back upon
after their years at Stanford? What has Stan
ford done for them?
Anne \\ II.SON, Magnolia: "The interesting
contacts among faculty and students have heen
the main advantage for me. It's heen a broad
ening experience, but it is not a culmination
point. It is a starting point, a preparation for
many new and interesting fields.'"
Karen Saiim, Advlfa: "I think it's been a
broadening experience, hut I can't give Stan
ford credit for that. I made the contacts my
self.
"The I Diversity's academic and social poli
cies prohibit the free flow of ideas and encour
age rigidity and conformity. The political fear
pervading the nation lias found its mark here,
preventing questioning and free How of ideas
between students and faculty.
" I he students come from one general typ<*
background, and the value and ideas of this
background are continued here. The undergrad
uate program is not good, and the change is a
change in name only. The admittance policy
needs looking into. I he emphasis should be on
a keen, inquiring mind, not 'good citizens hip'."
Lawson W AKBI KTON, Stern: "It's a combi
nation of fine instruction and wonderful peo
ple in the administration and a good experience
in dealing with people. The environment of
fered by having campus residences and having
kids from many different places helps broaden
OIIP.
Alice Harvey, Naranja: "Academically it
has opened up many fields. Stanford presents
so many varied programs that everyone can find
his niche. However, I've gotten more than aca
demic benefits out of Stanford. Just the experi
ence of meeting people and working with peo

ple fr>iin all over the world. I can't think of a
better way to spend four years."
George Gregory, Wii'bur sponsor: "I've got
ten at least a facsimile of what is referred If)
in your English books as a liberal education,
and I've learned quite a bit about getting along
with people and about the types of occupa
tions."
Nan Litsky, Naranja: "I just think I'm a
better person, intellectually and socially. I'm
more mature in my outlook on life. I got an
awfully nice husband out of it. But that's not
all I came for, and that's not all I got out of it."
John Wright, Wilbur sponsor: "In a sense,
I feel I've gotten a general engineering back
ground, although a little narrow. Being a spon
sor has given me an insight into the problems
of young people. Beside that, I ve gotten a good
girl."
Louise Hincklfy, Adclfn: "The most valu
able part of Stanford for me has been a lot of
contacts with a lot of different people. It's also
given me a good technical background for
chemistry. I must say it's been a lot of fun
most of the time."
Winnie Cok, Hurlburt: "In retrospection
over four years at Stanford, it is difficult to
summarize just which I value the most the
wonderful friends I have made, the op port unity
to think and study under such inspiring pro
fessors. or the chance to develop myself as an
individual. All have contributed toward mak
ing these four years such memorable ones."
Nancy Smalley, Guthrie: "I think it has
been a fine education, opening of new horizons,
learning what more there is to learn. Especially
lor me in my work as a sponsor, the knowing
of so many wonderful people—not only stu
dents hut advisers. These things are what you
remember when you leave—that want you to
come back and to keep pitching for Stanford."
Art Grenier, Toyon: "I've learned how
much I don't know."
