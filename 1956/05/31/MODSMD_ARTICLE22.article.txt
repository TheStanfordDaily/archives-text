# A 						Foreign Scholar's Thanks
## 
### 
A few days are left before we 11 ASSU foreign
scholars leave the Stanford campus after a year
which was, for us, in two words, an exceptional
experience.
When I received the award, more than a year
ago now, I was far from imagining how much I
was to gain from my staying here, and the reality
has certainly passed the best I was forecasting
while getting ready for the trip, in my native
Tangier, Morocco.
You Stanford students not only gave us the
scholarships; you have welcomed us in an unfor
gettable way, and, more, you taught us a great
lesson in international relations. And if you learn
ed a little bit from us, then our coming was worth
while.
Members of the Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee, you have given us a great deal of your time
in organizing our stay, and with great enthusi
asm. This I won't forget, either.
SAE's, you were the first to greet at Stanford
a student who was entering a way of life entirely

different from his, and who just did not know
what to expect here. But you made him feel at
home right away, and he adopted you from ihe
very first day.
DU's, you proved to be a great group of boys
for me all through winter quarter, and you know
how much I have appreciated living with you!
Phi Sigs, you have finished to Americanize a
crew-cut boy whose name has now changed to
"Al," and who would purely wish, upon leaving
you next week, to tell you: "Iley, you guys, see
you soon on Quad!"
Good bye, Connies, Ellies, Kays, Loises, Pats,
Pegs, Sallys, Sues. . . .
Good-bye, Dicks, Duns, Eds, Jims, Mikes, Phils,
Rons, Teds . . . and Als!
Yes, I will long—very long remember your
American names, with a point of emotion.
Good-bye, and thank you!
