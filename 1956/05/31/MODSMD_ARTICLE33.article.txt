Setting a goal for perfection dp
spite physical handicaps is a qual
ity to he desired, but such is char
acterized bv George Selleck, cap
tain of Stanford's 1955-56 basket
ball team. The popular senior
guard was selected as Athlete of
the Year by the Daily sports staff.
Selleck. leaving the Farm after
three brilliant years on the Stan
ford maplecourt, has received na
tional recognition, All-P aci 112 i c
Coast Conference honors and, to
top his career, W&s awarded the
J. Gimbel Athletic Attitude Prize
for showing the best attitude to
ward athletics.
Finest, Pound for Pound
Stanford's "Mighty Mite" only
stands 5 ft. 8 in.â€”a present-day
midget in the land of basketball
giants. Yet this handicap coupled
with a crippled knee has not slow
ed down the sensational court
master who diligently works for
perfection.
"The finest little man, pound
for pound, in basketball," his

I coach, Howie Dallmar, honestly
| proclaims ami Dallmar has trav
eled the basketball circles. The
team's "spark plug" makes up for
his lack of size with speed, hustle
[ and finesse.
I lis coach adeptly described Sel
leck's style of play when he said:
"If you had 10 men standing on
the floor and rolled a ball out,
Selleck would get it every time."
Teamed with Tomsic
The fearless court captain has
been described as the "play mak
er," the "scorer," the "speedster,"
the "dribbler," the "perfectionist,"
the "hall-controller" and the
"game coach."
Selleck played his sophomore
and junio\years alongside anoth
er Indian great, Ron Tomsic. To
gether they made the best pair of
guards in the country. In his first
season on the Card varsity George
was the second highest scorer in
the Southern Division, Pacific
Coast Conference, and was select
ed on the second All-PCC squad.
Regardless of his high scoring,
the little general was noted as the
cool play-maker; Ihe man who
kept Stanford's five together, be
hind or ahead. In his junior year
he hit for 41 per cent of his field
goal attempts and 73 per cent of
his foul tries. That year the Unit
ed Press chose Selleck on their
"Small All - Amer ica" basketball
team.
All-Northern Cal
This year the e'nergetic guard
was unanimously selected on the
All-Northern California basket
ball team and lacked one vote of
being unanimous on the All-PCC
quintet. In 16 PCC tilts Selleck
scored 265' points, an average of
16.6. He bucketed 105 field goals,
third in the league.
Leading the Indians to 18 wins,
the team player was all over the
floor at the same time. A San
Francisco sports writer had this
to' say of Selleck after the Cal
series: "It was a common sight to
see the hustling captain and
guard in the middle of every play,
including fighting for rebounds
agdinst giants who outweighed
him by more than 50 pounds."
The little hustler was known as
the "ball hawk." a constant threat
no matter which team had the
ball. Some observers are of the
opinion Selleck had personal con
trol of the ball 40 per cent of the
game's time with his stealing,
dribbling and setting-up plays.


SCRAMBLING ON THK FLOOR for a loose ball is George Selleck,
Stanford's All-Pacific Coast Conference guard. The scrappy hall
hawk spent much of his lime in just such u position as this during
most of last season. Also battling for the loose casaba arc Carl
Isaacs (right) and an unidentified St. Mary's eager (left).
