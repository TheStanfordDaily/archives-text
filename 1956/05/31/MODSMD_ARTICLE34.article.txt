# New Pavilion Plans Drawn In Magazine

### 
A proposed diamond-s hap e d
sports pavilion for Stanford Uni
versity is featured In an article in
the May issue of Architectural
Record, a national magazine for
architects and engineers.
Architect John Carl Warnecke
designed the indoor sports arena
in an effort to achieve a large
non-interrupted playing area as
well as a good view from any seat
in the pavilion.
"The plan is awfully beautiful
and we'd love to have it,"says
athletic publicity director Don
Liebendorfer, "but we have no
method of financing it."
The athletic department is pon
dering on ways and means of
building the pavilion, according to
Liebendorfer.
"The building of such a pavilion
is not impossible at all, but highly
improbable in the immediate fu
ture," he added.
The pavilion would seat 8000.
Approximately 2800 folding blea
cher seats would permit the con
version of the single competitive
court into three cross-courts.
A unique element of the build
ing is a glazed diamond-shaped
eye across the roof ridge which
would admit diffused light during
the day and provide the focal
point of central accent at night.
The proposed red-tile roof
would fit in well with other Stan
ford buildings. Basically the struc
ture would consist of diagonal
steel ribs whose supports would
be located so that they would not
interfere with free vision from
any of the seating areas.
