from 13th place to finish second
only 21 seconds behind Flaherty
• —while Don Freeland, Los Ange
les, was third and Johnny Par
sons, the 1950 winner from Van
Nuys, Calif., fourth.

hurt. Tony Bettenhausen, Tinley
Park, 111., suffered a shoulder in
jury when he hit the wall on the
south straightaway and spun into
the infield.
