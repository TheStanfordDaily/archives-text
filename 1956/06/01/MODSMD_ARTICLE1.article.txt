# Russia Leads Nuclear Race, Says Panofsky

High-energy nuclear physics
research is developing at a high
er rate in Russia than in the
United States, said Professor
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
the Stanford High-Energy Phys
ics Laboratory, in an interview
yesterday.
Panofsky has just returned
from a conference of 1000 physi
cists held in Russia earlier this
month.
Russia is "going into the con
struction of high-energy acceler
ators in a big way," Panofsky
said. According to him, the Rus
sian program is clearly a crash
program type of operation. A
large amount of money is being
allocated toward research in an
effort to speed Russia's pro
gram.
When asked whether there
was any specific goal in mind

for the extensive research, Pa
nofsky remarked it is pure re
search and there cannot be any
applied scientific goal in mindâ€”
just investigation.
Panofsky said at the present
time Russia's largest operating
high-energy research machine is
a 680 M.E.V. (million electron
volt) Synchro Cyclotron. They
are presently constructing a 10
B.E.V. Proton Synchroton which
should be finished in about one
year. A 50 B.E # .V. machine is also
in the planning stage.
The largest research machine
in the United States at the pres
ent time is a six B.E.V. machine.
A 25 B.E.V. machine is in the
engineering stage now and will
be built in Brookhaven, Connec
ticut. A similar one is at Cern,
Switzerland.
Panofsky was quite enthusias
tic over the prospects of ex

changing technical correspond
ence with Russian physicists. He
said there was far less restric
tion in this field. At the confer
ence technical papers still could
not be passed on to the visiting
physicists by the Russians until
they had been formally publish
ed, but verbal information was
freely passed among the scien
tists.
"I believe the conference was
of mutual benefit to both Rus
s i a n sand ourselves. We can
learn a comparable amount from
them," Panofsky said.
The Stanford physicist said
the American delegation of 14
physicists was well treated and
the members were not restricted
in their movements. They were
also furnished translators, but
Panofsky said he could often
speak German with many of the
Russians although few of them

spoke English.
Panofsky said he was greatly
impressed with the dissimilarity
between Russia's advanced sci
entific achievement and the av
erage over - all technical level.
"The benefits of science have
not yet reached the consumer,"
he said.
Panofsky said he feels the
worry by Russian scientists over
internal repression has been de
creased in the last few years.
Scientists in Russia, he said, are
extremely well paid, relative to
the general population. The Rus
sian scientist receives ir pur
chasing power about the same
amount as an American scien
tist, But other occupations do
not come close in wages to their
counterparts m the United
States.
Russia is doing everything it
can to build up incentives for

students to enter the scientific
field, Panofsky said. There are
2000 physics majors currently
enrolled in Moscow State Uni
versity. This is more than the
combined enrollment of physics
majors in the entire San Fran
cisco Bay Area.
The only high Russian official
Panofsky met while at the con
ference was President of the
Academy of Scientists Nesmaya
now, who is administrator of sci
ence in the Russian government,
a job of ministerial capacity.
Russia, Panofsky said, carries
on a centralized scientific re
search program as large as any
U. S. research program would be
if the U. S. combined the pro
grams of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Army, Air
Force and Navy with those of
many private institutions.
