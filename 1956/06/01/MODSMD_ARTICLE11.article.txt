### Joan Woods 
Space allotment in the yet-to-be
constructed student activities cen
ter was the chief topic of discus
sion at last night's ASSU Cabinet
meeting.
Final drawings for the proposed
student office building were pre
sented. Bill Tooley, ASSU busi
ness manager, explained the gen
era! set-up as it now stands.
Toolev stressed that nothing
was yet final and that the space
allotments would remain flexible,
at least in part, for some time.
ASSU President George Ralph
pointed out that space allocations
must remain flexible to meet the
changing needs of student gov
ernment.
Activities Center
The activities center will be
built across Santa Teresa Street in
back and to ihe south of the pres
ent Women's Clubhouse. A breeze
way will run underneath the
building. It will be closed to traf
fic and open only to the fire de
partment, which will need it in
order to get to the other side of
the campus in a hurry.
Other traffic will be rerouted
I along the periphery road, which
has already been started and will
be completed next autumn.
The first floor of the activities
building will include bowling al
leys, a game room containing pool
tables, a possible music room, and
snack bar and other eating facili
ties.
Second Floor
The second floor will contain all
student offices and active campus
groups. Thirty offices and confer
ence rooms have been provided,
built around a large 1200 square
foot central conference room or
meeting place. According to Too
ley, this will "give more unity to
the building and provide for more
interchange among the various
campus groups." These are now
scattered over campus and have
relatively little contact with each
other.
An 8000 - square • foot pavilion
will be constructed across a land
scaped patio from the activities
building. It will he used for all
conferences, on • campus dances
and rallies. Tt will also have kitch
en facilities nearby and can be
converted into a banquet room
seating 1000 people.
The present Union Residence
will be converted into a hotel for
campus visitors.
The completed plans will be pre
sented to the Board of Trustees
at their .June meeting.
