### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 31
(UP)â€”Coach Lynn Waldorf and
Athletic Director Greg Englehard
both emphatically denied today
that the University of California
was engaged in a "phony job"
racket for school athletes.
Replying to charges by J. Mil
ler Leavy, prominent UCLA alum
nus, that the Golden Bears were
guilty of illegal pay off practices
to athletes, Englehard said:
"I assume that all those charges
from Leavy deal with the off
campus jobs held by our athletes.
These jobs are lined up by an or
ganization called the Berkeley
Bear Backers. Not more than 40
persons in our athletic program,
where there are 1400 competing,
have these jobs. About one-third
of our football teams have them.
"It is not illegal for atheltes to
hold off-campus jobs. These jobs
are working jobs where the men
earn their money. There's nothing
wrong with that, is there? We
have no jobs available, or offered,
where there is no work connect
ed."
Coach Waldorf admitted they
have run across some rule viola
tions in past years. But always
every precaution has been made
to meet the Pacific Coast Confer
ence regulations.
"We had a general realignment
on the off-campus work program
seme years ago," said Waldorf.
"It now is all within the PCC
code. There have been some irreg
ularities in the past, but we have
always cleared these up as soon
as possible.
