Editor, The Daily:
Perusing the report on my address, "The Stakes of Democracy in
Southeast Asia and the Indonesian Problem," I read . . Indonesia's
population, made up almost entirely of Japanese collaborators . .
This statement of.your reporter is in my opinion a little bit more
than a serious blunder. I want to deny with the greatest stress also
on behalf of my Indonesian friends that I ever have said such a thing.
1 did say—and I am prepared to repeat it any time- that Mr. Su
karno (the first puppet-president of the Indonesian Republic during
the .Japanese occupation 1 '), who is now'touring the U.S. on a goodwill
mission in the "hail-fellow-well met" style, was a Japanese collabora
tor, who took his final orders from "Japanese Headquarters" after
their capitulation.
Although the remainder of your report is giving a completely dis
torted picture of the views I expressed, I won't comment on that.
Thank you for the hospitality accorded to me in your columns.
