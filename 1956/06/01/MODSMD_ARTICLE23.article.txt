Sixty-one years ago this week the Pioneer graduating class from
Stanford "parsed into history," the Daily Palo Alto of May 29,1895 said.
Mis. Leland Stanford, on Saturday, May 25, 1895, held a reception
in her richly-furnished San Francisco mansion for 400 Pioneers, fac
ulty members and University trustees.
Highlights of the gay afternoon included speeches, music from a i

huge Swiss orchestrion and an in
spection of Mr. and Mrs. Stan
ford's priceless treasurers.
Among the cynosures of all eyes
was a marble bust of Leland Stan
ford Junior.
Hoover and Friends
Four days later, on the morning
of May 29, 1895, 167 seniors, fu
ture-President Herbert Hoover in
cluded, trailed out of old Encina
Gymnasium with the first sheep
skins Stanford ever handed out.
In their ears were the music of
the invocation and the words of
commencement speaker John M.
Stillman. Stillman, a member of
ihe faculty, delivered an address
on "Specialization in Education."
"II wasn't much of a ceremony,"
admitted Donald H. Fry, one of
six living members of the Class of
'95.
David Stan Jordan
Fry, a resident of Palo Alto
whose voice belies his 80-odd
years, reminisced, "The night of
graduation I was walking around
the Quad with President David
Starr Jordan. He and I wore alone.
1 was asking him many questions.
One of the questions I had was
why were so many of my inti
mates dropped?"
Jordan told Fry it was because
of their "kiddish behavior."
"I did a lot of kiddish stuff too,"
Fry was candid to admit. "But he
told me that I was not fired be
cause I was the youngest member
of my class, I didn't drink and I
had no ulterior meaness,"
Fry, other students and faculty
members realized fellow graduate
Hoover's great capacities.
"The members of the faculty,"
Fry declared, "thought he had
great possibilities and was going
to be heard from. In meetings he
would always get in the last word
and sum things up."
"Baby Faee"
The man who would in 1928 be
elected President of the United
States had a round, boyish-looking
face in 1895.
"His friend Bill Orcutt," related
Fry, "advised Hoover, when he
was going out to look for a job,
to grow a beard, in order to look
more grown up."
Hoover, Fry said, protested that
growing a beard would be dis
honest. "Hell," snapped back
Orcutt, "it's your beard." In the
end the future chief executive
grew his beard and landed the job.
The Pioneer Class held a 50th
reunion in 1945. At another get
together last year 10 members of
the class showed up. Three days
ago six graduates of Ihe Class of
'95 wore all that arrived for a cam
pus reunion.
