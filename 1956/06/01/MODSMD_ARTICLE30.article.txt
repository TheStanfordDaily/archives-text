# Lest We Forget
## 
### 
Many foreigners, of whom I am one. enter the I niled States
witli a very near child-like belief in respect to certain forms of
Americana.
Some never outgrow ibis belief, and as a consequence they
suffer the lo>s of never being able to appreciate the objective
"good which abounds in this land.
Hut others learn from life that here, as'well as at home, "goodf"
is relative, and that all things, to be fairh measured, must be ap
praised in the light of realism.
Before coming to Stanford and during the first months in this
area, one has the impression of the ideal without the benefit of
fact or honest comparison.
Suddenly my dreams were dashed to the ground. Despite the
logic of my having maintained approximate!) the highest grade
in one class throughout last quarter, an instructress flatly and
simply refused to change tin 1 final grade from the kk l>" I had re
ceived to the "A" I had earned.
I will always strive to do my best in college. Hut I also want
recognition for the work I do well.
I suggest that when a student protest.* a grade as unfair, pro
fessors and their assistants should make all efforts either to justif\
that grade or correct it.
Such action would go far toward eliminating misunderstand
ing and promoting student-faeultv good v\ ill.
I think the teacher used a very poor judgment in my case, and
I hope my suggestion will be considered foi the future.
At first this episode angered me, for the behavior of this per
son was utterly inconsistent with the Stanford standard which I
had conceived.
Hut in the time that has intervened a new understanding has
prevaded my consciousness: there is no perfection in the world
of fact; everything is a matter of degree.
And so now I see Stanford realistically. It is a very fine insti
tution with much to recommend it in comparisons with other
universities and colleges.
Hut it is not perfection, neither in the manner in which it
chooses to operate nor in the people in which it vest responsibility.
It is a human institution and it is subject to human error.
I hanks to the limitations of one Stanford incompetent. I for
the first time feel a part of the "Stanford family."
