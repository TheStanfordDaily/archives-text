# The Foreign Scene

### Helen Dewar 
Looking in retrospect over the past nine months, it seems the mid
-1950's may mark the beginning of a painful, but enlightening re
appraisal of the United States' role in international affairs, the char
acter of her national interest and the potential strength of her cur
rent foreign policy.
With the latest swing of the Soviet pendulum, the United States has
sunk into a period of confusion, reacting negatively to situations
caused in the first place by a determined, precise Soviet policy rather
than creating her own pattern of dynamic action.
American foreign policy, or lack of policy, toward the Middle East
has been indicative of 111 is country's desire to please both sides and
its failure to take imaginative, strong action for fear of alienating one
faction and making it more amendable to Communist propaganda.
The futile attempt to set up the Middle East Treaty Organization
(Baghdad Pact) as a bulwark against Communist infiltration in the
Aral) tinderbox was overshadowed by the spreading appeal of an Arab
alliance designee) to further purely Arab interests in defiance of West
ern defense entanglements.
On Both Sides of the Fence
Although offering backstage encouragement, the United States re
lused to join the METO bloc, reflecting her desire to placate both
the pro-Western and neutralist groups of Arab nations, and at the
same time providing a satisfying answer to neither.
Defense pacts on which the United States has placed so much empha
sis carry little weight with non-Western nations who often seek inde
pendence from the old colonial powers more determinedly than they
do security from Communist aggression.
In a sense, this uncertainty is a hangover from the traditional
neutralist spirit which pervaded foreign policy attitudes for more
than 150 years.
Even more it seems to reflect inexperience with the awesome trust
evolving upon a leader a leader who, by its formost portion among
democratic nations, has both advertently and inadvertently accepted
(tie responsibility for guidance and protection of nations fighting for
security and independence in an unstable world.
The Illusive "Geneva Spirit"
The United States now seems to be suffering the after-affects of
that elusive "Geneva spirit",which sent Western hopes Hying during
the summer and autumn months.
But then what seemed to be an impending break in the Cold War
laded away into a more sober realization of Soviet motives when the
Big Three met for a second time in Geneva in the late fall to thrash
out the key problems of armament reduction, German unity and
cultural, informational and scientific exchanges.
Although failing to solve these problems, the conference was not
a total failure, for it pointed out to the West that behind the broad
smiles and pleasant words of the Soviet diplomats lay the familiar
intransigence when concessions of any significance are involved.
Especially in the Far East and Mediterranean area, the new Soviet
economic and propaganda drive has begun to reap more harvests than
had the old doctrinaire policy of aggressive Communist infiltration.
The Subtle Approach
The strongest indication of the new trend in Russian policy was
ihf apparent realization among Soviet leaders that the Stalin-type of
Russian nationalism had long outlived its usefulness and that a subtle
approach would be more productive in luring countries who fear
Soviet aggression and yet desire technical and economic aid in suffi
cient quantity to free themselves from their quasi-colonial ties to the
rribre powerful Western nations.
Backed by powerful states such as India, Saudi Arabia and Egypt,
nations whose military outlays are mere dots beside Russian strength
fear they are prodding the Soviet Union into aggression when they
sign defense alliances with Western powers.
Among her Europe allies the United States has seen dissent created
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by the relaxation of ten
sions and the lessened demand for immediate unity in face of a com
mon enemy.
NATO's Economic Necessities
But only recently has this country seen the necessity for remolding
the outdated NATO structure into a more tightly bound society of
democratic nations dedicated to economic improvement as well as
military defense.
Although history seems to indicate that Russian tactics are directed
toward complete Communist dominance of the world, the United
States may be sacrificing her one chance to create a stable peace if
she dogmatically crushes tJie sincere along with the false in Soviet
peace pursuits.
