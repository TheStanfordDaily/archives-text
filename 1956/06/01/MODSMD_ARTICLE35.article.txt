# 'Mr. Daily'

### 
A devoted friend and faithful advisor, he's been The Daily's unbailed
"man of the year" for the past 31 years. Wilbur Bailey came to work
for the Stanford Press in 1925 and since then has worked behind the
linotype machine on Daily stories, this year taking over composition
of Tin* Daily's four pages. Sixty-two editors have come and gone,
and The Daily's beloved "Mr. Bailey" has seen it all.
