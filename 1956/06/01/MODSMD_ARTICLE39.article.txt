# The 						Long Road to Nowhere

### 
STANFORD WILL SOON GRADUATE the class
of 1956. As this class leaves the Uni
versity, what kind of a world will be thrust
upon it? It will be the same world from
which the class had so recently escaped—the
world of materialism, complacency and pros
perily, the great land of the status quo.
The majority of graduates are the so-called
"average" students, many of whom received
excellent grades. They are "well-adjusted."
Tiny are lost.
They are lost because of the very fact that
they are "adjusted," for "adjusted" in this
world means to be in harmony with the col
lective way of life, where all drive the same
cars, all wear the stylish clothes, all are keep
ing up with I lie Joneses. The material con
formity is evident, but just as evident is the
intellectual conformity.
They all speak the same refined idiom—to
be "well-adjusted"' is to say the right thing
at 11 le right time, but, what is worse: to be
"well-adjusted" is to think the right thing
at the right time—the right thing being the
majority opinion. "Adjustment," then, is
their educational goal and one which most
reach.
I hey are happy. Hut theirs is an empty
happiness. They have searched for and found
the knowledge-by-rote necessary for their
"well-adjusted" material life.
\ cry soon the I hirst for knowledge will be
replaced by the lliirst. for acquisition, "to get
ahead." Greed is the word. "Security" is
the result.
Most do "set ahead" and reach their idol
of "security." lint where do they go from
there? Nowhere. They have reached the
great goal.
Hut lhey are not seeure any more than
they are happy. They are well-fed and well
salaried—and they arc dead.
I he minute they start believing that this
is lh«; "best of all possible worlds," they have

died. And they lie in their well-lined eoflins
of smug provincialism, preaching "security,
security, security—at all costs"—even at the
cost of intellectual freedom. For an individ
ual free thinker cannot conform and hence,
cannot gain "security."
They have become set in. their ways, vic
tims of mans endless self-deception.
They bring their children into the world
and teach them to reach for the same goals
which they have so foolishly sought after.
By the time their offspring reach the gates
of higher learning they know what they seek,
for they have learned their lessons well. They
enter the University a product of their stere
otyped backgrounds, and almost all leave in
the same stereotyped condition.
On entering the University they run smack
into their teachers—a group of non-conform
ists, a group of truly intellectual persons
whose goals are, for the most part, in com
plete opposition to those of their students.
These instructors spend four years teaching
their stereotyped pupils the facts which will
lead them out of their choking forest of false
values—but to little avail.
The University tries, and its attempts are
far superior to those of most universities.
That her graduates use only what they are
taught for purposes of expediency in their
search for security is not Stanford's fault; it
is the fault of the wor' I in which the gradu
ates live—the world which teaches them to
scoff at idealism, liberalism and non-con
formity as "naive."
Obviously we cannot learn this lesson ab
stractly, for it seems to be a pathetic weak
ness of human nature that such things must
be shown the hard way.
Some day, when the individual freedoms
are completely gone, when we are all "think
ing the right thing at the right time," we will
remember the spirit of individual free think
ing on which this nation was founded, and
perhaps start on the long road back.
