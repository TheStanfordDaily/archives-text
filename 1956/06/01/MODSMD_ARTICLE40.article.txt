# To the Editor
## 
### 
I radition calls for an out<»;oiii{»; editor to
leave behind him a legacy of advice for his
successor. Well, Lennie, you do not need iny
advice. You have spent three actively-filled
years illl The Daily; you know the tech
niques of I lie job; you will be able to apply
these techniques far better than I.
But there are some thoughts which I can
leave behind, which represent things that
you have never had the opportunity to ex
perience. These are the feelings which you
can experience only in your term as editor.
You will face the cries of the "red-hots"
who interpret the role of The Daily as that
of a "spirit-lifter,' 1 a substitute for their own
efforts.
on will find that those with the narrow
est minds make the loudest noises. They will
complain when you comment on the things
which arc not within their narrow sphere of
provincialism.
They will laugh at your liberalism; they
will call you "naive" because you hold your
ideals so highly.
Hut you will grasp tightly to your ideals.
on will publish a newspaper, and be
damned lor "naively" believing that yours is
the job of informing and stimulating the in
tellect.
All is not criticism. You will meet some of
the world's real people — those who have

been able to hold on to their "naivety" de
spite the scoffers around them. You will find
inspiration in men like Wallace Sterling and
James Watkins.
You will have the inspiration of your staff
. . . the group that is The Daily, the people
who make it what it is. They are your best
friends.
You will feel gratified when you realize
that you have given all you can muster to a
most wonderful group of readers. They, not
the "red-hots," are your real audience.
Lennie, you will realize that The Daily is
one of the few truly independent newspapers
in the nation. Keep it that way. Let the "red
hots" in student government cry for control;
control which would allow tliein to use The
Daily for their own narrow purposes. Let
them cry; let them use The Daily as a scape
goat for the failure of their own efforts. But
don't give in.
You have your ideals; you have your out
standing talent and you have your goal.
Hold to them. You have all the tools to make
a great editor, most of which I have lacked.
You will be a great editor. You will make
The Daily the great force in student life
which it should be.
Good-bye and good luck. Give 'em hell.
—Dick
