athletic system is often challenged. As a
member of the Stanford family, every stu

others. Yoii who know the men who run the
University and who compose the Department,
of Athletics have a firm foundation for your
beliefs.
For the coaches and athletic department,
chiefs you have respect which grows from
personal experience and comes from a grand
stand view of the results of their work.
You believe in the Stanford athletic sys
tem because you believe in the people who
run it. Andy ,u know you are different from
students at other colleges because of that
belief.

ford Axe, for in its blade is the strength of
a University devoted to an ideal.
