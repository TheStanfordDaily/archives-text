### Jim Palmer 
Twenty years ago the United States Supreme Court
was under severe criticism for its decisions adverse
to New Deal legislation and from many places, in
cluding the White House, came proposals to reor
ganize and curb the judiciary.
None of these proposals ever succeeded as the
Court subsequently changed its philosophy under
the influence of an influx of new justices.
Not since then has the high tribunal come under
as much critical concern as it has during the current
term. Not confined to Southern hostility at the seg
regation decisions, the attacks at Chief Justice Earl
Warren's court have come from legal historians,
analysts and columnists.
The basis of the strong protests now being voiced
are a series of decisions "striking down state statutes
to the seeming advantage of the Communist cause
in America." And, of course, there are continued
rebel yells from the South over the 1954 segregation
decision, with Former Justice Jimmy Byrnes declar
ing, "The Supreme Court must be curbed."
How widespread the criticism is can be revealed
by a reported statement made by a former presi
dent of the American Bar Association before a con
gressional committee to the effect that "98 per cent
of America's good lawyers have no respect for the
legal ability of members of the Supreme Court."
Such a charge is a serious one and it stems from
the court's decision in such opinions as in the Penn
sylvania v. Steve Nelson and the Subversive Activi
ties Control Board ruling cases. But the real worry
is that the court has become less objective and not
completely detached from the political arena as it
should bo.
Vice-President Nixon's reference to Warren as a
"Republican Chief Justice" added fuel to the fire.
Charges of judicial legislation and use of ideological
bases for decisions have increased.

Proposals have come from Southern Senators to
set standards of previous experience for justices. One
would requiie five years on the bench, another 10.
Who would such proposals affect? Of the current,
court make-up only two justices, Minton and Harlan,
had bench experience when appointed.
Distinguished former law professors Frankfurter
and Douglas would not qualify, nor would former
Senators Black or Burton, former Attorney General
Clark and Solicitor General Reed, not to mention the
Chief Justice, who has a legal background in Cali
fornia.
There is danger in the attempts being made to
change the character of the court, just as there was
twenty years ago. While one may become vexed at
court rulings it is extremely doubtful that any change
would bo one for the good.
The year has been an important one for the Warren
Court. Where there are important decisions, there
will always be a disatisfied party because there is
always a losing side to every case. Those who pur
port to set themselves up as judges of judges should
be viewed with a cautious eye and handled carefully,
for they can be a menace to the American system of
jlistice and democratic government.
Criticism may be deserved from time to time, but
if one considers the distinguished quality of the pres
ent Court there is considerable reason for confidence
in the integrity and wisdom of it in the long run.
Be wary of the loosely formulated charges and the
'ill-advised yells of disgruntled Southerners. The com
ing terms of 'he Court will be of increasing impor
tance in the areas of segregation and subversion.
It is in these areas that the cries of indignation
will be the loudest. Those who hope to discredit the
operations of America's highest court should be
countered by those who believe in the abilUy and
strength of the nine justices.

Vice-President Nixon's reference to Warren as a
"Republican Chief Justice" added fuel to the fire.
Charges of judicial legislation and use of ideological
bases for decisions have increased.

Proposals have come from Southern Senators to
set standards of previous experience for justices. One
would requiie five years on the bench, another 10.
Who would such proposals affect? Of the current,
court make-up only two justices, Minton and Harlan,
had bench experience when appointed.
Distinguished former law professors Frankfurter
and Douglas would not qualify, nor would former
Senators Black or Burton, former Attorney General
Clark and Solicitor General Reed, not to mention the
Chief Justice, who has a legal background in Cali
fornia.
There is danger in the attempts being made to
change the character of the court, just as there was
twenty years ago. While one may become vexed at
court rulings it is extremely doubtful that any change
would bo one for the good.
The year has been an important one for the Warren
Court. Where there are important decisions, there
will always be a disatisfied party because there is
always a losing side to every case. Those who pur
port to set themselves up as judges of judges should
be viewed with a cautious eye and handled carefully,
for they can be a menace to the American system of
jlistice and democratic government.
Criticism may be deserved from time to time, but
if one considers the distinguished quality of the pres
ent Court there is considerable reason for confidence
in the integrity and wisdom of it in the long run.
Be wary of the loosely formulated charges and the
'ill-advised yells of disgruntled Southerners. The com
ing terms of 'he Court will be of increasing impor
tance in the areas of segregation and subversion.
It is in these areas that the cries of indignation
will be the loudest. Those who hope to discredit the
operations of America's highest court should be
countered by those who believe in the abilUy and
strength of the nine justices.
Twenty years ago the United States Supreme Court
was under severe criticism for its decisions adverse
to New Deal legislation and from many places, in
cluding the White House, came proposals to reor
ganize and curb the judiciary.
None of these proposals ever succeeded as the
Court subsequently changed its philosophy under
the influence of an influx of new justices.
Not since then has the high tribunal come under
as much critical concern as it has during the current
term. Not confined to Southern hostility at the seg
regation decisions, the attacks at Chief Justice Earl
Warren's court have come from legal historians,
analysts and columnists.
The basis of the strong protests now being voiced
are a series of decisions "striking down state statutes
to the seeming advantage of the Communist cause
in America." And, of course, there are continued
rebel yells from the South over the 1954 segregation
decision, with Former Justice Jimmy Byrnes declar
ing, "The Supreme Court must be curbed."
How widespread the criticism is can be revealed
by a reported statement made by a former presi
dent of the American Bar Association before a con
gressional committee to the effect that "98 per cent
of America's good lawyers have no respect for the
legal ability of members of the Supreme Court."
Such a charge is a serious one and it stems from
the court's decision in such opinions as in the Penn
sylvania v. Steve Nelson and the Subversive Activi
ties Control Board ruling cases. But the real worry
is that the court has become less objective and not
completely detached from the political arena as it
should bo.
