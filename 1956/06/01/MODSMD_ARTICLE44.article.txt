"I Hate Cops." "No Govern
ment Is the Best Government."
With these campaign slogans
George Ralph went on to win the
ASSU presidency for the 1955-56
University year in an election
which saw the greatest percent
age of votes ever cast in a cam
pus final election—3993, 60 per
cent of the student body.
Now a year after his election
Ralph evaluates his administra
tion. "The significant things that
happened were the least drama
tic," Ralph said.
He listed the discussion of re
ligious offering on the campus,
the discussion of student activi
ties and the establishment of
weekend hostels as the main ac
complishments of student gov
ernment.
During the last quarter groups
have been meeting to discuss
methods by which students can
receive stimulating religious of
fering. Also a committee has
been evaluating student activi
ties. The elimination of "Back
to-the-Farm Week" as an activity

is one of their accomplishments.
Ralph said plans are now being made for the new
student union and activities center and a new pa
vilion.
"Winning the Axe, of course," highlighted the year
he added.
For the first lime the students were given a chance
to decide whether to remain in the National Student
Association. "We've been in and out many times and
who knows, next year we might be in again."
As for next year, Ralph said that a few bylaw
changes still remain to be made. Also he said there
probably would bo discussion of student activities
"with an eye to discarding those which'don't interest
the student."
At the beginning of his campaign last year Ralph
had no intention of winning. It was a .joke. He had
placards made with "Wild One" campaign slogans
and a picture of himself with long sideburns and
a motorcycle jacket.

But his .gimmick drew votes—
votes of every so-called "apa
thetic" student. He won the pri
mary election.
Ralph then realized that he had
a chance to win and that chance
was better than average. He
changed his tactics. He shaved
off the sideburns, discarded the
motorcycle jacket and campaign
slogans and dressed up in a suit
and tie. With this new air about
him he took part in the campus
debates over student issues.
In answering six questions
asked the four candidates by The
Daily, the 21-year-old history ma
jor from Paine s vi 11 e, Ohio,
pledged that he would do his best
to limit the new constitution by
eliminating its committees.
"It seems to me," Ralph said,
"that we could dismiss a few of
ficers and a few dozen commit
tees and never know the differ
ence."
This was his answer to what
he considered to be the role of
sludent government at Stanford.

When asked what his opinions
were on the recently adopted constitution he said it
is "a good example of the growing bureaucracy."
On last Oct. 12 Ralph delivered his "State of the
Union" message to Legislature. He proposed that
they concentrate on four major areas — student
union, public relations, traffic and parking and mem
bership in the National Student Association.
The new Donald B. Tresidder Memorial Union
honoring Stanford's fourth president will begin
construction before the year is out.
Public relations is a year-to-year job entailing
speaking engagements and the signing of the non
agression pact with California. Also the Public Re
lation Boaid was revamped.
To tackle the traffic and parking problem Ralph
and Legislature formed a committee headed by Bob
Maddock. Maddock's gioup worked closely with the
all-University committee which drew up the recent
master plan for tratfic and parking.
