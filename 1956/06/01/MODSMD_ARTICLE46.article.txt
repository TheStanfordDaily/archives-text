## Thanks for Stanford's Help 
### 
An eventful year has passed, and we discover to our regret that we
have only a few more days with you. You have treated your "foreign
scholars" so well that we do not know how to get across our genuine
gratitude and admiration. 112
We extend our thanks to everyone ... to our hosts: the fraternities,
the eating clubs, the girls' and boys' dorms who received us with spon
taneous hospitality.
To the ASSU Foreign Scholarship Committee, who took motherly
care of us and always stood by with help and advice.
To our professors, whose patience and understanding helped us to
overcome all difficulties.
And let us not forget the anonymous student in the crowd who
always met us with a ready smile and a joke provoked by our foreign
accent. Thanks to you Indians, our hair is cut down to crew-cut mini
mum size, and our vocabulary flourishes with Stanfordian expressions.
The feminine members of our group are completely "outdated," while
the boys have changed radically their views on American women.
We leave with pleasant memories from all the social activities with
our friends on the campus. More important still is the impact of your
first-class educational institution and teachers.
One day we hope to see you in our own country. Our addresses can
always be obtained in the ASSU office.
Till then: Au revoir, Indians.

We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks
to the Administration, the numerous members of the faculty, students
and friends for their kindness and generosity after the fire that greatly
damaged our home and destroyed our belongings last January.
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity was most helpful in giving so much
of their time in recovering important papers and other valuables.
Theta Delta Chi sent a check. The Stanford Library took care of and
salvaged a large number o' books, manuscripts and photostats badly
damaged by smoke and water. The Palo Alto Chapter of the Red Cross
gave us moral support and much material assistance. We also wish to
thank all those anonymous friends, many from the School of Education,
who sent gifts of money and other help.
In our great disaster the sympathy and help of so many people, so
readily and sincerely offered, gave us great courage and solace that
will linger in our hearts long after the scars of the tragedy have dis
appeared and our normal way of life is resumed.

We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks
to the Administration, the numerous members of the faculty, students
and friends for their kindness and generosity after the fire that greatly
damaged our home and destroyed our belongings last January.
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity was most helpful in giving so much
of their time in recovering important papers and other valuables.
Theta Delta Chi sent a check. The Stanford Library took care of and
salvaged a large number o' books, manuscripts and photostats badly
damaged by smoke and water. The Palo Alto Chapter of the Red Cross
gave us moral support and much material assistance. We also wish to
thank all those anonymous friends, many from the School of Education,
who sent gifts of money and other help.
In our great disaster the sympathy and help of so many people, so
readily and sincerely offered, gave us great courage and solace that
will linger in our hearts long after the scars of the tragedy have dis
appeared and our normal way of life is resumed.

An eventful year has passed, and we discover to our regret that we
have only a few more days with you. You have treated your "foreign
scholars" so well that we do not know how to get across our genuine
gratitude and admiration. 112
We extend our thanks to everyone ... to our hosts: the fraternities,
the eating clubs, the girls' and boys' dorms who received us with spon
taneous hospitality.
To the ASSU Foreign Scholarship Committee, who took motherly
care of us and always stood by with help and advice.
To our professors, whose patience and understanding helped us to
overcome all difficulties.
And let us not forget the anonymous student in the crowd who
always met us with a ready smile and a joke provoked by our foreign
accent. Thanks to you Indians, our hair is cut down to crew-cut mini
mum size, and our vocabulary flourishes with Stanfordian expressions.
The feminine members of our group are completely "outdated," while
the boys have changed radically their views on American women.
We leave with pleasant memories from all the social activities with
our friends on the campus. More important still is the impact of your
first-class educational institution and teachers.
One day we hope to see you in our own country. Our addresses can
always be obtained in the ASSU office.
Till then: Au revoir, Indians.
