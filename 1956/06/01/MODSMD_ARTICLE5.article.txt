# Adlai & Estes Trade Punches In Campaigning
## Democrats Attack Each Other in Torrid Fight For California Primary 
### 
Compiled from United Press
Adlai Stevenson accused nis op
ponent for the Democratic presi
dential nomination, Sen. Estes Ke
fauver, of descending "to the mud
slinging level" in then primary
campaign yesterday in Southern
California, where both candidates
ire campaigning.
In Los Angeles, the former gov
ernor of Illinois said Kefauver re
ported to personal attacks despite
his statement prior to the start of
their campaigns that he would en
deavor to keep party unity.
Incessant At lack
"His incessant attack on all
Democrats who support me as
bosses' is certainly a curious way
to improve party unity," Steven
son commented as he campaigned
through Southern California.
"He apparently has decided aft
er five defeats in contested pri
maries that if he cannot win he
will destroy. Just why I don't,
know. In the closing days of the
Florida campaign he also made
lalse charges about my record as
governor of Illinoisâ€”charges he
apparently did not care to make
when we met face to face on a
national telecast from Miami."
Kefauver, speaking from Ingle
wood in an address before a meet
ing of combined service clubs,
questioned the propriety of Ste
venson. who is representing a
firm involved in anti-monopoly
actions as private counsel.
Demo Party Head
He said: "I question the pro
priety of the man who was then
recognized as the head of the
Democratic party taking on the
job of representing one of the
world's largest aggregations of
money and power for the purpose
of trying to deprive two independ
ent companies of having their day
in court."
Kefauver said he referred to the
action by RCA against Zenith Ra
dio Corp. and the Rauland Corp.
charging infringement of patents.
Democratic Nominee
"If Stevenson were again the
nominee of the Democratic party,
this record could deprive the par
ty of an issue vital to the Ameri
can people and their economy,"
the Tennesseean said.
Turning to his own record on
anti-monopoly legislation, he cited
adoption of the Cellar - KefauVer
amendment to the Clayton Anti-
Trust Act and numerous other ac
tions he had taken on behalf of
small businessmen.
