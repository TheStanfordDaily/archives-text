### Bill Nichols 
Stanford athletics, 1955-50 version, is on its last lap, with only the
NCAA track and field championships at Berkeley and the IRA regatta
and Olympic tryouts for the crew still on the schedule.
This past year has been a big one in the sports world for Stanford
and the Coast Conference. Stanford wrapped up a successful football
season with a win over California; Howie Dallmar's eagers were
surprise of the PCC, giving UCLA their two closest games and sweep
ing the Cal series for the second straight year. The tracksters gave
Jack Weiershauser a good-bye present with a win against Cal; the
swimmers won the PCC title with Robin Moore setting a world record.
The baseball team, with Dutch Fehring in his first year of coach
ing, finished in a tie for second in the CIISA race, although the horse
hiders were the only athletic aggregation to lose to Ca!. The Bears
took four in a row from Stanford.
There are many individuals who have contributed much to the
Stanford athletic scene who will not be back next year. Bill Tarr, Chris
Marshall, Ernie Dorn, John Stewart and Joe Long are gone from the
undergraduate scene in football; Ron Wagner, Barry Brown, George
Selleck and Bill Flanders, varsity basketballers, leave, as do trackmen
Jim Saras, Ai Cheney and Bill Flint. Three baseball players Ray
Young, Mickey Il'l/mar* and Bob Evans hang up their spikes for
good. All these i."m many others will be missed.
Confer* nte Suspension
Probably the most important thing to hit the Stanford sports world
this year way the Conference crackdown on under-the-table aid to
athletes. Washington and UCLA have already felt the whip, and

rumor hath it tha; USC ai <: Cal
are on the ragged edge. Wash
ington 100k its punishment with
out yipping, but the "cry baby"
act that UCLA has put on is dis
couraging. One would think that
football is the only thing that
the University of California,
Southern Branch has to offer.
No matter how immature the
screaming of UCLA alums is,
the fact re m a in s that other
schools beside UCLA have been
guilty of the same acts as the
Bruins. Football has become
such a behemoth in the college
world that illegal recruiting and
aid are necessary for a school 1o
hold its head up in academic cir
cles on the sports pages of the
nation.
For the over - all benefit of
Coast schools, it might be better
if the Conference suspended ev
erybody and football was rele
gated to a position of lesser im
portance. Ivy Leaguers have just
as.much fun playing football as
Bruins, Bears or Trojans; their
gate receipts didn't fall off when
they stopped playing "big-time"
football; and they've built better
sportsmen than UCLA.

If the Conference suspends Cal and Stanford, it's not going to kill
the gate for the Big Game. Students will build just as high a bonfire,
and the teams will play just as hard.
How About Stanford?
UCLA's alums who have suddenly switched from their devious
path, and are now loudly crying f"at everybody else is doing it too,
claim they have something on Str jford. Athletic Director A 1 Masters
and Chuck Taylor both have nphatically denied that Stanford is
guilty in any way. Their sta' .ments have a good, solid ground; the
Athletic Department and the 3uek Club are clean. However, there is
another area over which the athletic department has no control and
cannot speak for. Individual Stanford alumni can give a boy an "under
the-table" deal without telling Ihe Athletic Department. This is the
area, UCLA hints, in which Stanford is guilty.
If such a thing were going on. it would be a hard thing to keep
secret especially among the athletic teams themselves. The athletes
themselves feel that Stanford is clean. That is good enough for' this
cornet"; Stanford will not be suspended, placed on probation or fined
any staggering amounts.
The Fast Four Years
Taking a brief nostalgic look at the four years that the Class of
1956 has been here, one sees some great athletic contests. In football
the top game would he the UCLA football game of 1953, where Bob
Garrett passed Stanford to a 21-20 win. Running it a very close second
is the USC game of ine same year. Remember Sad Sam Tsagalakis?
Looking at Stanford's football record, one is struck by an interesting
fact. In the past four years Stanford has played 40 football games.
Their over-all won-lost record for those years has not been spectacu
lar,.but there is only one team that Stanford did not beat at least once
during those four years. Conversely there are only three teams during
the same period that Stanford did not lose to. Stanford lost its only
game with Navy, but won over Ohio State and Michigan in single
games. The other school that Stanford beat is a Coast school. Can you
name it? In case you can't, don't feel badly; it was Santa Clara, in
the opening of the 1952 season.
In basketball, can you remember when Olc Su/.daleff and the Rick
sen twins feuded at the Pavilion? Remember the conference opener
against UCLA in 1955? That is the last conference game that the
Bruins lost. They've run off 27 straight since then.
Chuck Essegian. Jack Shepard, Bob Murphy & Co. gave Stanford
a PCC baseball crown in 1953. They won four out of four from the
perennial champion, USC. including a heart-stopping 11-10 game in
ten innings. The Trojans ied that one, 9-1, going into the eighth inning.
On an individual basis there are two athletes whose doings stand
out above all others over the past four years—George Selleck and
Ray Young. Sel.eck is a born leader and will go far in his profession,
the ministry. His play on the basketball court is indescribable. Young
comes close to having the perfect athletic temperament. He is a keen
competitor, yet he remains calm and keeps his superb sense of humor
even under the most trying circumstances He is also a pretty fair
pitcher. *
So img, and we'll see you in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 1957.

No matter how immature the
screaming of UCLA alums is,
the fact re m a in s that other
schools beside UCLA have been
guilty of the same acts as the
Bruins. Football has become
such a behemoth in the college
world that illegal recruiting and
aid are necessary for a school 1o
hold its head up in academic cir

nation.
For the over - all benefit of
Coast schools, it might be better
if the Conference suspended ev
erybody and football was rele
gated to a position of lesser im
portance. Ivy Leaguers have just
as.much fun playing football as
Bruins, Bears or Trojans; their
gate receipts didn't fall off when
they stopped playing "big-time"
football; and they've built better
sportsmen than UCLA.

If the Conference suspends Cal and Stanford, it's not going to kill
the gate for the Big Game. Students will build just as high a bonfire,
and the teams will play just as hard.
How About Stanford?
UCLA's alums who have suddenly switched from their devious
path, and are now loudly crying f"at everybody else is doing it too,
claim they have something on Str jford. Athletic Director A 1 Masters
and Chuck Taylor both have nphatically denied that Stanford is
guilty in any way. Their sta' .ments have a good, solid ground; the
Athletic Department and the 3uek Club are clean. However, there is
another area over which the athletic department has no control and
cannot speak for. Individual Stanford alumni can give a boy an "under
the-table" deal without telling Ihe Athletic Department. This is the
area, UCLA hints, in which Stanford is guilty.
If such a thing were going on. it would be a hard thing to keep
secret especially among the athletic teams themselves. The athletes
themselves feel that Stanford is clean. That is good enough for' this
cornet"; Stanford will not be suspended, placed on probation or fined
any staggering amounts.
The Fast Four Years
Taking a brief nostalgic look at the four years that the Class of
1956 has been here, one sees some great athletic contests. In football
the top game would he the UCLA football game of 1953, where Bob
Garrett passed Stanford to a 21-20 win. Running it a very close second
is the USC game of ine same year. Remember Sad Sam Tsagalakis?
Looking at Stanford's football record, one is struck by an interesting
fact. In the past four years Stanford has played 40 football games.
Their over-all won-lost record for those years has not been spectacu
lar,.but there is only one team that Stanford did not beat at least once
during those four years. Conversely there are only three teams during
the same period that Stanford did not lose to. Stanford lost its only
game with Navy, but won over Ohio State and Michigan in single
games. The other school that Stanford beat is a Coast school. Can you
name it? In case you can't, don't feel badly; it was Santa Clara, in
the opening of the 1952 season.
In basketball, can you remember when Olc Su/.daleff and the Rick
sen twins feuded at the Pavilion? Remember the conference opener
against UCLA in 1955? That is the last conference game that the
Bruins lost. They've run off 27 straight since then.
Chuck Essegian. Jack Shepard, Bob Murphy & Co. gave Stanford
a PCC baseball crown in 1953. They won four out of four from the
perennial champion, USC. including a heart-stopping 11-10 game in
ten innings. The Trojans ied that one, 9-1, going into the eighth inning.
On an individual basis there are two athletes whose doings stand
out above all others over the past four years—George Selleck and
Ray Young. Sel.eck is a born leader and will go far in his profession,
the ministry. His play on the basketball court is indescribable. Young
comes close to having the perfect athletic temperament. He is a keen
competitor, yet he remains calm and keeps his superb sense of humor
even under the most trying circumstances He is also a pretty fair
pitcher. *

Stanford athletics, 1955-50 version, is on its last lap, with only the

and Olympic tryouts for the crew still on the schedule.
This past year has been a big one in the sports world for Stanford
and the Coast Conference. Stanford wrapped up a successful football
season with a win over California; Howie Dallmar's eagers were
surprise of the PCC, giving UCLA their two closest games and sweep
ing the Cal series for the second straight year. The tracksters gave
Jack Weiershauser a good-bye present with a win against Cal; the
swimmers won the PCC title with Robin Moore setting a world record.
The baseball team, with Dutch Fehring in his first year of coach
ing, finished in a tie for second in the CIISA race, although the horse
hiders were the only athletic aggregation to lose to Ca!. The Bears
took four in a row from Stanford.
There are many individuals who have contributed much to the
Stanford athletic scene who will not be back next year. Bill Tarr, Chris
Marshall, Ernie Dorn, John Stewart and Joe Long are gone from the
undergraduate scene in football; Ron Wagner, Barry Brown, George
Selleck and Bill Flanders, varsity basketballers, leave, as do trackmen
Jim Saras, Ai Cheney and Bill Flint. Three baseball players Ray

guilty in any way. Their sta' .ments have a good, solid ground; the
Athletic Department and the 3uek Club are clean. However, there is
another area over which the athletic department has no control and
cannot speak for. Individual Stanford alumni can give a boy an "under
the-table" deal without telling Ihe Athletic Department. This is the
area, UCLA hints, in which Stanford is guilty.
If such a thing were going on. it would be a hard thing to keep
secret especially among the athletic teams themselves. The athletes
themselves feel that Stanford is clean. That is good enough for' this
cornet"; Stanford will not be suspended, placed on probation or fined
any staggering amounts.
The Fast Four Years
Taking a brief nostalgic look at the four years that the Class of
1956 has been here, one sees some great athletic contests. In football
the top game would he the UCLA football game of 1953, where Bob
Garrett passed Stanford to a 21-20 win. Running it a very close second
is the USC game of ine same year. Remember Sad Sam Tsagalakis?
Looking at Stanford's football record, one is struck by an interesting
fact. In the past four years Stanford has played 40 football games.
Their over-all won-lost record for those years has not been spectacu
lar,.but there is only one team that Stanford did not beat at least once
during those four years. Conversely there are only three teams during
the same period that Stanford did not lose to. Stanford lost its only
game with Navy, but won over Ohio State and Michigan in single
games. The other school that Stanford beat is a Coast school. Can you
name it? In case you can't, don't feel badly; it was Santa Clara, in
the opening of the 1952 season.
In basketball, can you remember when Olc Su/.daleff and the Rick
sen twins feuded at the Pavilion? Remember the conference opener
against UCLA in 1955? That is the last conference game that the
Bruins lost. They've run off 27 straight since then.
Chuck Essegian. Jack Shepard, Bob Murphy & Co. gave Stanford
a PCC baseball crown in 1953. They won four out of four from the
perennial champion, USC. including a heart-stopping 11-10 game in
ten innings. The Trojans ied that one, 9-1, going into the eighth inning.
On an individual basis there are two athletes whose doings stand
out above all others over the past four years—George Selleck and
Ray Young. Sel.eck is a born leader and will go far in his profession,
the ministry. His play on the basketball court is indescribable. Young
comes close to having the perfect athletic temperament. He is a keen
competitor, yet he remains calm and keeps his superb sense of humor
even under the most trying circumstances He is also a pretty fair
pitcher. *

Stanford athletics, 1955-50 version, is on its last lap, with only the
NCAA track and field championships at Berkeley and the IRA regatta
and Olympic tryouts for the crew still on the schedule.
This past year has been a big one in the sports world for Stanford
and the Coast Conference. Stanford wrapped up a successful football
season with a win over California; Howie Dallmar's eagers were
surprise of the PCC, giving UCLA their two closest games and sweep
ing the Cal series for the second straight year. The tracksters gave
Jack Weiershauser a good-bye present with a win against Cal; the
swimmers won the PCC title with Robin Moore setting a world record.
The baseball team, with Dutch Fehring in his first year of coach
ing, finished in a tie for second in the CIISA race, although the horse
hiders were the only athletic aggregation to lose to Ca!. The Bears
took four in a row from Stanford.
There are many individuals who have contributed much to the
Stanford athletic scene who will not be back next year. Bill Tarr, Chris
Marshall, Ernie Dorn, John Stewart and Joe Long are gone from the
undergraduate scene in football; Ron Wagner, Barry Brown, George
Selleck and Bill Flanders, varsity basketballers, leave, as do trackmen
Jim Saras, Ai Cheney and Bill Flint. Three baseball players Ray
Young, Mickey Il'l/mar* and Bob Evans hang up their spikes for
good. All these i."m many others will be missed.
Confer* nte Suspension
Probably the most important thing to hit the Stanford sports world
this year way the Conference crackdown on under-the-table aid to
athletes. Washington and UCLA have already felt the whip, and

rumor hath it tha; USC ai <: Cal
are on the ragged edge. Wash
ington 100k its punishment with
out yipping, but the "cry baby"
act that UCLA has put on is dis
couraging. One would think that
football is the only thing that
the University of California,
Southern Branch has to offer.
No matter how immature the
screaming of UCLA alums is,
the fact re m a in s that other
schools beside UCLA have been
guilty of the same acts as the
Bruins. Football has become
such a behemoth in the college
world that illegal recruiting and
aid are necessary for a school 1o
hold its head up in academic cir
cles on the sports pages of the
nation.
For the over - all benefit of
Coast schools, it might be better
if the Conference suspended ev
erybody and football was rele
gated to a position of lesser im
portance. Ivy Leaguers have just
as.much fun playing football as
Bruins, Bears or Trojans; their
gate receipts didn't fall off when
they stopped playing "big-time"
football; and they've built better
sportsmen than UCLA.

If the Conference suspends Cal and Stanford, it's not going to kill
the gate for the Big Game. Students will build just as high a bonfire,
and the teams will play just as hard.
How About Stanford?
UCLA's alums who have suddenly switched from their devious
path, and are now loudly crying f"at everybody else is doing it too,
claim they have something on Str jford. Athletic Director A 1 Masters
and Chuck Taylor both have nphatically denied that Stanford is
