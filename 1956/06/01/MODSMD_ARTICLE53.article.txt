### Dave Canfield 
In just one more month Stan
ford will have bid good-bye to its
former "iron-man" track man and
its coach for the last 11 years.
Jack Weiershauser, for m e r
world and American record
smasher, holder of two school
marks and coach of athletes like
Dud Held, Otis Chandler and Dob
Mathifis is retiring to enter pri
vate business.
The swarthy, smiling Weicrs
hauser's Farm career dates back
20 years to 1936.
In that year, he transferred
from Modesto Junior College and
turned out for track under Coach
Dink Templeton.
Weiershauser was just another
cog i; Stanford's 1936 victory ma
chine that ranked fourth in the
NCAA. But* he did score the first
major triumph'of his Farm career,
winning the 440 against UCLA. He
also anchored the second best mile
relay team in the nation.
Great Improvement
"1-Ie wasn't the greatest athlete
I ever coached," said Templeton,
now a sportscaster and a Palo Alto
Times columnist. "But he im
proved more in two years than
any oiher athlete I ever coached."
Just one spring aftei his rather
ordinary 1936 showing, Weiers
hauser blommed into a full-fledg
ed star. He racked up two school
records that still stand, the 22) in
20.7 and the low hurdles in 23.2.
In the AAIJ Meet he flashed 200
meters around one turn in a blind
ing 20.9. This time stood as the
world record until 1918, when
USC's Mel Patton shaved it to
20.7. (
Sprint Relay
Weiershauser also blazed the
third 440 as the mile relay team
clicked off a 3:12.3 clocking. This
achievement is the fastest mile
relay time in Stanford history. It
once stood as the world mark.
Ano.ther worl d standard was
shattered the same year by Stan
ford's itchy-toed 800-meter <>nd
880-yard relay team. With Weiers
hauser as anchcyj, man, the Card
four came home in 1:25 flat.

(Stanford with a greater heart or
more of the real Stanford spirit
I than my old iron man, Jack Wei

would have bumped his head at a

Returns as ( oach
After graduating in 1937, Wei
ershauser returned to the Farm
in 1946 to lead an aggregate that
I could have conservatively been
described as "green."
But within two years Weiers
hauser built the Indians up to the
i point wjiere they were again
among the best in the nation.
Placing eighth in the NCAA in;
1948, third in 1949, second in 1950,
fourth in 1952, third in 1953 and
eighth in 1954, the Cards were

ate, he heaved the spear a tremen- 1

dous 263-10 for the world record.
Both Templet on ana Athletic-
News Service Director Don Lie
bendorfer expressed regret about
Weicrshauser's retirement.
"Stanford," Templeton said, "is
losing one of the finest track and
field coaches in the business. It is
a shame he got such poor support
lrom the alumni, but, being a true
Stanford man himself, he has
gone all out to give every possible
assistance to his successor, Pay
ton Jordan. The alumni have been
on a sit-down strike against send
ing any athletes for three years.
"But with all-around support,
spearheaded by the old ironman,
I look for Jordan to fulfill Jack's
greatest wishes in the future."
Liebendorfer declared: "As al

"1-Ie wasn't the greatest athlete
I ever coached," said Templeton,

proved more in two years than
any oiher athlete I ever coached."
Just one spring aftei his rather
ordinary 1936 showing, Weiers
hauser blommed into a full-fledg

records that still stand, the 22) in
20.7 and the low hurdles in 23.2.
In the AAIJ Meet he flashed 200
meters around one turn in a blind
