# Provost Terman Compares Russ, U.S. Engineer Baits
## 
### 
Russia is alleviating its short
age of trained engineers by using
"the good old capitalistic free en
terprise technique of making the
carrot for engineers larger and
juicier," the dean of Stanford's
School of Engineering yesterday
told a conference of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers
in San Francisco.
Dr. Frederick E. Terman, who is
also the University's provost, said
"We are in competition with Rus
sians in producing engineers, and
this could easily become a life or
death matter.
"They seem to be solving the
problem better than we are. To
increase the supply they have
raised the price of engineers."
He cited comparative monthly
pay scales of workers in the
USSR: unskilled, 600 rubles;
skilled, 1,000 rubles; beginning
graduate engineers, 2,000 rubles;
manager oi a large department
store, 3,000 rubles; senior research
engineer, 10,000-30,000 rubles.
In the U.S. wage rates for young
engineers have "improved a lot
since 1930 and 1940," Dr. Terman
said. But when their income is
compared with hourly rates for
coal miners, auto workers, long
shoremen and other American
workers, engineers "aren't doing
much more than holding their
own.
"The paradox is that the Rus
sians, who profess opposition to
our free enterprise principles, are
here actually practicing them with
extremely successful results. They
are producing more than 50,000
engineers a year, plus correspond
ingly large numbers of physicists
and other scientists.
"Last year we produced 22,000
bachelors of science. This is far
short of our requirements. In
proportion to total population,
Russia is out-producing us nearly
two to one."
Dr. Terman expressed little
hope for improvement through
current U.S. efforts.
He said the "whoop it up for
engineering" approach — propa
gandizing high school students,
parents, and counselors about the
great opportunities in science and
engineering—has made little of
any headway. U.S. Office of Ed
ucation statistics show the pro
portion of entering college fresh
men who chose engineering in
creased from 16 per cent in 1952
to only 16.9 per cent in 1955.
"In terms of the law of supply
and demand," Dr. Terman sug
gested, "what we call a shortage
of engineers could be described
as a depressed wage scale for en
gineers. And a substantial in
crease in engineers' wages exert
corrective influences.
"Because engineers and scien
tists would be more expensive, em
ployers would use them more
carefully than they do now. Be
cause they would use them
carefully, wo would not need as
many. And because there would
be greater rewards for those who
succeed, a larger supply would de
velop.
"The net result would be that
supply and demand would be
brought into equilibrium."

In the U.S. wage rates for young
engineers have "improved a lot
since 1930 and 1940," Dr. Terman
said. But when their income is
compared with hourly rates for
coal miners, auto workers, long
shoremen and other American
workers, engineers "aren't doing
much more than holding their
own.
"The paradox is that the Rus
sians, who profess opposition to
our free enterprise principles, are
here actually practicing them with
extremely successful results. They
are producing more than 50,000
engineers a year, plus correspond
ingly large numbers of physicists
and other scientists.
"Last year we produced 22,000
bachelors of science. This is far
short of our requirements. In
proportion to total population,
Russia is out-producing us nearly
two to one."
Dr. Terman expressed little
hope for improvement through
current U.S. efforts.
He said the "whoop it up for
engineering" approach — propa
gandizing high school students,
parents, and counselors about the
great opportunities in science and
engineering—has made little of
any headway. U.S. Office of Ed
ucation statistics show the pro
portion of entering college fresh
men who chose engineering in
creased from 16 per cent in 1952
to only 16.9 per cent in 1955.
"In terms of the law of supply
and demand," Dr. Terman sug
gested, "what we call a shortage
of engineers could be described
as a depressed wage scale for en
gineers. And a substantial in
crease in engineers' wages exert
corrective influences.
"Because engineers and scien
tists would be more expensive, em
ployers would use them more
carefully than they do now. Be
cause they would use them
carefully, wo would not need as
many. And because there would
be greater rewards for those who
succeed, a larger supply would de
velop.
"The net result would be that
supply and demand would be
brought into equilibrium."
Russia is alleviating its short
age of trained engineers by using
"the good old capitalistic free en
terprise technique of making the
carrot for engineers larger and
juicier," the dean of Stanford's
School of Engineering yesterday
told a conference of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers
in San Francisco.
Dr. Frederick E. Terman, who is
also the University's provost, said
"We are in competition with Rus
sians in producing engineers, and
this could easily become a life or
death matter.
"They seem to be solving the
problem better than we are. To
increase the supply they have
raised the price of engineers."
He cited comparative monthly
pay scales of workers in the
USSR: unskilled, 600 rubles;
skilled, 1,000 rubles; beginning
graduate engineers, 2,000 rubles;
manager oi a large department
store, 3,000 rubles; senior research
engineer, 10,000-30,000 rubles.
