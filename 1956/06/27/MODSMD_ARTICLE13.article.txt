# Professor Cowley Offers New Panty Raid Approach
## 
### 
"Panty raids are a blessing in disguise" from a historical viewpoint,
Stanford Professor W. H. Cowley told an assemblage of deans from
150 colleges and universities gathered at Stanford's School of Edu
cation Thursday.
The deans attended a four-day meeting of the National Associa
tion of Student Personnel Administrators.
"Compared with lawlessness of pre-Civil War college students,"
said Dr. Cowley, "today's panty raids seem so mild that the historian
of college life is tempted to dismiss them as inconsequential."

He cited early 19th Century
Princeton students who dynamited
Nassau Hall three times, and Yale
students who stabbed to death at
least one New Haven fireman dur
ing their annual spring "hose
riots."
But the most famous, he said,
was the Oxford outbreak of 1355,
which lasted more than a week
and cost the lives of over 50 stu
dents and townsmen.
The "gory atrocities" of earlier
periods were finally stopped, Dr.
Cowley thinks, by six develop
ments—three initiated by college
administrators, and three that
emerged with changing times.
The first three included revision
of the college calendar so tha* va
cations would fall at seasons when
students had been prone to "hell
raising," the abandonment of dor
mitories, and the help given stu
dents in organizing self-govern
ment.
"Meanwhile three powerful so
cial developments in American
life forced the colleges to change
spectacularly against the wishes
of the great majority of trustees,
presidents, and professors. These
were coeducation, organized ath
letics, and establishment of cur
riculums for students whom the
historic universities had never be
fore served — engineers, dentists,
farmers, scientists, and business
men.
"Deans of students, however,
can't be complacent and must deal
with panty raids wisely if they oc
cur and prevent them if they can.
He who knows the historical con
tinuum of a problem is thereby
equipped to deal with the present
and to plan for the future."
The Stanford professor pro
posed that the deans raise funds
to investigate panty raids thor
oughly, and employ a historian
and a sociologist to do the job.
"The former would review the
past; the latter would explore the
present; and both would propose
steps to be taken now and also
identify some of the possible de
velopments of the future.
"Ignore it at your peril," he
warned the group. "Should an
other serious depression strike,
you won't be dealing with coed
panties but with the banners of
political agitators from both the
left and the right. Because today
college campuses bring together
such a large proportion of the
youth of the nation, agitators
would descend upon them. Stu
dents, believing their prospects to
be blighted, would flock to their
banners and do their bidding."
Dr. Cowley also proposed that
the student personnel administra
tors establish a central agency to
serve their combined needs. It
would publish a newletter, give
advice on specific problems when
needed, and act as "a kind of gen
eral staff" for policy-making in
college student personnel work.
