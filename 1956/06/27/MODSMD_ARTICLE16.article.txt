# Japanese Swords At Museum
## 
### 
The Japanese have never re
garded the sword as a mere
weapon, and from the earliest
times have lavished all the skill
and artistry at their command
upon its production.
A group of these Japanese
swords went on display at the
Stanford Museum on June 10. The
collection belongs to the Northern
California Japanese Sword Club,
organized less than a year ago for
the appreciation and preservation
of the fine art of Japanese swords
and objects of art.
Members of the armed forces
returning from Japan have great
ly increased the number of Japa
nese swords and their furnishings
in this country. An estimated
quarter of a million Japanese
swords of varied values are in the
United States at the present time.
There are about 30 swords and
50 tsuba, the guard for the sword,
on display at the Museum. The
exhibit will continue for a month.
The Stanford Museum is open
daily from 1 to 5 p.m. Admission
charge is 25 cents.
