# Summer Weekly Needs Talent
## 
### 
Interest is the only prerequi
site for those wanting to work
on the Stanford Summer Week
ly during the quarter.
The Weekly is critically short
of personnel and can utilize all
volunteers. Experience is not
necessary.
Both men and women, grad
uates and undergraduates, are
invited to join the staff. Re
porters and circulation man
agers are especially needed and
assignments can usually be
tailored to fit the activities and
time available of the person
concerned.
Everyone interested in a po
sition on the Weekly staff is
urged to leave his name and
phone number with Mrs. Baker,
secretary of the Communica
tions and Journalism Depart
ment, over the Stanford Press.
