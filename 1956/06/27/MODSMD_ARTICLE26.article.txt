# Kellogg Funds For Leadership Given Ed School
## 
### 
Stanford University has re
ceived a grant of $225,000 from
the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to
finance a four-year program of
leadership development in public
school administration, President
Wallace Sterling has announced.
The aim of the program will be
to develop professional standards
for high-level general school ad
ministrators, usually superintend
ents, according to William R.
Odell, Stanford professor of edu
cation who is directing the proj
ect.
Part of the funds will be used
for 20 fellowships at Stanford,
averaging $3000 each a year. The
fellows will be recruited among
school employees throughout the
United States who have pro
gressed from teaching to prin
cipalships and are prospects for
central administration work, Dr.
Odell said.
The project will help western
school systems select promising
administrators by means of tests
and consultations and will follow
the development of those selected.
Screening methods were devel
oped and refined at Stanford un
der the Cooperative Program in
Educational Administration, an
other Kellogg-sponsored project.
Research activities and a series
of major conferences are also con
templated, Dr. Odell said. Two
full-time assistants to the director
and clerical help will be provided
under the grant.
"The professional aspects of
school administration will be em
phasized," Dr. Odell stated. "To
day's superintendent must be
trained beyond the techniques of
education. He must be able to
function as part of the total com
munity, dealing with planning
commissions, health councils,
recreation agencies, and other
groups.
"He must be able to develop
educational policies that are con
sistent with generally accepted
social and psychological goals."
To meet these broad require
ments, the Stanford project will
draw not only on the resources
of the School of Education but
also on other of the University's
schools and departments in the
behavioral sciences, Dr. Odell said.
This will be facilitated by an all-
University committee.
Under the new Kellogg grant,
Stanford will continue with activi
ties undertaken in the CPEA pro
gram for the Pacific Southwest
area, covering California, Nevada,
Wyoming, Utah, and Arizona. This
program, also headed by Dr. Odell,
was set up in 1951 by the founda
tion's five-year grant of $268,000
to Stanford.
Dr. Odell joined the Stanford
faculty in 1949 after more than 20
years experience in teaching and
administration. He was formerly
superintendent of schools in Oak
land and has taught at Columbia
University, where he took his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees.
