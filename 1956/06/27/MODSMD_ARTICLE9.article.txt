Summer Quarter at Stanford
traditionally means a combina
tion of study and play in a warm,
friendly atmosphere. Activities
have been planned with the wide
variety of interests present in
mind. The cooperation and sup
port of freshmen, grad students,
undergrads, faculty, and every
one here is hoped for to insure the
success of all our functions. As
you take part, meet people, and
live the Fundamental Standard,

ART GODI
ASSU President—Summer '56

Summer, it seems to me, height
ens the advantages of Stanford.
It brings together serious stu
dents and a stimulating faculty in
a highly congenial atmosphere of
common interest.
The traditionally informal pat
tern of life at Stanford, enhanced
by an incomparable summer cli
mate, fits easily with any pro
gram for extracurricular enjoy
ment.
You are welcome here and I look
forward to meeting many of you
personally.
