# Richard Dyer-Bennet Will Sing Folk Songs Here
## 
### 
Richard Dyer-Bennet, tenor and guitarist, whose unusual repertoire
of more than 600 folk and art songs has won glowing critical tribute,
will appear in a special concert at Stanford University on July 14.
An accomplished linguist, Dyer-Bennet does not rely exclusively on
the songs of America and the British Isles. Rivalling the true tiouba
dor of medieval times, he is poet, composer, singer and instrumental
ist in one.

Dyer-Bennet's melodies range
from the victoiy march sung by
conquering English soldiers after
the battle of Agincourt to the
"Waltzing Matilda" sung by the
Australian troops in World War
11.
Born in England, but raised and
educated in California, Dyer-Ben
net has become well - known
throughout the United States
through both his personal appt t
ances and his records. Fifteen al
bums of his recordings have been
released nationally.
Tickets for the Stanford con
cert, which he will present in Me
morial Hall, are on sale for $1.50
at the Peninsula Box Office and
at the Memorial Hall box office.
The unique artist, discovered by
S. Hurok, will make his twelfth
coast-to-coast tour late in the fall
under the direction of the National
Artists Corporation. His concert
this month has been arranged by
the Stanford Committee on Public
Exercises.
