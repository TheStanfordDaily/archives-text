Seven hundred pounds of ice

The feed will be held on the
lawn of the Women's Gym be
tween 2 and 5 p.m. Admission will
be free according to Hall Seely,
vice-president of the ASSU, the

them iced for three days preceding
the feed," Seely said.

Softball. The regular Saturday
rules for the use of the pool will
be in effect.
