# Dignitaries Pay Visits to Hoover Library
## 
### 
While most of the Stanford cam
pus was deserted during the break
between quarters, Hoover Library
was, as usual, thronged with for
eign dignitaries. Most prominent
among the visitors was U Win,
newly appointed Burmese ambas
sador, who was passing through
the area with his family on his
way to Washington.
Hubert Ponter, a leading Afri
can manufacturer, spent several
days at Stanford. Mr. Ponter is
Industrial Representative on the
Joint National Council, Central
African Federation, an organiza
tion paving the way for a federal
union of the British territories in
Africa. He is also President of
the Federation of Rhodesian In
dustries, a body similar to the
National Association of Manufac
turers in this country. Mr. Ponter
is in the United States to study
labor relations, especially in situa
tions which involve Negroes.
Other visitors to the library in
cluded two Japanese professors,
Isao Kikuchi of Kyushu Univer
sity and Masao Onoe of Kobe Uni
versity. Professor Onoe is an ex
pert on Soviet Russia. Dr. Helmut
Hartmann, feature editor of the
"Rheinsiche Post," Germany's
fourth largest newspaper, also
spent some time visiting the li
brary.
The Hoover Library's great at
traction lies in the fact that it
contains one of the world's great
est collection of material on con
temporary international relations.
Established after the First World
War the library was dedicated to
collecting records of war and revo
lution, that they might be studied
and aid man in finding the elusive
peace.
