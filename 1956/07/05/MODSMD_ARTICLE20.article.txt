# Campus Geography and Excavations Explained by Inquiring Student
## 
### Bob Freeman 
One of the first things given to a newcomer to Stanford is a map
of the campus that is completely indecipherable. The only point on
the campus from which said map can be read intelligently is from the
bell tower atop Hoover Library. This incomparable vantage point is
not recommended for ready reference, but it is an excellent place
from which to begin one's indoctrination into the intricacies of Stan
ford geography.
Being forearmed witli this bit of intelligence I immediately headed
for the tower upon my arrival here. It is surprisingly simple to find
the tower, even for a neophyte, for it is the only building on the cam-

pus distinguished by an elevator.
As 1 entered the memorial 1 was
immediately set upon by two
charming native guides dressed in
the colorful costumes of their i
tribe. (The Moccasin tribe, that
is.) These guides filled me in on j
some of the local color as we as
cended the giddy heights. It
seems, according to them, and 1
consider the source to be unim
peachable, that the tower was
built on the exact site where their
great chief, Cumquot, was first
shod with Christian footwear.
(His heathen moccasins may be
seen on display in the basement 1
of the museum, Indian relics di-1
vision.) The reason for the con
fusing layout of the campus was
explained to me in the following
amazing story.
It seems that the last request of
Chief Cumquot was that he be
allowed to perform the forbidden
heathen rite of "the casting of
the prune pits." The chief's last
wisli was summarily refused by
the authorities due to the inflam
matory nature of the rite. To cir
cumvent this refusal the chief was
forced to use the old Indian rope
trick in order to reach the top of
the tower. The sacred rope was
provided by the last of his faith
ful braves. Yea, the last of the
Moccasins. (This nefarious rope
may also be seen in the basement
of the museum, cordage division,
where it is vigilantly guarded so
as to be sure that it will not rise
again.)
Meanwhile, back at the top of
the tower, the old chief com
menced to call upon his heathen
gods to avenge his people. So say
ing, he thrust his bony brown hand
into the sacred Pit-Pot and deliv
ered the contents thereof to the
caprices of the four winds.
The gods heard the old chief's
last wish. They did avenge his
people, for where each pit landed
there eventually grew a stately
building later to be wearily
searched for by bewildered stu
dents and visitors to our beloved
campus.
Some of these pits remained dor
mant for many years. Only re
cently have they divulged their
ancient burrowing places. One
came to light recently on the
weed-choked site adjacent to the
post office where the new music
building is rapidly taking form.
The post office (circa 1900) will
soon be replaced by a new build
ing located across the street from
the present relic. The site of the

old building will lie redeveloped
as part of the Student Activities
Center.
Another pit sprouted south of
the post office on the sloping field
below Tne Knoll near Lake Lagu
nita. Mere can be seen the almost
completed 7-unit Florence Moore
Hall which will house 350 under
graduate women.
Another prune pit that lies
quickening in the fertile Stanford
soil will soon burst forth in the
form of the Tresidder Memorial
Union. Among facilities the Union
is expected to provide are student
body offices, recreation areas, a
fountain, and a ballroom which
may be converted for receptions
and banquets.
The impressive ditch that is be
ing dug in an anti-intellectual ef
fort to isolate the bookstore is
supposedly going to lie used to
entomb a sewer-pipe. But, actu
ally, the workmen engaged in this
effort are engineers in disguise
who are frantically searching for
prune pits. They will not tolerate
the construction of any new build
ing at their corner. Farsighted,
those chaps.
