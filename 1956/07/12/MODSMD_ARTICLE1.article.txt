# Goff, Stone Will Aid Albertson On Men's Council
## 
### 
Two of the three members of
the Summer Men's Council have
turned out to be ineligible for
membership, Art Godi, ASSU
president, has announced.
Not Formally Registered
A 1 Lazarus and Ed Neighbor,
along with Jim Albertson, were
appointed during spring quarter
to serve on the council this sum
mer. Lazarus and Neighbor are
regular Stanford students who did
not formally register for the sum
mer quarter though they are
working on advanced degrees in
Physics. The ASSU Constitution
specifically states that all offi
cers must be formally registered
during the quarters in which they
are holding office.
To Be Advisory Members
The ASSU Legislature has
unanimously appointed Chuck
Goff and Fred Stone, both gradu
ate students, to fill the two vacan
cies. Lazarus and Neighbor were
voted in as advisory members to
aid Goff, Stone, and Albertson on
the council.
"We are fortunate to have five
such competent men to serve on
Men's Council," Art Godi stated,
"but we hope that there won't be
any violations coming before
them."
Goff is a former member of the
Summer Men's Council and was
also chairman of Fundamental
Standard Committee. Stone has
been a member of Judicial Coun
cil and of his class Excom.
