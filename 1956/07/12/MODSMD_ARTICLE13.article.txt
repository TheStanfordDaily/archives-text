## 
### BOB FREEMAN 
One of the more frenetic courses
offered at Stanford this summer
car ries the title of the Radio Tele
vision Institute. The guiding light
in this project is Mr. George Wil
ley, who has been in charge of the
Institute for several years. The
nerve center for Mr. Willey's ac
tivities is located in the rear of
Memorial Hall. His office may be
found between Model-Set Con
struction and Paint Mixing. From
this Bohemian vantage point Mr.
Willey guides his 75 fledgling ac
tors. directors, et al. In addition
to these 75 there is a special course
for 12 advanced students in pur
suit of their Masters degree in
Speech and Drama.
Outstanding Lecturers
Mr. Willey is assisted by a staff
of 15 composed of regular faculty
members and outstanding lectur
ers who are active in the field of
radio and television.
The radio work of the Institute
is presented in cooperation with
KNBC, San Francisco, owned and
operated by the National Broad
casting Company; the television
work with KPIX, a Westinghouse
station, the Columbia Broadcast
ing System affiliate in San Fran
cisco. On Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays the classes meet in
the radio and television studios in
San Francisco; on Tuesdays and
Thursdays the classes are held on
the Stanford campus.
Work Without Pay
The Institute's Masters degree
program is especially interesting
because when a student has com
pleted his academic requirements
for the degree he spends a final
quarter as an intern in a radio or
television station. He does this
work without academic credit and
without pay, but he will therefore
get practical experience in the in
dustry by moving from depart
ment to department in a cooperat
ing station. Tne following broad
casters have joined with the
Speech and Drama Department in
this program: KCBS of the Colum
bia Broadcasting System; KGO
and KGO-TV of the American
Broadcasting Company; KNBC of
the National Broadcasting Com
pany; KPIX, the Westinghouse
station; KQED, San Francisco's
educational television station; and
television station KRON, the NBC
television affiliate; as well as lo
cal independent radio stations.
The Institute will take over our
own KZSU for two weeks starting
July 30 to put on a special series
of programs.
Early in August the Institute
will present a television play over
KPIX, live from San Francisco.
Two of the outstanding guest
speakers who will address the
members of the Institute shortly
will be Walt Disney's director of
educational films, and the direc
tor of the Dinah Shore show. In
the trade this is commonly called
closed-circuit lecturing.

car ries the title of the Radio Tele
vision Institute. The guiding light
in this project is Mr. George Wil
ley, who has been in charge of the
Institute for several years. The
nerve center for Mr. Willey's ac

Mr. Willey is assisted by a staff
of 15 composed of regular faculty
members and outstanding lectur
ers who are active in the field of
radio and television.
The radio work of the Institute
is presented in cooperation with
KNBC, San Francisco, owned and
operated by the National Broad
casting Company; the television
work with KPIX, a Westinghouse
station, the Columbia Broadcast
ing System affiliate in San Fran
cisco. On Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays the classes meet in
the radio and television studios in
San Francisco; on Tuesdays and
Thursdays the classes are held on

Work Without Pay
The Institute's Masters degree
program is especially interesting
because when a student has com
pleted his academic requirements
for the degree he spends a final
quarter as an intern in a radio or
television station. He does this
work without academic credit and
without pay, but he will therefore
get practical experience in the in
dustry by moving from depart
ment to department in a cooperat
ing station. Tne following broad
casters have joined with the
Speech and Drama Department in
this program: KCBS of the Colum
bia Broadcasting System; KGO
and KGO-TV of the American
Broadcasting Company; KNBC of
the National Broadcasting Com
pany; KPIX, the Westinghouse
station; KQED, San Francisco's
educational television station; and
television station KRON, the NBC
television affiliate; as well as lo
cal independent radio stations.
The Institute will take over our
own KZSU for two weeks starting
July 30 to put on a special series
of programs.
Early in August the Institute
will present a television play over
KPIX, live from San Francisco.
Two of the outstanding guest
speakers who will address the
