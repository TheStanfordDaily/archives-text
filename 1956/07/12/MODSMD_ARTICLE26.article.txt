# Hofstadter Describes Latest Stanford Nuclear Experiments
## 
### 
Recent electron scattering ex
periments at Stanford University,
which have revealed more facts
about the make-up of the atomic
nucleus than scientists had ever
known, are described by Physicist
Robert Hofstadter in the July is
sue of Scientific American maga
zine.
The research group under Pro
fessor Hofstadter employed high
energy electrons from the Univer
sity's 220-foot Mark 111 linear ac
celerator (the world's biggest) to
probe the heart of the atom. They
measured the results with ex
treme accuracy by means of a spe
cially constructed 55-ton magnetic
spectrometer.
Discover Fact About Nuclei
They discovered that the heavier
nuclei (containing from 40 to 238
nucleonic particles) all have a
"skin" of the same thickness —2.4
fermis, in the terminology of phys
ics. The size of the dense inner
core varies with the mass of the
nucleus.
From this work the Hofstadter
group was able to formulate
simple laws for determining the
size of both heavy and light (less
than 40 nucleons) nuclei.
Measures Smallest Nucleus
In further experiments they
measured the smallest nucleus—
that of hydrogen, made up of a
single proton. They found that
most of the proton is contained
within a radius of one fermi, and
all of it within a 1.4 fermi radius.
They are now refining their pro
ton observations and making ne«'
examinations of deuterons and
alpha particles.
"Deuteron observations may
also give some information about
the distribution of the neutron's
magnetic field," Dr. Hofstadter
writes. "It may soon be possible
to tell whether the neutron and
the proton are, as current the
ory says, alike except for their
charge."
