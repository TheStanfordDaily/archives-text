# Grademanship Arts Explained
## 
### BOB FREEMAN 
First of all, select a subject in
which you are not especially in
terested, otherwise the following
suggestions will only be of sec
ondary importance.
The first rule of grademanship
is to sit in the first row, because
many professors are notoriously
nearsighted. Indeed, many of
them are totally unaware of thÂ«:
fact that there is anyone in the
room beyond the first three rows
of seats.
Once having achieved this subtle
tactical advantage one should as
sume a businesslike attitude by
conforming to the rules of good
posture, and by having an ade
quate supply of unblemished pa
per and well-sharpened pencils.
Pencils are important, for by us
ing them the professor will as
sume that you will type your notes
when you return to your room.
This always makes a good impres
sion.
Be Ready
Upon the ringing of the bell one
should poise one's pencil hover
ingly above one's paper in happy
anticipation of transcribing the
information, in toto, which the pro
fessor will immediately start
transmitting.
Be busy. Use reams of paper
and cords of pencils in your fran
tic effort to catch each and every
syllable of the lecture. Occasion
ally glance at your neighbor's pa
per to see if you missed anything,
then get back to work.
Ask at least one intelligent ques
tion during each period. This is
especially effective toward the end
of the hour when the professor
may be running short of material.
If you can by some lucky stroke
be able to connect the question
with his wartime experiences you
will have achieved the ultimate in
gradesmanship.
Read His Works
Read everything that the pro
fessor has ever had published.
Qupte at length from such mate
rial in any papers required in his
course.
Don't stare out the window,
chew betel-nut, yawn, look at your
watch, or smoke cigars during the
fifty-minute hour. And above all
DON'T ARGUE, you fool you.
At the conclusion of the period
approach the podium and ask the
professor to please explain a point
that is presently beyond your poor
powers of comprehension. But
never, no never, intimate that you
did not understand him because
he did not explain it very well.
Rather, suggest that your powers
of understanding are not quite the
equivalent of his, but don't give
him the impression that you are,
in fact, a dolt. This is perhaps the
most difficult technique to mas
ter in the fine art of grademan
ship.
Let Him Know You
Make a point of seeing the pro
fessor outside of class, but don't
make a pest of yourself. Simply
insure the fact that he will recog
nize you as a person worthy of
reward, rather than just a name,
when he is perusing his grade
book at the end of the quarter.
If you follow these suggestions
to the letter I guarantee that the
professor will view you in a very
favorable light come grade time.
But don't spread this information
around, or the jig will be up. and
I shall have to devise new strata
gems for the fine art of grade
manship.
