# School Planning Institute Will Plug Closed Circuit TV
## 
### 
Closed circuit television as an instrument for broadening the hori
zon of the classroom—rather than simply relaying to many points
a picture of a teacher at a desk or a blackboard—will be explored at
the sixth annual School Planning Institute at Stanford University.
The Institute, scheduled for July 30-August 3, will also stress school
construction, financial and legal problems of school building, and the
physical environment of the classroom.
Professor James D. MacConnell of the Stanford School of Educa
tion, director of the Institute, expects 400 administrators, teachers,
school board members, architects, and industrial representatives
from the western and midwestern states to attend.

Television techniques will be
shown by Richard B. Lewis,
Jose State College professor. Cam
eras will be trained on simulated
teaching situations on the stage
of the auditorium. Monitors scat
tered in the seating area will en
able those attending to see both
the original demonstration and
the reproduced version.
Enlarge Classroom Experience
The TV camera's ability to en
large classroom experience by be
ing a silent observer will be dem
onstrated.
Typical of this use would b(
piping to a classroom of an inter
view between a psychologist and
a subject in a distant room or the
viewing by a in education
of the normal activity in an ele
mentary schoolroom.
The possibilities of television
bringing to a group of students
a close-up view of a detailed sci
eroe demonstration arc almost un
limited, Professor Lewis feels.
Forty-nine leading architects,
school officials, and representa
tives of school equipment manu
facturers will conduct sessions.
Among them will be representa
tives from the Division of School
Planning of the California State
Department of Education; Mrs.
Russell Scott of Salinas, president
of the California Congress of Par
ents and Teachers; Harold Spears,
superintendent of San Francisco
schools; and Mrs. Elizabeth Hud
son of Long Beach, president of
the California School Boards As
sociation.
Exhibit for Ed School
The Stanford School Planning
Laboratory, where the newest ma
terials for school construction are
demonstrated, will be open. It will
be augmented by special equip
ment exhibits and a show of archi
tectural models and plans in the
lobby of the School of Education.
Thp conference will open at 112)
a.m. Monday, July 30, in the School
of Education lobby. All interested
persons are welcome to attend.
The fee is $10 for the week or $2
a day.and advance registration is

onstrated.
Typical of this use would b(
piping to a classroom of an inter
view between a psychologist and
a subject in a distant room or the
viewing by a in education
of the normal activity in an ele
mentary schoolroom.
The possibilities of television
bringing to a group of students
a close-up view of a detailed sci
eroe demonstration arc almost un
limited, Professor Lewis feels.
Forty-nine leading architects,
school officials, and representa
tives of school equipment manu
facturers will conduct sessions.
Among them will be representa
tives from the Division of School
Planning of the California State
Department of Education; Mrs.
Russell Scott of Salinas, president
of the California Congress of Par
ents and Teachers; Harold Spears,
superintendent of San Francisco
schools; and Mrs. Elizabeth Hud
son of Long Beach, president of
the California School Boards As
sociation.

a day.and advance registration is

The California School Boards
Association and the Stanford
School of Education are co-spon

Closed circuit television as an instrument for broadening the hori
zon of the classroom—rather than simply relaying to many points
a picture of a teacher at a desk or a blackboard—will be explored at
the sixth annual School Planning Institute at Stanford University.
The Institute, scheduled for July 30-August 3, will also stress school
construction, financial and legal problems of school building, and the
physical environment of the classroom.
Professor James D. MacConnell of the Stanford School of Educa
tion, director of the Institute, expects 400 administrators, teachers,
school board members, architects, and industrial representatives
from the western and midwestern states to attend.

Television techniques will be
shown by Richard B. Lewis,
Jose State College professor. Cam
eras will be trained on simulated
teaching situations on the stage
of the auditorium. Monitors scat
tered in the seating area will en
able those attending to see both
the original demonstration and
the reproduced version.
