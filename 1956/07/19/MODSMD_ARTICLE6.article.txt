# Aline MacMahon, Artist-In-Residence, Tells Of Her Life
## 
### BOB FREEMAN 
"The part's the thing," says Miss Aline MacMahon our Artist-in-
Residence for the summer quarter. "The vehicle, whether it be the
stage, the movies, or television, is of a secondary nature. I enjoy
working in all three mediums, but of course the Stanford Summer
Theatre is my very favorite."
And Miss MacMahon is our very favorite actress since this is her
fourth visit to our campus as an Artist-in-ReMdence. Her last appear
ance here was three summers ago when she played the leading role in
The Madwoman of Chaillot, which incidentally is her favorite role.
(We certainly do play favorites in this column.)

For many years it has been the
policy of the Department of
Speech and Drama to invite dis
tinguished actors from the profes
sional theatre to participate in our
productions in order to provide
the student actors with the oppor
tunity and experience of working
with mature and established art
ists. Previously Miss MacMahon
played here in The Rivals, L'Arle
sienne, and My Indian Family.
Miss MacMahon and her husband,
Clarence Stein, the famous archi
tect, are residing in the guest
room of Stern Hall.
This summer our distinguished
actress is playing the role of
Madame Alexandra in Mademois
elle Colombe, Jean Anouilh's sa
tiric comedy of life in the theatre
which is being presented this week
and next in the Little Theatre.
Since Miss MacMahon was last
at Stanford she has played for a
season in the New York produc
tion of The Confidential Clerk
and in A Day By the Sea which
played a three week engagement
last fall at the Curran Theatre
before beginning its New York
engagement.
Her film career began in 1931
when she signed a five year con
tract with Warner Brothers. Her
first film was Five Star Final.
Since then she has appeared in
many movies, among them The
Eddie Cantor Story and Dragon
Seed.
Upon graduating from Barnard
College Miss MacMahon made her
first appearance on the New York
stage at the Neighborhood Play
house. This appearance was made
possible through the efforts of
Alice and Irene Lewisohn, es
teemed patrons of the arts, who
first recognized her talents. Mr.
Lee Shubert was the next figure
of importance to recognize her
talent. He made it possible for her
to appear in the 1925 version of
Artists and Models in Paris. Next
came Eugene O'Neill, who cast
her in the part of Ruth Atkins
in the first production of Beyond
the Horizon. Since then she has
appeared in many plays. She is
especially fond of her part as Nell
West in Maxwell Anderson's The
Eve of St. Mark.

Residence for the summer quarter. "The vehicle, whether it be the
stage, the movies, or television, is of a secondary nature. I enjoy
working in all three mediums, but of course the Stanford Summer
Theatre is my very favorite."
And Miss MacMahon is our very favorite actress since this is her
fourth visit to our campus as an Artist-in-ReMdence. Her last appear
ance here was three summers ago when she played the leading role in
The Madwoman of Chaillot, which incidentally is her favorite role.
(We certainly do play favorites in this column.)

For many years it has been the
policy of the Department of
Speech and Drama to invite dis
tinguished actors from the profes
sional theatre to participate in our
productions in order to provide
the student actors with the oppor
tunity and experience of working
with mature and established art
ists. Previously Miss MacMahon
played here in The Rivals, L'Arle
sienne, and My Indian Family.
Miss MacMahon and her husband,
Clarence Stein, the famous archi
tect, are residing in the guest
room of Stern Hall.
This summer our distinguished
actress is playing the role of
Madame Alexandra in Mademois
elle Colombe, Jean Anouilh's sa
tiric comedy of life in the theatre
which is being presented this week
and next in the Little Theatre.
Since Miss MacMahon was last
at Stanford she has played for a
season in the New York produc
tion of The Confidential Clerk
and in A Day By the Sea which
played a three week engagement
last fall at the Curran Theatre
before beginning its New York
engagement.
Her film career began in 1931
when she signed a five year con
tract with Warner Brothers. Her
first film was Five Star Final.
Since then she has appeared in
many movies, among them The
Eddie Cantor Story and Dragon
Seed.
Upon graduating from Barnard
College Miss MacMahon made her
first appearance on the New York
stage at the Neighborhood Play
house. This appearance was made
possible through the efforts of
Alice and Irene Lewisohn, es
teemed patrons of the arts, who
first recognized her talents. Mr.
Lee Shubert was the next figure
of importance to recognize her
talent. He made it possible for her
to appear in the 1925 version of
Artists and Models in Paris. Next
came Eugene O'Neill, who cast
her in the part of Ruth Atkins
in the first production of Beyond
the Horizon. Since then she has
appeared in many plays. She is
especially fond of her part as Nell
West in Maxwell Anderson's The
Eve of St. Mark.
"The part's the thing," says Miss Aline MacMahon our Artist-in-
Residence for the summer quarter. "The vehicle, whether it be the
stage, the movies, or television, is of a secondary nature. I enjoy
working in all three mediums, but of course the Stanford Summer
