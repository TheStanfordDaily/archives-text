# Margaret Parsons, English Student, Compares America with Homeland
## 
### 
"Overwhelming" was the word used by Margaret Parsons to de
scribe her first sight of America on June 19 of this year.
This first sight was New York, after her arrival on the Queen
Mary from her home in Doncaster, England. "That is in Yorkshire,"
Miss Parsons tells us.
She is at Stanford doing advanced work in biochemistry. In Eng
land she attended Manchester University in Lancashire where she
majored in chemistry and received her B.Sc., and M.Sc. While here
on a Fulbright travel grant and a Stanford Fellowship as a research
associate, she is working with Dr. Hubert S. Loring, chemistry pro
fessor.
One of her first confusing incidents in America "was the traffic.
In England, the cars travel on the left side of the street. I look the
wrong way when I cross the street, and I go to get into a car on the

wrong side."
The traffic lights also offer a
challenge to her. "In England the
pedestrian crosses on the red light.
New York City was the first place
1 found this was not so. I found
out when I tried to cross on the
red."
Men Allowed in Rooms
In comparing the two countries,
Miss Parsons notes many differ
ences, "although hall life here is
much like Manchester. There is
one big difference, though. I ex
pected rules to be much looser
here, but in some cases they are
more strict. For instance, over
there we are allowed to have men
in our rooms."
She explains that their rooms in
the dormitory are much larger,
having a fire place, much more
furniture, carpets and a glory. "A
glory," she says, "is a place in the
corner of the room for food, some
thing like a cupboard. We make
hot drinks and have tea and cakes
in the afternoon and evening."
The men are allowed in from 10
a.m. to 10:15 p.m. and are checked
in and out.
"Everything's Different"
"Everything is different here."
Among some of these she men
tions is the difference in the top
ics of conversation at the dinner
table. "We, in England, argue
more about world affairs, and we
never talk about dates."
Food, too, is different. "At home
we have plainer diets. We don't
have such things as salads before
meals or so many different things
during a meal, but I like the food
here," she adds.
Not long after arriving here she
sent home for some English tea.
When asked about the American
tea bag, she politely had no com
ment.
England vs. America
Comparing the English univer
sity system with the American
one, she says,"From what I hear,
a bright student in America may
not be able to go to college if he
doesn't have the money. In Eng
land this would not be the case.
Every high school student may
take a test and only the ones with
the higher marks are allowed to
attend the universities. They are
then given grants which pay their
expenses.
"Another difference is in the
exams. In the English universi
ties, the final exam is given after
three years, the normal time to
get a degree, and the exam covers
the work for the entire three
years. During these three years,
there are lectures, but most of the
work is done on one's own in the
form of research."
"The people here are quite
friendly. They show their friend
liness much more than at home.
There they are more reserved, and

although they do a lot for you,
they never will say anything
about it."
Dating in England, she explains,
is altogether different. "Here a
fellow will ask a girl out for cof
fee just to meet her. There he
would not think of it unless he
were 'really' interested. In Eng
land you go with the same person
for quite a long time." Also you
stay in groups much more in Eng
land with "little pairing off."
Miss Parsons plans to stay at
Stanford for at least one year.
"With her crisp accent, Mar
garet certainly does add a nice
spark to Lagunita," says Moreen
Laird, president of AWS, who
helped orientate her during her
first days on the Farm.

"Everything's Different"
"Everything is different here."
Among some of these she men
tions is the difference in the top
ics of conversation at the dinner
table. "We, in England, argue
more about world affairs, and we
never talk about dates."
Food, too, is different. "At home
we have plainer diets. We don't
have such things as salads before
meals or so many different things
during a meal, but I like the food
here," she adds.
Not long after arriving here she
sent home for some English tea.
When asked about the American
tea bag, she politely had no com
ment.
England vs. America
Comparing the English univer
sity system with the American
one, she says,"From what I hear,
a bright student in America may
not be able to go to college if he
doesn't have the money. In Eng
land this would not be the case.
Every high school student may
take a test and only the ones with
the higher marks are allowed to
attend the universities. They are
then given grants which pay their
expenses.
"Another difference is in the
exams. In the English universi
ties, the final exam is given after
three years, the normal time to
get a degree, and the exam covers
the work for the entire three
years. During these three years,
there are lectures, but most of the
work is done on one's own in the
form of research."
"The people here are quite
friendly. They show their friend
liness much more than at home.
There they are more reserved, and

although they do a lot for you,
they never will say anything
about it."
Dating in England, she explains,
is altogether different. "Here a
fellow will ask a girl out for cof
fee just to meet her. There he
would not think of it unless he
were 'really' interested. In Eng
land you go with the same person
for quite a long time." Also you
stay in groups much more in Eng
land with "little pairing off."
Miss Parsons plans to stay at
Stanford for at least one year.
"With her crisp accent, Mar
garet certainly does add a nice
spark to Lagunita," says Moreen
Laird, president of AWS, who
helped orientate her during her

MARGARET PARSONS
"Overwhelming" was the word used by Margaret Parsons to de
scribe her first sight of America on June 19 of this year.
This first sight was New York, after her arrival on the Queen
Mary from her home in Doncaster, England. "That is in Yorkshire,"
Miss Parsons tells us.
She is at Stanford doing advanced work in biochemistry. In Eng
land she attended Manchester University in Lancashire where she
majored in chemistry and received her B.Sc., and M.Sc. While here
on a Fulbright travel grant and a Stanford Fellowship as a research
associate, she is working with Dr. Hubert S. Loring, chemistry pro
fessor.
One of her first confusing incidents in America "was the traffic.
In England, the cars travel on the left side of the street. I look the
wrong way when I cross the street, and I go to get into a car on the

wrong side."
The traffic lights also offer a
challenge to her. "In England the
pedestrian crosses on the red light.
New York City was the first place
1 found this was not so. I found
out when I tried to cross on the
red."
Men Allowed in Rooms
In comparing the two countries,
Miss Parsons notes many differ
ences, "although hall life here is
much like Manchester. There is
one big difference, though. I ex
pected rules to be much looser
here, but in some cases they are
more strict. For instance, over
there we are allowed to have men
in our rooms."
She explains that their rooms in
the dormitory are much larger,
having a fire place, much more
furniture, carpets and a glory. "A
glory," she says, "is a place in the
corner of the room for food, some
thing like a cupboard. We make
hot drinks and have tea and cakes
in the afternoon and evening."
The men are allowed in from 10
a.m. to 10:15 p.m. and are checked
in and out.
