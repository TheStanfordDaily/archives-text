# Transistor And Polio Experts Make Faculty
## 
### 
Two internationally-known sci
entists, both one-time Stanford
students, have been named to
Stanford's faculty, President Wal
lace Sterling has announced.
They are Dr. William Shockley,
inventor of the transistor, and Dr.
Carlton E. Schwerdt, famed for
his research in polio virus.
Shockley, currently the director
of the Shockley Semiconductor
Laboratory in Mountain View, has
been appointed a lecturer in elec
trical engineering.
The famed scientist is credited
with inventing the transistor in
1952 while working on vacuum
tube and radar design with 801 l
Laboratories. The transistor, a
power source described as "small
er than a grain of wheat," is revo
lutionizing the electronics indus
try.
Dr. Schwerdt will leave his po
sition at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley to accept an
appointment as associate profes
sor in medical microbiology at
Stanford, beginning September 1.
He will teach medical and grad
uate students and carry on his
research. Recently Dr. Schwerdt
and F. L. Shaffer were able to
crystalize the polio virus during
their work at the Virus Research
Laboratories on the Berkeley cam
pus. At Stanford he will continue
to work on the purification and
isolation of the virus.
