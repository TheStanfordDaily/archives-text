### 
"The Most Happy Fellow" has been announced as the theme for
the Lagunita Semi-Formal that will be held Saturday, Aug. 4.
Sue Snyder, co-chairman of the publicity committee for the dance,
explained that the theme comes from the hit-musical which is now
appearing on Broadway. "An extensive publicity campaign is being
planned that will use this theme all over campus," said Sue.
The dance will feature the seven-member orchestra of Howard
Fredric. "This is the same group that played for the Roble Formal
this year," said Janie Beardsley, co-chairman of the dance.

The dance, which is co-spon
sored by the ASSU and Lag, will
be held in the Lagunita dining
room from 8:30 until 12:30 and
will cost $1.50.
"We are really looking forward
to this dance, because we know
that it will be just as successful
as the dance last week end. The
ASSU certainly was pleased with
so many students attending the
events this summer," said Moreen
Laird, ASSU legislature member
and AWS president.
"There were 170 at the Stern
dance," Moreen said, adding that
"this was thirty more than last
year."
The committee chairmen for
the dance are: Margie Shannon,
decorations; Sandy Hogan, tick
ets; Anita Kaplan, refreshments;
Ellie Weiss and Sue Snyder, pub
licity, and Bernice Fairchild, bids.
Co-chairman with Janie Beards
ley of the entire affair is John
Binns.
"This is the only dance during
the summer where the girls are
supposed to invite the fellows,"
said Janie.
