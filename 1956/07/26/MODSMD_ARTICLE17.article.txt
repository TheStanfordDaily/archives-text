## 
### 
Saturday has been designated as the last day for signing up for
the ASSU summer nine-hole golf tournament that will be held Mon
day, July 30, at 3 p.m.
Winner of the one-day, handicapped tourney will receive a trophy

donated by Roos Brothers of the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
winner will be the contestant with
the lowest net score. Other prizes
will be awarded for lowest gross
score and lowest number of putts.
A boobie prize and other special
awards will also be given. Only
one prize may be won by any
player.
Sign-up sheets have been posted
in the dormitories, gyms, and out
side the Cellar. The tournament
will be open to all Stanford sum
mer students. Entrance fee will

a score between 36 and 42. After
he has played, this handicap will
be subtracted from the score he
shoots. At the end of the tourney,
numbers from 36 to 42 will be put
into a hat and the number which
is drawn out will become the net
score that will win the tourna
ment.
"In this system," said Claire
Nemoede, chairman of the tourna
ment, "everyone will have a
chance no matter what type of
player he is."
Pairing will be posted at the

day of the tourney. Teeing off
time will last until 4 p.m. If a
player wishes to tee off at a
specific time, that time should
be designated next to his or her
