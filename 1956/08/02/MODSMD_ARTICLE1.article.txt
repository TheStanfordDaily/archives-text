## Library—"May Be Hoover's Greatest Monument"—Collier's 
### 
I-loovor Library will be featured in a two page spread in Collier's
Magazine, which will hit the newsstands today.
The August 17 issue of the magazine titles the article, " 'To Pro
mote Peace,' A tour with Herbert Hoover of the library that may be
his greatest monument."
Along with six color pictures of Hoover and Stanford University,
the article by Robert Deßoos gives information on the contents of

Hoover Library.
The article states "It was back
in 1915, when he was an eminent
mining engineer with his politi
cal career still before him, that
Mr. Hoover got started on the
library. A book by historian An
drew D. White gave him the key:
White bewailed the fact that 'fugi
tive documents' which told the
'real' story of the French Revolu
tion had disappeared. Mr. Hoover
mulled this a bit and decided he
would collect the 'fugitive docu
ments' pertaining to the war then
gripping Europe. Later he estab
lished the library on the Stanford
campus to accommodate his grow
ing hoard of materials."
The eighty-two year old Stan
ford alumnus says, "These are the
documents which reflect the lives
of the people. The idea is to let
the documents speak for them
selves. That way we won't have
to rely on one or two versions
coming down through history by
hearsay."
The article tells of the restricted
areas which contain testaments of
Soviet refugees, Spanish Ameri
can Wrtt papers and memoirs
which can not be opened until
some time in the future, "because
their contents may harm living
people."
"This unique library may be his
greatest monument an institu
tion devoted to the idea that peace
can he found in the ashes of war.
He himself says it: 'Here are the
documents which record Ihc suf
fering. the self-denial, the heroic
deeds of men. Surely from these
records there can he help to man
kind in its confusions and per
plexities and its yearnings for
peace.' "
