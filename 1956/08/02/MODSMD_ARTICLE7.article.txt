# Commuters in 'Squeeze Play'
## Boggs Surveys 143 Los Altans 
### 
City dwellers who move to ru- -
ral areas and commute to work
are sooner or later likely to get
caught in a "squeeze play" be
tween newcomers and expanding
suburban cities, a Stanford sociol
ogist reports.
Professor Stephen T. Boggs
reached this conclusion after sur
veying a "random sample" of 143
families in Los Altos. He sought
an explanation why rural, unin
corporated areas keep springing
up farther and farther from big
cities, leaving large areas of in
efficiently developed land be
hind them.
"For whatever reasons," re
ports Professor Boggs, "a large
number of people do not like to
live in large cities. Many of them
find established suburbs too much
like the cities and, to avoid them,
must go some distance awayâ€”usu
ally along some rapid transit
route.
"But so many people follow
their lead that the rural character
is diminished, and later comers
often select the community for its
emerging suburban qualities.
Incorporation and Planning
The result is the adoption of
some means of defense: incorpo
ration and planning. If the ma
jority gets its way, further de
velopment occurs, and opponents
are left with the unhappy choice
of living in a place unlike the one
they chose, or of pulling up stakes
and moving on."
More husbands than wives pre
fer a rural area, Professor Boggs
found. More than a third of the
men interviewed would like a
more rural area than Los Altos,
while over half would not want to
live in a more highly developed
suburb like nearby Palo Alto (pop.
40,000). Over 90 percent would
not want to live in the city.
Men Enthusiastic Ruralites
"The most enthusiastic ruralites
were men," he writes, "while ad
mirers of Palo Alto were more fre
quently women. Interestingly,
many men said a suburb like Palo
Alto was 'all right' when the wife
preferred it, while women said
the same thing about a rural area
when that was the husband's pref
erence." ~
In 1952, when the population
was approximately 15,000, Los
Altans voted to incorporate by a
narrow majority of 52.9 percent.
Of the families surveyed by Pro
fessor Boggs 2V2 years later, 59.4
percent said they would vote for
incorporation.
Events since the incorporation
of Los Altos have convinced more
ot its original opponents of the ad
vantages of incorporation, he be
lieves. And a majority of recent
arrivals, who were not present in
1952, said they would not prefer a
more rural community. Thus in
time the proportion in favor of a
more suburban type of community
can be expected to grow.
Pro and Con
The main reasons given for sup
porting incorporation were a de
sire for future development of
municipal services, and prevention
of annexation by an adjacent com
munity. Opponents of incorpora
tion listed higher taxes and gov
ernment interference as principal
reasons.
Anti-government and anti-an
nexation attitudes were most prev
alent among pre-incorporation
residents. Two-thirds of the new
comers were primarily concerned
with new services and their cost,
and a fourth said they would vote
against incorporation to prevent
higher taxes.
Future in Question
"Talking with Los Altans about
the future of their community,"
Professor Boggs remarks, "is like
talking to the French about poli
tics: after visits with six individ
uals one can see the possibility of
at least* nine political platforms.
Like the French, Los Altans are
logically consistent, hut each pro
ceeds from different assumptions.
That these views have as much
pattern as they do is remarkable."
The Stanford sociologist warns
that his survey results may be un
reliable, and advises all sides to
consider which of their goals are
reconcilable in the long run
