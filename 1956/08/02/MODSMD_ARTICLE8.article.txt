# Ed Council Holds Dessert August 9
## 
### 
The Education Council will
sponsor a buffet dessert on the
Education Building "greens" Au
gust 9th from 12 to 1:30 p.m.
The buffet is only one of the
activities of the council. The
group's purpose is to bring sug
gestions and requests from the
student body to the general meet
ings and discuss them. Out of
these meetings have come actions
which have led to the new cookie
vendor in the Education Lounge,
the more adequate crossings over
the ditches, the repaired Ditto ma
chine, and the coffee hour.
The evaluation committee of
the council, one of the five com
mittees of the council, solicits the
student evaluation of the instruc
tion given in a specific class. No
one but the professor concerned
sees his "personality-teacher quo
tient," and this is after grades
have been filed.
Summer quarter officers of the
council are: Harold Price, presi
dent; Jean Greenlee, vice-presiv
dent; Sister Dolores Marie, sec
retary, and John Bean, treasurer.
Executive Committee meetings
are held each Monday and gen
eral Education Council meetings
are held each Wednesday at noon
in room e57.
