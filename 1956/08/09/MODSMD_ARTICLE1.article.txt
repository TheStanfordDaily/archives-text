# $,21,950,000 Is Goal In Medical Center Fund
## 
### 
Former President Herbert Hoover Saturday announced the estab
lishment of a Stanford Medical Center Fund, the largest effort of its
kind ever undertaken in the West.
The "first stage" objective is to raise $21,950,000 for development
of a Medical Center based on a new concept of education for medicine.
The Medical Center will be located on the University's campus at Palo
Alto. The goal, he said, includes $1,000,000 for improving the present
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco, foreseen as a potential facility
for supplemental medical education and research.
As honorary chairman of the fund, Hoover made his announcement
at the San Francisco offices of the Stanford Board of Trustees. He
has been a trustee of the University since 1912, and was graduated
in the "Pioneer Class" of 1895.
W. P. Fuller 111 has been appointed general chairman of the fund,
it was announced by Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, president of the Stanford
trustees. Fuller is a director and vice-president of W. P. Fuller &
Company, and a graduate of Stanford and of Harvard Law School.
A prominent business and civic leader, he was president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 1952.

Dinkelspiel also announced the
appointment of two vice-chair
men: James B. Black, board chair
man of Pacific Gas & Electric
Company, and Charles R; Blyth,
president of Blyth & Company,
Inc. Both vice-chairmen are trus
tees of the University.
"For almost half a century I
have been associated with under
takings to relieve human suffer
ing and to raise the level of pub
lic health," Hoover said. "During
these years I have witnessed great
advances in medical science from
which our people have vitally
benefited. These advances have
been derived primarily from re
search done in our universities
and medical schools. The country
is short of doctors and medical
technicians.
"Stanford University has a dis
tinguished medical school which
has contributed to this advance.
It needs financial support. In ad
dition to my general interest in
the strengthening of our medical
schools, I have a special interest
in the Stanford School of Medi
cine because I am a Stanford
alumnus and have been a Stan
ford trustee since 1912."
Stanford President Sterling
pointed out that the pattern for
the new Stanford Medical Center
is the product of more than three
years oi intensive study and out
side consultation. Its concept far
exceeds mere replacement of out
moded facilities, he said.
"At Stanford emphasis remains
on superior professional training.
The move to the campus will bring
medical education into a true Uni
versity environment. Closer rela
tionships with the liberal arts and
sciences will broaden the educa
tion of medical students; they will
also introduce a flow of the knowl
edge and values of medicine into
the education of other students.
"A revised curriculum will make
not only for this breadth and flexi
bility of education, but also will
afford opportunities for student
experience in research. Students
will receive the versatile educa

tion they need in a rapidly chang
ing and expanding world of medi
cine, and for leadership roles in
whatever area of medical activity
they choose to enter."
Architectural drawings for the
new Medical Center depict a large
group of three-story buildings,
connected by open walkways on
all levels, and opening on numer
ous garden patios shaded by ex
isting oak and eucalyptus trees.
They will contain a 215-bed teach
ing hospital, clinics, teaching fa
cilities, and a library.
These buildings will comprise
approximately 525,000 square feet,
to be erected on a 40-acre campus
site at a cost of $14,450,000. En
dowment funds of $6,500,000 plus
the $1,000,000 for remodeling of
the present Stanford Hospital,
comprise the total stage one goal
of $21,950,000.
Funds already available total
nearly $4,000,000, fund chairman
Fuller revealed. These include
gifts and bequests of approxi
mately $2,000,000 and over $500,-
000 from state and federal agen
cies to help construct a rehabilita
tion center unit.
A $1,000,000 grant from the
Commonwealth Fund of New
York is also included in the sum
on hand, although it actually will
not be received until matched by
gifts from West Coast donors.
Working drawings for the Stan
ford Medical Center are now in
preparation by the architect, Ed
ward D. Stone of New York. Con
struction of the first unit will be
gin this fall. Target date for com
pletion of the first stage is March
1, 1959.
"Volunteer committees are now
being formed to raise the funds
needed for stage one," Fuller said.
"In the spring of 1957, we will be
seeking support from all quarters.
A special and generous response is
anticipated from Stanford's medi
cal alumni as well as from busi
ness and industry and the general
public, all of whom will benefit
directly from the new Medical
Center.
"To the Bay Area and the entire
West this enterprise is both a chal
lenge and an opportunity. Already
we have been encouraged by sub
stantial grants from some founda
tions and individuals. With such a
start we are confident that the en
tire community will want to play
its full part. In accepting the
chairmanship of the fund I con
sider it a privilege to share in mak
ing this great center a reality."
A long-term "stage two" fund
ing effort of equal magnitude will
be made following completion of
stage one. This will finance fur
ther development of the Medical
Center program, build residences
for its students, and provide it
with adequate endowment.
Dean Cutting pointed out that
Medical Center planners have
worked closely with community
leaders, physicians, and govern
ment agencies. One result is the
government's participation in con
struction of the rehabilitation cen
ter.
Another result will be the Medi
cal Center's Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospitals, combined for economies
in construction and joint opera
tion. The city's hospital will oc
cupy one 226-bed wing of the
building, while the other wing will
comprise Stanford's teaching hos
pital.
Additional teaching facilities
will be afforded by the 1,000-bed
Veterans Administration Hospital
to be built on Stanford land not
far away. Scheduled for comple
tion by 1959, the VA Hospital was
planned at Stanford because of its
future proximity to the Medical
Center.
A group of loyal physicians, den
tists, and businessmen also have
leased 10 acres of nearby Stanford
land for construction of a $3,000-
000 medical-dental office building.
It is to be ready for occupancy by
December, 1957.

of $21,950,000.
Funds already available total
nearly $4,000,000, fund chairman
Fuller revealed. These include
gifts and bequests of approxi
mately $2,000,000 and over $500,-
000 from state and federal agen
cies to help construct a rehabilita
tion center unit.
A $1,000,000 grant from the
Commonwealth Fund of New
York is also included in the sum
on hand, although it actually will
not be received until matched by
gifts from West Coast donors.
Working drawings for the Stan
ford Medical Center are now in
preparation by the architect, Ed
ward D. Stone of New York. Con
struction of the first unit will be
gin this fall. Target date for com
pletion of the first stage is March
1, 1959.
"Volunteer committees are now
being formed to raise the funds
needed for stage one," Fuller said.
"In the spring of 1957, we will be
seeking support from all quarters.
A special and generous response is
anticipated from Stanford's medi
cal alumni as well as from busi
ness and industry and the general
public, all of whom will benefit
directly from the new Medical
Center.
"To the Bay Area and the entire
West this enterprise is both a chal
lenge and an opportunity. Already
we have been encouraged by sub
stantial grants from some founda
tions and individuals. With such a
start we are confident that the en
tire community will want to play
its full part. In accepting the
chairmanship of the fund I con
sider it a privilege to share in mak
ing this great center a reality."
A long-term "stage two" fund
ing effort of equal magnitude will
be made following completion of
stage one. This will finance fur
ther development of the Medical
Center program, build residences
for its students, and provide it
with adequate endowment.
Dean Cutting pointed out that
Medical Center planners have
worked closely with community
leaders, physicians, and govern
ment agencies. One result is the
government's participation in con
struction of the rehabilitation cen
ter.
Another result will be the Medi
cal Center's Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospitals, combined for economies
in construction and joint opera
tion. The city's hospital will oc
cupy one 226-bed wing of the
building, while the other wing will
comprise Stanford's teaching hos
pital.
Additional teaching facilities
will be afforded by the 1,000-bed
Veterans Administration Hospital
to be built on Stanford land not
far away. Scheduled for comple
tion by 1959, the VA Hospital was
planned at Stanford because of its
future proximity to the Medical
Center.
A group of loyal physicians, den
tists, and businessmen also have
leased 10 acres of nearby Stanford
land for construction of a $3,000-
000 medical-dental office building.
It is to be ready for occupancy by
December, 1957.
Former President Herbert Hoover Saturday announced the estab
lishment of a Stanford Medical Center Fund, the largest effort of its
kind ever undertaken in the West.
The "first stage" objective is to raise $21,950,000 for development
of a Medical Center based on a new concept of education for medicine.
The Medical Center will be located on the University's campus at Palo
Alto. The goal, he said, includes $1,000,000 for improving the present
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco, foreseen as a potential facility
for supplemental medical education and research.
As honorary chairman of the fund, Hoover made his announcement
at the San Francisco offices of the Stanford Board of Trustees. He
has been a trustee of the University since 1912, and was graduated
in the "Pioneer Class" of 1895.
W. P. Fuller 111 has been appointed general chairman of the fund,
it was announced by Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, president of the Stanford
trustees. Fuller is a director and vice-president of W. P. Fuller &
Company, and a graduate of Stanford and of Harvard Law School.
A prominent business and civic leader, he was president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 1952.

Dinkelspiel also announced the
appointment of two vice-chair
men: James B. Black, board chair
man of Pacific Gas & Electric
Company, and Charles R; Blyth,
president of Blyth & Company,
Inc. Both vice-chairmen are trus
tees of the University.
"For almost half a century I
have been associated with under
takings to relieve human suffer
ing and to raise the level of pub
lic health," Hoover said. "During
these years I have witnessed great
advances in medical science from
which our people have vitally
benefited. These advances have
been derived primarily from re
search done in our universities
and medical schools. The country
is short of doctors and medical
technicians.
"Stanford University has a dis
tinguished medical school which
has contributed to this advance.
It needs financial support. In ad
dition to my general interest in
the strengthening of our medical
schools, I have a special interest
in the Stanford School of Medi
cine because I am a Stanford
alumnus and have been a Stan
ford trustee since 1912."
Stanford President Sterling
pointed out that the pattern for
the new Stanford Medical Center
is the product of more than three
years oi intensive study and out
side consultation. Its concept far
exceeds mere replacement of out
moded facilities, he said.
"At Stanford emphasis remains
on superior professional training.
The move to the campus will bring
medical education into a true Uni
versity environment. Closer rela
tionships with the liberal arts and
sciences will broaden the educa
tion of medical students; they will
also introduce a flow of the knowl
edge and values of medicine into
the education of other students.
"A revised curriculum will make
not only for this breadth and flexi
bility of education, but also will
afford opportunities for student
experience in research. Students
will receive the versatile educa

tion they need in a rapidly chang
ing and expanding world of medi
cine, and for leadership roles in
whatever area of medical activity
they choose to enter."
Architectural drawings for the
new Medical Center depict a large
group of three-story buildings,
connected by open walkways on
all levels, and opening on numer
ous garden patios shaded by ex
isting oak and eucalyptus trees.
They will contain a 215-bed teach
ing hospital, clinics, teaching fa
cilities, and a library.
These buildings will comprise
approximately 525,000 square feet,
to be erected on a 40-acre campus
site at a cost of $14,450,000. En
dowment funds of $6,500,000 plus
the $1,000,000 for remodeling of
the present Stanford Hospital,
comprise the total stage one goal
of $21,950,000.

it was announced by Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, president of the Stanford
trustees. Fuller is a director and vice-president of W. P. Fuller &
Company, and a graduate of Stanford and of Harvard Law School.
A prominent business and civic leader, he was president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 1952.

Dinkelspiel also announced the
appointment of two vice-chair
men: James B. Black, board chair
man of Pacific Gas & Electric
Company, and Charles R; Blyth,
president of Blyth & Company,
Inc. Both vice-chairmen are trus
tees of the University.
"For almost half a century I
have been associated with under
takings to relieve human suffer
ing and to raise the level of pub
lic health," Hoover said. "During
these years I have witnessed great
advances in medical science from
which our people have vitally
benefited. These advances have
been derived primarily from re
search done in our universities
and medical schools. The country
is short of doctors and medical
technicians.
"Stanford University has a dis
tinguished medical school which
has contributed to this advance.
It needs financial support. In ad
dition to my general interest in
the strengthening of our medical
schools, I have a special interest
in the Stanford School of Medi
cine because I am a Stanford
alumnus and have been a Stan
ford trustee since 1912."
Stanford President Sterling
pointed out that the pattern for
the new Stanford Medical Center
is the product of more than three
years oi intensive study and out
side consultation. Its concept far
exceeds mere replacement of out
moded facilities, he said.
"At Stanford emphasis remains
on superior professional training.
The move to the campus will bring
medical education into a true Uni
versity environment. Closer rela
tionships with the liberal arts and
sciences will broaden the educa
tion of medical students; they will
also introduce a flow of the knowl
edge and values of medicine into
the education of other students.
"A revised curriculum will make
not only for this breadth and flexi
bility of education, but also will
afford opportunities for student
experience in research. Students
will receive the versatile educa

tion they need in a rapidly chang
ing and expanding world of medi
cine, and for leadership roles in
whatever area of medical activity
they choose to enter."
Architectural drawings for the
new Medical Center depict a large
group of three-story buildings,
connected by open walkways on
all levels, and opening on numer
ous garden patios shaded by ex
isting oak and eucalyptus trees.
They will contain a 215-bed teach
ing hospital, clinics, teaching fa
cilities, and a library.
These buildings will comprise
approximately 525,000 square feet,
to be erected on a 40-acre campus
site at a cost of $14,450,000. En
dowment funds of $6,500,000 plus
the $1,000,000 for remodeling of
the present Stanford Hospital,
comprise the total stage one goal
of $21,950,000.
Funds already available total
nearly $4,000,000, fund chairman
Fuller revealed. These include
gifts and bequests of approxi
mately $2,000,000 and over $500,-
000 from state and federal agen
cies to help construct a rehabilita
tion center unit.
A $1,000,000 grant from the
Commonwealth Fund of New
York is also included in the sum
on hand, although it actually will
not be received until matched by
gifts from West Coast donors.
Working drawings for the Stan
ford Medical Center are now in
preparation by the architect, Ed
ward D. Stone of New York. Con
struction of the first unit will be
gin this fall. Target date for com
pletion of the first stage is March
1, 1959.
"Volunteer committees are now
being formed to raise the funds
needed for stage one," Fuller said.
"In the spring of 1957, we will be
seeking support from all quarters.
A special and generous response is
anticipated from Stanford's medi
cal alumni as well as from busi
ness and industry and the general
public, all of whom will benefit
directly from the new Medical
Center.
"To the Bay Area and the entire
West this enterprise is both a chal
lenge and an opportunity. Already
we have been encouraged by sub
stantial grants from some founda
tions and individuals. With such a
start we are confident that the en
tire community will want to play
its full part. In accepting the
chairmanship of the fund I con
sider it a privilege to share in mak
ing this great center a reality."
A long-term "stage two" fund
ing effort of equal magnitude will
be made following completion of
stage one. This will finance fur
ther development of the Medical
Center program, build residences
for its students, and provide it
with adequate endowment.
Dean Cutting pointed out that
Medical Center planners have
worked closely with community
leaders, physicians, and govern
ment agencies. One result is the
government's participation in con
struction of the rehabilitation cen
ter.
Another result will be the Medi
cal Center's Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospitals, combined for economies
in construction and joint opera
tion. The city's hospital will oc
cupy one 226-bed wing of the
building, while the other wing will
comprise Stanford's teaching hos
pital.
Additional teaching facilities
will be afforded by the 1,000-bed
Veterans Administration Hospital
to be built on Stanford land not
far away. Scheduled for comple
tion by 1959, the VA Hospital was
planned at Stanford because of its
future proximity to the Medical
Center.
A group of loyal physicians, den
tists, and businessmen also have
leased 10 acres of nearby Stanford
land for construction of a $3,000-
000 medical-dental office building.
It is to be ready for occupancy by
December, 1957.
Former President Herbert Hoover Saturday announced the estab
lishment of a Stanford Medical Center Fund, the largest effort of its
kind ever undertaken in the West.
The "first stage" objective is to raise $21,950,000 for development
of a Medical Center based on a new concept of education for medicine.
The Medical Center will be located on the University's campus at Palo
Alto. The goal, he said, includes $1,000,000 for improving the present
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco, foreseen as a potential facility
for supplemental medical education and research.
As honorary chairman of the fund, Hoover made his announcement
at the San Francisco offices of the Stanford Board of Trustees. He
has been a trustee of the University since 1912, and was graduated
in the "Pioneer Class" of 1895.

1, 1959.
"Volunteer committees are now
being formed to raise the funds
needed for stage one," Fuller said.
"In the spring of 1957, we will be
seeking support from all quarters.
A special and generous response is
anticipated from Stanford's medi
cal alumni as well as from busi
ness and industry and the general
public, all of whom will benefit
directly from the new Medical
Center.
"To the Bay Area and the entire
West this enterprise is both a chal
lenge and an opportunity. Already
we have been encouraged by sub
stantial grants from some founda
tions and individuals. With such a
start we are confident that the en
tire community will want to play
its full part. In accepting the
chairmanship of the fund I con
sider it a privilege to share in mak
ing this great center a reality."
A long-term "stage two" fund
ing effort of equal magnitude will
be made following completion of
stage one. This will finance fur
ther development of the Medical
Center program, build residences
for its students, and provide it
with adequate endowment.
Dean Cutting pointed out that
Medical Center planners have
worked closely with community
leaders, physicians, and govern
ment agencies. One result is the
government's participation in con
struction of the rehabilitation cen
ter.
Another result will be the Medi
cal Center's Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospitals, combined for economies
in construction and joint opera
tion. The city's hospital will oc
cupy one 226-bed wing of the
building, while the other wing will
comprise Stanford's teaching hos
pital.
Additional teaching facilities
will be afforded by the 1,000-bed
Veterans Administration Hospital
to be built on Stanford land not
far away. Scheduled for comple
tion by 1959, the VA Hospital was
planned at Stanford because of its
future proximity to the Medical
Center.
A group of loyal physicians, den
tists, and businessmen also have
leased 10 acres of nearby Stanford
land for construction of a $3,000-
000 medical-dental office building.
It is to be ready for occupancy by
December, 1957.
Former President Herbert Hoover Saturday announced the estab
lishment of a Stanford Medical Center Fund, the largest effort of its
kind ever undertaken in the West.
The "first stage" objective is to raise $21,950,000 for development
of a Medical Center based on a new concept of education for medicine.
The Medical Center will be located on the University's campus at Palo
Alto. The goal, he said, includes $1,000,000 for improving the present
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco, foreseen as a potential facility
for supplemental medical education and research.
As honorary chairman of the fund, Hoover made his announcement
at the San Francisco offices of the Stanford Board of Trustees. He
has been a trustee of the University since 1912, and was graduated
in the "Pioneer Class" of 1895.
W. P. Fuller 111 has been appointed general chairman of the fund,
it was announced by Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, president of the Stanford
trustees. Fuller is a director and vice-president of W. P. Fuller &
Company, and a graduate of Stanford and of Harvard Law School.
A prominent business and civic leader, he was president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 1952.

Dinkelspiel also announced the
appointment of two vice-chair
men: James B. Black, board chair
man of Pacific Gas & Electric
Company, and Charles R; Blyth,
president of Blyth & Company,
Inc. Both vice-chairmen are trus
tees of the University.
"For almost half a century I
have been associated with under
takings to relieve human suffer
ing and to raise the level of pub
lic health," Hoover said. "During
these years I have witnessed great
advances in medical science from
which our people have vitally
benefited. These advances have
been derived primarily from re
search done in our universities
and medical schools. The country
is short of doctors and medical
technicians.
"Stanford University has a dis
tinguished medical school which
has contributed to this advance.
It needs financial support. In ad
dition to my general interest in
the strengthening of our medical
schools, I have a special interest
in the Stanford School of Medi
cine because I am a Stanford
alumnus and have been a Stan
ford trustee since 1912."
Stanford President Sterling
pointed out that the pattern for
the new Stanford Medical Center
is the product of more than three
years oi intensive study and out
side consultation. Its concept far
exceeds mere replacement of out
moded facilities, he said.
"At Stanford emphasis remains
on superior professional training.
The move to the campus will bring
medical education into a true Uni
versity environment. Closer rela
tionships with the liberal arts and
sciences will broaden the educa
tion of medical students; they will
also introduce a flow of the knowl
edge and values of medicine into
the education of other students.
"A revised curriculum will make
not only for this breadth and flexi
bility of education, but also will
afford opportunities for student
experience in research. Students
will receive the versatile educa

tion they need in a rapidly chang
ing and expanding world of medi
cine, and for leadership roles in
whatever area of medical activity
they choose to enter."
Architectural drawings for the
new Medical Center depict a large
group of three-story buildings,
connected by open walkways on
all levels, and opening on numer
ous garden patios shaded by ex
isting oak and eucalyptus trees.
They will contain a 215-bed teach
ing hospital, clinics, teaching fa
cilities, and a library.
These buildings will comprise
approximately 525,000 square feet,
to be erected on a 40-acre campus
site at a cost of $14,450,000. En
dowment funds of $6,500,000 plus
the $1,000,000 for remodeling of
the present Stanford Hospital,
comprise the total stage one goal
of $21,950,000.
Funds already available total
nearly $4,000,000, fund chairman
Fuller revealed. These include
gifts and bequests of approxi
mately $2,000,000 and over $500,-
000 from state and federal agen
cies to help construct a rehabilita
tion center unit.
A $1,000,000 grant from the
Commonwealth Fund of New
York is also included in the sum
on hand, although it actually will
not be received until matched by
gifts from West Coast donors.
Working drawings for the Stan
ford Medical Center are now in
preparation by the architect, Ed
ward D. Stone of New York. Con
struction of the first unit will be
gin this fall. Target date for com
pletion of the first stage is March
1, 1959.
