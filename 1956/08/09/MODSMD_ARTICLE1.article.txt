# $,21,950,000 Is Goal In Medical Center Fund
## 
### 
Former President Herbert Hoover Saturday announced the estab
lishment of a Stanford Medical Center Fund, the largest effort of its
kind ever undertaken in the West.
The "first stage" objective is to raise $21,950,000 for development
of a Medical Center based on a new concept of education for medicine.
The Medical Center will be located on the University's campus at Palo
Alto. The goal, he said, includes $1,000,000 for improving the present
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco, foreseen as a potential facility
for supplemental medical education and research.
As honorary chairman of the fund, Hoover made his announcement
at the San Francisco offices of the Stanford Board of Trustees. He
has been a trustee of the University since 1912, and was graduated
in the "Pioneer Class" of 1895.
W. P. Fuller 111 has been appointed general chairman of the fund,
it was announced by Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, president of the Stanford
trustees. Fuller is a director and vice-president of W. P. Fuller &
Company, and a graduate of Stanford and of Harvard Law School.
A prominent business and civic leader, he was president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 1952.

Dinkelspiel also announced the
appointment of two vice-chair
men: James B. Black, board chair
man of Pacific Gas & Electric
Company, and Charles R; Blyth,
president of Blyth & Company,
Inc. Both vice-chairmen are trus
tees of the University.
"For almost half a century I
have been associated with under
takings to relieve human suffer
ing and to raise the level of pub
lic health," Hoover said. "During
these years I have witnessed great
advances in medical science from
which our people have vitally
benefited. These advances have
been derived primarily from re
search done in our universities
and medical schools. The country
is short of doctors and medical
technicians.
"Stanford University has a dis
tinguished medical school which
has contributed to this advance.
It needs financial support. In ad
dition to my general interest in
the strengthening of our medical
schools, I have a special interest
in the Stanford School of Medi
cine because I am a Stanford
alumnus and have been a Stan
ford trustee since 1912."
Stanford President Sterling
pointed out that the pattern for
the new Stanford Medical Center
is the product of more than three
years oi intensive study and out
side consultation. Its concept far
exceeds mere replacement of out
moded facilities, he said.
"At Stanford emphasis remains
on superior professional training.
The move to the campus will bring
medical education into a true Uni
versity environment. Closer rela
tionships with the liberal arts and
sciences will broaden the educa
tion of medical students; they will
also introduce a flow of the knowl
edge and values of medicine into
the education of other students.
"A revised curriculum will make
not only for this breadth and flexi
bility of education, but also will
afford opportunities for student
experience in research. Students
will receive the versatile educa

tion they need in a rapidly chang
ing and expanding world of medi
cine, and for leadership roles in
whatever area of medical activity
they choose to enter."
Architectural drawings for the
new Medical Center depict a large
group of three-story buildings,
connected by open walkways on
all levels, and opening on numer
ous garden patios shaded by ex
isting oak and eucalyptus trees.
They will contain a 215-bed teach
ing hospital, clinics, teaching fa
cilities, and a library.
These buildings will comprise
approximately 525,000 square feet,
to be erected on a 40-acre campus
site at a cost of $14,450,000. En
