# Florence Moore Hall Will Open For Women In Fall
## 
### 
"Barring unforeseen circumstances, the new Florence Moore Resi
dence will be open when the women return for fall quarter," said
Miss Elva Fay Brown, dean of women, Tuesday.
In one unit the telephones have already been connected in each
room, the tile floors have been laid, and the mirrors in the rooms
have been hung.
The residence is composed of seven separate units, each of which
will house 50 girls. The units will be complete in themselves, each
having its own dining room, social room, and sundeck. The dining
room will be served from a central kitchen.
The names for each of the units have been chosen by the Florence
Moore Student Committee, headed by Nancy Wiser, and the dean of
women's office. The names will be: Alondra, Cardinal, Faisan, Gavian,
Loro, Mirlo, and Paloma.

The new director of Florence
Moore Residence will be Miss
Margaret Trainor, who is the di
rector of Lagunita during the last
part of summer quarter and who
has been the director of Roble in
the past.
Ground was broken for the over
two million dollar project last
summer. Plans had been started
the previous March when Mrs.
Moore donated one million dollars
specifying that it was to be
matched by Stanford. The univer
sity has done this and added more
when needed.
Unique to this women's resi
dence are the telephones in each
room.
Each room is for two girls, with
the exception of two single rooms
in each unit. Chocolate brown,
aqua, yellow, peach, and green
are the color themes throughout
the residence.
