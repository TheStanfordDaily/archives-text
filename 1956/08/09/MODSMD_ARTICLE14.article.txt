# Summer ASSU President Godi Praises Student Interest
## 
### 
As this quarter rapidly draws to a close, we take a brief glance
backward. Approximately seven weeks ago, the student body was
given an idea of the activities that had been planned. With this
preview came requests to help in further planning and to attend all
social functions. Each individual, by giving such support, would
profit personally and would help to insure a successful summer of
social events.
Now as we look back, it is evident that a very large majority of
the summer Stanford family had an encouraging, positive attitude.
The co-operation and support shown for an increased social pro
gram have made this summer's activities the most successful ever.
In comparison with previous years, attendance has been better at
every event this quarter.
More important than the enjoyable activities, however, are the
lasting benefits available to anyone who attends Stanford, whether
for one summer or eight years. They are the real, personal gains
of learning, new friendships, and pride in the university—things
that require no elaboration.
Many thanks to everyone from each member of the legislature.
It has been a pleasure to serve you.
