Stanford welcomes you . . . but
Kepler needs you!
He needs your TV-warped per
sonality, your commercial smile and
your Candidean optimism.
But most of ail he needs your
jangling dollars.
Unlike all other merchants,
Kepler's designs are mercenary and
his motives ulterior, if you don't
think so 'and even if you do), be
sure to see Kepler before you buy
i books at higher prices.
The Peninsula's only complete
collection of papcrbound books,
including the Western Civ. outline—
