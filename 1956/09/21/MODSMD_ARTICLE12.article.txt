# FIRST YEAR COURSES
## Freshmen Start With New Undergraduate Requirements 
### 
Freshmen entering Stanford (
this year will face the first change i
in undergraduate requirements I
here in 35 years.
In the fall of 1954 the Univer
sity established the Committee for
St n ri en t Undergraduate Educa
tion. II was the job of this com
mittee to study and make sugges
tions for changes in the entire
University undergraduate pro
gram. Seven men made up the
Executive Committee, with repre
sentatives from most of the major
University departments making
up a 2.1-man advisory committee.
Two subcommittees were ap
pointed the first to study basic
academic requirements for all stu
dents, the second to revise the re
quirements for the AB degree.
Committee Findings
These committees submitted
their findings to the University
in December of last year. They
were adopted this February. The
new requirements go into effect
this autumn with the entrance of
the class of 1960.
A new committee was estab
lished, replacing the old Student
Undergraduate Committee, which
ceased to function when the new
requirements went in to effect.
This is 1 he Committee on General
Studies, headed by Dr. Robert
Walker of the political science de
partment This committee exer
cises control over all undergradu
ate curriculums.
The basic changes from the old
system, which all classes under
that graduating in 1960 will con
tinue to follow, are:
• Two main changes in the
basic requirements for all stu
dents. Instead of English Com
position. which formerly ran two
quarters, there are' now three
quarters' work in English requir
ed This includes a course in Eng
lish literature, in addition to two
quarters of English Composition
previously required. Good Eng
lish usage will henceforth be part

of the grading of all papers, no
matter what the department.
• Students will still continue
to take the three-quarter History
of Western Civilization as before.
The language and math require
ments remain about the same.
• Instead of six units of physi
cal education formerly required
for graduation from the Univer
sity, only two units are now re
quired. The four remaining units
are still required, but may be
taken by engaging in group ac
tivity. This will include one unit
of credit given for work in any
of the following subjects: band,
chorus, orchestra, dramatic pro
ductions, student government
(Legislature, Men's and Women's
Councils only), administration of
Stanford Concert Series, The
Stanford Daily, Sequoia or Quad.
The units may continue to be ful
filled by courses in PR.
Although these six units do not
count for academic credit toward
graduation, they must lie com
pleted for graduation. The Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion urges students to get Ihese
requirements out of the way as
soon as is convenient. It says it
will not consider petitions to
waive these requirements. The
units may be completed at any
time during the four-year curricu
lum. More than one unit may be
taken during a single quarter.
• Area requirements for all stu
dents have been somewhat en
larged and are more specific
under the new plan. All academic
departments fall into one of three
areas. They are humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences,
which include mathematics, ap
plied sciences and engineering. A
student must complete require
ments in two areas in which they
are not majoring.
• Eight units are required in
humanities. They must be select
ed from courses approved bv the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. Courses to fulfill this re
quirement nlist be • e'er|"d from
two of the following three fields:
the fine arts, philosophy or re?i
gion, or literature.
• In 111" s irial S'-ieqcev two
five-unit cour ;es, iiv.'ead of the
previous one cour e, will be chos
en from Ihe social seienee .area.
• The natural scieiv-e requirc
ment will rinain about the same
as it was before the new plan.
This complete:; the new require
ments for p_o iera! 'jnd rgraduatc
students. There ar? further new
requirem"nts for candr'ates for
the AH do.yr -e. interested persons
may ehtfek with their a 'visors for
further clarification on this sub
ject.
During their first quarter, all
freshmen must lake English I and
a foreign language or math, un
less they can pass tdacement tests.
I'laccnvnl Tests
Under the new system, in units
of credit toward graduation will
be allowed a student who can pass
tests placing him in advanced
standing in a number of courses.
If, for instance, a student did we 1.1
in Spanish in high school and can
successfully pass a placement lest
ih Spanish 23, he need not take
the full number of units of a for
eign language. He will be allowed

a certain number of units' credit,
and he need take only enough to
liMsh his unit requirement for
language.
English A, or "honehead" Eng
lish, nas been dropped from the
Unherslty curriculum. Students
lacking in basic English will re
ceive.' e-:ira tutoring while they
ire taking regular English
courses. Thus tutoring will con
tinue o.ily as long as the student
needs it.
Henceforth, Stanford will be
run on a straight four-year basis,
rath, r than tiie old lower and
upper division bases, in effect
nice 1921. This will allow a stu
dent eiter;ng Stanford to declare
his major his first year here, if
he desires. As in the past, the
student must decide on a majon
by the beginning of his junior
year.

are not majoring.
• Eight units are required in
humanities. They must be select

I'laccnvnl Tests
Under the new system, in units
of credit toward graduation will
be allowed a student who can pass
tests placing him in advanced
standing in a number of courses.
If, for instance, a student did we 1.1
in Spanish in high school and can
successfully pass a placement lest
ih Spanish 23, he need not take
the full number of units of a for
eign language. He will be allowed

a certain number of units' credit,
and he need take only enough to
liMsh his unit requirement for
language.
English A, or "honehead" Eng
lish, nas been dropped from the
Unherslty curriculum. Students
lacking in basic English will re
ceive.' e-:ira tutoring while they
ire taking regular English
courses. Thus tutoring will con
tinue o.ily as long as the student
needs it.
Henceforth, Stanford will be
run on a straight four-year basis,
rath, r than tiie old lower and
upper division bases, in effect
nice 1921. This will allow a stu
dent eiter;ng Stanford to declare
his major his first year here, if
he desires. As in the past, the
student must decide on a majon
by the beginning of his junior
year.
Freshmen entering Stanford (
this year will face the first change i
in undergraduate requirements I
here in 35 years.
In the fall of 1954 the Univer
sity established the Committee for
St n ri en t Undergraduate Educa
tion. II was the job of this com
mittee to study and make sugges
tions for changes in the entire
University undergraduate pro
gram. Seven men made up the
Executive Committee, with repre
sentatives from most of the major
University departments making
up a 2.1-man advisory committee.
Two subcommittees were ap
pointed the first to study basic
academic requirements for all stu
dents, the second to revise the re
quirements for the AB degree.
Committee Findings
These committees submitted
their findings to the University
in December of last year. They
were adopted this February. The
new requirements go into effect
this autumn with the entrance of
the class of 1960.
A new committee was estab
lished, replacing the old Student
Undergraduate Committee, which
ceased to function when the new
requirements went in to effect.
This is 1 he Committee on General
Studies, headed by Dr. Robert
Walker of the political science de
partment This committee exer
cises control over all undergradu
ate curriculums.
The basic changes from the old
system, which all classes under
that graduating in 1960 will con
tinue to follow, are:
• Two main changes in the
basic requirements for all stu
dents. Instead of English Com
position. which formerly ran two
quarters, there are' now three
quarters' work in English requir
ed This includes a course in Eng
lish literature, in addition to two
quarters of English Composition
previously required. Good Eng
lish usage will henceforth be part

of the grading of all papers, no
matter what the department.
• Students will still continue
to take the three-quarter History
of Western Civilization as before.
The language and math require
ments remain about the same.
• Instead of six units of physi
cal education formerly required
for graduation from the Univer
sity, only two units are now re
quired. The four remaining units
are still required, but may be
taken by engaging in group ac
tivity. This will include one unit
of credit given for work in any
of the following subjects: band,
chorus, orchestra, dramatic pro
ductions, student government
(Legislature, Men's and Women's
Councils only), administration of
Stanford Concert Series, The
Stanford Daily, Sequoia or Quad.
The units may continue to be ful
filled by courses in PR.
Although these six units do not
count for academic credit toward
graduation, they must lie com
pleted for graduation. The Com

dent eiter;ng Stanford to declare
his major his first year here, if
he desires. As in the past, the
student must decide on a majon
by the beginning of his junior
year.
Freshmen entering Stanford (
this year will face the first change i
in undergraduate requirements I
here in 35 years.
In the fall of 1954 the Univer
sity established the Committee for
St n ri en t Undergraduate Educa
tion. II was the job of this com
mittee to study and make sugges
tions for changes in the entire
University undergraduate pro
gram. Seven men made up the
Executive Committee, with repre
sentatives from most of the major
University departments making
up a 2.1-man advisory committee.
Two subcommittees were ap
pointed the first to study basic
academic requirements for all stu
dents, the second to revise the re
quirements for the AB degree.
Committee Findings
These committees submitted
their findings to the University
in December of last year. They
were adopted this February. The
new requirements go into effect
this autumn with the entrance of
the class of 1960.
A new committee was estab
lished, replacing the old Student
Undergraduate Committee, which
ceased to function when the new
requirements went in to effect.
This is 1 he Committee on General
Studies, headed by Dr. Robert
Walker of the political science de
partment This committee exer
cises control over all undergradu
ate curriculums.
The basic changes from the old
system, which all classes under
that graduating in 1960 will con
tinue to follow, are:
• Two main changes in the
basic requirements for all stu
dents. Instead of English Com
position. which formerly ran two
quarters, there are' now three
quarters' work in English requir
ed This includes a course in Eng
lish literature, in addition to two
quarters of English Composition
previously required. Good Eng
lish usage will henceforth be part

of the grading of all papers, no
matter what the department.
• Students will still continue
to take the three-quarter History
of Western Civilization as before.
The language and math require
ments remain about the same.
• Instead of six units of physi
cal education formerly required
for graduation from the Univer
sity, only two units are now re
quired. The four remaining units
are still required, but may be
taken by engaging in group ac
tivity. This will include one unit
of credit given for work in any
of the following subjects: band,
chorus, orchestra, dramatic pro
ductions, student government
(Legislature, Men's and Women's
Councils only), administration of
Stanford Concert Series, The
Stanford Daily, Sequoia or Quad.
The units may continue to be ful
filled by courses in PR.
Although these six units do not
count for academic credit toward
graduation, they must lie com
pleted for graduation. The Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion urges students to get Ihese
requirements out of the way as
soon as is convenient. It says it
will not consider petitions to
waive these requirements. The
units may be completed at any
time during the four-year curricu
lum. More than one unit may be
taken during a single quarter.
• Area requirements for all stu
dents have been somewhat en
larged and are more specific
under the new plan. All academic
departments fall into one of three
areas. They are humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences,
which include mathematics, ap
plied sciences and engineering. A
student must complete require
ments in two areas in which they
are not majoring.
• Eight units are required in
humanities. They must be select
ed from courses approved bv the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. Courses to fulfill this re
quirement nlist be • e'er|"d from
two of the following three fields:
the fine arts, philosophy or re?i
gion, or literature.
• In 111" s irial S'-ieqcev two
five-unit cour ;es, iiv.'ead of the
previous one cour e, will be chos
en from Ihe social seienee .area.
• The natural scieiv-e requirc
ment will rinain about the same
as it was before the new plan.
This complete:; the new require
ments for p_o iera! 'jnd rgraduatc
students. There ar? further new
requirem"nts for candr'ates for
the AH do.yr -e. interested persons
may ehtfek with their a 'visors for
further clarification on this sub
ject.
During their first quarter, all
freshmen must lake English I and
a foreign language or math, un
less they can pass tdacement tests.
I'laccnvnl Tests
Under the new system, in units
of credit toward graduation will
be allowed a student who can pass
tests placing him in advanced
standing in a number of courses.
If, for instance, a student did we 1.1
in Spanish in high school and can
successfully pass a placement lest
ih Spanish 23, he need not take
the full number of units of a for
eign language. He will be allowed

a certain number of units' credit,
and he need take only enough to
liMsh his unit requirement for
language.
English A, or "honehead" Eng
lish, nas been dropped from the
Unherslty curriculum. Students
lacking in basic English will re
ceive.' e-:ira tutoring while they
ire taking regular English
courses. Thus tutoring will con
tinue o.ily as long as the student
needs it.
Henceforth, Stanford will be
run on a straight four-year basis,
rath, r than tiie old lower and
upper division bases, in effect
nice 1921. This will allow a stu
dent eiter;ng Stanford to declare
his major his first year here, if
he desires. As in the past, the
student must decide on a majon
by the beginning of his junior
year.
