i the foundation for

a broader and more intelligent outlook on life
is based. ,
Living together with people of your own age
whose backgrounds and interests are striking
different from your own, engaging in frequent
bull sessions on everything from football to
politics, having the opportunity to know well
the professors under whom you are studying,
seeking and laying the basis for the career
which you will follow after graduation—this is
a part of what you will find at Stanford. Hut
these experiences are only ingredients from
which you will be constantly molding your life.
And on the lighter side, Stanford is fun,
there's no getting around it. As you've probably
been told incessantly during the past few
months, these four years of your life will be
some of the best. But Stanford isn't all fun and
excitement; its hard work, a challenge and an
accomplishment. And for this reason, abo\e all
others, these years will count among the best.
I here s an old axiom that working toward a
goal is more rewarding than the goal itself, and
in a very true sense, this applies to vour life at
Stanford. For you are not being offered stimu
lation and education on a silver platter. It is
the degree to which you apply your mental and
physical capacities to the task ahead that will
measure your accomplishment.
Acceptance into the Stanford Famik is in it
self a testimony to your capabilities. The rest
is up to you. Best of luck.
