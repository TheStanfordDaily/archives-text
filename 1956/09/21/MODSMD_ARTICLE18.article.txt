# MOORE TO OPEN SUNDAY
## Stanford's Growth Paced by New buildings 
### 
Stanford has undergone a vast
building and land development
program in recent years.
Stern, Wilbur, Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Hall have all
been completed since the war.
This year 350 women will move
into the $2 million Florence
Moore Hall and in April the $630.-
000 music building across from
the post office will be completed.
The Stanford shopping center on
El Camino is still growing.
At the close of World War II
University officials began to plan
for the time when all students
that wanted to live on campus
i could do so. The first unit of
Stern Hall, located across from
| the pr esent site of Wilbur, was
j completed first. Then Crothers
• Hall, made possible by donations
I from Judge George E. Crothers.
i was built to house law studmts.
Last year another unit of Stern
and Crothers Memorial Hall for
| engineering students were conv
i pleted.
Women's Needs
In the meantime the need for
women's housing became acute,
j causing a cut in the number of
- last year's freshman women from
100 to 300. Consequently Florence
Moore Hall, situated between
I Lake Lagunita and the How, was
I built.
Two units will not be ready'

for another nvr.th. so for the first
time in Stanford history, Encina
Hall will be occupied by worpen.
From 1923 until Wilbur's comple
tion in 1955. Encina served as a
freshman men's dormitory.
The music building, which is to
have an auditorium seating 728. is
the beginning of a quadrangle of
student buildings. A new student
union building, Tresidder Memo
rial Union, is scheduled 1o be
built across from the music build
ing in the near future.
Campus Drive
The great amount of traffic on

campus has caused the building
of Campus Drive, a peripheral
road system. At present it is
about half completed, stretching
from Palm Drive, around Wilbur
and ending just short of Florence
Moore Hall.
The section in front of Moore
Hall- to Lomita will be completed
in two weeks. Eventually the
road will cross Lake Lagunita,
go in back of all University build
ings. including the new medical
school for which ground has jUst
been broken, and return to Palm
Drive.
