# Indians Meet Cougars In Opening Grid Test
## Highly Ruled Stanford Team Is Slated To Take Conference Honors This Year 
### Jerry Kelly Sports Editor 
When the first whistle sounds tomorrow night \ K Spokane, 37
eager Stanford gridders, polished, spirited and anxious to play ball
after 21 intensive days of practice, meet face to face an opening test
in 1956 Pacific Coast Conference action against the "mysterious"
Washington State College Cougars.
The Stanford squad leaves for Spokane by air tonight for the

8 p.m. Saturday night encounter.
Coach ChucK Taylor reports the
Indian squad has "progressed a
good deal faster than anticipated"
and, although several key injuries
hurt, the "highly rated" team is
ready to go.
The Heat Is On
Pre-season prognosticators put
the heat on Stanford as the team
to cop PCC laurels. Taylor and
his crew realize the road to a coiv
ference title is a long one. the
competition is tops this season
and each game must be played
wholeheartedly.
Stanford has become well
known on the coast as the wide
open ball club. Utilizing the
spread-T again this season, a host
of aerials from quarterbacks Co
captain John Brodie, Jack Doug
las, Jack Taylor and Bob Nicolet
is expected.
Brodie has done everything that
Coach Taylor expected of him dur
ing the September practices, and
then some. In leading the Indians
to a late season push last year, he
completed 76 of 133 passes for a
57.1 percentage.
All-Around Squad
An all-around experienced
squad joins Brodie in quest of
Stanford's opening victory. Half
backs Paul Camera and Gordy
Young and fullback Lou Valli add
a potent running attack which
substitutes lack of real speed with
determination.
Injuries to other experienced
backs A 1 Harrington and Jeri Mc-
Millin have hampered late prac
tice sessions for both, but the pair
will be available. Fullbacks Chuck
Shea and Bob Schmidt have also
rode Ihe injury list, the latter
missing the Spokane trip.
Brodie and company will have
four lettermen roaming the end
positions, with Carl Isaacs and
Gary Van Galder drawing start
ing berths. Tackles Paul Wiggin,
an All-Ameriean choice and co
captain, and Steve Docter, the
other returning lettermen at that
position, are expected to produce
heavy duty.
The Center
Anchoring the center of the line
are guards Donn Carswell and
Noel Robinson and center Bob
Long. Another fine guard, Don
Manoukian, has been lost lot the
j season with a recurring knee in
' jury.
Out to better the 6 3-1 record
j gained last season, Coach Taylor
I expects stronger competition from
j all the coast squads, except pos
sibly UCLA. Limited knowledge
| of WSC prospects brands the Cou
i gars a "mystery" squad, even to
! their new mentor, Jim Sutherland.
In his inaugural year at Wash
ington State, Sutherland has
worked with a relatively inexperi-
I enced outfit. Nineteen lettermen
graduated last year, with only 11
to greet Sutherland Sept. 1. He
will use a split-T formation sirni
| lar to that seen at Stanford with
| the quarterback option as a potent
I force.
First Appearance
The conference tilt this year
| marks the first appearance of a
Stanford team in Spokane's Me
morial Stadium. The two foes
didn't meet last year, the Cougars
taking the edge over the Cards
here in 1954, 30 to 2(5.
Sophomore quarterback Bob
Newman has been called on by
j Coach Sutherland for the starting
jrole. Another excellent passer,
; Bunny Aldrich, a transfer from
Compton Junior College, will also
I be a Stanford threat.
Hey Alvarado and Dave Jones
are slated for the halfback posi
j tions, both speedy, and Duane
| Christensen fills the fullback slot.
| A tentative starting lineup would
, have two lettermen in the line,
Everett Gest at end and Gene
I Baker at guard, while four sopho
mores and a junior college trans
fer complete the forward wall.

captain John Brodie, Jack Doug
las, Jack Taylor and Bob Nicolet
is expected.
Brodie has done everything that
Coach Taylor expected of him dur
ing the September practices, and
then some. In leading the Indians
to a late season push last year, he
completed 76 of 133 passes for a
57.1 percentage.
All-Around Squad
An all-around experienced
squad joins Brodie in quest of
Stanford's opening victory. Half
backs Paul Camera and Gordy
Young and fullback Lou Valli add
a potent running attack which
substitutes lack of real speed with
determination.
Injuries to other experienced
backs A 1 Harrington and Jeri Mc-
Millin have hampered late prac
tice sessions for both, but the pair
will be available. Fullbacks Chuck
Shea and Bob Schmidt have also
rode Ihe injury list, the latter
missing the Spokane trip.
Brodie and company will have
four lettermen roaming the end
positions, with Carl Isaacs and
Gary Van Galder drawing start
ing berths. Tackles Paul Wiggin,
an All-Ameriean choice and co
captain, and Steve Docter, the
other returning lettermen at that
position, are expected to produce
heavy duty.
The Center
Anchoring the center of the line
are guards Donn Carswell and
Noel Robinson and center Bob
Long. Another fine guard, Don
Manoukian, has been lost lot the
j season with a recurring knee in
' jury.
Out to better the 6 3-1 record
j gained last season, Coach Taylor
I expects stronger competition from
j all the coast squads, except pos
sibly UCLA. Limited knowledge
| of WSC prospects brands the Cou
i gars a "mystery" squad, even to
! their new mentor, Jim Sutherland.
In his inaugural year at Wash
ington State, Sutherland has
worked with a relatively inexperi-
I enced outfit. Nineteen lettermen
graduated last year, with only 11
to greet Sutherland Sept. 1. He
will use a split-T formation sirni
| lar to that seen at Stanford with
| the quarterback option as a potent
I force.
First Appearance
The conference tilt this year
| marks the first appearance of a
Stanford team in Spokane's Me
morial Stadium. The two foes
didn't meet last year, the Cougars
taking the edge over the Cards
here in 1954, 30 to 2(5.
Sophomore quarterback Bob
Newman has been called on by
j Coach Sutherland for the starting
jrole. Another excellent passer,
; Bunny Aldrich, a transfer from
Compton Junior College, will also
I be a Stanford threat.
Hey Alvarado and Dave Jones
are slated for the halfback posi
j tions, both speedy, and Duane
| Christensen fills the fullback slot.
| A tentative starting lineup would
, have two lettermen in the line,
Everett Gest at end and Gene
I Baker at guard, while four sopho
mores and a junior college trans
fer complete the forward wall.

heavy duty.
The Center
Anchoring the center of the line
are guards Donn Carswell and
Noel Robinson and center Bob
Long. Another fine guard, Don
Manoukian, has been lost lot the
j season with a recurring knee in
' jury.
Out to better the 6 3-1 record
j gained last season, Coach Taylor
I expects stronger competition from
j all the coast squads, except pos
sibly UCLA. Limited knowledge
| of WSC prospects brands the Cou
i gars a "mystery" squad, even to
! their new mentor, Jim Sutherland.
In his inaugural year at Wash
ington State, Sutherland has
worked with a relatively inexperi-
I enced outfit. Nineteen lettermen
graduated last year, with only 11
to greet Sutherland Sept. 1. He
will use a split-T formation sirni
| lar to that seen at Stanford with
| the quarterback option as a potent
I force.
First Appearance
The conference tilt this year
| marks the first appearance of a
Stanford team in Spokane's Me
morial Stadium. The two foes
didn't meet last year, the Cougars
taking the edge over the Cards
here in 1954, 30 to 2(5.
Sophomore quarterback Bob
Newman has been called on by
j Coach Sutherland for the starting
jrole. Another excellent passer,
; Bunny Aldrich, a transfer from
Compton Junior College, will also
I be a Stanford threat.
Hey Alvarado and Dave Jones
are slated for the halfback posi
j tions, both speedy, and Duane
| Christensen fills the fullback slot.
| A tentative starting lineup would
, have two lettermen in the line,
Everett Gest at end and Gene
I Baker at guard, while four sopho
mores and a junior college trans
fer complete the forward wall.
