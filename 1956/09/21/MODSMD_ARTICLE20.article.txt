# Campus Keeps Jumping from Activity to Activity
## After Brief Stay, Axe Has Been Stolen 
### 
Last year, for the first time in
nine years, Stanford won the Big
Game and recovered the Axe.
During the last week of school
last spring, the Axe was stolen
from its "burglar-proof" case in
the Cellar by a person or persons
unknown.
The Axe, symbol of the Univer
sity, first appeared at a Stanford-
Cal baseball game in 1899. That
year, Cal managed to steal the
10-pound lumberman's axe and re
tained possession until 1930. This
was the year of the "Immortal
21."
In 1930, following years of frus
trated efforts on the pari of Stan
ford men to recover the Axe, 21
men who had planned for four

years to recover Stanford's sym
bol moved into action.
The 21 laid plans during their
freshman year here to get the
Axe back from Cal. For years,
the Axe had been kept at the
University of California under
lock and key. It was always well
guarded and only removed from
its vault during athletic events
with Stanford, notably football
games.
Perfecting their plans over a
four-year period, while maintain
ing the strictest secrecy, the 21
moved in separate cars to Berke
ley where Cal was going to return
the Axe to its bank vault follow
ing a rally.
They were equipped with an
auto rigged out as a camera car.

When the armored car arrived
with the Axe, the fake camera
crew loudly demanded that they
be given a clear view of the Axe.
One of the 21 dropped on the
unsuspecting custodian of the
Axe and passed it to one of his
friends. This man tucked the Axe
under his sweater and calmly
walked to the "camera" car. One
of the others dropped a tear gas
bomb in the midst of the crowd,
and the men made their escape.
The 21 were soon known as
the "Immortal 21" and were
wined and dined by the entire stu
dent body. The date was April 3,
1930.

21."
In 1930, following years of frus
trated efforts on the pari of Stan
ford men to recover the Axe, 21
men who had planned for four

years to recover Stanford's sym
bol moved into action.
The 21 laid plans during their
freshman year here to get the
Axe back from Cal. For years,
the Axe had been kept at the
University of California under
lock and key. It was always well
guarded and only removed from
its vault during athletic events
with Stanford, notably football
games.
Perfecting their plans over a
four-year period, while maintain
ing the strictest secrecy, the 21
moved in separate cars to Berke
ley where Cal was going to return
the Axe to its bank vault follow
ing a rally.
They were equipped with an
auto rigged out as a camera car.

When the armored car arrived
with the Axe, the fake camera
crew loudly demanded that they
be given a clear view of the Axe.
One of the 21 dropped on the
unsuspecting custodian of the
Axe and passed it to one of his
friends. This man tucked the Axe
under his sweater and calmly
walked to the "camera" car. One
of the others dropped a tear gas
bomb in the midst of the crowd,
and the men made their escape.
The 21 were soon known as
the "Immortal 21" and were
wined and dined by the entire stu
dent body. The date was April 3,
1930.
