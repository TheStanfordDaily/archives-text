### 
What are the reactions of stu
dents when lhey first come to
Stanford?
Yesterday about 1300 freshmen
and many of their parents des
cended upon the Stanford cam
pus. Many of them had not been
on the campus more than an hour
when they gave the following re
actions to their new University:
Kate Yanaga, Honolulu, Koble:
"I am greatly impressed by how
friendly everyone is here. I have
always wanted to go to Stanford
as long as I have wanted to go to
college."
Caiuillc Peterson, Clarkston,
Wash., Roble: "All the upper
classmen were so friendlyâ€”wait
ing outside to help us get ac
quainted. I plan to use the educa
tion Stanford offers to get broad
er background for my field of
journalism. I hope some day to
be able to give back to Stanford
something in return for what it
has given me."
Carolyn Hess, San Marino, Ro
ble: "1 just love Stanford. I know
it sounds trite to say it, but that
is the first thing that comes into
my mind. I expect Stanford will
broaden my scope and make me
more able to meet people."
Itill Layman, West Covina,
Soto: "1 consider Stanford the
best for my mechanical engineer
ing major. Stanford and Cal Tech
have the best reputation on the
West Coast as engineering
schools and at Stanford you get
a more rounded education."
Stew Brand, Rockford, 111.,
Soto: "1 picked Stanford because
I considered it the best on the
West Coast. And I can't stand the
East. Can you imagine having to
spend four years in Boston?"
Jim Kortli, Medford, Ore., Tran
cos: "Everyone talked to me
about Stanford and recommended
it as one of the top schools in the
country. I saw the campus during

the summer and that definitely
set me on Stanford."
Norm Larson, San Jose, Soto:
"I picked Stanford because I like
the idea of a private school free
of regulation from the stale. Liv
ing so close to Stanford, I have
seen the campus many times and
have always looked forward to
going to it."
Frank Kelly, Houston, Tex.,
Soto: "Stanford is definitely the
best in the West. There is nothing
like it even in Texas. The Univer
sity of Texas has 17,000 students
which is too big. Stanford is just
the right size."
Joe Mclntire, Pasadena, Soto:
"I am a pre med major and Stan
ford has a superior medical
school. I thought the campus is
very beautiful and I can hardly
wait to play that golf course."
Todd Huntington, Los Angeles,
Trancos: "1 like the atmosphere
much better than the L.A. schools.
I saw the USC and UCLA cam
puses and didn't care for them at
all."
Bill Lindsay, Santa Ana, Soto:
"I hadn't really decided on Stan
ford until I saw the campus last
Easter. And that convinced me
that Stanford was the school for
me."
Tom Lief, Quito, Kcuaior, Soto:
"I lived on the West Coast all my
life until I moved down to Ecua
dor and have always thought
about Stanford. Its engineering
school is superior to anything on
the Coast.
Meroe Harvey, Omaha, Neb.,
Branner: "The beautiful weather
here and the greenness of the
campus impressed me most this
morning. But I wanted to come to
Stanford not because of this but
because I wanted to graduate
from a fine Western coeduca
tional college."
Susan Phillips, Alhamhra, Bran
ner: "I was impressed with the
number of people I have met
from widely separated parts of
the country. Also I think the Pre-

Reg Committee has gone to a
great deal ol work to make us
feel welcome and 1 am impressed
with that."
Karen D'cker, Salinas, Bran
ner: "People all over the campus
as well as here in the dorm have
been wonderfully helpful this
morning which has impressed me,
but 1 was even more impressed
with the great numbers of people
here. There certainly is a great
opportunity for faking friends
here which adds greatly to my
formal education."
Laurie Lindauer, St. Louis, Mo.,
Brainier: "The enormity of the
Stanford Campus impressed me.
In such a place, it won't take long
to assume the feeling of inde
pendence that I hope to acquire
from college."
('destine Finoeehio, San Fran
cisco, Brainier: "Stanford has al
ways impressed and appealed to
me mainly because there are no
sororities here. The student body
has a marvelous reputation and 1
expect to make my life - long
friends here."
Sally Drinker, Portland, Ore.,
Branner: "Stanford's architecture
impressed me immediately. It is
entirely different from what we
have in Portland. I was also im
pressed with the helpfulness of
the Pre - Reg Committee. This
friendly and helpful attitude of
the students plus the prestige of
Stanford in the educational world
and its fine climate make it an
ideal school and 1 am very happy
to he going to school here."
Susan Avery, Pelliam, N.Y.,
Branner: "I was impressed with
Stanford and the good climate of
this area for many years during
the time I used to live in Califor
nia. When it came time to pick a
college, these factors and the fact
that 1 wanted to go to a coeduca
tional school made me want to at
tend Stanford if possible."
Margie Waite, Riverside, Bran
ner: "The first thing that im
pressed me about Stanford this
morning was the friendliness of
ali the people here. This, plus the
fact that a degree from Stanford
will mean a lot to m'e, make me
very happy that I was able to
come here."
Kay Germain, Seattle, Wash.,
Branner: "The beauty of the
Stanford campus impressed me
greatly. I am very glad I chose
Stanford, not just because of this,
but because here I will get a gdod
formal education and learn to
take a better place in the commu
nity when I graduate."
