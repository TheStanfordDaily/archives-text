# Looking It Over

It's Stanford in the west, Michigan State and Ohio State in the
mid-west, Oklahoma and Texas Christian in the southwest, Maryland
and Georgia Tech in the southeast and Vale in the east as tin* 1956
powerhouses on the national football scene according to the leading
prognosticators across the land.
The names of most of these colleges have stood out as continual
favorites Saturday after Saturday for several seasons in the past,
save for Stanford and Yale. Stick with a winner, they say, and why
not? Backed by enormous student bodies, led by top-rated coaches
and financed by eager alumni, these football factories have not let
the pigskin pre-game selectors down during the years.
We don't feel qualified to look so far into the unpredictable fu
ture as to pick Stanford us the inevitable Hose Itowl choice, nor will
we predict a cl«*an Indian slate in Pacific ('oast Conference action.
The PCC is weakened, hut not so innch as the pessimistic mentors
up and down the coast lead us to believe. Stanford is strong,
stronger than last year when they finished with a 6-3-1 record, hut
we foresee stiff competition every Saturday this season.
Washington, Southern California, Oregon State, Oregon and the
Bears from Berkeley's leading university are all fielding football
squads this year, teams capable of knocking off the best in the land.
Stanford's personable coach, Chuck Taylor, hasn't written them off
because of pre-season predictions and "this PCC mess."
Yale, the othei party enjoying its first season in some years in
the preseason front ranks, may experience an undefeated season, the
"big boys" say. It shouldn't gain a bowl bid, considering the compe
tition, but we'll watch the Bulldogs, nevertheless.
Now let's swing to the mid-west, home of "big time" football
where the lads not only do or die for their Alma Mater, but for what
ever tangible is available. Here millions put their trust in eleven
men from September to January 1. Ohio State, a "dejected" team
which had a hand-slapping from Big Ten Conference officials, and
the 1956 Rose Bowl champs, Michigan State, highlight the autumn
scene again. Our Indians, God Mess them, meet both this season,
MSC here Sept. 29, and the Buckeyes at Columbus Oct. 6. OSC will
be out in full force to avenge the humiliating 6-0 defeat handed them
last season here.
The University of Michigan and Illinois loom as likely prospects
for the Rose Bowl choice. Both squads have improved and arc anx
ious to unharness MSC's and OSC's supremacy in Big Ten action.
In such a tough league, anything can happen.
It seems to be almost unanimous that Oklahoma, excellently
bundled by the capable Bud Wilkinson and Ibis year led by half
back Tommy McDonald, should he rated the nation's hesi. The
Sooners play classy, rough-'n' tough loot had and post season tilts
have proved their ability against other sectional leaders.
And, oh how the southwest plays open football. Anything can
happen arid usually does. Texas Christian, another institution warned
for illegal practices (but they all remain up there), is led by a
coaches' dream of a runner, Jim Swink. Another top team, Texas
A&M, is destined for a fine season and rates a toss-up for the South
western Conference title. Just as in pro football, a cellar-dweller
could ruin the league-leaders' hopes of a perfect: season or a confer
ence cup.
Coach Bobby Dodd brings forth a Georgia Tech eleven raring to
go at Southeastern Conference toes. Tech hopes for an undefeated
season, in the league of many schools, but not so much talent. The
Sugar Bowl victors must first beat a Texas outfit, Southern Metho
dist.
So there you have it: a brief sketch of the nation's teams to watch.
Keep your eyes first and foremost on Stanford, of course, and the
Pacific Coaast Conference. Each Friday we'll comment briefly on
Saturday's headliners across the nation and add our two cents' worth
as the season progresses.
Daily Predictions for Saturday, S<>jtt. 22
STANFORD over Washington State It's not loyalty that com
mands the pen, but rather supreme confidence in the i'ired up Indians
over a not-so-experienced Cougar eleven.
OREGON STATE over Missouri Despite big expectations at
Ol' Mo, we pick a worthy OSC squad to dampen Missouri's opener.
WASHINGTON over Idaho The Huskies are no weaklings and
may well be the surprise on the coast this year. Darrell Royal will
have a good deal to be happy about after his initial game as Husky
mentor.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA over Texas Here's a tough one, but
the nod goes to USC, a potentially stronger team than the one which
lost some close ones in PCC action last year.
OREGON over Colorado The Ducks, too, have secret plans for
a successful season and bank heavily on the opening intersectional as
a test.
UC LA over Utah— Looks like we're stuck on the coast teams, but
we feel the Bruins will start things oft right in their opener against
the Utes tonight in Los Angeles. Sophomores or not in the starting
line-up, the UCLANS are perennially strong.
