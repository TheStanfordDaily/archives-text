# Brodie, Wiggin Elected Grid Captains
## All-Americans To Lead Stanford In '56 Campaign 
### Jackson Rannells 
Tackle Paul Wiggin and quar
terback John Brodie, Stanford's
leading 1956 All-American candi
dates, were selected season co-cap
tains of the 1956 Indian varsity in
a secret ballot of team members
yesterday prior to their final
home practice in preparation for
Saturday night's season opener
against Washington State at Spo
kane.
Wiggin, who was selected to the
Associated Press All - American
first squad and the official All-
Coast squad at the close of the
1955 season, has had things pretty
much his own way since matricu
lating at the Farm. Hailing from
Lathrop, California, Paul spent a
year at Modesto JC before com
ing to Stanford. •
Shoulder Injury
After sitting out the 1953 sea
son with a severe shoulder injury,
he wasted no time in making his
way into the first-string right
tackle spot in 1954. Paul played
in every game and was sixth on
the squad in time played for the
season. His outstanding perform
ance in last season's nationally tel
evised 6-0 upset of Ohio State's
Big Ten champions put him in the
national spotlight and started him
on his way to Ail-American ac
claim; but the G ft. 3 in. 228-
pounder did not let down after
this game. He rocked and rolled
for a terrifying 390 minutes to
end up sixth in time played again.
John Brodie's trail at Stanford
hys been a little rougher, but from
mid-season last year he has (level
oped into one of the nation's lead
ing passers and play callers.
' Shared Duties
Forced during his sophomore
year to share the quarterbacking
duties with the more experienced
Jerry Gustafson, John laced the
1955 season with the same pros
pects. Brodie yielded to Gustaf
son, who had a sensational day in
the Ohio State game, but he took
over against Michigan State and
was No. 1 man throughout I lie
rest of the season.
Despite t his late emergence
John completed 7G passes in 133
attempts for 1024 yards, 5 touch
downs, and a 57.1 per cent com
pletion average. This perform
ance gave him a ranking of fourth
in the nation in passing and lifted
him to the leadership of the PCX'
in passing yardage and total of
fensive yardage.
The amazingly low 7 intercep
tions during the 1955 season was
another feather in John's hat and
this was the indicator of his crim
ing of age as a passer. It is this
passing—short, medium, and lop,"
— a 38.5 punting average, and his
inborn leadership ability that have
led to Brodie's nomination on sev
eral pre-season All-American
squads.
