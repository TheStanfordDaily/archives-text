# Taylor Urges Team Support; Freshman Enthusiasm Needed
## traditional Student Participation at Practices Outlined as Weekly Tuesday Stanford Activity 
### 
"Colleges today lack the enthusiasm I saw as a student at Stan
ford," football coach Chuck Taylor regrets. "Someone told me il
was because there exists too sophisticated an air," he continued.
| Coming from a coach as highly respected as Chuck Taylor, this is
! hard to take, but the facts remain: campus activity across the land
in respect to football rallies and '

game enthusiasm has dropped.
Taylor was directing his com
ments to the incoming freshmen
when he advocated a strong team
backing, win or lose. He said:
"The student body should be
! proud, and display that pride, if
their team exerts a good effort.
Without the added spice of en
thusiastic grandstand backing and
pre - game enthusiasm, Stanford
' football would become a dull rou
tine affair for the players."
The popular football mentor,
Coach of the Year in 1951, advises
freshmen not to forget their stud-1
ies as their primary responsibility,
but to select some extracurricular j
: activity in addition, possibly as
the "grid backer."
One such plan outlined by Tay
lor, which will include the whole [
Stanford student body and beâ– 
greatly appreciated by the coach
ing staff and players alike, will be
a traditional student participation
in grid practice sessions each
Tuesday afternoon d u ring the
season.
During the pigskin drills, the
coaching staff will explain the
fundamentals of the game and the
activities on the practice field.
Known as an optimistic grid
mentor,'Taylor believes there is I
nothing wrong in taking a licking
if his squad comes forth with an
honest effort. "Disappointments
should only be momentary," he
' said, "if Stanford loses to a better
squad."
