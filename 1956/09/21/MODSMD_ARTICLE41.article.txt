House, once the home of Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority, mirks
the visible destruction of the so
rority era.

ing unified under University own
ership and supervision.
Stanford's nine chapters lasted
for 50 years. The 10 years of that
history following 1934 were
marked with growing friction be
cause of the limits placed on the
sororities by the University. Stan
ford allowed no more than the
traditional nine chapters to oper
ate and each house was limited to
30 residents. These restrictions
made the sorority system inade
quate for the acommodation of
the University's increasing num
ber of women indergraduates.
Early in *1943 a group of 13
Roble sponsors, both sorority and
dormitory, women, wrote a letter
to.'he Board of Trustees explain
ing their dissatisfaction. The fol

April 2f>, Dr. Tresidder's an
nouncement came. He explained

women students, alumni and
friends of the University the so
rority system was found to be
"not suitable to our campus."

University dormitories named for
outstanding women associated
with the Stanford family.
