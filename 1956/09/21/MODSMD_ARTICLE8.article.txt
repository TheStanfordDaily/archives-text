"The administration," ho said,

up with a pearl" but will withhold
judgment until June, 1960.
"Keep your work and fun," ho
advised, "in such balance that all
of us can look forward to meeting
here four years from now."
"Keep your eyes on the stars,
your face to the wind and stay be
tween both fences."
