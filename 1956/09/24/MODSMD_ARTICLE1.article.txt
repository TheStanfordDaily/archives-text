## Cards Breeze By WSC, 40-26 
### Jerry Kelly, Sports Editor 
The mystery has been solved.
Scoring at will when Stanford's first string was in, Coach Chuck
Taylor's Indians used four minutes to find a major weakness in the
previously untested, mysterious Cougar squad. WSC had no defense
against the arm of Card quarterback John Brodie.
At the end of regulation play, Stanford had won by a 40-26 score.

At the point Coach Taylor started
numerous substitutions to give all
37 traveling Indians experience,
Stanford led 26-0. This came early

Brodie, excelling all pre-season

first three times they had the ball.
Two TD's came in the first period,
the third seconds after the open

for the starters.
Coach Taylor was full of praise
of his team's effort in their initial
encounter of the season. His
highly vaunted passing attack
was not to be denied as Brodie,
Jack Douglas and Jack Taylor
hurled 24 strikes on 36 attempted
passes. In addition to Brodie's
fine performance, Taylor lauded
the entire first string as well as
