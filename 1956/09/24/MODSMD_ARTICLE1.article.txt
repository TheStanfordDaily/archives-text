## Cards Breeze By WSC, 40-26 
### Jerry Kelly, Sports Editor 
The mystery has been solved.
Scoring at will when Stanford's first string was in, Coach Chuck
Taylor's Indians used four minutes to find a major weakness in the
previously untested, mysterious Cougar squad. WSC had no defense
against the arm of Card quarterback John Brodie.
At the end of regulation play, Stanford had won by a 40-26 score.

At the point Coach Taylor started
numerous substitutions to give all
37 traveling Indians experience,
Stanford led 26-0. This came early
I in the second quarter.
Brodie, excelling all pre-season
press notices, hit a phenomenal
70.8 per cent of his passes, com
pleting 17 of 24 attempts. In all
Stanford took to the air 36 times
and Washington State tried 38 ae
rials. The passing parade proved
the effects of a wide open football
game as a total of 66 points was
the result.
Going into the game, played be
fore 25,300 fans in Spokane Satur
day night, a definite favorite, the
Stanford eleven appeared a sea
soned, spirited team from the
j start. The inexperienced Cougars,
i on the othei hand, showed signs
of "the jitters" in the early stages
of the game and fumbled fre
i quently.
The relaxed Card starters didn't
let down on the Cougars in the
I opening period, scoring easily the
first three times they had the ball.
Two TD's came in the first period,
the third seconds after the open
ing of the second period.
Brodie, probably in better pass
ing form than at his height last
season, hit end Carl Isaacs in the
end zone twice for Stanford TD's,
while halfback Gordy Young tal
lied once as did fullback Lou Valli
for the starters.
Coach Taylor was full of praise
of his team's effort in their initial
encounter of the season. His
highly vaunted passing attack
was not to be denied as Brodie,
Jack Douglas and Jack Taylor
hurled 24 strikes on 36 attempted
passes. In addition to Brodie's
fine performance, Taylor lauded
the entire first string as well as
substitutes Chuck Shea, fullback,
A 1 Harrington, halfback, and Bob
Peterson, guard.
Michigan State Next
The Indians return to home
grounds this week with a home
opener scheduled against the
cream of the Midwest, Michigan
State College. Taylor sends his
injury - less Indian crew in full
force against the Rose Bowl vic
tors Saturday at 2 p.m.
Lou Valli started things rolling
for the Indians after WSC was
forced to punt in the early min
utes of the tilt. Valli took a Cou
gar punt and returned 44 yards to
the WSC 27. Seven plays later
Valli plowed over from five yards
out.
Mike Raftery's try for point
failed and Stanford led, 6-0, after
four minutes of play.
A minute later Stanford again
had their hands on the ball on
their own 48 and went the dis
tance in 10 plays, Brodie hitting
Paul Camera, Young and Valli in
the drive. Young went into the
end zone for his second time in
the evening, but again his effort
was nullified by a penalty. A
sharp Brodie to Isaacs pass
clicked for six more on the next
play. Doug Dick booted the extra
point.
The over-anxious Cougars fum
bled in the waning minutes of the
initial period and the Indians
pounced on the ball. From 28
yards out, Brodie hit Gary Van
Galder for 12, and Jack Fries for
another 14. Young was given
credit for his first official TD on
a one-yard plunge with but five
seconds gone in the second period.
Isaacs Intercepts
Showing aggressiveness on de
fense as well as an aerial snag
ger, Isaacs intercepted a WSC
pass in the second quarter and re
turned to the Cougar 12. The In
dians were on the trail again.
Third - string quarterback Jack
Taylor hit John Kifld, a tackle
playing an end position on the
weak side in another Taylor in
novation, for a touchdown. Raft
ery connected in his extra-point
attempt for a 26-0 score.
Substituting his reserves freely,
Taylor used a mixture of second
and third-string gridsters when
Cougar quarterbacks Bobby New
man and Bunny Aldrieh began
hitting the aerial mark with con
sistency. The game Cougars, a
definite threat in later Coast Con
ference tilts affer some seasoning,
began marches of 64 and 76 yards.
Newman passed to Bill Steiger
for one and Newman converted.
Pass Interference
Stanford was called for pass
interference late in first half and
WSC was given the ball on the
Indian one-yard line. Aldrieh
shuffled over for a 26-13 halftime
count.
In the second half Taylor con
tinued to use his regulars spar
ingly. Brodie engineered SU's
first second-half tally, capping a
68-yard drive with a 10-yard pass
to Isaacs in paydirt. Young trav

eled 31 yards in the quick move.
Brodie's number one under
study, Jack Douglas, hit end Jack
Fries from four yards out after a
32-yard drive. Armand DeWeese
converted. For the third succes
sive period, the Cards tallied two
TD's per quarter.
Chuck Morrell scooted 16 yards
for a VVSC score in the fourth
quarter and fullback Ed Stevens
went over from three yards out
for the final WSC counters just
before the game's end.

The Indians return to home
grounds this week with a home
opener scheduled against the
cream of the Midwest, Michigan
State College. Taylor sends his
injury - less Indian crew in full
force against the Rose Bowl vic
tors Saturday at 2 p.m.
Lou Valli started things rolling
for the Indians after WSC was
forced to punt in the early min
utes of the tilt. Valli took a Cou
gar punt and returned 44 yards to
the WSC 27. Seven plays later
Valli plowed over from five yards
out.
Mike Raftery's try for point
failed and Stanford led, 6-0, after
four minutes of play.
A minute later Stanford again
had their hands on the ball on
their own 48 and went the dis
tance in 10 plays, Brodie hitting
Paul Camera, Young and Valli in
the drive. Young went into the
end zone for his second time in
the evening, but again his effort
was nullified by a penalty. A
sharp Brodie to Isaacs pass
clicked for six more on the next
play. Doug Dick booted the extra
point.
The over-anxious Cougars fum
bled in the waning minutes of the
initial period and the Indians
pounced on the ball. From 28
yards out, Brodie hit Gary Van
Galder for 12, and Jack Fries for
another 14. Young was given
credit for his first official TD on
a one-yard plunge with but five
seconds gone in the second period.
Isaacs Intercepts
Showing aggressiveness on de
fense as well as an aerial snag
ger, Isaacs intercepted a WSC
pass in the second quarter and re
turned to the Cougar 12. The In
dians were on the trail again.
Third - string quarterback Jack
Taylor hit John Kifld, a tackle
playing an end position on the
weak side in another Taylor in
novation, for a touchdown. Raft
ery connected in his extra-point
attempt for a 26-0 score.
Substituting his reserves freely,
Taylor used a mixture of second
and third-string gridsters when
Cougar quarterbacks Bobby New
man and Bunny Aldrieh began
hitting the aerial mark with con
sistency. The game Cougars, a
definite threat in later Coast Con
ference tilts affer some seasoning,
began marches of 64 and 76 yards.
Newman passed to Bill Steiger
for one and Newman converted.
Pass Interference
Stanford was called for pass
interference late in first half and
WSC was given the ball on the
Indian one-yard line. Aldrieh
shuffled over for a 26-13 halftime
count.
In the second half Taylor con
tinued to use his regulars spar
ingly. Brodie engineered SU's
first second-half tally, capping a
68-yard drive with a 10-yard pass
to Isaacs in paydirt. Young trav

eled 31 yards in the quick move.
Brodie's number one under
study, Jack Douglas, hit end Jack
Fries from four yards out after a
32-yard drive. Armand DeWeese
converted. For the third succes
sive period, the Cards tallied two
TD's per quarter.
Chuck Morrell scooted 16 yards

The mystery has been solved.
Scoring at will when Stanford's first string was in, Coach Chuck
Taylor's Indians used four minutes to find a major weakness in the
previously untested, mysterious Cougar squad. WSC had no defense
against the arm of Card quarterback John Brodie.
At the end of regulation play, Stanford had won by a 40-26 score.

At the point Coach Taylor started
numerous substitutions to give all
37 traveling Indians experience,
Stanford led 26-0. This came early
I in the second quarter.
Brodie, excelling all pre-season
press notices, hit a phenomenal
70.8 per cent of his passes, com
pleting 17 of 24 attempts. In all
Stanford took to the air 36 times
and Washington State tried 38 ae
rials. The passing parade proved
the effects of a wide open football
game as a total of 66 points was
the result.
Going into the game, played be
fore 25,300 fans in Spokane Satur
day night, a definite favorite, the
Stanford eleven appeared a sea
soned, spirited team from the
j start. The inexperienced Cougars,
i on the othei hand, showed signs
of "the jitters" in the early stages
of the game and fumbled fre
i quently.
The relaxed Card starters didn't
let down on the Cougars in the
I opening period, scoring easily the
first three times they had the ball.
Two TD's came in the first period,
the third seconds after the open
ing of the second period.
Brodie, probably in better pass
ing form than at his height last
season, hit end Carl Isaacs in the
end zone twice for Stanford TD's,
while halfback Gordy Young tal
lied once as did fullback Lou Valli
for the starters.
Coach Taylor was full of praise
of his team's effort in their initial
encounter of the season. His
highly vaunted passing attack
was not to be denied as Brodie,
Jack Douglas and Jack Taylor
hurled 24 strikes on 36 attempted
passes. In addition to Brodie's
fine performance, Taylor lauded
the entire first string as well as
substitutes Chuck Shea, fullback,
A 1 Harrington, halfback, and Bob
Peterson, guard.

The mystery has been solved.
Scoring at will when Stanford's first string was in, Coach Chuck
Taylor's Indians used four minutes to find a major weakness in the
previously untested, mysterious Cougar squad. WSC had no defense
against the arm of Card quarterback John Brodie.
At the end of regulation play, Stanford had won by a 40-26 score.

At the point Coach Taylor started
numerous substitutions to give all
37 traveling Indians experience,
Stanford led 26-0. This came early
I in the second quarter.
Brodie, excelling all pre-season
press notices, hit a phenomenal
70.8 per cent of his passes, com
pleting 17 of 24 attempts. In all
Stanford took to the air 36 times
and Washington State tried 38 ae
rials. The passing parade proved
the effects of a wide open football
game as a total of 66 points was
the result.
Going into the game, played be
fore 25,300 fans in Spokane Satur
day night, a definite favorite, the
Stanford eleven appeared a sea
soned, spirited team from the
j start. The inexperienced Cougars,
i on the othei hand, showed signs
of "the jitters" in the early stages
of the game and fumbled fre
i quently.
The relaxed Card starters didn't
let down on the Cougars in the
I opening period, scoring easily the
first three times they had the ball.
Two TD's came in the first period,
the third seconds after the open
ing of the second period.
Brodie, probably in better pass
ing form than at his height last
season, hit end Carl Isaacs in the
end zone twice for Stanford TD's,
while halfback Gordy Young tal
lied once as did fullback Lou Valli
for the starters.
Coach Taylor was full of praise
of his team's effort in their initial
encounter of the season. His
highly vaunted passing attack
was not to be denied as Brodie,
Jack Douglas and Jack Taylor
hurled 24 strikes on 36 attempted
passes. In addition to Brodie's
fine performance, Taylor lauded
the entire first string as well as
substitutes Chuck Shea, fullback,
A 1 Harrington, halfback, and Bob
Peterson, guard.
Michigan State Next
The Indians return to home
grounds this week with a home
opener scheduled against the
cream of the Midwest, Michigan
State College. Taylor sends his
injury - less Indian crew in full
force against the Rose Bowl vic
tors Saturday at 2 p.m.
Lou Valli started things rolling
for the Indians after WSC was
forced to punt in the early min
utes of the tilt. Valli took a Cou
gar punt and returned 44 yards to
the WSC 27. Seven plays later
Valli plowed over from five yards
out.
Mike Raftery's try for point
failed and Stanford led, 6-0, after
four minutes of play.
A minute later Stanford again
had their hands on the ball on
their own 48 and went the dis
tance in 10 plays, Brodie hitting
Paul Camera, Young and Valli in
the drive. Young went into the
end zone for his second time in
the evening, but again his effort
was nullified by a penalty. A
sharp Brodie to Isaacs pass
clicked for six more on the next
play. Doug Dick booted the extra
point.
The over-anxious Cougars fum
bled in the waning minutes of the
initial period and the Indians
pounced on the ball. From 28
yards out, Brodie hit Gary Van
Galder for 12, and Jack Fries for
another 14. Young was given
credit for his first official TD on
a one-yard plunge with but five
seconds gone in the second period.
Isaacs Intercepts
Showing aggressiveness on de
fense as well as an aerial snag
ger, Isaacs intercepted a WSC
pass in the second quarter and re
turned to the Cougar 12. The In
dians were on the trail again.
Third - string quarterback Jack
Taylor hit John Kifld, a tackle
playing an end position on the
weak side in another Taylor in
novation, for a touchdown. Raft
ery connected in his extra-point
attempt for a 26-0 score.
Substituting his reserves freely,
Taylor used a mixture of second
and third-string gridsters when
Cougar quarterbacks Bobby New
man and Bunny Aldrieh began
hitting the aerial mark with con
sistency. The game Cougars, a
definite threat in later Coast Con
ference tilts affer some seasoning,
began marches of 64 and 76 yards.

The mystery has been solved.
Scoring at will when Stanford's first string was in, Coach Chuck
Taylor's Indians used four minutes to find a major weakness in the
previously untested, mysterious Cougar squad. WSC had no defense
against the arm of Card quarterback John Brodie.
At the end of regulation play, Stanford had won by a 40-26 score.

At the point Coach Taylor started
numerous substitutions to give all
37 traveling Indians experience,
Stanford led 26-0. This came early
I in the second quarter.
Brodie, excelling all pre-season
press notices, hit a phenomenal
70.8 per cent of his passes, com
pleting 17 of 24 attempts. In all
Stanford took to the air 36 times
and Washington State tried 38 ae
rials. The passing parade proved
the effects of a wide open football
game as a total of 66 points was
the result.
Going into the game, played be
fore 25,300 fans in Spokane Satur
day night, a definite favorite, the
Stanford eleven appeared a sea
soned, spirited team from the
j start. The inexperienced Cougars,
i on the othei hand, showed signs
of "the jitters" in the early stages
of the game and fumbled fre
i quently.
The relaxed Card starters didn't
let down on the Cougars in the
I opening period, scoring easily the
first three times they had the ball.
Two TD's came in the first period,
the third seconds after the open
ing of the second period.
Brodie, probably in better pass
ing form than at his height last
season, hit end Carl Isaacs in the
end zone twice for Stanford TD's,
while halfback Gordy Young tal
lied once as did fullback Lou Valli
for the starters.
Coach Taylor was full of praise
of his team's effort in their initial
encounter of the season. His
highly vaunted passing attack
was not to be denied as Brodie,
Jack Douglas and Jack Taylor
hurled 24 strikes on 36 attempted
passes. In addition to Brodie's
fine performance, Taylor lauded
the entire first string as well as
substitutes Chuck Shea, fullback,
A 1 Harrington, halfback, and Bob
Peterson, guard.
Michigan State Next
The Indians return to home
grounds this week with a home
opener scheduled against the
cream of the Midwest, Michigan
State College. Taylor sends his
injury - less Indian crew in full
force against the Rose Bowl vic
tors Saturday at 2 p.m.
Lou Valli started things rolling
for the Indians after WSC was
forced to punt in the early min
utes of the tilt. Valli took a Cou
gar punt and returned 44 yards to
the WSC 27. Seven plays later
Valli plowed over from five yards
out.
Mike Raftery's try for point
failed and Stanford led, 6-0, after
four minutes of play.
A minute later Stanford again
had their hands on the ball on
their own 48 and went the dis
tance in 10 plays, Brodie hitting
Paul Camera, Young and Valli in
the drive. Young went into the
end zone for his second time in
the evening, but again his effort
was nullified by a penalty. A
sharp Brodie to Isaacs pass
clicked for six more on the next
play. Doug Dick booted the extra
point.
The over-anxious Cougars fum
bled in the waning minutes of the
initial period and the Indians
pounced on the ball. From 28
yards out, Brodie hit Gary Van
Galder for 12, and Jack Fries for
another 14. Young was given
credit for his first official TD on
a one-yard plunge with but five
seconds gone in the second period.
Isaacs Intercepts
Showing aggressiveness on de
fense as well as an aerial snag
ger, Isaacs intercepted a WSC
pass in the second quarter and re
turned to the Cougar 12. The In
dians were on the trail again.
Third - string quarterback Jack
Taylor hit John Kifld, a tackle
playing an end position on the
weak side in another Taylor in
novation, for a touchdown. Raft
ery connected in his extra-point
attempt for a 26-0 score.
Substituting his reserves freely,
Taylor used a mixture of second
and third-string gridsters when
Cougar quarterbacks Bobby New
man and Bunny Aldrieh began
hitting the aerial mark with con
sistency. The game Cougars, a
definite threat in later Coast Con
ference tilts affer some seasoning,
began marches of 64 and 76 yards.
Newman passed to Bill Steiger
for one and Newman converted.
Pass Interference
Stanford was called for pass
interference late in first half and
WSC was given the ball on the
Indian one-yard line. Aldrieh
shuffled over for a 26-13 halftime
count.
In the second half Taylor con
tinued to use his regulars spar
ingly. Brodie engineered SU's
first second-half tally, capping a
68-yard drive with a 10-yard pass
to Isaacs in paydirt. Young trav

eled 31 yards in the quick move.
Brodie's number one under
study, Jack Douglas, hit end Jack
Fries from four yards out after a
32-yard drive. Armand DeWeese
converted. For the third succes
sive period, the Cards tallied two
TD's per quarter.
Chuck Morrell scooted 16 yards
for a VVSC score in the fourth
quarter and fullback Ed Stevens
went over from three yards out
for the final WSC counters just
before the game's end.

The mystery has been solved.
Scoring at will when Stanford's first string was in, Coach Chuck
Taylor's Indians used four minutes to find a major weakness in the
previously untested, mysterious Cougar squad. WSC had no defense
against the arm of Card quarterback John Brodie.
At the end of regulation play, Stanford had won by a 40-26 score.

At the point Coach Taylor started
numerous substitutions to give all
37 traveling Indians experience,
Stanford led 26-0. This came early
I in the second quarter.
Brodie, excelling all pre-season
press notices, hit a phenomenal
70.8 per cent of his passes, com
pleting 17 of 24 attempts. In all
Stanford took to the air 36 times
and Washington State tried 38 ae
rials. The passing parade proved
the effects of a wide open football
game as a total of 66 points was
the result.
Going into the game, played be
fore 25,300 fans in Spokane Satur
day night, a definite favorite, the
Stanford eleven appeared a sea
soned, spirited team from the
j start. The inexperienced Cougars,
i on the othei hand, showed signs
of "the jitters" in the early stages
of the game and fumbled fre
i quently.
The relaxed Card starters didn't
let down on the Cougars in the
I opening period, scoring easily the
first three times they had the ball.
Two TD's came in the first period,
the third seconds after the open
ing of the second period.
Brodie, probably in better pass
ing form than at his height last
season, hit end Carl Isaacs in the
end zone twice for Stanford TD's,
while halfback Gordy Young tal
lied once as did fullback Lou Valli
for the starters.
Coach Taylor was full of praise
of his team's effort in their initial
encounter of the season. His
highly vaunted passing attack
was not to be denied as Brodie,
Jack Douglas and Jack Taylor
hurled 24 strikes on 36 attempted
passes. In addition to Brodie's
fine performance, Taylor lauded
the entire first string as well as
substitutes Chuck Shea, fullback,
A 1 Harrington, halfback, and Bob
Peterson, guard.
Michigan State Next
The Indians return to home
grounds this week with a home
opener scheduled against the
cream of the Midwest, Michigan
State College. Taylor sends his
injury - less Indian crew in full
force against the Rose Bowl vic
tors Saturday at 2 p.m.
Lou Valli started things rolling
for the Indians after WSC was
forced to punt in the early min
utes of the tilt. Valli took a Cou
gar punt and returned 44 yards to
the WSC 27. Seven plays later
Valli plowed over from five yards
out.
Mike Raftery's try for point
failed and Stanford led, 6-0, after
four minutes of play.
A minute later Stanford again
had their hands on the ball on
their own 48 and went the dis
tance in 10 plays, Brodie hitting
Paul Camera, Young and Valli in
the drive. Young went into the
end zone for his second time in
the evening, but again his effort
was nullified by a penalty. A
sharp Brodie to Isaacs pass
clicked for six more on the next
play. Doug Dick booted the extra
point.
The over-anxious Cougars fum
bled in the waning minutes of the
initial period and the Indians
pounced on the ball. From 28
yards out, Brodie hit Gary Van
Galder for 12, and Jack Fries for
another 14. Young was given
credit for his first official TD on
a one-yard plunge with but five
seconds gone in the second period.
Isaacs Intercepts
Showing aggressiveness on de
fense as well as an aerial snag
ger, Isaacs intercepted a WSC
pass in the second quarter and re
turned to the Cougar 12. The In
dians were on the trail again.
Third - string quarterback Jack
Taylor hit John Kifld, a tackle
playing an end position on the
weak side in another Taylor in
novation, for a touchdown. Raft
ery connected in his extra-point
attempt for a 26-0 score.
Substituting his reserves freely,
Taylor used a mixture of second
and third-string gridsters when
Cougar quarterbacks Bobby New
man and Bunny Aldrieh began
hitting the aerial mark with con
sistency. The game Cougars, a
definite threat in later Coast Con
ference tilts affer some seasoning,
began marches of 64 and 76 yards.
Newman passed to Bill Steiger
for one and Newman converted.
Pass Interference
Stanford was called for pass
interference late in first half and
WSC was given the ball on the
Indian one-yard line. Aldrieh
shuffled over for a 26-13 halftime
count.
In the second half Taylor con
tinued to use his regulars spar
ingly. Brodie engineered SU's
first second-half tally, capping a
68-yard drive with a 10-yard pass
to Isaacs in paydirt. Young trav

eled 31 yards in the quick move.
Brodie's number one under
study, Jack Douglas, hit end Jack
Fries from four yards out after a
32-yard drive. Armand DeWeese
converted. For the third succes
sive period, the Cards tallied two
TD's per quarter.
Chuck Morrell scooted 16 yards
for a VVSC score in the fourth
quarter and fullback Ed Stevens
went over from three yards out
for the final WSC counters just
before the game's end.
