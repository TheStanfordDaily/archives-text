# Immortal Six' Gives Encina Face Lifting
## Stern Men Decorate 'Girl's' Dorm Crepe Paper, Flowers Festoon 65-Year-Old Men's Dormitory 
### 
Women in Enclna.
"What is this?" wondered six
Stanford men residing in Stern
Hall. "We must he ahle to do
something to 'help' those poor
women who have to live in Encina
for a couple of weeks while their
wings at Moore Hall are finished."
And so they did. The "Immortal
Six" almost simultaneously con
ceived a plan to decorate the (53-
year-old "men's" dormitory.
On Saturday they gathered
their material—crepe paper, flow
ers and literature. That night at
10:10 they "sneaked" in the front
door and began their interior dec
orating.
At that time there were 11 wom
en in the building who were ready
ing it for opening Sunday morn
ing. According to Alondra Wing
president Suzi Wyle, the 11 wom
en did nothing to stop the Stern
men. The work was finished at
midnight.
Immortal Six
The "Immortal Six"—Ed Butler,
Duke Campbell, Jim Dunlap,
Bob McFatiand and A 1 Wilhelm —
began by decorating the lobby
with pink and white crepe paper
and flower s. "Sympathy" and
"Welcome to Your New Home"
cards were attached to the huge
columns in the main hall also.
Upstairs on the second floor of
the five-story former men's dorm,
the six renovated the east-wing
lavatory with flowers and crepe
paper also.
Sunday morning the remainder
of the 100 women of Alondra and
Paloma wings of Florence Moore
Hall moved into Encina anxiously
awaiting the completion of their
new dormitory facilities.
Pleasant Stay
The gesture made by the "Tm
mortal Six" impressed the women
so much that they now claim their
stay at Encina will bo much more
pleasant.
"It pleased us all," said Miss
Wyle, who spoke for the "girls of
Encina." "It was in good taste,
and the pink and white crepe
paper . . . well, it boosted our
morale in Encina."
And to cement their kindness,
the Stern men returned Sunday
morning to help the women move
in. They acted as bellhops all day
carrying trunks and suitcases into
the pink-laced dorm.
Simultaneous Id«*a
According to Campbell, one of
the six, three of them had simul
taneously hit on the idea of deco
rating Encina for the women who
were to temporarily occupy it. He
added that three others were
asked to join their "plot" and
quickly accepted the task.
Until the wings at Moore Hall
are finished, the women of Encina
will use car pools to reach their
dining halls at Moore. Moore Hall
has a central kitchen with seven
dining rooms for the seven living
units.
When the wings of Alondra and
Paloma are finished, the women
will move out of Encina and the
once-great men's dormitory will
again become vacant since it was
emptied last winter quarter.
