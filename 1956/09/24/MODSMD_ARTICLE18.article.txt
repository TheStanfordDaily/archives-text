# A 						Statement of Policy
## 
### 
With the beginning of a new volume of The
Daily under the direction of a new editorial
board; we feel it proper to outline the policy
under which this paper will be published.
I lie fundamental policy of The Daily changes
little from volume to volume; it remains that
of chronicling, interpreting and explaining
news that is of interest and importance to its
10,.100 readers. Throughout Volume 130, we
shall endeavor to put this policy into print.
Stanford is a "one paper community," and
recognizing this, we acknowledge our responsi
bility and obligation to provide our readers
with full knowledge of campus happenings, hut
because our paper is usually limited to four or
six pages, we must devote our attention pri
marily to news that is of general interest to the
whole campus. As any newspaper, we deal with
news, not publicity.
We also acknowledge our responsibility to
give ample coverage of national and interna
tional affairs, for we are dealing with a uni
versity audience that is as interested in, and
affected by, world problems as it is those of a
local nature.
I he editorial columns, but certainly not the
news columns, will reflect the editorial voice of
I lie Daily. I he final policy is decided by the
c.liN • r with the help and advice of the editorial
bo aid which consists of the editor, managing

editor, associate editors and staff editor.
We recognize that we cannot and should not
reflect the opinions of all our readers, for we
are, before anything else, a newspaper whose
first obligation is always to act as an independ
ent, free-thinking voice in its community. Al
though taking a positive stand in our editorials,
we shall attempt to express hoth sides of an
issue and explain why we have adopted our
particular stand.
Knowing that there will he those who wish
to comment on current issues, we urge that they
express themselves in our ""Letters to the Edi
tor column. Here again because of the space
limitations, we request that all letters be kept
to 150 words or less and, as all other papers,
we reserve the right to select with due fairness
the letters we shall print. All letters must be
signed and phone number and address included.
1 o those who wish to talk with us, the doors
of the Shack are always open.
The Daily is more than a campus bulletin
board, for we know our readers want and de
serve more than this. It«is the whole-hearted
effort of a university newspaper staff to publish
the most thorough, the fairest and the most
polished newspaper that its collective talents
and capacities allow.
These are our goals. We shall attempt to
live up to them.
