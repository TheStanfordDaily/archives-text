# Pre-Reg Ends, Frosh Ready For Big Week
## 
### 
Some 1300 newly-arrived fresh
men begin settling down to life
on the Farm today after four days
of hectic pre-registration activi
ties.
The class of 1960, which was
welcomed to Stanford last Thurs
day by the Pre-Registration Com
mittee, begins registration today
and tomorrow in preparation for
attending their first classes at
Stanford on Wednesday.
Freshmen may purchase their
books today and tomorrow at
Room 270 on Engineering Corner.
This eliminates their having to
stand in the long lines at the
Bookstore, and thereby will help
shorten the book lines, according
to Pre-Registration Chairman
Bryant Boatwright.
Library Tours
Tours of the Main Library and
Hoover Tower also are scheduled
for today. A reception at the home
of University President and Mrs.
Wallace Sterling highlights to
morrow's program.
The Main Library tours will be
held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. today
and from 9 a.m. to noon tomor
row. Tours leave from the lobby
every 20 minutes. Boatwright re
quests that "freshmen take the
tour on the day they are not regis
tering." He also urges all fresh
men to take the tour of the Main
Library in order that they can be
come acquainted with the location
of its various departments, such
as reserved book room, reading
room and reference room.

inspection by the new students
