All those students whose names begin with
A or he should be standing around the Pavil
ion bright and early this fine morning. For an
other year is starting and it is Beg Day. We do
hope your flat feet don't get any flatter, but il
generally proves to be only a hope. Take cour
age. Later on you can sit down.
From the standpoint of activity, this is pt
irifi to be a busy week. From the standpoint
of interesting acticity, nothing.
Monday will be devoted to standing in line.
Lines for this, lines for that. In short, registra
tion day.
The Bender Boom of the Main Library is
featuring a stimulating display, which they
call "Les Architectes du Livre." For you stu
dents of Spanish, this actually has nothing to
do with your liver. Bookbindings, my friends,
bookbindings. In point of fact, 20th Century
French bookbindings.
See them, talk about them and impress
your friends.
Registration continues on Tuesday. If your
name is Aaron, you will be finished by tunc.
Registering, that is.
President Sterling is going lo give a reception
for ail new students at 3:30 this day. After all,

if you freshmen are interested in meeting peo

Black Wednesday will eventually arrive ami
with it, the start of classes. Let's not start cut
ting so early in the quarter. After all, von

Thursday, provided you haven't flunked out.
there is a fascinating display over at the Art
Gallery. Frankenstein (Alfred, that is) is said
to recommend it. We won't tell you just what
it is. I hursdav is a great day for surprises.
By Friday, you will be sick and tired of see
ing the stimulating "cliiya" used hy the dining
halls on campus. So to give you a lift, we sug
gest you sally forth to the museum and \ iew

tured this week. It is decorated by none other
than the world-famous Dresden porcelain deco

You see, you DO need an education.
