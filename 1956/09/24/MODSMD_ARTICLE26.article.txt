# PCC Outfits Prove Strong In Saturday's Opening Games
## 
### 
Despite the cut in Pacific Coast Conference player eligibility this
season, it would appear that the PCC has much stronger teams. In
the first games of the season this past week end, PCC teams as a
whole made impressive showings. The Ten had better be on
their toes when meeting west coast teams this year.
Brand-new and red-hot, the University of Washington Split-T

Machine romped to a 53-21 victory
over the University of Idaho's
strapping Vandals to add a new
luster to the debut of Washington
coach Darrell Royal.
Although they started slow on
defense, Washington's Huskies
had no cause for worry as they
racked up 27 points before Idaho
began to score. Washington hit
the midway point with a 34-14
lead.
Scampering sophomores almost
took over the second half. For
Washington, Luther Carr reeled
off 95 yards in about half a game
of action. Duane Lowell, rookie
Washington wingman, flashed
pass-catching brilliance and turn
ed in one interception that led to
a Husky touchdown.
USC Smashes Texas
USC smashed the University of
Texas in a rousing 44-20 victory.
C. R. Roberts, 205-pound junior
fullback, c r u s h e d Texas wit h
touchdown runs of 73, 50 and 74
yards.
USC also scored on a 14-yard
run by Jon Arnett, a 38-yard pass
from Arnett to Don Hickman, an
18-yard pass from Wayne Kurlack
to Hillard Hill, and a 42-yard run
back of an intercepted pass by re
serve center Walt Gorrell.
Texas pushed over two last-half
touchdowns on a 17-yard pass
from Vince Matthews to end Bob
Bryant and a 4-yard plunge by
halfback Walter Foridren.
Baylor Edges Cal
Baylor edged out the Univer
sity of California by a narrow vic
tory of 7-6. If California had not
fluffed its final drive in the last
few minutes of the game, there
might well have been a Cal win.
Baylor's halfback Del Schofner
scored on a lateral pass from
Doyle Traylor. Junior Beall added
the extra point with Traylor hold
ing. Cal scored their solitary TD
on an 11-yard pass from Gus Gia
nulius to Roger Ramseier. Cali
fornia would have at least tied
Baylor if Nat Brazill had not fum
bled the ball on the conversion.
Oregon Tramps Colorado
The University of Oregon trom
ped the University of Colorado by
a devastating score of 35-0. Fleet
halfback Jim Shanley and power
running fullback Fred Miklancic
shattered Colorado's defenses to
lead to the Oregon victory. Shan
ley, 170-pound junior, scooted 64
yards for one touchdown and
scored again on a short plunge.

The Ducks capped the win with
a touchdown in the last 30 seconds
on sophomore halfback Charles
Tourville's 9-yard romp around
right end.
OSC Over OP Mo
Oregon State was on the short
side of the statistics hut recov
ered five Missouri fumbles to
grind out a 19-13 victory in what
was predominantly an over-land
battle in Columbia, Mo.
OSC's Beavers, runners-up in
the 1955 PCC race, capitalized on
a first-quarter 5-yard line fumble
recovery to hammer over their
initial score, completed a 62-yard
pass-and-run play, tailback Joe
Francis to halfback Sam Wesley,
in the second quarter, and termi
nated the game - winning touch
down drive with a 5-yard plunge
by Francis.
UCLA 13, Utah 7
Friday night UCLA's Knox-less
Bruins topped visiting Utah, 13-7,
in a game which was not as close
as the score would indicate.
Coach Red Sanders, apparently
attempting to season the crop of
"amateurs" left him after gradu
ation and PCC penalization elimi
nated a good portion of his 1955
conference champions, used his
vaunted single-wing attack to run
up a 13-0 halftime advantage and
then coasted with reserves in the
second half, the Utes finally scor
ing in the final period.
Veteran halfback Doug Bradley
drove over from the 2 for UCLA's
initial tally, and newcomer Ed
Griffin plunged 1 yard for the
second score after a drive of 77
yards in 12 plays. The Bruins'
ground attack, with a 203-yard
pre-game record last year, rushed
for 234 yards and supplemented
this with 53 yards in the air. Utah
went for 120 and 48 yards on land
and in the air, respectively.
