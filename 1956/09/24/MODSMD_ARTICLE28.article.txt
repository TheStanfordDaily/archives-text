# Don Manoukian Given Game Ball
## 
### 
Don Manoukian, hard - luck
senior guard, was awarded the
Washington State game ball by
his victorious teammates. Don
reinsured his knee during pre
season practice and will be
forced to miss the entire season.
Don, in addition to football,
is an outstanding wrestler. He
is a strong, rugged player whom
coaches describe as "extremely
aggressive." According to the
coaching staff, "Don has a
splendid attitude toward the
game and is a fine team player."
Unable to shake the injury
jinx since his freshman year,
Manoukian appeared to be head
ing toward his best season. Dur
ing spring training he showed
more improvement than any
other guard. Don's loss was a
severe blow to both the coach
ing staff and the team. The
game ball was their way of say
ing: "We're sorry. We're going
to miss you."
