# Gordy Young Should Have His Best Year
## 
### 
As he starts what he expects to
be a "great season," Indian right
half Gordy Young is bringing a
wealth of experience to the Stan
ford backfield. Young, a senior
veteran, is starting his third year'
of varsity play here, these three
years being backed by a some
what illustrious grid record that
he brings from San Francisco
Polytech High School.
In S.F., Gordy, hailed as an "all
city" player, holds the local scor
ing record, compiled in 1952 when
he scored 120 points in eight
games. The 5-10, 180-pound back
served as president and athletic
manager of his student body,
president of the Block, his high
school athletic society, and was
elected Athlete - Scholar of the
Year for 1952-53. lie played four
full seasons in the right half and
fullback slots.
Last year, after being injured
early in the season, he was the
Indians' second highest ground
gainer. His service in eight games
saw him netting 219 yards on 47
carries, an average of 5.3 yards
per carry. In his two years as an
Indian back he has averaged 5.5
yards for each of his carries.
Football is not Gordy's only
sport. He ran track for two years
in high school, but after being in
jured both years he turned to
rugby as his second sport after
coming to the Farm. He'll be
playing his fourth year when the
season opens during the winter
quarter.
Questioned about his feelings
on the upcoming Michigan State
game, the economics major, who
scored three times in the Wash
ington State game only to have
two of his tallies re-called, com
mented, "We have a good chance."
His MSC philosophy is summed
up with, "Michigan State has
some good runners, but none so
good they can't be held by the
Indian line."
