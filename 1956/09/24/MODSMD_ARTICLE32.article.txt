# Moving Into Encinca Was Not So Bad After
## 'Immortal Six' Leave Impression 
### 
"Que sera, sera."
What will be. will be. And the six Stern Hall
men saw to that Saturday night when they deco
rated the half-century-old men's dormitory with
pink and white crepe paper in honor of the some
100 Stanford women now temporarily occupy
ing it.
Their interior decorating included the spread
ing of flowers in the lobby and the second-floor
lavoratory, commonly called "the John" by all
Encina occupants.
Also in the lobby were "Welcome to Your New
Home" and "Our Sympathy" cards.
In the upstairs restroom the "Immortal Six"
placed colored rocks that are normally found in
fishbowls in the sink. They expertly decorated,
with pink and white crepe paper, the doors to
the toilet stalls.
On each of the doors they hung lollipops with
the inscription — "While Waiting ... a Pause
That Refreshes." In each of the stalls one could
find copies of either Life, Playboy or Classic
Comics.

Over the urinals, which were decorated with
beautiful flowers, could be found the following
"Watering Instructions":
1. Pull handle twice daily.
2. The best watering time is just before sun
rise and after sundown.
3. Do no<" neglect these plants. Treat them as
you would in your own home.
Candles for use in emergency were displayed
in old wine bottles near the showers.
Cards were posted in the lobby on the column
posts which went like this:
"Do not fret, do not fume. It's better than the
Village for a room." Signed by "the Ex-Villag
ers."
"Everything is in a mess—just relax, and just
call on us." Signed by "The Stern Men."
"Although the world may twist and turn,
Encina Hall will never burn." Signed by "Chief
'Gordy' Davis."
"Do not fret, do not pout. When Flo-Mo's
finished you'll get out." Signed by "The Encina
Ghost."
