# Owner of Menlo Store Forced To Pay Taxes
## 
### 
Roy Kepler, owner of a Mcnlo
Park book and magazine store,
who refused to pay his income tax
last spring, has been forced by the
government to pay.
In a letter to the Internal Reve
nue Bureau last April Kepler said
that by refusing to pay his taxes
he and his wife "were able to
make clear our complete disap
proval of the use to which more
than 80 per cent of all income tax
revenue is put: for armament and
military purposes.
Since we agree that modern
warfare and its preparation are
patently crimes against human
ity, we respectfully notify you of
our conscientious refusal to sup
ply the money necessary for such
inhumane purposes."
At the time an official of the
Bureau said, "The matter will be
handled in a routine fashion."
When Kepler and his wife re
turned from their vacation in the
middle of last month, they found
a notice in the mail from the gov
ernment. that the tax money owed
plus a 6 per cent penalty had been
taken from their account in their
bank."
"I am not surprised this hap
pened," Kepler stated. "I expected
something like this. But if the
government continues its present
spending policy, we will refuse to
pay our taxes again next year to
again demonstrate what we be
lieve in."
