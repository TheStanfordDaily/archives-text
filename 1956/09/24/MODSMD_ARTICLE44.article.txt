# Building Boom Hits SU Campus During Summer
## First Five Units of Moore Hall Already Occupied; Peripheral Roadway Extended 
### 
Stanford experienced an unprecedented amount of construction
this summer.
The new women's dormitory, Florence Moore Hall, is nearing com
pletion; the new Music Building going up next to the Post Office is
expected to be completed in March; and ground has been broken on
the Stanford Medical School. In

two weeks Campus Drive, which
will eventually encircle the cam
pus, will be completed from Palm
Drive around Wilbur Hall to the
front of Florence Moore.
Five units of the sevari-unit
Moore Hall opened for occupancy
yesterday. The two front units of
the $2 million dormitory situated
between Lake Lagunita and the
Row will not be ready until next
month. For Jhe first time in Stan
ford's history there are women
living in Fncina Hall. Encina,
built in 1891, served as a fresh
man men's dormitory from 12)23
until the completion of Wilbur
Hall in 1955. It will house 100
women on the second and third
floors.
Delay Explanation
In explaining the delay in com
pletion of the two units, Seraphim
Post, assistant University busi
ness manager, said, "The delays
are ones that crop up in any con
struction job of this size. We fig
ured that it was better to have
five units completely done than
seven only half way. The wom
en's living quarters are the only
part of tnose buildings that are
completely done."
Each wing of Florence Moore
Hall houses 50 women and has its
own lounge and dining hall, con
nected to a central kitchen. Every
room has its own telephone.
The $639,000 Music Building,
which was begun last April, will
be ready in March, and not De
cember, as originally scheduled.
The auditorium in the building
will seat 728 and occupy the main
floor level. A large rehearsal hall
and 10 sound-proof practice rooms
will take up most of the rest of
the building.
Dinkelspicl Memorial
The auditorium is a memorial
to the wife of Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel, president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees and is made
possible by gifts from Dinkelspiel
and his family.
Workmen are now paving the
strip of Campus Drive running in
front of Florence Moore. When
this is done in two weeks' time it
will be possible for students to go
from one side of the campus to
another without having to drive
past the Bookstore or Post Office
by using Campus Drive and Lo
mita.
The business manager's office
has urged students to use, this
route during the noon hour and
not tie up traffic by going past
the Post Office.
Many of the roads have been
torn up to extend pipe and power
lines to Florence Moore, but pav
ing on these roads is being wound
up now.
Med School Work
Work is just beginning on the
Stanford Medical School, to be
situated in back of the chemistry
building. The medical school is
now located in San Francisco and
the move has been planned be
cause of no longer useful facili
ties and a desire for joint work
with the Stanford faculty and the
Palo Alto Hospital personnel.

this summer.
The new women's dormitory, Florence Moore Hall, is nearing com
pletion; the new Music Building going up next to the Post Office is
expected to be completed in March; and ground has been broken on
the Stanford Medical School. In

two weeks Campus Drive, which
will eventually encircle the cam
pus, will be completed from Palm
Drive around Wilbur Hall to the
front of Florence Moore.
Five units of the sevari-unit
Moore Hall opened for occupancy
yesterday. The two front units of
the $2 million dormitory situated
between Lake Lagunita and the
Row will not be ready until next
month. For Jhe first time in Stan
ford's history there are women
living in Fncina Hall. Encina,
built in 1891, served as a fresh
man men's dormitory from 12)23
until the completion of Wilbur
Hall in 1955. It will house 100
women on the second and third
floors.
Delay Explanation
In explaining the delay in com
pletion of the two units, Seraphim
Post, assistant University busi
ness manager, said, "The delays
are ones that crop up in any con
struction job of this size. We fig
ured that it was better to have
five units completely done than
seven only half way. The wom
en's living quarters are the only
part of tnose buildings that are
completely done."
Each wing of Florence Moore
Hall houses 50 women and has its
own lounge and dining hall, con
nected to a central kitchen. Every
room has its own telephone.
The $639,000 Music Building,
which was begun last April, will
be ready in March, and not De
cember, as originally scheduled.
The auditorium in the building
will seat 728 and occupy the main
floor level. A large rehearsal hall
and 10 sound-proof practice rooms
will take up most of the rest of
the building.
Dinkelspicl Memorial
The auditorium is a memorial
to the wife of Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel, president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees and is made
possible by gifts from Dinkelspiel
and his family.
Workmen are now paving the
strip of Campus Drive running in
front of Florence Moore. When
this is done in two weeks' time it
will be possible for students to go
from one side of the campus to
another without having to drive
past the Bookstore or Post Office
by using Campus Drive and Lo
mita.
The business manager's office
has urged students to use, this
route during the noon hour and
not tie up traffic by going past
the Post Office.
Many of the roads have been
torn up to extend pipe and power
lines to Florence Moore, but pav
ing on these roads is being wound
up now.
Med School Work
Work is just beginning on the
Stanford Medical School, to be
situated in back of the chemistry
building. The medical school is
now located in San Francisco and
the move has been planned be
cause of no longer useful facili
ties and a desire for joint work
with the Stanford faculty and the
Palo Alto Hospital personnel.
Stanford experienced an unprecedented amount of construction
this summer.
