# Stanford Daily Invites Students To Participate
## 
### 
You ean earn one or more of the non-academic units required
for graduation from this university by working on The Daily.
Under the new General Studies program, inaugurated this year,
four out of the six units required can be earned by working at
such nonathletic activities as campus publications.
The Daily is always anxious to help people learn the art of
written expression, so valuable in this modern world. And we
might as well admit itâ€”we need help.
There will be a meeting of interested freshmen and upper
classmen at the Daily shack on Thursday at 3:30 p.m. At that
time members of the staff will explain Daily policy and what the
beginning writer can expect.
There are many openings on our staff. We need writers,
people interested in the business side of the newspaper game,
photographers and sports writers. Because our staff at present
is small, advancement will be as rapid as one's talents permit.
So we urge you to drop around to the Daily shack and attend
next Thursday's meeting.
We need you.
