# New Regulations May Simplify Registration
## 7,500 Students Expected to Register; Cars May Be Registered in Pavilion 
### 
Two days of registration, marked by some of the longest lines
this university has ever seen, will officially open the school year for
more than 7300 students today and tomorrow.
Some of the lines of former years will be eliminated, however,

, been assigned to both English and
Western Civilization classes.
In line with this policy, another
bottleneck will be eliminated by
the booth in the Pavilion for
changes in Western Civilization
and English -classes in case of
schedule conflicts. Members of
the two departments will be pres
ent in the stations to help fresh
men with program conflict prob
lems. Registrar Harvey Hall said
that schedule changes would be
made for no other reasons than
conflicts.
