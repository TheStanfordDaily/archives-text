# Britain Threatens Nile Control To Retaliate for Suez Seizure
## Dulles Plan Vote to Be Tomorrow Russia Continues Complete Support of Egypt's Suez Views

LONDON. Sept. 24 (UPi Brit
ish Foreign Secretary Selwyn
Lloyd charged tonight President
Nasser's seizure of the Suez
Canal left him open to retaliation
through British control of dams
at the source of the lifegiving
Nile River.
"If you a crept Nasser's argu
ment that he is entitled to break
international agreements," Lloyd
told a TV audience, then "we arc
entitled to do certain things."
Lloyd made his charge in the
form of an answer to questions
put to him by interviewer Hugh
Cudlipp, editorial director of the
Daily Mirror.- Cudlipp had asked
about the reminder made by Co
lonial Secretary Alan Lennox-
Boyd Saturday night that the
Owen Falls Dam in British-pro
tected Nrranda controls the flow
of the White Nile.
The foreign secretary did not
spell out whether Britain actu
ally was considering shutting off
the flow of the White Nile which
is the main source of the Nile.
The White Nile is controlled by
British engineers. Without the
Mile River, Egypt would go bank
rupt.
Straightforward Manner
Lloyd said the British and the
French "have acted throughout
in a perfectly straightforward
manner" on the Egyptian seizure
of the canal.
"We will do everything we pos
sibly can to obtain a peaceful so
lution." he said.
Referring to the British and
French decision to put the mat
ter before the United Nations Se
curity Council, Lloyd said:
"We shall go to the Security
Council in good faith."
A spokesman for the British
Foreign Office said the Council,
which will meet Wednesday af
ternoon, will be asked to approve
the 18-nation Dulles plan for in
ternationalization of the water
way.
Egypt Maneuvers
But Egypt, which today won
full support of its stand from
Saudi Arabia and Syria, was ex
pected to use a diplomatic ma
neuver and try to prevent Brit
ain. France and possibly the
United States from voting on
Suez proposals in the Council.
This could be accomplished by
getting the Council to consider
the matter as a "dispute" rather
than as a "situation." In a dis
pute. parties to the quarrel do
not vote in the Council.
That would leave Russia with
the sole veto power in the Coun
cil, and Russia already has said
it will use the veto to kill any
decision unfavorable to Egypt.
Diplomatic Plans
Lloyd spoke of Britain's deter
mination to reach a just and
peaceful solution after he con
ferred with India's roving ambas
sador V. K. Krishna Menon. 'flic
Indian diplomat was reported
considering going on to Washing
ton to continue talks on a peace
ful settlement.
All the interested foreign min
isters made plans to converge on
New York for the Council delib
erations.
