# Women Find 'New Look' Sadly Lacking at Encina
## 
### 
Sixty-five years ago Encina Hall may have sported the modern
look, but today's Stanford women find it sadly lacking.
Decorations still brighten the halls, but yesterday morning
the 100 new residents awakened to reality. Living four to a room,
most of the women have found it impossible to unpack, and
anticipate living out of one suitcase for three or four weeks.
Although each room is equipped with one small wash basin,
hot water has not been felt yet. And cracked mirrors, while
probably adequate for past Encina occupants, do not exactly
please the new tenants.
Puzzling to studious Stanford women is the fact that there
are no desks in the rooms. Were there, once, or not? That's the
question now being asked of the men who once lived there.
The Encina women will eventually move into Florence Moore
Hall and enjoy completely new and modern accommodations.
Today they are battling curtainless windows with views looking
out over men's eating clubs, men's dormitories and parking lots.
For 63 years Encina closets never held a formal and from the
size of them it wouldn't have been possible. From the ceilings
hang single light sockets, causing extension cords to be in great
demand.
But, with all this, the women are determined to maintain high
standards. Doors have been labeled the Waldorf-Astoria, the
Beverly-Hilton and other well-known spots.
As sophomore Betsy Flint summed it up, "It should be fun
if it doesn't last too long."
