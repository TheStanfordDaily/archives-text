PANAMA CITY, Fla., Sept. 24 (UP)â€”Hurricane Flossy slammod
into the northwest Florida resort coast today with winds of nearly
100 miles an hour and 25-foot waves. Behind it the giant storm left
floods in Louisiana's Mississippi River delta.
. At least three persons were dead and 10.000 were routed from

their homes in Flossy's side-wind
ing sweep across the* .jutting Lou
isiana coast before the storm
lunged eastward for Florida. Pos
sibly 50 persons were unaccounted
for aboard ships and offshore oil!
rigs.
At Panama City Beach. 10 miles
west of the city, the storm arrived
with 75-mile hurricane winds
early this afternoon and by 4 p.m.
gusts had increased to more than
90 miles an hour.
Waves Over Pier
"Waves of 25 feet are breaking
over the beach pier, which usually
stands 20 feet above the water,"
reported Don Brookins of radio
station YVDLP from the Panama
Beaeh Hotel.
"It is really howling. There goes
a TV antenna and power lines are
falling down all over. The water
has undermined a number of cot
tages here and they are settling
into the sand. The roofs have
blown off some of them."
C enter Due Soon
The center of the hurricane,
first to strike the U.S. mainland
this year, was due to pass inland
somewhere along the 175-mile re-1
sort strip between Pensacola and
Apalaehieola. Panama City lies j
perilously near, midway between
those two points.
Several tornadoes, generated in
the complex air currents preced
ing the hurricane, ripped several
communities between Pa n a m a
City and Tallahassee, the Florida
capital. 90 miles northeast of the
port. No injuries were reported,
although a mother and her baby'
saw their house crumble around
them near Tallahassee.
