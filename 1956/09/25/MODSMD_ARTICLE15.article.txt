' HENDERSON, Ky., Sept. 24
(UP)—A student boycott similar
to those which succeeded in bar
ring Negro children from white
schools at nearby Sturgis and
Clay, Ky., last week broke out
today at Henderson County's
Weaverton Consolidated School.
County Superintendent C. B.
West said that about 500 of the
•school's 853 pupils stayed away
from classes, either in protest
aaginst the admission of five Ne
gro children to the school nearly
three weeks ago, or because par
ents feared there might be
trouble.
Integration of the five Negro
children, two in the first grade
and one each in the second, third
and fourth grades, had proceeded
I with no previous sign of diffi
| culty for almost three weeks.
