## 
### 
DETROIT, Sept. 24 (UP)— Unit
ed Auto Workers president Wal
ter' P. Rout her demanded yester
day that President Eisenhower
and the Republican party make
definite commitments to back up
Vice President Nixon's promise of
a four-day work week.
Otherwise, Reuther said, the
Nixon statement Saturday in Col- j
orado Springs "may be written off I
as merely an example of political!
expedience" meaning no more
than Eisenhower's pledge to farm
ers in 1952 that he favored and
would fight for 100 per cent of
parity.
Positive commitments by the
Republicans, Reuther said, would
tend to eliminate industrial con
flict in 1958 when the UAW takes
the first collective bargaining
steps toward achievement of the;
four-day work week. The UAW's !
current three-year contracts with'
the automobile firms expire in I
1958.
Nixon was quoted as saying in ;
his speech Saturday that "we see i
the time not too distant when we I
can have a four-day week, and I
family life will be even more fully
enjoyed by every American."
"But," Reuther said, "in view :
of the broken campaign promises
made by the Republican candi- j
dates in 1952, we believe that more
assurance is required than a gen
erality in a campaign speech by
the Republican vice presidential
candidate."
