# Suez and the Sands of Time
## 
### 
with other dictators whose feet are pre
cariously implanted in (lie slipping sands of
lime, Egypt's Colonel Nasser has effectively
caught the West with ' its diplomatic brain
Hogged, hut the dilemma he has created may
eventually prove far more complex than he
himself wanted. Or, at least, so the West hopes.
The Western Suez ("anal users are working
under the assumption that time is working for
tlx â€¢in; th at if Egypt can he made through peace
ful action to see that she cannot unilaterally
take over what was once established as an inter
national waterway, a modus operandi may he
found. The \\ est is determined to save itself
from a diplomatic face slap and to stop further
seizures of \\ estern property, namely, oil.
lint meanwhile there is dissension among
those nations who have met together to form
the Suez Canal Users Association, and the
I nilcd States, the leading power in the West,
has been far from successful in its role of
harmonizer.
Britain and France would he more inclined
1o solve the problem with a show of force
should negotiations hit a stalemate, and other
nations vitally concerned with canal shipping
are dubious of the merits of the Users Asso
ciation.
I he present stage of the Middle Eastern crisis

points up more effectively than anything else
the lack of solidarity and basis for firm agree
ment among the Western powers, a situation
that students of NATO and Western unity have
long pointed out.
Nasser himself is now riding on the crest of
tremendous popularity among the Arab people,
for he, as one of the foremost exponents of
the nationalistic crescendo in underdeveloped
areas, has challenged the \\ est and found that
his challenge drew no immediate, forthright
stand of unity.
I he West is in the bewildering position of
having to find the fulcrum between use of force
and appeasement. The Users Association, which
can bark but not bite, sounds all right on paper
and would work if the man the West is dealing
with was a man on whom the power of reason
could be used. but. unfortuiiatejv for the West,
Nasser is no such man.
The responsibility and necessity now falls
upon the \\ est, and the United States in par
ticular, to present to the United Nations a
strong and wise stand, for more than the mere
control of a canal depends on it.
Should the Western nations vacillate and
quarrel among themselves, time may join forces
with Nasser.
