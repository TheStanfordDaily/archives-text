# Salute to Pre-Reg Com
## 
### 
I.vst I in RSDAY some 1300 freshmen arrived on
the campus to begin their journev to a higher
education. And to make their arrival more
pleasant, an eager group of upper-class students
welcomed them with a six-day activity-packed
program.
I his group was the Pre-Registration Com
mittee.
I he committee, headed this vear bv Bryant
Boatwright. made a few changes in this year's
schedule to "let the class get better acquainted."
Co-Recreation Day and Pic?iic, held before
the Jolly-Up, was the major change in this
year's program compared with the past. Last
)e:ir the freshmen did not have a chance to get
together en masse before the Jollv-Up dance.
My eliminating the dreary picnic at the
Sunken Diamond, usuallv held on Fridav after

noon, ilie Pre-Begistration Committee decided
that a recreational-type program and picnic
conic] be held on tlie same afternoon before the
dance. And, thereby, tlie class of 1960 would
have had a chance to better acquaint them
selves and build class spirit.
Co-Re creation Day, headed by Buzz McCoy
and Julie MofTett, proved a tremendous success.
Another convenience made possible bv the
hard-working upper-classmen was scheduling
the movie and the songfest on the same night in
Memorial Auditorium. In the past the songfest
was held after the picnic at the baseball dia
mond, where darkness and cold proved to be
a handicap.
I lie Daily commends these upper-classmen
who made the tours this year more interesting,
the talks more humorous and the entertainment
more enjoyable.
