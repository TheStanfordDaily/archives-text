# ON OTHER CAMPUSES-By Dave Scott
## Oskie Being Sued—But Which One? 
### 
They are having their share of troubles over
at that campus across the Bay.
First, Oskie, that beloved pudgy little Califor
nia bear mascot is being sued for 850,000. The
suit, which names ()>kie and the University in
general as co-defendants, was filed Sept. 14 by
12-year-old Charles Davis.
The suit charges that the kid was knocked
down and trampled when Oskie tossed pack
aged ice cream into the children's section of
the stadium. He claims he was knocked doicn
and t ram pled, and suffered a ruptured liga
ment of the neck. severe nervous shock and
permanent injuries.
Davis's attorney is facing a big identification
problem in his suit. ()ski"s identity is kept secret
as a 10-man anonymous committee takes turns

playing the role of the-mascot. So the process
server will never know which was the Oskie
that tossed the ice cream.
Also for the first time this vcar there is no
men's rooting section. The traditional off
color antics of the Berkeley bovs hit the admin
istration and the student government the wrong
way last year, and instead of the usual warning,
integration is the theme this vcar.
Also the registrar's office at C.al is heart
broken. It appears they predicted an enroll
ment of 18,395 at tin > end of the regular regis
tration period and only 15,746 slioived it/).
Even the lure of a newer and easier registra
tion process seems to have done no good.
People just seem to be staying ax cay.

Traffic difficulties arc worse on the UCLA
campus than they are at Stanford. There are
to 8000 parking places available to regis
tered students while approximately 10,000 driv
ers head toward campus every day in an at
tempt to find parking places.
Cimsequently, hundreds of curs are block
ing drireicays and o/Iht curs. The police de
part meat is issuing tickets by the gross but
the students seem to think it is worth the
fine to get a place to park. The chief is now
threatening to impound tars.

Similar trouble is being had at the other
had-hoy Southland institution. Parking places
just can I be had on the USC campus, and en
terprising capitalists iu the area immediately
surrounding the campus are making a killing
with parking lots.

Students at the University of Connecticut
were thinking of rising up in revolt. The ad
ministration has pussed a compulsory attend
ance rule forbidding unlimited cuts, llow
erer. tliey were pacified when it was found
that it applied only to lower division students
in the nunc advanced courses.
So far the fraternities on the Connecticut
campus have been behaving themselves. Last
year over half of them were banned from cam
pus for various assorted antics including burn
ing camp us fences, staging mass panty raids.
