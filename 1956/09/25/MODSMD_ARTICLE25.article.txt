# Murray Steals 'Bus Stop' Spotlight From Marilyn
## 
### Dave Scott 
Marilyn Monroe can almost act,
but Don Murray steals the show.
After a year's absence cinema's
most famous female returns to do
her first creditable job of acting
in "Bus Stop" now playing at the
Stanford Theater in Palo Alto.
But it is Don Murray, playing
the part of the unruly, untamable
cowboy, who really shows signs
of being a great performer.
Murray's wild exuberance in
his successful one-day courtship
of his "Angel" Cherie, played by
Marilyn, is something fresh and
new that the screen needs.
Dance Shows Stuff
Upon finding the girl of his
dreams in a saloon doing a dance
that shows the stuff Monroe is
made of, Murray vows that this
is what he came to Phoenix and
the rodeo to find. Unfortunately,
the cowboy from the plains of
Montana discovers that you can't
rope women in, like cattle. At
least this is what the picture tries
to bring forth. Considering that
he wins her in less than two days,
one wonders just how unsuccess
ful the poor, innocent boy was.
Marilyn herself has some prom
ise. However, her Arkansas ac
cent just doesn't ring true. She
seems more of a symbol of the
typical, uneducated girl for Mur
ray to do his character acting
around.
Not Hidden
Anyway, the end is inevitable
and perhaps the weakest part of
the picture. Wildboy Murray gets
knocked down a couple of pegs,
calms down just long enough to
get Cherie to marry him. Then.

with a whoop and a holler, he
112 reverts back to his old self, taking
j her back to his ranch in Montana
to live up to his promise of the
two of them being in bed* every
night at 7 o'clock.
