Encina Salutes Stern
Editor, The Daily:
When the girls who live in Alondra and Paloma—houses of Flor
ence Moore found out they were going to live in Encina, their atti
tude was, "Well, it'll be fun we'll be the first and only . ." But
there are glaring inconveniences connected with living here which
are hard to overlook.
Then Saturday night, when there were only 11 women in Encina
(the officers, R.A.'s and assistant directors of the two houses), the
extra lift came which raised morale and spirits to a high level.
The fact that the whole '"prank" in such good taste was done by
Stanford men has raised our spirits immeasurably (and strengthened
our faith in Stanford men) and we are grateful to them. A "Welcome"
from former Encina-ites cannot bo topped.
Bob McFarland seems to have been the organizer and planner;
Chuck Lloyd and Duke Campbell wound miles of crepe paper around
the banisters; Ed Butler ran back and forth to the third floor to get
water for the flowers; and Al Wilhelm and Jim Dunlop poked
hilarious messages in all the corners.
Not only that—they returned Sunday to carry suitcases up the
stairs for the girls.
Stern—we love you!
The Encina Women
