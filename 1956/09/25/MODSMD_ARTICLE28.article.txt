Three graduate students will
study at Stanford this year under
Ford Foundation fellowships in
business administration and eco
nomics.
Tibor Scitovsky, professor in
Stanford's department of econom
ics, has been awarded a faculty
research fellowship, making it
possible for him to do independent
research.
Brunham Campbell will write
his thesis for a doctor's degree
under a dissertation fellowship.
Alan Coleman will study for his
doctor's degree using a predocto
ral fellowship.
The students were selected from
candidates nominated from select
ed schools offering graduate pro
grams in business administration
or economics.
Under the fellowship program
the Ford Foundation hopes to in
crease the number of college and
university teachers in the two
fields and to encourage research
in the fields. It has appropriated
$570,000 for a total of 91 fellow
ships.
Stanford is one of 35 American
universities participating in the
program. Scholars in the business
administration and economics
fields made the final selections of
winners.
