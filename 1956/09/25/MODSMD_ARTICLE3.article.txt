# Farm Issue Waxes Hot Between GOP, Stevenson
## Hagerty Denies 'Small Farmer' Statement As Expressing the Administration's Farm Views 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (UP)â€”The White House today slapped
down a Republican congressional candidate for suggesting that Presi
dent Eisenhower thinks small farmers should stop sitting around
"and go to work."
White House news secretary James C. Hagerty said this view,

expressed by GOP candidate
George S. Spence of Tennessee's
Fifth district, "certainly does not
in any way, .shape or manner re
flect the President's thinking."
Spence was one of 22 Repub
lican candidates who stopped by
the White House to have photo
graphs made with Mr. Eisenhow
er for use in their campaigns.
In talking with newsmen later
Spence said he told the President
that small farmers in his area are
"finally realizing that to make a
living they have to get off their
butts and go to work like every
body else."
Furthermore, he said, Mr. Eis
enhower agreed with this senti
ment.
Hagerty Consults
When reporters asked Hagerty
about the reported exchange, the
news secretary went directly to
the President and then called
newsmen to a special conference.
He said Mr. Eisenhower "didn't
recall hearing such a remark" and
that the Spence quote did not jibe
with the President's "opinion and
oft - expressed feelings" about
small farmers.
"Wo have proposed many things
during our Administration to help
small farmers specifically," Hag
erty said.
He added that Mr. Eisenhower
will deal wilh the problems of
small farmers in a-section of his
farm speech at Peoria, 111., tomor
row night.
Ike Challenged
Meanwhile, in Oklahoma City,
Okla., Adlai Stevenson challenged
Presidenl Eisenhower to spell out
what he has done to "fulfill" his
19f>2 farm pledges.
The Democratic presidential
nominee accused the Republican
Administration of "neglect and in
difference" toward the farmer in
a speech before 8000 persons at
the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds.
He recalled that in 1952 at Kas
son, Minn., Mr. Eisenhower prom
ised to continue priee supports at
90 per cent of parity and later said
he would work for "full parity."
Views Sought
"I would ask the President to
tell us tomorrow night, when he
speaks at Peoria on farm policy,
precisely what his Administration
has done to fulfill those pledges
to the American farmer," Steven
son said.
At Tulsa, Okla., Stevenson told
a crowd at the county courthouse
that the Republicans have a "con
sistent" record of opposhig Demo
cratic measures to end poverty
since the days of Herbert Hoover.
He said Vice President Richard
M. Nixon's words two nights ago
about poverty being wiped out if
the GOP stays in office were a
"hollow echo" of Mr. Hoover's
statements in 1928.
Stevenson also criticized the
Administration's foreign policy in
his Tulsa speech. "We must stop
bluffing our enemies, boasting to
our frieflds and misleading our
people here at home," he said.
