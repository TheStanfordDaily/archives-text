# Post Office Gives New Regulations
## 
### 
Stanford's post office asks all
students to fill in a Form 22 card
showing their local address. This
is being done by the department
in preparation for the publishing
of the all-school directory.
I The post office also requests
that students call for mail only
twice a day. The most convenient
times are after either 9 a.m. or
2 p.m. delivery.
