# Looking It Over

With Jerry Kelly
What can we as Stanford students expect of our athletes on the
gridiron, maple courts, diamond, track and field this school year?
With, perhaps, a touch of over-optimism, the Daily sports staff
foresees Indian squads excelling last year's fine record in every
major sport except possibly basketball.
FOOTBALL
Coach Chuck Taylor's burly gridders, already on the winning
trail, have been tabbed as the team to beat in the Pacific Coast Con
ference. The slow-starting Indians of 1955 churned into full gear at
mid-season and completed the season with a highly respectable 6-3-1
record.
With competition tougher on the Coast this season, Taylor has his
work cut out for him in attempting to better last season's mark.
PCC contenders up and down the coast scored decisive victories over
intersectional foes. Definitely stronger grid elevens include Oregon
(35-0 over Colorado), Southern California (44-20 over Texas), Wash
ington (53-21 over Idaho), California (6-7 effort against Baylor) and
Oregon State (19-13 over Missouri).
On the brighter side, Stanford's coaching' staff has 22 lettemien
back on the '56 squad plus a host of juniors up from the .IV ranks
and promising prospects from last year's freshman outfit. Leading
the impressionable list of returnees are All-American choices,
tackle Paul Wiggin and quarterback John Brodie. The talented
pair were elected co-captains by their teammates last week.
Along with Brodie and Wiggin as All-Conference material are four
exceptional ends, Gary Van Galder, Carl Isaacs, Jerry Beatie and
sophomore Joel Freis, a pair of experienced halfbacks, Paul Camera
and Gordy Young, and guard Donn Carswell.
It's a long road ahead for Taylor's men, but the enthusiasm, spirit
and drive of the Stanford eleven may well result in a conference title.
The 1956 Indians are balanced, have top passing combination in
the conference, but presently lack desirable depth and real speed in
an experienced back field.
BASKETBALL
Four court masters who saw regular action last year greet basket
ball coach Howie Dallmar. Voted Stanford's Coach of the Year two
years running, Dallmar has the reputation of producing winning
teams with little experienced material. In what is probably the
strongest all-around basketball conference in (he land, Dallmar and
his mates hustled to third place last season behind UCLA and Wash
ington.
Back for another season on the varsity are forwards Carl Isaacs,
presently a football standout, and Bill Bond and guards Hap Wag
ner and (*ary Van Galder, another grid starter this year. Gone are
captain George Selleck, Athlete of the Year at Stanford, Barry
Brown, Bill Flanders and Ron Wagner.
By next year the nucleus of one of the most successful Papoose
quintets in Stanford history will have acquired needed seasoning.
Up from a brilliant Frosh five, which dropped only two matches last
year, are several potential stars including dead-eye guard Paul Neu
mann and forwards John Pfueger and Dick Haga. Lending height to
the Indians for the first time in years will be 6 ft. 7-in. center Brent
"Stork" Leonard.
TRACK AND FIELD
In his inaugural year as SU track coach, Payton Jordan has a
definite rebuilding job ahead, but if anyone is qualified, it's Jordan.
Jordan, voted Pacific Coast Coach of the Year after building little
Occidental into a track and field power, needs added candidates in
every event. Four top PCC contenders have returned. They are
Frank Hermann, broad jump champ; Maury Graves, Indian two-mile
record holder; Bernie Nelson, high hurdle champ, and high jumper
Phil Fehlen.
Six of the nine thinclads who gained third places for Stanford
in last year's PCC meet are returning. Jack Weiershauser, retired
track coach, named Len Bates, hurdler, Don Chesarek, sprinter,
and distance men Ernie Cunlil'fe and Doug Martin as most prom
ising from the freshman ranks.
BASEBALL
Only three regular players were lost by graduation and <Coach
"Dutch" Fehring expects a big year on the Stanford
Two All-CIBA sluggers, Ralph Iloding and Rudy Figueroa, return
as do Steve Stewart and A 1 Shaw, second-string all-stars.
The entire infield, third baseman Figueroa, shortstop Stewart,
second baseman Shaw and first sacker Hal Messner, are slated for
spring duty. Holding, a standout catcher last season, will receive for
veteran pitchers Ed Verdurmen, Walt Payne, Ray Looney, Dick Jones
and George Avery.
Up from the Frosh ranks to fill two gaps in the lineup are out
fielder Rich DeFabio and Bob Flanders.
TENNIS
The tennis team may never be the same without the services of
colorful showboat and state meet finalist Jack Frost. First singles
ace Jack Douglas, another looballer, fourth-ranked Gil White and
alternates Bob Bowdcn and Bob Prince join sophomores Dave Nel
son, Brooks Rawlins and Dick Gould. This should round out a team
which will fare well in what is definitely the toughest league in the
country.
GOLF
The golf team, aiming for its sixth straight conference champion
ship, stands an excellent chance of achieving its goal. Four outstand
ing sophomores, Bernie Magnusson, Woodgie Reich, Bill Seanor and
Ray Sillman, usual low-scorers in Frosh-JV matches last season, are
expected to bring many honors back to the Stanford campus in three
years of competition.
