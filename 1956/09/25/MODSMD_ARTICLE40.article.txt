# Michigan State Opens Here Saturday Against Stanford's Tamed Aerial Circus
## Rose Bowl Champions Feature Running Game In Top Intersectional 
### 
With Washington State tucked
securely under their belts, the In
dians of Stanford return to home
grounds only to find a nationally
prominent Michigan State eleven
awaiting their season's opener.
The Spartans, confident of pre
serving their scalps, come to the
west already rated second in the
nation without even showing
their prowess as yet this season.
The 1956 Rose Bowl champs
stomped the Cards in East Lan
sing last year. 38-14.
Chaperoned by Coach Hugh
Duffy Daugherty, Scripps - How
ard Coach of the Year in 1955,
MSU uses the "Munn system," or
the multiple offense, which Duffy
learned as an assistant to his pre
decessor, Biggie Munn. *
Watch Those Halfbacks
Michigan State has the "goods."
Start with the two 6-foot, 200-
pound halfbacks, Clarence Peaks
and Walt Kowalczyk. Daugherty,
a coach, like our Chuck Taylor,
who does not hide behind a pessi
mist's mask, calls them the great
est backfield duo in collegiate
football. Peaks' forte can be
summed up in one word—foot
ball. Passer and punter, Peaks
has a two-year record of 753
yards gained in 148 carries for a
5.1 average and is a crunching
blocker and brilliant defender.
Kowalczyk (pronounced Ka
WALL chick), voted outstanding
player of the 1956 Rose Bowl, can
be described with the same adjec
tives, adding that he is but a jun
ior. His record in his first varsity
season was 584 yards in 82 car
ries for a 7.1 average and 6
touchdowns.
Heading an equally strong line
are guard Dan Currie, center and
captain John Matsko and end
Dave Kaiser, who gained national
prominence by kicking the last
minute, game-winning field goal
in the Rose Bowl. Back this up
with 20 other lettermen and a
group of 51 sophomore candidates
and you have quite a headache.
Especially if you are a member of
the Stanford coaching staff.
No Injuries
The Indians came out of the 40-
26 Washington State victory with
no serious injuries. The minor
aches and bruises are to be
worked out early this week when
Taylor and staff start the grind
for strategy against Michigan
State.
The fact that MSU has had a
look at the Indians this season
works against Stanford. Michi
gan State could not be scouted
this season. They will run, they
have punting, and they can win
with the field goal. This much
can be surmised from past per
formances.
The 287 yards that Washington
State gained through the air
Coach Taylor has attributed to
exceptionally good passing, a
trademark of Sutherland teams.
Passing looms as the Spartan
question mark, as graduation has
claimed last year's All-American
quarterback, Earl Morrall.
Nevertheless, confidence must
be gained in the Stanford aerial
defense to allow fullest attention
to be given to controlling the
MSU ground attack, controlling
it like the Indians contained Ohio
State's Big Ten champs of last
season. Stanford stymied the
Buckeyes' vaunted ground attack
here last season in trimming the
heralded OSU eleven, 6-0.
Michigan State's intricate,
bruising ground game and ques
tion mark passing game must *e
contained; the Stanfords must
counter with their touted passing
attack and "developing" running
game under a full head of steam.
After Michigan State, it's Ohio
State at Columbus.
