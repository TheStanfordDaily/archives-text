# National Poll Puts Indians In Sixth Spot
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
In its first national grid poll of
the season the International
News Service has rated the Stan
ford Indians sixth in the country.
The poll, which appears weekly
throughout the football season, is
the combined opinions of various
national sports figures.
The Indians' appearance in the
sixth position was considerably
higher than earlier predictions
which had placed the locals as
low as 17 in some polls. The
Cards' 40-26 win over Washing
ton State last Saturday night,
with sportsters' predictions sur
rounding John Brodie's passing
skill being exceeded, was enough
to elevate them to their current
post.
The three top teams in the first
report have yet to see action this
season. Rated by records of past
performances and pre season re
ports are Oklahoma, Michigan
State and Ohio State who will
meet North Carolina, Stanford
and Nebraska, respectively, in
first-tries this weekend.
A tie in the fourth position
finds TCU and Georgia Tech,
both winners last weekend,
matched evenly. Texas Christian
swamped Kansas 32-0, while
Georgia Tech outpointed Ken
tucky 14-6. TCU's showing, pil
ing up 20 first downs and gaining
279 aerial yards to Kansas' none,
served only to keep them at the
high point predicted for them in
preseason guesses. The Geor
gians, though, were boosted from
a slightly lower slot by virtue of
their win.
An upset in eastern play en
abled Syracuse to move up to the
seventh slot in the voting. The
Orange ran their way to a 26-12
victory over Maryland. The
Maryland loss, it appears, was
enough to drop them from the
top ten.
After their 19-0 march over
Villanova, the Texas A&M grid
ders captured the national eighth
position. The A&Mers still fell
below predictions, winning by
only a 19-point margin. They will
face an untested Louisiana State
team on Saturday.
Michigan, which captured the
ninth post, plays for the first
time Saturday when they meet
the UCLA Bruins. Pittsburgh,
after squeezing a 14-13 victory
out of their West Virginia rival,
rounded out the list.

Cards' 40-26 win over Washing
ton State last Saturday night,
with sportsters' predictions sur
rounding John Brodie's passing
skill being exceeded, was enough
to elevate them to their current
post.
The three top teams in the first
report have yet to see action this
season. Rated by records of past
performances and pre season re
ports are Oklahoma, Michigan
State and Ohio State who will
meet North Carolina, Stanford
and Nebraska, respectively, in
first-tries this weekend.
A tie in the fourth position
finds TCU and Georgia Tech,
both winners last weekend,
matched evenly. Texas Christian
swamped Kansas 32-0, while
Georgia Tech outpointed Ken
tucky 14-6. TCU's showing, pil
ing up 20 first downs and gaining
279 aerial yards to Kansas' none,
served only to keep them at the
high point predicted for them in
preseason guesses. The Geor
gians, though, were boosted from
a slightly lower slot by virtue of
their win.
An upset in eastern play en
abled Syracuse to move up to the
seventh slot in the voting. The
Orange ran their way to a 26-12
victory over Maryland. The
Maryland loss, it appears, was
enough to drop them from the
top ten.
After their 19-0 march over
Villanova, the Texas A&M grid
ders captured the national eighth
position. The A&Mers still fell
below predictions, winning by
only a 19-point margin. They will
face an untested Louisiana State
team on Saturday.
Michigan, which captured the
ninth post, plays for the first
time Saturday when they meet
the UCLA Bruins. Pittsburgh,
after squeezing a 14-13 victory
out of their West Virginia rival,
rounded out the list.

In its first national grid poll of
the season the International
News Service has rated the Stan
ford Indians sixth in the country.
The poll, which appears weekly
throughout the football season, is
the combined opinions of various
national sports figures.
The Indians' appearance in the
sixth position was considerably
higher than earlier predictions
which had placed the locals as
low as 17 in some polls. The
