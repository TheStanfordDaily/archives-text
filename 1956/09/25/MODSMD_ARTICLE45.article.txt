# Large Track Turnout Needed; Jordan Plans Building Program
## 
### 
New head track coach Payton Jordan is desirous of getting a large
turnout for fall practice. Interested candidates may sign up in
Jordan's office in Ihe BAC any time this week.
Equipment will be issued Wednesday in Encina Gym between 2
and 5 p.m. Coach Jordan will outline his fall plans at a meeting for

all freshmen and varsity pros
pects Thursday at 3 p.m. in the
BAC, Room 'IT.
"This is by far the strongest
track conference in tin* United
States," Jordan said, "and we
must start building now if we are
going to be contenders for the
championship.
"No team can afford to rely on
a few first-place men. Manpower
is a must if we are to enjoy a
successful season. But we must
start building* now. Champion
ship teams are developed in the
fall, not the spring. I can't stress
this point strongly enough.
"Track and field is a sport that
offers an opportunity for every
one. The only requirement is in
terest and willingness to work.
"The coaching staff urges you
to come in and talk with us
whether you signed up for track
or not. Both Floyd Strain, fresh
man and assistant track Coych,
and I are anxious to meet and
know all the boys interested in
this great international sport.
"If we can get 100 per cent
turnout of all men interested in
track, I feel confident we will
I field a team in the spring of 1957
| that will be a credit to Stanford,
i A team that will give all comers
a battle for every point. A team
thai, regardless of scoring, will
give its best individual and col
lective effort in all competition."
In nine years Jordan built Oc
cidental. a small oft-beaten col
lege in the Southern California
Athletic Conference, into one of
the nation's track giants. Jordan
coached his team to nine straight
conference titles, and last year
Occidental was ranked second
only to powerful Southern Cali
fornia.
By 1950 Occidental's promi
nence could not be denied. John
Barnes had humiliated the great
Mai Whitfield, and the follow
ing ysar he ran the fastest half
mile in the world. In the 1952
Olympics at London miler Bob
McMillen ran the 1500 meters
faster than any American ever
had before, losing by inches.
