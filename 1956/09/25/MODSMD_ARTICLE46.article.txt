# Golf Meeting Set for Today
## 
### 
Golf coach Bud Finger has
scheduled a meeting of all var
sity and freshman hopefuls for
5 p.m. in the pro shop at the golf
course today. The purpose of the
conclave is to discuss plans for
the coming season which runs
from late winter quarter through
spring.
Coach Finger will be counting
on four returnees from last
year's varsity squad as he plans
his campaign. John Brodie, Alf
Burtleson, Ron Luceti and Dave
Diffenderfer will be returning to
the links this season, as will Jim
Rowley who, while he wasn't a
regular last year, did make the
club's eastern trip, turning in a
number of fine showings.
Moving up from last year's
Frosh ranks will be Bill Seanor,
Bernie Magnussen, and Woodgie
Reich who led the qualifying in
the All American Open at Tam
O'Shanter in Chicago.
