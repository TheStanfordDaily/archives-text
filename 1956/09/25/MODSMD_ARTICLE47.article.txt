# Cellar Coffee Now Sells for Ten Cents
## Price Raised During June By Board of Governors Increase Suggested by George Ralph, Backed By Winbigler; Freelen, Mathewson Voted No 
### 
Cellar coffee costs 10 cents.
Stanford's traditional five-cent
cup of coffee has finally taken
the axe. For at the Union Board
of Governors' last meeting on
June 6. a resolution was passed
to raise the price of java from a
nickel to a dime.
For years the Cellar had been
furnishing the campus with a
subsidized cup of coffee for pure
ly traditional reasons.
At the June 6 meeting then
ASSU President George Ralph
shocked the other seven board
members when he proposed a
resolution that "the price of cof
fee be raised to 10 cents per cup,
effective at the beginning of sum
mer quarter."
Move Surprising
Ralph's move was surprising
since all other 1 student body pres
idents and other student repre
sentatives on the board in the
past have always fought vehe
mently against any increase in
the price of Cellar coffee. Two
other board members had always
backed the students' stand also.
They were Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler and Alumni
Secretary Jack W. Shoup.
But the most startled person in
the room was University Dining
Ilalls Director Christine Rieker.
She said that she had always
given the board statistics and fig
ures on the rising costs of coffee
in hope that they would raise the
price. And when a student pro
posed such a rise she was
amazed.
Not Joking
Immediately after the motion
was made, everyone laughed
thinking it was a joke. Ralph in
sisted he was not joking. And
when it became apparent that he
wasn't, a motion was made by
Assistant Business Manager Ser
aphim F. Post to table the reso
lution.
This motion to table Ralph's
resolution was backed only by
Post and Student Financial Man
ager Bill Mathewson. They con
tended that the matter should be
brought up in autumn quarter
when the students could give
' their opinion and that dead week
I wasn't the time to bother them
: with the matter.
Discussion
i When the tabling motion
j failed, discussion began on the
| proposition.
According to Mathewson, the
I sides lined up with Ralph, Post,
j Winbigler and Chairman George
E. Osborne, professor of law, in
I favor of the motion and ASSU

President • elect Robert Freelen,
Shoup and himself against the
proposal to raise the price of cof
fee.
Miss Rieker, who always had
been in favor of a price increase,
did not enter the discussion.
Time to Vote
When it came time for a vote.
Freelen had left to attend a one
o'clock class. The proposition
passed by a vote of 3 to 2. Miss
Rieker, Osborne and Freelen did
not vote.
Dean Winbigler's reason for
changing sides on this issue was
because, he said, "It's more im
portant to make the Union com
pletely solvent and to build up its
reserves in order to build the new
Tresidder Memorial Student Un
ion."
Winbigler added t hat if the
money doesn't come from Union
profits it will have to come from
another source, such as increase
in Union dues to each student.
Increase in Tuition
This virtually means an in
crease in tuition. "And would an
increase in tuition," he said, jus
tify five-cent coffee?"
The main arguments for nickel
coffee are emotional and tradi
tional. The proponents of the
nickel cup say that "it's like giv
ing the students a rebate at the
Bookstore, except that you give
it to them in the lower price."
The traditional argument is
that Stanford has always had
five-cent coffee and in the past
few years the Cellar has believed
that the tradition is worth sub
sidization.
