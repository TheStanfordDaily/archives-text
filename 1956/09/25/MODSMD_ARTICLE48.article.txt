OTTAWA. Sept. 24 (UP)â€”Can
ada revealed today it had dis
missed a Russian diplomat who
tried to get jet plane secrets by
offering a bribe to a debt-ridden
government worker.
The diplomat, G. F. Popov, sec
ond secretary at the Soviet em
bassy here, left Canada on Aug.
12 after the government pro
tested his activities.
Popov offered a Royal Cana
dian Air Force employee, J. Stan
ley Staples, $50 last winter in ex
change for secrets about the
delta-wing CF-105 jet fighter,
Staples said.
Staples, who was discharged
and blacklisted from government
service over the incident, said he
turned down the offer.
The Canadian government offi
cially acknowledged only that
Popov was asked to leave.
Victor A. Selivanov, a third sec
retary at the Russian embassy,
has been implicated with Popov,
but the Canadian government de
clined comment on that.
Staples, a 30-year-old veteran
of World War 11, said the bribery
attempt followed several months
of friendship with Popov and oth
er Russian embassy officials.
* "It was while we were drink
ing," Staples said. "I borrowed
some money and later returned
the."30 to him. He did not want
to take it. But I told him I could
not accept the $50 as a gift.
