WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (UP)
â€”Russia's new economic aid pro
gram has been so successful in
Afghanistan it may pave the way
for "an historic break-through" to
India, an economist testified
today.
Max F. Millikan, professor of
economics at Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, said the Com
munist bloc has granted about $1
billion in credit to underdeveloped
nations, including Afghanistan.
"The Afghans have recently
confirmed that they are also re
ceiving military equipment," he
told a House Ways and Means
subcommittee investigating world
trade problems."
