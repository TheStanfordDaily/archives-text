EN ROUTE WITH NIXON.
Sept. 24 (UP iâ€”Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon charged to
night that all Adlai E. Stevenson
"has to offer the people is a car
bon copy of I he same type of po
litical demagoguery which char
acterized the Truman Fair Deal."
In his sharpest direct attack
yet on the Democratic Presiden
tial nominee by name, Nixon ac
cued Stevenson of "a calculated
campaign to divide Americans on
a class basis and to set one group

and population against another."
Nixon said in remarks pre
pared for delivery at a Salt Lake
City rally that "We are proud
that during the four years this
administration has been in Wash
ington we have never resorted to
the class appeal which is so alien
to American ideals."
So far, the barnstorming Vice-
President declared, Stevenson
"up to this point has offered only
the same defeatist program he
offered in 1952. It is a program
which refuses to acknowledge the
proved ability of individual Amer
icans to get things done for them
selves."
