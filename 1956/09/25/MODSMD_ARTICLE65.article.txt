# State Att'y Undecided On Conservation Issue

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 24
(UP) â€” State Attorney General
Edmund P. Brown today issued
his long-awaited opinion on Prop
tion 4, the controversial oil con
servation measure; taking neither
a firm stand for nor against the
proposition.
Brown's opinion was hailed im
mediately by both opponents and
proponents of the measure as a
major victory for their side.
The tenor of Brown's opinion,
however, appeared to lean against
the measure.
In the 36-page opinion the at
torney general expressed a doubt
that the State Lands Commission
would retain its authority over
state oil property; said that the
measure would mean eventual
court battles to interpret its full
meaning; said that the proposi
tion should have been a legisla
tive measure rather than an ini
tiative, to give the legislature au
thority to correct "unforeseen fu
ture developments . . . and mis
takes in judgment."
The opinion outlined a "substan
tial" argument against the meas
ure which Brown's assistants said
placed the outcome of the ques
tion "in such doubt that perhaps
it may not be answered short of
lengthy court action."
The measure, if passed, would

provide for unit operation of Cali
fornia oil pools if 75 per cent of
surface land owners agreed to op
erate the pool according to speci
fied conservation practices.
Charles S. Jones, president of
the Richfield Oil Corp. and a lead
er of the forces for Proposition 4,
said Brown's ruling that the
measure "does not authorize the
limiting of production for the pur
pose of controlling the price of oil
or the market demand for petro
leum products is a death blow"
to opposition arguments.
E. G. Starr, president of the As
sociation of Independent Oil Pro
ducers and an anti-Proposition 4
leader, said Brown's ruling "con
firms that Proposition 4 puts a
noose around the state's neck and
hands the rope to eight major oil
importing companies."
Brown's opinion on the measure
was requested last July by the
State Lands Commission and As
semblyman Allen Miller (D-San
Fernando).
