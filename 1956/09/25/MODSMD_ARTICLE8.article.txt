As is usual at the beginning of
the school year (and all other
times, for that matter) The Stan
ford Daily needs help.
Our aim is to put out the best
college paper possible, but to do
so, we have to have people to
write the news of the day.
With this in mind, we cordially
invite any and everyone with an
interest in writing to visit Ihe
Daily Shack. We welcome the op
portunity to bamboozle you into
working for us.
Even if you think you know
nothing about news writing, we
will be glad to have you on our
staff. The essentials of news
writing can be learned in a fairly
short timn.
At present, we have a small
staff. Under the self - imposed
rules of The Daily, there need to
be a small number of people en
gaged in several facets of the
newspaper game, such as photog
raphy, sports writing, business
management and, of course, gen
eral writing.
With our small staff, advance
ment will he as rapid as your
abilities allow.
So come around and talk with
us We need help and we can
help you.
