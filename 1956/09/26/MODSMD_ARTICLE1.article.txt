## England and France To Take Case to UN; Eden Talks to French 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 25 (UP)—Brit
ain today denied that Anglo-
French actions in the Suez crisis
arc a threat to peace.
It denounced as "wild allega
tions" the Egyptian charge that
the London and Paris govern
ments were hostile, as the three
nations prepared to take their
cases before the United Nations
Security Council in New York to-'
morrow. And it predicted the
Council also would reject the
Egyptian charges.
On the side, the British sought
to repair the damage to the An
glo-French alliance caused by wa
tering down the original 18-na
tion Western plan for a Suez Ca
nal users' association to force the
with Egypt.
Suez Cabinet Meets
Prime Minister Anthony Eden
held a meeting of his "Suez cabi
net" preparatory to flying to
Paris tomorrow for two days of
talks with disappointed French
leaders.
In Paris, Foreign Minister
Christian Pineau said the nations
which have taken a "weak stand"
in the crisis "will be the most to
blame if it worsens." He indi
cated the United States and Italy
were among such nations.
Britain concentrated on pre
paring its case against Egypt be
fore the Security Council, where
both Britain and France appealed
for action against the Egyptian
Canal seizure.
A Foreign Office spokesman
refused to state whether Britain
would object to inclusion of the
Egyptian complaint on the Coun
cil agenda. But he rejected the
Egyptian charge that the West
threatens world peace.
"We Are Not. Guilty"
"Wo certainly, of course, do
not accept that any moves made
by us could lie described as a
threat to peace," the spokesman
said.
A British UN delegation spokes
man in New York said "we reject
the allegation that we are guilty
of threats in any way as sug
gested."
Britain and France, with Amer
ican backing, want the Council to
approve the original Dulles plan
for internationalization of the
canal.
Informed sources jn Cairo said
the Egyptian strategy will be to
ask the Security Council to pass
a motion censuring Britain and
France for "hostile" acts against
Egypt. This would be based in
part on the Anglo-French mili
tary buildup in the Mediterra
nean.

On the side, the British sought
to repair the damage to the An
glo-French alliance caused by wa
tering down the original 18-na
tion Western plan for a Suez Ca
nal users' association to force the
with Egypt.
Suez Cabinet Meets
Prime Minister Anthony Eden
held a meeting of his "Suez cabi
net" preparatory to flying to
Paris tomorrow for two days of
talks with disappointed French
leaders.
In Paris, Foreign Minister
Christian Pineau said the nations
which have taken a "weak stand"
in the crisis "will be the most to
blame if it worsens." He indi
cated the United States and Italy
were among such nations.
Britain concentrated on pre
paring its case against Egypt be
fore the Security Council, where
both Britain and France appealed
for action against the Egyptian
Canal seizure.
A Foreign Office spokesman
refused to state whether Britain
would object to inclusion of the
Egyptian complaint on the Coun
cil agenda. But he rejected the
Egyptian charge that the West
threatens world peace.
"We Are Not. Guilty"
"Wo certainly, of course, do
not accept that any moves made
by us could lie described as a
threat to peace," the spokesman
said.
A British UN delegation spokes
man in New York said "we reject
the allegation that we are guilty
of threats in any way as sug
gested."
Britain and France, with Amer
ican backing, want the Council to
approve the original Dulles plan
for internationalization of the
canal.
Informed sources jn Cairo said
the Egyptian strategy will be to
ask the Security Council to pass
a motion censuring Britain and
France for "hostile" acts against
Egypt. This would be based in
part on the Anglo-French mili
tary buildup in the Mediterra
nean.
