# New Parking Lot Plan Goes Into Effect Today To Keep Campus Vehicles Off Roads
## On-Campus Students to Be Limited Almost Entirely to Dormitory Lots 
### 
Stanford's first attempt at a planned parking lot system goes into
effect today.
Beginning this morning at 8 o'clock all students will no longer
have free use of all parking lots. On-campus residents will be re
stricted almost exclusively to their own dormitory lots.
The over-all system is designed to eliminate the traffic congestion

caused by an estimated 5000 cam
pus automobiles. By forcing on- I
campus students to walk to class, i
the University Business Manag- j
er's office figures University
roads can comfortably hold fac
ulty and 900 off-campus student I
automobiles.
The northern section o[ the
Stern triangular lot, half of tho
library lot and thp whole lot in
back of the Women's Gymnasium
on Lomita will be used exclusive
ly by automobiles bearing off
campus stickers. The circular ap
proach area to campus and most
of Lomita are also reserved for
off-campus students.
Oil-Campus Students
On-campus students must park
only in the dormitory lot desig
nated by their stickers. A new
parking lot next to the chemistry
building has been provided for use
by all on-campus students, and an
unrestricted lot opposite Florence
Moore Ilall is in the planning
stage.
All those who have not regis
tered their automobile, paid the
$3 registration fee and obtained
their sticker during registration
may do so at the campus police
station at the Corporation Yard.
The registration fee, another in
novation at Stanford, will be used
to pay for the enforcement of the
parking system. The money will
provide for an additional motor
cycle policeman, for the maps and
stickers and for many of the
parking signs. Any additional
money will go toward the main
tenance of the lots.
Any violation of the parking re
strictions will cost the offending
party $2. Stanford Police Chief
Gordon Davis has emphasized
that rigid enforcement is impos
sible and "everyone is on his
honor to make the system work
efficiently like it should. The
point is not how long you can
escape detection by the police.
The system is for the students'
own benefit."
Signs Not Put Up
Davis said that all the signs on
the restricted lots have not been
put up yet and urged students
with automobiles to follow the re
strictions on the colored maps dis
tributed during registration. The
signs will all be up within a week.
"After the signs are up, follow j
them rather than the map, as a
few minor changes have been
made since the map was printed,"
Davis said.
Davis urged Stern men to use
the northern lot reserved exclu
sively for them, and Crothers men
to use their portion of the library
lot. "Both lots are only half full
of cars at present, which means
the residents are using areas not
meant for them." Davis said.
Lots Enlarged
Many of the dormitory lots
were enlarged and improved this
past summer to aid the new plan.
Parking lots in front of Branner
and Crothers Memorial halls and
in back of the library have been
enlarged and improved. The eat
ing club lot has been extended
and rearranged. Florence Moore
Hall has two new parking lots.
Assistant University Business
Manager Seraphim F. Post said:
"We know the system has its
flaws, but the only way we can
find them is to put it to work for
a while. It is a big step toward
curing a big campus problem.
Other universities have banned
campus traffic altogether, but we
don't believe this is the right so
lution."
The new system was planned
last year by a joint corhmittee of t
faculty and students.

Many of the dormitory lots
were enlarged and improved this
past summer to aid the new plan.
Parking lots in front of Branner
and Crothers Memorial halls and
in back of the library have been
enlarged and improved. The eat
ing club lot has been extended
and rearranged. Florence Moore
Hall has two new parking lots.
Assistant University Business
Manager Seraphim F. Post said:
"We know the system has its
flaws, but the only way we can
find them is to put it to work for
a while. It is a big step toward
curing a big campus problem.
Other universities have banned
campus traffic altogether, but we
don't believe this is the right so
lution."
The new system was planned
last year by a joint corhmittee of t
faculty and students.
Stanford's first attempt at a planned parking lot system goes into
effect today.
Beginning this morning at 8 o'clock all students will no longer
have free use of all parking lots. On-campus residents will be re
stricted almost exclusively to their own dormitory lots.
The over-all system is designed to eliminate the traffic congestion

caused by an estimated 5000 cam
pus automobiles. By forcing on- I
campus students to walk to class, i
the University Business Manag- j
er's office figures University
roads can comfortably hold fac
ulty and 900 off-campus student I
automobiles.
The northern section o[ the
Stern triangular lot, half of tho
library lot and thp whole lot in
back of the Women's Gymnasium
on Lomita will be used exclusive
ly by automobiles bearing off
campus stickers. The circular ap
proach area to campus and most
of Lomita are also reserved for
off-campus students.
Oil-Campus Students
On-campus students must park
only in the dormitory lot desig
nated by their stickers. A new
parking lot next to the chemistry
building has been provided for use
by all on-campus students, and an
unrestricted lot opposite Florence
Moore Ilall is in the planning
stage.
All those who have not regis
tered their automobile, paid the
$3 registration fee and obtained
their sticker during registration
may do so at the campus police
station at the Corporation Yard.
The registration fee, another in
novation at Stanford, will be used
to pay for the enforcement of the
parking system. The money will
provide for an additional motor
cycle policeman, for the maps and
stickers and for many of the
parking signs. Any additional
money will go toward the main
tenance of the lots.
Any violation of the parking re
strictions will cost the offending
party $2. Stanford Police Chief
Gordon Davis has emphasized
that rigid enforcement is impos
sible and "everyone is on his
honor to make the system work
efficiently like it should. The
point is not how long you can
escape detection by the police.
The system is for the students'
own benefit."
Signs Not Put Up
Davis said that all the signs on
the restricted lots have not been
put up yet and urged students
with automobiles to follow the re
strictions on the colored maps dis
tributed during registration. The
signs will all be up within a week.
"After the signs are up, follow j
them rather than the map, as a
few minor changes have been
made since the map was printed,"
Davis said.
Davis urged Stern men to use
the northern lot reserved exclu
sively for them, and Crothers men
to use their portion of the library
lot. "Both lots are only half full
of cars at present, which means
the residents are using areas not
meant for them." Davis said.
