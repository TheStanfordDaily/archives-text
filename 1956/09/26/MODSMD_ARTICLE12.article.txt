# Segregationist Will Stand Trial For Alleged Sedition Violation
## John Kasper Arraigned by Tennessee Judge For Fomenting Mob Action at High School 
### 
CLINTON, Tenn., Sept. 25 (UP) John Kasper, a lone wolf crowd
baiter whom most other segregation leaders have found too hot to
handle, was ordered today to stand trial Nov. 5 on charges of vio
lating Tennessee sedition laws.
Kasper, 26, already is under sentence of one year in federal prison
for fomenting race trouble when a high school was integrated here

last month. The state charges
stem from the same incidents.
The Washington, D. C., While
Citizens Council leader was ar
raigned before Criminal Judge D.
L. Hutson on charges that he did
'"intentionally utter seditious
words" to "incite rebellious con
spiracies" and "riots" for the pur
pose of "stirring up people mali
ciously to conlrivp .the rulri and
destruction of the peace."
Rioting Quelled
Rioting here during the Labor
Day week end was quelled by
some TOO National Guardsmen
called in by Gov. Frank Clement
at the request of alarmed local of
ficials. Kasper was credited with
sparking anti-Negro demonstra
tions that led to riots.
He was arrested for the third !
time in Tennessee in less than a
month after a footrace with of
ficers policing a political rally last
night at nearby Oak Ridge.
A few hours earlier the Ander
son County grand jury had in
dicted Kasper on charges of in
citing riots against the integra
tion of all-white Clinton High
School, where 12 Negroes began
classes Aug. 27 for the first time.
Kasper Protests
Kasper showed up at the rally
to "protest the appearance" of
Gov. Clement at a district Demo
cratic rally held in a'huge parking
lot in front of a shopping center.
"I was completely surprised,"
Kasper sai*d of his arrest. Sheriff
Glad Woo d w a r d said he was
equally astonished at .seeing Kas
per, who was unaware he was
under indictment in Anderson
County.
Woodward spotted Kasper dur
ing a speech by Sen. Albert Gore,
who was heckled by a group of
some ,)() teen agers. A recorded
speech by Clement, who decided
not to attend, was booed so loudly
that the speakers had to be turned
up to full volume.
Kasper broke into a run when
Woodward approached. Constable
George Campbell clutched Kasper
by the eoattail and held the strug
gling man until others arrived.
Kasper, in handcuffs, was taken
to Clinton jail, but was released
shortly under $2000 bond.
