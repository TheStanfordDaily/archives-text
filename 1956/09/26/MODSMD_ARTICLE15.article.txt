# KEAR Staff On Strike for New Contract
## 
### 
KEAR, the Peninsula's classi
cal music radio station, is again
off (he air.
Its technicians and announcers
went on strike Monday morning
to protest the fact that they have
n't been given a contract since
their last one expired Feb. 1.
Steven A. Cisler, station owner,
announced immediately after the
shut-down that he did not plan to
put the station on the air again.
The Daily was unable to contact
Cisler for a later statement since
KEAR phones have been discon
nected and Cisler could not be
reached at his home.
KEAR had already been leased
to David Segal who plans to be
gin broadcasting Oct. 7 under the
call letters KOBY and under a
new "popular" program format.
The striking station employees,
who are affiliated with the Na
tional Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians, have
been picketing KEAR's offices in
San Mateo.
This is the latest in a series of
KEAR troubles, starting last
spring with Cisler's decision to
lease the station to Segal. A
group of stockholders headed by
Milton Stern Jr. protested be
cause they wanted the "fine
music" policy to be continued. As
yet they are still fighting to gain
control of the station's operating
company.
Then the Internal Revenue Bu
reau stepped in and closed the
station down for failure to pay
taxes. When Stanford students
ended spring quarter, the station
was off the air.
Cisler's FM station KXKX,
which also plays classical music
throughout the day, has not been
affected by the strike and is still
broadcasting.
