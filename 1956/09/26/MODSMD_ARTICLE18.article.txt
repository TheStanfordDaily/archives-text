# The 						Coffee Issue

Should thf. Cellar subsidize the live-cent cup
of rot fee?
We believe that the Union Board of Gov
ernors should reconsider the price issue if a
great number of students protest the dumping
of the subsidized nickel coffee as a Stanford
tradition.
Although coffee is a dime at most places in
the United States and Tresidder Memorial
Union must be built soon, we believe that stu
dent opinion should be heard before a final
decision is made.
We realize that the Union has to sustain a
loss each year when it does subsidize the five
cent cup of java. In fact, last year the Cellar
lost around $4000 subsidizing it.
In the past the Union board felt the tradi
tion was worth the loss. Last June 6 they de
cided that it wasn't.
Why? One of the most important reasons
why the hoard voted to abolish the tradition
was because Dean of Students 11. Donald Win
bigler presented a very strong argument for
the resolution to raise the price of a cup to 10
cents.
In the past the dean had always been for the
traditional angle. But at the meeting he be
lieved, and still does, that, "It is more impor
tant to make the Union completely solvent and
to build the new Tresidder Memorial Student
Union" than to continue subsidizing the five
cent coffee thereby draining the revenue
sources with which to build it.
Funds to build this new Union come from
different sources, the most important being
donations, fund-raising drives, Union dues ($1
per student each quarter) and the profit of
the present Union.
If the five-cent coffee loss of near $4000 each
year is wiped out or if it even makes a profit,

the new Union is that much nearer to being
l»iiilt.
Winbigler points ont that if the money* for
the new Union doesn't come from Union prof
its it will have to come from one of the j)ther
sources, one of which is tuition from which
the Union dues are taken.
"And would an increase in tuition," he said,
"justify five-cent coffee?"
But'an argument is made that $4000 may he
a drop in the bucket as far as costs of the new
Union are concerned, and profits from food
served at the Cellar make up for the deficit.
There is also a point that Cellar coffee may
not be worth 10 cents and that the tradition
of the five-cent cup is well worth keeping.
If students want their traditions and their
five-cent coffee, let them be heard. If they
think their morning, afternoon and evening
eye-opener is all right priced at 10 cents, then
it is only right that the proceeds from the cof
fee should go to the Union.
Another reason why the hoard went along
with the price hike was because it was backed
by a student for the first time in the history
of the issue. Then ASSU President George
Ralph was the one who astounded the hoard
by suggesting it raise the price to 10 cents ef
fective summer quarter.
One of Ralph's favorite arguments was that
there were a few non-coffee drinkers on the
campus and they should not have to bear the
brunt of this subsidization through an increase
in the Union dues. Whether or not this is a
strong argument is one question not readily
resolved.
Hut the fact that Stanford traditions are tak
ing the axe concerns us. Presuming that Stan
ford students care, we would like to see it stop
here—at the coffee level.
