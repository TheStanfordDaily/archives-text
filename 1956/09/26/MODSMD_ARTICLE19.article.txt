# End of the Washboard Road
## 
### 
There is another quasi-tradition ami to this
we hiil a fond farewell. This is the washboard,
rock-and-roll strip of pavement that led by
the Chemistry Building.
Both cars and drivers breathed a sigh of re
lict when, on returning to campus, they found
a new surface on the much-traveled road.
lu some cases, the old road served its pur
pose by slowing down traffic to a legal speed,

but in others, as we have noted, it led to
weird zig-zag courses around the humps that
found cars weaving dangerously into the oppo
site lane.
To strangers to the campus, it often meant
a rude shock.
We agree with the University road planners.
Let's leave corrugation to tin roofs and wash
boards.
