# CAMPUS OPINION
## Students Present Views On Cellar Coffee Price 
### 
With the recent hike in the
price of Cellar coffee, many con
troversies have arisen both for
and against the innovation. Stan
ford Union managers state they
are taking a loss on the sale of i
nickel coffee and that this deficit
is being made up from profits of
other Cellar foods.
On the other hand, five - cent
coffee has been a Stanford tradi
tion for years and years and is a
more popular purchase than any
other item on campus.
Cellar coffee drinkers have this
to say about 10-cent coffee:
Maryanna Gerbode, '60, Ruble:
"I think the Cellar's pretty fa
mous for its five-cent coffee, and
the spot will lose its unique po
sition with the 10-cent price. Per
haps the Stanford novelty could
still be retained with a happy
medium, say seven or eight
cents."
Joe Leahy, T>B, off-cam pus: "I
think it ought to be five cents.
San Jose Junior College still sells
five-cent coffee, why can't we? If
the first cup could cost a dime
and the second one a nickel, that
would be a little better."
Barry Bellport, '59, Village: "I
can't see Cellar coffee for 10
cents myself. It's good enough
for a nickel, but not good enough
for a dime."
Robert Mettler, '58, Villas'*': "I
think that as long as Cellar cof
fee is 10 cents, I can do without,
it. I think there could probably
be a compromise between five
and 10 cents, however."
Barbara Snidow, '60, Roble: "I
think it should definitely be a
nickel even if there is a loss and
continue subsidizing it as done in
the past."
Hank Basik, graduate, off-cam
pus: "I'm completely indifferent
and I'll go along with whatever
they charge."
Jim Sutherland, '59, Delta Up
silon: "I think it's much better
to make a profit on other things
and keep coffee at a nickel. That
way they could advertise the only
nickel cup around. People almost
always buy something with their
coffee and the profit could be
made on the 'extra.' "
Jan Benninger, '59, Jordan:
"Tradition is nice, but since the
price of everything has gone up
I don't think that coffee should
be excluded either."
Curt Tankin, '58, Village: "Last
year when UCLA students were
up here for the game, they com
mented favorably and agreeably
on the price of Cellar coffee and

I think we should keep up this
popular tradition."
Dick Meister, graduate, off
campus: "It's strange that the
only mark the "great reformer
president" George Ralph will
leave on the Stanford scene is an
increase in the price of Cellar cof
fee. At five cents it was hardly
worth the cost, at 10 cents it's ri
diculous."
Molly Irby, '59, Lagunita:
"More people drink coffee than
anything else at the Cellar and I
think it is right they should make
a profit on something else other
than coffee."

increase in the price of Cellar cof
fee. At five cents it was hardly
worth the cost, at 10 cents it's ri
diculous."
Molly Irby, '59, Lagunita:
"More people drink coffee than
anything else at the Cellar and I
think it is right they should make
a profit on something else other
than coffee."
With the recent hike in the
price of Cellar coffee, many con
troversies have arisen both for
and against the innovation. Stan
ford Union managers state they
are taking a loss on the sale of i
nickel coffee and that this deficit
is being made up from profits of
other Cellar foods.
On the other hand, five - cent
coffee has been a Stanford tradi
tion for years and years and is a
more popular purchase than any
other item on campus.
Cellar coffee drinkers have this
to say about 10-cent coffee:
Maryanna Gerbode, '60, Ruble:
"I think the Cellar's pretty fa
mous for its five-cent coffee, and
the spot will lose its unique po
sition with the 10-cent price. Per
haps the Stanford novelty could
still be retained with a happy
medium, say seven or eight
cents."
Joe Leahy, T>B, off-cam pus: "I
think it ought to be five cents.
San Jose Junior College still sells
five-cent coffee, why can't we? If
the first cup could cost a dime
and the second one a nickel, that
would be a little better."
Barry Bellport, '59, Village: "I
can't see Cellar coffee for 10
cents myself. It's good enough
for a nickel, but not good enough
for a dime."
Robert Mettler, '58, Villas'*': "I
think that as long as Cellar cof
fee is 10 cents, I can do without,
it. I think there could probably
be a compromise between five
and 10 cents, however."
Barbara Snidow, '60, Roble: "I
think it should definitely be a
nickel even if there is a loss and
continue subsidizing it as done in
the past."
Hank Basik, graduate, off-cam
pus: "I'm completely indifferent
and I'll go along with whatever
they charge."
Jim Sutherland, '59, Delta Up
silon: "I think it's much better
to make a profit on other things
and keep coffee at a nickel. That
way they could advertise the only
nickel cup around. People almost
always buy something with their
coffee and the profit could be
made on the 'extra.' "
Jan Benninger, '59, Jordan:
"Tradition is nice, but since the
price of everything has gone up
I don't think that coffee should
be excluded either."
Curt Tankin, '58, Village: "Last
year when UCLA students were
up here for the game, they com
mented favorably and agreeably
on the price of Cellar coffee and

I think we should keep up this
popular tradition."
Dick Meister, graduate, off
campus: "It's strange that the
only mark the "great reformer
president" George Ralph will
leave on the Stanford scene is an
increase in the price of Cellar cof
fee. At five cents it was hardly
worth the cost, at 10 cents it's ri
diculous."
