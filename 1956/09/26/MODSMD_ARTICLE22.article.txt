# Axe Stolen Last Quarter With No Clues in Sight
## 
### 
Early one morning during fi
nals week last spring quarter, a
person or persons, unknown en
tered the Stanford Cellar and
stole the Stanford Axe, football
symbol of this University.
A window near the case con
taining the Axe somehow was
left unlocked.
It is supposed by the campus
police that the bullet-proof glass
of the case was destroyed by
heating it with a portable acety
lene torch, then throwing cold
water on the glass. This broke
the outer layer of the quarter
inch laminated glass.
The glass was alternately heat
ed and cooled and chipped away
with a hammer. When the hole
was large enough to remove the
Axe, whoever did it cut his hand
on the glass while taking it out
of the case.
For days after the theft, all
persons wearing a bandage on
their hands were suspects.
A student from Stern Hall came
over to the Cellar on the night of
the theft, heard banging noises
coming from the area in which
the Axe was kept ,but decided not
to investigate. One of the Union
employees claimed to have heard
strange noises during the night,
but he, too, declined to investi
gate.
At least everyone is sure it
wasn't Cal this time. Campus au
thorities are certain it was an
"inside job."
