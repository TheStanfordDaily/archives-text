# Hard-Running Michigan State Backs Battle Stanford's Sharp Aerial Game
## Kowalczyk Injury Places Halfback On 'Doubtful' List 
### Dean Stewart 
Michigan State's Spartans of
East Lansing are a well-named
team. Like their Greek ancestors
they prefer to do things the hard,
rugged way when it comes to
football. The only difference is
these modern Apollos make it
look easy.
Blessed with the finest group
of running backs in the nation,
the Spartans figure to literally
run over their opposition. Two
large halfbacks (210 pounds
each), Clarence Peaks and Walt
Kowalczyk, form the nucleus of
the MSli backfield. Both men are
fast and capable of making holes
in defensive lines where none ex
isted before.
Peaks' Male
However, Peaks' running mate,
Kowalc/yk, may not see action.
Hp suffered a severe ankle sprain
two weeks ago and a cast was re
moved only last weekend. Ko
walczyk compiled a 7.1 rushing
average l , in 1955 and was tabbed
Ihe hardest running back in the
Big Ten. His loss would be a se
vere blow to Michigan State's
cause. He will make the trip,
however, in case the ankle should
be well enough to run on by
game time.
Stanford does not possess a
running backfield of Michigan
State's caliber. Nonetheless, the
Indian runners are reliable, expe
rienced players who can get the
job done. Fullback Lou Valli ap
pears to have shaken his knee in
juries and should be headed to
ward a fine season. In the Wash
ington State game last Saturday
Valli took a hand-off from Gordy
Young who had just fielded a
WSC punt, and Valli returned it
44 yards to set up the first Card
touchdown. A few plays later he
plowed over for the score.
Young, Camera Runners
Halfback Gordy Young, who
has already turned in two valu
able years, has indicated he is on
his way toward adding a third.
Paul Camera, the other halfback,
is a good runner and a top re
ceiver. His 22 receptions last
year place him second to John
Stewart on the Stanford squad.
Camera was second in the PCC
and 15th in the nation.
Herman Hickman, football ex
pert for Sports Illustrated, de
scribes the Spartan line as "pleth
oric" which means full of body,
overloaded, bombastic. In other
words they're big. Center John
Matsko, guard Dan Currie and
end Dave Kaiser anchor the MSU
line.
Stopping the Michigan State
ground attack is the main objec

tive of the Stanford line. All-
American Paul Wiggin, Donn
Carswell, Bub Long, Noel Robin
son and Steve Docter will be kept
busy all afternoon. Carl Isaacs,
Joel Freis, Jerry Beatie and Gary
Van Galder form the finest group
of ends in the West. They will be
responsible for stopping wide
sweeps by the speedy Spartan
backs.
Question Marks
However, every team has its
question marks. Michigan State
is no exception.
Gone from their dream back
field is All-American quarterback
Earl Morrall. Also missing are
All-Americans Norm Masters and
Buck Nystrom. Linemen of their
high caliber are not replaced
overnight. Fullback Gerry Pla
nut is and left end John Lewis
will also be sorely missed.
To the last man the varsity
predicts a Stanford victory. Anx
ious to avenge the 38-14 drubbing
they took at East Lansing last
year, they speak with the confi
dence of a poised team. Co-cap
tain' Paul Wiggin summed up the
team's feelings:
"We don't expect to stop their
running game. But I think we
can contain it. We've got great
passing. Good enough to win."


PASS-SNAGGING HALFBACK —Left half Paul Camera, who fig
ures prominently in Coach Chulk Taylor's plans for Michigan State
this Saturday, came into his own last season. Last fall he was
second high on the squad in minutes played and in pass receptions.
Always known to be a fine defensive player and excellent blocker,
Paul became a strong offensive threat in 1955 as a ball carrier as
well as a receiver.

Question Marks
However, every team has its
question marks. Michigan State
is no exception.
Gone from their dream back
field is All-American quarterback
Earl Morrall. Also missing are
All-Americans Norm Masters and
Buck Nystrom. Linemen of their
high caliber are not replaced
overnight. Fullback Gerry Pla
nut is and left end John Lewis
will also be sorely missed.
To the last man the varsity
predicts a Stanford victory. Anx
ious to avenge the 38-14 drubbing
they took at East Lansing last
year, they speak with the confi
dence of a poised team. Co-cap
tain' Paul Wiggin summed up the
team's feelings:
"We don't expect to stop their
running game. But I think we
can contain it. We've got great
passing. Good enough to win."


PASS-SNAGGING HALFBACK —Left half Paul Camera, who fig
ures prominently in Coach Chulk Taylor's plans for Michigan State
this Saturday, came into his own last season. Last fall he was
second high on the squad in minutes played and in pass receptions.
Always known to be a fine defensive player and excellent blocker,
Paul became a strong offensive threat in 1955 as a ball carrier as
well as a receiver.
Michigan State's Spartans of
East Lansing are a well-named
team. Like their Greek ancestors
they prefer to do things the hard,
rugged way when it comes to
football. The only difference is
these modern Apollos make it
look easy.
Blessed with the finest group
of running backs in the nation,
the Spartans figure to literally
run over their opposition. Two
large halfbacks (210 pounds
each), Clarence Peaks and Walt
Kowalczyk, form the nucleus of
the MSli backfield. Both men are
fast and capable of making holes
in defensive lines where none ex
isted before.
Peaks' Male
However, Peaks' running mate,
Kowalc/yk, may not see action.
Hp suffered a severe ankle sprain
two weeks ago and a cast was re
moved only last weekend. Ko
walczyk compiled a 7.1 rushing
average l , in 1955 and was tabbed
Ihe hardest running back in the
Big Ten. His loss would be a se
vere blow to Michigan State's
cause. He will make the trip,
however, in case the ankle should
be well enough to run on by
game time.
Stanford does not possess a
running backfield of Michigan
State's caliber. Nonetheless, the
Indian runners are reliable, expe
rienced players who can get the
job done. Fullback Lou Valli ap
pears to have shaken his knee in
juries and should be headed to
ward a fine season. In the Wash
ington State game last Saturday
Valli took a hand-off from Gordy
Young who had just fielded a
WSC punt, and Valli returned it
44 yards to set up the first Card
touchdown. A few plays later he
plowed over for the score.
Young, Camera Runners
Halfback Gordy Young, who
has already turned in two valu
able years, has indicated he is on
his way toward adding a third.
Paul Camera, the other halfback,
is a good runner and a top re
ceiver. His 22 receptions last
year place him second to John
Stewart on the Stanford squad.
Camera was second in the PCC
and 15th in the nation.
Herman Hickman, football ex
pert for Sports Illustrated, de
scribes the Spartan line as "pleth
oric" which means full of body,
overloaded, bombastic. In other
words they're big. Center John
Matsko, guard Dan Currie and
end Dave Kaiser anchor the MSU
line.
Stopping the Michigan State
ground attack is the main objec

tive of the Stanford line. All-
American Paul Wiggin, Donn
Carswell, Bub Long, Noel Robin
son and Steve Docter will be kept
busy all afternoon. Carl Isaacs,
Joel Freis, Jerry Beatie and Gary
Van Galder form the finest group
of ends in the West. They will be
