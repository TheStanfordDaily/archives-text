# Adlai Asks South to Accept School Integration Calmly
## Again Opposes Government Use of Force; Arkansans Applaud Demo Candidate's Request 
### 
NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 25 (UP) Adlai E. Stevenson drew ap
plause from Southerners today when he asked them to accept the
Supreme Court decision against segregated schools as '"law-abiding
citizens." Then he attacked the Republicans for "stubborn opposi
tion" to "every new idea."
Stevenson was applauded twice when he took up the touchy item

of segregation before a crowd es
timated by police at 4000 in Mac-
Arthur Park at Little Rock, Ark.
TM e Democratic presidential
nominee later flew to New Or
leans to take up the cudgel
against tho other party. To Presi
dent Eisenhower's remark last
week that the Democrats were
"walking into the past backward,"
Stevenson had a reply.
He said this was "strange criti
cism," coming from "a party that
has always had to be dragged into
the future backward . . . that has
stubbornly opposed almost every
forward-looking step . . ."
Stevenson spoke in New Or
leans at tho city hall. He was to
fly to Miami Beach tonight to
make an address at Bay Front
Municipal Auditorium.
Listeners Applaud
Tho candidate told a predomi
nantly white' audience at Little
Rock that, while "some of you
feel strongly to the contrary," he
believes the Supreme Court's
school ruling was "right."
His listeners applauded when
he went on to say that what is
"most important" is that, now
that the decision has been handed
down, "we accept that decision as
law-abiding citizens."
"Our common goal is the order
ly accomplishment, of the result
decreed by the court," Stevenson
said.
Against Force
There was moderate applause
again when Stevenson added that
he stands "squarely" on the Dem
ocratic platform statement reject
ing the use of force to implement
tho court's ruling.
"I am confident that the deci
sion will be carried out in the
! manner prescribed by the courts,"
I he said.
Meanwhile, in Grand Rapids,
I Mich., Democratic vice presiden
tial candidate Estes Kofauvor
blamed President Eisenhower for
the defeat of school construction
and atomic power plant bills in
the last session of Congress.
School Construction
And, Kefauver added, Mr. Eis
enhower "turned on the heat
which produced the heaviest lob
bying in this session of Congress
to defeat" a Democratic-sponsored
bill that would have provided for
the federal government to build
atomic power plants.
"President Eisenhower, at what
ever cost to those regions of the
country which are short on |x)wer,
wants to maintain the grip of pri
| vate utilities on the right to pro
duce electric power from atomic
cne r g y," Kefauver said in a
speech prepared for delivery at
i a Democratic rally here.

he went on to say that what is
"most important" is that, now
that the decision has been handed

And, Kefauver added, Mr. Eis
enhower "turned on the heat
which produced the heaviest lob
bying in this session of Congress
to defeat" a Democratic-sponsored
bill that would have provided for
the federal government to build
atomic power plants.
"President Eisenhower, at what
ever cost to those regions of the
country which are short on |x)wer,
wants to maintain the grip of pri

of segregation before a crowd es
timated by police at 4000 in Mac-
Arthur Park at Little Rock, Ark.

nominee later flew to New Or

the future backward . . . that has
stubbornly opposed almost every
forward-looking step . . ."
