# Carswell Play On Stellar Line Vital Factor
## 
### 
If Michigan State's Walt Ko
walczyk and Clarencp Peaks are
planning on gaining much yard
age through the Stanford line
Saturday, they'll find they must
first settle matters with husky
Donn Carswell.
One of last year's returning
regulars, Cars we 1 1 has been
counted on to play a vital role in
the Cards' conference title bid.
Judging from his play in the*
Washington State rqyt, Carswell
is well on his way to a great sen
ior season.
In his junior year, Carswell
played in all ten of the Stanford
games, averaging nearly 40 min
utes a contest in ranking seventh
among the Indians in total time
played.
Weighing in at 206 pounds and
standing an even six feet, Cars
well runs into many guards big
ger than himself, but rarely—if
ever—comes off second best.
Carswell came to the Farm in
1953. He was an immediate
standout on the Frosh squad, and
was named the outstanding play
er on the team.
Despite several injuries during
his sophomore season, Carswell
got into eight of the ten games,
in 1955 he came into his own,
teaming with Joe Long and Paul
Wiggin to provide the real punch
of the Indian forward wall.
Should the Michigan State run
ners fail to get through Carswell
and the Spartans decide to pass,
they will still have trouble. Cars
well, in addition to being noted
for his tackling ability, is adept
at rushing the passer.
