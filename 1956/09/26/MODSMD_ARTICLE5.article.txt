Another glorious old tradi
tion bites (lie dust a< Stanford.
That tooth-rattling, bone-jar
ring portion of road opposite
the Chemistry building was
fixed this summer.
University officials had kept
the portion of road, familiar to
years of campus drivers, in its
state of disrepair mainly to
slow down traffic. "The stu
dents were .just going too fast,"
says Assistant University Busi
ness Manager Seraphim Post,
"and this forced them to slow
down.
Hut with the development of
the campus drive road system,
officials decided that the extra
traffic necesistated fixing the
road. So for $5500 the road is
at last repaired, but not be
cause they felt sorry for the
drivers. (See editorial, page 2.)
