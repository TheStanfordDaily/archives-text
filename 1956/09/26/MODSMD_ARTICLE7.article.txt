# Ike Promises Full Income To Farmers
## President Says Rigid 90 Per Cent Supports Amount to 'Mockery' 
### 
PEORIA, 111., Sept. 25 (UP) —
President Eisenhower tonight
promised the farmers that the
GOP "full income parity" pro
gram would lead their plows to
the brightest peacetime agricul
tural prosperity "in years."
The chief executive, in the first
major farm speech of his re-elec
tion campaign, said rigid price
supports fixed at 90 per cent of
parity without regard to supply
conditions — favored largely by
Democrats in Congress, but by
some Republicans, too—amount
ed to "mockery and deceit" for
the farmer.
Eisenhower flew here from
Washington this afternoon and
spoke tonight in the masive field
house of Bradley University. He
was scheduled to fly back to
Washington shortly after his ad
dress, which was carried nation
ally by radio and television.
Vigorous Attack
Seldom has the President since
taking office attacked the Demo
crats with such vigor as he did
in his prepared address tonight.
He blamed (he decline in farm
prices after World War II on
the "political expediency" of the
Democrats. He said they oper
ated their farm program with
"synthetic farmers behind Wash
ington desks" and "farming looks
mighty easy when your plow is
a pencil."
He said the Democrats piled up
huge surpluses of farm commodi
ties for political reasons. He
called the Democrats "fast - talk
ing" but "slow-acting."
On the subject of parity, Eisen
hower harked back to his now
famous 1952 campaign speech at
Kasson, Minn., when he came out
for full parity. He said then, in
advocating a fair share of the na
tional income for the farmer, "A
fair share is not merely 90 per
cent of parity—it. is full parity."
Market Place Parity
The President and other Re
publicans later explained that he
meant full, or 100 per cent, par
ity "in the market place." In oth
er words, he believed that reduc
tion of surpluses by the govern
ment would impove the farmer's
position in the market.
Tonight he said, "Full income
parity is a full share of our coun
try's good times."
"In a free agriculture," he con
tinued, "farmers attain that kind
of parity only in the market
place. That's what I spoke for at
Kasson four years ago—the at
tainment of that full share for
the farmer—the preservation of
a free agriculture. That's what
I've been working for. I shall
kqcp on working for it."

crats with such vigor as he did
in his prepared address tonight.
He blamed (he decline in farm
prices after World War II on
the "political expediency" of the
Democrats. He said they oper
ated their farm program with
"synthetic farmers behind Wash
ington desks" and "farming looks
mighty easy when your plow is
a pencil."
He said the Democrats piled up
huge surpluses of farm commodi
ties for political reasons. He
called the Democrats "fast - talk
ing" but "slow-acting."
On the subject of parity, Eisen
hower harked back to his now
famous 1952 campaign speech at
Kasson, Minn., when he came out
for full parity. He said then, in
advocating a fair share of the na
tional income for the farmer, "A
fair share is not merely 90 per
cent of parity—it. is full parity."
Market Place Parity
The President and other Re
publicans later explained that he
meant full, or 100 per cent, par
ity "in the market place." In oth
er words, he believed that reduc
tion of surpluses by the govern
ment would impove the farmer's
position in the market.
Tonight he said, "Full income
parity is a full share of our coun
try's good times."
"In a free agriculture," he con
tinued, "farmers attain that kind
of parity only in the market
place. That's what I spoke for at
Kasson four years ago—the at
tainment of that full share for
the farmer—the preservation of
a free agriculture. That's what
I've been working for. I shall
kqcp on working for it."
PEORIA, 111., Sept. 25 (UP) —
President Eisenhower tonight
promised the farmers that the
GOP "full income parity" pro
gram would lead their plows to
the brightest peacetime agricul
tural prosperity "in years."
The chief executive, in the first
major farm speech of his re-elec
tion campaign, said rigid price
supports fixed at 90 per cent of
parity without regard to supply
conditions — favored largely by
Democrats in Congress, but by
some Republicans, too—amount
ed to "mockery and deceit" for
the farmer.
Eisenhower flew here from
Washington this afternoon and
spoke tonight in the masive field
house of Bradley University. He
was scheduled to fly back to
Washington shortly after his ad
dress, which was carried nation
ally by radio and television.
Vigorous Attack
Seldom has the President since
taking office attacked the Demo
crats with such vigor as he did
in his prepared address tonight.
