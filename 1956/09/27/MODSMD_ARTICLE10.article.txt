# Station KEAR 'Dead Forever' Says Owner
## Striking Staff Plans To Continue Picketing For Contract, Wages 
### 
Radio station KEAR is "dead
forever," according to its present
owner Stephen A. Cisler.
The fine music station went off
the air Monday when its techni
cians and engineers began pick
eting for a new contract. Before
the strike began, Cisler had com
pleted plans to sell KEAR to Bay
Radio Incorporated. Its represen
tative David Segal plans to take
over the station Oct. 7 under the
call letters KOBY.
Cisler's FM station, which had
also been shut down, went back
on the air yesterday using an en
tirely new non-union staff except
for the program manager. Cis
ler explained that this station,
KXKX, is owned by Electric Cor
poration and has no connection
with KEAR.
Really One Staff
Mii:e Chamberlin, one of the
striking announcer • technicians,
said the two stations had used
the same staff and he considered
the two stations as one. He be
lieved yesterday afternoon that
KXKX was still on strike.
The National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Tech
nicians, the strikers' union, plans
to keep picketing KEAll's trans
mitter, San Francisco office and
the FM station until Oct. 7 if ncc
esary, according to Chamberlin.
Chamberlin said they want both
a contract to replace their last
one, which expired Feb. 1, and
back wages which have not been
paid.
Cisler said wages had been
paid except for the last few days?
before the station went off tiie
air and these would be paid
whenever the striking staff mem
bers furnished their time cards.
No Renewal
The employees' contract was
not renewed, according to Ci ler,
because a year ago he had of
fered the union a two-year con
tract and they refused that one
and demanded a one- year con
tract instead. When that expired,
he said, he was in the process of
disposing of the station and gave
the staff notice then of the im
pending sale.
Before Feb. 1 the union opened
no negotiations for a new eon
tract, Cisler added.
Atta«'l<'» Announcer
Cisler termed Chamberlin "'he
number one troublemaker" atid
siid he considered him the cause
of most of the trouble.
KXKX will change its call let
ters to KEAR and increase its
power, its owner explained. He
also said that he had plans for a
new AM station but could not
disclose them at this time.
The old KEAR. under its new
call letters KOBY, will become a
popular music station instead of
the classical music policy it has
previously followed.
