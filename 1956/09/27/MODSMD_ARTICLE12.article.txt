Band is probably the largest of
such organizations on the West
Coast it has been unable to fill
its uniforms this week.
But the problem is not lack of
manpower; rather, it is the size
and shape in which the man
power comes.
For many a year the band has
had minor uniform fitting prob
lems at the beginning of each
autumn quarter but rarely has
il had such a high percentage of
members who buy their clothing
in the hoys' department.
A spokesman for the organiza
tion reports that more than a
quarter of the members are
freshmen, most of whom could he
mistaken for junior high school
boys il judged by size.
New Uniforms '
When the band obtained 120
new uniforms last year, the out
fits were made for average-size
college men. With so many "jun
ior-size" members it became nec
essary •<» send a whole flock of
uniforms to the Roos Bros, alter
ation department.
If all goes on schedule the
members by performance time
will be able to fit their uniforms
as far as size is concerned.
The one remaining problem,
however, will be number. The
band has 130 members; there are
120 uniforms. It's a far cry from
the days when it was necessary
to bang on Encina doors and beg
men to join the band. Director
Jules Shuchat commented.
Membership Closes
It became necessary to close
the membership list Monday
night when a large number
turned out to audition. A waiting
list now exists and those on the
may possibly serve as alter
nates or replacements.
During winter and spring quar
ters the band will divide in two
the Concert and Symphonic
bands. Women will be admitted
to both.
But regardless of sizes or
shapes of its members, the Con
cert Band will have no clothing
problem, for the uniforms are
fucked away at the end of foot
ball season and members don
dark clothing such as that worn
by orchestra personnel.
