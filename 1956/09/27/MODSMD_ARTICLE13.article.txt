# 6500 Autos Registered As Parking Rules Begin
## Dormitory Lot Rules In Effect at All Times, Academic Area 8 to 5 
### 
A rccord 6500 automobiles have
been registered during the two
days of registration, according to
Gordon Davis, Stanford chief of
police.
All 2259 off-campus stickers
were used, but additional stickers
will be available at the police sta
tion next to the Corporation Yard
this morning.
The 6500 include all parking
on the University grounds, stu
dents, faculty and staff. Many
more are expected before the end
of the automobile registration pe
riod next week.
Davis derfied that the unex
pected number of off - campus
stickers could be due to students
lying about their residence in
order to gain off-campus parking
privileges.
Enrollment Increase
"There was an unexpected in
crease in the University enroll
ment as a whole, and the in
creased automobile registration
reflects it. Besides, rather severe
penalties would probably be dealt
to those lying about their resi
dence."
Most of the unexpected enroll
ment was due to an increase in
graduate students, according to
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of stu
dents. Most of these graduates
live off campus, accounting for
the increase in off-campus auto
mobiles.
Davis also emphasized that
many of the parking lot restric
tions were in force 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. All dor
mitory lots are reserved exclu
sively for their residents at all
times. The time limit zones in
front of Wilbur, Branner and
Stern are always enforceable.
Class Hours
The parking zones in the aca
demic area of campus and most
of the streets are in force only
during class hours, / Monday
through Friday, 8 to 5. Davis
urged students to look at the
signs posted at the lots, if in
doubt as to the restrictions.
"The on-campus lot next to the
Chemistry building is reserved
only for on-campus students dur
ing class hours, and that includes
faculty and staff as well as off
campus students."
"And though it is not marked
in red on the map, Escondido
from the education building to
Stern is reserved for off-campus
students on both sides.
Crothers Area
"Crothers residents should use
the area allotted for them in back
of the library, instead of the
Stern area as they are now do
ing."
Lots reserved exclusively for
off-campus students are located
in back of the Women's Gymna
sium on Lomita, the northern
portion of the Stern triangular
lot, and half of the Library lot.
The circular approach area to
campus and most of Lomita is
also set off for off-campus stu
dents.
A lot for unrestricted use is
planned across from Florence
Moore but will not be ready this
school year. •
Fine for any parking violation
is $2. A new motorcycle police
man has been hired with the
money from automobile registra
tion to help enforce the parking
regulations.

campus and most of Lomita is
also set off for off-campus stu
dents.
A lot for unrestricted use is
planned across from Florence
Moore but will not be ready this
school year. •
Fine for any parking violation
is $2. A new motorcycle police
man has been hired with the
money from automobile registra
tion to help enforce the parking
regulations.
A rccord 6500 automobiles have
been registered during the two
days of registration, according to
Gordon Davis, Stanford chief of
police.
All 2259 off-campus stickers
were used, but additional stickers
will be available at the police sta
tion next to the Corporation Yard
this morning.
The 6500 include all parking
on the University grounds, stu
dents, faculty and staff. Many
more are expected before the end
of the automobile registration pe
riod next week.
Davis derfied that the unex
pected number of off - campus
stickers could be due to students
lying about their residence in
order to gain off-campus parking
privileges.
Enrollment Increase
"There was an unexpected in
crease in the University enroll
ment as a whole, and the in
creased automobile registration
reflects it. Besides, rather severe
penalties would probably be dealt
to those lying about their resi
dence."
Most of the unexpected enroll
ment was due to an increase in
graduate students, according to
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of stu
dents. Most of these graduates
live off campus, accounting for
the increase in off-campus auto
mobiles.
Davis also emphasized that
many of the parking lot restric
tions were in force 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. All dor
mitory lots are reserved exclu
sively for their residents at all
times. The time limit zones in
front of Wilbur, Branner and
Stern are always enforceable.
Class Hours
The parking zones in the aca
demic area of campus and most
of the streets are in force only
during class hours, / Monday
through Friday, 8 to 5. Davis
urged students to look at the
signs posted at the lots, if in
doubt as to the restrictions.
"The on-campus lot next to the
Chemistry building is reserved
only for on-campus students dur
ing class hours, and that includes
faculty and staff as well as off
campus students."
"And though it is not marked
in red on the map, Escondido
from the education building to
Stern is reserved for off-campus
students on both sides.
Crothers Area
"Crothers residents should use
the area allotted for them in back
of the library, instead of the
Stern area as they are now do
ing."
Lots reserved exclusively for
off-campus students are located
in back of the Women's Gymna
sium on Lomita, the northern
portion of the Stern triangular
lot, and half of the Library lot.
