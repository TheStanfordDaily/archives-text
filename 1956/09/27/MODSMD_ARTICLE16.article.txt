"When the President is weak,
and when he does not fight re
lentlessly for the public welfare,
then the cause for public welfare
loses its greatest champion," he
said.
Eisenhower "Vacuum"
"Politics, like nature, abhors a
vacuum," he said. "When the pub
lic interest moves out of the White
House, the private interests move
in."
Stevenson said the Democratic
party "has always believed in a
strong Presidency," while the Re
publicans "most often" have be
lieved in a "weak Presidency" in
the past.
"And what has been true in the
past, by and large, has never been
more true than today," he said.
Stevenson said he was not talk
ing about "the President's health
or any personal aspect of the situ
ation in Washington" in discuss
ing the need for a strong Presi
dency.
Rejects Leadership
"I am talking, rather, about
what has seemed to me his philo
sophical attitude toward the office
and his consistent rejection of (he
positive responsibilities of leader
ship a rejection that began, not
last fall, but in January 1953," he
said.
Stevenson said that, although
Republicans controlled Congress
in 1953 and 1954, Mr. Eisenhower
"did little" to see that his legis

"The Republican Congress tore
the Republican President's state
of-the-Union message into little
bits and pieces and scattered tliem
to the winds and the President
watched in silence, at least public
silence," said Stevenson.
