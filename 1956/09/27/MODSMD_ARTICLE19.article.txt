# Revolt Against Cellar Coffee Hike Continues
## 
### 
One protest movement against
five-cent Cellar coffee has appar
ently failed, but a newer and
stronger one may rise in its
wake .
Bill Duke, head yell leader,
early this week had a plan to sell
coffee at five cents in competi
tion with the Cellar.
Cohorts in the scheme, .Tim
Walters, last year's head yell
leader, and George Koenig, nf
fered to obtain coffee wholesale
at 57 cents a pound. Each pound
would make 48 cups. "With five
labor," Duke said, "the coffee
could be sold for as little as two
cents a cup. But we planned to
sell it for five cents and give the
throe cents profit to the Con
Home."
Then it was discovered that a
University permit was needed for
any kind of concession stand.
Since Duke's booth would be set
up right next lo the Cellar, the
conspirators realized their cause
was hopeless .
"Now we have only one re
course left," said Duke, "that is a
picket line." At present, this
year's yell leaders are planning
their strategy, complete with pro
test marchers bearing large
signs.
"We believe that five-cent Cel
lar coffee is worth fighting for,"
explained Duke.
