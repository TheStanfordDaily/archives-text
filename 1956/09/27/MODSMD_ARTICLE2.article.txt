The Stanford administration
can do nothing about the viola

Last year the University had a
working agreement with the Al
coholic Beverage Commission
that any cases of student drink
ing would be turned over to the
Stanford administration and

If the district attorney does
agree to turn the cases over to
Stanford, they will go to Men's
and Women's Councils as in the
past, said Craig. If the students
are kept in court, the problem of
suspension will still be up to
Men's and Women's Councils.
