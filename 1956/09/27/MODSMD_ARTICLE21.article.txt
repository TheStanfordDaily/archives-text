# The 						Axe Is Gone
## 
### 
The Stanford Axk, traditional trophy of the
I Iniversity, is gone. Who took it and where it
is are matters of relative unimportance. The
important issue is: What is being done about
it?
Practically nothing. Twenty-five years ago,
if someone had stolen or even attempted to
steal the Stanford Axe, students would have
arisen and thirsted for blood. Searching par
ties would have gone out. Deep plots would
have been laid to raid the University of Cali
fornia to recover the Axe, they being the logi
cal suspects.
Last year, after Stanford had won the Big
Game and the Axe had been returned to its
original home, it was decided by the students
to place the Axe in a burglar-proof case in the
Cellar where it could be on view.
While it is not definitely known just who it
was that stole the Axe after breaking into the
ease with toreh and sledgehammer, the general
opinion expressed by persons on campus is that
it was an "inside" job.
He that as it may, practically no hue and cry
was raised when it was discovered the Axe
was gone. Students were observed viewing the
empty case, at first with surprise, and then
with amusement.
In the earlier days of this University, such
amusement would have been called sacrilege.
I wenty-live years ago, a student viewing the

empty ease would have been expected to get
boiling mad and rush off with blood in his eye
to do malice to the person who had done such
a heinous deed.
This did not happen last year. All the empty
ease received was a smile and perhaps a grudg
ing admiration for the thieves who took the
Axe from under the noses of the entire student
body and campus poliee.
\\ hat does this signify?
Perhaps the modern at least at Stan
ford, is becoming the adult the administration
is constantly telling him he is.
Can this be the attitude that makes Rally
Com and the cheer leaders sweat so hard to
get. Stanford"students to respond and create a
decent rally? Why is it that each year it is
harder and harder to get the freshmen to col
lect enough wood for an acceptable bonfire for
the Big (iame Kally?
Possibly this whole attitude toward the rah
rah form of college is not a lack of "spirit," as
so many people claim, but a growing awareness
to the real responsibilities of life. Sure, they
still have fun, but it could be that the trend is
toward a less childish form of fun.
One hears a great deal about "decadent"
American youth. Could it be that American
youth, at least that part that attends Stanford,
is putting its "spirit" in the proper perspec
tive? â€¢
