### 
Sparing tiik Democrats no blows, President
Eisenhower Tuesday night launched with full
furv into the 1956 campaign for the farmers'
vote.
Biting with heavily-charged words at the
Democrats lor creating the farm dilemma and
then failing to spell out exactly how his Admin
istration would arrive at "full parity in the mar
ket place' outside of the partial soil bank
remedy, Eisenhower gave gome indication in
this speech that he would not remain aloof
from the rough and tumble of the campaign,
as indeed lie should not.
In an issue as complex and far-reaching as
the farm problem, statistics can be manipii

lated by each side to show either that pros
perity is just around the corner or that the
problem of growing surpluses and diminishing
(arm income is as severe as before.
I he fact that Eisenhower as well as Steven
son and Kefauver ;irr devoting considerable
attention to the farmers* dilemma this early in
the campaign attests to the fact that a problem
does exist, that farm income has slid rapidly
downward since the Korean War and that the
parity r;ilio (or the farmer is still disastrously
low. . •
I he voters deserve from both Stevenson and
Eisenhower a picture of just how they would
solve the issue. Mere statistics and review of
each party's records are not sufficient.
