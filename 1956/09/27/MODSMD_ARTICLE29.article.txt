a "customer complains to me about
the price of gasoline, I call my wife.
"She's worked right with me and kept our
books since we leased our first Union Oil sta
tion on this same corner in La Canada, 20
years ago.
"And —as Myrtle says—gasoline hasn't gone
up nearly as much as other things you buy.

You pay 205% more to build a house today
than you did in 1936. 220% more for a low
price 2-door sedan. 125% more for a suit of
clothes. 325% more for a pound of sirloin steak.
"Yet if you leave out the tax, Union's premium
gasoline has gone up only 70% in that same
time. Fact is, the tax has gone up more than
the gasoline—loo%! And two gallons of
Union's new Royal 76 will do the work of three
gallons of our old product.
"You get a lot of service for nothing, too. We
wash your car's windshield. We check water,

oil, battery and tires. We provide clean rest
rooms and free maps for your convenience.
"Fact is, you never got so much for your money
as you do today when you say, 'Fill her up!'"

In 1956 it costs Union Oil 250% more than it
ciici in 1936 to build the kind of service station
Charles and Myrtle Santman operate in La
Canada, California.
Yet in spite of continually rising costs like
this we have been able to keep prices down,
while constantly expanding our service and
improving our product.
We have accomplished this bv plowing prof
its back into better facilities, by research, by
eliminating waste and improving elHciency.
We have had to do this to meet the competi
tion of the many other oil companies serving
your needs.

"She's worked right with me and kept our
books since we leased our first Union Oil sta
tion on this same corner in La Canada, 20
years ago.
"And —as Myrtle says—gasoline hasn't gone
up nearly as much as other things you buy.

You pay 205% more to build a house today
than you did in 1936. 220% more for a low
price 2-door sedan. 125% more for a suit of
clothes. 325% more for a pound of sirloin steak.
"Yet if you leave out the tax, Union's premium
gasoline has gone up only 70% in that same
time. Fact is, the tax has gone up more than
the gasoline—loo%! And two gallons of
Union's new Royal 76 will do the work of three
gallons of our old product.
"You get a lot of service for nothing, too. We
wash your car's windshield. We check water,

oil, battery and tires. We provide clean rest
rooms and free maps for your convenience.
"Fact is, you never got so much for your money
as you do today when you say, 'Fill her up!'"

In 1956 it costs Union Oil 250% more than it
ciici in 1936 to build the kind of service station
Charles and Myrtle Santman operate in La
Canada, California.
Yet in spite of continually rising costs like
this we have been able to keep prices down,
while constantly expanding our service and
improving our product.
We have accomplished this bv plowing prof
its back into better facilities, by research, by
eliminating waste and improving elHciency.
We have had to do this to meet the competi
tion of the many other oil companies serving
your needs.
