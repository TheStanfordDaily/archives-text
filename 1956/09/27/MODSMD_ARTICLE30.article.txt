# Looking It Over

With Jerry Kelly
Should a college football player be a privileged student? Should
he have to compete with other students in class? Should he be re
quired to work during the school year for money above and l>eyond
that paid toward tuition?
These questions brought to the fore the serious dilemma of the
Pacific Coast Conference. The exposure of Washington's secret fund
last February blew the lid off the unhappy family's cookie jar. For
the past six months meeting after meeting between PCC presidents
and conference representatives failed to satisfy all family members.
We are not here to criticize the work of the PCC directors, but
rather to clarify the present situation and to briefly outline what has
been accomplished, where the colleges now stand and what 'is yet
to be done.
It has been an open secret for several years that many of the
larger universities oil tin* coast have seriously violated the PCC
code. What was once a students' game, tin* "do-or-die" for the
school's sake, gradually became big business, professionalism, in
the end directed not by the universities and the student body, but
rather by powerful alumni groups. A college football player was
not necessarily a college student. lie was often times hired to go
to school as an athlete.
Coaches became panicky, did anything to field a winning team.
The case of the University of Washington points this out. When
their last mentor was forced out, things began to happen. Finally,
positive, clear-thinking action began to develop.
The first to get clipped, Washington was placed on probation
until July, 1958, is barred from the Rose Bowl for that period and is
not permitted to participate in the distribution of the Bowl receipts.
They cannot participate in any post-season athletic event, are not
eligible for consideration as a conference champion and are directed
to break all contact between the athletic department and certain
fund-raising alumni groups. All football players lost one year's eli
gibility.
UCLA, the second in line for punishment, was found in an even
sorrier slate. More serious violations commanded stiffer penalties.
The Bruins were placed on conference probation until July, 1959,
received all Washington did and additional fines were assessed.
Southern California, the previously incompatible neighbor of
UCLA but now united in a common bondage, took the rap next.
Placed on a two-year probation, IJSC equaled Washington's mark in
penalties. An additional fine of $10,000 was attached for non-co
operation.
Our friends in Berkeley fared better after it was discovered a
separate coaches' fund was inadvertently working against confer
ence procedures. A one-year probation, a $25,000 fine and an order
to discontinue contacts with a San Francisco club temporarily satis
fied conference officials.
During the summer months additional meetings produced little,
save for a turn-about in declaring senior gridders eligible for five
successive games this season. Stanford's was the only dissenting
vote.
Thus, four large universities look a rap. The personnel of two
universities took the deserved penalties like gentlemen; our insti
tutions to the south, the alumni and the press still shed tears of
anguish. Cries of "We're guilty, but so is everyone else" or "We're
not that guilty" echo from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
What's it all add up to? Has the conference been thoroughly
cleaned? Will this severe action solve the PCC dilemma? Or will
the same violations arise again?
, Only time will answer these questions, but one point can be made.
An effort to clear up discrepancies has been made, the presidents
and other PCC representatives see a need for some changes and
strict enforcement of the code.
Throughout the year Stanford has voted a straight ticket against
all violators with the correct assumption that when a school or the
players are adjudged guilty, they are wholly guilty, not partially.
There is no such thing as partial guilt.
Both UCLA and UKC football teams are geared to a "Get Stan
ford" slogan this season. Los Angeles sports columnists condemn
Stanford officials for voting the way their consciences guided.
Hints that Stanford is equally guilty are not whispered. They're
yelled throughout Southern California.
A 1 Masters, director of athletics here, has repeatedly said Stan
ford is clean and no one has even come close to provlig otherwise.
i he players, the coaches and the universities are equally guilty
in the "Case of the Pacific Coast Conference." A big step in the
right direction has been taken. Let's not stop here but continue with
the principle that college athletics are for the students, the students
are to participate with a real desire for a winning team.
May we head back to amateurism, where a boy plays for the lo#e
of the game. A strict enforcement of a fair PCC code will save the
Pacific Coast Conference.

been accomplished, where the colleges now stand and what 'is yet
to be done.
It has been an open secret for several years that many of the
larger universities oil tin* coast have seriously violated the PCC
code. What was once a students' game, tin* "do-or-die" for the
school's sake, gradually became big business, professionalism, in
the end directed not by the universities and the student body, but
rather by powerful alumni groups. A college football player was
not necessarily a college student. lie was often times hired to go
to school as an athlete.
Coaches became panicky, did anything to field a winning team.
The case of the University of Washington points this out. When
their last mentor was forced out, things began to happen. Finally,
positive, clear-thinking action began to develop.
The first to get clipped, Washington was placed on probation
until July, 1958, is barred from the Rose Bowl for that period and is
not permitted to participate in the distribution of the Bowl receipts.
They cannot participate in any post-season athletic event, are not
eligible for consideration as a conference champion and are directed
to break all contact between the athletic department and certain
fund-raising alumni groups. All football players lost one year's eli
gibility.
UCLA, the second in line for punishment, was found in an even
sorrier slate. More serious violations commanded stiffer penalties.
The Bruins were placed on conference probation until July, 1959,
received all Washington did and additional fines were assessed.
Southern California, the previously incompatible neighbor of
UCLA but now united in a common bondage, took the rap next.
Placed on a two-year probation, IJSC equaled Washington's mark in
penalties. An additional fine of $10,000 was attached for non-co
operation.
Our friends in Berkeley fared better after it was discovered a
separate coaches' fund was inadvertently working against confer
ence procedures. A one-year probation, a $25,000 fine and an order
to discontinue contacts with a San Francisco club temporarily satis
fied conference officials.
During the summer months additional meetings produced little,
save for a turn-about in declaring senior gridders eligible for five
successive games this season. Stanford's was the only dissenting
vote.
Thus, four large universities look a rap. The personnel of two
universities took the deserved penalties like gentlemen; our insti
tutions to the south, the alumni and the press still shed tears of
anguish. Cries of "We're guilty, but so is everyone else" or "We're
not that guilty" echo from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
What's it all add up to? Has the conference been thoroughly
cleaned? Will this severe action solve the PCC dilemma? Or will
the same violations arise again?
, Only time will answer these questions, but one point can be made.
An effort to clear up discrepancies has been made, the presidents
and other PCC representatives see a need for some changes and
strict enforcement of the code.
Throughout the year Stanford has voted a straight ticket against
all violators with the correct assumption that when a school or the
players are adjudged guilty, they are wholly guilty, not partially.
There is no such thing as partial guilt.
Both UCLA and UKC football teams are geared to a "Get Stan
ford" slogan this season. Los Angeles sports columnists condemn
Stanford officials for voting the way their consciences guided.
Hints that Stanford is equally guilty are not whispered. They're
yelled throughout Southern California.
A 1 Masters, director of athletics here, has repeatedly said Stan
ford is clean and no one has even come close to provlig otherwise.
i he players, the coaches and the universities are equally guilty
in the "Case of the Pacific Coast Conference." A big step in the
right direction has been taken. Let's not stop here but continue with
the principle that college athletics are for the students, the students
are to participate with a real desire for a winning team.
May we head back to amateurism, where a boy plays for the lo#e
of the game. A strict enforcement of a fair PCC code will save the
Pacific Coast Conference.
With Jerry Kelly
Should a college football player be a privileged student? Should
he have to compete with other students in class? Should he be re
quired to work during the school year for money above and l>eyond
that paid toward tuition?
These questions brought to the fore the serious dilemma of the
Pacific Coast Conference. The exposure of Washington's secret fund
last February blew the lid off the unhappy family's cookie jar. For
the past six months meeting after meeting between PCC presidents
and conference representatives failed to satisfy all family members.

Coaches became panicky, did anything to field a winning team.
The case of the University of Washington points this out. When
their last mentor was forced out, things began to happen. Finally,
positive, clear-thinking action began to develop.
The first to get clipped, Washington was placed on probation
until July, 1958, is barred from the Rose Bowl for that period and is
not permitted to participate in the distribution of the Bowl receipts.
They cannot participate in any post-season athletic event, are not
eligible for consideration as a conference champion and are directed
to break all contact between the athletic department and certain
fund-raising alumni groups. All football players lost one year's eli
gibility.
UCLA, the second in line for punishment, was found in an even
sorrier slate. More serious violations commanded stiffer penalties.
The Bruins were placed on conference probation until July, 1959,
received all Washington did and additional fines were assessed.
Southern California, the previously incompatible neighbor of
UCLA but now united in a common bondage, took the rap next.
Placed on a two-year probation, IJSC equaled Washington's mark in
penalties. An additional fine of $10,000 was attached for non-co
operation.
Our friends in Berkeley fared better after it was discovered a
separate coaches' fund was inadvertently working against confer
ence procedures. A one-year probation, a $25,000 fine and an order
to discontinue contacts with a San Francisco club temporarily satis
fied conference officials.
During the summer months additional meetings produced little,
save for a turn-about in declaring senior gridders eligible for five
successive games this season. Stanford's was the only dissenting
vote.
Thus, four large universities look a rap. The personnel of two
universities took the deserved penalties like gentlemen; our insti
tutions to the south, the alumni and the press still shed tears of
anguish. Cries of "We're guilty, but so is everyone else" or "We're
not that guilty" echo from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
What's it all add up to? Has the conference been thoroughly
cleaned? Will this severe action solve the PCC dilemma? Or will
the same violations arise again?
, Only time will answer these questions, but one point can be made.
An effort to clear up discrepancies has been made, the presidents
and other PCC representatives see a need for some changes and
strict enforcement of the code.
Throughout the year Stanford has voted a straight ticket against
all violators with the correct assumption that when a school or the
players are adjudged guilty, they are wholly guilty, not partially.
There is no such thing as partial guilt.
Both UCLA and UKC football teams are geared to a "Get Stan
ford" slogan this season. Los Angeles sports columnists condemn
Stanford officials for voting the way their consciences guided.
Hints that Stanford is equally guilty are not whispered. They're
yelled throughout Southern California.
A 1 Masters, director of athletics here, has repeatedly said Stan
ford is clean and no one has even come close to provlig otherwise.
i he players, the coaches and the universities are equally guilty
in the "Case of the Pacific Coast Conference." A big step in the
right direction has been taken. Let's not stop here but continue with
the principle that college athletics are for the students, the students
are to participate with a real desire for a winning team.
May we head back to amateurism, where a boy plays for the lo#e
of the game. A strict enforcement of a fair PCC code will save the
Pacific Coast Conference.
