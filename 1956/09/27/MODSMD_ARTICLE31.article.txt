# Stanford Hopes to Smash Spartans With Famed Pass-Attacking Offense
## 
### Dean Stewart 
Can a spectacular pass-attack-
I ing team beat a hard • running,
ball-controlling team?
Late Saturday afternoon the an
swer will be known. Stanford's
heralded passing attack will re
ceive its stiffest test from the
highly rated Michigan State elev
en. If pre-game expectations are
borne out, it will be a battle be
tween a powerful Spartan back
field, featuring big, fast Clarence
Peaks, and Stanford's John Bro
die, tossing strikes to his glue
fingered receivers.
Saturday's game will be the
opener for Michigan State and the
first home game for Stanford.
Kick-off time is scheduled for 2
p.m. in Memorial Stadium.
A great deal has been written
about Brodie, and justly so. He
has been tabbed by many football
experts as a leading AU-American
quarterback candidate on the
basis of his outstanding season
last year. And if his showing
against Washington State last
Saturday night is any indication,
he's not going to let the pre-sea
son tabulators down. Against the
Cougars Brodie completed 17 out
of 24 attempts for a remarkable
70.8 per' cent.
Stanford Receivers
However, the success of any
passer depends upon his receiv
ers. Stanford is fortunate in hav
ing the finest group of pass-snag
ging ends and backs in the West,
if not in the nation. As so often
happens when one team has so
many players doing the same
thflng so well, no one player is
singled out for praise. Instead, a
few flowery words are written
about the group.
Against the Cougars Stanford
receivers turned in a creditable
showing under the lights. They
pulled in 24 of 36 passes for 259
yards and four touchdowns. End
Gary Van Galder was the leading
Card receiver with five receptions
good for 51 yards.
Van Galder was the starting
right end against the Cougars,
and, despite the fact he was the
leading Stanford receiver. Coach
Chuck Taylor has indicated that
Jerry Beatie will probably get the
starting call against Michigan
State. When a coach can afford
to leave his leading receiver on
the bench against a potent'team
like Michigan State, you know
he's loaded with ends.
Last year Beatie divided the
playing time fairly evenly with
Van Galder. It appears that this
season Beatie and Van Galder will
again give each other a battle for
the right-end position. It's fights
like these that a coach enjoys
watching.
Isaacs at Peak
Carl Isaacs was at peak form
against the Cougars. He caught
two touchdown passes and set up
another when he intercepted a
Cougar pass and returned it 31
yards.
Joel Freis, who sat out last sea

son because of injuries, is the
fastest end on the squad. He had
an outstanding spring practice
and looks even better this fall.
Freis took a short pass from Ja<*k
Douglas to score Stanford's sixth
touchdown in the WSC encounter.
Isaacs will have to remain in top
form to keep this rapidly improv
ing sophomore from taking his
job.
Ben Robinson, up from the '55
freshman team, showed unmistak
able signs of promise in spring
practice. Taylor is giving Robin
son ever y opportunity to gain val
u able playipg experience this
year, and next year he should
team up with returning veterans
Van Galder and Freis to again
give Stanford a fine group of
ends.
Backs as Receivers
In addition to his ends, Brodie
makes extensive use of his backs
as receivers. Left halfback Paul
Camera caught four passes good
for 41 yards in the WSC rout. In
fact he was second highest in re
ceptions for the team.
Right half Gordy Young, al
though primarily noted for his
running ability, is also an adept
receiver. In 1954 Young was sec
ond among the pass receivers
with 201 yards on 15 catches.
Against Washington State he
caught one Brodie pass in Stan
ford's second touchdown drive
and was the only consistent ball
carrier, gaining 69 yards in 10
carries.
As if two ends and three backs
weren't enough for any defensive
backfield to cover, the NCAA
Football Rules Committee decided
to make two more men available
for passes on certain plays. This
change, the only new one to affect
viewers this year, is known as the
tackle-eligible play.

Under the tackle-eligible play, a
tackle is eligible to receive a pass
providing he is one of the end men
on the line of scrimmage. Stan
ford used this new play effective
ly last Saturday against VVSC. In
fact the Cards scored their fourth
touchdown with a Jack Taylor to i
John Kidd pass on the new play, j
Kidd was not the only tackle !
to taste glory. Big Steve Docter
hauled in a 14-yard Brodie pass
near the goal line to take the sting !
out of our first penalty-nullified L
touchdown. Two plays later full- 112
back Lou Valli plunged into the j
Washington State end zone for
Stanford's first six points.
Docter, at 6-3 and 211 pounds,
has the perfect build for end, a
position he played last year.

Stan 112 or d's varsity went
through light workouts yester
day. Both Indian passing and
running plays were polished as
well as practice against simu
lated Michigan State running
plays.
Three players, tackle Chris
Plain, center Russ Steele and
halfback Bill Burget, missed
Wednesday's session because of
slight colds. All three are ex
pected back in action today.

year, and next year he should
team up with returning veterans
Van Galder and Freis to again
give Stanford a fine group of
ends.
Backs as Receivers
In addition to his ends, Brodie
makes extensive use of his backs
as receivers. Left halfback Paul
Camera caught four passes good
for 41 yards in the WSC rout. In
fact he was second highest in re
ceptions for the team.
Right half Gordy Young, al
though primarily noted for his
running ability, is also an adept
receiver. In 1954 Young was sec
ond among the pass receivers
with 201 yards on 15 catches.
Against Washington State he
caught one Brodie pass in Stan
ford's second touchdown drive
and was the only consistent ball
carrier, gaining 69 yards in 10
carries.
As if two ends and three backs
weren't enough for any defensive
backfield to cover, the NCAA
Football Rules Committee decided
to make two more men available
for passes on certain plays. This
change, the only new one to affect
viewers this year, is known as the
tackle-eligible play.

Under the tackle-eligible play, a
tackle is eligible to receive a pass
providing he is one of the end men
on the line of scrimmage. Stan
ford used this new play effective
ly last Saturday against VVSC. In
fact the Cards scored their fourth
touchdown with a Jack Taylor to i
John Kidd pass on the new play, j
Kidd was not the only tackle !
to taste glory. Big Steve Docter
hauled in a 14-yard Brodie pass
near the goal line to take the sting !
out of our first penalty-nullified L
touchdown. Two plays later full- 112
back Lou Valli plunged into the j
Washington State end zone for
Stanford's first six points.
Docter, at 6-3 and 211 pounds,
has the perfect build for end, a
position he played last year.

Stan 112 or d's varsity went
through light workouts yester
day. Both Indian passing and
running plays were polished as
well as practice against simu
lated Michigan State running
plays.
Three players, tackle Chris
Plain, center Russ Steele and
halfback Bill Burget, missed
Wednesday's session because of
slight colds. All three are ex
pected back in action today.
Can a spectacular pass-attack-
I ing team beat a hard • running,
ball-controlling team?
Late Saturday afternoon the an
swer will be known. Stanford's
heralded passing attack will re
ceive its stiffest test from the
highly rated Michigan State elev
en. If pre-game expectations are
borne out, it will be a battle be
tween a powerful Spartan back
field, featuring big, fast Clarence
Peaks, and Stanford's John Bro
die, tossing strikes to his glue
fingered receivers.
Saturday's game will be the
opener for Michigan State and the
first home game for Stanford.
Kick-off time is scheduled for 2
p.m. in Memorial Stadium.
A great deal has been written
about Brodie, and justly so. He
has been tabbed by many football
experts as a leading AU-American
quarterback candidate on the
basis of his outstanding season
last year. And if his showing
against Washington State last
Saturday night is any indication,
he's not going to let the pre-sea
son tabulators down. Against the
Cougars Brodie completed 17 out
of 24 attempts for a remarkable
70.8 per' cent.
Stanford Receivers
However, the success of any
passer depends upon his receiv
ers. Stanford is fortunate in hav
ing the finest group of pass-snag
ging ends and backs in the West,
if not in the nation. As so often
happens when one team has so
many players doing the same
thflng so well, no one player is
singled out for praise. Instead, a
few flowery words are written
about the group.
Against the Cougars Stanford
receivers turned in a creditable
showing under the lights. They
pulled in 24 of 36 passes for 259
yards and four touchdowns. End
Gary Van Galder was the leading
Card receiver with five receptions
good for 51 yards.
Van Galder was the starting
right end against the Cougars,
and, despite the fact he was the
leading Stanford receiver. Coach
Chuck Taylor has indicated that
Jerry Beatie will probably get the
starting call against Michigan
State. When a coach can afford
to leave his leading receiver on
the bench against a potent'team
like Michigan State, you know
he's loaded with ends.
Last year Beatie divided the
playing time fairly evenly with
Van Galder. It appears that this
season Beatie and Van Galder will
again give each other a battle for
the right-end position. It's fights
like these that a coach enjoys
watching.
Isaacs at Peak
Carl Isaacs was at peak form
against the Cougars. He caught
two touchdown passes and set up
another when he intercepted a
Cougar pass and returned it 31
yards.
Joel Freis, who sat out last sea

son because of injuries, is the
fastest end on the squad. He had
an outstanding spring practice
and looks even better this fall.
Freis took a short pass from Ja<*k
Douglas to score Stanford's sixth
touchdown in the WSC encounter.
Isaacs will have to remain in top
form to keep this rapidly improv
ing sophomore from taking his
job.
Ben Robinson, up from the '55
freshman team, showed unmistak
able signs of promise in spring
practice. Taylor is giving Robin
son ever y opportunity to gain val
u able playipg experience this
year, and next year he should
team up with returning veterans
Van Galder and Freis to again
give Stanford a fine group of
ends.

he's not going to let the pre-sea
son tabulators down. Against the
Cougars Brodie completed 17 out
of 24 attempts for a remarkable
70.8 per' cent.
Stanford Receivers
However, the success of any
passer depends upon his receiv
ers. Stanford is fortunate in hav
ing the finest group of pass-snag
ging ends and backs in the West,
if not in the nation. As so often
happens when one team has so
many players doing the same
thflng so well, no one player is
singled out for praise. Instead, a
few flowery words are written
about the group.
Against the Cougars Stanford
receivers turned in a creditable
showing under the lights. They
pulled in 24 of 36 passes for 259
yards and four touchdowns. End
Gary Van Galder was the leading
Card receiver with five receptions
good for 51 yards.
Van Galder was the starting
right end against the Cougars,
and, despite the fact he was the
leading Stanford receiver. Coach
Chuck Taylor has indicated that
Jerry Beatie will probably get the
starting call against Michigan
State. When a coach can afford
to leave his leading receiver on
the bench against a potent'team
like Michigan State, you know
he's loaded with ends.
Last year Beatie divided the
playing time fairly evenly with
Van Galder. It appears that this
season Beatie and Van Galder will
again give each other a battle for
the right-end position. It's fights
like these that a coach enjoys
watching.
Isaacs at Peak
Carl Isaacs was at peak form
against the Cougars. He caught
two touchdown passes and set up
another when he intercepted a
Cougar pass and returned it 31
yards.
Joel Freis, who sat out last sea

son because of injuries, is the
fastest end on the squad. He had
an outstanding spring practice
and looks even better this fall.
Freis took a short pass from Ja<*k
Douglas to score Stanford's sixth
touchdown in the WSC encounter.
Isaacs will have to remain in top
form to keep this rapidly improv
ing sophomore from taking his
job.
Ben Robinson, up from the '55
freshman team, showed unmistak
able signs of promise in spring
practice. Taylor is giving Robin
son ever y opportunity to gain val
u able playipg experience this
year, and next year he should
team up with returning veterans
Van Galder and Freis to again
give Stanford a fine group of
ends.
Backs as Receivers
In addition to his ends, Brodie
makes extensive use of his backs
as receivers. Left halfback Paul
Camera caught four passes good
for 41 yards in the WSC rout. In
fact he was second highest in re
ceptions for the team.
Right half Gordy Young, al
though primarily noted for his
running ability, is also an adept
receiver. In 1954 Young was sec
ond among the pass receivers
with 201 yards on 15 catches.
Against Washington State he
caught one Brodie pass in Stan
ford's second touchdown drive
and was the only consistent ball
carrier, gaining 69 yards in 10
carries.
As if two ends and three backs
weren't enough for any defensive
backfield to cover, the NCAA
Football Rules Committee decided
to make two more men available
for passes on certain plays. This
change, the only new one to affect
viewers this year, is known as the
tackle-eligible play.

Under the tackle-eligible play, a
tackle is eligible to receive a pass
providing he is one of the end men
on the line of scrimmage. Stan
ford used this new play effective
ly last Saturday against VVSC. In
fact the Cards scored their fourth
touchdown with a Jack Taylor to i
John Kidd pass on the new play, j
Kidd was not the only tackle !
to taste glory. Big Steve Docter
hauled in a 14-yard Brodie pass
near the goal line to take the sting !
out of our first penalty-nullified L
touchdown. Two plays later full- 112
back Lou Valli plunged into the j
Washington State end zone for
Stanford's first six points.
Docter, at 6-3 and 211 pounds,
has the perfect build for end, a
position he played last year.

Stan 112 or d's varsity went
through light workouts yester
day. Both Indian passing and
running plays were polished as
well as practice against simu
lated Michigan State running
plays.
Three players, tackle Chris
Plain, center Russ Steele and
halfback Bill Burget, missed
Wednesday's session because of
slight colds. All three are ex
pected back in action today.
Can a spectacular pass-attack-
I ing team beat a hard • running,
ball-controlling team?
Late Saturday afternoon the an
swer will be known. Stanford's
heralded passing attack will re
ceive its stiffest test from the
highly rated Michigan State elev
en. If pre-game expectations are
borne out, it will be a battle be
tween a powerful Spartan back
field, featuring big, fast Clarence
Peaks, and Stanford's John Bro
die, tossing strikes to his glue
fingered receivers.
Saturday's game will be the
opener for Michigan State and the
first home game for Stanford.
Kick-off time is scheduled for 2
p.m. in Memorial Stadium.
A great deal has been written
about Brodie, and justly so. He
has been tabbed by many football
experts as a leading AU-American
quarterback candidate on the
basis of his outstanding season
last year. And if his showing
against Washington State last
Saturday night is any indication,
he's not going to let the pre-sea
son tabulators down. Against the
Cougars Brodie completed 17 out
of 24 attempts for a remarkable
