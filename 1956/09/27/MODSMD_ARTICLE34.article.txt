# Roberts Five-Hits Dodgers; Champs Now Game Behind
## Phillie Ace Picks Up 19th Victory; Orioles' Beamon Stops Yanks, 1-0 
### 
Robin Roberts, striving for his I
seventh straight 20-vvin season, ;
pitched the Philadelphia Phillies;
to a 7-3 victory over the Brooklyn
.Dodgers last night in a game that
may have ruined the world eham- j
pions' pennant hopes.
The loss dropped the Bums a j
full game back of the idle Mil-1
waukee Braves in the hectic Na
tional League race with only three
games remaining for each club.
Roberts deprived the Dodgers
of a pennant six years ago when I
he beat them on the final day of
the 1950 season, and he may have J
done it again yesterday with a j
gritty five-hit performance that !
earned him his 19th victory.
The powerful right-hander
yielded two home runs to Duke
Snider in addition to an unearned !

run in the second inning, but he
struck out 10 batters and gave up
only one hit over the last six
frames. Snider increased his NL
homer lead to 41.
In the American League, Balti
more rookie Charlie Beamon, up
from Vancouver of the Pacific
Coast League, thwarted Whitey
Ford's try for win No. 20 with a
1-0, four-hit victory over the cham
pion Yankees.
