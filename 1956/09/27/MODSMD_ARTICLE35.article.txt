## 
### Steve Baffrey 
An expected 65,000 spectators
will tile through the gates of Me
morial Stadium on Saturday to
witness the Indian • MSU tussle.
Many of these rooters wilj lie the
first to occupy new seats installed
during the summer. All of them
will be sitting 4n a sports world
landmark.
Stanford Stadium, housing GO,-
000 at the time, was completed
and dedicated in 1921, but since
that time has undergone many
facelifting periods. Its present
capacity. 90,000 faun, makes it the
second largest privately owned
field in the U.S. Only the Uni
versity of Michigan, seating 97,000
after new additions, is larger.
First a Horseshoe
In 1921 the field appeared as a
"perfect horseshoe." Eventually,
as growth became a necessity, the
open end of the stadium was
closed and an additional rim was
added to the bowl. With contin
ual growth the upkeep has risen
to an annual $10,000 figure.
The stadium has housed a va
riety of events in its history. On
the athletic side, apart from Stan
ford home games, various track
and field meets, including the
NCAA finals and the Olympic try
outs, have been held in the bowl.
At one time the field became a
sound stage for a motion picture
featuring the immortal Jim'
'Thorpe. Stranger yet is the fact
that grand opera has not by- |
passed what has been called the
"world's greatest turf." Even ex- j
President Hoover used the field
to make his presidential accept
ance speech, in 1928.
Electric Scoreboard
The installation of a $10,000
IBM electric scoreboard in 1954
was part of a major renewal oper
ation still not complete. After a
number of seats were taken out
of the stadium, a strike forced
cancellation of the order for new
ones. The University of Califor
nia eventually supplied lumber.
