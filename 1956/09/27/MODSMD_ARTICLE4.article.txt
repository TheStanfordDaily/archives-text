# Dulles Predicts That Nasser Will Give Way
## Says Egypt Surrender Probable Because of Economic Pressure 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2H (UP)
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today that economic
pressures eventually will force
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel
Nasser to agree to a Suez settle
ment acceptable to the West.
He told a news conference that
there is a good chance Egypt will
freely recognize the importance
of "working with, not working
against" nations that want to use
the canal. He said he simply does
not believe Egypt can "got away
with" lone-wolf operation of the
canal.
But even if Nasser persists in
his present course, Dulles said, it
will not be necessary to use force.
He declared that "when a na
tion's conduct frightens others
then there are inevitable conse
quences." He said these conse
quences already are being felt:
• The "intensively" anti-West
ern tone of Egyptian officials and
the Egyptian press has killed the
tourist trade to Egypt. This, he
said, is costing Egypt foreign ex
change needed to pay for the im
ports the Egyptian people want.
• Some commercial activities
in Egypt are "drying up" because
they depend on foreign markets
and credit. Dulles said these are
not readily available to Egypt or
any nation which rejects the im
plications of interdependence.
• Western financial interests
had been thinking of enlarging
and deepening the canal. But
"now their thoughts are of big
tankers and additional pipelines
which will make it possible for
nations to be less dependent on
the Suez Canal."
