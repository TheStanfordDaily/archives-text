# Temporary Buildings Will Not Receive Repainting
## Pink Patches to Remain; University Planned to Paint Only One Building 
### 
The University is not planning to finish painting the temporary
buildings behind Cubberley Auditorium, according to building su
perintendent Carroll Blacker.
One of the three buildings, which house the Western Civilization,
library and faculty offices, was painted off-white last spring during

finals week. The others are still
olive green patched with pink.
The job of painling Ihe one
building was originally planned
as a project by Phi Phi, an inter
fraternity service organization.
The University bought the
paint, brushes and other equip
ment needed for the job and mixed
the paint. Phi Phi members brush
ed down the building, according
to Phi Phi president Ken Billings.
Bad Weather
Then it rained on three succes
sive Saturdays. Two weeks of
school were left when (he weather
cleared up, and, with finals near,
Billings asked Dean William
Craig if Phi Phi could drop the
project.
Because the painf was already
mixed and would spoil if not used,
the Corporation Yard painted the
one building, Blacker said.
The buildings, formerly Army
hospital wards, have been in tem
porary use for 10 years. Billings
explained that Phi Phi had only
offered to paint the one building
and only enough paint was bought
for that job.
Job Finished
At no time had either the serv
ice group or the University plan
ned to do anything fro Annexes A
or B, so the proposed project has
been finished.
The pink patching was applied
to the buildings three years ago,
said Blacker, and until last year
no one had objected to the build
ings' exterior iook.


TEMPORARY BUILDINGS — They may never
be painted again. Although they have been in
use here for 10 years, they are still regarded by

University officials as "temporary." Last year's
plan to paint them fizzled because of rain.
