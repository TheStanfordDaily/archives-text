Students who didn't find an
identification-card picture in their
autumn quarter registration bonk
will receive their ID's 'on winter
quarter registration day, accord
ing to Assistant Registrar Hans
Wagner.
Wagner also explained how the
registration books for old return
ing students were cut down to 10
pages.
"We did it by consolidating
some pages and changing the se

For example, the Registrar's of
