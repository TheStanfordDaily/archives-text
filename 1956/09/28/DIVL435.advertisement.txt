PRESIDENT'S NOTE
Stanford Faculty, students and employees, it is a pleasure to welcome you to U. C. E.'s department store. Our board of directors have cleared
the way for your University to become a part of a great team of Union and Government workers; all of whom are able to make purchases at
tremendous savings due to their combined volume purchasing power.
U. G. E. is an enormous department store stocking more than 7 5,000 items and occupying more than 25,000 sq. ft. Not only are all
of these items available to U. G. E. members, but many other services from developing film to repainting your car, all at prices far, far lower
than you could possibly find elsewhere. U. G. E. is your organization, designed and equipped to serve all of your shopping needs. Remember,
as the membership grows, volume increases and prices decrease.

PRESIDENT'S NOTE
Stanford Faculty, students and employees, it is a pleasure to welcome you to U. C. E.'s department store. Our board of directors have cleared
the way for your University to become a part of a great team of Union and Government workers; all of whom are able to make purchases at
tremendous savings due to their combined volume purchasing power.
U. G. E. is an enormous department store stocking more than 7 5,000 items and occupying more than 25,000 sq. ft. Not only are all
of these items available to U. G. E. members, but many other services from developing film to repainting your car, all at prices far, far lower
than you could possibly find elsewhere. U. G. E. is your organization, designed and equipped to serve all of your shopping needs. Remember,
as the membership grows, volume increases and prices decrease.
