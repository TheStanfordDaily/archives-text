# Suez Situation Will Not Lead To War, Expert on Egypt Declares
## 
### Sally Trapnell 
There will be no war over the Suez Canal situation as such, pre
dicts Professor Christina Harris, curator of the Middle East Collec
tions at the Hoover Institute.
Mrs. Harris, who was with the State Department for three years
and has lived in Egypt and Lebanon for four, believes thai Russia
will certainly veto any move to take action against Nasser in the
Security Council.
She doesn't think that any of the other nations involved Britain,
France or the United States is anxious to have war as a result of
the seizure.
Mrs. Harris believes the only chance for a military struggle in
the Middle East would come if Israel decides this is a good excuse
1o wage a "preventive war" on the Arabs. If this happened, the
Western countries might be drawn in on the Israeli side.
If the West did land troops in"Egypt, Nasser would fight rather
than back down, Mrs. Harris says. The other Arab nations would
support him, and he would face an Egyptian civil war if he failed
to put up a strong front.
Mrs. Harris emphatically denied that Nasser has any ambition

to play I lit lor among the nations of the Middle East and Africa.
She believes that his seizure of the eanal was made to save fare
in his own country when the United States insultingly refused to
lend Egypt money for the Aswan Dam.
"He misjudged how seriously the West would take this action,"
Mrs. Harris surmised. Since the transfer was scheduled in 12 years
anyway, and he offered the Suez share-holders full compensation, he
may have thought there would be only manageable objections raised.
Mrs. Harris denies that Nasser has broken faith with the West
in any way. In the first place, he did not sign the convention of 1888
which he was enforcing. It was originally signed by the Ottoman
Turks for the dynasty of King Farouk, which Nasser overthrew.
He has certainly upheld hjs commitments of free passage as con
tained in that document except in the case of Israel, with which
Egypt is still officially at war.
"Xasser is essentially an honest man," Mrs. Harris believes. "He
has no Communist sympathies, although he may be naive in be
lieving lie can deal with the Russians purely on a government level."
Mrs. Harris says that Nasser may have become rather high
handed after his spectacular success at Bandung. But if the West 1

should put him in a situation where he would lose face at home, there
would probably be civil war, and Nasser's successor would almost
certainly be even less friendly to the West.
"I believe that Nasser is a true Egyptian patriot," Mrs. Harris
said. "He definitely has visions of giving other African nations
moral support in their struggles for independence, but there are
certain limus beyond which he will not go."
It is Nasser's support of the Algerians which has made France
so embittered with him. They are pushing Britain further than she
might otherwise go, Mrs. Harris explains, since Prime Minister Eden
was friendly to the Arab nations until this incident.
Political pressures at home and the Cyprus issue are also re
sponsible for Eden's change in attitude.
Mrs. Harris thinks that the United States' attitude on Suez has
been very ill-judged. The West insists that all it wants is that the
canal be kept as a free and open waterway, but they have immedi
ately begun to think of ways to force Nasser to close it.
Free Passage in Suez
If free passage is our government's only goal, they were very i 11-
I advised to support the removal of Suez pilots and officials, which

! will make operation of the canal difficult even if Nasser has the best
| intentions in the world.
An interesting sidelight on the U.S. attitude is that if the plan
to route ships around Africa is ever put into effect, we will be spend
ing more money on it than we would ever have put into the Aswan
t Dam.
1 his whole incident has greatly decreased Egypt's trust in the
West, Mrs. Harris thinks. If the West is so unwilling to give up its
i laims to the canal now, wonders if thev would be any more
willing in 1968. The arguments Britain and France use now will
still apply then.
Mrs. Harris believes that the debates will drag on for a while
in U.N. committees and that no military action will be taken. She
thinks that the seizure is a fait accompli, and that Nasser will even
tually be left in competent control with no one much the worse for
his abrupt move.
The Western nations have never questioned Egypt's right to
nationalize the canal; it is only his timing that has been violently
objected to. If he continues to keep the canal open and operating
efficently, there will be no reason for European ships to be forced
to detour around Africa or get their oil from the United States

Security Council.
She doesn't think that any of the other nations involved Britain,
France or the United States is anxious to have war as a result of
the seizure.
Mrs. Harris believes the only chance for a military struggle in
the Middle East would come if Israel decides this is a good excuse
1o wage a "preventive war" on the Arabs. If this happened, the
Western countries might be drawn in on the Israeli side.
If the West did land troops in"Egypt, Nasser would fight rather
than back down, Mrs. Harris says. The other Arab nations would
support him, and he would face an Egyptian civil war if he failed
to put up a strong front.
Mrs. Harris emphatically denied that Nasser has any ambition

to play I lit lor among the nations of the Middle East and Africa.
She believes that his seizure of the eanal was made to save fare
in his own country when the United States insultingly refused to
lend Egypt money for the Aswan Dam.
"He misjudged how seriously the West would take this action,"
Mrs. Harris surmised. Since the transfer was scheduled in 12 years
anyway, and he offered the Suez share-holders full compensation, he
may have thought there would be only manageable objections raised.
Mrs. Harris denies that Nasser has broken faith with the West
in any way. In the first place, he did not sign the convention of 1888
which he was enforcing. It was originally signed by the Ottoman
Turks for the dynasty of King Farouk, which Nasser overthrew.
He has certainly upheld hjs commitments of free passage as con
tained in that document except in the case of Israel, with which
Egypt is still officially at war.
"Xasser is essentially an honest man," Mrs. Harris believes. "He
has no Communist sympathies, although he may be naive in be
lieving lie can deal with the Russians purely on a government level."
Mrs. Harris says that Nasser may have become rather high
handed after his spectacular success at Bandung. But if the West 1

should put him in a situation where he would lose face at home, there
would probably be civil war, and Nasser's successor would almost
certainly be even less friendly to the West.
"I believe that Nasser is a true Egyptian patriot," Mrs. Harris
said. "He definitely has visions of giving other African nations
moral support in their struggles for independence, but there are
certain limus beyond which he will not go."
It is Nasser's support of the Algerians which has made France
so embittered with him. They are pushing Britain further than she
might otherwise go, Mrs. Harris explains, since Prime Minister Eden
was friendly to the Arab nations until this incident.
Political pressures at home and the Cyprus issue are also re
sponsible for Eden's change in attitude.
Mrs. Harris thinks that the United States' attitude on Suez has
been very ill-judged. The West insists that all it wants is that the
canal be kept as a free and open waterway, but they have immedi
ately begun to think of ways to force Nasser to close it.
Free Passage in Suez
If free passage is our government's only goal, they were very i 11-
I advised to support the removal of Suez pilots and officials, which

! will make operation of the canal difficult even if Nasser has the best
| intentions in the world.
An interesting sidelight on the U.S. attitude is that if the plan
to route ships around Africa is ever put into effect, we will be spend
ing more money on it than we would ever have put into the Aswan
t Dam.
1 his whole incident has greatly decreased Egypt's trust in the
West, Mrs. Harris thinks. If the West is so unwilling to give up its
i laims to the canal now, wonders if thev would be any more
willing in 1968. The arguments Britain and France use now will
still apply then.
Mrs. Harris believes that the debates will drag on for a while
in U.N. committees and that no military action will be taken. She
thinks that the seizure is a fait accompli, and that Nasser will even
tually be left in competent control with no one much the worse for
his abrupt move.
The Western nations have never questioned Egypt's right to
nationalize the canal; it is only his timing that has been violently
objected to. If he continues to keep the canal open and operating
efficently, there will be no reason for European ships to be forced
to detour around Africa or get their oil from the United States
There will be no war over the Suez Canal situation as such, pre
dicts Professor Christina Harris, curator of the Middle East Collec

1o wage a "preventive war" on the Arabs. If this happened, the
Western countries might be drawn in on the Israeli side.
If the West did land troops in"Egypt, Nasser would fight rather
than back down, Mrs. Harris says. The other Arab nations would
support him, and he would face an Egyptian civil war if he failed
to put up a strong front.
Mrs. Harris emphatically denied that Nasser has any ambition

to play I lit lor among the nations of the Middle East and Africa.
She believes that his seizure of the eanal was made to save fare
in his own country when the United States insultingly refused to
lend Egypt money for the Aswan Dam.
"He misjudged how seriously the West would take this action,"
Mrs. Harris surmised. Since the transfer was scheduled in 12 years
anyway, and he offered the Suez share-holders full compensation, he
may have thought there would be only manageable objections raised.
Mrs. Harris denies that Nasser has broken faith with the West
in any way. In the first place, he did not sign the convention of 1888
which he was enforcing. It was originally signed by the Ottoman
Turks for the dynasty of King Farouk, which Nasser overthrew.
He has certainly upheld hjs commitments of free passage as con
tained in that document except in the case of Israel, with which
Egypt is still officially at war.
"Xasser is essentially an honest man," Mrs. Harris believes. "He
has no Communist sympathies, although he may be naive in be
lieving lie can deal with the Russians purely on a government level."
Mrs. Harris says that Nasser may have become rather high
handed after his spectacular success at Bandung. But if the West 1

should put him in a situation where he would lose face at home, there
would probably be civil war, and Nasser's successor would almost
certainly be even less friendly to the West.
"I believe that Nasser is a true Egyptian patriot," Mrs. Harris
said. "He definitely has visions of giving other African nations
moral support in their struggles for independence, but there are
certain limus beyond which he will not go."
It is Nasser's support of the Algerians which has made France
so embittered with him. They are pushing Britain further than she
might otherwise go, Mrs. Harris explains, since Prime Minister Eden
was friendly to the Arab nations until this incident.
Political pressures at home and the Cyprus issue are also re
sponsible for Eden's change in attitude.
Mrs. Harris thinks that the United States' attitude on Suez has
been very ill-judged. The West insists that all it wants is that the
canal be kept as a free and open waterway, but they have immedi
ately begun to think of ways to force Nasser to close it.
Free Passage in Suez
If free passage is our government's only goal, they were very i 11-
I advised to support the removal of Suez pilots and officials, which

! will make operation of the canal difficult even if Nasser has the best
| intentions in the world.
An interesting sidelight on the U.S. attitude is that if the plan
to route ships around Africa is ever put into effect, we will be spend
ing more money on it than we would ever have put into the Aswan
t Dam.
1 his whole incident has greatly decreased Egypt's trust in the
West, Mrs. Harris thinks. If the West is so unwilling to give up its
i laims to the canal now, wonders if thev would be any more
willing in 1968. The arguments Britain and France use now will
still apply then.
Mrs. Harris believes that the debates will drag on for a while
in U.N. committees and that no military action will be taken. She
thinks that the seizure is a fait accompli, and that Nasser will even
tually be left in competent control with no one much the worse for
his abrupt move.
The Western nations have never questioned Egypt's right to
nationalize the canal; it is only his timing that has been violently
objected to. If he continues to keep the canal open and operating
efficently, there will be no reason for European ships to be forced
to detour around Africa or get their oil from the United States
