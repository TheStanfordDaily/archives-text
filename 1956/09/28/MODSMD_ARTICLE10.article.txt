## Tennessee Town Rocked as Anti-Negro incidents Continue 
### 
CLINTON, Tenn.. Sept. 27
(UPI Officers today called an
explosion that: rocked this town's
Negro community an effort to in
timidate parents who send their
children to integrated Clinton
High School.
Sheriff Glad Woodward ex
pressed fears that the blast,
which caused little damage, was
part of a "continuing series" of
anti-Negro incidents that reached
a climax in tumultuous rioting
less than a month ago.
The explosions, believed set off
by dynamite packed in two beer
cans, tore a six - inch hole last
night in the ground of a vacant
lot and shattered a window in
one nearby house.
Pro-Segregation
Woodward said he believed the
explosion was intended to "throw
a fright" into Negroes. Officers
have reported stepped-up meet
ings of pro-segregation groups in
the county.
"It looks like a case of intimi
dation," Chief Deputy Sheriff
Robert Arnett said. The explo
sion "could just as easily have
been thrown into somebody's
front yard."
The father of one of the Negro
pupils enrolled at the school was
arrested shortly after the blast
and charged with carrying a
weapon. He was identified as
Herbert Allen, about 40, the fa
ther of Jo Ann Allen, a junior.
Explosion
A window was shattered in the
house of Sterling Weaver, a rail
road employee. The explosion
showered dirt and debris on the
homes of Ronald Hayden and the
Rev. O. W. Willis. Ilayden's son
Ronnie is a student at Clinton
High School.
Officers said the blast blew a
fence post 40 feet and rattled
windows throughout this city of
4,000 population. Allen was go
ing to the site of the explosion to
investigate when officers picked
him up.
Arnett said Allen apparently
had "some idea of being ready to
defend his home." He was
charged with carrying a .38 pis
tol and released under $250 bond,
Arnett said.
Twelve Negro children who
were admitted to the school Aug.
27 under a federal court integra
tion order showed up for classes
today.
Their attendance sparked un
ruly demonstrations and mob ac
tivity that had to he quelled by
Tennessee National Guardsmen
sent in by Governor Frank Cle
ment fluting the Labor Day week
end.
