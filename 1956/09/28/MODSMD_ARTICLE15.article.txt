# Michigan State Plans Runs Against Aerials
## Stanford Is 'Question' Team in Meet Untested Michigan Will Give Indians First Real Battle 
### Jerry Kelly Sports Editor 
teams in the nation have
entered Stanford's Memorial Sta
dium to meet the Indians before,
but never has such a highly rated,
yet untested, squad come before
such a "question mark" team as
the spirited '56 Cardinals.
Michigan State coach Hugh
"Duffy" Daugherty knows it;
sports writers across the country
know if, and the 65,000 footbail
fans here tomorrow to witness
the MSU-Stanford tussle know it.
Not. only is tomorrow's 2 p.m.
fracas billed as a battle between
an outstanding passing team and
an excellent running squad, but
it could well be listed as a crucial
match between two highly rated,
yet untested, elevens.
For the Spartans of Michigan
State, this is their first encounter
of the season. For Stanford, the
powerhouse of the Midwest offers
their first real test. The 40-26
Pacific Coast Conference win
over Washington State last Sat
urday proved only that the arm
of Indian quarterback John Bro
die is a valuable one, indeed.
MSU Rated Second
Rating second in the nation
without playing a single game is
a sure indication that the Michi
gan State coaches are fielding a
team as good, if not better, than
the Rose Bowl champs of 1953.
Last season MSU rolled over all
Big Ten opponents except their
rivals from Ann Arbor, the Uni
versity of Michigan.
Poll ratings don't faze Indian
mentor Chuck Taylor. But why
should such a high rating make
any difference? Stanford, too,
was up on the top-10 ladder—sixth
by I.N.S. standards.
What happens Saturday is yet
to be seen. When two conference
title favorites meet, sectirfnal
honor is at stake. Recent Rose
Bowl results have favored Big
Ten football as the nation's most
outstanding. Pre-season intersec
tionals in post-war years have
slightly favored the PCC. Now
a real test is in the offing.
The Stanford Cardinals go into
tomorrow's tilt tabbed as the aeri

Jack Douglas and Jack Taylor,

may well be that the Indians will

On the receiving end of Brodie

To the Airways?
Just as Stanford may well
spend a good deal of its time on
the ground, Michigan State could
take to the airways. Pat Wilson,
stepping into the shoes vacated
by All-American Earl Morrall, is
geared for passing in Daugherty's
multiple offense.
In such a tricky offense, passes
are not the sole responsibility of
the quarterback. The Spartans'
outstanding halfback, Clarence
"Hi" Peaks, a T-formation quar
terback in his freshman year, can
also fling the long ones.
Of course, Michigan Slate Is

Michigan State rout over Stan

Troublesome Two
Big question mark on the Mich
igan State starting lineup is
whether or not the other man in
the Spartan "Troublesome Two,"
big Walt Kowalczyk, will start.
Latest lineup reports place a ca
pable reserve, Jim Wulff, in Ko

voted Outstanding Player in the
195(5 Rose* Bowl, suffered a leg!

completed only light workouts'
this week.
Dauglierty Has Backs
Whether or not the talented Ko-'
walczyk (pronounced ka-WALL

game, Coach Daugherty has a
host of recognized backs. The
coaching staff's biggest problem
this week was to decide on a 38-

Stanford's fortunes tomorrow,

such a "question mark" team as
the spirited '56 Cardinals.
Michigan State coach Hugh

it could well be listed as a crucial
match between two highly rated,

For the Spartans of Michigan
State, this is their first encounter
of the season. For Stanford, the
powerhouse of the Midwest offers
their first real test. The 40-26
Pacific Coast Conference win
over Washington State last Sat
urday proved only that the arm
of Indian quarterback John Bro

MSU Rated Second
Rating second in the nation
without playing a single game is
a sure indication that the Michi

team as good, if not better, than
the Rose Bowl champs of 1953.
Last season MSU rolled over all
Big Ten opponents except their
rivals from Ann Arbor, the Uni
versity of Michigan.
Poll ratings don't faze Indian
mentor Chuck Taylor. But why
should such a high rating make
any difference? Stanford, too,
was up on the top-10 ladder—sixth
by I.N.S. standards.
What happens Saturday is yet
to be seen. When two conference
title favorites meet, sectirfnal

Bowl results have favored Big
Ten football as the nation's most
outstanding. Pre-season intersec

slightly favored the PCC. Now

To the Airways?
Just as Stanford may well
spend a good deal of its time on
the ground, Michigan State could
take to the airways. Pat Wilson,
stepping into the shoes vacated
by All-American Earl Morrall, is
geared for passing in Daugherty's
multiple offense.
In such a tricky offense, passes
are not the sole responsibility of
the quarterback. The Spartans'
outstanding halfback, Clarence
"Hi" Peaks, a T-formation quar
terback in his freshman year, can
also fling the long ones.
Of course, Michigan Slate Is
noted for ils pounding, then light
ening, then pounding ground at

the big reasons for this. An out

Troublesome Two
Big question mark on the Mich
igan State starting lineup is
whether or not the other man in
the Spartan "Troublesome Two,"
big Walt Kowalczyk, will start.
Latest lineup reports place a ca
pable reserve, Jim Wulff, in Ko
walczyk's slot. The star halfback,

voted Outstanding Player in the
195(5 Rose* Bowl, suffered a leg!
injury, two weeks ago and has
completed only light workouts'
this week.
Dauglierty Has Backs
Whether or not the talented Ko-'
walczyk (pronounced ka-WALL
chick) appears in most of the
game, Coach Daugherty has a
host of recognized backs. The
coaching staff's biggest problem
this week was to decide on a 38-
man traveling squad out of a 90-
man varsity.
Coach Taylor, optimistic about
Stanford's fortunes tomorrow,
has worked his varsity on an in-!

tensive defensive setup to stop
the many running plays Michi
gan State uses off both the T
formation and the single wing.
