# The 						Matusow Case
## 
### 
With the fantastic crif.s of the mid-twen
tieth century witch hunters passing at least
temporarily into much deserved oblivion, we
note with relief the perjury conviction of anti-
Communist informer Harvey Matusow.
Matusow, a former Communist, served as a
star government witness in the 19f>2 trial of
13 second-string Communist leaders and gave
testimony leading to several convictions. He
later recanted his sworn testimony, admitting
that he lied in many of his statements t,p the
court. Wednesday he was convicted on five
counts of perjury and given a maximum sen
tence of 25 years' imprisonment.
In dealing with an issue where emotion and
irrational assumption can cause punishment of
the innocent as well as the guilty, and com
pletely distort the American principle of jus
tice, the government must assume particular

responsibility in carefully checking the type
of persons who present its case.
This point was vividly made in the Matu
sow case.
Paid witnesses who make a profession out
of informing on past associates and presenting
vague hearsay in the form of positive evidence
' are a constant detriment to the administration
of justice and the reputation of innocent
persons.
The Ma tusow case has been concluded in
an atmosphere of relative calm and rationality,
and for this we may he thankful.
Hut it shall remain as a very real and present
reminder of what can happen when the gov
ernment is lax on checking the character and
dependence of its witnesses, when emotions
come to cloud the truth, and the integrity of
the individual becomes subject to slander and
innuendo.
