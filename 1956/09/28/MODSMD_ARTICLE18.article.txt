# INSIDE THE NEWS—By Frank Huntress
## No More Paint for Temporary Buildings 
### 
Why doesn't the University finish painting
the temporary buildings behind Cubbcrley?
The fact is that the University never intend
ed to start painting them, according to As
sistant to the President Kenneth Cuthbertson.
Cuthbertson said the University is planning
to eliminate these quasi-temporary structures
within the next two years "for sure."
Plans for remodeling the center wings of
Encina for administrative offices are now in
the process of being completed, Cuthbertson
added.
This will then enable some of the adminis
trative offices to be vacated in the Inner Quad
area, making room for the occupants of the
temporary buildings. Exact plans of which
offices will move where have not been made.
Four floors of the old men's dorm will be
gutted and revamped for offices in the center
wing. The east and west wings will be made
into dormitory space later on. The "Bull Pen"
of the center wing will not be affected in the
remodeling.
The job of painting the 10-year-old tempo
rary hnildings was purely a student suggestion,

the assistant to President Wallace Sterling said.
I lie I'lli Phi's, an interfraternity service or
ganization, approached Dean of Men William
Craig last spring suggesting that they could
paint the hnildings if the University furnished
the supplies.
The de an consented and the paint and the
brushes were bought. Then rains came for
three successive Saturdays and the quarter was
nearing an «yid. With finals staring the Phi
Phi" s in the eye, lliey asked if they might post
pone their work until this university year.
Instead 111«» Corporation Yard was instructed
to paint the structures since the paint was
mixed and would spoil if not used.
So they painted until the paint ran out.
Since no oilier organization has "volun
teered to paint them, and since the University
is going to dump them soon, the administration
will leave the buildings as they are now.
One of the three former hospital wards—the
one which houses the Western Civilization Li
brary was painted an off-white. The others
are olive drab patched with pink, as in the
past.
