# POLITICAL ROUNDUP
## Presidential Hopefuls Move Into High Gear 
### United Press 
Both presidential candidates
are jumping headlong into their
campaigns as the November elec
tion nears.
President Eisenhower, from
Washington, said yesterday that
he is stepping up his campaign
activities in the election battle
with Democratic aspirant Adlai
E. Stevenson who spoke last
night at a Democratic rally in St.
Louis.
No Barnstorming
The President, who firmly
ruled out any "barnstorming,"
told a news conference he had
added "two or three" more
speeches to his schedule. He said
he thinks he is "a little weak"
when it comes to trying to turn
down requests from "such good
friends."
Eisenhower rejected any sug
gestion that he stepped up his
speech-making because of reports
from Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon indicating that the election
race might be closer than the Re
publicans had anticipated.
But he said lie still is going on
tjie theory that the GOP should
put its "whole heart" into the
campaign because "there is to
the very last minute—a chance to
lose it."
As for his own role, the chief
executive said "there is no health
question involved whatsoever at
the moment." He said that while
he leads a "more ordered" life
since his heart attack, he has felt
no ill effects either from his cam
paigning or his golf.
"Bread and Circuses"
Democratic candidate Steven
son charged last night in St.
Louis that the Republicans were
trying to blind the public to
world conditions with the cry of
"bread and circuses."
Stevenson spoke in a major
campaign address at a Democrat
ic rally at the packed mid-town
Missouri Theater.
Stevenson quoted the "organiz
er" of the Republican National
Convention as saying "politics is
moving closer to show business."
"It certainly is," Stevenson
said, "as they present it — bal
looned up arguments, the chorus
line, not the political issues."
Stevenson said "bread and cir
cuses didn't save Rome, and it
won't save the Republicans ei
ther!"
No Future
The Republican claim to be
"the party of the future" was
thrown out with Teddy Roose
velt, the Democratic nominee
said.
He said the "achievements to
which President Eisenhower

points with such pride . . . consist
mostly of not repealing what the j
Democrats had done.
"The innovations were Demo
cratic ideas which on other occa- ]
sions the Republicans denounced
as big government, creeping so
cialism and bureaucracy."
Stevenson said the "specifically
Republican ideas, such as tax re
ductions which favor the well-to
do, the partnership approach to
power projects in which the pri
vate partner gets the profits and
the public foots the bill, collap
sible price supports, hacking
away at conservation, REA and
TVA, are ... as old as the Re
publican party and represent its
lasting principle — to help those
who can also help themselves."
Defends Benson
Replying to a flurry of politi
cal questions, Eisenhower
staunchly defended Agriculture
Secretary Ezra T. Benson and
firmly endorsed Nixon's "four
day" work week prediction. He
said Benson is working for the
"long-term benefit" of farmers.
His eyes flashing, the Presi
dent also fired back at Steven
son's charge tHat his administra
tion had appeased former Argen
tine dictator Juan D. Peron, and
that his brother, Milton, had as
sumed a "special responsibility"
in U.S. policy toward Argentina.
Eisenhower said it was the
Democrats who gave Peron $130
million in loans, not the Republi
cans. Furthermore, he said, his
brother always acted on the re
quest of the State Department
and "has not attempted to fix any
policy for South America."
Russian Roulette
The chief executive, who re
plied to Democratic charges with
unusual vigor, was asked wheth
er he wished to comment on for
mer Secretary of State Dean
Acheson's statement last night
that the GOP administration was
"playing Russian roulette with
an atomic pistol."
He replied that the election

campaign will be settled on the |
basis of the facts and not "on the (
basis of wisecracks."
Asked about Stevenson's j
charge that he has not asserted
"positive" leadership, Eisenhow- j
er said he will leave the answer
to that to'Winston Churchill and
his other associates of tlie past 15 (
years.
Eisenhower replied with great
seriousness when he was asked if
he agreed with the assertions of
some Republicans that recent
American wars have been "Demo
cratic wars."
All the People
"Look," he shot back, "just as I
believe that every President is
President of all the people,' there
is no such thing as a President of
the Republicans. There is no
such thing as a President of the
Democrats. ... I don't believe
when America gets into war we
can afford to call it anything but
our war."
In discussing the campaign,
the President said his plans were
| only tentative when he an
nounced earlier this year that he
would make only "five or six"
speeches. What is more, he said,
his expanded schedule is not
"one-tenth of what a lot of people
want me to do."
Seething Boil
Referring to foreign affairs,
Stevenson said the "great caul
dron of the world is now seething
to a boil while our Republican
friends say, 'All is well,' and don't
bother even to look at the stove."
"How can Its import be felt . . .
if, all the time, the skies are
filled with Republican lullabies?"
The Democratic candidate told
his audience the competition the
Soviets offer "is not simply for
today and tomorrow, we must
reckon on it for decades." He
said Soviet plans to pull level
with America in industrial pro
duction by 1965 and ahead by
1970 "are today on schedule."
"We must face squarely," Ste
venson said, "the prospect that 20

years from now, if present rates
of development continue, the ba
sic balance of productive power
in the world may well have
swung away from the side of
freedom.
"None of these risks appear in
Republican electoral speeches.
They will be dismissed as defeat
ism and lack of faith in America.
Nixon
Vice-President Richard M. Nix
on said tonight that Adlai E. Ste
venson and other Democratic
candidates "have been unable or

unwilling to disassociate them
j selves from the defeatist prin-
I ciples that weren't good enough
i in 1952."
Nixon told an audience at the
Springfield Armory, latest stop
on his 32 -state campaign tour,
that Stevenson "has again openly
embraced Mr. Truman person
ally, politically and ideologically."
Consequently, he sai d, "the
choice it) 195(5 is: Shall we go
forward with Eisenhower or back
to the policies of the Truman re
gime?"

brother always acted on the re
quest of the State Department
and "has not attempted to fix any
policy for South America."
Russian Roulette
The chief executive, who re
plied to Democratic charges with
unusual vigor, was asked wheth
er he wished to comment on for
mer Secretary of State Dean
Acheson's statement last night
that the GOP administration was
"playing Russian roulette with
an atomic pistol."
He replied that the election

campaign will be settled on the |
basis of the facts and not "on the (
basis of wisecracks."
Asked about Stevenson's j
charge that he has not asserted
"positive" leadership, Eisenhow- j
er said he will leave the answer
to that to'Winston Churchill and
his other associates of tlie past 15 (
years.
Eisenhower replied with great
seriousness when he was asked if
he agreed with the assertions of
some Republicans that recent
American wars have been "Demo
cratic wars."
All the People
"Look," he shot back, "just as I
believe that every President is
President of all the people,' there
is no such thing as a President of
the Republicans. There is no
such thing as a President of the
Democrats. ... I don't believe
when America gets into war we
can afford to call it anything but
our war."
In discussing the campaign,
the President said his plans were
| only tentative when he an
nounced earlier this year that he
would make only "five or six"
speeches. What is more, he said,
his expanded schedule is not
"one-tenth of what a lot of people
want me to do."
Seething Boil
Referring to foreign affairs,
Stevenson said the "great caul
dron of the world is now seething
to a boil while our Republican
friends say, 'All is well,' and don't
bother even to look at the stove."
"How can Its import be felt . . .
if, all the time, the skies are
filled with Republican lullabies?"
The Democratic candidate told
his audience the competition the
Soviets offer "is not simply for
today and tomorrow, we must
reckon on it for decades." He
said Soviet plans to pull level
with America in industrial pro
duction by 1965 and ahead by
1970 "are today on schedule."
"We must face squarely," Ste
venson said, "the prospect that 20

years from now, if present rates
of development continue, the ba
sic balance of productive power
in the world may well have
swung away from the side of
freedom.
"None of these risks appear in
Republican electoral speeches.
They will be dismissed as defeat
ism and lack of faith in America.
Nixon
Vice-President Richard M. Nix
on said tonight that Adlai E. Ste
venson and other Democratic
candidates "have been unable or

unwilling to disassociate them
j selves from the defeatist prin-
I ciples that weren't good enough
i in 1952."
Nixon told an audience at the
Springfield Armory, latest stop
on his 32 -state campaign tour,
that Stevenson "has again openly
embraced Mr. Truman person
ally, politically and ideologically."
Consequently, he sai d, "the
choice it) 195(5 is: Shall we go
forward with Eisenhower or back
to the policies of the Truman re
gime?"
Both presidential candidates
are jumping headlong into their
campaigns as the November elec
tion nears.
President Eisenhower, from
Washington, said yesterday that
he is stepping up his campaign
activities in the election battle
with Democratic aspirant Adlai
E. Stevenson who spoke last
night at a Democratic rally in St.
Louis.
No Barnstorming
The President, who firmly
ruled out any "barnstorming,"
told a news conference he had
added "two or three" more
speeches to his schedule. He said
he thinks he is "a little weak"
when it comes to trying to turn
down requests from "such good
friends."
Eisenhower rejected any sug
gestion that he stepped up his
speech-making because of reports
from Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon indicating that the election
race might be closer than the Re
publicans had anticipated.
But he said lie still is going on
tjie theory that the GOP should
put its "whole heart" into the
campaign because "there is to
the very last minute—a chance to
lose it."
As for his own role, the chief
executive said "there is no health
question involved whatsoever at
the moment." He said that while
he leads a "more ordered" life
since his heart attack, he has felt
no ill effects either from his cam
paigning or his golf.
"Bread and Circuses"
Democratic candidate Steven
son charged last night in St.
Louis that the Republicans were
trying to blind the public to
world conditions with the cry of
"bread and circuses."
Stevenson spoke in a major
campaign address at a Democrat
ic rally at the packed mid-town
Missouri Theater.
Stevenson quoted the "organiz
er" of the Republican National
Convention as saying "politics is
moving closer to show business."
"It certainly is," Stevenson
said, "as they present it — bal
looned up arguments, the chorus
line, not the political issues."
Stevenson said "bread and cir
cuses didn't save Rome, and it
won't save the Republicans ei
ther!"
No Future
The Republican claim to be
"the party of the future" was
thrown out with Teddy Roose
velt, the Democratic nominee
said.
He said the "achievements to
which President Eisenhower

points with such pride . . . consist
mostly of not repealing what the j
Democrats had done.
"The innovations were Demo
cratic ideas which on other occa- ]
sions the Republicans denounced
as big government, creeping so
cialism and bureaucracy."
Stevenson said the "specifically
Republican ideas, such as tax re
ductions which favor the well-to
do, the partnership approach to
power projects in which the pri
vate partner gets the profits and
the public foots the bill, collap
sible price supports, hacking
away at conservation, REA and
TVA, are ... as old as the Re
publican party and represent its
lasting principle — to help those
who can also help themselves."
Defends Benson
Replying to a flurry of politi
cal questions, Eisenhower
staunchly defended Agriculture
Secretary Ezra T. Benson and
firmly endorsed Nixon's "four
day" work week prediction. He
said Benson is working for the
"long-term benefit" of farmers.
His eyes flashing, the Presi
dent also fired back at Steven
son's charge tHat his administra
tion had appeased former Argen
tine dictator Juan D. Peron, and
that his brother, Milton, had as
sumed a "special responsibility"
in U.S. policy toward Argentina.
Eisenhower said it was the
Democrats who gave Peron $130
million in loans, not the Republi
cans. Furthermore, he said, his
brother always acted on the re
quest of the State Department
and "has not attempted to fix any
policy for South America."

The President, who firmly
ruled out any "barnstorming,"
told a news conference he had
added "two or three" more
speeches to his schedule. He said
he thinks he is "a little weak"
when it comes to trying to turn
down requests from "such good
friends."
Eisenhower rejected any sug
gestion that he stepped up his
speech-making because of reports
from Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon indicating that the election
race might be closer than the Re
publicans had anticipated.
But he said lie still is going on
tjie theory that the GOP should
put its "whole heart" into the
campaign because "there is to
the very last minute—a chance to
lose it."
As for his own role, the chief
executive said "there is no health
question involved whatsoever at
the moment." He said that while
he leads a "more ordered" life
since his heart attack, he has felt
no ill effects either from his cam
paigning or his golf.
"Bread and Circuses"
Democratic candidate Steven
son charged last night in St.
Louis that the Republicans were
trying to blind the public to
world conditions with the cry of
"bread and circuses."
Stevenson spoke in a major
campaign address at a Democrat
ic rally at the packed mid-town
Missouri Theater.
Stevenson quoted the "organiz
er" of the Republican National
Convention as saying "politics is
moving closer to show business."
"It certainly is," Stevenson
said, "as they present it — bal
looned up arguments, the chorus
line, not the political issues."
Stevenson said "bread and cir
cuses didn't save Rome, and it
won't save the Republicans ei
ther!"
No Future
The Republican claim to be
"the party of the future" was
thrown out with Teddy Roose
velt, the Democratic nominee
said.
He said the "achievements to
which President Eisenhower

points with such pride . . . consist
mostly of not repealing what the j
Democrats had done.
"The innovations were Demo
cratic ideas which on other occa- ]
sions the Republicans denounced
as big government, creeping so
cialism and bureaucracy."
Stevenson said the "specifically
Republican ideas, such as tax re
ductions which favor the well-to
do, the partnership approach to
power projects in which the pri
vate partner gets the profits and
the public foots the bill, collap
sible price supports, hacking
away at conservation, REA and
TVA, are ... as old as the Re
publican party and represent its
lasting principle — to help those
who can also help themselves."
Defends Benson
Replying to a flurry of politi
cal questions, Eisenhower
staunchly defended Agriculture
Secretary Ezra T. Benson and
firmly endorsed Nixon's "four
day" work week prediction. He
said Benson is working for the
"long-term benefit" of farmers.
His eyes flashing, the Presi
dent also fired back at Steven
son's charge tHat his administra
tion had appeased former Argen
tine dictator Juan D. Peron, and
that his brother, Milton, had as
sumed a "special responsibility"
in U.S. policy toward Argentina.
Eisenhower said it was the
Democrats who gave Peron $130
million in loans, not the Republi
cans. Furthermore, he said, his
brother always acted on the re
quest of the State Department
and "has not attempted to fix any
policy for South America."
Russian Roulette
The chief executive, who re
plied to Democratic charges with
unusual vigor, was asked wheth
er he wished to comment on for
mer Secretary of State Dean
Acheson's statement last night
that the GOP administration was
"playing Russian roulette with
an atomic pistol."
He replied that the election

campaign will be settled on the |
basis of the facts and not "on the (
basis of wisecracks."
Asked about Stevenson's j
charge that he has not asserted
"positive" leadership, Eisenhow- j
er said he will leave the answer
to that to'Winston Churchill and
his other associates of tlie past 15 (
years.
Eisenhower replied with great
seriousness when he was asked if
he agreed with the assertions of
some Republicans that recent
American wars have been "Demo
cratic wars."
All the People
"Look," he shot back, "just as I
believe that every President is
President of all the people,' there
is no such thing as a President of
the Republicans. There is no
such thing as a President of the
Democrats. ... I don't believe
when America gets into war we
can afford to call it anything but
our war."
In discussing the campaign,
the President said his plans were
| only tentative when he an
nounced earlier this year that he
would make only "five or six"
speeches. What is more, he said,
his expanded schedule is not
"one-tenth of what a lot of people
want me to do."
Seething Boil
Referring to foreign affairs,
Stevenson said the "great caul
dron of the world is now seething
to a boil while our Republican
friends say, 'All is well,' and don't
bother even to look at the stove."
"How can Its import be felt . . .
if, all the time, the skies are
filled with Republican lullabies?"
The Democratic candidate told
his audience the competition the
Soviets offer "is not simply for
today and tomorrow, we must
reckon on it for decades." He
said Soviet plans to pull level
with America in industrial pro
duction by 1965 and ahead by
1970 "are today on schedule."
"We must face squarely," Ste
venson said, "the prospect that 20

years from now, if present rates
of development continue, the ba
sic balance of productive power
in the world may well have
swung away from the side of
freedom.
"None of these risks appear in
Republican electoral speeches.
They will be dismissed as defeat
ism and lack of faith in America.
Nixon
Vice-President Richard M. Nix
on said tonight that Adlai E. Ste
venson and other Democratic
candidates "have been unable or

unwilling to disassociate them
j selves from the defeatist prin-
I ciples that weren't good enough
i in 1952."
Nixon told an audience at the
Springfield Armory, latest stop
on his 32 -state campaign tour,
that Stevenson "has again openly
embraced Mr. Truman person
ally, politically and ideologically."
Consequently, he sai d, "the
choice it) 195(5 is: Shall we go
forward with Eisenhower or back
to the policies of the Truman re
gime?"
Both presidential candidates
are jumping headlong into their
campaigns as the November elec
tion nears.
President Eisenhower, from
Washington, said yesterday that
he is stepping up his campaign
activities in the election battle
with Democratic aspirant Adlai
E. Stevenson who spoke last
night at a Democratic rally in St.
Louis.

He replied that the election

campaign will be settled on the |
basis of the facts and not "on the (
basis of wisecracks."
Asked about Stevenson's j
charge that he has not asserted
"positive" leadership, Eisenhow- j
er said he will leave the answer
to that to'Winston Churchill and
his other associates of tlie past 15 (
years.
Eisenhower replied with great
seriousness when he was asked if
he agreed with the assertions of
some Republicans that recent
American wars have been "Demo
cratic wars."
All the People
"Look," he shot back, "just as I
believe that every President is
President of all the people,' there
is no such thing as a President of
the Republicans. There is no
such thing as a President of the
Democrats. ... I don't believe
when America gets into war we
can afford to call it anything but
our war."
In discussing the campaign,
the President said his plans were
| only tentative when he an
nounced earlier this year that he
would make only "five or six"
speeches. What is more, he said,
his expanded schedule is not
"one-tenth of what a lot of people
want me to do."
Seething Boil
Referring to foreign affairs,
Stevenson said the "great caul
dron of the world is now seething
to a boil while our Republican
friends say, 'All is well,' and don't
bother even to look at the stove."
"How can Its import be felt . . .
if, all the time, the skies are
filled with Republican lullabies?"
The Democratic candidate told
his audience the competition the
Soviets offer "is not simply for
today and tomorrow, we must
reckon on it for decades." He
said Soviet plans to pull level
with America in industrial pro
duction by 1965 and ahead by
1970 "are today on schedule."
"We must face squarely," Ste
venson said, "the prospect that 20

years from now, if present rates
of development continue, the ba
sic balance of productive power
in the world may well have
swung away from the side of
freedom.
"None of these risks appear in
Republican electoral speeches.
They will be dismissed as defeat
ism and lack of faith in America.
Nixon
Vice-President Richard M. Nix
on said tonight that Adlai E. Ste
venson and other Democratic
candidates "have been unable or

unwilling to disassociate them
j selves from the defeatist prin-
I ciples that weren't good enough
i in 1952."
Nixon told an audience at the
Springfield Armory, latest stop
on his 32 -state campaign tour,
that Stevenson "has again openly
embraced Mr. Truman person
ally, politically and ideologically."
Consequently, he sai d, "the
choice it) 195(5 is: Shall we go
forward with Eisenhower or back
to the policies of the Truman re
gime?"
Both presidential candidates
are jumping headlong into their
campaigns as the November elec
tion nears.
President Eisenhower, from
Washington, said yesterday that
he is stepping up his campaign
activities in the election battle
with Democratic aspirant Adlai
E. Stevenson who spoke last
night at a Democratic rally in St.
Louis.
No Barnstorming
The President, who firmly
ruled out any "barnstorming,"
told a news conference he had
added "two or three" more
speeches to his schedule. He said
he thinks he is "a little weak"
when it comes to trying to turn
down requests from "such good
friends."
Eisenhower rejected any sug
gestion that he stepped up his
speech-making because of reports
from Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon indicating that the election
race might be closer than the Re
publicans had anticipated.
But he said lie still is going on
tjie theory that the GOP should
put its "whole heart" into the
campaign because "there is to
the very last minute—a chance to
lose it."
As for his own role, the chief
executive said "there is no health
question involved whatsoever at
the moment." He said that while
he leads a "more ordered" life
since his heart attack, he has felt
no ill effects either from his cam
paigning or his golf.
"Bread and Circuses"
Democratic candidate Steven
son charged last night in St.
Louis that the Republicans were
trying to blind the public to
world conditions with the cry of
"bread and circuses."
Stevenson spoke in a major
campaign address at a Democrat
ic rally at the packed mid-town
Missouri Theater.
Stevenson quoted the "organiz
er" of the Republican National
Convention as saying "politics is
moving closer to show business."
"It certainly is," Stevenson
said, "as they present it — bal
looned up arguments, the chorus
line, not the political issues."
Stevenson said "bread and cir
cuses didn't save Rome, and it
won't save the Republicans ei
ther!"
No Future
The Republican claim to be
"the party of the future" was
thrown out with Teddy Roose
velt, the Democratic nominee
said.
He said the "achievements to
which President Eisenhower

points with such pride . . . consist
mostly of not repealing what the j
Democrats had done.
"The innovations were Demo
cratic ideas which on other occa- ]
sions the Republicans denounced
as big government, creeping so
cialism and bureaucracy."
Stevenson said the "specifically
Republican ideas, such as tax re
ductions which favor the well-to
do, the partnership approach to
power projects in which the pri
vate partner gets the profits and
the public foots the bill, collap
sible price supports, hacking
away at conservation, REA and
TVA, are ... as old as the Re
publican party and represent its
lasting principle — to help those
who can also help themselves."
Defends Benson
Replying to a flurry of politi
cal questions, Eisenhower
staunchly defended Agriculture
Secretary Ezra T. Benson and
firmly endorsed Nixon's "four
day" work week prediction. He
said Benson is working for the
"long-term benefit" of farmers.
His eyes flashing, the Presi
dent also fired back at Steven
son's charge tHat his administra
tion had appeased former Argen
tine dictator Juan D. Peron, and
that his brother, Milton, had as
sumed a "special responsibility"
in U.S. policy toward Argentina.
Eisenhower said it was the
Democrats who gave Peron $130
million in loans, not the Republi
cans. Furthermore, he said, his
brother always acted on the re
quest of the State Department
and "has not attempted to fix any
policy for South America."
Russian Roulette
The chief executive, who re
plied to Democratic charges with
unusual vigor, was asked wheth
er he wished to comment on for
mer Secretary of State Dean
Acheson's statement last night
that the GOP administration was
"playing Russian roulette with
an atomic pistol."
He replied that the election

campaign will be settled on the |
basis of the facts and not "on the (
basis of wisecracks."
Asked about Stevenson's j
charge that he has not asserted
"positive" leadership, Eisenhow- j
er said he will leave the answer
to that to'Winston Churchill and
his other associates of tlie past 15 (
