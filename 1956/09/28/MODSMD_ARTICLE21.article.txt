ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR

Today* I begin the third year of writing this col- ■
umn for Philip Morris Cigarettes, and lam merry in j
my heart. J
lam merry for several reasons. First, because lam 112
being paid. /
Not, let me hasten to state, that an emolument was
necessary. "Sirs," I said a few days ago to the makers
of Philip Morris, who underneath their dickeys are as
friendly as pups and twice as cute, "Sirs," I said to this
winsome assemblage, "there is no need to pay me for
writing this column. If I can introduce America's college
men and women to Philip Morris's natural tobacco good
ness, if I can inaugurate them into the vast sodality of
Philip Morris smokers and thus enhance their happiness,
heighten their zest, upgrade their gusto, magnify their
cheer, broaden their bliss, augment their glee, and in
crease their PQ —"
"PQ?" said the makers, looking at me askance. ,<
"Pleasure Quotient," I explained. /
"Ah!" said the makers, nodding their sweet, shaggy
heads.
"If," I continued, "I can do these splendid things for
the college population of America, there is no need for
money, because I am more than amply repaid."
We wept then. I am not ashamed to say it. WE
WEPT! I wish the wiseacres who say big business is
cold and heartless could have been there that day. I wish
they could have witnessed the deep, croaking sobs that
racked the gathering, the great, shimmering tears that
splashed on the boardroom table. We wept, every man
jack of us. The makers wept. The secretaries wept. I
wept. My agent, Clyde Greedy, wept. We wept all.
"No, no!" cried one of the makers, whose name is
Good Sam. "We insist on paying you."
"Oh, all right," I said.
Then we laughed. The gloom passed like a summer
shower. We all laughed and chose up sides and played
stoop-tug and had steaming mugs of cocoa and lit plump,
firm, white cigarettes, brimming full of natural tobacco
goodness. I mean Philip Morris, of eorris!

Refreshed and exalted, we returned to the busi
ness at hand. "Now then," said one of the makers, whose
name is Merry Andrew, "what will you write about in
your column this year?"
"About students and teachers," I said. "About classes
and cutting. About eds and coeds. About Greeks and
independents. About the important issues that occupy
the supple young minds of college America."
"Like what?" asked one of the makers, whose name
is ToPable David.
"Like how to finance a full social life without a re
volver," I replied. "Like how to wear Bermuda shorts
though your knees look like brain-coral. Like how to
double-date in an MG." {
"And will you," asked one of the makers, whose name
is Peter-Sit-by-the-Fire, "from time to time say a pleas
ant word about Philip Morris Cigarettes, which are now
available in two sizes — Regular in the familiar Snap-
Open Pack, and Long Size in the new Crushproof Box?"
"Crazy kid!" I chuckled, pushing my fist gently
against his jaw. "You know I will."
And we all shook hands — silently, firmly, manlily —
and I left, dabbing at my eyes with my agent, and hurried
to the nearest typewriter.
