# LONG, LONG LINES
## Complaints Voiced on Book Lines 
### Linda Marquette 
With classes no longer a thing
of the future hut a daily reality,
books have become an absolute
necessity. The Engineering Cor
ner opened this year to facilitate
the buying of freshman books
but the lines outside the Stanford
Bookstore still persist in length
and strength.
Mrs. Bauehou, manager of the
Bookstore, maintains that a new
bookstore is* the only solution to
the problem at hand. She said
that the students behind the
counters are doing their best but
are very overworked. The long
lines are only a visual indication
of the present state of affairs.
The unsuspecting buyer joins the
tail end of Ihe line and if he is
lucky he gets to the door within
two hours, foot-weary, tired, usu
ally hungry and more than ready
with his opinion:
Tony Thomas, '58, Delta Upsi
lon: "I think that a new book
store should be built and that the
present store should be used as
a gift shop. Or we could have dif
ferent distributing stations for
different classes. As a final sug
gestion, 1 would greatly appreci
ate a chair."
Aim Arnold, '58, Storey: "It
has always been this bad but a
long line is inevitable until there
is more room."
Dick Mellcn, '59, IVIa Tlieta I»i:
"The line is aggravating but I'm
used to it; it doesn't bother me
any more."
Sally IVlcllenry, '59, Florence
Moore: "There must be a more
efficient way to buy books. This
is something that ought to be
worked on by the ASSU. There
could possibly be two lines: one
for people who only have one or
two books to buy and another for
those people who have 10, 12 or
more. This might speed things
up c'i bit."
Greg Wilkinson, grad student,
I'alo Alio: "In the four previous
years I've been at Stanford I've
never before had to wait so long.
This is a good afternoon's work."
Ed Toby, '58, Delia Chi: "We
Rave no choice but to wait. How
ever. I've figured out that $30,000
of working hours are wasted
while kids stand in line. If you
reason that 5000 people are in
line, that the average wage for
an unskilled worker is $2 an hour
and that most have to wait ap
proximately three hours, you
reach this startling conclusion.
With all the brain power around
this place, I would think that a
more efficient way of doing
things could he found."
Susan Davidge, V>B, Lagunila:
"I'm just so tired I can't think

any more. I've been standing
here through dinner; there must
he some easier way to obtain two
small books."
Tom Williams, T>9, Slern: "I've
learned my lesson. Next year I
get my books before the rush |
during spring quarter."
Dick Kreiizberg, grad s!u<!<*nt,
off - campus: "I thought they
wore giving something away for
nothing when I saw the tine."
Hon Horsely, V>7, off-campus:
"In the four* years I've been here j
I've never seen anything t his bad.
With proper analysis the situa
tion could be substantially im
prover!. They could get someone
in industrial engineering to help J
straighten out this mess."
A! Hanton, T>B, Village: "This j
is terrible. I think Ihe lines could j
be split up according to depart- j
ments. In the long run it would j
have money and time if the books
could be moved into rooms on
the Quad and divided according j
to class and subject. It would be i
necessary to have more help if
this was done but if would be
easier on both sides of the fence."


STUDYING SO SOON? —Amid a pile of used-book boxes, a tired
Stanford girl wails out the book line. It's getting late and she
basn't eaten, but she'll get her books. Waits of up lo two hours
are not uneommon in this year's book lines.
