# Louie Armstrong 'Sends 'Em' at SRI Noon Forum
## 
### 
A group of men from the Stan
ford Research Institute, although
amateurs, had the experience of
a lifetime when they played with
Louis Armstrong.
The Negro trumpeter played a
command performance at the
SRI monthly noon forum and set
the enthusiastic audience to clap
ping and singing by his last num
ber, ")Vhen the Saints Go March
ing In."
Backing up Armstrong was the
six-piece band of SRI men which
included Bill Skinner and Dick
King, trumpets; Chuck Elkind,
trombone; Chuck Monsalve,
drums; Hugh Smith, banjo, and
Tom O'Neill, pianist.
O'Neill, SRI security officer,
had the spotlight when he played
the solo on "China Boy." Louis
brought chuckles from the men
when he shouted "Meade Lux"
during the solo — comparing
O'Neill to boogie woogie pianist
Meade Lux Lewis.
The jazz player led the "musi
cians" through such old stand
bys as "Basin Stret Blues," "St.
James Infirmary," "I Can't Give
You Anything But Love" and
"The Darktown Strutters Ball."
After this Armstrong quipped
with master of ceremonies Rog
ers Canncll about "rock and roll"
and his planned visit to Russia in
February. At first he complained
about being up at "this time of
morning" hut after the program
and autograph signing he said
happily, "I'm woke up now."
