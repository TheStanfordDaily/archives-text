# Card Stunts Will Welcome Class of '60

### Ellen Spiegl 
A welcome to the class of 1960 will be fea
tured in Stanford's card stunts during the
half-time of the Michigan State football game
tomorrow. A red "60'.' will be shown on a field
ot metallic silver cards, with "Frosh" written
across the top.
Rally Com members spend a busy week
preparing stunts before each football game.
According to Ed Bordenkircher, chairman of
the card stunts committee, the work begins
on Saturday morning a week before the game.
At that time Nancy Boeseke and her art
committee begin designs for the stunts, adapt
ing old stunts,-creating new ones and drawing
them out ou numbered charts.
During the week these designs are modi
fied, color patterns are checked, and a general
overhauling is done. As soon as the designs
are finished Rally Com members begin to
make out instruction cards. Each seat in the
rooting section must have a card with instruc
tions for each of the stunts.
"The real work," Bordenkircher said, "is
on Saturday morning when we put the cards
and instruction sheets in the stands and direct
the stunts."
Rally Com last year purchased new cards

for the stunts, which are still in good condi
tion and will be used again this season. Many
of these are silver and gold metallic cards.
This week's stunts will include a "Salute to
Michigan" and a caricature of "Coach Chuck."
An intricate checkerboard pattern in red and
white with the contrasting color in each
square spelling "Stanford" will he featured as
a new type of signature stunt. The traditional
expanding "S" will make its annual appear
ance this season.
Bordenkircher explained that there will be
more than 10 stunts for some of the later
games, and that "we'd rather have 12 to 15
good stunts well executed than lots of medi
ocre ones badly done. y
Optimistic Rally Com members are hope
fully looking toward special stunts for Big
Game, and admit that they have begun consid
ering possible Rose Bowl stunts.
"We are trying," Bordenkircher said, "to
put the proper emphasis on card stunts this
year, and hope that students will think of
them as their own card stunts, performed by
their own rooting section. Rally Corn's part is
one of helping the student body, not of putting
on their own show."
