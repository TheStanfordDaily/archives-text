"Ami if a house be divided against itself, tiuit house cannot
stand." (Mark iii, 25.)
These may seem like strange words to head a sports* column.
Yet they are ageless words and applicable to many situations. The
Pacific Coast Conference may not be divided, but few will deny that
its structure is weak. Perhaps our nine-tenement house is more like
the one in the current novelty song where the train runs through
the middle.
Like the ill-fated bill collectors in the song, someone forgot to
warn Washington, California, UCLA and Southern California that
the old switchman, Gate Receipts, was letting the Amateur Express
come through this year under a full head of steam.
Literally thousands upon thousands of words have been writ
ten about the severe disciplinary action taken by Coast authori
ties. Never before lias baseball been forced to take such a back
seat to football during the spring and summer months.
The disciplinary action has been called many things. So have the
disciplinarians. One large Southland newspaper ran a long series of
articles written by a Midwestern sports writer who was supposed
to give the objective viewpoint. The paper refers to the whole busi
ness as "the mess."
One Smogland sports columnist constantly refers to the authori
ties who penalized USC and the Bellowing Bruins as "the Foundering
Fathers." The first'time or two he used this expression i't might
have fallen under a classification of witty. That is, if you give the
word a wide range of meaning, especially in the lower levels.
Any "good" thing can be run into the ground, and this bit of low
humor is no exception.' Hardly a column goes by without the appear
ance of his pet phrase. He appears to have become so enthralled
ov«r his own "masterpiece" that he is unaware he has foundered so
deep in his own mire.
However, the word most commonly used to describe the
severe penalties is "scandal." In our opinion this is a misnomer.
If a slum exists in (lie heart of a great t-it.v, it is certainly no
scandal to tear it down and rebuild. This is what the Conference
authorities are attempting to do. Instead of being praised for
their sincere actions, they are ridiculed from almost every side.
Little has been written in defense' of football lately. It is easy
to come to the conclusion that the game is a menace to society and
should be abolished. Although we certainly don't condone the under
handed practices existing in far too many colleges today, we do love
the game and believe it is worth saving.
Almost desperately we searched for a man on a white horse to
champion our cause. Al last we found our man in the poet laureate
of sports writers, the late Grantland Rice. In his book "The Tumult
and the Shouting" he devoted a chapter to his opinion of football.
Chapter 17 of Rice's autobiographical novel is entitled "This Game
of Football, an Appraisal." In our opinion these five readable pages
should be made required reading for every football player and coach.
Rice wrote:
"Pressure from alumni and students and criticism from foot
ball writers . . . crowds them into an untenable spot. They're
all supposed In win when only half of them can. They forget
that, entirely! Nothing makes me sorer than to have a coach
say: 'Sure I did it. I broke the rule. But so does every coach
in the country.'
"It has been the idea of too many coaches that the main offense
or penalty in breaking a rule was to be caught. 'If you can get away
with it, fine . . . just don't get caught.' "
If Rice hadn't died before the PCC penalties were assessed, we
would almost believe he was talking directly to a few "highly re
garded" West Coast coaches. Recognize anyone you know? Rice
continued:
"Football, one of the greatest games, can be made greater only
if it is cleaned up and protected. It has taken more punishment than
boxing has and boxing, on the average, doesn't deserve to be men
tioned with any decent sport. Comparatively speaking, football is
in an entirely different setting. It has practically none of the thugs,
crooks, cheaters, hjims and chiselers that boxing knows to a large
degree.
Football is a game. This seems like an absurd statement to
make. But, like all games, football has its rules. If the rules are
not obeyed, then it seems it should logically follow that you are
no longer playing the game. To quote from"The Tumult and
the Shouting" again:
"Football has one glaring weakness. The game is built largely
upon constant rule-breaking such as holding, off-side, backs illegally
in motion, pass interference and other factors that play a big, if
illegal, part in results."
It is impossible to play the game without committing some infrac
tions of the rules. However, intentional rule-breaking is inexcusable.
We agree with Rice that "the game is built for rule-breaking," but
we disagree with him that this is the game's "one glaring weakness."
To us this is the factor that makes the game worth saving. Every
play is a challenge to the player. If a player can be taught to disci
pline himself to play the game according to the rules, even though
an immediate gain and possibly a game-winning touchdown can be
obtained by breaking the rules, he has learned a lesson that will stick
with him the rest of his life.
In (he football trade this lesson is known as "character build
ing." It is a tired old phrase that has suffered much abuse. But
in the long run it is football's most important offering. How
many will remember the Washington State score 25 years from
now?
It is a pity that all coaches don't realize this fact. Despite the
malpractices of a few who have given football such a bad name, the
game has qualities that merit saving. One can only hope that the
good elements in football will be sufficient to overcome its evils,
so that the worthy side of the game will last forever.

"Football, one of the greatest games, can be made greater only
if it is cleaned up and protected. It has taken more punishment than
boxing has and boxing, on the average, doesn't deserve to be men
tioned with any decent sport. Comparatively speaking, football is
in an entirely different setting. It has practically none of the thugs,
crooks, cheaters, hjims and chiselers that boxing knows to a large
degree.
Football is a game. This seems like an absurd statement to
make. But, like all games, football has its rules. If the rules are
not obeyed, then it seems it should logically follow that you are
no longer playing the game. To quote from"The Tumult and
the Shouting" again:
"Football has one glaring weakness. The game is built largely
upon constant rule-breaking such as holding, off-side, backs illegally
in motion, pass interference and other factors that play a big, if
illegal, part in results."
It is impossible to play the game without committing some infrac
tions of the rules. However, intentional rule-breaking is inexcusable.
We agree with Rice that "the game is built for rule-breaking," but
we disagree with him that this is the game's "one glaring weakness."
To us this is the factor that makes the game worth saving. Every
play is a challenge to the player. If a player can be taught to disci
pline himself to play the game according to the rules, even though
an immediate gain and possibly a game-winning touchdown can be
obtained by breaking the rules, he has learned a lesson that will stick
with him the rest of his life.
In (he football trade this lesson is known as "character build
ing." It is a tired old phrase that has suffered much abuse. But
in the long run it is football's most important offering. How
many will remember the Washington State score 25 years from
now?
It is a pity that all coaches don't realize this fact. Despite the
malpractices of a few who have given football such a bad name, the
game has qualities that merit saving. One can only hope that the
good elements in football will be sufficient to overcome its evils,
so that the worthy side of the game will last forever.
"Ami if a house be divided against itself, tiuit house cannot
stand." (Mark iii, 25.)
These may seem like strange words to head a sports* column.
Yet they are ageless words and applicable to many situations. The
Pacific Coast Conference may not be divided, but few will deny that
its structure is weak. Perhaps our nine-tenement house is more like
the one in the current novelty song where the train runs through
the middle.
Like the ill-fated bill collectors in the song, someone forgot to
warn Washington, California, UCLA and Southern California that
the old switchman, Gate Receipts, was letting the Amateur Express
come through this year under a full head of steam.
Literally thousands upon thousands of words have been writ
ten about the severe disciplinary action taken by Coast authori
ties. Never before lias baseball been forced to take such a back
seat to football during the spring and summer months.
The disciplinary action has been called many things. So have the
disciplinarians. One large Southland newspaper ran a long series of
articles written by a Midwestern sports writer who was supposed
to give the objective viewpoint. The paper refers to the whole busi
ness as "the mess."
One Smogland sports columnist constantly refers to the authori
ties who penalized USC and the Bellowing Bruins as "the Foundering
Fathers." The first'time or two he used this expression i't might
have fallen under a classification of witty. That is, if you give the
word a wide range of meaning, especially in the lower levels.
Any "good" thing can be run into the ground, and this bit of low
humor is no exception.' Hardly a column goes by without the appear
ance of his pet phrase. He appears to have become so enthralled
ov«r his own "masterpiece" that he is unaware he has foundered so
deep in his own mire.
However, the word most commonly used to describe the
severe penalties is "scandal." In our opinion this is a misnomer.
If a slum exists in (lie heart of a great t-it.v, it is certainly no
scandal to tear it down and rebuild. This is what the Conference
authorities are attempting to do. Instead of being praised for
their sincere actions, they are ridiculed from almost every side.
Little has been written in defense' of football lately. It is easy
to come to the conclusion that the game is a menace to society and
should be abolished. Although we certainly don't condone the under
handed practices existing in far too many colleges today, we do love
the game and believe it is worth saving.
Almost desperately we searched for a man on a white horse to
champion our cause. Al last we found our man in the poet laureate
of sports writers, the late Grantland Rice. In his book "The Tumult
and the Shouting" he devoted a chapter to his opinion of football.
Chapter 17 of Rice's autobiographical novel is entitled "This Game
of Football, an Appraisal." In our opinion these five readable pages
should be made required reading for every football player and coach.

If a slum exists in (lie heart of a great t-it.v, it is certainly no
scandal to tear it down and rebuild. This is what the Conference
authorities are attempting to do. Instead of being praised for
their sincere actions, they are ridiculed from almost every side.
Little has been written in defense' of football lately. It is easy
to come to the conclusion that the game is a menace to society and
should be abolished. Although we certainly don't condone the under
handed practices existing in far too many colleges today, we do love
the game and believe it is worth saving.
Almost desperately we searched for a man on a white horse to
champion our cause. Al last we found our man in the poet laureate
of sports writers, the late Grantland Rice. In his book "The Tumult
and the Shouting" he devoted a chapter to his opinion of football.
Chapter 17 of Rice's autobiographical novel is entitled "This Game
of Football, an Appraisal." In our opinion these five readable pages
should be made required reading for every football player and coach.
Rice wrote:
"Pressure from alumni and students and criticism from foot
ball writers . . . crowds them into an untenable spot. They're
all supposed In win when only half of them can. They forget
that, entirely! Nothing makes me sorer than to have a coach
say: 'Sure I did it. I broke the rule. But so does every coach
in the country.'
"It has been the idea of too many coaches that the main offense
or penalty in breaking a rule was to be caught. 'If you can get away
with it, fine . . . just don't get caught.' "
If Rice hadn't died before the PCC penalties were assessed, we
would almost believe he was talking directly to a few "highly re
garded" West Coast coaches. Recognize anyone you know? Rice
continued:
"Football, one of the greatest games, can be made greater only
if it is cleaned up and protected. It has taken more punishment than
boxing has and boxing, on the average, doesn't deserve to be men
tioned with any decent sport. Comparatively speaking, football is
in an entirely different setting. It has practically none of the thugs,
crooks, cheaters, hjims and chiselers that boxing knows to a large
degree.
Football is a game. This seems like an absurd statement to
make. But, like all games, football has its rules. If the rules are
not obeyed, then it seems it should logically follow that you are
no longer playing the game. To quote from"The Tumult and
the Shouting" again:
"Football has one glaring weakness. The game is built largely
upon constant rule-breaking such as holding, off-side, backs illegally
in motion, pass interference and other factors that play a big, if
illegal, part in results."
It is impossible to play the game without committing some infrac
tions of the rules. However, intentional rule-breaking is inexcusable.
We agree with Rice that "the game is built for rule-breaking," but
we disagree with him that this is the game's "one glaring weakness."
To us this is the factor that makes the game worth saving. Every
play is a challenge to the player. If a player can be taught to disci
pline himself to play the game according to the rules, even though
an immediate gain and possibly a game-winning touchdown can be
obtained by breaking the rules, he has learned a lesson that will stick
with him the rest of his life.
In (he football trade this lesson is known as "character build
ing." It is a tired old phrase that has suffered much abuse. But
in the long run it is football's most important offering. How
many will remember the Washington State score 25 years from
now?
It is a pity that all coaches don't realize this fact. Despite the
malpractices of a few who have given football such a bad name, the
game has qualities that merit saving. One can only hope that the
good elements in football will be sufficient to overcome its evils,
so that the worthy side of the game will last forever.
"Ami if a house be divided against itself, tiuit house cannot
stand." (Mark iii, 25.)
These may seem like strange words to head a sports* column.
Yet they are ageless words and applicable to many situations. The
Pacific Coast Conference may not be divided, but few will deny that
its structure is weak. Perhaps our nine-tenement house is more like
the one in the current novelty song where the train runs through
the middle.
Like the ill-fated bill collectors in the song, someone forgot to
warn Washington, California, UCLA and Southern California that
the old switchman, Gate Receipts, was letting the Amateur Express
come through this year under a full head of steam.
Literally thousands upon thousands of words have been writ
ten about the severe disciplinary action taken by Coast authori
ties. Never before lias baseball been forced to take such a back
seat to football during the spring and summer months.
The disciplinary action has been called many things. So have the
disciplinarians. One large Southland newspaper ran a long series of
articles written by a Midwestern sports writer who was supposed
to give the objective viewpoint. The paper refers to the whole busi
ness as "the mess."
One Smogland sports columnist constantly refers to the authori
ties who penalized USC and the Bellowing Bruins as "the Foundering
Fathers." The first'time or two he used this expression i't might
have fallen under a classification of witty. That is, if you give the
