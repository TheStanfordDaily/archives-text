# Albert Honored At Half-time... Hall of Fame
## 
### Jack Rannells 
"Albert, a left-footed kicker and
southpaw passer, does about ev
erything at Stanford except blow
the referee's whistle. He kicks
off, punts, calls the plays, passes,
blocks, runs and handles the ball
on almost every play from the
close-behind-center position that
characterizes the Stanford T' for
mation."
These and the following words
appeared in the December 8, 1940,
San Francisco Chronicle story
breaking the news that Frankie
Albert was selected on the Ail-
American eleven.
"The 170 • p i) un d youngster,
whose field generalship amazed
Pacific Coast experts, had never
seen the rather complicated of
fense from the 'T' formation until
Clark Shaughnessy brought it to
Palo Alto last spring. Yet he had
such a command of its possibili
ties that, although faced with
eight various offenses in as many
games, ho solved them all with
scoring plays.
"His daring qualities excite the
imagination of fans. In the South
ern California game, with the
score tied at 7-7 and less than
four minutes to play, he began
tossing the ball around from deep
in his own territory and set off a
charge that sent the Indians 80
yards for a touchdown that kept
their victory string unbroken. He
threw practically all of Stanford's
touchdown passes and did the
kicking after mid-season, averag
ing 52.G yards against Washing
ton."

During halftime of tomorrow's
Michigan State - Stanford football
game Dr. Wallace J. Sterling will
honor, for his selection as Stan
ford University's fourth repre
sentative in the National Football
Hall of Fame, one of the most

unique men ever to don a pair
of shoulder pads.
Frank Cullen Albert, left-hand
ed passer, left-footed kicker and
often criticized as a left-handed
thinker, is the man to be immor
talized in the national football
shrine at Rutgers University.
A halfback on the 1939 Indian
varsity which won but one game,
Frankie was the man chosen by
Clark Shaughnessy to prove that
the "T" formation with flankers,
used exclusively by the Chicago
Bears of that era, could be suc
cessfully exploited by college lads.
So capable was Mr. Albert that
he won All-American honors in
1940 and 1941 and led the Indians

to 1G regular-season victories and
a 2113 triumph in the 1941 Rose
Bowl.
As "Mr. T-Formation," Frankie
spent the war years playing with
the crack service teams at St.
Mary's Pre-Flight. It was during
these years that Albert popular
ized tht "T," making it the rule
rather than the unique in both
pro and collegiate football.
As one of the charter members
of the San Francisco 49ers, Mr.
Albeit was their prime mover as
thoy pioneered the only major
professional sport on the Pacific
Coast. After six seasons, during
one of which he was selected as
All-Pro quarterback, Frankie quit
ihe professional game for busi
ness. This retirement was inter

, rupted by a one-year contract in
the Canadian Football League.
Always a gambler, last winter
Mr. Albert became Head Coach
Albert of the strife-torn 49ers—
this despite his 36 years and the
fact that he had never acted in
the capacity of a head coach. He
is staking the knowledge gained
in 12 years as "coach on the field"
and his knowledge of players'
whims against the general con
sensus that the 49ers are "no
where" in the pro football world.
Representatives of Stanford
previously honored with selection
to the Hall of Fame are Ernest A.
Nevers, fullback, 1923-25; Glenn
S. Warner, head coach, 1924-32,
and Robert H. Grayson, fullback,
1933-35.

Mr. Albert became Head Coach
Albert of the strife-torn 49ers—
this despite his 36 years and the
fact that he had never acted in
the capacity of a head coach. He
is staking the knowledge gained
in 12 years as "coach on the field"

whims against the general con
sensus that the 49ers are "no

FRANKIE ALBERT
To the llall of Fame
"Albert, a left-footed kicker and
southpaw passer, does about ev
erything at Stanford except blow
the referee's whistle. He kicks
off, punts, calls the plays, passes,
blocks, runs and handles the ball
on almost every play from the
close-behind-center position that
characterizes the Stanford T' for
mation."
These and the following words
appeared in the December 8, 1940,
San Francisco Chronicle story
breaking the news that Frankie
Albert was selected on the Ail-
American eleven.
"The 170 • p i) un d youngster,
whose field generalship amazed
Pacific Coast experts, had never
seen the rather complicated of
fense from the 'T' formation until
Clark Shaughnessy brought it to
Palo Alto last spring. Yet he had
such a command of its possibili
ties that, although faced with
eight various offenses in as many
games, ho solved them all with
scoring plays.
"His daring qualities excite the
imagination of fans. In the South
ern California game, with the
score tied at 7-7 and less than
four minutes to play, he began
tossing the ball around from deep
in his own territory and set off a
charge that sent the Indians 80
yards for a touchdown that kept
their victory string unbroken. He
threw practically all of Stanford's
touchdown passes and did the
kicking after mid-season, averag
ing 52.G yards against Washing
ton."

Frank Cullen Albert, left-hand
ed passer, left-footed kicker and
often criticized as a left-handed
thinker, is the man to be immor
talized in the national football
shrine at Rutgers University.
A halfback on the 1939 Indian
varsity which won but one game,
Frankie was the man chosen by
Clark Shaughnessy to prove that
the "T" formation with flankers,
used exclusively by the Chicago
Bears of that era, could be suc
cessfully exploited by college lads.
So capable was Mr. Albert that
he won All-American honors in
1940 and 1941 and led the Indians

to 1G regular-season victories and
a 2113 triumph in the 1941 Rose
Bowl.
As "Mr. T-Formation," Frankie
spent the war years playing with
the crack service teams at St.
Mary's Pre-Flight. It was during
these years that Albert popular
ized tht "T," making it the rule
rather than the unique in both
pro and collegiate football.
As one of the charter members
of the San Francisco 49ers, Mr.
Albeit was their prime mover as
thoy pioneered the only major
