Stanford's new coach, along with his frosh mentor and assistant
Floyd Strain, broadly outlined the program for the autumn quarter

and told the prospective team
members of his coaching philoso
phy.
"I ask no man to win for win
ning's sake alone," said Jordan.
"I ask just one thing: that after |
a man has walked off the field, !
showered, dressed and left, he \
can hold his head up and know
he did his level best all the time." I
Jordan stressed that this atti- [
tude was not only necessary at:
meet-time, but must also be car
ried out in practice.
Jordan also said that he would
n't predict the outcome of the
spring meets, but that "hard I
work and desire will make Stan
ford University one of the tough
est teams."
A rugged schedule has been
set up for the Indian spikemen.
