Stanford's "new look" may not ho quite the same as Dior's, but
it will make its debut at tonight s Michigan State rally when now
song leaders, in new costumes with new routines, appear before the
student body.
Reasons for these changes, according 1o head song leader Jackie

i-»evn, are mainly the many com
plaints heard in past years lhat
Stanford's pompon girls were not
keeping up with those of other
schools in the Pacific Coast
League.
For the first time, try-outs were
open to girls in all four classes.
Although the activity is sponsor
ed by Rally committee, try-outs
were not limited to Rally Com
members.
Judges for Ihe try-outs consist
ed of representatives* from Rally
committee, ASSU, AWS, Cardi
nals, faculty and yell leaders.
"Final selections were made
Wednesday evening," Jackie Levit
said, "so the five new girls have
been rushing to alter their new
costumes and make up some new,
lively routines."
The song leaders' outfits will
be red corduroy with white trim.
New all-white pompons have been
ordered, but will not be here for
tonight's rally. The costumes
were designed especially for Stan
ford by a Los Angeles firm.
Working out new dance-type
routines are the five sophomores
chosen as song leaders Joan Rol
ling, Deanna Amos, Sally Wolfe,
Maureen O'Brien and Linda Play
er and chairman .Tackio Levit.
"Rally committee appreciated
I tho large turn-out for the try
outs," Jackie Levit said. Abcrut
j 10 girls were present.
The song leaders will be work
ing closely with the hand and yell
leaders, leading songs and yells
at rallies and games all season.
They plan to be at all home games
and tho UCLA gpme at the Coli
seum in Los Angeles.
"We hope," Jackie Levit said,
"that we'll he at Ihe Rose Howl
game, too. If Stanford goes to
1 the Rose Bowl, we'll be there!"
