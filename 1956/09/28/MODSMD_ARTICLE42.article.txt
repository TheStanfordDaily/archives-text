# Libe Opens 2 New Major Divisions
## 
### 
Library reorganization took
place with the beginning of this
academic year by combining four
of the Library's major divisions
into two new ones.
The new Science Division, of
which Frederic M. Falconer is
chief and Mary Knights, assist
ant chief, replaces the old Science
and Engineering and the Biologi
cal Science divisions.
The Reference and Humanities
Division and the Social Science
Division will be combined to form
the Humanities and Social Sci
ences Division, whose chief is Jo
seph A. Belloli and assistant
chief is Jack Plotkin.
The first of these consolida
tions is pointed toward long
range plans for a unified science
library. The second brings to
gether under one head the refer
ence services in the humanities
and social sciences, integrating
the Document Library and the
Education Library more closely
into the administrative structure
of the Library.
It in no way detracts from
plans to establish separate Social
Sciences and Humanities rooms
for which preliminary plans are
advancing under Belloli's guid
ance.
