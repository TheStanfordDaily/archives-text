# Six Students Arrested at Rudy's Inn
## ABC Cracking Down on Liquor Violations 
### 
Six Stanford students arrested'
on liquor charges in two raids on
Rudy's Alpine Ir.n are scheduled
to be booked in Santa Clara Coun
ty Court at 10 a.m. Monday.
University officials hope the
Alcoholic Beverage Commission
will turn the cases over to Stan
ford and the Men's and Women's
Councils before the scheduled
booking.
In the past, according to Wil
liam Craig, Dean of Men, the ABC
has made it a policy to turn such
cases over to the University. Such
action is solely up to the discre
tion of the ABC, and decision as
to their fate rests with the ABC
and the District Attorney.
Possible Decision
Craig, Frank Fullenwider, area
administrator for the ABC, and
the county District Attorney are
scheduled to have a meeting this
afternoon at 3 p.m., at % which time
a decision may be made.
II. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students, explained that the ABC
has boon willing to turn student
liquor violations over to Stanford,
"because it had the highest con
fidence in the student judicial
system. By turning it over to the
students, it brought the violations
to the attention of the students
and had an educational effect.
And the educational effect of the
violation publicity was much
more valuable than the actual
punitive measures that would
have been taken against the stu
dents in a regular court."
Early Crackdown
Both deans agreed that the rea
son for the present crackdown so
early in the quarter is to show
the students that the ABC means
business this year in its enforce
ment of the liquor laws.
The first group of students—
Lois Mace, Gerald Bricca and Je
rome Reinhart were arrested
Tuesday on charges of illegally
buying alcoholic beverages and
were released on $50 bail. Rich
ard Newman, a bartender, was
charged with selling beer to mi
nors and was released on $100
bail.
Three more students -Stephen
Fender, George Ellis and Jack
Newquist were arrested Wed
nesday. Fender and Ellis were
arrested for illegally purchasing
alcoholic beverages and were re
leaser! on $50 bail. Newquist, who
also serves as a part-lime bar
tender at Rudy's, was booked for
selling beer to minors and was
released on $100 bail.
Bartender to Be Prosecuted
The bartender, according to
Fullenwider, will definitely be
prosecuted criminally. "Anytime
a student steps behind a counter
and operates as a private business
man selling beer to minors, then
he no longer falls under the pro
tection given a student."
He said that action would be
taken against Rudy's, "a rendez
vous for Stanford students for
many years." The beer and wine
license for the tavern is held by
Elisabeth Hubner. "We hope for
a heavier penalty than was given
Rossotti's Beer Garden last year.
Suspended Sentence
"Rossotti's was given a 15-day
suspended sentence for - serving
beer to minors. The suspension
is now up before an appeal court,
and, if the appeal is ignored, the
suspension will take effect Oct. S.
"I also understand," Fullenwi
der added, "that another all-cam
pus gathering is scheduled to take
place at Rudy's Friday. If that
rally is carried out, it will be the
most carefully policed party in
Stanford's history. Now that they
have been warned, minors will
not he treated with a great deal
of sympathy."

liam Craig, Dean of Men, the ABC
has made it a policy to turn such
cases over to the University. Such
action is solely up to the discre
tion of the ABC, and decision as
to their fate rests with the ABC
and the District Attorney.
Possible Decision
Craig, Frank Fullenwider, area
administrator for the ABC, and
the county District Attorney are
scheduled to have a meeting this
afternoon at 3 p.m., at % which time
a decision may be made.
II. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students, explained that the ABC
has boon willing to turn student
liquor violations over to Stanford,
"because it had the highest con
fidence in the student judicial
system. By turning it over to the
students, it brought the violations
to the attention of the students
and had an educational effect.
And the educational effect of the
violation publicity was much
more valuable than the actual
punitive measures that would
have been taken against the stu
dents in a regular court."
Early Crackdown
Both deans agreed that the rea
son for the present crackdown so
early in the quarter is to show
the students that the ABC means
business this year in its enforce
ment of the liquor laws.
The first group of students—
Lois Mace, Gerald Bricca and Je
rome Reinhart were arrested
Tuesday on charges of illegally
buying alcoholic beverages and
were released on $50 bail. Rich
ard Newman, a bartender, was
charged with selling beer to mi
nors and was released on $100
bail.
Three more students -Stephen
Fender, George Ellis and Jack
Newquist were arrested Wed
nesday. Fender and Ellis were
arrested for illegally purchasing
alcoholic beverages and were re
leaser! on $50 bail. Newquist, who
also serves as a part-lime bar
tender at Rudy's, was booked for
selling beer to minors and was
released on $100 bail.
Bartender to Be Prosecuted
The bartender, according to
Fullenwider, will definitely be
prosecuted criminally. "Anytime
a student steps behind a counter
and operates as a private business
man selling beer to minors, then
he no longer falls under the pro
tection given a student."
He said that action would be
taken against Rudy's, "a rendez
vous for Stanford students for
many years." The beer and wine
license for the tavern is held by
Elisabeth Hubner. "We hope for
a heavier penalty than was given
Rossotti's Beer Garden last year.
Suspended Sentence
"Rossotti's was given a 15-day
suspended sentence for - serving
beer to minors. The suspension
is now up before an appeal court,
and, if the appeal is ignored, the
suspension will take effect Oct. S.
"I also understand," Fullenwi
der added, "that another all-cam
pus gathering is scheduled to take
place at Rudy's Friday. If that
rally is carried out, it will be the
most carefully policed party in
Stanford's history. Now that they
have been warned, minors will
not he treated with a great deal
of sympathy."
Six Stanford students arrested'
on liquor charges in two raids on
Rudy's Alpine Ir.n are scheduled
to be booked in Santa Clara Coun
ty Court at 10 a.m. Monday.
University officials hope the
Alcoholic Beverage Commission
will turn the cases over to Stan
ford and the Men's and Women's
Councils before the scheduled
booking.
In the past, according to Wil
liam Craig, Dean of Men, the ABC
has made it a policy to turn such
cases over to the University. Such
action is solely up to the discre
tion of the ABC, and decision as
