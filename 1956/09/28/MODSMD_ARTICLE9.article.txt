# Time Change Due Sunday
## 
### 
Siin(l a y morning w : ll be
around in a couple of days, and,
with it, one more hour's sleep.
In other words, Daylight Sav
ing Time will end for the win
ter here in California Sunday.
Two a.m. is the time. At 2
a.m. it will he 1 a.m. Therefore
one hour later it will be 2 a.m.
So when you get up at 7,
don't.
It is only 6 and you should
be in bed.
Don't worry too much if you
find yourself alone in church
Sunday morning. It is probably
only 7 and your classmates are
just having breakfast.
