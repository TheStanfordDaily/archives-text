# Construction Begins in November on $440,000 Physics Lecture Building
## 
### 
Construction of Stanford's
physics lecture building is
scheduled to begin in Novem
ber.
Bids are now being taken for
the building, the estimated total
cost of which will be approxi
mately $440,000.
The structure will be circular
in shape and will enclose a 300-
seat auditorium. Radial wings,
extending from the sides and
rear, will provide a 150-seat lec
ture room, three seminar rooms
and an office.
Located across Lomita Drive
from the University's main
quadrangle, the hall will even
tually be the center of a new
science building quad. •
In the future a portion of Lo

mita Drive will be closed so that
a pedestrian walk-way can be
made between the main build
ings and the science area.
Funds are provided by the
University's royalties on the
klystron, the world'.s most pow
erful vacuum tube. Invented by
Stanford physicists before
World War 11, the tube became
the heart of radar and now is
widely manufactured for the
communications industry.
Plans are also being made to
construct a 1900 - square • foot
room for the preparation of
experimental demonstrations
which will join the auditorium.
The room will include a small
shop.
Gardner A. Dailey of San

Francisco, a Stanford alumnus,
is the architect. Eldridge T.
Spencer, Stanford's director of
planning, is supervising archi
tect.
"The physics lecture building
is designed to complement the
original quadrangle buildings in
architectural form and to carry
out the color of the stone build
ings," Spencer said.
"Other buildings in the sci
ence group will be designed
with the traditional red - tile
roofs, in rectangular form, and
also will retain the characteris
tic stone color. The entire com
position will be less formal than
the main quadrangles but com

plementary in scale and de
sign." he continued.
The estimated budget of $440,-
000 includes furnishings, land
scaping and off-site utility work,
in addition to the building con
tract.
Preliminary plans call for
covered arcades to lead from the
front of the physics hall around
to the outside wings. Large oak
and eucalyptus trees will shade
the site.
Both the lecture and experi
ment buildings will be equipped
with a beam at ceiling height
for suspending pendulum, im
pact and other experimental do
vices. The demonstrator will
work from a gallery reached by
a circular staircase.

"The physics lecture building
is designed to complement the
original quadrangle buildings in
architectural form and to carry
out the color of the stone build
ings," Spencer said.
"Other buildings in the sci
ence group will be designed
with the traditional red - tile
roofs, in rectangular form, and
also will retain the characteris
tic stone color. The entire com
position will be less formal than
the main quadrangles but com

plementary in scale and de
sign." he continued.
The estimated budget of $440,-
000 includes furnishings, land
scaping and off-site utility work,
in addition to the building con
tract.
Preliminary plans call for
covered arcades to lead from the
front of the physics hall around
to the outside wings. Large oak
and eucalyptus trees will shade
the site.
Both the lecture and experi
ment buildings will be equipped
with a beam at ceiling height
for suspending pendulum, im
pact and other experimental do
vices. The demonstrator will
work from a gallery reached by
a circular staircase.

Construction of Stanford's
physics lecture building is
scheduled to begin in Novem
ber.
Bids are now being taken for
the building, the estimated total
cost of which will be approxi
mately $440,000.
The structure will be circular
in shape and will enclose a 300-
seat auditorium. Radial wings,
extending from the sides and
rear, will provide a 150-seat lec
ture room, three seminar rooms
and an office.
Located across Lomita Drive
from the University's main
quadrangle, the hall will even
tually be the center of a new
science building quad. •
In the future a portion of Lo

mita Drive will be closed so that
a pedestrian walk-way can be
made between the main build
ings and the science area.
Funds are provided by the
University's royalties on the
klystron, the world'.s most pow
erful vacuum tube. Invented by
Stanford physicists before
World War 11, the tube became
the heart of radar and now is
widely manufactured for the
communications industry.
Plans are also being made to
construct a 1900 - square • foot
room for the preparation of
experimental demonstrations
which will join the auditorium.
The room will include a small
shop.
