I ers dented a little but otherwise

Stanford's best season since the
Rose Bowl year of 1951.
Saturday's c on t e s t with top
ranked Michigan Stale was occa

that of the "new look" pompon
girls, and that of a little left
hander named Frankie as a full

The five young lovelies with
the new look opened the proceed

field under the discerning eyes of
most of the males in the crowd
of 55,000 who braved the early
autumn heat, 15-cent cokes and
innumerable road barriers to see
the giant of the Big Ten tackle

"New Look" Oolls
The verdict on the "new look"
dolls appeared to read: "Same
old routines . . . hut a little more
anatomy." They were a rather
inspiring sight at that. Pretty

Baby-faced Frankie Albert
strode to the center of the grid
iron where he once thrilled thou
sands and shyly accepted a
plaque from President Wallace
Sterling signifying the little field
1 general's niche in the National
Football Hall of Fame.
Albert, All - American quarter
back at Stanford in 1940 and '41,
was characterized by Los Ange
les Times sports editor Paul Zim
mermann as "a left-hander—but
j one who thinks right-handed."
Acceptance
Albert's acceptance was brief.
"I shall always be greatly indebt
ed to Stanford University, Clark
jShaughnessy and to the T-forma
! lion," he said.
The 90 - degree heat and the
] scoreboard kept the crowd rela
tively calm and collected, if not
cool. Quarterback John Brodie,
lifting a page from Albert's book,
kept fans on the edge of their
seats throughout the first half
with his daring play.
From the roll call of visiting
firemen it was evident that the
game was'a big one. Locally, the
I San Francisco Chronicle sent out
all of its big guns: Leiser, Con
nolly, Friendlich, Rosenbaum, et
al. Two other visitors just about

Another All-American
Albert sat with Bones Hamil
ton, who was a Stanford All-
American halfback in the 1934-35
Vow Boy days.
As the game ended and the
band and Prince Light foot trot
ted off the field, a slightly-gray
ing ex-quarterback who took his
Indians to greatness some lfi
years ago watched the youngster
who may follow his footsteps
signing autographs for a horde

never heard of Stanford's num

LOOSE BALL —Stanford's reserve end, Bob Ger

quarter as Michigan State's Clarence Peaks (26)
rushes in to halt play. It was Peaks' punt which

was blocked by Indian center Roch Conklin in
the intersectional won by the Spartans, 21 to 7.
