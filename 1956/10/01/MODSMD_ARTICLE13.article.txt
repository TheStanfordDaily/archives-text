### 
Brevity, smoothness and care
ful humor characterized Stan
ford's first full-scale football rally
of the year Friday night in front
of ivicci Roble Hall.
Head Yell Leader Bill Duke
sent the large crowd of student
rooters through the traditional
yells in snappy order, spicing the
program with band tunes, pom
pon girls and an occasional bit of
wit.
Making a dubious return to the
! Stanford campus was a sequel to
j last year's now-famous anecdote
i concerning a farmer and a sow.
Duke's version was received with
noticeably less response than the
I controversial tale did last year.
Freshman women were reported
| to he unoffended.
The newly designed costumes
| for the pompon gals were re
ceived with apparent interest as
Stanford roughs in the crowd
I moved in closer for better vision.
! An air of begrudging approval
was definitely present.
Cheers came through loud and
i clear, although unfamiliar to
some and in a changed form for
I others. The new double-locomo
tive yell gave indication it would
; soon take its place with the old
| standbys.
Star of the show was quite nat
' urally Coach Chuck Taylor, who
introduced the team and gave the
crowd a bit of the optimism he
perennially exhibits.
