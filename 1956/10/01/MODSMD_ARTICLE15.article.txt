# Taylor Says Team Fell to Nation's Best
## 21-7 Defeat Features Battle Between State Running, SU Passing 
### Jerry Kelly Sports Editor 
A powerful, ball-controlling
Michigan State eleven, probably
the nation's best, literally ran
over a game, spirited Stanford
team Saturday, 21 to 7.
Despite the defeat Coach Chuck
Taylor, his staff and his players
were not overly disappointed and
immediately began plans to "got
Ohio State" this week at Colum
bus.
"I was pleased with our team's
performance; sure we hate to
lose, but we learned a great deal
and the team played their hearts
out," Taylor said. ' 'We lost to
the nation's top team; it's our last
defeat this season."
Top Big Ten Team
If Michigan State is the top
representative in the Big Ten this
year, the Indians will he up
against the second best next Sat
urday when Stanford clashes with
Ohio State. Undefeated in Rig
Ten action last season, the Buck
eyes lost to the Cards here, 6 to 0;
an unforgettable game OSU will
attempt to avenge.
Last. Saturday's game against
the Rose Bowl champs can best
be classified as a hard-fought bat
tle featuring a bulldozing Spartan
ground attack against Stanford's
aerial maneuvers.
Brilliant Passing
The Indians' brilliant passing
quarterback, John Brodie, instru
mental in engineering Stanford's
second-quarter touchdown which
tied the count, 7 to 7, at half time,
saw little action in the second
half. The inspirational field gon
eral was shaken up severely and
suffered from exhaustion after
the bone-twisting Card TD drive
before the first half ended.
Whether or not Brodie could
have turned the tide after Michi
gan State rallied for a pair of
touchdowns in the third period is
a matter of speculation. Most of
the 55,000 sundrenched fans .'t
Stanford Stadium were convinced
that the Spartan outfit was in
vincible.
Bruising defensive efforts by
both teams highlighted the inter
sectional headliner, although four
TD's were registered. The Indian
defenders, using a Taylor-made
multiple defense to stop MSU's
running game, kept the two out
standing State halfbacks, Clar
ence Peaks and Walt Kowalczyk,
in camp.
A host of Spartan backs packed
the leather on 66 occasions for
net ground yardage of 223 yards,
only 3.4 yards a carry. On three
occasions the Indian forward wall
forced State to a fourth-and-one
situation. In all, the slow, delib
erate tactics employed by Michi
gan State gave Stanford little
time to move offensively.
Michigan State first entered the
scoring column late in the first
quarter. The ground - pounding
Spartans drove 65 yards in 34
plays, 13 with runs, for the score.
"Ili" Peaks, a triple-threat Ail-
American candidate, plowed over
for the counter from 2 yards out
on a fourth-down-and-inches situ
ation.
Matsko Halts Drive '
Runs by Peaks, Kowalczyk, full
back Don Gilbert and a Pat Wil
son-to-Tony Kolodziej pass ac
counted for the long drive.
Stanford reached Michigan's 42-
yard line after the opening kick
off. but a pass interception by
State's captain and center, John
Matsko. halted the drive. Brodie
passed to Camera for 10, and runs
by fullback Lou Valli and Gordy
Young started the ball rolling for
Stanford.
With Brodie displaying excel
lence, Stanford moved 80 yards in
20 plays to knot the score midway
in the second period.
Passing and running as though i
his life depended on a faultless
performance, Brodie set the j
crowd in a frenzy with a fourth !
down, 2-yard touchdown pass that i
put the Spartans on their heels.
First and goal to go on the
MSU 4, Stanford gained 2 yards
in three attempts against the
stubborn State line. On the scor- \
ing play Brodie leaped into the
air on a pass-option, saw the mid
dle of the line jammed, turned to 1
his left and flipped the leather
1o Lou Valli, who was jaunting |
across the goal stripe.
Gilbert Scores
The stage was set for real bat- i
tie when the two teams came to
Ihe field for Ihe second half with
the score knotted at 7-alI. Daugh- i
erty must have issued the correct
commands, for his Spartans
charged with determination 68
yards after receiving the kick-off.
Wilson, mixing line plays and j
gaining effectively on the sneak-1
er, pushed his troopers to five'
quick first downs. After nine
minutes of spine - tingling line
plunges which tore the spirit out i
of Indian limbs, Gilbert dove over j

the goal line for the game-win-!
ning tally.
End Dave Kaiser kicked his I
second of three extra points.
A Stanford fumble, recovered i
by the alert Staters, gave the I
Spartans an insurance TD. Russ
Kelly grabbed Young's bobble on I
the 18, and six plays later Jim
Wulff, a reserve halfback capable |
of making most starting lineups, i
hit left guard from 2 yards out
for the final tally.

A powerful, ball-controlling

team Saturday, 21 to 7.
Despite the defeat Coach Chuck
Taylor, his staff and his players
were not overly disappointed and

Top Big Ten Team
If Michigan State is the top
representative in the Big Ten this
year, the Indians will he up
against the second best next Sat
urday when Stanford clashes with
Ohio State. Undefeated in Rig
Ten action last season, the Buck
eyes lost to the Cards here, 6 to 0;
an unforgettable game OSU will
attempt to avenge.
Last. Saturday's game against
the Rose Bowl champs can best
be classified as a hard-fought bat
tle featuring a bulldozing Spartan
ground attack against Stanford's
aerial maneuvers.
Brilliant Passing
The Indians' brilliant passing
quarterback, John Brodie, instru
mental in engineering Stanford's
second-quarter touchdown which
tied the count, 7 to 7, at half time,
saw little action in the second
half. The inspirational field gon
eral was shaken up severely and
suffered from exhaustion after
the bone-twisting Card TD drive
before the first half ended.
Whether or not Brodie could
have turned the tide after Michi
gan State rallied for a pair of
touchdowns in the third period is
a matter of speculation. Most of
the 55,000 sundrenched fans .'t
Stanford Stadium were convinced
that the Spartan outfit was in
vincible.
Bruising defensive efforts by
both teams highlighted the inter
sectional headliner, although four
TD's were registered. The Indian
defenders, using a Taylor-made
multiple defense to stop MSU's
running game, kept the two out
standing State halfbacks, Clar
ence Peaks and Walt Kowalczyk,
in camp.
A host of Spartan backs packed
the leather on 66 occasions for
net ground yardage of 223 yards,
only 3.4 yards a carry. On three
occasions the Indian forward wall
forced State to a fourth-and-one
situation. In all, the slow, delib
erate tactics employed by Michi
gan State gave Stanford little
time to move offensively.
Michigan State first entered the
scoring column late in the first
quarter. The ground - pounding
Spartans drove 65 yards in 34
plays, 13 with runs, for the score.
"Ili" Peaks, a triple-threat Ail-
American candidate, plowed over
for the counter from 2 yards out
on a fourth-down-and-inches situ
ation.

off. but a pass interception by
State's captain and center, John
Matsko. halted the drive. Brodie

by fullback Lou Valli and Gordy
Young started the ball rolling for
Stanford.
With Brodie displaying excel
lence, Stanford moved 80 yards in
20 plays to knot the score midway
in the second period.
Passing and running as though i
his life depended on a faultless
performance, Brodie set the j
crowd in a frenzy with a fourth !
down, 2-yard touchdown pass that i
put the Spartans on their heels.
First and goal to go on the

Michigan State first entered the
scoring column late in the first
quarter. The ground - pounding
Spartans drove 65 yards in 34
plays, 13 with runs, for the score.
"Ili" Peaks, a triple-threat Ail-
American candidate, plowed over

on a fourth-down-and-inches situ
ation.
Matsko Halts Drive '
Runs by Peaks, Kowalczyk, full
back Don Gilbert and a Pat Wil

counted for the long drive.
Stanford reached Michigan's 42-
yard line after the opening kick
off. but a pass interception by
State's captain and center, John
Matsko. halted the drive. Brodie
passed to Camera for 10, and runs
by fullback Lou Valli and Gordy
Young started the ball rolling for
Stanford.
With Brodie displaying excel
lence, Stanford moved 80 yards in
20 plays to knot the score midway
in the second period.
Passing and running as though i
his life depended on a faultless
performance, Brodie set the j
crowd in a frenzy with a fourth !
down, 2-yard touchdown pass that i
put the Spartans on their heels.
First and goal to go on the
MSU 4, Stanford gained 2 yards
in three attempts against the
stubborn State line. On the scor- \
ing play Brodie leaped into the
air on a pass-option, saw the mid
dle of the line jammed, turned to 1
his left and flipped the leather
1o Lou Valli, who was jaunting |
across the goal stripe.
Gilbert Scores
The stage was set for real bat- i
tie when the two teams came to
Ihe field for Ihe second half with
the score knotted at 7-alI. Daugh- i
erty must have issued the correct
commands, for his Spartans
charged with determination 68
yards after receiving the kick-off.
Wilson, mixing line plays and j
gaining effectively on the sneak-1
er, pushed his troopers to five'
quick first downs. After nine
minutes of spine - tingling line
plunges which tore the spirit out i
of Indian limbs, Gilbert dove over j

the goal line for the game-win-!
ning tally.
End Dave Kaiser kicked his I
second of three extra points.
A Stanford fumble, recovered i
by the alert Staters, gave the I
Spartans an insurance TD. Russ
Kelly grabbed Young's bobble on I
the 18, and six plays later Jim
Wulff, a reserve halfback capable |

hit left guard from 2 yards out
for the final tally.

A powerful, ball-controlling
Michigan State eleven, probably
the nation's best, literally ran
over a game, spirited Stanford
team Saturday, 21 to 7.
Despite the defeat Coach Chuck
Taylor, his staff and his players
were not overly disappointed and
immediately began plans to "got
Ohio State" this week at Colum
bus.
"I was pleased with our team's
performance; sure we hate to
lose, but we learned a great deal
and the team played their hearts
out," Taylor said. ' 'We lost to
the nation's top team; it's our last
defeat this season."
Top Big Ten Team
If Michigan State is the top
representative in the Big Ten this
year, the Indians will he up
against the second best next Sat
urday when Stanford clashes with
Ohio State. Undefeated in Rig
Ten action last season, the Buck
eyes lost to the Cards here, 6 to 0;
an unforgettable game OSU will
attempt to avenge.
Last. Saturday's game against
the Rose Bowl champs can best
be classified as a hard-fought bat
tle featuring a bulldozing Spartan
ground attack against Stanford's
aerial maneuvers.
Brilliant Passing
The Indians' brilliant passing
quarterback, John Brodie, instru
mental in engineering Stanford's
second-quarter touchdown which
tied the count, 7 to 7, at half time,
saw little action in the second
half. The inspirational field gon
eral was shaken up severely and
suffered from exhaustion after
the bone-twisting Card TD drive
before the first half ended.
Whether or not Brodie could
have turned the tide after Michi
gan State rallied for a pair of
touchdowns in the third period is
a matter of speculation. Most of
the 55,000 sundrenched fans .'t
Stanford Stadium were convinced
that the Spartan outfit was in
vincible.
Bruising defensive efforts by
both teams highlighted the inter
sectional headliner, although four
TD's were registered. The Indian
defenders, using a Taylor-made
multiple defense to stop MSU's
running game, kept the two out
standing State halfbacks, Clar
ence Peaks and Walt Kowalczyk,
in camp.
A host of Spartan backs packed
the leather on 66 occasions for
net ground yardage of 223 yards,
only 3.4 yards a carry. On three
occasions the Indian forward wall
forced State to a fourth-and-one
situation. In all, the slow, delib
erate tactics employed by Michi
gan State gave Stanford little
time to move offensively.
