# No Overwhelming Defeat
## 
### 
Stanford i.ost to what may be the best foot
ball team in the nation Saturday, but it was
no overwhelming defeat.
Coach Duffy Dauglierty of the Michigan
State Spartans told the press that on a given
day Stanford could beat any team in the coun
try. On its drive to its second touchdown in
the third quarter Michigan State* was forced
to go to third down three times.
It was a Stanford team that never gave up,
even when it was obvious the Spartans had
just too many horses for a more tliinly-manned
Stanford squad.
Chuck Taylor can still point to a team with
two possible All-Americans, quarterback John
Brodie ami tackle Paul Wiggin. And it is a
team that is favored by almost everybody to
finish in top position in the Pacific Coast Con
ference.
Since he came to Stanford in 1951 to take
over the coaching reigns at Stanford, Taylor
has had only one losing season, that in 1954.
So Stanford rooters should have more good
football in store for future years.
In general the rooting section Saturday, de
spite the fact it was sitting in heat comparable
to the Sahara Desert, well reflected the spirit,
shown by the Stanford team.
Head \ell Leader Bill Duke did not have to
work hard to get the men's section to throw
their vocal support behind the team. And
conduct of the section compared favorably to
our brothers across the bay who are supposedly
integrated with the women now.
At any rate rooters have many good foot

ball games to look forward to tliis year at Stan
ford Stadium. After this week's trip to Ohio
State, Stanford will meet Bob Bronzan's im
proved San Jose State Spartans Oct. 13.
On Oct. 27 the Indians will engage the USC
Trojans in what is slated to be the greatest
grudge match of the year. At stake undoubt
edly will be the PCC title.
The Trojans are all pointing to avenge their
PCC penalty on Stanford and its president,
Wallace Sterling, who was the only PCC presi
dent who expressed the emphatic belief that
the PCC rules had a meaning and should be
enforced.
After a Nov. 3 expedition down to the South
land and UCLA, the Indians take on the Ore
gon State Beavers, the team that finished sec
ond with a green squad last year, on Nov. 10.
On Nov. 13 the Washington Huskies, whose
controversy with last year's coach Johnny Cher
berg blew the whole PCC mess wide open, will
encounter the Indians at Stanford.
Stanford rooters will have to cut their
'I hanksgiving vacation short if they wish to
see the granddaddy of them all, the Big Game
at Berkeley on Nov. 24. Pappy Waldorf's boys
gave powerful Illinois a big scare before hand
ing them the game last week, 32 to 20.
And then maybe Taylor's team might go on
to another game around holiday time, but it
is too early to start mentioning this. As Taylor
says, let's take each one of them as we come
to them.
Hut it could be a great year.
