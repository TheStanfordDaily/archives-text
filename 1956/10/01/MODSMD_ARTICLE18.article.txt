## The 						New Songleaders 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Last week a panel of judges representing a
broad cross-section of Stanford life selected five
girls who, with head song leader Jackie Levit,
will serve as song leaders for the coming year.
Although those trying out were slightly fewer
in number than in previous years, their quality

was so high as to make the selection of five an
almost impossible task.
We would like to extend our sincere thanks
to the 32 girls who did try out, both for their
interest and their enthusiasm, and encourage
them to try out again next year.
