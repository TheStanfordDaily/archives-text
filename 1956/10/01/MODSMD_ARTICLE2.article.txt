The Egyptian delegation which
will argue the case at the U.N.
will be led by Foreign Minister
Mahmoud Fawzi and will include
wing commander Aly Sabri, Nas
ser's political adviser. The group
leaves tomorrow.
• Russia announced that one of
Egypt's chief supporters, Soviet
Foreign Minister Dmitri T. Shepi
lov, will leave for the council de
bate within a few days. It will
be his first visit to the United
i States since he succeeded Yvach
eslav M. Molotov in the post last
j June.
Britain and France assume that
Soviet vetoes in favor of Egypt
will prevent the council from set-
I tling the Suez dispute, and so plan
! to have the SCUA in action within
I two weeks.
Conference Tomorrow
The conference tomorrow at
Lancaster House will not bind
the attending nations into the as
sociation. First order of business
will be to have the attending am
bassadors deliver their govern
ments' decisions.
Britain and France, which want
a strong association to confront
Nasser with a solid Western bloc,
took the issue to the U.N. as a
danger to peace. The United
States disagreed with the timing
of the appeal. Egypt countered
with a U.N. complaint accusing
Britain and France of hostile acts
endangering the peace. Both
charges will be acted on in the
council.
