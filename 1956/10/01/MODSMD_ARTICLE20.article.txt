# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Earl Cilley
## It's a Week Full of Culture, Jazz and Olympian Togas 
### 
It's autumn, the sun is shining, across the land football is king
on America's campuses, and campaign oratory is whipping the pop
ulace into a fever of excitement as the critical days before the elec
tion draw ever closer. Here at Stanford, as we start another wt >k,
Bill Duke and his ne'er-do-wells are planning to picket the Cellar
over the price of coffee.
Locally, the calendar is a pleasant mixture of com-com tryouts
and cultural events. Tonight, for instance, is the last night you can
try out for Ram's Head's annual extravaganza. Big Game Gaieties.
If you can whistle, stomp, or do dramatic readings, or if you like
to work behind the scenes, you are invited to drop by Memorial Au
ditorium between 7:30 and 10.
If things electronic get you all in a glow, you should be very
interested in tonight's Radio Club meeting. Dr. Allen M. Peterson
will talk on "The Role of the Radio Amateur in the Forthcoming
International Geophysical Year." This is the big scientific coopera
tive shot which will send everybody who matters off to the Antarctic
to measure things and count stuff. It's a very important, far-reach
ing sort of a deal, and if you want to know more, plan to be in the
meeting room at Crothers Memorial at 7.
Tuesday evening marks the opening of the Committee on Public
Exercises' autumn series of programs of general interest. This week
James R. Sutherland, Professor of Modern English at London Uni
versity, will lecture on "The Nature of Satire" in Mem Aud at 7:30.
The public is very much invited, as are you.
Friday is Olympic Day, with the usual parade and race to Rudy's
by sheet-wound and rebellious campus luminaries, followed by an
impressive and touching rite behind Mangini's Barn. Ah, there's
nothing like Stanford in the fall.

Friday night will be a tough one for those who are hot for short
haired musical events. "Fatha" Hines, Cal Tjader, Brew Moore and
Vince Guaraldi will appear in a Modern Jazz Festival to benefit the
Scholarship Fund. Mem Aud, 8, tickets $2, $2.50 and $3. Or, if you
prefer a competent retailer of ballads and banjo music, try Pete
Seeger, who is giving a concert in Paly High School Auditorium at
8:15. Tickets for Pete cost $1.25. Buy them for Hines & Co. at Mem
Aud Box Office, for Seeger at Hage's. Too bad they conflict, but
life is like that.
Sunday night is Flicks time at Mem Aud, and this week it's Mr.
Gary Cooper in a high tragedy with a hopeful note entitled "The
Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell." Technicolor, plus one cartoon, one
short and all for the quarter part of a dollar. Step light up, curtain
time is 7:30.
