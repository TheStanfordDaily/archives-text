# Taylor Praises Team's Play; Gridders Calm After Defeat

Inside the Stanford dressing room it was hot and humid.
The players filed into the room in ones and twos and went
about the arduous task of removing their heavy game equipment.
Chuck Taylor, remarkably calm ai'ter just losing a rough game,
made several brief appearances in a general effort to cheer his
team.
However, Taylor's efforts were not really necessary. The
player's tended to view Saturday's loss with calm objectivity.
Fullback Lou Valli, who seems to be making a habit of scoring
Stanford's first touchdowns, saw it this way:
"They were real good, sure. But given us a few breaks at
the right time and we could just as easily have come out on top."
Coach Taylor, talking to an inquiring group of reporters,
observed: "We played a 'heck' of a game against the top team
in the nation. We made fewer mental errors and were more alert
than we usually are this early in the season. On Ihe whole I was
pleased with our showing. We hated to lose, but we learned a
lot."
In answer to the big question — What happened to John
Brodie? — Taylor said:
"Brodie, as you probably guessed, was hurt near the end of
the first half. He was hit hard on his first run. We fed him pills
at half time, but he just didn't come around."
Co-captain Paul Wiggin, one of the men singled out for praise
by both coaches, also commented on Brodie:
"I can only guess, but it seemed to me he had heat exhaustion
or something. He would run 10 yards and be all pooped out. He
shoiddn't even have been in there. He was playing on guts alone."
Brodie is expected to be back in practice this week and in top
condition for Ohio State.
