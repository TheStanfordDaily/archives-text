### Bob Payne 
Ii was a gloomy day for Pacific Coast Conference teams Saturday
as the Big Ten continued its gridiron dominance over Coast elevens
with four smashing intersectional victories. Stanford, California,
Washington and UCLA fell to Michigan State, Illinois, Minnesota
and Michigan, respectively, bringing the 1956 season into full swing.

In conference action, Southern
California disposed of Oregon
State Friday night and Oregon
came from behind to topple Ida
ho.
California, after piling up a 20-
0 lead in the first half against
Illinois, watched helplessly as the
Ulini scored 26 points in the third
period and went on to win, 32-20.
Through a series of Cal fumbles,
the lllini pushed across the four
touchdowns within a period of
6V6 minutes. During the first
half, the Bears, paced by (he run
ning of Nat Brazill, John Stewart
and Herb Jackson, appeared well
on their way to an upset victory.
Minnesota Crushes
The Minnesota Golden Gophers,
seeking revenge for last year's
30-0 trouncing, crushed the fa
vored Washington Huskies, 34-14.
Bobby Cox, former Washington
star who now plays for Minne
sota, threw the tie - breaking
touchdown pass in the second
quarter.
The Oregon State Beavers,
playing without star wingback
Sam Wesley, gave the USC Tro
jans the fight of their life Friday
night in Los Angeles before fi
nally losing, 21-13. The running
of SC's great tailback, Jon Ar
nett, helped Troy pile up a 21-7
half-time lead; but the Beavers
came bark to narrow it to 21-13
and then lost another touchdown
by fumbling on the SC one-yard
line.
Defending PCC champion UC
LA, playing without most of its
"five-game seniors," was crushed
by a powerful Michigan team, 42-
13, at Ann Arbor. The Wolver
ines turned three Bruin fumbles
into touchdowns and scored an
other as the result of an 11-yard
UCLA punt. Michigan, favored
to be the Big Ten's Rose Bowl
representative, unveiled two out
standing sophomore backs,
Idaho Scares
Idaho's scrappy Vandals threw
a scare into Oregon before bow
ing, 21-14, in the first conference
game for each team. Reserve
quarterback Jack Crabtree j
sparked a fourth - quarter drive
for the Ducks which put over, the
winning score with less than'five
minutes remaining.
Washington State hit the win
column Saturday, coming back
from a 12-0 deficit to snow under
San Jose State, 33-18. The Cou
gars rolled up 465 yards, 273
rushing and 192 passing, during
the rout.
