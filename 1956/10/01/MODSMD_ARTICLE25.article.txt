## 
### 
Brooklyn, with the chips down
Friday, came back this weekend
to capture the National League
pennant.
An 8-6 win over the Pittsburgh
Pirates yesterday sewed up the
title. While the Bums were de
feating Pittsburgh Saturday, 6-2
and 3-1, Milwaukee faltered be
j fore the St. Louis Cards, 2-1, in
12 innings.
Duke Snider and Sandy Amo
ros aided the Bums' late-season
rush to the top with two homers
each in the lopsided victory. Don
Nevvcombe notched his 27th win
after Don Bessent hauled him out
of an eighth-inning jam.
Going into yesterday's games,
the Braves' only hope for a Series
berth was a slim one. A Dodger
loss, coupled with a Sunday Mil
waukee win, would have meant a
tie and a play-off. The Braves did
win yesterday, beating St. Louis
4-2, but the Dodgers failed to
oblige.
