# JV's in 43-6 Win Over Navy Fliers
## 
### 
Halfback Roy Stephen led the
Stanford Braves to a 43-6 win
over an inept Moffett Field Flier
team Saturday as he scored three
times in the third quarter on runs
of 53, 14 and one yards.
The first half saw a see-saw
battle between the two teams and
the score was 6-6 at the inter
mission, but Stephen and a 22-
yard scoring pass from Bob Nico
let to Gordy Roberts pushed the
score to 30-6 at the end of the
third period.
Late in the first period Les
Hopkins picked up his own fum
ble and plunged over for a score,
but the Fliers countered on a
long pass play from Bob Mears
to tie the count in the second
quarter.
Wally Honeywell and Tim Le
mucci added scores for the JV's
in the final quarter and Jerry
Hitchman kicked the only conver
sion in the game to close out the
scoring.
