## 
### 
An exhibit of Dresden porce
lain will be on display at the
Stanford Museum through Octo
ber. The pieces are from an ex
tensive collection belonging to
Mrs. Florence Meacham Gleason
of Los Altos.
Many of the pieces reproduce
famous paintings in Dresden gal
leries, while others deal with
mythological subjects. One set of
plates is decorated with original
scenes from Wagnerian operas,
many from the "Ring" series.
The porcelain was decorated by
Richard Wehsener, one of the
leading artists of the Meissen fac
tory until he established his own
studio in Dresden. #
In the exhibit is a Meissen tea
set which was on display at the
Paris exhibition in 1900. It is dec
orated in an elaborate rococo
style with water nymphs and
waves.
The collection was acquired by
Mrs. Gleason's father in the early
years of this century during sev
eral trips to Europe. It is being
shown here through the generos
ity of Mrs. Gleason and her
daughter. Mrs. H. Donald Win
bigler of Los Altos.
