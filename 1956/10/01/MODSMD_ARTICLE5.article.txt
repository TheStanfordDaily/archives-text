# LIQUOR CASE
## Six Will Be Booked on ABC Count 
### 
The six Stanford students ar
rested last week on liquor
charges must be arraigned before
their cases may be turned over
to Men's and Women's Councils,
according lo Frank Fullenwider,
area Alcoholic Beverage Commis
sion administrator.
University officials had hoped
the ABC would have turned the
cases over to Stanford before ar
raignment. In reporting the deci
sion made Friday in a meeting
with the district attorney, Ful
lenwider elaborated, "We would
recommend to the judge that, in
the event they plead guilty or are
found guilty, they would be given
probation and turned over to the
University.
Probation Terms
"If they carried out the terms
of their probation, terms to be
set by the University, they would
be permitted to take hack their
pleas of guilty and have their
convictions set aside."
The arraignment of three stu
dents arrested last Tuesday was
requested by an attorney to be
put off until Oct. 8. Originally,
ihe arraignment was scheduled
for 10 today, in Redwood City
Municipal Court.
Three Out on Bail
The three, Gerald Bricea, Lois
Mace and Jerome Reinhart, and
bartender Richard Newman are
out on bail. Bricca, Miss Mace
and Reinhart paid $50 bail each,
while Newman was released on
payment of $100.
The students arrested Wednes
day, George Ellis, Stephen Fen
der and Jack Newquist, will be
arraigned at 10 today as sched
uled.
