## 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 30 (UP)â€”Yu
goslav President Tito conferred
in Yalta today with Erno Gcroe,
the man who replaced his arch
enemy, Matyas Rakosi, as Com
munist boss in Hungary.
Radio Moscow reported tonight
that Geroe arrived today in the
Black Sea resort where Tito and
Russian Communist party secre
tary Nikita Khrushchev are try
ing to iron out "differences" be
tween their parties.
Premier Nicolai A. Bulganin
also came to Yalta today for the
first time since Tito arrived Fri
day.
Rakosi was a loader in the op
position to Tito during thr years
when the Yugoslav president was
out of favor with the Kremlin.
110 was deposed as Hungarian
Communist party boss earlier
this year, apparently as part of
the do;il that helped the Russo-
Yugoslav split.
Geroe replaced Rakosi, but
there were indications Tito did
not care much for the choice
since Yugoslav - Hungarian rela
tions remained cool.
The brief communique broad
cast from Mi scow gave no clue
to the matters discussed at the
meeting.
