# Little Left In Fading Farm Village
## Library, Dining Hall, Post Office Close Down As Students Emigrate 
### Anne Johnson 
Stanford's Village is dying.
Gone are its library, its dining
hall and some of its dormitories.
Its population this autumn num
bers 415 single men and 298
couples.
Created in 1946 to handle the
surge of students back to the
campus after the Second World
War, the Village originally had a
capacity for 1300 to 1500 single
students. In 1954 it had 897 men
and graduate women residing in
the section designated for single
students. Last year the popula
tion of that section dropped to
550 students.
Only the apartments for mar
ried students and their children
have remained filled to capacity.
At present according to Village
director Dr. John Yarborough,
over 100 couples are on a wait
ing list for apartments.
Distance Problem
For single men living in the
Village this year there are prob
lems. The Village is located three
miles from campus in Menlo
Park and with no organized car
pools operating, residents have to
find ways and means to get to
and from campus each day.
The dining hall has been closed
because there isn't a sufficient
number of students using it.
Mrs. Gussie Martin, Village
housing secretary, pointed out
that the dining hall was geared
to accommodate 1000 students
and remained in use until less
than 500 meal tickets were sold
for it.
Undergraduate men are eating
at Stern Hall and graduate stu
dents at Encina Commons unless
they prefer to eat off campus.
Owner of approximately half
the Village land is the Stanford
Research Institute. It tore down
the library and two of the dormi
tories this year to clear ground
for its planned permanent build
ings.
No Post Office
The United States government
stepped in this summer to aid
the decline and shut down its Vil- ■
lage past office. Mail is delivered
once each day which is the same
as last year but packages -must
be taken to the campus office.
Men in the Vilage live in single
or triple rooms. According to
residents, the rooms are comfor
table although the buildings, re
converted army hospital units,
are run down.
Sterling Hall, which housed
graduate women students last
year, is being used as a men's
dormitory along with seven oth
ers. No single women are now
residing in the Village.
Couples Section
In the section reserved for
couples, each apartment has its
own kitchen. Couples without
children live in two-room units
while one child entitles them to a
bedroom besides the living room
and kitchen. Rent is low and in
cludes utilities, according to oc
cupants.
Dr. Yarborough explained that
the half of the Village owned by
Stanford will see nine more years
of use and then will be sold to
Menlo Park under a gentlemen's j
agreement between Stanford's!
Board of Trustees and Menlo's j
city fathers.
The apartments and accommo- j
dations for 285 single men will j
remain open until then. The three :
buildings housing sophomores
this year are owned by SRI and
their future is uncertain.
So while the Village is dying, it !
is not yet dead.

bedroom besides the living room
and kitchen. Rent is low and in
cludes utilities, according to oc
cupants.
Dr. Yarborough explained that
the half of the Village owned by
Stanford will see nine more years
of use and then will be sold to
Menlo Park under a gentlemen's j
agreement between Stanford's!
Board of Trustees and Menlo's j
city fathers.
The apartments and accommo- j
dations for 285 single men will j
remain open until then. The three :
buildings housing sophomores
this year are owned by SRI and
their future is uncertain.
So while the Village is dying, it !
is not yet dead.
Stanford's Village is dying.
Gone are its library, its dining
hall and some of its dormitories.
Its population this autumn num
bers 415 single men and 298
couples.
Created in 1946 to handle the
surge of students back to the
campus after the Second World
War, the Village originally had a
capacity for 1300 to 1500 single
students. In 1954 it had 897 men
and graduate women residing in
the section designated for single
students. Last year the popula
tion of that section dropped to
550 students.
Only the apartments for mar
ried students and their children
have remained filled to capacity.
At present according to Village
director Dr. John Yarborough,
over 100 couples are on a wait
ing list for apartments.
Distance Problem
For single men living in the
Village this year there are prob
lems. The Village is located three
miles from campus in Menlo
Park and with no organized car
pools operating, residents have to
find ways and means to get to
and from campus each day.
The dining hall has been closed
because there isn't a sufficient
number of students using it.
Mrs. Gussie Martin, Village
housing secretary, pointed out
that the dining hall was geared
to accommodate 1000 students
and remained in use until less
than 500 meal tickets were sold
for it.
Undergraduate men are eating
at Stern Hall and graduate stu
dents at Encina Commons unless
they prefer to eat off campus.
Owner of approximately half
the Village land is the Stanford
Research Institute. It tore down
the library and two of the dormi
tories this year to clear ground
for its planned permanent build
ings.
No Post Office
The United States government
stepped in this summer to aid
the decline and shut down its Vil- ■
lage past office. Mail is delivered
once each day which is the same
as last year but packages -must
be taken to the campus office.
Men in the Vilage live in single
or triple rooms. According to
residents, the rooms are comfor
table although the buildings, re
converted army hospital units,
are run down.
Sterling Hall, which housed
graduate women students last
year, is being used as a men's
dormitory along with seven oth
ers. No single women are now
residing in the Village.
Couples Section
In the section reserved for
couples, each apartment has its
own kitchen. Couples without
children live in two-room units
while one child entitles them to a
bedroom besides the living room
and kitchen. Rent is low and in
cludes utilities, according to oc
cupants.
