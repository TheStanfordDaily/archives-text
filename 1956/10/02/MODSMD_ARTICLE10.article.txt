# Fifteen Nations Form Canal Shippers Group To Challenge Nasser
## SCUA Plan Rejected by Three States Egypt Seeks Russian Veto of Association In Coming UN Talk 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 1 (UP)窶認ifteen
nations representing about 90 per
cent of all Suez Canal shipping
today formed a canal users' asso
ciation challenge Egypt's con
trol of the waterway. Three other
nations invited declined the invi
tation to join.
Japan, Ethiopia and Pakistan
announced at the opening session
of the 18-nation Suez Canal Users
Association (SCUA) conference
in London that they would not
accept the Western plan for com
bining into one operational group
to press toward internationaliza
tion of the canal. Egypt already
has rejected the plan as tanta
mount to a "declaration of war."
The other 15 present,
including the key Mideast coun
try of Iran, immediately went
ahead with plans to put the asso
ciation in business. Sources said
it was hoped that the association
would begin operating within two
weeks, or by the time the United
Nations Security Council con
cludes debate on the issue. De
bate starts in New York Friday.
Nasser Seeks Veto
Egyptian President Gamal Ab
del Nasser met in Cairo with So
viet Ambassador Fvgeny Kisse
lev, and informed sources said he
sought assurances that Egypt can
count on the support of Russia's
veto in the coming United Na
tions debate.
In Washington, the Maritime
Administration announced it is
preparing tankers in its "moth
ball" fleet to carry oil for the
United States and Europe in the
event Mideast supplies are cut off
by a Suez Canal shutdown.
British Foreign Secretary Sel
wyn Lloyd, acting as chairman
of the conference at Lancaster
House, proclaimed the association
formally constituted. He then de
clared the ambassadors of the 15
member nations to be the associ
ation's board of governors.
"We Are Determined"
Later Lloyd took off by special
plane for the U.N. debate in New
York with the warning that "we
are determined to stand up for
our rights" in the Suez Canal
zone.
The ambassadors from Japan,
Pakistan and Ethiopia were in
vited to remain at the conference
as observers. Lloyd said he hoped
their governments would see fit
to join after the plan is com
pleted.
The meeting then broke up into
committees to work out the final
details, including selection of a
man to run the organization.
As planned, the association will
band together member nations
under one shipping headquarters
for the purpose of running vessels
through the canal. Tolls for use
of the waterway would be paid to
Egypt only by the association, and
the association would strive to
reach a settlement with Egypt
over control of the canal.

announced at the opening session
of the 18-nation Suez Canal Users
Association (SCUA) conference
in London that they would not
accept the Western plan for com
bining into one operational group

tion of the canal. Egypt already
has rejected the plan as tanta
mount to a "declaration of war."
The other 15 present,
including the key Mideast coun
try of Iran, immediately went
ahead with plans to put the asso
ciation in business. Sources said
it was hoped that the association
would begin operating within two
weeks, or by the time the United
Nations Security Council con
cludes debate on the issue. De
bate starts in New York Friday.

"We Are Determined"

plane for the U.N. debate in New
York with the warning that "we
are determined to stand up for
our rights" in the Suez Canal
zone.
The ambassadors from Japan,
Pakistan and Ethiopia were in
vited to remain at the conference
as observers. Lloyd said he hoped
their governments would see fit
to join after the plan is com
pleted.
The meeting then broke up into
committees to work out the final
details, including selection of a
man to run the organization.
As planned, the association will
band together member nations

Egypt only by the association, and
the association would strive to
reach a settlement with Egypt
over control of the canal.
