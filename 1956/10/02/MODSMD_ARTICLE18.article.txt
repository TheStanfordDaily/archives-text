# Peace Without justice

"PEACE WITHOUT JUSTICE IS TYRANNY."
Til ese words, spoken about the task this
rounlry faced in the second World War, were
never more meaningful than now as this coiin
ti\ faces the perplexing hut crucial task of
wiping out in justice within its own boundaries.
Iti this circumstance, we can no longer point
with wrath and indignation at Nazi Germany
and Fascist Italy, but must turn with a sense
0 I shame and determination to righting tin;
wrong that we ourselves have created.
i he problem—that of achieving a full meas
ure of equality for all American citizens re
ga r <11 ess of race or color —can never be solved
b>.the mere integration of buses, trains and
schools, although litis is the first natural step
in the process. The job of physical integration
1 relatively simple when one starts pondering
the true meaning of equality and where its
presence matters most—in the recesses of the
human mind.
lo a Negro child in Georgia or Mississippi,
boasts that America is the land of equality and
justice will sound as the banal shouts of the
livpo» rite until the idea, as well as lh<* practice,
ol second-class citizenry disappears.
ror this reason, integration will of necessity
]><> gradual a fact that is often obscured bv
the debate over immediate or gradual inte
gration.
And lor this reason, also, integration must
come immediately lo the schools, for it is there,
that children's minds become conditioned to

the values that will direct their attitudes in
later life.
For several weeks newspapers have screamed
the stories of race riots and mass protest dem
onstrations in the towns of Clinton, Sturgis and
Mansfield.
They show the obvious: that the South is
waging a last-ditch fight to preserve its archaic
principle of white supremacy, that individuals
will meet force with violence until they realize
that their cause is one without potence.
They also show the less obvious: that unless
both the federal and state governments act
with full power to see that the law is enforced,
as Tennessee did under Gov. Frank Clements,
the South will prolong integration indefinitely.
Another generation will grow up thinking the
Bill of Bights exists for persons of only one
color.
What is Ihe answer? It lies in a rational
approach to an irrational problem; it lies with
both mental and physical strength to enforce
a locally unpopular concept; and it lies with
the particular type of patience that recognizes
the complexity of the problem of educating
individuals to a new ideal.
There is relative peace now in the South,
but that peace is without justice. Ami the
tyranny that follows is that of the worst form:
the type that denies man his basic respect as
a human being.
