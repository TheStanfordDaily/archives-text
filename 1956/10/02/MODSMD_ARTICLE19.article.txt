Academic Senate at UCLA recently entered
the Pacific Coast Conference controversy with a
recommendation for a new athletic organization
on the West wood campus. The group suggested
that ihe responsibilities for intercollegiate ath
letics now vested in the Associated Students of

UCLA be transferred to the faculty and the uni
versity administration.
Before faculty action becomes final the reso
lution will have to be considered by a committee
to work out procedures mutually satisfactory to
the Senate and the ASUCLA and be approved by
the Board of Regents.

University of Idaho students are facing park
ing problems similar to those of Stanford stu
dents. Campus parking permits have been issued
this year, with $5 fines for students' delay in
putting stickers on windshields.
Traffic jams during rush hours have occurred
regularly. The university system for parking
penalties includes accumulative fines during a
student's entire college career. After a third
offense for parking violations, students are re
ferred to a disciplinary committee.

Initial plans have been made at the University
of California campus at Berkeley to reorganize
an interracial fraternity. Beta Sigma Tau, a
social group, was active on the Cal campus from
1948 to 1953 but closed because of financial diffi
culties.
Bob Burns, Beta Sig alumni who is heading
the reorganization committee, described the fra
ternity as one for which "character and effort,
as well as the necessary scholastic standing, are
the only criteria considered for active member
ship."
