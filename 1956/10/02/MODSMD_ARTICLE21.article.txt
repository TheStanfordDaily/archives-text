- Editor, The Daily:
I would like to commend the staff of The Daily
for focusing the attention of the students on the
international problem of the Suez Canal. How
ever, I would like to make a few comments on
the article which appeared in the Sept. 28 issue
of The Daily.
In that article, which was an interview with
Mrs. Christina Harris, it is stated that "Mrs.
Harris denies that Nasser has broken faith with
the West in any way [by seizing the canal]. In
the first place, he did not sign the Convention
of 1888 which he was enforcing."
This type of thinking and such condoning of
illegal actions can cause only chaos in our world.
International agreements of one nation with an
other are binding even when a new president
comes to head the nation. The agreements are
between the nations and not between the indi
viduals happening to head them at the time.
Besides, under Article VIII of the Anglo-Egyp
tian Agreement of Oct. 19, 1954, regarding the
Suez Canal, the Egyptian government headed by
Nasser reaffirmed Egypt's obligation under the
Constantinople Convention of 1888.
Mrs. Harris also says that Nasser "has cer
tainly upheld his commitments of free passage
as contained in that document, except in the case
of Israel, with which Egypt is still officially at
war."
This is misleading, as Mrs. Harris implies that
Egypt has a right to interfere with the free pas
sage of ships belonging to a nation on which it
declared war. This is also not true, as in the 1888
document, which Nasser reaffirmed, it says that
the Suez Canal should be kept "always free and
open in lime ol war as in time of peace to every

vessel of commerce or of war without distinction
of flag."
This agreement was observed all through the
Italo-Turkish conflict of 1911, through World
War I and World War 11, but has been violated
continuously by Egypt since 1948.
Mrs. Harris also forgot that the Security Coun
cil on Sept. 1, 1951, acting on a complaint from
Israel, passed a resolution calling upon Egypt
"to terminate the restrictions on passage of in
ternational commercial shipping and goods
through the Suez Canal wherever bound, and to
cease all interference with such shipping." Egypt
has not complied with the resolution.
Also it should be remembered that Egypt is
not officially at war with'lsrael, since it signed
the 1949 General Armistice Agreement with its
provision in Article II against "any warlike or
hostile act." The Armistice Agreement has been
in effect now for more than seven years and is
of a permanent character, and neither party can
reasonably assert that it is actively a belligerent.
Nasser denies free passage not only to- Israeli
ships but to all other ships attempting to trade
with Israel. He also confiscates goods found on
these ships which are intended for Israel; he
maintains a black list of such ships and denies
them water and refueling.
On Dec. 3, 1953, Egyptian guns fired at the
United States vessel Albion at*the entry to the
Gulf of Aqaba. Egyptian authorities explained
that they acted*in the belief that the ship's desti
nation was the Israeli port of Elath.
The list of such violations is a very long one,
and it points to the conclusion that Nasser should
not be left in complete control of the Suez Canal
as he definitely acts against free shipping in the
canal and cannot be trusted to operate it as an
international waterway.
