# Freelen Comments on Lack of Issues As New Legislature Meets Tonight
## President Stresses Need for General Student Interest 
### Dave Scott 
Student government at Stan
ford will officially begin a new
year when ASSU President Bob
Freelen opens the first meeting
of ASSU Legislature at 7:30 to
morrow night.
But just what will be the prob
lems facing the organization AS
SU government this year?
The main problem is the fail
ure of student government to at
tract the interest of the students,
according to Freelen.
No Intellectual Challenge
"Student government has
failed to provide an adequate in
tellectual challenge to the Stan
ford student," Freelen thinks.
Government at a school of the
caliber of Stanford should pro
vide stimulation and controversy, j
reason as well as relaxation.
"In this aspect student govern- !
merit has failed, and it is not the
fault of the studer/t in general;
something has to be done to stim
ulate his interest.
"Whether they believe it or
not, student government affects
every single person at the Uni
versity. With the various class !
and ASSU activity boards, there
are always decisions made that
touch even the most disinterested
person.
Inefficient, Contact
"But where we fall down in
the process is the contact with
the individual student. The com
munication process of the gov
ernment just isn't living up to its
capabilities. I will try to make
an effort to reach the average
student this year, but much of
the spirit must arise from the
student body itself."
Freelen strongly believes in the
responsibility every stuu en t
should have toward government.
"If responsibility in this one line
fails, his feeling of responsibility
about government in general can
not help but degenerate also,"
Freelen explains.
Last year only 51 candidates
ran for ASSU and class offices,
the smallest slate in 10 years.
Freelen explains this by a lack of
controversy in government last
year.
Few Issues
Candidates must create issues.
Last year nobody really cared, i
There will be very few issues to j
carry forward to this year.
"Some progress toward great
ing the needed stimulation was I
made last year with the Hostel '
program and the Student-Faculty
Committee."
As far as Ihe first meeting is
concerned, much must be cleared
up from last year's agenda, ac
cording to Freelen. "We have a
legacy confused by last year's by
law changes."
"As far as the Cellar coffee
issue is concerned," concluded 1
Freelen, "I myself am against
the raise in price. But I will not
appeal it to the Board of Gov
ernors unless there is sufficient
opposition to the status quo. per
haps some compromise can be
reached between the five- and 10-
cent factions."

"In this aspect student govern- !
merit has failed, and it is not the

"But where we fall down in
the process is the contact with
the individual student. The com
munication process of the gov
ernment just isn't living up to its
capabilities. I will try to make
an effort to reach the average
student this year, but much of
the spirit must arise from the
student body itself."
Freelen strongly believes in the
responsibility every stuu en t
should have toward government.
"If responsibility in this one line
fails, his feeling of responsibility
about government in general can
not help but degenerate also,"
Freelen explains.
Last year only 51 candidates
ran for ASSU and class offices,
the smallest slate in 10 years.
Freelen explains this by a lack of
controversy in government last
year.
Few Issues
Candidates must create issues.
Last year nobody really cared, i
There will be very few issues to j
carry forward to this year.
"Some progress toward great
ing the needed stimulation was I
made last year with the Hostel '
program and the Student-Faculty
Committee."
As far as Ihe first meeting is
concerned, much must be cleared
up from last year's agenda, ac
cording to Freelen. "We have a
legacy confused by last year's by
law changes."
"As far as the Cellar coffee
issue is concerned," concluded 1
Freelen, "I myself am against
the raise in price. But I will not
appeal it to the Board of Gov
ernors unless there is sufficient
opposition to the status quo. per
haps some compromise can be
reached between the five- and 10-
cent factions."

Student government at Stan
ford will officially begin a new
year when ASSU President Bob
Freelen opens the first meeting
of ASSU Legislature at 7:30 to
morrow night.
But just what will be the prob
lems facing the organization AS
SU government this year?
The main problem is the fail
ure of student government to at
tract the interest of the students,
according to Freelen.
No Intellectual Challenge
"Student government has
failed to provide an adequate in
tellectual challenge to the Stan
ford student," Freelen thinks.
Government at a school of the
caliber of Stanford should pro
vide stimulation and controversy, j
reason as well as relaxation.
