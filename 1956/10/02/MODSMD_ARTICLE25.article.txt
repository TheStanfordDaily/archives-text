FOOTBALL: ITS CAUSE AI\1) CUKE
. At next Saturday's football game, while you are sitting
in your choice student's seat on the ten-yard line, won't
you give a thought to Alaric Sigafoos?
Who, you ask, is Alaric Sigafoos? Come closer, sit
down, light a Philip Morris, savor that natural tobacco
goodness, sigh contentedly, cross your fat little legs, and
listen.
Alaric Sigafoos (1868-1934) started life humbly on a
farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both
named Ralph, were bean-gleaners, and Alaric became a
bean-gleaner too. But he soon tired of the work and went
to Memphis where he got a job with a logging firm. Here
the ex-bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. Then
he drifted to Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe
wiper). Then to Arizona where he strung dried fruit
(fig-rigger). Then to Virginia where he was a research
assistant (book-looker). Then to Long Island where he
dressed poultry (duck-plucker). Then to California where
he lectured young women who were about to get married
(bride-chider). Then to Minnesota where he cut up frozen
lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada where he determined
the odds in a gambling house (dice-pricer). Then to
Milwaukee where he pasted camera lenses together
(Zeiss-splicer).
Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a
tannery, beating pig-hides until they were soft and supple
(hog-flogger). Here he found happiness at last.

Why, you ask, did he find happiness at last as a hog
flogger? Light another firm and fragrant Philip Morris,
taste that true tobacco flavor, puff, relax, let sweet lassi
tude possess your limbs, and listen.
Next door to the hog-floggery was an almond grove
owned by a girl named Chimera Emrick. Chimera was
pink and white and marvelously hinged, and Alaric was
hopelessly in love the moment he clapped eyes on her.
Bach day he came to the almond grove to woo Chimera,
but to no avail. He tried with all his vigor and guile,
but she, alas, stayed cool.
Then one day Alaric got a brilliant idea. It was the
day before the annual Omaha Almond Festival. On this
day, as we all know, every almond grower in Omaha
enters a float in the big parade. The floats always consist
of large cardboard almonds hanging from large cardboard
almond trees.
Alaric's inspiration was to stitch pieces of pigskin
together and inflate them until they looked like big,
plump almonds. "These sure beat skinny old cardboard
almonds," said Alaric to himself. "Tomorrow they will
surely take first prize for Chimera, and she will be mine!"
Early the next morning Alaric came running to
Chimera with his inflated pigskin almonds, but she, alas,
told him she was not entering a float that year. In fact,
she had just sold her almond grove and was moving East
to try out with the Boston Red Sox.
Alaric, upon hearing these glum tidings, flew into a
violent rage. He started kicking his pigskin almonds all
over the place. And who should be walking by at that
very instant but Abner Doubleday!
Mr. Doubleday, who had invented baseball some years
earlier, was now trying to invent football, but without
success. The trouble was, he couldn't figure out what kind
of ball to use. Now, seeing Alaric kick the pigskin
spheroids, his problem was suddenly solved. "Eureka!"
he cried, and ran to his drawing board, and the rest is
history!
