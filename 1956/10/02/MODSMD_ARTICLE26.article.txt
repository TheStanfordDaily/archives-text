# Coach Ghilotti 'Optimistic' About Frosh Grid Outlook
## Pre-Season Outlook Seems Excellent 'on Paper'; Backs, Linemen Report in Good Condition 
### Fred Cropper 
In a business where optimism
is rare the coaching business—
Freshman Football Coach Bob
Ghilotti is admittedly "pretty op
timistic" about his 1956 Papoose
squad.
Having greeted a squad of GO
strong at tlie first practice yes
terday, Ghilotti is undaunted as
he faces a schedule of three
tough foes—two of whom beat
his eleven last year.
The Indian frosh whipped the
University of Southern Califor
nia yearlings last season, but fell
before UCLA and California. In
1954 the situation was exactly re
versed.
Strong JLine
Ghilotti's squad meets the same
three opponents this fall, as fol
lows: Oct. 27, USC at Stanford;
Nov. 3, UCLA at Los Angeles;
Nov. 10, Cal at Stanford.
Ghilotti, in an interview Fri
day, emphasized that his team
this fall looks good—"on paper.
I am pretty optimistic about
these the coach said enthu
siastically. "Our line should be
strong."
Experienced Backfield
At each end of the Papoose
line, Ghilotti can count on a grid
der who has plenty o/size. Vying
for the end positions are Chris
Burford, rated an outstanding
pass grabber, and Jerry Winters,
a big man with a lot of speed.
Coach Ghilotti was equally en
thusiastic about the gridders fill
ing other line positions. "We
have many centers, with Bill Sti
vers and Harlin Limmer show
ing lots of promise," he declared.

"Ron Fernandes looks good in
the tackle spot."
Behind the durable "mules" in
GhiJotti's forward line are sev
eral "horsemen" who are men of
proved galloping ability. "Our
backfield," the frosh mentor said,
"should be strong with many
good running backs."
Coach Ghilotti named fullbacks
Jim Honeywell. J. T. Jones and
Mark Keppel, halfbacks Dick Ho
fius and Rod McMillin, and quar
terback Dick Norman as out
standing backfield prospects.
Former Indians Coaching
Assistants on Ghilotti's coach
ing staff are all former Stanford
gridders. The staff includes Wall
Eagle, Dick Horn, Tony Mosich
and Bill Tarr.
Summing up his optimism for
1956, Ghilotti said, "This group
of boys seems very interested in
playing ball. Throughout the
summer they have been working
out on their own, and physical
conditioning is a strong point in
any team. If what we have on
paper materializes, and I'm sure
it will, we should have an excel
lent ball club. Of course, the com
petition will be tough, but I feel
that we shoud have a winning
team this year."
