## 
### Dean Stewart 
Doug Dick, reserve right half
back, saw limited action Satur
day against Michigan State, but
il was long enough for him to
break into the scoring column.
Dick, who specializes in conver
sion kicking in addition to his
halfback job, booted the extra
point that gave Stanford a 7-7
half-time tie with the Spartans.
Last year as a sophomore Dick
appeared briefly in seven games.
During spring practice Dick made
a number of long runs and defi
nitely established himself as a
breakaway threat. Perhaps his
most important characteristic,
from the pass - minded Indians'
point of view, is the fact that he's
a good receiver.
A compact type of runner who
makes a difficult target for tack
lers, Dick has all the qualifica
tions of a top running back. He
is the fastest back on the '56 var
sity, which gives his solid 190-
pound frame added authority.
At Redondo High School Dick
excelled at track as well as foot
ball. He turned in a speedy 9.8
time for the 100-yard dash, which
should interest track coach Pay
ton Jordan. But Dick prefers to
stay with football:
"Spring football practice and
track conflict. Besides, football
slows you down and I've lost lots
of my speed."
During the winter Dick did try
out for rugby and was developing
into a good wing until he injured
his leg.
Dick developed his place-kick
ing ability in high school. His
older brother was also a point
after-touchdown specialist, and it
seemed only natural for him to
do likewise. In addition to Satur
day's conversion, he also kicked
an extra point aaginst Washing
lon State in Stanford's opener.
