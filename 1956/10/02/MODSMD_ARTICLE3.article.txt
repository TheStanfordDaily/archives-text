# Ike Attacks Democratic Actions on Education
## President Calls Stevenson 'Confused' On Subject of Federal Aid to Schools 
### 
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 1 (UP)—President Eisenhower, on a fly
ing political trip to border state Kentucky, tonight said that Demo
cratic Presidential nominee Adlai E. Stevenson was a "confused can
didate," on the subject of federal aid to education.
Eisenhower charged that the Democrats wanted to take the nation

"back to the old road—the zig-zag
directionless road of trial and
error," with "endless series of de
tours around crises—leading nq
where."
The chief executive spoke to
night in the coliseum of the Uni
versity of Kentucky before a
statewide Republican rally and
over national television and radio
networks.
Fight Against Inflation
Eisenhower also said in Cleve
land, speaking in the public
square after a morning of confer
ences with Ohio GOP candidates
and state organization leaders,
that the Democrats permitted in
flation to rob the paychecks of
the nation, whereas the Republi
can administration had waged
"the most successful fight"
against inflation.
Eisenhower dealt again with
the economic situation here to
night, but his emphasis was on
education. As he looked into the
future, he said the "most urgent"
of all domestic problems facing
the country was the matter of
expanding school facilities.
The chief executive said the
serious schoolroom shortage had
been reduced somewhat under
hi s administration, but not
enough. And he blamed the Dem
ocrats in Congress for not provid
ing sufficient funds for school
improvement.
Five-Year Program
Eisenhower recalled that in the
last and Democratic - controlled
Congress he asked for a $2 billion
program of federal grants and
other aids for school construction
during a five-year period.
The President also pointed out
that he insisted that the federal
aid he distributed to states on the
basis of need and that the states
themselves match the federal
funds. Congress, however, turned
down the President's suggestion.
Without calling Stevenson by
name, Eisenhower referred back
I to the Democrat's criticism of
GOP handling of the school prob
lem last week.
"Confused Candidate"
"Now within the last week
we see the strange spectacle of
! an apparently confused candidate
I of the opposition supporting the
: 'he bill that we pro-
I posed and that his party de
i feated," the President said.
J The chief executive also out-
I lined other legislative requests
; which he will send to Congress
early next year:
• Finanoi.il and "technical" aid
to areas suffering chronic unem
| ployment. He said his proposals
to combat unemployment this
j year were "sidetracked" in Con
i gress by the Democrats.
• He will repeat his request
for extension of the federal mini-
J mum wage law.
• Federal grants to states to
' expand and strengthen programs
j for occupational safety.
• "Further help to small busi
ness with some dozen specific
recommendations for action in
cluding special tax measures."

LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 1 (UP)—President Eisenhower, on a fly
ing political trip to border state Kentucky, tonight said that Demo
cratic Presidential nominee Adlai E. Stevenson was a "confused can
didate," on the subject of federal aid to education.
Eisenhower charged that the Democrats wanted to take the nation

"back to the old road—the zig-zag
directionless road of trial and
error," with "endless series of de
tours around crises—leading nq
where."
The chief executive spoke to
night in the coliseum of the Uni
versity of Kentucky before a
statewide Republican rally and
over national television and radio
networks.
Fight Against Inflation
Eisenhower also said in Cleve
land, speaking in the public
square after a morning of confer
ences with Ohio GOP candidates
and state organization leaders,
that the Democrats permitted in
flation to rob the paychecks of
the nation, whereas the Republi
can administration had waged
"the most successful fight"
against inflation.
Eisenhower dealt again with
the economic situation here to
night, but his emphasis was on
education. As he looked into the
future, he said the "most urgent"
of all domestic problems facing
the country was the matter of
expanding school facilities.
The chief executive said the
serious schoolroom shortage had
been reduced somewhat under
hi s administration, but not
enough. And he blamed the Dem
ocrats in Congress for not provid
ing sufficient funds for school
improvement.
Five-Year Program
Eisenhower recalled that in the
last and Democratic - controlled
Congress he asked for a $2 billion
program of federal grants and
other aids for school construction
during a five-year period.
The President also pointed out
that he insisted that the federal
aid he distributed to states on the
basis of need and that the states
themselves match the federal
funds. Congress, however, turned
down the President's suggestion.
Without calling Stevenson by
name, Eisenhower referred back
I to the Democrat's criticism of
GOP handling of the school prob
lem last week.
"Confused Candidate"
"Now within the last week
we see the strange spectacle of
! an apparently confused candidate
I of the opposition supporting the
: 'he bill that we pro-
I posed and that his party de
i feated," the President said.
J The chief executive also out-
I lined other legislative requests
; which he will send to Congress
early next year:
• Finanoi.il and "technical" aid
to areas suffering chronic unem
| ployment. He said his proposals
to combat unemployment this
j year were "sidetracked" in Con
i gress by the Democrats.
• He will repeat his request
for extension of the federal mini-
J mum wage law.
• Federal grants to states to
' expand and strengthen programs
j for occupational safety.
• "Further help to small busi
ness with some dozen specific
recommendations for action in
