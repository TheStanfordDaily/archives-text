Brooklyn Dodgers go against the
American League pennant - win
ning New York Yankees in the
first game of the 1956 World Se

Current betting odds favor the
Yankees throughout the series.
Men supposedly in the know are
quoting 7-5 on the games. On a
man-to-man basis 6V?-5 is the fig
ure.
Others are claiming that 1956
will be a carbon copy of a year
ago. Last year the National
League Bums drew the Series up
to the last game before beating
the New Yorkers.
