# Adlai Says Ike Failed to Meet School 'Crisis'
## Outlines 5-Point Plan For Government Aid To Help Poor Areas 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (UP) —
Adlai E. Stevenson charged to
night in a new broadscale attack
on President Eisenhower's school
policies that the administration
has "utterly failed" to meet the
education "crisis."
Plugging his own "generation
long" school plan, the Democrat
ic Presidential nominee said Ei
senhower used the 1955 White
House Conference on Education
as an "excuse for inaction."
"Our schools were asked to
wait through three years of gath
ering crisis for a definition of the
federal role," Stevenson declared,
"only to emerge with no defini
tion."
When the administration fi
nally did ask Congress to act, he
said, it "put forth a weak hill for
federal aid limited to school con
struction alone."
"New America"
Stevenson outlined a five-point
program to improve the nation's
schools in the latest of his "New
America" statements. It was an
elaboration of the nationally-tele
vised school speech he made in
Milwaukee Friday night.
Stevenson said he could not es
timate the cost of his proposed
program until it was determined
what shares should be borne by
the federal, state and local gov
ernments. Hut he said the'nation
as a whole should spend an extra
$."500 million to $1 billion a year
for 10 years to build schools and
hire more teachers.
Five-Point Plan
Stevenson, warning that "it
would be irresponsible to prom
ise quick and rapid solutions" in
the school problem, urged:
• A national policy of federal
aid where local and individual re
sources cannot meet needs.
• "Assumption immediately by
the federal government of a
share in meeting the present ur
gent financial requirements of
our education system, particular
ly those for more classrooms and
for more qualified teachers."
• A program to help able,
needy students go to college and
to encourage students to go into
teaching and other lines of work
where there are serious short
ages.
• Expansion of exchange pro
grams of students and teachers
between the United States and
other countries.
• "Development of new ap
proaches to the challenging op
portunities in vocational and ad
ult education."

"only to emerge with no defini
tion."
When the administration fi
nally did ask Congress to act, he
said, it "put forth a weak hill for
federal aid limited to school con
struction alone."
"New America"
Stevenson outlined a five-point
program to improve the nation's
schools in the latest of his "New
America" statements. It was an
elaboration of the nationally-tele
vised school speech he made in
Milwaukee Friday night.
Stevenson said he could not es
timate the cost of his proposed
program until it was determined
what shares should be borne by
the federal, state and local gov
ernments. Hut he said the'nation
as a whole should spend an extra
$."500 million to $1 billion a year
for 10 years to build schools and
hire more teachers.
Five-Point Plan
Stevenson, warning that "it
would be irresponsible to prom
ise quick and rapid solutions" in
the school problem, urged:
• A national policy of federal
aid where local and individual re
sources cannot meet needs.
• "Assumption immediately by
the federal government of a
share in meeting the present ur
gent financial requirements of
our education system, particular
ly those for more classrooms and
for more qualified teachers."
• A program to help able,
needy students go to college and
to encourage students to go into
teaching and other lines of work
where there are serious short
ages.
• Expansion of exchange pro
grams of students and teachers
between the United States and
other countries.
• "Development of new ap
proaches to the challenging op
portunities in vocational and ad
ult education."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (UP) —
Adlai E. Stevenson charged to
night in a new broadscale attack
on President Eisenhower's school
policies that the administration
has "utterly failed" to meet the
education "crisis."
Plugging his own "generation
long" school plan, the Democrat
ic Presidential nominee said Ei
senhower used the 1955 White
House Conference on Education
as an "excuse for inaction."
"Our schools were asked to
wait through three years of gath
ering crisis for a definition of the
federal role," Stevenson declared,
"only to emerge with no defini
tion."
