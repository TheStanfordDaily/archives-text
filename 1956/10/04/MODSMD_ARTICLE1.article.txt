# LASSU's Program Outlined
## Freelen Names Issues To Be Tackled Soon 
### Dave Scott Associate Editor 
President Bob Freelen opened
the first meeting of ASSU Legis
lature last night with a program
to follow for the coming meet
ings, and then can through the
rest of the evening's agenda in
snappy fashion.
"We shouldn't try to accom
plish too much or try to run
through miracles," Freelen ob
served. "With an everchanging
body of this type, we can get
somewhere if we observe this at
titude."
The problems which he be
lieved Legislature will be faced
with are:
• Work on the bylaws with
special emphasis on the election
system, its voting places and cam
paigns.
• Promotion of student inter
est and awareness of student gov
ernment. Freelen urged all Leg
islature members to do their bit
with the problem.
• The problem of under-age
drinkers. "This is not something
to toy with," Freelen said. "An
investigation committee to look
into this should be appointed
soon."
• Preliminary work on libra
ries. Freelen suggested begin
ning checks be made on the
hours and studying conditions in
"an outmoded library system."
"It is imperative that all these
items be given careful attention
in the near future," Freelen said.
Sequoia Support
The other main items of busi
ness concerned a plea for $575 for
support of the Sequoia literary
magazine for the coming year by
editor Don Shoup.
"An activity like Sequoia just
can't be expected to pay for it
self," Shoup said. "A selected au
dience like ours cannot be ex
pected to attract the needed ad
vertisers, If this worthwhile ac
tivity is to continue, we must
have aid."
Bill Mathewson, ASSU finan
cial manager, moved that the
magazine be given a subsidy of
$150 per issue, with three issues
expected for the academic year.
"In this way we will still be pre
serving an intellectual asset, yet
not giving too much to encourage
incentive," he explaiend.
Legislature approved his mo
tion unanimously. The money
will be taken out of the general
contingency fund. Sequoia's sup
port will come up» before the
body again in the spring.
Vote on the new Inter frater
nity Judicial Council set up was
postponed until next week's
mooting, when all the members
will have read the entire pro
posed regulations. Under the pro
posed system, previously inde
pendent Interfraternity Council
will be placed directly under
Men's Council.
The Council would try only
cases pertaining to officially
sanctioned fraternity events. All
others would be turned over to
Men's Council.
ABC Letter
Freelen read a letter to the
Legislature that he had received
from Frank Fullonwider, area ad
ministrator for the Alcoholic
Beverage Commission. In the let
tor Fullenwider asked compliance
by Students with the regulations
and termor! the all-campus rallies
in regard to the liquor consumed
at them a "violation of the spirit
of the Fundamental Standard."
The appointment of Steve Tal
lent as administrative assistant
to the president was approved
unanimously.
