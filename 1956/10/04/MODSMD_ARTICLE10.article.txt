# Pravda Says That Yugoslavian, Russian Differences Decreasing
## Yalta Talks Hit Snags, Sources Say Red Paper Praises Yugoslav Economies As Truly Socialistic 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 3 (UP)—The
Communist party newspaper
Pravda said today that differ
ences between Soviet and Yugo
slav Communists have "consider
ably lesseend" recently and are
"continuing to diminish."
In a dispatch from its Belgrade
correspondent, Pravda said the
"area of agreement between the
Soviet and Yugoslav Communist
parties has broadened recently."
The story, published while Yu
goslav President Tito conferred
with Soviet leaders in the. Cri
mea, made no direct reference to
his visit.
(Sources close to the Yugoslav
Communist party said in Bel
grade that talks between Tito and
Soviet leaders are not going
smoothly. They said the talks at
Yalta have run into snags on ide
ological matters and the slow
course of tfe-Stalinization in the
satellite countries.
Commufiist Co-operation
(The Yugoslav newspaper Po
litika declared in an editorial that
co-operation with other Commu
nist parties must be based on the
principle that "the truth on dif
ferent ways to socialism is hon
ored in practice."
(Since the Yugoslav press is
closely controlled by the govern
ment, observers in Belgrade in
terpreted the editorial as another
sign that Tito is insisting on his
right to an independent policy in
his talks with Soviet leaders.)
Pravda's dispatch was one of
the friendliest and most optimis
tic a Russian correspondent has
sent from Yugoslavia since So
viet Premier Nikolai Bulganin
and Communist party chief Ni
kita Khrushchev made their dra
matic "journey of friendship" to
Belgrade last year.
On that trip, Khrushchev
blamed Stalin for the breach in
relations between the two nations
which led to Yugoslavia's expul
sion from the Cominform in 19 IS.
Retrospect
Reviewing Soviet-Yugoslav re
lations since the Bulganin-
Khrushchev visit, Pravda's Bel
grade correspondent said they
were based on "community so
cialist objectives and interests."
He quoted a "prominent Yugo
slav Communist" as saying that
the 20th congress of the Soviet
Communist party last December
had "created an ideological at
mosphere affording the most fa
vorable means for further promo
tion of the international working
class and Communist move
ments.
The Pravda article praised Yu
goslavia's economic achievements
as those of a "socialist country."
