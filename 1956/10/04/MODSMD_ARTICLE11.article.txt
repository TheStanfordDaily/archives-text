## Adlai Renews Criticisms; Nixon Sees Ike Victory 
### United Press 
Adlai E. Stevenson last night accused President Eisenhower of
"a gross misstatement of the record" in his political speeches at
Cleveland, Ohio, and Lexington, Ky., Monday.
The Democratic presidential candidate, climaxing a day-long
whistle-stop trip across Pennsylvania with a nation-wide television

address in Pittsburgh, replied to
the President's charge that Demo
crats were indulging in "wicked
nonsense" in their campaign.
Stevenson quoted Eisenhower
as saying on Monday that the
election will hinge on which party
"has done more to help all Ameri
cans meet the problems of their
daily lives."
Stevenson said this was "a
proper statement."
Future Important
"Of course, what matters is
which party will do more in the
future to help people meet the
always new problems of their
daily lives," Stevenson said in a
speech prepared for delivery at
11 p.m. EDT (CBS network).
"But 1 am sure that is what
the Republican candidate meant,"
he said. "And he is right that
each party's past record offers
the best test of its future, per
formance.
"So if the record is to be the
test, let's get the record straight.
"I think it is too bad that the
President indulged himself in
such a gross misstatement of the
record. I am sure he is an honor
able man and could hardly have
deliberately intended the misrep
resentation which his speech in
cluded."
Nixon Speech
In Philadelphia, Vice President
Richard M. Nixon, cheered by the
biggest crowds of his 16-day cam
paign swing, last night denounced
one of Adlai Stevenson's foreign
policy proposals as "catastrophic
nonsense."
The Vice President, greeted by
thousands at every turn in his
six-hour visit, said Stevenson's
proposal for discontinuing H
bomb tests if Russia will agree
would "shake the confidence of
our friends abroad."
A wildly-cheering crowd of
more than 3000 in the historic old
Academy of Music roared its ap
proval when Nixon, winding up
his 32-state, 15,000-mile tour, de
cla red:
"I can report to you with con
fidence that President Eisenhow
er will be reelected as President
of the United States."
On Oct. 10 the Vice President
will arrive in California for a
series of speeches in Stockton,
Oakland and San Francisco.

address in Pittsburgh, replied to
the President's charge that Demo
crats were indulging in "wicked
nonsense" in their campaign.
Stevenson quoted Eisenhower
as saying on Monday that the
election will hinge on which party
"has done more to help all Ameri
cans meet the problems of their
daily lives."
Stevenson said this was "a
proper statement."
Future Important
"Of course, what matters is
which party will do more in the
future to help people meet the
always new problems of their
daily lives," Stevenson said in a
speech prepared for delivery at
11 p.m. EDT (CBS network).
"But 1 am sure that is what
the Republican candidate meant,"
he said. "And he is right that
each party's past record offers
the best test of its future, per
formance.
"So if the record is to be the
test, let's get the record straight.
"I think it is too bad that the
President indulged himself in
such a gross misstatement of the
record. I am sure he is an honor
able man and could hardly have
deliberately intended the misrep
resentation which his speech in
cluded."
Nixon Speech
In Philadelphia, Vice President
Richard M. Nixon, cheered by the
biggest crowds of his 16-day cam
paign swing, last night denounced
one of Adlai Stevenson's foreign
policy proposals as "catastrophic
nonsense."
The Vice President, greeted by
thousands at every turn in his
six-hour visit, said Stevenson's
proposal for discontinuing H
bomb tests if Russia will agree
would "shake the confidence of
our friends abroad."
A wildly-cheering crowd of
more than 3000 in the historic old
Academy of Music roared its ap
proval when Nixon, winding up
his 32-state, 15,000-mile tour, de
cla red:
"I can report to you with con
fidence that President Eisenhow
er will be reelected as President
of the United States."
On Oct. 10 the Vice President
will arrive in California for a
series of speeches in Stockton,
Oakland and San Francisco.
Adlai E. Stevenson last night accused President Eisenhower of
"a gross misstatement of the record" in his political speeches at
Cleveland, Ohio, and Lexington, Ky., Monday.
The Democratic presidential candidate, climaxing a day-long
whistle-stop trip across Pennsylvania with a nation-wide television

address in Pittsburgh, replied to
the President's charge that Demo
crats were indulging in "wicked
nonsense" in their campaign.
