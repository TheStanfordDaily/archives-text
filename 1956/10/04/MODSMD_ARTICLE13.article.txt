### 
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 3 (UP) —
Charles G. Johnson, 76-year-old
California Treasurer for 34 years,

sure of illness and a prolonged
word battle with Gov. Goodwin J.
Knight.
Johnson's letter of resignation
to Knight said "I hereby resign
. . . effective Nov. 1, 1956, on ac
count of ill health."
Knight said "I will, of course,
accept the resignation and pro
ceed to appoint a successor as
quickly as I possibly can."
The Knight-Johnson fight broke
into the open June 21 when John
son, in an exclusive interview
with United Press, charged Gov
ernor Knight with promising de
posits of state money in banks in
return for their campaign sup
port.
Denial
Knight denied it and called for
a legislative investigation at
which evidence was uncovered al
leging that Johnson borrowed
sums totaling $30,000 from banks
doing business with the state and
did not pay it back.
This, said Knight, was "influ
ence peddling." Both men are Re
publicans.
"The resignation of the treas
urer was submitted by him com
pletely on a voluntary basis,"
Knight said. "I have not seen or
talked with him for many
months."
Retirement Laws
Under laws governing the re
tirement of constitutional offi
cers, Johnson is entitled to re
tirement pay equal to 40 per cent
of his $14,000 salary, or $466 a
month. .
The 195.1 legislature increased
the treasurer's salary to $17,500
as of the next elective term, j
which boosts Johnson's retire-1
ment pay to $583 a month.
