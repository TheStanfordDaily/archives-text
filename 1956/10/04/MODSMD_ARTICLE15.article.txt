### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 (UP) —
Russia has accepted an invitation
to send observers to this country
for a first-hand look at "the free
electoral processes" at work in
the Presidential campaign, the
State Department said today.
The Soviets also have agreed to
the U.S. suggestion that they in
vite some Americans to witness
Communist - style campaigning
and voting in the next big Rus
sian election.

Embassy in Moscow last Satur
day they would send "two or

er's political battle with Demo
crat Adlai E. Stevenson.
Satellites
State Department spokesman
Lincoln White said t here has
been no reply as yet to similar
invitations issued two weeks ago
to Communist Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Hungary and Romania.
It was considered likely, however,
that the satellites would follow
Russia's lead.
But there was a chance Russia
might not take to the idea of its
satellites being in close contact
with a free election. The United
States has been urging for years
that the Iron Curtain countries
be permitted to hold free elec
tions.
October Arrival
The Russian election observers
are expected to arrive in this
country about Oct. 21 when the
campaign will be reaching its
highest pitch.
Under tentative plans, they
will be taken nn a nationwide
tour to see electioneering tech
niques in the various states. Set
ting out from Washington, they
will cross the South and South
west to Los Angeles and then
head back from San Francisco
via the northern route.
On election day. Nov. 6, the
Russians will be in New York
City where they will watch the
parade to the polls and wait with
millions of Americans for the re
turns to pour in.
At the State Department's sug
gestion. the Civil Aeronautics
Board has approved arrange
ments for Pan American Airways
to fly the Russians to this coun
try free of charge.
If the satellites also send ob
servers, the overall cost to the
government will be about $20,000.

State Department said today.
The Soviets also have agreed to
the U.S. suggestion that they in
vite some Americans to witness
Communist - style campaigning
and voting in the next big Rus
sian election.
The Soviets notified the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow last Satur
day they would send "two or
three" observers to watch the
windup of President Eisenhow
er's political battle with Demo
crat Adlai E. Stevenson.
Satellites
State Department spokesman
Lincoln White said t here has
been no reply as yet to similar
invitations issued two weeks ago
to Communist Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Hungary and Romania.
It was considered likely, however,
that the satellites would follow
Russia's lead.
But there was a chance Russia
might not take to the idea of its
satellites being in close contact
with a free election. The United
States has been urging for years
that the Iron Curtain countries
be permitted to hold free elec
tions.
October Arrival
The Russian election observers
are expected to arrive in this
country about Oct. 21 when the
campaign will be reaching its
highest pitch.
Under tentative plans, they
will be taken nn a nationwide
tour to see electioneering tech
niques in the various states. Set
ting out from Washington, they
will cross the South and South
west to Los Angeles and then
head back from San Francisco
via the northern route.
On election day. Nov. 6, the
Russians will be in New York
City where they will watch the
parade to the polls and wait with
millions of Americans for the re
turns to pour in.
At the State Department's sug
gestion. the Civil Aeronautics
Board has approved arrange
ments for Pan American Airways
to fly the Russians to this coun
try free of charge.
If the satellites also send ob
servers, the overall cost to the
government will be about $20,000.
