# The 						ABC's Crackdown
## 
### 
Many cries of injustice haVe gone up from
Stanford men and women following the recent
crackdown by the Alcoholic Beverage Com
mission. All the old drinking haunts—Ros
sotti's, Kudv's and the like—are tighter than
a drum. The places are actually asking for
and checking identification cards, and liquor
agents are crawling all over the places.
"Why," demand the Stanford citizenry,
"mast these poor souls be prosecuted for some
thing that we have all done at some time or
another ourselves?"
And charges of "dirty pool" have been ad
vanced against the ABC agents. It appears that
three young agents, all about 22, were hired
by (lie ABC to mix with the students, and then
arrested them as soon as their liquor purchases
were made.
I lim main purpose of the ABC is not to catch
minors drinking, lint to prosecute the estab
lishmenls selling them liquor. Frank Fullen
wider, area ABC administrator, says the main
thing to come out of the arrest of the six Stan
lord students will be an attempt to take severe
legal penalties against Rudy's.
, The law definitely states certain facts about
minors and drinking. In California it is illegal
for a minor to purchase any alcoholic beverage
or consume any alcoholic beverage in any on
sale premises. It is also against the law for
anyone under 21 to possess an alcoholic bev
erage 011 any street or highway or to present
any false evidence to obtain an alcoholic
beverage.
Such are the rules, and the ABC is pledged
to enforce them. The crackdown this.early is

especially designed to show that the ABC
means business in its enforcement. All-campus
reunions seem destined to he a thing of the
past.
The rules and their enforcement are far from
ideal. But Stanford students can lessen the
penalties and crackdowns if they do their hest
to cooperate with the ABC.
Stanford in the past has had an informal
arrangement with the ABC. Under-age drink
ers who oiler no resistance when arrested are
usually turned over to the University and Men's
and Women's Councils.-
This policy can he revoked at any time if
students show themselves to he uncooperative
with the ABC in tin! carrying out of their
duties. Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler
says the ABC regards Stanford's student judi
cial set-up as unique and will continue the pro
cedure so long as the councils conduct them
selves in the same fashion.
These are facts. There are rules against
minors drinking, and the ABC is enforcing
them. Fullenwider in a letter to ASSU Presi
dent Boh Freelen has termed all rallies ;uid
reunions as doing "violence to the spirit, if not
the letter, of your own Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code."
This view may seem quite extreme to some,
hut liquor possession hy minors is a violation
of the Fundamental Standard, and the hest
thing for the Stanford student to do is to ab
stain and await that day when he is officially
legal.
The rules may seem unjustly harsh, but ap
parently they will be harsher if cooperation is
not the keynote.
