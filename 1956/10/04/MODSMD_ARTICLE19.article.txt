# Whose iron Curtain?
## 
### 
If we can forget for a moment the barrage
of campaign epithets that are smogging the
atmosphere, it might be well to ponder a sub
ject that is discussed in an article entitled "The
Widening Chinks in the Iron Curtain" in the
current issue of The Reporter magazine.
The thesis of the article is a little embar
rassing, for it suggests, however subtly, that
this country may have a junior-sized iron cur
tain of its own. For once we may he robbing
the Russians of one of their inventions â€”one
we don't need.
It points out that, although the Soviet-Ameri
can exchange is beginning to revive itself, there
have been many instances in which Soviet cul
tural and technical delegations have bumped
head-on into the State Department's frigid
"nyet."
Just to argue an academic point, what is
dangerous about a bunch of Russians looking
at tall Kansas corn, talking with college stu
dents at a football game or meeting with Amer
ican counterparts in their particular business
or profession? What's top-secret about a coun
try fair or a conference on medical techniques?
And why shouldn't our reporters be allowed
to see Red China? We may not recognize its
diplomatic existence, but it is obviously there
600 million strong.

Outside of the fart that it is just plain good
for the state of international affairs, we might
learn something from those wild Bolsheviks
too. And the more we let our little curtain
down, the more inclined the Soviets may he
to carve off some of theirs, considering their
present smile-and-be-friends attitude. For all
we know, some of them may want to he friends,
hut we'll never find out this way.
Besides, what have we to hide? Yes, we
have scientific and military installations, hut,
in the first place, they are well obscured from
even American eyes, and, in the second place,
a you-stay-away-from-our-secrets-and-we'll-stay
away-from-yonrs type of approach might work.
Who knows? It's never been tried.
We boast that our atom bombs are the big
gest and the best. Why not show the doubting
Soviets that our political, economic and social
order is not so bad either.
Certainly men conditioned by a lifetime of
Communist propaganda will not believe our
words, but a good, thorough look at the Ameri
can democratic system at work may at least
cast some worthwhile doubts.
Such an "open-door policy" may take politi
cal gumption, hut that's what successful gov
ernments are built on.
