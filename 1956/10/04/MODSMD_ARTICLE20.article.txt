Suez Debate Continues
Editor,* The Daily:
Sheila Feuchtwang's letter entitled "An An
swer on Suez" (Oct. 2) prompted me to give the
readers more information on the subject.
The assertion that "This agreement (the con
vention of 1888) was observed all through the
Italo-Turkish conflict of 1911, through World
War I and World War II . . is not all true in
the light of historic events.
Tn the first instance, it may be pointed out
that the neutrality of the canal was first broken
by the British in 1882 when, during the Arab re
volt, England surprised nationalist leaders by a
military descent on the canal zone, a descent
which was the prelude to the Battle of Tel-el-
Kabir and the military occupation of the country.
This was the violation which led the Euro
pean powers to raise for the first time the ques
tion of canal neutralization (not internationali
zation). As a result, in the Convention of 1888,
the principle of free navigation was recognized.
Nothing further happened in the matter until
1904. And it was only in that year that under the
Anglo-French Agreement, the British govern
ment agreed to put the Suez Canal Convention of
1888 into force. The neutrality of the canal was
re asserted by the Peace of Versailles in 1918.
The second time the principle of neutrality

was'broken was on Feb. 3, 1914, when the Turk
ish army invaded the country across the canal
from Syria.
Again, the principle of neutrality was seri
ously affected in 193(3 when the article of the
Treaty of Alliance between Egypt and Britain
declared that:
"In view of the fact that the Suez Canal,
whilst being an integral part of Egypt, is a uni
versal means of communications between the
different parts of the British Empire, His Maj
esty the King of Egypt, until such times as the
High Contracting Parties agree that the Egyp
tian army is in a position to ensure by its own
resources the liberty and entire security of navi
gation of the canal, authorises His Majesty the
King and Emperor to station forces in Egyptian
territory in the vicinity of the Canal, with a view
to ensuring, in co-operation with Egyptian
forces, the defence of the Canal."
The protests of Italy against this revocation
of the principle of neutrality were of no avail.
During the second World War, all students
of world history know the right of the free navi
gation of the canal was subordinated once again
to the necessities of defence.
The list of such violations may be very long
as Miss Feuchtwang has already pointed out. I
would, however, leave it to some other students
of history to fill in the gap.

gation of the canal, authorises His Majesty the
King and Emperor to station forces in Egyptian
territory in the vicinity of the Canal, with a view
to ensuring, in co-operation with Egyptian
forces, the defence of the Canal."
The protests of Italy against this revocation
of the principle of neutrality were of no avail.
During the second World War, all students
of world history know the right of the free navi
gation of the canal was subordinated once again
to the necessities of defence.
The list of such violations may be very long
as Miss Feuchtwang has already pointed out. I
would, however, leave it to some other students
of history to fill in the gap.

Suez Debate Continues
Editor,* The Daily:
Sheila Feuchtwang's letter entitled "An An
swer on Suez" (Oct. 2) prompted me to give the
readers more information on the subject.
The assertion that "This agreement (the con
vention of 1888) was observed all through the
Italo-Turkish conflict of 1911, through World
War I and World War II . . is not all true in
the light of historic events.
Tn the first instance, it may be pointed out
that the neutrality of the canal was first broken
by the British in 1882 when, during the Arab re
volt, England surprised nationalist leaders by a
military descent on the canal zone, a descent
which was the prelude to the Battle of Tel-el-
Kabir and the military occupation of the country.
This was the violation which led the Euro
pean powers to raise for the first time the ques
tion of canal neutralization (not internationali
zation). As a result, in the Convention of 1888,
the principle of free navigation was recognized.
Nothing further happened in the matter until
1904. And it was only in that year that under the
Anglo-French Agreement, the British govern
ment agreed to put the Suez Canal Convention of
1888 into force. The neutrality of the canal was
re asserted by the Peace of Versailles in 1918.
The second time the principle of neutrality

was'broken was on Feb. 3, 1914, when the Turk
ish army invaded the country across the canal
from Syria.
Again, the principle of neutrality was seri
ously affected in 193(3 when the article of the
Treaty of Alliance between Egypt and Britain
declared that:
"In view of the fact that the Suez Canal,
whilst being an integral part of Egypt, is a uni
versal means of communications between the
different parts of the British Empire, His Maj
esty the King of Egypt, until such times as the
High Contracting Parties agree that the Egyp
tian army is in a position to ensure by its own
resources the liberty and entire security of navi
gation of the canal, authorises His Majesty the
King and Emperor to station forces in Egyptian
territory in the vicinity of the Canal, with a view
to ensuring, in co-operation with Egyptian
forces, the defence of the Canal."
