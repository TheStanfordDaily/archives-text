# Annual Olympic Day Races Feature Six-Mile Relay
## Senior Men Will Bear Torches Tomorrow In Last of 'Back-to-Farm Week' 
### 
Olympic Day, the last vestige |
of a once-glorious tradition, will
be celebrated tomorrow by a race
of 26 seniors to Mangini's Barn,
carrying a lighted torch.
This festival was once the
grand climax of "Back to the
Farm Week," an annual campus j
reunion which was started in
1940, irr which a whole week was
dedicated to re-introducing Stan
ford students to the faculty, the
campus and each other.
However, in recent years, stu
dent interest in the grand festival
has flagged, according to Bud Mc-
Clellan, chairman of Cardinals,
which has sponsored tire week.
So this year Cardinals decided it
wasn't worth the effort and voted
to drop the project entirely.
Attendance had flagged at such
features as a faculty talent show,
Farm Follies, in which student
officers also participated. Inter
est in student-faculty dinners and
games, and an old car parade re
calling early days of the campus,'
has also dimmed.
Olympic Day has continued to
be popular, however, .so Cardinals
voted to retain it. The event origi
nated in 1945 when competing
seniors raced across Lake Lagu
nita in canoes and then over the
hills to Rossotti's.
This year's spectacle will be
somewhat less unusual. Twenty
six senior men will carry a torch
from the Cellar to Rudy's in a
relay race, each running a quar
ter mile of the six-mile distance.
The race will begin about 3

I p.m. The whole campus has been
invited to turn out to greet the
weary Braves on their arrival.
According to Ihe best reports,
"Back to the Farm Week" started
in 1940 to help celebrate the Uni
versity's fiftieth anniversary.
The first year, "horseless car
riages" were banned from the
campus for the day, students
were required to dress in turn-of
the-century fashions, and other
activities were instituted to re
turn Stanford as much as pos
sible to the atmosphere which en
tering freshmen found here in
1891.
In 1941 the tradition was fur
ther established by a promenade
and dance on Inner Quad. Rec
ords of David Starr Jordan's
speeches were also played and
stereopticon slides of Stanford
history were shown.»
Bud McClellan says that the
eclipse of the week might be only
temporary if student interest re
vives in future years. lie says he
very much hopes that it can be
brought back some day.


OUTDATED —This "horseless carriage" was one
of those participating in the Old Car Parade, a
feature of (he 1954 "Baok-to-the-Farm Week"
sponsored by Cardinals. This ac tivity, along with
such others as the student-faculty lalent show

and games, was voted out by Cardinals this year.
The chairman of the group blamed lack of slu
<l«'nt interest for discontinuing "Back-to-the-Farm
Week." Only the Olympic Day race will be held
this year.
