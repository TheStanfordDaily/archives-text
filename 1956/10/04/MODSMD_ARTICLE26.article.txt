### Jim Palmer 
BEFORE YOU become too engrossed in that second-game tussle j
between the Subway Series contenders this morning, consider the ,
tale of one of Stanford's unsung heroes —the varsity football mana- j
ger.
Here is a man who come II o'clock this morning will lx» wear
ing himself (ami his assistants) to a frazzle trying to get 37 foot
ball wayfarers, a couple of coaches and assorted hangers-011 aboard
a United airliner chartered for Columbus, Ohio.
This maligned individual (some call him a water-boy, others don't j
even bother to call him that) will be busily stuffing 37 helmets into j

a box (which holds only 3(J) with
one hand and counting noses to
discover mislaid team members
with the other.
He'll be adding up shoes and
shoelaces, checking to make sure
nothing is forgotten. While ev
eryone else in the country is
watching Mantle and Furillo, this
guy will be on the job for Stan
ford—a job for which he gets no
pay and even less glory.
His name is Donald Robert
Woodward—"Woody" to his as
sociates—and his task is one of
seldom - publicized dimensions.

! We seek to hereby alter this travesty of justice.
When Woody lands in the Buckeye state tonight he'll have the
team herded up to the plush Deshler-Hilton Hotel wtoile he and his
assistant Jim Newton will trundle the bulky equipment boxes off to
the OSU Stadium. There'll be a practice-as-usual Friday on the
i unfamiliar turf.
The team members, relaxed after the leisurely plane ride during
which they study, sleep or play cards, will be in the mood for some
entertainment. So Woody will dole out dollars from the expense fund
for movie time.
Saturday will come quick and it'll be a busy one for the mana
ger. Getting the equipment in order before game time and admin
istering from water buckets and ice packs during the game itself
are not the only things he'll have on his mind.
He must keep track of the minutes played by each man. And
in a flurry of substitutes this is no small task.
After mopping-tip operations, Woody will relax Saturday night
and get ready lor the trip home Sunday. When he gets back he'll
have to file a list of expenses and a complete itinerary.
During his stay in Columbus, Woody will have a chance to spread
intercollegiate good-will by fraternizing with the Buckeye managers.
"It pays dividends," he confides. "It's always to our advantage
in future years."
With the trip but a memory, he'll be back to the grind again come
Monday afternoon for a routine practice session. Handling equip
ment, helping tiie injured and keeping an eye on the tiniest details.
This is the job for which he will get no financial reimbursement,
except for some complimentary tickets. During the average week
he'll put in at least <10 hours. On trips, double that much.
For what? He explains it this way:
"It's a great tiling to feel like you're a part of the team and
to get to know the players individually. I don't get paid, but the
feeling of being connected with the team is ample reward."
This is the best reply we've seen in a long time to Ronnie Knox's
charge that "College Football Is PRO Football." Mr. Knox, meet Mr.
Woodward.

POSTSCRIPT: Two years ago at Berkeley it was Woody and
associates who tackled Oski and squirted him liberally with seltzer
j water. And it wasn't too long ago that the erstwhile senior manager,
while in apprenticeship, was seen carrying water buckets to the wrong
team. Fortunately this latter mishap was overshadowed by the Los
j Angeles trip return two years ago when, after a frantic search, the
i entire equipment supply for the varsity was found resting comfor
tably at San Francisco Airport where it had been shipped without
the knowledge of the managers. All in a day's work.

SI'ORTS FLASHES —Stanford-Ohio Slate game is KCBS Ra
dio's feature event at 1.0:45 a.m. (also on ABC' Radio) and may
overlap with the fourth World Series game (KRON-TV). Saturday
afternoon video contest is TCU-Arkansas. . . . The doctor has given
the official word on Doder —he'll be able to see action against the
Troy boys on Oct. 'i~. Maybe Coach Chuck will get a chance to
spring big Steve (<>-3, 211 pounds) loose on that tackle-eligible pass
play which picked up 14 yards against WSC. . . . Paul Camera,
the man who scored all of Stanford's points against the Buckeyes
in hist year's (5 0 victory, will make the trip East today despite
having suffered a < racked rib in the MSU ruckus. In case you've
forgotten, the hefty halfback grabbed a pass tossed by Jerry Gus
tufson from the one-yard stripe to beat the Bucks. Trainer Connie
rfarvis says Camera will play Saturday with pads on that rib.
SHOTS IN THE DARK: Yanks to climb back on championship
throne for first time in three years with a six-game Series triumph.
. . . Frankie Albert to pull some surprises against the Rams at
Ke/.ar Sunday, but IHers to still lose by two TD's. . . . Coast squads
! will lose only three of five interseetionals this week end, not four as
I some experts say. . . . Stanford fans will match USC's slogan "8-to-l"
with the snappy, terse and adequate phrase "Fricassee SC." No doubt
the boys down at the corner drugstore will be able to make good
sport of this one. . . . There will be movies of the Ohio State game
shown here Wednesday night under the auspices of Cardinals.

dio's feature event at 1.0:45 a.m. (also on ABC' Radio) and may
overlap with the fourth World Series game (KRON-TV). Saturday
afternoon video contest is TCU-Arkansas. . . . The doctor has given
the official word on Doder —he'll be able to see action against the
Troy boys on Oct. 'i~. Maybe Coach Chuck will get a chance to
spring big Steve (<>-3, 211 pounds) loose on that tackle-eligible pass
play which picked up 14 yards against WSC. . . . Paul Camera,
the man who scored all of Stanford's points against the Buckeyes
in hist year's (5 0 victory, will make the trip East today despite
having suffered a < racked rib in the MSU ruckus. In case you've
forgotten, the hefty halfback grabbed a pass tossed by Jerry Gus
tufson from the one-yard stripe to beat the Bucks. Trainer Connie
rfarvis says Camera will play Saturday with pads on that rib.
SHOTS IN THE DARK: Yanks to climb back on championship
throne for first time in three years with a six-game Series triumph.
. . . Frankie Albert to pull some surprises against the Rams at
Ke/.ar Sunday, but IHers to still lose by two TD's. . . . Coast squads
! will lose only three of five interseetionals this week end, not four as
I some experts say. . . . Stanford fans will match USC's slogan "8-to-l"
with the snappy, terse and adequate phrase "Fricassee SC." No doubt
the boys down at the corner drugstore will be able to make good
sport of this one. . . . There will be movies of the Ohio State game
shown here Wednesday night under the auspices of Cardinals.


DON WOODWARD
BEFORE YOU become too engrossed in that second-game tussle j
between the Subway Series contenders this morning, consider the ,
tale of one of Stanford's unsung heroes —the varsity football mana- j
ger.
Here is a man who come II o'clock this morning will lx» wear
ing himself (ami his assistants) to a frazzle trying to get 37 foot
ball wayfarers, a couple of coaches and assorted hangers-011 aboard
a United airliner chartered for Columbus, Ohio.
This maligned individual (some call him a water-boy, others don't j
even bother to call him that) will be busily stuffing 37 helmets into j

a box (which holds only 3(J) with
one hand and counting noses to
discover mislaid team members
with the other.
He'll be adding up shoes and
shoelaces, checking to make sure
nothing is forgotten. While ev
eryone else in the country is
watching Mantle and Furillo, this
guy will be on the job for Stan
ford—a job for which he gets no
pay and even less glory.
His name is Donald Robert
Woodward—"Woody" to his as
sociates—and his task is one of
seldom - publicized dimensions.

! We seek to hereby alter this travesty of justice.
When Woody lands in the Buckeye state tonight he'll have the
team herded up to the plush Deshler-Hilton Hotel wtoile he and his
assistant Jim Newton will trundle the bulky equipment boxes off to
the OSU Stadium. There'll be a practice-as-usual Friday on the
i unfamiliar turf.
The team members, relaxed after the leisurely plane ride during
which they study, sleep or play cards, will be in the mood for some
entertainment. So Woody will dole out dollars from the expense fund
for movie time.
Saturday will come quick and it'll be a busy one for the mana
ger. Getting the equipment in order before game time and admin
istering from water buckets and ice packs during the game itself
are not the only things he'll have on his mind.
He must keep track of the minutes played by each man. And
in a flurry of substitutes this is no small task.
After mopping-tip operations, Woody will relax Saturday night
and get ready lor the trip home Sunday. When he gets back he'll
have to file a list of expenses and a complete itinerary.
During his stay in Columbus, Woody will have a chance to spread
intercollegiate good-will by fraternizing with the Buckeye managers.
"It pays dividends," he confides. "It's always to our advantage
in future years."
With the trip but a memory, he'll be back to the grind again come
Monday afternoon for a routine practice session. Handling equip
ment, helping tiie injured and keeping an eye on the tiniest details.
This is the job for which he will get no financial reimbursement,
except for some complimentary tickets. During the average week
he'll put in at least <10 hours. On trips, double that much.
For what? He explains it this way:
"It's a great tiling to feel like you're a part of the team and
to get to know the players individually. I don't get paid, but the
feeling of being connected with the team is ample reward."
This is the best reply we've seen in a long time to Ronnie Knox's
charge that "College Football Is PRO Football." Mr. Knox, meet Mr.
Woodward.

POSTSCRIPT: Two years ago at Berkeley it was Woody and
associates who tackled Oski and squirted him liberally with seltzer
j water. And it wasn't too long ago that the erstwhile senior manager,
while in apprenticeship, was seen carrying water buckets to the wrong
team. Fortunately this latter mishap was overshadowed by the Los
j Angeles trip return two years ago when, after a frantic search, the
i entire equipment supply for the varsity was found resting comfor
tably at San Francisco Airport where it had been shipped without
the knowledge of the managers. All in a day's work.

During his stay in Columbus, Woody will have a chance to spread
intercollegiate good-will by fraternizing with the Buckeye managers.
"It pays dividends," he confides. "It's always to our advantage
in future years."
With the trip but a memory, he'll be back to the grind again come
Monday afternoon for a routine practice session. Handling equip
ment, helping tiie injured and keeping an eye on the tiniest details.
This is the job for which he will get no financial reimbursement,
except for some complimentary tickets. During the average week
he'll put in at least <10 hours. On trips, double that much.
For what? He explains it this way:
"It's a great tiling to feel like you're a part of the team and
to get to know the players individually. I don't get paid, but the
feeling of being connected with the team is ample reward."
This is the best reply we've seen in a long time to Ronnie Knox's
charge that "College Football Is PRO Football." Mr. Knox, meet Mr.
Woodward.

POSTSCRIPT: Two years ago at Berkeley it was Woody and
associates who tackled Oski and squirted him liberally with seltzer
j water. And it wasn't too long ago that the erstwhile senior manager,
while in apprenticeship, was seen carrying water buckets to the wrong
team. Fortunately this latter mishap was overshadowed by the Los
j Angeles trip return two years ago when, after a frantic search, the
i entire equipment supply for the varsity was found resting comfor
tably at San Francisco Airport where it had been shipped without
the knowledge of the managers. All in a day's work.

SI'ORTS FLASHES —Stanford-Ohio Slate game is KCBS Ra
dio's feature event at 1.0:45 a.m. (also on ABC' Radio) and may
overlap with the fourth World Series game (KRON-TV). Saturday
afternoon video contest is TCU-Arkansas. . . . The doctor has given
the official word on Doder —he'll be able to see action against the
Troy boys on Oct. 'i~. Maybe Coach Chuck will get a chance to
spring big Steve (<>-3, 211 pounds) loose on that tackle-eligible pass
play which picked up 14 yards against WSC. . . . Paul Camera,
the man who scored all of Stanford's points against the Buckeyes
in hist year's (5 0 victory, will make the trip East today despite
having suffered a < racked rib in the MSU ruckus. In case you've
forgotten, the hefty halfback grabbed a pass tossed by Jerry Gus
tufson from the one-yard stripe to beat the Bucks. Trainer Connie
rfarvis says Camera will play Saturday with pads on that rib.
SHOTS IN THE DARK: Yanks to climb back on championship
throne for first time in three years with a six-game Series triumph.
. . . Frankie Albert to pull some surprises against the Rams at
Ke/.ar Sunday, but IHers to still lose by two TD's. . . . Coast squads
! will lose only three of five interseetionals this week end, not four as
I some experts say. . . . Stanford fans will match USC's slogan "8-to-l"
with the snappy, terse and adequate phrase "Fricassee SC." No doubt
the boys down at the corner drugstore will be able to make good
sport of this one. . . . There will be movies of the Ohio State game
shown here Wednesday night under the auspices of Cardinals.


DON WOODWARD
BEFORE YOU become too engrossed in that second-game tussle j
between the Subway Series contenders this morning, consider the ,
tale of one of Stanford's unsung heroes —the varsity football mana- j
ger.
Here is a man who come II o'clock this morning will lx» wear
ing himself (ami his assistants) to a frazzle trying to get 37 foot
ball wayfarers, a couple of coaches and assorted hangers-011 aboard
a United airliner chartered for Columbus, Ohio.
This maligned individual (some call him a water-boy, others don't j
even bother to call him that) will be busily stuffing 37 helmets into j

a box (which holds only 3(J) with
one hand and counting noses to
discover mislaid team members
with the other.
He'll be adding up shoes and
shoelaces, checking to make sure
nothing is forgotten. While ev
eryone else in the country is
watching Mantle and Furillo, this
guy will be on the job for Stan
ford—a job for which he gets no
pay and even less glory.
His name is Donald Robert
Woodward—"Woody" to his as
sociates—and his task is one of
seldom - publicized dimensions.

! We seek to hereby alter this travesty of justice.
When Woody lands in the Buckeye state tonight he'll have the
team herded up to the plush Deshler-Hilton Hotel wtoile he and his
assistant Jim Newton will trundle the bulky equipment boxes off to
the OSU Stadium. There'll be a practice-as-usual Friday on the
i unfamiliar turf.
The team members, relaxed after the leisurely plane ride during
which they study, sleep or play cards, will be in the mood for some
entertainment. So Woody will dole out dollars from the expense fund
for movie time.
Saturday will come quick and it'll be a busy one for the mana
ger. Getting the equipment in order before game time and admin
istering from water buckets and ice packs during the game itself
are not the only things he'll have on his mind.
He must keep track of the minutes played by each man. And
in a flurry of substitutes this is no small task.
After mopping-tip operations, Woody will relax Saturday night
and get ready lor the trip home Sunday. When he gets back he'll
have to file a list of expenses and a complete itinerary.
During his stay in Columbus, Woody will have a chance to spread
intercollegiate good-will by fraternizing with the Buckeye managers.
"It pays dividends," he confides. "It's always to our advantage
