# TOPS AT END
## Van Galder Is Key in Farm's Passing Attack 
### Ted Heckathorn 
According to many observers,
one of the top ends in the Pacific-
Coast-Conference this season is
Gary Van Galder, Stanford 189-
pound fleet-footed end.
Last year Van Galder caught
20 passes for 232 yards and two
touchdowns as his teammates
voted him the "outstanding soph
omore" on the team. This year
he has already caught seven pass
es and recovered a key fumble in
the Michigan State game last
week end.
Ohio State "Tough"
Van Galder, who leaves today
for Columbus and Saturday's con
test with the Buckeyes, thinks
"Michigan State has a good team,
but Ohio State will be just as
tough with their running attack,
maybe even better."
In high school Van Galder play
ed quarterback for La Crosse,
Wisconsin, and later for Fresno
High. On the Stanford frosh team
he began in the backfield but was
shifted to end, where he is cur
rently playing.
He comes from a football-mind
ed family. His father, Clark, is
the head coac-h of Fresno State
College, and his brother Bob will
be playing for Stanford next year.
Lettered in KusketlniU
Van Galder also lettered in bas
ketball. He is a member of Delta
Tau Delta and was recently mar
ried in the Stanford Chapel.
As a physical education major,
he plans to coach after gradua
tion. His wife, Joanne, is an ex-
UC student and is currently em
ployed at Stanford.
