## 
### 
BROOKLYN, Oct. 3— (UP) -
Brooklyn's wvarthv Sal (The Bar
ber) Maglie', pitching with his
heart, his head and a weary arm.
took a three-run cushion from the
home-run hat of Gil Hodges and
shaved the mighty Now York
Yankees, (! to 3, today to win the
opening game of the World Se
ries.
In the second game of the Se
ries tomorrow, again here at Eb
bets Field, Don Larsen will pitch
against Don Newcombe. who has
a 27-7 mark for the season. Game
time is 9 a.m. i PST).
The 39-year-old Maglie, regard
ed as a "washed-up has-been" last
spring, thrilled a crowd of 34,479
—which included President Eisen
hower and former President Hoo
ver—as he yielded two home runs
but continually pitched his way
out of other heart-stopping Yan
kee threats to complete a dra
matic victory.
The scowling Barber, stagger
ing on the verge of a knockout
at least three times, yielded a two
run homer to Mickey Mantle and
one to scrappy Billy Martin. But
his underdog teammates came

through with a pair of homers
themselves, one by Jackie Robin
son and a three-run blast by
Hodges, and the veteran right
hander took it from there.
The grim, unsmiling Maglie
gave up nine big hits to booming
Yankee bats, but he also fanned
10 of those menacing Bronx
Bombers.
Meanwhile, his mates quickly
proved once again that Ebbets
Field is a southpaw's graveyard
by pounding little Whitey Ford
into defeat after a three-inning
stint in which he gave up six of
the nine Brooklyn hits and five
of those six runs.
The Yankees bounced into a
quick two-run lead in the first
inning, shortly after Eisenhower
had made the first presidential
World Series opening pitch since
1936. It came on Mantle's boom
ing shot over the right field wall
with old Country Slaughter on
first.

The scowling Barber, stagger
ing on the verge of a knockout
at least three times, yielded a two
run homer to Mickey Mantle and
one to scrappy Billy Martin. But
his underdog teammates came

through with a pair of homers
themselves, one by Jackie Robin

Hodges, and the veteran right
hander took it from there.
The grim, unsmiling Maglie
gave up nine big hits to booming
Yankee bats, but he also fanned

proved once again that Ebbets
Field is a southpaw's graveyard
by pounding little Whitey Ford
into defeat after a three-inning
stint in which he gave up six of
the nine Brooklyn hits and five
of those six runs.
The Yankees bounced into a
quick two-run lead in the first
inning, shortly after Eisenhower
had made the first presidential
World Series opening pitch since
1936. It came on Mantle's boom
ing shot over the right field wall
with old Country Slaughter on
first.
