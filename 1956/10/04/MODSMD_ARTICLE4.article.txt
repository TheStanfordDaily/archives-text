# Male Rooters Back At Cal
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. (UP) â€”
University of California offi
cials put the segregation (males
only) rule back in effect in the
traditional men's rooting sec
tion today. But made it plain
that the girls will be back if
the boys don't behave them
selves.
The executive committee of
the Associated Students of UC
broke up the all-male rooting
section last spring after long
complaints of had conduct and
worse language by members.
A dozen or so courageous
young women joined the male
section at the start of the Bay
lor game, Sept. 22, but most of
them retired with their ears
burning after a short time.
The ASUC executives voted
last night to restore the all male
status "on a trial basis" for
C'al's game with Pittsburgh this
Saturday.
