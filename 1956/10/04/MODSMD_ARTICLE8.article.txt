Bob Freelen, Frank Fullenwider,
local director of the Alcoholic
Beverage Commission, said "we
are informed that other official
functions are planned which, in
the normal course, will result in
wholesale violations of law.
No Alternative
"However, if literally hundreds
of violations are to occur at li
censed premises or in conjunc
tion with the acts of a licensee of
this department, we have no al
ternative but to enforce the law."
Fullenwider also charged that
official student functions which
feature alcoholic beverages as
part of their program are viola
tions of the spirit, if not the let
ter, of the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code.
Student Violations
Moanwhile, the six students ar
rested last week end at Rudy's
will probably appear before Men's
Council. Dean William Craig said
yesterday afternoon that no new
developments have arisen in the
case, but that he has recommend
ed that Men's Council handle the
affair.
Students have been advised in
a publication prepared by. the
Fundamental Standard and Hon
or Code Commission to refrain
from any act which might violate
the Fundamental Standard. Any
violation of the ABC Act is also
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard, according to the Com
mission's interpretation.
