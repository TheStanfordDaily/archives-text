# British Speaker Calls Suez 'A Classic Example'
## Shows How International Problem Should Not Be Handled; Russia Behind Nasser's Moves 
### 
British Information .Service Director Donald Stokes yesterday
called the Suez ( anal problem "a classic example of how interna
tional affairs should not be handled."
Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd of 90, Stokes appeared
in Bowman Alumni House in the year's first Institute of Interna-

tional Relations consular talk.
Egypt, Stokes said, seized the
canal because the nation was
"mortgaged up to the neck to
Russia" and hoped to use Suez
tolls to finance the Aswan Dam.
The Soviets also played a largo
part in the actual canal seizure,
he said.
"Shepilov," Stokes related,
"practically lived in Nasser's pal
ace, and there is good reason to
believe ho called the shots in the
power play."
In general, Russia has increased
its Middle East advantages,
Stokes said.
Islam Sympathetic
"Islamic powers are much more
sympathetic to Russia than we
would believe possible," the for
mer newspaperman declared.
Stokes pointed out that Gen.
Abrlel Nasser is running his new
possession in efficient manner.
"But," emphasized the British of
ficial, "as Time magazine said,
'Nasser cannot be counted on to
keep his promise to allow free
dom of passage through the
canal'."
In nationalizingâ€”or, as Stokes
preferred to say, "expropriating"
the Suez Canal, Egypt violated
the international character of the
waterway and a 60 - year agree
ment to keep it open.
Egypt had been receiving one
third of the Suez profits, although
the nation "did practically noth
ing to build the canal."
Suez Important to Us
"The Suez Canal situation,"
Stokes emphasized, "is a matter
of considerable importance to the
United States." Owning one-half
of Middle Eastern oil resources,
the U.S. in 1955 shipped over
eight million tons of oil through
the gigantic 105-mile-long water
way.
"Any solution to the problem
must be done in wholehearted
concert with the United States,"
Stokes said. At this point the
speech was interrupted by about
25 blasts from the fire-warning
horn.
