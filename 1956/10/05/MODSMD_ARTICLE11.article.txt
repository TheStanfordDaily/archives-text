### Helen Dewar Editor 
After a vpt of virtual non- j
function. ASSU Cabinet mot last
nijzht, took a scrutinizing look at I
the reason for its being and then 1
tool' action.
After a long discussion about
what the Associated Students
should do about the problem ere-;
ated by the crackdown of the Al- j
coholic Beverages Commission,
the body voted to draw up a rec-1
ommendation for submission to
the effect that:
"Legislature (take) action pro
viding that the ASSU shall not
sanction or encourage any func- |
tion in which persons under 21 !
are to participate in activities j
held on premises where alcoholic j
beverages are to be sold or served ,
to members of said party."
Cabinet Approval
Final wording of the recom- |
mendation will be worked out I
over the weekend and submitted !
for final approval by the Cabinet !
on Tuesday. If approved then, it |
will be submitted to Legislature j
Wednesday.
Consensus of the group was |
that the ASSU must not approve
any student activity involving
minors on premises where liquor
is served, but that when a pri
vate party is held, it must be up
to a person's individual responsi
bility under the law and the Fun
damental Standard as to whether
he shall drink or not.
End of Reunions
If put into effect, the plan
would mark the end of campus
reunions at local beer gardens
and any other such ASSU - ap
prover! function held where liquor
is served to minors.
Cabinet felt as a whole that the
problem was of such serious di
mensions to both the students
and the University that immedi
ate and drastic action was imper
ative to prove to the ABC that
Stanford was willing to cooper
ate.
Cabinet members including
Steve Tallent, administrative as
sistant to ASSU President Bob
Freelen and cabinet chairman,
emphasized that problems would
arise in the scheduling anrf hold
ing of social functions, but that
Cabinet was dealing with the sub
mission of an idea or "starting
recommendation."
ASSU Constitution
This action was in line with the
philosophy of the body developed
earlier in the evening. Under the
ASSU Constitution, the Cabinet
"shall assist the president in the
executive co-ordination of ASSU
actiivties and shall advise him on
student government and its pro
gram."
Cabinet viewed its function as
that of serving both as an advis
ory board to draft and submit
recommendations to Legislature
ami as an organ of co-ordination
among'student activities.
ft would act as an "idea forum"
where problems of general inter
est and importance are discussed
and lines of action drawn up.

mendation will be worked out I

vate party is held, it must be up
to a person's individual responsi
bility under the law and the Fun
damental Standard as to whether
he shall drink or not.
End of Reunions
If put into effect, the plan
would mark the end of campus
reunions at local beer gardens
and any other such ASSU - ap
prover! function held where liquor
is served to minors.

problem was of such serious di
mensions to both the students
and the University that immedi
ate and drastic action was imper
ative to prove to the ABC that
Stanford was willing to cooper
ate.
Cabinet members including
Steve Tallent, administrative as
sistant to ASSU President Bob
Freelen and cabinet chairman,
emphasized that problems would
arise in the scheduling anrf hold
ing of social functions, but that
Cabinet was dealing with the sub
mission of an idea or "starting
recommendation."
