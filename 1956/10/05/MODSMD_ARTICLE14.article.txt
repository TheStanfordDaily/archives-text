# Stevenson Tells Harlem Rally Truman Started Integration
## Move in 1948 to End Segregation in Armed Forces Deemed Troublesome by General Ike 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 4 (UP) Adlai E. Stevenson told a Harlem rally
tonight that former President Truman sounded the "death knell of
segregation in the armed forces" in 1948 despite the opposition of
President Eisenhower.
Stevenson said that Eisenhower, then chief of staff, testified

before a congressional commit toe j
on April 2, 1948, that "complete j
desegregation in the armed forces j
would, as he put it, get us 'into!
trouble'."
Despite that testimony, Steven
said, Truman issued his exec
utive order No. 9981 on July 26,
1948, that provided integration of
the armed forces.
Stevenson, obviously answering
Republican charges that the Dem
ocratic party and Its nominee are
captives of Southern Democratic
segregationists, said the progress
America has made in the field of
civil rights has been due in the
main to the leadership of the
Democrats.
"We have seen nothing more
brazen in the entire record of He-1
publican misrepresentation in this
campaign than the Republican of-1
fort to seize partisan credit for
progress in civil rights," he said.
Stevenson arrived here tonight j
from Elkins, W. Va., where he
called for stronger conservation
policies and charged that public
lands have been invaded and turn- 1
ed to selfish, private purpose.
With him at the Harlem rally
were Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, re
tiring Sen. Herbert Lehman,!
Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who is
a candidate for Lehman's post;
Gov. Averell Harriman and Man- 1
hat tan Borough President Hulan
Jack.
Stevenson told the predomi
nantly Negro audience in front
of the Theresa Hotel that under
the Republican Administration
this country has had "four years
of shuffling and postponement
four years of 'time out' in the
battle for expanding human dig
nitv."
