# SU Warriors Hoping To Topple Buckeyes In Saturday's Clash
## Linemen Loss Could Retard Indian Attack Staters Are Seeking To Avenge 6-0 Loss Suffered Last Year 
### Jack Rannells 
The Cards have been cleared
from the table and the deck re
shuffled.
Tomorrow afternoon, Stan
ford's Chuck Taylor will deal the
third hand in the 1956 version of
football rummy. Across the green
velvet of Ohio State's 80,000-seat
stadium will be sitting one of the
sharpest men at the game, Coach
Woody Hayes of Ohio State Uni
versity.
True, the stakes are not as high
as they could be. The game is
inter-league in nature, having no
bearing on the final league stand
ings of either team. Neverthe
less, both squads are committed
to causes of vendetta.
Buckeyes llpset
Ohio State's Buckeyes, 6-0 up
set losers to the Indians last sea
son, cannot afford to lose to a
PCC team.in Ohio. Though they
have annexed two consecutive un
disputed Big Ten championships
and 13 straight conference
games any loss on the home
grounds is bad business. The Co
lumbus "booster clubs" are the
paragons of this modern-day phe
nomenon.
Stanford, too, can regain pres
tige lost in the 21-7 loss to Michi
gan State last week if it can re
peat last season's stunning per
formance. PCC prestige, after
last week's 0-4 record in intersee
tionals with the Big Ten, is also
at stake.
Taylor vs. Hayes
The style of play of both head
men is well known. Taylor is par
tial to the face cards, the high
powered stuff which is geared to
win quickly and, incidentally, is
very colorful; Hayes prefers the
"sure" game, the low cards which
can win just as readily but are
not so apt to count against him.
The success of the Buckeye
"third down-and-one" outfits of
the past two seasons, which com
bined a short-gain offense with
an iron defense, has threatened
to revolutionize the collegiate
football picture.
Running from the split-T or
flankered-T formations, the Ohio
offense is unique in its low num
ber of passes and its relentless
pounding at the opponents' line.
In nine games last season, OSU
tried only 51 passes, completing
17 for 162 yards. The running
game netted 2504 yards during
the same period at a rate of 4.9
yards per carry. That Hayes has
learned no new tricks between
seasons is evidenced by the fart
that the Buckeyes rushed for 416
yards while completing only two
passes in their 34-7 rout of Ne
braska last Saturday.
Hayes' football teams are con
sistently built around "forward
walls" or groups of backs, units
rather than individuals. Notable
exceptions are Howard "Hopa
long" Cassady of the 1953*55
squads and Jim Parker, guard


INTERCEPTED PASS —Paul Camera, outstanding pass-snagging
halfback, pulls in an Ohio State pass in the intersectional headliner
here last year. The aerial, intended for .ferry Harkriwler, stopped
the last of the Buckeye threats as the Indians upset OSU, fi-0.
linebacker veteran of the past
two years who is back for his
senior year.
Parker All-American
Colliers' pre • season selection
for 1956 Lineman of the Year and
a UP second-team All-American
last season, the 6-3 251-lb. Parker
is being counted on to lead the
Buckeyes in their quest for an
unprecedented third straight
Western Conference crown.
Parker, who averaged S(J min
utes of football each game last
year; end-tackle Bill Michael, also
a 50-minute "iron man"; ends Leo
Brown and Fred Kriss, and tackle
Dick Guy are the only Buckeye
linemen with a great deal of ex
perience.
Reports that the Buckeyes
have the heaviest line in the his
tory- of collegiate football are
true only when reserves are
played. It was against these
"man-mountains" that Nebraska
rati up most of its 185 yards
rushing.
Cassaday Missing
Fabled Hopalong Qissady is
the only member missing from
the If),");") first back field which av
eraged 4.68 yards per try. Jim
Roseboro, who was second to Cas
sady wilh a 6.1 average; fullback
Don Vicic, who was not thrown
for a loss in 63 carries and aver
aged 4.3, and quarterback Frank
Ellwood averaged 4.3 yards as a
unit last season.
Sophomore halfback Don Clark,
who ran the ball nine times for
99 yards and two 'J'D's Saturday
in his premiere performance,
would seern to be a suitable re
placement for "floppy." That he
can go for the distance is attested
to by the fact that his two scores
were on runs of 35 and 38 yards.
Chuck Taylor is currently in
the middle of a hard-luck streak
with the Cards. Three of his aces,
Steve Doeter, Bob Long and Noel
Robinson, are at the bottom of
the deck and may not be on top
again for several shuffles. There
are so many others on the par
tially disabled li«t that it makes
one weary to keep count.
Brodie on Deck
Nevertheless, quarterback John
Brodie, PGC passing lander and
runner-up in total offense so far
this season, is on deck and eager
to make up for the "faint spell"
which staggered him against
Michigan State. John's 27 com
pletions in 43 attempts and his
three touchdown tosses are tops
for the circuit. His 280 yards to
tal offense leaves him a scant
four yards short of USC's C. It.
Robert in that category.
The Indian backfield of Brodie,
Camera, Young and is in
tact. The line has been patched
and repatched. However, if Stan
ford is to repeat last year's sur
priser, Coach Taylor is going to
have to wield an awfully "hot"
deck tomorrow afternoon.
Till that time we can only wait
and hope it's in the Cards.

POWERFUL BUCKEYE —Don Vicie, veteran 222-pound fullback,
is one of a fine crop of running backs ready to taunt the Cards
in tomorrow's clash at Columbus. A powerful, grinding ground
attack, similar to the one Michigan State unveiled last week, has
been the Buckeyes' attack for the past several seasons. Other top
OSU backs are Jim Roseboro, Don Clark, Frank Ellwood and Don
Sutlierin. Missing, though, is Howard "Hopalong" Cassady, last
year's Heisman Trophy winner.
