# SU Warriors Hoping To Topple Buckeyes In Saturday's Clash
## Linemen Loss Could Retard Indian Attack Staters Are Seeking To Avenge 6-0 Loss Suffered Last Year 
### Jack Rannells 
The Cards have been cleared
from the table and the deck re
shuffled.
Tomorrow afternoon, Stan
ford's Chuck Taylor will deal the
third hand in the 1956 version of
football rummy. Across the green
velvet of Ohio State's 80,000-seat
stadium will be sitting one of the
sharpest men at the game, Coach
Woody Hayes of Ohio State Uni
versity.
True, the stakes are not as high
as they could be. The game is
inter-league in nature, having no
bearing on the final league stand
ings of either team. Neverthe
less, both squads are committed
to causes of vendetta.
Buckeyes llpset
Ohio State's Buckeyes, 6-0 up
set losers to the Indians last sea
son, cannot afford to lose to a
PCC team.in Ohio. Though they
have annexed two consecutive un
disputed Big Ten championships
and 13 straight conference
games any loss on the home
grounds is bad business. The Co
lumbus "booster clubs" are the
paragons of this modern-day phe
nomenon.
Stanford, too, can regain pres
tige lost in the 21-7 loss to Michi
gan State last week if it can re
peat last season's stunning per
formance. PCC prestige, after
last week's 0-4 record in intersee
tionals with the Big Ten, is also
at stake.
Taylor vs. Hayes
The style of play of both head
men is well known. Taylor is par
tial to the face cards, the high
powered stuff which is geared to
win quickly and, incidentally, is
very colorful; Hayes prefers the
"sure" game, the low cards which
can win just as readily but are
not so apt to count against him.
The success of the Buckeye
"third down-and-one" outfits of
the past two seasons, which com
bined a short-gain offense with
an iron defense, has threatened
to revolutionize the collegiate
football picture.
Running from the split-T or
flankered-T formations, the Ohio
offense is unique in its low num
ber of passes and its relentless
pounding at the opponents' line.
In nine games last season, OSU
tried only 51 passes, completing
17 for 162 yards. The running
game netted 2504 yards during
the same period at a rate of 4.9
yards per carry. That Hayes has
learned no new tricks between
seasons is evidenced by the fart
that the Buckeyes rushed for 416
yards while completing only two
passes in their 34-7 rout of Ne
braska last Saturday.
Hayes' football teams are con
sistently built around "forward
walls" or groups of backs, units
rather than individuals. Notable
exceptions are Howard "Hopa
long" Cassady of the 1953*55
squads and Jim Parker, guard


INTERCEPTED PASS —Paul Camera, outstanding pass-snagging
halfback, pulls in an Ohio State pass in the intersectional headliner
here last year. The aerial, intended for .ferry Harkriwler, stopped
the last of the Buckeye threats as the Indians upset OSU, fi-0.
