BELGRADE, Oct. 4 — (UP) —
Communist delegations-from the
satellite and western European
nations appeared to be lining up
today for talks with President
Tito when he returns from his
mystery trip to the Soviet Union.
Commu n is t leaders from
France, Italy, Romania and Bul
garia were reported eager to
meet with Tito, but separately
rather than as a group.
In addition, informed sources
here said representatives of Hun
gary and other countries will ar
rive in Yugoslavia before the end
of the year on previously sched
uled visits.
There was no official word on
when Tito would return from his
secret talks with Soviet Commu
nist Party Chief Nikita Khrush
chev and Premier Nikolai Bul
ganin in the Soviet Crimea. But
it was believed here he would be
back in a few days.
(The Soviet Tass news agency,
in a dispatch from Yalta received
in London, said Tito had returned
from a three-day hunting trip
with Khrushchev and other Com
munist leaders. The two - para
graph announcement was the
first direct word of Tito in two
days.)
Yugoslavs, who are politically
minded in most cases, think the
talks with the Soviet leaders will
not end with Tito's return. Per
sistently circulated reports say
the conference is not going very
smoothly.
