# Ike's a Politician Too
## 
### 
Presidents running for a second term are,
in effect, two men in one body.
While still the national leader and symbol
of American will, the President is as much of
a partisan political figure as his opponent, and,
as a party candidate, must take both blame
and praise for his actions.
This applies to President Eisenhower as it
would to any other President—Republican or
Democrat—although there are several in his
party who still see him perched on a snowy
white c]oud far above the mundane hassle of
campaign rivalry.
New York's ex - governor and hard-hitting
GOP campaigner Thomas Dewey recently flew
at the Democrats, feathers all aflutter, for drag
ging Eisenhower into the political campaign.
"Frankly," he said in a nation-wide televi
sion address, "I am getting disgusted by the
low blows that are being thrown at the Presi
dent. ...
"Four years ago, you and I asked General
Eisenhower to come home ;md clean up the
mess in Washington.
"He accepted our call and has done a won
derful job..
"So what is his reward? The opposition can
didates are going up and down the country
throwing insults at the President and his ad
ministration and, just lately, even at his family.
"I think you will agree that the President
deserves better treatment. We have heard
enough of this drivel."
Governor Dewey seems to think that Eisen
hower is above partisan reproach and that the
Democrats are committing a moral sin for
pointing out what in their opinion have been

tlie serious failures of the Eisenhower Admin
istration.
This lias been the philosophy of other Re
publican leaders, such as Vice-President Rich
art! Nixon and GOP Chairman Leonard Hall,
but their efforts Ifcive been of little success, for
the President himself has jumped apparently
wholeheartedly into something of a give-'em
liell type of campaign.
Hot words such as "deceit and mockery" and
"wicked nonsense" have been applied by Eisen
hower to Democratic candidate Adlai Steven
son's policies, and words to the same effect have
been used on the other side. A slight amount
of political hyperbole is to be expected in any
campaign so long as it does not degenerate to
vicious nunlslinging of the type that completely
buries the issues at stake.
Eisenhower has proved himself very much
of a politician during the past four years, and
the aura of the "amateur in politics" is wearing
thin. He is a politician and should he treated
as one.
During the pre-convention months many
worried that the key issues among them the
vital question of leadership strength in the
domestic and foreign fields—would never see
the light of day.
They feared that the "father image" of Eis
enhower would completely becloud vital issues
to the detriment of the voters themselves.
lo a great extent, this image has been cast
off for the duration of the campaign. One of
the reasons may be that the Republicans are
"running scared" in the light of many evi
dences that their strength is not as great as it
was once thought to he, but, whatever the rea
son may be, it's encouraging to see a real, live
political campaign once again.
