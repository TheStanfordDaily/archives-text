They'll Drink Anyway
Editor, The Daily:
If a minor is going to drink, can the law stop
him?
I feel that if a person is going to drink, he will
find some way of obtaining liquor regardless of
the heavy enforcement of the ABC or any other
agency.
The recent crackdown of the ABC on "estab
lished Stanford beer gardens" has only resulted
in forcing the under-age drinkers to travel farther
for their drinking.
My father once made it clear to me that if I
wanted to drink 1 could, but to do my drinking
at home. When I drank at home my father knew
where I was. I did not have to drive off to some
secluded spot in the foothills. I was not wander
ing all over town getting into trouble.
I this same idea would apply well to
Stanford. Most of the drinking around this area
went on at the old spots on Alpine Road, where
Stanford students have -been drinking for years.
The University know where the majority of its
students were when they were drinking. The
ABC knew also.
Now that these places are no longer available,
students are going to go to the City, out on Bay
shore, along El Camino. This I feel will result
in far more trouble than ever before, for both the
University and the ABC.
Students are not going to stop drinking and
having parties just because of the crackdown on
Alpine Road. They'll find a way to get' around
the liquor enforcement and have their drinking
elsewhere. Maybe they'll have to drive farther,
and get in a few more wrecks on Bayshore or
El Camino, but they'll find places.
The ABC has only created a major problem
whore no problem existed before. I feel that the
students, with the help of the University, can get
the ABC to accept a hands-off policy on Alpine
Road. There was never trouble before, so why

should the ABC start something that will only
lead to more problems for both them and the
University?

Suez: The Underlying Causes
Editor, The Daily:
I think it most unfortunate that recent writers
of "Letters to the Editor" have cast shadows upon
the academic integrity of Dr. Harris' statements
when they themselves neglect to include consid
eration of nationalism, the internal politics of
Egypt, as well as the fact that the U.S. Congress
forced Colonel Nasser to take the steps he did.
As Dr. Harris is the most qualified person to
speak on the Middle East in this area, it might
be well to understand the value of her remarks.
No one has yet challenged her to write further
on the underlying causes of the Suez crisis which,
to he*-, have only been inferred. The Arab-Israeli
dispute itself and pressures on the U.S. Congress
and State Department are examples.
The Daily quoted Dr. Harris as having said the
U.S. acted "insultingly." I would venture a guess
that she, as a former State Department official,
did not say this, but said that U.S. actions were
taken as an insult by Egypt.
This interpretation, however, by the reporter
also leads me to believe that underlying pressures
have not been stated but only inferred.
I would ask The Daily to give space to consid
eration of problems such as these rather than
the log of ships passing through the canal.
After all, "no Western nation has even ques
tioned Egypt's right to nationalize the canal."
Perhaps then we might understand the real
problem.

Ed. Note: According to Dr. Harris, slie was
misquoted as saying that the United States acted
"insultingly." Her meaning was, she said, that
the United States had "withdrawn the offer of
aid in equivocal terms."
