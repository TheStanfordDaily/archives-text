### 
Horseless carriages, sports
cars, foreign cars, classics, hot
rods and Abigail Van Buren of
the San Francisco Chronicle will
be feature attractions Sunday in
Hillsborough at "a" Concours
d'Elegance.
This high-sounding event will
feature an exhibition of vehicles
and an answering of "innermost
problems" by Miss Van Buren,
Chronicle columnist.
