# Courageous Cook Douses Lag Fire
## 
### 
Two fire trucks rushed to La
gunita yesterday at 5 p.m. in an
swer to an alarm turned in when
a grease fire broke out in the
kitchen.
A cook aimed a carbon dioxide
bomb at the blaze, however, and
the flames were practically gone
by the time the firemen arrived.
There was only slight damage
noted.
