# Behavioral Study Center Offers Research Work
## Young Advance Research Outer Bases Success On Original Study and Mutual Education 
### 
High on a hill a mile west of the
campus proper stands a group of
modern buildings which house
the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences. This
Institution, little known by Stan
ford students, is now entering its
third year of existence.
Curious students may have
wondered what part of the Ford
Foundation was housed here,
whose presence the directional
traffic signs on campus indicate.
The Behavioral Studies Center is
an independent nonprofit institu
tion which was originally en
dowed by the Ford Foundation.
It is now incorporated and under
its own board of directors. The
traffic signs misnomer is largely
caused by the length of the cor
rect name of the organization.
Ford Grant
The concept of the center was
originally outlined by a planning
committee of scientists who then
submitted their plan to the Ford
Foundation. In 1952 the founda
tion made a $3Vs million appro
priation to establish the center.
The board of directors was ap
pointed, including a majority of
university men connected with
the various fields of behavioral
sciences.
Chairman of I ho board is Frank
Stanton, president of the Colum
bia Broadcasting System and a
trained psychologist who has
conducted numerous rose a r c h
projects in the field of mass me
dia.
After the appointment of the
board, a full year was devoted to
planning the program and meth
od of procedure for the center. It
opened with 36 fellows in Sep
tember of 1954.
Careful Selection
Since that time the number of
fellowships has increased to 50.
They are selected through a care
ful nomination, screening and in
terview system on the basis of
past work and future promise in
their fields. These post-doctorate
fellows work in such fields as an
thropology, political science, psy
chiatry, sociology, statistics, eco
nomics, psychology, neurology,
linguistics and other related
fields.
Each scholar and his family is
moved to California to take up
residence in this area. The Cen
ter p;iys the salary the scholar
would receive in his position in
his university, giving him a year
free for study while enabling" the

university to hire a replacement.
No instructional staff is em
ployed by the center; the empha
sis is placed on individual study
and communication with other
scholars in related fields.
No Faculty
Each fellow has his own office,
and some time is spent reading
and doing research in areas in
which the scholar feels a need for
more information.
Group work, mostly in small
discussion groups and joint work
projects, enables the scholars to
become acquainted with other
students in his field and with
work currently being done in that
field.
Administrative and secretarial
aid is supplied to the fellows. Af
ter the first year, fellows wrote
evaluations of their year at the
center. These essays revealed that
four types of study activities were
favored: individual work, infor
mal conversations with other fel
lows, small working groups, and
short courses of formal instruc
tion dealing with subjects needed
by the students participating and
taught by a center student well
trained in the field.
Five Years
The original Ford grant to the
center was made large enough to
cover five years of operation. At
the end of five years of operation
the center will close, unless addi
tional grants are made by the
foundation.
Final decision on this appropri
ation will be based on the evalu
ations of the fellows and the
opinions of their home university
departments.

story building, the center was de

Bernardi and Emmons. The ex

Ford Grant
The concept of the center was
originally outlined by a planning
committee of scientists who then
submitted their plan to the Ford
Foundation. In 1952 the founda

The board of directors was ap

university men connected with
the various fields of behavioral
sciences.
Chairman of I ho board is Frank
Stanton, president of the Colum

trained psychologist who has
conducted numerous rose a r c h
projects in the field of mass me

After the appointment of the
board, a full year was devoted to
planning the program and meth

opened with 36 fellows in Sep

Since that time the number of
fellowships has increased to 50.
