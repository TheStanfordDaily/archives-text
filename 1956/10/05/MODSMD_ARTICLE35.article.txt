# FANTASTIC FLAIR FOR MURDER
## Child's Homicide Streak Sets Breathless Pace In Suspense-Packed Drama 'The Bad Seed' 
### Richard Lamb 
"The Bad Seed" is not a very
well written play, though it was
a mild success on Broadway two
years ago. The movie reproduc
tion now holding forth at the
Stanford Theatre has acquired
some additional flaws in the
transition from the stage. Yet it
is unquestionably a cool, at times
terrifying, piece of suspense.
A precocious little darling with
a flair for homicide is the cause
of all the bother. It seems that
every time a major crisis enters
her life, such as losing the pen
manship medal at school to a
classmate, she meets it head-on
by knocking off whoever happens
to annoy her. Before you can say
Jack - the - Ripper, the unwary
stiffs number classmate, janitor
and a helpless old woman. All
this is believable, thanks to the
accomplished morbidness of 10-
year-old Patty McCormack.
Inherited Tendencies
But then the plot takes a turn
for the fantastic. Patty's mother,
Nancy Kelly, discovers that her
mother was a murderess of some
stature, and fears that Patty has
inherited her talent from Grand
ma. Pounding her abdomen in a
fit of maternal frustration, she
decides to give Patty an overdose
of sleeping pills, which she does
and then she shoots herself
through the head. If you want
to enjoy the picture, you will
leave now, because the ending

that follows is a little hard to
stomach.
In the play, some neighbors
who heard the shot rushed Patty
to a hospital where she heaved
up the pills to go on to bigger
and better atrocities without Ma
ma's scolding. In the current edi
tion, Miss Kelly also recovers, in
credibly. While she lies repent
ant in the hospital, her daughter
plots a fourth murder. But Good
Triumphs, and on a sinister mid
night reconnaissance to the lake
where she drowned her penman
ship rival, Patty is struck down
by a symbolic bolt of lightning.
As the words "The End" creep
hesitatingly on the screen, Little
Miss Maniac is still smouldering
on the boat pier.
Excellent Photography
Director Mervyn Le√üoy has
apparently tried to keep the mov
ie as much like a stage play as
possible, right down to the post
mortem curtain call. Most of the
action takes place in one room,
in and out of which the players
make entrances and exits with
little fluidity. The acting as a
whole is technically more akin to
the stage than to motion pictures.
Excellent photography, however,
greatly improves several of the
wordy scenes thai are left intact
from the original script.
Miss Kelly gives an absorbing
performance that is only occa
sionally marred by a theatrical
artificiality. She is being pushed

for the Academy award in some
quarters. Hut when, in moments
of excitement, her voice repeat
edly squeaks higher and higher
as though striving for some mys
tic note, then climaxes in a
choked gurgle followed by con
vulsive sobbing, one feels that
she may experience similar pain
on Oscar night next March. In
more tender moments, she is in
deed moving.
The supporting cast is also su
perior, with special praise due
Eileen Heckart. She literally
makes a role out of alcoholic gib
berish.
