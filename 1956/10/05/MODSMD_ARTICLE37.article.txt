# Looking It Over
## 
### 
With Jerry Kelly

Before publishing spoils columns dealing with the status of the
Pacific Coast Conference in reference to "the role of the alumni,"
"the mess at UCLA" and the "conference presidents at work," a look
at the Western Conference, home of the nation's top football teams,
might be advantageous.
The Big Ten, as it's more popularly known, not only harnesses
ihe cream of the crop in the populated Midwest, but also ropes players
who starred in high schools throughout the Eastern states. Scores

of intersectional games and post
war Rose Bowl victories give Big
Ten teams superiority over all
other sectional conferences.
As yet, the Western Confer
ence hasn't experienced a major
shake-up. Mixed emotions have
staved off any drastic actions this
year, but it has been noted that
either a house cleaning or a code
revision is in order.
The "case of the PCC" may
have made Big Ten administra
tors give change a second
thought.
Stanford's worthy opponent to
morrow, Ohio State, took the only
rap handed out thus far in the
Midwest. State is ineligible to
participate in the Rose Bowl come
Jan. 1. Regardless of the penalty,
the Buckeyes are co-favorites to
co}) all honors in the Big Ten.
The Indians, marred by injuries
'his week, face a revengeful Ohio
State eleven. The Buckeyes, led
by All-American Howard "Hopa
long" Cassady, came to Palo Alto

early last year rated one of Ihe best in the nation and a "sure-fire"
Big Ten champ. In a nationally televised game, the Tribe lassoed
"Iloppy" and his teammates, G to 0.
OSU Coach Woody Ilayes, despite hand-slapping, has put together
another potent squad which includes All-American candidates Frank
Ellwood, back; Jim Parker, guard, and Bill Michael, end. "Replacing
Cassady," Hayes said, "is our greatest problem."
MICHIGAN STATU CO-CHAMPS
Favored as co-champions in the "Conference of Champions" is a
team well known to Stanford followers, Michigan State. Off to his
greatest season yet, Coach Duffy Daugherty leads his team against
MSU's biggest rival and probably toughest opponent of the season,
the University of Michigan.
Tomorrow's tussle could make or break Michigan's hopes for a
Rose Bowl invitation. The Spartans surely won't be able to glide
through the remainder of their schedule. In addition to regular Big
Ten foes, the Staters face a revengeful Notre Dame outfit in South
Bond.
WOLVERINES ROSE BOWL FAVORITES
With MSU currently riding Ihe No. 2 spot in the latest national
football poll, Michigan trails close behind in the No. 4 position. The
Wolverines, also using the multiple offense—effectively displayed
last Saturday by MSIJ in Stanford Stadium—lack the halfback ma
terial found on Michigan State's lineup.
Coach Bennie Oosterbaan has 21 returning lettermen, led by Ron
Kramer, All-American end; Terry Barr, back, and Tom Maentz, end.
The Wolverines rate as first choice in Rose Bowl selections, since
Michigan State played in Pasadena last year and Ohio State is
ineligible.
ILLINOIS UP THERE
An experienced backfiold led Illinois in a dramatic comeback last
Saturday in a 32-to-20 win over California. Halfbacks Harry Jefferson
and Bob Mitchell, fullback Ray Nitschke and quarterback Hiles Stout
give Coach Ray Eliot a glimpse of Roses. The Illini trek to Seattle
tomorrow for a top Coast attraction against the up-and-down Huskies
of Washington.
MINNESOTA MAY SURPRISE
One of the big surprises in the Big Ten this year may be the
Minnesota Gophers, already on the winning trail with an impressive
34-to-14 win over Washington, a traditional rival. Coach Murray
Warmath, in the building process for the pas*t two seasons, is a prime
advocate of the split "T" and has a pair of expert quarterbacks—
Bob Cox, an ex-Husky from Washington, and Jim Reese, a former
Fordham performer.
DAWSON PITCHING FOR PURDUE
With All-American Len Dawson pitching the pigskin, the Purdue
Boilermakers are also rated a "dark horse" and cannot be discounted.
Dawson has led the "talent-grabbing" Big Ten in forward passes and
total offense for two years.
lOWA STARTED WELL
lowa, a 26-to-0 victor over Indiana last Saturday, is another Mid
western outfit primed for action against a PCC opponent tomorrow.
The Hawkeyes meet Oregon State—minus the Beavers' star back,
Sam Wesley—at Corvallis. Coach Forrest Evashevski, noted for com
ing up with a good team with little material, has 16 lettermen re
turning and could well scare some of the "top dogs."
THREE TO TAKE RAP
Some teams must take the beating, even in the Big Ten. This
season three outfits are picked to take the rap. They are North
western, Indiana and Wisconsin. The trio, probably tops in any other
conference, must take the back seat in the "majors."

With MSU currently riding Ihe No. 2 spot in the latest national
football poll, Michigan trails close behind in the No. 4 position. The
Wolverines, also using the multiple offense—effectively displayed
last Saturday by MSIJ in Stanford Stadium—lack the halfback ma
terial found on Michigan State's lineup.
Coach Bennie Oosterbaan has 21 returning lettermen, led by Ron
Kramer, All-American end; Terry Barr, back, and Tom Maentz, end.
The Wolverines rate as first choice in Rose Bowl selections, since
Michigan State played in Pasadena last year and Ohio State is
ineligible.
ILLINOIS UP THERE
An experienced backfiold led Illinois in a dramatic comeback last
Saturday in a 32-to-20 win over California. Halfbacks Harry Jefferson
and Bob Mitchell, fullback Ray Nitschke and quarterback Hiles Stout
give Coach Ray Eliot a glimpse of Roses. The Illini trek to Seattle
tomorrow for a top Coast attraction against the up-and-down Huskies
of Washington.
MINNESOTA MAY SURPRISE
One of the big surprises in the Big Ten this year may be the
Minnesota Gophers, already on the winning trail with an impressive
34-to-14 win over Washington, a traditional rival. Coach Murray
Warmath, in the building process for the pas*t two seasons, is a prime
advocate of the split "T" and has a pair of expert quarterbacks—
Bob Cox, an ex-Husky from Washington, and Jim Reese, a former
Fordham performer.
DAWSON PITCHING FOR PURDUE
With All-American Len Dawson pitching the pigskin, the Purdue
Boilermakers are also rated a "dark horse" and cannot be discounted.
Dawson has led the "talent-grabbing" Big Ten in forward passes and
total offense for two years.
lOWA STARTED WELL
lowa, a 26-to-0 victor over Indiana last Saturday, is another Mid
western outfit primed for action against a PCC opponent tomorrow.
The Hawkeyes meet Oregon State—minus the Beavers' star back,
Sam Wesley—at Corvallis. Coach Forrest Evashevski, noted for com
ing up with a good team with little material, has 16 lettermen re
turning and could well scare some of the "top dogs."
THREE TO TAKE RAP
Some teams must take the beating, even in the Big Ten. This
season three outfits are picked to take the rap. They are North
western, Indiana and Wisconsin. The trio, probably tops in any other
conference, must take the back seat in the "majors."


IIOPALONG CASSADY
From the "Majors" to the Pros
With Jerry Kelly

Before publishing spoils columns dealing with the status of the
Pacific Coast Conference in reference to "the role of the alumni,"
"the mess at UCLA" and the "conference presidents at work," a look
at the Western Conference, home of the nation's top football teams,
might be advantageous.
The Big Ten, as it's more popularly known, not only harnesses
ihe cream of the crop in the populated Midwest, but also ropes players
who starred in high schools throughout the Eastern states. Scores

of intersectional games and post
war Rose Bowl victories give Big
Ten teams superiority over all
other sectional conferences.
As yet, the Western Confer
ence hasn't experienced a major
shake-up. Mixed emotions have
staved off any drastic actions this
year, but it has been noted that
either a house cleaning or a code
revision is in order.
The "case of the PCC" may
have made Big Ten administra
tors give change a second
thought.
Stanford's worthy opponent to
morrow, Ohio State, took the only
rap handed out thus far in the
Midwest. State is ineligible to
participate in the Rose Bowl come
Jan. 1. Regardless of the penalty,
the Buckeyes are co-favorites to
co}) all honors in the Big Ten.
The Indians, marred by injuries
'his week, face a revengeful Ohio
State eleven. The Buckeyes, led
by All-American Howard "Hopa
long" Cassady, came to Palo Alto

early last year rated one of Ihe best in the nation and a "sure-fire"
Big Ten champ. In a nationally televised game, the Tribe lassoed
"Iloppy" and his teammates, G to 0.
OSU Coach Woody Ilayes, despite hand-slapping, has put together
another potent squad which includes All-American candidates Frank
Ellwood, back; Jim Parker, guard, and Bill Michael, end. "Replacing
Cassady," Hayes said, "is our greatest problem."
MICHIGAN STATU CO-CHAMPS
Favored as co-champions in the "Conference of Champions" is a
team well known to Stanford followers, Michigan State. Off to his
greatest season yet, Coach Duffy Daugherty leads his team against
MSU's biggest rival and probably toughest opponent of the season,
the University of Michigan.
Tomorrow's tussle could make or break Michigan's hopes for a
Rose Bowl invitation. The Spartans surely won't be able to glide
through the remainder of their schedule. In addition to regular Big
Ten foes, the Staters face a revengeful Notre Dame outfit in South
Bond.

Before publishing spoils columns dealing with the status of the
Pacific Coast Conference in reference to "the role of the alumni,"
"the mess at UCLA" and the "conference presidents at work," a look
at the Western Conference, home of the nation's top football teams,
might be advantageous.
The Big Ten, as it's more popularly known, not only harnesses
ihe cream of the crop in the populated Midwest, but also ropes players
who starred in high schools throughout the Eastern states. Scores

of intersectional games and post
war Rose Bowl victories give Big
Ten teams superiority over all
other sectional conferences.
As yet, the Western Confer
ence hasn't experienced a major
shake-up. Mixed emotions have
staved off any drastic actions this
year, but it has been noted that
either a house cleaning or a code
revision is in order.
The "case of the PCC" may
have made Big Ten administra
tors give change a second
thought.
Stanford's worthy opponent to
morrow, Ohio State, took the only
rap handed out thus far in the
Midwest. State is ineligible to
participate in the Rose Bowl come
Jan. 1. Regardless of the penalty,
the Buckeyes are co-favorites to
co}) all honors in the Big Ten.
The Indians, marred by injuries
'his week, face a revengeful Ohio
State eleven. The Buckeyes, led
by All-American Howard "Hopa
long" Cassady, came to Palo Alto

early last year rated one of Ihe best in the nation and a "sure-fire"
Big Ten champ. In a nationally televised game, the Tribe lassoed
"Iloppy" and his teammates, G to 0.
OSU Coach Woody Ilayes, despite hand-slapping, has put together
another potent squad which includes All-American candidates Frank
Ellwood, back; Jim Parker, guard, and Bill Michael, end. "Replacing
Cassady," Hayes said, "is our greatest problem."
MICHIGAN STATU CO-CHAMPS
Favored as co-champions in the "Conference of Champions" is a
team well known to Stanford followers, Michigan State. Off to his
greatest season yet, Coach Duffy Daugherty leads his team against
MSU's biggest rival and probably toughest opponent of the season,
the University of Michigan.
Tomorrow's tussle could make or break Michigan's hopes for a
Rose Bowl invitation. The Spartans surely won't be able to glide
through the remainder of their schedule. In addition to regular Big
Ten foes, the Staters face a revengeful Notre Dame outfit in South
Bond.
WOLVERINES ROSE BOWL FAVORITES
With MSU currently riding Ihe No. 2 spot in the latest national
football poll, Michigan trails close behind in the No. 4 position. The
Wolverines, also using the multiple offense—effectively displayed
last Saturday by MSIJ in Stanford Stadium—lack the halfback ma
terial found on Michigan State's lineup.
Coach Bennie Oosterbaan has 21 returning lettermen, led by Ron
Kramer, All-American end; Terry Barr, back, and Tom Maentz, end.
The Wolverines rate as first choice in Rose Bowl selections, since
Michigan State played in Pasadena last year and Ohio State is
ineligible.
ILLINOIS UP THERE
An experienced backfiold led Illinois in a dramatic comeback last
Saturday in a 32-to-20 win over California. Halfbacks Harry Jefferson
and Bob Mitchell, fullback Ray Nitschke and quarterback Hiles Stout
give Coach Ray Eliot a glimpse of Roses. The Illini trek to Seattle
tomorrow for a top Coast attraction against the up-and-down Huskies
of Washington.
MINNESOTA MAY SURPRISE
One of the big surprises in the Big Ten this year may be the
Minnesota Gophers, already on the winning trail with an impressive
34-to-14 win over Washington, a traditional rival. Coach Murray
Warmath, in the building process for the pas*t two seasons, is a prime
advocate of the split "T" and has a pair of expert quarterbacks—
Bob Cox, an ex-Husky from Washington, and Jim Reese, a former
Fordham performer.
DAWSON PITCHING FOR PURDUE
With All-American Len Dawson pitching the pigskin, the Purdue
Boilermakers are also rated a "dark horse" and cannot be discounted.
Dawson has led the "talent-grabbing" Big Ten in forward passes and
total offense for two years.
lOWA STARTED WELL
lowa, a 26-to-0 victor over Indiana last Saturday, is another Mid
western outfit primed for action against a PCC opponent tomorrow.
The Hawkeyes meet Oregon State—minus the Beavers' star back,
Sam Wesley—at Corvallis. Coach Forrest Evashevski, noted for com
ing up with a good team with little material, has 16 lettermen re
turning and could well scare some of the "top dogs."
THREE TO TAKE RAP
Some teams must take the beating, even in the Big Ten. This
season three outfits are picked to take the rap. They are North
western, Indiana and Wisconsin. The trio, probably tops in any other
conference, must take the back seat in the "majors."
