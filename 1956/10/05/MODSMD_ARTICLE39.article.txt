# Series Resumes Today; Newcombe, Larsen Set
## Big Newk Seeks to Snap Jinx in 'Big Ones'; Bronx Bombers Still Choice of Odds-Makers 
### 
BROOKLYN, Oct. 4 (UP)— Rain today postponed the World Series
for the first time in five years to provide a restful break for the
weary Brooklyn Dodgers and a 24-hour delay in the second-game
battle between big Don Newcombe and Don Larsen of the New York
Yankees.
Commissioner Ford C. Frick ordered the postponement at water-

soaked Ebbets Field "to protect
the fans against a shortened ball
game," and the agreeing manag
ers, Casey Stengel and Walter Al
ston, said it would not alter their
plans.
Thus it still will be the burly
Newcombe, a 27 - game winner
seeking to conquer his jinx in
"the big ones," against the un
predictable Larsen, an 11-game
winner, before a capacity crowd
expected to include Democratic
presidential candidate Adlai Ste
venson.
Dodger Break
Nor did the delay—although it
was considered a break for a
Dodger team exhausted by an ar
duous pennant fight—alter the
odds.
The Yankees still were rated
11-to-10 favorites with the delayed
second game remaining an "even
money" pick-'em affair.
Newcombe, who had complain
ed yesterday he could use another
day's rest, ran for a half hour in
the rain and said that on second
thought the delay might bother
his control.
"I like to stay in a steady pitch
ing routine, and with the extra
day's rest I might lose that pin
point control," he insisted.
"It makes no difference to me,
one way or the other," Larsen
observed laconically.
Alston figured the extra day's
rest would be a big factor toward
helping veteran Sal Maglie, who
won the opening game, 6-3.
Newcombe's Control
"But it may hurt Newcombe's
control because with extra rest he
sometimes is inclined to get wild,"
he asserted. "Besides, it might
hurt our hitting. We've been hot
and I'd like to keep 'em that
way."
Alston said he would move Gil
Hodges and Sandy Amoros up to
fifth and sixth in the batting
order, dropping Carl Furillo and
Roy Campaneila to seventh and
eighth respectively.
Stengel was emphatic in his,
opinion that the postponement
was a break for the Dodgers.
"Brooklyn needs the rest after
that tough pennant race," he ar
gued. "We didn't."
The Yankee skipper said he
planned to bench third baseman
Andy Carey and first baseman
Bill Skowron, who were one-for
three and hitless-for-four at bats
respectively in the first game.
"I was gonna make these
changes when we got home any
way," Stengel asserted as he pre
pared to shift Billy Martin from
second to third and install Gerry
Coleman at second and Joe Col
lins at first.
The second game, delayed by
the rain-out, still will be played
at Ebbets Field. The scene then
will shift to Yankee Stadium a
day later than scheduled, with all
tickets simply set back a day.

Nor did the delay—although it
was considered a break for a
Dodger team exhausted by an ar
duous pennant fight—alter the
odds.
The Yankees still were rated
11-to-10 favorites with the delayed
second game remaining an "even
money" pick-'em affair.
Newcombe, who had complain
ed yesterday he could use another
day's rest, ran for a half hour in
the rain and said that on second
thought the delay might bother
his control.
"I like to stay in a steady pitch
ing routine, and with the extra
day's rest I might lose that pin
point control," he insisted.
"It makes no difference to me,
one way or the other," Larsen
observed laconically.
Alston figured the extra day's
rest would be a big factor toward
helping veteran Sal Maglie, who
won the opening game, 6-3.
Newcombe's Control
"But it may hurt Newcombe's
control because with extra rest he
sometimes is inclined to get wild,"
he asserted. "Besides, it might
hurt our hitting. We've been hot
and I'd like to keep 'em that
way."
Alston said he would move Gil
Hodges and Sandy Amoros up to
fifth and sixth in the batting
order, dropping Carl Furillo and
Roy Campaneila to seventh and
eighth respectively.
Stengel was emphatic in his,
opinion that the postponement
was a break for the Dodgers.
"Brooklyn needs the rest after
that tough pennant race," he ar
gued. "We didn't."
The Yankee skipper said he
planned to bench third baseman
Andy Carey and first baseman
Bill Skowron, who were one-for
three and hitless-for-four at bats
respectively in the first game.
"I was gonna make these
changes when we got home any
way," Stengel asserted as he pre
pared to shift Billy Martin from
second to third and install Gerry
Coleman at second and Joe Col
lins at first.
The second game, delayed by
the rain-out, still will be played
at Ebbets Field. The scene then
will shift to Yankee Stadium a
day later than scheduled, with all
tickets simply set back a day.
BROOKLYN, Oct. 4 (UP)— Rain today postponed the World Series
for the first time in five years to provide a restful break for the
weary Brooklyn Dodgers and a 24-hour delay in the second-game
battle between big Don Newcombe and Don Larsen of the New York
Yankees.
Commissioner Ford C. Frick ordered the postponement at water-

soaked Ebbets Field "to protect
the fans against a shortened ball
game," and the agreeing manag
ers, Casey Stengel and Walter Al
ston, said it would not alter their
plans.
Thus it still will be the burly
Newcombe, a 27 - game winner
seeking to conquer his jinx in
"the big ones," against the un
predictable Larsen, an 11-game
winner, before a capacity crowd
expected to include Democratic
presidential candidate Adlai Ste
venson.
