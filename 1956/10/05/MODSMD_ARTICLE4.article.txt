# Egyptian Move Could Cause Canal Blockage
## 
### 
PORT SAID. Egypt, Oct. 4
(UP) Egyptian authorities have
cut off local currency to British
shipping agents in a move thai
could lead to a complete holdup
of British shipping going through
the Suez Canal, it was reported
tonight.
The Egyptian action, taken as
a retaliatory measure against the
British b1 o c k in g of Egyptian
funds in the United Kingdom,
faced agents here with a finan
cial crisis.
Under new regulations, all for
eign currency transfers in Egypt
now must bo sanctioned by ex
change control authoritiesâ€”and
sterling transfers are being
turned down.
This means shipping agents
here no longer can draw local
currency for sterling deposited
in blocked accounts in London.
As a result, British shipping
agents, who handle approximate
ly 40.per cent of the canal traffic,
no longer can pay local bills and
currently are operating on huge
bank overdrafts.
One shipping firm has dis
patched its managing director to
London to ask the Bank of Eng
land to amend the freeze regula
tions to permit convertible ster
ling to be made available for Brit
ish companies here and keep
canal traffic going.
Otherwise, agents may have to
close down and British ships
might have to be diverted from
the canal.
The agents' outlay for British
ships runs into thousands of
pounds weekly, all of which must
be remitted from London.
Each ship transiting the canal
must pay at least $560 for harbor
fees, mooring charges, lights and
quarantine dues. Bunkering, wa
tering and stores charges can run
as high as $14,000.
