## Stanford's Tall End Wrenches Vertebra; Possibly Out for Year 
### Fred Cropper 
Stanford Indians' bad luck hex
continues with the fourth of last i
week's starting linemen, end Jer- j
ry Beatie, out for at least a part
of the football season.
The other three Indian linemen
who will not be playing in to
morrow's game are guard Noel
Robinson, center Bob Long and
tackle Steve Docter.
Beatie has sustained a com
pressed vertebra in the neck re
gion. Trainer Connie Jarvis re
ported. and doctors say that he
may not be able to play ball the
rest of this season.
The injury was supposedly in
curred when Beatie was hu»t in
last week's Michigan Slate fray.
His doctors think that it is a re
currence of an old injury of
which Beatie had not been aware.
Beatie, a senior, was a regular
and very fine performer last sea
son after having spent his sopho
more year with the Brave squad.
He was second only to the great
pass-grabbing end John Stewart
in minutes played among the
ends in 1955.
At the end of last year's season
he was fourth on the Stanford
squad in pass catching, with 16
I receptions for 174 yards and sev
} enth in the Pacific Coast Confer-
I ence.
In the Washington State and
Michigan State games, Beatie
played outstanding ball and was
highly commended by the coach
ing staff. •
Beatie's loss will be a hin
drance to the Indian squad, and
coaches and players alike hope
that he may be able to play at
least the last part of this season.
