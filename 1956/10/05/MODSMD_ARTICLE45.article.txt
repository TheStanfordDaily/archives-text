## 
### 
Ohio State's former All-Ameri- (
can. Dave Leggett, leads a host 1
of ex-college all-stars against the'
Stanford Braves Saturday after
noon at Hamilton Field Air Base.
The JV coach. Mai Elward, T
sends an eager eleven against
one of the top service teams on
the Pacific coast. Hamilton, one
of Fort Ord's strongest oppo
nents, edged the Braves last vear,
27-13.
In their second encounter of the
season, the Braves go Saturday
in top physical shape. The JV's
sustained no injuries last week
while licking Moffett Air Base,
43-6.
Getting the nod for the starting
quarterback spot is Les Hopkins,
with Steve Resnick and Jim Sin
nerude set to go at the halfback
positions. Wally Honeywell, scor
ing from his fullback slot, is ex
pected to open at that position.
Another tjop prospect in the
backfield raiaks is halfback Roy
Stephen, a possible starter. Ste
phen romped for three* TD's
against Moffett Fiolfl in runs of
53, 14 and onve yard.
In the line, the Braves will

have Dick Stein and, Jim Upkina
at the ends, Sam Nagely and Wes
Idol at tackles. Ralph Koldinger
and Don Waldrum at guards and
Pete Swanson at center.
The passing of Hopkins and
Bob Nicolet will be heavily relied
upon in the Elward offensive set
up. Similar to the Stanford var
sity the Braves throw the
ball on many occasions, mixing
the drives with line plays and end
sweeps.
Hamilton Air Force Base, load
ed with college players now in
the service, will be led by the
passing and running of Leggett.
Latest reports place the Ilamil
tons in top shape for the fracas.
