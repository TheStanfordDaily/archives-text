# Modern, Feminine Decorations Give 'New Look' to Roble and Lagunita
## Multi-colored Decor Produces 'Home-like' Atmosphere in Dorms 
### 
A new look greeted the girls of
Roble Hall and Lagunita Court
this fall.
Not to be outdone by the pastel
walls of the new Florence Moore
Hall, carpenters, painters and in
terior decorators redid the tradi
tional dorms during the summer
months to conform to modern
feminine standards.
Betty Kendall, nationally
known "color" expert of the San
Francisco interior decoration
firm of Kendall Associates, was
hired by the University to give a
more "home-like" atmosphere to
the dorms.
Yarborough
According to Dr. John Yarbor
ough, Director of Residences, col
or was the key around which the
redecoration took place. Some of
the lounges at Lagunita have as
many as nine or ten different col
ors in them.
The hallways and rooms are
done in two complementary col
ors. Examples of some of the
combinations used are green and
pink, grey and pink, green and
brown, aqua and gold, brown and
gold, yellow and green.
These colors are combined and
re-combined in an endless varia
tion but all tending to comple
ment the colors of adjacent
rooms and the intervening hall
way. Yarborough pointed out
that the colors plans for each
case are diferent to give a "feel
ing of originality."
Rubber Rugs
Another significant change at
Lagunita is the addition of rugs
in the hallways made of a sponge
rubber base with a nylon cover.
A familiar complaint of Lag
women over the years has been
the long bare coridors wbich
echoed loudly during quiet hours.
The lobby also has the "new
look" with the addition of a
Spanish style fountain surround
ed by turquoise cushions. Golrl
tapestries adorn the walls and

the turquoise and gold color
scheme is picked up and supple
mented by the draperies.
Adelpha lounge furnishes an
example of what has taken place
in all the lounges. The walls are
yellow, the upholstery is brown
and burnt orange and a daring
note is added by a pink brick
fireplace.
The old high back sofas have
been cut down and rebuilt, sav
ing 30 to 40 per cent while add
ing a low modern look to the
lounges. Patio furniture is also
cut down and repainted cocoa
brown with pink and turquoise
upholstery.
Yarborough said, "Our whole
concept was to give a warmer
feeling and one of unity, an atti
tude that 'this is my house.' "
Sally Wolfe, '59, added, "I love
it. In fact I know a lot of girls

who would rather live here than
anywhere else."
Beryl Ingram, '58, said. "I like
it very much. It was a big sur
prise to come back to these pastel
walls and double colors make it
much more modern.
The redecoration at Roble was
not as extensive as that at Lagu
nita. Most of the changes are in
the large lobby, which has a pas
tel pink, turquoise and black col
or scheme.
The biggest surprise in the
room is the addition of a tur
quoise grand piano and a tur
quoise telephone desk. The wood
en furniture has been cut down
and repainted black.
Mrs. Ruby Hughes, new direc
tor of Roble, said, "It's dainty
and feminine. I think that's what
the girls like about it."

and feminine. I think that's what
the girls like about it."


THIS SPANISH FOUNTAIN with turquoise cushions was one of
the most striking innovations fouud in Lagunita Court after sum
mer renovation of the women's dorm. The entire building was
repainted in the interior with pastel colors.
A new look greeted the girls of
Roble Hall and Lagunita Court
this fall.
Not to be outdone by the pastel
walls of the new Florence Moore
Hall, carpenters, painters and in
terior decorators redid the tradi
tional dorms during the summer
months to conform to modern
feminine standards.
Betty Kendall, nationally
known "color" expert of the San
Francisco interior decoration
firm of Kendall Associates, was
hired by the University to give a
more "home-like" atmosphere to
the dorms.
Yarborough
According to Dr. John Yarbor
ough, Director of Residences, col
or was the key around which the
redecoration took place. Some of
the lounges at Lagunita have as
many as nine or ten different col
ors in them.
The hallways and rooms are
done in two complementary col
ors. Examples of some of the
combinations used are green and
pink, grey and pink, green and
brown, aqua and gold, brown and
gold, yellow and green.
These colors are combined and
re-combined in an endless varia
tion but all tending to comple
ment the colors of adjacent
rooms and the intervening hall
way. Yarborough pointed out
that the colors plans for each
case are diferent to give a "feel
ing of originality."
Rubber Rugs
Another significant change at
Lagunita is the addition of rugs
in the hallways made of a sponge
rubber base with a nylon cover.
A familiar complaint of Lag
women over the years has been
the long bare coridors wbich
echoed loudly during quiet hours.
The lobby also has the "new
look" with the addition of a
Spanish style fountain surround
ed by turquoise cushions. Golrl
tapestries adorn the walls and

the turquoise and gold color
scheme is picked up and supple
mented by the draperies.
Adelpha lounge furnishes an
example of what has taken place
in all the lounges. The walls are
yellow, the upholstery is brown
and burnt orange and a daring
note is added by a pink brick
fireplace.
The old high back sofas have
been cut down and rebuilt, sav
ing 30 to 40 per cent while add
ing a low modern look to the
lounges. Patio furniture is also
cut down and repainted cocoa
brown with pink and turquoise
upholstery.
Yarborough said, "Our whole
concept was to give a warmer
feeling and one of unity, an atti
tude that 'this is my house.' "
Sally Wolfe, '59, added, "I love
it. In fact I know a lot of girls

who would rather live here than
anywhere else."
Beryl Ingram, '58, said. "I like
it very much. It was a big sur
prise to come back to these pastel
walls and double colors make it
much more modern.
The redecoration at Roble was
not as extensive as that at Lagu
nita. Most of the changes are in
the large lobby, which has a pas
tel pink, turquoise and black col
or scheme.
The biggest surprise in the
room is the addition of a tur
quoise grand piano and a tur
quoise telephone desk. The wood
en furniture has been cut down
and repainted black.
Mrs. Ruby Hughes, new direc
tor of Roble, said, "It's dainty
and feminine. I think that's what
the girls like about it."
