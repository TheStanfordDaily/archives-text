# Sen. Kefauver Names Nixon As 'Heir Apparent' of GOP
## Says Dewey Assigned 'Low Road' Tactics By Republican Brass in Attempt to Stop Adlai 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4 (UP) Sen. Estes Kefauver opened fire
on Vice-President Richard M. Nixon today on the Vice-President's
home grounds and saifl Nixon would be the "heir apparent" in an
other GOP administration.
The Democratic vice-presidential nominee made Nixon a major

target in an energetic day of cam
paigning here. He also fired a
campaign salvo at former New
York Governor Thomas Dewey.
At a news conference, soon
after flying into California from
Santa Fe, N.M., Kefauver said
it had "apparently" been decided
by "the Republican high com
mand" that Dewey "will be the
one to take the low road this
time."
Kefauver made the statement
when asked to comment on a
radio-TV speech in which Dewey
- twice an unsuccessful GOP
candidate for the Presidency
called Democratic candidate Ad
lai E. Stevenson an "ill informed,
impulsive and mediocre" man
and complained of "low blows"
against President Eisenhower.
The senator said he suspects
Dewey is "indulging in that tac
tic" because Stevenson has been
making "real headway" in his
campaign. Kefauver said since
Democrats are on the road to vic
tory, "I expect we can look for
more underhanded statements
from Mr. Dewey."
At his news conference, the
senator renewed his suggestion
made early in the campaign that
Nixon apologize "to the people he
has damaged" with statements
made in the past. He said those
statements are an issue in this
campaign and will continue to be
one.
Nixon, Kefauver conceded, has
not used "vituperation and name
calling" in the present campaign.
But Kefauver said it is not now
clear whether "election measles"
or a "genuine change is respon
sible."
At a rally in Ihe Los Angeles
garment district, Kefauver said
Nixon will be "heir apparent" in
any new GOP administration be
cause President Eisenhower
could not succeed himself a'sec
ond time under Ihe 22nd consti
tutional amendment.'
The predominantly labor audi
ence booed the first mention of
Nixon's name. The gathering,
mostly garment workers, cheered
Kefauver's attack on N i xo n ' s
votes "against housing" and for
the Taft-Hartley law.

time."
Kefauver made the statement
when asked to comment on a
radio-TV speech in which Dewey
- twice an unsuccessful GOP
candidate for the Presidency
called Democratic candidate Ad
lai E. Stevenson an "ill informed,
impulsive and mediocre" man
and complained of "low blows"
against President Eisenhower.
The senator said he suspects
Dewey is "indulging in that tac
tic" because Stevenson has been
making "real headway" in his
campaign. Kefauver said since
Democrats are on the road to vic
tory, "I expect we can look for
more underhanded statements
from Mr. Dewey."
At his news conference, the
senator renewed his suggestion
made early in the campaign that
Nixon apologize "to the people he
has damaged" with statements
made in the past. He said those
statements are an issue in this
campaign and will continue to be
one.
Nixon, Kefauver conceded, has
not used "vituperation and name
calling" in the present campaign.
But Kefauver said it is not now
clear whether "election measles"
or a "genuine change is respon
sible."
At a rally in Ihe Los Angeles
garment district, Kefauver said
Nixon will be "heir apparent" in
any new GOP administration be
cause President Eisenhower
could not succeed himself a'sec
ond time under Ihe 22nd consti
tutional amendment.'
The predominantly labor audi
ence booed the first mention of
Nixon's name. The gathering,
mostly garment workers, cheered
Kefauver's attack on N i xo n ' s
votes "against housing" and for
the Taft-Hartley law.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4 (UP) Sen. Estes Kefauver opened fire
on Vice-President Richard M. Nixon today on the Vice-President's
home grounds and saifl Nixon would be the "heir apparent" in an
other GOP administration.

paigning here. He also fired a
campaign salvo at former New
York Governor Thomas Dewey.
At a news conference, soon
after flying into California from
Santa Fe, N.M., Kefauver said

by "the Republican high com
mand" that Dewey "will be the
one to take the low road this
time."
