# Olympic Day Crowd Slim At Reunion
## Torchbearer Run Begins Festivities 
### 
A crowd of GO to 70 persons
turned out for Olympic Day fes
tivities last Friday afternoon at
Rudy's Alpine Inn.
"I was very pleased with the
turnout," said Bud McLellan,
president of Cardinals. "I did not
expect as many people to bo
there, duo to the last few weeks
of ARC activity. Under the cir
cumstances I would consider it a
success," McLellan said.
The celebration commenced
when 21 Roman toga-clad senior
men ran the six miles from the
Cellar - to Rudy's carrying a kero
sene torch. Each man ran one
quarter mile of the route. Some
where along the course the torch
tipped, kerosene spilled, and ama
teur fire - fighters quenched a
small bla/.e on the side of the
road.
The last leg of the trip was to
to be run by Paul Hanson, busi
ness manager of the senior class.
As he was handed the torch, a
group of students lifted him up
on a makeshift sedan chair and
carried him to his destination,
where he ceremoniously extin
guished the torch.
Many students followed the
runners in a car caravan, includ
ing a school bus full of high
school students who were acci
dentally caught up in the festivi
ties.
