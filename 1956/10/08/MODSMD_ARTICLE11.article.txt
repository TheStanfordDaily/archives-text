WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (UP) â€”
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon
and Sen. Estes Kefauver agreed
today that one of (he main objec
tives of U.S. foreign policy should
be to "create the conditions of
peace" in the Middle East.
But in speeches to the 59th an
nual Zionist convention, the two
rivals for the Vice - Presidency
sharply disagreed on whether the
Eisenhower administration is do
ing enough to establish these con
ditions.
Kefauver attacked administra
tion policies and President Eisen
hower personally in his address.
He said "pious platitudes from
no matter how high a source will
never bring about the kind of
peace for which the whole world
yearns."
Nixon, in a snort talk, told the
Zionist organization that Eisen
hower and Dulles have worked
ceaselessly to promote a stable
peace between Israel and its Arab
neighbors. He said that will con
tinue (o be one of the administra
tion's "top priority objectives."
Nixon said the "preservation of
the independence of Israel is in
the best interests" of the United
States and Israel and "of world
peace itself."
The two candidates spoke at
different times and did not ap
pear on (lie piriform together.
Nixon also issued a statement in
which he denounced Adlai E. Ste
venson's criticisms of the admin
istration as "ill-judged, ill-timed,
ill-phrased remarks."
He said he wanted to serve no
tice (hat. although he prefers 1o
campaign on issues rather than
personalities, "I intend to nail
personally on the spot every dis
tortion and every misrepresenta
tion of the Eisenhower record by
Mr. Stevenson."
