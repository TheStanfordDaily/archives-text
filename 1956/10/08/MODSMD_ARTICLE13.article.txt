NEW YORK, Oct. 7 (UP)—Ad
lai E. Stevenson said today that
this nation must not indulge in
the "luxury of complacency and
indifference" until millions of en
slaved persons throughout the
world arc free.
The Democratic Presidential
nominee embraced the "cause of
a free Poland" in a tape record
ing he made for Radio Free Eu
rope.
He made the recording in a re
viewing stand as he watched a
parade honoring American Revo
lutionary War hero Casimir Pu
laski of Poland.
v Polish Spirit
Stevenson said the memory of
the Polish general "symbolizes
the indomitable spirit of Poland,"
whose "passion for liberty has
not wfined in spite of Communist
despotism."
"We, who perhaps take our
freedom too much for granted,
must no) permit ourselves the
luxury of complacency and indif
ference until the millions en
slaved throughout the world have
had their lands and their liberties
restored to them," Stevenson
said.
"It is one of the great and
tragic errors of our time that the
Polish people, who have been
among the foremost champions
of freedom, who fought so many
costly battles to retain their own
freedom, are among the op
pressed peoples of the world," he
said.
Rests Before Trip
Stevenson spoke before flying
back to Chicago to spend a day
and a half at his country home at
nearby Libertyville, 111., prepara
tory to flying west on a campaign
tour Tuesday.

front porch campaign" to be
waged by Stevenson forces in
