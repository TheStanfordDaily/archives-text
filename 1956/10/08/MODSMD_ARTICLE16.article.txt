# Egypt Will Plead Case In UN With Red Help
## West Hopes That Conciliation Move Will Come Today 
### 
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y.. Oct.
7 (UP)—Egypt will put its own
case for the Suez Canal before the
United Nations Security Council
tomorrow with an assist from
Russia.
The West hoped Egyptian For
eign Minister Mahmoud Fawzi in
his speech at the morning council
session would provide some con
ciliatory sign in the deadlocked
canal dispute between Egypt and
Britain and France.
Soviet Foreign Minister Dmitri
T. Shepilov, who supports Egypt
in the quarrel over nationaliza
tion of the waterway, also was
scheduled to speak at the session.
But it had not yet been decided
whether he would address the
morning or afternoon meeting at
the glass- and marble-walled UN
headquarters building.
Dulles to Speak
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles was expected to speak to
the council Tuesday on the crisis.
Fawzi has failed to give an ink
ling of what he will do both in
his talks with newsmen and in
private conferences with Dulles,
Shepilov and Belgian Foreign
Minister Paul Henri Spaak.
The Egyptian foreign minister
has avoided speaking with British
Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd
and French Foreign Minister
Christian Pineau, who opened the
council debate last Friday with an
appeal for endorsement of the
Dulles plan to internationalize t he
canal and a denunciation of Egypt
for seizing it.
Prestige Loss Feared
The United States, which has
endorsed the Anglo-French pro
posal, also feared that the UN
could lose prestige by bogging
dotVn over the issue.
Washington regarded the de
bate as a test for the UN equal
in importance to the Korean war.
If the council cannot deal ably
with the Suez crisis, as it did in
1950 with the Korean war while
Russia was boycotting Ihe world
organization, the United States'
feeling is that one of the main
props of UN effectiveness would
be knocked out.
