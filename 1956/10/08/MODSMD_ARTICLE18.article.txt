# Nasser Says UN Fate Rests On Decision in Suez Crisis
## Egyptian Leader Warns That West Economic Sanctions Will Drive Egypt to Soviet Union 
### 
CAIRO, Oct. 7 (UP)â€”President Gamal A. Nasser said today that
the fate of the United Nations may be decided by the Sue/ crisis.
"The United Nations today is passing through a decisive experi
ence in its history which will determine whether it is to win the
respect of world public opinion or to collapse as did the League of

Nations," Nasser said in an inter
view published by the newspaper
A 1 Missa.
The interview was published on
the eve of Foreign Minister Mah
moud Fawzi's appearance in New
York to answer the Anglo-French
demand for internationalization
of the Suez Canal.
"The question facing us now is
. . . whether the UN will be mere
ly a toy in the hands of imperial
ist nations which . . . are trying to
use it to execute their aggressive
aspirations to control and domi
nate small countries," Nasser
said.
Earlier in a filmed interview
with Edward R. Murrow on the
"See It Now" television program,
Nasser said that Egypt is being
driven toward the Soviet Union
by Western economic sanctions
applied since the nationalization
of the Suez Canal.
Murrow interviewed Nasser in
Cairo. The Egyptian President
said he had no intention of closing
the canal to British shipping or
raising the tolls. The canal was
nationalized, he said, to give
Egypt complete independence
from"the symbol of hate and co
lonialism and that is the British
occupation."
