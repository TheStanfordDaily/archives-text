### 
Axe Society has planned a Stan
ford Alumni Association mem
bership drive Oct. 15-17. All cam
pus living groups will be visited

full information about the drive.
Membership dues are being
sold at special prices at the pres
ent time, but will increase Dec. 1,
1956. according to President Bill
Crookston.
Crookston listed advantages of
membership: football ticket pri
ority, 10 issues annually of Stan
ford Review magazine, contact
ing jobs for graduate members
and belonging to the student or
ganization for life.
An all-campus phone directory
will be issued to living group
members during the drive in ad

book.
Axe Society was originally com
prised of the Immortal Twenty
one and care of the Stanford Axe
is one of its duties. Investigations
have been made to locate its
whereabouts, and several clues
discovered.
"I believe that by showing the
Axe at the rallies, it will build up
much more spirit than if it shows
up the last few minutes of the
Big Game," Crookston stated.
