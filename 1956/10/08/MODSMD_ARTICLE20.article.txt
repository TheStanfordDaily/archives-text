## 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Oct.
7 (UP)—Bulgarian Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov said today
it was "natural" Yugoslavia and
other C o m m u n i s t countries
should follow different paths in
socialism.
Zhivkov, head of a Bulgarian
parliamentary delegation here to
wipe out the enmities of the Sta
lin era, made his remarks at a
press conference.
They served to give added em
.phasis to the "certain differ
ences" between Yugoslavia and
the Soviet Union which the offi
cial Yugoslav party organ "Bor
ba" said today still exist.
Communist Party
"Every Communist party has
something to learn and to utilize
from the experiences of another
socialist country or Communist
party," Zhivkov said.
Yugoslav President Josip Bros
Tito returned this weekend from
a mysterious "holiday" trip to
the Soviet Crimea whore he held
conferences with top Soviet and
Hungarian Communist leaders.
The Bulgarians are here to
patch up relations with Tito.
They met with him today and top
members of his party yesterday.
A joint communique issued to
•night pledged to continue con
tacts between the Soviet and Bul
garian Communist parties and
make further efforts to promote
ties and co-operation.
•Free Kxchange
It mentioned equality of rela
tions. non - interference in each
other's internal affairs, and a
"free exchange of views on ques
tions of experiences in socialist
construction."
Zhivkov's press conference to
day sounded similar to the much
publicized "confession" two years
ago by the Soviet leadership. In
it they admitted they were
wrong, under Stalin, about Tito.
Presumably the Bulgarians
were briefed by Tito on his meet
ing with the Soviets. Tito is ex
pected to give similar briefings
shortly to French and Italian
'Communist party delegations.
