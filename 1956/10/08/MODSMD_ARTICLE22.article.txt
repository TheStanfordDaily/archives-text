# Is the Liquor Law Right?
## 
### 
Unrealistic, arbitrary, unworkable — these
words and many others have been applied with
considerable justification to the California law
which prohibits minors from purchasing liquor
or consuming it in public places.
I he question goes deeper than the mere con
sideration of the age at which young people
should be allowed to start drinking, and it goes
beyond the moral argument that individuals
should be discouraged from drinking as long
as possible.
The question must be resolved by looking
at facts as they are, not as lliey might he if . . .
I he state liquor statute, as it is now, encour
ages persons to break the law. This is unfortu
nate but true.
If a person is brought up in a home where
parents allow drinking in moderation so long
as the drinking is done with their knowledge,
il is unlikely that when he moves out into a
college or a job this person will suddenly stop
drinking. \\ hether right or wrong, students in
college consider themselves adults and feel they
have the capacities to judge their own actions
within the natural restraints imposed upon
them by society.
I he law must be written and enforced with
this knowledge and understanding, for an un
necessary law that is willfully broken by a
great number of those at whom il is aimed is
a detriment to the spirit of law obedience.
I his a I so applies to the Stanford Fundaincn
tal Standard, which is broken both in letter
and spirit by a great many who simply ignore
the liquor provisions and consider themselves
in all other respects thoroughgoing supporters
of the Fundamental Standard.
I he I* ii n d a m en t a I Standard cannot he
changed to sanction violation of the law; it is
the law which should be changed.
We take uo isfttic with Frank Fullenwider
and the men of the Alcoholic Heverages Com
mission, for I hey are only doing their job' in
enforcing the law, however unworkable it
may be.
For the same reason, we consider Cabinet's

recommendation (that the ASSU sanction no
activity to he hehl on premises where liquor is
served) a necessary and good measure.
It is the proper task of the ASSU to divorce
itself completely from activities that permit, if
not encourage, wholesale violation of the law.
How ever necessary this action may he in the
short run, it will not solve the problem in the
long run. Ihe problem is that this is only a
stop-gap proposition.
And in the meantime it will bring to an end
many harmless hut worthwhile activities be
cause liquor is sold on the premises where the
activities are held.
And it certainly will not stop Stanford stu
dents Irom drinking. The significant danger is
that drinking will be done surreptitiously—in
cars and out-of-the-way places.
Many arguments are brought up against low
ering the legal drinking age, and these too have
their points. It is ;is <liflicn 11 to set an arbitrary
age limit lor drinking as it is lor voting, for
the capacity to handle both depends so much
on the individual.
I 'art ly because ol the war and also because
ol fhe economic demands that are imposed on
young people, i hey ol ten become relatively self
sufTicienl before reaching the age of 21. By the
age of l or l f ), most young people have gradu
ated from high school and have started an inde
pendent existence either in college or at a job.
Several states have recognized the problem
and permit drinking at 18 or l ( ). Their prob
lem with teen-age drunk sprees and other de
linquencies seems no greater than ours.
Vt hat can Stanford do? ASSU Cabinet in
their discussion last Thursday night came up
with a good short-run answer; possibly further
discussion by litis and other bodies can come
up with an answer to the long-run problem.
II the problem is approached from a ra
tional. not an irrational we-want-our-booze ap
proach, the stale legislature may become con
vinced licit more problems may be cured than
caused by permitting persons over 18 or 19
to use I heir own discretion about drinking.
