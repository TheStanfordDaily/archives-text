# THIS WEEK ON QUAD-By Earl Cilley
## A 						Bit o' Music for the Week 
### 
This fall bids to be a muchly much better than usual fall as
far as things musical are concerned. So this week in addition to
the regular round of gorp on the subject of the ideal hour and how
to pass it, as a public service this column will include (as much of
the red-hot as space will permit) what is upcoming on the cultural
calendar, both in the line of music and in the other beaux arts too.
(Great language, French.)

Oyez, oyez! Tonight at Paly High auditorium, doing two shows
will be the fantastic duo of S. I. Hayakawa and Bob Scobey, in a
program entitled "The Meaning of Jazz."
L)r. H. (the prof with all the semantical poop which most of us
sampled in English 2a) will deliver a brief lecture on the development
of jazz interspersed with and followed by appropriate illustrations
by Mr. Scobey, his band (currently appearing in the City), the in
comparable Clancy Hayes. Also there will be the inimitable and in
describable Creole Songbird, the one and only Lizzie Miles, who will
appear in the old pearl-bestrung and batisted-up costumes she used
to wear in old N'Awleans in the days when Dixieland was still the
exclusive property of the solid and segregated South.
The group will give shows at 7 and 9, with the cover set at $1.50,
and tickets available by dialing DA 3-0571. See you there.

Tuesday Evening: Series features this week a return engage
ment by that well-known Indian (rlass of '40), Tom Lanpliier, vice
president of Convair and ex-air ace of the War in the Pacific.
He will give an illustrated lecture on "National Policy in the
Supersonic Age." Mem And, 7:30.

Wednesday afternoon is Little Theatre Matinee day, and this week
is no exception. At 4:15, the Speech and Drama Department will
present Thomas Mitchell, veteran thespian of "Stagecoach," "Gone
with the Wind" and "High Noon," in something called "Reminis
cences of the Theatre." That's in the Little Theatre of Mem Aud.

Wednesday night, it's Richard Dyer-Bennet, on deck in Mem Aud
with a program of ballads of all genres and emotional pitches from
Sherwood Forest to the American West.
1 his benefit performance sponsored by the senior class will be
Mr. D-B's second appearance here in the past year. Tickets are $1.50
and are quickest to get at Mem Aud box office which is open 'most
all day, and you might get at it presto, since it ought to be a sell-out.
Or, if you are tone-deaf and/or nuts about football flicks, the Car
dinals will be showing free movies of the Ohio State contest at 7'30
in Cubberley Auditorium. Cub Aud, that is.

Now is the season when the Stanford Concert Series, with offices
in the Nitery, sell season tickets to the coming program of concerts
in Mem Aud.
This year the Series leads off with Richard Lewis, lead tenor of.
Covent Garden and the San Francisco Opera, on Nov. 2G, followed
by Szigeti, Cesare Siepi, Les Ballets Basques de Monte Carlo, the San
I- rancisco Symphony and one other program not yet picked.
Tickets for the whole ball of wax, lasting into next spring, run
under $10 to holders of ASSU blue cards. This is pretty much of a
bai gain, so hie yourself to the Nitery, checkbook in one hand and
pen in the other.
Ask for Merrill and mention TWOQ; it identifies us both.

Remember that the San Francisco Opera still has two weeks to
run, and with an unusually good group of vocal talent the company
has been playing to packed houses. If you haven't yet gotten up to
the Opera, check the S.F. papers for what is playing the night you
i oi? *°. go ' anc l thcn telephone the Opera box office (UNderhill
1-9200) in the afternoon to reserve tickets.

Football wise, this Saturday afternoon the Cards meet San Jose
at Stanford Stadium, with a 2 p.m. kickoff. If Jackie Levit gets
back on the job and her new look pompon girls pin up their skirts
a bit, the rooting sections ought to see quite a bit of the old com
petition between the Farm's fairest and the belles of old S.J - Field
glasses are pretty much reg for the show.

Sunday afternoon, Herbert Nanney will present one of a series
of Sunday afternoon organ concerts in Mem Church at 4. Nannev
is a member of the Music Department and is an organist of con
siderable talent and unusual brilliance, so a late Sunday afternoon
spent in Mem Church is indeed a very rewarding thin#

Sunday night at the Flicks looks to be a real loser to us, but you
on the other hand may clap your little hands and laugh for joy to
hear that Debby Reynolds and Dickie Powell will be among those
piesent in a bit of Technicolored fluff entitled "Susan Slept Here "
Plus two cartoons. Mem Aud, 7:30. Two bits. Take gas.
