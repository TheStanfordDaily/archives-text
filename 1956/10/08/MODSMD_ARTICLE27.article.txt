"The openings are there.'" says Roger,
"and the telephone company trains you
to fill them. 1 joined Northwestern Bell
in 1950 and spent one year learning pole
line and cable construction. This, plus
short periods in other departments, gave
me a good telephone background.
"My experience really grew when I
became an installer-repairman, then a
construction crew foreman, and. in 1952,
Wire Chief at South Sioux City, Ne
braska. There I was responsible for the
3500 dial phones that served the town.

I'd learned to date came in handy on
that job.
"A year later I went to Omaha on a
staff assignment, and in March, 1956, 1
moved up to my present position.

ing and maintaining Plant equipment in
the Huron district. We supervise ordering

broader than the last, and believe me. the
more I learn, the better I like it."
