# Cal, USC, Washington Wins Give PCC Happy Weekend
## 
### 
Upset victories by California
and Washington enabled the Pa
cific Coast Conference to regain
a measure of national prestige
this weekend.
The Bears parlayed a surpris
ing aerial attack into a 14-0 win
over highly - rated Pittsburgh,
while Washington shocked Illi
nois, 28-13.
Southern California gained the
PCC's third intersectional win
Saturday by nipping Wisconsin,
13 6. lowa untracked itself in the
fourth period to edge Oregon
State, 14-13, after trailing all the
way.
In a pair of conference engage
ments, Washington State rolled
over Idaho, 33-19, and UCLA eked
out a 6-0 decision over Oregon.
Cus Gianulias, Joe Kapp and
Joe Condestabile all threw with
deadly accuracy in the Cal vic
tory. The trio completed 20 of
32 passes attempted as the Bears
played what Coach Pappy Wal
dorf called "our best game in
three years."
A 92-yard run by Dean Derby
sparked Washington's upset win
over Ilinois. The Illini had
marched to the Huskies' two-yard
line to open the game, but lost
the ball on a-fumble.
Two plays later, Derby crashed
through tiic line for the touch
down that thoroughly demoral
ized Illinois. Washington padded
its margin to 14-0 at halftimo, and
was never in serious trouble.
Jon Arnett scored the winning
touchdown in the fourth quarter

and netted 182 yards running as
USC gained its third consecutive
victory of the season.
The Trojans' All-American can
didate averaged more than seven
yards a carry each of the 25
times he lugged the ball. SC
opened the scoring with Arnett
passing 35 yards to Bob Rosen
dahl in the first period. The
Badgers didn't cross the goal line
until the game was nearly over,
and victory well out of reach.
Oregon State's loss was a
heartbreaker for the Beavers,
who outplayed lowa through
three quarters. State scored on
the game's second play from
scrimmage, but the vital conver
sion attempt was blocked.
After moving ahead '13-0 in the
third stanza, the Beavers saw
their lead collapse within a two
minute period late in the game as
lowa scored on passes of 10 and
33 yards.
A post - game riot and subse
quent tear-gas barrage marked
the Washington State - Idaho
clash. The Cougars led by as
much as 27-7 in rolling to their
first 1956 PCC victory.
Fist fights among some of the
16,000 spectators lasted long after
the game. Police finally quelled
the battle with tear gas.
UCLA, a far cry from its pow
er-laden teams of 1953-55, recov
ered an Oregon fumble on the
one-yard line in the fourth period
to set up their narrow 6-0 win.
The Bruins had earlier been halt
ed four times within the 15-yard
stripe.
