# OHIO STATE-STANFORD
## Losing Effort -- But A Good Show 
### 
Stanford came out on the short
end of the score again Saturday,
but left the record crowd of 82,881
at the Ohio State Stadium some
thing more than Ohio State's 32-
20 victory to talk about.
The Indians, dominant in al
most all phases of game statis
tics, unleashed something rarely
seen in the midwest a passing
attack, thanks to the good right
arm of quarterback John Brodie.
But passes were not enough
and it was the Ohio State "pass
less" offense, culminating in a
two - touchdown fourth - quarter
OSU splurge that sent Stanford
down to its second defeat against
a Big Ten opponent in as many
weeks.
Next week Chuck Taylor's
eleven is hoping for a breather.
They return to the friendlier lo
cal grounds to battle the San
Jose State Spartans, before mov
ing back into Pacific Coast Con
ference action where they hold a
1-0 record.
I'ass, I'ass, Pass
The Ohio fans came away from
the game with a lot to remember,
especially Brodie's work. The
pass - slinging field general
sparked the Indian offense on
each of four long drives into Ohio
State territory, leading a ball-con
trol offense finely balanced be
tween passing and running.
The pass is indeed a rarity at
Ohio State the Buckeyes' sea

son total last year read only 51
attempted, 17 completed and 162
yards gained for two touchdowns.
Saturday, ihey threw only two,
one of which was completed for
an 18-yard touchdown.
Saturday Brodie passed 35
times and completed 21 for 256
yards and two touchdowns. He
also directed the ground attack
to A 3.6 average against a team
which considers its defense a
strong point.

Stanford passed for 269 yards
and confounded the Ohio State
defense by running for 115 yards,
a total of 414 yards gained. The
Buckeyes gained 320 yards, only
18 of which came through the air.
A further indication of Stan
ford's control of the ball was
their 25 first downs and 70 total
offensive plays • compared with
Ohio State's 17 first downs and
58 plays.
However, as Coach Hayes said
after the game, the only statistic
that really counts is the final
score. •
Most of the Indians' edge in
statistics came on a 65-yard drive
late in the second quarter which
dissipated on the five-yard line
when proximity to Ihe half led to
a hurried pass and subsequent
interception.
Mistakes Costly
Two other Ohio State intercep
tions, a costly fumble, mediocre
punting and the perfection of the
Ohio State attack, which gave the
Indians few breaks, were all fac
tors in nullifying the Stanford
edge in ball control.
Stanford's three touchdowns
climaxed drives of 80, 82 and 52
Lou Valli capped off the
game-opening 80-yard drive with
an eight-yard run. Brodie passed
11 yards to Carl Isaacs for the
second tally and hit Troy Barbee
from four yards out on the tackle

eligible play to knot the count at j
20-20 in the third quarter.
Second only to Brodie's per- j
formance for the Indians was the
spirited show of the reserve line-!
men, Meigs Jones, Roch Conklin
and Barbee, why were used by J
Taylor to plug the gaps left by ;
the,loss of three interior linemen
who started against Michigan
State a week earlier.
Tackle Paul Wiggin and guard j
Donn Carswell steadied these
more inexperienced linemen with
stand-out jobs throughout the!
entire game.
For Ohio State, halfback Don
Clark, sophomort replacement i
for Hopalong Cassady, personally j
accounted for two touchdowns j
and 141.yawls -running and tossed
the one Ohio State completion to
fellow halfback Jim Roseboro
aflcr taking a pitch - out from
quarterback Ellwood.
No Breather
Of note is the fact that the |
Buckeyes were forced to use j
these three backs and All-Ameri- ;
can guard Jim Parker through- j
out the game. The Indians gave
the Big Ten co-favorites a rough !
time arid might well climb back
among the nation's top 20 teams, j
End Gary Van Galder was the j
only player seriously injured. He j
joined (he "out-for-at-least-two-1
weeks" gang with a torn knee I
ligament.
