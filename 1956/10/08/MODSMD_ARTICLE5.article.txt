COLUMBUS, Ohio (UP)—Two Stanford foot
hall players, Donald Manoukian and Don Cars
well, were released from jail yesterday after
spending a night in the cooler for throwing
garbage cans out of a hotel window here.
Authorities released the two Indian guards so
they could return to California with the Stanford
squad after Coach Chuck Taylor promised pay
for any damage incurred.
Manoukian and Carswell were charged with
throwing half a dozen 30-gallon garbage cans
from the Deshler-Hilton Hotel to the roof of the
adjacent Palace Theater.
The pair gave no reason for the act, except to

say they were still mad over Stanford's 32-20 loss
to Ohio State Saturday afternoon.
The team, including the two Card linemen,
was welcomed at San Francisco's International
Airport yester day afternoon by Head Yell Leader
Bill Duke and his associates.
When contacted by The Daily and asked about
the situation, Taylor declined to reply. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler and Dean of Men
William Craig said they would have to look into
the situation before making a comment.
Manoukian is the senior guard who has been
declared out for the season because of injury
incurred during fall practice.
