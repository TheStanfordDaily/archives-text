# Republican Says Stevenson Prospers Under Soil Bank
## Aiken Predicts Adlai's County Won't Revolt, 'Demo Candidate Talks Through His Hat' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (UP)—Sen. George D. Aiken said today
that Adlai E. Stevenson, as a "gentleman farmer," is doing pretty
well under the GOP farm program he attacks as a presidential
candidate.
The Vermont .Republican said that Stevenson is going about the

country making "wild state
ments" about a farm depression
while his own farm near Liberty
ville, 111., is in better shape than
four years ago when President
Eisenhower took office.
"In fact, he's even found in pri
vate life that the Republican soil
bank program isn't quite as bad
as he is making it out to be in
public life," Aiken said in a state
ment. "He has 15 acres of hay in
the soil bank on his own farm."
Playing Politics
Stevenson has charged that the
Eisenhower Administration is
"playing politics" with the soil
hank to "pour money into thp
farm belt" before the election.
Aiken quoted the operator of
Stevenson's farm, Hudson Burr
of Bloomington, 111., as saying
Stevenson "is talking through his
political hat when he goes around
yelling about depression."
Burr also said, according to
Aiken, that there is no farm re
volt in McLean County, in which
the Stevenson farm is located.
"If efficient farmers are in
trouble," Aiken quoted Burr,
"then I'm awfully blind."
Chief Spokesman
Aiken, the Administration's
chief farm spokesman in the Sen
ate, said Stevenson was "preach
ing hard times" during his first
campaign for President fo u r
years ago when the Democratic
high price support program was
in effect.
Things were so bad then, Aiken
said, that Stevenson had to sell
two of his three farms.
"Well, sir, four years of Repub
lican policies have gofie by, and a
report from Stevenson's remain
ing farm, the one at Libertyville,
shows things have improved con
siderably," Aiken said.
