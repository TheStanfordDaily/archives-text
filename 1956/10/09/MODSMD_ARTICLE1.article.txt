# SPD to Crack Down on Cars Not Registered
## Davis Commends Student Cooperation In New Parking Plan 
### 
Stanford Police Department
will now begin to crack down on
students driving cars and motor
cycles without registration stick
ers, according to Chief Gordon
Davis.
Rut Davis commended most
drivers for their cooperation.
"The vast majority are adjusting
to the thing," he said, "and we
want to go along with them and
not put in more enforcement than
necessary."
Registration
Cars without stickers may be
registered at the Police Depart
ment in the Corporation Yard.
Students registering cars will
pay the late fee of $6 unless they
can prove the car was purchased
after last Friday's deadline. They
will then make the regular $3
payment.
Another violation cited by
Davis was illegal parking by on
campus students on recent rainy
days. "For the real rains in the
months ahead, we'll have to make
our plans now. There is no more
room on rainy days than warm,
sunny ones."
New Signs
The Police Department yester
day installed signs in the Stern
parking lot, which is reserved for
residents of that dorm and for
off-campus students, and also
placed signs in the Crothers park
ing lot.
"If some of the space in the
Crothers parking lot is unused by
CVothers Memorial residents and
there are no violators, one wing
of Toyon may eventually get to
use this lot," Davis pointed out.
Davis also mentioned the in
crease in speeding violations this
year as compared to this time
last year.
