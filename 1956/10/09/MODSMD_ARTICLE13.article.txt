"Today, Communist subma
rines are operating in the Medi
terranean from bases in Egypt.
Mr. Dulles did that. It couldn't
have happened any other way."
Leather charged that the Unit
ed States first helped to establish j
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel I
Nasser in power, over British
protests, then gave him a pretext i
to seize the Suez Canal by refus
ing to bankroll his grandiose As
wan Dam project.
Would Not Support England
Then, he said, U.S. leaders
urged Britain to take a firm
stand on the situation and I
promptly refused to support if.
Leather said Dulles and Presi
dent Eisenhower originally
"pleaded" with Prime Minister j
Anthony Eden not to take the !

tions.
