# Ike and HST Face to Face?
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Oct. X (UP) â€”
Nervous politicians arc plan
ning every precaution to bar a
chance meeting here tomorrow
between President Eisenhower
and former President Truman.
Tru m a n arrived in town
today and took up temporary
residence at the Penn-Sheraton
Hold. Eisenhower, when lie
comes here tomorrow, will stay
iu the same hotel.
The last tiling local politi
cians of both parties want is a
chance face-to-face encounter.
It could easily happen, if no
precautions are taken. The
hotel lobby is a multi-level com
plicated affair, with a number
of connecting passageways. The
two blocks of elevators are in
the same passageway.
"Wouldn't that be something
if they met face to face in the
hotel," the manager of the hos
telry, Charles Carey, said with
a whistle.
"It won't happen," the ar
rangement-makers assured him.
"Something like that just
won't be permitted to happen,"
Tom Burton, head of GOP pub
licity here, said.
His Democratic counterpart,
Huek Fenrlch, agreed.
"That would really be a meet
ing if it came off. But it won't.
We'll make sure of that," he
said.
