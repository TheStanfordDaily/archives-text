# Communists Ask Decision Reversal

### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (UP) â€”
Counsel for 14 California Commu
nists asked the Supremo Court
today to reverse their conspiracy
convictions on grounds that the
government failed to prove any
thing against them.
Three attorneys representing
the Los Angeles group argued
that the case differs in many ways
from the one involving 11 top
party officers who were jailed in
1951.
The Supreme Court at that time
upheld the conviction of the 11 on
charges of conspiring to advocate
the violent overthrow of the gov
ernment. It also upheld the con
stitutionality of the section of the
Smith Act of 1910 under which
the defendants in both cases were
indicted.
