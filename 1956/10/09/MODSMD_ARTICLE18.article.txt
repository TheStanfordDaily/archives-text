# Russia and Egypt Propose That UN Set Up Suez Meet
## Ask Treaty Giving Free Passage; Dulles Will Speak for U.S. Today 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct. 3 (UP) The Soviet Union joined
Egypt today in proposing that the United Nations Security Council
set uo a negotiating committee to seek a solution to the Suez Canal
crisis.
Soviet Foreign Minister Dmitri T. Shepilov, making his most

important public appearance since |
he relieved Vyaeheslav M. Molo-;
tov last summer, said the council
should appoint a committee of j
perhaps eight countries to work j
out a treaty guaranteeing free- i
dom of passage through the canal
to replace the 188H Constantino
ple Convention. The now treaty '
eventually would be submitted to i
a meeting of all users of the i
canal.
At the end of today's meeting,
the council had heard the views
of all its members except Yugo
slavia and the United States, both
of which were scheduled to speak
tomorrow morning. Council Pres
ident Christian Pineau of France
announced that the council would
hold its first secret meeting on
the Suez crisis at 4 p.m. (EDT)
tomorrow.
Negotiating Machinery
Both Shepilov and Egyptian !
Foreign Minister Mahmoud Fawzi j
offered principles which should |
govern the discussions of the ne- j
gotiating group.
Their proposal, submitted sepa-'
rately and informally by the two
foreign ministers, appeared to ap
proach the position held by the
United States that "negotiating
machinery" should be set up and
that the chief aim of the current
Security Council debate should be
to determine whether a basis for
negotiation exists.
But Shepilov and Fawzi spelled
out preconditions for such nego
tiation that might wreck any
chance of Western acceptance.
Adamant Address
American sources said the U.S.
position toward the Soviet-Egyp
tian proposal would be spelled out
when Secretary of State John Fos
ter Dulles addresses the council
tomorrow.
A French delegation spokesman
said there were some points in
Fawzi's speech indicating a basis
for negotiation, but that Shepi
lov's address was "so adamant we
wonder where it can lead."
Both Fawzi and Shepilov struck
a popular note with the packed
public gallery. There was ap
plause at the end of their speeches
this morning. Council President
Pineau warned at the outset of
the afternoon meeting that he
would clear the hall if there was
any further demonstration.
Crucify Egypt
Shepilov, conscious of the six
foreign ministers—all his senior
—watching him, spoke slowly and
deliberately in his rolling bass
voice. He started pleasantly
enough, then launched into a de
nunciation of Britain, France and
the United States.
Britain and France, he said, re
plying to world wide public de
mand for a peaceful settlement of
the Suez crisis, said in effort:
"Egypt is guilty. Crucify it!"
Colonialism
He belabored the theme that
the Suez Canal Company, nation
alized by Egypt, was one of the
"most important strongholds of
colonialism in the Near and Mid
dle East," and said:
"What we are witnessing now
is the collapse of the thoroughly
corrupt imperialist colonial sys- j
tem, a system which has outlived
itself."
