# Adlai Outlines Insuring Plan For Everyone
## Candidate Asks Private Health Insurance Plan On Voluntary Basis 
### 
LIBERTYVILLE, 111., Oct. 8—
(UP) Adlai E. Stevenson tonight
proposed that the federal govern
ment financially guarantee blan
ket health insurance coverage for
everyone, particularly low-income
families.
The Democratic presidential
candidate called for a system of
voluntary insurance, assuring
payment on a basis of need of
comprehensive hospitalization and
medical expenses.
In a 4000-word statement out
lining his "program for the na
tion's health," Stevenson said he
was opposed to any system of
"socialized medicine."
Voluntary Basis
"I am equally strongly in favor
of a program to make compre
hensive private health insurance
available on a voluntary basis to
all Americans, so that no Ameri
can will be denied good medical
care for financial reasons," he
said.
Stevenson said more than 100
million Americans now have some
form of health insurance, but only
3 per cent of the people have com
prehensive plans covering doc
tors' bills, surgery, hospital costs
and other expenses.
Stevenson said there are "many
ways" by which this type of in
surance could be made available
to everyone.
"It is clear that some form of
federal aid will be required to
achieve this goal," he said.
He said this could be a re-insur
ance plan, where the federal gov
ernment would make long-term
loans to labor, co-operatives and
other groups which have group
health insurance programs.
Matching Grants
The federal government might
also make matching grants to the
state "to pay part of the costs of
the voluntary health insurance for
low-income families and individ
uals," Stevenson said.
Such a program, he said, should
be based on the principle that
"those who can pay their own
way should, that those who can
pay a major part should pay that
part, and that those who can pay
little or nothing should pay wh'At
they can and should be assisted
with the rest."
The statement was the third
major outline of policy Stevenson
has issued on a specific subject
since starting his presidential
campaign.
He issued it from his farm
home near here, where ho is rest
ing up before taking off tomor
row on a Western swing covering
Montana, Idaho, Washington, Or
egon and California.

the voluntary health insurance for
low-income families and individ
uals," Stevenson said.
Such a program, he said, should
be based on the principle that
"those who can pay their own
way should, that those who can
pay a major part should pay that
part, and that those who can pay
little or nothing should pay wh'At
they can and should be assisted
with the rest."
The statement was the third
major outline of policy Stevenson
has issued on a specific subject
since starting his presidential
campaign.

LIBERTYVILLE, 111., Oct. 8—
(UP) Adlai E. Stevenson tonight
proposed that the federal govern
ment financially guarantee blan
ket health insurance coverage for
everyone, particularly low-income
families.
The Democratic presidential
candidate called for a system of
voluntary insurance, assuring
payment on a basis of need of
comprehensive hospitalization and
medical expenses.
In a 4000-word statement out
lining his "program for the na
tion's health," Stevenson said he
was opposed to any system of
"socialized medicine."
Voluntary Basis
"I am equally strongly in favor
of a program to make compre
hensive private health insurance
available on a voluntary basis to
all Americans, so that no Ameri
can will be denied good medical
care for financial reasons," he
said.
Stevenson said more than 100
million Americans now have some
form of health insurance, but only
3 per cent of the people have com
prehensive plans covering doc
tors' bills, surgery, hospital costs
and other expenses.
Stevenson said there are "many
ways" by which this type of in
surance could be made available
to everyone.
"It is clear that some form of
federal aid will be required to
achieve this goal," he said.
He said this could be a re-insur
ance plan, where the federal gov
ernment would make long-term
loans to labor, co-operatives and
other groups which have group
health insurance programs.
Matching Grants
The federal government might
also make matching grants to the
state "to pay part of the costs of
the voluntary health insurance for
low-income families and individ
uals," Stevenson said.
Such a program, he said, should
be based on the principle that
"those who can pay their own
way should, that those who can
pay a major part should pay that
part, and that those who can pay
little or nothing should pay wh'At
they can and should be assisted
with the rest."

major outline of policy Stevenson

campaign.
