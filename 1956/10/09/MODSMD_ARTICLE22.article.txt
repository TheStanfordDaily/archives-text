# Paul Butler Misses the Point
## 
### 
As POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS GET HOTTER, political
nerves get frayed, and astute judgment on the
part of supposedly astute politicians often takes
a nose dive.
Such is the case with Democratic National
Chairman Paul Butler, a man with an ever
ready axe to grind about his pet peeve —the
Republican press.
Butler was asked last Sunday whether his
candidate, Adlai Stevenson, would further clar
ify his earlier statements on draft reduction.
Butler replied that Stevenson does not have
the time to clear up "misrepresentations" of
his views "reported in most of the press."
As members of the fourth estate, we resent
Butler's constant knifings of the integrity of
the men who are covering the news. As to
editorial expression and amount of news space
allotted to candidates of both parties, there is
little doubt that the Republicans swamp the
Democrats, but reporters themselves on the
whole pride themselves on their objectivity.
Butler has a point when he claims that Ste
venson's comment that the draft should be
ended as soon as it is "consistent with national
safety" has been misconstrued, but the mis

interpretation lias been done primarily by Re
publican candidates and campaigners. Here
his point lies; not with the nation's press.
The issue merits further debate and dis
cussion. We disagree with President Eisen
hower's statement that continued debate over
the draft endangers national security, for, if
one follows this type of logic, any aspect of the
foreign policy debate could be silenced in the
name of national security.
For this reason —because it is a matter of
vital interest to the country —it should be dis
cussed openly and freely. Let the people decide.
Stevenson knows as well as Eisenhower the
impossibility of ending the draft here and now,
but he recognizes that this country must start
thinking, and thinking today, about the mili
tary situation in 1960 or 1970.
He knows that a prolonged cold war and an
extended draft program are incompatible and
that this country must not waste manpower
and money on a conceivably outdated type of
defense.
Stevenson has gone out of his way to point
out that this is a real issue. If it is misunder
stood, let hi in clarify his stand.
