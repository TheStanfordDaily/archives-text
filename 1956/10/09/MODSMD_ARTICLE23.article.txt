Columbia University's Student Board has given
its support to the eventual establishment of an
honor system, according to the Columbia Daily
Spectator. It is hoped, the board says, that such
a system would curtail competition for grades,
which is believed to be the cause of cheating in
examinations. Trying to foster a sense of "indi
vidual student responsibility," ihe board also
stated that an indoctrination period of several
years would be necessary before the program
could be put into full force.

Possible limitation of enrollment at the Uni
versity of Oregon has been the subject of specu
lation in Eugene, according to the Oregon Daily
Emerald. State Board of Higher Education has
asked for a 43 per cent appropriation increase
from the state legislature. If this sum cannot be
granted, enrollment will have to be cut or aca
demic standards will bo lowered because of over
crowded facilities and too small a faculty. Final
decision will rest with the Oregon legislature
when it meets in January.

Initial work has begun in Monterey County to
study a proposed plan to combine Monterey Pe
ninsula College and Hartnell College, both junior
colleges, into one county-wide district. The new
plan would not combine the two campuses or
their staffs, but would unite the schools finan
cially. It would require the establishment of a
joint board of trustees and a county superin
tendent of junior colleges.

University of Connecticut recently named a
student-faculty committee to investigate possible
changes in the new social regulations which were
put into effect last month.
Student disapproval seems to be aimed, accord
ing to the Daily Campus, at rules requiring that
three chaperones be present at all on-campus
parties, that only one off-campus party be al
lowed to each living group in one semester and
that all parties be registered three weeks in
advance.
The committee is expected to study the new
rules and make recommendations that will be
acceptable to both students and administration.
