## Both Parties "Appeased" Peron 
### 
A most difficult and important problem of United States
foreign policy has been brought into sharp foeus recently as a
product of political incriminations by representatives of both
political parties.
The incriminations centered around the nebulous question
of which administration gave the most support to ousted Argen
tine dictator Juan Peron when he was in power.
The original attack, made by. presidential candidate Adlai
Stevenson, charged that the present Republican administration
had appeased Peron and encouraged Middle Eastern nations "to
be ugly and threatening and to flirt with communism." Steven
son claimed the present policy toward the Middle Kast is all too
like that policy which was directed toward Argentina, which, lie
stated, was "morally, politically and economically'" oil' the track.
Stevenson selected as his specific target Milton S. Eisenhower,
who, he claimed, had assumed special responsibility for Ameri
can policy toward Peron.
It is a matter of record that Milton Eisenhower was active
in the formulation of American policy toward Peron. It was he
who advised the State Department, oil the request of Peron, to
continue in office Ambassador Albert Nufer when Nuler was
supposed to have been replaced by Willard Beauluc. This, as
a New ork Times editorial of Sept. 27 points out, is in effect
allowing Peron to choose who should represent the I nited Stales
in Argentina.
Nnfer, however, was a Truman appointee in the first place
and has come under attack from many sources. Criticisms of
his term of office in Argentina-have been justified. They have
certainly not been defended nor rationalized.
Last week Secretary of State John Foster Dulles • counter
attacked by charging the Truman Administration with appease
ment. He claimed the Truman policy, together with that of
Ambassador Spruille Braden, was instrumental and indirectly
responsible for bringing Peron into power in the first place.
According to Dulles, the anti-Peron policies of Braden were
taken by the Argentine people to be undue interference in
Argentina's internal affairs. They, iu retaliation, voted Peron in
as President. Braden was primarily responsible for the State
Department's issuance of tly* blue book, a scathing denounce
ment of Argentina.
Certain facts cannot be denied. Braden's predecessor Norman
Armour was actually instrumental in guiding Peron in his reach
for power. Braden's successors followed a new line of appease
ment of Peron.
During the Truman administration a SI3O million loan was
granted to Argentina. This loan was floated so Argentina could
pay American businesses who exported goods to that country.
I lie Eisenhower Administration also negotiated a loan with
Peron. However, this loan did not through until after Peron
had been ousted. Nevertheless, the loan was approved for PeVon's
government.

These charges and countercharges by llic political parties
have neither thrown the blame entirely on one administration
nor have they exonerated the other. All they have done is point
out that one administration has been in just as much error as
the other. \\ hen it is conceded that both are in error, the degree
of error is really not important.
I lie important question is why they were in error. What
was, and presumably still is, wrong with our policy toward not
only Peron s government, but other similar governments as well?
International diplomacy is thought by some people to be
similar to economic diplomacy between, say, two large corpo
rations. This analogy holds true—but only to a small degree.
\\ lien a business firm enters into negotiations with another
firm, the primary goal is to secure the best possible bargain while
still retaining amicable relations. The final agreement is usually
of benefit to both parties. So far, the aimlogy holds true.
But, where between Iwo business firms the best possible
bargain is one of an economical nature only, between nations
tiie best possible bargain must lake into account not only eco
nomic agreements but also agreements in a wide variety of

other fields, such as mutual defense, protection of nationals,
immigration and visitation entry permits, and others.
To do this the negotiators-must have a knowledge of not onlv
each other's economic background and philosophv, but also of
each other's religious philosophy, cultural arts, customs and
taboos, political philosophy, concepts of international law and
a host of other items of importance to either one or the other
contracting parties.
Now, it is to be expected that the State Department has
experts in all these fields of human and international relations.
It is their business to employ such experts. Thus the reason does
not lie in that direction.
It lies, rather, in the direction of policy. The answer to the
question of why both administrations were in error lies in the
answer to the question, "In this super-bargain secured through
treaties with foreign nations, what factors were accented and
pushed as prime goals of American foreign policy? And why?"

With respect to the appeasement of Peron's government,
American foreign policy has dictated that amicable relations be
carried on with that government at practically any cost so that
American foreign trade with Argentina would not suffer and so
that, in the event of war, Argentina could be utilized for mili
tary purposes.
To achieve these goals the United States has had to deal
with a government which flagrantly flouted its disdain for demo
cratic ideals and principles.
To achieve these goals the United States has had to favor,
to appease a dictatorship, creating an affront to other Latin-
American nations which have democratic traditions of long
standing, and to the people of Argentina themselves who were
under the yoke of that regime.
Was it worth it? The recent controversy suggests it was not.
Thus possibly the policy was wrong. If so, how was this policy
allowed ?
Policy is politically formed and follows the Tine of the great
est pressure. The greatest pressure for that policy came from
vested trade groups and from military circles. This is the story
of American foreign policy.
An attempt toward solution could lie in the softening of
pressure from vested interests so that experts in international
relations could decide on more equitable goals for foreign policy,
not on just one or two prime goals that disregard others which
could, conceivably, be of vital importance themselves.
it is up to the administrations themselves how they are going
to handle the setting of foreign policy. It is also up to them
to remember that their errors hurt not only the administrations
in election years, but the whole nation —all the time.

With respect to the appeasement of Peron's government,
American foreign policy has dictated that amicable relations be
carried on with that government at practically any cost so that
American foreign trade with Argentina would not suffer and so
that, in the event of war, Argentina could be utilized for mili
tary purposes.
To achieve these goals the United States has had to deal
with a government which flagrantly flouted its disdain for demo
cratic ideals and principles.
To achieve these goals the United States has had to favor,
to appease a dictatorship, creating an affront to other Latin-
American nations which have democratic traditions of long
standing, and to the people of Argentina themselves who were
under the yoke of that regime.
Was it worth it? The recent controversy suggests it was not.
Thus possibly the policy was wrong. If so, how was this policy
allowed ?
Policy is politically formed and follows the Tine of the great
est pressure. The greatest pressure for that policy came from
vested trade groups and from military circles. This is the story
of American foreign policy.
An attempt toward solution could lie in the softening of
pressure from vested interests so that experts in international
relations could decide on more equitable goals for foreign policy,
not on just one or two prime goals that disregard others which
could, conceivably, be of vital importance themselves.
it is up to the administrations themselves how they are going
to handle the setting of foreign policy. It is also up to them
to remember that their errors hurt not only the administrations
in election years, but the whole nation —all the time.
A most difficult and important problem of United States
foreign policy has been brought into sharp foeus recently as a
product of political incriminations by representatives of both
political parties.
The incriminations centered around the nebulous question
of which administration gave the most support to ousted Argen
tine dictator Juan Peron when he was in power.
The original attack, made by. presidential candidate Adlai
Stevenson, charged that the present Republican administration
had appeased Peron and encouraged Middle Eastern nations "to
be ugly and threatening and to flirt with communism." Steven
son claimed the present policy toward the Middle Kast is all too
like that policy which was directed toward Argentina, which, lie
stated, was "morally, politically and economically'" oil' the track.
Stevenson selected as his specific target Milton S. Eisenhower,
who, he claimed, had assumed special responsibility for Ameri
can policy toward Peron.
It is a matter of record that Milton Eisenhower was active
in the formulation of American policy toward Peron. It was he
who advised the State Department, oil the request of Peron, to
continue in office Ambassador Albert Nufer when Nuler was
supposed to have been replaced by Willard Beauluc. This, as
a New ork Times editorial of Sept. 27 points out, is in effect
allowing Peron to choose who should represent the I nited Stales
in Argentina.
Nnfer, however, was a Truman appointee in the first place
and has come under attack from many sources. Criticisms of
his term of office in Argentina-have been justified. They have
certainly not been defended nor rationalized.
Last week Secretary of State John Foster Dulles • counter
attacked by charging the Truman Administration with appease
ment. He claimed the Truman policy, together with that of
Ambassador Spruille Braden, was instrumental and indirectly
responsible for bringing Peron into power in the first place.

With respect to the appeasement of Peron's government,
American foreign policy has dictated that amicable relations be
carried on with that government at practically any cost so that
American foreign trade with Argentina would not suffer and so
that, in the event of war, Argentina could be utilized for mili
tary purposes.
To achieve these goals the United States has had to deal
with a government which flagrantly flouted its disdain for demo
cratic ideals and principles.
To achieve these goals the United States has had to favor,
to appease a dictatorship, creating an affront to other Latin-
American nations which have democratic traditions of long
standing, and to the people of Argentina themselves who were
under the yoke of that regime.
Was it worth it? The recent controversy suggests it was not.
Thus possibly the policy was wrong. If so, how was this policy
allowed ?
Policy is politically formed and follows the Tine of the great
est pressure. The greatest pressure for that policy came from
vested trade groups and from military circles. This is the story
of American foreign policy.
An attempt toward solution could lie in the softening of
pressure from vested interests so that experts in international
relations could decide on more equitable goals for foreign policy,
not on just one or two prime goals that disregard others which
could, conceivably, be of vital importance themselves.
it is up to the administrations themselves how they are going
to handle the setting of foreign policy. It is also up to them
to remember that their errors hurt not only the administrations
in election years, but the whole nation —all the time.
A most difficult and important problem of United States
foreign policy has been brought into sharp foeus recently as a
product of political incriminations by representatives of both
political parties.
The incriminations centered around the nebulous question
of which administration gave the most support to ousted Argen
tine dictator Juan Peron when he was in power.
The original attack, made by. presidential candidate Adlai
Stevenson, charged that the present Republican administration
had appeased Peron and encouraged Middle Eastern nations "to
be ugly and threatening and to flirt with communism." Steven
son claimed the present policy toward the Middle Kast is all too
like that policy which was directed toward Argentina, which, lie
stated, was "morally, politically and economically'" oil' the track.
Stevenson selected as his specific target Milton S. Eisenhower,
who, he claimed, had assumed special responsibility for Ameri
can policy toward Peron.
It is a matter of record that Milton Eisenhower was active
in the formulation of American policy toward Peron. It was he
who advised the State Department, oil the request of Peron, to
continue in office Ambassador Albert Nufer when Nuler was
supposed to have been replaced by Willard Beauluc. This, as
a New ork Times editorial of Sept. 27 points out, is in effect
allowing Peron to choose who should represent the I nited Stales
in Argentina.
Nnfer, however, was a Truman appointee in the first place
and has come under attack from many sources. Criticisms of
his term of office in Argentina-have been justified. They have
certainly not been defended nor rationalized.
Last week Secretary of State John Foster Dulles • counter
attacked by charging the Truman Administration with appease
ment. He claimed the Truman policy, together with that of
Ambassador Spruille Braden, was instrumental and indirectly
responsible for bringing Peron into power in the first place.
According to Dulles, the anti-Peron policies of Braden were
taken by the Argentine people to be undue interference in
Argentina's internal affairs. They, iu retaliation, voted Peron in
as President. Braden was primarily responsible for the State
Department's issuance of tly* blue book, a scathing denounce
ment of Argentina.
Certain facts cannot be denied. Braden's predecessor Norman
Armour was actually instrumental in guiding Peron in his reach
for power. Braden's successors followed a new line of appease
ment of Peron.
During the Truman administration a SI3O million loan was
granted to Argentina. This loan was floated so Argentina could
pay American businesses who exported goods to that country.
I lie Eisenhower Administration also negotiated a loan with
Peron. However, this loan did not through until after Peron
had been ousted. Nevertheless, the loan was approved for PeVon's
government.

These charges and countercharges by llic political parties
have neither thrown the blame entirely on one administration
nor have they exonerated the other. All they have done is point
out that one administration has been in just as much error as
the other. \\ hen it is conceded that both are in error, the degree
of error is really not important.
I lie important question is why they were in error. What
was, and presumably still is, wrong with our policy toward not
only Peron s government, but other similar governments as well?
International diplomacy is thought by some people to be
similar to economic diplomacy between, say, two large corpo
rations. This analogy holds true—but only to a small degree.
\\ lien a business firm enters into negotiations with another
firm, the primary goal is to secure the best possible bargain while
still retaining amicable relations. The final agreement is usually
of benefit to both parties. So far, the aimlogy holds true.
But, where between Iwo business firms the best possible
bargain is one of an economical nature only, between nations
tiie best possible bargain must lake into account not only eco
nomic agreements but also agreements in a wide variety of

other fields, such as mutual defense, protection of nationals,
immigration and visitation entry permits, and others.
To do this the negotiators-must have a knowledge of not onlv
each other's economic background and philosophv, but also of
each other's religious philosophy, cultural arts, customs and
taboos, political philosophy, concepts of international law and
a host of other items of importance to either one or the other
