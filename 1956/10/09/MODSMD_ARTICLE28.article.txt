# Hoover Tower--Memorial to a Man and His Work
## Hoover Library Established In 1919 'To Promote Peace' 
### 
The Hoover Institute and Li
brary on War, Revolution and
Peace was established in 1919 by
Herbert Hoover, an alumnus of
Stanford, as the Hoover War Col
lections at Stanford University.
It now houses one of the most
complete collections of research
materials in the field of world
affairs.
The building was dedicated on
June 20, 1941, with the following
inscription by Hoover: "The pur
pose of this institution is to pro
mote peace. Its records stand as
a challenge to those who promote
war. They should attract those
who search for peace. I therefore
dedicate this building to these
purposes."
Keepsakes
On the street level are the re
ception hall in which there is a
display of Hoover's keepsakes, a
reading room and the Lou Henry
Hoover Room.
The Lou Henry Hoover Room
. -was built in memory of Mrs. Hoo
ver, who died in January, 1944.
, In it is an almost priceless collec
tion of ancient Chinese vases, in
cluding a set of altar pieces. The I

bookcase in the room was built
at the request of Mrs. Hoover for
the White House when Hoover
was President.
A three-piece set of furniture
in the room once belonged to
President and Mrs. Lincoln. The
several examples of Belgian lace
displayed are gifts from those
people to Hoover and his wife in
gratitude for all they did during
World War I for Belgian relief.
One piece was a personal gift of
the rulers and has their initials
on it.
Carillon
The carillon of 35 bolls in the
tower was originally cast by Mar
cel Michiels in Tournai, Belgium,
for the Belgian Pavillion at the
New York World's Fair, 1939-40.
The carillon was a gift to Stan
ford University from the Belgian-
American Educational Founda
tion, which is associated with Bel
gian universities and educational
foundations, recipients of endow
ment funds from the Commission
for Relief in Belgium, 1914-19.
Hoover has an office on the
11th floor, and the Hoover Ar-J
chives are located on the 10th. i

The Hoover Library of War,
Revolution and Peace is world
famous for its unique collections
of materials for scholars every
where, according to Hoover Li
brary Archivist Thomas Thalken.
Stanford students see the tower
every day and often ride to the
top to see the view of the campus.
But few students know much
about what is inside the 285-foot
structure.
The Hoover Library Archives,
located on the 10th floor in the
tower, contain approximately five
million documents and papers
gathered in seven major collec
tions. Six of these deal with the
problem of wartime famine and
how to alleviate it. The materials
gathered there give some of the
most complete accounts of United
States wartime activities in Eu
rope available anywhere.
Not Yet Arranged
At present they are grouped
generally by organization names
but are not yet arranged and in
dexed for general use. They con
sist of letters, documents, books,

pamphlets and newspaper clip-1
pings collected at the time the
events were taking place.
The seven collections are:
• Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
• U.S. Food Administration.
• American Relief Administra
tion.
• American National Red
Cross.
• Finnish Relief Fund.
• National Committee on Food
for the Small Democracies.
• Herbert Hoover Papers.
The Commission for Relief in
Belgium was a private organiza
tion set up by ex-President Her
bert Hoover, Stanford alumnus
and member of the Board of Trus
tees, in 1914 in response to the
great need for relief for those
people at the outbreak of World
War I.
Belgian Relief
The need for relief in Belgium
at that time was so great that had
the commission not been set up
it is doubtful there would be a
Belgian nation existing today, ac
cording to Thalken.

Using blockades, the British
were trying to starve the Ger
mans into submission. Germany
had to feed her own people and
could not spare any food to feed
occupied countries. The people in
Belgium and in northern France,
in the middle of this struggle,
were on their way to starvation,
the archivist said.
Belgians had access to money
outside their country. People all
over the world were more than
generous with charitable gifts.
Committees were set up to send
goods and money to aid Belgium.
A lare:e contribution was rratde by
a student committee at Stanford.
Hoover was most gratified by the
substantial efforts put forth by
that group, Thalken said.
Government Subsidies
But the commission could not
exist only on charity aids, and the
mountainous pf-oblem lay in ob
taining government subsidies and
keeping the goods they had for
Belgian use, according to Thal
ken.
Hoover and many of the top
men on his commission served

I without pay and paid Jheir own
way if they could. As a result of
,their efforts million people
were fed for four years, Thalken i
' said.
200,000 Tourists
Probably the precursor of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium
was the American Committee in
London. This organization was
[ formed by Hoover when the war
j broke out and there were perhaps
j 200.000 American tourists in Eu
; rope, according to Thalken.
Because of ihe war, there was
a major economic shock in Eu
rope. Business came to a stand
still and American instruments
•of credit, especially travelers'
checks, were useless. For a few
days even American currency was
practically valueless. British mer
chants and hotel proprietors
would not accept American money
in payment of bills, Thalken said.
There was a group of American
; mining engineers in London who
were trusted by the British, Thal
| ken said. They were able to bor
row money from banks and lend
! it to stranded Americans. They,

with Hoover and others, formed
the American Committee in Lon
don.
It operated to take care of these
stranded Americans, many of
whom had gone to Europe on
British, French and German ships
and had no way to get back home.
Personal Loans
Hoover and some of his friends
loaned about $1 million on their
personal credit. Many recipients
had nothing to offer as security
but their personal lOU's, yet after
they returned to the United States
they repaid all but $300 of it,
As the war continued, the prob
lem of relief expanded from aid
to Americans in London to relief
for people already in war - torn
Europe. Because of his great suc
cess in relief work, Hoover was
the man people naturally expected
to become head of a relief pro
gram, Thalken said. The job soon
took on such great proportions
that Hoover established the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium.
This was the first Food Adminis
tration in the nation's history.

top to see the view of the campus.
But few students know much
about what is inside the 285-foot
structure.
The Hoover Library Archives,
located on the 10th floor in the
tower, contain approximately five
million documents and papers
gathered in seven major collec
tions. Six of these deal with the
problem of wartime famine and
how to alleviate it. The materials
gathered there give some of the
most complete accounts of United
States wartime activities in Eu
rope available anywhere.
Not Yet Arranged
At present they are grouped
generally by organization names
but are not yet arranged and in
dexed for general use. They con
sist of letters, documents, books,

pamphlets and newspaper clip-1
pings collected at the time the
events were taking place.
The seven collections are:
• Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
• U.S. Food Administration.
• American Relief Administra
tion.
• American National Red
Cross.
• Finnish Relief Fund.
• National Committee on Food
for the Small Democracies.
• Herbert Hoover Papers.
The Commission for Relief in
Belgium was a private organiza
tion set up by ex-President Her
bert Hoover, Stanford alumnus
and member of the Board of Trus
tees, in 1914 in response to the
great need for relief for those
people at the outbreak of World
War I.
Belgian Relief
The need for relief in Belgium
at that time was so great that had
the commission not been set up
it is doubtful there would be a
Belgian nation existing today, ac
cording to Thalken.

Using blockades, the British
were trying to starve the Ger
mans into submission. Germany
had to feed her own people and
could not spare any food to feed
occupied countries. The people in
Belgium and in northern France,
in the middle of this struggle,
were on their way to starvation,
the archivist said.
Belgians had access to money
outside their country. People all
over the world were more than
generous with charitable gifts.
Committees were set up to send
goods and money to aid Belgium.
A lare:e contribution was rratde by
a student committee at Stanford.
Hoover was most gratified by the
substantial efforts put forth by
that group, Thalken said.
Government Subsidies
But the commission could not
exist only on charity aids, and the
mountainous pf-oblem lay in ob
taining government subsidies and
keeping the goods they had for
Belgian use, according to Thal
ken.
Hoover and many of the top
men on his commission served

I without pay and paid Jheir own
way if they could. As a result of
,their efforts million people
were fed for four years, Thalken i
' said.
200,000 Tourists
Probably the precursor of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium
was the American Committee in
London. This organization was
[ formed by Hoover when the war
j broke out and there were perhaps
j 200.000 American tourists in Eu
; rope, according to Thalken.
Because of ihe war, there was
a major economic shock in Eu
rope. Business came to a stand
still and American instruments
•of credit, especially travelers'
checks, were useless. For a few
days even American currency was
practically valueless. British mer
chants and hotel proprietors
would not accept American money
in payment of bills, Thalken said.
There was a group of American
; mining engineers in London who
were trusted by the British, Thal
| ken said. They were able to bor
row money from banks and lend
! it to stranded Americans. They,

with Hoover and others, formed
the American Committee in Lon
don.
It operated to take care of these
stranded Americans, many of
whom had gone to Europe on
British, French and German ships
and had no way to get back home.
Personal Loans
Hoover and some of his friends
loaned about $1 million on their
personal credit. Many recipients
had nothing to offer as security
but their personal lOU's, yet after
they returned to the United States
they repaid all but $300 of it,
As the war continued, the prob
lem of relief expanded from aid
to Americans in London to relief
for people already in war - torn
Europe. Because of his great suc
cess in relief work, Hoover was
the man people naturally expected
to become head of a relief pro
gram, Thalken said. The job soon
took on such great proportions
that Hoover established the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium.
This was the first Food Adminis
tration in the nation's history.

Hoover and many of the top
men on his commission served

I without pay and paid Jheir own
way if they could. As a result of
,their efforts million people
were fed for four years, Thalken i
' said.
200,000 Tourists
Probably the precursor of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium
was the American Committee in
London. This organization was
[ formed by Hoover when the war
j broke out and there were perhaps
j 200.000 American tourists in Eu
; rope, according to Thalken.
Because of ihe war, there was
a major economic shock in Eu
rope. Business came to a stand
still and American instruments
•of credit, especially travelers'
checks, were useless. For a few
days even American currency was
practically valueless. British mer
chants and hotel proprietors
would not accept American money
in payment of bills, Thalken said.
There was a group of American
; mining engineers in London who
were trusted by the British, Thal
| ken said. They were able to bor
row money from banks and lend
! it to stranded Americans. They,

with Hoover and others, formed
the American Committee in Lon
don.
It operated to take care of these
stranded Americans, many of
whom had gone to Europe on
British, French and German ships
and had no way to get back home.
Personal Loans
Hoover and some of his friends
loaned about $1 million on their
personal credit. Many recipients
had nothing to offer as security
but their personal lOU's, yet after
they returned to the United States
they repaid all but $300 of it,
As the war continued, the prob
lem of relief expanded from aid
to Americans in London to relief
for people already in war - torn
Europe. Because of his great suc
cess in relief work, Hoover was
the man people naturally expected
to become head of a relief pro
gram, Thalken said. The job soon
took on such great proportions
that Hoover established the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium.
This was the first Food Adminis
tration in the nation's history.


AT II()()\ ER LIBRARY —Facilities of the reading room are among
the many aids <o study and research offered by the Hoover Library
on War, Revolution and Peace. Special archives housed in the
tower now contain seven collections, six of them on problems of
wartime famine. • —Daily Photo by Ed Fayle
The Hoover Institute and Li
brary on War, Revolution and
Peace was established in 1919 by
Herbert Hoover, an alumnus of
Stanford, as the Hoover War Col
lections at Stanford University.
It now houses one of the most
complete collections of research
materials in the field of world
affairs.
The building was dedicated on
June 20, 1941, with the following
inscription by Hoover: "The pur
pose of this institution is to pro
mote peace. Its records stand as
a challenge to those who promote
war. They should attract those
who search for peace. I therefore
dedicate this building to these
purposes."
Keepsakes
On the street level are the re
ception hall in which there is a
display of Hoover's keepsakes, a
reading room and the Lou Henry
Hoover Room.
The Lou Henry Hoover Room
. -was built in memory of Mrs. Hoo
ver, who died in January, 1944.
, In it is an almost priceless collec
tion of ancient Chinese vases, in
cluding a set of altar pieces. The I

bookcase in the room was built
at the request of Mrs. Hoover for
the White House when Hoover
was President.
A three-piece set of furniture
in the room once belonged to
President and Mrs. Lincoln. The
several examples of Belgian lace
displayed are gifts from those
people to Hoover and his wife in
gratitude for all they did during
World War I for Belgian relief.
One piece was a personal gift of
the rulers and has their initials
on it.
Carillon
The carillon of 35 bolls in the
tower was originally cast by Mar
cel Michiels in Tournai, Belgium,
for the Belgian Pavillion at the
New York World's Fair, 1939-40.
The carillon was a gift to Stan
ford University from the Belgian-
American Educational Founda
tion, which is associated with Bel
gian universities and educational
foundations, recipients of endow
ment funds from the Commission
for Relief in Belgium, 1914-19.
Hoover has an office on the
11th floor, and the Hoover Ar-J
chives are located on the 10th. i

The Hoover Library of War,
Revolution and Peace is world
famous for its unique collections
of materials for scholars every
where, according to Hoover Li
brary Archivist Thomas Thalken.
Stanford students see the tower
every day and often ride to the
top to see the view of the campus.
But few students know much
about what is inside the 285-foot
structure.
The Hoover Library Archives,
located on the 10th floor in the
tower, contain approximately five
million documents and papers
gathered in seven major collec
tions. Six of these deal with the
problem of wartime famine and
how to alleviate it. The materials
gathered there give some of the
most complete accounts of United
States wartime activities in Eu
rope available anywhere.
Not Yet Arranged
At present they are grouped
generally by organization names
but are not yet arranged and in
dexed for general use. They con
sist of letters, documents, books,

pamphlets and newspaper clip-1
pings collected at the time the
events were taking place.
The seven collections are:
• Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
• U.S. Food Administration.
• American Relief Administra
tion.
• American National Red
Cross.
• Finnish Relief Fund.
• National Committee on Food
for the Small Democracies.

The Commission for Relief in
Belgium was a private organiza
tion set up by ex-President Her
bert Hoover, Stanford alumnus
and member of the Board of Trus
tees, in 1914 in response to the
great need for relief for those
people at the outbreak of World
War I.
Belgian Relief
The need for relief in Belgium
at that time was so great that had
the commission not been set up
it is doubtful there would be a
Belgian nation existing today, ac
cording to Thalken.

Using blockades, the British
were trying to starve the Ger
mans into submission. Germany
had to feed her own people and
could not spare any food to feed
occupied countries. The people in
Belgium and in northern France,
in the middle of this struggle,
were on their way to starvation,
the archivist said.
Belgians had access to money
outside their country. People all
over the world were more than
generous with charitable gifts.
Committees were set up to send
goods and money to aid Belgium.
A lare:e contribution was rratde by
a student committee at Stanford.
Hoover was most gratified by the
substantial efforts put forth by
that group, Thalken said.
Government Subsidies
But the commission could not
exist only on charity aids, and the
mountainous pf-oblem lay in ob
taining government subsidies and
keeping the goods they had for
Belgian use, according to Thal
ken.
Hoover and many of the top

Stanford, as the Hoover War Col
lections at Stanford University.
It now houses one of the most
complete collections of research
materials in the field of world
affairs.
The building was dedicated on
June 20, 1941, with the following
inscription by Hoover: "The pur
pose of this institution is to pro
mote peace. Its records stand as
a challenge to those who promote
war. They should attract those
who search for peace. I therefore
dedicate this building to these
purposes."
Keepsakes
On the street level are the re
ception hall in which there is a
display of Hoover's keepsakes, a
reading room and the Lou Henry
Hoover Room.
The Lou Henry Hoover Room
. -was built in memory of Mrs. Hoo
ver, who died in January, 1944.
, In it is an almost priceless collec
tion of ancient Chinese vases, in
cluding a set of altar pieces. The I

bookcase in the room was built
at the request of Mrs. Hoover for
the White House when Hoover
was President.
A three-piece set of furniture
in the room once belonged to
President and Mrs. Lincoln. The
several examples of Belgian lace
displayed are gifts from those
people to Hoover and his wife in
gratitude for all they did during
World War I for Belgian relief.
One piece was a personal gift of
the rulers and has their initials
on it.
Carillon
The carillon of 35 bolls in the
tower was originally cast by Mar
cel Michiels in Tournai, Belgium,
for the Belgian Pavillion at the
New York World's Fair, 1939-40.
The carillon was a gift to Stan
ford University from the Belgian-
American Educational Founda
tion, which is associated with Bel
gian universities and educational
foundations, recipients of endow
ment funds from the Commission
for Relief in Belgium, 1914-19.
Hoover has an office on the
11th floor, and the Hoover Ar-J
chives are located on the 10th. i

The Hoover Library of War,
Revolution and Peace is world
famous for its unique collections
of materials for scholars every
where, according to Hoover Li
brary Archivist Thomas Thalken.
Stanford students see the tower
every day and often ride to the
top to see the view of the campus.
But few students know much
about what is inside the 285-foot
structure.
The Hoover Library Archives,
located on the 10th floor in the
tower, contain approximately five
million documents and papers
gathered in seven major collec
tions. Six of these deal with the
problem of wartime famine and
how to alleviate it. The materials
gathered there give some of the
most complete accounts of United
States wartime activities in Eu
rope available anywhere.
Not Yet Arranged
At present they are grouped
generally by organization names
but are not yet arranged and in
dexed for general use. They con
sist of letters, documents, books,

pamphlets and newspaper clip-1
pings collected at the time the
events were taking place.
The seven collections are:
• Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
• U.S. Food Administration.
• American Relief Administra
tion.
• American National Red
Cross.
• Finnish Relief Fund.
• National Committee on Food
for the Small Democracies.
• Herbert Hoover Papers.
The Commission for Relief in
Belgium was a private organiza
tion set up by ex-President Her
bert Hoover, Stanford alumnus
and member of the Board of Trus
tees, in 1914 in response to the
great need for relief for those
people at the outbreak of World
War I.
Belgian Relief
The need for relief in Belgium
at that time was so great that had
the commission not been set up
it is doubtful there would be a
Belgian nation existing today, ac
cording to Thalken.

Using blockades, the British
were trying to starve the Ger
mans into submission. Germany
had to feed her own people and
could not spare any food to feed
occupied countries. The people in
Belgium and in northern France,
in the middle of this struggle,
were on their way to starvation,
the archivist said.
Belgians had access to money
outside their country. People all
over the world were more than
generous with charitable gifts.
Committees were set up to send
goods and money to aid Belgium.
A lare:e contribution was rratde by
a student committee at Stanford.
Hoover was most gratified by the
substantial efforts put forth by
that group, Thalken said.
Government Subsidies
But the commission could not
exist only on charity aids, and the
mountainous pf-oblem lay in ob
taining government subsidies and
keeping the goods they had for
Belgian use, according to Thal
ken.
Hoover and many of the top
men on his commission served

I without pay and paid Jheir own
way if they could. As a result of
,their efforts million people
were fed for four years, Thalken i
' said.
200,000 Tourists
Probably the precursor of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium
was the American Committee in
London. This organization was
[ formed by Hoover when the war
j broke out and there were perhaps
j 200.000 American tourists in Eu
; rope, according to Thalken.
Because of ihe war, there was
a major economic shock in Eu
rope. Business came to a stand
still and American instruments
•of credit, especially travelers'
checks, were useless. For a few
days even American currency was
practically valueless. British mer
chants and hotel proprietors
would not accept American money
in payment of bills, Thalken said.
There was a group of American
; mining engineers in London who
were trusted by the British, Thal
| ken said. They were able to bor
row money from banks and lend
! it to stranded Americans. They,

with Hoover and others, formed
the American Committee in Lon
don.
It operated to take care of these
stranded Americans, many of
whom had gone to Europe on
British, French and German ships
and had no way to get back home.
Personal Loans
Hoover and some of his friends
loaned about $1 million on their
personal credit. Many recipients
had nothing to offer as security
but their personal lOU's, yet after
they returned to the United States
they repaid all but $300 of it,
As the war continued, the prob
lem of relief expanded from aid
to Americans in London to relief
for people already in war - torn
Europe. Because of his great suc
cess in relief work, Hoover was
the man people naturally expected
to become head of a relief pro
gram, Thalken said. The job soon
took on such great proportions
that Hoover established the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium.
This was the first Food Adminis
tration in the nation's history.
