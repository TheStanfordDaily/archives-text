# KZSU To Broadcast For Nine Hours Daily
## 
### Stove Deck 
Anyone venturing into the sub
depths of Memorial Auditorium
this quarter will find unusual
amounts of activity centered
around campus radio station KZ
SU. Carpenters and student hope
fuls are getting to be part of the
regular staff, for this year is a
milestone in the history of KZ
SU: expansion and remodeling
are in order.
Beginning this quarter, accord
ing to assistant program mana
ger Jim Campbell, KZSU will
start broadcasting at 3 p.m., one
hour earlier than in past quar
ters. This makes a total of nine
hours on the air, compared with
the four-hour stretch when the
station started in 1946.
$5000 Grant
A University grant of approxi
mately $5000 proVided KZSU the
wherewithal to begin eight years
ago, when the station consisted
of only one studio on the second
floor of Memorial Auditorium.
The basement studio and of
fices were opened in the spring
of 1955, including a record-press
ing machine. As a special service
the radio station records the Big
Game Gaieties and the Spring
Sing in Frost Amphitheater, rec
ords of which may be purchased
by students.
KZSU has additional reason to

rejoice because of its recent ap
pointment as regional headquar
ters for the Intercollegiate Broad
casting System. The appointment
makes KZSU the deposit center
for taped programs for the west
coast and mountain states.
The* radio station Itself is ex
panding along with its reputa
tion, which is where the carpen
ters enter the picture. Basement
facilities for the engineering and
music departments have been
nearly doubled.
More Space
The office staff under Joyce
Johnson and Phil Biles' engineer
ing crew will have space to move
around in, and the library of
more than 3000 records can be
properly catalogued.
Station manager Terry Bate
man predicts that the new trans
mitter slated for Wilbur houses
will be installed! sometime this
quarter, while transmitters are
pending for Florence Moore and
Union halls.
High spot of afternoon listen
ing will be "Top Forty Time,"
featuring the top 40 listings
across the nations, as well as sev
eral of the past successful shows.
Seductive Stanford Sadie, whose
identity is traditionally kept se
cret until the end of autumn
quarter, will be back on Monday
evenings.


WHO IS STANFORD SADIE?—Last night, over
rumpus radio KZSU, five girts tried out for the
position of Stanford Sadie, mystery voice on the
evening record show. Picked for sweetness of

tone and warmth of voice was . . . her name
will disclosed at the end of autumn quarter.
Anyway, here's her picture.

WHO IS STANFORD SADIE?—Last night, over
rumpus radio KZSU, five girts tried out for the

tone and warmth of voice was . . . her name
will disclosed at the end of autumn quarter.
Anyway, here's her picture.

Anyone venturing into the sub
depths of Memorial Auditorium
this quarter will find unusual
amounts of activity centered
around campus radio station KZ
SU. Carpenters and student hope
fuls are getting to be part of the
regular staff, for this year is a
milestone in the history of KZ
SU: expansion and remodeling
are in order.
Beginning this quarter, accord
ing to assistant program mana
ger Jim Campbell, KZSU will
start broadcasting at 3 p.m., one
hour earlier than in past quar
ters. This makes a total of nine
hours on the air, compared with
the four-hour stretch when the
station started in 1946.
$5000 Grant
A University grant of approxi
mately $5000 proVided KZSU the
wherewithal to begin eight years
ago, when the station consisted
of only one studio on the second
floor of Memorial Auditorium.
The basement studio and of
fices were opened in the spring
of 1955, including a record-press
ing machine. As a special service
the radio station records the Big
Game Gaieties and the Spring
Sing in Frost Amphitheater, rec
ords of which may be purchased
by students.
KZSU has additional reason to

rejoice because of its recent ap
pointment as regional headquar
ters for the Intercollegiate Broad
casting System. The appointment
makes KZSU the deposit center
for taped programs for the west
coast and mountain states.
The* radio station Itself is ex
panding along with its reputa
tion, which is where the carpen
ters enter the picture. Basement
facilities for the engineering and
music departments have been
nearly doubled.
