# Cap and Gown Has 50-Year Record of Service to Stanford
## Annual Calendar Sale Begins This Week; Proceeds Will Benefit Scholarship Fund 
### 
1956 is a year of many mile
stones at Stanford not the least
of which are the 50th anniversa-1
ries of the great earthquake and
the founding of Cap and Gown.
The effects of the former have
been all but forgotten in the in
tervening half-century, but Cap
and Gown, senior women's hono-1
rary society, has,compiled a dis
tinguished record of service and 1
leadership since its organization '
in April, 1906.
When Cap and Gown was or- j
ganized by a group of four Stan
ford women students, a dual pur
pose was decided upon. To be se
lected for membership in the
group was to be recognition for
leadership, service and scholar
ship, so the first purpose was
honorary.
Second Goal
The second goal was to offer
service to the University. Rais
ing funds for a women's club
house was the first project de
cided upon by the group.
In the early twenties, when
Stanford first began to charge
tuition, a now opportunity pre
sented itself in the field of schol
arships'. The first Cap and Gown
scholarships were offered in 1924,
and have been continuous since
that time.
After World War IT, Miss Ann
Guthrie suggested that Cap and
Gown extend a scholarship to a
foreign student to further inter
national understanding. Miss Gu
thrie, who had worked in Manila
during the war, helped select the
first Cap and Gown foreign schol
ar, whom she met in the Philip
pines.
At first, Cap and Gown spon
sored a foreign scholar every
other year, but at the present
time, they co-sponsor a scholar
ship with the ASSU every year.
Britta Bat tig, a senior from
Vienna, Austria, is the ASSU-
Cap and Gown scholar for 1956.
In addition, Vicky Hale, Stanford
junior, holds the yearly domestic
Cap and Gown scholarship.

ing problem in 1938, when she I

Mrs. Bacon was one of the I
many active Cap and Gown alum
nae, and when she returned to ;
the campus with her husband,
Professor Harold M. Bacon, she
suggested the publication of a

i to be sold by Cap and Gown for
their scholarship fund.
Since that time, the Cap and
Gown calendar has made its ap

features full-page pictures of the
Stanford campus,

tervening half-century, but Cap
and Gown, senior women's hono-1

tinguished record of service and 1
leadership since its organization '
in April, 1906.
When Cap and Gown was or- j
ganized by a group of four Stan
ford women students, a dual pur
pose was decided upon. To be se
lected for membership in the
group was to be recognition for
leadership, service and scholar
ship, so the first purpose was
honorary.
Second Goal
The second goal was to offer
service to the University. Rais
ing funds for a women's club
house was the first project de
cided upon by the group.
In the early twenties, when
Stanford first began to charge
tuition, a now opportunity pre
sented itself in the field of schol
arships'. The first Cap and Gown
scholarships were offered in 1924,
and have been continuous since
that time.
After World War IT, Miss Ann
Guthrie suggested that Cap and
Gown extend a scholarship to a
foreign student to further inter
national understanding. Miss Gu
thrie, who had worked in Manila
during the war, helped select the
first Cap and Gown foreign schol
ar, whom she met in the Philip
pines.
At first, Cap and Gown spon
sored a foreign scholar every
other year, but at the present
time, they co-sponsor a scholar
ship with the ASSU every year.
