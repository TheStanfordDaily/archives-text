# Looking It Over

With Jerry Kelly
You witnessed it at Stanford Stadium, then you heard it over the
radio. Yes, the Indians lost two football games in a row, an unpardon
able sin for many "campus" teams.
However, a look at the facts is necessary before judgment of the
1956 Stanford squad can justifiably be reached. Excuses are not

forthcoming, nor is the old stand
by "It was a moral victory for
our boys."
Coach Chuck Taylor's gridders
lost a pair of football games fair
'n'-square. They lost those foot
ball games, without reservations,
to the two best teams in the na
tion. An exaggeration?
Michigan State and Ohio State
may well lose a tussle this yeaV.
Meeting teams of Stanford's qual
ity each and every Saturday calls
for an upset occasionally. The In
dians upset OSU last season, the
same Buckeye outfit that went
two seasons without a defeat in
the toughest conference in the
country.
Take the other highly "rated"
teams across the country- Okla
homa, Texas Christian, Georgia
Tech and Pittsburgh. Match their
Saturday schedules and the dif
ference is evident. Big Ten pow
erhouses as well as PCC teams
must be "up" every week, plan

week by week. It takes its toll. Injuries in key positions are much
more prevalent when starters must continually compete at full speed.
What this all leads up to is a pat on the back for the entire Stan
ford team a group of eager, spirited collegians who played their
hearts out these past two Saturdays against the giants of the pigskin
ranks. Taylor was forced to dig three deep to fill some positions
before the victory bells finally toiled in Columbus.
Taylor is a coaches' coach with a sound philosophy concerning
collegiate football today. Not pushed by administration and alumni
cries of "Win! Win! Win!", he is proud of his teamsâ€”win, lose or
tie if the boys give Iheir all. No one should doubt that his Indians
gave their all against the Big Ten.
What should count in college football is that the students and
coaches are satisfied with their teams' efforts. Taylor, in addressing
the Northern California Football Writers' Association yesterday,
made it public that he is "highly pleased with the results and the
play of the team." The ensuing home football games will give the
students an opportunity to demonstrate whether they are "pleased."
The coaching staff offered no excuses for dropping two "toughies"
in the spotlighted intersectionals. Holding Michigan State to a 7-7
halftime deadlock put a scare into the Spartans, as did tying Ohio
State, 20-20, at the three-quarter mark.
Monday-morning quarterbacks always place their favorites in the
"if" category. If Stanford would have not fumbled here ... if that
pass hadn't been intercepted. . . . Too many "ifs." Forced to use a
host of second- and third-stringers because of unprecedented injuries,
Taylor's men came through, giving their best. And, incidentally,
showing a record crowd of over 82,000 Ohio fans exciting football,
wide-open Taylor style.
Now that the Indians have faced the cream of the crop, Taylor
has a smoother road ahead, although there's not a breather in the lot.
Injuries to seven key players are of primary concern. But the work
of trainer Connie Jarvis is always topnotch.
An additional pat on the back to our neighbors to the north. Cali
fornia upheld PCC football by licking Pittsburgh, top East Coast rep
resentative, 14-0.
