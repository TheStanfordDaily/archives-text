# DREAM COMES TRUE
## Larsen In Perfect Win 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (UP)
Towering Don Larsen pitched the
first perfect game in World Se
ries history today to give tlr?
New York Yankees a 2-0 win over
the Brooklyn Dodgers and send
them one game up in the classic.
Backed by the home-run hat oJ
Mickey Mantle and fielding g?ms
by the Oklahoma Kid and gan
gling Gil McDougal, the six-foot
four-inch right-hander thrived
64,319 screaming Yankee Sta
dium fans as he rewrote the rec
ord book with baseball's first no
hit, no-run, no-walk masterpiece
in 34 years.
The last perfect game was by
Charley Robertson of the White
Sox, way back on April 30, 1922.
Nobody expected such a feat
from the unpredictable Don a
long-time resident of the Yankee
doghouse who failed to last in the
second game of this Series.
Two Assists
But the big fellow from Michi
gan City, Ind., enthralled the
sports world today as he took two
big assists from Mantle and an
other from McDougald and com
pletely crushed the Dodgers with
97 pressure-packed pitches.
It was a heart-stopping effort
as Larsen, a carefree guy who
called the Series overemphasized,
surpassed the efforts of the
greatest names in the annals of
the game and hung a heart-break
ing defeat on old Sal t "The Bar
ber") Maglie.
The Barber, winner of the
opening game of the Series,
couldn't match this performance
despite a gallant effort in which
he gave the Yankees only five
hits. Only three men in history
ever have been able to post World
Series one-hitters Ed Reulbach
of the Cubs in 1906, Claude Pas

seau of the Cubs in 1945 and Bill
Bevens of the Yankees in 1947.
The 27-year-old Larsen needed
two great saves one by McDou
gald in the second and another in
the fifth by Mantle, whose fourth
inning homer gave Larsen his
first run.
McDougald, the skinny Scots
man, was Larsen's hero in the
second when Jackie Robinson
powered a smash which scooted
off Andy Carey's glove. Lean Gil
pounced on it and rifled a throw
to first which caught Robinson
by an eyelash.
Ilodges Drive
Then, in the fifth, big Gil
Hodges lashed out a long drive to
left center, which looked as if it
was going through for an extra
base hit. But Mantle, running as
if htf had wings on his heels,
made a sensational lunging back

handed stab and the ball smashed
into his reaching glove.
Larsen took it from there after
being given another run by his
teammates in the sixth as the
Yankees gol to sallow-faced Sal
for three hits by Carey, Bauer's
run-producing single after Lar
son sacrificed Carey along, and a
single by Joe Collins. 1
No Stopping Larsen
There was no stopping the
strapping Larsen then. Inning by
inning, he sent those disgusted
Dodgers down in regular order.
But it was far from monotonous.
As well as pitching the first
perfect game in Series history,
Larsen rubbed from the record
books the mark for most innings
in which no runner reached first
base. The best anyone ever had
done before was seven and one
third innings,

Nobody expected such a feat
from the unpredictable Don a
long-time resident of the Yankee
doghouse who failed to last in the
second game of this Series.
Two Assists
But the big fellow from Michi
gan City, Ind., enthralled the
sports world today as he took two
big assists from Mantle and an
other from McDougald and com
pletely crushed the Dodgers with
97 pressure-packed pitches.
It was a heart-stopping effort
as Larsen, a carefree guy who
called the Series overemphasized,
surpassed the efforts of the
greatest names in the annals of
the game and hung a heart-break
ing defeat on old Sal t "The Bar
ber") Maglie.
The Barber, winner of the
opening game of the Series,
couldn't match this performance
despite a gallant effort in which
he gave the Yankees only five
hits. Only three men in history
ever have been able to post World
Series one-hitters Ed Reulbach
of the Cubs in 1906, Claude Pas

seau of the Cubs in 1945 and Bill
Bevens of the Yankees in 1947.
The 27-year-old Larsen needed
two great saves one by McDou
gald in the second and another in
the fifth by Mantle, whose fourth
inning homer gave Larsen his
first run.
McDougald, the skinny Scots
man, was Larsen's hero in the
second when Jackie Robinson
powered a smash which scooted
off Andy Carey's glove. Lean Gil
pounced on it and rifled a throw
to first which caught Robinson
by an eyelash.
Ilodges Drive
Then, in the fifth, big Gil
Hodges lashed out a long drive to
left center, which looked as if it
was going through for an extra
base hit. But Mantle, running as
if htf had wings on his heels,
made a sensational lunging back

handed stab and the ball smashed
into his reaching glove.
Larsen took it from there after
being given another run by his
teammates in the sixth as the
Yankees gol to sallow-faced Sal
for three hits by Carey, Bauer's
run-producing single after Lar
son sacrificed Carey along, and a
single by Joe Collins. 1
No Stopping Larsen
There was no stopping the
strapping Larsen then. Inning by
inning, he sent those disgusted
Dodgers down in regular order.
But it was far from monotonous.
As well as pitching the first
perfect game in Series history,
Larsen rubbed from the record
books the mark for most innings
in which no runner reached first
base. The best anyone ever had
done before was seven and one
third innings,

Towering Don Larsen pitched the

64,319 screaming Yankee Sta
