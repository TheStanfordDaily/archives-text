### 
SALEM. Ore., Oct. 8 (UP) — 'I rn darned glad to see him get
it, especially because he's a Yankee."
Those were the words today of Floyd (Bill) Bevens, who until
today had come closer than any other man to pitching a no-hit
game in the World Series.
Bevens, now a truck company salesman here, was speaking
of Don Larsen of the New York Yankees, who today blanked
Brooklyn 2-0 in the first perfect World Series game. Bevens
watched the game on television.
Larsen was quote:! today as saying, "I was so damn nervous
in the ninth inning I almost fell down out there . . . my legs
were rubbery . .
Bevens said that when Dale Mitchell came up with two out
in the ninth against Larsen "I was worried. He's awfully fast,
i thought he might top one in the infield and beat it out."
Today's Yankee catcher was Yogi Berra, the same man who
caught Bevens in 1947 and the only Yankee left from that world
championship club.
