# Injuries May Hurt Indians In San Jose Game Saturday
## Coach Taylor and Staff Hunting New Linemen From Second Siring and Junior Varsity Ranks 
### Steve Baffrey 
The injury-laden Stanford Indi
ans began a search for reserve
strength yesterday in the wake of
a phenomenal number of injuries
to first-stringers. Seven of the
pre-season Card starters will not
see service in Saturday's San Jose
State game here.
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his
Indians through a general prac
tice session yesterday, giving
what remains of his first string
a comparatively light workout.
Meanwhile the coaching staff
hunted far and wide for possible
candidates for the open holes in
the line.
Ends Jerry Beatie and Gary
Van Galder, guards Meigs Jones
and Dorr Manoukian, center Bob
Long, tackle Steve Docter and
fullback Archie Schmitt will be
on the non-active list come Satur
day. Coaeh Taylor 1 will be naming
replacements today or 1 tomorrow.
After 1 Saturday's loss to Ohio
State, Taylor lauded the team on
their ground offense. He added
more praise for quarterback John
Brodie's passing aim. It isn't
these factors that the Indians will
be concerned with on Saturday,
however.
The Indian line has been opened
wide by injuries, and Taylor and
his staff have been searching jun
ior - v a r si t y and second-string

teams to find the needed support.
Named yesterday as possible can
didates for the slots were JV cen
ters Pete Swan son and John
Thomas and JV halfback Steve
Resnick.
The San Jose Golden Raiders,
currently sporting a 1-1 record
this season, have been labeled a
"team to watch." The Raiders
present mostly a passing attack
similar to the Cards. Their ace
quarterback, Bob Reinhart, has
completed over- 60 per cent of his
passes, while the second stringer,
Marv McKean, is well over 50 per
cent.
In their previous outings this
year the Raiders downed Drake,
26-7, and were dumped by Wash
ington State, 33-18.
