# SUPREME COURT
## Court Faces Heavy Burden In New Term 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (UP) â€”
The Supreme Court agreed today
to rule on dozens of cases includ
ing a heavy burden of Commu
nist - loyalty issues, labor ques
tions and the anti-trust status of
professional football.
Holding its first business ses
sion of a new term, the court also
added to judicial history by turn
ing down appeals in a number of
cases, including a lone appeal
from one of its de-segregation
rulings.
The Court staked out a heavy
work load for its 1956-57 term in
a series of brief orders without
written opinions. Oral arguments
and decisions of cases accepted
for review will be scheduled later.
The justices, in their first hear
ing of the term, later heard law
yers for 14 California Commu
nists ask a reversal of their con
spiracy conviction. The defend
ants claimed the government had
not proved either that they con
spired or advocated violence.
The Communists also contend
ed they did not hold high posts in
the party comparable to Eugene
Dennis, national party secretary,
and other top Reds jailed in 1951.
The Court agreed to decide
whether Congressional investiga
tors lpiay require an ex-Cornmu
nist to name persons he knew in
the past as Communists. The
question was raised by John T.
Watkins, Rock Island, 111., union
leader convicted of contempt in
a 1954 appearance before Ihe
House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities.
