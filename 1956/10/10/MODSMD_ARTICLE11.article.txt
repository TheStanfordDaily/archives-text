## Eisenhower Accuses Democratic Candidate Of 'Irresponsibility' 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 9 (UPI
—Adlai E. Stevenson charged to
night that the nation is falling
behind in atomic power leader
ship and top responsibility in the
field has been abdicated to pri
vate industry.
The Democratic Presidential
candidate, starting a five-slate
Western tour which took him
through Montana and Idaho ear
lier in the day, said many emi
nent atomic scientists agree that
U.S. atomic power projects are
lagging.
The Eisenhower administration
not preparing to "carry out the
is not prepared and is evidently
atoms for peace program for
which it took responsibility Jpo
fore the world," Stevenson said.
The administration has shack
led the program "to the parochial
needs and predilections of the pri
vate power industry," he charged.
I{« , p , *' , t. 4 < Stand
Stevenson repeated his stand
that steps should be taken by the
federal government to "find a
way to stop the exploding of the
huge hydrogen bomb."
He said his original proposal
was greeted "only with sneers
and astonishing distortions of
what I said, and with implica
tions (by the Republicans) that
even talking about this preju
dices the nation's security."
Stevenson added that his sug
gestion that a way be found to
stop the H-bomb tests "has al
ways been made without criti
cism of the present administra
tion's policy of hydrogen weapon
development, which President
Truman began."
Meanwhile in Pittsburgh Presi
dent Eisenhower accused Steven
son of resorting to "political irre
sponsibility at its worst."
"Plain Talking"
In what he termed a speech of
"plain talking" on the campaign
"road of truth," Eisenhower hit
back at charges of the Demo
cratic- Presidential nominee and
his running mate, Senator Estes
Kefauver, on the "big business
vs. the'little fellow," draft, H
bomb test, national defense and
peace issues.
Replying to Stevenson's state
ments that the draft might be
halted in the foreseeable future
and the United States should take
the lead in halting H-bomb tests,
Eisenhower emphasized that he
spoke "with the greatest serious
ness."
"I, as your President and com
mander-in-chief of the armfd
forces cannot and will not make
proposals contrary to national in
terest—nor offer you attractive
prospects unjustified by world re
alities," Eisenhower said.
