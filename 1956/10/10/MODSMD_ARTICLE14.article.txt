# ABC Chief Sees No Chance of Drinking Age Being Lowered
## Officials Fear Possible Boost in Felonies Fullenwider States Law Not Full Prohibition Of Minors' Drinking 
### 
There is very little chance that
the California legislature could he
convinced to lower the state di ink
ing age from 21 to 18, believe?;
Frank Fullenwider, area adminis
trator for the Alcoholic Beverages
Commission.
In an informal talk at the Alpha
Sigma Phi house last night, Ful
lenwider said legislators fee) that
lowering the age might increase
juvenile delinquency.
!le cited statistics showing lhat
20 to 25 per cent of murders and
major felonies are committed
under the influence of alcohol
"Five of you Alpha Sigs will be
alcoholics at some time, just under
the law of averages," ho added.
"And they may not feel like giving
you any more of a head start."
Answers Argument
Fullenwider answered the argu
ment of New York's lower drink
ing age (1.8) by saying that olhei
states treat many laws differently.
In Nevada you can get a divorce
after six weeks. Each operates ac
cording to its own political back
ground and problems.
"The Alcoholic Beverages law."
he said, "operates on the premi ,e
that only adults are capable of
making a decision on drinking It
has to take averages into con.id
eration in setting an ago limit."
Explaining the law as it pre
ently stands, Fullenwider raid
that there is no blanket prohibi
tion against minors drinking. If
they can get alcohol without pur
chase, and consume it in a private
place, the law will not touch them
If someone over 21 buys lirpior
and passes it around in a public
place, it is strictly illegal. Even
parents may be prosecuted for
giving a drink to their children.
"Makes Nuisance"
"These cases only come up if
the minor then goes out and
makes a nuisance of himself while
drunk," Fullenwider added. "Then
the police will request the ABC
to backtrack and find out where
the liquor was obtained."
The commission is mainly in
terested in catching licensed per
sons caught selling to minors Tn
carrying this out. t hey may a I o
have to bring in the purchaser.
But officials don't usually go
out with the express purpose of
rounding up under-age drinker;.
Fullenwider said. There just oe
nol enough enforeement of lien
to go around. He said his offiee
has 132 people to cover 16,000
1 licensed premises.

' large functions such as the fun
I ior Prom and the Military Ball on
the campus. He considers it defj
| nitely unwise to hold these p,u he

There is very little chance that
the California legislature could he
convinced to lower the state di ink
ing age from 21 to 18, believe?;
Frank Fullenwider, area adminis
trator for the Alcoholic Beverages
Commission.
In an informal talk at the Alpha
Sigma Phi house last night, Ful
lenwider said legislators fee) that
lowering the age might increase
juvenile delinquency.
!le cited statistics showing lhat
20 to 25 per cent of murders and
major felonies are committed
under the influence of alcohol
"Five of you Alpha Sigs will be
alcoholics at some time, just under
the law of averages," ho added.
"And they may not feel like giving
you any more of a head start."
Answers Argument
Fullenwider answered the argu
ment of New York's lower drink
ing age (1.8) by saying that olhei
states treat many laws differently.
In Nevada you can get a divorce
after six weeks. Each operates ac
cording to its own political back
ground and problems.
"The Alcoholic Beverages law."
he said, "operates on the premi ,e
that only adults are capable of
making a decision on drinking It
has to take averages into con.id
eration in setting an ago limit."
Explaining the law as it pre
ently stands, Fullenwider raid
that there is no blanket prohibi
tion against minors drinking. If
they can get alcohol without pur
chase, and consume it in a private
place, the law will not touch them
If someone over 21 buys lirpior
and passes it around in a public
place, it is strictly illegal. Even
parents may be prosecuted for
giving a drink to their children.
"Makes Nuisance"
"These cases only come up if
the minor then goes out and
makes a nuisance of himself while
drunk," Fullenwider added. "Then
the police will request the ABC
to backtrack and find out where
the liquor was obtained."
The commission is mainly in
terested in catching licensed per
sons caught selling to minors Tn
carrying this out. t hey may a I o
have to bring in the purchaser.
But officials don't usually go
out with the express purpose of
rounding up under-age drinker;.
Fullenwider said. There just oe
nol enough enforeement of lien
to go around. He said his offiee
has 132 people to cover 16,000
1 licensed premises.
