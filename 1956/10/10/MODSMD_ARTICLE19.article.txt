Association for tlk* Advancement of Colored
People was formed last March, the question
was raised as to what logical connection Stan
lord would have with an organization whose
activities are centered primarily in areas with
great integration problems.
An answer, at least in part, came Monday
night when the Halo Alto-Stanford NAACP
sponsored a jazz concert at Palo Alto High
School.
The program included a lecture hy S. I.
Hayakawa on jazz forms, illustrated hy Boh
Scohey, his Frisco Jazz Hand and singer Lizzie
Miles. They gave two concerts and both times
they played to an overflow house.
Fvery ticket bought for the concert was a
contribution of $1.50 to the NAACP Fight for
Freedom fund.

A large part of those in the audience were
Stanford students. Only a minority were actu
ally members of the NAACP, but all who at
tended were part of a group interested in some
thing produced hy Negro-white cooperationâ€”
American jazz.
The field of jazz is not the oidy medium
through which the NAACP can reach Stanford
students. Hut one of the most valuable rewards
of participation in NAACP activities is the
chance to gain a better understanding of the
unique contribution of the American Negro
to our culture.
Those who attended Monday night's concert
came away with more than just an enjoyable
evening. We think they got at least a small
taste of what it means to be united hy cultural
interests and hy enthusiasm in a group where
race makes no difference.
