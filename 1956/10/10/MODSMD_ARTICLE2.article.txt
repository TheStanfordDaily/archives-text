# Court of Appeals Supports Private Dam Construction
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 (UP) â€”
Public power advocates were
dealt a major setback today when
the U.S. Appeals Court here un
animously refused to block pri
vate construction of the contro
versial Hells Canyon dams on
the Snake River.
A public power group promptly
anonunced "the fight is not over"
and promised further court ap
peals. It said it will take the case
to the Supreme Court if neces
sary.
The Federal Power Commis
sion, after a long public-versus
private power struggle, last year
licensed the Idaho Power Com
pany to build three dams in the
Hells Canyon area between Idaho
and Oregon, the deepest natural
gorge on the North American
continent.
Public power groups in the
Northwest have contested the
FPC action. The fight has be !
come a key issue in the re-elec
tion contest of Senator Wayne
Morse (D-Ore.). Democrats Adlai
E. Stevenson and Senator Estes
Kefauver also have made it an
issue in their attacks on the Ei- j
senhower administration.
Meanwhile the Idaho Power
Company has spent millions on
construction of its first dam.
A three-judge panel of the Ap
peals Court, refusing to block
work on the dams, said it could
find no instance in which the
FPC "went beyond the confines
of the constitution or the govern-!
ing statute" in licensing the con- j
struction.
