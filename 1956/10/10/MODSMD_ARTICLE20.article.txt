# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Which Party Offers More to Farmer? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
Of all the issues debated upon in this elec
tion year, the least understood and probably
the most controversial is that of domestic farm
policy.
The problem is simply stated. How can the
federal government keep farm income at a
par with the rest of the nation without build
ing up tremendous stockpile surpluses ami
without throwing the burden of keeping that
farm income high on the shoulders of the rest
of the taxpayers?
The solution is still undiscovered. There is
not, so far as anyone knows, any one formula
that will solve the problem.
The background facts are essentially these:
Because of improved farming methods, because
of formerly untilh-d lands now under cultiva
tion, America is now producing more farm
commodities than the market will support at
parity prices. (Parity is an index based upon
the purchasing power of a commodity figured
for a certain base year.)
The market price on these commodities,
though depressed, is still sufficiently high to
prevent unloading surpluses 011 the foreign
market, except under government - supported
programs, even though shortages of these com
modities exist elsewhere. To unload them 011
the foreign market would reduce farm income
still further by lowering the market rate.
But, even though farm prices are down, con
sumer prices are high and any arbitrary raising
of the farm prices would cause an increase in
consumer prices. There is good evidence that
the market would not hold up under any great
increase in farm commodity prices.
As the Democrats see it, there must be a
long-range solution to the whole problem. Hut
until that solution can be put into effect, the
farmers' purchasing power must be maintained
at at least 90 per cent parity, if not 100 per
cent, by supporting the basic commodities
which include wheat, rice, cotton, corn, peanuts
and tobacco.
To solve the long-range problem, Democratic
economists plan to:
• Sponsor a more positive and comprehen
sive soil, water and forest conservation pro
gram ;
• Provide assistance to family farmers in
the form of "specially designed credit and
price-support programs, technical aid and en
larged soil conservation allowances";
• Maintain adequate reserves of agricultural
commodities for national security purposes;
• Promote international exchange of com
modities by creating an International Food
Reserve, fostering commodity agreements and
vigorously administering the Foreign Agricul
tural Trade Development and Assistance Act;
• Inaugurate a food-stamp or other supple
mental food program administered by appro
priate state or local agencies to insure that 110
needy family shall be denied an adequate and
wholesome diet because of low income;
• Devise and employ effective means to
reduce the spread between producers' prices
and consumers' costs and improve market fa
cilities and marketing prices.
I'arity ratio was 108 between 1947 and 1949.
It dropped to 107 in 1951. In the last year of
I ruman's administration it was still over 100.
It dropped tit 92 in 195.i and HI in 1955.
l.ast March it hit a low of HI. W hat better
indictment of the Eisenhower farm /tolicy can
there be than this factual account <tf the He
publicans' failure to keep the farm purchasing
pou er on a par with the rest of the nation?

Mockery and deceit. These are two words
President Eisenhower used recently in describ
ing the farm program advocated by Democrats
this election year.
Actually the program is 110 different from
the one offered by Democrats ever since the
end of World War 11. It's a program which,
in practice, built up billions of dollars' worth
of waste surplus farm products ami resulted in
a fast-declining market parity ratio lit tumbled
19 points in the last two years of the Truman
Administration).
This program of rigid price supports is still
sitpported by every Democratic leader, includ
ing most certainly those who have recorded
their votes in Congress for it—Estes Kefauver,
Sam Rayburn & Co.
What makes the support of rigid parity one
of mockery and deceit? Undeniably—in prac
tice and theory—this program encourages sur
pluses that depress market prices. It is the
result of an attempt to "raise" farm income by
guaranteeing a fixed income level, which is
financed by U.S. taxpayers. (Higher taxes mean
a spiraling cost of living. In the end the farm
er's income is no higher in fact, and he is far
worse off with more surpluses and lower market
prices.)
Every major Democrat advocates a return
to this program, which marked the farm chaos
of the. Truman Administration. Unfortunately,
the only item that sticks in the mind of the
average farmer is an income figure guaranteed
by Uncle Sam at 90 per cent of parity. Their
votes are being "bought" this year by the
mockery and deceit of campaigning Democrats.
Eisenhower was faced with a monumental
task when he took office in 1953. The farm
problem was in bad shape and it was getting
much worse every day.
Flexible price supports, vast reduction of
surpluses and a sweeping nine-point farm pro
gram were the material contributions of the
Eisenhower Administration iu three and one
half years.
Democrats in Congress fought against most
of these measures every step of the uiay. The
farm bill ivas at one time "bastardized" by
C.ongress and subsequently vetoed. Finally, the
Democrats reluctantly allowed the I'resident's
soil bank and attached programs to pass.
What has been the result of the Eisenhower
program? Although working against handi
caps, the partially - implemented flexible sup
port program has started farm prices 011 the
road to recovery after a steady decline since
1951. The year 1956 has seen major product
prices rise I I per cent.
The surplus disposal program has met with
measurable success. Under the Republicans,
almost $7 billion in price-depressing surplus
larm products have been moved into use.
Already a half-million farmers have earned
$225 milium in soil bank payments. This pro
gram will soon see its fruition in the reduction
of surplus crops. One part of the President's
farm program is now refunding $00 million
annually in taxes on gasoline used in machinery
on farms.
Most important, prices have not been rigidly
fixed at levels which encourage a continuation
of high surpluses and low market prices.
The voters must decide which they prefer:
an Eisenhower farm program based 011 long
range principle or a program based on unreal
istic promises of politicians hoping to "buy"
the farm vote tit get back into power.
