A Request from Sterling A
Editor, The Daily:
To the women of Encina from the men of
Sterling A (Village):
Because we believe that we are both in some
what unique positions, we feel that we should
communicate with you on certain matters of con
siderable importance.
First, because of our chintz curtains, pastel
walls and undersized bathtubs, etc., we have had
rfo alternative but to feel that there has been
an oversight on the part of the University re
garding our respective residences. In fact, one
might say there has been a definite misunder
standing.
Another point of consideration is our almost
total lack of social co-educational activities that
were sd highly touted in the catalogue..
We don't feel in the least bit well-rounded
(whatever this may mean) as we have been told
so many times is the ultimate goal of all Stan
ford students.
In fact, we feel somewhat out of place resid
ing as we do here on the exterior fringes of the
Stanford campus. Why do they call us "Village
rats"?
However we do have our social activities. For
the next week we have planned an early morning
bird-watching get together, a bathtub regatta (we

have no goldfish however), a replay of last Fri
day night's Chinese checkers playoff (we had to
call the match when our best player lost his mar
bles) and for the forthcoming Saturday night we
are going to have an all-Sterling community
wash. If it shouldn't be good, we are going to
hang our social director.
We have our troubles with females though.
To be matter-of-fact about it, the only females
within reasonable proximity are ladybugs and
they have already been spoken for by one of
the adjacent halls.
We are quite sure that your social activities
must be much superior to ours because of your
excellent facilities (as well as other obvious rea
sons the like oi which we will not attempt to
elaborate on here), so we have a request which
we would like you to take under consideration.
We would like for you to bequeath Encina
to us.
We are sure that you have had many requests
similar to this one, but we believe that after
proper consideration, you will make Sterling A
your favorite charity.
We are looking forward to an early reply
and/or suggestions. Although we are 2.7 miles
from your wonderfully equipped edifice, we have
a car and will travel.

We don't feel in the least bit well-rounded
(whatever this may mean) as we have been told
so many times is the ultimate goal of all Stan
ford students.
In fact, we feel somewhat out of place resid
ing as we do here on the exterior fringes of the
Stanford campus. Why do they call us "Village
rats"?
However we do have our social activities. For
the next week we have planned an early morning
bird-watching get together, a bathtub regatta (we

have no goldfish however), a replay of last Fri
day night's Chinese checkers playoff (we had to
call the match when our best player lost his mar
bles) and for the forthcoming Saturday night we
are going to have an all-Sterling community
wash. If it shouldn't be good, we are going to
hang our social director.
We have our troubles with females though.
To be matter-of-fact about it, the only females
within reasonable proximity are ladybugs and
they have already been spoken for by one of
the adjacent halls.
We are quite sure that your social activities
must be much superior to ours because of your
excellent facilities (as well as other obvious rea
sons the like oi which we will not attempt to
elaborate on here), so we have a request which
we would like you to take under consideration.
We would like for you to bequeath Encina
to us.
We are sure that you have had many requests
similar to this one, but we believe that after
proper consideration, you will make Sterling A
your favorite charity.
We are looking forward to an early reply
and/or suggestions. Although we are 2.7 miles
from your wonderfully equipped edifice, we have
a car and will travel.

A Request from Sterling A
Editor, The Daily:
To the women of Encina from the men of
Sterling A (Village):
Because we believe that we are both in some
what unique positions, we feel that we should
communicate with you on certain matters of con
siderable importance.
First, because of our chintz curtains, pastel
walls and undersized bathtubs, etc., we have had
rfo alternative but to feel that there has been
an oversight on the part of the University re
garding our respective residences. In fact, one
might say there has been a definite misunder
standing.
Another point of consideration is our almost
total lack of social co-educational activities that
were sd highly touted in the catalogue..
