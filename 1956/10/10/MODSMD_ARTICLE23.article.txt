Aiding scholars and students by
making available English transla
tions of documents in foreign lan
guages stored in the Hoover
Tower is the main purpose of the
research and publication activities
of the Hoover Institute and Li
brary, according to Witold Swora
kowski, assistant director of Hoo
ver Institute and Library.
Research work and preparations
for publication of five documen
tary volumes started much earlier
are nearing completion in the li
brary. Early in 1958 two new vol
umes in the Hoover Library Pub
lication Series, which until now
includes 24 volumes, will appear.
Two volumes will be concerned
with Soviet Russia's foreign pol
icy in the early era of government.
The first, "Soviet Russia and the
East: 1910-27," was prepared by
Mrs. Xenia Eudin and Robert
North.
The second work, "Soviet Rus
sia and the West," was prepared
by Mrs. Eudin and Harold H.
Fisher. Both volumes will contain
a narrative followed by a vast doc
umentation, Sworakowski said.
Another volume will appear
somewhat later in 1958 under the
title "Toward the Third Interna
tional, 1917-1920." It will contain
a collection of documents on the
origin and early activities of the
Communist International. This
volume is being compiled by Olga
Hess Gankin and Fisher.
Two volumes on "The Founda
tions of Soviet Foreign Policy:
1918-1920" are nearly finished,
Sworakowski said.
All these publications will bring
American scholar English
translations of Hoover Library
materials which, due to their im
portance for research, will be a
new source for those who do not
know the Russian language.
In February, 1956, a project was
begun to translate documents con
cerning the Provisional govern
ment in Russia from March to No

vember, 1917. "This period is one
of the most neglected periods on
Russian history in textbooks and
other publications which are far
from having exhausted the sub
ject," Sworakowski said.
The former Prime Minister of
the provisional government. Alex
ander F. Kerensky, now a research
associate at Hoover Library, is
participating in this program and
helps to collect and annotate the
material.
Stanford alumnus Robert P.
Browder, associate professor of
history at the University of Colo
rado, is working with Kerensky
in the preparation of this project.
A staff of translators and typists
is assisting them.
Two volumes of documents are
expected to appear as a result of
this project early in 1958, Swora
kowski said.
Besides these documentary pub
lications the Hoover Institute and
Library is producing surveys of
its holdings on particular coun
tries. It is hoped that these sur
veys will facilitate the work of
scholars and students in the

United States and abroad by in
forming them about the resources
of this library, Sworakowski said.


STUDENTS PAUSE momentarily in the doorway of the Hoover
Institute and Library. The Library's collection of translations of
foreign-language documents is available for student use. Former
Russian Premier Alexander Kerensky helps compile translations.
