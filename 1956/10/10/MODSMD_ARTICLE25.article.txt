# Aerial Fight Is Expected-San Jose Won't 'Concede'
## Spartan Coach Predicts 'Interesting' Game With Football Strategy Similar to Taylor's 
### Steve Baffrey 
According to San Jose Statf
head football coach Hob Bronzan
Saturday's Indian-Spartan tussle
at Memorial Stadium is going t<
be an "interesting" contest. Th«
Spartans will bring with them of
fensive and defensive strategy
which closely parallels the loca
train of thought.
Split ends, flanking halfback.'
and plenty of passing from th<
pplit-T formation will be thf
order of the day. The San Jos<
aerial attack has netted them 51C
yards and five TD's in 35 comple
tions out of G4 attempts so far
this year.
Thirteen lettermen returned tr
the Spartan camp this year foi
early practices. Only one of these
fullback Darrel Clement, will not
accompany the team northward
Of the remaining men, seven wil!
appear in Saturday's starting
lineup.
Series History, 12-1
The history of the Stanford-
San Jose series is an interesting
one. Through 1933 the Indians
held an 11-0 record over the Spar
tans. The '54 game saw the San
Joseans pull out a 19-14 victory.
The honor returned to the Stan
ford camp last year by virtue of
a 34-18 win over San Jose.
Two stellar quarterbacks will
be hurling passes come Saturday.

The Indians' John Brodie, whose
achievements thus far give him
8 connections in 77 attempts,
vill pitch against the Spartans'
3ob Reinhart, who is over 05 per
•cnt in his completions.
Other standouts from San Jose
vill be tackle Jim Hughes, guard
Stan Keith, and halfback Walt
Vckermann. Hughes has been la
>eled "outstanding," and is play
ng his third year on the Spartan
/arsity. Keith is claimed to be
he best guard in 11 years at San
lose, and Ackermann is a hard
. miner with two years of experi
>nce to call on.
Sun Jose Open Date
An open date appeared in the
■san Jose schedule last week, giv
ng the Spartans an extra week
!o prepare for the Indians.
Thankful for this, Coach Bronzan
has stated he will "concede noth
ing" to the Indians for Saturday.
San Jose has a 1-1 record for the
current season.
On the local scene, Coach
Chuck Taylor continued work on
his forward line problem today,
si ill seeking replacements for
open positions in his line. Pass
ing occupied a good deal of the
session, with pass defense taking
an equally large share.
T rain e r Connie Jarvis an
nounced that guards Noel Robin
son and Armand De Weese will
be at practice tonight, and are ex
pected to be ready for the Spar
tan tilt.
