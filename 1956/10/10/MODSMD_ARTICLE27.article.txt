# Stanford Soccer Outfit Ready For Opening League Action
## 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
jumps right into the thick of
things Saturday when it opens
the 1956 league season against
perennially tough San Francisco
City College. Game time is 10
a.m. in the city's Balboa stadium.
The Card hooters go into this
year's California Intercollegiate
Soccer Association race with high
hopes . . . and good prospects.
Coach Fred Priddle calls the out
look for this season "very good,
as we should have one of our best
passing teams in years."
Six lettermen return to the
fold, headed by All-American cen
ter • halfback Peter Mack. Sup
porting Mack, other Indian vet
erans are Art Harlow, Ed Avery.
Eduardo Maal, Tim Ward and
Bill Wren. The roster this year is
one of the largest in. history,
numbering almost 60.
The Gold Coast has supplied
the Cards with two prime All-
American candidates, Mike Asa
to-Boakye and Ben Pentsil. Prid
dle calls the pair "two of the
finest inside men I've seen for
some time." The Indians will also

be strong at fullback whore Art
Harlow and Otto Jochems loom
as two of the CISA's best. The
all-important goalie post has been
nailed down by Bill Ditman. In
the Sept. 29 opener against Her
mania Athletic Club of Oakland,
a 5-1 triumph for the Cards, Dit
man made 33 saves.
But the soccer team is not free
from injury, as is the case of an
other Stanford eleven. Asato-Boa
kye was hobbled by a knee injury
this week while center-forward
Jack Winkler of England has
been out of action with a
sprained ankle.
Len Weinstein will be assisting
Priddle in Ihe coaching duties.
Handling the jayvees are Bill
White and Randy Rosso, Stan
ford star of several seasons ago.
The jayvees dropped their opener
with Balboa High School, 3-1,
Sept. 29. Last Saturday both
teams won by forfeit from Har
lequin AC.
With an eye to the future. Prid
die points to the fine crop of
freshmen turning out this season
and the fact that he will lose
only Wren and Mack off the
| starting eleven.

die points to the fine crop of
freshmen turning out this season
and the fact that he will lose
only Wren and Mack off the
| starting eleven.
Stanford's varsity soccer team
jumps right into the thick of
things Saturday when it opens
the 1956 league season against
perennially tough San Francisco
City College. Game time is 10
a.m. in the city's Balboa stadium.
The Card hooters go into this
year's California Intercollegiate
Soccer Association race with high
hopes . . . and good prospects.
Coach Fred Priddle calls the out
look for this season "very good,
as we should have one of our best
passing teams in years."
Six lettermen return to the
fold, headed by All-American cen
ter • halfback Peter Mack. Sup
porting Mack, other Indian vet
erans are Art Harlow, Ed Avery.
Eduardo Maal, Tim Ward and
Bill Wren. The roster this year is
one of the largest in. history,
numbering almost 60.
The Gold Coast has supplied
the Cards with two prime All-
American candidates, Mike Asa
to-Boakye and Ben Pentsil. Prid
dle calls the pair "two of the
finest inside men I've seen for
some time." The Indians will also

be strong at fullback whore Art
Harlow and Otto Jochems loom
as two of the CISA's best. The
all-important goalie post has been
nailed down by Bill Ditman. In
the Sept. 29 opener against Her
mania Athletic Club of Oakland,
a 5-1 triumph for the Cards, Dit
man made 33 saves.
But the soccer team is not free
from injury, as is the case of an
other Stanford eleven. Asato-Boa
kye was hobbled by a knee injury
this week while center-forward
Jack Winkler of England has
been out of action with a
sprained ankle.
Len Weinstein will be assisting
Priddle in Ihe coaching duties.
Handling the jayvees are Bill
White and Randy Rosso, Stan
ford star of several seasons ago.
The jayvees dropped their opener
with Balboa High School, 3-1,
Sept. 29. Last Saturday both
teams won by forfeit from Har
lequin AC.
