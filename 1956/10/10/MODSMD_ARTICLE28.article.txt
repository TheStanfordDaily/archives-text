# ALL TIED UP
## Series Hinds Up Today 
### 
BROOKLYN, Oct. 9 (UP)—Ag
ing Jackie Robinson slashed a
clutch single which broke a 10th
inning scoreless tie and defeated
the New York Yankees, 1-0, today
to square the Word Series for the
Brooklyn Dodgers at three games
each.
Robinson, nearing the end of
the baseball trail, bail left five
base runners stranded previously
against the 95-mile-an-hour fast
ball oX Bullet Bob Turley. But
finally, with two out in the 10th
inning and two men on via walks,
the man who broke baseball's
color line banged out the hit
which carried Clem Labine to vic
tory in the first World Series
shutout at Ebbets Field in 30
years.
In todays finale New York's
Johnny Kucks faces Brooklyn's
Don Newcombe in the race of the
champions at Ebbets Field.
It was a heart-breaking blow to
Turley, for the big man had
struck out 11 Dodgers as 33,224
hung breathlessly on Brooklyn's
back-to-the-wall battle to remain
alive in the annual classic. Until

■ the 10th. Turley had allowed only
three hits.
It was a tense pitching duel
under chill blue skies as the
burly Turley and the slender La
bine battled seorelessly through
nine well-pitched innings.
Labine set the Yankees down
in order in the top of the 10th
and then Turley went to the hill
again. The big fellow retired La
bine but then paved the way for
his own defeat as he issued a
walk to Junior Gilliam. Pee Wee
Reese sacrificed Gilliam to sec
ond. Then Snider stepped up to
the plate and Turley was ordered
to give him an intentional pass.

. With the count at one strike
and one ball, Robinson added an
i other storied line to his baseball
j saga with a chips-down drive that
: the leaping Country Slaughter
missed as Gilliam raced home
| with the winning run.
The Yankees, shooting to wrap
i up their seventh world champion
ship in 10 years, gave Labine a
bitter run for it. Eight times
i they hud men on base and every
| time the calm right hander from
Rhode Isand, who is used to hav
ing baserunners at his back as
a bullpen specialist, left them
stranded.
