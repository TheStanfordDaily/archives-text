recommending that neither the
ASSU nor any Stanford student
organization shall schedule or
sanction any function to be held
in a public place where consump
tion of alcoholic beverages by mi
nors is to be in fact encouraged,
and be it further resolved that
copies of this resolution be sent to
the President of the University,
Dean of Students and the Social
Co-ordinating Board."
Other business which will de
mand Legislature attention in
cludes:
• Whether the school should
become a member of the Pacific
Coast Conference Student Body
Presidents' Council.
• An amendment to election
bylaws that would make it impos
sible for freshmen to vote in the
autumn quarter ASSU elections.
• The Humanities and Sciences
representative appointment prob

appointments.

President Bob Freelen stated
yesterday that he considered the
Pacific Coast Conference Student
Body Presidents' Council mem
bership most important.
The new organization was con
ceived at a Pacific Coast Confer
ence meeting held last spring in
Vancouver, 8.C., which Frcelen
attended. He said there is no
doubt one of the association's
most important functions will be
to cope with the athletic situation
in the Pacific Coast Conference
on the student level.
