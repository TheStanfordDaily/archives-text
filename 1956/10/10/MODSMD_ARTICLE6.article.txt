# Security Council Studies Suez Situation in Secret Session
## UN 						Group Adjourns to Permit British, French, Egyptian Foreign Ministers to Hold Meetings 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct. 9 (LlP)—The United Nations Se
curity Council went into secret session today on the Suez Canal crisis
and adjourned for two flays to permit top-level talks among the Brit
ish, French and Egyptian foreign ministers.
The secret session followed a suggestion to the Council this morn-

ing by Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles that the canal he
"insulated" so that it cannot be
used as an "instrument of ,na
t tional policy" f>y any country.
The suggestion met a cool recep
tion from Russia and Egypt.
The 11 Council members met
privately for f)0 minutes this af
ternoon. Most of the time was
consumed by Egyptian Foreign
Minister Mahmoud Fawzi, who
reaffirmed his government's will
ingness to co-operate, but only on
the question of safeguards for
freedom of navigation through
the canal.
Conference
Immediately afler th" after
noon meeting, British Foreign
Secretary Selwyn Lloyd, French
Foreign Minister Pineau and
Fawzi met privately with Secre
tary-General Dag Hammarskjold
for their first conference on the
crisis since the Suez debate began
here last week.
It was Lloyd who proposed
that the Council adjourn until
3:30 p.m., EDT, Thursday after
noon paving the way for ultra
private talks.
Informed sources said Egypt
refused to give ground in this af
ternoon's closed meeting. The at
mosphere of the session, how
ever, reflected a desire to get the
Council out of the picture tem
porarily and to let the foreign
ministers try to find a common
i ground for negotiation among
| themselves.
Quiet, Diplomacy
It was significant that the
"quint diplomacy" was being con
ducted only among the three min
isters most directly concerned in
the Suez question. Dulles and So
viet Foreign Minister Dmitri She
pi lov were not asked to take a
| hand.
Dulles made an earnest appeal
to Egypt to accept the principle
of "insulation" of the canal.
Without this, Dulles said, there
is little likelihood of any settle
ment of the Suez crisis and if the
Council fails to find a solution, it
will lie "a calamity of immense
proportions."
