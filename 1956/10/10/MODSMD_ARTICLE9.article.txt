## 
### 
"We must maintain some edge
over the Russians. That's why
we keep on building and build
ing," said Thomas G. Lanphier,
explaining the need of continued
expansion in plane and missile
weapon systems.
Lanphier, a famed flyer of
World War II and vice-president
of Convair Airlines, set a grim
tone for his discussion of national
policy in the supersoinc age be
fore the Tuesday Evening Lec
ture Series audience last night.
He placed emphasis on his be
lief that Russia presents a defi
nite threat to the United States'
goal of world peace and said the
responsibility lies with the citi
zens. Their attention should be
brought to the importance of the
weapon system, to which two
thirds of their tax money goes.
"There is on way you can de
fend against an attack once it is
launched in the air," Lanphier
said. He showed films of an in
tercontinental ballistic missile
that will, after further develop
ment, be able to reach a target
halfway around the world in one
halt hour.
Lanphier served on the Secu
rity Council before and during
the Korean War. He said that
President Truman and the people
around him were "frightened peo
ple without a plan or policy."
"The number of young people
in engineering and science today
is ominous," Lanphier said. "Peo
ple don't understand the threat.
Only 10 per cent of the engineers
are in defense work." Our job,
he said, i« to be as physically
strong as Russia and to ho smart
enough to know what we want
to do with our. strength.
Lanphier concluded with the
warning that if we don't get
enough young people into air de
fense work, we won't be ahead of
Russia 20 years from now.
