A strong case for the Republi
can party as the party of the
young voter was presented by
Vice-President Richard Nixon yes
terday to 7000 people packed into
the inner court of San Jose State
College.
Nixon cited President Eisen
hower as a living symbol of pros
perity at homo and peace and
freedom abroad.
He upheld the Administration's
record of prosperity and econom
ic security at home, "without dry
ing up the inventive genius of 168
million Americans."
"There are many who say, 'Al
ways let the federal government
do it.' but this is the quickest way
to destroy private enterprise, the
secret of our country's pros
perity."
The Vice-President stated thaf
under a free enterprise system
emphasis the Eisenhower Admin
istration has given the new voter
much for a sound future.
All-Time High
"Employment is at an all lime
high; there are now 67 million
workers; and the dollar the Amer
ican worker earns now will be
worth a dollar in five years,"
Nixon said.
"Under a sound program of a
balanced budget, the Eisenhower
Administration has given the citi
zen dollar security which did not
exist under the Democrats, where
the dollar value decreased to 60
cents from 1942 to 1952."
Nixon emphasized that the
prosperity at home will do the
American citizen little good un
less he is here to enjoy it.
"And who is better qualified to
keep the peace both in terms of
performance and a strong diplo
matic rerord than the Eisenhower
government ?"
Criticizing Adlai Stevenson's re
cent remarks about the armament
situation, he said, "America must
be kept strong, for strength is the

only language the world under
stands."
Neutral Nations
Of primary consideration, the
Vice-President thinks, is the prob
lem of the neutral nations. "With
800 million people in the Western
nations and another 800 million
under Communist tyranny, the
balance of power lies with the
600 million-populated neutral na
tions.
"Wo must, of course, encourage
their economic progress. They
desperately need and want eco
nomic and military aid.
"But they need something else,
and to illustrate this I am afraid
I have to tell another dog story
which was told me while Pat and
I were in Hong Kong."
lie went on to tell of two dogs,
one of which was well fed, pro
tected and living in a kennel, but
was chained. The other had no
owner and had to scrounge for
food.
"Happiest Dog"
"Which was the happiest?" he
asked. "The second dog, of course,
because he had something called
freedom. We must encourage in
dependence and equality for the
neutral nations.
"And in my travels T could see
that, regardless of nationality or
color of skin, they all wanted
peace. In President Eisenhower
we have a man who can mobilize
the people of the world on the side
of peace."
Nixon arrived for his Bay Area
tour at Moffett Field earlier in
the afternoon. He was welcomed
by a crowd of 200 which was led
in cheers by the five Stanford
yell leaders.
Speaking from the car, he term
ed the years since 1952 as "the
best four years of our lives. Why
change a good, known thing for
an uncertain quantity?" he asked.
Present at the airport was a
delegation of sign-waving Stan
ford Area Young Republicans.
Following his San Jose address,
Nixon spoke last night at China
town in San Francisco. He leaves
the area this morning at 9:45 for
Elko, Nevada.
