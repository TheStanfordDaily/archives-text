# LASSU Tables Alcohol Resolution--Consideration Is Expected Next Week
## Bill Passed to Fundamental Standard Commission for Study 
### Lynn Bramkamp Staff Editor 
Legislature voted last night to table a resolution recommending
that ASSU cease to sanction "any function . . . heir! in a public place
where the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors is to be,
in fact, encouraged. . .
ASSU President Bob Freelcn said he would refer the proposed

resolution to the Fundamental
Standard Commission for its rec
mendation. He appointed Steve
Tallent, Skip Renner and Sue
Thorson as official representa
tives of Legislature to sit in on
next Tuesday's meeting of Fun
damental Standard Commission.
Freelc-n also invited members
of Social Co-ordinating Board to
appear at the meeting.
The action followed an hour of
heated debate on the subject.
Freelen said, "We have one of
two stands to make." He said
Legislature could take a powerful
stand on the problem, but that
this might have the effect of driv
ing drinking "underground."
Vas;ue Stand
A vague stand would leave the
problem up to the Social Co-ordi
nating Board as to the interpre
tation of the resolution, he said.
Steve Tallent, administrative
assistant, said the Legislature
had a responsibility to follow tho
laws of the state. He said it was
morally wrong to evade the issue.
Skip Renner. men's row repre
sentative, suggested making the
sponsoring group responsible for
actions of students at their func
tions. He proposed the penalty of
losing social privileges for a
quarter if violations of the law
took place at a function. This
was denounced by most of the
members.
Suggested Changes
After many suggested changes
in the resolution were proposed,
a motion was made and passed
that th resolution be tabled until
it could be reviewed by Funda
mental Standards Commission. It
was felt that the issue came un
der the province of the Funda
mental Standard.
In other actions taken by Leg
islature at last night's meeting,
the body passed unanimously a
vote to join the Pacific Coast
Conference Student Presidents'
Council. Freelen said ttvis would
be a good idea, particularly at
this time in view of the difficul
ties now faced bv the PCC.

resolution to the Fundamental
Standard Commission for its rec
mendation. He appointed Steve
Tallent, Skip Renner and Sue
Thorson as official representa
tives of Legislature to sit in on
next Tuesday's meeting of Fun
damental Standard Commission.
Freelc-n also invited members
of Social Co-ordinating Board to
appear at the meeting.
The action followed an hour of
heated debate on the subject.
Freelen said, "We have one of
two stands to make." He said
Legislature could take a powerful
stand on the problem, but that
this might have the effect of driv
ing drinking "underground."
Vas;ue Stand
A vague stand would leave the
problem up to the Social Co-ordi
nating Board as to the interpre
tation of the resolution, he said.
Steve Tallent, administrative
assistant, said the Legislature
had a responsibility to follow tho
laws of the state. He said it was
morally wrong to evade the issue.
Skip Renner. men's row repre
sentative, suggested making the
sponsoring group responsible for
actions of students at their func
tions. He proposed the penalty of
losing social privileges for a
quarter if violations of the law
took place at a function. This
was denounced by most of the
members.
Suggested Changes
After many suggested changes
in the resolution were proposed,
a motion was made and passed
that th resolution be tabled until
it could be reviewed by Funda
mental Standards Commission. It
was felt that the issue came un
der the province of the Funda
mental Standard.
In other actions taken by Leg
islature at last night's meeting,
the body passed unanimously a
vote to join the Pacific Coast
Conference Student Presidents'
Council. Freelen said ttvis would
be a good idea, particularly at
this time in view of the difficul
ties now faced bv the PCC.
