# To Widen Palm Drive
## 
### 
The yearly question of traffic conditions 011
Palm Drive is again before us. With the in
crease in traffic in the last few years, particu
larly at rush hours, Palm Drive is getting to
be quite a problem.
The standard suggestion is to paint a white
line down the center of the road, with some
people agitating for lines laying out the road
in four lanes. This is an excellent suggestion,
except during rush hours.
If you travel on Palm Drive during peak
traffic conditions, you may have noticed that
when tlie two lanes of cars are traveling abreast,
the inner line is prone to move over into the
oncoming traffic. This works fine, as long as
there is very little oncoming traffic.

Putting a white line down the renter of the
road would force rush-hour traffic to travel very
close together. Gordon Davis, Stanford chief
of police, says this would cause drivers (who,
as a group, spend half their time with their
eyes 011 something other than the road) to side
swipe each other occasionally. In crowded traf
fic conditions this could result in serious wrecks.
Something must he done with Palm Drive.
The obvious thing is to widen the road. Davis
says three feet added to each side of the drive
would allow it to be made into a four-lane road.
There doesn't seem to he any other logical
way to solve the problem, and the administra
tion would do well to start planning to widen
Palm Drive. We are getting more traffic on it
everv vear.
