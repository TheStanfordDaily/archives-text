# The 						Eggheads Arise
## 
### 
Thf, cause of the controversial egghead is
currently being championed by both political
parties, and this we heartily applaud.
Brought into the political spotlight by
Stewart Alsop in 1952 in a reference to candi
date Adlai Stevenson, the term "egghead" be
came a natural for semantic gymnasts. During
the '52 campaign and for a lew years thereafter,
the egghead and all he stood for underwent
some pretty harsh tongue-lashing, hut it looks
like these days are over.
Stevenson has capitalized on the egghead
craze by repeating the slogan: "Eggheads of
the world, arise! You have nothing to lose but
your yolks." And, on the other side of the
fence, President Eisenhower once took a broad
side at the so-called egghead by describing him
as a "man who takes more words than neces
sary to tell us more than he knows."

Now il seems that both parties have taken
the egghead under wing and are courting his
support. The Republicans, having long casti
gated the "egghead attitude" of many Demo
erats, recently set up a Committee of Arts and
Seienees for Eisenhower, and they have adopted
much of the egghead approach.
\\ hen one takes a long, objective look at the
quantity hut lack of quality of much of the
hogwash that pervades the current political
campaign, il is easy to come to the conclusion
that more serious-toned intellectuals are badly
and immediately needed.
/ Political campaigns will always be much
smoke with considerably less fire, but the jssues
are always there, and the theoreticianâ€”the in
tellectual has by his very nature the capaci
ties to dig to the essence of the issue.
There's room lor the intellectual in both
parlies, tlie more the tatter.
