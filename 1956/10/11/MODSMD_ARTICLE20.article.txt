Encina Bequeathed to Sterling A
Editor, The Daily:
To the men of Sterling A from the women of Encina:
Definitely, there has been an oversight. We sympathize; in fact,
you have touched our tender hearts so deeply, and roused our sense
of civic pride so thoroughly, that we held a special meeting in our
gang shower (with the water off) and reviewed our list of charities.
There were many worthy contestants, but you were unanimously
voted the most pitiful, underprivileged, neglected, discriminated
against, and therefore most worthy of all.
So—the last of us will be out of Encina by 9 tonight . . . and
we hereby bequeath Encina to you. ("Bequeath"—we have adopted
your terminology with no hesitation; there's something so dead
sounding about it.)
We know you will enjoy your new home as we have. But we feel
you need some hints on how to get the most out of your lovely
home.
• This is a refined, sensitive building. Treat it with care.. Do not
mar the walls. ♦
• Keep your feet covered at all timas to protect the finish on the
floor. Besides, you might get splinters.
• You will not be bothered by chintz curtains.
• We have some bathroom facilities which we are sure you will
know how to use; we will remove the flowers.
• Do not waste your valuable minutes in Encina by studying.
The one desk for four people will have to be used for something else,
as will the lone light bulb in tlie? middle of the room.
• If there's no place to plug in your radio, you will be able to
hear the one down the hall. In fact, you will get a delightful echo
effect of everything down the hall.
This is just a beginning list. One warning: you will have to make
an important decision is it better to be a "Village Rat" or an
"Encina Bat"?
Regretfully we must mention one more thing—you may find it
necessary to reject our generous offer because Encina was long ago
condemned. But at any rate, you are still our favorite charity, and
to show that we feel you have been placed in an unfortunate position
to get the most out of Stanford, if you are short any pastel rugs or
curtains at Sterling we will be more than happy to help out.

A Case for llie SPCA
Editor, The Daily:
To the boys of Sterling A from the men of Terman A:
Tears came to our eyes as we read of your sad plight in yester
day's letter to The Daily. Yours is definitely a case for the SPCA.
If all else fails, you could go back to junior college.
Since things are so rough over there, please feel free to visit any
of the numerous one-room suites in Terman. In fact, right now we
have a vacancy in Room W-Z.
Please accept our best wishes for continued success in your "I
feel sorry for myself" campaign.

Parking in Menlo Park
Editor, The Daily:
A Menlo Park ordinance prohibits overnight parking on the
streets of that town. Probably many other Stanford students besides
me, as well as local people, are so situated that the garages and drive
ways of their residences in Menlo Park are insufficient to accommo
date their autos. This is especially common when a group of people
rent a house or apartment together, and each has a car.
Unlike other similar ordinances which give the chiefs of police
discretion to issue six months renewable permits in such cases,
Menlo Park's ordinance absolutely prohibits parking overnight on
the streets except for emergencies or visitors staying only a few
days.
Faced with this problem, there are very few solutions: If there
is any off-street parking available, it is generally at an inconvenient
distance and excessive rent. If one can find other housing without
the same problem, improbable at this late date, he could move out..
The most desirable solution, and possibly the only alternative for
many, is to get Menlo Park to change its ordinance.
In support of the ordinance it is claimed that it is necessary for
traffic safety, to enable street cleaning and, to prevent vandalism
upon parked cars.
Many other localities seem to find no such ordinance necessary,
however, and others like Palo Alto at least make provision for those
who are stuck for a place to park overnight. Why Menlo Park can't
or won't make such provision, I don't know.
The time may be ripe to get the City Council to change the ordi
nance, for it is faced with increasing population density without
sufficient off-street parking, aside from Stanford people. If all the
residents of Menlo Park who agree with this population will write
to the Menlo Park City Council, perhaps relief can be obtained.
The City Council meets Oct. 23, and even if the Traffic Safety
Committee fails to recommend changing the ordinance, presentation
of the problem before the City Council, which will by then, I hope
have received many letters about the matter, may get action in
the right direction.

is any off-street parking available, it is generally at an inconvenient
distance and excessive rent. If one can find other housing without
the same problem, improbable at this late date, he could move out..
The most desirable solution, and possibly the only alternative for
many, is to get Menlo Park to change its ordinance.
In support of the ordinance it is claimed that it is necessary for
traffic safety, to enable street cleaning and, to prevent vandalism
upon parked cars.
Many other localities seem to find no such ordinance necessary,
however, and others like Palo Alto at least make provision for those
who are stuck for a place to park overnight. Why Menlo Park can't
or won't make such provision, I don't know.
The time may be ripe to get the City Council to change the ordi
nance, for it is faced with increasing population density without
sufficient off-street parking, aside from Stanford people. If all the
residents of Menlo Park who agree with this population will write
to the Menlo Park City Council, perhaps relief can be obtained.
The City Council meets Oct. 23, and even if the Traffic Safety
Committee fails to recommend changing the ordinance, presentation
of the problem before the City Council, which will by then, I hope
have received many letters about the matter, may get action in
the right direction.

Encina Bequeathed to Sterling A
Editor, The Daily:
To the men of Sterling A from the women of Encina:
Definitely, there has been an oversight. We sympathize; in fact,
you have touched our tender hearts so deeply, and roused our sense
of civic pride so thoroughly, that we held a special meeting in our
gang shower (with the water off) and reviewed our list of charities.
There were many worthy contestants, but you were unanimously
voted the most pitiful, underprivileged, neglected, discriminated
against, and therefore most worthy of all.
So—the last of us will be out of Encina by 9 tonight . . . and
we hereby bequeath Encina to you. ("Bequeath"—we have adopted
your terminology with no hesitation; there's something so dead
sounding about it.)
We know you will enjoy your new home as we have. But we feel
you need some hints on how to get the most out of your lovely
home.
• This is a refined, sensitive building. Treat it with care.. Do not
mar the walls. ♦
• Keep your feet covered at all timas to protect the finish on the
floor. Besides, you might get splinters.
• You will not be bothered by chintz curtains.
• We have some bathroom facilities which we are sure you will
know how to use; we will remove the flowers.
• Do not waste your valuable minutes in Encina by studying.
The one desk for four people will have to be used for something else,
as will the lone light bulb in tlie? middle of the room.
• If there's no place to plug in your radio, you will be able to
hear the one down the hall. In fact, you will get a delightful echo
effect of everything down the hall.
This is just a beginning list. One warning: you will have to make
an important decision is it better to be a "Village Rat" or an
"Encina Bat"?
Regretfully we must mention one more thing—you may find it
necessary to reject our generous offer because Encina was long ago
condemned. But at any rate, you are still our favorite charity, and
to show that we feel you have been placed in an unfortunate position
to get the most out of Stanford, if you are short any pastel rugs or
curtains at Sterling we will be more than happy to help out.

A Case for llie SPCA
Editor, The Daily:
To the boys of Sterling A from the men of Terman A:
Tears came to our eyes as we read of your sad plight in yester
day's letter to The Daily. Yours is definitely a case for the SPCA.
If all else fails, you could go back to junior college.
Since things are so rough over there, please feel free to visit any
of the numerous one-room suites in Terman. In fact, right now we
have a vacancy in Room W-Z.
Please accept our best wishes for continued success in your "I
feel sorry for myself" campaign.

Parking in Menlo Park
Editor, The Daily:
A Menlo Park ordinance prohibits overnight parking on the
streets of that town. Probably many other Stanford students besides
me, as well as local people, are so situated that the garages and drive
ways of their residences in Menlo Park are insufficient to accommo
date their autos. This is especially common when a group of people
rent a house or apartment together, and each has a car.
Unlike other similar ordinances which give the chiefs of police
discretion to issue six months renewable permits in such cases,
Menlo Park's ordinance absolutely prohibits parking overnight on
the streets except for emergencies or visitors staying only a few
days.
Faced with this problem, there are very few solutions: If there
is any off-street parking available, it is generally at an inconvenient

Editor, The Daily:
To the boys of Sterling A from the men of Terman A:
Tears came to our eyes as we read of your sad plight in yester
day's letter to The Daily. Yours is definitely a case for the SPCA.
If all else fails, you could go back to junior college.
Since things are so rough over there, please feel free to visit any
of the numerous one-room suites in Terman. In fact, right now we
have a vacancy in Room W-Z.
Please accept our best wishes for continued success in your "I
feel sorry for myself" campaign.

Parking in Menlo Park
Editor, The Daily:
A Menlo Park ordinance prohibits overnight parking on the
streets of that town. Probably many other Stanford students besides
me, as well as local people, are so situated that the garages and drive
ways of their residences in Menlo Park are insufficient to accommo
date their autos. This is especially common when a group of people
rent a house or apartment together, and each has a car.
Unlike other similar ordinances which give the chiefs of police
discretion to issue six months renewable permits in such cases,
Menlo Park's ordinance absolutely prohibits parking overnight on
the streets except for emergencies or visitors staying only a few
days.
Faced with this problem, there are very few solutions: If there
is any off-street parking available, it is generally at an inconvenient
distance and excessive rent. If one can find other housing without
the same problem, improbable at this late date, he could move out..
The most desirable solution, and possibly the only alternative for
many, is to get Menlo Park to change its ordinance.
In support of the ordinance it is claimed that it is necessary for
traffic safety, to enable street cleaning and, to prevent vandalism
upon parked cars.
Many other localities seem to find no such ordinance necessary,
however, and others like Palo Alto at least make provision for those
who are stuck for a place to park overnight. Why Menlo Park can't
or won't make such provision, I don't know.
The time may be ripe to get the City Council to change the ordi
nance, for it is faced with increasing population density without
sufficient off-street parking, aside from Stanford people. If all the
residents of Menlo Park who agree with this population will write
to the Menlo Park City Council, perhaps relief can be obtained.
The City Council meets Oct. 23, and even if the Traffic Safety
Committee fails to recommend changing the ordinance, presentation
of the problem before the City Council, which will by then, I hope
have received many letters about the matter, may get action in
the right direction.

Encina Bequeathed to Sterling A
Editor, The Daily:
To the men of Sterling A from the women of Encina:
Definitely, there has been an oversight. We sympathize; in fact,
you have touched our tender hearts so deeply, and roused our sense
of civic pride so thoroughly, that we held a special meeting in our
gang shower (with the water off) and reviewed our list of charities.
There were many worthy contestants, but you were unanimously
voted the most pitiful, underprivileged, neglected, discriminated
against, and therefore most worthy of all.
So—the last of us will be out of Encina by 9 tonight . . . and
we hereby bequeath Encina to you. ("Bequeath"—we have adopted
your terminology with no hesitation; there's something so dead
sounding about it.)
We know you will enjoy your new home as we have. But we feel
you need some hints on how to get the most out of your lovely
home.
• This is a refined, sensitive building. Treat it with care.. Do not
mar the walls. ♦
• Keep your feet covered at all timas to protect the finish on the
floor. Besides, you might get splinters.
• You will not be bothered by chintz curtains.
• We have some bathroom facilities which we are sure you will
know how to use; we will remove the flowers.
• Do not waste your valuable minutes in Encina by studying.
The one desk for four people will have to be used for something else,
as will the lone light bulb in tlie? middle of the room.
• If there's no place to plug in your radio, you will be able to
hear the one down the hall. In fact, you will get a delightful echo
effect of everything down the hall.
This is just a beginning list. One warning: you will have to make
an important decision is it better to be a "Village Rat" or an
"Encina Bat"?
Regretfully we must mention one more thing—you may find it
necessary to reject our generous offer because Encina was long ago
condemned. But at any rate, you are still our favorite charity, and
to show that we feel you have been placed in an unfortunate position
to get the most out of Stanford, if you are short any pastel rugs or
curtains at Sterling we will be more than happy to help out.
