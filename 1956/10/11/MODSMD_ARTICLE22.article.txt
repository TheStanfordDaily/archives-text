AT HIS DESK in the Encina Gym training quarters sat Donald
Conrad Jarvis, Stanford's busy trainer, wearing his trademark white
coat and puffing occasionally on his pipe.
Under the glass on the desk were the words of The Trainer's
Code. "Cultivate a friendly and courteous but firm ami business
like attitude in all dealings with the players," it read.
The man who has been cultivating many hundreds of Stanford
athletes during 11 years of tape, bandages, bruises and strains looked
up to answer my question.
"I have the best training job in the entire United States in any
form of athletics," he declared firmly. "This is because of the type

01 students we nave to worn
with, the training facilities and
our staff."
"There are many challenges in
my job," he went on. "The pres
sure is particularly on during
football season."
The 39 • year • old trainer re
ferred to a list of injured football
players—a growing list that has
kept his training quarters bus
tling during recent weeks.
"There aren't any more inju
ries this year than in a number
of previous seasons, especially in
1949 and 1954. But this year has
been significant since the inju
ries have been amplified at cer
tain top-string positions.
"Before the Ohio State game
it was right guard and now it is
right end which is hit hard. Noel
Robinson will be able to get back
in at the guard position, but both
Gary Van Galder and Jerry Bea
tie are out of the end spot with
injuries.

"We may move St£ve Docter
over from tackle to fill the void, if the doctors say OK on his knee
injury."
The injury list was so bad before the Ohio State trip last week
that "it sounded like we were fools for even going back to the
game." But Connie was not surprised at the come-through per
formances of reserves in the line at Columbus.
"Of course, Paul Wiggin helps almost anyone up there to look
good." Connie rates All-American Wiggin as one of the best all
round physical specimens he has seen in over a decade of Stanford
football.
Steve Docter, Bob Mathias and John Brodie are other fine speci
mens, he added. "But Mathias was a slow starter and Brodie has
strong hands and good arms but can't run very well."
The most difficult sport for a trainer is track, Connie thinks, be
cause of the individual nature of the sport. And football is not easy
either, when you have to diagnose something right away and work
under pressure to get the injured player back in shape in the short
est possible time..
The worst event in his memory as far as injury is concerned
was the Army game in 1948, when a host of Stanford gridders
were seriously hurt in probably the roughest game the Indians
have played. (Army won, 43-0.)
There are a few players who have been real surprises to Connie.
One is halfback Gordy Young.
"One would think he couldn't possibly be good . . . he has every
thing against him, no speed, no size ... a physical mess. But as it
turns out, he runs very well."
Connie Jarvis smiled goodbye as the training room began to fill
with players who depend upon him for the right kind of treatment
of their slightest aches and pains.
Another busy afternoon was about to begin for the Cultivator
of Stanford's Brawn.

POSTSCRIPT—Connie likes to tell about the time lineman Phil
Wilson stopped play in the 1953 Illinois game, bringing the worried
Stanford trainer out on the field. Wilson had swallowed a fly, having
his mouth open at an inopportune time on the previous nlay. "He
damn near died swallowing that fly," Connie remembers. "It came
just after we had a time out. The referee was sympathetic since he
had swallowed a fly before too." And then there was the time back
in 1949, when Connie had to look twice to recognize Stanford's Ken
Peck after a play which wrenched his helmot so his eyes were peer
ing intently out the ear flap ... it might have been uncomfortable,
but it must have been downright unnerving for the opposing line
man.
