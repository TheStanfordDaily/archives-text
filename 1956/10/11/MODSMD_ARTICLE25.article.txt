# Yankees Win Series Finale; Kucks Blanks Brooklyn, 9-0
## 
### 
BROOKLYN. Oct. 10 (UP) —
Squat Yogi Berra broke Dodger
hearts with a pair of $100,000
homers and young Johnny Kucks
broke their backs with three-hit
pitching today to crush Brooklyn,
9-0, and give the New York Yan
kees their seventh world cham
pionship in 10 years.
The Yankees, turning on all
their long-famed power in this
seventh and final game of the
annual classic, made it a mauling
Mardi Gras before 33,782 Ebbets
Field fans as Berra's two - run
pair, one by Elston Howard and
a grand-slammer by burly Moose
Skowron, provided an all - time
record of 12 homers for the Se
ries.
Berra's blasts in the first and
third innings gave him 10 runs
batted in to break the immortal
Lou Gehrig's 28-year-old record
for the Series and set up big Don
Neweombe for another trip down
heartbreak highway. Neweombe,
four 1 times previously a failure
against the Yanks, was kayoed
again by Howard's blast, leading
off the fourth—and the 23-year
old Kucks took it from there with
the added comfort of Skowron's
big wallop in the seventh.
Kucks, the "sinker-ball baby"
of the Yankee pitching staff, fin
ished it up with a fantastic flair
as he handed the Dodgers the
most humiliating seventh - game
Series defeat since the St. Louis

Cardinals beat the Detroit Tigers,
11-0, in the 1934 finale.
His win meant that Yankee
pitchers gave Brooklyn only one
run and seven hits over the last
28 innings to provide Casey Sten
gel with his sixth world cham
pionship in eight years.
The Yankees jumped on New
combe right at the outset when
Hank Bauer hit big Newk's
fourth pitch into left for a single.
Billy Martin came up then and,
on a hit and run, Bauer stole sec
ond base as the usually reliable
Roy Campanula's throw bounced
short of the bag and Pee Wee
Reese had to leap high to spear it.

kees their seventh world cham
pionship in 10 years.
The Yankees, turning on all
their long-famed power in this
seventh and final game of the
annual classic, made it a mauling
Mardi Gras before 33,782 Ebbets
Field fans as Berra's two - run
pair, one by Elston Howard and
a grand-slammer by burly Moose
Skowron, provided an all - time
record of 12 homers for the Se
ries.
Berra's blasts in the first and
third innings gave him 10 runs
batted in to break the immortal
Lou Gehrig's 28-year-old record
for the Series and set up big Don
Neweombe for another trip down
heartbreak highway. Neweombe,
four 1 times previously a failure
against the Yanks, was kayoed
again by Howard's blast, leading
off the fourth—and the 23-year
old Kucks took it from there with
the added comfort of Skowron's
big wallop in the seventh.
Kucks, the "sinker-ball baby"
of the Yankee pitching staff, fin
ished it up with a fantastic flair
as he handed the Dodgers the
most humiliating seventh - game
Series defeat since the St. Louis

Cardinals beat the Detroit Tigers,
11-0, in the 1934 finale.
His win meant that Yankee
pitchers gave Brooklyn only one
run and seven hits over the last
28 innings to provide Casey Sten
gel with his sixth world cham
pionship in eight years.
The Yankees jumped on New
combe right at the outset when
Hank Bauer hit big Newk's
fourth pitch into left for a single.
Billy Martin came up then and,
on a hit and run, Bauer stole sec
ond base as the usually reliable
Roy Campanula's throw bounced
short of the bag and Pee Wee
Reese had to leap high to spear it.
