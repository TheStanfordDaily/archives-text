# End Joel Freis Injured As Line Grows Thinner
## Indian Ace Suffers Leg Injury in Practice; Taylor Sees Changes in Personnel Necessary 
### Steve Baffrey 
The already injury • thinned
Stanford line suffered another
setback yesterday as second
string left end Joel Freis came I
up with a strained leg which will
sideline him for about two weeks.
Team physicians also confirmed
that tackle Jack McKenna. who
suffered a back injury yesterday,
will be out of action for some
time.
Coach Chuck Taylor indicated
he would have to make some per
sonnel shifts in his first string to
compensate for an increasing in
jury list as the team prepared to
meet San Jose State.
Players Needed
Providing Stanford has 11
healthy football players, Satur
day's tussle with the Spartans
will find the Palo Alto air full
of footballs as the nation's sec
ond and third ranked passing
clubs renew their intracounty
rivalry. National Collegiate Ath
letic Bureau statistics show the
Spartans to be the second rank
ing team in the country with an
average of 258 yards per game.
The Indians, averaging 217 yards,
are one notch below the San Jo
seans.
Mentioned as probable starters
in the Indian line slots left open
during the week by injuries were
Troy Barbee, Roch Conklin and
Bob Peterson. Barbee is a prom
ising sophomore figured as a left
tackle candidate. Conklin, at cen
ter, is an improving member of
last year's JV team. At the right
guard position, Peterson, a con
verted back, is being counted on
for needed depth.
Passes Aplenty
Pre-game estimates are calling
for 66 passes to be thrown in the
game, with 37 completions. It is
also figured that five touchdowns
will be scored via the aerial route, i
Ranked individually, the In-'

dians* John Brodie is the top j
passer in the nation. His passes
lwive netted 535 yards and five
TDs for the locals. The San Jose
quarterback, Bob Reinhart,!
stands in the fifth position. His
record is 26 of 42 for 380 yards.
Spartan and Indian halfbacks
Art Powell and Paul Camera, re
spectively, are currently tied for >
the fourth position in national
statistics in pass receiving. Each
has grabbed 10 passes.
Five Interceptions
Pass interceptions are the only
possible blot on the Brodie rec- :
ord. Five of his throws have been j
picked off by opponents. Rein
hart has a perfect score here, as
does his substitute Marv McKean
whose eight completions in 14 at
tempts have gained 117 yards for
San Jose.
The Indians, who still have not
regained their original berth
among the nation's top ten—oc
cupying the 19th spot last week—
are heavily favored in the 14th
game of the Stanford-San Jose
series.
San Jose coach Bob Bronzan
will not concede the Indians an
inch for Saturday's tilt. He feels
the dual aerial attack will provide
an interesting game for Stanford
and San Jose fans alike.
