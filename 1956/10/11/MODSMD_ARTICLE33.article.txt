# HOOVER INSTITUTE AND LIBRARY
## Growth Spans 35 Years 
### Stan Gross 
Reading a history book while
crossing the North Sea in the
early years of World War I. Her
bert Hoover was inspired with an
idea wihch grew into the Hoover
Institute and Library on War,
Revolution and Peace.
The book was written by An
drew D. White. He told of the
difficulty he had in obtaining ma
terial about the French Revolu
tion due to the rapid disappear
ance of essential d o e u m en t s
about the event. Hoover deter
mined that this calamity should
not happen to information con
cerning the World War of 1914-
18.
He was in a unique position at
the time to do something about it.
He was chairman of the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium, and
had many opportunities to gather
the necessary materials. Ile
quickly organized centers of col
lection in various warring coun
tries in Europe and Asia to seek
out and hold the material until
after the war.
When the war ended he donated
$50,000 toward establishment of
the Hoover War Library at Stan
ford University, which was soon
housed in the Main Library build
ing. Jt occupied the area which
presently is used by the Engineer
ing Library.
Hoover sent to Europe Dr. E
D. Adams, Stanford history pro
fessor, to canvass all the centers
of collection estabished during
the war, gather the information

they had collected and send it to
Stanford. â€¢
'i'ho materials began to arrive
in 1921. 'J'he War Library used
one stack floor of the University
stacks, and through the 1920s
many of the materials had to be
stored in other parts of the Uni
versity.
The present Hoover Archives
constitute the original holdings
of the library. At first the col
lections were to include only in
formation concerning Western
oriented nations. But when sig
nificant events transpired in Rus
sia, Japan, China and other parts
of the world, it was evident that
the field of collection had to be
expanded.
To tell a complete history, the
collections would have to include
materials on events after the
war, such as the world peace
movement, the League of Na
tions.
Ii i 1938 plans were made to

move the rapidly expanding Hoo
ver War Library to a now loca
tion. Funds then available were
used to build Hoover Tower.
The building was dedicated as
the last event of the 50th anni
versary celebration here on June
20, 1941. The field of collection
had expanded so much that Hoo
ver renamed the library "Hoover
Institute and Library on War,
Revolution and Peace."
The collections were moved in
the summer to the new location,
and the institution was open for
service in the autumn quarter of
1941.
The establishment now serves
two functions. The library, under
the direction of Philip T. McLean,
librarian, collects and organizes
materials. The Institute utilizes
the materials in educational and
research programs.
