JERUSALEM (Israeli Sector), Oct. 10 (UP)â€”lsraeli infantrymen
supported by heavy artillery launched a fierce attack against Jor
danian positions tonight in retaliation for (he slaying of two Israelis
yesterday.
Jordan's crack Arab Legion countered with heavy shellfire. Blast

after blast lit up the sky over the
historic old plain of Sharon as
Israeli armored cars, jeeps and
trucks converged on the attack
sector.
There were no official reports
of casualties, but the intensity of
the battle indicated there would
bo a heavy toll. Early unofficial
Israeli reports said there were at
least 2') Jordanian casualties.
Observers said the battle ap
peared to be one of the greatest
military flareups since the United
Nations truce took effect in 1918.
Prolonged Fighting
The battle raged for more than
five hours before there was a
let-up in tho shelling. The United
Nations truce team called for a
cease fire at 1:30 a.m. Thursday.
Shortly before midnight, the
shooting began to decrease.
Maj. Gen. E. L. M. Burns, Unit
er Nations truce supervisor, ap
pealed to both sides to cease fue
shortly after reports of the con
flirt reached his Jerusalem head
quarters. A UN spokesman said
Jordan immediately referred the
attack to the truce supervisor
and UN observers rushed to the
front.
The attack was directed
against tho Arab Legion fortress
of Togart, a complex of pillboxes
and strongpoints guarding Kal
kilya. The attack was started
from Nathanya, near tho orange
grove whoro two Israeli civilians
were found yesterday shot
through the hoar! and their cars
cut off.
Dogs Track Scent
Israel claimed police dogs
tracked a scent to the Kalkilya
area following tho alleged mur
der of the two orange grove
workers. Nathanya is in a 10-
mile-wide sliver of Israel pressed
between Jordan and the Medi
terranean Sea.
Israeli troops mostly young
men in their twenties, quickly
reached the outer complex of the
fortress shortly after sunset.
Most were armed with machine
guns.
Incendiary shells lit up their
path. Vast explosions indicated
demolition work was under .way
against the Jordanian positions.
The Arab Legion mounted a
quick reply with heavy artillery
on tho Israeli sector. Blast after
blast lit up the sky as Jordanian
shell lire rained in on two Israeli
villages near the border.
