## Peterson, Conklin, Kidd to Fill Positions Left Open by Injuries 
### Steve Baffrey 
A bird's-eye view of the Stan
ford Indians - San Jose Spartans
game at Memorial Stadium to
morrow figures to be one of the
best possible vantage points.
The San Joseans will be invad
ing the local camp with their two
ace quarterbacks Rnh
and Marv McKean, and a compar
atively sound ball club. The In
dians, however, have been har
assed by injuries all week, and
were faced with the problem of
grooming men to fill the vacant
hnles.
The hapniest note in the Card
camp is the fact that thoir
captain John Brodie, the nation's
number one passer, has not been
touched by the wave of misfor
tune and will be in fine shape to
rival the aerial attacks of Rein
hart and McKean.
At present it looks as if the
game wilf he won or lost in the
air lanes. Brodie. who has com
pleter! 48 passes in 78 attempts,
will he concerned with out-pitch
ing the Reinhart and McKean
combination record is 34
out of 56. The Indians have aver
aged 217 yards per game in the
air and rank third in the nation
in this category. The Spartans,
with an average of 258 yards, are
one notch above the locals in sec
ond place.

Indian mentor Chuck Taylor not
ed, "It's just a phase we're pass
ing through. We'll comnensate
for it, however; the new kids will
come through in good fashion."
Taylor further added that the
loss of players should make com
petition "more even" tomorrow.
The order of practice for the
Taylormon during the woek has
been concentrated on strengthen
ing the air defense. Running the
new men through their assign
ments and concentration on the
running game have also been
points which Taylor has stressed.
Rigid Guard
The right guard position, espe
cially, has been a headache to the
Stanford coaching staff. Bob Pe
terson, Steve Resnick and Larry
Eschelman have been mentioned
as possible candidates for the
spot. Peterson yesterday was
named as the Saturday starter.
Also open flue to the injuries of
the week were the left tackle and
center positions. Roch Conklin, a
junior who has moved up from
last year's Braves squad, receives
the starting nod at center. John
Kidd, who saw little service last
year because of injuries, will be
the Indians' loft tackle.
