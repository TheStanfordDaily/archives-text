# Stevenson Accuses Republicans Of Consistently Favoring Rich
## Terms GOP Party a Coalition Of Money Makers, Isolationists Tells Oakland Rally, Present Record Meager, Leap Year Liberalism a Fraud Despite Claims 
### Wally Simpson 
Adlai Stevenson delivered a blistering attack against the Republi
can party last night, terming it a "coalition of money makers and
isolationists."
Speaking before a Democratic rally at Oakland, the Democratic
Presidential nominee declared, "The party of Lincoln is now a party
of Cadillacs." i

"This leap year liberalism is a
fraud. In spite of the Presiden
tial claims of clear accomplish
ment the record is meager in
deed. Never was nothing done as
systematically as nothing is done
now."
GOP Liberalism a Fraud
He went on to cite instances to
"prove that this year's Republi
can leap year liberalism is a
fraud."
"The present Republican party
is but the descendant of the same
Coalition that presided over' the
tock market crash and the de
feat of the League of Nations,"
he said emphatically.
"The qualifications of the Ei
senhower cabinet seem to be fi
nancial success rather than past
experience in ladership.
"And not only has this admin
tration done and said little. No
administration has ever enjoyed
such immunity from criticism as
this one."
GOPs Have Fought
"But the Republican adminis
tration has fought hard," he ad
mitted. "But it has fought hard
for Dixon-Yates, it has fought
hard for tax reduction for the
rich, it has fought hard against
relief for the farmer, but most of
all it has fought hard for every
issue concerning money."
Stevenson charged the Republi
cans of changing labels on bills.
"For instance instead of calling
it tax reduction for the rich they
have called it increasing business
incentive. Instead of calling it
less income for the farmers they
have called it flexible support.
When they do nothing they call
it 'dynamic conservatism.' "
He went on to say that other
Republican failures were innu
merable. "The Republicans have
failed to protect our resources
from private greed, they have
failed to stop the price of living
from climbing to the present all
time high, they have failed to pro
tect government employees from
indiscriminate false security
charges, and they have failed to
provide leadership in the crisis
over civil rights."
Blasts Campaigning
Stevenson blasted the cam
paign methods of Eisenhower and
Nixon. "Millions of Americans
are concerned with issues and
want straight talk and common
sense. The Republicans have
come up with one idea, the idea
that the United States can get
along with a part-time President
but the Republican campaign
cannot get along with a part-time
campaigner."
He warned that Nixon will in
herit the leadership of the Repub
lican party after the election,
"win or lose," and "his Secretary
of State will be the senior Sena
tor from California."
He said this was one reason
why voters across the nation arc
switching away from the Repub
licans and over to the Democratic
party.
Another reason for the voter
switching this voar. he said, was
the recent disclosure that three
years ago Eisenhower "got so dis
gusted with his party that he
talker! about forming a third
party."
"But," he concluded, "Eisen
hower was now enthusiastically
in favor of all his fellow Republi
cans who follow him "at coat tail
distance as candidates, but refuse
to follow him at all as President."
