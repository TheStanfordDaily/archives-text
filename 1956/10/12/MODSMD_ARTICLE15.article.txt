# Eating Clubs Plan Parkins, Sport Areas
## Parking Lot Program Has to Be Approved With Planning Office 
### 
The Interclub Council is plan
ning a recreation area and a park
ing lot for the added convenience
of the men in eating clubs, ac
cording to ICC President Pete
Mansfield of El Toro.
The facilities they plan for the
recreation area include a barbe
cue pit, volleyball and basketball
courts, horseshoe pits and a shuf
fleboard layout. A dancing area
may be built to adjoin the barbe
cue and a hedge grown around
the area.
Earlier in the year the clubs
asked the University to level off
the area behind the eating clubs
to make the recreation area space
available. The University leveled
it off during the summer.
Drawings were made by the
ICC from ideas given them by the
men in the eating clubs. Today
these will be sent to the Univer
sity Planning Office for official
drawings.
Last spring the eating clubs
suggested to the University a
place for a parking lot. This sum
mer the University had the Plan
ning Office draw up plans for a
parking lot in that area.
The lot, however, is a separate
entity from the recreation area.
The clubs have approved the Uni
versity's plans for the lot, but
have not committed themselves
as to whether or not they will
build it.
The parking lot is estimated to
cost $2500, and a road extension
to it from Serra Street would cost
another $2500. In the past, the
clubs paid 35 per cent of the cost
of the parking area they now have
between the clubs and Encina
Hall, but they have never paid for
an entrance road.
It is possible that the recreation
area may be built without adding
the proposed increase in parking
area. The clubs know what facili
ties they want, but no one knows
the extent or the number of facili
ties they can have until the cost
estimates from the Business Of
fice have been completed.
