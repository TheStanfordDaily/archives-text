# Action Needed on liquor Problem
## 
### 
li' Legislature proved nothing else in iis meet
ing Wednesday night, it proved that student
altitudes toward what ASSU should do about
the drinking problt in on this campus are iu
complete chaos.
Opinions ran from one extreme lo the other
- ranging from banning outright all ASSU
activities held on premises where minors may
buy or consume liquor to leaving the question
up lo "group responsibility" under the law and
Fundamental Standard.
Ideally, the latter would be 11 it* answer, but,
iu fact, we have seen that this approach has
failed in the past.
I he former approach as worded in the final
Cabinet recommendation runs into dangerous
pitfalls.
As worded, il leaves up to Social Coordinat
ing Board (the body that approves or disap
proves all A SSI I social activities) the ultimate
power to interpret the recommendation as il
chooses.
II only "recommends" lhat neither ASSU nor
any other student organization "schedule or
sanction any function to be held in a public
place where the .consumption of alcoholic bev
erages bv minors is to be in fact encouraged . . ."
As worded, it also leaves manv questions
unanswered. All-campus reunions where llie
consumption of liquor is the primary attrac
tion would become a thing of the past, but what
about exchanges, pledge parties and other
group activities held at liquor-serving estab
lishments?
I his point must be clarified by Legislature
before Social Coordinating Board is lo under
stand the policy under which it is acting.
As ASSU President Bob Freelen said, it's an
all-or-nothing proposition. Fither ASSU gives
a \ague sanction to all activities with the hope
and prayer that the group involved will live
up to the law, or it develops a workable scheme
lo prevent wholesale violation of the law by a
group whose activity it has authorized.
We agree that Stanford students, under llie

Fundamental Standard, should remain respon
sible for their own actions — within certain
limits of the law.
The point is that Stanford, both officially and
in name, must disassociate itself from activities
which virtually "encourage" underage con
sumption of liquor.
There is a possible answer to this problem.
Legislature could, and iu our opinion should,
pass a bylaw to the Social Coordinating Board
constitution, or, if this fails, at least pass a more
strictly worded "recommendation," to the effect
that ASSII refuse to sanction any activity to
be held on premises where alcoholic beverages
will be sold to minors.
In addition, it should place the ultimate
responsibility upon the group sponsoring the
function to secure in advance (for Social Co
ordinating Board) a guarantee from the man
agement of the place where the activity will
be held that no alcoholic beverages will be
sold lo minors.
The offic< ■rs in charge would be held respon
sible lor the group's actions from this point on.
ASSLJ would thus, in fact, be divorcing itself
from any official sanction of law violation, but,
at the same time, would be leaving up lo "group
responsibility the actual execution of the re
sponsibility.
If violations of this occur, stiff penalties
should be enforced such as that suggested at
Wednesday's meeting—suspension of a group's
social privileges for a prescribed length of time.
I he whole matter was referred Wednesday
night to Fundamental Standard Commission
for further study, and further study it needs.
By next Wednesday night we hope a more
thoroughgoing and acceptable resolution is
drawn up and that Legislature is prepared
to act.
\\ hether by bylaw or recommendation, im
mediate action must be taken to prevent fur
ther ASSU sanction of lawbreaking. If the law
is bad, as we think it is, then let Legislature
put consideration of this on its agenda also.
