# Early Classes Make Morning Hashing Hard
## Have Enough Hashers But Schedules Wrong, Says Dining Director 
### 
The problem of hashers is not
one of too few hashers, but of
getting hashers with the right
schedules, according to Dining
Hall Director Christine Kicker.
The main difficulty is in find
ing student hashers who are free
at both 8 and 9 a.m. Lunch and
dinner hashers zfre relatively
plentiful and no shortage exists
in that category.
At present, Miss Ricker said,
there are enough hashers work
ing to fill the needs of 'lie vari
ous dining halls under her juris
diction. But because of the
changes of schedules, resigna
tions or other complications new
hashers may be needed in the
weeks to come.
Schedules Not Complete
Miss Ricker said that many
prospective hashers have filed
applications but have not listed
their complete or correct class
schedules. This, she ( said, is im
portant because hashing jobs
must not interfere with classes.
At the present time there are a
total of 425 full- and part-time
hashers. Among these are 84 jobs
which have been given to holders
of athletic grants and 12 which
have been given 1o scholarship
holders.
Work for Board
Hashers work for their board.
Full board hashing jobs, accord
ing to Miss Ricker, entail 12y a to
13 Mi hours weekly, depending
upon the schedules I Ik 1 hashers
work.
Students interested in applying
for hashing jobs may do so by
applyiiig at the Dining Hall Di
rector's office at the Union din
ing hall for applications. A visit
to the Men's or Women's Dean is
necessary to obtain a statement
of financial need. This statement,
together with the l'illed-out appli
cation and a class schedule, is to
be turned in to the director's of
fice, and the student, if the appli
cation is approved, will be placed
on the waiting list.
