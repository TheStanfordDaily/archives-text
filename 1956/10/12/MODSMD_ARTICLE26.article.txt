Tt was a dullish evening at the Theta house. Mary
Ellen Krumbald was sticking pins in an etligy of the house
mother; Evelyn Zinsmaster was welding a manhole cover
to her charm bracelet; Algelica McKeesport was writing
a letter to Elvis Presley in blood. Like I say, it was a
dullish evening.
Suddenly Dolores Vladnay stood up and stamped her
foot. "Chaps,'' she said to her sorors, "this is too yawn
making! Let's do something gay and mad and wild and
different and gasp-making. Anybody got an idea?"
"No," said the sorors, shaking their little sausage
curls.
"Think, chaps, think!" said Dolores and passed Philip
Morris Cigarettes to everybody, and if there ever was a
think-making smoke, it is today's fresh and zestful and
yummy Philip Morris. Things come clear when you puff
a good, clean, natural Philip Morris — knots untie, dilem
mas dissolve, problems evaporate, cobwebs vanish, fog
disperses, and the benevolent sun pours radiance on a new
anil dewy world. Oh, happy world! Oh, Philip Morris!
Oh, regular! Oh, long-size! Oh, get some already!

Now Geraldine Quidnunc, her drooping brain-cells
revivified by a good Philip Morris, leapt up and
cried, "Oh, I have a perfect gasser of an idea! Let's
hypnotize somebody!"
"Oh, capital!" cried the sorors. "Oh, tingle-making!"
"Yes," said Dolores Vladnay, "it is a splendid idea,
but hypnosis requires a pliant and malleable mind, and
we are all so strong and well-adjusted."
% At this point, in walked a young pledge named Alice
Bluegown. "Excuse me, mistresses," said she, "I have
finished making your beds, doing your homework, and
ironing your pleats. Will there be anything else?"
"Yes," snapped Dolores Vladnay. "When I count to
three, you will be hypnotized."
"Yes, excellency," said Alice, bobbing a curtsey.
"One, two, three," said Dolores.
Alice promptly went into a trance.
"Go back," said Dolores. "Go back to your fifth birth
day, back to your birth, to before your birth, to your last
incarnation.... Now, who arc you?"
"My name is Bridey Sigafoos," said Alice. "The year
is and I am in County Cork."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"How old are you?" asked Dolores.
"I am seven,'.' said Alice.
"Where is your mother?" asked Dolores.
"She got sold at the fair last year."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"Tell us about yourself," said Dolores.
"I am five feet tall," said Alice. "I have brown eyes,
and weigh 3200 pounds."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"Isn't that rather heavy for a girl?" said Dolores.
"Who's a girl?" said Alice. "I'm a black and white
guernsey."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"Moo!" said Bridey Sigafoos.

"Think, chaps, think!" said Dolores and passed Philip
Morris Cigarettes to everybody, and if there ever was a
think-making smoke, it is today's fresh and zestful and
yummy Philip Morris. Things come clear when you puff
a good, clean, natural Philip Morris — knots untie, dilem
mas dissolve, problems evaporate, cobwebs vanish, fog
disperses, and the benevolent sun pours radiance on a new
anil dewy world. Oh, happy world! Oh, Philip Morris!
Oh, regular! Oh, long-size! Oh, get some already!

Now Geraldine Quidnunc, her drooping brain-cells
revivified by a good Philip Morris, leapt up and
cried, "Oh, I have a perfect gasser of an idea! Let's
hypnotize somebody!"
"Oh, capital!" cried the sorors. "Oh, tingle-making!"
"Yes," said Dolores Vladnay, "it is a splendid idea,
but hypnosis requires a pliant and malleable mind, and
we are all so strong and well-adjusted."
% At this point, in walked a young pledge named Alice
Bluegown. "Excuse me, mistresses," said she, "I have
finished making your beds, doing your homework, and
ironing your pleats. Will there be anything else?"
"Yes," snapped Dolores Vladnay. "When I count to
three, you will be hypnotized."
"Yes, excellency," said Alice, bobbing a curtsey.
"One, two, three," said Dolores.
Alice promptly went into a trance.
"Go back," said Dolores. "Go back to your fifth birth
day, back to your birth, to before your birth, to your last
incarnation.... Now, who arc you?"
"My name is Bridey Sigafoos," said Alice. "The year
is and I am in County Cork."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"How old are you?" asked Dolores.
"I am seven,'.' said Alice.
"Where is your mother?" asked Dolores.
"She got sold at the fair last year."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"Tell us about yourself," said Dolores.
"I am five feet tall," said Alice. "I have brown eyes,
and weigh 3200 pounds."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"Isn't that rather heavy for a girl?" said Dolores.
"Who's a girl?" said Alice. "I'm a black and white
guernsey."
"Coo!" said the sorors.
"Moo!" said Bridey Sigafoos.

a letter to Elvis Presley in blood. Like I say, it was a
