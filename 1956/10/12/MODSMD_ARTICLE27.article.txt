# ASSU Foreign Scholars Come From 8 Lands
## Living Groups Provide Students With Board, Extra Spending Money 
### 
This week The Daily begins a I
series of interviews with ASSU j
Foreign Scholars, 12 of whom are
studying at Stanford under this
program.
Countries represented this year
include Austria, the Netherlands,
England, Switzerland, Egypt,
Germany, Japan, Pakistan and,
for the first time, Yugoslavia.
Foreign scholars are provided
with room, board and complete
tuition for nine months. They
also receive travel expenses with
in the United States, book and va
cation allowances, and incidental
expenses of $35 a month.
Requirements for foreign
scholar applicants are that they
have experience as a leader in
student affairs, that their field of
study be in the social sciences,
that they are 18 to 25, unmarried,
have a proficiency in English
and have never been to the Unit
ed States before.
The program is run by the AS
SU Foreign Scholars' Committee,
headed by Walt Hays? which ori
ents the students and arranges
speaking engagements, as well as
publicizing the program and se
lecting the scholars.
The program was started in
1948, largely by returning war
veterans, who felt that interna
tional understanding was impor
tant.
Since then it has brought over
50 foreign students to the cam
pus, 8 to 10 a year, with a cash
equivalent of over $100,000.
The purpose of the program is j
primarily Ihe stimulation of the
Stanford student body, rather
than an academic opportunity for
the scholars. P'or this reason, the ;
foreign scholars have many de- j
mands on their time from living
groups and student organizations.
To bring the A.b'SU scholars
into closer contact with the stu
dents, they live in a different liv
ing group each of their three
quarters.
These living groups pay their
room and board expenses and
spending money. Half of the
scholars' tuition is contributed by 1
the University. The other half
and all other from
the ASSU fund.
After the students are oriented,
speaking engagements are made
for them with campus groups
wishing it.

tuition for nine months. They
also receive travel expenses with
in the United States, book and va
cation allowances, and incidental
expenses of $35 a month.
Requirements for foreign
scholar applicants are that they
have experience as a leader in
student affairs, that their field of
study be in the social sciences,
that they are 18 to 25, unmarried,
have a proficiency in English
and have never been to the Unit
ed States before.
The program is run by the AS
SU Foreign Scholars' Committee,
headed by Walt Hays? which ori
ents the students and arranges
speaking engagements, as well as
publicizing the program and se
lecting the scholars.
The program was started in
1948, largely by returning war
veterans, who felt that interna
tional understanding was impor
tant.
Since then it has brought over
50 foreign students to the cam
pus, 8 to 10 a year, with a cash
equivalent of over $100,000.
The purpose of the program is j
primarily Ihe stimulation of the
Stanford student body, rather
than an academic opportunity for
the scholars. P'or this reason, the ;
foreign scholars have many de- j
mands on their time from living
groups and student organizations.
To bring the A.b'SU scholars
into closer contact with the stu
dents, they live in a different liv
ing group each of their three
quarters.
These living groups pay their
room and board expenses and
spending money. Half of the
scholars' tuition is contributed by 1
the University. The other half
and all other from
the ASSU fund.
After the students are oriented,
speaking engagements are made
for them with campus groups
wishing it.
