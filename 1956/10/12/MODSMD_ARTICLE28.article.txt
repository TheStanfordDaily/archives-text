# 'WAR WOULD RETARD PROGRESS'
## Egyptian Foreign Scholar Dina Stavrou Says Nasser Justified in Seizing Canal 
### 
Nasser was legally justified in
seizing the Suez Canal when he
did, according to Dina Stavrou,
ASSU foreign scholar from
Egypt.
The international company in
charge of the canal had been
formed under Egyptian law, ac
cording to which the government
may nationalize a corporation at
any time.
Miss Stavrou thinks that per
haps he should have waited the
12 years to comply strictly with
international law.
Miss Stavrou left Egypt in.Au
gust, where she had gotten her
B.A. at the American University
at Cairo.
She says that the Egyptian peo
ple and those of the other Arab
nations who look to Nasser as
their leader were completely be
hind his actions.
"Nasser, although his methods
are not too democratic, has done
a lot for Egypt," she said. "He
has acted to bring economic prog
ress to the country."
Miss Stavrou believes that the
U.S. refusal to lend money for
the Aswan Dam was not Nasser's
prime motive in taking over the
canal. He needed money from the
Suez for other projects and was
thinking of ways to improve
Egypt.
She thinks that the Egyptians

would consider the Canal Users'
Association a breach of national
sovereignty, hut would he willing
for a United Nations body to guar
antee freedom of passage.
On the question of Israel, Miss
Stavrou said it is hard to tell who
is responsible for the Gaza strip
incidents. She doesn't think that
Egypt really wants war with Is
rael because it would retard her
economic progress.

She says Egypt is also afraid
that the Western nations would
enter on the Jewish side. How
ever, there are many Arab refu
gees in Egypt now who are a
strong voice in favor of continu
ing hostilities.
Miss Stavrou thinks that many
Arabs and Egyptians would like
to see those countries built up as
part of the neutral bloc personi
fied by Nehru and Tito.
Egyptians feel that their con
tacts with the West in the past
10 years have not been too suc
cessful. They dislike colonialism
and definitely connect it with the
European nations.
The Arab nations feel they have
some power, and, although they
have no leanings toward Commu
nism, they have no desire to bind
themselves permanently to the
West.
