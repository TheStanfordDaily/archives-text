# Italy at Most Important Point In Last 50 Years, Says Hughes
## Socialist Wings Trying to Unite to Overthrow Long Dominance of Christian Democratic Party 
### 
Italy is at its most important turning point in the past 50 years.
This is the opinion advanced yesterday afternoon by History Pro
fessor H. Stuart Ilughes, v/ho spoke in Bowman Alumni House at
an Institute of International Relations Cultural Talk
The outcome of present pivotal events in Italy may be to trans-

form the nation from a "paper
democracy" to a "real democra
cy," Hughes said.
At ihe present time, he de
clared, "the ilominarice of Italy by
the Christian Democratic party
without rival and democratic al
ternative is bad for Italy."
Socialist Party
The Socialist party in the Latin
nation is split into two wings.
The left wing controls 13 per cent
of the electorate, with the right
wing gobbling up only 7 per cent.
Thus, explained the history de
partment chairman, "Italian so
cialism is unable to he as impor
tant as French, German or Eng
lish socialism."
With the Socialists split, the
only rival to Christian Democracy
is the Communist party, dominat
ing 22 per cent of the votes.
Christian Democrats
The virtual dictatorship of the
Christian Democrats has its pros
and cons, according to Hughes.
On the pro side, the party has
given Italy "law, order and sta
bilit v."
"f'.nt the Christian Democrats,"
Hughes said, "are a religious
party and take an intolerant view
of those not in their faith."
Indicating Italy is turning away
from its one-party system, sairl
Hughes, are the following devel
opments:.
• Attempts by the two wings
of the Socialist party to unite and
form a second party. "There is
some prospect that they will be
back together again by the elec
tion of 19.")8," Hughes said.
• The repeal of the "Swindle
Electoral Law," which gave Ihe
majority party two-thirds of the
seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
• Installation of ihe Constitu
tional Court. Modeled after the
U.S. Supreme Court, this judicial
body has "begun the process of
clearing the vestiges of Fascism
from the Italian political scene."
• Attempts to create new jobs
and settle the question of foreign
exploitation of Italian gas and oil
resources. These economic efforts
"will reduce dependence on for
eign imports and make Italy less
a prey to Communism," Hughes
maintained.

Italy is at its most important turning point in the past 50 years.
This is the opinion advanced yesterday afternoon by History Pro
fessor H. Stuart Ilughes, v/ho spoke in Bowman Alumni House at
an Institute of International Relations Cultural Talk
The outcome of present pivotal events in Italy may be to trans-

form the nation from a "paper
democracy" to a "real democra
cy," Hughes said.
At ihe present time, he de
clared, "the ilominarice of Italy by
the Christian Democratic party
without rival and democratic al
ternative is bad for Italy."
Socialist Party
The Socialist party in the Latin
nation is split into two wings.
The left wing controls 13 per cent
of the electorate, with the right
wing gobbling up only 7 per cent.
Thus, explained the history de
partment chairman, "Italian so
cialism is unable to he as impor
tant as French, German or Eng
lish socialism."
With the Socialists split, the
only rival to Christian Democracy
is the Communist party, dominat
ing 22 per cent of the votes.
Christian Democrats
The virtual dictatorship of the
Christian Democrats has its pros
and cons, according to Hughes.
On the pro side, the party has
given Italy "law, order and sta
bilit v."
"f'.nt the Christian Democrats,"
Hughes said, "are a religious
party and take an intolerant view
of those not in their faith."
Indicating Italy is turning away
from its one-party system, sairl
Hughes, are the following devel
opments:.
• Attempts by the two wings
of the Socialist party to unite and
form a second party. "There is
some prospect that they will be
back together again by the elec
tion of 19.")8," Hughes said.
• The repeal of the "Swindle
Electoral Law," which gave Ihe
majority party two-thirds of the
seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
• Installation of ihe Constitu
tional Court. Modeled after the
U.S. Supreme Court, this judicial
body has "begun the process of
clearing the vestiges of Fascism
from the Italian political scene."
• Attempts to create new jobs
and settle the question of foreign
exploitation of Italian gas and oil
resources. These economic efforts
"will reduce dependence on for
eign imports and make Italy less
a prey to Communism," Hughes
maintained.
