# The
						Point After

### Dean Stewart 
According to reports coming from the heart of the Big Ten, the
fans are still raving about the exciting show Brodie & Company
put on in Columbus last Saturday. If it hadn't been for the sound
of the Buckeyes' bell tolling out another Ohio State victory, one would
almost have thought Stanford had won Instead of lost a 12-point
decision.
Given the chance, Stanford could probably fill Ohio State's huge
horseshoe stadium to record-breaking capacity every Saturday from
now until Christmas. This is quite a compliment, for Midwesterners
take their football to heart.
Such Words of praise probably sound strange to a number
of StanfordlteH. After the Michigan State encounter no such
flowery words were tossed around, despite the fact Stanford
turned in an outstanding performance against a team that could
quite easily (urn <tiit to be the !>est in the nation.
Many students and "fans" were disheartened when the Cards
failed to score in the closing minutes of the game after recovering
a Spartan fumble deep in Michigan State territory. Perhaps the little
strength left in the nearly exhausted players was knocked out of
them by the sound of the yell leaders',voices pleading with the
STANFORD STUDENTS to remain until the end of the game. Cer
tainly the sight .of the continuous stream of white-shirted "rooters"
filing out of the stadium in the closing minutes of the fourth quarter
did little to raise the team's hopes.
In case you think a football team doesn't need and want your
support, you're mistaken. A former Stanford player, and a darn
good one at that, came by on his own the other day to voice his
opinion:
"Sometimes when you're down there on the field or sitting on the
bench you don't hear anything. But sometimes you do. .1 don't know
whether or not the players were aware of the fact Stanford students
were leaving during the game or not, but I do know it helps your
playing to know you have solid support coming from the stands.
"It seems like a pretty small thing to ask of a student, to
remain until the end of the game. Something ought to be done.
Saturday was one of the sorriest examples of school spirit I've
ever seen."
Straight talking like that can really hit hard. Especially when it
concerns you. The malady is strange in that only the victim can
cure it. Tomorrow during the San Jose State game would be a good
time to recover. (
The game is usually referred to as "no contest" by most, but the
Spartans point to this game more than any other on their schedule.
Stanford is the biggest name team they play. If they could wift only
one game a season, and had a choice, they probably would vote
unanimously for this one.
Because the Golden Raiders, as they prefer to be called, have
everything to gain and nothing to lose, they're quite willing to gamble
on every play. This often makes for exciting football, and Saturday's
aerial battle shouldn't be any exception.
From a Spartan viewpoint the 1954 contest, which is the only
game they've won, would probably be considered the high point of
the 13-game series. But from the viewpoint of an impartial fan, the
1948 affair would probably get the nod as the all-time thriller. The
'48 game was a loosely played, wild-and-woolly affair that was played
like a movie script.
To set the stage, it was late in the second half and State was
leading, 20-19. The Spartans had control of the ball and seemingly
were driving toward another touchdown. But a lowly guard rose
to the situation ami became Saturday's Hero.
This yeoman lineman's height of glory occurred when he found
himself the fifth man in the Spartan backfield. Literally stealing
the ball from the bewildered State quarterback, he kept right on
going and didn't stop until Stanford had six points.
Although the guard ran all the way unmolested, he made the most
of a moment that is only a dream to most linemen. Running with
the ball for one of the few times in his football career, he artfully
dodged imaginary tacklers and straight-armed others.
This brilliant display of broken field running' was not wasted.
The stolen touchdown turned out to be the margin of victory
as Stanford eked out a 26-20 win. The guard, however, did not
appear in the Indians' backfield the following week against
Oregon. He was returned to his guard post, where lie served
admirably for the remainder of the season.
To win consistently, a team's got to talented players and
support. The '48 group had support and played on spirit alone. They
succeeded in giving an Orange Bowl - bound Oregon team led by a
Dutchman listed as Norm Van Brocklin a real battle before bowing,
20-12. Rose bowl - bound Cal with Jackie Jensen & Company was
lucky to win, 7-6.
This year we've got the players, so it's up to you. Only you can
give them your support. With the spirit you can give them, this
talented '56 eleven could do wonders. It's happened before. But it's
up to you.
