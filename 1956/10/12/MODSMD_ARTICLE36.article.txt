pass receptions, according to na
tional statistics, having made 10
catches for 122 yards. He is sec
ond only to Norm Becker of Cal
in the Pacific Coast Conference
in yardage gained from recep
tions.
Although Camera feels that he
has not made John Brodie look as
good as he might have so far this
season, he is still in there with a
determination and a spunkiness
that makes for a winning team in
any man's ball club.
Besides being a fine defensive
and offensive player, Camera is
an all-around nice guy who is
well liked by his teammates and
everyone that knows him.

than twice as many as the next

the PCC, and fifteenth in the na
tion. His 330 yards were tops on
the coast, and twelfth nationally.
"We have a hell of n team this
year and credit should be given

in the last two games. But we
don't intend to lose any more this
season."

fine running back on the rugby
team. "Other than football and

in the last two games. But we
don't intend to lose any more this
season."

ford game many eyes will be on
Stanford's pass - grabbing left
halfback, Paul Camera. The In
dian leather-snatcher is now tied
for fourth place in the nation in
pass receptions, according to na
tional statistics, having made 10
catches for 122 yards. He is sec
ond only to Norm Becker of Cal
in the Pacific Coast Conference
in yardage gained from recep
tions.
Although Camera feels that he
has not made John Brodie look as
good as he might have so far this
season, he is still in there with a
determination and a spunkiness
that makes for a winning team in
any man's ball club.
Besides being a fine defensive
and offensive player, Camera is
an all-around nice guy who is
well liked by his teammates and
everyone that knows him.

switched to second-string varsity
fullback, appearing in six games
for a total of 41 minutes. Camera
was shifted again, to halfback, in
spring practice his sophomore
year.

own last season in minutes
played. Last fall he was second
high on the squad, with 415, more
than twice as many as the next
back.
Top Pass Catcher
Noted to be an excellent de
fensive player and fine blocker,
the Stanford flash became a
great offensive threat in 1955. lie

net yards, and caught 22 passes
for 330 yards and five touch
downs. The 22 receptions placed
him second to John Stewart in
the PCC, and fifteenth in the na

year and credit should be given
to Brodie and Wiggin," Camera

said. "Injuries have hurt us badly
and we have had some bad luck
in the last two games. But we
don't intend to lose any more this
season."
