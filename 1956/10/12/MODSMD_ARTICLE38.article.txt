# Moore Can Swim; No More Football
## 
### 
Robin Moore, Stanford swim
star and holder of the world's rec
ord for the 100-yard freestyle, re
tinned to the s-wim scene today.
He was hospitalized early last
week with a knee injury sus
tained in junior varsity football.
It was much less serious than
feared, but his football days, at
least this year, are over.
