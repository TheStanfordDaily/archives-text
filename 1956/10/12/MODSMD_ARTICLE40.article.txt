# Graves, Love, Chesarek Pace Stanford Cross-Country Team
## 
### 
What may be Stanford's finest
cross-country team goes into its
final week of workouts before
the opening meet with San Jose
State Oct. 20.
Maury Graves and Ralph Love,
a pair of hill-running veterans,
have set the pace during the
early weeks of conditioning ac
cording to Coach Pay ton Jordan.
Last spring as a sophomore,
Graves was among the nation's
finest runners in the two - mile
and 5000 meters. Love, a senior,
has looked excellent thus far, and
rates as the number two man be
hind Graves.
Don Chesarek holds a slight
edge for the third spot, with Bob
Monzingo pressing him closely.
Monzingo, easily the outstanding
freshman on the team, gained
prep fame last year at San Diego
Hoover when he ran the mile in
4:20.7.
Doug Martin, Ernie Cunliffe
and Don Thornberg round out
the top seven, but are by no
means sure of holding on to their
positions.
A trio of veterans, A 1 Salcedo,
Don Richardson and Art Gruver
have shown well in workouts.
Three freshmen who could break
into the main line later this sea
son are Doug Krotz, John Patter
son and Richard Lassen.
Although spike observers con
cede that this year's team will
probably be Stanford's best since
the school first fielded a team in

1952, Iho prospects are even
i brighter for 1957, since Love is
the only senior.
When Stanford meets San Jose
State next Saturday, the Indians
will be out to avenge a series of
losses they have suffered at the
hands of the always-strong Spar
tans.
! The Tribe has always had a
! particularly rough time running
on the San Jose course, but with
this year's meet to run conducted
lon the Stanford golf /course, the
I chances for a victory are consid
ered good.
