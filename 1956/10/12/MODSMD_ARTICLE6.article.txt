# Stevenson Says Ike's Health Plan 'Dragged'
## Kefauver Attacks GOP Farm Program; Says Merely Electioneering 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 11 -r
(UP)—Adlai E. Stevenson, in his
nation-wide telecast this evening
on health, said the Eisenhower
Administration for three years
"dragged its feet" in the develop
ment of programs to aid health
research and medical education,
waiting until this election year to
offer what Stevenson regards as
constructive proposals.
He acknowledged that it would
be utterly absurd to suggest that
one party favored better health
and the other party opposed it.
"Yet the fact is that in four
years of this Administration," he
said, "no real break-through in
the battle for the people's health
has been proposed. A family
struggling with illness and medi
cal bills has not had much sym
pathy."
Health Insurance
His broadcast was devoted pri
marily to restating his proposed
health insurance program which
he outlined in detail earlier this
week.
He pointed out again that he
was against any form of social
ized medicine, but he thought the
government should provide some
assistance, financial or otherwise,
in assuring complete medical care
for all persons—on a voluntary
basis and, also, on a basis of need.
And Kefauver ... *
Meanwhile, in Bayard, lowa, to
night Sen. Estes Kefauver charg
ed that the Eisenhower Adminis
tration has "politically tailored"
the soil bank program to pour
money into Midwest states "where
Republican politicians are in the
greatest trouble."
Kefauver said the new drought
relief program President Eisen
hower announced today is "just
for the election."
Kefauver said the Republicans
"are going to do a lot of things
by election time."
"They're just doing it to take
you in," he told a farm audience.
"You may get a little relief in the
next month or so, but that's just
for the election."
