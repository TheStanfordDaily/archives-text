# Fresh From Spartan Win, Indians Plan for Oregon
## Aerial Buttle Fails to Materialize as Gridders Grab 40-20 Triumph; Play Disappoints Taylor 
### Steve Baffrey 
After passing and running to a 40-20 win over the San Jose Spar
tans Saturday, the Stanford Indians return to Pacific Coast Confer
ence action this week in quest of the '56 conference title. Pounded
into rugged shape in encounters with the nation's best, Michigan
State and Ohio State, the Indians begin preparations today for the

Oregon Webfoots.
To date, Stanford sports a 2-2
win-loss record, including an
opening season victory over
Washington State in PCC play.
Coach Chuck Taylor, expressing
hope that his team "got through
their bad game" Saturday against
San Jose, takes the reins in prep
aration for the big ones in the
PCC — first Oregon, then USC,
UCLA, Oregon State, Washing
ton and California.
The great aerial battle expected
between the invading San Jose
State Spartans and the Stanford
Indians at Memorial Stadium on
Saturday never materialized. It
had been figured that the Spar
tans, who ranked second in the
nation in the passing department,
would give the third-place Indians
competition in the air lanes.
While the Indians threw only
eight more passes than the San
Joseans, the number of comple
tions was definitely the Cards'
show-stealing feat. San Jose con
nected on eight of their 26 throws
while the locals made good on 20
of 34.
No Completions
The Spartans went through the
entire first half before complet
ing a pass. Their starting quar
terback, Bob Reinhart, attempted
14 without success. Second
stringer Marvin McKean, also
listed as a top passer, appeared
during the first half only long
enough to hurl one aerial.
San Jose cashed in on ground
plays, though, outdistancing the
Indians 168 to 53 yards in the
first half and 281 to 137 yards for
the whole game. The Indian line
appeared helpless to stop the
Spartans' ground attack at
points.
Right half Art Powell, fullback
A 1 Chapman and left half Jim Ri
ley managed to pick up 40, 58 and
91 yards rushing, respectively,
during the game. One of Chap
man's runs was an off - tackle
slant for 46 yards midway
through the third quarter.
Although it took his first-string
team to win the game, Indian
coach Chuck Taylor managed to
play a good deal of his squad
during the fracas. The second
and third teams, though, did not
appear to be strong enough to
hold the Spartans back. It was
during these periods that the San
Joseans made their greatest ad
vances.
Injuries
The Indians, bothered by inju
ries to their top linemen all week,
were hurt temporarily during the
game when ace quarterback John
Brodie was cut over his eye and
had to have five stitches taken
in the wound.
As if Taylor's problems weren't
bad enough, the officials made
things tougher for him when
they ejected Donn Carswell late
in the second quarter. Carswell
and Spartan tackle Tom Ryan be
gan to mix it up over a post
whistle clip. Both were given the
heave.
Both the Indian and Spartan
pass defenses appeared in top
shape for the tussle. Brodie
seemed to be having trouble find
ing open receivers on many occa
sions throughout the game. The
testimony for the Indians lies in
the eight Spartan completions.
In some circles, uneven compe
tition has been given as a reason
for the Spartans' rise to their na
tional passing record berth. The
Indians certainly provided com
petition on Saturday, perhaps
enough to knock the SJ Staters
out of their spot, thereby leaving
it open for the tribe.
Out of Bounds
Left half Harv Pollard's two
game-opening kickoffs to the In
dians went out of bounds, giving
the Cards possession of the ball
on the 50 to open the game. Thus
began the Indians' first'march to
pay dirt.
Two Brodie - to - Camera passes
netted 39 yards. Fullback Lou
Valli and right half Gordy Young
carried the ball to the one where
Young jumped over right guard
for the score. Fullback Mickey
Raftery's kick was good.
Just four minutes later the In
dians again were within striking
distance. A 15-yard penalty and
Reinhart's inability to connect on
air plays forced the Spartans to
punt from their own 20.
The kick was taken by Valli
who reversed to Young on the
Stanford 39. Aided by a Ben Rob
inson block, Young scooted to the
23.
17-Yard Flip
A 17-yard flip to Valli moved
Brodie and Co. closer to the end
zone. After losing five yards on
an off-side penalty, Brodie
pitched 11 yards to end Carl
Isaacs for the second Stanford
TD. This time Doug Dick's kick
went under the crossbar.
San Jose scored for the first

time with 4Vj minutes gone in
the second stanza. After return
ing a punt to their own 27, half
back Jim Riley took a hand-off
from McKean and scooted
through a hole in the left tackle
position for 73 yards and the six
pointer. McKean converted.
The Cardinals brought the |
score to 20-7 at half-time when j
they scored with one minute and
33 seconds left to play. From the
Indian 38 Brodie passed to Raft
ery for 14 and to Isaacs for 16.
A Jeri McMillin run brought
the ball to the Spartan 25 where
Brodie heaved to Raftery who
just managed to snare the pitch
in the end zone while trying to
shake a San Jose defender. Raft
ery also added the PAT.
Touchdown
With Jack Douglas quarter
backing the team the Indians
picked up 56 yards in five plays
to grab the first of their two tal
lies in the third quarter. Valli
climaxed the drive on a 12-yard
run to pick up six points.
Late in the period, after Bro- ■
die's return to the game, Young
gained 26 yards in five carries,
eventually scoring after a 24-yard
pass from Brodie to Camera. Tay
lor scored the point.
The San Jose score came be
tween the Stanford markers. Af
ter Chapman's 46-yard gallop,
small line gains and a 10-yard
Reinhart - to - tackle Jim Moore
pass ended in the end zone. Rein
hart added.
San Jose opened fourth-period
scoring. After moving 69 yards
in 16 plays, Reinhart passed in
complete to the end zone, but in
terference was called against the
Indians and they were penalized
to their one-yard line. Reinhart l
scored on a keep-it, bur failed to I
convert.
Similar Flay
The final Indian tally came on
a similar play. After- moving
from their own 32 with a varied
air and land attack, the Indians'
Dick hit the right tackle spot for
the score, but the Indians were

set back five yards for an off-side
penalty.
Roy Stephen lost five on a
pitch-out, but an SJS penalty
moved the pigskinnto their one
where Douglas passed to Camera
for the score. Raftery added the
PAT to close the game's scoring.
In the Stanford passing statis
' tics, Brodie remained above the
50 per cent mark, completing 13
of 24, but "fell percentage points
behind his earlier season show
ings. His passes netted 199 yards.
Douglas completed five of seven
and Taylor two of three for 37
and 31 yards, in that order.
Gordy Young was the leading
ground gainer for the Tribe. He
gathered 60 yards in 14. plays for
a 4.3 average. Riley topped the
Spartan list with 15.7 average,
carrying six times for 94 yards.
