# Fresh From Spartan Win, Indians Plan for Oregon
## Aerial Buttle Fails to Materialize as Gridders Grab 40-20 Triumph; Play Disappoints Taylor 
### Steve Baffrey 
After passing and running to a 40-20 win over the San Jose Spar
tans Saturday, the Stanford Indians return to Pacific Coast Confer
ence action this week in quest of the '56 conference title. Pounded
into rugged shape in encounters with the nation's best, Michigan
State and Ohio State, the Indians begin preparations today for the

Oregon Webfoots.
To date, Stanford sports a 2-2
win-loss record, including an
opening season victory over
Washington State in PCC play.
Coach Chuck Taylor, expressing
hope that his team "got through
their bad game" Saturday against
San Jose, takes the reins in prep
aration for the big ones in the
PCC — first Oregon, then USC,
UCLA, Oregon State, Washing
ton and California.
The great aerial battle expected
between the invading San Jose
State Spartans and the Stanford
Indians at Memorial Stadium on
Saturday never materialized. It
had been figured that the Spar
tans, who ranked second in the
nation in the passing department,
would give the third-place Indians
competition in the air lanes.
While the Indians threw only
eight more passes than the San
Joseans, the number of comple
tions was definitely the Cards'
show-stealing feat. San Jose con
nected on eight of their 26 throws
while the locals made good on 20
of 34.
No Completions
The Spartans went through the
entire first half before complet
ing a pass. Their starting quar
terback, Bob Reinhart, attempted
14 without success. Second
stringer Marvin McKean, also
listed as a top passer, appeared
during the first half only long
enough to hurl one aerial.
San Jose cashed in on ground
plays, though, outdistancing the
Indians 168 to 53 yards in the
first half and 281 to 137 yards for
the whole game. The Indian line
appeared helpless to stop the
Spartans' ground attack at
points.
Right half Art Powell, fullback
A 1 Chapman and left half Jim Ri
ley managed to pick up 40, 58 and
91 yards rushing, respectively,
during the game. One of Chap
man's runs was an off - tackle
slant for 46 yards midway
through the third quarter.
Although it took his first-string
team to win the game, Indian
coach Chuck Taylor managed to
play a good deal of his squad
during the fracas. The second
and third teams, though, did not
appear to be strong enough to
hold the Spartans back. It was
during these periods that the San
Joseans made their greatest ad
vances.
Injuries
The Indians, bothered by inju
ries to their top linemen all week,
were hurt temporarily during the
game when ace quarterback John
Brodie was cut over his eye and
had to have five stitches taken
in the wound.
As if Taylor's problems weren't
bad enough, the officials made
things tougher for him when
they ejected Donn Carswell late
in the second quarter. Carswell
and Spartan tackle Tom Ryan be
gan to mix it up over a post
whistle clip. Both were given the
heave.
Both the Indian and Spartan
