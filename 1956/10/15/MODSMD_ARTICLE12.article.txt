# West Will Push Plans For Suez Association Despite Russian Veto
## Hammarskjold Will Negotiate For Suez Pact Dulles Says Grounds For Hope Still Exist; He Will Ignore Veto 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct.
14 (UP) The West pushed plan
for its Suez Canal Users' Associ
ation to challenge Egypt's grip on
the waterway today despite Rus
sia's veto of the idea in the Unit
ed Nations Security Council.
Western diplomats left it up to
UN Secretary-General Dag il.im
marsk.jold to try to thrash out a
Sup/, settlement between Egypt
and Britain and France outside
the deadlocked Council while it
went ahead with its program to
organize the shipping of 15 na
tions for transiting the canal. An
administrator for the association
was expected to he named thiy
week to make it operational.
Veto Crushes Hopes
The Soviet veto last night in
the Security Council crushed A.n
glo-French hopes for approval of
the American-sponsored plan for
internationalization of the canal
and recognition of the association
as legally qualified to accept canal
tolls from member nations.
But there still was hope that a
diplomatic settlement could be
arranged since the 11-member
Council approved a six-point set
of principles designed to govern
future negotiations.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles, who returned to Washing
ton today from the Council meet
ing which ended last night, said
there are "good grounds for
hope" for a settlement.
Negotiations Continue
Negotiations would "go ahead
just as though there had not been
a veto," Dulles said.
The West took the attitude that
the Soviet veto cleared the air
and isolated Egypt and Russia
together, a move not likely to sit
well with oil - producing Arab
states which depend on the West
for much of their revenue.
Only Yugoslavia voted in the
Council with Russia against the
Western plan.
UN action was expected to con
tinue through Ham marsk.j old's
office. Dulles said Hammarskiold
would "continue to encourage"
separate negotiations.
Hammarskjold confirmed this,
saying, "My own efforts to be of
assistance will be pursued as in
dicated by Secretary Dulles."

Negotiations Continue
Negotiations would "go ahead
just as though there had not been
a veto," Dulles said.
The West took the attitude that
the Soviet veto cleared the air
and isolated Egypt and Russia
together, a move not likely to sit
well with oil - producing Arab
states which depend on the West
for much of their revenue.
Only Yugoslavia voted in the
Council with Russia against the
Western plan.
UN action was expected to con
tinue through Ham marsk.j old's
office. Dulles said Hammarskiold
would "continue to encourage"
separate negotiations.
Hammarskjold confirmed this,
saying, "My own efforts to be of
assistance will be pursued as in
dicated by Secretary Dulles."
