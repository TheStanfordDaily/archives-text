### Anne Johnson 
What may he good for your, country may nol bo good for ours,
Indian women's leader Mrs. Pushpa R. Mehta explained during an
interview Friday in Hoover Library.
"Just because the United States is giving us help doesn't mean
we have to follow its philosophy. We are a democracy also, and we

are building up our own country."
Mrs. Mehta, secretary of the All
India Women's Conference, is
touring the United States to ob
serve welfare work and volunteer
welfare organizations.
The Wo m en's Conference is
non-political and never supports a
party, she emphasized. But il lolls
women they must exercise their
right to vote.
Women in Politics
Proudly, Mrs. Mehta comment
ed that in India's first election in
1950 more women were elected to
the national house and state legis
latures than in any other country.
With another election coming up,
her organization is campaigning
to get every party to include wom
en candidates.
Founded 30 years ago, the Wom
en's Conference originally was or
ganized to promote education and
reforms. "We got everything we
were working for" when, India
achieved its independence, Mrs.
Mehta said.
"Today we are not pro Ameri
can, we are not pro Communist,
and we are definitely not pro Kng
lish," she declared. "We are pro
Indian."
Mrs. Mwhta emphasized that her
country is not afraid of the Com
munists, although they are next
door neighbors.
Standard of Living 1
All interest is being focused on
raising the standard of living in
India and educating its people,
she said. The women's group she
belongs to is parent body over
280 other organizations working
to improve the welfare and stalus
of women and children. These
branches run schools, distribute
medicine, help in emergencies and
flo other activities.
Funds are provided by volun
tary contributions, dues and aid
from national, state and local gov
ernments, she explained.
Mrs. Mehta stressed the fact
that the Women's Conference con
sults with the United Nations.
Women's University
The Indian Women's University,
which allows women to attend its
classes in their spare time, was
founded by the group. It special
izes in teaching home science and
education, she said, but doesn't
work on any sort of semester
basis.
Main reason for her visit to the
United States, the Indian woman
concluded, is to exchange ideas
"so we can get to know each other
bet ter."
