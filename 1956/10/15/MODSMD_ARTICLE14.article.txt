### 
BUDAPEST, Oct. 14 (UP) â€”
Hungary's Communist party to
day restored ousted Premier Imre
Nagy to membership, in its con
tinuing program of "rehabilitat
ing" the Titoists of the Stalin era.
The publie aeeeptanee of Nagy
bnek into Hie party was accom
panied with a frank admission
that "personal prejudice" on the
part of ex-party boss Matyas Ra
kosi had contributed to Nagy's
downfall.
It all fitted in with the current
program to develop closer rela
tions with Yugoslavia. Napy was
restored to the fold just hours
before a top-level Hungarian dele
gation led by eurrenl party chief
Rrno Geroe and Premier Andras
Hegedus departed for Belgrade to
open a series of bury-t he-hatchet
talks with Marshal Tito himself.
"Deviations"
Nagy was booted from the
party last November and accused
of Titoisl "deviations."
He had lost out as premier on
April 18, 19.">r>. The party's central
committee**had denounced his
"soft" course and ordered a re
turn to the program of concen
trating oti development of heavy
industry.
His ouster followed that of Pre
mier Oeorgi IVT Malenkov in Rus
sia, who had followed the same
"soft" line of economic develop
ment. Nagy had permitted farm
ers to leave collective farms. They
did so in droves, and he admitted
his farm program had failed.
Since 1953
Nagy, now 61, had taken over
as premier in 1953.
Rakosi, his nemesis, is an old
line Stalinist who resigned his
party leadership earlier this year
with an admission that he had
made mistakes.
A party resolution dated yester
day and printed in the official
Communist newspaper Szabad
Nop answered Nagy's demand of
Oct. 1 that his case be reopened
for discussion. At the time Nagy
admitted his "mistakes" of the
past
The party resolution said that,
while Nagy had committed "po
litical mistakes," they did not
warrant his expulsion from the
prn ty.
