### 
Temperatures in the waters of the Suez
Canal reached boiling point during the past
two months, but with the submission of the
problem to the United Nations the tempera
ture-reading no longer indicates imminent ex
plosion.
Unilateral threats by the British, French and
Egyptians have now been replaced by multi
lateral discussion. However impassioned and
recalcitrant many of the concerned parties
appear to be, from this discussion in the Se
curity Council has come approval of six prin
ciples providing for free and open transit
through the canal, respect for Egyptian sover
eignty, "insulation" of the operation of the
canal from politics of any country, agreement
on tolls and charges by Egypt and the canal
users, a fair amount of the charges to go for
future canal development and international ar
bitration of canal disputes.
However innocuous these resolutions may
seem on the surface, they at least represent the
first concrete agreement reached between Egvpt
and the canal users —-a step that cannot be
totally erased bv Russia's veto of the Western

proposal to internationalize tlie canal.
This veto was expected, and suck action l>y
the Soviet Union will continue so Ion}; as ihe
Communists can see adavntage in championing
the cause of the economic underdog.
The Suez dispute, watched attentively by all
nations of the world, has degenerated into a
desperate face-saving attempt on the part of
the West. As the West is rapidly being pushed
out o( the Middle East, Russia is rapidly push
ing herself in with promises of economic aid
and diplomatic assistance in the Arab fight for
international recognition.
The dispute in itself is serious, but its pro
portions become more impressive when one
considers it is only a surface sore reflecting the
insurgent emotions of the Arab peoples against
Western economic "imperialism." The problem
is long-range and must be dealt with as such.
The international forum of the United Na
tions and the good offices of Secretary-General
Dag Hainmarskjold show signs of proving the
best source from which to achieve a workable
Suez solution, (or here both Egypt and the
canal users can sample and to a decree reflect
world public opinion.

and the canal users —-a step that cannot be
totally erased bv Russia's veto of the Western

proposal to internationalize tlie canal.
This veto was expected, and suck action l>y
the Soviet Union will continue so Ion}; as ihe
Communists can see adavntage in championing
the cause of the economic underdog.
The Suez dispute, watched attentively by all
nations of the world, has degenerated into a
desperate face-saving attempt on the part of
the West. As the West is rapidly being pushed
out o( the Middle East, Russia is rapidly push
ing herself in with promises of economic aid
and diplomatic assistance in the Arab fight for
international recognition.
The dispute in itself is serious, but its pro
portions become more impressive when one
considers it is only a surface sore reflecting the
insurgent emotions of the Arab peoples against
Western economic "imperialism." The problem
is long-range and must be dealt with as such.
The international forum of the United Na
tions and the good offices of Secretary-General
Dag Hainmarskjold show signs of proving the
best source from which to achieve a workable
Suez solution, (or here both Egypt and the
canal users can sample and to a decree reflect
world public opinion.
