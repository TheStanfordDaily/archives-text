# What's to Blame?

Stanford spiritâ€”whatever it is, wo just "ain't
got it."
At the last two home games this thing we
call "the Stanford spirit" wasn't present. Some
hi ame the heat and some blame the undefinahle
"apathy of upper-classmen."
Well, one thing is for sure: the football team
has "the spirit." If you don't believe us, call
Michigan State or Ohio State.
Many blame the yell leaders. Fverv year

there is apathy among the older students. This
is recognizable when a large university has a
bad team, hut Stanford has a good team, if not
a great one.
Many believe that Head Yell Leader Hill
Duke isn't tactful in handling the older stu
dents. It may be that the older students are
not giving Duke a chance.
Duke won t have In worry about getting "the
spirit" back for the SC game. It'll be there
with or without the cheering section's help.
