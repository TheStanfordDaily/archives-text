Rooters Lack Co-operation
Editor, The Daily:
We noticed Saturday that the Stanford men's
rooting section didn't give the San Jose pompon
girls the usual ovation given in the past years.
We believe that this apparent apathy is really a
tribute to our own pompon girls, 1956 edition.
Not only did our girls perform well, but they
also outdid the San Jose group in both pep and
proportions. We've finally excelled the Spartans
in the last, and most beautiful, department at the
Spartan-Indian games.
One last barrel to be fired: Bill Lackey may

not be the calmest man to direct card stunts, but
we do not feel that the lack of cooperation ex
hibited by certain elements of the men's rooting
section helped to make his job any easierâ€”with
the band, San Jose's rooting section and milling
crowd at the base of the section already giving
Lackey headaches.
It wasn't a very good practice session for the
SC stunts.
May the pompon girls keep bouncing and the
rooting section begin cooperating at half-time.
