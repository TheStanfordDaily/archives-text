# Spartan Fans Root, Indian Rooters Hoot
## Paper-Plane Contest Gains SJS Attention; 'World Record' Set 
### Dick Meister 
A hustling San Jose State team
kept Spartan partisans on edge
throughout Saturday's battle, but
the winning Indians couldn't ac
complish the same with a listless
Stanford crowd.
Some 8000 San Jose fans
screamed till the closing minutes
of the 40-20 Stanford victory,
while their counterparts on the
home town side of the stadium
spent more time hooting their
own yell leaders than rooting the
Indians to their second win of the
season.
The Spartans were outclassed
on the gridiron, but certainly not
in the stands. Even when Stan
ford tackle Troy Barbee was in
jured in the third quarter it was
the San Jose rooters who gave
the cheers. The Indian section
was silent, Yell Leader Bill Duke
explaining that "a player has to
leave the game before he can get
a cheer."
Charity Begins
Apparently, charity does not
begin at home—at least at Stan
ford for, when a Spartan was
injured but stayed in the game,
the Indian rooting section came
forth with the rah, rah, rah.
One Stanford player who left
the game got some vocal appreci
ation. He was Donn Carswell, the
big guard who exchanged blows
with Spartan tackle Tom Ryan in
the second quarter when Ryan
clipped Carswell after the whistle
had been blown.
A pre-game column in the San
Jose State daily paper warned
Spartan linemen about Carswell,
ending with these words of cau
tion: "Watch out for flying gar
bage cans," but neglecting to warn
of flying fists.
Saturday's battle was the big
one for the Spartans, which ex
plains the large, enthusiastic
crowd and the fighting State club.
Pompon Leg Art
San Jose's famous pompon girls
put on their usual fine show, but
were matched by Stanford's new
beauty line—for the first time in
Spartan-Indian game history. The
crowd of 25,000 was treated to a
pleasing eyeful of talented gyra
tions and leg art, collegiate style.
Once more it was John Brodie
who gave fans their top Saturday
thrills, but his passing was far
from ,its usual accuracy. This,
coupled with the great number of
penalties, some surprisingly slop
py play and the early-game heat,
kept local partisans quiet—often
inaudible across the stadium.
As the final seconds of the
game ticked away, a "Beat SC"
chant arose from the Stanford
section and the public address an
nouncer warned, "Don't forget
October 27, when Stanford meets
Southern California in Stanford
Stadium."
As if anyone would forget. It
won't be so quiet that Saturday
afternoon.

py play and the early-game heat,
kept local partisans quiet—often
inaudible across the stadium.
As the final seconds of the
game ticked away, a "Beat SC"
chant arose from the Stanford
section and the public address an
nouncer warned, "Don't forget
October 27, when Stanford meets
Southern California in Stanford
Stadium."
As if anyone would forget. It
won't be so quiet that Saturday
afternoon.
A hustling San Jose State team
kept Spartan partisans on edge
throughout Saturday's battle, but
the winning Indians couldn't ac
complish the same with a listless
Stanford crowd.
Some 8000 San Jose fans
screamed till the closing minutes
of the 40-20 Stanford victory,
while their counterparts on the
home town side of the stadium
spent more time hooting their
own yell leaders than rooting the
Indians to their second win of the
season.
The Spartans were outclassed
on the gridiron, but certainly not
in the stands. Even when Stan
ford tackle Troy Barbee was in
jured in the third quarter it was
the San Jose rooters who gave
the cheers. The Indian section
was silent, Yell Leader Bill Duke
explaining that "a player has to
leave the game before he can get
a cheer."
Charity Begins
Apparently, charity does not
begin at home—at least at Stan
ford for, when a Spartan was
injured but stayed in the game,
the Indian rooting section came
forth with the rah, rah, rah.
One Stanford player who left
the game got some vocal appreci
ation. He was Donn Carswell, the
big guard who exchanged blows
with Spartan tackle Tom Ryan in
the second quarter when Ryan
clipped Carswell after the whistle
had been blown.
A pre-game column in the San
Jose State daily paper warned
Spartan linemen about Carswell,
ending with these words of cau
tion: "Watch out for flying gar
bage cans," but neglecting to warn
of flying fists.
Saturday's battle was the big
one for the Spartans, which ex
plains the large, enthusiastic
crowd and the fighting State club.
Pompon Leg Art
San Jose's famous pompon girls
put on their usual fine show, but
were matched by Stanford's new
beauty line—for the first time in
Spartan-Indian game history. The
crowd of 25,000 was treated to a
pleasing eyeful of talented gyra
tions and leg art, collegiate style.
Once more it was John Brodie
who gave fans their top Saturday
thrills, but his passing was far
from ,its usual accuracy. This,
coupled with the great number of
penalties, some surprisingly slop
py play and the early-game heat,
kept local partisans quiet—often
inaudible across the stadium.
