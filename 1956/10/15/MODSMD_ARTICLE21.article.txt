# THIS WEEK ON QUADâ€”By Earl Cilley
## Dull Week Enlivened by Theatre Matinee 
### 
Talk about the frenetic social program at the
country club of the West Coast universities.
Things are duller this week than the ditch-water
of song and story. But, such as it is, here we are:
Tuesday Evening Series this week features a
lecture-plus by Stanley Donner, boss man of the
Speech and Drama Department's radio and TV
department, entitled "Radio and Television in
France Today." Along with the lecture come
samples of "Musique Concrete." So, for lecture
and free samples, try Mem Aud tomorrow night
at 7:30.

Wednesday afternoon is Little Theatre Matinee
time, and this week one Don Soule, a particularly
talented and highly engaging thespian, with an
able group of local S&D-ers (Helene Blattner, Bob
Loper, Doug Cook, Bill Kinsolving and Dave
O'Brien), will giye a program of readings from
the work of Christopher Fry.
Being as this is a half student-half faculty
project, and considering that Don Soule is the
muscle behind the whole thing, you might ar
range to be in Little Theatre at 4:15 when the
houselights come down and footlights come up.
This is pretty definitely the week's best bet.

I
City Culture Note: This is your last chance to
see the best of the opera offerings which go on
in San Francisco during the year, with the San
Francisco Opera Company giving its final per
formances at the Opera House this week. To
morrow night it's "La Boheme"; Wednesday,!
"Aida"; Thursday, "The Elixir ol Love."

Thursday afternoon at 4:1,"> Professor John*C.
Loftis of the English Department will lecture to
the Stanford Philological Association, and anyone
else who cares to come, on the subject of "Social
Patterns in Early - 18th Century Theatrical Criti
cism." Lower lounge, Women's Clubhouse.

For those of you who are troubled with diges
tive upsets, the best way to stimulate the old
peristalsis and probably to purge yourselves in
the bargain is to run an eye down the flicks
schedule for this fall.
Sunday night the fair Miss Kelly again Graces
the screen of Memorial Auditorium in a film
Which has only been here twice before and has
been satirized in the 1954 "Gaieties."
It's called "Rear Window." Movies are better
than ever. Yes, sir. Just can't wear 'em out.
