# 'Tea and Sympathy' Tasteful, Beautiful 'Broadway' Picture
## Deborah Kerr Merits Oscar for Playing Role Of Wife of New England Boys' School Teacher 
### Richard Lamb 
"Tea and Sympathy," now at
the Varsity Theatre, is one of the
best movies Broadway has
turned out. It is a story of ten
derness and violence, brilliantly
written, expertly acted and
brought to the screen as a taste
ful, beautiful picture.
Robert Anderson's screenplay
is just as perceptive as his origi
nal script. Although Tom Lee's
suspected sexual abnormalcy is
treated euphemistically through
out in order to pass the Holly
wood Production Code, Anderson
has miraculously kept all his
ideas intact.
In fact, subtlety has in some
ways given a new and more pro
found meaning to this story of a
persecuted boy and a woman who
compassionately sacrifices her
self in order to help him prove
his manhood.
Original Stars
The principal roles are played
by the original stars of the stage
production. Deborah Kerr is
magnificent as Laura, wife of an
instructor at a boys' school in
New England. She deserves I he
Oscar, and she will probably win
it.
John Kerr, who looks equally
like Oscar Levant and James
Dean, is the first of the young
men who played Tom Lee on
Broadway to cause a stir in Hol
lywood. Tony Perkins and Don
Dubbins, the other two, are in hot
pursuit.
This is only Kerr's third pic
ture, but he receives equal billing
with the veteran Miss Kerr, and
he should put up almost as much
fight for the Academy statuette.
Egoistic Husband
In the role of Laura's egoistic
husband, Lcif Erickson gives a
first-rate performance that
should easily put him on the
Oscar roster. Also excellent are

Norma Crane as the local Polly
Adler, Edward Andrews as Tom's
father and Darryl Hickman as
his roommate.
It is generally assumed that
dramas about intense, neurotic
people must be filmed in black
and-white and shown on a nar
row screen so that shading and
close-ups can create the necessary
moody atmosphere. If "Rebel
Without a Cause" didn't disprove
this bromide "Tea and Sympa
thy" in CinemaScope and Metro
color will.
Not only is there no cramped
mechanical action that so often
mars the film versions of stage
plays, but there are some scenes
in which the photography in
duces strikingly beautiful effects
â€”a great deal like the recent Jap
anese imports.
All in all, there just aren't
many pictures as good as "Tea
and Sympathy." It certainly be
longs in the handful of the year's
finest.
