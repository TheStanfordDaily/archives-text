# 'Our Worst' Says Taylor
## 
### Dean Stewart 
"This was by far our poorest
game to date. We made many
mistakes, too many. I feel like
we lost the game."
Those were a few of the com
ments Coach Chuck Taylor di
rected to several inquiring re
porters after Stanford's 40-20 win
over - San Jose State.
"Our first two touchdowns
came too easy. We just let down
too soon. I guess it should have
been expected after our previous
big games against the Big Ten.
"We just weren't hitting. And
our tackling. It practically didn't
exist. I giiess every team has a
game like this that they've got to
get out of their system. I hope
this was our only one."
In the locker room Stanford
players had mixed emotions fol
lowing their ejasy victory. Since
the lockers are assigned alpha
betically, the Jim Brodie - Paul
Camera corner was the center of
attention.
Camera, one of the few Card
players singled out for praise by
Taylor, was all smiles. The rug
ged left halfback had his best day
this season.
"I caught eight passes," Ca
mera said to an inquiring report
er who asked Camera if he hap
pened to know how many he
nabbed during the game.
"Sure he knows," jokingly vol
unteered Joel Freis. "He counted
every one."
Just after the start of the sec
ond half, BrOdie, bleeding pro
fusely from a head wound, was
forced to leave the game.
"Some guy kicked me with his
shoe," said Brodie in explanation.
"They had to put five stitches in
it."
"Except for Brodie's cut. we
didn't have any injuries of conse
quence," said team trainer Con
nie Jarvis. "But that darn Bro
die. He was worried more about
getting blood on his uniform than
he was about his head.
"Brodie's cut didn't break
clean, more of a tear. He should
be all right but he bled like a
stuck pig for a while.
"He thought he was going to
bleed all over me. I had to keep
him at a distance. Couldn't take
any chances on getting blood all
over my white suede shoes."

been expected after our previous
big games against the Big Ten.
"We just weren't hitting. And
our tackling. It practically didn't
exist. I giiess every team has a
game like this that they've got to
get out of their system. I hope
this was our only one."
In the locker room Stanford
players had mixed emotions fol
lowing their ejasy victory. Since
the lockers are assigned alpha
betically, the Jim Brodie - Paul
Camera corner was the center of
attention.
Camera, one of the few Card
players singled out for praise by
Taylor, was all smiles. The rug
ged left halfback had his best day
this season.
"I caught eight passes," Ca
mera said to an inquiring report
er who asked Camera if he hap
pened to know how many he
nabbed during the game.
"Sure he knows," jokingly vol
unteered Joel Freis. "He counted
every one."
Just after the start of the sec
ond half, BrOdie, bleeding pro
fusely from a head wound, was
forced to leave the game.
"Some guy kicked me with his
shoe," said Brodie in explanation.
"They had to put five stitches in
it."
"Except for Brodie's cut. we
didn't have any injuries of conse
quence," said team trainer Con
nie Jarvis. "But that darn Bro
die. He was worried more about
getting blood on his uniform than
he was about his head.
"Brodie's cut didn't break
clean, more of a tear. He should
be all right but he bled like a
stuck pig for a while.
"He thought he was going to
bleed all over me. I had to keep
him at a distance. Couldn't take
any chances on getting blood all
over my white suede shoes."
"This was by far our poorest
game to date. We made many
mistakes, too many. I feel like
we lost the game."
Those were a few of the com
ments Coach Chuck Taylor di
rected to several inquiring re
porters after Stanford's 40-20 win
over - San Jose State.
"Our first two touchdowns
came too easy. We just let down
too soon. I guess it should have
been expected after our previous
big games against the Big Ten.
