# OSC Humbles Bears; UCLA, Wash Winners
## 
### Bob Payne 
Smelling roses after last week's
upset win over Pittsburgh, the
California Golden Bears were
flattened by a bruising band of
Oreogn State Beavers Saturday,
21-13, in their first conference
outing. Other PCC action saw
Washington whip Oregon, 20-7,
and UCLA down Washington
State, 28-0.
A big, tough OSC line wore
down the green Bear forwards in
the second half after Cal had
taken a 13-0 lead at intermission.
Tom Berry scored once and Paul
"Bicycle Thief" Lowe twice as
the Bears deflated, at least tem
porarily, the Bears' lofty visions
of Pasadena. A rash of penalties
crippled OSC in the first half, not
to mention the accurate passing
of Cal quarterbacks Joe Kapp and
Joe Condestabile.
In Seattle, Oregon fumbled
away its chance for an upset win
over Washington, losing the ball
five times on bobbles. A stout de
fense. first in the conference,
contained the Husky attack after
two early scores, but the Ducks
couldn't hang on to the pigskin.
Dick Day, 240-pound Washington
tackle, made three fumble recov
eries.
UCLA rolled to its 18th straight
conference trumph Saturday,
and stopped the nation's No. 1
passing team, Washington State,
in doing it. Sophomore tailback
Don Long paced the Bruin attack
which took advantage of breaks
to score every touchdown. The
Cougars were effective between
the 30-yard markers, but bogged
down when they reached scoring
territory.
