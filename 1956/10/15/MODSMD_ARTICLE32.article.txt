# Nicolet Passing Gives Braves Tie Against California JV's
## 
### 
Bob Nicolet, Milwaukee's finest, passed the Stanford Braves to a
13-13 deadlock with the favored California Ramblers in Saturday's
Stanford Stadium preliminary. *
Connecting on 16 of 2(5 attempts, the sophomore quarterliack ac->
counted for a majority of the Indian Jayvees' 281 yards in the air,

tossed two come-from-behind
touchdown passes, kicked one
conversion, and spearheaded a
last-minute drive which died on
the 20 when the game ended.
Hank Roldan a first - string
halfback on the 19."53 Frosh squad
who has been acting as assistant
to trainer Connie Jarvis this sea
! son, donned a suit "just for the
heck of it"and took a four-yard
, second - quarter touchdown pass
! from Nicolet.
Roldan joined Wally Honeywell
| in sparking the Brave ground at
tack. Playing the flanker-half po
sition in Coach Mai Elward's
"strictly amateur" offense, quar
terback Les Hopkins caught a 23-
yard Nicolet pass which knotted
the count in the fourth quarter.
