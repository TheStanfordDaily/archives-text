# Encina Hall Again Deserted; 100 Women Migrate to Moore
## Feminine Delight Expressed at Desired Move; Many Details Yet to Be Completed at Moore 
### Joan Woods 
Encina stands deserted once again.
The shocking break with tradition which saw 100 women moved
into the hallowed men's dormitory is now a part of Stanford history.
Faces, or all that could be seen of them over the heaps of clothes,
books and phonograph records, were wreathed in happy smiles as

women stumbled down the stairs
of Encina for the last time.
No tears were shed at the fi
nale of the once-in-a-lifetime ex
perience. Most of the women ex
pressed relief to be out of ''that
dump" although laughing refer
ence was made to experiences
that will not soon be forgotten.
Memories
Some of these memories might
include the days without hot wa
ter, the heatless rooms at night
and the bats which several girls
have sworn they saw flying
around the central staircase.
Paloma, originally called "A,"
moved into Florence Moore Hall
Wednesday and Alondra, the
original wing "B," on Thursday.
The additional moving, exactly
weeks after Registration Day,
was handled by the University
which incurred all expenses.
Many details remain to be
finished inside the buildings.
Lounges and laundry rooms <are
still incomplete. The administra
tion building is expected to be
completed within a week, accord
ing to Margaret Trainor, hall di
rector.
Landscaping
Preparations for landscaping
have been started and planting is
due to begin in two weeks, ac
cording to Seraphim R. Post, as
sistant business manager, who
said all construction and land
scaping is tentatively set for com
pletion by Dec. 1.
Meanwhile, Encina stands si
lent and deserted after the tem
porary female invasion. Strips of
pink and white crepe paper, all
tha't remains of the decorations
put up by Stern men, hang from
the pillars.
The sign saying "Encina Wom
en Only" has fallen down.
