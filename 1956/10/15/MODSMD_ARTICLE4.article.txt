A fire, supposed to be under control, got out of hand Friday after
noon at about. 2 p.m. and burned the grass off 100 acres of Stanford
land. Manx-s swept westward toward May field Avenue between
Stanford Avenue and the Wilbur Hall parking lot. Fire Chief John*
Marston said the farmer who least's the land had the fire under
control until the wind shifted. There was no damage, Marston
reported. â€”Daily Photo by George Wyse
