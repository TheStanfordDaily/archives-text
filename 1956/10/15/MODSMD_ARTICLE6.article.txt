### 
PASADENA. Oct. 14 (UP)
Ten scientists at California Insti
tute of Technology today issued
a joint statement in support of
Adlai Stevenson's proposal that
the United States take the lead in
seeking to end H-bomb tests.
Their statement declared Ste
venson's proposal "might be a
useful way to get the negotia
tions out of the deadlock stage."
At the same time, the scien
tists, including Dr. Carl D. Ander
son, Nobel laureate in physics for
1934, took issue with President
Eisenhower's expression of re
gret that the question had be
come a campaign issue.
Small Proportion
"On the contrary," their state
ment said, "we find it regrettable
that discussions of our military
strength, of our vulnerability and
our foreign policy in relation to
H-bombs h;ive thus far represent
ed such a small proportion of cur
rent political discussions."
The statement warned:
"Time is running out, with an
implacability that we ignore at
our peril.
". . . After 10 years of negotia
tion, the world has no other guar
antee of survival than the tenu
ous hope that no nation will pull
the trigger for fear of commit
ting national suicide."
Take Issue
The scientists took issue with
arguments that halting of ll
bomb tests necessarily would al
low Russia to out-distance the
U.S. in nu c Ie a r development,
would endanger national security
or hinder other areas of nuclear
research.
"These criticisms . . . give in
adequate attention to . . . the ur
gency of dealing immediately
with the peril that confronts the
world," they said.
They declared that events of
the next four years could deter
mine whether civilization survives
or dies.
