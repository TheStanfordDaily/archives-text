Tip for a perfectionist
who's anything but perfect!
E BOND
erases without a trace
Just because you make typing errors, you needn't make a spectacle of
them—not with Corrasable to cover up for you. This is the Eaton papef
with the like-magic surface that actually erases without a trace. Just a
flick of a pencil eraser and—presto disappear-o! Not a suspicion of a
smudge or smear.
Your favorite stationer/right in town, has Eaton's Corrasable in all
weights from onionskin to heavy weight bond, in handy 100-sheet packets
and thrifty 500-sheet ream boxes. It's fine quality paper, absolute tops
for typed assignments, theses—in fact, the kind you can be proud to
use for all your typed work. Backed by the famous Eaton name.
