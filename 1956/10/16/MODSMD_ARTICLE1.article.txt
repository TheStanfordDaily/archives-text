# Adlai Calls Ike Defeatist On H-Bomb
## Urges U.S. Continue Research Pending International Accord 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 15 (UP)—Ad
lai E. Stevenson promised tonight
that, if elected President, he
would attempt personally as his
"first order of business" to nego
tiate an agreement with Russia
and Great Britain to halt large
H-bomb tests by all atomic pow
ers.
He rejected as "defeatist" the
position of President Eisenhower
that national security dictates
continuation of the bomb tests by
the United States.
The Democratic Presidential
candidate warned that there is
"an instant necessity" for stop
ping the tests because the huge
nuclear explosions place the en
tire world in danger of deadly
human damage because of radio
active fallout.
Cites Reasons
• "The H-bomb is already so
powerful that a single bomb
could destroy the largest city in
the world.
• "The testing of an H-bomb
anywhere can tie quickly detect
ed. You can't hide the explosion
any more than you can hide an
earthquake. This means that if
any country broke .its pledge, we
would know and could promptly
resume our own testing.
• "These tests themselves may
cause the human race unmeas
ured damage.
• "One principal reason for
world danger was the possibility
that "a maniac, another Hitler,
might get the hydrogen bomb."
Proposed Last April
He pointed out to a nationwide
television and radio audience that
he proposed last April that the
United States take the initiative
by announcing its willingness to
stop the H-bomb tests.
"Since that time," Stevenson
said in a definitive, detailed out
line of his position, which is un
der attack by the Republicans,
"both Russia and Great Britain
have declared their willingness to
.join us in trying to establish the
kind of policy I have suggested."
"What are we waiting for?" he
asked.
First Order of Business
"Therefore, if elected President
I would count it the first order of
business to follow up on the op
portunity presented now by the
other atomic powers. I would do
this by conference or by consul
tation — at whatever level — at
whatever place — the circum
stances might suggest would be
most fruitful."
In the meantime, he said, the
United States should proceed both
with the production of hydrogen
weapons and with further re
search "frankly because bitter ex
perience has proved that we can
not rely even on the firm agree
ment of one bloc of world pow
ers."
"There is little danger to na
tional security involved because
if another power conducts fur
ther tests we would know it, and
as I have said, would have no
choice but to resume such tests
ourselves," Stevenson said.

choice but to resume such tests
ourselves," Stevenson said.
CHICAGO, Oct. 15 (UP)—Ad
lai E. Stevenson promised tonight
that, if elected President, he
would attempt personally as his
"first order of business" to nego
tiate an agreement with Russia
and Great Britain to halt large
H-bomb tests by all atomic pow
ers.
He rejected as "defeatist" the
position of President Eisenhower
that national security dictates
continuation of the bomb tests by
the United States.
The Democratic Presidential
candidate warned that there is
"an instant necessity" for stop
ping the tests because the huge
nuclear explosions place the en
tire world in danger of deadly
human damage because of radio
active fallout.
Cites Reasons
• "The H-bomb is already so
powerful that a single bomb
could destroy the largest city in
the world.
• "The testing of an H-bomb
anywhere can tie quickly detect
ed. You can't hide the explosion
any more than you can hide an
earthquake. This means that if
any country broke .its pledge, we
would know and could promptly
resume our own testing.
• "These tests themselves may
cause the human race unmeas
ured damage.
• "One principal reason for
world danger was the possibility
that "a maniac, another Hitler,
might get the hydrogen bomb."
Proposed Last April
He pointed out to a nationwide
television and radio audience that
he proposed last April that the
United States take the initiative
by announcing its willingness to
stop the H-bomb tests.
"Since that time," Stevenson
said in a definitive, detailed out
line of his position, which is un
der attack by the Republicans,
"both Russia and Great Britain
have declared their willingness to
.join us in trying to establish the
kind of policy I have suggested."
"What are we waiting for?" he
asked.
First Order of Business
"Therefore, if elected President
I would count it the first order of
business to follow up on the op
portunity presented now by the
other atomic powers. I would do
this by conference or by consul
tation — at whatever level — at
whatever place — the circum
stances might suggest would be
most fruitful."
In the meantime, he said, the
United States should proceed both
with the production of hydrogen
weapons and with further re
search "frankly because bitter ex
perience has proved that we can
not rely even on the firm agree
ment of one bloc of world pow
ers."
"There is little danger to na
tional security involved because
if another power conducts fur
ther tests we would know it, and
as I have said, would have no
choice but to resume such tests
ourselves," Stevenson said.
