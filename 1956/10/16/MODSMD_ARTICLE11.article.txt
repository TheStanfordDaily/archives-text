# KZSU Announcer Circulates Petition In Favor of Lower Age for Alcohol Consumption
## Downton Plans to Send Petition To All California Colleges 'All-Out Drive’ for Signatures Starts Tomorrow With Personal Contact in Dorms 
### 
Lloyd Downton, Stanford graduate student, is planning to circulate
a state wide college petition, addressed to the state legislature, calling
lor the lowering of the legal beer-wine drinking age to 18.
The move was begun Sunday night over his KZSU news com
mentaiy piogiam. He plans to begin an all-out drive tomorrow

combing (he dormitories and
mailing mimeographed copies of
the petition to all colleges in Cali
fornia.
"Not only do I want 18-year-olds
to drink," he said, "but, through
the media of petitions, I want to
prove that, student opinion is a
force in our present-day society.
There should be a powerful force
in the number of students attend
ing our state colleges and univer
sities.
Panty Raids and Football
"Normally the public thinks
American colleges good for but
two things—panty raids and foot
ball demonstrations. In Europe
and South America students are
a distinct political force whose
opinions are valued and given
careful consideration. Here is our
chance to prove we are capable
of this also."
Downton expressed himself as
dissatisfied with the student re
action to the petition, which is
now hanging in the KZSU office.
"They say they are all for 18-
year-olds drinking," he said, "but
they want the other guy to sign it.
They're afraid of what their par
ents or the administration might
do if they sign it.
Can They Vote?
"A day ago I was for 18-year
olds voting, but if the students
don't have enough courage to par
ticipate in the petition, then I have
my doubts whether they can
shoulder the responsibility to
vote."
Downton does not plan to ask
for Legislature endorsement until
after a sufficient number of peti
tions have been signed.
He thinks that 2000 signatures
can be obtained at Stanford with
proper organization. "I think we
will go far at other colleges," he
said. "The editor of the Univer
sity of San Francisco Foghorn has
assured me that student response
to the petition at USF will be
heavy."
Five Reasons
Downton lists five reasons why
he thinks 18-year-olds should be
allowed to drink been- or wine:
• "If men are old enough to be
drafted—old enough to wear the
uniform of their country and old
enough to be sent overseas to die
—then they are old enough to buy
a beer when they want one.
• "The sociological structure of
society today has created a dis
tinct need for minors to have
some place to meet, to go, to enjoy
themselves. Movies and dance
halls are not sufficient entertain
ment for today's youth.
• "Eighteen-year-olds are taxed
by the government as heavily as
80-year-olds.
• "Some states have this law in
operation now with no grave con
sequences.
• "College students who are 18
carry the same study load and
the same responsibility as those
who are over 21."
Social Pressure
He adds that "social pressure is
such that it is embarrassing for
a student not to be able to have
beer or wine when he goes out to
dinner on a date. They'll get it
anyway, so this will eliminate a
problem."
Downton said his move was
started by the Daily editorial of
Oct. 8 which came out for lower
ing the beer-wine drinking age
to 18.
He has asked for volunteers
who wish to help him in circulat
ing the petitions to contact him at
KZSU or leave their names in his
KZSU box.
Downton made headlines last
spring with a false KZSU broad
cast of radiation fallout in San
Francisco following a govern
ment H-bomb test in the Pacific.

petitions will he circulated at colleges all over the state and then
sent to the state legislature. —Daily Photo by George Wyse
Lloyd Downton, Stanford graduate student, is planning to circulate
a state wide college petition, addressed to the state legislature, calling
lor the lowering of the legal beer-wine drinking age to 18.
The move was begun Sunday night over his KZSU news com
mentaiy piogiam. He plans to begin an all-out drive tomorrow

combing (he dormitories and
mailing mimeographed copies of
the petition to all colleges in Cali
fornia.
"Not only do I want 18-year-olds
to drink," he said, "but, through
the media of petitions, I want to
prove that, student opinion is a
force in our present-day society.
There should be a powerful force
in the number of students attend
ing our state colleges and univer
sities.
Panty Raids and Football
"Normally the public thinks
American colleges good for but
two things—panty raids and foot
ball demonstrations. In Europe
and South America students are
a distinct political force whose
opinions are valued and given
careful consideration. Here is our
chance to prove we are capable
of this also."
Downton expressed himself as
dissatisfied with the student re
action to the petition, which is
now hanging in the KZSU office.
"They say they are all for 18-
year-olds drinking," he said, "but
they want the other guy to sign it.
They're afraid of what their par
ents or the administration might
do if they sign it.
Can They Vote?
"A day ago I was for 18-year
olds voting, but if the students
don't have enough courage to par
ticipate in the petition, then I have
my doubts whether they can
shoulder the responsibility to
vote."
Downton does not plan to ask
for Legislature endorsement until
after a sufficient number of peti
tions have been signed.
He thinks that 2000 signatures
can be obtained at Stanford with
proper organization. "I think we
will go far at other colleges," he
said. "The editor of the Univer
sity of San Francisco Foghorn has
assured me that student response
to the petition at USF will be
heavy."
Five Reasons
Downton lists five reasons why
he thinks 18-year-olds should be
allowed to drink been- or wine:
• "If men are old enough to be
drafted—old enough to wear the
uniform of their country and old
enough to be sent overseas to die
—then they are old enough to buy
a beer when they want one.
• "The sociological structure of
society today has created a dis
tinct need for minors to have
some place to meet, to go, to enjoy
themselves. Movies and dance
halls are not sufficient entertain
ment for today's youth.
• "Eighteen-year-olds are taxed
by the government as heavily as
80-year-olds.

olds voting, but if the students
don't have enough courage to par
ticipate in the petition, then I have
my doubts whether they can
shoulder the responsibility to
vote."
Downton does not plan to ask
for Legislature endorsement until
after a sufficient number of peti
tions have been signed.
He thinks that 2000 signatures
can be obtained at Stanford with
proper organization. "I think we
will go far at other colleges," he
said. "The editor of the Univer
sity of San Francisco Foghorn has
assured me that student response
to the petition at USF will be
heavy."
Five Reasons
Downton lists five reasons why
he thinks 18-year-olds should be
allowed to drink been- or wine:
• "If men are old enough to be
drafted—old enough to wear the
uniform of their country and old
enough to be sent overseas to die
—then they are old enough to buy
a beer when they want one.
• "The sociological structure of
society today has created a dis
tinct need for minors to have
some place to meet, to go, to enjoy
themselves. Movies and dance
halls are not sufficient entertain
ment for today's youth.
• "Eighteen-year-olds are taxed
by the government as heavily as
80-year-olds.
• "Some states have this law in
operation now with no grave con
sequences.
• "College students who are 18
carry the same study load and
the same responsibility as those
who are over 21."
Social Pressure
He adds that "social pressure is
such that it is embarrassing for
a student not to be able to have
beer or wine when he goes out to
dinner on a date. They'll get it
anyway, so this will eliminate a
problem."
Downton said his move was
started by the Daily editorial of
Oct. 8 which came out for lower
ing the beer-wine drinking age
to 18.
He has asked for volunteers
who wish to help him in circulat
ing the petitions to contact him at
KZSU or leave their names in his
KZSU box.
Downton made headlines last
spring with a false KZSU broad
cast of radiation fallout in San
Francisco following a govern
ment H-bomb test in the Pacific.
