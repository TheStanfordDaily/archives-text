# Dulles Weakened NATO, Says Kefauver in Vermont Speech
## Nixon Claims Labor Income Higher Under Ike Than in Any Other Peacetime Year 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 15 (UP)â€”Sen. Estes Kefauver said today that
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles "is like a man who lights a
fire for the pleasure of putting it out."
The Democratic vice-presidential nominee said that maneuvering
by Dulles in the world arena has weakened the North Atlantic Treaty

Organization and driven Britain
and France to think "deep
thoughts about n European alli
ance which would be independent
of us."
The Tennessee Democrat, upon
arriving here on his campaign
tour, also continued his attack on
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon,
whom he called "no friend of the
business man," in a speech earlier
today during a stumping tour of
Vermont.
Kefauver said the primary
question in the current campaign
is peace, but one-or the gravest
issues is whether the people of
the United States want to "trust
their desliny" to Nixon. The re
election of President Eisenhower,
he said, would make Nixon the
"man of destiny in Ihe Republi
can party and in the government
of the United States."
Meanwhile, in Youngstowi, 0.,
Vice-President Nixon said today
labor's share of the national in
come is higher under President
Eisenhower than in any other
peacelimc year.
He predicted that the GOP will
get a greater percentage of labor's
vote than it did in 1052.
. In a long, hard-hitting day of
barnstorming through industrial
Ohio, Nixon talked confidently of
victory and said the Republican
party's campaign "is on the up
grade" while the Democrats are
going downhill. Me made appear
