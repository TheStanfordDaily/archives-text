# Freelen Talks On Minor Law, Food, His Duty
## 
### 
ASSU President Bob Freelen
yesterday answered questions of
the Off-campus Men on such sub
jects as the liquor law, the ASSU
president's duties and Cellar
food.
Answering queries put to him
on the third floor of the Women's
Clubhouse, Freelen admitted, "A
move to get the liquor law
changed in an election year isn't
feasible. Politicians don't want
to stick their necks out in an elec
tion year."
The student leader suggested
students work through labor un
ion lobbyists and their parents to
lower the liquor age to 18. "I
have come from pretty close to
New York State, which serves
liquor at 18, and so I have had a
liberal education," Freelen quip
ped.
Commenting on graduate stu
dent Lloyd Downton's effort to
acquire 2000 Stanford signatures
to a petition for lowering the lim
it, the ASSU president declared,
"I think that probably could be
done in a hurry."
The misdemeanor of under age
drinking is slight, Freelen grain
ed. "But the consequences are
great."
On Cellar food, Freelen was
frank. "What they serve up isn't
appetizing and the prices aren't in
correlation with what you get."
Plans to improve this situation
include setting up a sandwich bar
run by the ASSU.
Regarding his duties as presi
dent, Freelen reminded students
that Legislature meetings are
open to the public and the door
to his office is always open.
"So far," he happily reported,
"I've had several freshmen in the
office asking questions."
