# Fraternitiesâ€”-What to Do?
## 
### 
If you arf. interested in becoming a man,
many think the thing to do on this campus
is to join a fraternity. In the early part of
winter quarter the 24 fraternities at Stanford
will start a proceeding known as "rushing."
The fraternities will hold open houses for
all interested men, where fliey will be on their
good behavior with the idea in mind of getting
these persons to pledge their particular fra
ternity.
I here has been a growing tendency for the
interested person to "de-pledge" the fraternity
after informal rushing stops and formal rush
ing begins.
W by is this?
We have talked to persons who de-pledged,
and the opinions expressed can be summed up
thus: During formal rushing and the period
following, the fraternity brothers seem to leave
their "good behavior" behind. The opinion
was further expressed that some of the brothers
showed a "lalse quality of mind" during in
formal rushing.
Be that as it may, we feel that something
should be done to improve all aspects of 1 fra
ternity life at Stanford. Almost any fraternity
man will tell you that that is a problem to be
solved by the fraternity and is nobody's busi
ness but their own.
We contend that it is somebody else's busi
ness. \\ hat the fraternities do on this campus
reflects on 1 lie name and reputation of the
University.
In past years some of the fraternities' actions
were unsavory, to say the least.
We have investigate*.' souie of the fraternities 1
practices, especially regarding "Hell Week."
We commend such fraternities as Phi Gamma
I'elta for the tremendous improvement they
ha\ e shown in the past couple of years in regard
to Hell Week practices. This year the Fijis
are planning to do something for the Univer
sity to replace their Hell Week. We under
stand they have applied for permission to finish
painting the temporary buildings.
I'hi Kappa Sigma went down Embarcadero
lioad in I'alo Alto last I hursday and worked
all afternoon cleaning up a particularly trash
filled section of the street. They are also plan
ning to do something constructive for the Uni
versity and for their own house.
liii Kappa Psi is planning to work for a
week improving the physical setup of their
house and hold Hell Week for one day only.
I liese are not the only fraternities showing
a "new look. This kind of improvement is

happily showing; up in most of the Stanford
fraternities. Unfortunately, it <loes not hold
true for all.
There are still a number of fraternities hold
ing the theory that a person can't he properly
initiated without subjecting him to degrading,
and sometimes sadistic or even perverted, prac
tices.
A great number of pledges go through this
type of hazing with the mistaken notion that
they must do so to become a "man."
It need hardly be pointed out that this is a
false notion. When a person loses his dignity
he can hardly be classed among "men."
What can he done about the few fraternities
that still engage in such practices? What is
being done?
Interfraternity Council is working with the
fraternities to help them change the concept
ol Hell Week to something constructive.
In the words of Spike Wilson, head of IFC:
"Any living group of a community must
aecept the responsibilities of certain contribu
tions expected of it. Whether dormitories, fra
ternities or clubs, this responsibility evolves
in two forms.
" I he foremost concerns that contribution of
the living group's own development, as an in
direct benefit to a community. The secondary
form is that of a direct contribution, usually in
the lorm of various service projects.
"Although the Interfraternity Council is cur
rently concerned much more with the foremost
of the two, it recognizes that both forms of
eontribution frequently supplement each other.
Consequently, it encourages community service
projects both 011 campus and in Palo Alto.
"In line with this, the IFC judicial body is
now abandoning the negative and outmoded
hour-penalty system and is adopting the com
munity-job type ol penalty code under which
delinquent traternities may be assigned specific
* jobs as punishment.
"We feel that such projects, especially if
voluntary, can have a positive effect upon both
the fraternity concerned and the community
itself."
Creat improvement has been shown, but,
unless the fraternities caifc show this improve
ment to be campus-wide, we feel the fraterni
ties will eventually go the way of the sororities.
I his would be unfortunate, because we feel
there is a lot to be gained by fraternity life on
this campus. And there is no end to the good
a fraternity or a combination of 112 raternities can
do lor a community, a college or themselves,
if they are willing to work at it.

Creat improvement has been shown, but,

If you arf. interested in becoming a man,
many think the thing to do on this campus
is to join a fraternity. In the early part of
winter quarter the 24 fraternities at Stanford
will start a proceeding known as "rushing."
The fraternities will hold open houses for
all interested men, where fliey will be on their
good behavior with the idea in mind of getting
these persons to pledge their particular fra
ternity.
I here has been a growing tendency for the
interested person to "de-pledge" the fraternity
after informal rushing stops and formal rush
ing begins.
W by is this?
We have talked to persons who de-pledged,
and the opinions expressed can be summed up
thus: During formal rushing and the period
following, the fraternity brothers seem to leave
their "good behavior" behind. The opinion
was further expressed that some of the brothers
showed a "lalse quality of mind" during in
formal rushing.
Be that as it may, we feel that something
should be done to improve all aspects of 1 fra
ternity life at Stanford. Almost any fraternity
man will tell you that that is a problem to be
solved by the fraternity and is nobody's busi
ness but their own.
We contend that it is somebody else's busi
ness. \\ hat the fraternities do on this campus
reflects on 1 lie name and reputation of the
University.
In past years some of the fraternities' actions
were unsavory, to say the least.
We have investigate*.' souie of the fraternities 1
practices, especially regarding "Hell Week."
We commend such fraternities as Phi Gamma
I'elta for the tremendous improvement they
ha\ e shown in the past couple of years in regard
to Hell Week practices. This year the Fijis
are planning to do something for the Univer
sity to replace their Hell Week. We under
stand they have applied for permission to finish
painting the temporary buildings.
I'hi Kappa Sigma went down Embarcadero
lioad in I'alo Alto last I hursday and worked
all afternoon cleaning up a particularly trash
filled section of the street. They are also plan

liii Kappa Psi is planning to work for a
week improving the physical setup of their
house and hold Hell Week for one day only.
I liese are not the only fraternities showing
a "new look. This kind of improvement is

happily showing; up in most of the Stanford
fraternities. Unfortunately, it <loes not hold
true for all.
There are still a number of fraternities hold
ing the theory that a person can't he properly
initiated without subjecting him to degrading,
and sometimes sadistic or even perverted, prac
tices.
A great number of pledges go through this
type of hazing with the mistaken notion that
they must do so to become a "man."
It need hardly be pointed out that this is a
false notion. When a person loses his dignity
he can hardly be classed among "men."
What can he done about the few fraternities
that still engage in such practices? What is
being done?
Interfraternity Council is working with the
fraternities to help them change the concept
ol Hell Week to something constructive.

fraternities. Unfortunately, it <loes not hold
true for all.
There are still a number of fraternities hold
ing the theory that a person can't he properly
initiated without subjecting him to degrading,
and sometimes sadistic or even perverted, prac
tices.
A great number of pledges go through this
type of hazing with the mistaken notion that
they must do so to become a "man."
It need hardly be pointed out that this is a
false notion. When a person loses his dignity
he can hardly be classed among "men."
What can he done about the few fraternities
that still engage in such practices? What is
being done?
Interfraternity Council is working with the
fraternities to help them change the concept
ol Hell Week to something constructive.
In the words of Spike Wilson, head of IFC:
"Any living group of a community must
aecept the responsibilities of certain contribu
tions expected of it. Whether dormitories, fra
ternities or clubs, this responsibility evolves
in two forms.
" I he foremost concerns that contribution of
the living group's own development, as an in
direct benefit to a community. The secondary
form is that of a direct contribution, usually in
the lorm of various service projects.
"Although the Interfraternity Council is cur
rently concerned much more with the foremost
of the two, it recognizes that both forms of
eontribution frequently supplement each other.
Consequently, it encourages community service
projects both 011 campus and in Palo Alto.
"In line with this, the IFC judicial body is
now abandoning the negative and outmoded
hour-penalty system and is adopting the com
munity-job type ol penalty code under which
delinquent traternities may be assigned specific
* jobs as punishment.
"We feel that such projects, especially if
voluntary, can have a positive effect upon both
the fraternity concerned and the community
itself."
Creat improvement has been shown, but,
unless the fraternities caifc show this improve
ment to be campus-wide, we feel the fraterni
ties will eventually go the way of the sororities.
I his would be unfortunate, because we feel
there is a lot to be gained by fraternity life on
this campus. And there is no end to the good
a fraternity or a combination of 112 raternities can
do lor a community, a college or themselves,
if they are willing to work at it.
If you arf. interested in becoming a man,
many think the thing to do on this campus
is to join a fraternity. In the early part of
winter quarter the 24 fraternities at Stanford
will start a proceeding known as "rushing."
The fraternities will hold open houses for
all interested men, where fliey will be on their
good behavior with the idea in mind of getting
these persons to pledge their particular fra
ternity.
I here has been a growing tendency for the
interested person to "de-pledge" the fraternity
after informal rushing stops and formal rush
ing begins.
W by is this?
We have talked to persons who de-pledged,
and the opinions expressed can be summed up
thus: During formal rushing and the period
following, the fraternity brothers seem to leave
their "good behavior" behind. The opinion
was further expressed that some of the brothers
showed a "lalse quality of mind" during in
formal rushing.
Be that as it may, we feel that something
should be done to improve all aspects of 1 fra
ternity life at Stanford. Almost any fraternity
man will tell you that that is a problem to be
solved by the fraternity and is nobody's busi
ness but their own.
We contend that it is somebody else's busi
ness. \\ hat the fraternities do on this campus
reflects on 1 lie name and reputation of the
University.
In past years some of the fraternities' actions
were unsavory, to say the least.
We have investigate*.' souie of the fraternities 1
practices, especially regarding "Hell Week."
We commend such fraternities as Phi Gamma
I'elta for the tremendous improvement they
ha\ e shown in the past couple of years in regard
to Hell Week practices. This year the Fijis
are planning to do something for the Univer
sity to replace their Hell Week. We under
stand they have applied for permission to finish
painting the temporary buildings.
I'hi Kappa Sigma went down Embarcadero
lioad in I'alo Alto last I hursday and worked
all afternoon cleaning up a particularly trash
filled section of the street. They are also plan
ning to do something constructive for the Uni
versity and for their own house.
liii Kappa Psi is planning to work for a
week improving the physical setup of their
house and hold Hell Week for one day only.
