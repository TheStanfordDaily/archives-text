and polls are finding their way into campus
newspapers.

conducted its own poll of 247 college news
paper editors. Of this number, 190—or 77 pet
cent —predicted an Eisenhower victory in No
vember. Yet 158 of the editors answered yes
to the question "IT ill Nixon hinder Eisenhower
in his campaign?'"
An overwhelming majority of those students
polled believed that Adlai Stevenson was the
hest choice of a candidate available to the
Democratic party. Some felt that kefauver or
Stuart Symington should have won the nomi
nation.
Eisenhower s greatest support seemed to
come from the West, Southwest and Midwest,
while Stevenson showed the most strength sta
tistically in the Northeast, usually, a lie publi
