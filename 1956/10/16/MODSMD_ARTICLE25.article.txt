# Alpine Club Members Scale Glacier Point at Yosemite
## 
### 
Grappling-with nature at per-,
haps its most adverse, three Al'
pine Club members last weekend
scaled the rocky face of Yosemite
National Park's Glacier Point.
Hie remaining club members
participated in less nerve-wrack
ing climbs and acted as a support
party for the Glacier Point crew.
After camping out in Yosemite
Saturday night, the Alpine Club
party returned on Sunday to
Stanford.
Founded in 1957
Alpine Club's history of hair
raising hikes dates back to the
founding year of 1917. Thirty
four Farm inhabitants joined the
club that year, led by President
Larry Taylor and ace "human
mountain goats" Al Baxter and
liud Gales.
Gales and Baxter became Ihe
first Alpine Clubbers to risk their
lives when they made the organi
zation's first Yosemite climb.
Other highlights in the group's
ten-year history include ascents
of such perilous peaks as Black
Kock, Devil's Slide and the Wash
inglon Column in Yosemite. They
have also made some of wind
swept British Columbia's tough
est climbs.
Two Types of Members
Besides heart stopping climbs
of the rope - and - piton variety,
members also hike on gentler
slopes.
Two classes of members belong
to the club unofficial and offi

cial. Unofficial members are stu
dents who participate in outings
such as last weekend's Yosemite
trip but are not allowed to at
tempt more strenuous climbs.
Official members have passed
the club's rigorous qualifying
tests. Included in the exams are
such stunts as rapelling 120 feet
down the sheer face of a cliff,
rope climbing with two other per
sons and scaling a cliff with the
aid of pitons and rope slings.
Under the direction this year of
President John llarlin, Alpine
Club meets.Sundays for warm up
climbs in the Bay Area.
