# Iraq to Give Jordan Aid In Event of Israeli Attack
## Presence of Troops Threatens Israel, Says Premier Ben-Gurion 
### 
JERUSALEM, Israeli Sector, Oct. 15 (UP) Jordan and Iraq con
cluded a formal agreement today providing that Iraqi troops sta
tioned on the border will come to the aid of Jordan in the event of
Israeli attack.
The agreement, reached in Amman, Jordan, was announced after

Israeli Premier David Ben-Gurion
warned that Israel would consid
er any such movement of Iraqi
troops as "cause for action."
The Jordan-Iraqi accord, how
ever, did not call for bringing
troops into Jordan at the present
time in the absence of an Israeli
attack.
Stability
Despite British insistence that
movement of well - trained Iraqi
troops into Jordan would contrib
ute to the "re-establishment of
stability in the area," Ben-Gurion
said that even the presence of
such troops on Jordan's Arab
borders away from Israel would
threaten Israeli security.
Tension between Israel and
Jordan was at a peak as Ben-
Gurion spoke.
At the United Nations in New
York, Jordan requested the Secu
rity Council to consider Israeli at
tacks on the border. The Council
was expected to meet tomorrow
to consider the complaint.
Jordan-Iraq Agree
A Jordanian spokesman in Am
man said King Hussein and an
Iraqi delegation came to agree
ment in a final three-hour meet
ing. Under the agreement, Iraqi
troops will be massed at the bor
der ready for action in the event
of an Israeli attack on Jordan.
The troops will be supported by
jet aircraft.
There has been considerable op
position to bringing Iraqi troops
into Jordan, particularly from
anti - Western and pro - Egyptian
officials. Iraq, a member of the
Baghdad Pact, is pro-Western, al
though it never has signed a
peace treaty with Israel.


IRAQ TO All) JORDAN — British officials favor sending Iraqi
troops from Iraq (2) into Jordan (1). Rumors were reported in
Tel Aviv, Israel, that the United States also favored such action.
Though unconfirmed from Washington, informed sources said the
troop movement was "quite likely." —NKA Tele-foto
