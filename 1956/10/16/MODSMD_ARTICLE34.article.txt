# Indians Start Basketball Practice, 35 Men Report
## Experience Problem Faces Coach Dallmar: San Jose State First Opponent on Nov. 30 
### 
While most sports fans are still getting used to the idea that foot
ball season is in bloom, Stanford's basketball coach Howie Dallmar
is already whipping into shape the Indian cage fortunes.
Yesterday Dallmar called together 35 varsity candidates to begin
practice for the 19 )6-57 casaba season which opens with a warm-up

tilt against San Jose State on
Nov. 30 at San Jose.
And he has his problems.
Only two lettermen reported
for the initial hoop-warming ses
sion in the Pavilion: captain Hap
Wagner and net ace Bill Bond-
Others Play Football
Twfj others, Carl Isaacs and
Gary Van Galder, are playing
football and won't check in on the
hardwoods' until after Big Game.
With only two other non-letter
men from last year's team re
turning—Clint Waring and Bep
po Dyer- Dallmar laces the prob
lem of experienced depth.
A tall, 0-7 junior college trans
fer named Lee Leonard and a
couple »of 6-4 sophomores Rich
ard Haga and Jack Caple—may
add necessary height to the
squad. Waring is also 6-4.
Newman Twists Ankle
John Newman, up from the
frosh team, reported yesterday
with a twisted ankle and worked
out at the free-throw line. An
other top prospect from the frosh
squad is John Pflueger.
Dallmar looks forward to hav
ing "a good, strong team" in
what he terms a "very strong
conference." Top competition will
come from Oregon State, Cal and
UCLA, with Washington an un
known factor if it holds out its
star hook-artist Bruno Boin.
"Defensively we sure will miss
Barry Brown and George Selleck.
Without a tall, able player like
Brown on the boards, we'll prob
ably have to shift our pressing
defense strategy this year," Dall
mar said.
Robinson to Report
Ben Robinson, Stanford var
sity footballer, will also report
later on along with Isaacs and
Van Galder. Of course a Rose
Bowl trip for the gridders would
put a crimp into Dallmar's De
cember and early January games.
Dallmar rests his hopes on the
promising sophomores to fill in
the gaps around sharp-shooter
Bond, floor - master Wagner, Is
aacs and Van Galder.
"I won't say we'll be contend
ers this year," Dallmar concludes,
"but, we'll be in there fighting all
the way."

come from Oregon State, Cal and
UCLA, with Washington an un
known factor if it holds out its
star hook-artist Bruno Boin.
"Defensively we sure will miss
Barry Brown and George Selleck.
Without a tall, able player like
Brown on the boards, we'll prob
ably have to shift our pressing
defense strategy this year," Dall
mar said.
Robinson to Report
Ben Robinson, Stanford var
sity footballer, will also report
later on along with Isaacs and
Van Galder. Of course a Rose
Bowl trip for the gridders would
put a crimp into Dallmar's De
cember and early January games.
Dallmar rests his hopes on the
promising sophomores to fill in
the gaps around sharp-shooter
Bond, floor - master Wagner, Is
aacs and Van Galder.
"I won't say we'll be contend
ers this year," Dallmar concludes,
"but, we'll be in there fighting all
the way."


HOWIE DALLMAR
Problem of Experience
While most sports fans are still getting used to the idea that foot
ball season is in bloom, Stanford's basketball coach Howie Dallmar
is already whipping into shape the Indian cage fortunes.
Yesterday Dallmar called together 35 varsity candidates to begin
practice for the 19 )6-57 casaba season which opens with a warm-up

tilt against San Jose State on
Nov. 30 at San Jose.
And he has his problems.
Only two lettermen reported
for the initial hoop-warming ses
sion in the Pavilion: captain Hap
Wagner and net ace Bill Bond-
Others Play Football
Twfj others, Carl Isaacs and
Gary Van Galder, are playing
football and won't check in on the
hardwoods' until after Big Game.
With only two other non-letter
men from last year's team re
turning—Clint Waring and Bep
po Dyer- Dallmar laces the prob
lem of experienced depth.
A tall, 0-7 junior college trans
fer named Lee Leonard and a
couple »of 6-4 sophomores Rich
ard Haga and Jack Caple—may
add necessary height to the
squad. Waring is also 6-4.
Newman Twists Ankle
John Newman, up from the
frosh team, reported yesterday
with a twisted ankle and worked
out at the free-throw line. An
other top prospect from the frosh
squad is John Pflueger.
Dallmar looks forward to hav
ing "a good, strong team" in
what he terms a "very strong
conference." Top competition will
come from Oregon State, Cal and
UCLA, with Washington an un
known factor if it holds out its
star hook-artist Bruno Boin.
