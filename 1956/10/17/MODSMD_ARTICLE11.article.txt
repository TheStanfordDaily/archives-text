â€” Chancellor Konrad Adenauer
reshuffled his cabinet today and
re-pledged West German alle
giance to the free West.
He fired four minisers includ
ing controversial Defense Minis
ter Theodor Blank.
Hut in a surprise last-minute
decision, Adenauer dropped his
plan to name Foreign Minister
Heinrich van Brentano his heir
apparent by naming him vice
chancellor.
By reducing the cabinet from
20 to Ifi members and eliminating
Blank. Adenauer sought to
strengthen his cabinet for the
1957 elections, which advisers
have warned his Christian Demo

Critics had contended the gov
ernment had too many ministers
with too little to do. They blamed
Blank for West Germany's slow
moving rearmament program.
