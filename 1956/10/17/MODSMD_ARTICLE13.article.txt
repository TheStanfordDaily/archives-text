## Defends Farm, Foreign Policy At Minneapolis Late Schedule Switch Adds California Stop To Vote-Seeking Trip 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS. Oct. 16 (UP)
—President Eisenhower today at
tacked the "anguished politicians"
who say his Administration has
forgotten the farmer and failed
to strive for world peace.
The President, starting his long
est campaign tour so far in his
bid for re election, issued a direct
retort to his opponent, Adlai E.
Stevenson, and other top Demo
crats.
He said the farmers are "over
'.he hump" and moving toward a
future and "we have ad
vanced a long way on -the road
toward a just and lasting peace."
In his closest reference to Ste
vVnson's speech last night urging
a halt to hydrogen bomb tests,
Eisenhower asked if "these poli
ticians" are blind to Administra
tion efforts to dedicate atomic
power to peace.
Cheering Crowds
Dense, cheering crowds met Eis
enhower and his wife here on the
first stop of an aerial swing that
will cover 5850 miles in five cru
cial states in five days.
The President stood bare-head
ed in an open White House limou
sine waving to the crowds which
lined the motorcade's 30 - mile
route. Police estimated 10,000 per
sons heard Eisenhower speak in
front of the federal building in
the twin city of St. Paul.
The President flew on to Se
attle, Wash., after his St. Paul-
Minneapolis speeches. He has
added vote-rich California to his
schedule at the last minute and
will spend the next three days
campaigning in the Far West. '
Opponents "Anguished
Eisenhower three times called
his Democratic opponents "an
guished" in his Minneapolis
speech. He added they are "no
doubt overly excited by the din
of a campaign."
"From what I've read of some
of their statements, I am sure
that if some of these men drove
a tractor like they talk, they
would have a mighty tough time
plowing a straight furrow."
The President, fighting hard to
retain the farm vote during the
last three weeks of the campaign,,
charged that it is not "straight
talk" to say the farmers would
be better off under Democratic
programs "that caused surpluses
to pile up and prices to go down."
The nation's farm economy was
seriously threatened when he took
office, the President said, but.
under his flexible price supports
policies "farm prices have started
back up without the economic
help of war."


LAST-MINUTE CONFERENCE — GOP Campaigner Eisenhowe.
and House Minority Leader Joseph Mart.n (K-Mass.) took place
in Washington yesterday just before Ike left for his longest speech
making tour of the political campaign. He will tour five Far
Western states, including California, in the next three days.
