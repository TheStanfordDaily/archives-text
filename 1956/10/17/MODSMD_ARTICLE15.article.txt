### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UP)—Republicans today assailed Adlai
E. Stevenson's H-bomb proposals as a "cruel hoax" on the voters and
"an invitation to national suicide."
But Democrats applauded Stevenson's promise to seek agreement
with Russia to halt the testing of hydrogen weapons if he is elected
President next month. | —

They said he had pointed up
the "incalculable dangers" of the
H-bomb and had demonstrated
the proper concern for this
"greatest challenge of our time.''
GOPs Criticize
Republican leaders from Presi
dent Eisenhower on down heaped
criticism on the Democratic can
didate's Monday night speech in
which he accused the President
of trying to brush the H-bomb
issue under the rug.
The President asked in a cam
paign talk at Minneapolis, Minn.,
whether "these politicians" were
blind to administration efforts to
dedicate atomic power to peace.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles told a news conference
that "if there is an effective way
to control and limit the use of
these bombs, we will find it."
Doubts Solution
Dulles said some of the de
tails of the problem "have to re
main to some extent confiden
tial." Consequently, ho said, "I
doubt very much if those who arc
not fully conversant" with the
situation as are well equipped as
Eisenhower to find a solution.
In a speech at Flint, Mich., for
mer Governor Thomas E. Dewey
of New York said Stevenson had
changed his proposal "five times
now and it still adds up to the
same. It is still an invitation to
national suicide."
Dewey said the nation "cannot
afford to endanger our atomic su
periority on the basis (if wishful
thinking or in a quest for politi
cal applause."
Representative W. Sterling
Cole (R-N.Y.), a member of the
Congressional Atomic Energy
Committee, called Stevenson's
proposal "a cruel and unjustified
hoax" and said he had done a
"tragic disservice" to national se
curity.
Dulles said Eisenhower and his
aides have been trying without
success for nearly three years to
work out a foolproof system of
H-bomb controls. He said he
doubted Stevenson could do any
better."
