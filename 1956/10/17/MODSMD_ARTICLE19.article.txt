# "You Keep Out of This"
## A 						Call to Action 
### 
One of the gravest criticisms leveled at Stan
ford's student legislature is that it shirks im
portant issues and concerns itself almost ex
clusively with trivia.
Many defenders of Legislature's history have
answered this criticism by saying that no issues
of significant value ever arise on this campus.
We have seen arise this year an issue to refute
this claim.
As we have said before, Legislature's history
need not always be bleak, for this university
has fine minds capable of delving into any
problem and coming up with wise and concrete
answers.
Such an opportunity for Stanford to make
a move in the right direction is offered by the
current underage drinking problem. Lloyd
Downton has taken the first step in the right
direction with his petition campaign, and
action by Legislature could compound the ef
fectiveness of this movement.
Legislature could, by resolution, recommend
to the state legislature in Sacramento that the
legal drinking age be lowered; it could also
turn the matter over to the students as a whole
in the form of" a campus-wide referendum. It
could—and this is not beyond the realm of
possibility — kick oil a state-wide university
movement against the present backward and
unrealistic law.
It could, but will it?

Four years ago such a proposal was defeated
by the students in referendum, and the matter
was dropped. Now the problem is as serious,
if not more serious, than ever, and access to
referendum or Legislature resolution is still
open.
Of course many will ask, "Is it proper for
Stanford to inject itself into a fight for liquor?"
Unfortunately, this question is not involved in
the niceties of "propriety," for every endeavor
that demands courage and conviction will heap
upon itself damning criticism from those com
placent souls who would rather cling to the
present than look to the future.
Furthermore, what could be more "proper"
than working for a more realistic, less hypo
critical law that affects every one of our age?
\ es, it would be much more pleasant, much
easier, to let some other university take up the
sword and lead the fight. But Stanford, by its
very nature as one of the outstanding univer
sities in the country, is in a position to act
forthrightly, not hypocritically, on this issue.
Tonight we expect Legislature to discuss the
immediate problem of banning all campus
functions that encourage violation of the
present law.
We urge that Legislature, under its full pre
rogative and responsibility, begin discussion of
the causes, as well as the symptoms, of the cur
rent liquor affliction.

rogative and responsibility, begin discussion of
the causes, as well as the symptoms, of the cur
rent liquor affliction.

One of the gravest criticisms leveled at Stan
ford's student legislature is that it shirks im
portant issues and concerns itself almost ex
clusively with trivia.
Many defenders of Legislature's history have
answered this criticism by saying that no issues
of significant value ever arise on this campus.
We have seen arise this year an issue to refute
this claim.
As we have said before, Legislature's history
need not always be bleak, for this university
has fine minds capable of delving into any
problem and coming up with wise and concrete
answers.
Such an opportunity for Stanford to make
a move in the right direction is offered by the
current underage drinking problem. Lloyd
Downton has taken the first step in the right
direction with his petition campaign, and
action by Legislature could compound the ef
fectiveness of this movement.
Legislature could, by resolution, recommend
to the state legislature in Sacramento that the
legal drinking age be lowered; it could also
turn the matter over to the students as a whole
in the form of" a campus-wide referendum. It
could—and this is not beyond the realm of
possibility — kick oil a state-wide university
movement against the present backward and
unrealistic law.
It could, but will it?

Four years ago such a proposal was defeated
by the students in referendum, and the matter
was dropped. Now the problem is as serious,
if not more serious, than ever, and access to
referendum or Legislature resolution is still
open.
Of course many will ask, "Is it proper for
Stanford to inject itself into a fight for liquor?"
Unfortunately, this question is not involved in
the niceties of "propriety," for every endeavor
that demands courage and conviction will heap
upon itself damning criticism from those com
placent souls who would rather cling to the
present than look to the future.
Furthermore, what could be more "proper"
than working for a more realistic, less hypo
critical law that affects every one of our age?
\ es, it would be much more pleasant, much
easier, to let some other university take up the
sword and lead the fight. But Stanford, by its
very nature as one of the outstanding univer
sities in the country, is in a position to act
forthrightly, not hypocritically, on this issue.
Tonight we expect Legislature to discuss the
immediate problem of banning all campus
functions that encourage violation of the
present law.
