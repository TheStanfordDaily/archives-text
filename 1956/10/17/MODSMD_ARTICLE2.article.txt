SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16
(UP)—A Pan American Strato
clipper crash - landed in the Pa
cific midway between Hawaii and
the mainland early today, pan
caking into the foamy wake of a
Coast Guard cutter which
promptly rescued all 31 persons
aboard.
The huge double-decked airliner
broke in two from the impact
with four-foot swells, but all
aboard, including eight women
and three children, were picked
up safely within 21 minutes.
The swift rescue was carried
out by the crew of the Coast
Guard weather ship Ponchartrain
which had been standing by with
its men at "ditch and rescue" sta
tions.
The plane, inbound from Tokyo
and Honolulu, was 1045 miles»off
the California coast—almost ex
actly at the point of no return
when two of its four engines
went out, one of them with its
propellor windmilling wildly.
The pilot, Captain Richad Ogg
of Saratoga, Calif., a veteran Pan-
Am skipper, made the decision to
ditch before dawn but kept his
crippled plane airborne for mote
than four hours as he dumped
fuel and waited for daybreak.
A Navy MATS plane, a second
Pan American flight and a Trans-
Ocean airliner hovered protective
ly around the stricken ship dur
ing the drama-packed waiting pe
riod before the landing.
