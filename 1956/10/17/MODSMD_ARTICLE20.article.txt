# Last Words Are Not Spoken

Adlai Stevenson's speech Monday night out
lining his ideas on the H-bomb threat restores
in some measure our faith in the potential
productivity of a political campaign.
Grappling onto a real issue shunned by his
opponent, Stevenson explained the demands
ol the present and the crucial necessities of
planning for the future.
No one can deny that his vivid description
of the 1 lorrors of an 11-honih holocaust and the
multiplying dangers of continued nuclear test
ing was a brilliant political stroke, and few will
deny that his speech had much of the dramatic
flavor of Eisenhower's "I will go to Korea"
statement in 1952.
But, more than that, it was one of the first
examples we have seen in tlie '56 campaign of
realistic thinking divorced from the semantic
ballyhoo of common campaign antics.
In answer to President Eisenhower's com
ment that he had "spoken his last words" on
the H-bomb issue last week, Stevenson said
there is one issue where there cannot be, there
must not he, a last word." This issue, he said,
is mankind's survival.
Stevenson's proposal was not an idle dream,
but one grounded firmly within the realm of
possibility. Cessation of American H-bomb
testing would be conditioned first on the agree

merit of other powers, and it would be condi
tioned on the understanding that, once another
power resumed testing, the United States would
be free to resume also.
Great Britain and Russia, lie said, have al
ready expressed willingness to join in such a
venture.
(hir own stockpiles of nuclear weapons would
still remain as a defensive safeguard, as would
those of other powers. It would only be the
potentially disastrous atom race that would
cease, for nuclear development cannot continue
at the pace it has been without testing, and this
testing, even in the wastes of Siberia, can be
detected by scientific devices.
During the past four years, this country has
made considerable progress in such domestic
fields as civil rights, social security and indus
trial development, but, although we have an
absence of war among the nations of the world,
it is doubtful we have anything approaching
real peace.
The United States has built up a reputation
for passivity; for reacting, but failing to act.
Should either Eisenhower or Stevenson, who
ever is elected in November, put this country
on record as offering to end its nuclear tests, a
bold step would have been taken toward a
more genuinely peaceful world.

But, more than that, it was one of the first
examples we have seen in tlie '56 campaign of
realistic thinking divorced from the semantic
ballyhoo of common campaign antics.
In answer to President Eisenhower's com
ment that he had "spoken his last words" on
the H-bomb issue last week, Stevenson said
there is one issue where there cannot be, there
must not he, a last word." This issue, he said,
is mankind's survival.
Stevenson's proposal was not an idle dream,
but one grounded firmly within the realm of
possibility. Cessation of American H-bomb
testing would be conditioned first on the agree

merit of other powers, and it would be condi
tioned on the understanding that, once another
power resumed testing, the United States would
be free to resume also.
Great Britain and Russia, lie said, have al
ready expressed willingness to join in such a
venture.
(hir own stockpiles of nuclear weapons would
still remain as a defensive safeguard, as would
those of other powers. It would only be the
potentially disastrous atom race that would
cease, for nuclear development cannot continue
at the pace it has been without testing, and this
testing, even in the wastes of Siberia, can be
detected by scientific devices.
During the past four years, this country has
made considerable progress in such domestic
fields as civil rights, social security and indus
trial development, but, although we have an
absence of war among the nations of the world,
it is doubtful we have anything approaching
real peace.
The United States has built up a reputation
for passivity; for reacting, but failing to act.
Should either Eisenhower or Stevenson, who
ever is elected in November, put this country
on record as offering to end its nuclear tests, a
bold step would have been taken toward a
more genuinely peaceful world.
Adlai Stevenson's speech Monday night out
lining his ideas on the H-bomb threat restores
in some measure our faith in the potential
productivity of a political campaign.
Grappling onto a real issue shunned by his
opponent, Stevenson explained the demands
ol the present and the crucial necessities of
planning for the future.
No one can deny that his vivid description
of the 1 lorrors of an 11-honih holocaust and the
multiplying dangers of continued nuclear test
ing was a brilliant political stroke, and few will
deny that his speech had much of the dramatic
flavor of Eisenhower's "I will go to Korea"
statement in 1952.
