11l Answer to Downton
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for the excellent coverage of crusader Lloyd Down
ton's noble effort to get the drinking age lowered. Downton's cause
may be a good one. However, he was clever enough in the article
to omit any good reasons that there might be for having the age
lowered.
Of his opening statement, "Normally the public thinks of Ameri
can colleges good for but two things, panty raids and football demon
strations.
If this is so, why are so many colleges able to be supported by
gifts and special funds from adults. Is the American trend toward
mass, organized fun now?
As to his other reasons:
• "If men are old enough to be drafted .. . it has been several
years since 18-year-olds were drafted. If he wants to use the draft
age as a drinking standard, he will find that the Selective Service
is drafting 23-year-olds now.
• "The sociological structure of today's society demands more
than movies and dance halls." Is he advocating saloons and taverns
for 18-year-olds?
• "Eighteen-year-olds are taxed as heavily as 80-year-olds." Con
gratulations; this is true, but so are 15- and 16-year-olds if they
earn the money.
• "Some states sell liquor to 18-year-olds with no grave conse
quences." What is a grave consequence? lie certainly avoided say
ing anything here.
• "College students who are 18 cany the same load as those who
are 21." Downton's reason for believing this may stem from the fact
that he is still carrying an 18-year-old responsibility load. Most 21-
year-olds would be very indignant over such a thought.
He says that "social pressure makes it embarrassing not to be
able to have beer or wine at dinner time." Then he says "they will
get it anyway." If they can "get it anyway," why is it embarrassing?
• Downton also might try to get the driving age lowered to 12
while he is soft-soaping the Legislature with his eloquent plea.
(They can see over the wheel!)
This issue has merit and deserves serious thinking. It is possible
that we would be better off with an 18-year-old minimum.
If it is, a more logical approach could be tried.

that he is still carrying an 18-year-old responsibility load. Most 21-
year-olds would be very indignant over such a thought.
He says that "social pressure makes it embarrassing not to be
able to have beer or wine at dinner time." Then he says "they will
get it anyway." If they can "get it anyway," why is it embarrassing?
• Downton also might try to get the driving age lowered to 12
while he is soft-soaping the Legislature with his eloquent plea.
(They can see over the wheel!)
This issue has merit and deserves serious thinking. It is possible
that we would be better off with an 18-year-old minimum.
If it is, a more logical approach could be tried.

11l Answer to Downton
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for the excellent coverage of crusader Lloyd Down
ton's noble effort to get the drinking age lowered. Downton's cause
may be a good one. However, he was clever enough in the article
to omit any good reasons that there might be for having the age
lowered.
Of his opening statement, "Normally the public thinks of Ameri
can colleges good for but two things, panty raids and football demon
strations.
If this is so, why are so many colleges able to be supported by
gifts and special funds from adults. Is the American trend toward
mass, organized fun now?
As to his other reasons:
• "If men are old enough to be drafted .. . it has been several
years since 18-year-olds were drafted. If he wants to use the draft
age as a drinking standard, he will find that the Selective Service
is drafting 23-year-olds now.
• "The sociological structure of today's society demands more
than movies and dance halls." Is he advocating saloons and taverns
for 18-year-olds?
• "Eighteen-year-olds are taxed as heavily as 80-year-olds." Con
gratulations; this is true, but so are 15- and 16-year-olds if they
earn the money.
• "Some states sell liquor to 18-year-olds with no grave conse
quences." What is a grave consequence? lie certainly avoided say
ing anything here.
• "College students who are 18 cany the same load as those who
are 21." Downton's reason for believing this may stem from the fact
that he is still carrying an 18-year-old responsibility load. Most 21-
year-olds would be very indignant over such a thought.
