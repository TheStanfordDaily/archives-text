Gridiron devotees this season have been able to follow Farm
football fortunes by the Monday-morning comments of a certain
Stanford professor in his 11 o'clock lecture class.
After the Washington State field-warming, the professor quipped,
"Some of you may regard Stanford as just a pleasant stopping-off
place between home and the Rose Bowl."
But his Monclay-morning cheer had diminished somewhat by the
next week: "Stanford may have lost but no one pan say we did not
fight them with 'Brodie and soul.' "
The 3000-mile, 12-point loss to Ohio State's Buckeyes elicited from
the pedagogue this plain but succinct statement of the "Pasadena
Blues": "The road to the Rose Bowl appears to have a few thorns."
And this Monday, after what Chuck Taylor called "by far our
poorest game to date," the professor had no comment. He didn't
even show up for class.
Whether the pedant will feel like attending his own lecture next
Monday is hard to say. Saturday's Oregon-Stanford battle is a match
of even teams.
Both have won and lost two games, both have scored 10-plus more
points than have their opponents and both have been ranked in the
nation's top 20 elevens at least once.
While the Indians have more pin-point passers and flossy-fingered
retrievers, Oregon's Jim Shanley will certainly be the top runner
in Webfootland for Saturday's entanglement. And home-field advan
tage and desire to avenge last year's 44-7 massacre should give the
Oasanovamen the edge.
After Saturday's game, though, things should look up for the
Indians. Injured men will begin wandering back, Brodie will twist
out of his "slump" and help will come from an unexpected source.
That source is A 1 Napoleon, a renegade from Stanford's in-again
out again 1953 warriors. Napoleon, fans may remember, played a
dramatic role in that year's United Nations Day slugfest with UCLA,
won by the Big Red Machine, 21-20.
With the score 20-14, UCLA, and time running out fast, Napoleon
caught a Bob Garrett aerial on the two-yard line and dragged two
Bruins over the goal for the tying TD. Forty-five thousand Stanford
Stadium fans screamed with delight a moment later as the calm
Garrett booted the winning point.
Several weeks after that memorable game, the U.S. Army charged
Napoleon with draft dodging and pulled him out of Coach Taylor's
clutches for a tour of duty with Uncle Sam. (A 1 was later proved
innocent.) After two years' service, Napoleon is back. He has a
year of eligibility left.
Famed as an ace sprint man and pass grabber, Napoleon can be
used as either halfback or flanker-end. In the event of the injuries
expected at UCLA's and UCS's brutal, inhuman hands, he will be
especially valuable in spelling whoever may get "racked."
Meanwhile, back in the classroom, this writer is anxiously await
ing what his friend, the professor, has to say on the Oregon pass
versus-run frolic.

dramatic role in that year's United Nations Day slugfest with UCLA,
won by the Big Red Machine, 21-20.
With the score 20-14, UCLA, and time running out fast, Napoleon
caught a Bob Garrett aerial on the two-yard line and dragged two
Bruins over the goal for the tying TD. Forty-five thousand Stanford
Stadium fans screamed with delight a moment later as the calm
Garrett booted the winning point.
Several weeks after that memorable game, the U.S. Army charged
Napoleon with draft dodging and pulled him out of Coach Taylor's
clutches for a tour of duty with Uncle Sam. (A 1 was later proved
innocent.) After two years' service, Napoleon is back. He has a
year of eligibility left.
Famed as an ace sprint man and pass grabber, Napoleon can be
used as either halfback or flanker-end. In the event of the injuries
expected at UCLA's and UCS's brutal, inhuman hands, he will be
especially valuable in spelling whoever may get "racked."
Meanwhile, back in the classroom, this writer is anxiously await
ing what his friend, the professor, has to say on the Oregon pass
versus-run frolic.
Gridiron devotees this season have been able to follow Farm
football fortunes by the Monday-morning comments of a certain
Stanford professor in his 11 o'clock lecture class.
After the Washington State field-warming, the professor quipped,
"Some of you may regard Stanford as just a pleasant stopping-off
place between home and the Rose Bowl."
But his Monclay-morning cheer had diminished somewhat by the
next week: "Stanford may have lost but no one pan say we did not
fight them with 'Brodie and soul.' "
The 3000-mile, 12-point loss to Ohio State's Buckeyes elicited from
the pedagogue this plain but succinct statement of the "Pasadena
Blues": "The road to the Rose Bowl appears to have a few thorns."
And this Monday, after what Chuck Taylor called "by far our
poorest game to date," the professor had no comment. He didn't
even show up for class.
Whether the pedant will feel like attending his own lecture next
Monday is hard to say. Saturday's Oregon-Stanford battle is a match
of even teams.
Both have won and lost two games, both have scored 10-plus more
points than have their opponents and both have been ranked in the
nation's top 20 elevens at least once.
While the Indians have more pin-point passers and flossy-fingered
retrievers, Oregon's Jim Shanley will certainly be the top runner
in Webfootland for Saturday's entanglement. And home-field advan
tage and desire to avenge last year's 44-7 massacre should give the
Oasanovamen the edge.
After Saturday's game, though, things should look up for the
Indians. Injured men will begin wandering back, Brodie will twist
out of his "slump" and help will come from an unexpected source.
That source is A 1 Napoleon, a renegade from Stanford's in-again
out again 1953 warriors. Napoleon, fans may remember, played a
dramatic role in that year's United Nations Day slugfest with UCLA,
won by the Big Red Machine, 21-20.
