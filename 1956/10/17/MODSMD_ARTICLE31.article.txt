# Ducks Ready to Scramble Indians' Aerial Patterns
## Oregon Air Defense Best in Conference; Brodie, Camera Awaiting Saturday's Test 
### 
Stanford returns to the conference trail Saturday when the Cards
invade Eugene to take on a.tough University of Oregon team. And
the Ducks have ideas of stopping Indian passer John Brodie.
Coach Len Casanova's crew boasts the top defense and pass de
fense in the Pacific Coast Conference. In four games the Webfoots
have allowed only 213 yards

through the air, an average of
53.3 yards a game. The Duck sec
ondary has held opposing passers
down to a meager .305 comple
tion percentage.
In rushing defense, Oregon has
yielded an average of 153.3 yards,
third in the conference behind
Washington State and UCLA.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has the nation's No. 1 passer in
'John Brodie. Lanky John has
thrown for 734 yards already this
season, completing 01 of 102
tosses for a phenomenal .598 per
centage.
His favorite target has been
wingback Paul Camera, who
caught eight against San Jose
State last week.
Stanford's 287 passing total
against the Spartans pulled the
Cards to within 13 yards of
Washington State for the confer
ence leadership.
Yesterday, Coach Chuck Taylor
sent the team through offensive
drills and then a scrimmage
against the jayvees, who were
using Oregon defensive align
ments.
Oregon's attack is built around
fullback Jack Morris and half
back Jim Shanley, two of the
loop's fastest and most dangerous
runners. Shanley was knocked
out of half of last week's Wash
ington game, but is reported
sound and ready to go this week.
Quarterback Tom Crabtree also
presents a ground threat as he
topped PCC signal callers in
rushing last season.
Last year Stanford ran over an
up-and-down Oregon team, 44-7,
rolling up 470 yards in one of the
Indians' best games. The Ducks,
needless to say, would like a little
revenge.


DANGEROUS DUCK — Jack
Morris, Oregon fullback, ranks
as one of the nation's fastest
bucks, having been timed at 9.7
in the 100-yard dash and 23.3
in the 220 - yard low hurdles.
Morris, a 24-year-old Air Force
veteran, is the Webfoots' top
ground gainer.

has the nation's No. 1 passer in
'John Brodie. Lanky John has
thrown for 734 yards already this
season, completing 01 of 102
tosses for a phenomenal .598 per
centage.
His favorite target has been
wingback Paul Camera, who
caught eight against San Jose
State last week.
Stanford's 287 passing total
against the Spartans pulled the
Cards to within 13 yards of
Washington State for the confer
ence leadership.
Yesterday, Coach Chuck Taylor
sent the team through offensive
drills and then a scrimmage
against the jayvees, who were
using Oregon defensive align
ments.
Oregon's attack is built around
fullback Jack Morris and half
back Jim Shanley, two of the
loop's fastest and most dangerous
runners. Shanley was knocked
out of half of last week's Wash
ington game, but is reported
sound and ready to go this week.
Quarterback Tom Crabtree also
presents a ground threat as he
topped PCC signal callers in
rushing last season.
Last year Stanford ran over an
up-and-down Oregon team, 44-7,
rolling up 470 yards in one of the
Indians' best games. The Ducks,
needless to say, would like a little
revenge.


DANGEROUS DUCK — Jack
Morris, Oregon fullback, ranks
as one of the nation's fastest
bucks, having been timed at 9.7
in the 100-yard dash and 23.3
in the 220 - yard low hurdles.
Morris, a 24-year-old Air Force
veteran, is the Webfoots' top
ground gainer.
Stanford returns to the conference trail Saturday when the Cards
invade Eugene to take on a.tough University of Oregon team. And
the Ducks have ideas of stopping Indian passer John Brodie.
Coach Len Casanova's crew boasts the top defense and pass de
fense in the Pacific Coast Conference. In four games the Webfoots
have allowed only 213 yards

through the air, an average of
53.3 yards a game. The Duck sec
ondary has held opposing passers
down to a meager .305 comple
tion percentage.
In rushing defense, Oregon has
yielded an average of 153.3 yards,
third in the conference behind
Washington State and UCLA.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has the nation's No. 1 passer in
