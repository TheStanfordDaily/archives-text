# Liquor Petition Will Circulate In Dormitories
## 
### 
A petition to lower the beer
wine drinking age to 18 will be
circulated around the Stanford
campus today.
Lloyd Down ton, Stanford grad
ual student who first began his
campaign over KZSU Sunday
night, will begin taking the peti
tions through the campus dormi
tories and mailing them to all col
leges in California.
Downton says that student re
sponse to his petition so far has
been apathetic. "Not one person
has offered to help me with the
petition job. After all, I can't
very well take them through the
women's dormitories."
Downton invites all students
who wish to help him to meet at
7:30 at the KZSU basement.
Terry Bateman, KZSU station
maanger, emphasized yesterday
that KZSU is not sponsoring
Downton and does not necessarily
share his opinions. The state
ments advanced over the station
were on his Sunday evening news
commentary "News and Views,"
and were only his own.
Bateman emphasized that he
wanted nothing to do with the
whole sitution, and that Downton
"had better not try to have his
meeting (tonight) in the KZSU
basement," because he (Bateman)
"would not allow it."
Downton claims that he is sup
ported at other colleges, the edi
tor of the University of San Fran
cisco Foghorn being one of his
staunchest supporters.
He is setting 2000 signatures as
a Stanford goal, though he hopes
for more. "If students don't par
ticipate in this petitioning, I will
give up on the possibility of them
ever being a powerful political
force. But I hate to think of Cali
fornia students as being gutless."
He reiterated his strong belief
in the 18-year-old drinking, "and
voting if they show enough inter
est in an issue to sign this peti
tion."
He has said that those old
enough to fight, pay taxes, go to
a dining hall or dance hall and
carry the same study load as old
er students are certainly old
enough to "take a drink when
they want one."
