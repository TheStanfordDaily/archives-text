# Differing Reactions Recorded For New 'Musique Concrete'
## Experimenters Believe They Have Found the 'New Way,' Says Tuesday Series Speaker 
### 
"People react differently to this Musique Concrete," said Pro
fessor Stanley T. Donner. "Some laugh, some like it. The people
who make this music can take it seriously. They believe they have
found the new way."
Donner demonstrated the new experimental form to a Tuesday

Evening lecture audience last
night. He has recently returned
from a year of radio and televi
sion research in France. The topic
was "Radio and Television in
France, 1956."
Musique Concrete is the result
of common sounds, such as a car
starting, a cough, or footsteps,
that have been distorted, contract
ed and assembled on one tape. It
is an effort to compose music by
using sounds without musical in
struments.
The "music" is a mixture that
resembles knocking, clattering,
voices, laughing, repetition of
phrases. It is strident, crashing,
grating, tinkling, increasing and
diminishing. Often there are dis
tinct musical sounds.
This is a sound that requires
imagination, but it is definitely
an interesting new form.
"The most important character
istic of the French people," said
Donner, "is their love of beauty,
sense of the artistic and their un
willingness to compromise. This
is reflected in radio and televi
sion.
Donner called the radio "mai
son" now under construction in
Paris ''a monument to the !• rench
belief that radio and television can
be done with artistry and taste."
He said the educational radio
and television in France are excel
lent. Lectures from the Sorbonne
are broadcast. Television pro
grams for children arc a contrast
to the United States', but Hopa
long Cassidy is there too. Dramas,
he said, are done to pcrfcction.
