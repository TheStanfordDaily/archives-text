NEW YORK, Oct. 16 (UP)
Senator Estos Kefauver charged
tonight thai more heads nf gov
ernment agencies have been "in
volved in corruption" under Pres
ident Eisenhower than in any ad
ministration since the Republi
cans under General U. S. Grant.
The Democratic Vice-Presiden
tial nominee lashed out at what
he called the scandals of Eisen
hower's "Cadillac cabinet" in re
marks on his first nationwide tel
ecast.
The Tennessee Democrat used
filmed statements by President
Eisenhower, particularly during
the 19ii2 campaign, to bolster
what Kefauver called the "Eisen
hower gallery of broken prom
ises." He hit particularly at Ei
senhower's promises on taxes, la
bor legislation, farm legislation,
the cost of living, small business
and corruption.
"Back in 1952," Kefauver said,
"the Republicans launched a
great crusade to clean up the cor
ruption."
"Under the Eisenhower â€¢ Nixon
administration," Kefauver
charged, "more heads of govern
ment agencies have been involved
in corruption than under any oth
er administration since the Re
publican administration of Gen
eral Grant."
