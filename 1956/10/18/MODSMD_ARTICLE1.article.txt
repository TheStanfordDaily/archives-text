# Nixon 'A Shifty Demagogue,' Adlai Charges
## Says Vice-President Not Worthy of Trust; Also Blasts Dewey 
### 
FLINT, Mich., Oct, 17 (UP) â€”
Adlai E. Stevenson cut loose with
the sharpest- language of his elec
tion campaign tonight as he de
nouncer! Vice-President Richard
M. Nixon as a man not to be
trusted by the American people.
He called Nixon a "shifty" dem
agogue "whose trademark is
slander" and who, if reelected,
"may become President at any
moment."
Stevenson also tore into Thom
as E. Dewey, former New York
governor and ardent supporter of
President Eisenhower, as an ex
ponent of "wilder untruths" and
misrepresentation of the world
situation.
Weeks of Preparation
The Democratic candidate had
prepared for weeks for a frontal
blast at Nixon, who is regarded
by top Democratic strategists as
one of their best issues of the
campaign.
Stevenson's detailed denuncia
tion of the Vice-President cli
maxed a day of railroad whistle
slopping in Michigan.
Stevenson marie no direct ref
erence to Eisenhower's health,
but the inference was plain when
he reminded his audience that the
voters this year should use ut
most care in considering "who
will be their President if the
elected President is prevented by
a higher will from serving his
full term."
Cites Nixon's Record
lie cited what he described as
the record of Nixon who on elec
tion day, "win or lose," will "take
over leadership of the Republican
party."
He said Nixon voted to deprive
1,000,000 workers of the protec
tion of minimum wage, against
public, farm and middle income
housing, against public power,
tho rural electrification program
and federal grants to medical
schools. But Nixon had voted for
the Taft-Hartley Labor-Manage
ment Law.
"The record is short and
dreary," Stevenson said. "It is
not the record, I suggest, of a
man who is likely to lead us into
a new America."
He also described the Vice-Pres
ident as "a man whose greatest
political talent is a mastery of
personal innuendo, who cries
'treason' and spreads fear and
doubt, a man who uses language
to conceal issues rather than ex
plore them, a man whose trade
mark is slander."
