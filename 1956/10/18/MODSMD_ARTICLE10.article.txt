# Liquor Petition: An Old Story
## 
### 
Parallels between Stanford,
autumn, 1952, and Stanford, au
tumn, 1956, are striking.
Students with a bent for poli
tics were watching candidates
Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Ei
senhower building their cam
paigns around a Nov. 4 dead
line.
Enthusiasm was growing for
the yearly Big Game tangle.
The goal was set: an axe and
the Rose Bowl.
Still another parallel stands
out. Four years students
became agitated, although only
mildly, about the under-age
drinking problem. The preced
ing autumn, ASSU Executive
Committee had passed unani
mously a resolution favoring
lowering the legal drinking age
to 18 for beer, ale and "unforti
fied" wines (13 per cent alco

holic content) and providing
picture identification cards for
18- to 21-year olds. Wayne Alley,
then ASSU president, supported
the resolution by saying, "Be
cause this touches student af
fairs so closely, we feel the Ex
ecutive Committee should avoid
both hypocrisy and pussyfoot
ing. To deny a problem exists is
to play the ostrich."
The issue lay quiet for the
rest of the year, but was taken
up again in autumn, 1952, when
the Executive Committee de
cided to put the issue before the
students in a referendum.
The proposal read as follows:
"The students of Stanford
University resolve that the State
of California set the minimum
legal age for the purchase of
beers, ales and wines containing
less than 13 per cent alcohol by

volume at 18 years and provide
persons between the ages of 18
and 21 years with non-transfer
able personal identification
which includes a picture ol the
holder.
1. "Do you approve of this
idea ?
2. "Do you approve of submit
ting this idea to the State Legis
lature?"
Both questions were defeated
conclusively. On the first ques
tion. students voted 1388 against
and 1131 for the resolution. On
the second, they voted 1525
against and 1113 for.
With the students' obvious
disapproval of the proposal, the
Executive Committee withdrew
its previous support of the liq
uor resolution, and there the
matter died until taken up again
this year.
