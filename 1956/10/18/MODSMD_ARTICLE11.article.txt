# LASSU Ducks Liquor Issue At Meeting
## Appropriations Given, Ticket Sales Policy Set by Legislature 
### Dave Scott Associate Editor 
Legislature was presented with
the liquor problem again last
night and astutely ducked it.
After Legislature unofficially
approved the Social Coordinating
Board's ruling of last week to not
sanction any ASSU or Stanford
student organization at which the
encouragement of minors drink
ing liquor is a featured event,
Lloyd Downton's petition to lower
the drinking age came up for dis
cussion.
It was met with a stony, apa
thetic silence by most of the mem
bers in attendance.
"We are beating our heads
against a stone wall when going
to the state legislature with the
gentleman's petition," Dave Kir
bach, Law School representative,
declared. "Since we are mostly
under 21. we wouldn't have any
vote on the subject anyway."
Subject Dropped
When President Rob Freclen
asked for volunteers to look at*
the petition and draft an approval
for Legislature to act on, there
were no responses. "There seems
no reason to prolong this discus
sion." concluded Freelen.
Legislature voted down unani
mously a proposed change to the
ASSU election bylaws which
would have made freshmen ineli
gible to vote for Men's and Wom
en's Council members.
The body did approve by a close
8-to-7 vote an impassioned plea by
Rnlly Committee Chairman Bill
Lackey for $144 to buy film for a
documentary movie of this year's
card stunts at the Michigan Slate.
San Jose State, USC, UCLA and
California football games.
Stern Denied
Stern Hall's request to sell tick
ets to its Homecoming Dance at
neighboring campuses was reject
ed by Legislature. Student Finan
cial Manager Bill Mathewson led
j the defeat of the measure, fearing
retaliatory ticket raids by other
schools.
Head Yell Leader Bill Duke was
! granted "up to $30" to aid in the
: expense of taking three yell lead
ers up to the Oregon game this
| weekend.
Freelen announced there would
lie important meetings with the
! deans of students and student
leaders of USC, UCLA and Stan
ford over the week end on the
! Stanford campus. "These could be
the stormiest games in many
| years if student action to co
! operate is not taken," he com-
I mented.
Legislature will meet Tuesday
instead of Wednesday next week
1 for its regular meeting, in order
Ito approve Ihe primary elect ion
