# 'ARABS NEED TO SELL OIL'
## Economic Crisis From Suez Short-lived, Britisher Says 
### 
"The greatest danger in the Suez crisis would be violation of the
United Nations charter regarding the use of force," said British in
dustrialist and Member of Parliament Hiliary Marquand.
Following his round-table discussion on "Industrial Relations in
Britain Today," Marquand said that the economic crisis resulting

from Suez would be short-lived.
"We need to buy Near Eastern
oil. Sometimes in the heat of an
arrogant action like Nasser's, we
forget that the Arabs need to sell
oil."
Marquand pointed out that, al
though dispatching British troops
to the Suez area was merely
preparation in case the use of
force should be necessary, the ac
tion was "excessively bellicose."
"The British Labor party," he
said, "insists on reference to the
UN and acceptance of the UN de
cision. They particularly want
observance of the UN charter re
garding the use of force."
Not letting Israeli ships pass
through the canal was the first
illegal act, he said. But he em
phasized that Egypt will discover
the natural reaction of interfer
ing with trade.
"It is a complete impossibility
for Nasser to compensate the
shareholders fairly, and at the
same time operate the canal and
build Aswan Dam with the prof
its," he said.
Building another canal would
be economically unadvisable, ac
cording to Marquand. But if it
becomes necessary, Great Britain
and other countries which need
Arab oil could build an overland
pipeline to continue the passage
of oil necessary to both the Arab
nations and the West.
Marquand has been a cabinet
minister in the Labor govern
ment since 1945. He is also an
economist, author and publicist.
He visited Stanford and other
American universities to confer
with faculty members and stu
dents interested in political and
economic currents in Great Brit
ain.
