# 2000 Signers Sought for SU; Petitions Start
## 50 Signed-up Favoring 18-Year-Old Drinking; Downton Is Pessimistic 
### 
Fifty more students have
jumped aboard Lloyd Downton's
lower-the-drinking age bandwag
on which is expected to pick up
speed today when petitions will
be formally circulated on cam
pus.
Downton has set his goal at
2000 signatures to the petitions
which ask the California State
Legislature to replace the pres
ent drinking laws with one that
will enable 18-year-olds to buy
and drink beer and wine.
Downton picked up the 50 sup
porters in informal petition sign
ing here yesterday. Tomorrow
and throughout this week he will
circulate the mimeographed
forms. He has tentative plans to
present them to individual living
groups at house meetings next
Monday night.
Campaign Begins
The campaign was started on
his KZSU program last Friday
night. Downton is frankly pessi
mistic concerning Stanford sup
port for the proposal.
He anticipates that concurrent,
campaigns at the University of
San Francisco and San Francisco
State College will pick up more
support.
"They have more spirit and
youthful enthusiasm," he said.
"The lack of spirit at Stanford is
frightening."
"I'm not attempting to force
anything," he said. "If the cam
paign doesn't go over it's obvious
that 18-year-olds don't want to
drink beer legally.
Is It Wanted?
"I thought I was starting a pe
tition for something that every
body wanted."
Downton feels that if he gets
enough signatures the State Leg
islature will have to recognize the
desires of the 18-year-olds.
"They will be 21 by the next
elections and they'll remember
what the politicians did." he said.
The San Francisco News found
in a recent survey that generally
students do want the age lowered,
that educator would consider a
new law and that enforcement
agencies are neutral, usually re
spondingn that "we'll enforce the
law, whatever it is."
Stanford Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler has praised
Stanford students for the method
they're using in seeking a change.
"They're entitled to petition for
a change in the state laws," he
said.
Stanford's student legislature
has dropped comment on the is
sue, one member saying "we are
beating our heads against a stone
wall."
But stone wall or not, Downton
hopes enough students will sign
teh petitions to help change a law
that, in the words of USF Student
Body President A 1 Boro, "is al
ways broken." Broken by the
very students who will be will
ing or unwilling to sign the peli
tions.
"I hate to think of California
students as gutless," Downton
said.
