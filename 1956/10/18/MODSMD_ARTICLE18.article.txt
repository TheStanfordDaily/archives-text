# Sign the Petition
## 
### 
Although the crusading Lloyd Downton has
been dropped from the rosters of KZSU, he is
determined to carry on liis fight against the
present legal age for drinking.
His plans at present are to circulate petitions
within campus residences and to get as many
signatures as lie can with the limited personnel
lie has to work with him.
You may not agree with his reasons for
seeking a change in the legal drinking age, hut
whatever the details of his reasoning may he,
the) reflect a recognition of the unrealistic,
hypocritical nature of the present law.

Whatever your own reasons may he, if you
feel that the law should he changed, we urge
you to sign the petition, lor, as yet, it is the
first direct line of action in regard to this prob
lem that has come out of Stanford.
Maybe nothing will come of the petition;
maybe it will be buried deep beneath a stack
of other unheeded petitions at the state capitol,
hut unless the matter is presented to the legis
lators by persons directly affected, it will never
be acted upon.
Why should they care if we don't?
