# THE
						NATIONAL SCENE
## Which Party Offers Best Domestic Policy? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
Eisenhower said recently that this coming
election will be fought entirely over domestic
issues. There are no other issues but these, he
claimed.
\\ helhcr the Republican stand on domestic
policies is correct remains to be seen. There
remain grave doubts in the people's minds
over the correctness of many of the domestic
policies of the present Administration.
It is almost axiomatic among economists that
a full and prosperous economy demands that
all resources be utilized, that there should he
no unemployment of any resources.
11 is no secret that Republicans favor exploi
tation of America's natural resources by private
capital. Contrary to what many believe, so do
Democrats. But there is a difference.
W hen there is a project, the full and efficient
utilization of which is more than private capi
tal can handle—juch as TVA and Columbia
Valley Project—then that project should be
financed and developed by the federal govern
ment instead of letting private capital develop
only whSt it is able to, thus not utilizing the
full potential of that resource.
But what have the Republicans done?
I hey have turned Hells Canyon over to pri
vate capital to build low-level dams, when high
level dams, which private capital cannot afford,
are really needed for full utilization of re
sources that economists speak of.
They have consistently put roadblocks in
front of other federal projects such as the Ni
agara Project, which would be beneficial to the
people of the New England states.
They have consistently tried to turn over to
private capital public projects already in use.
People do not easily forget Dixon-Yates and
the scandals connected with that scheme.
Federal aid to education is another issue
that might hurt Eisenhower. This bill, of great
importance to the nation, was defeated in the
House by a majority Republican vote. True, it
was defeated primarily because of the Powell
amendment.
But Powell, though a Democrat; has come
out in support of Eisenhower.
Also, a run-down of California Republican
h gislators will show that, almost to a man,
they are against federal aid to education.
A third very important domestic issue is that
of civil rights. The Democratic party, like the
Republican party, is composed of both liberals
and conservatives. The liberal element, which
far outweighs the conservative, is and always
has been strong on civil rights.
It was Truman, a Democratic President, who
issued the directive calling for complete inte
gration in the armed services. It has been Dem
ocrats like Kefauver who have been strongest
in their advocacy of racial integration in the
South, not Republicans.
I bus, on these three important domestic
issues the Democrats are sure of their stand.
' heir position is decisive and easily under
wood. One does not need an electronic calcu
lator to discover what Democrats intend to do
when they get elected in November.

When election - minded Democrats stop to
consider three important domestic issues nat
ural resources, federal aid to education and
civil rights—they often discover they have suc
cumbed to the influences of microscopy, du
plicity and silence, respectively.
Their microscopic observations of federal
power questions are only surpassed by their
half-truth arguments on federal aid to educa
tion and the silent treatment they reserve for
real civil rights problems. In the final analysis,
the podium - sniffers have little beside the
weight of their scripts to sustain a case for a
Democratic-controlled domestic program.
Look at the reams of material produced by
the advocates of federal power programs.
""Give-away!" they shout when private business
is given contracts to build public dams and
other natural-resource projects.
Instead, they would have a "big government"
program at a heavy cost to taxpayers now and
in the future, a cost compounded of bureauc
racy and unfunded debt; while the initiative
of private business—a great part of it small
power companies—suffers.
Republicans prefer a "give-away" to repre
sentatives of free enterprise immeasurably more
than they do a wholesale sell-out to the ma
chinery of a federal leviathan. •
The Eisenhower philosophy is clearly that
the vast natural resources of this nation should
be developed by a free economy wherever pos
sible. Ihe last four years have reversed the
wheels of sell-out, and four more GOP years
will continue in motion the wheels of achieve
ment which have already made important ad
vances.
Federal aid to education is one of the great
needs of our country, cry the Democrats. They
say that it is the Republicans who are to blame
because "a large majority of Republicans voted
against aid while the majority of Democrats
voted for it."
\V hat Stevenson & Co. conveniently neglect
to mention is that it was Democratic initiative
which brought the crippling Powell amend
ment to the House which 105 Democrats op
posed and 119 supported. The Democrats were
ready to kill the School Aid Bill in the Senate,
if it had not been done in the House.
As a result of such tactics, there is no aid to
schools. Republicans are determined, accord
ing to their platform, to "renew efforts to enact
a program ... to encourage increased state
and local efforts to build more classrooms . . .
and to urge a five-year program of federal as
sistance in building schools."
Civil rights is a topic which Democrats are
prone to treat with kid-gloved silence in def
erence to their Southern cohorts. But even if
this situation did not exist, they would be hard
pressed to find argument with the accomplish
ments of the Eisenhower Administration in this
field.
Clearly, the Negro vote has reason to swing
Republican. The wavering attitudes of the
Democratic candidates have not pleased the
Negroes, and the Eisenhower civil rights
achievements have. The Democrats offer noth
ing because they are handicapped where their
strength lies.
