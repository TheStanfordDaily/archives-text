Downton Answers
Editor, The Daily:
Thanks lor ihe excellent coverage you have
given my efforts to lower the legal drinking age
lor beer and wine. Considering all the namby
pambies 1 have come across in trying to promote
a petition on this campus, it is indeed comforting
and refreshing to see that there is some student
enthusiasm and energy left at Stanford.
I notice that in yesterday's Daily, John Lau
rence has criticized some of the reasons I have
given for repeal of the present liquor law. (A
feature in the San Francisco News, incidentally,
shows that professors, police and other students
share my opinion.)
Laurence has taken the usual "academic" ap
proach in his criticism. It is very simple to criti
cize the efforts of others. Anyoiie can do this.
I notice that Laurence has not given a single
argument of his own or suggested even one con
crete avenue of action.
"This issue has merit and deserves serious
thinking," he says."It is possible that we would
be better off wilh aji 18-year-old minimum."
If Laurence or some of his older friends have
lime to suggest some way he can bring about
lowering the 21 -year-old limit, I wish he would
contact me.
There is a possibility of changing the present
law. It will take time and lots of effort, i would
certainly appreciate all the help I can get.

Logic ami 18-Year-Olil Drinking
Editor, The Daily:
Downton presents a rather interesting if some
what irrational case in support of his proposed
petition to lower the drinking age from 21 to IS
years.
The logic involved is practically non existent,
so let us apply logic to each one of his "reasons"
for the petition, and see where we come out.
First of all, Downton uses the "old enough to
fight, old enough to drink" approach to the prob
lem. The first question that comes to my mind
is, "Why?" The statement as it stands is totally
irrational; men can be drafted at the age of 18
years to serve their country, sequitur; they are
old enough to drink.
Suppose that men were not drafted at all; by
Downton's "logic" they would never be able to
drink. And. now that we're on the subject, does
Downton intend to restrict this proposal to men
only? I am afraid that this particular argument
would not apply to the woman members of the
student body, since they are not subject to the
draft.
Downton's next statement calls for some
thought: Downton is trying to lower the drinking
age; "movies and dance halls are not sufficient
entertainment for today's youth."
If statement "A" implies statement "R," then
drinking implies entertainment. Now, in what
way is drinking a form of entertainment which
may be placed in the same category as going to
a movie or going dancing? Is drinking a form
of entertainment?
"Eighteen-year-olds are taxed by the govern
ment as heavily as 80-year-olds." The statement
is factually true, but, to carry it one step .further,
10-year-olds are taxed by the government as
heavily as 80-year-oldsâ€”or, for that matter, so
are 5-year-olds, assuming that they earn enough
money to be taxable.
This is not a hypothetical case. How about
child movie stars, young radio and TV quiz con
testants?
I am sorry to have to phrase my requirement

of proof in that manner, but Downton did make
the statement, and proof is definitely in order.
His last argument is a real gem; "college stu
dents who are 18 carry the same study load and
the same responsibility as those who are over 21."
What, in the name of all that is holy, has the
study load of a college student got to do with
whether or not he is entitled to drink? My views
may be rather distorted, but I cannot see the
slightest relationship between the two.
I am neither for nor against the proposal; I
am neutral. But before I am swayed either one
way or the other I will have to hear more con
vincing arguments than these.

One Viewpoint 011 Fraternities
Editor, The Daily:
It has become fashionable to criticize the fra
ternity system on various grounds. The Daily
has chosen on this occasion to center its attack
on some of the more unsavory aspects of Hell
Week. Though few fraternity members feel that
Hell Week is not without its abuses, we are more
concerned about the implications in your article
that suggest our living groups be abolished on
this campus.
We are not on trial. We are weary of being
reminded that sororities were removed at Stan
ford and that we have henceforth been regarded
as second-class citizens. We feel little gratitude
to the University for our continued existence.
We feel we have filled the actual physical need
for housing for a period of many years, and we
have offered the student a worthwhile experience
that no other group on campus can perform.
We do not see the necessity of constantly
having to "prove ourselves" to the University
with service projects and good deeds, any more
than we feel it necessary for Daily members to
spend their idle hours picking up paper around
campus to demonstrate good faith.
It is obvious that a large number of campus
leaders active in every form of student life are
members of fraternities.
Many of us feel that a definite hostility is di
rected toward the fraternity by the administra
tion. Perhaps the reason for this is summarized
in President Sterling's foreword to the 1955 Stan
ford Fraternity Handbook. He speaks of the
"recognition by fraternity men and independents
alike that the student is first of all a Stanford
man." Each year the University grows larger,
yet each year we are taught to think of this huge
sprawling giant as a single autonomous unit.
The University has grounds to feel intensely
jealous of the fraternity, because these living
groups exist as units that are independent of Uni
versity sponsorship and exceedingly difficult to
control.
The fraternity has an allegiance not only to
the University but to a mysterious group known
as "the national." Regardless of the fact that
most fraternity members are oblivious to any
sort of control by their national office, and many
are unable even to recall the ritual ceremonies
that they must demonstrate once a year for the
visiting secretary from the national office, the
whole concept of an outside alliance is inconsist
ent with the idea of a "Stanford man."
Furthermore, the fraternity itself is probably
the best-disciplined and regimented group on
campus, usually voting or not voting as a unit
in student elections, and refusing to reveal any
more information about their activities than is
specifically required by the University.
