# Stanford to Have New Bookstore; Tentatively Planned for Next Autumn
## 
### 
Stanford University is going to
have a new Bookstore.
This was the information re
leased by John Lynd of the Uni
versity Planning Board.
He said that, while the Board
of Directors of the Bookstore have
agreed on and approved a set of
plans for the future building, final
approval must come from the Uni
versity Board of Directors' and
the President's offices. When the
go-ahead signal is received from
these sources, the plans will be
submitted to the architect and the
real work will begin.
"We hope we may have it by
fall," Lynd said. That means that
plans must be okayed this quar
ter, architectural plans drawn up
in winter quarter, with actual
construction beginning in the
spring.
Construction on the new post
office is tentatively scheduled to
begin this winter quarter when
the new music building, directly
across Los Arboles Street from
the present post office, will be
nearing completion.
The new Post Office will be
located across Lasuen Street from
its present site and a ways up the
Row from the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon house.
Preliminary Bookstore plans
have it located across Sal vat intra
Street from the Union courtyard.
John Carl Warneck, a San Fran
cisco architect, is doing both
Bookstore and post office plans
since the buildings are going to
be partially connected with a joint
rear parking lot servicing both.
Professor Chilton Bush, vice
president of the Board of Direc
tors for the Bookstore, said the
new store will be at least twice
the size of the present one and
will be specifically divided into
distinct departments. He hopes
the new Bookstore will be a "self
service" arrangement, with check
out stands located near the doors,
much the same as today's super
markets.
He continued to explain that all
the present departments will be
enlarged and that the gift depart
ment will definitely be continued,
since this is the s to re's only
source of profits from which re
bates can be made available.
"This small section does more
business than all the other de
partments combined," Mrs. Hel
ena Bauchou, Bookstore manager,
said. It takes in $500 to $000 a
day. This is the section that made
possible last year's rebAte of 18

per cent, $90,000 total. In some
years rebates have been as much
as 25 per cent, Mrs. Bauchou said.
"This building was originally
planned to serve 3500 students,"
she said. "Since tljen the enroll
ment has reached 8000 and it is
almost a physical impossibility to
serve the students under these
conditions.
"Furthermore, the present
amount of space for storage is
almost nil, thus forcing us to
order books, supplies and all
forms of merchandise only as we
need them from week to week.
"By being able to order text
books ahead of time (with ade
quate storage space) and making
it a self-service store, students
will be able to buy their books al
the beginning of each quarter
with half the effort experienced
in this fall's rush."

Tho original Bookstore was be
|gun in the first years of the Uni
j versity by a group of students.
In 1895 it became incorporated as
an organization established spe
cifically for Stanford University,
with stockholders each purchas
ing one share for $1.
It is still run today in this man
ner. None of the stockholders re
ceive any of the profits. All prof
its are returned to the students
in the form of rebates.

overworked salesgirls. Tentative plans for a new Bookstore have
been approved by the Bookstore Board. Construction is scheduled
to begin spring quarter. —Daily Photo by Ed Fayle
