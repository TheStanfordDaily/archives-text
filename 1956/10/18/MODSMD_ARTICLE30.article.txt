# Looking It Over

Rabid alumni groups have been known to do some mighty queer
things in order to get this or that particular football standout to
play ball for their "alma mater" and "their coach." In some cases
the actions are criminal, under cover, costly. Anything goes when
the question of a-winning grid team or a national rating is at stake.
To many of the "big men" behind such groups it's a hobby, a
game which until this year has had few repercussions. The Pacific
Coast Conference episode started a string of fireworks that won't
quit resounding—the "mess" is everywhere—the clean up has just
begun.
Most of the university presidents connected with the PCC have
earnestly attempted solving the problems, first by punishing the
guilty, now by trying to reach a workable code to he followed hy
all the schools. Universities were fined and football players were
severely penalized.
What has been done about the real culprits—the holders of the
money-bags, the party-boys who tempted the high school stars with
money, sex and rash promises? All the PCC presidents could do is
demand cessation of university ties with such alumni groups as the
Southern Seas and the Young Men's Club of Westwood.
This is not to say that the athletes accused were not guilty. They
are rational. Rather, this is intended to point a finger at the basis
of the colleges' athletic problems today. Fund - raising groups
throughout the country from Seattle to Miami, from Los Angeles
to Baltimore—have placed ideas before ideals in a desire to associate
themselves with their "alma mater"- now a winning team.
For every generalization there are exceptions and for the one
above there are obviously many exceptions. One such, to be sure,
is the Stanford alumni groups and the Buck Club. Thus far all
transactions have been on the board, recruiting has been carefully
handled by the administration and the coaches are able to feel secure
in their positions.
If it had not been for the temperance and farsightedness of
Stanford alumni, President Wallace Sterling would be a prisoner
of his own moral convictions, and his demands for a sound athletic
program, accepted and practiced hy all schools in the PCC, would
be futile.
Looking over the present situation, it is evident that illegal prac
tices still prevail throughout the country—even on the West Coast.
Such organizations as the Oklahoma U. Touchdown Club, composed
of many oil magnates, Auburn's Booster Club and Michigan State's
Spartan Foundation function with notorious results. Oklahoma and
MSU rate tops in the national football scene today. A good invest
ment?
Behind the scenes on the Coast it was the financial interruptions
of Greater Seattle's slush fund, the Southern California Educational
Foundation, the Bruin Bench, the Young Men's Club of Westwood,
the Southern Seas and the San Francisco Grid Club that caused the
inevitable stir.
In the October issue of True magazine an article by A 1 Stump,
"Football's Biggest Stink," throws some light on the dark mark
called "that PCC mess." Many of the points brought out in the ar
ticle are obviously exaggerated, but some are all too true.
Branding the sex orgies described as unsubstantiated, a look at
other effective recruiting practices should suffice. Waves of indi
viduals representing alumni groups high-pressure a football pros
pect even after the player enters another institution. Extravagant
parties are planned, financial assistance is promised not only to
the student (?), hut in some exceptional cases to the boy's father.
x A 1 Stump says some Old Grads go so far as to take 'likely high
school prospects for airplane and yacht trips—a safe under-cover
system for "throwing the pitch."
In the past five years, alumni have raised an illegal $2,500,000 on
the Coast and yet, from 1957 to 1956, only $66,155 has been assessed
in PCC fines—a mere drop in the bucket. Of the nine PCC institu
tions, Stanford was next to last on "football's biggest rap sheet,"
Oregon being the only university drawing a smaller total in fine's.
Actually a book could he written on illegal practices by alumni
groups which are today seriously threatening the college sports
scene. Facts, figures and "humorous" incidents would make for
good reading.
Before football can again be clean, under-the-board alumni inter
vention must be crushed. College sports are for the students not
the Old Grads.
In the end a national football code under the supervision of the
NCAA is the answer. The boys will continue to play their hearts out,
theie will be as many, if not more, outstanding performers and the
conferences will again become balanced, thus adding to the excite
ment of college football.
