# Ducks Boast Fast Backs
## 
### Bob Payne 
If they can hang on to the ball,
Oregon's "pony" barks might
cause Stanford defenders plenty
of trouble in Saturday's clash at
Hayward Field in Eugene.
The 1956 Oregon team has one
of the fastest backfields ever as
sembled on the Coast. Coach Len
Casanova can call on no less than
five sprinters among his leather
packing corps, plus a number of
other backs who could meet the
qualifications.
Fumbles have put a crimp in
the Ducks' offense and all but
knocked them out of the confer
ence race. Last week they lost the
ball five times in dropping a 20-7
decision to Washington, and two
weeks ago the Webfoots bobbled
seven times in losing to UCLA,
6-0. The crusher in that game was
a fumble on the Oregon 1, setting
up the Bruins' lone score.
Powerful Ground Attack
Fullback Jack Morris and half
backs Jim Shanley and Jack
Brown head the powerful ground
attack. All three are juniors, giv
ing the Ducks a bright outlook
for next season. An unrelated pair
of Crabtrees quarterback the club,
with Tom getting the starting call.
Last season Shanley established
a conference record for sopho
mores with 711 yards rusking—
second in the PCC and 10th in the
nation. His average of 7.11 yards
per carry ranked third among the
nation's regular backs. The 5 foot
8 inch, 170-pound scatback was
also named to numerous All-Coast
elevens.
Morris, who runs the 100-yard
dash in 9.7 and the 220-yard low
hurdles in 23.3, set an Oregon
mark last year when he scored
68 points. This year he is the top
Webfoot rusher with 266 yards in
57 carries.

The Stanford Indians went
through a passing drill yester
day in preparation for Satur
day's Oregon game. Pass of
fense plays were stressed. The
37 members of the Cardinal
traveling squad . will hold a
12:30 p.m. drill today before
leaving for Eugene by train at
2:30.
Tackles Chris Plain and Ty
Polich missed yesterday's ses
sion due to a minor leg infec
tion and a cold, respectively.
They will both be ready for the
game. Halfback Gordy Young
and tackle John Kidd were hack
in action after having missed
practice on Tuesday.

terback last season, filling in for
the graduated star George Shaw.
Tom topped PCC quarterbacks in
rushing from the option play, roll
ing up 338 yards on the ground.
Jack Crabtree is the better passer
of the two.
Reserve Strength
The Oregon speed doesn't end
here, however. In reserve, at the
halves, are two more sprinters,
Chuck Osborne and Hank Lou
mena.
Morris is being pushed at full
back by Fred Miklancic, a 206-
pound senior who played a major
role in the Ducks' thumping on
Colorado in the season's opener.
Additional depth at fullback is
given by sophomore Will Reeve,
a standout last week in the Wash
ington game.
The Webfoot line is not as awe

some. Coach Casanova and his
staff have run into problems at
tackle and center. John Raventos
is the most experienced man at
tackle, while Nick Markulis and
Norm Chapman have been han
dling the center duties.
Outlook Brighter
Elsewhere in the forward wall
the outlook is brighter . . . for
Oregon. Captain Phil McHugh
rates as one of the loop's top ends,
both on offense and defense. He
led the '55 Ducks in minutes play
ed, 463 out of a possible 600.
The guard posts are well man
ned by the "Fireplug Twins,"
Spike Hillstrom and Reanous
Cochrane. Hillstrom is a 5 foot
8 inch, 189 - pound terror, while
Cochrane is just an inch taller
and scales 10 pounds heavier.
Backing them at guard are Harry
Mondale and Jack Pocock, top re
serves last season.
The Webfoots hope to get back
on the win trail and duplicate last
season's finish. Last year the
Ducks won five of their last six
games, four by shutouts, losing
only to Stanford, 44-7. They closed
their season by smashing arch
rival Oregon State, 28-0, after the
Beavers had enjoyed one of their
best years.
Anything but pushovers.

some. Coach Casanova and his
staff have run into problems at
tackle and center. John Raventos
is the most experienced man at
tackle, while Nick Markulis and
Norm Chapman have been han
dling the center duties.
Outlook Brighter
Elsewhere in the forward wall
the outlook is brighter . . . for
Oregon. Captain Phil McHugh
rates as one of the loop's top ends,
both on offense and defense. He
led the '55 Ducks in minutes play
ed, 463 out of a possible 600.
The guard posts are well man
ned by the "Fireplug Twins,"
Spike Hillstrom and Reanous
Cochrane. Hillstrom is a 5 foot
8 inch, 189 - pound terror, while
Cochrane is just an inch taller
and scales 10 pounds heavier.
Backing them at guard are Harry
Mondale and Jack Pocock, top re
serves last season.
The Webfoots hope to get back
on the win trail and duplicate last
season's finish. Last year the
Ducks won five of their last six
games, four by shutouts, losing
only to Stanford, 44-7. They closed
their season by smashing arch
rival Oregon State, 28-0, after the
Beavers had enjoyed one of their

READY TO GO —Called a "top reserve" last year, Oregon guard
Jack Poeoek will be a line starter come Saturday. He lias been a
valuable asset, to the Oregon team, tilling various holes iu the line
as bis coaches have wished.
If they can hang on to the ball,
Oregon's "pony" barks might
cause Stanford defenders plenty
of trouble in Saturday's clash at
Hayward Field in Eugene.
The 1956 Oregon team has one
of the fastest backfields ever as
sembled on the Coast. Coach Len
Casanova can call on no less than
five sprinters among his leather
packing corps, plus a number of
other backs who could meet the
qualifications.
Fumbles have put a crimp in
the Ducks' offense and all but
knocked them out of the confer
ence race. Last week they lost the
ball five times in dropping a 20-7
decision to Washington, and two
weeks ago the Webfoots bobbled
seven times in losing to UCLA,
6-0. The crusher in that game was
a fumble on the Oregon 1, setting
up the Bruins' lone score.
Powerful Ground Attack
Fullback Jack Morris and half
backs Jim Shanley and Jack
Brown head the powerful ground
attack. All three are juniors, giv
ing the Ducks a bright outlook
for next season. An unrelated pair
of Crabtrees quarterback the club,
with Tom getting the starting call.
Last season Shanley established
a conference record for sopho
mores with 711 yards rusking—
second in the PCC and 10th in the
nation. His average of 7.11 yards
per carry ranked third among the
nation's regular backs. The 5 foot
8 inch, 170-pound scatback was
also named to numerous All-Coast
elevens.
Morris, who runs the 100-yard
dash in 9.7 and the 220-yard low
hurdles in 23.3, set an Oregon
mark last year when he scored
68 points. This year he is the top

the graduated star George Shaw.
Tom topped PCC quarterbacks in
rushing from the option play, roll
ing up 338 yards on the ground.
Jack Crabtree is the better passer
of the two.
Reserve Strength
The Oregon speed doesn't end
here, however. In reserve, at the
halves, are two more sprinters,
Chuck Osborne and Hank Lou
mena.
Morris is being pushed at full
back by Fred Miklancic, a 206-
pound senior who played a major
role in the Ducks' thumping on
Colorado in the season's opener.
Additional depth at fullback is
given by sophomore Will Reeve,
a standout last week in the Wash
ington game.
The Webfoot line is not as awe

some. Coach Casanova and his
staff have run into problems at
tackle and center. John Raventos
is the most experienced man at
tackle, while Nick Markulis and
Norm Chapman have been han
dling the center duties.
Outlook Brighter
Elsewhere in the forward wall
the outlook is brighter . . . for
Oregon. Captain Phil McHugh
rates as one of the loop's top ends,
both on offense and defense. He
led the '55 Ducks in minutes play
ed, 463 out of a possible 600.
The guard posts are well man
ned by the "Fireplug Twins,"
Spike Hillstrom and Reanous
Cochrane. Hillstrom is a 5 foot
8 inch, 189 - pound terror, while
Cochrane is just an inch taller
and scales 10 pounds heavier.
Backing them at guard are Harry
Mondale and Jack Pocock, top re

The Webfoots hope to get back
on the win trail and duplicate last
season's finish. Last year the
Ducks won five of their last six
games, four by shutouts, losing
only to Stanford, 44-7. They closed
their season by smashing arch
rival Oregon State, 28-0, after the
Beavers had enjoyed one of their
best years.
Anything but pushovers.

Jack Poeoek will be a line starter come Saturday. He lias been a
valuable asset, to the Oregon team, tilling various holes iu the line

If they can hang on to the ball,
Oregon's "pony" barks might

of trouble in Saturday's clash at

a fumble on the Oregon 1, setting
