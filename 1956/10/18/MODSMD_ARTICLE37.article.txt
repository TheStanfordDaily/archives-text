Last week Stanford's defensive
backs stopped San Jose State's
potent passing attack. The man
behind the scenes that deserves
a pat on the back is Stanford's
backfield coach, Pete Kmetovic,
who prepared the defensive
backs.
Coach Kmetovic has been the
Indians' backfield coach since
1950, and he has helped to develop
such backs as Gary Kerkorian,
Bob Mathias, Bob Garrett, Bill
Tarr and John Brodie. His du
ties also include scouting high
school players, spotting the
team's mistakes during a game
and coaching rugby when football
season is over.
Pete Kmetovic came to Stan
ford in 1938 as a freshman stu
dent. In 1939 he played tailback
on the football team, sharing the
position with Frankie Albert.
"Frankie (fid the passing and I
did the running," Pete explained.
In 1940 Stanford shifted to the
T-formation with Albert at quar
terback and Kmetovic at half
back. Stanford was undefeated
that year, playing Nebraska in
the Rose Bowl. With Albert pass
ing for one touchdown and Kmet

ovic returning a punt for another
ihe Indians won the Rose Bowl
classic, 21-13.
Pete graduated from Stanford
in 1942 and he served in Ihe
Navy from 1942 to 1945. He
played professional football for
the Philadelphia Eagles in 1946
and the Detroit Lions in 1947.
Kmetovic began his coaching
career at San Bernardino High in
1948. In 1949 he became frosh
coach at the University of San
Francisco and the next year ho
returned to Stanford as backfield
coach.
On this week's gyme with Ore
gon, Coach Kmetovic said, "They
don't have a good passing attack;
however, I think Jim Shanley is
one of the best runners in the
conference."

Last week Stanford's defensive
backs stopped San Jose State's
potent passing attack. The man
behind the scenes that deserves
a pat on the back is Stanford's
backfield coach, Pete Kmetovic,
who prepared the defensive
backs.
Coach Kmetovic has been the
Indians' backfield coach since
1950, and he has helped to develop
such backs as Gary Kerkorian,
Bob Mathias, Bob Garrett, Bill
Tarr and John Brodie. His du
ties also include scouting high
school players, spotting the
team's mistakes during a game
and coaching rugby when football
season is over.
Pete Kmetovic came to Stan
ford in 1938 as a freshman stu
dent. In 1939 he played tailback
on the football team, sharing the
position with Frankie Albert.
"Frankie (fid the passing and I
did the running," Pete explained.
In 1940 Stanford shifted to the
T-formation with Albert at quar
terback and Kmetovic at half
back. Stanford was undefeated
that year, playing Nebraska in
the Rose Bowl. With Albert pass
ing for one touchdown and Kmet

ovic returning a punt for another
ihe Indians won the Rose Bowl
classic, 21-13.
Pete graduated from Stanford
in 1942 and he served in Ihe
Navy from 1942 to 1945. He
played professional football for
the Philadelphia Eagles in 1946
and the Detroit Lions in 1947.
Kmetovic began his coaching
career at San Bernardino High in
1948. In 1949 he became frosh
coach at the University of San
Francisco and the next year ho
returned to Stanford as backfield
coach.
