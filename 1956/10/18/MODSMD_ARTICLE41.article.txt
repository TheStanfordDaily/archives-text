# Sequoia begins Second Year Of Publication in New Quarters
## 
### 
Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, begins its second year
of publication this quarter.
This year the magazine has es-
I 'blished permanent headquarters
in temporary building A, finally
giving the staff a large office
area in which to work.
According to Editor Don Shoup,
Stanford students write all of the
material for each issue with the
exception of one feature written
by an authority outside of the
University. Last year Sequoia
published articles in this category
by Howard Mumford Jones and
Malcolm Cowley.
Head by Staff
Each article which Sequoia re
ceives is placed in a file where all
staff members have a chance to
read it.
After the staff members have
read the submitted manuscript, it
comes before the eight â€¢ member
editorial board for 1 consideration.
The board members discuss the
article and then vote whether or
not to accept it.
Sequoia is published between
two and four times a year, the
usual number of issues being
three (once a quarter).
The number of times the maga
zine is published depends upon
the quality of the material sub
milted, according to Shoup. "If

we don't have sufficient good ma
terial for an issue, we don't pub
lish one."
Encourages Writing
The objective of Sequoia is to
encourage good writing from
Stanford students, Shoup empha
sized.
Sequoia has received recogni
tion from non-campus sources for
! the quality of its articles and sto
ries. For instance, the University
; of Minnesota's literary magazine
i asked and received permission to
reprint Dan Cohen's article on
Thomas Heggan (author of "Mis
ter Roberts").
This year Sequoia has expanded
its editorial and business staffs to
accommodate an unlimited num
ber of students, and Sequoia in
vites all interested to join.
