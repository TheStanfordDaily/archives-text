LONDON, Oct. 17 (UP) Iron
Curtain reports said today Com
munist China is joining Russia's
European satellites in a snow
balling effort to break away from
Soviet authority.
One Asiatic diplomat in close
touch with the situation said the
Communists in China, "more self
assured than ever," are showing
an increasing inclination to fol
low the "independent path" pio
neered by Yugoslav President
Tito.
There have been growing indi
cations in the past week that Po
land is meditating a Tito â€¢ style
break with the Kremlin, and yes
terday it was reported China's
President Mao Tse-tung is aiding
the Polish effort.
Newspapers in London and
Paris said today that Red leaders
in Poland are demanding the with
drawal of Soviet troops, believed
to total at least four divisions.
The London Daily Telegraph
said also thai the Reds are de
manding the dismissal of "a large
number of Soviet officers" from
the Polish armed forces. It was
not clear whether this would in
clude Russian Marshal Konstan
tin Rokossovsky, installed several
years ago as Poland's defense
minister.
