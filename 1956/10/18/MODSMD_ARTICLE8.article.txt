### Dick Meister 
Graduate student Lloyd Down
ton, who kicked off a campaign
to lower California's legal drink
ing age over KZSU last week, was
fired by the station yesterday.
Station Manager Terry Bate
man explained that Downton had
"violated broadcasting rules for
the second time" by reading "ob
scene" poetry over KZSU in a Fri
day night broadcast.
Downton has countered with
charges of "ulterior motives." He
said the poetry (a passage by
modern impressionist Walter Ben
ton ) »''was not obscene" and the
actual reasons for the firing stem
med from fear of the University's
Board of Trustees in connection
with the liquor issue.
Financial Reason?
The trustees are meeting this
week to consider the station's up
coming budget. "All they [KZSU]
are worried about is that budget
of theirs," Downton said.
Bateman said the real issue was
Downton's violation of broadcast
ing rules. Last spring %the an
nouncer reported an imaginary
hydrogen bomb fallout as "an ex
periment in rumor." Although he
explained the nature of the pro
gram before and after the broad
cast, he was warned against fur
ther rule violations.
The announcer claimed that
Benton was "one of the greatest
modern poets" and that he asked
his listeners before Friday's pro
gram to call him at the station if
they found anything in the broad
cast to be objectionable. lie re
ceived no calls.
KZSU "Lab"
Such programs, Downton claim
ed, are a part of KZSU's function
as an "experimental" station. "If
we can't try experiments on a stu
dent station," he said, "where else
can we do it?
"The station is supposed to be
a lab, but they don't try anything
new."
As for the drinking-age contro
versy, Downton said KZSU direc
tors had originally encouraged his
stand as "good publicity," then
backed down when they felt the
faculty might be against the po
sition.
Bateman said KZSU intends to
remain neutral on the drinking
question, so as to give equal time
to those favoring either side of
the controversy—including Down
ton.
"I'm not about to restrict free
dom of speech." Bateman said.
Downton can express his views -
but not in the name of the sta
tion."

KZSU "Lab"
Such programs, Downton claim
ed, are a part of KZSU's function
as an "experimental" station. "If
we can't try experiments on a stu

tors had originally encouraged his
stand as "good publicity," then

are worried about is that budget
of theirs," Downton said.
