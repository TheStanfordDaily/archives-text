# Khedry Hits West's Plan For Canal
## Tells Large Audience Suez Proposals Mean Collective Colonialism 
### 
Egyptian Consul Abdul Monei
mel Khedry yesterday delivered a
scathing attack on the part the
Western powers have played in
the Sue/, Canal controversy.
Speaking before 120 persons
packed into every chair or bit of
floor in Bowman Alumni House,
Khedry condemned Western pro
posals for internationalizing the
canal as "collective colonialism."
In the second Institute of In
ternational Relations consul talk
of the year, he maintained such
proposals are in violation of
Egypt's "right of sovereignty"
over the canal.
His country earned such sov
ereignly, ho asserted, by the labor
and money it expended to build
tlie Suez. "One hundred and twen
ty thousand Egyptians died dig
ging the canal," he said.
English Violation
First nation to violate the
canal's neutrality was not Egypt,
the consul said, but England.
England prevented certain na
tions' shipping from pas sing
through I lie canal's locks as early
as 18(52 and as recently as World
War 11, he explained.
He said ill management of the
canal by the international com
pany which ran it until July was
a principal reason why his coun
try seized the waterway.
"This company made only mi
nor improvements, to the neglect
of the major works that were bad
ly needed," Khedry asserted.
He said one of Egypt's pur
poses in nationalizing the Suez
was to expand the canal and in
crease its efficiency.
Conference Invitation
After the canal seizure the
Western powers issued invitations
to 21 nations to attend a confer
ence on the Suez crisis.
Commenting on the invitations,
the consul said bitterly: "Invita
tions were sent to 24 nations with
out even consulting Egypt, owner
of (he canal. . . . The conference
was limited to 24 nations, al
though the number using the
canal in 1955 was 45 nations."
For this reason, he stressed, his
country declined its invitation and
thus doomed the conference to
failure.
Five-Nation Committee
"The five-nation committee also
failed because Egypt refused to
accept infringement of its rights
over the canal."
Such attempts to international
ize the canal will not work, the
consul said, because there is no
international government to en
force such a move. "Only Egypt
can enforce the law of. nations
there."

ty thousand Egyptians died dig
ging the canal," he said.
English Violation
First nation to violate the
canal's neutrality was not Egypt,
the consul said, but England.
England prevented certain na
tions' shipping from pas sing
through I lie canal's locks as early
as 18(52 and as recently as World
War 11, he explained.
He said ill management of the
canal by the international com
pany which ran it until July was
a principal reason why his coun
try seized the waterway.
"This company made only mi
nor improvements, to the neglect
of the major works that were bad
ly needed," Khedry asserted.
He said one of Egypt's pur
poses in nationalizing the Suez
was to expand the canal and in
crease its efficiency.
Conference Invitation
After the canal seizure the
Western powers issued invitations
to 21 nations to attend a confer
ence on the Suez crisis.
Commenting on the invitations,
the consul said bitterly: "Invita
tions were sent to 24 nations with
out even consulting Egypt, owner
of (he canal. . . . The conference
was limited to 24 nations, al
though the number using the
canal in 1955 was 45 nations."
For this reason, he stressed, his
country declined its invitation and
thus doomed the conference to
failure.
Five-Nation Committee
"The five-nation committee also
failed because Egypt refused to
accept infringement of its rights
over the canal."
Such attempts to international
ize the canal will not work, the
consul said, because there is no
international government to en
force such a move. "Only Egypt
can enforce the law of. nations
there."
Egyptian Consul Abdul Monei
mel Khedry yesterday delivered a
scathing attack on the part the
Western powers have played in
the Sue/, Canal controversy.
Speaking before 120 persons
packed into every chair or bit of
floor in Bowman Alumni House,
Khedry condemned Western pro
posals for internationalizing the
canal as "collective colonialism."
In the second Institute of In
ternational Relations consul talk
of the year, he maintained such
proposals are in violation of
Egypt's "right of sovereignty"
over the canal.
His country earned such sov
ereignly, ho asserted, by the labor
and money it expended to build
tlie Suez. "One hundred and twen
ty thousand Egyptians died dig
ging the canal," he said.
