### Sally Trapnell 
The Republicans are running on a record of peace and prosperity
and have had nothing to do with the coming of either, according to
the Democratic side of the Political Union debate at Cubberley Audi
torium last night.
Speaking before an audienc£ of nearly 100, the Democrats pre-

scniea irus argument m lavui 01
returning their party to power,-
According to Ernie Hartz, the
Republicans found a truce in Ko
rea when they took over and
since thou tlif Kremlin has taken
a new line which doesn't include
open war. The GOP's contribu
tion has been nil.
As to prosperity, Hartz stated
that no Republican legislation has
contributed to this state, that all
aids to the economy came from
Roosevelt's and Truman's admin
istration.
Swallowed New D<>al
Hartz stated that there are
many flaws in the current pros
perity, problem:; such as agricul
ture, whi c h the Republicans
haven't solved.
Speaking for the Republicans,
Mike Hudson answered this ar
gument by saying that the Demo
crats take credit for all the good
things they did, and then criticize
the Republicans for not solving
problems left by the Democrats.
A State of Mind
lie claimed that both peace and
prosperity are a state of mind,

Canal crises were solved by Re
publican intervention are more
important than cold figures.
Hudson pointed to Ino fact thai
the Eisenhower administration in
herited a huge deficit and bal
aneed the national budget for the
first time since 1032.
John Kalchi, wlv> spoke next for
the Democrats, look issue with
Hudson on the Republican for
eign policy. He said that the Re
publicans had no part in the Indo
china settlement and that Nixon
had alienated many neutrals by
his statements in Pakistan.
Domestic Policy
Ho also pointed to deficiencies
in GOP domestic policy such as
the Hells Canyon and Dixon-Yates
giveaway, and the cuts in Air
Force appropriations.
Steve Nye, the second Republi
can speaker, challenged the Dem
ocrats to state what they were
standing on, the record of past
administrations or Stevenson's
current promises.
Th» Democrats came back with
•a. defense of the Democratic can
didate's H-bomb program and ex
amples of past New Deal legis
lation such as social security and
banking reforms.
Asked for examples of Eisen
hower legislation, Nye named the
Austrian peace treaty, West Ger
many's entrance inlo NA TO and
the atoms-for'-peace program.
