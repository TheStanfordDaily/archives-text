# Invasion of Privacy

### 
If you want to find out someone's grades, all
you have to do is to run down to the Cashier's
Office, plunk 50 cents on the counter and re
ceive in return a publication aptly termed "the
Bawlout."
Officially known as "University Directory,"
the 300-page book lists all students and faculty
membersâ€”their names, home towns and cam
pus addresses. But more important to many
students, it also includes the information of
how much plus or minus each undergraduate
in the University has got,.
T1 lis tradition was started back in the early
years of the University with the thought that
Stanford students are here in competition with
each other, and that printing their grades in
the official directory would give them addi
tional academic stimulus. The practice was
abandoned for a few years during the 19405,
but when the same information started to come
out in departmental" bulletins and releases, it
was decided to resume campus-wide publica
tion of grades.
Basically the philosophy behind the Bawlout
is wrong. Stanford prides itself upon being the
leading educational institution on the West
Coast, a university where a student can go to

educate and better himself personally, regard
less ol' what others do.
Hut the Bawlout definitely does not exem
plify this spirit. It .states, for all to read, the
grades of each individual student so that he or
she may h< j compared with others.
Perhaps even more important, the Bawlout
represents a basic inconsistency in University
policy. No transcript of a student's grades at
the University is sent to another school or a
prospective employer without the personal ap
proval ol the student involved. The theory is
that such information is private to the student
and shouldn't he released unless he agrees.
Yet anyone with 50 cents can easily obtain
this information.
Student opinion on the subject seems to
range from apathy to opposition. The main
reason given for the grades seems to he that
they aid the faculty in finding out academic
information about students.
It would appear that such information could
just as easily be obtained from records in the
Registrar's office or in the student's major de
partment.
I he invasion of privacy and the overemphasis
on pure plus-and-minus competition dictates
that grades in the Bawlout are unnecessary.
