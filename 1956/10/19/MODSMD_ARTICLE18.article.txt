# CAMPUS OPINION
## Should the Bawlout Give Grades? 
### 
Many Stanford students have
decided opinions on whether or
not grades should be printed in
the University Directory. Some
of their comments are:
Helton Fleisher, '57, off-campus:
"The main purpose of publishing
students' grades in the Bawlout
seems to be to make it easier for
many nosy members of the stu
dent body to round out their
knowledge of their comrades' per
sonal lives.
"The very fact that no grade
averages or plus points are pub
lished for graduate students indi
cates that publication of those for
undergraduates is of extremely
limited value."
Sally Drinker, 'AO, Kranner: "A
person might get a complex by
comparing his grades with others.
Be- ides, I don't think it's anyone's
business but mine what my grades
are."
Wes Lachnian, *58, Wilbur spon
sor: "I don't think this practice
seriously invades anyone's priva

cy, and people seldom look in Hip
Bawloul for grades. Why worry
about it?"
Rita Robison, 'CO, Branner: "I
don't th in k a person's grades
should appear in the Bawlout.
Grades, because of the grading
I curve, do not necessarily show
how much a person knows. Even
I in a class of brains 15 per cent
would automatically get D's."
Claudia Lcnsch, '59, Lagunita:
| "Grades are a private matter and
of concern only to the individual
himself. The purpose of publish
ing grades is nebulous."
-lanet Bennett, '57, Jordan: "I
don't think a person's grades
j should be on public display. I
I can't think of any conceivable rea
| son why people want to see other
people's grades anyway. I'd rather
judge a person on his personality
than on the amount of plus points
, he has acquired."
Carol Griffith, '59, Lagnnita:
| "It's your own personal business
I what kind of grades you are get

j ling. There's no reason for print
ing them except to satisfy other
people's curiosity."
Heywood Mansergh, graduate,
Village: "The grades should be
printed. I'm just nosy. I usually
look up the plus points of the
girls I go out with. I like them
lo be relatively high but not so
high that I think she's smarter
than I."
Ron Heber, '57, Stern: "The
practice is bad because sometimes
some person has a harder time in
getting grades than do others,
and the grades they have certainly
do not always give a true impres
sion."
John Shepard, '57, off-campus:
"Personally, I have no objection
to having my grades printed in
the Bawlout, but I see no practical
reason for publishing students'
grade point averages. I think a
more simple student directory, in
eluding just names, addresses and
major subjects, would be ade
quate."

Claudia Lcnsch, '59, Lagunita:

of concern only to the individual
himself. The purpose of publish

-lanet Bennett, '57, Jordan: "I
don't think a person's grades

I can't think of any conceivable rea

people's grades anyway. I'd rather
judge a person on his personality

Carol Griffith, '59, Lagnnita:

people's curiosity."
Heywood Mansergh, graduate,
Village: "The grades should be
printed. I'm just nosy. I usually
look up the plus points of the
girls I go out with. I like them
lo be relatively high but not so
high that I think she's smarter
than I."
Ron Heber, '57, Stern: "The
practice is bad because sometimes
some person has a harder time in
getting grades than do others,
and the grades they have certainly
do not always give a true impres
sion."
John Shepard, '57, off-campus:
"Personally, I have no objection
to having my grades printed in
the Bawlout, but I see no practical
reason for publishing students'
grade point averages. I think a
more simple student directory, in
eluding just names, addresses and
major subjects, would be ade
quate."
Many Stanford students have
decided opinions on whether or
not grades should be printed in
the University Directory. Some
of their comments are:
Helton Fleisher, '57, off-campus:
"The main purpose of publishing
students' grades in the Bawlout
seems to be to make it easier for
many nosy members of the stu
dent body to round out their
knowledge of their comrades' per
sonal lives.
"The very fact that no grade
averages or plus points are pub
lished for graduate students indi
cates that publication of those for
undergraduates is of extremely
limited value."
Sally Drinker, 'AO, Kranner: "A
person might get a complex by
comparing his grades with others.
Be- ides, I don't think it's anyone's
business but mine what my grades
are."
Wes Lachnian, *58, Wilbur spon
sor: "I don't think this practice
seriously invades anyone's priva

cy, and people seldom look in Hip
Bawloul for grades. Why worry
about it?"
Rita Robison, 'CO, Branner: "I
don't th in k a person's grades
should appear in the Bawlout.
Grades, because of the grading
I curve, do not necessarily show
how much a person knows. Even
I in a class of brains 15 per cent
would automatically get D's."
