WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (UP) â€”
Scientists said today a newly dis
covered antibiotic suggests that
the wonder drugs eventually may
give man his long-sought weapon
against cancer.
Ihe new drug aiazopeptin
proved highly active against ex
perimental cancer in mice, appar
ently even destroying the tumor
transplants in some cases. It has
not proved active so far in human
patients.
But Dr. Henry Welch, expert
on antibiotics for the Food and
Drug Administration, said it is
significant because it is "new evi
dence that antibiotics may some
flay turn out to be the answer to
cancer."
