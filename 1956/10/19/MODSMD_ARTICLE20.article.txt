Students Lack Gumption
Editor, The Daily:
The reaction of many students in regard to the
drinking problem seems to tie that they are will
ing to break the law, but they do not have ihe
gumption to stick their necks out and change it.
There are very few undergraduates who have
never had a drink, and it appears there are only
50 or so who support Downton's proposal.
Even Legislature does not have the courage
to act on this matter. The campuses of foreign
universities are usually breeding grounds lor
radical ideas. It seems that our students do not
know what to do with a radical idea when it is
thrown in their laps.

Is Drinking "Progress"?
Editor, The Daily:
Since Lloyd Downton's Wellesian "experiment"
in rumor last spring, 1 have been wondering what
he would do next in order to see his name mis
spelled in print. 1 am surprised that he has
thought up a scheme as hackneyed as that of
lowering the drinking age.
This sort of idea is so old that it appears as
theme material on college English placement
examinations. Not too long ago the matter was
put up to the student body in Ihe form of a re
quest that the ASSLI send an official document
to the state legislature requesting reduction of
the legal age. The request was voted down,
strangely enough, by students under 21.
The students have not joined the cause this
time either.. ("Not one person has offered to help
me with the petition job.") Downton has retali
ated by stamping his foot . . . "if 1he students
don't have enough courage to participate in my
petition, then I have my doubts whether the.y can
shoulder the responsibility lot vote ... I will
give up on the possibility of them [student:;] ever
being a powerful political force . . ."
It seems that the students have made it quite
clear that they are not interested. Truly, Lloyd,
you are a rebel without a c\iuso.

Editor, The Daily:
Admitting that Lloyd Downton advanced some
pretty specious arguments, 1 would like to con
tribute mine.
Twenty-one is an arbitrary age limit. Maturity
is neither reached nor does it stop there. There
is no more justification for making 21 the age
limit than there'is for making 20 or 22 the limit.
My point is thai it is more logical to pick IK
as the arbitrary limit than to pick 21.
Consider the facts of life. At 18, in the majority
of cases, you graduate from high school and go
away to college and/or begin work and/or get
married. In any one of these eventualities you
are expected to acl like an adult. Yet legally you
mustjkvait three more years to participate in adult
activities. Why?
Eighteen, not .21, is the age in the majority of
cases when you break away from home and
assume adult responsibilities . . . and logically
the privileges of being an adult.
This concept is already recognized in some
states. Why not in California?

What would Ihe liquor authorities think of a
plan in which registered identification cards are
issued to 38-year-olds and older, with parental
consent, for the purchase of alcoholic beverages,
such cards to be revocable upon violation of the
existing statutes pertaining to the purchase and
consumption of alcoholic beverages?
Ken Ilamniett
Migli School Drinking Problem
Editor, The Daily:
Leaders of the current campaign to promote
a change in the legal age for drinking have dis-

cussed the effects that such a change would have
on the campus.
But they seem to ignore the fact that the
campus is not the only area that would be af
fected by a change. What about high schools,
for instance?
Perhaps a change in the law would be a more
"realistic" approach to tho drinking issue as it
applies to the campus. Hut a law allowing IS
year-olds to buy and consume alcoholic beverages,
which would allow almost all college students to
drink within the law, would merely pass on a big
problem to the high schools.
They would be faced with the same problem
now confronting colleges and universities how
to deal with student bodies in which some stu
dents are allowed by law to drink and some aren't.
. . . And the ABC and school officials would
have to police a far more immature group con
sisting of 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds.
What "appears to be a solution to a campus
problem might well create new problems outside
its boundaries.

I note with some amusement two closely-run
Daily editorials this week: one belaboring certain
fraternities for' their backwardness, the other
praising certain petitioners for their "progres
siveness."
The Daily is somewhat inconsistent in applying
its labels.
As an old fraternity man, I am grudgingly
ready to concede that our old attitude loward
llell Week may have been backward, particularly
in view of the constructive uses to which that
period has been put by some more enlightened
houses. It goes without saying lhat it is a sign
of progress when students begin to devote their
time and minds to constructive rather than de
structive activities.
So The Daily has equated responsibility with
progress, but then it has also equated underage
drinking with progress, and it would then follow
that The Daily must equate underage drinking
with responsibility. Are we to assume that an
18-year-old, or a 25-year-old for that matter, is
more capable of assuming responsibility if he
has a few good snorts under his belt?
Some years ago fraternity irresponsibility and
hell-raising were so ingrained in the students'
way of life that it was inconceivable that the pat
tern could be changed, but over the years pro
gressive forces have worked to change that pat
tern, and not the least forceful has been The
Daily. '
Similarly, it seems inconceivable thai the pat
tern of underage drinking can be changed. If
The Daily is for progressiveness and cannot, on
reflection, reconcile a minor's drinking with his
assuming responsibility, then it might take up
the challenge ... in some future editorial.
George Denny
(Ed. Note : The Daily's position is thai the law
as such is not "progressive" or "responsible,"
for it fails to recognize tint I persons under 21
will drink regardless of the law. VVe feel the
reasons we gave in our editorial Oct. 8 for
changing the law outweigh the reasons given
against changing it, and thus feel that the law
should be written from a more realistic ap
proach.)

Re your "school spirit" editorial: Get some
short, peppy cheers that grow in volume, instead
of the dead, awkward, single-phrased, dragged-out
cheers that have no chance to build, and you will
see a difference in the cheering at football games.
Poor cheers are the main reason for poor cheer
ing, not the lack of school spirit.

I note with some amusement two closely-run
Daily editorials this week: one belaboring certain
fraternities for' their backwardness, the other
praising certain petitioners for their "progres
siveness."
The Daily is somewhat inconsistent in applying
its labels.
As an old fraternity man, I am grudgingly
ready to concede that our old attitude loward
llell Week may have been backward, particularly
in view of the constructive uses to which that
period has been put by some more enlightened
houses. It goes without saying lhat it is a sign
of progress when students begin to devote their
time and minds to constructive rather than de
structive activities.
So The Daily has equated responsibility with
progress, but then it has also equated underage
drinking with progress, and it would then follow
that The Daily must equate underage drinking
with responsibility. Are we to assume that an
18-year-old, or a 25-year-old for that matter, is
more capable of assuming responsibility if he
has a few good snorts under his belt?
Some years ago fraternity irresponsibility and
hell-raising were so ingrained in the students'
way of life that it was inconceivable that the pat
tern could be changed, but over the years pro
gressive forces have worked to change that pat
tern, and not the least forceful has been The
Daily. '
Similarly, it seems inconceivable thai the pat
tern of underage drinking can be changed. If
The Daily is for progressiveness and cannot, on
reflection, reconcile a minor's drinking with his
assuming responsibility, then it might take up
the challenge ... in some future editorial.
George Denny
(Ed. Note : The Daily's position is thai the law
as such is not "progressive" or "responsible,"
for it fails to recognize tint I persons under 21
will drink regardless of the law. VVe feel the
reasons we gave in our editorial Oct. 8 for
changing the law outweigh the reasons given
against changing it, and thus feel that the law
should be written from a more realistic ap
proach.)

Students Lack Gumption
Editor, The Daily:
The reaction of many students in regard to the
drinking problem seems to tie that they are will
ing to break the law, but they do not have ihe
gumption to stick their necks out and change it.
There are very few undergraduates who have
never had a drink, and it appears there are only
50 or so who support Downton's proposal.
Even Legislature does not have the courage
to act on this matter. The campuses of foreign
universities are usually breeding grounds lor
radical ideas. It seems that our students do not
know what to do with a radical idea when it is
thrown in their laps.

Is Drinking "Progress"?
Editor, The Daily:
Since Lloyd Downton's Wellesian "experiment"
in rumor last spring, 1 have been wondering what
he would do next in order to see his name mis
spelled in print. 1 am surprised that he has
thought up a scheme as hackneyed as that of
lowering the drinking age.
This sort of idea is so old that it appears as
theme material on college English placement
examinations. Not too long ago the matter was
put up to the student body in Ihe form of a re
quest that the ASSLI send an official document
to the state legislature requesting reduction of
the legal age. The request was voted down,
strangely enough, by students under 21.
The students have not joined the cause this
time either.. ("Not one person has offered to help
me with the petition job.") Downton has retali
ated by stamping his foot . . . "if 1he students
don't have enough courage to participate in my
petition, then I have my doubts whether the.y can
shoulder the responsibility lot vote ... I will
give up on the possibility of them [student:;] ever
being a powerful political force . . ."
It seems that the students have made it quite
clear that they are not interested. Truly, Lloyd,
you are a rebel without a c\iuso.

Admitting that Lloyd Downton advanced some
pretty specious arguments, 1 would like to con
tribute mine.
Twenty-one is an arbitrary age limit. Maturity
is neither reached nor does it stop there. There
is no more justification for making 21 the age
limit than there'is for making 20 or 22 the limit.
My point is thai it is more logical to pick IK
as the arbitrary limit than to pick 21.
Consider the facts of life. At 18, in the majority
of cases, you graduate from high school and go
away to college and/or begin work and/or get
married. In any one of these eventualities you
are expected to acl like an adult. Yet legally you
mustjkvait three more years to participate in adult
activities. Why?
Eighteen, not .21, is the age in the majority of
cases when you break away from home and
assume adult responsibilities . . . and logically
the privileges of being an adult.
This concept is already recognized in some
states. Why not in California?

Is Drinking "Progress"?
Editor, The Daily:
Since Lloyd Downton's Wellesian "experiment"
in rumor last spring, 1 have been wondering what
he would do next in order to see his name mis
spelled in print. 1 am surprised that he has
thought up a scheme as hackneyed as that of
lowering the drinking age.
This sort of idea is so old that it appears as
theme material on college English placement
examinations. Not too long ago the matter was
put up to the student body in Ihe form of a re
quest that the ASSLI send an official document
to the state legislature requesting reduction of
the legal age. The request was voted down,
strangely enough, by students under 21.
The students have not joined the cause this
time either.. ("Not one person has offered to help
me with the petition job.") Downton has retali
ated by stamping his foot . . . "if 1he students
don't have enough courage to participate in my
petition, then I have my doubts whether the.y can
shoulder the responsibility lot vote ... I will
give up on the possibility of them [student:;] ever
being a powerful political force . . ."
It seems that the students have made it quite
clear that they are not interested. Truly, Lloyd,
you are a rebel without a c\iuso.

Admitting that Lloyd Downton advanced some
pretty specious arguments, 1 would like to con
tribute mine.
Twenty-one is an arbitrary age limit. Maturity
is neither reached nor does it stop there. There
is no more justification for making 21 the age
limit than there'is for making 20 or 22 the limit.
My point is thai it is more logical to pick IK
as the arbitrary limit than to pick 21.
Consider the facts of life. At 18, in the majority
of cases, you graduate from high school and go
away to college and/or begin work and/or get
married. In any one of these eventualities you
are expected to acl like an adult. Yet legally you
mustjkvait three more years to participate in adult
activities. Why?
Eighteen, not .21, is the age in the majority of
cases when you break away from home and
assume adult responsibilities . . . and logically
the privileges of being an adult.
This concept is already recognized in some
states. Why not in California?

What would Ihe liquor authorities think of a

Migli School Drinking Problem
Editor, The Daily:
Leaders of the current campaign to promote
a change in the legal age for drinking have dis-

cussed the effects that such a change would have
on the campus.
But they seem to ignore the fact that the
campus is not the only area that would be af
fected by a change. What about high schools,
for instance?
Perhaps a change in the law would be a more
"realistic" approach to tho drinking issue as it
applies to the campus. Hut a law allowing IS
year-olds to buy and consume alcoholic beverages,
which would allow almost all college students to
drink within the law, would merely pass on a big
problem to the high schools.
They would be faced with the same problem
now confronting colleges and universities how
to deal with student bodies in which some stu
dents are allowed by law to drink and some aren't.
. . . And the ABC and school officials would
have to police a far more immature group con
sisting of 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds.
What "appears to be a solution to a campus
problem might well create new problems outside
its boundaries.

I note with some amusement two closely-run
Daily editorials this week: one belaboring certain
fraternities for' their backwardness, the other
praising certain petitioners for their "progres
siveness."
The Daily is somewhat inconsistent in applying
its labels.
As an old fraternity man, I am grudgingly
ready to concede that our old attitude loward
llell Week may have been backward, particularly
in view of the constructive uses to which that
period has been put by some more enlightened
houses. It goes without saying lhat it is a sign
of progress when students begin to devote their
time and minds to constructive rather than de
structive activities.
So The Daily has equated responsibility with
progress, but then it has also equated underage
drinking with progress, and it would then follow
that The Daily must equate underage drinking
with responsibility. Are we to assume that an
18-year-old, or a 25-year-old for that matter, is
more capable of assuming responsibility if he
has a few good snorts under his belt?
Some years ago fraternity irresponsibility and
hell-raising were so ingrained in the students'
way of life that it was inconceivable that the pat
tern could be changed, but over the years pro
gressive forces have worked to change that pat
tern, and not the least forceful has been The
Daily. '
Similarly, it seems inconceivable thai the pat
tern of underage drinking can be changed. If
The Daily is for progressiveness and cannot, on
reflection, reconcile a minor's drinking with his
assuming responsibility, then it might take up
the challenge ... in some future editorial.
George Denny
(Ed. Note : The Daily's position is thai the law
as such is not "progressive" or "responsible,"
for it fails to recognize tint I persons under 21
will drink regardless of the law. VVe feel the
reasons we gave in our editorial Oct. 8 for
changing the law outweigh the reasons given
against changing it, and thus feel that the law
should be written from a more realistic ap
proach.)

There are very few undergraduates who have
never had a drink, and it appears there are only
50 or so who support Downton's proposal.

I note with some amusement two closely-run
Daily editorials this week: one belaboring certain
fraternities for' their backwardness, the other
praising certain petitioners for their "progres
siveness."
The Daily is somewhat inconsistent in applying
its labels.
As an old fraternity man, I am grudgingly
ready to concede that our old attitude loward
llell Week may have been backward, particularly
in view of the constructive uses to which that
period has been put by some more enlightened
houses. It goes without saying lhat it is a sign
of progress when students begin to devote their
time and minds to constructive rather than de
structive activities.
So The Daily has equated responsibility with
progress, but then it has also equated underage
drinking with progress, and it would then follow
that The Daily must equate underage drinking
with responsibility. Are we to assume that an
18-year-old, or a 25-year-old for that matter, is
more capable of assuming responsibility if he
has a few good snorts under his belt?
Some years ago fraternity irresponsibility and
hell-raising were so ingrained in the students'
way of life that it was inconceivable that the pat
tern could be changed, but over the years pro
gressive forces have worked to change that pat
tern, and not the least forceful has been The
Daily. '
Similarly, it seems inconceivable thai the pat
tern of underage drinking can be changed. If
The Daily is for progressiveness and cannot, on
reflection, reconcile a minor's drinking with his
assuming responsibility, then it might take up
the challenge ... in some future editorial.
George Denny
(Ed. Note : The Daily's position is thai the law
as such is not "progressive" or "responsible,"
for it fails to recognize tint I persons under 21
will drink regardless of the law. VVe feel the
reasons we gave in our editorial Oct. 8 for
changing the law outweigh the reasons given
against changing it, and thus feel that the law
should be written from a more realistic ap
proach.)

Editor, The Daily:
Re your "school spirit" editorial: Get some
short, peppy cheers that grow in volume, instead
of the dead, awkward, single-phrased, dragged-out
cheers that have no chance to build, and you will
see a difference in the cheering at football games.
Poor cheers are the main reason for poor cheer
ing, not the lack of school spirit.

Students Lack Gumption
Editor, The Daily:
The reaction of many students in regard to the
drinking problem seems to tie that they are will
ing to break the law, but they do not have ihe
gumption to stick their necks out and change it.
There are very few undergraduates who have
never had a drink, and it appears there are only
50 or so who support Downton's proposal.
Even Legislature does not have the courage
to act on this matter. The campuses of foreign
universities are usually breeding grounds lor
radical ideas. It seems that our students do not
know what to do with a radical idea when it is
thrown in their laps.

Is Drinking "Progress"?
Editor, The Daily:
Since Lloyd Downton's Wellesian "experiment"
in rumor last spring, 1 have been wondering what
he would do next in order to see his name mis
spelled in print. 1 am surprised that he has
thought up a scheme as hackneyed as that of
lowering the drinking age.
This sort of idea is so old that it appears as
theme material on college English placement
examinations. Not too long ago the matter was
put up to the student body in Ihe form of a re
quest that the ASSLI send an official document
to the state legislature requesting reduction of
the legal age. The request was voted down,
strangely enough, by students under 21.
The students have not joined the cause this
time either.. ("Not one person has offered to help
me with the petition job.") Downton has retali
ated by stamping his foot . . . "if 1he students
don't have enough courage to participate in my
petition, then I have my doubts whether the.y can
shoulder the responsibility lot vote ... I will
give up on the possibility of them [student:;] ever
being a powerful political force . . ."
It seems that the students have made it quite
clear that they are not interested. Truly, Lloyd,
you are a rebel without a c\iuso.

18 More Logical Tli an 2 I
Editor, The Daily:
Admitting that Lloyd Downton advanced some
pretty specious arguments, 1 would like to con
tribute mine.
Twenty-one is an arbitrary age limit. Maturity
is neither reached nor does it stop there. There
is no more justification for making 21 the age
limit than there'is for making 20 or 22 the limit.
My point is thai it is more logical to pick IK
as the arbitrary limit than to pick 21.
Consider the facts of life. At 18, in the majority
of cases, you graduate from high school and go
away to college and/or begin work and/or get
married. In any one of these eventualities you
are expected to acl like an adult. Yet legally you
mustjkvait three more years to participate in adult
activities. Why?
Eighteen, not .21, is the age in the majority of
cases when you break away from home and
assume adult responsibilities . . . and logically
the privileges of being an adult.
This concept is already recognized in some
states. Why not in California?

What would Ihe liquor authorities think of a
plan in which registered identification cards are
issued to 38-year-olds and older, with parental
consent, for the purchase of alcoholic beverages,
such cards to be revocable upon violation of the
existing statutes pertaining to the purchase and
consumption of alcoholic beverages?
Ken Ilamniett
Migli School Drinking Problem
Editor, The Daily:
Leaders of the current campaign to promote
a change in the legal age for drinking have dis-

cussed the effects that such a change would have
on the campus.
But they seem to ignore the fact that the
campus is not the only area that would be af
fected by a change. What about high schools,
for instance?
Perhaps a change in the law would be a more
"realistic" approach to tho drinking issue as it
applies to the campus. Hut a law allowing IS
year-olds to buy and consume alcoholic beverages,
which would allow almost all college students to
drink within the law, would merely pass on a big
problem to the high schools.
They would be faced with the same problem
now confronting colleges and universities how
to deal with student bodies in which some stu
dents are allowed by law to drink and some aren't.
. . . And the ABC and school officials would
have to police a far more immature group con
sisting of 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds.
