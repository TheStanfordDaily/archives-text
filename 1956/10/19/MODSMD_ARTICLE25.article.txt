MARKING ON THE CURVE...
AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
Twonkey Crimscott was a professor. Clioate Sigafoos
was a sophomore. Twonkey Crimscott was keen, cold,
brilliant. Choate Sigafoos was loose, vague, adenoidal.
Twonkey Crimscott believed in diligence, discipline, and
marking on the curve. Choate Sigafoos believed in elves,
Jayne Mansfield, and thirteen hours sleep each night.
Yet there came a time when Twonkey Crimscott —
mentor, sage, and savant —was thoroughly out-thought,
out-foxed, out-maneuvered, out-ployed, and out-witted
by Choate Sigafoos, sophomore.
It happened one day when Choate was at the library
studying for one of Mr. Crimscott's exams in sociology.
Mr. Crimscott's exams were murder— plain, flat murder.
They consisted of one hundred questions, each question
ha-ving four possible answers—A, B, C, and D. The trouble
was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so in
tricately worded, that students more clever by far than
Choate Sigafoos were often set to gibbering.
So on this day Choate sat in the library poring over
his sociology text, his tiny brow furrowed with concen
tration, while all around him sat the other members of
the sociology class, every one studying like crazy. "What
a waste!" he thought. "All this youth, this verve, this
bounce, chained to musty books in a musty library! We
should be out singing and dancing and smooching and
cutting didoes on the greensward!"
Then, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit
Choate. "Listen!" he shouted to his classmates. "Tomor
row when we take the exam, let's all — every one of us —
check Choice 'A' on every question— every one of them."
"Huh?" said his classmates.
"Mr. Crimscott marks on the curve. If we all check
the same answers, then we all get the same score, and
everybody in the class gets a 'C'."
"Hmm," said his classmates.
"Let's get out of here and have a ball!" said Choate.
So they all ran out and lit Philip Morrises and had
a ball, as, indeed, you will too when you light a J'liilip
Morris, for if there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit
and gladden the heart, it is today's new Philip Morris —
firm and pure and fragrant and filled with true, natural,
golden tobacco, lip end to tip end.

W;ii sir, the next morning the whole class did what
Choate said and, an re enough, they all got "C's," and they
picked Choate up and carried him on their shoulders and
sang "For lie's a Jolly Good Fellow" and plied him with
sweetmeats and Philip Morris and girls and put on
buttons which said "1 DOTE ON CHOATE."
But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next
time shrewd old Mr. Crimscott gave them a test, he gave
them only one question- to wit: write a .'50,000 word
essay on "Crime Does Not Pay."
"Von and your ideas," they said to Choate and tore
oil' his epaulets and broke his sword and drummed him
out of the school. Today, a broken man, he earns a meager
living as a camshaft in Toledo.

picked Choate up and carried him on their shoulders and

sweetmeats and Philip Morris and girls and put on
buttons which said "1 DOTE ON CHOATE."
But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next

them only one question- to wit: write a .'50,000 word

MARKING ON THE CURVE...
AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
Twonkey Crimscott was a professor. Clioate Sigafoos
was a sophomore. Twonkey Crimscott was keen, cold,
brilliant. Choate Sigafoos was loose, vague, adenoidal.
Twonkey Crimscott believed in diligence, discipline, and
marking on the curve. Choate Sigafoos believed in elves,
Jayne Mansfield, and thirteen hours sleep each night.
Yet there came a time when Twonkey Crimscott —
mentor, sage, and savant —was thoroughly out-thought,
out-foxed, out-maneuvered, out-ployed, and out-witted
by Choate Sigafoos, sophomore.
It happened one day when Choate was at the library
studying for one of Mr. Crimscott's exams in sociology.
Mr. Crimscott's exams were murder— plain, flat murder.
They consisted of one hundred questions, each question
ha-ving four possible answers—A, B, C, and D. The trouble
was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so in
tricately worded, that students more clever by far than
Choate Sigafoos were often set to gibbering.
So on this day Choate sat in the library poring over
his sociology text, his tiny brow furrowed with concen
tration, while all around him sat the other members of
the sociology class, every one studying like crazy. "What
a waste!" he thought. "All this youth, this verve, this
bounce, chained to musty books in a musty library! We
should be out singing and dancing and smooching and
cutting didoes on the greensward!"
Then, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit
Choate. "Listen!" he shouted to his classmates. "Tomor
row when we take the exam, let's all — every one of us —
check Choice 'A' on every question— every one of them."
"Huh?" said his classmates.
"Mr. Crimscott marks on the curve. If we all check
the same answers, then we all get the same score, and
everybody in the class gets a 'C'."
"Hmm," said his classmates.
"Let's get out of here and have a ball!" said Choate.
So they all ran out and lit Philip Morrises and had
a ball, as, indeed, you will too when you light a J'liilip
Morris, for if there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit
and gladden the heart, it is today's new Philip Morris —
firm and pure and fragrant and filled with true, natural,
golden tobacco, lip end to tip end.

W;ii sir, the next morning the whole class did what
Choate said and, an re enough, they all got "C's," and they
picked Choate up and carried him on their shoulders and
sang "For lie's a Jolly Good Fellow" and plied him with
sweetmeats and Philip Morris and girls and put on
buttons which said "1 DOTE ON CHOATE."
But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next
