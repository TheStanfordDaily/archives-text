# Controversial Prop. 4 Analyzed
## 
### Dave Scott Associate Editor 
On Nov. 6 California voters will
have before them on the ballot
an amendment to the Stale Con
stitution which is probably the
least understood of any on record,
but also has had more money
spent on it th;m any other.
This amendment is Proposi
tion 4.

This proposition, supposedly de
signed to eliminate waste in the
pumping and production of oil in
the state, provides for unit opera
tion of big oil pool areas.
The problem arises from uneco
nomical, wasteful methods now
used in bringing oil out of the
ground. At present, if there are a
large number of companies own
ing portions of land above a large
oil pool, each one may drill as
many wells as he wishes.
The usual practice has been for
companies to drill wells as close
to their property boundaries as
they can in order to tap the oil
lying under their competitors'
wells. It is legal for those who
get the oil to keep it, not those

who have actual possession of the
land under which the oil lies.
This practice, known as "the
rule of capture," not only means
unethical competition; more im
portant, it means a waste of oil
deposits.
One of the most important aids
in getting oil out of the ground is
the deposit of natural gas lying
abpve the oil deposit. The gas
exerts pressure, pushing the oil
up through the wells. Without
sufficient gas pressure, drilling
must cease or a process known
as recycling must be used.
A great many wells drilled into
a given oil deposit will penetrate
the gas deposit in so many places
that the needed gas pressure is
soon all let out. Under this situa
tion only about 30 per cent of the
total oil deposit can ever be
brought out of the ground.
The ideal arrangement, so far
as getting the most out of the
ground, would be to drill few big
wells and to practice the recycling
process. This recycling is done
either by taking the escaped gas
and pumping it back above the oil
or by pumping water into the bot
tom of the oil deposit to push it
up, or by doing a combination of
these two. This recycling is what
Proposition 4, under the unit sys
tem, is supposed to do.
75 Per Cent
If passed, the proposition vyould
work something like this: If 75
per cent of the acreage owners
agree to the unit plan, then a
three-member, governor-appointed
Gas and Oil Commission moves in.
The commission would appoint
state geologists to figure the
amount of oil deposit lying direct
ly under each company's land.
Then a few large wells would be
drilled, regardless of whose land
they lay on.
All companies would contribute
to the cost of the drilling and
toward any necessary recycling
in order to get the most out of the
land. After the oil is sold, profits
would be split among companies
in proportion to the amount of oil
geologists estimated was under
their land. Under this system as
much as 60 to 70 per cent of the
oil can be obtained.
Slow System
A principal objection to the sys
tem is that it is slower than the
present system, and with the
Suez situation as it is, we need oil
now. Proponents of the measure
counter that the unit system will
definitely mean more oil in the
long run.
This in turn leads to another
argument advanced by both sides.
Opponents charge that oil prices
will rise appreciably, because the
production slow-down will mean
increase in imports of more ex
pensive Arabian oil. If the Suez

crisis gets worse, our increased
dependence upon the Arabian oil
is going to put the companies in
a bad hole.
Proponents reply that only 10
per cent of our oil comes from
Arabia and that the unit system
makes no great difference. In 10
years, they say, we will have to
use 20 per cent more Arabian oil
under either system.
Opponents argue that this rep
resents another area where the
government is unrightfully mov
ing in. Further they argue this
was a matter for the State Legis
lature to take up and not an in
itiative measure. The state's tak
ing over holds it amenable to cor
ruption, with the big oil compa
nies in a position to bribe state
geologists.
The proposed system would
have a tendency to squeeze out
small companies. The policy of
less oil in the short run, but more
oil in the long run, could force
many small companies to go
broke, while benefiting the large
companies. With an increased
monopoly situation, oil prices
would go up.
The system is not compulsory.
The major companies hold more
than 75 per cent of acreage in
only 45 out of the 180 most im
portant fields in California. In
dependents hold that position in
67 fields. In the other 68, neither
major nor independent compa
nies hold that much acreage. So
in most instances the small com
panies won't get the system
forced upon them unless they
want it.
Pat Brown
State Attorney General Pat
Brown is opposed to the measure
on the grounds that it is weak,
and the Legislature could do a
much better job of setting up the
unit plan and a commission to
carry it out.
It is true the measure is vague,
the first few years of its admin
istration would be rough and por
tions of it could be thrown out in
the courts. On the other hand, its
passage would not bring the price
of gasoline to 50 cents a gallon as
small company opponents are
now advertising.
It is recognized that some con
servation measure is needed. Cal
ifornia's present oil system is
confused and highly wasteful. All
other states have some sort of
sane regulation. Most conserva
tion engineers have estimated
that a satisfactory unit system
will double our present known
oil reservesâ€”an increase of four
billion barrels of oil.
It is up to the voters of Cali
fornia to decide whether Proposi
tion 4 is the answer to the prob
lem.
