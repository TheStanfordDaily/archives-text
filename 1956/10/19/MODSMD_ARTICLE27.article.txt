# George Lincoln asks:
## What do metallurgists do in a chemical company? Charlie Smith answers: 
### 
CHARLES I. SMITH, JR., received his B.S. Ch.R.
from V.P.I, in 15)4.'}, served in the Navy as an
engineer officer, and joined Du Font's Engineer
ing I )epartment in 1946. Since then, he has ad
vanced steadily through a number of interesting
assignments at various Du Pont plants. He was
recently promoted to manager of the Technical
Section of Du Pont's Pigments Department.

They have an almost endless variety of interesting
problems to face, George. As a student of metallurgy,
you know that about two-thirds of all known chemical
elements are metals. Many of them are revealing valu
able new applications, when highly purified on a com
mercial scale. Du Pont is greatly interested in several
metallic and semi-metallic elements.
My own experience at Du Pont ranges from work
on titanium pigments, to metallic titanium production,
and to the ultra-pure silicon used in transistors. You
can appreciate some of our metallurgical problems when
I point out that impurities in transistor silicon have to
be below one part in 100 million. That's equivalent to
one pound of impurities distributed through a train of
ore cars twenty miles long!
Some of our metallurgists carry out fundamental
research on new metals, and, in the development stage,
they frequently operate pilot plants for producing them.
Other metallurgists study problems relating to engi
neering materials used in construction, carry out re
search on intergranular corrosion, or investigate fatigue
relationships encountered in dynamic, high-pressure
operations.
You'll find many challenging opportunities in every
phase*of metallurgy at Du Pont., George.

GEORGE M. LINCOLN, JR., expects to receive his B.S. in met
allurgical engineering from Lehigh University in 1957. George was
vice president of his junior class, is active in sports, and a partici
pant. in many other campus activities. He's starting his employ
ment investigations early, for he feels that the selection of an
employer is one of the most important decisions in a man's career.
CHARLES I. SMITH, JR., received his B.S. Ch.R.
from V.P.I, in 15)4.'}, served in the Navy as an
engineer officer, and joined Du Font's Engineer
ing I )epartment in 1946. Since then, he has ad
vanced steadily through a number of interesting
assignments at various Du Pont plants. He was
recently promoted to manager of the Technical
Section of Du Pont's Pigments Department.

They have an almost endless variety of interesting
problems to face, George. As a student of metallurgy,
you know that about two-thirds of all known chemical
elements are metals. Many of them are revealing valu
able new applications, when highly purified on a com
mercial scale. Du Pont is greatly interested in several
metallic and semi-metallic elements.
My own experience at Du Pont ranges from work
on titanium pigments, to metallic titanium production,
and to the ultra-pure silicon used in transistors. You
can appreciate some of our metallurgical problems when
I point out that impurities in transistor silicon have to
be below one part in 100 million. That's equivalent to
one pound of impurities distributed through a train of
ore cars twenty miles long!
Some of our metallurgists carry out fundamental
research on new metals, and, in the development stage,
they frequently operate pilot plants for producing them.
Other metallurgists study problems relating to engi
neering materials used in construction, carry out re
search on intergranular corrosion, or investigate fatigue
relationships encountered in dynamic, high-pressure
operations.
You'll find many challenging opportunities in every
phase*of metallurgy at Du Pont., George.
