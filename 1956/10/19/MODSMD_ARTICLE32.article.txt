# Brodie To Face Stubborn Oregon Pass Defense
## Ducks to Match Speed Against Card Air Game Brodie Leads Country in Pass Offense; Casanova's Team Stingy in Pass Defense 
### Bob Payne 
Which will triumph, the nation's No. 1 passer or the Pacific Coast's
No. 1 pass defense? That question should be settled tomorrow when
John Brodie and the other Stanford Indians meet the Oregon Ducks
at Eugene.
Once again Oregon has put together a tough pass defense. In four

games the Webfools have allowed
only 53.3 yards per game-through
the air. Oregon, however, has yet
to meet a passer the likes of* Mr.
Brodie.
The Card ace has amassed 734
yards and seven touchdowns with
his aerials, leading the land in
both departments. In addition,
Brodie tops the nation in total
offense with 7-18 yards.
Cards Slab* Same Lineup
Coach Chuck Taylor expects to
field the same lineup which start
ed against San Jose State in to
morrow's clash. The Cards (so
far) have gone through a full
week without injuries, setting
some sort of a record. Slated to
miss tomorrow's game is the
same quartet which sat out the
SJS tilt: ends Gary Van Galder
and Joel Freis, center Bob Long
and tackle Steve Docter.
Starting halfback Gordy Young
missed part of this week's prac
tices with an infected tonsil, but
looking impressive in his spot
were Hawaiian halfbacks A 1 Har
rington and Al Napoleon and San
Lorenzo's Jeri McMillin. Young
enjoyed one of his best games
last week against the Spartans
and currently heads the Indian
rushers with 184 yards in 40 tries.
Wingback Paul Camera moved
into the PCC pass-receiving lead
after making eight catches last
week. Camera has snagged 18 for
248 yards and one touchdown.
Van Galder, fullback Lou Valli
and Carl Isaacs all have caught
nine passes, with Isaacs scoring
four touchdowns on receptions.
The Indian line should have its
hands full tomorrow containing
the fleet Oregon ground attack.
Set to go in the forward wall are
Isaacs and Ben Robinson at ends,
Paul Wiggin and Troy Barbee at
tackles, Noel Robinson and Donn
Carswell at guards and Roch Con
klin at center. Wiggin and Robin
son have continued to stand out
defensively up front.
Pass Defense Tested
Oregon will get the first real"
test of its pass defense in tomor
row's game. Airtight secondaries
have been a byword with Len
Casanova - coached teams at Eu
gene. In his first year as head
mentor, 1951, an unheralded fresh
man quarterback named George
Shaw intercepted 13 passes to set
an NCAA record which still
stands. This same Shaw has since
gone on to All America fame and
is now the star signal-caller of
the pro Baltimore Colts. Last year
another great pass-defender, Dick
James, was graduated.
But their "tradition" still lin
gers. The Webfoot secondary has
held opposing throwers down to
an anemic .365 completion per
centage. Left halfback Jack

Brown tops the PCC in intercep
tions with two.
Ducks Have Fleet Backs
The Ducks hope to unveil their
powerful running attack after two
weeks of- fumbilitis. The Web
toots boast such star ball-carriers
as Jack Morris and Jim Shanley,
plus Brown and a wealth of good
reserve material.
Casanova has indicated that the
Ducks may pass more than usual
this week. Second-string quarter
back Jack Crabtree ahead of
s t a rt e r Tom Crabtree in the
throwing department and may see
much action tomorrow.
The light but mobile Duck line
is paced by Captain Phil McHugh
at end and guards Reanous Coch
rane, Spike HilLstrom and Jack
Pocock. Only Oregonian expected
to miss tomorrow's game is prom
ising sophomore end Ron Stover,
out with a broken hand.
This marks the 25th meeting
between Stanford and Oregon.
The Indians have won 18 times,
Oregon 5 and there was 1 tie. Last
year Stanford triumphed, 44-7,
putting the only mar on a great
late-season surge by the Ducks.
Oregon's last win in the series
was in 1952. a 21-20 victory.
Teams Hold 2-2 Records
Both teams come into the game
with 2-2 records. Oregon has beat
en Colorado, 35-0, and Idaho, 21-14,
while v losing to UCLA, 6-0, and
Washington, 20-7. 'Stanford has
recorded its victories over Wash
ington State, 40-26, and San Jose
State, 40-20. The Cards were
dumped on successive Saturdays
by two mighty Big Ten powers,
Michigan State and Ohio State.
Next week it's Southern Cali
fornia. But the Tribe can't afford
to be looking ahead.
Nashua Retires
LEXINGTON, Ky„ Oct. 18
(UP)—Nashua took a farewell
gallop today over the racing turf
on which he won more than a
million dollars in three brilliant
racing seasons, then rode off to
retirement on a rolling Blue
Grass farm.


SHANLEY RAMBLES —Oregon's speedy halfback Jim Shanley is

game.
