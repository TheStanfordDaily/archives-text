# Braves Face SJS; Seek Second Win
## 
### 
In quest of their second victory
of the season, Coach Mai El
ward's Stanford Braves journey
to San Jose tomorrow afternoon
to do battle with the San Jose
State jayvee footballers.
Beginning at 2 p.m. in Spartan
Stadium, the Braves will be striv
ing to continue the work begun
by their big brothers last Satur
day on the Stanford grounds.
San Jose, loser to Treasure Is
land last week. 31-6, must be ac
corded the underdog's role.
Only two points separate El
ward's charges from their pres
ent 1-1-1 record and an undefeat
ed-untied season.
Following their impressive 43-6
opening victory against Moffett
Field, they fell before Hamilton
Field's aerial onslaught, 34 - 33,
and then held the' favored Cal
Ramblers to a 13-13 tie last week
end.
Sophomore quarterback Bob
Nicolet will again lead the Stan
ford jayvee attack. His pass com
pletions have been well over the
50 per cent mark in each of the
Braves' three games.
Walley Honneywell, mainstay
of the running backs, may miss
the game with a bad ankle.
Starting for the Braves will be:
Les Hopkins, LE; Dave Bramble,
LT; Don Dawson. LG; Pete Swan
son, C; Glenn Hayden, RG; Gary
Allen, RT; Dave Baldwin, RE;
Bob Nicolet, Q; Jim Sinnerud,
LI IB; Dick Mires, RHB; John
Cole, FB.
