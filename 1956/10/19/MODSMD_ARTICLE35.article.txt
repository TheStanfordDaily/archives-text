# Rain Dampens Duck Workout
## 
### 
EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 18 (UP) â€”
Coach Len Casanova sent his
University of Oregon football
team through a 45-minute dum
my drill today on a wet Hayward
field.
Major emphasis in the Webfoot
camp was on backfield work,
with concentration on timing and
ball handling. Heavy showers
peppered the workouts and the
weather forecast indicated that
the Ducks and Stanford may get
a wet field for their Saturday
game.
