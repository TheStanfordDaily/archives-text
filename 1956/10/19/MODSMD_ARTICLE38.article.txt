Finding new oil is vital. By 1965 America's
needs will rise 20%. To locate additional
oil deposits, Standard geologists explored
33 states and 40 countries last year on foot,
in planes and even in specially designed
"swamp buggies" (above). As a result, we
found substantial new reserves for your
future use ... this is Oil Progress.


Standard puts oil to work for better living
in hundreds of products . . . asphalt roads
for safe, comfortable driving; gasolines, oils
and tires; wrinkle-resistant fabrics;stronger
plastics; detergents to make housework
easier; wax for candles and food cartons;
plant foods; even cosmetics, salves and
ointments . . . this is Oil Progress.


Producing oil for more and more uses led
us to far places . . . even to man-made
"islands." Last year, in the Western Hemi
sphere alone, Standard drilled 107 test wells
—many in remote spots. But even with
new sources harder to find we added nearly
three times as much oil fo reserves as we
took from the ground... this is Oil Progress.


Research in oil promises new products...
plastics strong as steel; new synthetic fibres;
be( ter insect icides. Even commercial atomic
power is closer with new Standard-devel
oped oils. In atomic machinery they last
two to three times longer under radiation
that makes some petroleum oils hard enough
to drive nails ... this is Oil Progress.
