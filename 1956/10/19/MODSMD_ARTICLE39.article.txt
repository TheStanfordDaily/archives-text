WITII ONE WEEK to go be
fore the USC battle royale in
Stanford Stadium, the pressure is
beginning to build up to the ex
plosive climax which will come
soon after tin* flip of the coin on
Oct. 27.
The tension will be evident on
the practice fields of both schools
next week. For USC it will be the
big game (j! the year a game for
"revenge." That's why 80,000 fans
will flock here to watch two
teams play football.
It will be a peculiar kind of
football, for on each play will
ride not just the spirit of colle
giate competition, but also the
more fierce emotions of vindic
tive partisans who make the trip
north to root with vengeance.
This is the kind of game that
Chuck Taylor must prepare for.
But he probably isn't giving it a
thought at the present moment,
because lie "takes one game at a
time."
Iluvvuiiuns iVlay Spring Loose
In some Eugene, Oregon, hotel
room he is having breakfast and
thinking about the immediate
problem at hand . . . beating the
Webfoots. During practice this
week, Chuck has given indication
that Stanford may blossom out
with running attack against the
Oregon squad tomorrow.
Don't be surprised if those Ha
waiian speedsters A 1 Napoleon
and A 1 Harrington, start burning
up some yardage along with
Gonly Young. Not for a minute
does Taylor think the passing at
tack with which Field General
Brodie has engineered will be suf
ficient to overcome the Trojans,
or any other team of SC's caliber.
This is the week to watch the
S t a li 112 or d offense closely, for
there may be a change of strat
egy which will foreshadow a, few
surprises for the Trojans next
week. This is for sure — there
will be new plays sprung against
Oregon tomorrow, plays which
have been carefully rehearsed at
practice session this week. And
there may be a new star or two
in the making on the Eugene grid
Defense Must Be Sharpened
In four games, the.Stanford of
fense has scored 107 points—an
average of 2G.75 points a game.
In the same four games, the op
position has tallied 95) points—an
average of 2<l.7f>.
This would indicate a need to
sharpen the defense. Observers
agreed that in the San Jose State
game, defensive performance was
sloppy and erratic. It was this
kind of playing that made Taylor
send the team through its first
hard-hitting scrimmage session in
three weeks on Tuesday.
You can be sure there will be
more of that kind of practicing
starting ori Monday . If you've
never seen a Stanford football
workout on the practice field,
there would be no better time to
Watch one than next week.
Taylor runs his practices on a
definite timetable, beginning af
ter 1 p.m. and lasting as late as
i>:ir>. They will run late next
week, under lights.

POSTSCRIPT: Some people
like practice sessions as much as
they like the game itself. On a
given day the small bleacher on
the sidelines of tin 1 well-beaten
turf will be filled with various
old alums, football figures of the
past and sportswriters of stature.
While Coach Taylor called out di
rections to the players last week

on his electronic megaphone from
atop his portable reviewing stand,
you could have watched a passing
exhibition on the sidelines be
tween Palo Alto Times Sports Ed
itor Walt Gamage and Stanford
cage coach Howie Dallmar.
Of you might have caught
snatches of a conversation by the
eminent sportsmaster Dink Tern
pleton. Meantime John Brodie
would be executing a pass play
on the field as beautiful as any
one you'll see on Saturday after
noons. It's all there on the prac
tice field during weekday after
noons.
