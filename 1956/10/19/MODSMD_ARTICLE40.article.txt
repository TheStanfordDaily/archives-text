# Distance Men Face San Jose
## 
### 
Payton Jordan's cross - country j
forces knock the lid off the liar-i
rier season tomorrow at 10 a.m.
when they host San Jose State in
a dual meet.
The four - mile race will be |
staged on the Stanford Golf j
Course. It will begin at the sec-!
ond tee and will also finish at that I
point.
Maury Graves and Ralph Love j
are expected to pace the Stanford
team. Love has looked excellent j
in practice sessions thus far, while
Graves, only a junior, was one of
the nation's best collegiate (lis- 1
tance runners last spring.
Doug Martin, Don Richardson, |
A 1 Salcedo, Warren Wood and .
freshman Bob Monzingo were the
others nominated by Jordan to
officially oppose the Spartans.
Fifteen other Indians will also
be in the race, but will not count
in the scoring. Jordan emphasized
that if any in this group break
into the top seven, they will be on
the team that runs against South
ern California next week end.
Stanford cross-country hopes
are at their highest levels since
the Indians took up the sport in
1952. With a good group of new
comers added to the host of re
turning veterans from last year,
the Tribe will have plenty of
depth.
San Jose will provide the In
dians with a rugged opening test.
They have lost to Stanford only
once in five meets, although all
of the encounters have been close.
