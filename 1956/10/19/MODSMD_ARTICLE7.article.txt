# Adlai Explains Incentive Plan To Cut Draft
## Advocates Offering Adocates Scholarships To Attract Personnel 
### 
YOUNCtSTOWN, Ohio, Oct. 18
(UP) Adlai Stevenson said today
the need for the draft could be
reduced materially through a
broad incentive system to encour
age career military service by "ex
perienced and professional per
sonnel."
His suggested incentives include
special bonuses for longer service
and university scholarships for
qualified young men who agree
to spend a specific period in the
a f:r.ed forces.
Stevenson's discussion of the
draft and his proposal to stop
testing H-bombs climaxed a day
of campaigning for Ohio's 32 elec
toral votes in four speeches.
"Republican Complacency"
Earlier in the day, at Akron,
the Democratic presidential can
didate diagnosed the Eisenhower
Administration as suffering from
"creeping complacency" which
has permitted big corporations to
prosper while the fortunes of the
farmer and the consumer deterio
rated. He said:
". . . Another thing I've been
saying lately that seems to annoy
Mr. Eisenhower is that his Admin
istration suffers from creeping
complacency. Mr. Eisenhower
says he does not know what those
words mean. Let me explain.
Tight Money Policy
"Many farmers, small business
men and ordinary citizens are suf
fering from the drying up of
credit and from the high interest
rates. But Secretary of the Treas
ury Humphrey thinks that the
tight money policy is a good way
to deal with 'the difficulties' of
these times. That's what I mean
by Republican complacency."
Here in heavily Democratic
Youngstown tonight Stevenson
denied flatly that he had ever
proposed an abrupt cessation pf
the draft or suggested any plan
that would weaken the armed
forces.
Misconstrued
Ho said his draft suggestion
was "deliberately misconstrued by
the Republicans." He said his
basic plan would result in a
stronger military force.
"The point is simply that we
need more and more today a type
of military personnel—experienc
ed and professional—which the
present draft system does not
give us," the Democratic candi
date said.
"The draft means a tremendous
turnover in our military person
nel and a resultant high propor
tion of inexperienced personnel,
and there is ample evidence that
this inexperienced personnel is
not meeting today's needs."
Stevenson said the increasingly
urgent need for top-flight person
nel was brought on by the devel
opment of complex new weapons
and military techniques.
He cited statements by Gen.
Nathan F, Twining, Air Force
chief of staff; Maj. Gen. Donald
P. Booth, assistant deputy chief
of staff, personnel, of the Army,
and Sen. Mike Mansfield (D*
Mont, i all to the effect that heavy
turnover in personnel in the'arm
ed services was detrimental to ef
ficiency, economy and morale.
