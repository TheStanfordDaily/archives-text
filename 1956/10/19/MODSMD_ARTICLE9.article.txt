# Liquor Association Enters Fight to Lower California Legal Drinking Age to 18
## Campus Stir Causes Group To Push Fight Association Lobbyist Says Illegal Drinking Harassing to Dealers 
### 
The Liquor Store and Taverns
Association announced yesterday
that it will join in the fight to
lower California's age limit for
drinking beer and light wines to
18.
According to Charles C. Quit
man, attorney and lobbyist for
the association, this move hod
been contemplated before. But,
because of the recent movement
originating on the Stanford cam
pus and spreading to other Cali
fornia campuses, it was decided
to push the fight at the present
time.
Quitman maintains that "viola
tions are very harassing to deal
ers. If a person 18 to 21 really
| wants a drink, he's going to get
it. And he does get itâ€”but in an
illegal fashion."
By letting this age group pur
chase beer and light wines legal
ly, he said, it would eliminate the
feeling among these people that
they were "getting away with
something."
Promotes Disrespect.
" The present law actually pro
motes a feeling of disrespect for
laws in general," he said. Thus,
an unhealthy attitude toward
California laws is allowed to con
tinue. ,
Quitman cited other reasons
which he believed support his
contention. Most young men and
i women, he said, begin their court
ing before reaching the age of 21.
The present law confines their
courting to ice cream parlors,
movie theaters and similar
places.
They are prevented from
courting in an adult manner. Yet,
should they marry, they are ex
pected to raise their families in
an adult manner and to manage
their homes as adults. In other
words, except for the privileges
of voting and purchasing or pos
sessing liquor, they are adults."
Extra Support
When questioned about the
new development, petition circu
lator Lloyd Downton's campaign
manager Fene Cardeans of San
Francisco State College said. "It's
certainly wonderful to have some
extra support. We need all the
help and support we can get."
Downton himself said that the
petitions were still circulating
and that he has not had a chance
to tabulate the present number
of signatures.
Quitman said that at the pres
ent time his group intends to
gather information on the subject
of 18- to 21-year-olds' drinking
from states that permit them to
drink. He said the Association in
tends to use this information in
an educational campaign.
The most effective way for stu
dents to help get the present age
limit lowered, Quitman said, is to
write letters to their representa
tives in the State Legislature, giv
ing their viewpoints on the sub
ject.
Individual letters, he said, add
more prestige and usually receive
more attention than petitions,
1 hough these are also effective.
