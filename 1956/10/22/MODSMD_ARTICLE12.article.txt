# EXISTENTIAL PROBLEMS
## Human Existence Is Theme Of Herberg Lectures Here 
### 
Human existence will be theologian Will Herberg's topic during
a week of lectures and seminars here.
He plans to try to clarify the existential situation and the Bibli
cal answer.
The central theme of his lectures will be "What does it mean to

be a human being?" A recent
survey found tremendous interest
in this subject among college stu
dents, Herberg said. There are
stirrings of interest in religion on
most campuses, he said.
Two religious revivals are un
der way, he said. First is a so
ciological, superficial "religious
ness," where peo p 1 e consider
themselves only as belonging to
a certain religious group.
There are also existential prob
lems, Herberg said. On campuses
there is a great surge of exis
tential ferment. The question that
arises is, "Will the student keep
this religion of existence that was
fostered in college after he leaves
the campus?"
Religious Ferment
Although there is a religious
ferment on U.S. college campuses,
the churches of America are fail
ing its youth, Herberg said. They
are generally of the older-genera
tion philosophy which does not be
lieve young people are religious.
When youth confronts its elders
with this high religious feeling, it
is frustrated by their attitude and
can either openly rebel or keep
silent.
The majority keep silent. Her
berg said. Often their zeal is sup
pressed and they become cynical.
What will happen, most likely, is
that the young ministers closer to
this movement will eventually do
something about it, he said
Moral Conduct
On the question of whether tin .
religious interest affected the
moral conduct of the students,
Herberg had this to say: The low
est and most common form of
morality is the ethic of conven
tional conformity: some people go
tf) church because "everyone else"
goes to church.
Lot the college student ask him
self, "Why am I here, and why do
I go to church?" and he will ques
tion this conventional conformity,
Herberg said.
This questioning may upset the
first moral system and take the
student to the second step of mo
rality, the ethic of moral responsi
bility.
Herberg wants young people to
be themselves. If they want to
rebel, let them; if they want to
keep silent on a subject, let them
do that also, he said.
Lukewarm
"Because you were neither hot
nor cold, but lukewarm, I spew
you forth," he quitted from Reve
lation 3:lfi. The adults want to be
lukewarm, he says, but the college
people do not.
Herberg's next public appear
ance on campus will be at his sem
inar on the philosophy of Martin
Buber, "Real Life Is Meeting: Bu
ber's Philosophy of Existence." to
morrow at I p.m. in the Women's
Clubhouse.
