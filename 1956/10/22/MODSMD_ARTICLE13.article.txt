# Ike Offended By Bulganin' H-Bomb
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 21 (UP)
President Eisenhower bluntly
told Soviet Premier Nikolai A.
Bulganin today that his newest
letter proposing an H-bomb ban
"is personally offensive to me"
and "constitutes an interference"
in U.S. domestic affairs.
The President issued a sharply
worded reply to Bulganin's letter
last Friday which in effect en
dorsed Adlai E. Stevenson's pro
posal for an international agree
ment to control hydrogen weap
ons tests.
The President noted that Bul
ganin's letter was released by
Moscow without previous notifi
cation to the United States. This,
he asserted, "departs from ac
cepted international practice in a
number of respects."
Interference
"First, the sending of your note
in the midst of a national election
campaign . . .â€¢ expressing your
support of Hie opinions of 'cer
tain prominent public figures in
the United States' constitutes an
interference by a foreign nation
in our internal affairs . . . ," the
President said.
He said that if a foreign am
bassador had been guilty of such
"interference," he would be de
clared "persona non grata (not
acceptable) in accordance with
long-established custom."
Ittiint language
He told Bulganin in language
which was unusually blunt for
two heads of state that the Soviet
premier had seemed to "impugn
my own sincerity."
Eisenhower's letter was made
public by White House Press Sec
rotary James C. Hagerty at an
unusual Sunday afternoon news
conference.
Hagerty said ihe President's
letter was sr>nt to Moscow for de
livery to Bulganin following a
two-hour meeting between Eisen
hower and Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles.
In Russian
In his letter to Bulganin, the
President said that "having deliv
ered a lengthy communication in
the Russian language, you have
published it before it could be
carefully translated and delivered
to me."
"Because of this," he said, "and
of the necessity of placing the
facts accurately before the pub
lie, I am compelled to release this
reply immediately."
