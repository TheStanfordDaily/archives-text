WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today he does not
think the United States would
send armed forces into Poland if
Russia sought to suppress the
Polish unrest: by force. •
He predicted, however,' that
Russia will not attempt "mass
military measures" to put do\vn
the Polish move toward greater
independence from Moscow. He
said that even if Russia resorts
to force "I don't think it would
succeed."
Dulles declined to blueprint
this country's moves in the Polish
crisis except to say the United
States "has been doing the only
thing it can—to keep alive the
idea of freedom and constantly
see it is brought to the attention
of the Polish people."
No U.S. Intervention
But he seemed to rule out U.S.
military intervention no matter
what Russia does.
"I do not think we would send
our own armed forces," he said
solemnly. "I doubt if would be
profitable and it would be the
last thing in the world they (the
Poles) would want."
Any such intervention, he said,
would "precipitate a world war
and as a result fiiey (the Poles)
would be wiped out."
Not Overnight
Dulles said he does not think
Poland will achieve its liberation
"overnight." He said the current
situation is "yeast working" and
is "not as spectacular as some
newspaper reports seem to sug
gest."
Presidential Press Secretary
Jaines C. Hagerty said the Presi
dent will continue to stay "in
very close touch" with the Polish
situation.
