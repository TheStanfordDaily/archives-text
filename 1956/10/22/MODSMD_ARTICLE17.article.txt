# Reasons for a Change
## 
### 
Realizing it is not difficult to run a worth
while issue into tlie ground, we feel it necessary
to explain again our reasons for urging a change
in the present state liquor law.
We feel it necessary to do so because of the
many letters we have received crying out for
better reasons for altering the law; we feel
compelled to state our reasons again, for we
feel that Stanford, through its student legisla
ture, should take cognizance of the problem
and state its position unequivocally to the state
legislature. We firmly believe this to be within
the prerogative and responsibility of conscious
student government.
We urge students to consider the issue seri
ously and to contact their Legislature repre
sentatives so that action on this matter will not
reflect snap judgment and lack of thought.
Our stand on this matter has been decided
with the realization that there are many 18-
year-olds who do not have the mental or physi
cal maturity to handle liquor. For this reason
we think the legal age should he established
at 10 lo exclude most high school students, with
whom serious juvenile delinquency problems
might arise.
Sotting an arbitrary age limit is difficult in
any case, hut should the age he set at 19 rather
than 21, the law would reflect reality rather
than hypocrisy; it would legalize the inevitable
lather than shutting its eyes to it. At present
the law is something to be scorned, laughed at
and totally ignored—until the danger arises
that the violator might he caught. The state,
the University, parents and Students all realize
that the law is aimed at persons confirmed in
their unwillingness to obey the law and totally
unashamed about their attitude.

As wo have said before, a law that is will
fully disobeyed is detrimental to the spirit of
obedience to the law, this factor being espe
cially important among young people.
If a piece of legislation could- deter young
people from seeking amusement via liquor, the
issue would be entirely different, but legisla
tion, however strictly enforced, cannot alter
the social fabric of a people.
From another point of view, individuals leav
ing high school and entering college or a job
are, for all practical purposes, adults in the
sense that they are responsible for their own
actions. Because of other responsibilities of
adulthood, they expect to judge for themselves
whether and what they should drink.
Relative ages of maturity among young peo
ple differ; many cannot handle liquor at 19,
but neither can many at 21 or 51. For little
logical reason, the age 21 has been designated
as marking the end of adolescence and the he
ginning of adulthood, hut because \ { ) usually
marks the break between high school and a job
or college, this age would seem far more real
istic and lo gical.
In many ways the situation is aggravated bv
the present age limit, for many young people
get a "charge" from defying the law. lu ihe
words of Rev. Francis A. Moore, dean of stu
dents at the University of San Francisco, "per
haps a concession of this type [lowering the
drinking age] would lessen the adolescent
abuses that frequently result from youth as
serting itself against restrictions it considers
unreasonable."
The issue is not one of wishful thinking; it's
one of recognizing the inevitable and adapting
law to the facts.

drinking age] would lessen the adolescent
abuses that frequently result from youth as
serting itself against restrictions it considers
unreasonable."
The issue is not one of wishful thinking; it's
one of recognizing the inevitable and adapting
law to the facts.
Realizing it is not difficult to run a worth
while issue into tlie ground, we feel it necessary
to explain again our reasons for urging a change
in the present state liquor law.
We feel it necessary to do so because of the
many letters we have received crying out for
better reasons for altering the law; we feel
compelled to state our reasons again, for we
feel that Stanford, through its student legisla
ture, should take cognizance of the problem
and state its position unequivocally to the state
legislature. We firmly believe this to be within
the prerogative and responsibility of conscious
student government.
We urge students to consider the issue seri
ously and to contact their Legislature repre
sentatives so that action on this matter will not
reflect snap judgment and lack of thought.
Our stand on this matter has been decided
with the realization that there are many 18-
year-olds who do not have the mental or physi
cal maturity to handle liquor. For this reason
we think the legal age should he established
at 10 lo exclude most high school students, with
whom serious juvenile delinquency problems
might arise.
Sotting an arbitrary age limit is difficult in
any case, hut should the age he set at 19 rather
than 21, the law would reflect reality rather
than hypocrisy; it would legalize the inevitable
lather than shutting its eyes to it. At present
the law is something to be scorned, laughed at
and totally ignored—until the danger arises
that the violator might he caught. The state,
the University, parents and Students all realize
that the law is aimed at persons confirmed in
their unwillingness to obey the law and totally
unashamed about their attitude.

As wo have said before, a law that is will
fully disobeyed is detrimental to the spirit of
obedience to the law, this factor being espe
cially important among young people.
If a piece of legislation could- deter young
people from seeking amusement via liquor, the
issue would be entirely different, but legisla
tion, however strictly enforced, cannot alter
the social fabric of a people.
From another point of view, individuals leav
ing high school and entering college or a job
are, for all practical purposes, adults in the
sense that they are responsible for their own
actions. Because of other responsibilities of
adulthood, they expect to judge for themselves
whether and what they should drink.
Relative ages of maturity among young peo
ple differ; many cannot handle liquor at 19,
but neither can many at 21 or 51. For little
logical reason, the age 21 has been designated
as marking the end of adolescence and the he
ginning of adulthood, hut because \ { ) usually
marks the break between high school and a job
or college, this age would seem far more real
istic and lo gical.
In many ways the situation is aggravated bv
the present age limit, for many young people
get a "charge" from defying the law. lu ihe
words of Rev. Francis A. Moore, dean of stu
dents at the University of San Francisco, "per
haps a concession of this type [lowering the
drinking age] would lessen the adolescent
abuses that frequently result from youth as
