# A 						Spark Comes from Poland
## 
### 
With Poland's new "Declaration of Inde
pendence" from the Soviet Union, a spark may
have been set to ignite a latent feeling of revolt
throughout the whole satellite orbit.
Indications of rising nationalistic spirit have
seeped out during the past few weeks—Hun
gar} has deposed the Russophile Matyas Rakosi
and is making overtures to Yugoslavia, while
at the same time it is rumored that Soviet-
Chinese relations are strained.
As with Yugoslavia and Hungary, the recent
upheaval in Warsaw does not mean that Poland
will veer into the Western orbit, but it does
mean that the once-firm hold that Moscow had
on its satellite states is now crumbling.
\\ ladyslaw Gomulka, new first secretary of
the Polish Communist party, is a devout Com
munist but a Communist of the Tito variety,
one who will not take orders from Russia. His
is a type of "elastic Communism" that can be
modified or extended to fit the exigencies of
the country involved.

In countries such as Poland, Hungary and
Yugoslavia the international aspect of Com
munism is dimmed in the light of present needs
to develop the economic capacities of each
country, and a break away from economic ties
with the Soviet Union turns these countries, out
of necessity, to the West and to a more liberal
influence.
The effect of these recent outbursts, as well
as the long-run effect of the recalcitrant Tito,
may force the Soviet Union in either direction
—toward a more drastically lenient policy, as
it has in the case of Tito, or toward a policy
of suppression and compulsion.
In either case, the first spark has gone off.
It will be difficult for the Soviet Union to con
tinue long its complete domination over non-
Russian peoples when it is obvious to them
that the long-run interest is not economic and
social benefit for the people, but servitude in
Moscow.
