The Slandered and the Slanderer
Editor, The Daily:
Those glancing through The Daily in the last
several days have no doubt noticed the new line
of 1he Democratic candidates.
Apparently feeling that issues alone will not
help them, Stevenson and Kefauver have con
cluded that their best chance to win the election
lies in personal attacks on Vice-President Nixon.
According to their opinion, Nixon conducts nasty,
false, evil campaigns in gutter terms, while the
Democrats pursue campaigns only in the highest,
clean-cut, heads-up manner.
Well, I'm happy to learn this. One would hardly
know which side was which without this bit of
handy information; for, in his Flint, Mich., speech
of Oct. 17, Stevenson refers to Nixon as a man
not to be trusted by the American people, a
"shifty" demagogue "whose trademark is slan
der."
Such words from Nixon on Stevenson would
have evoked cries of "Foul!" and "Gutter poli
tics!" from every Democrat in the country. But
Stevenson is an honorable man, and such words
from the mouth of an honorable man can no
longer be demagogic.
Or perhaps we might note another paragraph
of Stevenson's speech in which he also described
the Vice-President as "a man whose greatest po
litical talent is a mastery of personal innuendo,
who cries 'Treason!' and spreads fear and doubt,
a man who uses language to conceal issues rather
than explore them, a man whose trade-mark is
slander."
Slanderous words indeed, had Nixon used them,
but Stevenson conducts clean campaigns, so Ihe
words cannot be slanderous.
Thanks should be given to Stevenson for these
recent statements. They set the record straight.
Without them we all might have gone through

the campaign without knowing who was the
slanderer and who the slandered.

In Defense of the Bawlonl
Editor, The Daily:
Once more our crusading Daily has called our
attention to an alarming evil in our midst: the
academic standing of students not kept secret!
Published in the Directory!
This is clearly most harmful, for, as your edi
torial states, "the philosophy behind the Bawlout
is wrong." Why? Because "Stanford prides itself
upon being a university where a student can go
and educate and better himself personally, re
gardless of what others say or do." And the
Bawlout definitely does not exemplify this spirit,
for "it states the grades of each individual stu
dent so that he may be compared with others."
In other words, a person cannot educate and bet
ter himself personally if the quality of his work
is known to others.
The Bawlout also "represents a basic inconsist
ency in University policy," for no transcripts are
sent to other schools or employers without the
student's approval. No doubt The Daily would
have the University send these out on its own
initiative and at its own expense.
But the publication of grades is a carry over
from the benighted past when it was thought
that "students were in competition with each
other, and that printing their grades . . . would
give them . . . academic stimulus." Heavens!
In short, to put it bluntly, the only ones who
need have any complaining about publication of
grades are those who are ashamed of their work.
In which case, presumably, the solution would
be for them to work harder; not for Hie Univer
sity to conceal the fact that they have been doing
poorly.
