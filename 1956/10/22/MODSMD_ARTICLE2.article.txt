# Fraternity Gives Prefab Building New Paint Coat
## 
### 
One of the temporary buildings
behind Cubberley has a new eoat
of paint, courtesy of the Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity.
Saturday morning the whole
Phi Gamma Delia house turned
out to change Prefab B's olive
green walls patched with pink to
a new buff color. Equipment
needed for painting the building
was furnished by ihe University.
The job of painting another of
the three buildings was originally
planned as a project by Phi Phi,
an interfraternity service organi
zation.
Last spring the University pur
chased the necessary equipment
and Phi Phi brushed down the
building, according to Phi Phi
President Ken Billings. Then bad
weather and finals interfered and
the project was dropped.
Since the paint was already
mixed and would spoil if not used,
the Corporation Yard painted this
building.
Fhe three buildings, formerly
Army hospital wards, have been
in "temporary" use for 10 years.
I he building housing Ihe Western
Civilization library was painted
off-white last spring.
