# THIS WEEK ON QUADâ€”By Earl Cilley
## ...Then the Chappie Comes 
### 
Just all sorts of exciting things are happening this week, and if
you will only read on, you will become one of the few people to
know what's going on around here. Today, if you haven't already
made a circle around the date, is the first of the two days of the
ASSU primary flections. Remember, as a member of a democratic
society, it is your privilege, your right, yea and your duty to go
to the polls and vote. Yes, even in ihe ASSU primaries. Engineering
Corner, 8:30-3:30.

This afternoon the AWS is going to perform a useful act. And it
should be a good thing for poor Stanford students. They're sponsor
ing a rummage sale of stuff left in dorms last spring, at bargain
prices. A good chance to find something that will really "do some
thing" for your room. One p.m. today and through Wednesday, in
the Bull Pen at Encina.

Tonight, those busy beavers at the lIR will be at it again. In
commemoration of UN Week, the kids with the broad outlook are
sponsoring a mock session of the UN Security Council, with foreign
students representing as many of the countries as possible. They
are going to debate the Suez business at 8 in Cubberley Auditorium.
Wonder who's representing the Russians?

Tuesday marks ihe beginning of what seriously looks like Will
Herberg Week at Stanford. In an attempt to give everybody here a
chance to hear this outstanding scholar, Ihe poor guy has been given
a schedule that would kill a lesser man. Anyway, here it is: He's
i tie Tuesday Evening Series speaker this week, he's seminaring on
Martin Ruber tomorrow and Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Women's
Clubhouse, he's speaking before Ihe B'nai B'rith Wednesday and at
the Newman Club Thursday evening, and on Sunday he's giving an
other sermon at Mem Church. Good luck, Frank Buck.

Thursday evening, Ihe first Stanford Players production of the
quarter opens in Mem Aud. "Fashion," by Anna Cora Mowatt, will
play through Saturday evening, with tickets available at $1 and $1 .jio
at Mem And box office, open daily. Might be fun for a culture date.

Friday, Homecoming Weekend begins, and here's a fast rundown:
Homecoming Parade in downtown Paly Friday night at 7:30; rally
in Frost follows the parade at 9, with three-quarters of an hour of
the Stanford Band, Sigma Chi Travelers and Men's Glee Club; and
alter the rally, there's an all-campus Homecoming Dance at the
Eating Club Lounge. Saturday, there's an alumni luncheon at Bow
man; the game (with USC); open houses at Florence Moore, Wilbur
and Stern, and a dance at Stern Saturday night to wind it all up.

Thursday is a black, black day. The Chappie will be available,
for those with more money than senfee. There's a story around that
the janitors will be working overtime Wednesday, putting out waxed
paper-lined wastebaskets around Inner Quad and the Libe . . . prob
ably just a coincidence.

Sunday night at the Flicks: This week it's a film called "The
Girl in the Red Velvet Swing." Stars Ray Milland, Joan Collins, and
Farley Granger. Don't know anything about it, but it sounds pretty
esoteric. (Different, anyway.)
