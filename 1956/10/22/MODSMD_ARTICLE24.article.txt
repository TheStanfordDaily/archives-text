# Indians Primed for USC; Crush Oregon on Ground
## Break Out New Rushing Attack in 21-7 Win As Ready Grid Machine for Path to the Roses 
### 
With the season at the half
way mark the Stanford grid ma
chine is primed for the first of
five big ones that count, next Sat
urday's battle with undefeated
Southern California in the home
stadium.
There isn't a breather left on
the schedule. After the (JSC con
test the Tribe musi face UCLA,
Oregon State, Washington and
< California.
The Indians &re about as ready
as they'll ever be. They finally
found a ground attack in Satur
day's 21-7 conference win over
Oregon. This new attack, com
bined with John Brodie's nation
leading passing, may be the key
to open that Rose Bowl door.
Valli Romps
Junior fullback Lou Valli
ground out 100 yards in 17 tries
at Eugene, to pace a Stanford
ground attack that netted 209
yards. The Indians picked up 128
yards on passing. Even quarter
back Brodie got into the ground
rushing act, picking up 30 yards
in seven carries, his best after
noon on the ground this season.
But Brodie had a comparatively
bad day passing. A tight Oregon
aerial defense and a slightly
moist ball held -the nation's top
thrower down to 11 completions
in 21 tries for 91 yards. Paul
Camera grabbed four of the
tosses, including a 20-yard touch
down pass in the second quarter.
Defensively, the Indians turned
in their best performance of the
season. A stout Stanford forward
wall, paced again by All-Ameri
can tackle Paul Wiggin and
guards Noel Robinson and Donn
Carswell, corralled the fleet Web
foot ground attack and held the
Ducks to 132 yards rushing.
A fumble deep in Card terri
tory set, up Oregon's lone score
with less than a minuje left in
the game.
First Score
After missing a score by inches
in the first five minutes, Stan
ford pushed over Hie game's
opening t ouch d o W n midway
through the first period. Valli
plunged two yards for the six
points, the fourth time this sea
son he has scored the Cards' first
touchdown.
A 33-vard drive set in motion

i by Gordy Young's 22-yard punt
return led to the score. A 13-yard
| scamper by Valli and Brodie's 11-
! yard pass to Carl Isaacs were the
: big gainers.
An Oregon fumble on the Stan
ford 10-yard line started the
Tribe off on a bruising 90-yard
march to pay dirt late in the first
' quarter. Brodie engineered the
offensive which all but broke the
backs of the Ducks.
Twice he passed for first downs
tf) Camera and once to Troy Bar
bee on a tackle-eligible play. Valli
and Young played major roles in
the early stages of the drive, rip
ping off big chunks of yardage.
I Brodie capped the drive with a
20-yard strike to Camera, who
was standing alone on the goal
line. Doug Dick converted.
Final Score
The Indians returned late in
the third quarter to drive 73
yards in 12 plays for their final
touchdown. Valli rambled for 44
yards during the drive and cli
maxed it with a one-yard plunge
to the end zone.
Brodie fired two big passes in
the offensive, for 16 yards to
Isaacs and for 10 to Camera. Val
li personally took the ball over
from the 19 in carries of 11. three,
four and one. Mike Raftery's sec
ond conversion made it 21-0.
With their top two quarter
backs, Tom Crabtree and Jack
Crabtree, recovering from at
tacks of the flu, the Ducks were
forced to go with junior Roger
Daniels'in the signal-calling role.
Daniels' Work
Daniels completed three passes
for 80 yards, however, and filed
to halfback Charley Tourville for
22 yards and the Webfoot touch
down with only 28 seconds left in
the game.
Indian Coach Chuck Taylor
was pleased with the Cards'
showing on the ground and used
36 of 37 men on the traveling
squad. Lone injury was to tackle
John Kidd, who suffered a leg
bruise.
There was little doubt that
Wiggin was the outstanding line
man on the field. Big Paul re-es
tablished his bid for another All-
American rating with a great
performance, both offensively
and defensively.
