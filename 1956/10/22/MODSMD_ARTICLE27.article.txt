# PCC ROUNDUP
## Those Bad Guys Do It Again 
### 
The bad guy twins from the
Southland. USC and UCLA,
romped to victory again this
weekend, serving notice on PCC
members that while they may be
able to beat them across the con
ference table it's a little harder
across the scrimmage line.
UCLA Coach Red Sanders said
after the Bruins' 34-20 victory
over cousin California that "it is
our desire to win all of our
games." He said his Bruins
weren't especially pointing for
the Cal game.
But since it was Cal that first
blew the whistle on UCLA in the
recent PCC ineligibility and rule
violation hassle, most reporters
took the usually outspoken San
ders' words with a large grain of
salt.
UCLA took advantage of some
costly Cal mistakes in the win,
intercepting five passes and grab
bing up three Bear fumbles. Two

of the interceptions wore turned
into UCLA scores. The Bruins
also uncovered a passing attack
of their own with quarterback
Doug Bradley heaving two long
scoring throws.
The game was especially costly
for Bears as top quarterback
Joe Contestable was knocked
out for the year with torn knee
ligaments.
Southern California rolled
through, over and all around
Washington in a 35-7 win that
marked halfback Jon Arnett's
last home appearance. Appropri
ately enough the game was Ar
nett all the way with the speedy
back racking up 157 yards on the
ground.
