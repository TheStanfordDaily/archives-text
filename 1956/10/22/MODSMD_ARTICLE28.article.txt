# JV's in 54-0 Rout Of SJS; Nine Tally As Bench Cleared
## 
### 
Everybody got into the act in
the Stanford Braves' rout of the
San Jose State junior varsity in
San Jose Saturday.
Braves Coach Mai Elw a r d
| cleared the bench to help keep
the mounting, score down, but
still nine men scored for Stan
ford.
Quarterback Bob Nicolet com
pleted 10 of 1G passes for 132
yards and two touchdowns. Back
Hank Roldan also tallied twice,
once on a 38-yard run and once
on the scoring end of a 37-yard
pass play.
The Braves were expected to be
weakened by loss of key men 1o
the varsity, after a wholesale set
of injuries hit the Indians, but
they didn't show it in* Saturday's
performance.
Lbs Hopkins, formerly a back,
and Jim Chambers, an ex-tackle,
were moved to end to make up
for losses to the varsity and
showed to be promising receivers
in their first try at the flanker
spots.
Next weekend the Braves move
into action against the Treasure
Island Sailors in a game at the
University rugby field. They are
n't expected to find the going as
easy against the service eleven,
which is rated second only to
I powerful Hamilton Field in this
area.
