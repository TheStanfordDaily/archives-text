# Stanford Given Large Grants To Aid Government Research
## 3 SU Scientists Receive More Than $500,000 For Work on Earth-Circling Satellite Project

Are you adequately prepared for the International Geophysical
Year?
The International Geophysical Year is the period (possibly 1958)
when scientists are hoping to launch a man-made earth satellite into
space, where it will assume an earth-circling orbit.

Whether or not you are pre
paring for it, three Stanford Uni
versity scientists, with the aid of
a U.S. government grant, are mak
ing extensive preparations.
Dr. Alan M. Peterson, Dr. Rob
ert A. Helliwell and Dr. O. G. Bal
lard are working on the project,
for which Stanford has received
more than half a million dollars.
Helli well's project, covering
but one aspect of this gigantic
program, is to "establish the lati
tude dependence and occurrence
at conjugate geomagnetic loca
tions of whistlers in the west in
the International Geophysical
Year ionospheric physics pro
gram." Peterson is to make
"fixed 112 reque nc y backscatter
measurements" for the program.
Two Organizations
There are two government or
ganizations currently offering
grants to professors and scien
tists at Stanford University. They
are the U.S. Public Health Service
(USPHS> and the National Sci
ence Foundation (NSF). Last
year the University received al
most $820,000 in grants from the
USPHS. Grants are given in al
most all fields of study, but most
at Stanford are in fields dealing
with some aspect of science.
The NSF offers grants in engi
neering sciences, life sciences, and
mathematical and physical sci
ences. The USPHS offers grants
for research on most major dis
eases, mainly on cancer, heart
disease and mental health.
Campus Projects
There are also 65 to 70 projects
on campus under government con
tract. & grant is awarded after
consideration of a request by a
professor on campus; in the case
of contracts, the government asks
the University to undertake a
project.
The program of government re
search under contract on campus
is growing rapidly. It is expand
ing most quickly at present in the
School of Engineering and in re
search in nuclear physics.
Originally all the, University's
government contracts were with
the Navy. Now it holds contracts
with all branches of the national
defense as well as with the Atom
ic Energy Commission and other
government organizations.
Government Contracts
S t a nfo r d University receives
from $4 to $5 million in contracts
from the government on a cost
reimbursement basis. That is,
Stanford pays the money neces
sary for the work done and is
later reimbursed by the govern
ment.
The departments with the most
government contracts are Stan
ford Electronics Laboratories, the
W. W. Hansen Laboratory of High
Energy Physics and the Labora
tory of Applied Mathematics and
Statistics.
Much of the engineering work
is centered on communication and
radio. In this area scientists are
studying the effects of the aurora
on radio wave propagation.
