# Students Urged To Return Proofs To Quad Photog
## 
### 
Picture - taking and freshman
handbook sales continue this
week, according to Gary Willcuts,
editor of the 1957 Quad.
Orders for the handbooks will
be taken at the Quad office daily
from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. Quad or
ders will be accepted at the same
time.
Florence Moore women will be
photographed today, tomorrow
and Wednesday. All pictures will
be taken at the Quad office.
Off-campus students have until
Wednesday for pictures. The
photographer will be on duty
from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 p.m.
to 5 p.m.
Willcuts asked that students re
turn their proofs to the photog
rapher immediately. The Quad
has changed printers in an effort
to produce a more interesting and
higher quality book, but a new
system of deadlines has been es
tablished, Willcuts said.
"It is also vital that all stu
dents have their pictures taken
when their living groups are
scheduled. If people use the sign
up lists and come at the times
scheduled, there will be a mini
mum of waiting," he said.
