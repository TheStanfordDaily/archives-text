# UCLA, USC, SU Leaders Lay Plans to Avert Game Hostilities
## Southland Administrators, Students Pledge Co-operation, But Animosity Is Still Strong 
### Helen Dewar, Editor 
Stanford was invaded from the Southland last weekend, not with
animosity but with a spirit of goodwill and cooperation.
Student and administration representatives from Stanford, includ
ing Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Men William
Craig. ASSU President Bob Freelen and Rally Committee Chairman

Bill Lackey, met with leaders
from USC and UCLA Friday and
Saturday, respectively, to discuss
strategy to avert possible out
breaks of intercollege hostilities
at Stanford's next two football
games.
Because of the intense feeling
aroused in southern California
over the Pacific Coast Conference
controversy and the role Stanford
has played in it, tempers may
flare with the slightest instigation
at the USC game here Saturday
or the UCLA game in the Los An
geles Coliseum the following Sat
urday.
The consensus developed at the
two meetings was that, except for
the inevitable minority of trouble
makers—students, spirited alumni
or non-alumni loyal team support
ers—the Southland crowd at both
games will be a little less hostile
than expected.
USC Cooperation
The impression was that lead
ers from USC were willing to
offer any concession to see that
the game was played on the field
rather than at pre-game rallies or
in the stands.
USC plans to station about 20
members of their Knights, a body
corresponding to Rally Commit
tee, at Stanford's Friday night
rally and to have several Knights
riding in the float parade as an
outward symbol of cooperation.
Their card stunt ideas have been
"modified" since the season be
gan, one USC student said, and
extra precautions will be taken
for Tommy Trojan and his white
horse—the traditional USC mas
cots.
Yet there is latent animosity.
In the words of USC Student Body
President Carl Terzian: "II would
be wrong to say that most SC
students will be treating this
week-end game as just another
PCC contest. Certainly many are
disturbed at the result of this
summer's PCC meetings.
Blame Stanford
"Some even place a lot of the
blame for SC's penalties at Stan
ford's doorstep. But T refuse to
believe that our students are im
mature enough to disgrace the
university's good name by losing
their heads in Ihe Bay Area.
"We will, however, take every
measure to make sure the only
contest between the two schools
will be settled at the stadium."
It is estimated that about 4000
USC students will head north
ward for next Saturday's game,
the game that Terzian terms this
year's "big game."
Danger from Alumni
The UCLA group, including the
student activities adviser, the AS
UCLA vice-president, the head
cheer leader and the president of
Kelps—a "spirit" organization
expressed the view that the main
problem would come from over
zealous alumni and "football
alumni" who never went to UCLA
but fight each game harder than
the player's themselves. The con
sensus among Stanford leaders
was that feeling at UCLA was as
intense as that at USC, if not
more so.
The only trouble UCLA fore-
I sees is at the game itself, and
there they plan to take precau
tions to see that "no targets are
offered."
All pre-game homecoming ac
tivities and the card stunts, which
are approved beforehand by the
University administration, will
carry "an Olympic theme" in
honor of the U.S. Olympic team
i visiting UCLA that week end.
i UCLA and Stanford song leaders,
| and possibly head yell leader*,
will l>e exchanged during half
I time.
