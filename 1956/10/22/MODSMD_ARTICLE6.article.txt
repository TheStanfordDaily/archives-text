# Liquor Petition Age Changed From 18 to 19
## 
### 
The wording on the petitions
which have been circulating on
campus proposing a change in
California's drinking age limit has
been changed somewhat, accord
ing to petition circulator Lloyd
Downton.
Instead of advocating the lower
ing of the age limit to 18, the
latest petitions out in circulation
now place the proposed limit
at 19.
Downton said his committee
deemed it advisable to raise the
age one year because of the large
number of 18-year-olds who are
still in high school.
Omission
The section of the petition deal
ing with the percentage of alcohol
has been omitted from the latest
petitions.
According to Downton. the pe
titions containing the figure "18"
will still be valid since the pur
pose of the petitions is only to
bring the problem to the atten
tion of state legislators.
More than 500 signatures have
been received up to the present
time, he said. Also, petitions have
been circulating in San Francisco
State College, and by the end of
this week they are expected to
start circulating on other Califor
nia campuses.
Offers of Support
Downton said that offers of
support have come from individ
ual liquor establishments. Accord
ing to him: "We do not feel that
it would be advisable for us to
accept contributions from any
segment of the liquor industry.
"We are arguing from the
standpoint of students who feel
that we are mature and intelli
gent enough to drink beer and
light wines even though we may
not be 21 years of age.
"What the liquor industry does
in the way of helping to reduce
the age limit will, of course, be of
benefit to us. However, we do not
now, nor do we intend in the fu
ture, to work together with them."
