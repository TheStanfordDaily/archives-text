# Adlai Criticizes Ike's Dismissal Of Soviet Offer
## Says White Mouse Attitude on H-Bomb 'Hardly Consistent' 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 21 (UP)—Ad
la i E. Stevenson today criticized
President Eisenhower's dismissal
of the Russian offer to consider
an H-bomb ban and said the
White House attitude is hardly
consistent with Eisenhower's pre
vious estimate of Soviet inten
tions.'
Stevenson's statement on the
proposal by Russian Premier Bui
ganin for a U.S.-Soviet agreement
on outlawing H-bomb tests was
distributed to the press here by
the Democratic Presidential can
didate's press secretary, Clayton
Fritchey.
Prior to distributing Steven
son's statement on the latest Bul
ganin proposal, Fr itch e y an
nounced that 73 scientists at the
Atomic Energy Commission's Ar
gonne National Laboratory, Le
mont, 111., have endorsed Steven
son's stand on the banning of H
bomb tests.
The Argonne scientists reaf
firmed a previous statement by
10 nuclear scientists at the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology.
"Proposal Encouraging"
In the statement on Bulganin's
proposal, Stevenson said al
though there appears to be noth
ing now in the Russian sugges
tion, "it is encouraging that Rus
sia appears to be still disposed to
curb these dreadful weapons."
"Nobody can say at this point
how sincere the Russians are in
this matter, but I do know that
we cannot afford to let them con
tinuously appear before the rest
of the world as more devoted to
peace and disarmament than we
are," Stevenson's statement said.
"The White House seems to
have dismissed the Russian offer
out-of-hand, but the world and
the American people expect sober
consideration from our leaders of
all possibilities for reducing ten
sion and the damage of war—
most of all nuclear war.
"White House Attitude"
"This White House attitude is
hardly consistent with Eisen
hower's previous estimate of So
viet intentions. After all, it was
only last year at the Geneva sum
mit conference that the President
informed us the Soviet leaders de
sired peace just as much as we
did.
"Finally," Stevenson concluded,
"we should bear in mind that
curbing the H-bomb can be nder
taken without relying on Russian
good faith. Scientists have re
peatedly emphasized that H-bomb
explosions are detectable any
where in the world. As I said a
few days ago, you can't hide an
H-bomb explosion any more than
you can hide an earthquake."
