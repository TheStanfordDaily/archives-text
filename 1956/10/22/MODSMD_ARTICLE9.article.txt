# Homecoming Night Open for Campus Social Functions
## 
### 
After a minor tempest in So
cial Co-ordinating Board's teapot
last work the night of Homecom
ing, Oct, 27, has been changed to
an open dale.
Now any campus group wish
ing to hold a social function on
that date may do so.
Any campus social function
must he registered with the
Board or the group giving it is
subject tf) a fine, according to
chairman Sue Coshow.
Controversy was aroused when
several fraternities went to the
Board to register parties they
had planned for that niglil and
found it had been closed for the
Stern Homecoming dance.
At first Stern insisted the date
remain closed, since they needed
all possible attendance to pay for
their dance. But the fraternities,
which were already in the midst
of their preparations, said their
only course w?is to give the pat
ties anyway and be fined by the
Board.
Then the Board contacted Stern
Council, and they agreed to abide
by the Board's decision, which
was that the date be opened.
The question of whether closed
rlates should be allowed at all
will be brought up at ASStJ Leg
islature meeting Wednesday.
