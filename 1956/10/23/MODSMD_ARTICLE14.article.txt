## Upheaval Seen In Hungary as Students Act Russian Ships Appear Off Baltic Coastline; Pole Politburo Meets 
### 
WARSAW, Oct. 22 (UP) -So
viel naval cruisers steamed into
territorial waters of independent
minded Poland during the
official sources reported today.
Signs of Soviet military activity
in the defiant country occurred
as the new Polish Politburo the
elite of the party—met in the
capital to decide what to do about
Defense Minister Konstantin Ho
kossovsky, a Soviet army officer
sent to command military forces
in Poland in 1949.
The new "liberal" party lender
ship under Wladyslaw Gomulka
ousted him from the Politburo
last night, but he retained his
post as defense chief.
Official reports said the ap
pearance of "two or three" So
viet cruisers in waters off the
Baltic Sea port of Danzig caused
panic among coastal residents.
Troops Move In
Authoritative sources in Eerlin
reported "large numbers" of So
viet troops moving toward the
Polish border located 60 miles
from Berlin. These movements
have been under way for several
days, the sources said.
The Polish army itself appar
ently was loyal to Gomulka. Stu
dents and the command of the
Jaroslaw Dabrowski Military
Technical Academy last night met
to pledge "support of the demo
cratic forces within the leader
ship of the party."
Hungarian Upheaval
Meanwhile in Hungary, the
Hungarian radio broadcast a stu
dent demand for the re-appoint
ment of "Titoist" Imre Nagy as
premier.
Iron Curtain experts predicted
an early Polish-type government
upheaval in Hungary.
The students' agitation in Bu
dapest has been building, to the
point where they have threatened
street demonstrations to back
their demands for fewer restric
tions and a freer hand for univei
sity authorities in educational
fields.
Demand Public Trial
They also have demanded that
the * government hold a public
trial for former Defense Minister
Mihaly Farkas who was arrested
earlier this month on charges lie
fraudulently staged the trial of
former Foreign Minister Laszlo
Rajk in 1949. Rajk was executed
as a Titoist and was publicly re
habilitated this year under' the
de-Stalinzation program.
The students also demanded in
a resolution an "independent
Hungarian internal and foreign
policy to represent the true inter
ests of the nation."
It was considered significant
that the state • controlled radio
broadcast fully the student de
mands.
