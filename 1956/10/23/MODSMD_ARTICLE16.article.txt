# Adlai Shares Eisenhower's Resentment on Russ Letter
## Democrat Agrees Russian Note Is Interference, But Thinks Ike's Sharp Reply Is 'Unfortunate' 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 22 (UP)â€”Adlai E. Stevenson said tonight he
shares President Eisenhower's resentment at the manner and timing
of Russian Premier Bulganin's "interference" in the hydrogen bomb
dispute.
Stevenson added that Eisenhower's sharp reply to Bulganin's offer

to halt H-bomb tests was "unfor
tunate."
The nation's only course "is to
pursue this opening immediately
and all the way ... to close this
vital matter here and now or to
expose Mr. Bulganin's insincerity
to the world," the Democratic
Presidential candidate said.
Bulganin, in a weekend note to
the President, offered to halt
Russian tests of atomic weapons.
He noted that "certain prominent
public figures" in this country
have urged an agreement ending
the tests.
Urged Initiative
Stevenson has repeatedly urged
that the U.S. take the initiative in
working for a halt "to the testing
of H-bombs and has made it a top
campaign issue against Eisen
hower.
President Eisenhower replied
that Bulganin's note "constitutes
an interference by a foreign na
tion in our internal affairs."
Stevenson, who earlier criti
cized the administration for re
jecting the Russian offer "out of
hand," said today there are two
explanations of the Bulganin
note.
Stop Tests
"One is that Ihe Bulganin offer
thai Russia will stop testing hy
drogen bomb is made for propa
ganda purposes only and with a
complete lack of good faith," he
said.
''If that is true, if should be ex
posed for all the world to see.
"The other. possibility is that
the Russian offer, ill-timed as it
is, reflects an opportunity to
move ahead now toward a stop to
the further explosion of hydro
gen bombs.
"In either event there seems to
me only one course to follow.
That is to pursue this opening
immediately and all the way. I
think we should do whatever is
necessary either to close this vital
matter here and now, or to ex
pose Mr. Bulganin's insincerity to
the world."
