A STEP TOWARDS RIGHTING one of the big aca
demic wrongs at Stanford has been taken by
the University Academic Council.
For many years a farcical situation in exami
nations has existed. Some professors, appar
ently getting by with as little work as possible,
gave the same examination year after year, and
others varied the examinations only by putting
the questions in different order.
In order to make the tests as hard for the
following year's classes, they collected the ex
aminations and took special pains that none
would leave their offices. But always there were
a few enterprising individuals who managed
to obtain copies for their fraternity or dormi
tory files. The next year the few chosen groups
that had copies of the examinations had an
unfair advantage over those that did not.
Now the situation has been changed. Pro
fessors are not allowed to repeat more than a
few items from the previous year's test. And
copies of past examinations must be made
available to all students.
Not only does the Academic Council's action
correct this serious inequality; more important,
it should help to create a better intellectual

emphasis at Stanford. Tt should help to make
the student think for himself.
For we contend that to memorize a copy of
the previous year's examination and its answers,
without ever reasoning out the subject matter,
is education unworthy of high schools â€” let
alone a university of the high academic caliber
of Stanford.
The newly revised General Studies Program,
under which a broader background of courses
is needed for graduation and under which every
person must have a two-unit senior colloquium,
or seminar, not in his major field, is another
important step in encouraging the student to
think for himself.
We hope that, with the new General Studies
Program and the Academic Council ruling, the
large lecture class with its multiple-choice and
true-false tests, varying little from year to year,
is also on the way out.
For only in classes with actual contact be
tween students and professors, and classes in
which examinations make a student reason and
analyze the subject matter rather than memo
rize and recite last year's test answers, can true
education and the stimulation of intellectual
maturity exist.
