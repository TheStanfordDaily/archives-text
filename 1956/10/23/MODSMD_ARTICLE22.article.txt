# IN OTHER CAMPUSES—By Mary Ellen Romney
## Fires Rock Homecoming at Idaho University 
### 
Homecoming celebrations and political speeches
occupied the time and attention of college stu
dents across the nation last week. Adlai Steven
son and Richard Nixon sandwiched in election
addresses to college groups involved in frenzies
of float-building and queen-choosing.

Tragedy interrupted the homecoming happi
ness at the University of Idaho Friday. Three
freshman men were killed and four seriously
injured when Gault Hall, the newest campus
dormitory, exploded in flames.
The fire, which broke out around 2 a.m., burned
for an hour before three fire trucks and more
than 1000 students brought it under control. Stu
dents sleeping in the dormitory had to be alerted
individually because the residents of the adjoining
men's dorm, who discovered the blaze, were
unable to make the fire siren work.
The fire was the third within the week at the
Idaho campus. Two others had been quelled be
fore they got out of control at the men's dormi
tories the preceding week end. Signs of arson
were discovered at the sites of all three fires.
The hot explosion which set off the Gault Hall
blaze indicated that petroleum was probably used
to start the fire.

At USC a group of student leaders and faculty
members headed for a week end in the San
Jacinto Mountains for their annual Idylwild Con
ference. Away from the roar of campus activities,
the group considered such matters as how to
increase the intellectual atmosphere and attitude
at USC.
Peter Synodis, Daily Trojan editor, described

the difficulties facing the quest for intellectual
ism: "One of the stark realities at SC is that the
campus harbors a myriad of social and profes
sional organizations—approximately 200. Many
students, conditioned by the concept that college
is a place to make friends and influence people,
dive headlong into a labyrinth of constitutional
agendas, refreshments and decorations commit
tees and publicity chairmanships."
Speaking of the force of social prestige on
campus, he remarked: "This premium on social
pressure is most devastating on the How, where
success or failure of a sorority or fraternity
pivots on the annual harvest of organization
chairmanships and presidencies. In many fra
ternities, scholastic goals are set at achieving
the minimum grade-point average permissible at
the university."
The women are complaining about the Row,
too: "The men favor those groups which com
mand greatest prestige on campus. The women
further contend that there is a cultural stagna
tion on the Row born of the fact that fraternity
men 'never invite women to see a ballet or attend
the symphony.'"
The cure? "A re-evaluation of purposes and
methods" on the part of faculty members.
* * #
And at Cal liquor raised its ugly head in time
for All-University Weekend. The student judicial
committee cracked down on "suit-casing" football
games and recommended two one-quarter suspen
sions on such violations. The Dean of Men re
minded fraternities that no liquor was to be
served at house functions held on or off campus.

for All-University Weekend. The student judicial
committee cracked down on "suit-casing" football
games and recommended two one-quarter suspen
sions on such violations. The Dean of Men re
minded fraternities that no liquor was to be
served at house functions held on or off campus.
Homecoming celebrations and political speeches
occupied the time and attention of college stu
dents across the nation last week. Adlai Steven
son and Richard Nixon sandwiched in election
addresses to college groups involved in frenzies
of float-building and queen-choosing.

Tragedy interrupted the homecoming happi
ness at the University of Idaho Friday. Three
freshman men were killed and four seriously
injured when Gault Hall, the newest campus
dormitory, exploded in flames.
The fire, which broke out around 2 a.m., burned
for an hour before three fire trucks and more
than 1000 students brought it under control. Stu
dents sleeping in the dormitory had to be alerted
individually because the residents of the adjoining
men's dorm, who discovered the blaze, were
unable to make the fire siren work.
The fire was the third within the week at the
Idaho campus. Two others had been quelled be
fore they got out of control at the men's dormi
tories the preceding week end. Signs of arson
were discovered at the sites of all three fires.
The hot explosion which set off the Gault Hall
blaze indicated that petroleum was probably used
to start the fire.

At USC a group of student leaders and faculty
members headed for a week end in the San
Jacinto Mountains for their annual Idylwild Con
ference. Away from the roar of campus activities,
the group considered such matters as how to
increase the intellectual atmosphere and attitude
at USC.
Peter Synodis, Daily Trojan editor, described

the difficulties facing the quest for intellectual
ism: "One of the stark realities at SC is that the
campus harbors a myriad of social and profes
sional organizations—approximately 200. Many
students, conditioned by the concept that college
is a place to make friends and influence people,
dive headlong into a labyrinth of constitutional
agendas, refreshments and decorations commit
tees and publicity chairmanships."
Speaking of the force of social prestige on
campus, he remarked: "This premium on social
pressure is most devastating on the How, where
success or failure of a sorority or fraternity
pivots on the annual harvest of organization
chairmanships and presidencies. In many fra
ternities, scholastic goals are set at achieving
the minimum grade-point average permissible at
the university."
The women are complaining about the Row,
too: "The men favor those groups which com
mand greatest prestige on campus. The women
further contend that there is a cultural stagna
tion on the Row born of the fact that fraternity
men 'never invite women to see a ballet or attend
the symphony.'"
The cure? "A re-evaluation of purposes and
methods" on the part of faculty members.
