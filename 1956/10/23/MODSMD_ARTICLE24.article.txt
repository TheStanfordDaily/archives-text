# Letters to the Editor
## 
### 
Editor's Note: During the past tew weeks,
we have received many letters which, because
of their quantity and length, we have not been
able to print. We should like to print all letters
we receive, but space limitations prevent this.
We request that all letters sent to The Daily
be kept to 150 words or less; if they are longer,
we reserve the right to cut them, but shall try
to remove only repetitive or extraneous parts.
When a number of letters are received on a
single issue, we will select those we consider
moiit pertinent to both sides.
All letters must be accompanied by name,
address and phone number.
A short, concisely worded letter is looked
upon with favor by the editor.
Arguments Againsl Proposition 4
Editor, Jhe Daily:
Although Dave Scott's article in last Friday's
Daily regarding Proposition 4 was no doubt a
sincere attempt to present both sides of the con
troversy, he seems to have accepted and repeated
a great deal of the misinformation and half
truths purveyed in quantity by the proponents
of the "Yes" viewpoint.
I should like to even things up by supplement
ing and criticizing his article with some further
arguments from the "No" side.
Scott mentions first the word which is hurled
about with vigor by the major oil company pitch
men "waste."
The act gives the proposed three-man commis
sion power "to prevent waste in any pool and to
make any order which may be necessary or
proper for lhat purpose. . . ." Thus the com
mission can regulate nearly every phase of drill
ing and production, with only vague and gen
eral phraseology to guide their action in deter
mining well spacing, production rates and pro
duction techniques, subjects on which the best
geologists and the producers consistently dis
agree. *
Td understand the unwisdom of this proposi
tion, it must be realized that many California
oil-fields are not massive pools tapped by wells
like drinking straws in a spiked coconut. In
reality, ihey are often twisted, faulted jumbles
of strata holding oil in comparatively small pock
ets. Geology is terribly difficult, and even the
most astute oilmen proceed quite often on little
more than "calculated hunches." To this extent,
Scott's term "confused" may be applied to the
California oil system.
In the situation I have described, a state geol
ogist with little or no first-hand knowledge of
the peculiar and unpredictable characteristics of
a given production area may recommend that
the commission shut down a substantial drilling
investment that may do no harm whatsoever.
Certainly the commission is in even a worse po
sition to make a sound decision. The end result
may be harm rather than good, for wells shut
down may clog up and never produce anything
again.
There is a strong intimation in Scott's article
that the act must be passed to force unitization
on the "spoilers" who supposedly drill so many
wells that they drain the oil out of an area so
fast that gas pressure behind the oil is dimin
ished to the point where only 30 per cent of the
oil is taken from the ground.
It is doubtful that the rate or volume of pro
duction has any major effect on the "lift" done
by natural gas. Either you get it all right now,
or you get a little air; the practice ceased about
20 years ago. Where the 30 per cent figure came
from I don't know, but you won't find many inde
pendent geologists to accept it.
This is not to knock the benefits of unitization
in areas whose geologic structure permits it. At
this time, 239,500 barrels of oil per day—2s per
ccnt of California's total production—is being re
covered under voluntary unit or collective agree
ments. This is a greater percentage than in any
other state. There is no new process of second
ary oil recovery which hasn't been tried out and
adopted if it proved its value.
Before leveling a charge of "wastefulness" at
California's oil system, I suggest the budding
journalist take a good look at what's going on
in the oilfields. As they appear feasible and ulti
mately profitable to oilmen, unitization setups
will be adopted without them being forced down
anybody's throat.
"It is recognized," says Scott, "that some con
servation measure is needed." If he will consult
the Public Resources Code, he will find that a
conservation measure was enacted in 1915 and
amended in 1929 and 1955. Provided for is regu
lation of gas blowout and underground waste.
The laws in Texas, Oklahoma and other states
are not conservation laws, but production-control
laws, enacted when production in those states
was far outstripping demand. In contrast, Cali
fornia's production has never been able to meet
her requirements.
There are strong legal and political objections
to the act as well as economic ones, but Scott has

presented those in his article, even if not as
strongly as is warranted.
Finally, I suggest a long look at who is for
this proposal and who is against it. On one side
-—more or less alone—are the major oil compa
nies (with the exception of Union Oil), not one
of which is incorporated in California. On the
other side are all the independent oil companies
and their suppliers, plus the CIO-AFL and other
groups. The Richfield Oil Co. has been booming
this proposition for years, and as far as I know,
w T as responsible for its authorship.
Consider the fact that if California oil pro
duction is curtailed, and it becomes necessary
to import foreign oil, the principal owners of
Richfield just happen to own a great amount of
overseas oil. In any case, the passage of this
bill by the electorate will inspire some sad re
flections on the democratic process, wherein a
wealthy pressure group was able to write a bill,
hire petition circulators to get it on the ballot,
and then get it made into law with a razzle-dazzle
publicity campaign.

A Right to Privacy
Editor, The Daily:
You are to be commended on your advocacy
of eliminating the publishing of grades in the
Bawlout. We hope that you continue your cam
paign to rid the campus of this manifestation of
pseudo-intellectual nonsense.
We submit that a student's grades, like his
family life or his religion, are his own private
affair. No other persons but *the University
ought to be familiar with those grades, and even
then the subject should only be discussed be
tween the student and the University tdte-ci-tete.
It is doubtful, at the most, if students are
prodded into more intense intellectual endeavor
by the publicity given to the grade-point average.
Let the University come forward with some af
firmative evidence, if it can, to the effect that
students react to this publicity something in the
manner of a race-horse responding to his jock
ey's switching.
If it is discovered that the publicity is vital
in order to give students fresh impetus to com
pete with their fellows, then it is a sad commen
tary on the spirit and ambition of every student
here, and on the University, which prides itself
as "the Harvard of the West" that no attempt
will be made to study harder unless the harsh
whip of publicity is continually applied.
If, however, it cannot be shown that this pub
licity pushes the student to greater exertions,
what reason exists for publishing his grades?
To inform the faculty? A quick call to the Re
corder's Office will supply the professor with all
the information he needs on these rare occasions.
To inform other students? It's none of their
business.
We are somehow confident that this crazy,
mixed-up planet of ours will continue to spin
whether or not Bawlout grades are eliminated.
But it would be comforting to know that a great
university reaffirmed its faith in a common de
cency so frequently lost sight of in our mass
society—the right to privacy.

How About Speed Laws?
Editor, The Daily:
You say your reason for wanting the drinking
law changed is that it is not "progressive" be
cause persons under 21 will drink regardless of
the law.
If lack of obedience is a reason for changing
a law then something should be done about the
state speed limit. People don't obey the 55-m.p.h.
limit on Bayshore; they prefer driving at 60 or
'0 m.p.h. and few get tickets. Why don't you
start a campaign to raise the speed limit to 75
m.p.h. or do away with it entirely?

Chaparral Barks Back
Editor, The Daily: s
Stellar staff, all of them bonehead writers,
Frauding facts, twisting the truth."
That was the way a verse from our epic ran
last year in the Spring Sing! What was suspicion
has now become conviction.
Your specious and supercilious observer, Earl
Cilley, designated Thursday as the "black, black
day" when Chappies will be available.
True to form and the rest of The Daily, Cilley
missed again. Wednesday, sir is the day of de
liverance, the day when the year's first Chappie
hits the long-suffering campus. And Thursday,
sir, is a day like all days, made more dismal by
the appearance of your miserable fact-frauder.
