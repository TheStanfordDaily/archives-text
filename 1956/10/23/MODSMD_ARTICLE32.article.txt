# Van Galder, Docter, Long Return to Football Scene
## Windsprints, Scout Report Are Order of Day As Gridders Prep for Southern California 
### 
The USC-game week got off to
an auspicious start with the re
turn to practice of three first
stringers who were shelved with
a variety of ailments earlier in
tl\e season.
£nd Gary Van Galder. tackle
Steve Docter and center Boh Long
were all working out without
pads. Long, who came down with
mononucleosis, is almost sure to
see action. This week's practice
will determine whether Van Gal
der and Docter have recovered
from their knee injuries suffi
ciently to lace the Trojans Sat
urday.
Second - string end Joel Freis
was also testing his muscle strain
and may see action.
Definitely out of action is re
serve halfback Bill Burget, who
has a severely sprained ankle. In
the pre-game warm-ups at Ore
gon, Burget stepped on a cement
curbing while trying to dodge a
photographer, and his ankle gave
way.
John Kidd, junior tackle, turned
up with two cracked bones in the
back (transverse processes), but

the bones are minor ones, and,
with a special pad, he will be able
to play full strength against the
Trojans.
All American tackle Paul Wig
gin has two badly •sp r a in e d
thumbs, but, as trainer Connie
Jarvis pointed out, "a tackle
doesn't need thumbs."
Others who sat out yesterday's
practice'were fullbacks Lou Valli
and Doug Dick, with minor leg
hurts.
Chuck Taylor's charges were
given defenses for USC yesterday
and also ran through the most ex
tensive wind sprints since the first
game.
Last night Back field Coach
George Lynn, who has watched
USC in two games, gave the scout
report, and the team watched pic
tures of last year's USC-Stanford
game, which the Cards won, 28-20.
No full-dress scrimmages are
scheduled for this week, as the
coaching staff figures it already
has enough gimpy players.

urday.
Second - string end Joel Freis
was also testing his muscle strain
and may see action.
Definitely out of action is re
serve halfback Bill Burget, who
has a severely sprained ankle. In
the pre-game warm-ups at Ore
gon, Burget stepped on a cement
curbing while trying to dodge a
photographer, and his ankle gave
way.
John Kidd, junior tackle, turned
up with two cracked bones in the
back (transverse processes), but

the bones are minor ones, and,
with a special pad, he will be able
to play full strength against the
Trojans.
All American tackle Paul Wig
gin has two badly •sp r a in e d
thumbs, but, as trainer Connie
Jarvis pointed out, "a tackle
doesn't need thumbs."
Others who sat out yesterday's
practice'were fullbacks Lou Valli
and Doug Dick, with minor leg
hurts.
Chuck Taylor's charges were
given defenses for USC yesterday
and also ran through the most ex
tensive wind sprints since the first
game.
Last night Back field Coach
George Lynn, who has watched
USC in two games, gave the scout
report, and the team watched pic
tures of last year's USC-Stanford
game, which the Cards won, 28-20.
No full-dress scrimmages are
scheduled for this week, as the
coaching staff figures it already
has enough gimpy players.
Among the sideline spectators
at yesterday's practice was Presi
dent J. E. Wallace Sterling.
