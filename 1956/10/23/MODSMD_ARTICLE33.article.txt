# Taylor Urges Students Attend Open Practice Session Today
## 
### 
Thi?, Is the week to climb on
the bandwagon.
With Pacific Coast Conference
action in full swing, the Indians
of Stanford have their work cut
out for them. The next five Sat
urdays will see the Cards facing
the five toughest opponents in
the PCCâ€”all five. Southern Cali
fornia, UCLA, Oregon State,
Washington and California, out
to "beat Stanford."
The difference between win
ning and losing these important
tilts couid well be decided by the
Stanford student body. Any team
needs support; with such a tough
schedule ahead, Coach Chuck
Taylor's outfit will need the back
ing of each and every Stanford
student.
Coach Taylor outlined a plan
at the start of the season to help
support the team with added en
thusiasm and spirit. Each Tues
day afternoon the student body is

invited to attend the varsity foot
ball practice.
The team begins daily workout
at 4 p.m. on the enclosed practice
field. During the two-hour prac
tice Taylor will keep the audience
informed of the practice proce
dures through the use of a loud
speaker.
Taylor admits, however, that
unless a sizable student group
participates, narration will not he
forthcoming.
Here's an opportunity to show
the team that Stanford is behind
them.
This is the week to climb on
the bandwagon.
