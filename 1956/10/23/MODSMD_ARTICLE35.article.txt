George M. Lynn, least well
known of Stanford's football
coaches, is the man who holds
the key to the Indians' football
fortunes against ominous USC
this Saturday.
On the broad shoulders of Lynn,
varsity backfield coach, fell the
chore of scouting El Trojan for
Coach Chuck Taylor.
George, as he is called by the
Indian gridders, brought a long
background of football experience
with him when he came to Stan
ford in 1951, this despite his be
ing a mere 30 years old at the
time.
He played quarterback under
the sharp eye of Paul Brown at
Ohio State from 1941 to 1943 and
was captain of the great 1942
Buckeye eleven.
After a 2V2-year stint in the
Navy, George went to Oklahoma,
where he assisted the amazingly
successful Bud Wilkinson until
1951.
He rates present Indian quar
terback John Brodie as the best
passer he has seen. "Though not
a very dangerous runner, I'm sure
that Brodie will be equally as good
as former Stanford All-American
Bob Garrett," the backfield coach
said.
Coach Taylor's wide - open
offense featuring much passing
by the quarterback enables the
Indians to compete successfully
in Pacific Coast Conference play.
Stanford has been fortunate to
have consistently outstanding
passers under Taylor. "Wide-open
offensive play naturally attracts
good T-quarterbacks like Brodie
and Garrett," Lynn explained.
George was born in Niles, Ohio,
in 1921. Combining studies with
athletics, he holds a B.S. degree
from Ohio State and received an
M.A. degree from Kent State in
1954.
During his tour in the Navy
George achieved the rank of lieu
tenant.
Lynn is married and has three
children — Cathy, 8; Barbara, 6,
and Tommy, 2. 1-Ie maintains that
"California is the greatest place
to live" and adds that only a chal
lenging head coach's job could
take him away from Stanford.

terback John Brodie as the best
passer he has seen. "Though not
a very dangerous runner, I'm sure
that Brodie will be equally as good
as former Stanford All-American
Bob Garrett," the backfield coach
said.
Coach Taylor's wide - open
offense featuring much passing
by the quarterback enables the
Indians to compete successfully
in Pacific Coast Conference play.
Stanford has been fortunate to
have consistently outstanding
passers under Taylor. "Wide-open
offensive play naturally attracts
good T-quarterbacks like Brodie
and Garrett," Lynn explained.
George was born in Niles, Ohio,
in 1921. Combining studies with
athletics, he holds a B.S. degree
from Ohio State and received an
M.A. degree from Kent State in
1954.
During his tour in the Navy
George achieved the rank of lieu
tenant.
Lynn is married and has three
children — Cathy, 8; Barbara, 6,
and Tommy, 2. 1-Ie maintains that
"California is the greatest place
to live" and adds that only a chal
lenging head coach's job could
take him away from Stanford.

George M. Lynn, least well
known of Stanford's football
coaches, is the man who holds
the key to the Indians' football
fortunes against ominous USC
this Saturday.
On the broad shoulders of Lynn,
varsity backfield coach, fell the
chore of scouting El Trojan for
Coach Chuck Taylor.
George, as he is called by the
Indian gridders, brought a long
background of football experience
with him when he came to Stan
ford in 1951, this despite his be
ing a mere 30 years old at the
time.
He played quarterback under
the sharp eye of Paul Brown at
Ohio State from 1941 to 1943 and
was captain of the great 1942
Buckeye eleven.
After a 2V2-year stint in the
Navy, George went to Oklahoma,
where he assisted the amazingly
successful Bud Wilkinson until
1951.
He rates present Indian quar
terback John Brodie as the best
passer he has seen. "Though not
a very dangerous runner, I'm sure
that Brodie will be equally as good
