# Iraq Minister Blames Israel For Red Gains in Middle East
## 
### Anne Johnson 
You can't keep Communism from exploiting the Middle East if
you continue to ignore what Israel is doing, Iraq Minister of Finance
Khalil Kenna said last week end.
Explaining his country's decision to supply Jordan with military
aid, he said the major cause of instability in the area has been the

creation of Israel. It would be to
the United States' interest to drop
its policy of friendship toward
Israel, he said. There are a mil
lion other refugees in the Middle
East hungry and homeless who
need to be helped.
"They have nothing to lose,"
Kenna pointed out. "These refu
gees will welcome anyone who is
willing to help them. What do
you expect them to do?" he
added.
The Iraq minister gave two
reasons why Iraq will help Jor
dan in the event Israel attacks
that country.
Ambitions Believed
Most important is the fact Iraq
believes Israel has ambitions all
over the Middle East area. "They
cannot limit themselves to the
narrow strip they are- on now,"
he said. '.'Thus they are a direct
danger to us."
Long-standing military agree
ments with Jordan to come to its
aid in case of any attack was his
second reason.
"We hope that the United Na
tions and the United States will
see that Israel abandons its pro
gram of aggression," he said,
commenting on the possibility of
war.
Simple Question
Kenna commented that the
Suez crisis is not a question of
nationalization as that is univer
sally accepted. It is simply who
j will run the canal program.
Iraq, cfrie of the big Middle East
oil countries, ships one-fourth of
its oil through the Sue/ by tanker
and the rest by pipeline to the
Mediterranean.
Kenna and his wife came to the
United States last month to at-'
tend an international conference
in Washington.
"We are now traveling through
the country getting acquainted
with the people we admire and
love," he said. The Kennas will
return to Iraq next month.
