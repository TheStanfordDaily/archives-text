# Faculty Rules Against Repeat Of Any Exams
## Academic Council Aims To Lessen Assistance Given by Test Files 
### 
The repetition of the same ex
amination from year to year or
quarter to quarter is now a thing
of the past, according to a re
cently publicized ruling of the
University Academic Council that
was passed on June 15.
The council's ruling was passed,
on recommendation of the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code
Commission, for the main pur
pose of alleviating inequities ere-'
ated by some dormitories or
houses having copies of- the pre
vious year's examinations and
some not having them.
Academic Council consists of all
the permanent professors, associ
ate professors and assistant pro
fessors on the Stanford faculty.
According to Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler, secretary of ■
the council, the following rulings
will bo put into effect:
• From an examination which
includes many items individual
items may safely be repeated oc
casionally. However, the repeti
tion of test items at short inter
vals or in any regular pattern Is
not good practice.
• The consulting of sample ex
aminations has presumed educa
tional value to the student. Ac
cordingly, it is desirable that ex
aminations which have been used
previously be available to stu
dents.
• Insofar as it is feasible, fac
ulty members are urged to co
operate with student groups in
their efforts to maintain files of
examination questions in resi
dences and in the Library.
• In most instances attempts to
prevent the circulation of previ
ously given examinations are not i
desirable. It is recognized, fur- |
thermore, that such efforts are in
fact not desirable. It is recog
nized. furthermore, that such ef
forts are in fact not likely to
succeed.
