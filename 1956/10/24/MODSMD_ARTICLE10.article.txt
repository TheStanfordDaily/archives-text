power after five years in pwson
as a "Titoist," spoke by telephone
with Khrushchev, who is in Mos
cow. Khrushchev offered Gomul
ka congratulations on his election
last Sunday as chief of the party,
they said.
Shortly after the telephone con
versation a flotilla of 26 Soviet
vessels, including three cruisers
and 17 destroyers and trawlers,
began dispersing from the Gulf of
Danzig, part of Poland's territo
rial waters.
At the same time Russian
ground troops withdrew from po
sitions near Byegoszoz, 175 miles
northwest of Warsaw; from Lodz,
75 miles southwest of Warsaw,
and from the Carwolin Forest, 40
miles southeast of the capital city
on the Russian border, according
to authoritative reports.
These Soviet ground units, esti
mated to number five divisions,
already were in Poland at the
time of Gomulka's rise to party
leadership last week. They were
engaged in joint maneuvers with
Poland's army.
De-Russianized
The Polish armed forces were
steadily being de-Russianized.
The Warsaw government today
appointed "Titoist" Gen. Marian
Spychalski as deputy defense min
ister under pro-Soviet Defense
Chief Konstantin Rokossovsky.
It was reported that a Polish
commodore identified only as
"Wisniewski" had taken over the
Polish Navy from an unidentified
Russian admiral, who returned to
Moscow two days ago.
Spychalski, who, like Gomulka,
had been rehabilitated and re
stored to rank this year, was
named head of the Army's chief
political board.
The Air Force was reported go
ing along with demands by Polish
Army and Navy leaders for a "de
mocratization" of the armed
forces. The Polish-born Rokossov
sky remained a question mark.
Students paraded in Poznan de
manding his ouster as defense
chief. "Down with Rokossov
sky," they shouted. They tried to
get workers to join the demon
stration. The city was tense.

manding his ouster as defense
chief. "Down with Rokossov
sky," they shouted. They tried to
get workers to join the demon
stration. The city was tense.
