# Students, Faculty Are Stunned By Professor Leavelle's Death
## Freelen, Watkins, Winbigler Express Sorrow; Services to Be Tomorrow in Memorial Church 
### 
Students and faculty members were both stunned to hear of Pro
fessor Arnaud B. Leavelle's untimely death Monday evening. Ex
pressions of deep regret and sorrow pervaded the campus all day
yesterday.
Perhaps the feelings of the students can be best expressed by
what ASSU President Bob Freelen said at the news of Leavelle's

death: "Dr. Leavelle's tragic
death is not only a serious aca
demic loss to the University, but
also a personal loss to the many
students who have admired and
been associated with him."
Personal Loss
While the students felt a per
sonal loss, his colleagues were
deeply shocked. As his depart
ment head Dr. James T. Watkins
said, "He came to Stanford at
the same time I did, ten years
ago. He had always been very
respected by students and fac
ulty. He wasn't given to contro
versyâ€” but his words were al
ways given great weight in de
partment councils. He was an
extremely loyal associate and we
all loved him."
The administration also grieved
at the loss of Leavelle. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler
said yesterday, "Both personally
and officially I seriously feel Pro
fessor Leavelle's loss. His gifts
included a rare combination of
outstanding scholarship in politi
cal science, teaching
and fine service on faculty com
mittees."
Services
Memorial services for Leavelle
will be held at 4 p.m. tomorrow in
Memorial Church. Services will
be conducted by Chaplain Minto.
Watkins will deliver Ihe memo
rial address.
No time has as yet been set for
the funeral services.
