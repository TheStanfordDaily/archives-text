# Professor Defends Ike in Political Union Address
## 
### 
C. P. Cotter, associate profes
sor of political science, spoke to
the Republican caucus of the Po
litical Union yesterday on why he
plans to vote for Eisenhower.
Cotter, who is head of the
Northern California Committee
of the Arts and Sciences for Ei
senhower, said that he thinks Ike,
although perhaps not as much of
an intellectual as Stevenson, has
demonstrated his ability to make
the right decisions.
He also approves Eisenhower's
ideas on government, such as giv
ing the Vice-President more re
sponsibility and delegating some
powers to other parts of the exec
utive branch, instead of keeping
them all personally.
Under Eisenhower, Cotter stat
ed, the Cabinet has become for
the first time a real advisory
body, almost a decision - making
organization.
Cotter pointed to the Eisen
hower administration's achieve
ments of the soil bank program
in the field of agriculture, the in
crease in anti-trust actions and
enforcement in the last four
years and the additional acres
that have been added to national
parks and wild-life preserves.
