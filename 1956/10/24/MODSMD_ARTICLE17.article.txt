WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 (UP) -
President Eisenhower, offering
encouragement to Poland and
other restive Communist satel
lites, pledged the United States
tonight to help "freedom-loving
peoples who need and want and
can profitably use our aid."
Eisenhower, in his first address
of the political campaign before a
strictly union gathering, also pre
dicted the Russian satellite sys
tem eventually will break down
under the weight of "discontent,
unrest, riots in one place and dem
onstrations in another."
Asserting that the United States
has "a mission" in the world as
the "champion of human free
dom," the Chief Executive laid
down the following four-point pro
gram to guide this country in its
policies toward captive peoples:
• Never to compromise on Ihe
fundamental principle that ";ill
peoples who have proved them
selves capable of self-government
have a right, to an independent
government of their own full,
free choice."
• "To help those freedom-loving
peoples who need and want and
can profitably use our aid, that
they may advance in their ability
for self - support and may add
strength to the security and peace
of the world."
• To join other nations "in a
genuine partnership of trade, fos
tering a spiral of mutually-shared
prosperity and abundance that
will be proof against all propa
ganda and subversion."
• To exemplify at home the
benefits of a free system so that
the world will recognize in human
freedom "the sure road to human
good."
