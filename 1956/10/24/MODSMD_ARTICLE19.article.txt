### 
With the untimely and shocking death of
Arnaud Leavelle, Stanford — and indeed the
whole academic community—has lost one of
its most brilliant, respected and beloved pro
fessors.
To those of us who knew him even slightly,
his dignity, human compassion and courage
marked him as a scholar and man far above
the average, as a superlative individual who
overcame serious physical handicaps to excel
in matters of the mind and spirit.
His manner was always warm and friendly.
The work he demanded of his students infused
in them a discipline of the mind and a sharper

understanding and more intense feeling for the
complexities of political thought.
Words are a pathetic medium through which
to describe the contribution this man made to
his university and his students; his true testi
monial is the profound feeling of loss felt by
each student who knew and loved him and the
professors who worked with him.
Although death struck at a young ape, it left
behind an outstanding record of accomplish
ment and a brief life lived to the fullest. As
was said by one of his colleagues yesterday
morning, '*It is not the length of life that mat
ters, hut the intensity with which it is lived."
