# Eleven Years Toward Peace
## 
### 
Eleven years ago today the United Nations
Charter received its final ratification and the
United Nations became the embodiment of
man's hope for peace through international
cooperation.
Today throughout the world there are UN
Day celebrations. Although the only physical
evidence of UN Day at Stanford this year will
be a carillon concert of international music,
UN Day and the organization it commemorates
have obvious far-reaching effects on Stanford
and the rest of the world.
The disputes the United Nations has been
called upon to settle have generally been re
gional. Until this year it had dealt with five
major regional problemsâ€”in the Balkans, Pal
estine, Kashmir, Indonesia and Korea.

Since the opening of this session the UN
Security Council has had two important dis
putes brought before it for settlement: the Suez
situation and, beginning today, the problem of
Israel-Jordan border clashes.
In solving the problems brought before it,
the United Nations has helped in keeping an
uneasy world from war. In other, less visible
ways, through its technical agencies and now
through the new Atoms for Peace Program, the
United Nations has led the world further along
the road to peace.
But any organization is only as strong as the
will of its members. The United Nations is no
exception. On this, its lltli anniversary, it
stands as a bulwark against any nation or group
of nations who seek to endanger world peace.
