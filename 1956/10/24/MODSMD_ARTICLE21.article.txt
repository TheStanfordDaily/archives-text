# FROM ANOTHER VIEW POINT
## Background of Polish Uprising Analyzed 
### Dr. Witold S. Sworakowski 
Editor's Note: Because of
their outstanding: backgrounds,
experience and studies, Stan
ford profesosrs are In a posi
tion to offer thorough and
thought â–  provoking comments
on current national and inter
national affairs.
The following article on the
causes and implications of the
recent Polish uprising was writ
ten by Dr. VVitold Sworakow
ski. expert on East European
affairs and assistant director of
Hoover Institute and Library.
Sworakowski studied politi
cal science and international re
lations at the Academy of Po
litical Science in Warsaw until
1033 and was In the Polish for
eign service until 1945.
He has written two books
and many articles on Poland.

The recent riots in Poznan and
last week's political events in
Warsaw have been received by
American opinion with surprise.
In reality, these developments are
only the most prominent episodes
in a prolonged political process
which the Poles themselves call
"the Thaw."
It all started with the purge
and execution of Beria. The
dreaded Soviet secret police had
not only the U.S.S.R. in its
clutches. Its grip on the enslaved
nations was perhaps even more
thorough. But once Beria and his
"apparatus" had been disposed of
in Russia, its branches in the
"People's Democracies" could not
survive long.
Under pressure of the lower
ranks of Poland's Communist
party the Warsaw government
was forced to curtail the abuse of
"security measures" by its secret
police. The ghastly "knock on the
door" after midnight disappeared
almost entirely. Frosty Siberia
ceased to be a menace. It was
this new political climate creep
ing slowly into Poland which was
called "the Thaw."
Khrushchev's well - publicized
denunciation of Stalin, both pub
lic and seci'et, added new warmth
to the atmosphere. Stalin's au
thority was tossed into the gut
ter and Polish Communist news
papers were unable to hide the
eagerness and satisfaction of the
Poles in outdoing Moscow in this
"new look" line.
Almost simultaneously with
Khrushchev's speeches an official

announcement from Moscow as
cribed the liquidation of the Pol
ish Communist party in 1938 and
the execution of dozens of its
most prominent leaders who
sought refuge in Moscow, to Sta
lin's "blunders" based on lies and
provocation by the NKVD.
These developments in Moscow
were echoed in Warsaw with a
loud demand for the liquidation
of the "big lie." One of its as
pects was the over-propagandized
"fraternal help" by the Soviet
Union to Poland. Overnight the
slogan "Stop the economic exploi
tation of Poland by the Soviet
Union" became a battle cry of the
masses, non-Communist and Com
munist alike. Old grievances re
vived. The release of several hun
dred thousands of Poles still in
Siberia was demanded in press
and parliament.
Economic motives sparked the
tinderbox in Poznan. The police
lost control and army units re
fused to shed blood in defense of
the Moscow - sponsored regime.
The stage for the great change
was set.
Gomulka, who for six years
had been imprisoned and banned
because in 1950 he .had had the
courage to demand the loosening
of the Kremlin's control over Po
land, was released and overnight
became the* people's hero. The
strong young wing in the Party
demanded his reinstatement. This
was an open challenge to Mos
cow.
The Soviet leadership made a
final attempt to support its stal

warts in Warsaw. A plane load
of Soviet dignitaries arrived in
Warsaw, but they were obviously
unable to stem the flood produced
by "the Thaw."
The victims were Rokossovsky,
the Stalin-sponsored marshal of
the Polish army; Radkiewlcz, the
Minister of State Security, a for
mer high official of the NKVD;
Mine, the boss or Poland's Com
munist economy; and finally,
Berman, an obscure vice-premier
who was the only man in Warsaw
who had a phone on which he
could directly dial any office in
the Kremlin.
These men were removed from
key positions from which they
pulled the strings for Moscow's
show in Poland.
The next move is obviously up
to Moscow. What it will be is any
one's guess.
Although the Communists who
have now come to power in Mos
cow insist upon full freedom to
keep their own house in order, all
expectations that Poland might
break with Moscow are pure
wishful thinking. Postwar Poland
is tied to Moscow by the past
blunders of American and British
foreign policy. Roosevelt and
Churchill promised the Poles that
they would be compensated for
the losses in the East with equiv
alent territories in the West, at
the expense of defeated Germany.
But at the same time, at Teheran
and Yalta, they pushed Poland
into the Soviet Russian orbit.
The Poles occupied the German
area and Truman and Attlee
agreed at Potsdam to the removal
of the German population from
the area. This certainly was not
a "temporary" measure. How
ever, Secretary of State James F.
Byrnes, in the opening shots of
the cold war fired in his Stuttgart
speech, questioned the perma
nency of the entire solution.
The American attitude in this
matter remains obscure up to the
present. One cannot expect the
Poles to break with Moscow if
Soviet Russia is the only source
from which they can expect sup
port in this vital matter.
They may hate Communism, it
is true. But they cannot give up
the area where five million Poles
have established a new existence.
And one should not forget that
the entire calamity started with
Hitler and his German support
ers.
