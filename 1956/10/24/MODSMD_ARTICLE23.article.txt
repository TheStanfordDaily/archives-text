# "Chalk Garden' Mediocre, Dull Play
## 
### Richard Lamb 
There are a few nice things
about "The Chalk Garden," cur
rently at the Alcazar in San Fran
cisco, but on the whole it is rw
dioere and unbearably dull. The
plot concerns itself with a garden
where the soil is chalk, and the
efforts of a vivacious grandmoth
er and ex-convict-turned-govern
ess to make it productive are rem
iniscent of Oscar Wilde, but not
nearly so witty.
Symbolism constantly invades
the scene. Gladys Cooper, as the
grandmother, is trying to grow
live things from the dead garden.
Likewise, she is trying to redis
cover her dead youth in a grand
daughter who at 16 is jaded, neu
rotic and has tendencies toward
pyromania.
Judith Anderson, playing the
mysterious governess, alone in
prison for 15 years, has no illu

sions about life. "When will you
learn that you're living on
chalk?" she asks Gladys.
By the end of the play she has
decided that "maybe with a little
moss and some good potash we
can make it grow." The trouble
is that the audience, immersed in
boredom, doesn't really care.
Miss Anderson spends almost
the entire first, act sitting in a
chair staring at the ceiling. Miss
Cooper, 68, is flitting energeti
cally about the stage, delivering
lines like Jane Cowl and flapping
her hand like Zasu Pitts. The
combination is not particularly
amusing. The first act is not at
all interesting.
Hoping for a snappy comeback
in the second act, one is treated
to another stanza of uninterrupt
ed lifelessness. Author Enid Bag
nold has saved all three funny
lines for the third act. All the
inane events of the other two acts
are assimilated into a couple of
appealing moments, but Miss
Bagnold should have begun the
resurrection much sooner.
Miss Anderson, who is replac
ing Siobhan McKenna in the role,
is either out of her element or
feels the same lack of affection
for the play that the audience

does. Most of the time she ap
pears completely disinterested
and nonchalant.
For one of the finest actresses
of our time, it is a performance
low spot. As a stage personality,
however, she is not disappoint
ing; she walks like a yo-yo and
upstages at every opportunity.
Miss Cooper, another grand
dame of the theater, is at home in
her role, though the cupboard is
pretty bare of material.
The most memorable thing
about the play is the set by Cecil
Beaton, who is currently repre
sented on Broadway by "My Fair
Lady."
