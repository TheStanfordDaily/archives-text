Fans watching John Brodie's aerial antics Saturday in the Sta
dium may not know it, but if it hadn't been for a persistent mother
and a broad-minded director of admissions, the ex-Oakland Tech
flash would have gone to Cal.
According' to the San Francisco Chronicle, Brodie bad given up
hope of being admitted to the Farm and was making disappointed
plans to enroll at the second-rate school located at Berkeley. Then,
with three weeks left until Frosh Week, his mother talked Rixford
K. Snyder into admitting Brodie.
This writer can't resist the temptation to second-guess and say
what-a-team-Cal-would-have-been thiS;year with pigskin pitchers Joe
Contestabile, Joe Kapp AND John Brodie.
"Mr. Inside, Mr. Outside"
Second-guessing aside, it will be a blistering battle Saturday be
tween Brodie on one hand and USC's Arnett and Roberts on the
other. Roberts and Arnett are a '56 edition of Army's Doc Blanchard
and Glenn Davis, known a decade ago as "Mr. Inside and Mr. Out
side."
Like Blanchard and Davis, Roberts and Arnett are, as individuals,
containable but as a tandem, incorrigible. If a team spreads its ends
to keep the piston-legged Arnett from "turning the corner," it leaves
the middle wide open for Roberts' rushes.
And bundling the defense for C.K. gives Arnett all the green
ery be needs to prance on. Stanford stopped Arnett last year in
upsetting the Hillmen. But Roberts was out with injuries then
and this year lie's been as healthy as the GOF version of Ike.
No team this autumn has slowed the SC speedsters simultane
ously. Early-season foes Texas and Oregon State gang-tackled Ar
nett and held the senior sprinter to 169 yards in two tilts, low for
)iim.
But Roberts broke loose up the middle for 284 yards and two
Trojan victories. The next weekend Wisconsin's Badgers were wait
ing for C.li. and stopped him coldâ€”2B yards in five totes.
Arnett surprised the Big Ten eleven, though, and reeled off
seven yards every time he was handed the ball. At 25 carries
that was way too much for the Badgers.
Last week Washington hemmed in Roberts as Wisconsin had
done but let Arnett romp for 157 yards in the 35-7 rout.
Saturday's squabble will not resolve the question of whether
Arnett AND Roberts can be halted. That has already been answered.
The clash will only determine which one will run wild this time.
Highly Traumatic
The year 1956 could be a highly traumatic season for Indian grid
der A 1 Napoleon. Going into the San Jose game, the hero of the '53
UCLA game, now back after two Army years, had not seen action
and thus hadn't used up any of his remaining year of eligibility.
In the Spartan clash the Hawaiian speedster jumped off the bench
in the third stanza and went in as a flanker-end. On his first play,
Napoleon was assigned to go out for a pass.
But, nervous in his first grid go in three years, he let a hard
rushing S.IS defender block his path and knock his pins out from
under him.
After this effort, Napoleon was yanked by Coach Taylor. Thus
Napoleon has no more eligibility left, even if he sits on the bench
the rest of the season, as he did in last weekend's Oregon onslaught.
In that contingency, he would be in the unique situation of having
lost one year of eligibility on one not-very-successful play of one not
very-important game.
