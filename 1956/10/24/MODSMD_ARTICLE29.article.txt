# Cards Prepare for USC; Van Galder, Long Ready
## Taylor and Team Hold Long, Spirited Workout; Trojans Respect Brodie, Work on Pass Defense 
### 
Stanford's gridders worked out in one of the longest—and most I
spirited—practices of the year last night as they prepared for this 1
week's crucial tilt against Southern California.
The Indians ran through their only scheduled heavy contact work ;
of the week in a pass-protection drill. Coach Chuck Taylor also super-

saturated his charges with prep
aration for USC plays. Further,
the team workerl against USC.de
fenses.
In the meantime, according to
United Press dispatches, the Tro
jans indicated their fear of John
Brodie's passing ar m by devoting
most of their practice yesterday
to pass-defense.
Halfback Jon Arnett, one of the
nation's best runners, sat out yes*
terday's practice with a hip point
er, but he Is expected to be at full
strength Saturday. Center Carl
Rubke also stayed out of contact
work with a similar injury.
Returnees Gary Van Galder,
end, and Bob Long, center, indi
cated by their work last night
that they will see considerable ac
tion Saturday. Coach Taylor an
nounced, however, that neither
' would start. Tackle Steve Docter
was running well, but he is more
doubtful than the above two.
Fullbacks Lou Valli and Doug
Dick, who sat out Monday's prac
tice, were running at full steam
yesterday.
Don Liebendorfer, athletic news
director, predicted a crowd of 65,-
000 Saturday. The Stanford frosh
will play their first game of the
season against the USC yearlings
in the 11 a.m. preliminary.
