# Frosh Gridders Open Slate Saturday; Will Play Trojan Jrs. in Preliminary
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman footballers
open their 1956 campaign Satur
day against the Southern Califor
nia frosh at Stanford. Game time
is ll a.m., the preliminary to the
big Card-SC tilt.
Tabbed as one of the most pow
erful freshman aggregations in
recent years, the Papooses have
completed nearly a month of prac
tice in preparation for their short,
three-game slate. Yesterday the
first string worked on defensive
maneuvers against a team using
USC plays.
The presence of a runner like
fullback Jim Honeywell, northern
California's high school "player
of the year" last season, indicates

that the Papooses may be the
"running-est" of the three Stan
ford elevens.
But the frosh will pass, too,
having top-flight receivers in ends
Chris Burford and Jerry Winters.
Sid Garber apparently has won
the starting quarterback role and
will be on the throwing end fbr
most of the aerials.
With the squad bolstered by
some of last season's top Califor
nia high school gridders, Coach
Bob Ghilotti has been faced with
some rather pleasant "problems."
Such difficulties arose at center,
where three of the four centers
who played in the Shrine North-
South game came to Stanford.


FROSH FULLBACK —Picked to start at fullback when the Frush
gridders meet USC's freshmen Saturday is Jim Honeywell. Jim
was chosen northern California's "outstanding high school gridder"
last year. He's a graduate of Jefferson High in Daly City.
