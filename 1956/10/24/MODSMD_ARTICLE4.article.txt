# Menlo JC Director Prohibits Circulation of Liquor Petition
## Reason for Denial Is Presence of Youthful Prep School Student Body on JC Campus 
### 
The Menlo Junior College director has refused to allow petitions
seeking the lowering of the age limit for drinking from being circu
lated on that campus.
Director John D. Russell turned down a request by petition circu
lator Lloyd Downton Monday afternoon. He said, "I turned down

his request because I knew the ad
ministration of Menlo College
would not approve of the peti
tions being circulated here."
According to Russell, Menlo is
not only a junior college but a
prep school as well. "We've got
students here who are only 14
years old," he said. "We've got
enough troubles with the state
authorities as it is."
Reports from Menlo indicate
that many of the students, if not
allowed to sign petitions there,
would come over to the Stanford
campus to sign. Downton said
that, after talking to a number of
students there himself, many ex
pressed an- active interest in the
petitions.
ASSU President Bob Freelen
said Monday that he had talked
with Carl Terzian, president of
the Associated Students of Uni
versity of Southern California,
over the week end. According to
Freelen, Terzian expressed an in
terest in the petitions being circu
lated here and requested corre
spondence on the subject.
Earlier Monday afternoon
Freelen met with Downton, Skip
Renner and Daily Editor Helen
Dewar in Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler's office. Free
len said that a general discussion
of the issue was held, without any
real conclusions being drawn.
It was felt, however, that Legis
lature should take up the problem
before attempting to press other
California colleges to take up the
issue.
