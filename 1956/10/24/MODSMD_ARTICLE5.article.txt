the Democratic caucus of the Po
litical Union, Jackson said that
both sides are missing the point
in this argument.
"The real importance is not in
testing the bombs, hut in the mis
siles that will carry them. If the
Russians are the first to test
those, we will have lost our su
premacy in the arms race, and
With it the cold war."
Although H-bomb testing will
have to bo stopped eventually,

entists have said anything for or
against the danger of radiation

ception of Theodore Roosevelt, all
GOP Presidents of this century
have dragged their heels, and the
Democrats have come up with all
the imaginative new ideas.
"FDR instituted necessary re
forms," Jackson said, "and it took
the Republicans 20 years to real
. i/e the program was sound. They
had no comprehension of the
I need for these steps in 1i>32."
