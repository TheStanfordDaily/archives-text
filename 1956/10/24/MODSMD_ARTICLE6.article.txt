# Herberg Discusses How to Preserve Faith on Campus
## 
### 
A great, challenging religious
problem of today, Will Herberg
told a large Tuesday Series lec
ture audience last night, is how
to preserve the deepest stirrings
of faith among the youth on col
lege campuses.
Herberg, speaking on "Religion
and Culture in Present-Day Amer
ica," said that "this concern on
the campus for avoiding institu
tional commitments" disappears
during the settling-down process.
There are two religious reviv
als, Herberg said. "America be
lieves in believing, has faith in
faith. The conviction of most
Americans is that all three faiths,
Protestantism, Catholicism and
Judaism, say the same thing in
different ways—but 'mine says it
best.'"
Herberg explained the cause for
American culture being secularis
tic, yet in the grip of a great re
ligious revival, by events of the
past generation and the change
in the structure of the ethnic im
migrant group.
"America has become a triple
melting pot," he said. Today the
religious community has taken
the place of the ethnic division as
the primary identity of Ameri
cans. Most of them belong to one
of the three great faiths.
"Religion has become a symbol
of belonging," Herberg said.
"Third-generation Americans are
in search of a heritage. They want
a context of belonging. They
want grandfather's religion, defu
mifjated."
