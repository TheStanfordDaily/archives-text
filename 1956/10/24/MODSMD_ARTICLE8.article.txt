# Ike Says Only Russian Pact Will Stop Tests
## Candidates Disagree On Time Necessary To Resume Tests 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 (UP)
—President Eisenhower declared
• bluntly today the United States
will continue testing 11-bombs 'to
prevent war" unless Russia ac
cepts a fool-proof system of in
ternational safeguards.
Striking sharply at Adlai E.
Stevenson's proposal to ban H
bomb tests, the President said to
do so without such safeguards
might wipe out or even reverse
this country's "commanding
lead" in nuclear weapons.
Eisenhower made the state
ments in releasing a special gov
ernment report on nuclear weap
ons and disarmament. He also de
clared that the present rate of H
bomb testing "does not imperil
the health of humanity."
Disclosing that his administra
tion twice has considered and re
jected a moratorium on atomic
tests without safeguarded agree
ments, the President said the
"critical issue is not a matter of
testing nuclear weapons but of
preventing their use in nuclear
war."
Want Peace
He said there is every reason
to believe that if all sides sin
cerely want peace the atomic
powers can agree on a system of
dependable disarmament controls
and declared:
"We shall never cease striving
to this end."
He struck hard at Stevenson's
contention that a simple agree
ment to stop H-bomb testing
would be enough because this
country could detect any Soviet
H-bomb explosion and resume its
own tests in eight weeks.
Eisenhower said preparations
for such renewed tests might
take "up to two years."
In refusing to agree to a ban
on bomb tests without ironclad
assurances Russia would not en
gage in tests, the chief executive
said there was "nothing in post
war history" to justify belief the
country "should or . . . could
even dare" accept less.
Not by Name
The President did not mention
his Democratic rival for the Pres
idency by name. But his state
ment and accompanying memo
randa were his formal reply to
Stevenson's repeated demands
for this country to take the lead
in seeking an agreement to end
the tests.
Eisenhower said Russian sym
pathy for the idea of stopping H
bomb testing "is indisputable."
But he also said the Kremlin
has been making such proposals
for years without any provision
for safeguards, controls or in
spection.
In the absence of such safe
guards, he said, this country can
not and will not suspend its nu
clear research and development.
He said that if the United
States suspended research and
preparation for atomic tests until
there is evidence another nation
had actually exploded an H-bomb,
we could "find our present com
manding lead in nuclear weapons
erased or even reversed."
Stevenson also has said he fa
vored continued testing of small
atomic weapons, arguing that the
radioactive hazards of such weap
ons are not as serious as those
i from H-bombs.

do so without such safeguards
might wipe out or even reverse
this country's "commanding
lead" in nuclear weapons.
Eisenhower made the state
ments in releasing a special gov
ernment report on nuclear weap
ons and disarmament. He also de
clared that the present rate of H
bomb testing "does not imperil
the health of humanity."
Disclosing that his administra
tion twice has considered and re
jected a moratorium on atomic
tests without safeguarded agree
ments, the President said the
"critical issue is not a matter of
testing nuclear weapons but of
preventing their use in nuclear
war."
Want Peace
He said there is every reason
to believe that if all sides sin
cerely want peace the atomic
powers can agree on a system of
dependable disarmament controls
and declared:
"We shall never cease striving
to this end."
He struck hard at Stevenson's
contention that a simple agree
ment to stop H-bomb testing
would be enough because this
country could detect any Soviet
H-bomb explosion and resume its
own tests in eight weeks.
Eisenhower said preparations
for such renewed tests might
take "up to two years."
In refusing to agree to a ban
on bomb tests without ironclad
assurances Russia would not en
gage in tests, the chief executive
said there was "nothing in post
war history" to justify belief the
country "should or . . . could
even dare" accept less.
Not by Name
The President did not mention
his Democratic rival for the Pres
idency by name. But his state
ment and accompanying memo
randa were his formal reply to
Stevenson's repeated demands
for this country to take the lead
in seeking an agreement to end
the tests.
Eisenhower said Russian sym
pathy for the idea of stopping H
bomb testing "is indisputable."
But he also said the Kremlin
has been making such proposals
for years without any provision
for safeguards, controls or in
spection.
In the absence of such safe
guards, he said, this country can
not and will not suspend its nu
clear research and development.
He said that if the United
States suspended research and
preparation for atomic tests until
there is evidence another nation
had actually exploded an H-bomb,
we could "find our present com
manding lead in nuclear weapons
erased or even reversed."
Stevenson also has said he fa
vored continued testing of small
atomic weapons, arguing that the
radioactive hazards of such weap
ons are not as serious as those
i from H-bombs.
