# Adlai Wants Phony Peace Issue Ended
## Demo Candidate Says Agreement on H-Bomb Tests Not Impossible 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 24 (UP)â€”
Adlfti E. Stevenson (.-ailed on
President Eisenhower today to
stop Republican campaigners
from "exploiting the phony peace
issue."
The Democratic Presidential
nominee campaigning in New
York and in suburbs said, "Noth
ing has revolted me more than
this phony peace issue in this
campaign."
Stevenson told 10,000 persons
gathered at an outdoor rally in
the Bronx that the President'him
self has disavowed such tactics.
"If he is a great leader of the
Republican party I would like to
see right now if he can stop Re
publican campaigners from ex
ploiting this issue."
Quick Tour
The candidate made a quick
tour of three luncheons, a group
of labor leaders, 600 businessmen
and finally women members of
the Liberal party before speaking
at the Bronx rally.
Stevenson touched on the H
bomb issue again in the Bronx,
saying that failure to reach
agreement on an end to bomb
tests "does not mean such agree
ments are forever impossible."
"No matter which party wins
in November, another supreme
effort must bo undertaken, and
another and another too."
An egg was thrown at the
speakers' platform at the Bronx
rally just as Mayor Robert F.
Wagner 1 was finshing a cam
paign speech for the Senate. It
flifl not strike Wagner or Steven
son.
Friend of Business
Stevenson charged that small
businesses have failed at a great
er rate under the Eisenhower ad
ministration than at any time in
the last 15 years. The Democratic
Presidential candidate struck out
for the business vote by present
ing his party as the business
men's "best friend," and the GOP
as the friend only of Big Busi
ness.
The Republicans, he said, "re
coil" from the challenge of the
future. The proof lies in their
failure to fill public welfare
needs in the "ways" of natural
resources, and in the "troubled
condition of so many small busi
nesss," he said.
Stevenson is currently making
a five-day swing through the key
states of New York, Illinois and
California. He has labeled the
last two weeks of his campaign
as "critical."
