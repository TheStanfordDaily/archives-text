# Increase in Cars Hinders Progress In Traffic Dilemma
## 
### 
Little improvement has been
made in the overall parking and
traffic situation from last year,
indicated Stanford Police Chief
Gordon Davis yesterday. An in
crease in automobile owners
brought about by an increased
student enrollment has offset ef
forts, such as elimination of on
campus parking by on-campus ve
hicles, to relieve crowded parking
condi tons.
"Between students and fac
ulty," stated Chief Davis, "we
had an increase of 2000 more cars
than we had estimated."
The total automobile registra
tion figures for faculty, staff and I
students as of Oct. 17 was 7314.
Of these, 4911 were registered to
students, 1733 to the University
staff and 830 to the faculty. Of
the student • operated vehicles,
2138 are on campus while 2733
are off campus.
Chief Davis attributed the high
increase in off-campus vehicles to
the increase of about 300 gradu
ate students, the greater portion
of whom own automobiles.
Traffic and parking violations
do not seem to be as numerous as
last year, commented the chief,
but lie added there are "about a
hundred" unpaid tickets. .
Unpaid tickets add an extra
dollar at the end of ten da'ys and
then are forwarded at the end of
the quarter to the Cashier's of
fice. A student's grades are with
held until payment is made.
