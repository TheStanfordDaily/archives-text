### 
The judges of the Sequoia ar
ticle contest announced this week
that "no article submitted met the
minimum standards of the con
test" and "at this time no winner
of the contest exists."
The contest will be extended
until Jan. 21, and the prize has
been raised from $50 to $75, ac
cording to the Sequoia Editorial
Board.
The purpose of the article con
test was "to stimulate the writing
of articles by Stanford students
and to obtain through the contest
one or more articles which would
meet the publishing standards of
the magazine without extensive
revision or re-writing."
The contest has been extended
"in recognition of the response,
the hard work and the obvious
talent shown in some of the man
uscripts." At the close of the
new contest a winner will be
chosen and the prize awarded.
The judges will return the
manuscripts through the Sequoia
,Editorial Board "for revision at
the authors' discretion." Revised
manuscripts and any nrvv entries
will be eligible for Iho new con
test.
Judges Dr. Wilfred 11. Stone of
the English Department, Jess
Bell of the Stanford University
Press and Sequoia Editor Don
Shoup said that "a number of the
manuscripts showed haste, owing
possibly to the summer vacation
and the rush of trying to meet
the early deadline of the contest."
Through (he extension in the
deadline for the contest, the Se
quoia Editorial Board and the
judges hope that the need for
haste in preparing manuscripts
will be eliminated.
