# Do We Have Peace?

It is not a grf.at tribute to American political
awareness that the current campaigns should
ho centered on I lie relative levels of hog prices
in Kansas and the question of which Adminis
tration has offered which economic group the
most.
This over-concentration on lessor issues that
directly and immediately affect the material
welfare of the voter and tug hardest on his
purse strings has pushed into the background
the crucial issue of the last several yearsâ€”the
decline of American strength, prestige and in
fluence among the nations of the world.
Pi esident Eisenhower has done little more
than to eulogize over "peace in our time," while
his opponent Adlai Stevenson has assailed the
Administration repeatedly for its gyrating poli
cies, lack of imagination and reluctance to
assume initiative. Nevertheless, except for the
H-bomb issue, which has an intrinsic effect on
every life-loving individual, these will not be
the speeches that will win him votes, for the
issue of far-reaching foreign policy failures
carries little impact with the complacent voter.
1 lie fact is that the United States is clinging
by thin threads to its position as leader in the
Free \\ orld. and the distressing if not horrify
ing fact is that the present Administration,
under Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dul
les, cither ignores this gradual demise or tries
to bury it beneath optimistic claims that "any
way, there is 110 war."'
Certainly there is no war, but then again
thee is 110 peace. This country relegated to
1 ranee and Great Britain the initiative in the
Suez crisis and then sapped all strength from
proposals they made. Through bold economic
maneuvers and constant propaganda thrusts,
the Soviet Union has become the champion of
the Arab underdog.
Although primarily responsible for her own

success, Russia has received indirect assistance
from vacillating American policy, weak and
antagonistic diplomatic agents and the gradual
breakdown of Western unity.
Western Europe once looked to the United
States for leadership, but now, after the Suez
fiasco and the failure of this country to pump
new vigor into the Western alliance, she has
been foreed to rely almost solely on herself,
knowing that American assistance comes spas
modically and often chaotically. This may be
one way to fortify Western Europe and
strengthen her own resources, but it's a fairly
suicidal method.
The President's efforts at the Geneva summit
conference and his Atoms for Peace Program
were steps in the right direction, but unfortu
nately they have been undermined by the day
to-day execution of American foreign policy.
The verbal now-we-do, now-we-don't approach
to the "morality " of neutral nations lias im
pressed 110 one, least of all the neutral nations
themselves, with the supposed consistency and
intelligence of our policy.
It is interesting to note that the one prom
ising indication arising from our present
chaotic state of world affairs arises not from
an area where the United States had concen
trated its diplomatic efforts, but from countries
within the Iron Curtain; it has been the nega
tive result of Communist failures, not positive
results of American diplomacy.
1 he tragedy is that, however well-meaning
our present leadership has been, it has not of
fered the dynamic, farsighted direction requi
site to a nation which had committed itself to
world leadership.
It is a distortion of the meaning of the word
peace to define it as the simple absence of
war. For the claim of peace in our lime, as we
have seen before, is valid only so long as it lays
the basis for a lasting state of peace.
