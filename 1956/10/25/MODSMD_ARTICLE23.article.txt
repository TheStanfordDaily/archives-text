•"Militarism* on Campus
Editor, The Daily:
It appears that various aspects of our univer
sity life, alcohol drinking, grades, etc., are being
appraised and reappraised by The Daily and the
student body.
I propose that the time, effort and newsprint
could be put to better use if we had an appraisal
of another segment of our University, namely,
the military program in the form of ROTC.
No doubt the military has its foot well placed
in the door of the University; the passive accept
ance of militarism on a university campus is
frightening to anyone acquainted with the dis
couragement of free inquiry, obvious conformity
mental and physical—and the subjugation of
free 1 bought that is espoused by the military
program.
The primary function of a university is to
enhance and promulgate free thought, discussion,
argument and free expression. In what way does
the military contribute to this function? In no
way whatsoever. In fact, these characteristics
have no place in a military setup at all.
Can it be denied that the conformity in thought
that is a product of the military program does not
allect the student in his critical studies of history,
economics, etc.? Where does such a military pro
gram stop?
May it be noted just how far it has reached into
oiij' lives already. Students enrolling in the mili
tary program are deferred and may continue
their education in college. To get into the ROTC
one must sign a loyalty oath; in other words, if
an individual wishes to continue his schooling
with the assurance that he will not be bothered

by his dralt board for a while, he must sign a
loyalty oath.
Twenty years ago, if one had to sign a loyalty
oath to go to college, it would have been railed
fascistic. Today it is an accepted part of the Uni
versity. This calls for a reappraisal. The mili
tary has its place, but it is not on the American
university campus.

Action Sought 011 Liquor
Editor, The Daily:
I think most of us agree ihal letters in this
column stimulate student interest on problems
which arise from time to time. Frequently,
though, there is no action taken on these prob
lems beyond the writing of letters and the subse
quent criticisms which appear here.
And so we have the liquor problem. Downton
has made his proposal, and his critics have an
swered him.
... If we're going to have an arbitrary age
limit (it's presently inconceivable that the limit
could be abolished completely), j| might as well
be js rather than 21. It is not a perfect solution,
by any means, but it seems that an 18-year-old
limit would lit into the social structure of today
better than does the existing age limit.
My main point is that if anything is going to
he done about this problem, some unity is going
to be needed. And what more appropriate place
than college for some action on this issue" The
lirst step has been taken. Perhaps now. if some
other students pursue their interest with action
and it the ASSU quits evading the issue some
thing will come of it.

free 1 bought that is espoused by the military
program.
The primary function of a university is to
enhance and promulgate free thought, discussion,
argument and free expression. In what way does
the military contribute to this function? In no
way whatsoever. In fact, these characteristics
have no place in a military setup at all.
Can it be denied that the conformity in thought
that is a product of the military program does not
allect the student in his critical studies of history,
economics, etc.? Where does such a military pro
gram stop?
May it be noted just how far it has reached into
oiij' lives already. Students enrolling in the mili
tary program are deferred and may continue
their education in college. To get into the ROTC
one must sign a loyalty oath; in other words, if
an individual wishes to continue his schooling
with the assurance that he will not be bothered

by his dralt board for a while, he must sign a
loyalty oath.
Twenty years ago, if one had to sign a loyalty
oath to go to college, it would have been railed
fascistic. Today it is an accepted part of the Uni
versity. This calls for a reappraisal. The mili
tary has its place, but it is not on the American
university campus.

Action Sought 011 Liquor
Editor, The Daily:
I think most of us agree ihal letters in this
column stimulate student interest on problems
which arise from time to time. Frequently,
though, there is no action taken on these prob
lems beyond the writing of letters and the subse
quent criticisms which appear here.
And so we have the liquor problem. Downton
has made his proposal, and his critics have an
swered him.
... If we're going to have an arbitrary age
limit (it's presently inconceivable that the limit
could be abolished completely), j| might as well
be js rather than 21. It is not a perfect solution,
by any means, but it seems that an 18-year-old
limit would lit into the social structure of today
better than does the existing age limit.
My main point is that if anything is going to
he done about this problem, some unity is going
to be needed. And what more appropriate place
than college for some action on this issue" The
lirst step has been taken. Perhaps now. if some
other students pursue their interest with action
and it the ASSU quits evading the issue some
thing will come of it.

•"Militarism* on Campus
Editor, The Daily:
It appears that various aspects of our univer
sity life, alcohol drinking, grades, etc., are being
appraised and reappraised by The Daily and the
student body.
I propose that the time, effort and newsprint
could be put to better use if we had an appraisal
of another segment of our University, namely,
the military program in the form of ROTC.
No doubt the military has its foot well placed
in the door of the University; the passive accept
ance of militarism on a university campus is
frightening to anyone acquainted with the dis
couragement of free inquiry, obvious conformity
mental and physical—and the subjugation of
free 1 bought that is espoused by the military
program.
