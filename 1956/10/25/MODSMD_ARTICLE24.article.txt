# FOREIGN STUDENT LOOKS AT POLITICS
## Wolfgang Schulz Says Stanford Students Are 'Spoonfed,' Not Encouraged to Think 
### Sally Trapnell 
Most Stanford classes "spoon
feed" their students, rather than
encouraging them to think for
themselves, believes Wolfgang
Schulz, ASSU Foreign Scholar
from the free University of Ber
lin.
Schulz says he doesn't think
this is true of all classes, espe
cially not at thp graduate level,
but that day-to-day reading as
signments from one book don't
encourage individual research.
He prefers the method used in
German universities where stu
dents are given a choice of read
ing from which to get their mate
rial for a course.
"More Academic"
Giving other differences be
tween American and German
schools, Schulz said that in Eu
rope the universities are much
more strictly academic. They
have nothing to do with the sill
dents' social life.
"There are no resident univer
sities over there," he added, "and
no contact between the student
and faculty* such as the Deans of
Men and Women or the resident
assistants."
Schulz studied law at the Uni
versity of Berlin, and is taking
courses in political science at
Stanford. This quarter he is liv
ing in Toyon as a member of El
Tigre eating club.
Likes Club
Schulz considers himself very
fortunate to have joined an eat
ing club and says that he has
found many people there with
whom he can discuss Germany
and his impressions of the United
States.
Having arrived in this country
on Sept. 14 and coming straight
to Stanford from New York,
Schulz confesses he has had little
opportunity to see America as
yet.
He had his first taste of U.S.
politics last week when he went
to the Stevenson rally in Oak
land.
"I was quite disappointed in

Stevenson's speech," he said. "I
had thought it would be more of
the 'egghead" type, but it was
definitely for public consump
tion."
Schulz said he didn't mind the
fact that Stevenson was late, but
he was surprised at the num
ber of men who were introduced
and made speeches before the
Democratic Presidential candi
date.
"In Germany," he said, "when
Adenauer appears at a rally, even
for a local election, he is the cen
ter of the stage and very few
other politicians are even intro
duced."
Language Barrier
Asked if he considers American
colleges easier than European
ones, Schulz laughed and said he
couldn't tell because he still has
a language difficulty with Eng
lish. He doesn't find assignments
more simple, but says this may
be because he has to read every
word to find out the important
ones. *
Schulz had previous knowledge
of English, as every Foreign
Scholar is required to. He has
studied it for seven years, start

ing at the age of 12. He said he
had little difficulty with it be
cause he had made two trips to |
England, and also having the
Occupation forces around made
English a common language in
Berlin.
Schulz commented on his coun
try's political situation by saying i
that most Germans still hope for
integration with East Germany, j
although they see little hope fori
it while the United States and!
Russia are so unfriendly.
Two Methods .
He says there are two views «as
to how it could be accomplished.
Adenauer's government believes
the only way is to join a Western
European union to show the Rus
sians that they could never take I
over the whole country. So far,
this method has failed.
The Social Democrats believe
Germany should get out of NATO I
and gamble on getting the East
ern section to agree to reunion as !
a neutral state, atcing as a buffer j
between the West and Russia.
Schulz says, however, that the I
people of West Germany are as
firmly against the Russians as is '
the United States, since they have >
seen Communism in action in
East Germany.
Non-Committal
Schulz smiled again when
asked if he considers Stanford to
have an intellectual atmosphere.
But he says that he has met many \
individual students who are inter
ested in other parts of the world,
and many especially who know a '
lot about music.
He is especially impressed by j
the number of students in Toyon
who listen to Bach and other clas
sic composers, and by t he-number
of hi-fi sets.
Iri Germany, he says, the peo
ple are mainly dependent on con
certs, since records are prohibi-1
lively expensive. Actually, they I
are only about the same price as i
those made in America, but the
German hourly wage is so much |
lower that few can afford them.

firmly against the Russians as is '
the United States, since they have >
seen Communism in action in
East Germany.
Non-Committal
Schulz smiled again when
asked if he considers Stanford to
have an intellectual atmosphere.
But he says that he has met many \
individual students who are inter
ested in other parts of the world,
and many especially who know a '
lot about music.

the number of students in Toyon

of hi-fi sets.
Iri Germany, he says, the peo

lower that few can afford them.


WOLFGANG SCHULZ
German Foreign Scholar
Most Stanford classes "spoon
feed" their students, rather than
encouraging them to think for
themselves, believes Wolfgang
Schulz, ASSU Foreign Scholar
from the free University of Ber
lin.
Schulz says he doesn't think
this is true of all classes, espe
cially not at thp graduate level,
but that day-to-day reading as
signments from one book don't
encourage individual research.
He prefers the method used in
German universities where stu
dents are given a choice of read
ing from which to get their mate
rial for a course.
"More Academic"
Giving other differences be
tween American and German
schools, Schulz said that in Eu
rope the universities are much
more strictly academic. They
have nothing to do with the sill
dents' social life.
"There are no resident univer
sities over there," he added, "and
no contact between the student
and faculty* such as the Deans of
Men and Women or the resident
assistants."
Schulz studied law at the Uni
versity of Berlin, and is taking
courses in political science at
Stanford. This quarter he is liv
ing in Toyon as a member of El
Tigre eating club.
Likes Club
Schulz considers himself very
fortunate to have joined an eat
ing club and says that he has
found many people there with
whom he can discuss Germany
and his impressions of the United
States.
Having arrived in this country
on Sept. 14 and coming straight
to Stanford from New York,
Schulz confesses he has had little
opportunity to see America as
yet.
He had his first taste of U.S.
politics last week when he went
to the Stevenson rally in Oak
land.
"I was quite disappointed in

Stevenson's speech," he said. "I
had thought it would be more of
the 'egghead" type, but it was
definitely for public consump
tion."
Schulz said he didn't mind the
fact that Stevenson was late, but
he was surprised at the num
ber of men who were introduced
and made speeches before the
Democratic Presidential candi
date.
"In Germany," he said, "when
Adenauer appears at a rally, even
for a local election, he is the cen
ter of the stage and very few
other politicians are even intro
duced."
Language Barrier
Asked if he considers American
colleges easier than European
ones, Schulz laughed and said he
couldn't tell because he still has
a language difficulty with Eng
lish. He doesn't find assignments
more simple, but says this may
be because he has to read every
word to find out the important
ones. *
Schulz had previous knowledge
of English, as every Foreign
Scholar is required to. He has
studied it for seven years, start

ing at the age of 12. He said he
had little difficulty with it be
cause he had made two trips to |
England, and also having the
Occupation forces around made
English a common language in
Berlin.
Schulz commented on his coun
try's political situation by saying i
that most Germans still hope for
integration with East Germany, j
although they see little hope fori
it while the United States and!
Russia are so unfriendly.
Two Methods .
He says there are two views «as
to how it could be accomplished.
Adenauer's government believes
the only way is to join a Western
European union to show the Rus
sians that they could never take I
over the whole country. So far,
this method has failed.

more simple, but says this may
be because he has to read every
word to find out the important
ones. *
Schulz had previous knowledge
of English, as every Foreign
Scholar is required to. He has
studied it for seven years, start

ing at the age of 12. He said he
had little difficulty with it be
cause he had made two trips to |
England, and also having the
Occupation forces around made
English a common language in
Berlin.
Schulz commented on his coun
try's political situation by saying i
that most Germans still hope for
integration with East Germany, j
although they see little hope fori
it while the United States and!
Russia are so unfriendly.
Two Methods .
He says there are two views «as
to how it could be accomplished.
Adenauer's government believes
the only way is to join a Western
European union to show the Rus
sians that they could never take I
over the whole country. So far,
this method has failed.
The Social Democrats believe
Germany should get out of NATO I
and gamble on getting the East
ern section to agree to reunion as !
a neutral state, atcing as a buffer j
between the West and Russia.
Schulz says, however, that the I
people of West Germany are as
firmly against the Russians as is '
the United States, since they have >
seen Communism in action in
East Germany.
Non-Committal
Schulz smiled again when
asked if he considers Stanford to
have an intellectual atmosphere.
But he says that he has met many \
individual students who are inter
ested in other parts of the world,
and many especially who know a '
lot about music.
He is especially impressed by j
the number of students in Toyon
who listen to Bach and other clas
sic composers, and by t he-number
of hi-fi sets.
Iri Germany, he says, the peo
ple are mainly dependent on con
certs, since records are prohibi-1
lively expensive. Actually, they I
are only about the same price as i
those made in America, but the
German hourly wage is so much |
lower that few can afford them.


WOLFGANG SCHULZ
German Foreign Scholar
Most Stanford classes "spoon
feed" their students, rather than
encouraging them to think for
themselves, believes Wolfgang
Schulz, ASSU Foreign Scholar
from the free University of Ber
lin.
Schulz says he doesn't think
this is true of all classes, espe
cially not at thp graduate level,
but that day-to-day reading as
signments from one book don't
encourage individual research.
He prefers the method used in
German universities where stu
dents are given a choice of read
ing from which to get their mate
rial for a course.
"More Academic"
Giving other differences be
tween American and German
schools, Schulz said that in Eu
rope the universities are much
more strictly academic. They
have nothing to do with the sill
dents' social life.
"There are no resident univer
sities over there," he added, "and
no contact between the student
and faculty* such as the Deans of
Men and Women or the resident
assistants."
Schulz studied law at the Uni
versity of Berlin, and is taking
courses in political science at
Stanford. This quarter he is liv
ing in Toyon as a member of El
Tigre eating club.
Likes Club
Schulz considers himself very
fortunate to have joined an eat
ing club and says that he has
found many people there with
whom he can discuss Germany
and his impressions of the United
States.
Having arrived in this country
on Sept. 14 and coming straight
to Stanford from New York,
Schulz confesses he has had little
opportunity to see America as
yet.
He had his first taste of U.S.
politics last week when he went
to the Stevenson rally in Oak
land.
"I was quite disappointed in

Stevenson's speech," he said. "I
had thought it would be more of
the 'egghead" type, but it was
definitely for public consump
tion."
Schulz said he didn't mind the
fact that Stevenson was late, but
he was surprised at the num
ber of men who were introduced
and made speeches before the
Democratic Presidential candi
date.
"In Germany," he said, "when
Adenauer appears at a rally, even
for a local election, he is the cen
ter of the stage and very few
other politicians are even intro
duced."
Language Barrier
Asked if he considers American
colleges easier than European
ones, Schulz laughed and said he
couldn't tell because he still has
a language difficulty with Eng
lish. He doesn't find assignments
more simple, but says this may
be because he has to read every
word to find out the important
ones. *
