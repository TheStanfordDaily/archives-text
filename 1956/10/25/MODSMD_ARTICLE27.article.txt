Joel Freis, Card end slated to
] return to action this week, is be
i ing touted by coaches and scouts
alike as one of Stanford's most
promising wingmen.
Freis sat out the San Jose State
and Oregon tilts with a torn thigh
muscle, after turning in one of
I the season's most spectacular per
formances against C) li i o State.
Looking toward the games ahead,
Joel sizes up prospects in three
words: "We'll make it."
Starring on the powerful 1954
freshman team, Freis sat out last
season with a torn rib cartilage,
1 making him a sophomore in eligi
| hility. His thigh injury this sea
son was sustained in practice
prior 1o the San Jose game.
Small as college ends go (6 ft.,

1177 lbs.), Freis nevertheless stood
| out both on offense and defense
in the Indians' first three games.
:He caught seven passes, four
against OSU, and generally made
his end a tough one to turn when
the other team had the ball. Rated
as Stanford's fastest wingman, he
shares the right-end spot with vet-
I eran Carl Isaacs.
Joel is a native of Los Angeles,
j where he has lived all of his life.
IHe attended Los Angeles High
I School and was student body pres
ident and ran track in addition to
starring on the gridiron.
Looking at the future, Freis
sees good years ahead for Stan
ford: "Jack Douglas is a fine
passer and should really come
into his own next year. Bob Nico
let of the jayvees is good, too, and
our frosh team looks great." As
for this year, Joel shares the opin
ion of most Card followers: "No
body is going to stop Brodie."
