# Coaches Taylor and Hill Prep Squads for Battle
## Card Mentor Indicates 'Certain Weaknesses' In the '56 Southern California Grid Machine 
### 
Coaches Chuck Taylor and Jess Hill are not hedging. Taylor has
made it clear that Stanford is going to pass, and Hill has stated
flatly that Southern California is going to run.
Tayloi said that the Trojans have the'best runners on the Coast,
but that they are not an all-around strong team. He indicated that

USC had "certain weaknesses." I
Although the 1952 "Coach of the
Year" didn't spell out the weak-J
nesses, observe r s commented 1
that it was USC's pass defense
that was one of those weak-i
nesses."
Cards Xtr«*ss Pass Pr'itection
Practice this last week has in
dicated that Stanford will prod
that weakness to the fullest. A '
particular amount of protection
has been placed on pass protec
tion. Scout reports show that All-
American quarterback John Bro
die will need air-tight protection
this week in order to bo effective!
against the Trojans.
On the other hand, reports
from the Southland show that
Hill has devoted a considerable
amount of his practice to pass de-!
fense.
Just as Taylor has made it
clear he will pass, pass and pass
this Saturday, Hill has made no
bones about his depending on the
running game.
Hill, coaching his last year at i
Southern Cal, said, "Against
Stanford, we must control the i
ball. We just can't take chances I
of giving them the ball by wild
passing."
USC End Coach B'dl Fisk said,
"We must score four touchdowns
to beat Stanford."
USC High Regard for Brodie
Fisk, who scouted Stanford in j
two games, and .saw movies of
two others, expressed a healthy I
regard for Brodie. He said, "John i
Brodie "is the finest collegiate'
passer I have ever seen. I think j
he is better than Bob Garrett."
USC's running will come from
a pair of backs who are consid- i
ered to be the best one-two punch
in the nation, halfback Jon Ar-,
nett and fullback C. R. Roberts.
The latter has averaged 10.3
yards a carry. Against Texas, he
romped for 251 yards—a USC rec
ord.
The Stanford tilt will be Ar- j
nett's last game, for he is one of 1
the "five-game seniors" who were
penalized for accepting subsidiza
tion. Also bowing out will be
quarterback Frank Hall, end j
Chuck Leimbach and tackles Fa- 1
bian Abram and George Belotti. I

USC End Coach B'dl Fisk said,
"We must score four touchdowns
to beat Stanford."
USC High Regard for Brodie
Fisk, who scouted Stanford in j
two games, and .saw movies of
two others, expressed a healthy I
regard for Brodie. He said, "John i
Brodie "is the finest collegiate'
passer I have ever seen. I think j
he is better than Bob Garrett."
USC's running will come from
a pair of backs who are consid- i
ered to be the best one-two punch
in the nation, halfback Jon Ar-,
nett and fullback C. R. Roberts.
The latter has averaged 10.3
yards a carry. Against Texas, he
romped for 251 yards—a USC rec
ord.
The Stanford tilt will be Ar- j
nett's last game, for he is one of 1
the "five-game seniors" who were
penalized for accepting subsidiza
tion. Also bowing out will be
quarterback Frank Hall, end j
Chuck Leimbach and tackles Fa- 1
bian Abram and George Belotti. I
Coaches Chuck Taylor and Jess Hill are not hedging. Taylor has
made it clear that Stanford is going to pass, and Hill has stated
flatly that Southern California is going to run.
Tayloi said that the Trojans have the'best runners on the Coast,
but that they are not an all-around strong team. He indicated that

USC had "certain weaknesses." I
Although the 1952 "Coach of the
Year" didn't spell out the weak-J
nesses, observe r s commented 1
that it was USC's pass defense
that was one of those weak-i
nesses."
Cards Xtr«*ss Pass Pr'itection
Practice this last week has in
dicated that Stanford will prod
that weakness to the fullest. A '
particular amount of protection
has been placed on pass protec
tion. Scout reports show that All-
American quarterback John Bro
die will need air-tight protection
this week in order to bo effective!
against the Trojans.
On the other hand, reports
from the Southland show that
Hill has devoted a considerable
amount of his practice to pass de-!
fense.
Just as Taylor has made it
clear he will pass, pass and pass
this Saturday, Hill has made no
bones about his depending on the
running game.
Hill, coaching his last year at i
Southern Cal, said, "Against
Stanford, we must control the i
ball. We just can't take chances I
of giving them the ball by wild
passing."
