Some Soviet tanks and Hun

going over to the rebel side.
There were reports that such
tanks were manned by both Hun

country's problems.
The first report of a rebel gov

pledges of forgiveness and a
promise to negotiate withdrawal
of Russian troops.
Premier Imre Nagy, appealing
again for peace, admitted some
Hungarian troops were fighting
alongside rebels. One returning
Westerner said no Hungarian
troops were fighting with the
Russians.
Despite the government's
promises and the purge of Stalin
