## 
### 
"The Republican party is an
unchanging party in a changing
world," charged William H.
Vatchor, candidate from the 10th
Congressional District in an ad
dress before the Political Union
in Cubberley Auditorium last
before a house of only 15 people.
In the history of the Republi
can party only seven bills have
been introduced by Republican
administrations which have con
tributd to the progress of the
United States* Vatcher said. Two
of these were introduced by Ted
dy Roosevelt; "following him the
Republican party has never re
turned to progress."
Republicans, he said, are sim
ply administering the Democratic
programs "which they now ac
cept after 20 years."
"Beginning with a short histori
cal breakdown of American poli
lics in the twentieth century,
Vatcher accused Republican ad
ministrations of reactionary poli
cies interrupted only by eight
years of enlightened leadership
under Woodrow Wilson and 20
years of social progress under
Roosevelt and Truman.
He cited numerous social proj
ects introduced by Roosevelt such
as TV A. the Wagner Act and
minimum wage laws, which, he
said, the Republicans refer to as
socialism. "Somehow," he said
of the Republicans, "they cannot
distinguish between socialism
and social progress."
From there Vatcher went into
a tirade against the record of his
political opponent, Rpublican in"
cumbent Charles C. Gubser, who
he charged is "an old guard Re
publican masqurading as not
only a Republican but a Demo
crat and even as an independent
as well."
