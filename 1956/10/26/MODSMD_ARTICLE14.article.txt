# Cabinet Proposes LASSU Committee On Liquor Problem
## 
### 
In hasty action taken at tho
conclusion of its meeting last
night, Cabinet recommended that
Legislature establish a committee
to study the possibilities of draw
ing up a petition recommending
a change in the present liquor
statute.
At the same time, Cabinet sug
gested that Legislature refuse to
accept as the official ASSU peti
tion the one now circulating under
the tutelage of Lloyd Downton.
If approved by Legislature, this
would not negate the idea behind
the present petition, but put it to
further study under a legislative
committee.
In other action taken last night,
Cabinet recommended that a com
plete activity handbook be drawn
up to supply students with dala
on the "purposes, methods of op
eration, requirements and any
thing else deemed pertinent by
each organization." The philo ->
phy behind this handbook is tit i
there is a need for some complete
compilation of information to aid
students seeking to enter an ac
tivity.
