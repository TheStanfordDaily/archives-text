# Tempers and Tomorrow's Game
## 
### 
Smoldering with resentment against Stanford
for standing for rigid enforcement of Pacific
Coast Conference rules and coming out with
nary a punishment of'its own, the campuses of
USC and IJCLA tend to look at their football
tangles with Stanford this year as their "big
games." They will give their all to winâ€”about
this there is little doubt.
Tempers are taut. The slightest provocation,
intentional or unintentional, could light the
t*patk that would touch oil' a general free-for-all
at both the USC game here this week end and
the UCLA game next week end.
Judging from the reaction of USC. student
and administration leaders who visited here
last week end, it would seem that there will be
an honest effort to keep Southland emotions
under control. Now much will depend on us.
Tomorrow you may hear cries of "Where's
your halo?" and "Here come the purity hoys!"

The natural reaction to such taunts may he to
jump it|> with guns blazing, throw back acid
commenu, slug the nearest USC student and
run off to steal a memento from the rooting
section across the field; but such action, espe
cially at this game, would hardly testify to the
maturity of StanlWrd students.
A more than ordinary responsibility rests on
our shoulders to show onlookers, and ourselves,
that we can place ourselves above reacting
blindly, irrationally and childishly to taunts
from the opposition.
There's nothing wrong with healthy compe
tition, and, so far as this game is concerned,
the stands should abound with it. But unless
an effort is made by Stanford to keep emotions
within decent and reasonable bounds, a good
hard-fought football game may be marred by
a few individuals who seek to make notoriety
for themselves and their cause without due
regard to common sense.
