# Atoms for Peace
## 
### 
Amidst the squabbling of candidates Eisen
hower and Stevenson over the use of hydrogen
bomb tests, it is refreshing for the country and
the world to observe a step taken at the United
Nations headquarters in New York this week.
Eighty-two nations adopted a proposed in
ternational atomic agency. This agency, with
headquarters located in Vienna, would look
toward the international use of atomic and
hydrogen power for peaceful purposes.
The agency will enter into force when 18
nations, including three of the major powers,
ratify the agreement. The statute, which is
open for signing today, is expected to be rati
fied without much difficulty.
he passing of the plan culminates two and
a half years of lengthy debate begun when
President Eisenhower proposed the plan in his
"atoms for peace" speech in December of 1953.
At that time it was evident that atomic and
hydrogen power was thought of only in terms
of complete or near-complete destruction of
our enemies and ultimately ourselves.
When the world first heard of the explosion
of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima on August
6, 1945, there were mixed reactions.
There was the realization of the horrible
destructive power of the weapon â€”an explosion
that could wipe out any major city in the world
in a matter of seconds. There was also opened
for the world, already mnning short of natural
sources, a new source of badly needed power to
run vitally needed industries and to supply

cheap power to the homes of all people.
But this potential did not seem to be realized.
With the tension developing between the East
and the West, increasing atomic stockpiles be
came the chief theme, and the reasons why
scientists for centuries had dreamed of the
power of the atom became forgotten.
Then President Eisenhower proposed his In
ternational Atomic Energy Commission, which
would receive contributions from the atomic
stockpiles of the different nations.
This fissionable material would be used to
serve the peaceful pursuits of the world, to
apply the energy to agriculture and medicine
and to supply electrical energy in the power
starved areas of the world.
For two and a half years the plan was de
bated and thrown back and forth between the
members of the Llnited Nations. Finally the
agency has been tentatively approved.
With the danger of continued fallout tests,
already aptly pointed out by Adlai Stevenson,
something must be done to channel the use of
atomic energy in the right direction.
The Atoms for Peace organization, it must
be remembered, will only be as effective as the
member nations make it. It is purely voluntary,
and if the large Eastern and Western powers
refuse to take it seriously, the commission will
be so much on paper and no more.
For the hope of the future peace of the world
and the betterment of mankind, we hope it
becomes a vital international force.
