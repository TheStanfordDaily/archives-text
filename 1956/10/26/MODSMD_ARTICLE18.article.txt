ROTC Not 'Stifling'
Editor, The Daily:
In Wednesday's issue you published a letter
written by Haig Bosmajian in which he denounced
the position of the ROTC program in American
universities.
Bosmajian apparently thinks that the ROTC
program, because it is military, stifles intellectual
curiosity and the ability to think critically. lie
implies that an ROTC student, by conforming to
1 he military requirements, loses his individuality.
The conformity to which Mr. Bosmajian refers
consists of the wearing of uniforms, drill and use
of military procedure (i.e., saluting, addressing
seniors, etc.). Cooperation is necessary in almost
anything we do; the more a group cooperates
within itself, the more successfully it can operate
as a group. This can be seen in any sport and in
all human endeavor that involves more than one
person. The conformity required in the ROTC
merely enables its members to cooperate and
work together more efficiently.
Another implication in Wednesday's letter was
lhat ROTC renders the student incapable of
thinking for himself. On the contrary, one of
the purposes of the ROTC program is to teach
the student how to think for himself, in order
that he might make a good leader. The con
formity mentioned already does not impair ability
to think clearly.
It is true that the University should cause the
student to question everything he believes in, so
that he may test the validity of his own concepts
and choose or reaffirm his political, economic
and moral standards for himself. It is also true
that a military leader must have loyalty toward
his organization and his country if he is to lead
others to perform their tasks.
Those of us in ROTC, along with most Ameri
cans, are firm in our belief that our country has
the most satisfactory political system and that it
is worth defending.
Perhaps there is justification in criticizing loy
alty oaths. It would be more appropriate, how
ever, to complain about the circumstances that
have made such oaths necessary.

Editor, The Daily:
Digging through the specious logic and half
truths in the letter to the editor on "militarism,"
it is found that the author of said letter criticizes
ROTC on two points: conformity and the defer
ment.
Now, a certain amount of conformity is neces
sary in any military organization in order that
discipline may be maintained; an army without
discipline is a mob. It cannot be argued that
ROTC is not a vital part of our armed forces;

were it not for the pool of trained officers avail
able at the outset of WW 11, mobilization of the
United States military machine would have been
greatly delayed, with dire effects for the Allied
cause.
Thus, discipline, and consequently a certain
amount of conformity, is necessary to the ROTC.
But, to say that this would in any way "affect"
the student in other classes is to state a conclu
sion which does not follow logically from the
facts. Can it be proven that ROTC students'
grades are lower than non-ROTC members? If
so, and it is unlikely, can this be attributed to
military training?
In his comments on the deferment, the author
of the letter in question neglected these facts:
• ROTC members are not automatically given
a deferment until they enter the third year <ff
their college ROTC training.
• Any student, ROTC member or not, can cur
rently be deferred all the way through college
without signing any loyalty oath. He need only
apply to his draft board for the I-S, 11-S, etc.,
series of student deferments, which are granted
solely on the basis of grades and have nothing
whatever to do with a loyalty oath.
Stanford's policy on ROTC warrants not "re
appraisal" but praise. The University recognizes
the need for a well-trained pool of officers, and
further recognizes that the ROTC programs can
fill this need by supplying to the armed forces
college-educated "officers and gentlemen," thus
infusing into the military the very source of that
"free thought" which is the primary "product"
of this or any other university.

Disappointment in Humor
Editor, The Daily:
Once again "The Old Boy" has hit the stands,
and, on noting the 16% per cent increase in price,
we figured on a bigger, better and wittier issue
than ever before. What a disappointment!
Now, we usually aren't ones to throw statistics
around, but in this case we feel that they're war
ranted. This month's Chappie contains 17 "jokes"
that were used in last year's issues. Furthermore,
four jokes in this issue were repeated at least
twice and, in one case, three times. The poetry
section boasts only two repeats from last year.
The remainder of the "jokes," with three possible
exceptions in the cartoon section, either date with
antiquity or aren't worth reading.
As to what to do about-the deplorable state of
our humor magazine, we can't say, but will offer
the Hammer and Coffin boys the following sug
gestion: Be less free with your criticism of The
Daily and concentrate a little more on improving
your own magazine.

It is true that the University should cause the

that he may test the validity of his own concepts

that a military leader must have loyalty toward
his organization and his country if he is to lead

Digging through the specious logic and half
truths in the letter to the editor on "militarism,"
it is found that the author of said letter criticizes
ROTC on two points: conformity and the defer
ment.
Now, a certain amount of conformity is neces
sary in any military organization in order that
discipline may be maintained; an army without
discipline is a mob. It cannot be argued that
ROTC is not a vital part of our armed forces;

were it not for the pool of trained officers avail
able at the outset of WW 11, mobilization of the
United States military machine would have been
greatly delayed, with dire effects for the Allied
cause.
Thus, discipline, and consequently a certain
amount of conformity, is necessary to the ROTC.
But, to say that this would in any way "affect"
the student in other classes is to state a conclu
sion which does not follow logically from the
facts. Can it be proven that ROTC students'
grades are lower than non-ROTC members? If
so, and it is unlikely, can this be attributed to
military training?
In his comments on the deferment, the author
of the letter in question neglected these facts:
• ROTC members are not automatically given
a deferment until they enter the third year <ff
their college ROTC training.
• Any student, ROTC member or not, can cur
rently be deferred all the way through college
without signing any loyalty oath. He need only
apply to his draft board for the I-S, 11-S, etc.,
series of student deferments, which are granted
solely on the basis of grades and have nothing
whatever to do with a loyalty oath.
Stanford's policy on ROTC warrants not "re
appraisal" but praise. The University recognizes
the need for a well-trained pool of officers, and
further recognizes that the ROTC programs can
fill this need by supplying to the armed forces
college-educated "officers and gentlemen," thus
infusing into the military the very source of that
"free thought" which is the primary "product"
of this or any other university.

Disappointment in Humor
Editor, The Daily:
Once again "The Old Boy" has hit the stands,
and, on noting the 16% per cent increase in price,
we figured on a bigger, better and wittier issue
than ever before. What a disappointment!
Now, we usually aren't ones to throw statistics
around, but in this case we feel that they're war
ranted. This month's Chappie contains 17 "jokes"
that were used in last year's issues. Furthermore,
four jokes in this issue were repeated at least
twice and, in one case, three times. The poetry
section boasts only two repeats from last year.
The remainder of the "jokes," with three possible
exceptions in the cartoon section, either date with
antiquity or aren't worth reading.
As to what to do about-the deplorable state of
our humor magazine, we can't say, but will offer
the Hammer and Coffin boys the following sug
gestion: Be less free with your criticism of The
Daily and concentrate a little more on improving
your own magazine.

ROTC Not 'Stifling'
Editor, The Daily:
In Wednesday's issue you published a letter
written by Haig Bosmajian in which he denounced
the position of the ROTC program in American
universities.
Bosmajian apparently thinks that the ROTC
program, because it is military, stifles intellectual
curiosity and the ability to think critically. lie
implies that an ROTC student, by conforming to
1 he military requirements, loses his individuality.
The conformity to which Mr. Bosmajian refers
consists of the wearing of uniforms, drill and use
of military procedure (i.e., saluting, addressing
seniors, etc.). Cooperation is necessary in almost
anything we do; the more a group cooperates
within itself, the more successfully it can operate
as a group. This can be seen in any sport and in
all human endeavor that involves more than one
person. The conformity required in the ROTC
merely enables its members to cooperate and
work together more efficiently.
Another implication in Wednesday's letter was
lhat ROTC renders the student incapable of
thinking for himself. On the contrary, one of
the purposes of the ROTC program is to teach
the student how to think for himself, in order
that he might make a good leader. The con
formity mentioned already does not impair ability

sary in any military organization in order that
discipline may be maintained; an army without
discipline is a mob. It cannot be argued that
ROTC is not a vital part of our armed forces;

were it not for the pool of trained officers avail
able at the outset of WW 11, mobilization of the
United States military machine would have been
greatly delayed, with dire effects for the Allied
cause.
Thus, discipline, and consequently a certain
amount of conformity, is necessary to the ROTC.
But, to say that this would in any way "affect"
the student in other classes is to state a conclu
sion which does not follow logically from the
facts. Can it be proven that ROTC students'
grades are lower than non-ROTC members? If
so, and it is unlikely, can this be attributed to
military training?
In his comments on the deferment, the author
of the letter in question neglected these facts:
• ROTC members are not automatically given
a deferment until they enter the third year <ff
their college ROTC training.
• Any student, ROTC member or not, can cur
rently be deferred all the way through college
without signing any loyalty oath. He need only
apply to his draft board for the I-S, 11-S, etc.,
series of student deferments, which are granted
solely on the basis of grades and have nothing
whatever to do with a loyalty oath.
Stanford's policy on ROTC warrants not "re
appraisal" but praise. The University recognizes
the need for a well-trained pool of officers, and
further recognizes that the ROTC programs can
fill this need by supplying to the armed forces
college-educated "officers and gentlemen," thus
infusing into the military the very source of that
"free thought" which is the primary "product"
of this or any other university.

Disappointment in Humor
Editor, The Daily:
Once again "The Old Boy" has hit the stands,
and, on noting the 16% per cent increase in price,
we figured on a bigger, better and wittier issue
than ever before. What a disappointment!
Now, we usually aren't ones to throw statistics
around, but in this case we feel that they're war
ranted. This month's Chappie contains 17 "jokes"
that were used in last year's issues. Furthermore,
four jokes in this issue were repeated at least
twice and, in one case, three times. The poetry
section boasts only two repeats from last year.
The remainder of the "jokes," with three possible
exceptions in the cartoon section, either date with
antiquity or aren't worth reading.
As to what to do about-the deplorable state of
our humor magazine, we can't say, but will offer
the Hammer and Coffin boys the following sug
gestion: Be less free with your criticism of The
Daily and concentrate a little more on improving
your own magazine.

ROTC Not 'Stifling'
Editor, The Daily:
In Wednesday's issue you published a letter
written by Haig Bosmajian in which he denounced
the position of the ROTC program in American
universities.
Bosmajian apparently thinks that the ROTC
program, because it is military, stifles intellectual
curiosity and the ability to think critically. lie
implies that an ROTC student, by conforming to
1 he military requirements, loses his individuality.
The conformity to which Mr. Bosmajian refers
consists of the wearing of uniforms, drill and use
of military procedure (i.e., saluting, addressing
seniors, etc.). Cooperation is necessary in almost
anything we do; the more a group cooperates
within itself, the more successfully it can operate
as a group. This can be seen in any sport and in
all human endeavor that involves more than one
person. The conformity required in the ROTC
merely enables its members to cooperate and
work together more efficiently.
Another implication in Wednesday's letter was
lhat ROTC renders the student incapable of
thinking for himself. On the contrary, one of
the purposes of the ROTC program is to teach
the student how to think for himself, in order
that he might make a good leader. The con
formity mentioned already does not impair ability
to think clearly.
It is true that the University should cause the
student to question everything he believes in, so
that he may test the validity of his own concepts
and choose or reaffirm his political, economic
and moral standards for himself. It is also true
that a military leader must have loyalty toward
his organization and his country if he is to lead
others to perform their tasks.
Those of us in ROTC, along with most Ameri
cans, are firm in our belief that our country has
the most satisfactory political system and that it
is worth defending.
Perhaps there is justification in criticizing loy
alty oaths. It would be more appropriate, how
ever, to complain about the circumstances that
have made such oaths necessary.

Digging through the specious logic and half

it is found that the author of said letter criticizes
