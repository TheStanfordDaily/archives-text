# Melodramatic Situations Make 'Fashion' Disappointing Play
## Director's Attempt to Recreate Original Flavor Of Century-Old Play Turns Satire to Burlesque 
### Dick Lee 
The current Stanford Players' production, "Fashion," by Anna
Cora Mowatt, seems hardly worth the efforts of Director F. Cowles
Strickland and his associates.
Throughout the play, the actors prattle and rave in stock situa
tions more appropriate to old Western melodramas than to the more

sophisticated comedies of man
ners.
The play will also run today
and tomorrow night at 8:15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
It is obvious that the director
and cast attempt to reproduce the
play as it was first performed in
1845. Either American play-writ
ing or American acting was poor
enough to make an unprofitable
example.
Audience Tastes Alter
The Stanford Players should
promote works which present act
ing situations and technical prob
lems of historical interest and sig
nificance. Yet audience tastes may
so alter that what was satire be
comes burlesque and what was
comedy is now farce. The audi
ence would like to laugh with, not
at, the play.
The settings and costumes eas
ily set the mood for satirical com
edy. Wendell Cole has effectively
captured the stuffy, overbearing,
"fashionable" elegance of rich
New York in 1845. His visible
changes of backdrops and painted
wings heighten the desired comic
air.
Fantastic Costumes
Irene Griffin's fantastic cos
tumes ama?e and astonish the au
dience at each new entrance of a
character in a more lavish outfit.
A sartorial climax is reached in
Mrs. Tiffany's ballroom dress, a
gaudy creation of pink, blue and
white with a skirt at least six feet
wide.
Katheleen Duffy superbly cre
ates Mrs. Tiffany, the "lady who
imagines herself fashionable."
Mrs. Tiffany's French pronuncia
tion and her "fashionable" man
nerisms are displayed with vital
ity and humor.
William Kinsolving as the sham
French count delights his audi
ence with every word and action.
His affectations and mock gen
tility enliven every scene.
Disappointing Performance
Charles Lown's characterization
of Adam Trueman w;ls a great
disappointment, instead of the
"truthful and touching" perform
ance envisaged by Mrs. Mowatt.
we endure labored delivery and
dull actions. Even Nancy Fowlkes I
as Gertrude, the honest, simple I
governess, is occasionally tedious.
The smaller character parts,
since indeed all parts seem to be
character parts, are professionally
executed. The French lady's maid
Millinette and the colored servant
Zeke, played by Nancy Cole and
Mark Hammer, are delightful as
they rush on and off stage.
Marie Brierly as .Seraphina has
an amazing giggle. Shirley Doug
lass manages to observe every
thing as the snoopy Prudence.


BOGUS COUNT —William Kinsolving as Count Jolimaitre, bogus
French count, beguiles Serapliina played by Marie Brierly in "Fash
ion," Anna Cora Mowatt's early American farce comedy which
opened last night at Memorial Auditorium.
