# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Demos, GOP Vie for Labor, Business Vote 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
The Republican party platform of 1952 said,
among other things, "We believe in combating
inflation by encouraging full production of
goods and foods, and not through a program
of restrictions. 1 "
The Republicans had good intentions, but
once in control of the government they discov
ered their intentions could not be supported
by the facts.
Early in 1953 the Administration realized
that to curb rising inflation it had to impose
strong monetary controls.
'The Republican administration also believed
that it would be nice to balance the federal
budget, to bring about economy in government.
But even here the facts of national economics
overruled the Administration's intentions.
In the fall of 1953 the government was forced
into the realization that to curb a recessionary
trend it had to enter into deficit spending, thus
playing havoc with its well-meant intentions.
So far as government economy goes, at no time
in the past four years has the government been
able to come close to its desired $60 billion
expense budget.
In all fairness to the Republicans, it must be
admitted that the nation is enjoying a period
of unprecedented prosperity. But this unprece
dented prosperity came about, not as a result
of the intentions of the Republicans, but as the
result of the employment by the Administra
tion of methods advocated by the Democrats.
As Edwin L. Dale, Jr., pointed out in an
analysis of Eisenhower's economic policy in the
New York Times, July 24, ". . . it was an econ
omy not markedly different from the structure
that a lot of Republicans had once thought was
a Frankinstein monster. Big government not
only proved tough to cut down, but rather
useful."
There is a generalization floating around
wl lich states that the Democrats are friendly
to organized labor and the Republicans are not.
This is a rather unfair generalization, though
true in many respects..
Organized labor does not like some features
of the Taft-Hartley Act. Truman vetoed it, but
the Republican 80th Congress overrode the
veto. Publicly, Republicans have admitted*
there are objectionable features to the act, but
as yet they have done nothing about it.
1 he Democrats charge the Republicans with
closing their eyes to the continually changing
needs of labor. In this charge tliev are backed
up by the AFL-CIO. It is to be remembered
that not all labor leaders endorse Democrats,
but by far the largest portion of them do.
Obviously there must be reasons for them
to do so. I bus, even though a generalization
may be unfair, there is little doubt but what
labor itself feels a far more congenial attitude
from the direction of the Democrats.

Business ami labor have more reason this
election year to swing their support to Repub
licans than ever before in the history of the
nation. The central reason is the existence of
"prosperity," a word which is political poison
to Democrats.
When Republicans use the word they are
referring to an economic ami psychological
status which has developed under the last four
years of the Eisenhower administration.
Economically it can be expressed in terms
of dollars and cents; psychologically it can be
seen in the confident mood of American buyers,
sellers and working people iu every segment
of the economy.
Democrats have tried to confuse the issue
with a two-pronged assertion: that the Admin
istration has favored "big business" at the
expense of everyone else, and that the GOP
has failed to keep down the cost of living.
First of all, it is true that President Eisen
hower does not happen to think big business
is bad for the country. He knows its value for
mass-producing defensive military weapons.
He knows its value as a stimulant to the econ
omy and to the labor force it employs.
Hut it is not true that small business has been
made a doormat for the bigger enterprises.
I'acts show small business is receiving about
one-third, dollar-wise, of all defense contracts.
Under the Eisenhower leadership there has
been successfully created the Small Business
Administration to focus attention on positive
measures to help small business.
As to the second argument, il is true that the
cost of living has gone up 3 per cent during
the past 3y 2 years. I lie rise is imperceptible
alongside that spiral of the Truman adminis
tration.
At the same time wages have made real ad
vances and are now at the highest level ever.
The economy, through the elimination of need
less controls, has moved closer to the free enter
prise system envisioned by Eisenhower and
further away from the regimentation which
characterized the previous 20 years.
In two of its four years the OOF has balanced
the budget and begun on the trail of retiring
the large Democratic-initiated national debt.
\\ hat is more, America's working force is at
an all-time high of 66 million, up 4 million.
And there are less than 3 million unemployed,
a great deal of that number being transitory.
Facts such as the above cannot be refuted by
the Democrats, which tends to frustrate them
into wild and reckless claims that are an insult
to the intelligence. They conclude lamely that
"there is danger" hi the contentment of Ameri
can workers and business.
The vast majority of the workers ami busi
ness men of our country have money in their
pockets and smiles on their faces.

In all fairness to the Republicans, it must be
admitted that the nation is enjoying a period
of unprecedented prosperity. But this unprece
dented prosperity came about, not as a result
of the intentions of the Republicans, but as the
result of the employment by the Administra
tion of methods advocated by the Democrats.
As Edwin L. Dale, Jr., pointed out in an
analysis of Eisenhower's economic policy in the
New York Times, July 24, ". . . it was an econ
omy not markedly different from the structure
that a lot of Republicans had once thought was
a Frankinstein monster. Big government not
only proved tough to cut down, but rather
useful."
There is a generalization floating around
wl lich states that the Democrats are friendly
to organized labor and the Republicans are not.
This is a rather unfair generalization, though
true in many respects..
Organized labor does not like some features
of the Taft-Hartley Act. Truman vetoed it, but
the Republican 80th Congress overrode the
veto. Publicly, Republicans have admitted*
there are objectionable features to the act, but
as yet they have done nothing about it.
1 he Democrats charge the Republicans with
closing their eyes to the continually changing
needs of labor. In this charge tliev are backed
up by the AFL-CIO. It is to be remembered
that not all labor leaders endorse Democrats,
but by far the largest portion of them do.
Obviously there must be reasons for them
to do so. I bus, even though a generalization
may be unfair, there is little doubt but what
labor itself feels a far more congenial attitude
from the direction of the Democrats.

Business ami labor have more reason this
election year to swing their support to Repub
licans than ever before in the history of the
nation. The central reason is the existence of
"prosperity," a word which is political poison
to Democrats.
When Republicans use the word they are
referring to an economic ami psychological
status which has developed under the last four
years of the Eisenhower administration.
Economically it can be expressed in terms
of dollars and cents; psychologically it can be
seen in the confident mood of American buyers,
sellers and working people iu every segment
of the economy.
Democrats have tried to confuse the issue
with a two-pronged assertion: that the Admin
istration has favored "big business" at the
expense of everyone else, and that the GOP
has failed to keep down the cost of living.
First of all, it is true that President Eisen
hower does not happen to think big business
is bad for the country. He knows its value for
mass-producing defensive military weapons.
He knows its value as a stimulant to the econ
omy and to the labor force it employs.
Hut it is not true that small business has been
made a doormat for the bigger enterprises.
I'acts show small business is receiving about
one-third, dollar-wise, of all defense contracts.
Under the Eisenhower leadership there has
been successfully created the Small Business
Administration to focus attention on positive
measures to help small business.
As to the second argument, il is true that the
cost of living has gone up 3 per cent during
the past 3y 2 years. I lie rise is imperceptible
alongside that spiral of the Truman adminis
tration.
At the same time wages have made real ad
vances and are now at the highest level ever.
The economy, through the elimination of need
less controls, has moved closer to the free enter
prise system envisioned by Eisenhower and
further away from the regimentation which
characterized the previous 20 years.
In two of its four years the OOF has balanced
the budget and begun on the trail of retiring
the large Democratic-initiated national debt.
\\ hat is more, America's working force is at
an all-time high of 66 million, up 4 million.
And there are less than 3 million unemployed,
a great deal of that number being transitory.
Facts such as the above cannot be refuted by
the Democrats, which tends to frustrate them
into wild and reckless claims that are an insult
to the intelligence. They conclude lamely that
"there is danger" hi the contentment of Ameri
can workers and business.
The vast majority of the workers ami busi
ness men of our country have money in their
pockets and smiles on their faces.
The Republican party platform of 1952 said,
among other things, "We believe in combating
inflation by encouraging full production of
goods and foods, and not through a program
of restrictions. 1 "
The Republicans had good intentions, but
once in control of the government they discov
ered their intentions could not be supported
by the facts.
Early in 1953 the Administration realized
that to curb rising inflation it had to impose
strong monetary controls.
'The Republican administration also believed
that it would be nice to balance the federal
budget, to bring about economy in government.
But even here the facts of national economics
overruled the Administration's intentions.
In the fall of 1953 the government was forced
into the realization that to curb a recessionary
trend it had to enter into deficit spending, thus
playing havoc with its well-meant intentions.
So far as government economy goes, at no time
in the past four years has the government been
able to come close to its desired $60 billion
expense budget.

there are objectionable features to the act, but
as yet they have done nothing about it.
1 he Democrats charge the Republicans with
closing their eyes to the continually changing
needs of labor. In this charge tliev are backed
up by the AFL-CIO. It is to be remembered
that not all labor leaders endorse Democrats,
but by far the largest portion of them do.
Obviously there must be reasons for them
to do so. I bus, even though a generalization
may be unfair, there is little doubt but what
labor itself feels a far more congenial attitude
from the direction of the Democrats.

Business ami labor have more reason this
election year to swing their support to Repub
licans than ever before in the history of the
nation. The central reason is the existence of
"prosperity," a word which is political poison
to Democrats.
When Republicans use the word they are
referring to an economic ami psychological
status which has developed under the last four
years of the Eisenhower administration.
Economically it can be expressed in terms
of dollars and cents; psychologically it can be
seen in the confident mood of American buyers,
sellers and working people iu every segment
of the economy.
Democrats have tried to confuse the issue
with a two-pronged assertion: that the Admin
istration has favored "big business" at the
expense of everyone else, and that the GOP
has failed to keep down the cost of living.
First of all, it is true that President Eisen
hower does not happen to think big business
is bad for the country. He knows its value for
mass-producing defensive military weapons.
He knows its value as a stimulant to the econ
omy and to the labor force it employs.
Hut it is not true that small business has been
made a doormat for the bigger enterprises.
I'acts show small business is receiving about
one-third, dollar-wise, of all defense contracts.
Under the Eisenhower leadership there has
been successfully created the Small Business
Administration to focus attention on positive
measures to help small business.
As to the second argument, il is true that the
cost of living has gone up 3 per cent during
the past 3y 2 years. I lie rise is imperceptible
alongside that spiral of the Truman adminis
tration.
At the same time wages have made real ad
vances and are now at the highest level ever.
The economy, through the elimination of need
less controls, has moved closer to the free enter
prise system envisioned by Eisenhower and
further away from the regimentation which
characterized the previous 20 years.
In two of its four years the OOF has balanced
the budget and begun on the trail of retiring
the large Democratic-initiated national debt.
\\ hat is more, America's working force is at
an all-time high of 66 million, up 4 million.
And there are less than 3 million unemployed,
a great deal of that number being transitory.
Facts such as the above cannot be refuted by
the Democrats, which tends to frustrate them
into wild and reckless claims that are an insult
to the intelligence. They conclude lamely that
"there is danger" hi the contentment of Ameri
can workers and business.
The vast majority of the workers ami busi
ness men of our country have money in their
pockets and smiles on their faces.
The Republican party platform of 1952 said,
among other things, "We believe in combating
inflation by encouraging full production of
goods and foods, and not through a program
of restrictions. 1 "
The Republicans had good intentions, but
once in control of the government they discov
ered their intentions could not be supported
by the facts.
Early in 1953 the Administration realized
that to curb rising inflation it had to impose
strong monetary controls.
'The Republican administration also believed
that it would be nice to balance the federal
budget, to bring about economy in government.
But even here the facts of national economics
overruled the Administration's intentions.
In the fall of 1953 the government was forced
into the realization that to curb a recessionary
trend it had to enter into deficit spending, thus
playing havoc with its well-meant intentions.
So far as government economy goes, at no time
in the past four years has the government been
able to come close to its desired $60 billion
expense budget.
In all fairness to the Republicans, it must be
admitted that the nation is enjoying a period
of unprecedented prosperity. But this unprece
dented prosperity came about, not as a result
of the intentions of the Republicans, but as the
result of the employment by the Administra
tion of methods advocated by the Democrats.
As Edwin L. Dale, Jr., pointed out in an
analysis of Eisenhower's economic policy in the
New York Times, July 24, ". . . it was an econ
omy not markedly different from the structure
that a lot of Republicans had once thought was
a Frankinstein monster. Big government not
only proved tough to cut down, but rather
useful."
There is a generalization floating around
wl lich states that the Democrats are friendly
to organized labor and the Republicans are not.
This is a rather unfair generalization, though
true in many respects..
Organized labor does not like some features
of the Taft-Hartley Act. Truman vetoed it, but
the Republican 80th Congress overrode the
veto. Publicly, Republicans have admitted*
there are objectionable features to the act, but
as yet they have done nothing about it.
