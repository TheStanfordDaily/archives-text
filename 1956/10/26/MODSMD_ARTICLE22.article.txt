Is studying bugging you? Do you have trouble re
membering names, dates, facts, figures, and the location
of the library? Dear friends, it need not be so. All you
have to do is master the simple art of mnemonics.
Mnemonics, as we all know, was invented by the great
Greek philosopher Mnemon in 526 B.C. Mnemonics, in
cidentally, was only one of the many inventions of this
fertile Athenian. He is perhaps best known for his in
vention of the staircase, which, as you may imagine, was
of inestimable value to mankind. Before the staircase,
people who wished to go from floor to floor had to leap
from springboards. This meant, of course, that aged and
infirm persons were forced to live out their lives, willy
nilly, on the ground floor, and many of them grew cross
as bears. Especially Demosthenes, who was elected con
sul of Athens three times but never served because he
was unable to get up to the office of the commissioner
of oaths on the third floor to be sworn in.
But after Mnemon's staircase was invented, Demos
thenes got up to the third floor easy as pie and took the
oath—to Athens' sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes,
his temper shortened by years of confinement to the
ground floor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of
senseless and costly wars with the Persians, the Visigoths,
and the Ogallala Sioux. He was voted out of office in
517 B.C., and Mnemon, who had made his accession pos
sible, was pelted to death with fruit salad in the Duomo.

Hut I (i igress. We were discussing mnemonics, which
are nothing more than aids to memory — catchwords or
jingles that help you to remember names, dates, and
places. For example, any student of American history
surely knows the little jingle:
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
In fourteen hundred ninety two.
You see how simple a mnemonic is? There is no rea
son why you can't make up your own. Say, for instance,
that you are proceeding with American history.
The Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock
In sixteen hundred twenty, doc.
(This jingle is especially useful to medical students.)
The next important event is the Boston Tea Party.
Let us compose a rough-and-ready couplet about that:
Samuel Adams flung the tea
Into the briny Zuyder Zee.
You can see how simple and useful they are—not
only for history, but also for current events. For instance,
In nineteen hundred fifty six
It's the. cigarette that clicks!
What, you ask, is the cigarette that clicks? Why,
Philip Morris, of corris! And why shouldn't it click?
Could any cigarette be more pleasing to the palate? No!
Could any cigarette be more tempting to the taste buds?
No! A thundering, thumping, resounding no! Get some
today, hey. You'll see.

of inestimable value to mankind. Before the staircase,
people who wished to go from floor to floor had to leap
from springboards. This meant, of course, that aged and
infirm persons were forced to live out their lives, willy
nilly, on the ground floor, and many of them grew cross
as bears. Especially Demosthenes, who was elected con
sul of Athens three times but never served because he
was unable to get up to the office of the commissioner
of oaths on the third floor to be sworn in.
But after Mnemon's staircase was invented, Demos
thenes got up to the third floor easy as pie and took the
oath—to Athens' sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes,
his temper shortened by years of confinement to the
ground floor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of
senseless and costly wars with the Persians, the Visigoths,
and the Ogallala Sioux. He was voted out of office in
517 B.C., and Mnemon, who had made his accession pos
sible, was pelted to death with fruit salad in the Duomo.

Hut I (i igress. We were discussing mnemonics, which
are nothing more than aids to memory — catchwords or
jingles that help you to remember names, dates, and
places. For example, any student of American history
surely knows the little jingle:
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
In fourteen hundred ninety two.
You see how simple a mnemonic is? There is no rea
son why you can't make up your own. Say, for instance,
that you are proceeding with American history.
The Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock
In sixteen hundred twenty, doc.
(This jingle is especially useful to medical students.)
The next important event is the Boston Tea Party.
Let us compose a rough-and-ready couplet about that:
Samuel Adams flung the tea
Into the briny Zuyder Zee.
You can see how simple and useful they are—not
only for history, but also for current events. For instance,
In nineteen hundred fifty six
It's the. cigarette that clicks!
What, you ask, is the cigarette that clicks? Why,
Philip Morris, of corris! And why shouldn't it click?
Could any cigarette be more pleasing to the palate? No!
Could any cigarette be more tempting to the taste buds?
No! A thundering, thumping, resounding no! Get some
today, hey. You'll see.

Greek philosopher Mnemon in 526 B.C. Mnemonics, in
