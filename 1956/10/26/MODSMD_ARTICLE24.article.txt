# Leland Stanford Jr. Collections Form Basis of Famous Museum Displays
## Stanford's Son Began Collection in Europe With Travel Souvenirs 
### 
Leland Stanford, Jr., was in
terested in collecting a wide va
riety of objects. By the end of his
tragically short life he had gath
ered so many items that his par
ents built the Leland Stanford, Jr.,
Museum around his small but
notable collection.
When only 12 he accompanied
his mother on a European tour,
and he determined to bring back
a representative memento from
every city they visited.
His collection constantly grew,
and later his parents encouraged
him in his plans to establish a
museum in San Francisco.
While Leland and his parents
were traveling in Italy in 1884,
shortly before Leland's 16th birth
day, he was fatally stricken with
typhoid fever.
Memorial
Governor and Mrs. Stanford
wished to establish a memorial to
their only son. Their first idea,
remembering Leland's fondness
for collecting, was to build a mu
seum. Finally, however, they de
cided to establish an institute of
learning on the governor's Palo
Alto stock farm.
But Mrs. Stanford could not for
get the idea of a museum, and
Governor Stanford placed the
matter in her hands, giving her
$1 million. The result was the
Leland Stanford, Jr., Museum,
which opened at the same time as
the University.
At one time the Museum was
the largest private museum in the
world. It also had the distinction
at one time of being the world's
only steel-reinforced concrete
building.
Earthquake
The year after Mrs. Stanford's
death the area was rocked by the
1906 earthquake, and portions of
the Museum collapsed. Many val
uable items were destroyed or
lost. Later the Museum was re
paired.
But during the mid-1940's a lack
of capital made it necessary to
close the Museum. After nine
years the University's Board of
Trustees granted the necessary
funds for reopening the institu
tion.
Collections were revamped and
the Museum doors were opened
to the public in May 1954. Since
that time more than 65,000 visi
tors ha\e viewed the many dis
plays and collections there.
Various Displays
Today the Museum has collec
tions comparable to any in the
United States, explained director
Mrs. Helen Cross. Displays in
clude Roman, Greek, Egyptian
and Oriental materials as well as
relics from ancient Indian cul
tures of this hemisphere.
Also on display are an unusual
collection of pioneer California
furniture, historical materials re
lating to the Stanford family and
modern American sculpture. One
room is devoted to Leland, Jr.,'s
collection, which Mrs. Cross refers
to as the "nest egg" of the Uni
versity.
Golden Spike
Visitors may also see the "Gov
ernor Stanford," the first locomo
tive used by the Central Pacific
Railroad. The gold spike which
was used at the completion of the
first transcontinental railroad in
1869 is also displayed.
Later this month the Museum
will feature an exhibit of 43 Chi
nese paintings. This will be one
of the finest, such collections
available for showing, said Mrs.
Cross.
The Museum is located north of
the Quad, a short distance west
of Palm Drive. It is open to the
public daily from 1 to 5 p.m. There
is no admission charge to stu
dents.

LELAND STANFORD JR.'S MEMORIAL—The Museum is located
just off I'alm Drive and is rarely visited by Stanford students. The
collection inside includes mementos of Leland Jr.'s European trip
and other objects of art. —Daily Photo by George Wyse
Leland Stanford, Jr., was in
terested in collecting a wide va
riety of objects. By the end of his
tragically short life he had gath
ered so many items that his par
ents built the Leland Stanford, Jr.,
Museum around his small but
notable collection.
When only 12 he accompanied
his mother on a European tour,
and he determined to bring back
a representative memento from
every city they visited.
His collection constantly grew,
and later his parents encouraged
him in his plans to establish a
museum in San Francisco.
While Leland and his parents
were traveling in Italy in 1884,
shortly before Leland's 16th birth
day, he was fatally stricken with
typhoid fever.
Memorial
Governor and Mrs. Stanford
wished to establish a memorial to
their only son. Their first idea,
remembering Leland's fondness
for collecting, was to build a mu
seum. Finally, however, they de
cided to establish an institute of
learning on the governor's Palo
Alto stock farm.
But Mrs. Stanford could not for
get the idea of a museum, and
Governor Stanford placed the
matter in her hands, giving her
$1 million. The result was the
Leland Stanford, Jr., Museum,
which opened at the same time as
the University.
At one time the Museum was
the largest private museum in the
world. It also had the distinction
at one time of being the world's
only steel-reinforced concrete
building.
Earthquake
The year after Mrs. Stanford's
death the area was rocked by the
1906 earthquake, and portions of
the Museum collapsed. Many val
uable items were destroyed or
lost. Later the Museum was re
paired.
But during the mid-1940's a lack
of capital made it necessary to
close the Museum. After nine
years the University's Board of
Trustees granted the necessary
funds for reopening the institu
tion.
Collections were revamped and
the Museum doors were opened
to the public in May 1954. Since
that time more than 65,000 visi
tors ha\e viewed the many dis
plays and collections there.
Various Displays
Today the Museum has collec
tions comparable to any in the
United States, explained director
Mrs. Helen Cross. Displays in
clude Roman, Greek, Egyptian
and Oriental materials as well as
relics from ancient Indian cul
tures of this hemisphere.
Also on display are an unusual
collection of pioneer California
furniture, historical materials re
lating to the Stanford family and
modern American sculpture. One
room is devoted to Leland, Jr.,'s
collection, which Mrs. Cross refers
to as the "nest egg" of the Uni
versity.
