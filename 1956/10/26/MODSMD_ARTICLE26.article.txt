# Cellar Heads Campus Chain Of 'Holes' in Women's Dorms
## 
### 
Stanford has its own chain of
stores right on campus, all center
ing around the Union Store. Bet
ter known as The Cellar, it is the
headquarters for a number of sub
stores, or "Holes," in the women's
dormitories.
William R. Gunther is the man
responsible for keeping the Cellar
running smoothly. During the 25
years he has worked there he has
developed a philosophic attitude
toward the petty thefts of maga
zines, candy and other items.
"I have a problem with children
after school and on week ends,"
he says. "They are apt to swipe
things." Gunther points out that
any self-service store may have
as much as a 6 per cent loss of
merchandise by theft.
The student-operated stores in
the women's residences have had
a long and successful history, ac
cording to Miss Christine Ricker,
director of the University dining
halls. The stores are called
"Holes" because the first one,
started in Roble in 1927, was in a
dark little cubbyhole in the base
ment.
Lagunita opened its store in
1934, and Branner got one when
it was converted into a women's
residence after the Army moved
out in 1943. Space has already
been provided for a store in Flor
ence Moore.
Women are chosen to operate
the stores by each hall's director,
and they receive a commission on
what is sold.
All income from the various
parts of the Union —the office,
the dining room, conferences, ca
tering services, the Holes and the
Cellar—goes to the Tresidder Me

morial Union Fund. Of the Union
dues (student community fees)
paid with the board and room,
the women's dues go to the Wom
en's Clubhouse and the men's fees
are added to the Tresidder fund.
Tresidder Memorial Union fund,
created in honor of Donald Tresid
der, fourth president of Stanford,
will be used to build a new Stu
dent Union. The old Union is ten
tatively being considered for a
men's faculty club and campus
inn, Miss Ricker said.
Income from Union stores was
used from 1934 to 1948 to help
build Memorial Auditorium. Upon
completion of the auditorium the
Tresidder fund was started.

Lagunita opened its store in
1934, and Branner got one when
it was converted into a women's
residence after the Army moved
out in 1943. Space has already
been provided for a store in Flor
ence Moore.
Women are chosen to operate
the stores by each hall's director,
and they receive a commission on
what is sold.
All income from the various
parts of the Union —the office,
the dining room, conferences, ca
tering services, the Holes and the
Cellar—goes to the Tresidder Me

morial Union Fund. Of the Union
dues (student community fees)
paid with the board and room,
the women's dues go to the Wom
en's Clubhouse and the men's fees
are added to the Tresidder fund.
Tresidder Memorial Union fund,
created in honor of Donald Tresid
der, fourth president of Stanford,
will be used to build a new Stu
dent Union. The old Union is ten
tatively being considered for a
men's faculty club and campus
inn, Miss Ricker said.
Income from Union stores was
used from 1934 to 1948 to help
build Memorial Auditorium. Upon
completion of the auditorium the
Tresidder fund was started.
Stanford has its own chain of
stores right on campus, all center
ing around the Union Store. Bet
ter known as The Cellar, it is the
headquarters for a number of sub
stores, or "Holes," in the women's
dormitories.
William R. Gunther is the man
responsible for keeping the Cellar
running smoothly. During the 25
years he has worked there he has
developed a philosophic attitude
toward the petty thefts of maga
zines, candy and other items.
"I have a problem with children
after school and on week ends,"
he says. "They are apt to swipe
things." Gunther points out that
any self-service store may have
as much as a 6 per cent loss of
merchandise by theft.
The student-operated stores in
the women's residences have had
a long and successful history, ac
cording to Miss Christine Ricker,
director of the University dining
halls. The stores are called
"Holes" because the first one,
started in Roble in 1927, was in a
dark little cubbyhole in the base
ment.
