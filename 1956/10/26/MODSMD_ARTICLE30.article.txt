# In the Sportlight

The invasion is on. By late tonight the Bay Area will he flooded
with Southern California rooters of all descriptions—thousands of
them arriving by train, car, bus and plane.
And so in keeping with the tourist season, this week's sportlight
shines on the anomaly of a strange breed—the USC football fan. It
is difficult to discuss the subject without first-hand information. For
tunately, I qualify frorii experience.
I was a Trojan spy.
Now it is not difficult to be a Trojan spy. It's no problem at all
to merge into the big noisy crowd that forms at Union Square in
San Francisco the night before the football game—like tonight—
and commit the pinnacle of espionage.
It was two years ago that I first became a Trojan spy. There
were a couple of hundred loyal SC fans standing there in the Square
at midnight, beverages in hand, drolly chanting, "We Want a Cable
Car."
A firecracker went off and somebody had started a bonfire with
some trash. Meanwhile someone had led a movement on a hope
lessly trapped cable car which by this time was gaily swinging from
side to side with dozens of maroon-jacketed students clinging to the
sides.
In the center of the square a cheerleader hopelessly tried to lead
the fight yell.
"We're going to win tomorrow!" shouted a well-lubricated Troy
rooter at my side, mistaking me for a fellow Southland fan.
"Naturally," I replied. "We are."
All around me we're the epitomes of the SC student. They were
interesting studies in psychology the smog-weakened eyes, the defi
nite attitude of athletic superiority. My conversant got lost in the
crowd as the police started to move in.
Eventually the men-in-blue managed to ward off a major riot on
the cable cars and a possible destruction of the square by fire. A
few of the rooters had dropped by the wayside, thinking happy
thoughts, and soon most fans had retired to their hotel rooms to pre
pare for the Saturday spectacle.
This same scene will be portrayed this weekend and provides a
worthwhile experience for those who have never had the chance to
study the SC rooter- from ihe inside. The addition of a "revenge"
motive this year will provide even greater psychological phenomena
for the student of mass emotions.
Fortunately, the upshot, of all this pre-game celebrating by the
Trojan fan is an over all physical fatigue when game time actually
arrives. Some even miss the game entirely because of oversleeping,
overindulgence, or overnight care in the San Francisco City Jail.
Nevertheless, the Trojan fans are capable of great lung exercise
whenever their team is sparkling on the field. A victory excites
them beyond words. In 1954 USC beat the Indians 21-7 and some
fans kept Fire Chief John Marston busy for an hour after the game
answering false alarms on campus. Alter games at Los Angeles,
they've been known to fill Fraternity Row with bonfires and beer
cans to express their delight.
However, defeat is bitter, especially for the alumni who keep
reins over ihe football pocket book. Jeff Cravath found out how it
was. Jess Hill couldn't escape getting promoted out of his job as a
result of last year's dismal PCC season, although this, his last, sea
son he may post his best record ever.
Indeed, the Trojan fan is a strange creature. Unfortunately the
Trojan football team is considerably less strange.
Rated sixth in the nation, SC has an easily-understandable power
on the field. None of the fans in the stand can detract from that.
Ever-optimistic Chuck (He Always Says "We'll Win") Taylor is
not changing his tune for this one. Stanford fans hope the song he
sings at 5 p.m. tomorrow will be a victory march.

POSTSCRIPT: Hard-pressed to find another winning slogan like
last year's "Smother the Smogman" motto which proved a 28-20
success, Rally Com brains have come up with this "Fricassee SC"
bit which they think will do the trick. Some fans remember the
brilliant "Flush the Troylet" dilty of a couple of seasons hack, but
that one was a loser. Perhaps the most successful slogan of recent
years was "Beat the Baby Blue" which turned the tide against UCLA
in 1953 the last time the Bruins were beaten fn conferecne play by
anyone. This year, with 'Arnett and Roberts at work in the Trojan
backfield, Stanford's "Fricassee" goal is to have two chickens in the
pot. But they'll have to be caught first.
