# BRODIE LEADS FROSH
## Stanford's Freshman Gridders To Host USC Trobabes Here 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford's 1956 freshman gridders open their season tomorrow
against the Southern California frosh. A preliminary to the varsity
game, kickoff time is slated for 11 a.m. in Memorial Stadium.
"This is one of the best teams I've ever had," said Stanford frosh
coach Bob Ghilotti. "But SC will probably be our toughest game.

Their line is very big while ours
is comparatively light for a col
lege squad.
"Although we lack depth and
size in the line, we have good
strength at end and in the back
field. We have some very nice
running backs. It is unusual to
get such a group."
A familar name will be quar
terbacking the Trobabes. Bill
Brodie, brother of Stanford's
great signal-caller, is scheduled
to open at quarterback for USC.
Young Brodie is tabbed as a top
flight passer, although not quite
as outstanding as his more fa
mous brother.
The Trobabes, like their big
brothers on the varsity, will run
out of a multiple offense. Brodie
will be in the blocking back slot
part of the time.
The Papooses will strike at the
Trobabes both on the ground and
through the air. Sid Garber is
expected to be the big arm in a
passing attack that features out
standingn receivers in Chris Bur
ford, Jerry Winters, John Bond,
Dick Bowers and Rick McMillen.
For rushing strength, the frosh
can call on fullback Jim Honey
well, Bowers, Mac Wylie and a
number of other top ground gain
ers.
USC makes up for its small
size, numerically, with some awe
some size, physically. Slated to

anchor the right side of the Tro
babe line is a little fellow named
Don Mattson, who scales 270
pounds. Tackle Ron Fernandes,
192, has been the standout in the
Papoose forward wall.
