# SU Cross-Country Hosts Cal-USC In PCC Action
## 
### 
Stanford will host California
and USC tomorrow as the Pacific
Coast Conference cross - country
season opens with what figures
to be one of the year's best meets.
Starting time for the four-mile
test is 10 a.m., with the race be
ginning and ending at the second
tee of the Stanford golf course.
Coach Payton Jordan will be
banking on Doug Martin, Bob
Monzingo, Maury Graves and
Ralph Love to help the Tribe gain
the victory. Jordan has nominat
ed Don Richardson, Ernie Cun
liffe and Don Chesarek to round
out the seven-man squad.
Eight other Stanford runners
will also be running as they at
tempt to break into the top seven
for next week's meet with UCLA
in Los Angeles.
Mai Robertson is the big threat
from USC. He recently placed
third in the SPAAU 3V2-mile run,
being beaten only by UCLA's Bob
Seaman and Occidental's Ty Had
ley.
Max Truex, another distance
ace from USC, is not expected to
run because of his current train
ing program for next month's
Olympic Games.
Little is known of the Cal
squad, except that they beat UC
LA by one point last week. This
alone makes them a distinct
threat in the meet.
Scoring for tomorrow's race
will be on a triple-dual basis, with
separate scores figured for Stan
ford vs. USC; Stanford vs. Cal,
and Cal vs. USC. Since the In
dians are to meet the Bears later
in the season, tomorrow's score
will not count in PCC standings.
