CHICAGO, Oct. 25 (UP)
Marty Minion, who was cited for
doing a "creditable" job of bring
ing the Chicago White Sox home
in third place, resigned today as
manager after his bosses recon
sidered and decided he might
have done better.
He will be paid in full for 1957
on a two-year contract which he
signed late in the 1955 campaign.
