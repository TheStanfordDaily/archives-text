# Looking It Over
## 
### 
With Jerry Kelly
Sports writers, residents of the Los Angeles area and members
of the two football institutions near Hollywood have been wanting
a long time their "day" is near. For the USC students, alumni,
coaches and squad tomorrow is their day. For UCLA and all Smog
land a week from tomorrow is the big one.
It's been over six months now since sports writers in the South
land began harping on Stanford, its fooball system and the back
route to the Rose Bowl. Residents and alumni in the area have writ
ten letters to the local sports editors on the "stink" with regularity.
«()»() TROY FANS EXPECTED
Upwards of 8000 fans will travel north to witness the Indian-
Trojan fracas, evidence of the importance to the Southern Cali
fornians. There's more at stake tomorrow than merely revenge
for last year's 28-20 Stanford win. Some nitwits outwardly believe
Stanford single-handedly paved its own way to Pasadena for Stan
ford's sake.
Now it's up to the football genius, Chuck Taylor, and his aroused
team members to chop El Troy to size. USC is a good team; tomor
row in Memorial Stadium Stanford can be a great team.
What should happen if the Cards dropped this one and went on
to beat the other PCC opponents, including the Oregon State Bea
vers, a definite contender?
Coach Taylor is a practical man faced with a schedule which
prohibits long-range plans. The "rarity of rarities," as the Post
magazine article calls him, plans from Saturday to Saturday taking
each game in stride. There will be no thoughts of a post season tilt
until after the Big Game. Then the coaches can discuss "What did
we do l ight this season; what did we do wrong?"
ARNETT FOR ALL-AMERICA?
Southern California has a great athlete in the person of .lon
Arnett, All American halfback last year and outstanding track
man. Arnett plays his last collegiate game tomorrow and hopes
to make it a memorable one. As one of the footballers caught in
the PCC shakedown, Arnett was allowed to participate in five con
secutive games this season.
The question now is: "Will Arnett repeat as an All-American?"
If the fancy runner were to play all season, there would be no ques
tion about it. In four games this year Arnett has gained 508 yards,
tops in the nation for a major school, and leads in PCC scoring with
37 points.
Another if! If Arnett performs anywhere near his average to
morrow (he has averaged 125 yards per game) he gets our vote for
All-America, five games or ten.
INDIANS WON'T HOG THE SPOTLIGHT
The Stanford-Southern Cal game is not the only important grid
battle on tap this weekend in Northern California. Tomorrow
uight College of Pacific hosts Washington State and Sunday the
San Francisco 49ers entertain the powerful Chicago Bears.
Many Stanford students plan to take in both encounters after the
Tribe-Troy affair. COP will get a real test from the aerial-minded
Cougars. The Daily football prognosticators pick COP, save for one.
Possibly sentiment over balances good sense for this writer.
