# Soccer Team in Tough Test Against Highly-Touted USF
## 
### Jack Winkler 
The Stanford soccer team faces its toughest game of the season
when it takes on the champion University of San Francisco here at
10 a.m. tomorrow in a game that promises an exciting duel between
Stanford's Ail-American center half Peter Mack and USF's wizard
center forward Obi from Nigeria.
The Cardinal team is given its best chance in many years of beat-

ing San Francisco which has won
the conference championship for
the last eight seasons running.
In all that lime the only blots on
the USF record have been two
ties with Stanford, a loss to City
College of San Francisco and a
tie two weeks ago with San Fran
cisco State. Stanford beat that
same State team 4-1 here last
week.
Bill Ditman, who played an
outstanding game last week, will
start in goal. Art Harlow will be
at right back and Jack Benjamin
has won the left back position
after a fine performance against
San Francisco State last Satur
day. Dave Brant, co-captain Peter
Mack and John Leonard will
form the starting halfback line,
though Jim Bowditch will play
quite a bit here.
The forward line is shaken up
with Ned Avery and Eduardo
Mall on the wings, Ben Pentsil
and co-captain Bill Wren at in
sides and Jack Winkler at center
forward. Tony Chandler, Mike
Asafo-Boakyne and Bob Schafer
will see a lot of action in the for
ward. Tony Chandler Mike Asa
fo-Boakyne and Bob Schafer will
also see a lot of action in the for
ward line. However, the team
goes into this important game
without Otto Jochems, who has
broken the arch in his left foot.
