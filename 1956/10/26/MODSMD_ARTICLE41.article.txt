# Trojan Titanic Tomorrow

time he has put his hands on the 1
ball.
SC Coach Jess Hill has made
no secret of the fact that they
will stay almost exclusively on j
the ground tomorrow. His strat
egy will be the one Michigan State
successfully used —to control the
ball, figuring that "he who doesn't
have the ball can't score."
Troy's seven starting linemen,
who have muscles attached, are
big but not overly quick. Their
most frequent strategy has been
to get a fast, short initial charge
and hem in the opposition's line
while Arnett or Roberts skirts
the end.
If Southern Cal has any weak
ness, it is its pass defense. Texas
completed 19 out of 34 against
them, and this past week in prac
tice quarterback Els Kissinger
completed passes galore while em
ulating Brodie against the first
team.
The most repetitive sight to
morrow will be Brodie cocking his
| arm back. 1-le leads the nation in
passing, having completed 72 of

: 123 passes far.54.1 per cent, 825
j yards and eight touchdowns.
There is no reason to believe
I that Brodie will not continue to
go to the air with such depend-
I able receivers as Camera, Carl
i Isaacs, fullback Lou Valli and end
Ben Robinson. In addition, red
headed Gary Van Galder returns
to the fold after having been out
with a knee injury.
Another returnee—although he
won't start —is center Bob Long,
out three weeks with mononu
cleosis.
A note of warning: Southern
Cal always plays its best here at
Stanford. The Cards have only
won 2 out of 15 games against
Troy up north. USC will not for
get that, nor will they forget that
Stanford won last year in the
Coliseum, 28 to 20. Nor will they
forget their "crusade."
This will be Stanford's third
game in five weeks against one
of the top 10 teams in the coun
; try—USC is rated sixth. Spirit in
practice has never been higher
I than during this last week. The
Indians are ready to take on the
! "crusade."

egy will be the one Michigan State
successfully used —to control the
ball, figuring that "he who doesn't
have the ball can't score."
Troy's seven starting linemen,
who have muscles attached, are
big but not overly quick. Their
most frequent strategy has been
to get a fast, short initial charge
and hem in the opposition's line
while Arnett or Roberts skirts
the end.
If Southern Cal has any weak
ness, it is its pass defense. Texas
completed 19 out of 34 against
them, and this past week in prac
tice quarterback Els Kissinger
completed passes galore while em
ulating Brodie against the first
team.
The most repetitive sight to
morrow will be Brodie cocking his
| arm back. 1-le leads the nation in
passing, having completed 72 of

: 123 passes far.54.1 per cent, 825
j yards and eight touchdowns.
There is no reason to believe
I that Brodie will not continue to
go to the air with such depend-
I able receivers as Camera, Carl
i Isaacs, fullback Lou Valli and end
Ben Robinson. In addition, red
headed Gary Van Galder returns
to the fold after having been out
with a knee injury.
Another returnee—although he
won't start —is center Bob Long,
out three weeks with mononu
cleosis.
A note of warning: Southern
Cal always plays its best here at
Stanford. The Cards have only
won 2 out of 15 games against
Troy up north. USC will not for
get that, nor will they forget that
Stanford won last year in the
Coliseum, 28 to 20. Nor will they
forget their "crusade."
This will be Stanford's third
game in five weeks against one
of the top 10 teams in the coun
; try—USC is rated sixth. Spirit in
practice has never been higher
I than during this last week. The
Indians are ready to take on the
! "crusade."
