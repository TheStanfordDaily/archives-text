# CARDS TO TAKE ON TROJAN ‘CRUSADE’
## Indians Will Try to Stop SC Backs Arnett, Roberts With Rose Bowl at Stake Brodie to Throw Against Weak Pass Defense; Southerners Will Employ Ball Control Tacties 
### Pete Grothe 
Clad in red jerseys, white pants and Johnson & Johnson tape,
Stanford's patched-up gridders will battle for their football lives to
morrow when they lock horns with unbeaten Southern California's
"crusading" Trojans in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
Approximately 65,000 posteriors are expected to be in the stands

by the 2 p.m. starling time. Stan
ford's reputedly excellent fresh
man team will ring down the cur
tain on its season in the 11 a.m.
preliminary.
Seldom has so much football
greatness been so heavily bound
in so much tape as this present
Stanford eleven. Yet the men who
count the most — All - American
tackle Paul Wiggin, halfback Paul
Camera and quarterback John
Brodie, the greatest passer in
America today—are in prime con
dition. And if Stanford is to win
tomorrow, it will be up to that
trio's muscular talents.
The Trojans are up here on a
"crusade," which, as one neutral
observer remarked, is "like A 1 Ca
pone going on a crusade." Wit
ness the rumblings from the
Southland:
L.A. Sports Editor
George T. Davis, sports editor
of the Los Angeles Herald Ex
press: "It's no secret that the
Trojans and the Bruins—hardest
hit by penalties — would rather
wallop Stanford than any team
on their schedules."
Harley Tinkmah of the Los An
geles Mirror-News: "The crusade
is on, men. Yep, it's a real cru
sade, and you know the reason.
Stanford is the only PCC school
Which voted against allowing SC
and UCLA seniors to play five
games this year."
Ray Sparling, ex-USC end and
now a prominent alum: "Those
schools, guilty of moral dishon
esty, are hiding behind a cloak of
hypocrisy, and they'll get their
ears pinned back."
C. R. Roberts, USC fullback:
"I'd rather give a good beating to
Stanford than any other team."
Trojan Boosters
Coming up to witness the pro
ceedings is the greatest move
ment since the swallows flew to
Capistrano. Approximately 3800
Trojan rooters and 9200 alums
are expected to trek to "Halo"
Alto, as they call it. Plus USC's
renowned 96-man marching band.
The unprecedented influx will
be here to view the game that will
probably decide the PCC cham
pionship. Stanford, which has ev
erything to gain and just as much
to lose, is a virtual shoo-in for the
PCC title and the Rose Bowl if it
wins.
But, in order to triumph. Chuck
Taylor's men must stop the two
best runners (as a bracket entry)
in the country, left halfback Jon
Arnett and fullback C. R. Roberts.
Arnett's Last.
This will he the last game for
Arnett and six other "five-game
seniors." Arnett Is fast, but he is
not the fastest back on the Coast.
Arnett is powerful, hut he is not
the most powerful back on the
Coast. However, when it comes
to balance he has perhaps no
equal in the country. He just
doesn't go down.
Arnett, who is the third leading
rusher in USC history, has the
ability to throw a tackier a hip
and take it away, leaving the
tackier grasping air. The Card
coaching staff has stressed that
only a clean tackle will stop the
190-pound Trojan.
Arnett Injured Slightly
Arnett. who gained 157 yards
against Washington for 7.14 yards
a carry, suffered a hip pointer
last week, but is expected to be
in lop shape tomorrow. Another
player who has just shook off an
injury is ricrht halfback Don Hick
man, who Trojan boosters tab as
one of the best blockers in USC
history.
Roberts, 206-pound fullback, is
faster and bigger than Arnett and.
like Arnett, loves to sweep the
ends. Roberts, who is- second to
Arnett in PCC rushing yardage, !
has averaged 10.3 yards every |


WINNING FORM —Action shot from last year's
game shows John Brodie going high to get of 112 a
pass in Stanford's 28-20 win over Southern Cali
fornia. Brodie came into his own in the USC
game last year, completing 11 of 26 passes, and

the Cards are again counting on his gifted right
arm to lead them in a repeat performance. Thou
sands are trekking northward to see if Brodic &
Co. can do it again.

WINNING FORM —Action shot from last year's

fornia. Brodie came into his own in the USC
game last year, completing 11 of 26 passes, and

the Cards are again counting on his gifted right

Clad in red jerseys, white pants and Johnson & Johnson tape,
Stanford's patched-up gridders will battle for their football lives to
morrow when they lock horns with unbeaten Southern California's
"crusading" Trojans in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
Approximately 65,000 posteriors are expected to be in the stands

by the 2 p.m. starling time. Stan
ford's reputedly excellent fresh
man team will ring down the cur
tain on its season in the 11 a.m.
preliminary.
Seldom has so much football
greatness been so heavily bound
in so much tape as this present
Stanford eleven. Yet the men who
count the most — All - American
tackle Paul Wiggin, halfback Paul
Camera and quarterback John
Brodie, the greatest passer in
America today—are in prime con
dition. And if Stanford is to win
tomorrow, it will be up to that
trio's muscular talents.
The Trojans are up here on a
"crusade," which, as one neutral
observer remarked, is "like A 1 Ca
pone going on a crusade." Wit
ness the rumblings from the
Southland:
L.A. Sports Editor
George T. Davis, sports editor
of the Los Angeles Herald Ex
press: "It's no secret that the
Trojans and the Bruins—hardest
hit by penalties — would rather
wallop Stanford than any team
on their schedules."
Harley Tinkmah of the Los An
geles Mirror-News: "The crusade
is on, men. Yep, it's a real cru
sade, and you know the reason.
Stanford is the only PCC school
Which voted against allowing SC
and UCLA seniors to play five
games this year."
Ray Sparling, ex-USC end and
now a prominent alum: "Those
schools, guilty of moral dishon
esty, are hiding behind a cloak of
hypocrisy, and they'll get their
ears pinned back."
C. R. Roberts, USC fullback:
"I'd rather give a good beating to
Stanford than any other team."
Trojan Boosters
Coming up to witness the pro
ceedings is the greatest move
ment since the swallows flew to
Capistrano. Approximately 3800
Trojan rooters and 9200 alums
are expected to trek to "Halo"
Alto, as they call it. Plus USC's
renowned 96-man marching band.
The unprecedented influx will
be here to view the game that will
probably decide the PCC cham
pionship. Stanford, which has ev
erything to gain and just as much
to lose, is a virtual shoo-in for the
PCC title and the Rose Bowl if it
wins.
But, in order to triumph. Chuck
Taylor's men must stop the two
best runners (as a bracket entry)
in the country, left halfback Jon
Arnett and fullback C. R. Roberts.
Arnett's Last.
This will he the last game for
Arnett and six other "five-game
seniors." Arnett Is fast, but he is
not the fastest back on the Coast.
Arnett is powerful, hut he is not
the most powerful back on the
Coast. However, when it comes
to balance he has perhaps no
equal in the country. He just
doesn't go down.
Arnett, who is the third leading
rusher in USC history, has the
ability to throw a tackier a hip
and take it away, leaving the
tackier grasping air. The Card

be here to view the game that will
probably decide the PCC cham
pionship. Stanford, which has ev
erything to gain and just as much
to lose, is a virtual shoo-in for the
PCC title and the Rose Bowl if it
wins.
But, in order to triumph. Chuck
Taylor's men must stop the two
best runners (as a bracket entry)
in the country, left halfback Jon
Arnett and fullback C. R. Roberts.
Arnett's Last.
This will he the last game for
Arnett and six other "five-game
seniors." Arnett Is fast, but he is
not the fastest back on the Coast.
Arnett is powerful, hut he is not
the most powerful back on the
Coast. However, when it comes
to balance he has perhaps no
equal in the country. He just
doesn't go down.
Arnett, who is the third leading
rusher in USC history, has the
ability to throw a tackier a hip
and take it away, leaving the
tackier grasping air. The Card
coaching staff has stressed that
only a clean tackle will stop the
190-pound Trojan.
Arnett Injured Slightly
Arnett. who gained 157 yards
against Washington for 7.14 yards
a carry, suffered a hip pointer
last week, but is expected to be
in lop shape tomorrow. Another
player who has just shook off an
injury is ricrht halfback Don Hick
man, who Trojan boosters tab as
one of the best blockers in USC
history.
Roberts, 206-pound fullback, is
faster and bigger than Arnett and.
like Arnett, loves to sweep the
ends. Roberts, who is- second to
Arnett in PCC rushing yardage, !
has averaged 10.3 yards every |


WINNING FORM —Action shot from last year's
game shows John Brodie going high to get of 112 a
pass in Stanford's 28-20 win over Southern Cali
fornia. Brodie came into his own in the USC
game last year, completing 11 of 26 passes, and

the Cards are again counting on his gifted right
arm to lead them in a repeat performance. Thou
sands are trekking northward to see if Brodic &
Co. can do it again.

Clad in red jerseys, white pants and Johnson & Johnson tape,
Stanford's patched-up gridders will battle for their football lives to
morrow when they lock horns with unbeaten Southern California's
"crusading" Trojans in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
Approximately 65,000 posteriors are expected to be in the stands

by the 2 p.m. starling time. Stan
ford's reputedly excellent fresh
man team will ring down the cur
tain on its season in the 11 a.m.
preliminary.
Seldom has so much football
greatness been so heavily bound
in so much tape as this present
Stanford eleven. Yet the men who
count the most — All - American
tackle Paul Wiggin, halfback Paul
Camera and quarterback John
Brodie, the greatest passer in
America today—are in prime con
dition. And if Stanford is to win
tomorrow, it will be up to that
trio's muscular talents.
The Trojans are up here on a
"crusade," which, as one neutral
observer remarked, is "like A 1 Ca
pone going on a crusade." Wit
ness the rumblings from the
Southland:
L.A. Sports Editor
George T. Davis, sports editor
of the Los Angeles Herald Ex
press: "It's no secret that the
Trojans and the Bruins—hardest
hit by penalties — would rather
wallop Stanford than any team
on their schedules."
Harley Tinkmah of the Los An
geles Mirror-News: "The crusade
is on, men. Yep, it's a real cru
sade, and you know the reason.
Stanford is the only PCC school
Which voted against allowing SC
and UCLA seniors to play five
games this year."
Ray Sparling, ex-USC end and
now a prominent alum: "Those
schools, guilty of moral dishon
esty, are hiding behind a cloak of
hypocrisy, and they'll get their
ears pinned back."
C. R. Roberts, USC fullback:
"I'd rather give a good beating to
Stanford than any other team."
Trojan Boosters
Coming up to witness the pro
ceedings is the greatest move
ment since the swallows flew to
Capistrano. Approximately 3800
Trojan rooters and 9200 alums
are expected to trek to "Halo"
Alto, as they call it. Plus USC's
renowned 96-man marching band.
