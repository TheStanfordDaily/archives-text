Fewer floats will participate in

creased number is not due to apa
thy, according to Bob Faust,
Homecoming Committee chair
man. .
"The shortened parade," said
Faust, "can be accounted for by
the growing expense of float
building and the numerous con
flicting activities which take
place autumn quarter.
Suggestions
"Suggestions have been made
to Cardinals," continued Faust,
"to include Homecoming with Big
Game. This would make Stan
ford's Big Game Week similar tn
Dartmouth's Winter Carnival and
provide one really all-out occa
sion instead of a lot of little ac
tivities."
Floats participating in the pa
rade should be on their way to
the polo field by 5 p.m., according
to Dave Mitchell, mechanics
chairman.
"They must be in order and
ready to cross El Camino when
the highway patrol closes off the
highway to traffic," Davis said.

years, including Ed Mahoney and
Jim Walters, will lead their fa
vorite yells from the year when
each was yell leader.
The program will also feature
the Sigma Chi Travelers, Bill
Lund, Bill Wren and Dick Hall; a
miniature Big Game bonfire and
the yell leaders and song leaders
with new routines, including a
solo rendition by the song leaders
of "You've Got to Have Heart"
from "Damn Yankees."
Innovation
An innovation will be a large
fluorescent block "S" which will
introduce students to a new type
of card for card stunts.
Trophies for~-the best floats in
the parade will be awarded at the
same time on the basis of humor,
originality, execution, theme,
lower division, upper division and
grand sweepstakes.
Fewer floats will participate in
the parade this year, but the de
creased number is not due to apa
thy, according to Bob Faust,
Homecoming Committee chair
man. .
"The shortened parade," said
Faust, "can be accounted for by
the growing expense of float
building and the numerous con
flicting activities which take
place autumn quarter.
Suggestions
"Suggestions have been made
to Cardinals," continued Faust,
"to include Homecoming with Big
Game. This would make Stan
ford's Big Game Week similar tn
Dartmouth's Winter Carnival and
provide one really all-out occa
sion instead of a lot of little ac
tivities."
Floats participating in the pa
rade should be on their way to
the polo field by 5 p.m., according
to Dave Mitchell, mechanics
chairman.
"They must be in order and
ready to cross El Camino when
the highway patrol closes off the
highway to traffic," Davis said.
