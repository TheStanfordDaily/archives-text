Vote Discrepancy
Discrepancy in the totals of
votes shown here results from
the number of students voting
for Men's and Women's Councils
who did not vote for other offi
cers, and from the number of
void and unrecorded ballots.
Three candidates failed to turn
in expense sheets, and will be
fined accordingly said Mike Ser
lin. Elections Commission chair
man.
Candidates may pick up their
election photographs at the AS
SU office, Serlin said.
