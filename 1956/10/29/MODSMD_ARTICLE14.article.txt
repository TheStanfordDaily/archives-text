# Southern Cal Backs Stymied By Card Line
## Indian Ground Attack Matches Pass Game In Close Encounter 
### 
There's one less roadblock on
the Rose Bowl path today, but
looming behind the crushed in n I
er that once read "Unbeaten US' "
are four more big ones UCLA,
Oregon State, Washington and
California.
In beating the men of Troy
Saturday, 27-19, before 70,000 fan .
in Stanford Stadium, Chuck 'I ay
lor's Indians toppled the nation :,
sixth-ranked football team and
put themselves in the favorite' .
role for the upcoming run Ik the
roses.
It's a rough road, but Satur
day's performance indicated that
John Brodie and company have
the makings to go all the way
Trailing USC, 13-0, in the second
quarter, Stanford pulled itself off
the stadium floor, overcame the
deficit in the same quarter and
went on to smash USC and any
die-hard hopes for "revenge."
The Indians can't let down for
a minute. They'll face equally re
vengeful UCLA in Los Angeles
this coming Saturday and Oregon
State at home next week. The
experts tab State as the only seri
ous contender for the Indians'
Rose Bowl hopes.
Defense Overshifted
Saturday's victory can be cred
ited in a large measure to Taylor's
over-shifted defenses, which held
the charging twosome of Jon At
nett and C. R. Roberts about as
well as any defense could. Rob
erts, packing- a 10.3-yard-a-ca'rry
average until Saturday, came up
with a mere 'for him) average of
3.7 yards in 15 trips.
Arnett, although he turned ui
the game's top performance, aver
aged 4.6 yards, compared to his
usual 6.9.
Tackle Paul Wiggin played his
All-American role well. He con
stantly moved from his right
tackle slot to play in the left side
of the line, and toppled Trojans
frequently. Carl Isaacs," known
till Saturday as "good receiver,
but can be handled on defense,"
was outstanding on defense, as
well as turning in a great often
sive job from his end position.
Once again it was co - captain
Brodie whose quarterbacking led
the way. Brodie, nation's No I
passer, showed 'em a thing about
running as well. When his pass
patterns were spoiled, he let hi;
ends maneuver freely, then hit
the one in the open.
Hill Praises Brodie
Trojan Coach Jess Hill paid
tribute to Brodie after the game
He said simply, "There aren't
many passers who can do that "
The entire Indian effort wa ,
sparkling. Paul Camera grabbed
passes all over the field. Lou
Valli, A 1 Harringtofi, Doug Dick
and Gordy Young, to mention
some others, ran the Trojans into
the ground.
Ask Jon Arnett, who said: II
wasn't Stanford's passing that
hurt us so much. It was the run
ning that killed us."
Noel Robinson and Center t'o< h
Conklin led a charging Stanford
line.
