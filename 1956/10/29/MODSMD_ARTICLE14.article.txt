# Southern Cal Backs Stymied By Card Line
## Indian Ground Attack Matches Pass Game In Close Encounter 
### 
There's one less roadblock on
the Rose Bowl path today, but
looming behind the crushed in n I
er that once read "Unbeaten US' "
are four more big ones UCLA,
Oregon State, Washington and
California.
In beating the men of Troy
Saturday, 27-19, before 70,000 fan .
in Stanford Stadium, Chuck 'I ay
lor's Indians toppled the nation :,
sixth-ranked football team and
put themselves in the favorite' .
role for the upcoming run Ik the
roses.
It's a rough road, but Satur
day's performance indicated that
John Brodie and company have
the makings to go all the way
Trailing USC, 13-0, in the second
quarter, Stanford pulled itself off
the stadium floor, overcame the
deficit in the same quarter and
went on to smash USC and any
die-hard hopes for "revenge."
The Indians can't let down for
a minute. They'll face equally re
vengeful UCLA in Los Angeles
this coming Saturday and Oregon
State at home next week. The
experts tab State as the only seri
ous contender for the Indians'
Rose Bowl hopes.
Defense Overshifted
Saturday's victory can be cred
ited in a large measure to Taylor's
over-shifted defenses, which held
the charging twosome of Jon At
nett and C. R. Roberts about as
well as any defense could. Rob
erts, packing- a 10.3-yard-a-ca'rry
average until Saturday, came up
with a mere 'for him) average of
3.7 yards in 15 trips.
Arnett, although he turned ui
the game's top performance, aver
aged 4.6 yards, compared to his
usual 6.9.
Tackle Paul Wiggin played his
All-American role well. He con
stantly moved from his right
tackle slot to play in the left side
of the line, and toppled Trojans
frequently. Carl Isaacs," known
till Saturday as "good receiver,
but can be handled on defense,"
was outstanding on defense, as
well as turning in a great often
sive job from his end position.
Once again it was co - captain
Brodie whose quarterbacking led
the way. Brodie, nation's No I
passer, showed 'em a thing about
running as well. When his pass
patterns were spoiled, he let hi;
ends maneuver freely, then hit
the one in the open.
Hill Praises Brodie
Trojan Coach Jess Hill paid
tribute to Brodie after the game
He said simply, "There aren't
many passers who can do that "
The entire Indian effort wa ,
sparkling. Paul Camera grabbed
passes all over the field. Lou
Valli, A 1 Harringtofi, Doug Dick
and Gordy Young, to mention
some others, ran the Trojans into
the ground.
Ask Jon Arnett, who said: II
wasn't Stanford's passing that
hurt us so much. It was the run
ning that killed us."
Noel Robinson and Center t'o< h
Conklin led a charging Stanford
line.
Things looked fairly hopetc
for Stanford 2% minutes into the
second quarter. Trojan End Bob
Voiles had grabbed in a Frank
Hall aerial for 14 yards and a
touchdown, and Arnett had added
another touchdown on a 2-yard
plunge. The conversion made it
13-0, USC.
Roberts and Arnett had been
galloping for sizeable chunks of
yardage and it looked as if they
were going to keep it up:
But, less than three minutes
later, Stanford was on the score
board with 7 points. From his
own 47, Fullback Doug Dick, fast
est man on the squad, scampered
past left end for 0 yards, then 9
more. Then Harrington went for
8 on a pitch-out.
Then the payoff play: From
the USC 30, Brodie wheeled back,
spotted sophomore end Ben Rob
inson on the 2 and let fly. Robin
son stepped over the goal line
with Halfback Ernie Zampe.se
trailing. Mickey Raftery con
verted.
With three minutes left in the
half, the Indians chalked up a
lead they were never to relin
quish. Brodie sneaked over from

0 inches out, following Russ
Steele's recovery of a Trojan fum
ble on the USC 20.
Reserve quarterback Jack Tay
lor converted; 14-13, Stanford.
On the last play of the first
half it looked like the Trojans had
pulled ahead. In the waning sec
onds Hall hit Hillard Hill in the
end zone, but the play was nulli
fied on a baekfield-in-motion pen
alty.
The infraction was called on
Arnett, who told the field judge
he hadn't been in motion. Coach
Hill joined the argument, throw
ing his hat to the field.
All Jess got for his trouble was
a warning to "get off the field and
join your team."
Two minutes into the second
half the Indians did it again. Valli
returned a USC punt 28 yards to
the Trojan 40. Then Young bul
leted up center for 17 yards.
From the 23 Brodie hit Isaacs
in the right corner of the end
zone. He was all alone.
The Trojans reacted quickly.
They pulled up within two points,
19-21, on a sustained 67-yard drive,
Halfback Don Hickman scoring.

Arnett's PAT attempt was
blocked.
With victory solidly in their
grasp, the Indians added another
score in the waning seconds of
play, a Douglas to Chuck Shea
pass for 8 yards and the score.
The Trojans came out of the
game with no injuries. But the
Indians lost Guard Donn Carswell
for three weeks on a serious knee
injury.

In beating the men of Troy
Saturday, 27-19, before 70,000 fan .
in Stanford Stadium, Chuck 'I ay
lor's Indians toppled the nation :,
sixth-ranked football team and
put themselves in the favorite' .
role for the upcoming run Ik the
roses.
It's a rough road, but Satur
day's performance indicated that
John Brodie and company have
the makings to go all the way
Trailing USC, 13-0, in the second
quarter, Stanford pulled itself off
the stadium floor, overcame the
deficit in the same quarter and
went on to smash USC and any
die-hard hopes for "revenge."
The Indians can't let down for
a minute. They'll face equally re
vengeful UCLA in Los Angeles
this coming Saturday and Oregon
State at home next week. The
experts tab State as the only seri
ous contender for the Indians'
Rose Bowl hopes.
Defense Overshifted
Saturday's victory can be cred
ited in a large measure to Taylor's
over-shifted defenses, which held
the charging twosome of Jon At
nett and C. R. Roberts about as
well as any defense could. Rob
erts, packing- a 10.3-yard-a-ca'rry
average until Saturday, came up
with a mere 'for him) average of
3.7 yards in 15 trips.
Arnett, although he turned ui
the game's top performance, aver
aged 4.6 yards, compared to his
usual 6.9.
Tackle Paul Wiggin played his
All-American role well. He con
stantly moved from his right
tackle slot to play in the left side
of the line, and toppled Trojans
frequently. Carl Isaacs," known
till Saturday as "good receiver,
but can be handled on defense,"
was outstanding on defense, as
well as turning in a great often
sive job from his end position.
Once again it was co - captain
Brodie whose quarterbacking led
the way. Brodie, nation's No I
passer, showed 'em a thing about
running as well. When his pass
patterns were spoiled, he let hi;
ends maneuver freely, then hit
the one in the open.
Hill Praises Brodie
Trojan Coach Jess Hill paid
tribute to Brodie after the game
He said simply, "There aren't
many passers who can do that "
The entire Indian effort wa ,
sparkling. Paul Camera grabbed
passes all over the field. Lou
Valli, A 1 Harringtofi, Doug Dick
and Gordy Young, to mention
some others, ran the Trojans into
the ground.
Ask Jon Arnett, who said: II
wasn't Stanford's passing that
hurt us so much. It was the run
ning that killed us."
Noel Robinson and Center t'o< h
Conklin led a charging Stanford
line.
Things looked fairly hopetc
for Stanford 2% minutes into the
second quarter. Trojan End Bob
Voiles had grabbed in a Frank
Hall aerial for 14 yards and a
touchdown, and Arnett had added
another touchdown on a 2-yard
plunge. The conversion made it
13-0, USC.
Roberts and Arnett had been
galloping for sizeable chunks of
yardage and it looked as if they
were going to keep it up:
But, less than three minutes
later, Stanford was on the score
board with 7 points. From his
own 47, Fullback Doug Dick, fast
est man on the squad, scampered
past left end for 0 yards, then 9
more. Then Harrington went for
8 on a pitch-out.
Then the payoff play: From
the USC 30, Brodie wheeled back,
spotted sophomore end Ben Rob
inson on the 2 and let fly. Robin
son stepped over the goal line
with Halfback Ernie Zampe.se
trailing. Mickey Raftery con
verted.
With three minutes left in the
half, the Indians chalked up a
lead they were never to relin
quish. Brodie sneaked over from

0 inches out, following Russ
Steele's recovery of a Trojan fum
ble on the USC 20.
Reserve quarterback Jack Tay
lor converted; 14-13, Stanford.
On the last play of the first
half it looked like the Trojans had
pulled ahead. In the waning sec
onds Hall hit Hillard Hill in the
end zone, but the play was nulli
fied on a baekfield-in-motion pen
alty.
The infraction was called on
Arnett, who told the field judge
he hadn't been in motion. Coach
Hill joined the argument, throw
ing his hat to the field.
All Jess got for his trouble was
a warning to "get off the field and
join your team."
Two minutes into the second
half the Indians did it again. Valli
returned a USC punt 28 yards to
the Trojan 40. Then Young bul
leted up center for 17 yards.
From the 23 Brodie hit Isaacs
in the right corner of the end
zone. He was all alone.
The Trojans reacted quickly.
They pulled up within two points,
19-21, on a sustained 67-yard drive,
Halfback Don Hickman scoring.

Arnett's PAT attempt was
blocked.
With victory solidly in their
grasp, the Indians added another
score in the waning seconds of
play, a Douglas to Chuck Shea
pass for 8 yards and the score.
The Trojans came out of the
game with no injuries. But the
Indians lost Guard Donn Carswell
for three weeks on a serious knee
injury.

In beating the men of Troy
Saturday, 27-19, before 70,000 fan .
in Stanford Stadium, Chuck 'I ay

sixth-ranked football team and
put themselves in the favorite' .
role for the upcoming run Ik the
roses.
It's a rough road, but Satur
day's performance indicated that
John Brodie and company have
the makings to go all the way
Trailing USC, 13-0, in the second
quarter, Stanford pulled itself off
the stadium floor, overcame the
deficit in the same quarter and
went on to smash USC and any
die-hard hopes for "revenge."
The Indians can't let down for
a minute. They'll face equally re
vengeful UCLA in Los Angeles
this coming Saturday and Oregon

Rose Bowl hopes.
Defense Overshifted
Saturday's victory can be cred
ited in a large measure to Taylor's
over-shifted defenses, which held
the charging twosome of Jon At
nett and C. R. Roberts about as
well as any defense could. Rob
erts, packing- a 10.3-yard-a-ca'rry
average until Saturday, came up
with a mere 'for him) average of
3.7 yards in 15 trips.
Arnett, although he turned ui
the game's top performance, aver
aged 4.6 yards, compared to his
usual 6.9.
Tackle Paul Wiggin played his
All-American role well. He con
stantly moved from his right
tackle slot to play in the left side
of the line, and toppled Trojans
frequently. Carl Isaacs," known
till Saturday as "good receiver,
but can be handled on defense,"
was outstanding on defense, as
well as turning in a great often
sive job from his end position.
Once again it was co - captain
Brodie whose quarterbacking led
the way. Brodie, nation's No I
passer, showed 'em a thing about
running as well. When his pass
patterns were spoiled, he let hi;
ends maneuver freely, then hit
the one in the open.
Hill Praises Brodie
Trojan Coach Jess Hill paid
tribute to Brodie after the game
He said simply, "There aren't
many passers who can do that "
The entire Indian effort wa ,
sparkling. Paul Camera grabbed
passes all over the field. Lou
Valli, A 1 Harringtofi, Doug Dick
and Gordy Young, to mention
some others, ran the Trojans into
the ground.
Ask Jon Arnett, who said: II
wasn't Stanford's passing that
hurt us so much. It was the run
ning that killed us."
Noel Robinson and Center t'o< h
Conklin led a charging Stanford
line.
Things looked fairly hopetc
for Stanford 2% minutes into the
second quarter. Trojan End Bob
Voiles had grabbed in a Frank
Hall aerial for 14 yards and a
touchdown, and Arnett had added
another touchdown on a 2-yard
plunge. The conversion made it
13-0, USC.
Roberts and Arnett had been
galloping for sizeable chunks of
yardage and it looked as if they
were going to keep it up:
But, less than three minutes
later, Stanford was on the score
board with 7 points. From his
own 47, Fullback Doug Dick, fast
est man on the squad, scampered
past left end for 0 yards, then 9
more. Then Harrington went for
8 on a pitch-out.
Then the payoff play: From
the USC 30, Brodie wheeled back,
spotted sophomore end Ben Rob
inson on the 2 and let fly. Robin
son stepped over the goal line
with Halfback Ernie Zampe.se
trailing. Mickey Raftery con
verted.
With three minutes left in the
half, the Indians chalked up a
lead they were never to relin
quish. Brodie sneaked over from

0 inches out, following Russ
Steele's recovery of a Trojan fum
ble on the USC 20.
Reserve quarterback Jack Tay
lor converted; 14-13, Stanford.
On the last play of the first
half it looked like the Trojans had
pulled ahead. In the waning sec
onds Hall hit Hillard Hill in the
end zone, but the play was nulli
fied on a baekfield-in-motion pen
alty.
The infraction was called on
Arnett, who told the field judge
he hadn't been in motion. Coach
Hill joined the argument, throw
ing his hat to the field.
All Jess got for his trouble was
a warning to "get off the field and
join your team."
Two minutes into the second
half the Indians did it again. Valli
returned a USC punt 28 yards to
the Trojan 40. Then Young bul
leted up center for 17 yards.
From the 23 Brodie hit Isaacs
in the right corner of the end
zone. He was all alone.
The Trojans reacted quickly.
They pulled up within two points,

All Jess got for his trouble was
a warning to "get off the field and
join your team."

NOBLIiST TROJaN —Shifty Jon Arnett streaks
through the left side of Stanford's line for 10
yards in the first quarter of Stanford's 27-19 vic
tory over USC. The run gave the Men of Troy
a first down inside Stanford's 25. Southern Cal

bogged down four plays later. Indian gridders
are Troy Barbee (71), Bob Long (54), Gary Van
Galder (8(?) and Paul Wiggin (79). Frank Fio

There's one less roadblock on
the Rose Bowl path today, but
looming behind the crushed in n I
er that once read "Unbeaten US' "
are four more big ones UCLA,
Oregon State, Washington and
California.
In beating the men of Troy
Saturday, 27-19, before 70,000 fan .
in Stanford Stadium, Chuck 'I ay
lor's Indians toppled the nation :,
sixth-ranked football team and
put themselves in the favorite' .
role for the upcoming run Ik the
roses.
It's a rough road, but Satur
day's performance indicated that
John Brodie and company have
the makings to go all the way
Trailing USC, 13-0, in the second
quarter, Stanford pulled itself off
the stadium floor, overcame the
deficit in the same quarter and
went on to smash USC and any
die-hard hopes for "revenge."
The Indians can't let down for
a minute. They'll face equally re
vengeful UCLA in Los Angeles
this coming Saturday and Oregon
State at home next week. The
experts tab State as the only seri
ous contender for the Indians'
Rose Bowl hopes.
Defense Overshifted
Saturday's victory can be cred
ited in a large measure to Taylor's
over-shifted defenses, which held
the charging twosome of Jon At
nett and C. R. Roberts about as
well as any defense could. Rob
erts, packing- a 10.3-yard-a-ca'rry
average until Saturday, came up
with a mere 'for him) average of
3.7 yards in 15 trips.
Arnett, although he turned ui
the game's top performance, aver
aged 4.6 yards, compared to his
usual 6.9.
Tackle Paul Wiggin played his
All-American role well. He con
stantly moved from his right
tackle slot to play in the left side
of the line, and toppled Trojans
frequently. Carl Isaacs," known
till Saturday as "good receiver,
but can be handled on defense,"
was outstanding on defense, as
well as turning in a great often
sive job from his end position.
Once again it was co - captain
Brodie whose quarterbacking led
the way. Brodie, nation's No I
passer, showed 'em a thing about
running as well. When his pass
patterns were spoiled, he let hi;
ends maneuver freely, then hit
the one in the open.
Hill Praises Brodie
Trojan Coach Jess Hill paid
tribute to Brodie after the game
He said simply, "There aren't
many passers who can do that "
The entire Indian effort wa ,
sparkling. Paul Camera grabbed
passes all over the field. Lou
Valli, A 1 Harringtofi, Doug Dick
and Gordy Young, to mention
some others, ran the Trojans into
the ground.
Ask Jon Arnett, who said: II
wasn't Stanford's passing that
hurt us so much. It was the run
ning that killed us."
Noel Robinson and Center t'o< h
Conklin led a charging Stanford
line.
Things looked fairly hopetc
for Stanford 2% minutes into the
second quarter. Trojan End Bob
Voiles had grabbed in a Frank
Hall aerial for 14 yards and a
touchdown, and Arnett had added
another touchdown on a 2-yard
plunge. The conversion made it
13-0, USC.
Roberts and Arnett had been
galloping for sizeable chunks of
yardage and it looked as if they
were going to keep it up:
But, less than three minutes
later, Stanford was on the score
board with 7 points. From his
own 47, Fullback Doug Dick, fast
est man on the squad, scampered
past left end for 0 yards, then 9
more. Then Harrington went for
8 on a pitch-out.
Then the payoff play: From
the USC 30, Brodie wheeled back,
spotted sophomore end Ben Rob
inson on the 2 and let fly. Robin
son stepped over the goal line
with Halfback Ernie Zampe.se
trailing. Mickey Raftery con
verted.
With three minutes left in the
half, the Indians chalked up a
lead they were never to relin
quish. Brodie sneaked over from

0 inches out, following Russ
Steele's recovery of a Trojan fum
ble on the USC 20.
Reserve quarterback Jack Tay
lor converted; 14-13, Stanford.
On the last play of the first
half it looked like the Trojans had
pulled ahead. In the waning sec
onds Hall hit Hillard Hill in the
end zone, but the play was nulli
fied on a baekfield-in-motion pen
alty.
The infraction was called on
Arnett, who told the field judge
he hadn't been in motion. Coach
Hill joined the argument, throw
ing his hat to the field.
All Jess got for his trouble was
a warning to "get off the field and
join your team."
Two minutes into the second
half the Indians did it again. Valli
returned a USC punt 28 yards to
the Trojan 40. Then Young bul
leted up center for 17 yards.
From the 23 Brodie hit Isaacs
in the right corner of the end
zone. He was all alone.
The Trojans reacted quickly.
They pulled up within two points,

The Trojans came out of the
game with no injuries. But the
