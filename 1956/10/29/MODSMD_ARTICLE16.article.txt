# Floats--An Outworn Tradition
## 
### 
It was an EXCELLENT week end. We downed
the Trojans, the fans on both sides hehaved
quite admirably, the Axe was returned.
But there was one exception to the general
excellence—Friday night's Homecoming float
parade. The parade itself was no worse than
usual despite the drizzle, hut the money and
hours of work involved show another side to
the story.
Each float was the product of hours of labor;
not jnst volunteer effort, but in many cases it
represented work coerced from students by
threat of fines.
The cost of the individual float was theoreti
cally not more than $200 —not prohibitive if
the group is large enough, but still a strain on
some students, especially when it has to he col
lected by levy. Often work or fines are forced
on students who just happen to reside in the
living group and simply don't care about who
wins the sweepstakes.
And the results of this flurry of preparation,
financial and otherwise? About one hour of

Friday night entertainment and the pleasure
of seeing the winning floats dragged around the
stadium Saturday afternoon.
The people of Palo Alto eertainly appreciate
the hour of entertainment, hut, judging from
this year's attendance, Stanford students don't.
Only a few students were there and those few
weren't wildly enthusiastic.
Perhaps the students, alumni and guests at
the game enjoyed the procession of rather he
draggled floats at halftime, hut it's douhtful
that their enjoyment was enough to warrant
the time and expense involved in making the
floats.
One excuse for the float parade is that we
need it to welcome the alumni who flock hack
for the USC or UCLA game each year.
Even this excuse for its existence isn't valid.
A fairly large group of alumni appeared for
the game, hut certainly a much larger alumni
contingent appears for the Big Game.
All things considered, there is little reason
for the continued existence of ho useless a
tradition.
