# No Audience at Stanford
## 
### 
Judging from the amount of political interest
tin this campus during the final push for the
Nov. 6 elections, one might think elections were
being held in Afghanistan rather than the
United States.
Last week not more than 15 students ap
peared to hear a congressional candidate speak
ing in Cubberley, and attendance at other po
litical functions has been equally uninspiring.
To date The Daily has received only one letter
of a political nature.
We recognize that it's a fairly slow, low-gear
campaign with no dynamic national issue to
captivate the voters" attention, but we rather
wonder il Stanford students aren't missing an
important part of their education when they
snidely jeer at the political "redhots" and pass
off campaign verbalizing as a lot of garbage.
Although much of he emotionalism of the
*.">2 campaign is missing, the issues at stake are
as important, if not more so. But from the

group one might export to ferret out and debate
the political issues of the day, we hear nary a
whimper. A quick glance at the morning's
headlines and a passing comment of "Who ya
going to vote for?" are the general campus
response to the hue and cry of Eisenhower
and Stevenson.
This week, on Tuesday and Thursday re
spectively, Richard Richards, Democratic sena
torial candidate, and (iharles (iubser, Republi
can congressional candidate, are speaking on
campus; the"Letters" column in The Daily is
always open. We hope the turnout for both
is better than it has been in the past.
Maybe Stanford is mirroring the 1956 atti
tude toward American politics, maybe a de
crease in the amount of emotionalism and party
do -or-die emphasis is good, but we question the
productivity or merit of a university campus
exhibiting a total lack of interest in the rela
tive direction our country will have in the next
four vears.
