# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Earl Cilley
## Halloween, Then UCLA Trek 
### 
The tilt Saturday in the stadium came out pretty well, and the
big thing this w<*ek is to get in shape for the trek south to UCLA,
where rumor has it that the Southland Gang will say it with fire
hoses. Looks like dressy sport with raincoats and water pistol ac
cessories.
# » #
To start the week off with a whisper, the Astronomy Club will
take a searching look at problems connected with local observation
techniques tonight in Room 380 (Physics Corner), at 8:30. It's free
from fee, and lhat's about all that can be said.
« # *
On the local political hustings this week will be representatives of
both major parties. Tuesday noon it's Richard Richards, Democratic
candidate for the Senate, speaking at Theta Chi, and Thursday night
Charles Gubser, Republican candidate for Congressman from this
district, will orate in Cubberley at 7:30. The fact that the big spend
ers from tlie East are betting Ike 8-5 doesn't mean that the solon
seats are in the bag, so if you plan on casting a ballot this time,
rnaybe you ought to go give a listen.

Tuesday night is free flicks night at Mem Aud, with the Tuesday
Evening Series sponsoring a lecture accompanied by a Japanese color
