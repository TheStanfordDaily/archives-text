# Papoose Eleven Smashes Southern Cal Frosh, 36-13
## Jim Honeywell and Sid Garber Pace Frosh In Season Opener for Highly Hated Squad 
### Bob Payne 
Rolling up an overwhelming total of 503 yards offensively, the
Stanford freshmen opened their 1956 season with a smashing 30-13
victory over the Southern California yearlings Saturday.
The much-heralded Papoose squad, and fullback Jim Honeywell
in particular, lived up to fondest expectations as it struck on the

ground and through the air with
crushing might. Honeywell, a
highly touted high schooler last
season, was the workhorse of a
powerful ground attack, rolling
up 139 yards in 17 cracks for an
8.2 average.
Quarterback Sid Garber added
life to the attack by completing
12 of 22 passes for 130 yards.
It might have been a runaway
shutout for Stanford except for
the efforts of a speedy Trobabe
halfback named Jack Holman.
Holman streaked 58 yards with a
swing pass late in the second pe
riod to set up the first USC touch
down.
On the same pattern in the
third quarter, Holman went 59
yards to score. Trobabe quarter
back wasn't quite a left-handed
image of brother John, complet
ing seven of 18 passes, but for 170
yards,
Wylie Romps
Mac Wylie and Pete Fitzger
ald were able assistants to Honey
well in tearing up the SC de
fenses. Twice Honeywell and
Wylie almost single-handedly car
ried the Papoose* to pay dirt.
In the first period, the pair
packed the leather on eight of the
ten plays in a 73-yard drive for
Stanford's opening touchdown.
In the fourth quarter, they car
ried on 11 of 13 plays in a 60-yard
scoring offensive.
Fitzgerald, second-string full
back, illustrated the overall depth
of the frosh squad by racking up
02 yards in nine carries. He
spearheaded a second • quarter
march to Stanford's second score,
climaxing it with a two-yard
plunge to pay dirt.
Air Attack Strong 1
Not to be forgotten in the
midst of all the ground power
was the Papoose aerial attack.
Starting ends Jerry Winters and
Chris Burford latched on to four
and three passes, respectively.
Burford took a 31-yarder from
Garber for the Cards' third touch
down.
The Papoose line handled the
mammoth Trobabes with little
trouble. Outstanding were tackle
Ron Fernandes at 192 a midget
to some SC forwards; guard Ray
Harrington, who rudely stole the
ball from a stunned Brodie in the
third quarter, and hard-working
center Bill Stivers.

trouble. Outstanding were tackle
Ron Fernandes at 192 a midget
to some SC forwards; guard Ray
Harrington, who rudely stole the
ball from a stunned Brodie in the
third quarter, and hard-working
center Bill Stivers.
* Scoring summary:
Southern Cal ... 0 0 7 o—l30 —13
Stanford frosh .. 7 9 7 13—36
SC scoring: Touchdowns—Bro
die (2, sneak), Holman (59, pass
run from Brodie). PAT—Chalk
(placement).
Stanford scoring: Touchdowns
— Garber 2 (7, run; 1, sneak),
Fitzgerald (2, plunge), Burford

Reid 3, Bond (placements).
Rolling up an overwhelming total of 503 yards offensively, the
Stanford freshmen opened their 1956 season with a smashing 30-13
victory over the Southern California yearlings Saturday.
The much-heralded Papoose squad, and fullback Jim Honeywell
in particular, lived up to fondest expectations as it struck on the

ground and through the air with
crushing might. Honeywell, a
highly touted high schooler last
season, was the workhorse of a
powerful ground attack, rolling
up 139 yards in 17 cracks for an
8.2 average.
Quarterback Sid Garber added
life to the attack by completing
12 of 22 passes for 130 yards.
It might have been a runaway
shutout for Stanford except for
the efforts of a speedy Trobabe
halfback named Jack Holman.
Holman streaked 58 yards with a
swing pass late in the second pe
riod to set up the first USC touch
down.
On the same pattern in the
third quarter, Holman went 59
yards to score. Trobabe quarter
back wasn't quite a left-handed
image of brother John, complet
ing seven of 18 passes, but for 170
yards,
Wylie Romps
Mac Wylie and Pete Fitzger
ald were able assistants to Honey
well in tearing up the SC de
fenses. Twice Honeywell and
Wylie almost single-handedly car
ried the Papoose* to pay dirt.
In the first period, the pair
packed the leather on eight of the
ten plays in a 73-yard drive for
Stanford's opening touchdown.
In the fourth quarter, they car
ried on 11 of 13 plays in a 60-yard
scoring offensive.
Fitzgerald, second-string full
back, illustrated the overall depth
of the frosh squad by racking up
02 yards in nine carries. He
spearheaded a second • quarter
march to Stanford's second score,
climaxing it with a two-yard
plunge to pay dirt.
Air Attack Strong 1
Not to be forgotten in the
midst of all the ground power
was the Papoose aerial attack.
Starting ends Jerry Winters and
Chris Burford latched on to four
and three passes, respectively.
Burford took a 31-yarder from
Garber for the Cards' third touch
down.
The Papoose line handled the
mammoth Trobabes with little
