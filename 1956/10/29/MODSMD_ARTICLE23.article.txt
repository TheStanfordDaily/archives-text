# Dons Topple Card Hooters By 5-2 Margin
## 
### 
The University of San Fran
cisco soccer team was as good as
its reputation and a little bit too
good for Stanford in a rough and
high-scoring game here Saturday
which saw USF ending up on top
5-2.
The opening minutes of the
first quarter were perhaps the j
most important in the whole
game as the Dons put in two
quick goals and took a lead which
Stanford was never able to catch.
Inside left Razon, who was out
standing for USF throughout the
game, scored on a fine rolling
shot at 7:30 and a minute later
inside right Calonje tipped a high
lobbing pass by goalie Ditman.
The second quarter belonged to j
Stanford, however, and the Cards ]
had USF on the run when Mike
Asafo â€¢ Boakyne took Avary's
cross and with professional calm
picked his spot and slammed the
ball into the net. A little later,
the Dons' Obi scored off a throw
in to make the score 3-1 at half
time.
In the second half A vary scored
for Stanford with a fine left-foot
ed shot and Razon put in his sec
ond for USF. Obi closed the
scoring with a fantastic goal off
a free kick from 35 yards.
After the game Coach Fred
Priddle said that in spite of the
loss he was pleased with the way
Stanford played and predicted
the Cards would do well in the
rest of its conference schedule.
He praised Peter Mack for his ef
fective covering of Obi, Bill Dit
man for his 20 saves, and half
backs John Leonard and Jim
Bowditch for their generally fine
play.
