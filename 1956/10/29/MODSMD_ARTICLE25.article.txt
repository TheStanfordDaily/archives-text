# SEASON STILL YOUNG
## Tribe Quiet After Win 
### Dean Stewart 
In the locker room immediately
after the game Saint Chuck's
band of sweating angels un
pinned their wings, tossed their
halos aside and raised a little Hell
of their own.
Chaos didn't reign supreme as
you might imagine, foi the team
realized the season wasn't over
yet and there was talk of UCLA
and Oregon State.
Most of the players were too
tired to fully grasp the impor
tance of their win. After working
so long against the odds for this
—the big one—it was only natu
ral that these physically exhaust
ed athletes would have to relax
and reflect a while before this
hard - fought, longed-for victory
could be appreciated to the ut
most.
Young's Only Fumble
Perhaps the likeable, red-head
ed halfback Gordy Young best
expressed the thoughts of play
ers drunk with happiness and ex
haustion. He was fumbling witli
a simple knot in the lacing of his
shoulder pads which must have
taken him a full 10 minutes tc
untie when we asked him for s
comment we could print. Grin
ning even more, he said.
"Boy, oh boy. We just got 'em
That's all. We really got 'em."
About that time All-Ameriear
t ackle Paul W i g g i n ' s huge
frame filled the locker room door
way. He was the true picture o]
a conquering hero. His helmel
was pushed way back on his
head, a big smile exposed a miss
ing tooth, and the game ball was
tucked securely under his arm.
Wiggin Happy
After a few unprintable words
to John Brodie he made his waj
to a bench in the back part of the
room and slowly peeled off hi. 1
armor. We trailed him back then
and asked for a comment.
"There's not much I can sav

I I'm just the happiest guy in the
world."
After a few moments he
poured forth the many thoughts
that just had to come out.
"The team really hung togeth
er. didn't they? They were great,
just great. Everyone was great.
And our coaching staff deserves
as much credit as the team does.
I know I don't have anything to
compare them with and I'm prob
ably prejudiced but I just don't
see how any group of coaches
J could be any better."
Douglas Clinches Game
Quarterback Jack D o u g 1 a s ,
Brodie's understudy, was one of
the happiest guys in the room.
Just to get into the game was all
he had probably hoped for. but to
get in and pass for Stanford's
final six points was more than he
j had dreamed of.
"I called a sweep play," said
! Douglas in explanation. "It was
an optional pass-run play. I told
the team I was going to run it.
and I intended to. But when I
saw him (Chuck Shea) so wide
open I just had to throw it."
