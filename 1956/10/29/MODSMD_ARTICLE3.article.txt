# Hungarian Officials Announce Major Concessions to Rebels
## Fighting Eases as Insurgent Demands Met; Russ Troops Reported Starting Withdrawal 
### 
VIENNA, Oct: 28 (UP)—The government announced now, sweep
ing concessions to Hungarian rebels today, including immediate with
drawal of Russian troops from Budapest. Independent reports from
inside the fire- and bullet-scarred capital said "fighting appears to be
gradually coming to an end."
An eyewitness report said the Communist government has "real-

ized at last that the insurgents I
will not surrender to Russian
troops."
Premier Imre Nagy announced
at 5:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. PST) that
Russian forces have "started to
withdraw" from Budapest, and
promised immediate negotiations
on "equal" terms with Russia for
withdrawal of all Soviet troops
from Hungary.
He also promised to abolish the
Hungarian secret police force.
Rut the sound of gunfire still
echoed in Budapest. The eyewit
ness reports told of heavy shoot
ing ih Moscow Square at 4 a.m.
and alternately sporadic and
heavy small arms fire after 8 a.m.
For the first time, the govern
ment admitted that virtually all
the people were on the rebel side.
There still was no indication of
a unified rebel command, but the
rebels appeared setting them
selves up in tight political groups.
A workers' council was estab
lished at Gyoer, northwest of Bu
dapest and a major industrial city.
A spokesman for the council
told United Press Staff Corre
spondent Kurt Neubauer in the
city That the rebels had four de
mands:
• Establishment of a Western
type democracy.
• Free formation of political
parties of all beliefs.
• Free elections.
• Armistice and withdrawal of
! all Russian troops.
Other rebel groups established
in other cities were broadcasting
demands for removal of Nagy and
a "return to capitalism."
Rebel headquarters at Gyoer
told Nagy by telephone that anti-
Communist forces would march
on Budapest if Ihe government
did not order withdrawal of all
Soviet forces from Hungary.
Whether the rebels, holding 10
of Hungary's 2o provinces and
fighting stubbornly on from fac
' lory buildings, streets and house
tops in Budapest, would accept
( anything short of surrender re
j mained an open question. Nagy
j gave no indication that his Com
| munist government intended to
I quit.
Nagy accepted offers of emer
gency food and medical supplies
from the United States, Russia,
Switzerland and the International
Red Cross.
Here in Vienna the outside
world received its first indications
the rebels are operating an air
force. A twin-engined aircraft
landed at Vienna's Central Air
i port to pick up urgently-needed
blood plasma and other medical
supplies. The plane was a double
DC-3 Dakota, flown by "members
| of the Hungarian Nationalist
, forces."
Diplomatic dispatches to Lon
don told of Soviet reinforcements
I arriving from Romania and Rus
sia. However, they apparently had
arrived prior to Nagy's statement.
| Some already were reported in
hospitals after skirmishes with
i rebel forces.


REBELS ARE MASSING —Bodies of some of the 70 persons re
ported killed in a clash with Red troops are shown outside the
town hospital at Magyar Ovar, Hungary. Shooting started when
insurgents hauled down the huge Red stars that topped the AVI!
(secret police) barracks near Magar Over, Hungarian border town
IX miles from the Austrian border checkpoint at Nickelsdort.
