# General Studies Plan Changes Undergraduate Study Program
## Accredited Activities to Be Substituted for P.E.; Frosh Only Class Affected by New System 
### 
Stanford's "new look" undergraduate schedule, officially entitled
General Studies Program, introduces this year a complete reorgani
zation of undergraduate work and the specified times for such work
to be completed.
One of the features of this program, which currently applies only

to freshmen, is the activity credit i
system.
Basically, the plan is designed |
to help students find an activity
of a vocational or recreational
merit without the pressure of
time.
In the past, all lower-division
students were required to take six
quarters of physical education,
with credit toward graduation be
ing given. Unit credit toward
graduation was not given.
Credit Substitution
Now entering freshmen may
substitute four of these credits
with an accredited activity, but
are still required to take two quar
ters of physical education.
Each of the remaining physical
education units must be taken,
one each year, for the first two
years in college. The other activity
credits may be taken any time
during the first two years, with
no more than two such units per
quarter.
Activities for which credit is
given must be approved by the
Committee on General Studies.
Currently accredited University
activities include Sequoia, the
Quad, The Daily, Stanford Con
cert Series, Legislature, Men's
Council, Women's Council, Cho
rus, Orchestra, Band, and Speech
and Drama Department produc
tions. Choir may apply if the
student makes special arrange
ments.
ROTC Enrollment
ROTC enrollment may bo sub
stituted for any or all of this re
quirement.
The purpose of this schedule,
according to General Studies Com
mittee Chairman Robert A. Walk
er, is to give the students time to
develop an activity in keeping
with the University's aims of vo
cational and recreational activi
ties of a cultural nature.
