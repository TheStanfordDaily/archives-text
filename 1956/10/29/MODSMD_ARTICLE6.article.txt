# Axe Returns for Run To Roses --It's One Down, Four To Go
## 'The Unknown' Leaves Trophy In Star's Auto Brodie Regains Prize Before Trojan Battle —Gone Since June 13 
### 
Stanford's Axe has reappeared.
Stolen from its supposedly bul
let-proof, steal-proof case in the
Cellar June 13, the Axe was dis
covered by football co - captain
John Brodie lying on the seat of
his car 'Saturday morning in
front of the President Hotel in
Palo Altn
Attached to the Axe was a note
which said, "From the unknown."
Brodie put the Axe in the trunk
of his car where it lay all morn
ing until he suited up for the
game. It was locked up in co-cap
tain Paul Wiggin's locker while
the team was getting ready.
Meanwhile head cheerleader
Bill Duke was notu'ied of the
Axe's appearance and it was ar
ranged that Brodie and Wiggin
present it to the cheering section
just before the start of the game.
After showing it to the cheer
ing section, Duke turned the Axe
over to Rally Committee chair
man Bill Lackey who locked it in
the trunk of his car for the dura
tion of the game.
After the game ended Lackey's
car with the Axe in the trunk, un
beknownst to the other occu
pants, wended its way through
the crowds to the Alpha Sig
house where Lackey kept it until
Duke came over.
Duke and Lackey then took the
Axe over to Menlo Park where
"it was hidden."
Nothing is known as yet about
where the Axe lay for the past
four months. Every time it has
disappeared it has invariably
turned up before the Big Game.
It was removed from its last rest
ing place by the use of a blow
torch on the bullet-proof glass.
It is rumored that Duke intends
to place the Axe in a bank vault
this morning until a "sure-fire
steal-proof" case can be con
structed to hold it. Duke himself
was not available for comment on
future plans for the Axe.


PROSTRATE PAUL — Halfback Paul Camera
pulls in a John Brodie pass with a diving, rolling
catch in the second quarter of Saturday's game.
The completion, good for 7 yards, was the first

play of Stanford's 75-yard drive to their initial
touchdown. Defending unsuccessfully is Trojan
End Chuck Leimbach. Brodie completed 10 of 21
pass attempts in spite of a hard-charging line.
