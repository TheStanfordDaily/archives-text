# USC 'Sour-Grapes Crusade' Falls Flat--With Official Assist
## Trojan-Indian Fighting Stays on Gridiron Floor; SC Students Are Warned to 'Take It Like Men' 
### Dick Meister 
USC-Stanford battling remained
within the confines of the grid
iron Saturday, cries of revenge to
the contrary.
Die-hard newspaper columnists,
disgruntled old grads and rah-rah
subway alums saw t heir self
styled crusade for Trojan revenge
die, 27-19. Their anticipations of
student feuding between the le
gions of the "pure and the pro
fane" failed to materialize as jam
packed rooting sections on both
sides of the field agitated for their
own teams, rather than agitating
against each other.
Not that Trojan and Indian
rooters lacked spirit. On the con
trary, it appeared to be the big
effort of the year, rooting-wise,
for both universities. But it didn't
necessarily indicate that USC stu
dents had been ignoring sour
grape rumblings.
SC Administration
Southern California's adminis
tration has a tight grasp on the
activities of its students, in class
room as well as outside. They
' gave the word: "Be good little
sports . . . or else."
Trojan Yell Leader Dann Angel
oft, who apparently holds his po
sition at the discretion of the pow
er 112 u I administration, explained
the situation to the packed USC
section in a pre-game warmup.
"There will bo no reference to
the PCC penalties," he said. "The
university has decided. I had
worked out a lot of stuff, but I
can't use it or my position will
bo filled next week," he said.
Apparently the administration's
word managed to convert the loot
ers, Angeloff commenting, "Now
what we've got to do is show that
| we can take our punishment like
[ men."
"Fit for Mother"
In sharp contrast to past per
formances, the Indian section was
loud and clear, putting up a full
60-minutb effort. Most cheers
were fit for mother to hear, dif
ferent from some past USC-Stan
i ford games and somewhat sur
prising, considering the circum
i stances. As usual, there were a
few yells of the off-color variety,
i but comparatively quiet and far
! between.
The Trojan looters, 14,000
strong, matched Stanford boosters
! all the way, under the direction
| of a talented crew of leaders who

managed to keep fans happy de
spite the heavy hand of the ad
ministration and a lark of pom
pon girls. .
After the game Jon Arnett,
making his last college football
appearance along with six other-
Trojans declared ineligible in the
recent PCC unpleasantness, stood
before the USC section and apolo
gized "because we failed you." He
was shouted down with cries of
"No, no!"
The seven were called to the
section with chants of "We want
our seniors."
Angeloff delivered the eulogy.
"I saw these guys working out
every day in double session prac
tices . . . my heart fell to my
shoes when they were allowed to
play only five games.
"They're tremendous Trojans,"
he said. "They put out 150 per
cent today."
Good Spirits —Angeloff
Angeloff took the defeat in out
wardly good spirits, commenting:
"We played our darnedest. You're
never ashamed when you put out
100 per cent."
No one would deny that both
teams were inspired, and neither
will they dispute that both root
ing sections, whatever the mo
tives, wore well disciplined and
waging, not a crusade of revenge,
but a battle for victory, well with
in the bounds of sportsmanship.
At game's end, with the smell
of roses in the air, the Indian sec
tion came to its feet and stood as
an army of small-fry rooters tore
down the goal posts and 70,000
Homecoming fans prepared to
leave the scene of what was hilled
as one of the top games of the
year.
They weren't disappointed.

USC-Stanford battling remained

Die-hard newspaper columnists,

packed rooting sections on both
sides of the field agitated for their
own teams, rather than agitating
against each other.
Not that Trojan and Indian
rooters lacked spirit. On the con

effort of the year, rooting-wise,
for both universities. But it didn't

SC Administration
Southern California's adminis
tration has a tight grasp on the
activities of its students, in class
room as well as outside. They
' gave the word: "Be good little
sports . . . or else."
Trojan Yell Leader Dann Angel
oft, who apparently holds his po
sition at the discretion of the pow
er 112 u I administration, explained
the situation to the packed USC
section in a pre-game warmup.
"There will bo no reference to
the PCC penalties," he said. "The
university has decided. I had
worked out a lot of stuff, but I
can't use it or my position will
bo filled next week," he said.
Apparently the administration's
word managed to convert the loot
ers, Angeloff commenting, "Now
what we've got to do is show that
| we can take our punishment like
[ men."
"Fit for Mother"
In sharp contrast to past per
formances, the Indian section was
loud and clear, putting up a full
60-minutb effort. Most cheers
were fit for mother to hear, dif
ferent from some past USC-Stan
i ford games and somewhat sur
prising, considering the circum
i stances. As usual, there were a
few yells of the off-color variety,
i but comparatively quiet and far
! between.
The Trojan looters, 14,000
strong, matched Stanford boosters
! all the way, under the direction
| of a talented crew of leaders who

managed to keep fans happy de
spite the heavy hand of the ad
ministration and a lark of pom
pon girls. .
After the game Jon Arnett,
making his last college football
appearance along with six other-
Trojans declared ineligible in the
recent PCC unpleasantness, stood
before the USC section and apolo
gized "because we failed you." He
was shouted down with cries of
"No, no!"
The seven were called to the
section with chants of "We want
our seniors."
Angeloff delivered the eulogy.
"I saw these guys working out
every day in double session prac
tices . . . my heart fell to my
shoes when they were allowed to
play only five games.
"They're tremendous Trojans,"
he said. "They put out 150 per
cent today."

Angeloff took the defeat in out

in the bounds of sportsmanship.
At game's end, with the smell
of roses in the air, the Indian sec
tion came to its feet and stood as
an army of small-fry rooters tore
down the goal posts and 70,000
Homecoming fans prepared to
leave the scene of what was hilled
as one of the top games of the
year.
They weren't disappointed.
