### 
JERUSALEM, Oct. 29 (UP)—lsraeli troops Invaded Egypt today
and struck 70 miles into Egyptian territory before digging in almost
within striking .distance of the Suez Canal.
An Israeli military communique announced that the Israeli forces
jumped off from the border near the Egyptian town of El Hunt ilia.

They swept through the hot Si
nai desert and rugged hills along
the edge of the Et Tih plateau,
attacking Egyptian "suicide com
mando" bases along the way.
The communique said the in
vading force had dug in west of
Ihe major road ju ction at
Nek hi, halfway to Suez a' the
southern entrance to the vital wa
terway.
The Egyptian army said today
it had begun "liquidating" an Is
raeli force which thrust its way
deep into Egyptian territory to
ward the Suez Canal.
Egyptian armv headquarters
announced that the Israeli force
had suffered "heavy casualties"
in the night-long fighting. It gave
no precise figures.
The headquarters announce
ment was the first indication
from the Egyptian side that
fighting had taken place.
Israeli press briefing officers
hinted the Israeli advance guard
may have approached to within
19 miles of Suez.
A high Israeli source denied
that the attack was in reprisal
for Egyptian • sponsored Arab
commando attacks.
"No Reprisal"
"It is too laVge an operation to
be described as reprisal," he said.
"Nor is this war," he added.
"This is too small an operation
for war. There is no bombing and
no artillery."
Asked whether the Israeli
army would continue to occupy
the Sinai desert, a high source
said only "that will depend on de
velopments."
He pointed out that a large
part of the Egyptian army was
now in the Sinai desert with mod
ern Russian tanks.
The Israeli advance into Egypt
was the first in which Israeli
forces attacked an Arab position
without immediately withdraw
ing, as in a hit-and-run raid.
Americans Leave
The advance came as U.S. au
thorities issued "urgent" warn
ings to American citizens in the
tense Middle East area to get out
"without delay." Americans be
gan pouring into Beirut, Leba
non, an air center, as the evacu
ation operation got under way on
both sides of the Israeli - Arab
frontiers.
Reports from Cyprus said Brit
ish troops on that Mediterra
nean island had been alerted for
possible action in the event the
Western Big Three invoke the tri
partite agreement under which
they are pledged to support peace
in the Middle East and come to
teh aid of the party under attack.
French Cabinet
In Paris, French Premier Guy
Mollet called his ministers of for
eign affairs, defense and ground
forces for an urgent conference
on Middle East developments.
Israel said tonight that Egyp
tian warships attempted to ap
proach Israeli shores near Ash
kelon before noon today. Egypt
later denied the report.
Ntrikng Force
The Israeli communique made
it clear that the striking force
dashed in a straight line toward
the Suez Canal, from a point
south of the heavily • defended
Gaza area. From their dug-in po
sitions west of Nekhl, the force
faces rugged mountains to the
east for 40 miles. Beyond the
mountains is an all-weather road
to the canal.
In Tel Aviv, a foreign ministry
spokesman declined to comment
on whether today's operation was
connected with Suez crisis and Is
rael's claim that it is entitled
to freedom of navigation" of the
canal. Egypt has blockaded the
canal against Israeli shipping.
There was no indication from
Israeli sources as to the strength
of the invading force or of its ar
mored protection.
