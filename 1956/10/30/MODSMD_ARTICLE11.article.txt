# Rebels Defy Government Cease-Fire
## Russian Troops to Remain in Budapest Until Fighting Stops 
### 
VIENNA, Oct. 29 (UP)—Hun
garian rebels tonight rejected the
Communist government's turn
about, Moscow • dictated ultima
tum to surrender.
In the heart of scarred and
hungry downtown Budapest, 2000
rebels held out in Kilian Barracks
against a ring of Soviet tanks,
field guns and mortars. Outside
the city, the rebel radio continued
its defiant broadcasts.
United Press correspondent An
thony Cavendish witnessed the
Soviet siege of Kilian Barracks
from a sheltered nearby doorway.
He reported that burned and
smashed Soviet equipment lit
tered the battleground surround
ing the barracks.
He said a freedom fighter told
him the men inside, the barracks
will die before surrendering.
No All-Out Attack
He said the Russians had not
yet launched an all-out atack but
as he watched, machineguns
were beating their tattoo under
the heavy fire of cannon and the
dull thump of Russian mortars.
Today the government of Pre
mier Imre Nagy, with an accom
panying anouncement from Mos
cow, reneged on its promise that
all Soviet forces were evacuating
the capital.
Instead, it said some Soviet
forces would remain until 24
hours after the last insurgents
had surrendered their arms.
The strong rebel force at
Gyoer, 67 miles to the northwest,
denounced "Communist prom
ises" and told all nationalists to
keep their guns.
Appeal to Workers
The state radio broadcast an
other desperate appeal to work
ers in Budapest to "cease fire and
return to work as soon as pos
sible."
The defense ministry backed
up the radio appeal with an an
nouncement that "Hungarian
troops will also protect the with
drawal of Russian troops," when
they finally leave.
Large forces of Soviet troops
and tanks already had pulled out
southward before the govern
ment anouncement. '
In Moscow, Soviet Defense
Minister Marshal Georgi Zhukov
said tonight no Soviet troop rein
forcements had entered Hungary
in 64 hours.
Soviet Foreign Minister Dmitri
T. Shepilov said Russian troops
would withdraw when the rebels
lay down their arms and order is
restored.
More Troops
That failed to jibe with British
dispatches. British Foreign Sec
retary Selwyn Lloyd said today
"Our information is that further
Soviet troops are being moved
into Hungary and toward the
capital."
Shepilov said that Soviet troops
"which acted to the demands
from the Hungarian government
for assistance" have "actually
ceased fire."
On-the-spot dispatches, how
ever, reported tank fire and ma
ehinegun fire in Budapest.
The new stand by Nagy's re
gime indicated intense Russian
pressure on his crumbling regime
to reject rebel demands and re
gain control through military
means.
He had only the Russians for
support. Virtually the entire
country, including 10 major sec
tors, was in rebel hands.
"We have come this far, we
may as well finish it off," a Hun
garian told UP correspondent
Cavendish in Budapest.
