SACRAMENTO, Oct. 29 (UP)
Senator William Knowland said
tonight, "I do not believe that
Senator George's statement" that
a special session of Congress may
be required in the Israel situation
"represents the views of the ad
ministration."
Knowland, an outspoken critic
of foreign policy in the past, said,
"I have been in touch with Wash
ington and the Israel problem
and any number of steps short of
military action" could lie taken
by teh United Nations.
The California Republican, Sen
ate minority leader, said the Is
rael invasion of Egypt "undoubt
edly will be brought before the
UN Security Council tomorrow."
"Unlike . . . Korea, the U.S.
would not become involved in
that area unless we were directly
attacked ... and unless Congress
was called to session" to approve
such an act.
Senator George (D-Ga.) was
"speaking for Senator George
alone" when he suggested a spe
cial session may be necessary,
Knowland said.
