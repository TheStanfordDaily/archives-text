# A 						Case for Stevenson
## 
### 
Thf. "Peace, Prosperity and Progress" of
these four Republican years is more than the
confident slogan of GOP campaign engineers.
The validity or invalidity of this claim has
be come the crux of the electoral battle between
Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson.
1 hese have been slow 1 12, quiet years. Guns
over the Korean hills have been silenced, as
has the near-forgotten Senator from Wisconsin.
I he nation as a whole is comfortably enjoying
its unparalleled prosperity, and the Republi
cans are asking: "What more do you want?
What more can Stevenson give you?"
It is difficult to argue that, on the surface
at least, this country is not both peaceful and
prosperous, and it is equally difficult to argue
that it would not have been just as peaceful
and prosperous under the Democrats, if for no
other reason than that the Eisenhower admin
istration has adopted, in diluted form, many
of the domestic welfare policies of the past
administrations and that, in the international
sphere, the Soviet Union has pursued a policy
of subtle infiltration, rather than open aggres
sion.
War in Korea, frustration over 20 years of
one party in power, charges of corruption and
bureaucratic control in Washington — these
were the dynamic issues in 1952. Issues this
year are either local, as the farm and civil
rights questions, or "hidden," as in foreign
policy or the question of national leadership.
Outside of Richard M. Nixon and the Vice-
Presidency and possibly the H-bomb debate,
there is no overriding national issue.
It is in these "hidden" issues—or, as it has
been phrased, "the question of lost opportu
nities ' —that we find our basis of support for
Stevenson over Eisenhower.
Granted all we know of Stevenson's execu
tive abilities in practice is from his record as
governor of Illinois, but from his excellent
liberal record and from bis generally high
toned, to-the-point analysis of national prob
lems we have faith that lie will be a leader
more capable than Eisenhower of assuming
the burgeoning responsibilities that will fall
upon the next President 6f the United States.
On the domestic scene, we have seen the
leadership of the Eisenhower administration
fall far short of adequate in:
• Civil rights, where work started by the
Truman administration was continued as in
desegregation of the armed forces, but little in
the sphere of implementing the Supreme Court
decision on school desegregation has been done
from the Executive Offices.
• Public power development, called "creep
ing socialism" by the President, where vast
national resources such as Hell's Canyon were
turned over to private concerns when their full
potential could only be realized under govern
ment sponsorship.
• Public school construction, where, for the

lack of Executive guidance until tlic last min
ute, a far-reaching school construction hill was
left to flounder in an election-minded Congress.
• Social security advances, where the Presi
dent protested against the extent of the liberal
increases that Congress made.
Respect for the United States abroad lias
taken a pathetic nose dive under the direction
of Secretary of State Dulles. Neutrals and allies
alike have become frustrated and confused by
the hair-raising statements of the Secretary
and the utter lack of direction in American
foreign policy as reflected in the Suez crisis and
our wavering attitude toward neutrals. Blame
for our failures in foreign policy cannot be
heaped on I lie Secretary alone, but must be
shared by the man who placed him in bis
position.
The issue perhaps of foremost significance
in tbe election is the question of Eisenhower's
capacities lor leadership during the next four
years. Presuming that nothing would remove
him from office during his term, Eisenhower
would still be impelled to assume a lesser
executive load at a time when the demands
made on a President are more pressing tlnni
ever.
The possibility of Nixon rising to the Presi
dency has set many individuals to reconsider
ing their Republican vote. There are many
who, for good reason, fear the "new Nixon,"
remembering well bis campaign tactics during
his congressional and senatorial races and bis
pre-1952 conservative record iu Congress.
Although hailed as a "moderate," Stevenson's
record in Illinois and his campaign speeches
have marked him as a farsighted liberal, re
jecting the oftentimes cure-all proposals of
both the far left and the far right.
Despite the usual campaign double-talk in
dulged in by both candidates, Stevenson h;is
chosen such places as the Deep South during
this campaign to make a strong civil rights
stand, as in 1952 be chose Texas as the platform
for his speech advocating federal control of
tidelands oil. I bis type of campaigning may
not score him more votes, but it indicates be
is willing to assume an unpopular stand when
pure political opportunism might direct other
wise.
And, although the proposal to end H-bomb
testing and the cogent reasons he has given for
advocating this radical plan may do little for
him vote-wise, this again indicates the man's
capacities for coming forth with new ideas at
a time when the world is crying out for adept
leadership and farsighted ideas.
I be next four years will demand a coura
geous and strong leader. It is doubtful that
any one man will be equal to the task set before
him, but in making an election-year choice, we
feel Stevenson is most qualified by bis sound,
intellectual and liberal outlook to assume the
reins of the Presidency.
