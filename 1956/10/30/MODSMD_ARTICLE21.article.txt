'Spoonfeeding* Explained

Editor, The Daily:
From the reaction of some of my fellow stu
dents toward my interview last Thursday, I re
ceived the impression that I did not express
myself clearly and comprehensively enough to
give the Daily interviewer the opportunity to
accurately reflect my attitude toward my host
university.
The rather unfortunate headline of this inter
view ("Wolfgang Schulz Says Stanford Students
Are Spoonfed, Not Encouraged to Think") needs
explanation and correction. In using the expres
sion "spoonfed" in connection witii day-to-day
reading assignments, I mentioned only one,
though to me rather significant, difference be
tween the way classes at the Free University of
Berlin and Stanford are held. I dare say, even
now, .alter nearly having been stoned by some
undergraduates, that a student is not very likely
to do further reading after completing his load
of daily assignments'.
This to mo does not seem to encourage the

student to formulate his own opinion on issues,
thus making him more dependent on his pro
fessor in developing a scientific attitude, which
implies the consideration of a wide variety of
opinions before coming to one's own conclusions.
However, I want to say that I also see defnite
advantages in this system, namely, that the in
dividual student has a chance t,o actively partici
pate in- discussions, true only in smaller classes,
thus giving him a chance to express his opinion
on what he has read. With the pure lecture-type
course prevailing in Germany (apart from semi
nars), the student is often pressed into too pas
sive a role.
A further definite advantage of this university
seems to be the student-professor, relationship.
Whereas in Germany a professor still assumes
the role of a demigod, with notable exceptions,
a student here is far more likely to get to know
his professor personally and also to talk to him
after class, which, of course, is a reflection of the
general difference in human relations between
Germany and the United States.
