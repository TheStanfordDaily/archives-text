Stanford's preparation for this
Snturdav's UCLA Bruin contest
will be largely designed by coach
William i Dutch > Fehring. To
him have fallen the Bruin scout
ing assignments thus far this
year.
"Passing (alone - won't win this
game," he told the local gridders
at their meeting last night. Coach
Fehring expects the Uclans to be
faster on the line than USC, with
i quicker secondary backs.
The assistant lootball coach,
who is also top man in the base
ball department, is in his eighth
year on the Indian grid staff. He
took over the diamond reins only
last spring, and his team turned
in a stellar record to welcome
him to the fold, winning 24
games.
Purdue Graduate
Fehring is a Purdue graduate
and an Ail-American grid star.
He played from 1931 to 1933 with
the Boilermakers, leading his
team as captain in 1933.

a coach, he worked on the staffs
at the Navy's lowa Pre-Flight
squad the University of Okla
homa, UCLA and his own alma
mater. He served with the Navy
from 1943 to 1946.
He works with the Indian tack
les and other linemen, having
played most of his football as a
tackle. Paul Wiggin draws a
great deal of praise from Dutch.
Considering him "an All-Ameri
can in every way," Fehring fur
i ther adds that his protege is "the
finest man I've ever worked
| with."
Ilitfli Praise for Krodie
Other figures on the Stanford
football scene are highly praised
by coach Fehring. John Brodie,
the nation's ace passer, is "a
great leader and passer among
college players." Of his boss,
Chuck Taylor, Fehring says,
"He's tremendousâ€”in his treat
ment of his men. his staff in ev
erything."
Coach Fehring, who was
j "thrilled" when he heard the last
ten minutes of t-he radio account
'of last Saturday's Indian-Trojan

battle, believes the Cards would
have had a better season than
they have had if injuries had not
plagued the squad.
Refusing to comment on the
"big question" for the Indians.
I coach Fehring maintains lhat
any good team plays its schedule
| one game at a time, never looking
, farther into the future than one
week.
Reflecting a view often ex
pressed by one of his famous co
horts. Dutch Fehring speaks of
base b a 11 most optimistically.
