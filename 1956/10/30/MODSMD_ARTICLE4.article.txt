## Israel-Egypt Fighting Belies Peace Claims Made by Government 
### 
BOSTON, Oct. 29 (UP)—Adlai
E. Stevenson declared tonight
that the outbreak of fighting be
tween Israel and Egypt gives the
lie to the Eisenhower administra
tion's claims that "all is well in
the world."
The Democratic Presidential
candidate took note of the "omi
nous and confusing developments
in the Middle East" in a speech at
a Mechanics Building rally.
"The government in Washing
ton has been telling us that all is
well in the world, that there is
peace, that there is as the Presi
dent anounced only a few days
ago 'good news' from the Middle
East," Stevenson said.
"These reassurances —as to
day's news confirms—have been
tragically less than the truth,"he
said.
"The world we walk on is
mined with trouble from Korea
to the Straits of Gibraltar, and
we are entitled to the truth about
it. "We've got to be ready to
meet our problems, to face them
squarely and make the right deci
sions."
Pat on the Head
Instead, Stevenson said, In the
four years Eisenhower has been
President "we've been patted on
the head and told that every
thing's all right."
"This is dangerous," he said.
"Dangerous to our very survival
in a troubled world."
President Eisenhower told
about receiving "good news"
about the Middle East two weeks
ago, in a telecast. He was refer
ring particularly to the dispute
with Egypt over the Suez Canal.
Stevenson, winding up his cam
paign to win Massachusetts' 16
electoral votes with tonight's
speech, also touched on the fights
of the Poles and the Hungarians
to win freedom from the Soviets.
He said the happenings in Po
land and Hungary in recent days
have provided "a testament to the
unshakeable faith that sustained
their peoples during the dark
years."
Away from People
After devoting four paragraphs
in his text to the Israel-Egypt
fighting Stevenson turned to an
attack on the admiinstration for
taking the government "away
from the people."
He attacked the "incredible
blunders" of Secretary of State
Dulles, charging these have
helped the Communists gain a
foothold in the Middle East and
"have further imperiled the secu
rity of Israel."
Stevenson said he assumed
President Eisenhower "just does
n't know" about these "blunders."
He went on to say the Presi
dent has turned over more pow
ers to men around him than any
other yhief executive, and rriean
while "has himself withdrawn in
creasingly from active direction
of the government.

lie to the Eisenhower administra
tion's claims that "all is well in
the world."
The Democratic Presidential
candidate took note of the "omi
nous and confusing developments
in the Middle East" in a speech at
a Mechanics Building rally.
"The government in Washing
ton has been telling us that all is
well in the world, that there is
peace, that there is as the Presi
dent anounced only a few days
ago 'good news' from the Middle
East," Stevenson said.
"These reassurances —as to
day's news confirms—have been
tragically less than the truth,"he
said.
"The world we walk on is
mined with trouble from Korea
to the Straits of Gibraltar, and
we are entitled to the truth about
it. "We've got to be ready to
meet our problems, to face them
squarely and make the right deci
sions."
Pat on the Head
Instead, Stevenson said, In the
four years Eisenhower has been
President "we've been patted on
the head and told that every
thing's all right."
"This is dangerous," he said.
"Dangerous to our very survival
in a troubled world."
President Eisenhower told
about receiving "good news"
about the Middle East two weeks
ago, in a telecast. He was refer
ring particularly to the dispute
with Egypt over the Suez Canal.
Stevenson, winding up his cam
paign to win Massachusetts' 16
electoral votes with tonight's
speech, also touched on the fights
of the Poles and the Hungarians
to win freedom from the Soviets.
He said the happenings in Po
land and Hungary in recent days
have provided "a testament to the
unshakeable faith that sustained
their peoples during the dark
years."
Away from People
After devoting four paragraphs
in his text to the Israel-Egypt
fighting Stevenson turned to an
attack on the admiinstration for
taking the government "away
from the people."
He attacked the "incredible
blunders" of Secretary of State
Dulles, charging these have
helped the Communists gain a
foothold in the Middle East and
"have further imperiled the secu
rity of Israel."
Stevenson said he assumed
President Eisenhower "just does
n't know" about these "blunders."
He went on to say the Presi
dent has turned over more pow
ers to men around him than any
other yhief executive, and rriean
while "has himself withdrawn in
creasingly from active direction
of the government.
