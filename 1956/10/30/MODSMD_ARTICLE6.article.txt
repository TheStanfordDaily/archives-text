Stanford Yell Leader Bill Dukes holds the Stanford Axe, which was
found Saturday morning in the automobile of Co-captain John
Brodie. Dukes is shown depositing the Axe in the American Trust
Company in Palo Alto. It will be kept there until a robbery-proof
case can be made to contain it. Standing with Dukes is Mr. Cobb,
president of the American Trust.
