SEND THE DAILY HOME
With our usual merchan
dising reticence . . .
And dislike of exploiting
sacred occasions, here we are
only two months in advance
to suggest that you select
your Christmas cards (with
or without imprint) from our
carefully - selected stock of
domestic and foreign cards.
At the same time browse
through our complete paper
bound collection for a selec
tion of stocking fillers. And
note our art prints and art
books ranging from 35c to
$25.00.
