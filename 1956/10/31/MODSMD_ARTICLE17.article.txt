# And Again War Looms
## 
### 
With the invasion of Suez by British and
French troops, the peoples of the world are
again consumed by the terrifying, sickening
thought of war.
The balance of power has been twisted into
fantastic proportions with the United States
and its old allies, Britain and France, splitting
over an issue that may tumble the whole com
munity of nations into war. Russia stands to
gain from the tragic break-up of Anglo-Ameri
can unity; the world stands to lose.
Il may he said that this was the opportunity
Our two European allies were waiting for to
seize the Suez Canal by force, that secret di
plomacy was involved, that selfish national
/ ambitions have become so consummated that
American diplomacy has become utterly in

capable of containing war maneuvers even by
our allies.
It is the supreme of paradoxes that tlie' Unit
ed States and the Soviet Union stood virtually
together in the United Nations yesterday in
their efforts to prevent hostile actions by our
two most needed allies. It is hardly a case of
entangling alliances, for, in a day, century-old
alliances have been uprooted and torn brutally
apart.
We may pray that the contagion will not
spread beyond the confines of the present area
or, more hopefully, that the belligerent powers
may be brought to reason. The unfortunate
truth about war is that emotion runs rampant
over reason, with human life wasted in the
consequence.
