# 'Yes' on Propositions 2 and 3
## 
### 
l\ tiie quadrknnial f.lf.ction battle in which
presidential candidates dominate national at
tention, state issues often fall bv the wayside.
Be< muse of the cninbersome length and detailed
nature of our state constitution, a flood of con
stitutional amendments faces the voters in each
election, and many important measures go
ignored.
As well as the controversial Proposition 4,
and Proposition 5 which is discussed below,
there ;ire two other state propositions worthy
of serious consideration. They are Propositions
2 and 3, which together would allocate through
a bond issue $300 million to go toward con
struction of public schools, state colleges and
oilier state institutions.
Proposition 2 would direct a $100 million
bond issue to continue the present program of
state loans and grants to overcrowded school
districts.
Proposition 3 would authorize $200 million
in state bonds providing for property acquisi
tion, construction and equipment for state col

leges and other state construction develop
ments. At least $60 million of this bond issue
would go to state colleges.
Opponents of these measures argue that in
creased state spending in these fields would
lead to inflation and top-heavy state debt.
Opponents of Proposition 2 in particular argue
that state grants and loans to public school
districts would be an unsound encroachment of
the state into local school administration.
Despite their legal and economic overtones,
these arguments fall drastically short when one
considers the overwhelming rise of school en
rollments each year, the growing pressure put
on state medical institutions and the alarming
fact that the situation will, by necessity, grow
more serious each year unless the state is pre
pared to allocate sufficient funds to guarantee
decent standards in its schools and hospitals.
For these reasons we urge a "Yes" vole on
Propositions 2 and 3, feeling these are appro
priate and necessary measures to insure proper
financial outlay to meet the demands of a fast
growing population.
