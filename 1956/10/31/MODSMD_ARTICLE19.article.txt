Thread as Well as Circuses
Editor, The Daily:
I was just as excited and happy as the next
guy when another fine Stanford team walloped
Southern California, but my joy was not un
confined because of my irritation over the fact
that the Main Library closed for the second time
this quarter at noon on Saturday.
Now, it may be that I'm the only one who
thinks that the Reference Room and the Stacks
should be accessible for more than eight hours
over a week end, even a home-game week end.
And I suppose the logical answer to my com
plaint is that the library staff wants to see the
game, and if I'm so happy over the outcome

I should want to be there too, so why bolher to
keep the library open?
Well, aside from the "ad hominem" argument
(which is pretty hard to answer), it seems to me
that unless the library has no patronage at all
on home-game Saturday afternoons, it is setting
a rather ominous precedent.
It also seems to me that up to now we have
taken pride in the fact that football is not over
emphasized at Stanford (or at least not as much
as it is elsewhere); but if the library is going to
close down for every game with a school larger
than San Jose State, we are penalizing scholar
ship for the sake of athleticism.
By all means let's have the circuses, but let's
not forget the bread.
