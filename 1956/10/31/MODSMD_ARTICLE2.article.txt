# Richards Declares U.S. Partly To Blame for Egyptian Crisis
## Condemns Dulles for Doing Nothing Concrete About Nasser's Rise Except Hollow Aid Offers 
### Sally Trapnell 
"It is too early to assess the blame for the crisis in Egypt today,
but part of it may be due to wrong emphasis in American foreign
policy," State Senator Richard Richards, Democratic candidate for
the U.S. Senate, said in a luncheon speech at the Theta Chi house
yesterday.
Richards condemned Dulles for watching the development of a

dictatorship in Egyf>t and doing
nothing constructive about it ox
cept make hollow offers of Aswan
Dam aid and make counter
charges to Russian statements.
*The United States never made
clear its position on Israel either,"
Richards said. He suggested that
the Israeli aggression may have
been due to fear of Egyptian
strength, because the United
States never supplied weapons to
her to keep pace in the arms race.
Richards disapproved of Nix
on's "don't change horses in mid
stream" attitude to the crisis and
also of the "Monday morning
quarterback" attitude of criticism
that "certain other candidates"
have taken.
Both Parties Immature
Shifting to other aspects of
American foreign policy, Richards
said that both Democrats and Re
publicans have been immature,
catering far too much to colonial
ism and the dictatorships both of
the left and right.
"Rather than bribing military
potentates like Tito and Franco
with arms," he said, "we should
reach the people with technical
assistance programs—which, inci
dentally, cost much less."
. In answer to a question, Rich
ards said that all is definitely not
right on the farm scene. There
has been further depletion of in
come in the pasl four years, and
one-eighth of California's farm
families have gone bankrupt.
"The soil bank approach is not
sufficient," Richards said, "nor is
a simple cut in production Ihe
answer to all ills as the Repub
licans seem to think."
Parity Program
Richards advocated a tempora
ry parity program to get farmers
back on their feet and then a ver
sion of the Brannen plan, where
all goods would be put on the
market and any loss to farmers
made up with direct payments |
from the government.
Richards is in favor of outright
repeal of the Taft-Hartley labor
law, which he thinks is completely ;
had, and he believes a new and !
more equitable labor-management j
law should be written.
Richards gave as an example ]
the FEPC bill he introduced in
the stale legislature when it was
controlled by Ihe GOP. Although 1
the bill got past the Assembly, it 1
was defeated in Senate commit
tees by votes in which every Re- i
publican opposed the law and j
every Democrat favored it.
Richards also took the opportu
nity to point out that his oppo- j
nent, Senator Thomas Kuehel, had j
voted in favor of Senator .lames
Eastland of Mississippi as head of
the Senate Judiciary Committee,
a move certain to block civil j
rights legislation.
Richards said that he differs j
with the Democratic platform in!
respect to its stand in favor of
higher tariffs.
"This is a very complicated
ouestion." lie. said, "but in the
long view of things I support
lowering tariffs in all fields,"
