## Race Clause Provokes Sorority Protest 
### Mary Ellen Remney 
Last Thursday morning two Negro cooks em
ployed by the Sigma Kappa sorority at Cal wereß
confronted by a strange sight when they arrivedß
for work early in the morning. An eight-foot-highß
was smoldering on the front lawn, and a0 1
sign was taped to the front of the house saying ■"*
"KKK—Sigma Kappa—Keep Out the Niggers-
KKK, the Monarch of the Klans." «|£
The sign was a reaction to the national contro-"~~,
versy currently raging oyer the action of the ;
Sigma Kappa national organization, which this
year suspended two of its chapters, apparently —
for pledging Negresses.
The surprised Berkeley group quickly removed *
the traces of the Ku Klux Klan demonstration
and stated that the chapter "had pledged no
Negresses, nor were they considering doing so."
But at Cornell University one of the suspended
chapters remained deadlocked with the national
and voted to operate as a local chapter under
suspension from their national organization. Last
spring the chapter pledged a Negress, and three
months ago the group was notified that it had
been suspended.
Deane W. Malott, president of Cornell Univer
sity, sent a letter Oct. 3 to the sorority's national
president, asking for a further explanation of
the action. "What do you propose to do?" he
asked in the letter. "Our local chapter would
prefer to retain its national affiliation; it does,
however, hold high its right to select members
on the basis of congeniality and merit. My own
position is one of defending our local chapter in
its decision . . ."
The letter was ignored, and the repeated ques
tions asked by the chapter members were also
ignored. The members finally set Oct. 20 as the
deadline for hearing from the national, after
which time they would revoke their charter en
tirely. On Oct. 19 they received the following
letter: •
"As members of the National Council of Sigma
Kappa, we have given serious consideration to
your letters of Sept. 15 and Oct. 19, and the

Council unanimously reaffirms the action here
tofore taken with respect to Alpha Zeta chapter."
The letter was signed by the five top national
officers.
The only reason the chapter was ever given
for suspension was that it was "for the good of
the sorority as a whole."
The other chapter expelled from the national
is at Tufts University, in Massachusetts. There
a state commission is investigating the ouster.
State Representative Sumner Z. Kaplan said that
he is sure "without any doubts" that the national
sorority "is practicing discrimination."' There is
the admitted possibility that Sigma Kappa will
be banned from state-supported University of
Massachusetts because of discriminatory prac
tices, although Kaplan would not state whether
he would recommend such an action.
At the University of Massachusetts, President
J. Paul Mather said that he would present to the
Board of Trustees a stronger statement of the
existing policy, which forbids the establishment
of sororities and fraternities with bias clauses,
and urges houses to work for the riddance of
such provisions from their constitutions.

In a poll taken recently of college editors across
the country, The Nation magazine found that,
among the 52 editors replying, 32 favored Eisen
hower and 22 Stevenson.
I his indicated, The Nation said, a considerable
but by no means conclusive swing toward Steven
son, for a poll taken last May indicated that
Eisenhower was then favored 2 to 1. Nine out of
10 editors had made up their minds at convention
lime, so the campaign has not attributed much
to Stevenson's gain.
I he world situation, The Nation reports, was
used heavily as an argument for both sides, as
were the candidates' honesty, intellect and per
sonality. Specific issues were not stressed except
by those favoring Stevenson who heaped criti
cism on Vice-President Nixon and the President's
capacity for leadership.

The letter was ignored, and the repeated ques

ignored. The members finally set Oct. 20 as the
deadline for hearing from the national, after
which time they would revoke their charter en

letter: •
"As members of the National Council of Sigma
Kappa, we have given serious consideration to
your letters of Sept. 15 and Oct. 19, and the

Council unanimously reaffirms the action here
tofore taken with respect to Alpha Zeta chapter."
The letter was signed by the five top national
officers.
The only reason the chapter was ever given
for suspension was that it was "for the good of
the sorority as a whole."
The other chapter expelled from the national
is at Tufts University, in Massachusetts. There
a state commission is investigating the ouster.
State Representative Sumner Z. Kaplan said that
he is sure "without any doubts" that the national
sorority "is practicing discrimination."' There is
the admitted possibility that Sigma Kappa will
be banned from state-supported University of
Massachusetts because of discriminatory prac
tices, although Kaplan would not state whether
he would recommend such an action.
At the University of Massachusetts, President
J. Paul Mather said that he would present to the
Board of Trustees a stronger statement of the
existing policy, which forbids the establishment
of sororities and fraternities with bias clauses,
and urges houses to work for the riddance of
such provisions from their constitutions.

In a poll taken recently of college editors across
the country, The Nation magazine found that,
among the 52 editors replying, 32 favored Eisen
hower and 22 Stevenson.
I his indicated, The Nation said, a considerable
but by no means conclusive swing toward Steven
son, for a poll taken last May indicated that
Eisenhower was then favored 2 to 1. Nine out of
10 editors had made up their minds at convention
lime, so the campaign has not attributed much
to Stevenson's gain.
I he world situation, The Nation reports, was
used heavily as an argument for both sides, as
were the candidates' honesty, intellect and per
sonality. Specific issues were not stressed except
by those favoring Stevenson who heaped criti
cism on Vice-President Nixon and the President's
capacity for leadership.
Last Thursday morning two Negro cooks em
ployed by the Sigma Kappa sorority at Cal wereß
confronted by a strange sight when they arrivedß
for work early in the morning. An eight-foot-highß
was smoldering on the front lawn, and a0 1
sign was taped to the front of the house saying ■"*
"KKK—Sigma Kappa—Keep Out the Niggers-
KKK, the Monarch of the Klans." «|£
The sign was a reaction to the national contro-"~~,
versy currently raging oyer the action of the ;
Sigma Kappa national organization, which this
year suspended two of its chapters, apparently —
for pledging Negresses.
The surprised Berkeley group quickly removed *
the traces of the Ku Klux Klan demonstration
and stated that the chapter "had pledged no
Negresses, nor were they considering doing so."
But at Cornell University one of the suspended
chapters remained deadlocked with the national
and voted to operate as a local chapter under
suspension from their national organization. Last
spring the chapter pledged a Negress, and three
months ago the group was notified that it had
been suspended.
Deane W. Malott, president of Cornell Univer
sity, sent a letter Oct. 3 to the sorority's national
president, asking for a further explanation of
the action. "What do you propose to do?" he
asked in the letter. "Our local chapter would
