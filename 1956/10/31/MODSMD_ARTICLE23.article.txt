# Israeli, Egyptian Foreign Students View Countries' Present Hostilities
## Israel Getting Help From West, Says Egyptian Student 
### Wally Simpson 
"Israel has no reasonable basis
for her attack on Egypt Monday,"
said Egyptian graduate student
Soliman Mahmoud Soliman.
"Certainly it is hardly conceiv
able that Israel, with only two
million people, could hope to de
feat Egypt with 20 million without
help from other sources," he said.
Soliman suspects that this at
tack may have been planned as a
method for England and France
to regain control of Suez. Under
the terms of the British with
drawal from Suez, Britain reserv
ed the right to return her troops
should Suez he threatened. Once
back, it would be difficult to get
them removed again.
"Israel's Premier David Ben-
Gurion can't he trusted," Soliman
said. "Just a few days ago he
said Israel would never start any
war against Egypt. But if Israel
didn't start this, who did? Cer
tainly not Egypt."
Soliman referred tp the ruling
parties in Israel as "gangsters."
lie said that these gangster ele
ments have been in control of
Israel's government since its in
ception. It is these elements,
taken from the early gangs such
as the "Stern" and "Hagganah"
groups, that have caused all the
trouble.
Israel has never kept her end
of the truce agreements, he said.
Since 1918 there have been many
violations of the armistice by Is
rael. The Arab nations, however,
have been sincere and obedient to
Unit e d Nat ions commands to
cease hostilities.
Soliman said that he felt the
world powers have been rather
unfair in their attitudes toward
the Arab nations in these contro
versies with Israel. "They have
always sympathized with Israel,
since she is a small nation, but
they have seldom done more than
admonish her for making border
raids. I feel that the great powers
should be fairer to the Arab na
tions in this respect."
Soliman said that he did not
believe Egypt's embargo on Is
raeli shipping through the Suez
Canal is sufficient reason for
Monday's full-scale attack. Since
the nationalization of Suez, Is
raeli shipping has been allowed
through. That is, all except mili
tary goods, he said.
"It's getting more and more dif
ficult for Egypt to resolve the dif
ferences between Israel and her
self," Soliman said. He felt that
there was no common ground on
which the two nations could work
out a satisfactory settlement of
their differences.
"We don't know what the UN
will do about the situation now,"
he said. "But, of course," he add
ed, "something will have to be
worked out."
Soliman was quite confident
that if Israel were left to herself
Egypt would have no trouble in
driving her forces back to the
borders and of even defeating Is
rael's army. But. he feels, it is
quite probable that Israel is not
making this attack on her own.
