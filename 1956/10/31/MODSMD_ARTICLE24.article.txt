# Theta Chi's Police Force Monopoly Not Intentional
## Student Chief Explains All Men Except Frosh May Apply at Placement Office for Positions 
### 
Student Police Chief Karl Brueckner guarantees that the Theta
Chi house has no intended monopoly on the student police force.
It just happens that Brueckner, who is now going into his third
year as student police chief, is a Theta Chi. So the men he lives
around are better "educated" to this function of ASSU.

"The police force is open to any
one with sophomore standing or
above who wants to work," Karl
said. "And there is a notice in the
Placement Service to inform them
about it." The pay rate for a stu
dent policeman is $1 an hour.
Uniformed in clothes appropri
ate for the occasion and red-and
white arm bands, student police
appear at most large ASSU func
tions. It is their responsibility to
protect University buildings and
property. This includes the prop
erty of off-campus establishments
at which authorized ASSU activi
ties are being held.
Student police guard University
property in numbers varying
from 12 men at activities held in
the Pavilion to two at Branner
Hall functions.
There are eight men on duty
at the Sunday night flicks. It is
here, according to Brueckner, that
they run into trouble. "People
phone in and say that there is an
emergency and will we please
page so-and-so. The only way to
page people at the flicks is to
flash their name on the screen.
And most of the time it is just a
big joke and there is no real emer
gency."
The most difficult chore facing
Stanford student police is keeping
upper-classmen out of Freshman
Week activities. Brueckner said
that at these activities people ac
tually climb in windows or break
down doors.
After refraining from an active
participation in the function they
are policing, when everyone else
has left the premises the student
policemen can take off their offi
cial arm bands, forget the power
of the law and return to being
regular Stanford students.
