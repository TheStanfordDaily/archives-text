# COSMO CLUB
## Membership Represents 50 Countries 
### 
Only one Stanford club can
make the claim of having 300
members from 50 nations.
That organization is Interna
tional Student Club, also known
as Cosmopolitan Club, Cosmo
Club or "I" Club. It is open to
both American and foreign stu
dents.
International Club was founded
in 1949 to serve these two pur
poses: to integrate American and
foreign students and to enable
students to learn customs, ideas
and techniques of other lands.
Meetings then consisted of Fri
day afternoon coffee hours, held
at 661 Cabrillo Street, Palo Alto.
To accommodate more students
the coffee hours now are conduct
ed in Bowman Alumni House or
in women's residences.
Besides coffee hours, "I" Club
sponsors activities ranging from
dancing classes to guided tours.
Regular features are Monday
evening dancing classes in Wom
en's Gymnasium and bi-weekly
dances in area restaurants.
Each year the club conducts a
Thanksgiving vacation tour to
Monterey and Carmel, followed
by a Christmas vacation jaunt
around the Southwest. These ac
tivities are open to all students.
