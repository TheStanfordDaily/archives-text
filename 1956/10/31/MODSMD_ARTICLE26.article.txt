### Dave Scott 
Israel, in its raid into Egypt, is
not driving to all-out war, but is
merely trying to prove to the
Egyptians that they are not in
volved in a "unilateral" war, ac
cording to Emanuel Feuchtwang,
foreign scholar from Israel.
"We must present a show of
force in order to survive," he said,
"but above all we want peace and
equality for the nations of the
area."
He explained that the Egyp
tians "had the feeling that they
were at war with Israel, but Is
rael was not at war with Egypt.
"Up to now action has been
limited to the border," he said,
"with the Israeli citizens in their
narrow country getting hurt while
the mass of the 20 million Egyp
tian people, separated safely from
th<} border by the Sinai Desert,
never know what is happening to
them."
By the raid, Feuchtwang ex
plained, "we just want to scare
them, show them how strong we
are. Once they realize we are
strong, then we will be satisfied.
We have neither the force nor
the intention to occupy Egypt."
Feuchtwang strongly criticized
the methods of border warfare
used by the Arab nations. "We
have never made attacks on pri
vate citizens when we cross the
border; it is only military instal
lations and Arab soldiers that we
are after. Our raids are large-scale
operations, in broad daylight and
admitted by everyone.
"The Egyptians make night
raids, blow up roads and throw
grenades into buildings, killing in
nocent citizens," he said. "And all
the help we get from the United
Nations is sympathy and the feel
ing that nobody cares what is
going on in the area so long as it
doesn't hurt them.
"After three months of trying
to follow Hammarskjold's cease
fire order, our eyes were opened.
Arms were continually pouring
into the Arab nation, while Israel
was hurt by embargo. Egypt was
being supplied by the West as
well as the Soviet Union, and
American arms aid to Iraq was
being turned over to the Arab
nations.
"Pacts joining Jordan, Syria
and Egypt firmly convinced us
that the nations were intending
to carry out their repeated threats
to wipe out the state of Israel."
He emphasized that territorial
troops, pledged to protect their
own particular border district,
"can only 'take' so much. We
have been hit over the head once
too often," he said. "The people
got to the point that if they didn't
take the matter into their hands,
nobody would. The United Na
tions has the power to act, but
has continually turned its head
the other way.

and Egypt firmly convinced us
that the nations were intending
to carry out their repeated threats
to wipe out the state of Israel."
He emphasized that territorial
troops, pledged to protect their
own particular border district,
"can only 'take' so much. We
have been hit over the head once
too often," he said. "The people
got to the point that if they didn't

Israel, in its raid into Egypt, is
not driving to all-out war, but is

"We must present a show of
force in order to survive," he said,
"but above all we want peace and

He explained that the Egyp

"Up to now action has been
limited to the border," he said,
"with the Israeli citizens in their
narrow country getting hurt while
the mass of the 20 million Egyp
tian people, separated safely from

never know what is happening to
them."
By the raid, Feuchtwang ex
plained, "we just want to scare
them, show them how strong we
are. Once they realize we are
strong, then we will be satisfied.
We have neither the force nor
the intention to occupy Egypt."
Feuchtwang strongly criticized
the methods of border warfare
used by the Arab nations. "We
have never made attacks on pri
vate citizens when we cross the
border; it is only military instal
lations and Arab soldiers that we
are after. Our raids are large-scale
operations, in broad daylight and
admitted by everyone.
"The Egyptians make night
raids, blow up roads and throw
grenades into buildings, killing in
nocent citizens," he said. "And all
the help we get from the United
Nations is sympathy and the feel
ing that nobody cares what is
going on in the area so long as it
doesn't hurt them.

to follow Hammarskjold's cease
