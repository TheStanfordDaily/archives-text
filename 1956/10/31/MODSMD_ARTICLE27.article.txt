# ZOE ANN WARBERG
## 'Miss America' Contestant Studies in SU Law School 
### 
For the first time in Stanford
history, a contender for the title
of Miss America has entered law
school here.
Zoe Ann Warberg, the present
Miss Idaho, is a first-year law
student. She has won a total of
$2250 in various beauty contests.
As Miss Twin Falls she re
ceived $250, and as Miss Idaho
she won $1000 and an additional
$500 at Atlantic City, N.J. When
she decided to attend Stanford
the judges awarded her another
$500.
When Miss Warberg finishes
her legal training she wants to
return to Twin Falls and establish
her own law practice.
She attended the College of
Idaho for two years and then she
transferred to Linfield College in
Oregon for her junior and senior

years. She was graduated cum
laude and was May queen at Lin
field's annual May festival.
Miss Warberg's impressions of
beauty contests were not what she
| had expected. "You think every
; one is going to be so glamorous
and hard to talk to," she said.
"Not at all. The other 51 girls
were terrific and we had a great
time being rushed from judges'
breakfasts to judges' luncheons,
and so on, all week long.
"I found Stanford impersonal
at first. I'm used to a much small
er college. The first day I felt like
an entering freshman as I saw
this mass of red jackets and tre
mendous crowds of people.
"Now. though, I really feel at
home here. Of course, there's so
much work that you have little
chance to do or to think of any
thing else."
