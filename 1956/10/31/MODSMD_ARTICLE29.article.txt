# Looking It Over

### 
With Jerry Kelly
There have been some mighty queer tilings happening in West
wood, California.
For an institution that has received a $1)5.000 penalty this year,
UCLA has not shown signs of making amends. Seems the Bruin
Bench and the Young Men's Club of Westwood have merely gone
further underground. And football mentor Red Sanders, under in
structions from his boss, Chancellor Raymond Allen, has apparently
ignored PCC warnings although it could break up the conference.
A little history about that institution in Westwood, its football
system and its chancellor, a former president at the University of
Washington, incidentally, may be profitable.
The lid flew off the UCLA scandal early this year when a former
Bruin fullback, George Stephenson, volunteered information about
the illegal practices at UCLA.
Stephenson testified that an office was set up in Westwood Vil
lage as a front to distribute over ยง11,000 in cash to the grid squad
each year. This undercover payment was in addition to the $75 a
month normally allotted players for campus employment.
SANDERS GETS HIS MATERIAL
The two financial alumni clubs mentioned above saw to it that
Coach Sanders was furnished a wealth of material. The non-profit,
tax-exempt set-ups raised over $200,000 in three years for recruiting.
Little wonder that Sanders led his Bruins to three successive PCC
championships and a 34-3 won-lost record in those same three years.
In retaliation for the whistle-blowing against the Bruins, certain
alumni from UCLA proceeded to "get tlie goods" on other PCC in
stitutions, especially the three other California schools. Through
counter-espionage, agents were able to uncover illegal practices at
Southern California and Cal. โข
When Ronnie Knox and stepfather Harvey switched from Cal to
UCLA the green light was lit which lead to instigating investiga
tions. What the Bruin Bench offered, the Knoxes couldn't resist.
A GOOD SUMMARY
Jeff Cravath, former USC football coach, summed up a relative
position between a normal school and UCLA. He said: "When one
school lands a kid, his old man is given a case of whisky. At UCLA
they give him a whisky distributorship."
The administration and coaching staff at Westwood's leading in
stitution thus far appear to be ignoring PCC warnings although play
ing the role more cautiously. The Super League recently advocated
in the East was to include UCLA. Maybe they like that in the South
land.
Something of interest was brought out at the Northern California
Football Writers' Association luncheon Monday. Seems in UCLA's
loss to Oregon State last Saturday many of the best Uclan footballers
did not play at all or very little of the time. Strange, since the
Bruins were after their 20th straight conference victory. Would
beating Stanford Saturday mean that much to Sanders?
HILL IN HIGH PRAISE
USC coach Jess Hill had nothing but praise for Stanford ace
quarterback John Brodie. At the Southern California Football Writ
ers' Association luncheon, Hill said: "There's not a college passer
in the country with his innate ability at the position. He's great and
there's no questioning that." ~~
"I'd like to take away Brodie and see what Stanford could do
against us," he continued. "Brodie plays quarterback like a well
drilled pro."
CAMERA "SHOULD PLAY"
After the "Game of the Year" last Saturday the numerous North
ern and Southern California sports writers rushed to the Indian
dressing room for comments from Coach Taylor, trainer Connie
Jarvis and the team. Jarvis, being the first to return, was the first
under fire. Invariably the sports writers started the quizzing with
"What's the word on Camera?" Will he be able to play against
UCLA?"
The personable Jarvis was able to keep his long smile even after
this question, for Paul Camera had already been X-rayed and reports
were favorable. No broken bones were discovered although Camera
was badly bruised.
Brodie's favorite target, Camera made several "impossible"
catches against the Trojans to continue his fabulous mark.
