## 
### 
Jess Ritchie, manufacturer of
Battery Additive AD-X2, yester
day called the American "bureau
cratic" government an "enor
mous Frankenstein monster that
we have created."
Speaking in Bowman Alumni
House, the Oakland manufactur
er told the Independent Caucus
how he had fought the federal
government "division by divi
sion" to receive a clean bill of
health for his product.
"The bureaucrats in Washing
ton," ho said wilh a straight face,
"have more respect for me than
they do for Eisenhower."
"Father-Son" Talk
Ritchie told how he, Postmas
ter General Arthur Summerfield
and Secretary of Commerce Sin
clair Weeks got together in a
ltiom for a "father-son" talk. "I
was the father," he said, "and
they were the sons."
Cause of this talk was the way
the Better Business Bureau, the
U.S. Senate, Federal Trade Com
mission and Bureau of Standards
"drag small businessmen like me
all over the country for hear
ings," he said.
Beginning in 1953, Ritchie had,
he said, made 18 transcontinental
airplane flights for hearings on
the merits and demerits of his
product. Ritchie was made to ap
pear before 110 governmental
agencies.
Result of his talk with Weeks
was the firing of the Bureau of
Standards head because Ritchie
had proved "collusion" between
the Bureau and the battery "mo
| nopoly."
Pressure Groups
Ritchie cited examples of small
i businesses like his own which he
i said had been "broken" by big
! business pressure groups operat
! ing through the federal govcrn
i rnent's regulatory agencies.
Income taxes, Ritchie said, pay
i for such regulatory activities of
I government. "In teh end the per
] son who pays income taxes is the
( consumer," he declared.
"If I'm taxecr a little more I
| just add a little more to my costs
and keep the same profit." He
advocated repeal of the 16th
! Amendment.
Recalling his experiences be
fore the Senate committee inves
; tigating Battery Additive ADX2.
j the speaker said, "1 don't believe
(Torn (Senator Thomas Kuchel, a
member of the committeei was
ever there."
"When asked recently if I was
' going to help Kuchel in his cam
' paign," Richie asserted. "I replied
| I was going to do just as much
j for him as he did for me in Wash
J iiigton. Exactly nothing."
