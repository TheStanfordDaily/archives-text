# Bruins Seek New Streak, Plan Start Against Cards
## Docter Back, Camera Still Doubtful: New Ground Strength Will Aid Cards 
### 
UCLA's Bruins, smarting from their first conference loss since
1953, will attempt to start another winning streak Saturday when
the Stanford Indians invade Los Angeles.
Oregon State, still posing as a formidable Rose Bowl threat, put
an end to Red Sanders' 19-game victory string in PCC action with a

21-7 triumph on Saturday. The
last time the Bruins had lost in
conference play was in 1953, when
they suffered a 21-20 setback to
Bobby Garrett and Stanford.
UCLA hopes to duplicate its
last meeting with the Cards in
the Coliseum. In that game, in
1954, the Uclans more than gained
revenge for the previous loss by
handing Stanford its worst defeat
in history, 72-0. Last season the
Indians spotted the Bruins a 21-0
lead before going down in respect
able fashion, 21-13.
Outlook Brightened
The Card outlook was bright
ened yesterday by the return to
action of Tackle Steve Docter.
Docter, injured in the Michigan
State game, will help relieve the
load on Troy Barbee in the left
tackle slot. Still missing from
that position is John Kidd, who
is expected to be out for at least
another week.
Wingback Paul Camera is still
on the doubtful list. The ace In
dian pass receiver injured his
back late in last Saturday's game,
but not before turning in another
outstanding performance. Came
ra lost his PCC pass - receiving
lead, llbwever, to Washington
State's Bill Steiger. Paul has 24
receptions to Steiger's 26.
While having no one of quite
the caliber of Paul Camera, Primo
Villanueva, Sam Brown or Ron
nie Knox, UCLA is still well for
tified in the key tailback slot ftf
their single-wing offense. Sopho
more Don Long, a star of earlier
games this season, and Edison
Griffin, who started last week
against OSC, will be handling
most of the duties in the triple
threat position.
Pleasant Surprise
Sophomore Barry Billington
has been a pleasant surprise at
fullback. He's cracked the line for
257 yards so far this season.
Rounding out the starting back
field for the Uclans will be Don
Shinnick at blocking back and
Louis Elias at wingback.
The Bruins are blessed with a
wealth of talent, headed by Senior
Pete O'Garro, at end. Backing
him up are Dick Wallen, Ihe
team's top receiver with 17 recep
tions. At right wing are Juniors
Hal Smith and Pat Pinkston.
Three juniors who have no wor
ries about '"five games" top the
UCLA line. Center Jim Matheny,
Guard Esker Harris and Tackle
Jerry Penner are the standout
forwards.
Tight Defense
The Uclans lack the crushing,
high-powered offense of their
predecessors, but still have put
together a pretty tight defense.
While third defensively, UCLA
ranks above only anemic Idaho in
PCC total offense standings, av
eraging 257.3 yards a game.
Card Quarterback John Brodie
ran his total offense yardage to
1034 last week in leading the big
victory over Southern California.
The Bruins have ideas of stop
ping this scoring threat, for they
have allowed only one touchdown
to be scored on them through the
air.
A rapidly improving ground at
tack has succeeded in taking some
of the offense load off Brodie and
will cause the J3ruins more de
fensive worries. Lou Valli, Gordy
Young, A 1 Harrington and Doug
Dick all turned in outstanding
performances Saturday.

Hal Smith and Pat Pinkston.
Three juniors who have no wor
ries about '"five games" top the
UCLA line. Center Jim Matheny,
Guard Esker Harris and Tackle
Jerry Penner are the standout
forwards.
Tight Defense
The Uclans lack the crushing,
high-powered offense of their
predecessors, but still have put
together a pretty tight defense.
While third defensively, UCLA
ranks above only anemic Idaho in
PCC total offense standings, av
eraging 257.3 yards a game.
Card Quarterback John Brodie
ran his total offense yardage to
1034 last week in leading the big
victory over Southern California.
The Bruins have ideas of stop
ping this scoring threat, for they
have allowed only one touchdown
to be scored on them through the
air.
A rapidly improving ground at
tack has succeeded in taking some
of the offense load off Brodie and
will cause the J3ruins more de
fensive worries. Lou Valli, Gordy
Young, A 1 Harrington and Doug
Dick all turned in outstanding
performances Saturday.
UCLA's Bruins, smarting from their first conference loss since
1953, will attempt to start another winning streak Saturday when
the Stanford Indians invade Los Angeles.
Oregon State, still posing as a formidable Rose Bowl threat, put
an end to Red Sanders' 19-game victory string in PCC action with a

21-7 triumph on Saturday. The
last time the Bruins had lost in
conference play was in 1953, when
they suffered a 21-20 setback to
Bobby Garrett and Stanford.
UCLA hopes to duplicate its
last meeting with the Cards in
the Coliseum. In that game, in
1954, the Uclans more than gained
revenge for the previous loss by
handing Stanford its worst defeat
in history, 72-0. Last season the
Indians spotted the Bruins a 21-0
lead before going down in respect
able fashion, 21-13.
Outlook Brightened
The Card outlook was bright
ened yesterday by the return to
action of Tackle Steve Docter.
Docter, injured in the Michigan
State game, will help relieve the
load on Troy Barbee in the left
tackle slot. Still missing from
that position is John Kidd, who
is expected to be out for at least
another week.
Wingback Paul Camera is still
on the doubtful list. The ace In
dian pass receiver injured his
back late in last Saturday's game,
but not before turning in another
outstanding performance. Came
ra lost his PCC pass - receiving
lead, llbwever, to Washington
State's Bill Steiger. Paul has 24
receptions to Steiger's 26.
While having no one of quite
the caliber of Paul Camera, Primo
Villanueva, Sam Brown or Ron
nie Knox, UCLA is still well for
tified in the key tailback slot ftf
their single-wing offense. Sopho
more Don Long, a star of earlier
games this season, and Edison
Griffin, who started last week
against OSC, will be handling
most of the duties in the triple
threat position.
Pleasant Surprise
Sophomore Barry Billington
has been a pleasant surprise at
fullback. He's cracked the line for
257 yards so far this season.
Rounding out the starting back
field for the Uclans will be Don
Shinnick at blocking back and
Louis Elias at wingback.
The Bruins are blessed with a
wealth of talent, headed by Senior
Pete O'Garro, at end. Backing
him up are Dick Wallen, Ihe
team's top receiver with 17 recep
tions. At right wing are Juniors
Hal Smith and Pat Pinkston.
