# Speedy Guard Expects Return To Card Line
## 
### Ted Heckathorn 
One of the Cards' fastest men
is guard Armand DeWeese De-
Weese has not seen much action
since early in the season because
he was injured in Ihe Michigan
State game, but he did play some
against USC.
He hopes that he will be able
to play a lot this week in the
UCLA game to help avenge last
year's loss to the Uclans. "UCLA
definitely is not as strong as it
was a year ago," says DeWeese.
The speedy lineman attended
University High School in Los
Angeles. In 1954 he played on
the Stanford frosh football team
and threw the discus for the
frosh track team until he injured
his shoulder.
Last year in football, as a soph
omore, DeWeese played a great
deal during the last half of the
season and earned his varsity let
ter. He played most of the game
in the 21-13 loss to UCLA, and
helped to stop the Bruins' great
running attack.
On defense the junior' guard
plays middle line-backer. "When
those single-wing teams put two
men on, the one man must fight
off the two men and still try to
stop the play. The line-backers
have two men on them nearly ev
ery play, so we don't have a dull
moment," â€¢comments DeWeese
about his position.
Football is not his only inter
est; he belongs to the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity,, and he is in the
NROTC program. His main hob
by is sailing and he has a small
boat of his own.
If DeWeese can av'oid injuries
many think that he will be one of
Stanford's top linemen. The In
dian coaching staff certainly
hopes so because the Cards have
some important games coming
up, and they want as many line
men available as possible.
