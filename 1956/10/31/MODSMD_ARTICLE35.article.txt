# Frosh Uninjured in USC Tilt; Uclan Line, Runners a Threat
## Honeywell Top Frosh Runner With 139 Yards; Badly Injured Brubabes Have 22-Man Squad 
### Bob Payne 
With Southern California easily disposed of, the Stanford. Pa
pooses move into the middle third of their schedule this Saturday in
Los Angeles against the UCLA frosh.
The Papooses came out of last week's clash with nary an injury,
but second-string right end Bill Brown suffered a severely sprained

ankle in Monday's practice and
appears to be out for teh UC
LA game. Left end Chris Bur
ford, who caught one touchdown
pass Saturday, has been in the
rest home with tonsillitis.
UCLA has one of its thinnest
freshman squads in years. Coach
Johny Johnson has only 22 men
left for the remainder of the sea
son. But the Brubabes battled a
reputedly "loaded" California
frosh team last week before go
ing down, 13-6.
John Adams, 230-pound block
buster from San Diego Hoover,
heads the L.A. single-wing attack
at tailback. The former All-South
ern Section <CIF> star runs Ihe
100-yard dash in 10 seconds flat.
Ray Smith has been another
backfield standout at fullback.
He tallied the lone UCLA touch
down in the Cal game.
The Uclan line is big, although
not quite as plethoric as USC's.
End Don Aveller is the only man
under 190 pounds. Stalwarts in
the forward wall are right guard
Rod Cochran and center Harry
Baldwin.
Quarterback Sid Garber, who
didn't cinch the starting role
until Dick Norman was injured
last week, was commended by
Coach Ghilotti. "Garber isn't a
great passer yet, but he'll im
prove. He has very good men to
throw to. As a runner and field
general, he did a terrific job."
The Papoose ground attack, ex
pected to be potent, left little to
be desired. The fleet Card rush
ers rolled up 315 yards, fullback
Jim Honeywell personaly gaining
139â€”50 more than the entire Tro
babe backfield. Pete Fitzgerald
and Mac Wylie contributed 62
and 59 yards, respectively.
