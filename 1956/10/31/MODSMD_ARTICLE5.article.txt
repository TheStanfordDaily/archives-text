# Hoover Libe Gets Chinese Red Literature
## 
### 
Hoover Library will receive the
largest shipment of Communist
Chinese periodicals and hooks
ever to come through the Bam
boo Curtain by the end of this
week.
The material, about .1000 items
collected by Americans in China
between 1947 and 1949, was
screened and cleared for ship
ment by the Communists, accord
ing to Dr. PJaston- Rothwell, direc
tor of the library.
The literature has been stored
in Peiping since the Communists
banned the export of books and
periodicals in 1949, Rothwell said.
He believes the Communists sent
the documents to the library in
exchange for medical books
which the library sent at the re
quest of the Chinese government.
The shipment includes early
historical data of Chinese upris
ings and revolutions, propaganda
leaflets and pamphlets distribut
ed during the instigation of Com
munist control.
Periodicals of the late 1920s
and 1930s which Rothwell called
"extremely valuable sources of
information concerning people
living and acting today" are in
cluded.
The shipment will be added to
the 40,000 items already in the li
brary dealing with Chinese his
tory. Rothwell said Hoover Li
brary has "probably the best col
lection that exists outside modern
China."
