## Flan to Occupy Suez 'Grave,' Soviets Warn Britain, France Veto U.S. Peace Proposal In Security Council 
### 
J
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct.
30 (UPt—Russia warned Britain
and France tonight that their
plans to occupy the Suez Canal
Zone "can lead to grave conse
quences for all mankind."
The Soviet warning came in
the United Nations Security
Council after Britain and France,
in a major policy split with the
United States, twice used the v£to
to block an order for a cease-fire
in the Palestine fighting and the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from
Egypt.
The Soviet warning came from
Soviet Ambassador Arkady A.
Soholev shortly before the Secu
rity Council adjourned at 11:04
p.m. (EST) until 3 p.m. (EST)
tomorrow without taking any ac
tion on Egypt's complaint against
the Anglo-French ultimatum to
admit Anglo-French troops to the
Suez Zone or face the occupation
of key towns by force.
Emergency Session
Shortly before the adjourn
ment, Yugoslavia asked the Coun
cil to "consider the possibility of
calling an emergency session of
the UN General Assembly." But
Yugoslav Ambassador Joza.Brilej
said the idea was an informal
proposal and did not press it.
First, Britain and France ve
toed an American resolution
which contained a call to all coun
tries to refrain from the use or
threat of force in the Middle East
and to cut off military, economic
and financial aid to Israel until it
ended its invasion of Egypt,
This would have thwarted the
plans of Britain and France to
carry out their threat to occupy,
by force if necessary, key posi
tions in the Canal Zone to protect
the 101-mile strategic waterway.
Second Veto
Then, when Russia resubmitted
the resolution without the objec
tionable clauses, Britain and
France again vetoed it, declaring
the cease-fire-and-withdrawal call
was "inappropriate in the circum
stances."
The Council then turned to the
discussion demanded by Egypt of
the ultimatum served on the
Egyptians and Israelis by Britain
and France today.
Egyptians Ambassador Omar
Loufti said Britain and France
had "used their vote of the veto
twice in order not to be ham
strung by decisions of the Coun
cil which might have prevented
fulfillment of the aggressive de
signs when Israel attacked
Egypt."
Soholev told the Council:
"The Council has not empow
ered either Britain or France to
take unilateral action, let alone
military action.
"What is at hand is a patent at
tempt to circumvent the Security
Council in order to seize the Suez
Canal with armed might . . .
What is involved is a carefully
laid plan for the canal's seizure."


CRITICAL AREA —Israeli troops pulled hack last night from the
Sinai Desert and Gaza after agreeing to the U.S.-proposed cease
fire, but Britain and France began a dawn invasion of the Suez
Canal zone. At the same time Egypt rejected the peace ultimatum
and announced it planned to continue fighting.
