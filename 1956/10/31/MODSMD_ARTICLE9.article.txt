# Japan's Trend Is to Pre-War Status, Says Professor Ukai
## American Reforms Lacked Understanding Of Culture, Says Tuesday Series Speaker 
### 
"Since Japan became independent in 1952, there has been a trend
to return to the good old days of pre-war Japan," said Nobushige
Ukai last night.
Ukai, a visiting professor in the political science and law depart
ments here, said, in essence, that the "Effect of American Reforms

on Japanese Law and Institu
tions" has amounted to failure.
He pointed out to his Tuesday
Series audience that the Ameri
cans sent with the occupation of
Japan had very little knowledge
of the traditions and culture of
that country.
"There is a radical difference
between Western countries where
principles of freedom have been
long established and in Japan
where they are of very recent ori
gin," said Ukai. "Japan has been
accustomed to severe restrictions
of liberty."
Professor Ukai said that the
goal of the new ruling class after
the Meiji Restoration of the late
19th century was technical devel
opment. Japan did not try to
transplant philosophical or idea
logical ideals of the Western
world.
"Ideology of a past authority
must be eradicated before educa
tional reforms will be complete,"
he said. "Remnants of the feu
dalism ideology are strong."
He warned that an extreme
rightist or leftist could indoctrin
ate the youth to his way of think
ing by imposing state-controlled
texts in the schools.
"If political-freedom is restrict
ed demoracy will be lost," he
said.
