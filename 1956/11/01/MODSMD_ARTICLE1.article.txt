## Rebels Order All Russ From Entire Country By New Year, or War 
### 
VIENNA. Oct. 31 (UP)—The
last elements of the Russian
army pulled out of shattered Bu
dapest today antl left it to the
rebels.
The rebels promptly demanded
Soviet withdrawal from the en
tire country by Now Year's Eve
under threat of renewed warfare.
Soviet tanks which stood guard
aro un d the Communist party
headquarters, the secret police
building and parliament moved
into convoys and left the city at
3 p.m. There was no indication
of their destination. In their
wake, clashes broke out between
rebels and diehard members of
the Hungarian secret police
(AVH).
As the Russians clanked out,
Joseph Cardinal Minds/.enty, 64-
year-old Catholic primate of Hun
gary, drove in with a tank escort
to resume his duties after more
than seven years of Communist
imprisonment as a traitor.
Good Health
He reported that despite seri
ous illness while in captivity, he
was "both physically and men
tally in good health." Reports
sprang up that he would be called
upon to help form a new govern
ment.
Budapest Radio broadcast the
news that the regime of Premier
Imre N a g y had declared the
charges against the cardinal
"null and void."
The radio also broadcast the
eight-point manifesto of the .joint
revolutionary tribunal of the
Hungarian armed forces and the
civilian revolutionary tribunal
which threatened to oust Russian
troops by force from Hungary if
they did not leave voluntarily by
Dec. 31.
End Warsaw Pact
The manifesto also demanded
an end to the Warsaw Pact, the
Communist answer to NATO,
and the take-over by the Hunga
rian army within a week of the
Russian • run uranium mines in
Hungary.
The two tribunals, which repre
sent virtually all rebel forces,
also called for immediate dissolu
tion of the hated secret police,
and continued diplomatic rela
tions with the Soviet Union. But
friendship must not be the pre
text for continued maintenance
of Russian troops on Hungarian
soil, they said.
The Russians still in the city
early today appeared oblivious to
the fighting still going on. The
strong Russian forces in the shat
tered downtown district had all
pulled out by dawn, except for
one group in a seven - block
stretch from the chain bridge,
main connecting link over the
Danube River dividing Buda ami
Pest. By 9 a.m. they, too, were
gone.

Soviet withdrawal from the en
tire country by Now Year's Eve
under threat of renewed warfare.
Soviet tanks which stood guard
aro un d the Communist party
headquarters, the secret police
building and parliament moved
into convoys and left the city at
3 p.m. There was no indication
of their destination. In their
wake, clashes broke out between
rebels and diehard members of
the Hungarian secret police
(AVH).
As the Russians clanked out,
Joseph Cardinal Minds/.enty, 64-
year-old Catholic primate of Hun
gary, drove in with a tank escort
to resume his duties after more
than seven years of Communist
imprisonment as a traitor.
Good Health
He reported that despite seri
ous illness while in captivity, he
was "both physically and men
tally in good health." Reports
sprang up that he would be called
upon to help form a new govern
ment.
Budapest Radio broadcast the
news that the regime of Premier
Imre N a g y had declared the
charges against the cardinal
"null and void."
The radio also broadcast the
eight-point manifesto of the .joint
revolutionary tribunal of the
Hungarian armed forces and the
civilian revolutionary tribunal
which threatened to oust Russian
troops by force from Hungary if
they did not leave voluntarily by
Dec. 31.
End Warsaw Pact
The manifesto also demanded
an end to the Warsaw Pact, the
Communist answer to NATO,
and the take-over by the Hunga
rian army within a week of the
Russian • run uranium mines in
Hungary.
The two tribunals, which repre
sent virtually all rebel forces,
also called for immediate dissolu
tion of the hated secret police,
and continued diplomatic rela
tions with the Soviet Union. But
friendship must not be the pre
text for continued maintenance
of Russian troops on Hungarian
soil, they said.
The Russians still in the city
early today appeared oblivious to
the fighting still going on. The
strong Russian forces in the shat
tered downtown district had all
pulled out by dawn, except for
one group in a seven - block
stretch from the chain bridge,
main connecting link over the
Danube River dividing Buda ami
Pest. By 9 a.m. they, too, were
gone.
