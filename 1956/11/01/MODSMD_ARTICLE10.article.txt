threatens the United States and the entire world because ot the
Eisenhower administration's foreign policy.

Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles "bear a heavy responsibil
ity" for the Middle East situation.
"War now threatens the United
States and the entire world be
cause of the shortcomings of the
Republican foreign policy." Ste
! venson said at a Union Square
rally forced indoors because of
inclement weather.
He said the Eisenhower admin
istration has lost the friendship it
sought with the Arab world and
also the confidence of Israel. He
also said the administration stood
by idly while Russia supplied
arms to Egypt and gained a foot
hold in the Middle East
".Inst Plain Deceit"
Earlier, in a rally in New
York's garment district, Steven
son accused the Eisenhower ad
ministration of ".just plain de
ceit" in domestic policies and
added:
"The politics of misrepresenla-
I tion h;i s operated constantly in
'>ur foreign policy, 100.
"Only a short time ago, my op-
I ponent assured us that there was
good news from Suez. I wonder
I if he really didn't know how bad
i tho situation was in the Middle
East or if he did know and
I decided the American people
1 shouldn't know.
"Unhappily, the vaecilations,
j the uncertainties, appeasements
j and provocations of the Eisen
i hower Dulles policy bear a heavy
responsibility for the crisis in the
Middle East."

On the domestic front. Steven
i son charged, measures have been
passed by Congress over Repub-
I lie,in opposition and then claimed
I by President Eisenhower as Re

know whether President Eisen
hower endorses the Supreme
Court desegregation policy.

NEW YORK, Oct. 31 (UP) —Adlai Stevenson said today war
threatens the United States and the entire world because ot the
Eisenhower administration's foreign policy.
In his strongest accusation to date on the Middle East crisis, the
Democratic presidential nominee said President Eisenhower and

Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles "bear a heavy responsibil
ity" for the Middle East situation.
"War now threatens the United
States and the entire world be
cause of the shortcomings of the
Republican foreign policy." Ste
! venson said at a Union Square
rally forced indoors because of
inclement weather.
He said the Eisenhower admin
istration has lost the friendship it
sought with the Arab world and
also the confidence of Israel. He
also said the administration stood
by idly while Russia supplied
arms to Egypt and gained a foot
hold in the Middle East
".Inst Plain Deceit"
Earlier, in a rally in New
York's garment district, Steven
son accused the Eisenhower ad
ministration of ".just plain de
ceit" in domestic policies and
added:
"The politics of misrepresenla-
I tion h;i s operated constantly in
'>ur foreign policy, 100.
"Only a short time ago, my op-
I ponent assured us that there was
good news from Suez. I wonder
I if he really didn't know how bad
i tho situation was in the Middle
East or if he did know and
I decided the American people
1 shouldn't know.
"Unhappily, the vaecilations,
j the uncertainties, appeasements
j and provocations of the Eisen
i hower Dulles policy bear a heavy
responsibility for the crisis in the
Middle East."
