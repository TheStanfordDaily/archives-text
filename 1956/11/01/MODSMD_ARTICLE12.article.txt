## Cairo Reports Four Bases, Key Cities Bombed by Jets Assault Results From Arab Rejection Of Anglo-French Cease-Fire Ultimatum 
### 
LONDON. Thursday, Nov. 1 <UP i â€” Britain struck against Egypt
by air and by sea today, and the entire Egyptian nation was put on
a war footing.
British jet bombers based on the island of Cyprus struck at four
air bases in Egypt, and a British cruiser sank an Egyptian frigate

in the Gulf of Suez, according to I
Allied communiques.
An Egyptian communique is-'
sued in Cairo today said seven
persons were killed in a bombing
raid on Cairo yesterday. It said
there also had been raids on the
key Egyptian cities of Suez, Is
mailia, Port Said and Alexandria.
Blackouts were ordered through
out the area.
Egyptian authorities said Egypt
had officially informed the Unit
ed Nations Security Council in
New York that Britain and France
had attacked its territory. An
emergency meeting of the UN
General Assembly was set for 5
p.m. (EST) in New York city to
morrow.
Last-Chance Warning
The British assault came as a
last-chance warning that Britain
and France will seize the Suez
Canal unless Egypt accepts their
ultimatum to halt its war with
Israel.
An Admiralty communique is
sued early today by Anglo-French
allied headquarters on the island
of Cyprus said the 8800-ton New
foundland sank the frigate, weigh
ing 1000 to 1300 tons, when the
smaller vessel refused to answer
a challenge or stop when ordered.
The announcement said surviv
ors from the frigate were taken
aboard the Newfoundland.
An official communique from
allied forces headquarters on Cy
prus announced British jets had
bombed four air bases in Egypt.
Cairo Announces Bombing
This followed a Cairo radio an
nouncement that five Egyptian
cities, including Cairo, had been
hit in the first British air attack,
launched from Cyprus only min
utes after British Prime Minister
Anthony Eden said the Anglo-
French ultimatum to Egypt to
stop fighting was "still open."
The air communique said Brit
ish bombers had made concentrat
ed attacks on Egyptian air fields
last night. The fields were iden
tified as Almaza and Inchass, near
Cairo, and Abu-Sueir and Fanara,
in the canal zone.
The targets were lit up by flares
and were clearly visible, the com
munique said. All the bombers
returned safely to their base, it
said, although there was some op
position from antiaircraft guns.
Denies Cairo Bombing
British Foreign Minister Selwyn
Lloyd made it clear that Britain
still hoped Egypt would reverse
her earlier rejection of the Anglo-
French ultimatum. He told the
House of Commons late last night
that the first air attacks were
meant to show Egypt that Britain
and France meant business with
their Suez invasion threat. Lloyd
denied that Cairo had been
bombed.
Lloyd heatedly denied Russian
charges that Britain and France
had conspired with Israel in the
attack on Egypt.
"It is quite wrong to state that
Israel was incited to this action
by the United Kingdom govern
ment," Lloyd said. "There was no
prior agreement between us
about it."
Amphibious forces were stream
ing across the Mediterranean to
ward Suez aboard British and
French naval units, hut the An
glo-French official announce
ments made it clear that only air I
forces had been in action so far.
