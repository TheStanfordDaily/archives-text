# Failures in Diplomacy

However relieved the country may he that,
there will he no "United States involvement"'
in the Middle East fighting, President Eisen
hower's. speech yesterday afternoon was a sad
reflection on the critical and tragic lack of
leadership this country offers the world.
It may well he asked, "What can we do
now.' 1 And it seems, as the President said, ( our
only access to peace is through the United
I\aliijnls.,. however impotent that hody has heen
rendered by the fiasco of the last few days.
112 Hp tragedy is that we maneuvered ourselves
into this position in the first place by earning
Ih »■ reputation for reacting passively to world
events rather than, in any way, trying to stem
the tide that eventually leads to conflagration
of this type.
Perhaps we could take hold action now by
threatening Britain and France with armed
opposition if they should continue their push
into Suez, hut would they believe we were
dct ermined enough to follow up our bluster
with action? Our past vacillating, "talk hard
hot act soft policy has done nothing but en
courage our enemies and befuddle onr allies
to the point of frustration.
l'.isenhower blames the British and French

for taking unilateral action without consulta
tion with the United States, but—and well the
British and French may ask —how often has
the Uniled States jumped off half-cocked with
out consulting them? How often have we
involved them in predicaments not of their own
choosing and then withdrawn to a cloistgr of
virtual international seclusion, as in the case
of the Baghdad Pact, virtual endorsement of
Colonel Nasser during his rise to power, and
the whole melee in the Middle East?
True, the British and French should not have
resorted to force, hut it is a poor testimony of
American diplomacy that the liaison among
Western powers should have dissolved to the
extent that they should feel the necessity to
defy the leadership of the United States. It is
difficult to assume that independent-minded
countries will passively sit and await American
action that, from experience, they know will
never come.
Presuming that the British and French will
he successful in their drive to take over the
Suez Canal, where will the United States stand
then? ill we tacitly sanction their action
which is, in essence, sanctioning open aggres
sion, against which we have always committed
ourselves?
