Political intf.rf.st n\ campus being dull as
it is, one would think every opportunity to
.'•park a latent interest would be jumped upon
with vigor by campus political groups.
Rut such was not the case with Tuesday's
Political I nion meeting where Richard Rich
ards, I .S. senatorial candidate, spoke to a group
of about 30 students in the I heta Chi house—
freshman men excluded.
Recause ol the so-called "no-contact rule 1 '
amon;.' fraternities, one provision of which is
that no male freshman may enter a fraternity
house except during regular rushing periods,
freshman men were not allowed to attend the
meeting. I rue, they could have heard Itichards
o*« i a loud-speaker from the sidewalk, hut few
would consider it worth the effort to brave the
v. iml, rain and general discomfiture to hear a
hall-hour talk over a loud-speaker when they
eonld hear the same rr er the radio at almost
any time.
\\ hat they did miss was the educational op
portunity of meeting an important candidate

face to face, talking with him and judging It is
political intelligence anil sincerity from a per-
Honal perspective.
The no-contact rule was devised to prevent
fraternities from indulging in rushing over a
prolonged period of time, hut vvc don't imagine
Richards was attempting to throw a rushing
pitch lor I heta Chi. Just as Cuhherley might
have been used had Richards been able to
speak at any other lime than noon, the house
was merely throwing its doors open to a Po
litical Union function.
We suspect there was a lack of liaison be
tween the Political Union and the Interfra
ternity Council, which handles such fraternity
matters. According to IFC President Spike
Wilson, the rule might he liberally interpreted
in a case such as this, and justly so, hut no effort
was made to permit freshmen to attend.
We suggest that when, because of demands
of time and space, it is necessary to hold such
a function at a fraternity house, freshmen he
allowed to come in off the sidewalks along with
everyone else.
