## Britain and France Forced to Protect Suez Interests Before Consulting U.S. 
### Dave Scott 
Great Britain and France were
forced to take the initiative in the
Suez action because the United
States policy of waiting for time
| would have been "disastrous," ac
| cording to English foreign schol
ar Bryan Cartledge.
"I personally regret very much
that Eden and Mollet did not
think it necessary to consult the
United States before taking ac
tion," he said. "But once a ma
terial threat to the canal had
arisen, Great Britain and France
had to act with all possible speed
in order to avert it.
"Unfortunately, the conduct of
American policy throughout the
Suez crisis had given us no
grounds for hope that the United
States would co-operate with us
in taking measures which are es
sentia I to our economic security.
U.S. "Shifting"
"The United States has shifted
from one uneasy compromise to
another, with the object of gain
ing time, part of this stalling due
of course to the election next
week."
Cartledge doubted that the sit
uation would mean any perma
nent hostility between the United
States and the two Western al
lies. "The Soviet Union obviously
is trying to drive a wedge be
tween your country and ours, but
obviously we value our alliances
with you quite highly."
Great Britain vetoed the United
States and Russian proposals in
the Security Council because
"their tone implied Israel wasn't
the aggressor and neither resolu
tion guaranteed ultimate free
passage on the Canal.
Common Policy
"This conflict in many ways is
good, though. It has brought our
differences out into the open and
has shown the importance of
working out a common policy.
"So far Mr. Dulles has left us
constantly guessing. At one mo
ment we think he is 100 per cent
behind us and ready to back us to
the hilt and the next moment he
turns his back on us."
Cartledge said the aim of the
Suez occupation was to insulate
a vital international waterway
from the Israeli - Egyptian con
flict. "The canal is vital to our
economy and also by the occupa
tion we split Egypt and are more
apt to force them to agree to our>
terms.
"The Anglo - French action is
justified by the Tripartite Agree
ment of 1950 under which we and
the United States agreed to take
action both within and outside

the UN lo prevent any violation
of frontiers and armistice lines.
"It is also Justified by the
terms of the British withdrawal
from the Suez zone, in which the
United Kingdom reserved the
right to return her troops should
the canal be threatened. A large
quantity of military supplies
were left in the zone, in prepara
tion for just this kind of emer
gency.
"Both Egypt and Israel were
given the opportunity to allow us
to safeguard the canal peacefully.
Israel accepted it, but Egypt an
nounced she would fight. Great

Britain has consequently been
compelled to neutralize the mili
tary installations and airfields
from which attacks on our land
ing would be launched.
"When I first heard of the ac
tion, it took me by complete sur
prise, but now that I think about
it, it was the only logical thing
for us to do."
Cartledge terms "ridiculous"
the charge that Great Britain and
France are backing Israel's at
tack on Egypt. "I know that some
people think we are supplying Is
rael with arms and advice for
their raid, so we can have an ex
cuse to take over the Suez, but I
hardly think we are that villain
ous."
Car)ledge said the troops would
stay until an armistice had been
made and a decision made on the
future administration of the wa
terway. "I have no idea how long
this will be."
He concluded by saying that
t lie action could well spell Prime
Minister Anthony Eden's political
doom. "He was condemned early
this year by members of his own
party for taking no action, and
now the Labor party is solidly op
posed to him for taking the ac
tion.
"He has only a 55-vote margin
in Parliament, and there are un
doubtedly more than 55 Conserv
atives opposed to his policy. The
people of the country are pretty
well split on the issue."
