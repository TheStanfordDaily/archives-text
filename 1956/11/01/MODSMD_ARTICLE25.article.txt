# Indians Seek to Break UCLA's String Of Homecoming Day Triumphs Saturday
## Taylor to Start Camera; 4 Bruins End Seasons In Coliseum Showdown 
### Dave Canfield 
UCLA's Bruins will bo after
Iheir seventh straight Homecom
ing Day win Saturday—and de
railment of Stanford's Rose Bowl
Express in the process.
Stanford Coach Chuck Taylor
increased hopes for an Indian
viclory yesterday when he said
Paul Camera, pass-snagging half
hack, will definitely he in the
starting lineup against UCLA.
Whirlpool treatments this week
have taken the stiffness out of
the ace receiver's hack, Taylor
said.
Last time UCLA lost a Home
coming game was in 1949 when
California tin ned the trick, .'-55-21.
A victory would also be Coach
Red Sanders' 22nd straight in Los
Angeles Coliseum. IJCLA last fell
in the Coliseum to SC, 14-12, in
1952.
The Bruins from Westwood
also are gunning for their third
win over 1 the Indians in a row and
their fifth in seven years over
the Tribe.
Sanders has dropped only two
tilts to the Indians in his career.
With four Bruins closing out the
five-game final seasons of their
collegiate careers Saturday, the
UCLA coach will he in no mood
for defeat.
Departing: Seniors
The four departing seniors are
captain and guard Don Birren,
end Pete O'Garro, wing b a cl<
Chuck Holloway and tackle Pres
ton Dills.
O'Garro, team leader in inter
ceptions, is one of the outstand
ing men in the talented Bruin
pass defense that Westwood
hopefuls think will stop Card
quarterback John Brodie.
In yesterday's practice in West
wood, though, UCLA's defensive
team worked out against Indian
pass patterns and failed to stop
them. Mimicking Brodie was
Doug Bradley who has ended his
five games.
But the men to watch Saturday
have plenty of eligibility left.
Though only a sophomore, left
end Dick Wallen has hauled in 17
passes for 193 yards and two
touchdowns.
That is only seven fewer ae
rials than the number bagged by
Camera. Camera is the Pacific
Coast Conference's number two
receiver.
Four Passers
But UCLA's four passers have
"not quite" equaled Brodie's phe
nomenal aerial record. Between
them, left halfbacks Bradley,
Don Long, Kirk "Wilson and Edi
son Griffin have thrown enough
pigskins into the smog-filled air
for 620 yards and three touch
downs.
Brodie is far ahead of this
Bruin quartet with 9(59 yards and
10 six-pointers.
But the Westwood eleven hopes
to make up in running what they
lack irr passing. With fullback
Barry Billing ton and Long
ploughing opponents' lines to
shreds, the Bruins have amassed
924 yards and 12 TDs rushing.
Billington, the 170-pound Ingle
wood Express, is the player the
Uclans are counting on for future
years. He is only a sophomore
but has averaged more than four
yards a carry this year.

That is only seven fewer ae
rials than the number bagged by
Camera. Camera is the Pacific
Coast Conference's number two
receiver.
Four Passers
But UCLA's four passers have
"not quite" equaled Brodie's phe
nomenal aerial record. Between
them, left halfbacks Bradley,
Don Long, Kirk "Wilson and Edi
son Griffin have thrown enough
pigskins into the smog-filled air
for 620 yards and three touch
downs.
Brodie is far ahead of this
Bruin quartet with 9(59 yards and
10 six-pointers.
But the Westwood eleven hopes
to make up in running what they
lack irr passing. With fullback
Barry Billing ton and Long
ploughing opponents' lines to
shreds, the Bruins have amassed
924 yards and 12 TDs rushing.
Billington, the 170-pound Ingle
wood Express, is the player the
Uclans are counting on for future
years. He is only a sophomore
but has averaged more than four
yards a carry this year.

UCLA's Bruins will bo after
Iheir seventh straight Homecom
ing Day win Saturday—and de
railment of Stanford's Rose Bowl
Express in the process.
Stanford Coach Chuck Taylor
increased hopes for an Indian
viclory yesterday when he said
Paul Camera, pass-snagging half
hack, will definitely he in the
starting lineup against UCLA.
Whirlpool treatments this week
have taken the stiffness out of
the ace receiver's hack, Taylor
said.
Last time UCLA lost a Home
coming game was in 1949 when
California tin ned the trick, .'-55-21.
A victory would also be Coach
Red Sanders' 22nd straight in Los
Angeles Coliseum. IJCLA last fell
in the Coliseum to SC, 14-12, in
1952.
The Bruins from Westwood
also are gunning for their third
win over 1 the Indians in a row and
their fifth in seven years over
the Tribe.
Sanders has dropped only two
tilts to the Indians in his career.
With four Bruins closing out the
five-game final seasons of their
collegiate careers Saturday, the
UCLA coach will he in no mood
for defeat.
Departing: Seniors
The four departing seniors are
captain and guard Don Birren,
end Pete O'Garro, wing b a cl<
Chuck Holloway and tackle Pres
ton Dills.
O'Garro, team leader in inter
ceptions, is one of the outstand
ing men in the talented Bruin
pass defense that Westwood
hopefuls think will stop Card
quarterback John Brodie.
In yesterday's practice in West
wood, though, UCLA's defensive
team worked out against Indian
pass patterns and failed to stop
them. Mimicking Brodie was
Doug Bradley who has ended his
five games.
But the men to watch Saturday
have plenty of eligibility left.
Though only a sophomore, left
end Dick Wallen has hauled in 17
passes for 193 yards and two
touchdowns.
That is only seven fewer ae
rials than the number bagged by
Camera. Camera is the Pacific
Coast Conference's number two
receiver.
