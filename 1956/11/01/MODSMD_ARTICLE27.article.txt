# Taylor Refutes Any Accusations Charged to Him
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor last night
denied any accusations attributed
to him concerning last week's
UCLA-OSC tangle.
Taylor said his remarks about
the Bruins' performance were
misinterpreted if people got the
idea he meant that UCLA did not
play its top men and play to win
against the Beavers to save them
for this week's Stanford game.
"I certainly don't think I said
anything like that," Taylor re
ported. "If I did say it, I cer
tainly did not mean it in any
sense that UCLA did not play its
best men or wasn't trying to
win."
In a prepared statement he is
sued, Taylor said, "It was cer
tainly not my intention to reflect
discredit on UCLA. If Coach San
ders believes my statements indi
cate this, I hope he will accept
my apology and my declaration
that such a reflection was not in
tended by me."
Sanders had said earlier he was
shocked and amazed by the state
ment attributed to Taylor.
"It's hard for me to believe
that Chuck Taylor could say any
thing like that," Sanders said.
"But whatever he said, we'll have
all our players in there on Sat
urday for Stanford. We won't
pull out any, and 1 hope he does
n't either."
Coach Taylor will speak on
KCBS radio program "This Week
in Stanford Sports" lonight at
8:45 to clarify the misinterpreta
tion further.
