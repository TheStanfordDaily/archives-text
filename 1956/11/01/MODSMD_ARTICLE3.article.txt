# Law Seniors Compete Tonight In Moot Court Final Round
## Moot Court Trial to Decide Whether Broad Or Narrow Insanity Test Should Be Used 
### 
Handling the appeal of an imaginary murder conviction, four law
school seniors will vie tonight in Ihc finals of the moot court com
petition. Robert C. Dedekam and Robert D. Prior will represent the
defendant. Representing the state will be Laurence K. Brown and I
William E. Murane.
Issues are whether a narrow or broad test of insanity should be

used and whether premeditation
and deliberation were present.
This problem is in a developing I
area of law. It involves a very j
old rule: a conflict between an j
old test of insanity and a new one.
The new one says that the act
may be a product of mental dis
order.
This whole question of insanity j
is an open one, due to some recent
decisions. It is a live issue in the
courts today.
The four seniors reached the
finals of the Marion Rice Kirk
wood Moot Court Competition in
eliminations last spring.
Tonight's moot court session
will begin at 8:30 in the Moot
Court Room. The public is in
vited.
Students will be competing for
a first prize of $100, second of $50 :
and third and fourth of $25 each.
Prizes arc posted by the Stanford
Law Society of Northern Califor
nia and Nevada.
Winning team will qualify for,
regional eliminations in the na
tional moot court competition.
Arguments will be heard by the
Hon. Marshall F. McComb, associ
ate justice of the California Su
preme Court; the Hon. Raymond
E. Peters, justice of the California
District Court of Appeals; and the
Hon. Murray Draper, judge, Su
