# Center Long Is Among Top Card Linemen
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Take it from Bob Long, "it's I
great to be back" in the football j
wars after being out most of the
season with mononucleosis. Long,
Stanford's first-string center, re
turned to his post Saturday as
the Indians upset Southern Cali
fornia.
Recognized as one of the
Tribe's top linemen, he is set to
go against UCLA Saturday in
Los Angeles in what is the sec
ond of five straight crucial games
for Stanford.
Predicts Win
Long thinks the Indians can
come out on top with a 100 per
cent effort against the Bruins.
He figures UCLA's line to be
faster than the SC forward wall,
but doesn't think the Uclan backs
are quite as good as the Trojan
duo of Jon Arnett and C. R. Rob
erts.
Originally from Burbank High
School in Southern California,
the 6-foot, 204-pounder quickly
decided to come to Stanford after
seeing the campus and talking
with head grid coach Chuck Tay
lor.
At Burbank. Long was named
to the All-Foothill League team
his junior and senior years, and
was an All-CIF selection at center
his senior season.
Third Vear
This is his third year on the
Stanford varsity. Both of Long's
two biggest thrills during this
time have been against SC: first,
upsetting the Trojans 28-20 last
year at the Coliseum, and then
| knocking them off last Saturday.
Long is a strong believer in thte
idea that football helps train for
future life by putting the player
in stiff competition and heavy
| pressure situations. Although it's
a lot of work, he also has a lot
of fun playing.
The love of football has carried
over into Long's career goals.
