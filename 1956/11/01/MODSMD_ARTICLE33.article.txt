Stanford Research Institute
will open a European offire in
Zurich, Switzerland, shortly alter
Jan. 1, according to Dr. Weldon
B. Gibson.
The decision to esfablish the
facility was "largely in response
to mounting requests for Insti
tute services in Western Europe
that could best be met with a
central location and resident
staff," said Dr. Gibson.
Heading the new office will be
Dr. Robert M. Burns, a senior sci
entific adviser on SRl's staff.
