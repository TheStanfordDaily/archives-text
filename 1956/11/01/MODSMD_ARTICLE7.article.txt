# UN Assembly To Meet Today On Middle East
## Hammarskjold Calls 76 Nations to Debate Anglo-French Actions 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct.
.Si (UP) The United Nations
OonnÂ»-ni Assembly tonight was
called into emergency session to
morrow to deal with the Middle
Eastern crisis.
The summons came as Presi
dent Eisenhower pledged that the
United States would work through
the General Assembly for peace
in the Middle East and Indian
Premier' Jawaharlal Nehru plead
ed for "strong steps" to prevent
the world from "plunging into
war."
U.N. Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold summoned the 7fi
nation Assembly for a meeting at
5 p.m. (ESTI tomorrow on in
structions of the Security Coun
cil, which was hopelessly paralyz
ed by two British-French vetoes.
Nehru Message
Nehru sent an urgent message
to Hammarskjold through his am
bassador here.
"I earnestly trust that the Unit
ed Nations will take strong steps
in this matter to prevent the
world plunging into war, and de
mand immediate withdrawal of
all foreign troops from Egypt,"
Nehru said.
The General Assembly was
summoned to take up both the
fighting between Israel and Egypt
and Anglo-French intervention.
Britain and France opposed the
call. Australia and Belgium ah
stained in a 7-2 vote. The U.S.,
Russia, China, Cuba, Peru, Iran
and Yugoslavia favored an emer
gency session.
The decision to call the Assem
bly was made after the Security
Council was paralyzed by two
British-French vetoes of resolu
tions on the Suez Canal crisis.
The two Western allies first ve
toed a U.S. resolution and tlien a
Russian resolution, both of which
were designed to halt Middle East
ern hostilities.
U.N. Rules
Under U.N. rules, the Assembly
can be called into session when
the Security Council becomes bog
ged down by a veto. There is no
veto in the Assembly, nor can it
issue orders as the Security Coun
cil can.
It can make recommendations,
however, and then depends on
world opinion to enforce them.
The decision to call the Asscm
bly came just before President
Eisenhower announced the U.S.
will work through the General
Assembly for peace in the Middle
East.
British Ambassador Sir Pierson
Dixon challenged the "legality" of
the move and told the Council he
reserved his government's posi
tion on the calling of the As
sembly.
French Delegate Louis de Gui
ringaud filed a similar reserva
tion.
