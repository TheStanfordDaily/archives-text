start another against the Indians.
For Stanford it's the second in
a series of five "toughies" on the
road to the PCC championship

downs this season while scoring
one and totaling 1034 yards pass
ing and rushing.
The All- American candidate
hopes to repeat his spectacular
performance of a year ago at the
Coliseum. Against the Trojans
last season Brodie led Stanford
to a 2K-20 upset, completing 14 of
20 passes for 210 yards and two
TD's.
Long and serious drills this
week have honed the Indians into
a razor-sharp squad. Even after

eleven in 1954.
Three sophomores have lifted
Sanders' hopes for the future.
Fullback Barry Billington, the
team's leading rusher, has aver

Long, the key man in Sanders'
single-wing offense, passes at a
53 per cent clip, while End Dick
Wallcn leads his teammates in
pass receiving with 17 catches for
193 yards dhd'two touchdowns.
Taylor will stick with his regu
lar starting backfield—the same
quartet that has led the Indians to
three conference victories in as
many starts. Along with Brodie
at quarterback .will be fullback
Lou Valli and halfbacks Paul Ca
mera and Gordy Young.
Both Valli and Young have im
proved considerably since the
Stanford intersectional losses,
raising the Indian rushing aver
age in the last two conference
wins.
Camera, one of the nation's top
pass receivers, has shaken off the
injuries incurred in the Trojan
fracas and is pronounced ready
to go.
