Never before have so many peo
ple from so m;iny seel ions of Los
Angeles boon so eager for a UCLA
victory. When the pride of the
Southland. USC, bowed to the
Stanford Indians last Saturday,
27- li). all hope for saving face
rosier! on UCLA.
Tomorrow before 90,000 specta
tors in the Los Angeles Coliseum,
Stanford meets the dangerous
Uclans.
Red Sanders has his Bruin out
fit keyed to the hilt. And UCLA
has more than one reason to win
this one.
For the Bruins it's a case of
revenge.
There is also a string of seven
Homecoming (lame victories to
protect. Last week Oregon State
snapped UCLA's 19 - game win
streak in PCC action; Sanders
would like nothing better than to
start another against the Indians.
For Stanford it's the second in
a series of five "toughies" on the
road to the PCC championship
and a Rose Bowl bid. USC was
considered the strongest of the
conference foes; UCLA won't buy
that.
Coach Chuck Taylor has his In
dian squad ready and eager for
tomorrow's Los Angeles adven
ture. The nation's top passer and
leader in total offense, John Bro
die, will direct Stanford against
the "angry" Bruins.
Brodie has tossed for 10 touch
downs this season while scoring
one and totaling 1034 yards pass
ing and rushing.
The All- American candidate
hopes to repeat his spectacular
performance of a year ago at the
Coliseum. Against the Trojans
last season Brodie led Stanford
to a 2K-20 upset, completing 14 of
20 passes for 210 yards and two
TD's.
Long and serious drills this
week have honed the Indians into
a razor-sharp squad. Even after
the Trojan win last Saturday, Tay
lor has not let down. His spirited
team has worked on passing and
rushing offense and a stronger
line defense.
Each week the Stanford squad
