# Move Climaxes Stormy, 6-Hour Assembly Meet
## Eisenhower Indicates Vote to Be Main Line Of Future U.S. Policy 
### 
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y., Fri
day, Nov. 2 (UP) The United
Nations General Assembly, by a
vote of 64 to 5, early today ap
proved an American resolution
calling upon Britain, France and
Israel to cease fire in the Egyp
tian fighting.
Britain, France, Israel, Austra
lia and New Zealand voted
against the resolution. Belgium,
Canada, Laos, Netherlands, Por
tugal and South Africa abstained.
The move by the General As
sembly followed the line laid
down by President Eisenhower in
his nationwide television and ra
dio speech Wednesday night.
Then the President said that "the
opinion of the world can be
brought to bear in our quest for
a just end to this tormenting
problem."
Indicates U.S. Policy
He indicated that a General As
sembly vote would be the main
line of U.S. foreign policy to
bring peace to the Middle East.
The vote came after an after
noon and all-night session in
which the delegates debated Is
rael's attack on Egypt Monday
and the Anglo-French follow-up
attacks.
Even after the marathon ses
sion, another weighty problem
faced the weary delegates. Italy
demanded that the emergency
sesion take up the Russian use of
troops in the Hungarian revolt at
Its next session.
The General Assembly was
called into emergency session af
ter the UN Security Council
heard an urgent plea from tho
United States that the Mid-Ea;>t
issue be yanked out of the Secu
rity Council, where each member
has the power of the veto.

It was in the Security Council
meeting earlier this week that
France and Britain vetoed a U.S.
proposal that all foreign troops
be withdrawn from Egypt and a
cease-fire go into immediate ef
! feet.
Today's General Assembly
i measure called upon Israel to
withdraw its troops promptly
from Egyptian soil and urged
Britain and France to halt the
movement of military forces and
arms into the embattled area.
Dulles Plea
U.S. Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles pleaded the ca e
for the U.S. proposal.
"We have reluctantly but deft
nitely come to the conclusion." he
said, "that these provocations, -* 1 -
rious as they are, cannot justify
the resort to armed force which
has occurred in the last few day.;
and which is going on tonight."
A British spokesman said the
measure "would not meet the sit
nation it would merely leave the
Middle East in the same troubled
state which has led to this grave
situation."
