Again it's a case of the fine print at Hie bottom
of the page.
On llie surface and to many vvlio have not
read the fine print, State Proposition 5 would
merely terminate llie requirement that all es
tablishments serving alcoholic beverages also
serve food, thus bringing to an end the age-old
"rubber sandwich," stale peanuts and soggy
potato chips! in bars.
Hut another-provision of this act is the pro
posed incorporation into the state constitution
of llie present law setting the legal age mini
mum for consumption of liquor at 21.
Thus, to change the law it would he neces
sary to pass a constitutional amendment, which
can only be done by referendum, with a two

thirds majority of those voting on the amend
ment needed for parage.
In other words, if passed, Proposition 5
would make it virtually impossible to change
the age minimum for drinking.
It may well be that the "food in bars" re
quirement is outdated, but we,shall not debate
this pioiiltJ WIW does disturb u$ i* lh«.tl a rider 1
has been added to this measure which would
perpetuate, indefinitely a law Which we feel is

For this reason we urge the defeat of Propo
sition 5 arid its ultimate effect of institutional
izing as a near-permanent feature of our state
constitution a. law deserving of immediate
change. - 112
