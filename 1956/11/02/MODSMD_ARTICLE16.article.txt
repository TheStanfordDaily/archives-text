'Partisan Editorials'*
Editor, The Daily:
During the past few weeks of the campaign
t he Daily editorial page has been consistently
and strongly partisan in its support for the Dem
ocratic candidate and his policies.
The cartoons of Herblock and the unsigned
editorials entitled "A Case for Stevenson," "Fail
ure in Diplomacy," "And Again War Looms" are
one-sided, narrowly conceived, categorical state
ments which fondly espouse Mr. Stevenson and
denounce American foreign policy with greater
vigor and less acumen than the Stevenson cam
paigners.
Formerly, parallel editorials voiced the points
of view of both major parties on the salient
issues. Why has this eminently reasonable policy
been discontinued?
We suggest that a large segment of the student
body is opposed to this unilateral editorializing
in their newspaper.
We suggest, further, that the editors of The
Daily reconsider their ill advised policy.

Editor's Note: An editorial, according; to
Webster's, is "an article in a newspaper or
magazine giving the editor's views or those of
the person or persons in control of the news
pa|Â»er."
Daily editorials reflect the opinion of the
Daily editor and/or editorial board. In political
matters the editorials reflect the views of the
editor.
It would Ik 1 a sorry and deficient newspaper,
either college or ii>et:> >olitan, that would re
fuse to take a stand oil an issue it deemed im
portant simply because its readers might "op
pose" its stand, as Mr. Duffy and Mr. Titus
suggest.
Signed editorials do not appear in metro
politan newspapers, and there is no reason the

editorial voice of a college newspaper should
be any different.
The Daily realizes that arguments on both
sides should be presented; this we have at
tempted to do through "The National Scene,"
which appears weekly. These are not edito
rials but columns reflecting the views of the
writers.
Our editorials are not "Democratic" in the
sense that we endorse everything that is Demo
cratic and condemn all that is Republican. It
is because we find merit for serious criticism
of the President ami his policies anil because
we feel that Stevenson espouses a more genu
inely liberal philosophy and. offers stronger
capacity for leadership that we have written
the above-criticized editorials.
Again we say, if students disagree with Daily
editorials or wish to add further comment, we
encourage them to -contribute' to our "Letters
to the Editor" column.
'Misquotes on Sin*/''
Editor, The Daily:
May I correct two misquotes in your report of
my comments on the Suez crisis yesterday?
You quote me as saying that "Great Britain
vetoed the U.S. and Russian proposals in Ihe
Security Council because their tone implied Israel
wasn't the aggressor." In fact, of course, the
reverse was the case. Great Britain felt that the
proposals assumed too quickly that Israel was
the aggressor, without taking adequate account
of Egyptian provocation.
Secondly, I did not say that "by Ihe occupation
we split Egypt and are more apt to force them
to agree to our terms." By establishing a strongly
held buffer zone between Egypt and the Israeli
attack, we hope to make an early armistice more
possible. The purpose of the occupation is not
primarily to force Egypt to submit, hut to pro
tect international shipping and to insure that it
remains protected.
