# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Suez Crisis Sparks Foreign Policy Issue 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
American foreign policy is not a partisan
policy, contrary to what many candidates would
want the people to believe.
But if the making of foreign policy is non
partisan, the carrying out of that policy is
purely partisan. And there is where Democrats
attack Eisenhower's administration.
"The proof of the pudding is in the eating,"
claims an old adage. If that be the case, then
the Republicans' 1 administration of American
foreign policy leaves much to be desired.
As far as proof goes, no one denies that the
United States has lost much of the prestige it
acquired when Truman ordered American units
into Korea to help that nation defend itself
from aggressive attacks.
American world prestige has never been
higher than during the years 1950 to 1952.
And then in 1953 the administration of Ameri
can foreign policy fell into Republican hands.
Instead of being praised for helping the small
underprivileged countries of the world, the
United States has been accused of helping the
large imperialist powers to maintain their co
lonial control.
The Eisenhower-Dulles foreign policy ad
ministration has without exception antagonized
every nationalistic group still under colonial
domination.
Dulles, as.chief administrator of foreign pol
icy, has consistently refused to conduct inter
national relations through regular diplomatic
channels. Instead, he makes personal tours
throughout the world.
But if Dulles has been a regular dynamo in
his trips around the world, every other person
connected with the implementing of foreign
policy has been paralyzed. Especially Eisen
hower, who seems to always be at a loss as to
what to do.
The American people elected Eisenhower in
1952 because they thought that here was a
strong personality that would take the reins
of government in his hands and with quick
(le cisive actions make the American govern
ment respected not only at home but abroad.
But Eisenhower has not lived up to the ex
pectations of the American people.
Instead of being a leader in the interna
tional field, America under Eisenhower has
vacillated from lukewarm to cold. The Middle
East situation is a perfect example.
Until Democrats are given the responsibility
of implementing America's foreign policy llie
United States will continue to decline in the
eyes of the nations of the world.

W itli the critical developments of the past
few days in the Middle East, the election issue
of foreign policy leadership looms ever bigger
as voting day approaches.
Democrats, after stumbling a round with
straw-grasping arguments against the Eisen
hower record and calling for a reduction of the
nations defenses by eliminating the draft and
the 11-homh tests, have seized with glee on the
serious events of this week in the Suez region.
Stevenson waggles his finger at the "bun
gling" of our Middle East policy hy Eisenhower
iind Dulles. 11 «• broadly suggests that the Suez
development is a result of American policy
failure and that the President has falsely con
veyed a lulling picture of peace and content
ment in the world to the American voter.
The inference Stevenson would like to leave
with 11is deluded audiences is that under a
Democratic administration things would be
quite different in the field of foreign policy
leadership.
Hut it is extremely doubtful whether Steven
son would have acted any more successfully
had the been his, under the circum
stances. We have little record of past perform
ance in the ease of Stevenson to rely on in order
to judge whether he would have made any
more successful decision, if indeed more suc
cessful decision even could have been made.
Indeed, it is more necessary than ever now
to have in the Presidency a man who has a
positive record of making the right decisions
at the right time, through war and peace. To
entrust the high office to an untested neophyte
in a time of turmoil would he folly.
Following the precedents of a previous Dem
ocratic rule, would Stevenson he more apt to
plunge us headlong into a Korea-type action
011 the basis of a hastily-made and inexperi
enced decision than would Eisenhower? The
likelihood is more than just strong.
Stevenson criticizes freely the conduct of our
foreign policy, but lie has failed to be construc
tive in his criticism except where he has ad
vanced proposals to junk our draft system and
H-bomb tests. He seems to be well suited to
make criticism, but when it comes to making
positive proposals his wit fails him.
The choice that American voters will make
next Tuesday is between a man who has acted
postively during his years of public service to
win and keep the peace and a man who has
had nothing more to offer the people than an
entertaining game of political football with
the most serious problem of recent davs.
