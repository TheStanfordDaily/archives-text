LANGUAGE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1
In this day of swift international communications,
like radio, television, and the raft, it becomes increasingly
important for all of us to have a solid grounding in
foreign languages. Accordingly, I have asked the makers
of Philip Morris whether I might not occasionally forego
levity in this column and instead use it for a short lesson
in language.
"Of course, silly!" chuckled the makers, tousling my
yellow hair. Oh, grand men they are, the makers of
Philip Morris, just as full of natural goodness as the
cigarettes they make. "Of course, fond boy, you may
occasionally forego levity in this column and instead use
it for a short lesson in language!" said the makers and
tossed me up and down in a blanket until, rosy with
laughing, I bade them desist, and then we all had basins
of farina and smoked Philip Morrises and sang songs
until the campfire had turned to embers.

For our first lesson in language, let us take up
French, which has often been called the lingua franca
of France. We will approach French in a new manner,
because, to be brutally frank, the way it is taught in our
colleges is archaic and obsolete. Why all this emphasis
on grammar? After all, when we get to France does it
matter if we can parse and conjugate? Of course not!
So for the first exercise, translate the following real,
true-to-life dialogue between two real, true-to-life French
men named Claude (pronounced Clohd) and Pierre (also
pronounced Clohd) :
CLAUDE: Good morning, sir. Can you direct me to
the nearest monk?
PIERRE: I have regret, but I am a stranger hero
myself.
CLAUDE: Is it that you come from the France?
PIERRE: You have right.
CLAUDE: I also. Come, let us mount the airplane
and return ourselves to the France.
PIERRE: We must defend from smoking until the
airplane raises itself.
CLAUDE: Ah. now it has raised itself. Will you have
a Philippe Maurice?
PIERRE: Mercy.
CLAUDE: In the garden of my aunt it makes warm
in the summer and cold in the winter.
PIERRE: What a coincidence. In the garden of my
aunt too!
CLAUDE: Ah, we are landing. Regard how the air
plane depresses itself.
PIERRE: What shall you do in the France?
CLAUDE: I shall make a promenade and see various
sights of cultural and historical significance. What shall
you do?
PIERRE: I think I shall try to pick up the stewardess.
CLAUDE: Long live the France!
