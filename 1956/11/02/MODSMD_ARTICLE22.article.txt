# 1956 Brings Area Demos' Best Turnout
## Activities Will Boom As Result of Doubled Group Membership 
### 
Every election year brings in
creased membership into political
organizations, and 19 5 6 has
brought to the Stanford Area
Young Democrats the largest ac
tive group in four years.
Membership in the Stanford
Area YD's has more than doubled
this year, according to Sandy Rob
bins, vice-president of the organi
zation. There are 80 paid mem
bers to date, she said, and last
year at this time fewer than 40
were registered.
The five-year#)ld club, formed
in spring quarter of 1952, attrib
utes the increase to the election
year and to the growing interest
of the general public in political
affairs, Miss Robbins added.
Membership Increase
As a direct result of the boom
in membership and interest this
year, the organization's activities
have snowballed. For the first
time, the Stanford Area YD's are
affiliated with the California Dem
ocratic Council, a non-profession
al organization which endorses
candidates and works with the
Democratic party.
The YD's also became officially
affiliated with the state Young
Democrats, according to Tom van
Straaten, public relations chair
man. The state YD's, in turn, are
sponsored by the state central
committee for the party.
Both these affiliations enable
the Stanford chapter to take part
in a wide range of state and na
tional programs.
Election Distribul ion
Distribution of election material
has been a prime activity of the
group. During the quarter they
have canvassed local precincts,
passing out stickers, posters and
information on Democratic candi
dates and platform. They also
went to San Jose last week to
work with the Santa Clara County
Democratic Council on party pub
licity.
Participating in the nation-wide
Democratic Dollar Day program
two weeks ago, Stanford Area
YD's collected funds in Palo Alto
to help finance Stevenson's and
Kefauver's appearances on radio
and television.
As for future activities, pre
cinct work will be continued until
Nov. 6, and a "victory party" on
election night is being planned,
van Straaten said.
