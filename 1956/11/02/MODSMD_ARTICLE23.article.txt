# Farm Young Republicans Hope To Lead Country in Size Again
## YR's Stage Parties to Distribute Propaganda; Do Clerical Work at Republican Headquarters 
### 
Activity of the Stanford Area
Young Republicans seems to in
crease in direct proportion with
the nearness of that "first Tues
day after the first Monday in
November."
This quarter has been a busy
one for the Stanford Area YR's,
states Secretary Jean Van Devan
ter, and this last week before
elections is proving to be even
more so. Members are expected
to continue their precinct and
campaign work until the eve of
Nov. 6.
The YR's, which has some 200
paid members to date, has held
"work parties" throughout the
quarter, in which they distributed
election material for GOP candi
dates and did clerical work at
campaign headquarters. Working
closely with the Menlo-Atherton
group, they have taken over many
of the necessary jobs that must
be done by all communities dur
ing election time.
Car Caravan
One of the highlights of this
quarter's activities was the 15-car
caravan which trekked to Moffett
Field three weeks ago to meet
Vice-President Richard Nixon.
The Stanford Area YR's, which
had nearly 500 paid members last
year, then boasted the largest ac
tive membership of Young
lican clubs in the nation, Miss
Van Devanter said. For many
years the group at Harvard Uni
versity held that distinction. The
group hopes to again equal this
number through an official mem
bership drive which is scheduled
for the future.
The large size of the group,
however, has also presented prob
lems. Locating an adequate meet
ing place off campus has proved

to be a main concern of the YR's.
Because it is such a large group,
communication between members
is also difficult.
Educate Members
Stanford Area YR's, and YR
groups in general, aim at educa
tion of members as to what a Re
publican is and what the GOP
party stands for, Miss Van De
vanter said. Last year, for ex
ample, the group sponsored a se
ries of speakers who discussed
current affairs and political is
sues. By participating in GOP
functions on a local level, mem
bers also become better acquaint
ed with the Republican party on
the national level.
Officers of the Stanford group
are Cliff Kimber and Everett
Kindig, co-presidents; Tim For
den, vice-president; Jean Van De
vanter, secretary, and Bob Baker
and Royal Brown, committee
chairmen.
