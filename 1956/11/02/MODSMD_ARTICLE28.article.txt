Tomorrow afternoon I'll be sitting high above the green of the
Coliseum Smog Bowl watching what Stanford fans hope will be
retribution for the 72-0 whiplashing given (he Indians on that same
field two years before by the UCLA Golden Boys.
Now the gold is tarnished and rubbing off, but there is still
enough there to keep the Stanford coaching staff worried. For as
expert scout Dutch Fehring says, "UCLA wants this game more than
any other on its schedule."
On the practice field this week the Indians have been working
long and late, with a good amount of time devoted to sharpening up
the pass attack and perfecting the blocking and tackling on defense.
For the first lime in a long while Coach Taylor is" capping the mid
season practices with extensive calisthenics.
The team is not thinking Rose Bowl just now —"and they bet
ter not be or I'll knock it out of them fast," says Taylor. But
among sideliners the word seems to be that if Stanford should get
the Bowl bid it would do a good portion of its practicing during
the holidays here on the Farm rather than at Pasadena.
The idea would be to have the team work out against the West
Shrine squad which will be encamped hereabouts, and then make
the trip to Pasadena shortly before the first of the year.

POSTSCRIPT: Dutch Fehring probably knows more about the
UCLA team than the Bruins do themselves. After watching a couple
of games, he had enough detailed information for 18 full pages of
mimeographed material on Bruin players and plays. It made thick
reading for the players this week. Dutch might be characterized as
the "brain" of Stanford's coaching staff—being the only one with a
doctorate (education), which he got from Stanford in 1952. He's got
this scouting business down tc a science and can tell more about a
team from one series of downs than most people can all season. Two
facts he's told the team this week should make even the most opti
mistic Stanford rooter a bit wary as he watches tomorrow's game:
(1) UCLA has intercepted nine passes so far this season; and (2)
they rush the passer better than any team Stanford has met so far
this year.

enough there to keep the Stanford coaching staff worried. For as
expert scout Dutch Fehring says, "UCLA wants this game more than

On the practice field this week the Indians have been working
long and late, with a good amount of time devoted to sharpening up
the pass attack and perfecting the blocking and tackling on defense.
For the first lime in a long while Coach Taylor is" capping the mid
season practices with extensive calisthenics.
The team is not thinking Rose Bowl just now —"and they bet
ter not be or I'll knock it out of them fast," says Taylor. But
among sideliners the word seems to be that if Stanford should get
the Bowl bid it would do a good portion of its practicing during
the holidays here on the Farm rather than at Pasadena.
The idea would be to have the team work out against the West
Shrine squad which will be encamped hereabouts, and then make
the trip to Pasadena shortly before the first of the year.

POSTSCRIPT: Dutch Fehring probably knows more about the
UCLA team than the Bruins do themselves. After watching a couple
of games, he had enough detailed information for 18 full pages of
mimeographed material on Bruin players and plays. It made thick
reading for the players this week. Dutch might be characterized as
the "brain" of Stanford's coaching staff—being the only one with a
doctorate (education), which he got from Stanford in 1952. He's got
this scouting business down tc a science and can tell more about a
team from one series of downs than most people can all season. Two
facts he's told the team this week should make even the most opti
mistic Stanford rooter a bit wary as he watches tomorrow's game:
(1) UCLA has intercepted nine passes so far this season; and (2)
they rush the passer better than any team Stanford has met so far
this year.
Tomorrow afternoon I'll be sitting high above the green of the
Coliseum Smog Bowl watching what Stanford fans hope will be
retribution for the 72-0 whiplashing given (he Indians on that same
field two years before by the UCLA Golden Boys.
