# Indian Cross-country Southbound; UCLA Favored in Saturday Meet
## 
### 
Stanford's cross-country aggregation will join the general migra
tion southward this afternoon when they head for Los Angeles and
their Saturday meet with the UCLA'harriers. "
Bob Monzingo, Doug Martin, Maury Graves, Ralph Love, Ernie
Cunliffe, Don Richardson and Rodger Beck won the right to meet

the Uclans by finishing in that
order in the Indians' meet with
SC and Cal last week.
Monzlngo, only a freshman,
has been the big surprise of the
team, being the top Stanford fin
isher in both of the races thus
far.
UCLA's big gun is expected to
be Bobby Seaman, a 4:01.4 miler.
The Bruin team is considered
quite strong, losing to Cal by just
one point while the Bears had
little difficulty in polishing off
Stanford in a practice race.
Although last week's meet was
a big disappointment point-wise
for the Indians, Coach Pay ton
Jordan revealed that each man
lowered his time an average of
31.5 seconds since the San Jose
State meet two weeks ago.
The Tribe's junior varsity run
ners will host a six-team meet
Saturday at 10 a.m. on the Stan
ford golf course. Other teams set
to run are San Jose State, Cal
Poly, San Francisco State, Santa
Rosa and Modesto.
Warren Wood, A 1 Salcedo,
Brenl Barksdale, John Patterson,
Chuck McKenney, Doug Krotz
and Dan Thornburg will count in
the scoring for Stanford, with
nine other men also running in
an effort to break into the front
line.
