# Soccer Team Challenges UBC In Game on Farm Tomorrow
## 
### 
The University of British Columbia soccer team starts a two
game tour of the Bay Area when it takes on the Stanford eleven to
morrow at 2 p.m. on the varsity field.
This is probably the best team that the Cardinal squad will face
this year. ÃœBC features a number of players who have been partici-

pating in soccer for most of their
athletic lives, and the quality
shows.
Though the outlook is not too
optimistic for Stanford, Coach
Priddle expects the Red will give
the visitors a "good game."
Priddle also hoped that the
strength of the opposition plus
the fact that this is the only var
sity competition on campus to
morrow would improve the mea
ger attendance which has charac
terized soccer games so far this
season.
The soccer field is located adja
cent to Encina Gym.
The preliminary game, the JV's
against the California Aggies
from Davis, starts at 1 p.m.; the
varsity game will follow imme
diately thereafter.
The Cardinals will start Bill
Ditman in goal. He has been one
of the stand-outs in the Stanford
team which has compiled a 2-2
record so far this season. Art
Harlow and Jack Benjamin will
continue at fullbacks, with Dave
Brant, co-captain Peter Mack and
Jim Bowditch forming the half
back line.
