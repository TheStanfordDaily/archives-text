# FRESHMEN IN PRELIM
## Stanford Yearlings to Test Small Baby Bruin Squad 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford's highly touted fresh
man football team will get its
second test of the season tomor
row morning in Los Angeles when
the Papooses face the UCLA Bru
babes.
Smashing 36-13 victors over
Southern California last Satur
day, Coach Bob Ghilotti's crew is
favored to knock off the winless
Uclans. California's frosh took
the Brubabes into camp last week,
13-6, behind the running of Wayne
Crow.
John Adams, 230-pound tailback
from San Diego, paces the strong
UCLA running attack. Adams was
outstanding last week against the
Cubs, but presented the Brubabes'
only real threat. As a passer he
completed only two of 11 tosses
in a game that saw both teams
gain only 18 yards through the
air.
Eight Lines
The Papoose line, heavily out
weighed by USC last week, will
be up against competition more
their own size. Despite the Tro
babes' weight advantage, the Card
line held SC rushers down to a
net 80 yards while Stanford lolled
up 315 on the ground.
Pacing the UCLA forward wall
are guards Rod Cochran and Bob
Wattenberg, center Harry Bald
win and tackle Dean Betts. All
stood out defensively last week.
Dick Foushee, 208-pound terror

from Glendale, is tabbed as a
standout end.
Coach Ghilotti was "surprised"
and pleased at his line's showing
last week. "On paper, SC cer
tainly appeared to have the better
line," he said.
"Their guards, Roger Mietz and
Roger Fisher, were supposed to
be real standouts, but apparently
were no better than Ray Harring
ton and Niel Laughlin. Tackle
Ron Fernandes also played a very
good game for us."
Passing Too
To complement their crushing
ground game, the Papooses un
veiled a strong passing threat.
Starting quarterback Sid Garber
connected on 12 of 22 tosses for
136 yards, while John Bond hit
on two of three for 52 yards.
Chris Burford, Jerry Winters,
Dick Bowers and Trevor Grimm
established themselves as top re
ceivers against the Trobabes.
Garber passed to Burford for
one Stanford touchdown and scor
ed two himself.
Joining Adams in the Brubabe
backfield are fullback Ray Smith,
who scored the lone TD against
Cal; wingback Charles Berry, a
defensive standout, and blocking
back Ernie Trumper.
Sams Starters
Ghilotti expects to start the
same team that opened against
USC. Burford, down with tonsil
litis earlier in the week, is back
ip harness and ready to go.
Uclan Coach Johnny Johnson
has seen his team hit by a rash
of injuries, and his already small
squad has now been depleted to
22 men.
Last year an unbeaten UCLA
yearling eleven dumped the Pa
pooses, 29-0, at Stanford.
