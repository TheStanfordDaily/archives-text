# SU Lecturer William Shockley Shares Nobel Prize in Physics
## Becomes Third Farm Physicist to Win Award; Honored for Development of Transistor Tube 
### 
William Shockley, lecturer in electrical engineering, yesterday was
named with two colleagues as a winner of the 1956 Nobel Prize in
physics.
This brings to three the total of Stanford scientists who have won
Nobel physics prizes. Others are Professors Felix Bloch and Willis
â„¢ " Lamb.

Shoekley, University of Illinois
Professor John Bardeen and Wai
ter Brattain of the Bell Telephone
Laboratory, Murray Hill, N.J.,
were honored for work in invent
ing and developing the transisloi
tube. The three scientists will
share a $38,633 cash prize.
Shockley's main work now is
heading the newly founded
Shoekley Semiconductor Labora
tory. The laboratory, located at
391 S. San Antonio Rd., Mountain
View, has as its present purpose
further development of the tran
sistor.
Tiny, Inexpensive
The transistor, a tiny, inexpen
sive substitute for a vacuum
tube, played a key part in recent
developments in the fields of ra
dio, telephone and automation.
Shoekley said: "Location next
to Stanford is the best in the
world for starting a semiconduc
tor company. Stanford has the
strongest electronic development
work in the country."
Shoekley first heard of the
aWard at 7:15 a.m. yesterday
when a telephone call from a
Stockholm, Sweden, newspaper
man interrupted the breakfast of
the physicist and his wife. They
live at 23466 Corte Via in Los
Altos I fills.
Shoekley described his first re
action as "skepticism." "I knew
this was possible but I wondered
if it was one of my playful asso
ciates."
Not a Joke
A few minutes later Shoekley
knew he was the recipient of an
award rather than the victim of
a joke. "A friend called and said
his wife had heard it on the ra
dio," the scientist related.
Also with Shoekley yesterday
was his mother. Mrs. May Shock
ley of Palo Alto. Mrs. Shoekley
is a graduate of the Stanford
class of '02. Shockley's father,
William, formerly lectured in the
mining and metallurgy depart
ment.
A celebration dinner attended
by Shoekley, his wife and the
staff of his laboratory was held
yesterday afternoon at Rickey's
Studio Inn.
Post-World War
The work for which Shoekley
and his colleagues are being rec
ognized dates back to post-World
War II years. At that time,
Shoekley was general director ol
semi-conductor research at Mr*
Rell Telephone Laboratories in
New Jersey.
Shoekley believes findings
made in developing the transis
tors, rather than the inventions
themselves, were considered of
greatest significance in the Nobel
Prize award.
