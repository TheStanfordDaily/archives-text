# Robert Dedekam Wins Final Round In Moot Court
## 
### 
Robert C. Dedekam won the
final round of the Marion Rice
Kirkwood Moot Court Competi
tion last night in the Moot Court
Room of Stanford Law School,
arguing for the petitioner in the
case of Carl Young vs. the State
of Stanford.
He won the first prize of $100.
Second prize, $50, went to Wil
liam E. Murane. Third and fourth
prizes of $25 each were won by
Robert C. Prior and Laurence K.
Brown.
Dedekam will compete in a na
tional moot court competition.
Young, the defendant in the
case, was convicted of first-de
gree murder in the trial court.
11c had threatened his wife with
violence and she had asked the
government for aid. When FBI
agents came and asked questions
about the children in the family,
Young grabbed a pistol and shot
one of the agents. In the trial he
pleaded insanity.
The issues before the court
concerned instructions to the
jury as to what definitions they
should use of the word "insan
ity"
Dedekam argued that the lower
court erred on the question of in
sanity by instructing the jury
that they were to consider wheth
er the defendant was able to dis
tinguish right from wrong.
