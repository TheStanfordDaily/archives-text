### Camille Petersen 
Yeruham Ben-Dror of the Israeli Ministry of Labor explained
Israel's position in the present Middle East conflict to a crowd of 150
at Bowman Alumni House yesterday afternoon.
In an Institute of International Relations Consul Talk, he empha
sized that he was expressing his views only as a citizen and that he

is not a diplomat.
Ben - Dror told those present
how Egyptian "suicide troops"
have been crossing the borders
continuously for six or 1 seven
years killing inhabitants and
burning homes. He also said that
"Nasser staged parades and gave
medals to those who came back
from raids and could boast of kill
ing 30 or more Israelis.
"No Surprise"
Because of these events, he
thinks that the government felt
it had to take some action besides
talking with the Egyptians before
the people took it upon them
selves to defend the country by
force. Ben-Dror said, "Israel's in
vasion was no surprise to me."
Turning to the Suez Canal
question, Ben - Dror told how
Egypt has not permitted Israeli
ships to use the canal for four or
five years. Because of this all of
the ships coming from Burma, a
country with which Israel has a
great deal of trade, have to go
around the Cape of Good Hope to
reach their destination. Israel
loses $50 million annually because
of this.
Did Not Comply
The United Nations instructed
Egypt to open the canal to Israel,
but she did not comply. Rather
than cause more trouble, Israel
has let the issue pass, Ben-Dror
said.
When asked why he thought
Israel was a democratic country,
he answered that to him a demo
cratic country had a combination
of political and economic free
dom, and that Israel had both.
The country has freedom of
speech, religion, press and elec
t ions.
