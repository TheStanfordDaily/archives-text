# Russia Sets Up Puppet Regime To Squelch Hungarian Rebels
## Defiant Tone Gone as Revolters' Radio Appeals To U.S., Western Nations to 'Save Our Souls' 
### 
VIENNA, Nov. 4 (UP)—The Iron Curtain fell around Hungary
today. Russian troops and tanks crushed a 12-day-old freedom revolt
and set up a puppet government that was in "full control" of the
nation.
Imre Nagy, who headed a brief anti-Soviet government, was a

Russian prisoner. Josef Cardinal
Mindszenty, primate of Hungary,
who returned to Budapest in tri
umph last week, took refuge in
the American legation in the
Hungarian capital.
"Order Number One" broad
cast by the Soviet military com
mandant at Szolnok in eastern
Hungary clamped down a curfew
and told Hungarians they would
be tried by court martial if they
failed to surrender their arms by
6 p.m. (9 a.m. PST) Monday.
The Russians used the element
of surprise and overwhelming
strength to subdue Budapest.
A 24-year-old Hungarian physi
cian who left Budapest early to
day told United Press that the
city fell to the Russians "with
hardly a shot fired in its de
fense."
"Surprise"
"Surprise was the Russians'
weapon. They camc so fast that
any resistance would have been
useless.
"I drove out of Budapest at 9
a.m. After that, the freedom
fighters may have started guer
rilla warfare. But by then the sit
uation was hopeless."
At 8:07 a.m., the Budapest ra
dio went off the air with the last
despairing cry of: "Help, help,
help."
Near Sopron, close to the Aus
trian border, university students
armed only with small aims held
off Soviet tanks, infantry and ar
tillery for 10 hours before the
superior R us s ia n for c e cut
through their lines, a refugee re
ported.
The students had mobilized as
soon as Nagy disclosed the Soviet
attack over Radio Budapest. They
established defense positions in a
two-mile-wide bottleneck between
Neuseidler Lake and the Aus
trian border. While they blocked
the Russian advance, thousands
of refugees and the full Hunga
rian army garrison of Sopron fled
across the border into Austria,
the refugee said.
Diehard R<*hels
But diehard rebel bands fought
on into the afternoon in Budapest
to try to save their 12-day-old up
rising.
Provincial rebel radios broad
cast appeals for help from the
United Nations and the West. But
the tenor of their broadcasts
changed from last week's defiant
"Russians go home" to an an
guished "Save our souls."
"The shadows are deepening
over Hungary," said one.
At 4 p.m. Radio Budapest came
back on the air under the aus
pices of the new regime and an
nounced that Janos Kadar, party
boss in the Nagy government, had
been installed as premier. Ferenc
Meunnich. ousted from the Nagy
cabinet last week, was appointed
military commander-in-chief.
The broadcast opened with a
recording of Verdi's noisy "Anvil
Chorus" and "11 Trovatore."
