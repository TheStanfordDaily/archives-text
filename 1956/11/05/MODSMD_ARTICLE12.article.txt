# Tragedy and Irony
## 
### 
Thf. tidal wavf. of crisfs iliat lias swept over
the world during the past week leaves behind
ii an international picture more chaotic than
it has been since the days of World War 11.
The lull before the storm has broken, and,
Willi it, wakes of disaster and death have spread
over Egypt and Hungary, threatening to engulf
the whole of eastern Europe and the Middle
East.
It is the height of irony and tragedy that
these two erises should have arisen at the same
time, each detracting from the impact of the
other and casting a shadow of duplicity over
the efforts of Western nations, especially Brit
ain and France, to bring moral force to bear
upon Russia to cease Iwi wanton aggression on
I lungary.
The Western bloc can hardly enter the Unit
ed Nations debate over the Hungarian debacle
with a dean conscience, for two of her strongest
components, Britain and France, have the
blood of aggression still wet on their hands.
The West can hardly stand united in the halls
of the United Nations, for, although the West
can morally unite against Communist aggres
sion, it becomes tragically disunited when it
comes to aggression committed by two of its
own nations.
Frightening connotations surrounded the
special sessions of the U.N. General Assembly
and Security Council which stretched dramati
cally till nearly dawn yesterday morning; radio
commentators and listeners were struck by
memories of Ethiopia, Poland and Pearl
II arbor.
It was a night of tragie irony. One sees the

bitter-irony of the current world situation best
exemplified by the angry denunciation of Brit
ain and France delivered bv Soviet Delegate
Arkady A. Sobolev at the same time that Rus
sian troops were launching a full-scale assa\ilt
against Budapest and the Nagy government. '
The weight of the world indeed rests upon
the shoulders of the United Nations and upon
the shoulders of the United States, the only
nation of the Big Four whose hands remain
untainted by blood. Should the U.N. fail in its
efforts to bring the moral force of world Opinion
to bear upon aggressor nations and fail to im
plement successfully its resolutions of condem
nation and demands for cease-fire, it may find
itself powerless in the face of future confla
grations.
Should the United States fail to mend the
tortuous breaches torn in the Western alliance
by Anglo-French action in the Middle East, it
may find itself forced unwillingly into a "Fort
ress America" position of defense, forced to
rely on herself by the fact that nationalist am
bitions of her two heretofore most dependable
allies take precedence over a common front
against a common threat. The United States
has been strong internationally in the past be
cause she has commanded a position of leader
ship among other democratic nations; with the
demise of her international backing, her
strength would die also.
Whatever the weeks ahead may bring, they
will stand as a mid-twentieth century turning
point. It is the question of which direction the
century will turn that preoccupies the very soul
of this country and the United Nations.
