## Richards Challenges Kuchel in Solon Race 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
Richard Richards, a young man gifted with
eloquence of speech and filled with a fiery de
termination, has captivated the minds and
hearts of millions of Californians this past year
in his campaign for senator from California.
Richards is a Democrat, and there is every
indication that he will break into the Repub
licans' monopoly of California senators.
Far better known in southern California than
in the Bay Area, Richards has a background
of 20 years of legal and representative work for
the California Democratic party. In the state
Senate he came out strongly for such things as
EEP(!, aid to education, construction of needed
institutions, and he has strongly opposed in
fringement 011 civil rights.
A relative unknown to California voters,
Ric hards broke into state-wide prominence by
his defeat of Mildred Younger in the state sena
torial race for Los Angeles County in 1952. At
that time Mrs. Younger had won national prom
inence in her primary fight against Los Angeles
County State Senator Jack Tenny, whom she
defeated in the Republican primary.
Richards' victory in that final election
brought him to the attention of California
Democratic leaders who hail begun a grass
roots revamping of the Democratic party in
this state. His victory over Mrs. Younger,
though called an upset, clearly showed that he
had amazing vote-attracting ability.
So last March Richards was put up for nomi
nation and defeated former Senatorial Candi
date Sam Yorty at the state Democratic con
vention in Fresno.
Richards is known for his adherence to what
he calls "basic principles of humanity." Tll the
pursuance of these principles he has not hesi
tated to publicly disavow the party line, nor
has he hesitated to condemn members of his
party, such as U.S. Senator James Eastland,
who have fought against these basic principles.
Unlike his opponent, incumbent Senator
I lioinas 11. Kuchel, Richards has taken definite
stands on every major issue in this campaign.
Me has expressed his ideals. But, even more,
lie has given the people of "California every
reason to believe that he has the integrity to
live up to those stated ideals.

Incumbent U.S. Senator Thomas IT. Kuchel
presents a record of accomplishment to Cali
fornia voters tomorrow.
In the 314 years he has held the junior sena
torial position, the 47-year-old Republican has
produeed many hills to the benefit of California
as well as supporting the programs of President
Eisenhower.
It is this reeord which will interest voters and
lead them to return Kuchel for a full six-year
term on election day.
Opponent Richard Richards has made a
strong play for the Democratic vote by scoring
Kuchel's Senate voting record on traditionally
political - charged issues. But Richards has
failed to give the voters any substantial reasons
to turn out of office the experienced Kuchel.
Although his opponents characterize him us
undynamic, Kuchel -has brought nearly 50
pieces of legislation before the Senate which
are now enacted law. There have been sweep
ing water control, conservation and municipal
development bills passed for the benefit of
California.
And Kuchel has been one of the strongest
proponents of Eisenhower's programs.. Un
doubtedly he is needed in the Senate by the
Republican leadership to help carry forth the
positive measures proposed by the Executive.
However, Kuchel is no "yes man"—he votes
his own experienced convictions, and on occa
sion when his own conscience differs with the
party line he has not been afraid to so vote.
Kuchel has a wide background of experience
in legal and political arenas in California, pre
vious to his being appointed to fill the seat
vacated by Richard Nixon when he became
Vice President.
Two years ago Kuchel scored a thumping
triumph over Samuel Yorty to gain the right
to fill out Nixon's unexpired term. This year's
prfmary saw the Republican post impressive
vote totals in both the GOP and Democratic,
columns.
Candidate Richards has faced an uphill strug
gle against a strong record of a man who sup
ports a very popular President. In California
the result tomorrow is bound to be a vote of
confidence for a job well done rather than elec
tion of the unknown quantity which Dick
Richards is.
