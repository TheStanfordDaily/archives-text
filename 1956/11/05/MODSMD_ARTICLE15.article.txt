## Observations from USC 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Having been in the area of your campus over
the weekend of Oct. 26, for an obvious reason, I
have assimilated some observations about your
campus which, while they may be of no value to
your student body, may be of some slight in
terest.
First of all, on Friday, Oct. 26, I had the pleas
ure of doing academic research in the famous
Hopkins Transportation Library. Despite the
fact that I appeared on the scene during a time
of extreme hostility, I was treated very gener
ously, and I have nothing but praise for both
your staff and the library for the assistance ren
dered me.
I further took the opportunity, both Friday
afternoon and Saturday evening, after the con
flict but before the obligations of pleasurable
personal duties, to examine the structure and
plan of your campus. May I say sincerely that
I was greatly impressed? The developed areas
of your campus are certainly quite beautiful.
As a matter of fact, there seems to be only one
geological drawback to the entire area —dust.
It strikes me as interesting that although the
administration of your University has been for
ward-thinking enough to deny the existence of
sororities on campus, it has not as yet broadened
that intelligent decision to fraternities. In my
belief, the most ideal academic situation exists
where secret societies don't. (While this may
sound strange coming from a USC student, who
goes to a school where society is the rule rather
than the exception, may I state that the great
majority of USC students are "independent." It's
just that the fraternity and sorority peoplp cre
ate a good deal of organized noise, and pride
themselves with "running the school.")
It also strikes me as odd that a school with
the intelligence of yours still chooses to practice
sex discrimination in the stands at games. I
have never yet seen the problem that was solved
by its being ignored, or by running away from it.
In closing, I observe this: I am proud to say
I go to USC because USC affords me ihe most
ideal academic situation in my major field, mu
sic, available west of Chicago. By the same

token, I feel sure that any Stanford student can
be proud of the fact that he is a Stanford stu
dent, for you certainly have one of the finest
academic universities on the west coast.

Editor, The Daily:
Having been in the area of your campus over
the weekend of Oct. 26, for an obvious reason, I
have assimilated some observations about your
campus which, while they may be of no value to
your student body, may be of some slight in
terest.
First of all, on Friday, Oct. 26, I had the pleas
ure of doing academic research in the famous
Hopkins Transportation Library. Despite the
fact that I appeared on the scene during a time
of extreme hostility, I was treated very gener
ously, and I have nothing but praise for both
your staff and the library for the assistance ren
dered me.
I further took the opportunity, both Friday
afternoon and Saturday evening, after the con
flict but before the obligations of pleasurable
personal duties, to examine the structure and
plan of your campus. May I say sincerely that
I was greatly impressed? The developed areas
of your campus are certainly quite beautiful.
As a matter of fact, there seems to be only one
geological drawback to the entire area —dust.
It strikes me as interesting that although the
administration of your University has been for
ward-thinking enough to deny the existence of
sororities on campus, it has not as yet broadened
that intelligent decision to fraternities. In my
belief, the most ideal academic situation exists
where secret societies don't. (While this may
sound strange coming from a USC student, who
goes to a school where society is the rule rather
than the exception, may I state that the great
majority of USC students are "independent." It's
just that the fraternity and sorority peoplp cre
ate a good deal of organized noise, and pride
themselves with "running the school.")
It also strikes me as odd that a school with
the intelligence of yours still chooses to practice
sex discrimination in the stands at games. I
have never yet seen the problem that was solved
by its being ignored, or by running away from it.
In closing, I observe this: I am proud to say
I go to USC because USC affords me ihe most
ideal academic situation in my major field, mu
sic, available west of Chicago. By the same

token, I feel sure that any Stanford student can
be proud of the fact that he is a Stanford stu
dent, for you certainly have one of the finest
academic universities on the west coast.
