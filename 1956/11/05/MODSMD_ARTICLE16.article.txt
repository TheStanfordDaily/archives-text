# The 						Most Unpleasant Place I Know
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
There is a part of the Stanford campus which
completely repulses me. It is the most unpleasant
place I know, but unfortunately I must spend a [
great deal of time there. This horrible retreat |
is ... the Western Civ Library.
As classified among methods of becoming!
learned, studying in the Civ Libe is comparable!
to sitting by a fire writing one's lessons in char
coal on the back of a grimy shovel, as Lincoln
once did.
Although Stanford, as all American colleges
and universities, is hard pressed financially from
the need for increasing classroom and dormitory
facilities, surely a few dollars could be appropri
ated for expansion and improvement of a library
which nearly all its students must use at some
time during their academic careers.
In a past assignment given to all classes in
Western Civ it was necessary to read excerpts
from a book entitled "The History of Herodotus."
There are only 47 volumes of this work to be
used by a group of students numbering more than
1000. In most cases a wait of at least half an hour
was necessary in order to obtain this book. For
a student who has a schedule with little time
between classes, a half-hour wait consumes valu
able minutes he could have spent reading and
taking notes.
There is also no satisfactory method of telling
time in the Civ Libe. A very woebegone-looking
clock possessing one hand stands proudly on a
shelf near the check-out desk and gives the only
indication that tempus fugit.
I dare say that upon completing my Western
Civ course, the library will still be undersized,
overcrowded, poorly ventilated and with hardly
enough volumes . . . but, please, won't somebody
buy a clock with two hands?
