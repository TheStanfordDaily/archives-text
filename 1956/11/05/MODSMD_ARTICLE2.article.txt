WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UP)—
The Soviet Union promised today
for the third time—to let a con
voy of Americans leave war-torn
Hungary for Austria.
The State Department an
nounced that the U.S. ambassa
dor to Russia, Charles E. Bohlcn,
had conferred today in Moscow
with Soviet Foreign Minister
Dmitri Shepilov about the con
voy issue.
The State Department spokes
man said Shepilov promised to
send a message "immediately
that would make it possible to
get the convoy through."
Dependents of American lega
tion personnel in Budapest left
the Hungarian capital on Friday
to cross the border into Austria.
The Russians, however, turned
the convoy back short of the bor
der.
Soviet Ambassador Georgi N.
Zarouhin twice has promised that
the convoy would tie permitted to
enter Austria. His word was
given in response to two State
Department demands for action.
The spokesman said he does
not know where the convoy is to
night.
