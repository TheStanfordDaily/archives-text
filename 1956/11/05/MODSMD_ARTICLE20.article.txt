# AFTERMATH OF UCLA
## OSC May Wilt SU Roses 
### 
The path to the roses is still
open, no thanks to an inspired
crew of football players from
Westwood, Calif.
UCLA's 14-13 upset of the fa
vored Stanford Indians before al
most 77,000 fans in Los Angeles
Saturday just about settled the
issue: the PCC crown is up for
grabs, Oregon State or Stanford.
Anyone who might have
thought next Saturday's OSC-
Stanford battle here was to be
easy going for Chuck Taylor's
squad can forget such thoughts.
In fact, no one would be sur
prised if the Beavers are favored
in next week's decider.
Off the Bruin performance,
Stanford looked like anything but
a PCC champion.
Line Does It
A tremendously fast, hard
charging Bruin line was the mar
gin of victory. They went
through, under, over and around
the porous Card forward wall to
dump Indian ball carriers time
and again for losses that totaled
107 yards.
Besides containing the Indian
ground game and smothering the
Stanford passers the vicious
Bruin line made the two "breaks"
that led to UCLA touchdowns. A
tackle that cartwheeled Card full
back Lou Valli produced a fumble
on the Stanford 19. UCLA recov
ered and scored five plays later.
Moments later the Eruin line
came through with the most spec
tacular play of the game. On a
fourth-down punt situation for

Stanford the UCLA line came
pouring through as they might
on a screen pass play. Ilal Smith
blocked John Brodie's kick, send
ing the ball almost straight up
into the air. Pete O'Garro caught
the ball on a dead run and ram
bled 50 yards unmolested into the
end zone.
Raftery Stars
Mickey Raftery was a surprise
starter for the second half, but
the choice proved to be a good
one. Standing all alone on the
Bruin 30, Raftery made a diffi
cult catch of a Brodie pass that
traveled 50 yards in the air. The
play netted 40 yards from scrim
mage. Four plays later Raftery
made a beautiful diving catch of
another long Brodie pass just in
side the end zone.
All in all it was a frustrating
after-noon for Stanford. They
didn't even win the flip of the
coin and were forced to kick off
to the inhospitable Bruins.
Paul Wiggin's game - opening
kickoff was taken by Barry Bil
lington on the UCLA 22 and he
returned it 45 yards to the Stan
ford 33. After driving down to
the Stanford 10, the Card line
held as two Bruin passes fell in
complete. Stanford took over but
fumbled two plays later and UC
LA's Smith recovered. This time
the Bruins kept to the ground
and five plays later Edison Grif
fin scored.
The Blocked Kick
UCLA kicked off and Stanford,
unable to move the ball, punted.

Brodie's kick was taken by Lou
Elias, who fumbled when lackled.
Camera recovered for the In
dians. Again Stanford could not
make a first down and Brodie's
ill - fated punt was blocked by
Smith. v
After O'Garro scored with the
blocked punt, Shinnick kicked the
extra point out of Griffin's hands.
The game was less than nine min
utes old and the Bruins had
scored their last points. But it
was enough.
Card halfback Doug Dick re
covered a UCLA fumble on the
Card 44 in the second quarter.
Jack Douglas came into the game
and directed the Indians to their
first TD. Valli plunged over right
tackle from three yards out to
score. Douglas held and Raftery's
conversion was good.
Second Half
Stanford opened the second
half like a new ball club. Young
returned O'Garro's kick 22 yards.
Six plays later the Indians scored
in a drive that featured a 15-yard
run by Young and Raftery's two
brilliant catches of lqng Brodie
passes.
Brodie held but Raftery had lit
tle chance of making his kick
good as Bruin linemen swarmed
all over the pair. Shinnick block
ed the extra point and the score
stood UCLA 14, Stanford 13.
The rest of the third and fourth
quarters, UCLA fans sat on pins
and needles while Stanford fans
suffered fits of frustration.
