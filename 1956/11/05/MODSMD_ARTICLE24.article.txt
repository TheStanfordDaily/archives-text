# Soccermen Play Well in Losing, 9-1, To UBC Booters
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team
turned in one of its best perform
ances of the year in losing 9-1 to
the University of British Colum
bia here Saturday.
The visitors were the best team
seen at Stanford in a long time.
They combined a high degree of
individual skill with beautiful
teamwork. Their triangle move
ments left the Indian defenders
constantly helpless. They varied
this pattern with long cross-field
passes which invariably found a
man unmarked. They shot con
stantly, powerfully and, as can be
seen from the score,- accurately.
Everyone on the team attacked,
even the fullbacks.
The result was not long in
doubt. At 6:10 of the first half
Bruce Ashdown scored and from
then on the goals flooded in until
ÜBC led 7-0 at halftime. Stanford
aided the ÜBC cause with some
badly placed passes, but that was
only part of the story. Ashdown
ended up with three goals, Bob
Arnott had four and Ed Green
and Mike Assoon one each. Six
minutes from half-time Ned Av
ary put in Stanford's lone goal.
ÜBC eased up in the second half
to make it 9-1, finally.
After the game, the Cardinal
team presented the visitors with
a trophy in honor of their first
visit to Stanford. Next year Stan
ford will journey to Vancouver.
