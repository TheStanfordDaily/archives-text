### Dick Barnes 
"I have a feeling we'll win," was Chuck Taylor's thought
on this week's Oregon State game as he relaxed in the Los An
geles Coliseum dressing room last Saturday after his Stanford
team fell to UCLA, 14-13.
Taylor naturally was disappointed about losing to the Bruins,
but quickly added that he felt the Indians had "learned a helluva
lot about football that will help next week." He did not think the
loss would hurt Stanford's chances against the Beavers in the
Rose Bowl decider.
Getting back to the UCLA game, the Stanford mentor felt that
the first quarter- was the deciding factor. UCLA was able to get
up so much momentum that they had Stanford over the barrel
and the Indians couldn't move out far enough to play their type
of game.
"I expected a rush, but not with so many men or so often,"
was Taylor's reaction to the eight-man charge the winners put on
Tribe Quarterback John Brodie. He acknowledged that it was a
smart move on Red Sanders''part and that Stanford didn't take
advantage of other opportunities the heavy rush presented.
The youthful coach had plenty of praise for UCLA, mention
ing them as a good opportunist team and a fine defensive unit,
particularly early in the game.
The play of the Indians' Jack Douglas at quarterback pleased
Taylor very much. He said Douglas did an excellent job and
played his best game of the year. The second-half defense and the
play of Guard Don Peterson also came in for favorable comment
by Taylor.
Bruin Coach Sanders suggestively commented that this "was
my most satisfying win, all things considered."
His was not the only reference by UCLA to the recent PCC
controversy. The Bruin yell leaders, band and rooting section —
apparently allowed more freedom than USC — made constant
snipes at Stanford. USC authorities the previous Saturday for
bade the Trojans to mention the incidents.
• In the second half the UCLA rooting section blossomed out
with gold halos. The band helped out by playing such songs as
"When the Saints Come Marching In" and "Halo, Everybody,
Halo" during a half-time demonstration, almost all of which was
a comic attack on Stanford's position during the.conference-wide
hassle.
The Bruin card section gave another of its excellent programs,
paying special salute to the visiting U.S. Olympic team in "Ucla
rama."
Stanford's band, 120 strong, was impressive with its sharpness
and precision-marching while giving a tribute to Rodgers and
Hammerstein.
Although the Indian card section was outnumbered by that of
UCLA, it nonetheless gave its usual good show for the more than
76,000 fans in attendance.

my most satisfying win, all things considered."
His was not the only reference by UCLA to the recent PCC
controversy. The Bruin yell leaders, band and rooting section —
apparently allowed more freedom than USC — made constant
snipes at Stanford. USC authorities the previous Saturday for
bade the Trojans to mention the incidents.
• In the second half the UCLA rooting section blossomed out
with gold halos. The band helped out by playing such songs as
"When the Saints Come Marching In" and "Halo, Everybody,
Halo" during a half-time demonstration, almost all of which was
a comic attack on Stanford's position during the.conference-wide
hassle.
The Bruin card section gave another of its excellent programs,
paying special salute to the visiting U.S. Olympic team in "Ucla
rama."
Stanford's band, 120 strong, was impressive with its sharpness
and precision-marching while giving a tribute to Rodgers and
Hammerstein.
Although the Indian card section was outnumbered by that of
UCLA, it nonetheless gave its usual good show for the more than
76,000 fans in attendance.
"I have a feeling we'll win," was Chuck Taylor's thought
on this week's Oregon State game as he relaxed in the Los An
geles Coliseum dressing room last Saturday after his Stanford
team fell to UCLA, 14-13.
Taylor naturally was disappointed about losing to the Bruins,
but quickly added that he felt the Indians had "learned a helluva
lot about football that will help next week." He did not think the
loss would hurt Stanford's chances against the Beavers in the
Rose Bowl decider.
Getting back to the UCLA game, the Stanford mentor felt that
the first quarter- was the deciding factor. UCLA was able to get
up so much momentum that they had Stanford over the barrel
and the Indians couldn't move out far enough to play their type
of game.
"I expected a rush, but not with so many men or so often,"
was Taylor's reaction to the eight-man charge the winners put on
Tribe Quarterback John Brodie. He acknowledged that it was a
smart move on Red Sanders''part and that Stanford didn't take
advantage of other opportunities the heavy rush presented.
The youthful coach had plenty of praise for UCLA, mention
ing them as a good opportunist team and a fine defensive unit,
particularly early in the game.
The play of the Indians' Jack Douglas at quarterback pleased
Taylor very much. He said Douglas did an excellent job and
played his best game of the year. The second-half defense and the
play of Guard Don Peterson also came in for favorable comment
by Taylor.
Bruin Coach Sanders suggestively commented that this "was
my most satisfying win, all things considered."
