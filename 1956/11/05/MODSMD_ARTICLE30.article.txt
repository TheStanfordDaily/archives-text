# Downton's Petition Circulation Stops
## 
### 
Petition circulator Lloyd Down
ton has temporarily stopped se
curing petitions to lower the le
gal drinking age limit in Califor
nia.
He said that if Proposition 5
passes it will mean a change in
tactics since this proposition
would place the present 21-year
age limit in the State Constitu
tion. Thus a change in the law
would have to be effected
through a referendum.
Downton plans to appear be
fore next session of ASSU
Legislature, if Proposition 5
passes to ask the legislators to
pass a resolution asking for a
drop in the legal drinking age.
"I think it is very ironical that
students in some European coun
tries are risking their lives in
support of what they feel is
right," Downton said, "while stu
dents here in this country are
afraid to risk even their names
on petitions for what they say is
right in essence."
