UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov.
4 (UP(--The United Nations Gen
eral Assembly tonight over
whelmingly approved an Ameri
can demand that Russia end its
attack on Hungarian citizens and
get its troops out of Hungary.
Most of the powerful Afro-
Asian bloc abstained as the As
sembly's emergency session ap
proved the demand by a 50-8 vote
with 15 abstentions. Russia and
the Iron Curtain bloc—with the
exception of absent Hungary —
opposed the measure.
The vote came after the United
States accused Russia of "sicken
ing duplicity and double-dealing"
in turning its army loose to con
quer Hungary while its diplomat
ic representatives were negotiat
ing with the Hungarians in Buda
pest for the withdrawal of the
troops.
Back Together
The "grand alliance" of the
Western powers, split asunder
last week when the U.S. opposed
Britain and France on the issue
of their intervention in the Is
raeli - Egyptian fighting, stood
shoulder to shoulder with their
accustomed colleagues in the
vote.
Thirteen of the 24 countries in
the Afro-Asian bloc, of which In
dia usually is acknowledged to be
a prime mover, abstained along
with Finland and Yugoslavia.
They were Afghanistan. Burma,
Ceylon, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Nepal, Saudi
Arabia, Yemen and Syria.
Opposing the resolution were
Russia, Albania, Bulgaria, Byelo
russia, Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Romania and the Ukraine.
Canadian External Affairs Min
ister Lester B. Pearson chal
lenged Russia to permit a UN po
lice force or even a fact-finding
team to enter Hungary.
Lodge Resolution
Lodge submitted a resolution,
sponsored by the United States
alone, calling on Russia and its
newly-installed Hungarian puppet
government to permit Secretary-
General Dag Hammarskjold to
send a team into the country for
an on-the-spot investigation.
"After several days," Lodge told
the Assembly's second emergency
session in 13'/2 hours, "the situa
tion in Hungary has become all
too clear. What is revealed is a
sickening picture of duplicity and
double-dealing.
"While wholesale brutality was
being perpetrated, the Soviet rep
resentative in this very room was
praising peace and non-aggression
and raising his hands in horror
against the bloodshed in the Mid
dle East. We who are striving for
peace in the Middle East can
never forget this cynicism."
"Drastic Action"
Lodge told the Assembly that i
it must take "drastic action" to
deal with the Soviet attack.
His resolution said the Hunga
rian people had a right "to a gov
ernment responsive to its national
aspirations and dedicated to its
independence and well-being."
The resolution "deplores" the
use of "Soviet military forces to
suppress the efforts of the Hun
garian people to reassert their
rights." It takes note of the ap
peal of deposed Hungarian Pre
mier Nagy for an Assembly de
bate on the situation in Hungary
and points out that .Russia has
boasted of its "avowed policy of
non-intervention in the internal
affairs of other states."
