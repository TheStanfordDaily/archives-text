# Officials Ask: Is Khrushchev Losing Hold?

### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UP) —
Russia's savage attack in stamp
ing out the Hungarian revolt
prompted speculation hero today
that Soviet Communist party
boss Nikita Khrushchev may he
losing his hold on the Kremlin.
The heavy-handed Soviet crack
down was a startling reversal of
the soft line Moscow has followed
toward its satellites since Stalin's
death. Khrushchev is regarded as
the chief architect of the softer
line.
There were no reports received
here, however, that a Kremlin
shakeup was in-the works.
State Department experts had
feared a crackdown on Hungary
might come after Soviet troops
began re-entering the country af
ter first heading out of it. Some
officials wondered whether Rus
sia might also strike at Poland to
stamp out groups which rose
there against Moscow's iron grip.
Officials here believed the Brit
ish-French strike in the Sue/ Ca
nal Zone convinced Russia she
could get away with the brutal
smash at Hungary. They eiled
these factors:
• The split between the Big
Three Western allies over British
and French attacks on the Sue/
area. Russia probably felt the
Western Big Three would be un
able to get together for effective
moves against the Soviet Union.
• Charges of aggression
against Britain and France. The
Soviets probably thought Britain
and France could hardly com
plain about Russian aggression
when they were being charged
with aggression themselves.
• Preoccupation of the world
with the Suez crisis. Russia prob
ably felt the world could not
move effectively in Eastern Eu
rope while the Middle East crisis
was on. All of these gave the So
viets a good opportunity to
smash the Hungarian revolt, au
