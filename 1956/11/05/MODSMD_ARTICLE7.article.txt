# TO PREVENT MISUNDERSTANDING
## U.S. Officials Will Do 'Everything Possible' Not to Supply Troops for UN Police Force 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UP) —
American officials said today the
United States will do "everything
possible" to avoid supplying
American troops for a United Na
tions police force in the Middle
East because its motives might be
misunderstood.
They said they thought it would
be best if the force was made up
solely of soldiers from smaller
nations which could not be sus
pected of having "ulterior mo
tives" in the area.
They felt that a relatively small
force of about 5000 men should be

able to handle the situation. The
smaller, nations, they said, should
be able to provide that many
troops without difficulty.
Sherman Adams, President Eis
enhower's top White House as
sistant, said it was "very doubt
ful" this country would be asked
to provide troops. And in any
case, he said, America's role in the
U.N. police force "may be minor."
"Meet the Press"
Adams was interviewed on the
NBC-TV program "Meet the
Press." Asserting that chances
of general war are "reasonably
slim," he said he is sure there "is
going to be a way out of this
dilemma" in the Middle East.
Other officials said that if U.S.
troops arc requested, Eisenhower
almost certainly will seek con
gressional approval, in line with
his repeated pledges not to com
mit the United States to war any
where on his own.
It was not known at this time
where he would recall Congress
in special session or merely con
sult with congressional leaders.
These officials considered it un
likely that the U.N. would request
troops from any of the Big Four
the United States, Britain, Rus
sia and France.
"Clean Hands"
As they saw it, Britain and
France could hardly be asked to
contribute since they are involved
in the fighting. Russia also would
be bypassed because of the Hun
garian situation, they said, leav
ing only the United States with
"clean hands."
Under those circumstances they
thought the United States like
wise would be passed over.
Most sources here saw the pro
posed Middle East action as vastly
different from the "police force"
that fought in Korea.
They said that in Korea the
force fought to put down an ag
gressor which was fighting at the
time of the police action. In the
Middle East the officials expect
that actual hostilities would cease
and the police force merely would
act to maintain the peace.
Choose Government
President Eisenhower urgently
appealed 1o Soviet Premier Niko
lai A Bulganin today to withdraw
Russian troops from Hungary and
let the Hungarian people choose
their own government.
Simultaneously, the White
House said "new moves" may be
undertaken in the United Nations
regarding Hungary, where Rus
sian armed might has crushed a
freedom rebellion. A new pro-
Moscow puppet government was
installed.
Eisenhower sent an urgent
cable to Bulganin after holding an
extraordinary Sunday conference
with Acting Secretary of State
Herbert Hoover Jr. and Allen Dul
les, heat! of the Central Intelli
gence Agency.
The text of the President's mes
sage was not made public imme

cliately. But Eisenhower declared
in a special statement that the
White House conference dealt
with '"ways and means" to get
Soviet troops out of Hungary and
give the people a government of
their choice.
Eisenhower said the world,
which was heartened just a few
days ago by the news that Russia
promised to withdraw its troops
from Hungary, "has now suffered
corresponding shock and dismay
at the Soviet attack on the people
and government of Hungary."

WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UP) —
American officials said today the
United States will do "everything
possible" to avoid supplying
American troops for a United Na
tions police force in the Middle
East because its motives might be
misunderstood.
They said they thought it would
be best if the force was made up
solely of soldiers from smaller
nations which could not be sus
pected of having "ulterior mo
tives" in the area.
They felt that a relatively small
force of about 5000 men should be

able to handle the situation. The
smaller, nations, they said, should
be able to provide that many
troops without difficulty.
Sherman Adams, President Eis
enhower's top White House as
sistant, said it was "very doubt
ful" this country would be asked
to provide troops. And in any
case, he said, America's role in the
U.N. police force "may be minor."
"Meet the Press"
Adams was interviewed on the
NBC-TV program "Meet the
Press." Asserting that chances
of general war are "reasonably
slim," he said he is sure there "is
going to be a way out of this
dilemma" in the Middle East.
Other officials said that if U.S.
troops arc requested, Eisenhower
almost certainly will seek con
gressional approval, in line with
his repeated pledges not to com
mit the United States to war any
where on his own.
It was not known at this time
where he would recall Congress
in special session or merely con
sult with congressional leaders.
These officials considered it un
likely that the U.N. would request
troops from any of the Big Four
the United States, Britain, Rus
sia and France.
"Clean Hands"
As they saw it, Britain and
France could hardly be asked to
contribute since they are involved
in the fighting. Russia also would
be bypassed because of the Hun
garian situation, they said, leav
ing only the United States with
"clean hands."
Under those circumstances they
thought the United States like
wise would be passed over.
Most sources here saw the pro
posed Middle East action as vastly
different from the "police force"
that fought in Korea.
They said that in Korea the
force fought to put down an ag
gressor which was fighting at the
time of the police action. In the
Middle East the officials expect
that actual hostilities would cease
and the police force merely would
act to maintain the peace.
Choose Government
President Eisenhower urgently
appealed 1o Soviet Premier Niko
lai A Bulganin today to withdraw
Russian troops from Hungary and
let the Hungarian people choose
their own government.
Simultaneously, the White
House said "new moves" may be
undertaken in the United Nations
regarding Hungary, where Rus
sian armed might has crushed a
freedom rebellion. A new pro-
Moscow puppet government was
installed.
Eisenhower sent an urgent
cable to Bulganin after holding an
extraordinary Sunday conference
with Acting Secretary of State
Herbert Hoover Jr. and Allen Dul
les, heat! of the Central Intelli
gence Agency.
