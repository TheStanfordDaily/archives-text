LONDON, Monday, Nov. 5 (UP>—British and French tore-,

Paratroopers with heavy equipment, including jeeps, began drop
ping on Egyptian soil at dawn.
An official communique announced start of thf attack aI hi I.'

hours of blackout imposed to
screen the movements of an ar
maria of ships and men which left
the Brilish-French base of Cyprus
Sunday morning.
First reports said the invaders
had three prime objectives:
• Port Said, at the Mediterra
nean end of the canal.
• Ismailia, midway point in the
waterway.
• Suez, at the southern termi
nus.
In the predawn darkness trans
port planes took off loaded with
paratroopers and their equip
ment. The big four-engined trans
ports went into the air at 30-see
ond intervals.
For five days British and
French jet bombers and fighters
had raked Egyptian airfields and
armored concentrations. A com
munique Sunday announced that
the Egyptian airforce had "ceased
to exist."
Correspondents on Cyprus, the
main invasion base, were permit
ted to report that French and
British troops boarded ships
"somewhere" on the island yes
terday.
Dawn Fight
First reports said British para
troopers took off at dawn this
morning from Cyprus. They car
ried heavy equipment, including
jeeps.
The invasion has been expected
almost momentarily since last
Tuesday morning when the Brit
ish - French ultimatum to Egypt
and Israel to pull back their
troops 10 miles from the Suez
Canal ran out.
The Anglo-French invasion
forces are expected to meet heavy
resistance. Military information
has shown Egypt has massed
heavy armor around the three key
canal cities since Egyptian forces
pulled back from the Sinai penin
sula after their defeat by the Is
raeli army.
The big transport planes took
off in the pre dawn darkness load
ed with the paratroopers and their
equipment. The four-e ngi n e d
planes went into the air at 30-
second intervals, the report said.
Hour's Distance
Cyprus is little more than 200
miles north of the northern coast
of Egypt — about one hour by
plane.
The invasion was launched aft
er days of' air raids by British
and French planes. The Anglo-
French air fleets pounded Egyp
t i a n military installations and
knocked out the Egyptian airforce
to pave the way for the landing
of troops.
Eden Demand
Last Monday, British Prime
Minister Sir Anthony Eden had
announced in the House of Com
mons that Britain and France
were demanding of Egypt per
mission to occupy the Canal Zone
"temporarily," until Egypt and
Israel stopped fighting.
Egyptian President Gamal Ab
del Nasser flatly refused.
Twelve hours after Eden's an
nouncement, a British and
French ultimatum ran out and
another 12 hours later the Brit
ish and French air attacks began.
On Saturday and Sunday the
round-the-clock air attacks were
diverted to final preparations for
this morning's invasion. They hit
installations and marshaling
yards.
