# Five Political Science Professors Predict Ike Victory, Close House Race
## 
### Wally Simpson 
Dwight D. Eisenhower will win again.
This was the consensus opinion of five political science profes
sors: Thomas S. Barclay, Cornelius P. Cotter, Robert A. Horn, Hu
bert R. Marshall and Robert A. Walker.
All five professors predicted Democrats will retain control of
the United States Senate, but they split 3-1, with one undecided,
that Democrats will also retain control of the House of Representa
tives.
On California's Senatorial race three of them believe that Thom
as H. Kuchel will win over Richard Richards, but they all admit
that the race will be very close.
Marshall believes that Eisenhower's victory will hinge on two
factors operating at the present time. The American people, he be
lieves, want to preserve the social-welfare gains of the "New Deal"
era. They also want it extended gradually.
basically, he said, "they don t trust the Republicans as a party.
That is why they will elect a Democratic Congress." However, he
feels Ihrit the people believe that Eisenhower likes and will defend
these gains.
" I he people look upon Ike as a 'father' type image. It's part of

the personality cult. He's not regarded as a leader like Roosevelt,
but as a kindly, impartial President."
Marshall believes that the people don't want a person in as
President who will "rock the boat." He said he thought that the
people want a period of "quiet" and they feel that a Democratic
chief executive would lead the United States into periods of crisis.
"History, said Marshall, "will probably regard Ike as a weak
Piesident, but not a bad President—a President who gave the
people what they wanted. Eisenhower doesn't make the issues—he
responds to them."
Cotter said he believes Eisenhower will win with about the same
proportion of votes as in 1952. Most people, he said, are framing
their voting intentions in the last three weeks. The international
situation was the top deciding issue in the '52 elections. Cotter said
that Eisenhower benefited then. He thinks Eisenhower should
benefit now—especially after the events of the last couple of weeks.
Cotter believes that the results of today's election will create a
situation not seen in the United States since the election of Presi
dent Taylor in 1848. It will be the first time, he believes, that the
American people will put a President into office without putting
in a Congress of the same party in over 100 years.
Cotter believes that Kuchel will win because he is less dependent

on Eisenhower's coattails than other candidates. Kuchel, he said,
has a good record as Senator and has campaigned actively the past
week. It depends on the size of the Republican turnout.
Horn differs from his colleagues in that he believes that the
Republicans will squeak through with a majority in the House.
However, he said, it will be so close that it is really a toss-up.
Horn also felt that Kuchel would win. As far as why Eisen
hower would win Horn said, "I think it's really true that people
like Ike and they like what he's done also what he hasn't done."
.The effect of the events in the past two weeks is a toss-up, Horn
believes. He said that he felt that some of the "doubtful" persons
will be tipped over into Stevenson's column, but more will probably
go over to Eisenhower,
Barclay was undecided on how the House elections would turn
out. "It could go either way," he said. He also felt that Kuchel
would win—"but by a very slim majority."
Eisenhower has been able to hold enough of the groups that
elected him in 19.>2 to be elected now, Barclay said. The people are
reasonably satisfied with his administration. Even dissatisfied agri
cultural areas that are normally Republican will probably go Re
publican again, he believes.

"Prosperity," Barclay said, "is of course the great issue in nor
mal times." He said that he feels the people will attribute the
current prosperity to Eisenhower's administration.
Walker was hesitant about predicting a winner in the Presi
dential race. He said, "It will be very close. Stevenson has a fai
better chance than most prognosticators would lead one to believe."
He said that he was inclined to think that the California Sena
torial race will go as California goes in the Presidential election
"I think Richards has a very good chance," he said.
The Presidential race will be determined by several factoi >
Walker said. Among these will be the effect of Eisenhower's pei
sonal drawing power in contrast to the risk of having Nixon as
possible President.
It will depend in part upon whether the dissatisfaction of both
labor and agriculture is strong enough to influence the voting
Foreign policy is also a crucial issue, he said.
Walker also said that he believes Eisenhower will draw mot<
votes from women than from men. He indicated that this is an
effect of the Eisenhower personality cult. But, he said, it is a fact
that many wives will be voting for Eisenhower while their hu
bands are pulling for Stevenson.
Dwight D. Eisenhower will win again.

reasonably satisfied with his administration. Even dissatisfied agri
cultural areas that are normally Republican will probably go Re
publican again, he believes.

"Prosperity," Barclay said, "is of course the great issue in nor
mal times." He said that he feels the people will attribute the
current prosperity to Eisenhower's administration.
Walker was hesitant about predicting a winner in the Presi
dential race. He said, "It will be very close. Stevenson has a fai
better chance than most prognosticators would lead one to believe."
He said that he was inclined to think that the California Sena
torial race will go as California goes in the Presidential election
"I think Richards has a very good chance," he said.
The Presidential race will be determined by several factoi >
Walker said. Among these will be the effect of Eisenhower's pei
sonal drawing power in contrast to the risk of having Nixon as
possible President.
It will depend in part upon whether the dissatisfaction of both
labor and agriculture is strong enough to influence the voting
Foreign policy is also a crucial issue, he said.
Walker also said that he believes Eisenhower will draw mot<
votes from women than from men. He indicated that this is an
effect of the Eisenhower personality cult. But, he said, it is a fact
that many wives will be voting for Eisenhower while their hu
bands are pulling for Stevenson.
Dwight D. Eisenhower will win again.
This was the consensus opinion of five political science profes
sors: Thomas S. Barclay, Cornelius P. Cotter, Robert A. Horn, Hu
bert R. Marshall and Robert A. Walker.
All five professors predicted Democrats will retain control of
the United States Senate, but they split 3-1, with one undecided,
that Democrats will also retain control of the House of Representa
tives.
On California's Senatorial race three of them believe that Thom
as H. Kuchel will win over Richard Richards, but they all admit
that the race will be very close.
Marshall believes that Eisenhower's victory will hinge on two
factors operating at the present time. The American people, he be
lieves, want to preserve the social-welfare gains of the "New Deal"
era. They also want it extended gradually.
basically, he said, "they don t trust the Republicans as a party.
That is why they will elect a Democratic Congress." However, he
feels Ihrit the people believe that Eisenhower likes and will defend
these gains.
" I he people look upon Ike as a 'father' type image. It's part of

the personality cult. He's not regarded as a leader like Roosevelt,
but as a kindly, impartial President."
Marshall believes that the people don't want a person in as
President who will "rock the boat." He said he thought that the
people want a period of "quiet" and they feel that a Democratic
chief executive would lead the United States into periods of crisis.
"History, said Marshall, "will probably regard Ike as a weak
Piesident, but not a bad President—a President who gave the
people what they wanted. Eisenhower doesn't make the issues—he
responds to them."
Cotter said he believes Eisenhower will win with about the same
proportion of votes as in 1952. Most people, he said, are framing
their voting intentions in the last three weeks. The international
situation was the top deciding issue in the '52 elections. Cotter said
that Eisenhower benefited then. He thinks Eisenhower should
benefit now—especially after the events of the last couple of weeks.
Cotter believes that the results of today's election will create a
situation not seen in the United States since the election of Presi
dent Taylor in 1848. It will be the first time, he believes, that the
American people will put a President into office without putting
in a Congress of the same party in over 100 years.
Cotter believes that Kuchel will win because he is less dependent

on Eisenhower's coattails than other candidates. Kuchel, he said,
has a good record as Senator and has campaigned actively the past
week. It depends on the size of the Republican turnout.
Horn differs from his colleagues in that he believes that the
Republicans will squeak through with a majority in the House.
However, he said, it will be so close that it is really a toss-up.
Horn also felt that Kuchel would win. As far as why Eisen
hower would win Horn said, "I think it's really true that people
like Ike and they like what he's done also what he hasn't done."
.The effect of the events in the past two weeks is a toss-up, Horn
believes. He said that he felt that some of the "doubtful" persons
will be tipped over into Stevenson's column, but more will probably
go over to Eisenhower,
Barclay was undecided on how the House elections would turn
out. "It could go either way," he said. He also felt that Kuchel
would win—"but by a very slim majority."

American people will put a President into office without putting
in a Congress of the same party in over 100 years.
Cotter believes that Kuchel will win because he is less dependent

on Eisenhower's coattails than other candidates. Kuchel, he said,
has a good record as Senator and has campaigned actively the past
week. It depends on the size of the Republican turnout.
Horn differs from his colleagues in that he believes that the
Republicans will squeak through with a majority in the House.
However, he said, it will be so close that it is really a toss-up.
Horn also felt that Kuchel would win. As far as why Eisen
hower would win Horn said, "I think it's really true that people
like Ike and they like what he's done also what he hasn't done."
.The effect of the events in the past two weeks is a toss-up, Horn
believes. He said that he felt that some of the "doubtful" persons
will be tipped over into Stevenson's column, but more will probably
go over to Eisenhower,
Barclay was undecided on how the House elections would turn
out. "It could go either way," he said. He also felt that Kuchel
would win—"but by a very slim majority."
Eisenhower has been able to hold enough of the groups that
elected him in 19.>2 to be elected now, Barclay said. The people are
reasonably satisfied with his administration. Even dissatisfied agri
cultural areas that are normally Republican will probably go Re
publican again, he believes.

"Prosperity," Barclay said, "is of course the great issue in nor
mal times." He said that he feels the people will attribute the
current prosperity to Eisenhower's administration.
Walker was hesitant about predicting a winner in the Presi
dential race. He said, "It will be very close. Stevenson has a fai
better chance than most prognosticators would lead one to believe."
He said that he was inclined to think that the California Sena
torial race will go as California goes in the Presidential election
"I think Richards has a very good chance," he said.
The Presidential race will be determined by several factoi >
Walker said. Among these will be the effect of Eisenhower's pei
sonal drawing power in contrast to the risk of having Nixon as
possible President.
It will depend in part upon whether the dissatisfaction of both
labor and agriculture is strong enough to influence the voting
Foreign policy is also a crucial issue, he said.
Walker also said that he believes Eisenhower will draw mot<
votes from women than from men. He indicated that this is an
effect of the Eisenhower personality cult. But, he said, it is a fact
that many wives will be voting for Eisenhower while their hu
bands are pulling for Stevenson.
Dwight D. Eisenhower will win again.
This was the consensus opinion of five political science profes
sors: Thomas S. Barclay, Cornelius P. Cotter, Robert A. Horn, Hu
bert R. Marshall and Robert A. Walker.
All five professors predicted Democrats will retain control of
the United States Senate, but they split 3-1, with one undecided,
that Democrats will also retain control of the House of Representa
tives.
On California's Senatorial race three of them believe that Thom
as H. Kuchel will win over Richard Richards, but they all admit
that the race will be very close.
Marshall believes that Eisenhower's victory will hinge on two
factors operating at the present time. The American people, he be
lieves, want to preserve the social-welfare gains of the "New Deal"
era. They also want it extended gradually.
basically, he said, "they don t trust the Republicans as a party.
That is why they will elect a Democratic Congress." However, he
feels Ihrit the people believe that Eisenhower likes and will defend
these gains.
" I he people look upon Ike as a 'father' type image. It's part of

the personality cult. He's not regarded as a leader like Roosevelt,
but as a kindly, impartial President."
Marshall believes that the people don't want a person in as
President who will "rock the boat." He said he thought that the
people want a period of "quiet" and they feel that a Democratic
chief executive would lead the United States into periods of crisis.
"History, said Marshall, "will probably regard Ike as a weak
Piesident, but not a bad President—a President who gave the
people what they wanted. Eisenhower doesn't make the issues—he
responds to them."
Cotter said he believes Eisenhower will win with about the same
proportion of votes as in 1952. Most people, he said, are framing
their voting intentions in the last three weeks. The international
situation was the top deciding issue in the '52 elections. Cotter said
that Eisenhower benefited then. He thinks Eisenhower should
benefit now—especially after the events of the last couple of weeks.
Cotter believes that the results of today's election will create a
situation not seen in the United States since the election of Presi
dent Taylor in 1848. It will be the first time, he believes, that the
American people will put a President into office without putting
in a Congress of the same party in over 100 years.
