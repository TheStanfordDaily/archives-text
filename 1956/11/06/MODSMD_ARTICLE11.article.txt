### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (UP)
Senator William F. Knowland
proposed today that the free
world eject Russia from the Unit
ed Na'tions and form a volunteer
fighting force if the Soviet Uniyn
refuses to withdraw from Hun
gary.
He proposed the following
"successive steps" if Russia does
not withdraw from Hungary
"within a limited stipulated pe
riod":
• "Condemn the Soviet Union
as an aggressor and as an impos
er of Communist tyranny by mili
tary force."
• "IntrorlifHion of a resolution
expelling the Soviet Union" from
the UN.
• "Apply economic sanctions
against the Soviet Union and any
satellite that supports the aggres
sor against Hungary."
• "Withdrawal of recognition
of the Soviet Union by the free
nations of the world."
• "Encourage the organization
of a non-official international vol
unteer 'Crusade for Freedom.'"
He said such a fighting force
would be similar to the "Flying
Tigers" who fought with China
against Japan.
Knowland said the "Crusaders"
might "include not only Hunga
rian exiles who are able to fight
for their country's freedom but
also volunteers from all over the
world."
