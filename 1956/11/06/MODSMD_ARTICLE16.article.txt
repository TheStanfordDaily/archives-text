# The
						Man for the Office

Today the nation goes to the polls to elect a
I'resident who during the next few months will
meet one ol" the greatest conglomerations of
crises and challenges ever to face the country.
Unfortunately enough, the issue of foreign
policy no longer remains "hidden," hut has
hurst forth with a ferocity that far surpasses the
burning Korean War issue of 1952. Whether the
voter will connect Eisenhower's policies with
the current crises is a question that will he an
swered only when the results of today's election
are tallied.
Vl e strongly endorse Stevenson over Eisen
hower, for we feel the past Administration has
been awesomely unaware of the international
tensions that have given rise to the recent holo
caust, despite the warnings shouted by those
whom the Republicans have labeled "prophets
of doom and gloom." uic "peace" claims of the
Republican party have been prove*] hollow
and deeply ironic bases for support of the Eisen
hower administration.
As Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt found during the crises that
threatened their administrations, a President
must be all things at all times, must work to the
very limit of his capacities to give absolute
direction ( and not just guidance) to the policies
;md actions of his government, and must not be
a 'part-time President" in any sense of the
word.
Forgetting the retrospective argument over
the strength or weakness of the past Adminis
tration and turning to the demands incumbent
on the next, one is immediately brought face to
lace with the question of whether Eisenhower
has the physical strength to endure the strain.
I he possibility of Richard Nixon acceding to
the Presidency is a fact that must be faced, how
ever regrettably.
By his personal popularity, charm and sin
cereK high-toned intentions, Eisenhower has
proved to he a successful conciliator of factions
both in this country especially among the vari
ous wings of his own party —and iu the interna

tional sphere when, and only when, all nations
are desirous of peace. But at a time of crisis
more is needed than good intentions.
Many leel the President should he re-elected
on two counts: that as a military man lu* is
more qualified to meet the military challenge in
luture crises, ami that his opponent, Adlai
Stevenson, has had an insufficient background
in international affairs.
In the first place, military experience is not
synonymous with diplomatic abilities, and it is
during the immediate future that the delicate
handling of international diplomacy may mark
the path of this country toward either peace or
war. Despite the desperate reversal to Stalinist
tactics and scorn for world opinion evinced
during the last week by the Soviet Union, it
remains highly doubtful lluit the Soviets seek
immediate entanglement with the United States,
especially in view of the fact that Kremlin
leaders may now he preoccupied with a struggle
lor power among themselves. The real danger
is a slow, painful succession of crises that will
unavoidably bring us to ;i head-on clash with
the Soviet Union.
What about Stevenson's qualifications? He
has traveled widely, written extensively and in
telligently on international problems and has
eminently respected men including Chester
Bowles and (Jeorge Kennan working with him.
His practical experience includes service as
special assistant and adviser to Navv Secretary
Frank Knox, delegate to I lie Sail Francisco con
ference ol the I nited Nations and alternate
delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1947.
At this moment in history the nation needs
a President who can olVcr his people strength
and wisdom of leadership beyond that w liich
has been offered during the past few years. It
needs a President who understands and does
not gloss over the failures of American diplo
macy which have in pari contributed to the
international fiasco which we are now facing.
Because we feel Stevenson offers the qualifica
tions and capacities for such leadership, we
strongly urge his election as President.
