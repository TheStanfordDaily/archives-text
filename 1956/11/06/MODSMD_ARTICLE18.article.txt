## Oregon Campus Goes GOP in Straw Vote 
### Mary Ellen Romney 
Crises occur the Middle East, election day
draws near and college newspapers across the
country bemoan the lack of political enthusiasm
on their campuses in their editorial columns
while homecoming celebrations and football
forays take top spot on the front page.
University of Oregon Daily Emerald took a
survey of student political opinion in an all
campus straw vote last week. Nearly 2500 voted
in the canvass, which gave the Republicans
sweeping victories in national and local contests.
Each campus living group was a separate
precinct in the straw vote. The fraternities and
sororities proved to be slightly more GOP than
independents, who gave Senator-Wayne Morse a
narrow edge over OOP Douglas McKay.
President Eisenhower won by a margin of
1837 to 669 over Adlai Stevenson in the Oregon
poll. McKay beat incumbent Morse in the over
all university tabulation, in a close race. The stu
dents also expressed approval, 1641 to 527, of
federal aid to schools.
The poll was a repeat of a similar project
undertaken by the Emerald in 1932, when the
campus elected Herbert Hoover over Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.

At University of Washington, a novel solu-*
tion has been proposed to solve the campus's
acute parking problem. Faced with the familiar
dilemma of a campus not planned for automo
biles, Washington two years ago barred through
traffic to the campus.
Now a ramp with a moving sidewalk to trans
port students from parking areas to the campus
has been proposed, and is being considered by
the university's Board of Regents.
The project would cost from $280,000 to
$600,000, arid would be similar to escalators

presently in use at airports and exhibition halls.
Other solutions to the problem, such as a
three-story parking building with elevators or
underground garages, would cost even more, the
university architect reported. The situation may
become even more acute because of projected
roads which would take existing parking space.
The editor of the Daily Californian, Bob Falk,
last week paid editorial tribute to Professor Jo
seph Cohen of the University of Colorado and his
Committee on Occasional Silence. It seems that
Cohen last spring had installed a new record in
the coffee shop of the student union at the Colo
rado campus. The record, when selected and paid
for, consisted of a soft voice saying, "The next
three minutes of silence have been paid for by a
lover of silence." And then silence.
"But," commented the Daily Californian,
"loud is the voice of the despot. Again all was
sound and fury. The silent record was removed
this summer by order of the controlling board
of the Colorado student union. There will be no
quiet return to the ideals of a progressive, lais
sez-faire economy on the Colorado campus."
No one seems to have missed the record, ex
cept Professor Cohen, the Colorado Daily and
the UC editor. Falk regrets the fact that silence
will not be given a place in the free, competitive
juke box market. "Faculty members- even Co
hen's colleagues in the philosophy department—
are in their ivory tower*, and have not been
heard from. They have forgotten that in the
war of ideas there can be no neutrality. Their
silence is ammunition for the forces of Noise.
"Meanwhile 'the rights of the minority are
helplessly rocked and rolled by the tyranny of
the majority," Falk concluded, "and Joseph Co
hen and his Committee on Occasional Silence are
held at bay by Elvis Presley and his Hound Dog."

Now a ramp with a moving sidewalk to trans
port students from parking areas to the campus
has been proposed, and is being considered by
the university's Board of Regents.
The project would cost from $280,000 to
$600,000, arid would be similar to escalators

presently in use at airports and exhibition halls.
Other solutions to the problem, such as a
three-story parking building with elevators or
underground garages, would cost even more, the
university architect reported. The situation may
become even more acute because of projected
roads which would take existing parking space.
The editor of the Daily Californian, Bob Falk,
last week paid editorial tribute to Professor Jo
seph Cohen of the University of Colorado and his
Committee on Occasional Silence. It seems that
Cohen last spring had installed a new record in
the coffee shop of the student union at the Colo
rado campus. The record, when selected and paid
for, consisted of a soft voice saying, "The next
three minutes of silence have been paid for by a
lover of silence." And then silence.
"But," commented the Daily Californian,
"loud is the voice of the despot. Again all was
sound and fury. The silent record was removed
this summer by order of the controlling board
of the Colorado student union. There will be no
quiet return to the ideals of a progressive, lais
sez-faire economy on the Colorado campus."
No one seems to have missed the record, ex
cept Professor Cohen, the Colorado Daily and
the UC editor. Falk regrets the fact that silence
will not be given a place in the free, competitive
juke box market. "Faculty members- even Co
hen's colleagues in the philosophy department—
are in their ivory tower*, and have not been
heard from. They have forgotten that in the
war of ideas there can be no neutrality. Their
silence is ammunition for the forces of Noise.
"Meanwhile 'the rights of the minority are
helplessly rocked and rolled by the tyranny of
the majority," Falk concluded, "and Joseph Co
hen and his Committee on Occasional Silence are
held at bay by Elvis Presley and his Hound Dog."
Crises occur the Middle East, election day
draws near and college newspapers across the
country bemoan the lack of political enthusiasm
on their campuses in their editorial columns
while homecoming celebrations and football
forays take top spot on the front page.
University of Oregon Daily Emerald took a
survey of student political opinion in an all
campus straw vote last week. Nearly 2500 voted
in the canvass, which gave the Republicans
sweeping victories in national and local contests.
Each campus living group was a separate
precinct in the straw vote. The fraternities and
sororities proved to be slightly more GOP than
independents, who gave Senator-Wayne Morse a
narrow edge over OOP Douglas McKay.
President Eisenhower won by a margin of
1837 to 669 over Adlai Stevenson in the Oregon
poll. McKay beat incumbent Morse in the over
all university tabulation, in a close race. The stu
dents also expressed approval, 1641 to 527, of
federal aid to schools.
The poll was a repeat of a similar project
undertaken by the Emerald in 1932, when the
campus elected Herbert Hoover over Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.

At University of Washington, a novel solu-*
tion has been proposed to solve the campus's
acute parking problem. Faced with the familiar
dilemma of a campus not planned for automo
biles, Washington two years ago barred through
traffic to the campus.
