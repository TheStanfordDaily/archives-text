'No' oil Proposition I
Editor, The Daily:
On today's hallot Proposition Four would
set up a commission to regulate all California oil
production. II adopted, ilie proposition would
permit the owners of 75 per cent <>f the land of
an oil pool to force all the owners in the pool to
operate the pool as one unit. The proponents of
this proposition claim that under the present
system fear of having his oil drained out from
under him encourages the owner of oil land to
drill wells. The proponents further claim that
oil production would he more efficient if fewer
wells were drilled in each oil field. This is not
true.
Oil engineers state that having a large
number of wells in a pool is not usually ineffi
cient. Oil pools are usually irregularly formed,
and wells to tap all the irregularities are needed.
Furthermore, ii is seldom harmful to drill many
wells in an oil field unless gas is allowed to
escape. California law specifically forbids the
allowing of gas to escape and establishes heavy
fines for violations.
It Proposition Four is adopted, the present
competitive system will be abolished. At the
present time, California oil law includes the
"rule of capture," which provides that a land
owner may pump oil out of a pool lying partly
under his property, even though the pool may
also lie under someone else's property. The law
has provisions preventing drilling close to bound
ary lines, in addition to provisions preventing
other abuses.
This rule of capture is necessary. Without
such a rule, the owner of land containing only
part of an oil pool could prevent anyone else
from drilling the same pool from adjoining prop
erty.
Proposition Four will permit persons holding
75 per cent of the land over a pool to control
that pool's production. The sponsors of this
proposition are large oil companies, all produc
ing the vast majority of their oil outside Cali
fornia. if tho proposition is passed, these com
panies will control most of California's oil fields,
because of their extensive land holdings. Conse
quently. they will control California's oil produc
tion and will be in a position to import their
foreign oil at a large profit.
Since California already has strict and well
enforced conservation laws, which were reviewed
and brought up to date by the Legislature in
1955, Proposition Four is not needed.

Even if California did need this proposition,
it should still he defeated on the hallot. It is an
initiative measure; any amendments will have to
be approved by the people in a general election.
The proposition is 32 pages long. If adopted, it
would undoubtedly have some unworkable pro
visions which the legislature could not correct.
The (iil industry is changing rapidly. Will this
law change with it?

Social Regulations
Editor, The Daily:
The social regulations are being implanted
in the new dorm where we live, and watching the
process has caused us to meditate a little. We
have discussed the system between ourselves; we
have perused the booklet entitled "Social Regu
lations Made by and for the Women of Stanford
ford University." Some interesting facts
have emerged, and now we would appreciate out
side comment.
The Social Regulations Committee (seven
members) is appointed by the AWS Cabinet.
When necessary, it proposes new rules, which
become law if passed by the AWS Cabinet. All
other aspects of the social regulations are left
up to Women's Council, a board of five women
elected by the women students annually. These
five have almost overwhelming responsibilities.
For one thing, no records of past judgments are
kept (or so they have personally told one of us);
lot' another, they are elected for only a year, and
so can have had little or no previous experience.
These lacks of precedents and experience re
sult in a certain amount of unevenness in their
decisions; in fact, penalties for the same offense
have ranged from writing an essay to the sever
est probation. That is not the gills' fault. It is
unavoidable under the system.
Most important, these five girls have a great
deal of power:
• Women's Council alone interprets social
regulations.
• It hears all appeals from violators.
• It determines the guilt or innocence of an
offender, often solely on Ihe basis of her word
against another's.
• It decides on Ihe penalties to be paid.
This may well be the easiest system. The as
sumption that it is the best is open, we feel, to'
doubt.
