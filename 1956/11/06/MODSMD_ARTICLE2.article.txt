however, it was a different story.
Most observers gave the Demo
crats a better than even chance to
retain control.
Both parties wound up their
campaigns with nationwide tele
vision galas featuring Eisenhow
er and Stevenson and their two
running mates — Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon and Senator
Estes Kefauver.

that he pledged himself to strive
"for the kind of peace the whole
world can participate in."
"The great objective of all
Americans remains true peace,"
he said. "There must be one law
for all not just for us. Our
hearts go out for the people of
Hungary and the Middle East.
We will keep working for the
kind of peace the whole world
can participate in."
Also in Boston, Adlai E. Steven
son said that "every piece of sci
entific evidence" we have "indi
cates that a Republican election
victory tomorrow would mean
that Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon will become President
within four years."
Policy Btast>
Stevenson concentrated his fire
on the administration's foreign
policy, which he charged "is in
disarray in all parts of the
world."
"Our policy in the Middle East
is in ruins and has furthered the
Soviet design to penetrate this
strategic area, to the great dam
age of the causfe of freedom,"
Stevenson said.

President for the next four years.
All signs, as read by pollsters
and pundits, pointed to another
Republican sweep. The odds
strongly favored Eistenhower to
defeat again the former Demo
cratic governor of Illinois, al
though perhaps by a smaller
margin than in 1952.
Congress Battle
In the battle for "Congress,
however, it was a different story.
Most observers gave the Demo
crats a better than even chance to
retain control.
Both parties wound up their
campaigns with nationwide tele
vision galas featuring Eisenhow
er and Stevenson and their two
running mates — Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon and Senator
Estes Kefauver.
Eisenhower spoke on a closed
circuit television hookup to the
people of Boston, Mass., in place
of a scheduled wind-up campaign
speech he was slated to make in
Boston before the Middle East
crisis blew up.
Peace Pledge

that he pledged himself to strive
"for the kind of peace the whole
world can participate in."
"The great objective of all
Americans remains true peace,"
he said. "There must be one law
for all not just for us. Our
hearts go out for the people of
Hungary and the Middle East.
We will keep working for the
kind of peace the whole world
can participate in."
Also in Boston, Adlai E. Steven
son said that "every piece of sci
entific evidence" we have "indi
cates that a Republican election
victory tomorrow would mean
that Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon will become President
within four years."
Policy Btast>
Stevenson concentrated his fire
on the administration's foreign
policy, which he charged "is in
disarray in all parts of the
world."
"Our policy in the Middle East
is in ruins and has furthered the
Soviet design to penetrate this
strategic area, to the great dam
age of the causfe of freedom,"
Stevenson said.
