A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED
R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when he
finished high school he wished mightily to go on with his
education. It seemed, however, a forlorn hope. Crop
failures had brought his father to the brink of disaster.
(R. L.'s father raised date palms which, in North Dakota,
is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.) Nor could
R. L.'s mother help; she had grown torpid since the death
of Rudolph Valentino.
R. L. could go to college only if he worked his way
through. This was a prospect that dismayed him.

Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pon
dering his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he
came upon a park bench and sat down and lit a Philip
Morris. (There is no occasion, happy or sad, pensive or
exuberant, when Philip Morris is not entirely welcome,
as you will discover when you go to your favorite tobacco
counter and buy some.)
R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, "My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?"
Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with
wispy, snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent,
showing a delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His
back was bent, and his hands trembled. "Do you think,
sir," said R.L., "that a boy can work his way through
college and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?"
"Why, bless you, son," replied the stranger with a
rheumy chuckle, "of course. In fact, I did it myself."
"Was it very hard?" asked R. L.
"Yes, it was hard," the stranger admitted. "But when
one is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used
to get up at five o'clock every morning to stoke the
furnace at the SAE house. At six I had to milk the ewes
at the school of animal husbandry. At seven I gave a
fencing lesson to the Dean of Women. At eight I had a
class in early Runic poets. At nine I gave haircuts at the
Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had differential cal
culus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve 1
watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in
Oriental languages. At two I exercised the mice in psych
lab. At three I gave the Dean of Women another fencing
lesson. At four I had qualitative analysis. At five I
went clamming. At six I cut meat for the football team.
At seven I ushed at the movies. At eight I had my ears
pierced so that at nine I could tell fortunes in a gypsy
tea room. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At eleven
I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and at
three I went to sleep."
"Sir," cried R. L., "I am moved and inspired by your
shining example!"
"It was nothing," said the stranger modestly, shaking
his frail white head. "It was just hard work, and hard
work never hurt anybody."
"Would you mind telling me, sir," said R. L., "how
old you are now ?"
"Twenty-two," said the stranger.

A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED
R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when he
finished high school he wished mightily to go on with his
education. It seemed, however, a forlorn hope. Crop
failures had brought his father to the brink of disaster.
(R. L.'s father raised date palms which, in North Dakota,
is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.) Nor could
R. L.'s mother help; she had grown torpid since the death
of Rudolph Valentino.
R. L. could go to college only if he worked his way
through. This was a prospect that dismayed him.

Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pon
dering his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he
came upon a park bench and sat down and lit a Philip
Morris. (There is no occasion, happy or sad, pensive or
exuberant, when Philip Morris is not entirely welcome,
as you will discover when you go to your favorite tobacco
counter and buy some.)
R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, "My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?"
Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with
wispy, snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent,
showing a delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His
back was bent, and his hands trembled. "Do you think,
sir," said R.L., "that a boy can work his way through
college and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?"
"Why, bless you, son," replied the stranger with a
rheumy chuckle, "of course. In fact, I did it myself."
"Was it very hard?" asked R. L.
"Yes, it was hard," the stranger admitted. "But when
one is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used
to get up at five o'clock every morning to stoke the
furnace at the SAE house. At six I had to milk the ewes
at the school of animal husbandry. At seven I gave a
fencing lesson to the Dean of Women. At eight I had a
class in early Runic poets. At nine I gave haircuts at the
Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had differential cal
culus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve 1
watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in
Oriental languages. At two I exercised the mice in psych
lab. At three I gave the Dean of Women another fencing
lesson. At four I had qualitative analysis. At five I
went clamming. At six I cut meat for the football team.
At seven I ushed at the movies. At eight I had my ears
pierced so that at nine I could tell fortunes in a gypsy
tea room. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At eleven
I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and at
three I went to sleep."
"Sir," cried R. L., "I am moved and inspired by your
shining example!"
"It was nothing," said the stranger modestly, shaking
his frail white head. "It was just hard work, and hard
work never hurt anybody."
"Would you mind telling me, sir," said R. L., "how
old you are now ?"
"Twenty-two," said the stranger.
