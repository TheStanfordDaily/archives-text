# Al Harrington, Card Halfback, Best Example of Word 'Desire'
## 
### Jack Rannells 
Tauasu Alvin Harrington, In
dian right halfback who led the
team last season with (5.2 yards
per-carry and 42.3 yards-per-punt
averages, is the perfect embodi
ment of the word "desire."
A graphic demonstration of
this was given in the USC game
when, after being stopped for a
three-yard gain by the entire Tro
jan line, he jumped up and was
the first man back for the huddle.
His every action seemed to cry,
"Hurry up and let's run it down
their throats again." The 190-lb.,
6 â€¢ ft. Samoan hula - hipped and
drove for a frame - jarring 38
yards in six carries in that game,
his best of the season.
A little disappointed that,
though again a statistical leader,
he has not been able to break into
the first string, Tauasu exhibits
philosophical patience in stating,
"The tiling about this college ball
is that you have just got to wait
for the breaks."
A 1 went north from his native
Samoa and entered Punahou,
high - standard Hawaiian prep
school, when he was in the eighth
grade. Before graduating in 1954
he led Punahou to its first cham
pionship in 29 years and became
the first Island footballer to
make the U.S. Prep All-American
First Team.
He floated across Ihe Pacific
on a bale of press notices and col
lege offers, but spent a year at
Menlo JC before finally deciding
to matriculate at Stanford.
Stanford's good name in the Is
lands and the fact that high
school teammate Curlie Carswell
was on the Farm were the derid

ing factors for Al. The two Puna
hou grads are Dolt fraternity
brothers.
In his post-football years, Al
hopes to attend Stanford Busi
ness School and then return to
the Hawaiian Islands and enter
the insurance business.
