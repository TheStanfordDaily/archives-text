# Stanford Faces Beavers In Conference 'Crucial'
## OSC Has High Hopes for Rose Bowl Bid After 15 Years Without Coast Title 
### Bob Mierow 
Stanford's gridiron machine, ]
fresh from a stunning defeat at
the hands of UCLA, began work
yesterday for another single
wing outfit, Oregon State.
The Beavers will enter the
Stanford Stadium Saturday after
noon with hopes of clinching
their second Rose Bowl berth
since joining the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Oregon State has actually nev
er played in the Pasadena sta- j
dium. Their only conference
championship came in 1941. The
annual classic was played in Dur- :
ham. N.C., that year due to travel
restrictions following Pearl Har
bor.
Raftery Out for Game
The cards will be going without
Mickey Raftery this week. The
little flanker back and place-kick
er, whose sensational catch Sat
urday moved the Tribe to within
one point of UCLA, suffered a
knee strain and will not see ac
tion against the Beavers.
Stanford's tackle situation was
improved yesterday when junior
John Kidd reported back in uni
form. Sophomore Troy Barbee j
had been forced into an "iron
man" position since Kidd injured
his knee.
