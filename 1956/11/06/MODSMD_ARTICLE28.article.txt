# â€œBrodie's Feet Gave Stanford Offense Away"--Sanders
## 
### 
Coach Red Sanders informed
the press today that his UCLA
football team was aided in its 14-
13 upset win over Stanford by
being "keyed" to what plays quar
terback John Brodie was calling.
Sanders said Brodie's feet were
the key that told the Bruins
whether the Indians were going
to run or pass and helped them
call defensive signals.
Chuck Taylor, Stanford men
tor, refuted Sanders' statements
immediately. "Brodie's feet were

not the reason for our Boss," he
said. "We were beaten because
we had a bad day in juM about
every department and UCLA did
a nice job of keeping on the pres
sure."
"Yes. we did change Brodie's
stance between halves to offset
that possibility," Taylor told the
Northern California Fo o t b a 11
Writers Association. "But it was
not the key to the outcome. Our
blocking was inefficient on UC
LA's rushes and we didn't do
things right."
