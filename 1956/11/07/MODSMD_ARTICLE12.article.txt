## Commendations to KZSU 
### 
Amidst the controversy over the elections and
the crises in Egypt and Hungary, Stanford's ra
dio station KZSU has done a super!) job of
keeping the campus abreast of the fast-chang
ing events.
As soon as tlie Israeli attack on the Egyptian
Sinai Peninsula began, the station interrupted
all programs with latest bulletins on the fight
ing. As the seriousness of the Middle East con
flict increased the station began a policy of in
terviews with foreign students and special com
mentary news broadcasts.
The station's broadcast hours were extended
until 2 a.m. in order to bring the latest bulle
tins. The special sessions of the United Na
tions General Assembly were given special cov
erage.
I.ast night KZSU kept the campus in touch

with the latest election results, staging an elec
tion marathon which did not go off the air
until the losing Presidential candidate had
conceded.
Throughout the night KZSU kept its listen
ers informed on all gubernatorial elections and
state and local propositions. Staff members
answered phone calls by those wanting to know
out-of-state election results.
Again interviews, this time with political
science professors, were a featured item on the
station's agenda.
KZSU is to be commended for helping to
bring the student out of his isolated, ivory
tower. With the much-bemoaned apathy to
ward anything outside campus, it is encour
aging to note that students get much more over
the air than a diet of pretty music and Stan
ford Sadie.
