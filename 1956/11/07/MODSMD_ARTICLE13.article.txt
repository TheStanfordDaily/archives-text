Editor, The Daily:
You are to be complimented on The Daily's
coverage of the election news, and Wally Simp
son's story of yesterday.
Will you kindly correct, however, a slight
error in quoting me. I did not say 1956 might
be Ihe first time in over a hundred years "that
the American people will put a President into
office without putting in a Congress "of the same
party."
This would be inaccurate in that it indicates
we have invariably selected a President and I wo
houses of Congress of the same party in Presi
dential election years.
In 1876 Republican Hayes was elected, to
gether with a Democratic House. In 1884 Demo
crat Cleveland was elected together with a Re
publican Senate.
What I did say, and is accurate, was that we
might in '56 simultaneously elect a President of

one party and Congress, bolh houses of which
are dominated by the opposite party.
We came close to doing this in 1952 when Ei
senhower was given a majority of one in the
Senate and nine in the House. But it is not since
the Whig candidate for Ihe Presidency was
elected in 1848 together with two houses domi
nated by Democrats that we have witnessed such
an occurrence.

11 was far from "encouraging" to see the re
sponse of many students to the "Crusade for

Indeed, the Communist propagandists might
well have included, in their scenes of America,
the jubilant response of American college stu
dents viewing matters of world concern.
