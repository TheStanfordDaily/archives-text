Faculty members do not leave
Stanford for salary reasons, but
because of personal factors, ac
cording to Dr. Albert Bowker, as
sistant provost.
Bowker said, "When people
leave for a major Eastern insti
tution, ij is likely that they are
well paid here and that salary is
not the ma jor reason.
"It is always attractive for an
alumnus of an institution to re
turn to his home institution as a
professor. This helps Stanford
when recruiting faculty here and
hurts Stanford when we lose fac
ulty to major Eastern institu
tions."
Bowker pointed out that the
lack of library and research fa
cilities at Stanford is a contrib
uting factor. "Also the general
intellectual climate here is as at
tractive for the faculty as it can
be. This is very nebulous and has
nothing to do with the Univer
sity.
"The student cultural activities
are not what they are at other
institutions. There is nothing we
can do about this; it is just the
sociology of the West. It is vital
and striving but it is not as in
tellectual."
"The wife is very important in
most of these crucial decisions,"
he added.
Bowker said that the college
population has increased rapidly
with a corresponding expansion
of university facilities every
where. He said there is a tremen

dous demand for people and that
more moving around can be ex
pected.
"Faculty recruitment is one of
the few fields in America where
free enterprise still dominates
the market."
Bowker warned* against over
emphasis on faculty turnover. He
said we have lost relatively few
faculty members over the past
few years and that we have
gained many "fine people."
He said, "I must admit we did
n't have a very good year last
year. We lost some good people.
However, we hired some fine peo
ple also. It would not be fair to
say the University has gone down
hill.
"A certain amount of turnover
is not unhealthy and it is cer
tainly not too serious."
Stanford has done a great deal
over the past few years to raise
faculty salaries. The Ford Foun
dation grant last year of over $2
million contained an "accomplish
ment" bonus for the University's
work in raising salaries.
The annual income from the
grant, approximately $100,000,
will be used to boost pay rates for
the faculty. Other sources for the
increase are the revenue from the
Shopping Center, the higher Med
ical and Business School tuitions
and rising gifl funds.
The 1956-57 budget set aside al

most $1 million for 609 faculty
salaries, including guest lectur
! ers. This amount represents an
all-time high and an increase of
52 per cent since 1950-51. I
The National Education Asso
ciation has just completed a na
tional study of faculty salaries.
According to their findings, the
average national faculty salary is
$5243. This figure includes the
four faculty ranks of full profes
sor, associate professor, assistant
professor and instructor.
The average faculty salary for
the Far West was $5758, higher
than for any other section of the
country. Stanford's average sal
ary for 1955-56 was $6831 and has
increased this year to $7132.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, as,
sistant to the president, said that
Stanford salaries are higher than
the national average on all levels
except that of instructor. He
added that there is a wide range
within each rank and that the
scale is highly flexible.
Cuthbertson summed up the
statistics by saying, "Consider
able progress has been made in
the last two years and we hope
to make it in the future also, not
only because of the competition
for top-flight faculty but because
of the underlying need for in
creased academic salaries as op
posed to the other professions."

Cuthbertson summed up the
statistics by saying, "Consider
able progress has been made in
the last two years and we hope
to make it in the future also, not

of the underlying need for in
creased academic salaries as op
posed to the other professions."
Faculty members do not leave
Stanford for salary reasons, but
because of personal factors, ac
cording to Dr. Albert Bowker, as
sistant provost.
Bowker said, "When people
leave for a major Eastern insti
tution, ij is likely that they are
well paid here and that salary is
not the ma jor reason.
"It is always attractive for an
alumnus of an institution to re
turn to his home institution as a
professor. This helps Stanford
when recruiting faculty here and
hurts Stanford when we lose fac
ulty to major Eastern institu
tions."
Bowker pointed out that the
lack of library and research fa
cilities at Stanford is a contrib
uting factor. "Also the general
intellectual climate here is as at
tractive for the faculty as it can
be. This is very nebulous and has
nothing to do with the Univer
sity.
"The student cultural activities
are not what they are at other
institutions. There is nothing we
can do about this; it is just the
sociology of the West. It is vital
and striving but it is not as in
tellectual."
"The wife is very important in
most of these crucial decisions,"
he added.
Bowker said that the college
population has increased rapidly
with a corresponding expansion
of university facilities every
where. He said there is a tremen

dous demand for people and that
more moving around can be ex
pected.
"Faculty recruitment is one of
the few fields in America where
free enterprise still dominates
the market."
Bowker warned* against over
emphasis on faculty turnover. He
said we have lost relatively few
faculty members over the past
few years and that we have
gained many "fine people."
He said, "I must admit we did
n't have a very good year last
year. We lost some good people.
However, we hired some fine peo
ple also. It would not be fair to
say the University has gone down
hill.
"A certain amount of turnover
is not unhealthy and it is cer
tainly not too serious."
Stanford has done a great deal
over the past few years to raise
faculty salaries. The Ford Foun
dation grant last year of over $2
million contained an "accomplish
ment" bonus for the University's
work in raising salaries.
The annual income from the
grant, approximately $100,000,
will be used to boost pay rates for
the faculty. Other sources for the
increase are the revenue from the
Shopping Center, the higher Med
ical and Business School tuitions
and rising gifl funds.
The 1956-57 budget set aside al

most $1 million for 609 faculty
salaries, including guest lectur
! ers. This amount represents an
all-time high and an increase of
52 per cent since 1950-51. I
The National Education Asso
ciation has just completed a na
tional study of faculty salaries.
According to their findings, the
average national faculty salary is
$5243. This figure includes the
four faculty ranks of full profes
sor, associate professor, assistant
professor and instructor.
The average faculty salary for
the Far West was $5758, higher
than for any other section of the
country. Stanford's average sal
ary for 1955-56 was $6831 and has
increased this year to $7132.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, as,
sistant to the president, said that
Stanford salaries are higher than
the national average on all levels
except that of instructor. He
added that there is a wide range
within each rank and that the
scale is highly flexible.
