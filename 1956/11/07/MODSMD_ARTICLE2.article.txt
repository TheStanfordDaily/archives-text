California's Republican Sena
tor Thomas H. Kuchel was as.
sured of a six-year term in the
U.S. Senate as nearly half of the
state's 25,049 precincts gave him
a lend of almost 100,000 votes.
Kuchel took an early lead on
his Democratic opponent, Rich
ard Richards, but Richards re
fused to concede the election,
promising to issue a statement
this morning.

rreated by the election of Richard
Nixon to the Vice-Presidency four
years ago. had captured 710.948
votes tf> Richards' 620,443 votes
with 11,906 precincts reported.
Richards had pinned his hopes
on a substantial majority in Los
Angeles County, but the 39-year
old L.A. attorney failed to come
close to carrying the county
where most state elections are de

While his campaign headquar

early as 9:30 p.m., Richards re
fused to give up and finally went
home to bed, promising to make
a decision in the morning.

geles County or we're not going
to win," Richards' campaign man
