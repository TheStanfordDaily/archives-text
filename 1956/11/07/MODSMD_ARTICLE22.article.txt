# Tilt With OSC to Feature 2 Man-to-Man Showdowns
## Valli, Durden Duel for Lead in PCC Scoring; All-Americans Witte, Wiggin to Clash at Tackle 
### 
Besides a battle for the Rose
Bowl, Saturday's Oregon State-
Stanford football game here will
feature two prime individual
clashes.
Indian fullback Lou Valli and
OSC wing back Earnel Durden
will be vying for the scoring lead
ership of the Pacific Coast Con
ference. Valli, second with 42
points, and Durden, third with 36
tallies, are both expected to by
pass first-place Jon Arnett of
USC Saturday.
Arnett has completed his colle
giate career.
Two All • Americans will lock
arms at tackle. The Beavers' left
tackle John Witte, a 1955 INS All-
American, will slam his 232
pounds into Indian right tackle
Paul Wiggin, an AP Ail-American
last fall.
Both Seniors
Both gridders are seniors and
both are out to seize their last
chance to play in the Rose Bowl.
Comparative scores predict an
evenly matched game. The Bea
vers chewed up Washington

State, 21-0, while Stanford whip
ped the same Cougars by an
equally decisive count of 40-26.
Both teams divided games with
USC and UCLA. Oregon State
whipped the Uclans, 21-7, but
dropped a close 21-13 game to the
Trojans.
Likewise, the Indians upset the
Men of Troy, 27-19, only to fall
before the Bruins in a 14-13 heart
breaker. ,
Yesterday's Practice
In practice yesterday, Stanford
worked out on defense against
Oregon State's single-wing at
tack. The first string scrimmaged
against the running and passing
of second and third teams using
OSC plays.
Tackle Troy Barbee, who suf
fered a slight muscle strain Mon
day, saw action yesterday.
Meanwhile in Corvallis, Proth
ro opened full-scale drills by put
ting his charges through pass-de
fense drills. The Oregon State
mentor understudied Red San
ders for six years at UCLA.
The question •to be answered
Saturday is whether Prothro can
duplicate his old boss's feat of
stopping Stanford's vaunted pass
ing attack.
