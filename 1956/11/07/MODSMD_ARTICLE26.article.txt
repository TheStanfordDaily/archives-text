# Robinson Tat, Short' But Has Lots of Fight
## 
### Bob Payne 
Short, squat . . . and terrific—
that's right guard Noel Robinson,
one of the truly outstanding Card
linemen this season.
Noel, !5-foot 9-inch, 195-pound
junior, has stood out defensively
in the middle of the Stanford line
all season; He lacks any real
weakness and has a tremendous
desire to win.
Robinson's absence was sorely
felt in last week's loss .to UCLA.
He suffered a pinched neck nerve
in practice before the game arid
saw limited action against the
Bruins. He aggravated the injury
again in practice last night but is
expected to be ready to go Satur
day against Oregon State.
Looking toward this week's all
important clash, Noel predicts a
two - touchdown victory for the
Indians. "We learned a lot in los
ing and OSC uses the same of
fense as UCLA."
A product of San Francisco'»s
St. Ignatius High School, wfyich
also produced star wingback Paul
Camera, Noel was named the out
standing player on the 1954 fresh
man team. Despite the fact that
he has been up against Michigan
State Ohio State, Southern Cali
fornia and UCLA, Robbie tabs
Oregon's Harry Mondale as the
toughest man he has faced this
season.
"He's even shorter and fatter
than me!"

"He's i'atter than me!"
