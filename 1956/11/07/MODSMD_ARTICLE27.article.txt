Some 40 juniors on the USC
and UCLA football teams are
playing their last year of college
football.

Presidents' Council met in secret
at the St. Francis Hotel and
unanimously voted to slam the lid
on further lightening of penalties
levied for conference code viola
tions.
Losing a year's eligibility as a
result of the action are such .jun
ior stars as USC's C. R. Roberts,
Don Hickman and Ernie Zampese
and UCLA's Jim Matheny, Pat
Pinkston and Hal Smith.
The Presidents-' Conference also
made these decisions upholding
earlier rulings:
• Current sophomores on the
two teams will have only one
more year to play.
• All fines levied on USC,
UCLA, California and Washing
ton will stand unchanged.
The conference also discussed
the possibility of discontinuing
the round robin schedule after
1960 and types of athletic .codes
which could be substituted for
the present one.
