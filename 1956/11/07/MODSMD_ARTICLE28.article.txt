# Underdog Often Scores Upset In Oregon State-Card Rivalry
## 
### Ted Heckathorn 
Whenever Stanford and Ore
gon State play, the underdog j
often wins. Stanford has won "18
and lost only five, hut many of
the games have been decided by 1
only one touchdown.
The Stanford-Oregon State ri-,
valry began in 1919 when the In- 1
dians played the Oregon "Ag
gies" at Corvallis, Ore.
The "Aggies," now called the
Beavers, gained 403 yards and
made 19 first downs, while the
Cards made only 69 yards and
three first downs. But Stanford
won, 14-6.
A Daily reporter wrote, "The
line held like a brick wall, which
kept the Oregon team from block
ing any of "Dink" Templeton's
kicks."
In 1940 the powerful Indians
outlasted a scrappy Beaver team,
28-14, by the great running of

Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau.
Stanford again had a winning
team in 1941, but this time the
underdog Beavers upset the In
dians, 10-0.
Heavily favored Oregon State
won the 1947 game when A 1 Prid
dy blocked a Stanford kick to
give the OSC eleven a 13-7 victory
over the fighting Indians in a
close game.
Last year an underdog Oregon
State squad surprised the Cards,
10-0, at Corvallis. OSC tailback
Joe Francis threw a 51-yard pass
to Sam Wesley to notch the
game's only touchdown and Ted
Seale kicked a field goal.
The powerful Beaver line stop
ped one Stanford drive on the
two-yard line and another on the
nine to protect their lead and win
thir fifth victory from the In
dians.
