## The 						UN and How It Works 
### 
When there is a threat to the
peace*, the UN through the General
Assembly makes long speeches and
then sets up a military forcet to
take over the action of the crim
inals and to consolidate it while the
belabored victim looks on. Surely
one of the most peculiar functions
ever undertaken by a police force!.
Kepler is naive enough to believe
that justice should apply equally to
friend and opponent. Further, he be
lieves that a genuine police action
would have led the General Assembly
last week to send "policemen" with
warrants to arrest the responsible
agents of crime: Prime Minister
Eden, Premier Ben-Gurion, Premier
Mollet, and on Saturday, Premier
Bulganin,
But that wouldn't be
"realistic'' or "practical."
And that is why Kepler runs
a bookstore:]: and the "prac
tical" men run the world.
Want to buy a book?
Namely, when one or more
pcacc-loving UN members attack and
invade another.
t Called a police force.
