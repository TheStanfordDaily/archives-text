torium at 8:15.

rial Auditorium box office for $1

This light and fanciful comedy
is one of the French author's
most popular successes in this
country. The plot concerns three
incompetent thieves in a French
resort town and their - encounter
with the two nieces of a rich
lady.
Loper Director
Robert Loper is the director of
the production. According to Lo
per-, tlie cast for "Thieves' Carni
val" is one of the most experi
enced ever to appear in a Players
production.
David O'Brien will play the
leading thief; Margaret Stewart
the indomitable Lady Hurf,
whose home the thieves visit. El
len Kay plays her worljl-weary
niece, and Andrea Herzberg the
irresistible ingenue.
William Davis will appear as
an honest young thief, William
O'Brien as a professional lady
killer and William Stewart as
Lord Edgard.
Choreography
The choreography for the play,
arranged by William Davis, be
comes an integral part of the
play's action. The play moves
rather like a comic ballet.
The music, arranged and
played by Dale Polissar, is also
a part of the action: a solo clari
netist plays the only instrument
and becomes involved in the plot.
The sets are designed to effect
a circus-like atmosphere and to
heighten the comedy's general
sense of nnreality. William Alli
son does scenery and lighting.
Both his interior and exterior set
tings are of open-lattice construc
tion, giving a feeling of lightness.
Use of Disguises
Extensive use of mpsks and
disguises is made in the play,
which is in some respects similar
to Italian comedy. The thieves
use disguises while trying to woo
Lady Hurf's nieces, and end up
fooling one another.
Although light and something
of a fantasy, the play has a point:
the difficulty in real life of dis
tinguishing the real from the un
real.
Filling out the cast in support
ing roles are Byron Sigler and
Herbert Propper as a nitwit fa
therson team; and Phil Carry,
Evelyn Dees, Stephen Berry,
James Gleason, Robert McFar
land, Peter Kump, Natasha Ma
zour, Ellen Malloch, Ruth Rad
ford, Kathleen Concannon and
Malcolm Cross.

the production. According to Lo
per-, tlie cast for "Thieves' Carni
val" is one of the most experi
enced ever to appear in a Players
production.
David O'Brien will play the
leading thief; Margaret Stewart
the indomitable Lady Hurf,
whose home the thieves visit. El
len Kay plays her worljl-weary
niece, and Andrea Herzberg the
irresistible ingenue.
William Davis will appear as
an honest young thief, William
O'Brien as a professional lady
killer and William Stewart as
Lord Edgard.
Choreography
The choreography for the play,
arranged by William Davis, be
comes an integral part of the
play's action. The play moves
rather like a comic ballet.
The music, arranged and
played by Dale Polissar, is also
a part of the action: a solo clari
netist plays the only instrument
and becomes involved in the plot.
The sets are designed to effect
a circus-like atmosphere and to
heighten the comedy's general
sense of nnreality. William Alli
son does scenery and lighting.
Both his interior and exterior set
tings are of open-lattice construc
tion, giving a feeling of lightness.
Use of Disguises
Extensive use of mpsks and
disguises is made in the play,
which is in some respects similar
to Italian comedy. The thieves
use disguises while trying to woo
Lady Hurf's nieces, and end up
fooling one another.
Although light and something
of a fantasy, the play has a point:
the difficulty in real life of dis
tinguishing the real from the un
real.
Filling out the cast in support
ing roles are Byron Sigler and
Herbert Propper as a nitwit fa
therson team; and Phil Carry,
Evelyn Dees, Stephen Berry,
James Gleason, Robert McFar
land, Peter Kump, Natasha Ma
zour, Ellen Malloch, Ruth Rad
ford, Kathleen Concannon and
Malcolm Cross.
Jean Anouilh's "Thieves' Carni
val," Stanford Players' second
production of the season, will
open tonight in Memorial Audi
torium at 8:15.
Subsequent performances will
be tomorrow and Saturday night.
Tickets are available at Memo
rial Auditorium box office for $1
and $1.50.
