# LAUSCHE MAY VOTE WITH GOP
## Democrats Control Congress; Await Final Kentucky Returns 
### 
(Compiled from the United Press)
Democrats snatched control of Congress from Republican coattail
riders yesterday to salvage a partial victory from the Eisenhower
Presidential landslide.
With only one Senate race yet to be decided, the Democrats had
nailed down 49 seats and were counting on Senator Earl C. Clements

of Kentucky to make it 50.
Clements forged back ahead of
Republican Thruston B. Morton
late yesterday in a see-saw race
that still could go either way.
Should Morton spring an upset,
the Senate lineup would be 49
Democrats and 47 Republicans.
This would be the same majority
the Democrats now enjoy. But
the situation might be compli
cated by Governor Frank J.
Lausche of Ohio.
May Vote with GOP
Lausche, who won a Democrat
ic Senate seat, has indicated ho
might vote with the Republicans
to organize the Senate if Eisen
hower was reelected and needed
his support to give the GOP con
trol.
In that case, it would be a 48-48
tie which Vice-President Richard
M. Nixon could break in favor of
the Republicans.
The Democrats had the House.
With 218 seats needed for control,
they had clinched 229 seats and
were leading in four other races.
Republicans had elected 197
House members and were leading
in five unsettled contests.
Latest Presidential returns
showed Eisenhower holding 57.7
per cent of the popular vote to
Stevenson's 42.3 per cent. The
President had captured 33,219,392
votes; Stevenson, 24,388,535. Ei
senhower had 11 states with 157
electoral votes and Stevenson
seven states with 74 electoral
votes.
Former President Harry S.
Truman, admittedly surprised at
the size of President Eisenhow
er's majority in Tuesday's ballot
ing, said today that "good citizens
abide by the result."
Stevenson's defeat itself, said
Truman, must be analyzed by the
historians.
"After all," he said, "they still
are trying to analyze how I won
In 1948."

Late returns showed the Re
publicans and Democrats each
had won 14 of the 29 governor
ships at stake in Tuesday's elec
tion. In Rhode Island, Democrat
ic Governor Dennis .1. Roberts
held a narrow' lead of 190,227 to
190,037 for his Republican oppo
nent. With returns complete ex

Democrats snatched control of Congress from Republican coattail
riders yesterday to salvage a partial victory from the Eisenhower
Presidential landslide.
With only one Senate race yet to be decided, the Democrats had
nailed down 49 seats and were counting on Senator Earl C. Clements

of Kentucky to make it 50.
Clements forged back ahead of
Republican Thruston B. Morton
late yesterday in a see-saw race
that still could go either way.
Should Morton spring an upset,
the Senate lineup would be 49
Democrats and 47 Republicans.
This would be the same majority
the Democrats now enjoy. But
the situation might be compli
cated by Governor Frank J.
Lausche of Ohio.
May Vote with GOP
Lausche, who won a Democrat
ic Senate seat, has indicated ho
might vote with the Republicans
to organize the Senate if Eisen
hower was reelected and needed
his support to give the GOP con
trol.
In that case, it would be a 48-48
tie which Vice-President Richard
M. Nixon could break in favor of
the Republicans.
The Democrats had the House.
With 218 seats needed for control,
they had clinched 229 seats and
were leading in four other races.
Republicans had elected 197
House members and were leading
in five unsettled contests.
Latest Presidential returns
showed Eisenhower holding 57.7
per cent of the popular vote to
Stevenson's 42.3 per cent. The
President had captured 33,219,392
votes; Stevenson, 24,388,535. Ei
senhower had 11 states with 157
electoral votes and Stevenson
seven states with 74 electoral
votes.
Former President Harry S.
Truman, admittedly surprised at
the size of President Eisenhow
er's majority in Tuesday's ballot
ing, said today that "good citizens
abide by the result."
Stevenson's defeat itself, said
Truman, must be analyzed by the
historians.
"After all," he said, "they still
are trying to analyze how I won
In 1948."
Each Wins 11
Late returns showed the Re
publicans and Democrats each
had won 14 of the 29 governor
ships at stake in Tuesday's elec
tion. In Rhode Island, Democrat
ic Governor Dennis .1. Roberts
held a narrow' lead of 190,227 to
190,037 for his Republican oppo
nent. With returns complete ex
cept for absentee ballots, the out
come will not be known until ab
sentee votes are counted Nov. 20.
