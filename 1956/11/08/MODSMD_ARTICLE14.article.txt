LONDON, Nov. 7 (UP) A
shaky cease -fire ruled Egypt';;
Suez Canal /one today. But An
glo-French forces and Egyptian
exchanged shots in Port Said 1.5
hours after the cease-fire went
into effect, and new fighting could
explode at any moment.
A chief question mark war. the
attitude of Russia.
Egypt accepted the cease-fire,
hut demanded the immediate with
drawal of British and French
forces. British Prime Minister Sir

any such condition or to agree
that the joint forces would with
draw upon the arrival of a United
Nations police force.
Israel Holds On
Israel indicated it intended to
hold on to its Sinai Desert gains
and said it would not tolerate a
police force along its borders.
Both Britain and Egypt con
firmed that shooting continued in
Port Said. But Prime Minister
Eden said he did not want to make
too much of the incident.
In Moscow, Soviet Defense Min
ister Georgi Zhukov renewed the
Russian offer of armed forces to
the U.N. to aid in the "liquida
tion" of Anglo-French aggression
against Egypt.
Russians flocked to the Egyp
tian embassy in Moscow in re
sponse to a Soviet radio broad
cast of Egypt's appeal for volun
teers. The volunteers were said
to include a "number" of Soviet;
reserve officers.
Chinese Volunteer
Communist China's Peiping ra
dio reported that more than 250,
000 Chinese had similarly volun
teered to fight with Egypt against
Anglo-French and Israeli troops.
The United Nations rushed ne
gotiations with the Anglo-French
and Egyptian commands to ar
range for stationing an interna
tional police force between the op
posing armies as quickly as pos
sible to avert new bloodshed.
The Anglo-French command
i said there had been no organized
fighting in the canal zone since
the allied forces ceased fire ;rt
2 a.m. today.
City Under Control
Prime Minister Eden sa<d there
had been "some shooting" in cap
tured Port Said during the day.
but the city was solidly "under
control."
Eden said Anglo-French for ces
had taken up cease-fire "defense:r>
positions" after seizing control ot
land points in what he called a
"military feat" that "must be un
paralleled in history."
