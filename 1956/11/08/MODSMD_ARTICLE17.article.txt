# It's All Over

### 
Even for the tears and cheers â€”it's all over;
the campaign buttons can he tossed into I he
nearest wastebasket and a good dose of elbow
grease applied to the outdated bumper strips.
By what has shown to be one of the strongest
expressions of popular approval ever evinced
by this country, President Eisenhower was over
whelmingly swept into his second term, re
affirming the fact that the country not only
still "likes Ike,"'' but also has great faith in his
capacities for handling crises.
Although supporting Adlai Stevenson during
the campaign, we now pray along with the
President that the hatchet of partisan animosi

ties will he buried and that the two great parties
of this country can work together to achieve
peace from ibis crisis-weary world.
We caii be thankful that opposition in the
United States remains "loyal," as Stevenson put
il in his concession speech Tuesday night, and
that the basic principles to which both parties
subscribe will be sustained no matter which
party accedes to power. Let the mounting
deaths and heart-rending cries of anguish from
those in Hungary, who saw briefly but could not
touch the liberty which we enjoy, be a bitter
reminder of the freedom which we take so
casually and automatically in this country.
