'Help' . . . And No Answer
Editor, The Daily:
I have lived for three years in the United
States. I have admired and loved your country.
But the recent massacre in Hungary, this un
pardonable crime, this reeking murder that has
curdled the blood of every sentient human being
in the world—and the United States' callous
aloofness and indifference to the plight of thou
sands and perhaps millions of dying people—has
persuaded me suddenly and once and for all that
L am living in a land of hypocrites.
The United States has done nothing, absolute
ly nothing. It is responsible for the most gigan
tic crime of modern times.
To tolerate injustice—is not this to be respon
sible for it? To pledge oneself to the defense of
liberty, and then turn one's back when the germ
of liberty is ruthlessly slaughtered—is this not
hypocrisy?
Of all the powers in the world today, the Unit
ed States is no doubt the most powerful, and,
therefore, the most cowardly. It has betrayed
itself and everything it stands for.
Has the United States sent one soldier to
Hungary? Has it given the dying man one single
ray of hope? Do you know that Radio Budapest
went off the air, crying in its tortured, agonized
voice for "Help . . . help . . . help"?
You, sir, as an American, are responsible for
Ihis crime. You are the man who has caused the
death of Hungary.
What is all this discussion in the United Na
tions? Is it not an argument as to where to bury
the dead man, rather than how to save him? He
is dead, sir, dead.
The United States delegate to the United Na
tions, Henry Cabot Lodge, did not want to con
demn the Russians, he merely wanted to deplore
their action. But now we cannot even deplore
