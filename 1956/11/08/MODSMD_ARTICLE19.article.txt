the death of Hungaryâ€”all we can flo is cry and
bow our heads. It is too late for us to do any
thing else.
Every American must feel at this moment a
bitter, bitter shame.

Editor, The Daily:
The letter written by Dorothy Clark and Nel
lie Norris in Thursday's Daily brought out some
issues which need discussion and clarification.
The strength of any system "made by and for"
Ihe students lies in the possibility of questioning
it, evaluating it and effecting change in policies
to meet change in situation.
We wish to clarify some common misconcep
tions. In regard to the Social Regulations, the
penalty for a violation is prescribed by the frame
work of the regulations. This penalty is incurred
automatically under the demerit system, and in
hearing appeals, Women's Council accepts a stu
dent's story as true, granting or denying her
appeal as we judge the sufficiency of extenuat
ing circumstances. In Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code cases, a defendant's word, the
word of witnesses and concrete evidence are
weighed in reaching a decision of guilt or inno
cence.
All decisions are made in the form of recom
mendations to the Dean of Students. Records of
all cases (Honor Code, Fundamental Standard
and appeals) are kept in Council files, in an ef
fort to obtain consistency between current and
past judgments. To ensure this consistency,
there is always an overlap in Council member
ship (two members being elected in fall and
three in spring), and the members-elect sit in
on cases for more than half a quarter before
taking office.
