# HOLLYWOOD EPIC
## Sensitive Portrayals, Camera Art Make 'Giant' Top Film 
### Richard Lamb 
Once in every five or ten years, a motion picture comes along that
stands head and shoulders above even the finest efforts of Holly
wood. "Gone \vÂ»th the Wind" is a cinematic masterpiece, "Citizen
Kane" is another and now "Giant' must be added to the list.
To the eye, "Giant," now playing at the Paramount in San Fran-

Cisco, Is a sweeping panorama of-
Texas, a fluid blend of images I
that flow and ebb but never stop
moving leisurely forward. Each
hew scene, even the most inti
mate and confined, is breath-tak
ing in its power and beauty.
The camera has used color as
an artist would, to reveal the
emotions embedded deep within
the limitless brown plains, and
the contrasting green of the har
nessed East. Smoothly and pur
posefully an entire generation of
a people and their progress un
rolls on the screen.
Real People
The people are real; their
struggles are genuine. This is
largely due to the genius of di
rector George Stevens, who has
evoked sensitive performances
from such ordinarily nondescript
players as Rock Hudson and Eliz
abeth Taylor. James Dean's por
trayal of Jett Rink is equal to
any piece of acting he's ever
done, but he does not steal the
picture away from its rightful
owners, Hudson and Miss Taylor.
Jane Withers is superb as
Vashti, the plump, loud-mouthed
girl who had hoped to marry
Hudson before he returned from
Virginia with Miss Taylor as his
bride. There is an aura of mag
netism about Miss Withers when
ever she appears which, I sup
pose, is the mark of a true star.
Supporting Actors
Mercedes McCambridge is as
good as always in a brief but
well - delineated characterization
of Luz Benedict. Not to be over
looked are Chill Wills, excellent,
and Carroll Baker, a fascinating
beauty from Actors' Studio.
Truthfully, "Giant" is so good
that it's incredible. It's an epic
it's incredible. Complimenting
Stevens after she had seen a pri
vate showing of the movie, au
thor Edna Ferber said, "This is
the book I wish I had written."
