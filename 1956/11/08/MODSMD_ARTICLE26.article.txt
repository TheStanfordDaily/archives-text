# Kenton to Kick-off Big Game Week With Jazz Concert
## 
### 
Stan Kenton will add a pro
gressive beat to the Big Game
Week festivities when he brings
his entire 20-piece band to the
Farm for a concert on Nov. 21 in
Memorial Auditorium under the
sponsorship of the junior class.
The popular Capitol recording
star and many times winner of
the Metronome and Downbeat
polls for the "Band of the Year"
is currently appearing at the Ma
cumba in the city. He will be
here just after classes break up
for Thanksgiving recess with the
performance scheduled to begin
at 4:15 and continue until 6 p.m.
Concert Committee Chairman
Lanny Merrill advised all Stan
ford students to get their tickets
early because the concert is open
to all residents of the area and
space is 'definitely limited to the
1700 who can fit into Memorial
Auditorium.
Tickets will go on sale Monday
at Engineering Corner and at the
Memorial Auditorium box office.
The price for Stanford students
and staff is $2. All proceeds will
go to charity.
