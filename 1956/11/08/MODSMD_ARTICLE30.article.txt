# Stanford Gridders Hold Secret Workout Preparing for Oregon State Contest
## Expect 3000 from OSC For Game Billed as Rose Bowl Determiner 
### Bob Mierow 
Stanford's gridiron warriors
went through a secret workout
yesterday in preparation for their
battle with Oregon State this
weekend.
Coach Chuck Taylor stressed
offense in the workout and also
worked on a defense to stop the
explosive Beaver single wing at-"
tack.
Practice continued late into the
evening and the later part was
held under the lights. Taylor
termed the part of the session
devoted to defense as "highly
spirited."
Center Russ Steele sat out to
day's session with a bruised
shoulder suffered in Tuesday's
practice. However, he is expected
to be ready for action this Sat
urday.
Oregon State will bring a well
rounded offense into the Stanford
Stadium on Saturday. Joe Fran
cis, a hard-running and sharp
passing tailback, paced the Bea
vers to their 10-0 victory over
Stanford last year in Portland.
Two Sharp Tailbacks
This year Francis is being
spelled by Paul Lowe, a swift
sophomore from Los Angeles.
Lowe, a 177-pounder, starred for
the OSC Rooks last year after
making the All-City backfield in
Los Angeles.
Little Sam Wesley, 155 pounds
of greased dynamite, was slated
to return as the Beavers' wing
baok this year. However, he was
declared ineligible early in the
season because he had enrolled in
a tiny Midwestern college several
years^ago.
Another All-City back from Los
Angeles, sophomore Earnel Dur
den, replaced Wesley and has
turned in several creditable per
formances this year. Durden tal
lied three times last week against
Washington on runs of 45 and
four yards and a 16-yard pass
from Francis.
Tom Berry is the fullback that
keep's OSC's opponents honest.
Although much smaller, Berry
compares favorably with Bob
Davenport, UCLA's great single
wing line-smasher of a few years
back.
Tommy Prothro, the Beaver
coach, was hailed as a miracle
man last year when he guided his
outfit into second place in the
PCC. The previous year, the Or
ange had captured only one vic
tory all season.
Back-door Wins
Many of Oregon State's wins in
1955 were of the back-door vari
ety as was their triumph over the
Tribe. Prothro said early this
season that the Orange was field
ing a stronger team this year but
might not win as many games.
Only lowa and USC have stopped
his gridders so far this year.
Approximately 3000 students
are expected to arrive from Cor
vallis for the contest this week
end. The Beavers have not field
ed a Rose Bowl threat since 1946
when Don Samuels and Ken Car
penter, later a Cleveland Brown,
paced OSC.
The Beaver eleven will arrive
in Palo Alto tomorrow night by
plane and will stay at Rickey's
Studio Inn.

Tommy Prothro, the Beaver
coach, was hailed as a miracle
man last year when he guided his
outfit into second place in the
PCC. The previous year, the Or
ange had captured only one vic
tory all season.
Back-door Wins
Many of Oregon State's wins in
1955 were of the back-door vari
ety as was their triumph over the
Tribe. Prothro said early this
season that the Orange was field
ing a stronger team this year but
might not win as many games.
Only lowa and USC have stopped
his gridders so far this year.
Approximately 3000 students
are expected to arrive from Cor
vallis for the contest this week
end. The Beavers have not field
ed a Rose Bowl threat since 1946
when Don Samuels and Ken Car
penter, later a Cleveland Brown,
paced OSC.
The Beaver eleven will arrive
in Palo Alto tomorrow night by
plane and will stay at Rickey's
Studio Inn.

Stanford's gridiron warriors
went through a secret workout
yesterday in preparation for their
battle with Oregon State this
weekend.
Coach Chuck Taylor stressed
offense in the workout and also
worked on a defense to stop the
explosive Beaver single wing at-"
tack.
Practice continued late into the
evening and the later part was
held under the lights. Taylor
termed the part of the session
devoted to defense as "highly
spirited."
Center Russ Steele sat out to
day's session with a bruised
shoulder suffered in Tuesday's
practice. However, he is expected
to be ready for action this Sat
urday.
Oregon State will bring a well
rounded offense into the Stanford
Stadium on Saturday. Joe Fran
cis, a hard-running and sharp
passing tailback, paced the Bea
vers to their 10-0 victory over
Stanford last year in Portland.
Two Sharp Tailbacks
This year Francis is being
spelled by Paul Lowe, a swift
sophomore from Los Angeles.
Lowe, a 177-pounder, starred for
the OSC Rooks last year after
making the All-City backfield in
Los Angeles.
Little Sam Wesley, 155 pounds
of greased dynamite, was slated
to return as the Beavers' wing
baok this year. However, he was
declared ineligible early in the
season because he had enrolled in
a tiny Midwestern college several
years^ago.
Another All-City back from Los
Angeles, sophomore Earnel Dur
den, replaced Wesley and has
turned in several creditable per
formances this year. Durden tal
lied three times last week against
Washington on runs of 45 and
four yards and a 16-yard pass
from Francis.
Tom Berry is the fullback that
keep's OSC's opponents honest.
Although much smaller, Berry
compares favorably with Bob
Davenport, UCLA's great single
wing line-smasher of a few years
back.
