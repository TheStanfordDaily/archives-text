# Jordan Schedules Intrasquad Meet
## 
### 
Head track coach Payton Jor
dan has scheduled the team's sec
ond development meet for Nov.
14-15, with running events- to be
held the first day and field events
the second. .
The pole vault and sprints,
events which were on the "must"
list for improvement, appeared to
be well on the way toward ful
filling this goal. Although the
vaulting marks are not yet up to
par on a national scale, the bet
tering of individual marks was
encouraging to the coaching
staff.
