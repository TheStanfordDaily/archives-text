# New Football Plan Reviewed By Presidents
## 
### 
Plans for an elaborate new Pa
cific Coast Conference were pre-;
sented to the Presidents' Council
of the PCC for study in a secret
meeting held Monday in San
Francisco.
If adopted the new plan might (
eventually incl u d e dozens of i
members competing at varying,
football levels. The conference j
name would not change but the i
present nine-school membership
would lie greatly enlarged. The
net effect would enable the larger
schools to play more teams out- j
side the conference, teams that
would have stronger gate draw- j
ing power.
University of California's presi
dent Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul
is apparently one of the co-au-1
thors of the new plan which is
strongly supported by Chancellor
Clark Kerr of California and
Chancellor Raymond B. Allen of
UCLA. Dr. Sproul is chairman
of the Presidents' Council and
presented the plan at Monday's
meeting.
Later this month the Presi
dents' Council will again meet in
San Francisco and perhaps a vote
on the new plan will be taken. If
the proposal passed it would
probably be sent to the faculty
representatives of the PCC for
action at their winter meeting in
Beverly Hills on Dec. 9.
The new plan, if adopted, might
be composed of schools from 11
Western states although they
would not necessarily have simi
lar athletic aims. San Jose State
and College of the Pacific would
be potential new members.
A fixed set of rules would bind
all members. Each school would
be responsible for its own en
forcement of the fixed rules.
There would be no round robin
and no championship. The Tour
nament of Rose s Association
would choose a Western repre
sentative to play in the Rose
Bowl.
