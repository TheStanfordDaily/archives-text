## 
### Fred Cropper 
Rocli Conklin, 6-2, 20.")-pound
Stanford center, has done an out
standing job of filling the center
slot while Boh Long has been out.
He has played in every Stanford
game this season and has held up
the center of the line to Stan
ford's advantage.
Roch hails from Fullerton, Cal
ifornia, where he attended Fuller
ton High School. He played
tackle there his last two years,
making all-league his senior year.
In his first year at Stanford he
alternated between the positions
of tackle and center on the fresh
man team.
In his sophomore year Conklin
played with the Braves and
turned in a fine job, qualifying as
one of the best prospects from
the junior varsity.
This year Conklin has played
outstanding ball. In the Michi
gan State - Stanford game he
blocked an MSU punt that almost
led to a Stanford touchdown.
Commenting on last week's
UCLA game Conklin said, "Esker
Harris (guard) has the quickest
reaction of any player I have ever
seen; he really moved fast."
About Donn Carswell, Roch
said, "I think he is one of the
most underrated players on Stan
ford's team. He is a great ball

player and I have certainly
learned a lot from him."
Conklin had a comment on this
week's game with OSC: "OSC
has a good ball club, but I'm con
fident we'll win this one."
Roch, a junior history major,
is a member of Sigma Chi fra
ternity. He would like to go into
medical school after he gradu
ates. During the summer after
graduation, he and Gordy Young
are thinking about taking a trip
to Europe.
