# LITTLE BIG GAME SATURDAY
## Frosh to Tangle With Cal Cubs Here; Tussle Will Determine Championship 
### 
Stanford's freshman football
team closes its season Saturday
in the annual Little Big Game
against the California frosh at
11 a.m. in Stanford Stadium.
It will he a big game in more
ways than one as both teams
come into the game unbeaten.
The Cubs disposed of UCLA, 13-6,
in their opener and last week ex
ploded for two fourth - quarter
touchdowns to down Southern
California, 25-7. Stanford opened
with a 36-13 triumph over the
Trobabes but was held to a 13-13
tie last week by an inspired UC
LA outfit.
The running of big Wayne
Crow, brother of former USC
star Lindon Crow, has been the
chief offensive weapon of coach
Rod Franz's Cubs. Crow ran wild
in the victory over UCLA and
last week returned a Trobabe
punt 62 yards for the first Cal
touchdown before being sidelined
with a sprained ankle. He is ex

pected to be ready for action Sat
urday.
Franz, former all - time great
guard at California, has molded a
rugged forward wall, headed by
center Bob Chiappone of Berke
ley.
The Papooses will go into the
game without the services of star
tackle Ron Fernandes, who was
injured early in last week's UC
LA game. Fernandes suffered
torn knee ligaments when clipped
in a scramble for a fumble.
It was fumbles, more than Bru
babes, that hurt the Papoose at
tack last week. Four Card bob
bles, all costly, fell into the en
emy hands.
Quarterback Sid Garber, hit
ting on 10 of 12 passing attempts,
paced the Stanford offense. Half
back Mac Wylie and fullback Jim
Honeywell headed the ground at
tack and were the key men in
both Card scoring marches.
