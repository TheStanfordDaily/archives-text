### 
VIENNA, Nov. 7 (UP)—Soviet
tanks and bombers smashed at
the last major center of rebel re
sistance in Hungary today. Fires
raged in surrounded Budapest,
where the Russians were using
starvation as the final means of
forcing submission.
Rebel "radio Raeoczy" said the
insurgents were holding fast
against a series of Soviet on
slaughts in the industrial town of
Dunapentele, 50 miles south of the
capital, where the freedom fight
ers were making their last: stand.
The radio appealed to President
Eisenhower personally for food
and medical supplies in the battle
against overwhelming odds. It
was estimated that 200,000 Soviet
troops and 4600 tanks—ls divi
sions — are engaged in crushing
the Hungarian rebellion.
Fire raged in a number of areas
of Budapest. Food was short
throughout the city and in some
sections it was unobtainable. So
viet blockades prevented farmers
from bringing in food.
Fighting was reported in three
other areas outside Budapest de
spite Soviet ultimatums and a
public display of retribution that
included hanging rebels from
lampposts and firing on women
and children, aid stations and hos
pitals.
Red Cross dispatches said civil
ian casualties were "heavy."
Radio Raeoczy said the Soviets
attacked three times against Du
napentele today starting at 3 a.m.
(0 p.m. EST).
A surrender ultimatum was re
jected, the radio said.
