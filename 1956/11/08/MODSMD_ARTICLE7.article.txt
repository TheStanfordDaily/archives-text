### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 fUl'i
President Eisenhower today sent
Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion
of Israel an urgent appeal to pull
Israeli troops out of Egypt, in
compliance with a United Nations
resolution.
The President acted after sum
moning Democratic and Republi
can congressional leaders to a
White House conference Friday
on the Middle East and Hunga
rian crises.
Eisenhower, who must work
with a Democratic Congress for
the next two years at least, called
the conference in an evident move
to force a bipartisan foreign pol
icy in the wake of his landslide
re-election.
The President's message to the
Israeli leader was announced by
the White House. The brief White
House statement said Eisenhower
urged Ben-Gurion "to act pursu
ant to the resolution of the Gen
eral Assembly of the United Na
tions with respect to the prompt
withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Egyptian territory."
