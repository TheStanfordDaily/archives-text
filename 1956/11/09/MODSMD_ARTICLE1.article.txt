## Move Jets into Syria; U.S. Will Only Aid UN Force as 'Last Resort' 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 8 (UP) Evi
dence of now Russian military
moves in I ho direction of the Suez
Canal and in eastern Europe
roused uneasiness tonight in Lon
don, Washington and Paris,
Washington military officials
said the Russians were moving
Soviet "advisors" and the latest
typo MIO jot fighters into Syria,
a military ally of Egypt in the
Middle East.
The Washington officials said
their information was independ
ent of a similar report made by
French Foreign Minister Chris
tian Pineau to the foreign affairs
committee of the national assem
bly. The French report said the
Russian planes were MIG 17's.
The reports took on added sig
nificance in the light of Russia's
announced determination to crush
aggression in the Middle East by
force and strenuous efforts by the
United Nations and Washington
to reach a settlement of the Sue/
Canal crisis before Russia could
move in.
Last Resort
The United States might be
willing, as a last resort, to con
tribute U.S. troops to a United
Nations police force to deter fu
ture aggressorsâ€”but only after
all other peace-making methods
failed.
The willingness of the United
States to assume command of
any U.N. police force in a future
aggression would depend upon
the location of the trouble area.
The United States ordered its
military commanders to move im
mediately to tighten up Ameri
can "defense readiness" through
out the world.
Israel announced to the United
Nations tonight that it had agreed
to withdraw its forces from Egypt
and cooperate with a U.N. force
which will police the area.
The Israeli move was a quick
about-face. Earlier today Israeli
engineers had begun building per
manent fortifications along a line
10 miles east of the Suez Canal,
and an Israeli Foreign Ministry
spokesman labeled as "unwise
and unrealistic" President Eisen
hower's urgent appeal to Israel
to withdraw.
Police Force
In Cairo, Maj. Gen. E. L. M.
Burns, rushing plans for the in
ternational police force he will
head, said Egypt has agreed to
the immediate stationing of U.N.
cease-fire observers on Egyptian
soil. He said the first group of
10 observers had already been
dispatched to Egypt.
In London, diplomatic sources
said Russia is building up forces
along the Iranian border, a gate
way If) the Middle East. They re
ported that bombers have been
reported flying south at high al
titude under cover of darkness.
