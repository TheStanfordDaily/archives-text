Some 40 students gathered last
night before the Main Library in
a minor mass demonstration in
behalf of I he Hungarian rebels.
The meeling was in preparation
for a large demonstration to be
held today in front of the San
Francisco City Hall.
Stanford students have been in
vited to join students from the
University of California, Univer
sity of San Francisco, San Fran
ctsoo State, San Francisco City
College and St. Mary's in the
demonstration of "passive resist
ance," according to Jerry Harri
son, head of the movement at
USF.
A group of Stanford students
will congregate in front of the
Law School at 11 a.m. to form a
car caravan up to San Francisco.
Four thousand students are ex
pected for the demonstration, an
other spokesman for the move
ment at USF said. Speakers at
the demonstration will be the edi
tor of the Free Hungary Press, a
former secretary to Joseph Car
dinal Mindzenty and a San Fran
cisco County supervisor.
The movement started sponta
neously at the three San Fran
cisco colleges, he said and a
number of students are wearing
small Hungarian flags in com
memoration of 'he rebels.
The purpose of the demonstra
tion, he said, is not to agitate vio
lently, but "to put in public view
the fact that we are not forget
ting the Hungarians."
