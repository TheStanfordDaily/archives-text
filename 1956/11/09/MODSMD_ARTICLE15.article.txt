four horrible quarters.
Stanford won five consecutive
contests from the Orange while

Sonny Sanchez, on:y gridder in
history to make the San Francisco
All-City team three times, lends
a hand at guard. Buz/. Randall,
203. and Joe Wade, 210, spell Cor
rick at center.
Sparking Oregon State's single
wing offense is triple-threat tail
back Joe Francis. The deceptive
junior from Honolulu has avoided
the injury jinx which kept him
out of action much of last year.
Francis is surrounded by ex
perienced and rugged backfield
mates. Tom Berry is a hard run
ner who broke up two ball games
last year with long runs. Berry
is a 180-pound senior from Los
Angeles.
Senior Gerry Laird, 195, lends
an experienced hand at blocking
back. The rugged signal caller
replaces Ted Searle, who was in
jured two weeks ago.
Sophomore Starter
Only sophomore in the starting
backfield lineup is Earnel Dur
den, a hard runner from Ihe
Southland. The chunky youngster
has overcome an ankle injury that
bothered him during spring drills.
Veteran Sterling Hammack, a
very swift junior from San Bruno,
spells Durden at wingback. Paul
Lowe, brilliant sophomore runner
at tailback, and hard-charging

soph Nub Beamer at full give the
Orange additional backfield tal
ent.
Russ Steele, sharing the Stan
ford center spot with Bob Long
and Roch Conklin, will be playing
tomorrow, although he still has a
strained shoulder. The shoulder
should not slow down the stal
wart Steele at all.
Itaftei*? Out
Halfback Mike Raftery, who
scored a sensational touchdown
against UCLA last week, will be
out for the OSC game, having
incurred a knee strain in the lan
gle with UCLA.
Long, who was out of play for
much of this season while recov
ering from mononucleosis, will
start tomorrow in the center slot
and should be able to play for
longer periods of time.
A victory in tomorrow's battle
will put the winner in front-run
ning position for the Rose Bowl.
Oregon State's only appearance in
the classic was in 1942, when it
was played in Durham, N.C., be
cause of wartime travel restric
tions.
Beaver Coach Tommy Prothro
was starting blocking back for
the Duke eleven which fell to
Oregon State, 20-IG, at Durham
that year.
Hoses are in the air.
When Oregon State's hard
charging Beavers and Stanford's
aerial-minded Indians take to the
Stanford Stadium turf tomorrow
afternoon, the right to represent
the Pacific Coast Conference in
the Rose Bowl will be at stake.
Card Coach Chuck Taylor is
confident his gridders will emerge
victorious in the fray, w h ic h
starts at 2 p.m.
In view of Stanford's secret
workout Wednesday, it is expect
ed that Taylor is planning a few
surprises for the Beavers. The
Big Red machine changed some
blocking assignments in iho clos
ed drill and made several changes
in the defensive line.
Individual Duel
Besides the team struggle, a
special individual duel will take
place on the field. Left tackle
John Witte of the Beavers and
right tackle Paul Wiggin of the
Cards are two of the best linemen
on the Coast this year.
Both Wiggin and Witte gained
All - American recognition last
year on major news service elev
ens. The Tribe ace, a veritable
tiger in pursuit, was chosen to
the Associated Press first team.
Witte was named to the first
eleven by International News
Service.
The Beavers could be bringing
the toughest tackle tandem in the
circuit into the stadium tomor
row. Witte's running mate .is jun
ior Dave Jesmer, a 225-pound lot -
terman. Jesmer is backed up by
Ted Bates, lanky sophomore from
Los Angeles.
Upset Last Year
Stanford will be seeking re
venge in tomorrow's contest. An
upset-minded Beaver eleven stun
ned the Indians last year in Pori
land, 10-0. The Tribe outran, out
passed and, unfortunately, out
fumbled the northerners through
four horrible quarters.
Stanford won five consecutive
contests from the Orange while
Kip Taylor headed them. Over
all, the Indians have captured 18
victories from State against five
setbacks and two ties.
Besides Witte and Jesmer, six
other first-stringers return from
last year's Oregon State outfit.
Norm Thiel is a two-year let
