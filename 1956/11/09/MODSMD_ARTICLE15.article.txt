Hoses are in the air.
When Oregon State's hard
charging Beavers and Stanford's
aerial-minded Indians take to the
Stanford Stadium turf tomorrow
afternoon, the right to represent
the Pacific Coast Conference in
the Rose Bowl will be at stake.
Card Coach Chuck Taylor is
confident his gridders will emerge
victorious in the fray, w h ic h
starts at 2 p.m.
In view of Stanford's secret
workout Wednesday, it is expect
ed that Taylor is planning a few
surprises for the Beavers. The
Big Red machine changed some
blocking assignments in iho clos
ed drill and made several changes
in the defensive line.
Individual Duel
Besides the team struggle, a
special individual duel will take
place on the field. Left tackle
John Witte of the Beavers and
right tackle Paul Wiggin of the
Cards are two of the best linemen
on the Coast this year.
Both Wiggin and Witte gained
All - American recognition last
year on major news service elev
ens. The Tribe ace, a veritable
tiger in pursuit, was chosen to
the Associated Press first team.
Witte was named to the first
eleven by International News
Service.
The Beavers could be bringing
the toughest tackle tandem in the
circuit into the stadium tomor
row. Witte's running mate .is jun
ior Dave Jesmer, a 225-pound lot -
terman. Jesmer is backed up by
Ted Bates, lanky sophomore from
Los Angeles.
Upset Last Year
Stanford will be seeking re
venge in tomorrow's contest. An
upset-minded Beaver eleven stun
ned the Indians last year in Pori
land, 10-0. The Tribe outran, out
passed and, unfortunately, out
fumbled the northerners through
four horrible quarters.
Stanford won five consecutive
contests from the Orange while
Kip Taylor headed them. Over
all, the Indians have captured 18
victories from State against five
setbacks and two ties.
Besides Witte and Jesmer, six
other first-stringers return from
last year's Oregon State outfit.
Norm Thiel is a two-year let
terman at left end. Bob DeCjrant,
an acrobatic pass receiver from
Burlingame, is back at right end.
Lettermen Returning
Home-town boy Vern Ellison of
Corvallis, another two-year letter
winner, has been beaten out at
right guard by sophomore Jim
Brackins. Little Dick Corrick, IT'i
pounds of ruggedness, is back for
his final year as starting center.
Filling out the Orange line is
senior John Sniffen, another two
year letterman.
Several rugged sophomore;
from last year's unbeaten frosh
team spell the Beaver regulars in
the line. Bates and Phil Naylor,
