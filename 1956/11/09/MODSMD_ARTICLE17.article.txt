# Today He Is Dead

A w l i K am> he was alive, an ordinary student
in an ordinals Hungarian university.
Todav he is dead dead because he saw arise
a flicker of hope that his country might again
be free; and he held that faint hope of free
dom so dear that he oflered his life in a" vain
sacrifice for it.
li s a pity, yve say, a darn rotten shame. And
then I he inevitable question: What can yve as
< ili/.ens of the strongest democracy, the shining
< ample of freedom for all, do to help these
\ it iou-lv oppressed but nobly brave people?
11 will stand as one of the I ragedics of history
tli.it vve are incapacitated bv the threat of
engendering a third world war; that we are
caught between Iwo moral obligations: one,
Hkil yve are pledged to avert at any cost the
wholesale slaughter of human beings that
would result 112 rom another world war: and. tyvo.

cherished liberties to those people caught in
the web of totalitarian domination.
In a very true sense, this is the eentnrv of
fear fear of material things more powerful
than the concept of freedom. I anks, machine
guns and the H-hnmh can destroy human lib
erty, but fear can work more stealthily and in
a more deadly fashion lo obliterate even, the
desire to fight for freedom.
Hut the Hungarians did not fear; they
thought the cause for which the\ were willing
lo lay down their lives might bring success.
It brought only the crush of Russian tanks,
bullets, machine guns and deadl\ failure.
This is a time of frustration and national
humiliation, for this country has openly 'en
couraged the satellite states lo rebellion, and,
now that thev have lebelled, we stand open
mouthed, empty-handed and ullerlv powerless.
