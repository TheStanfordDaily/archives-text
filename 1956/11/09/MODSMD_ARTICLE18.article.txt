Partisan Editorial Policy
Editor, The Daily:
Titc election-day editorial, "The Man for the
()ffire," of The Daily was indeed an interesting
piece of writing which, disregarding its political
bias, presents a problem to the student body of
this University. This -.a blem is related to the
general editorial policy u ihere is one of the
''official publication of the Associated Students
ol Stanford University" (Par. A, Sec. I, Art. TIT.
Publications Board Standing Rules of ASSU By
laws).
in Tuesday's editorial some unknown persons
ij < ngly endorse Stevenson over Eisenhower
in fact "strongly urge his election as Presi
d( nt." I have always believed Ihat an editorial
represents the editor's view and that of the paper
fie ishe, in this case) is in charge of. It would
bo interesting to know just who are the "we"
hi this editorial which, incidentally, reminds me
ol ;t well written "paid political announcement."
Helen Dewar can't be the author of the article
in spite of all reasonable assumption unless she
n '• the "regal" or "editorial" plural on purpose.
it could be rather more logical for an outsider
lo ;c sume that the editorial represents at least
an indirect opinion of the ASSU. The reason for
ibis likely assumption is obvious since The Daily
is not only the "official publication of the ASSU,
11111 also "owned and published" by the student
body.
Anyone who doubts the student body's finan
ced interest in The Daily should consider the 75
< ents quarterly subsidy by each of us, which is
p;;id to The Daily out of the $5 student fee.
Mow, an "offical publication" of any organiza
-1 iri is not an independent paper in the fullest
ense of the word. It must necessarily represent
the (ipinon of its owner and publisher. If this
r- isoning is correct then we must assume that
the Stanford student body is fully associated
with the Democratic party.
I. for one, would question the validity of this
a uimption; in fact it is rather probable that the
Democratic party adherents of the student body
are in a minority on this campus. The problem,
however, is that the editorial policy of The Daily
has been consistently supporting Democratic
puty lines, and this support culminated in Tues
day's editorial.
The question in connection with this problem
i not only why ihe ASSU's publication adopts
an offical party line contrary to the political af
liliation of the majority of its members, but also
far more important why does a student publi
cation adopt a politcal party-line at all? It seems
to me that it would be more advisable to present
in lividual views of both parties as it has been
done before without committing the paper to
either cause.

Since the elections are over T may propose
without prejudice that the Legislature should
finally decide whether The Daily is an official
publication of the Associate ! Students or that
of the Democratic party.
Tom Thiringer
Editor's Note: The Daily makes no pretext
ol voicing the editorial expression of tlie Asso
ciated Students, but necessarily observes one
of the fundamental precepts of a university
newspaper which is to maintain a position in
dependent of outside control.
It would be impossible, impractical, wrong
and an abnegation of responsibility for a news
paper purposefully to attempt to reflect the
opinions of ils readers, when one of the pri
mary purposes of a college paper is to stimu
late free thought —politically and otherwise.
Although published by the Associated Stu
dents, the paper is also read by these students
and would be nothing more than a farce-in
print should it accept conformity rather than
independence as the guide to its editorial pol
icy. The students pay to read The Daily, not
to control it.
We feel that politics falls into no exclusive,
untouchable category and that there is no valid
reason why we should shy from expressing
our views on this subject as well as other
issues of a non-partisan nature. We should
hate to see the day when political discussion
on this campus becomes silenced.
Recognizing the right and responsibility of
any newspaper to be independent, both the
ASSU Legislature and University administra
tion have not attempted to dictate this paper's
policies.
In the words of President Wallace Sterling,
as they appeared in lOditor and Publisher,
April i I, 195f», "The great principle of freedom
ot the press should apply jnsi as strongly on
campus as elsewhere."

Editor, The Daily:
The American voters have given President
Eisenhower a vote of confidence which stresses
the amazing power of the President to fulfill the
emotional needs of his constituents.
It is to be hoped that incompetence and lack
of foresight in American foreign policy of such
common occurrence during the past four years
will be corrected during the next four years.
For it is doubtful, considering the impact of
the President's personality, that he will be identi
fied with any mistakes which may occur in Ihe
future.

to me that it would be more advisable to present

Editor's Note: The Daily makes no pretext
ol voicing the editorial expression of tlie Asso
ciated Students, but necessarily observes one
of the fundamental precepts of a university
newspaper which is to maintain a position in
dependent of outside control.
It would be impossible, impractical, wrong
and an abnegation of responsibility for a news
paper purposefully to attempt to reflect the
opinions of ils readers, when one of the pri
mary purposes of a college paper is to stimu
late free thought —politically and otherwise.
Although published by the Associated Stu
dents, the paper is also read by these students
and would be nothing more than a farce-in
print should it accept conformity rather than
independence as the guide to its editorial pol
icy. The students pay to read The Daily, not
to control it.
We feel that politics falls into no exclusive,
untouchable category and that there is no valid
reason why we should shy from expressing
our views on this subject as well as other
issues of a non-partisan nature. We should
hate to see the day when political discussion
on this campus becomes silenced.
Recognizing the right and responsibility of
any newspaper to be independent, both the
ASSU Legislature and University administra
tion have not attempted to dictate this paper's
policies.

The American voters have given President
Eisenhower a vote of confidence which stresses
the amazing power of the President to fulfill the
emotional needs of his constituents.
It is to be hoped that incompetence and lack
of foresight in American foreign policy of such
common occurrence during the past four years
will be corrected during the next four years.
For it is doubtful, considering the impact of
the President's personality, that he will be identi
fied with any mistakes which may occur in Ihe

Editor, The Daily:
Titc election-day editorial, "The Man for the
()ffire," of The Daily was indeed an interesting
piece of writing which, disregarding its political
bias, presents a problem to the student body of
this University. This -.a blem is related to the
general editorial policy u ihere is one of the
''official publication of the Associated Students
ol Stanford University" (Par. A, Sec. I, Art. TIT.
Publications Board Standing Rules of ASSU By
laws).
in Tuesday's editorial some unknown persons
ij < ngly endorse Stevenson over Eisenhower
in fact "strongly urge his election as Presi
d( nt." I have always believed Ihat an editorial
represents the editor's view and that of the paper
fie ishe, in this case) is in charge of. It would
bo interesting to know just who are the "we"
hi this editorial which, incidentally, reminds me
ol ;t well written "paid political announcement."
Helen Dewar can't be the author of the article
in spite of all reasonable assumption unless she
n '• the "regal" or "editorial" plural on purpose.
it could be rather more logical for an outsider
lo ;c sume that the editorial represents at least
an indirect opinion of the ASSU. The reason for
ibis likely assumption is obvious since The Daily
is not only the "official publication of the ASSU,
11111 also "owned and published" by the student
body.
Anyone who doubts the student body's finan
ced interest in The Daily should consider the 75
< ents quarterly subsidy by each of us, which is
p;;id to The Daily out of the $5 student fee.
Mow, an "offical publication" of any organiza
-1 iri is not an independent paper in the fullest
ense of the word. It must necessarily represent
the (ipinon of its owner and publisher. If this
r- isoning is correct then we must assume that
the Stanford student body is fully associated
with the Democratic party.
I. for one, would question the validity of this
a uimption; in fact it is rather probable that the
Democratic party adherents of the student body
are in a minority on this campus. The problem,
however, is that the editorial policy of The Daily
has been consistently supporting Democratic
puty lines, and this support culminated in Tues
day's editorial.

()ffire," of The Daily was indeed an interesting
piece of writing which, disregarding its political
bias, presents a problem to the student body of
this University. This -.a blem is related to the
general editorial policy u ihere is one of the
''official publication of the Associated Students
ol Stanford University" (Par. A, Sec. I, Art. TIT.
Publications Board Standing Rules of ASSU By
laws).
in Tuesday's editorial some unknown persons
ij < ngly endorse Stevenson over Eisenhower
in fact "strongly urge his election as Presi
d( nt." I have always believed Ihat an editorial
represents the editor's view and that of the paper
fie ishe, in this case) is in charge of. It would
bo interesting to know just who are the "we"
hi this editorial which, incidentally, reminds me
ol ;t well written "paid political announcement."
Helen Dewar can't be the author of the article
in spite of all reasonable assumption unless she
n '• the "regal" or "editorial" plural on purpose.
it could be rather more logical for an outsider
lo ;c sume that the editorial represents at least
an indirect opinion of the ASSU. The reason for
ibis likely assumption is obvious since The Daily
is not only the "official publication of the ASSU,
11111 also "owned and published" by the student
body.
Anyone who doubts the student body's finan
ced interest in The Daily should consider the 75
< ents quarterly subsidy by each of us, which is
p;;id to The Daily out of the $5 student fee.
Mow, an "offical publication" of any organiza
-1 iri is not an independent paper in the fullest
ense of the word. It must necessarily represent
the (ipinon of its owner and publisher. If this
r- isoning is correct then we must assume that
the Stanford student body is fully associated
with the Democratic party.
I. for one, would question the validity of this
a uimption; in fact it is rather probable that the
Democratic party adherents of the student body
are in a minority on this campus. The problem,
however, is that the editorial policy of The Daily
has been consistently supporting Democratic
puty lines, and this support culminated in Tues
day's editorial.
The question in connection with this problem
i not only why ihe ASSU's publication adopts
an offical party line contrary to the political af
liliation of the majority of its members, but also
far more important why does a student publi
cation adopt a politcal party-line at all? It seems
to me that it would be more advisable to present
in lividual views of both parties as it has been
done before without committing the paper to
either cause.

Since the elections are over T may propose
without prejudice that the Legislature should
finally decide whether The Daily is an official
publication of the Associate ! Students or that
of the Democratic party.
Tom Thiringer
Editor's Note: The Daily makes no pretext
ol voicing the editorial expression of tlie Asso
ciated Students, but necessarily observes one
of the fundamental precepts of a university
newspaper which is to maintain a position in
dependent of outside control.
It would be impossible, impractical, wrong
and an abnegation of responsibility for a news
paper purposefully to attempt to reflect the
opinions of ils readers, when one of the pri
mary purposes of a college paper is to stimu
late free thought —politically and otherwise.
Although published by the Associated Stu
dents, the paper is also read by these students
and would be nothing more than a farce-in
print should it accept conformity rather than
independence as the guide to its editorial pol
icy. The students pay to read The Daily, not
to control it.
We feel that politics falls into no exclusive,
untouchable category and that there is no valid
reason why we should shy from expressing
our views on this subject as well as other
issues of a non-partisan nature. We should
hate to see the day when political discussion
on this campus becomes silenced.
Recognizing the right and responsibility of
any newspaper to be independent, both the
ASSU Legislature and University administra
tion have not attempted to dictate this paper's
policies.
In the words of President Wallace Sterling,
as they appeared in lOditor and Publisher,
April i I, 195f», "The great principle of freedom
ot the press should apply jnsi as strongly on
campus as elsewhere."
Foreign Policy IncompHcncc
Editor, The Daily:
The American voters have given President
Eisenhower a vote of confidence which stresses
the amazing power of the President to fulfill the
emotional needs of his constituents.
It is to be hoped that incompetence and lack
of foresight in American foreign policy of such
common occurrence during the past four years
will be corrected during the next four years.
For it is doubtful, considering the impact of
the President's personality, that he will be identi
fied with any mistakes which may occur in Ihe
future.
