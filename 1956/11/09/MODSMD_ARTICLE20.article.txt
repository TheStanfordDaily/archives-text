PARIS Nearly 1000 students staged a two
hour demonstration in front if the Russian em
bassy here this week, chanting "Russian rmir
dercrs" and "Freedom for the Hungarians."
A police squad of more than 100 formed a
solid barricade blocking off a narrow street that
leads to the embassy when the students, in sym
pathy for revolt-torn Hungary, took up the cry,
"The police are with us."
Tht police commissioner finally dispersed the
students, but not before the walls ol the street
were ringing to the "Marseillaise." The group
then trouped to the Place de la Sorbonne where
they continued the chants. Along the way on
lookers cheered and called others lo join tTiem.
Newsdealers gave papers to the students, who
tore them into shreds or wadded them up and
used them as torches. Faded Hungarian and
French flags were produced by someone in the
crowd. The Hungarian flag was draped with
black lace.
Reactions of the people along the way were
mixed. Many were amused or merely annoyed.
But at several points, especially on the narrow

streets, students received support from onlook
e. who leaned out of windows and cheered.
Several leaders of the group said the demon
stration was "non-political" except in so far as
it was "anti-Communist." The leaders also said
thi demonstration was motivated from purely
humanitarian causes, out of sympathy for the
Hungarians.
Circulars were passed around at the demon
stration to announce another mass m'eeting at
night. One leader predicted the night meeting
would be even larger and more dramatic. He
aid the demonstrations would continue through
the week.
During the parade, police stayed in contact
with the crowd to the end. At one point they
tried to prevent students from entering the Bou
levard Saint Michel. The students had just over
whelmed them when a large police officer cor
nered Ihe student carrying the Hungarian flag.
The police, trying to keep the busy thorough
fare from being blocked, compromised by allow
ing part of the group to pass. But when the
delegation rer.ched the end of fly? block, the rest
of the students joined Ihem by skirting around
the police.
Demonstrators were violently angry and
some nearly precipitated a fist-fight with the
police. Most were in lighter spirits, however, and
ensiled something of the atmosphere that pre
vails at a football rally.
