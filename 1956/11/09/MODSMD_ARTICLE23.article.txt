# Braves Tangle With Unbeaten Ord Warriors
## 
### 
Undefeated Fort Ord will fur
j nish the opposition for Stanford's
j Braves in tomorrow's three-game
football bill of fare on the Stan
j ford grounds.
Beginning at 10:30 on the rUgby
field, Coach Mai El ward's Braves
will attempt to end the six-game
winning streak of the talent-laden
1955 national service champions.
Cal's All-American quarterback,
Paul Larson, is the Ord play
caller. Last week he pitched two
third-quarter touchdown passes to
lead the Warriors over Hamilton
Field.
The Ord running game is not
without its name players. WSC's
Duke Washington, UCLA's Sam
Brown and Florida's Mai Ham
mack each received sectional or
national acclaim while in college.
Hammack has been the War
riors' leading ground gainer.
Brown two weeks ago led the
service eleven to a decisive 34-7
victory over the Cal Ramblers.
The Warriors operate from the
"I" formation, which is the
straight-T with the left halfback
between the quarterback and the
fullback.
After dropping a 34-33 decision
to Hamilton Field and tying the
Ramblers, 13-13, during the early
weeks of the season, the Braves
have scored 127 points to oppo
nents' 14 in their last three out
ings, all victories.
Much credit for the Braves' 4-1-1
record to date can be laid on the
wrist of sophomore quarterback
Bob Nicolet. He has completed
over 60 per cent of all attempts
this season.
But it was the running of Roy
Stephen which won last Friday's
victory over San Diego Navy. On
the local scene, Jim Sinnerud and
Dick Mires have been consistent
gainers for the Indian JV's. 1
Fort Ord won last year's mythi
cal service championship by beat
ing Pensacola Navy, 32-19, in the
Poinsettia Bowl.
2007 MUSICIANS
A total of 2007 musicians from
32 high schools will take part in
Saturday's half - time festivities.
The occasion is a local High
School Band Day.

without its name players. WSC's
Duke Washington, UCLA's Sam
Brown and Florida's Mai Ham
mack each received sectional or
national acclaim while in college.
Hammack has been the War
riors' leading ground gainer.
Brown two weeks ago led the
service eleven to a decisive 34-7
victory over the Cal Ramblers.
The Warriors operate from the
"I" formation, which is the
straight-T with the left halfback
between the quarterback and the
fullback.
After dropping a 34-33 decision
to Hamilton Field and tying the
Ramblers, 13-13, during the early
weeks of the season, the Braves
have scored 127 points to oppo
nents' 14 in their last three out
ings, all victories.
Much credit for the Braves' 4-1-1
record to date can be laid on the
wrist of sophomore quarterback
Bob Nicolet. He has completed
over 60 per cent of all attempts
this season.
But it was the running of Roy
Stephen which won last Friday's
victory over San Diego Navy. On
the local scene, Jim Sinnerud and
Dick Mires have been consistent
gainers for the Indian JV's. 1
Fort Ord won last year's mythi
cal service championship by beat
ing Pensacola Navy, 32-19, in the
Poinsettia Bowl.
