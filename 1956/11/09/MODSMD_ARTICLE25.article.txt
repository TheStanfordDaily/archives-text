# Stanford, California Frosh Sport Unmarred Seasons
## 
### Bob Payne 
Unbeaten seasons will be the
aim of both the Stanford Pa
pooses and the California Cubs
tomorrow as the two freshman
squads tangle in the annual Little
Big Game. Kickoff time is 11
a.m., the preliminary to the Card-
Oregon State game.
Coach Rod Franz has fielded
one of Cal's best frosh teams in
years. The Cubs have been vic
torious in both of their outings
this season, downing UCLA, 13-6,
and Southern California, 25-7. The
Papooses walloped USC in their
opener, 36-13, and were tied by
the Uclans last week, 13-13.
Stanford, too, can claim this
year's yearling squad one of the
best Farm frosh teams in recent
years. Coach Bob Ghilotti's Pa
pooses present a torrid running
attack which has rolled for 508
yards in two games, and a strong
passing attack which has account
ed for 333 yards.
Garber Passing
Captain-elect and quarterback
Sid Garber gave Card followers
something to talk about last week
when he completed 10 of 12 passes
for 108 yards and one touchdown.
The Caldwell, Ida., ace passed
to big John Luke on the tackle
eligible play for the first Papoose
counter against the Uclans, scored
two touchdowns and passed for
another in the SC game.
Standing out as receivers for
Garber have been ends Jerry Win
ters and Chris Burford, wingback
Dick Bowers and fullback Jim
Honeywell. Winters at 215 pounds
is the team's fastest man.
Honeywell and halfback Mac
Wylie have paced the potent
ground attack. Honeywell has
picked up 209 yards in two games
while Wylie has rolled for 146,
87 of them last week. The pair
has proven even more valuable as
"bread and butter" runners in
touchdown marches.
Running Threat
Forming a strong second-unit
running threat are fullback Pete
Fitzgerald, who has picked up 92
yards in 12 carries, and halfback
Vic Vagliente.
The Papoose line was given a
jolt last week when star tackle
Ron Fernandes suffered a serious
knee injury. Dean Hinshaw, how
ever, was outstanding as a fill-in

for Fernandas against UCLA and
will be starting at right tackle
tomorrow.
Guards Ray Harrington and
Neil Laughlin and center Bill Sti
vers anchor the middle of the
tough forward wall. All .three
were high in the list of tacklers
last week.
Cal Hopes
California's hopes for victory
are hinged on the performance
of an outstanding line. Top all
around performer among the for
wards is center Bob Chiappone,
a 215-pound standout from Berke
ley. He gets able assistance from
tackles Bill Streshly and Jim
Green and guards Frank Sally
and Bill Archer.'
A ground game spearheaded by
fullback Wayne Crow has carried
the Cubs to both of their victo
ries. Crow suffered a sprained
ankle early in last week's game,
but not before rambling G2 yards
for one Cal touchdown. He is re
ported healthy and ready to go
this week.
Backing Crow are two more
top-flight rushers, A1 Dasso and
Jack Yerman. Yerman scored on
runs of 14 and 77 yards against
the Trobabes.
Gerald Erickson is slated to get
the starting call at quarterback
over little 145-pound Arty Keough.
Halfbacks are well fortified with
Bill Patton and Pete Demoto.
Favored
Cal, on the basis of compara
tive scores, has been installed as
a slight favorite to take its second
straight Little Big Game. Last
season the Cubs dumped the Pa
pooses, 33-14, in gaining a meas
ure of revenge for the record
breaking 60 : 0 shellacking they
took in 1954.
We take the Papooses.

Favored
Cal, on the basis of compara
tive scores, has been installed as
a slight favorite to take its second
straight Little Big Game. Last
season the Cubs dumped the Pa
pooses, 33-14, in gaining a meas
ure of revenge for the record
breaking 60 : 0 shellacking they
took in 1954.
We take the Papooses.
Unbeaten seasons will be the
aim of both the Stanford Pa
pooses and the California Cubs
tomorrow as the two freshman
squads tangle in the annual Little
Big Game. Kickoff time is 11
a.m., the preliminary to the Card-
Oregon State game.
Coach Rod Franz has fielded
one of Cal's best frosh teams in
years. The Cubs have been vic
torious in both of their outings
this season, downing UCLA, 13-6,
and Southern California, 25-7. The
Papooses walloped USC in their
opener, 36-13, and were tied by
the Uclans last week, 13-13.
Stanford, too, can claim this
year's yearling squad one of the
best Farm frosh teams in recent
years. Coach Bob Ghilotti's Pa
pooses present a torrid running
attack which has rolled for 508
yards in two games, and a strong
passing attack which has account
ed for 333 yards.
Garber Passing
Captain-elect and quarterback
Sid Garber gave Card followers
something to talk about last week
when he completed 10 of 12 passes
for 108 yards and one touchdown.
The Caldwell, Ida., ace passed
to big John Luke on the tackle
eligible play for the first Papoose
counter against the Uclans, scored
two touchdowns and passed for
another in the SC game.
Standing out as receivers for
Garber have been ends Jerry Win
ters and Chris Burford, wingback
Dick Bowers and fullback Jim
Honeywell. Winters at 215 pounds
is the team's fastest man.
Honeywell and halfback Mac
Wylie have paced the potent
ground attack. Honeywell has
picked up 209 yards in two games
while Wylie has rolled for 146,
87 of them last week. The pair
has proven even more valuable as
"bread and butter" runners in
touchdown marches.
Running Threat
Forming a strong second-unit
running threat are fullback Pete
Fitzgerald, who has picked up 92
yards in 12 carries, and halfback
Vic Vagliente.
The Papoose line was given a
jolt last week when star tackle
Ron Fernandes suffered a serious
knee injury. Dean Hinshaw, how
ever, was outstanding as a fill-in

for Fernandas against UCLA and
will be starting at right tackle
tomorrow.
Guards Ray Harrington and
Neil Laughlin and center Bill Sti
vers anchor the middle of the
tough forward wall. All .three
were high in the list of tacklers
last week.
Cal Hopes
California's hopes for victory
are hinged on the performance
of an outstanding line. Top all
around performer among the for
wards is center Bob Chiappone,
a 215-pound standout from Berke
ley. He gets able assistance from
tackles Bill Streshly and Jim
Green and guards Frank Sally
and Bill Archer.'
A ground game spearheaded by
fullback Wayne Crow has carried
the Cubs to both of their victo
ries. Crow suffered a sprained
ankle early in last week's game,
but not before rambling G2 yards
for one Cal touchdown. He is re
ported healthy and ready to go
this week.
Backing Crow are two more
top-flight rushers, A1 Dasso and
Jack Yerman. Yerman scored on
runs of 14 and 77 yards against
the Trobabes.
Gerald Erickson is slated to get
the starting call at quarterback
over little 145-pound Arty Keough.
Halfbacks are well fortified with
Bill Patton and Pete Demoto.
