In nearly half of the last 14 games between Stanford and Oregon
State, the Injuns have been held scoreless by the Beavers!
This startling fact sets- the stage for tomorrow's battle with
Tommy Prothro's contenders putting their Rose Bowl hopes on the
line against Big Red. Onlookers expect a high-scoring offensive
game, but Prothro would like nothing better than to bottle up the
Stanford offense as OSC has done in six games since 1937.
In that year and again in 1946. the two squads battled to score
less ties. Beavers'whitewashed the Tribe in 1938, '39, '41 and last
year. Another OSC win over Stanford was 13-7 in 1947.
So it appears from the record book that the Beavers have held
Stanford scoreless more times in the past quarter-century than
has any other single team, including Cal and SC.
Of course all this sounds very ominous until you look at the other
seven contests during the same period in which the Indians over
powered the Northerners by 217 points to 76.
Last season's 10-0 upset by the Beavers has been called the most
incredible game from the standpoint of officiating the Indians have
played in modern times. A look at the stats shows Stanford out
played OSC in every department: 23-7 in first downs, 363-150 in
net yards rushing and passing. But Ihe penalties were tremendous
and therein was the tale of that night-time contest at dreary Mult
nomah Stadium.
A note of hope for Stanford rooters this year from lite record
book: the year after a 10-0 victory by OSC in 1941, Stanford re
bounded to win 49-13. Will history repeat itself?
• The importance of the point-after-touchdown can be seen from
last week's game, which was the first single-point loss in Stanford
history since Oregon slipped by, 21-20, in 1952. In modern times the
Cards have taken eight victories by one point and dropped six con
tests by the same margin.
This week on the practice field. Coach Chuck Taylor has been
giving emphasis to conversion booting to make sure tlie valuable
points will be made this Saturday.
On Wednesday, Taylor locked up the practice field doors for
an "under-wraps" drill which, he explained, was so "we could work
on a few things."
4 Asked reporters: "Like what?"
Answered Taylor: "Oil, offense and defense."
The coach always seems to have the capsule comment for the
inquiring reporter which sums everything up. Samples:
Nov. 15, 1954: "We can still make this a successful season by
winning the Big Game." Result: Stanford 20, California 28.
Sept. 30, 1955: "The hay is in the barn." Result: Stanford 6,
Ohio State 0.
Oct. 11, 1956: "This will be a tough one." Result: Stanford 40,
San Jose State 20.
POSTSCRIPT —After watching last week's IJC'LA game, the
immediate impression was that Stanford was quite lucky indeed
to be only one point back. The Bruins could easily (and deserv
edly) have had another touchdown or two on the scoreboard at
the end. For a while in the third period it looked like there might
be a comeback in the making, but it flickered.out after the PAT
was missed. The UCLA rooting section sported smiles and halos
but the Stanford side sported little at all during the afternoon
except expressions of astonishment. The blue-shirts were every
where as if by some magical formula concocted by R«*d Sanders.
His former assistant gets a chance tomorrow to brew up evil
sjjells for the Injuns. (But Stanford will have a few tricks of ils
own.)

points will be made this Saturday.
On Wednesday, Taylor locked up the practice field doors for
an "under-wraps" drill which, he explained, was so "we could work
on a few things."
4 Asked reporters: "Like what?"
Answered Taylor: "Oil, offense and defense."
The coach always seems to have the capsule comment for the
inquiring reporter which sums everything up. Samples:
Nov. 15, 1954: "We can still make this a successful season by
winning the Big Game." Result: Stanford 20, California 28.
Sept. 30, 1955: "The hay is in the barn." Result: Stanford 6,
Ohio State 0.
Oct. 11, 1956: "This will be a tough one." Result: Stanford 40,
San Jose State 20.
POSTSCRIPT —After watching last week's IJC'LA game, the
immediate impression was that Stanford was quite lucky indeed
to be only one point back. The Bruins could easily (and deserv
edly) have had another touchdown or two on the scoreboard at
the end. For a while in the third period it looked like there might
be a comeback in the making, but it flickered.out after the PAT
was missed. The UCLA rooting section sported smiles and halos
but the Stanford side sported little at all during the afternoon
except expressions of astonishment. The blue-shirts were every
where as if by some magical formula concocted by R«*d Sanders.
His former assistant gets a chance tomorrow to brew up evil
sjjells for the Injuns. (But Stanford will have a few tricks of ils
own.)
In nearly half of the last 14 games between Stanford and Oregon
State, the Injuns have been held scoreless by the Beavers!
This startling fact sets- the stage for tomorrow's battle with
Tommy Prothro's contenders putting their Rose Bowl hopes on the
line against Big Red. Onlookers expect a high-scoring offensive
game, but Prothro would like nothing better than to bottle up the
Stanford offense as OSC has done in six games since 1937.
In that year and again in 1946. the two squads battled to score
less ties. Beavers'whitewashed the Tribe in 1938, '39, '41 and last
year. Another OSC win over Stanford was 13-7 in 1947.
So it appears from the record book that the Beavers have held
Stanford scoreless more times in the past quarter-century than
has any other single team, including Cal and SC.
Of course all this sounds very ominous until you look at the other
seven contests during the same period in which the Indians over
powered the Northerners by 217 points to 76.
Last season's 10-0 upset by the Beavers has been called the most
incredible game from the standpoint of officiating the Indians have
played in modern times. A look at the stats shows Stanford out
played OSC in every department: 23-7 in first downs, 363-150 in
net yards rushing and passing. But Ihe penalties were tremendous
and therein was the tale of that night-time contest at dreary Mult
nomah Stadium.
A note of hope for Stanford rooters this year from lite record
book: the year after a 10-0 victory by OSC in 1941, Stanford re
bounded to win 49-13. Will history repeat itself?
• The importance of the point-after-touchdown can be seen from
last week's game, which was the first single-point loss in Stanford
history since Oregon slipped by, 21-20, in 1952. In modern times the
Cards have taken eight victories by one point and dropped six con
tests by the same margin.
This week on the practice field. Coach Chuck Taylor has been
giving emphasis to conversion booting to make sure tlie valuable
points will be made this Saturday.
