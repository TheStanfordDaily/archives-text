# SHARP STYLIZATION
## 'Thieves' Carnival' Is Brilliant Farce and Cockeyed Comedy 
### Terry Comito 
Jean Anouilh's "Thieves' Carnival" is one cockeyed comedy for
which sharp sight is of the essence: it's less a farce than a play about
farce; and the Stanford Players, despite a little squinting, see that
it is always uproarious, sometimes brilliant farce.
The false noses and beards, seductions, con jobs last-minute

rescues, that is -are precisely as
foolish, though not as funny, as
they seem to be. It's a put-up job
that the characters take hardly
more seriously than does the au
dience, and less happily.
"Here come my puppets," says
the elegant Lacly Hurf at one
point, and she means it. Because
she is 50, empty, alone and bored,
she deliberately constructs, for
her amusement, a "gigantic piece
of folly."
All this sets the comic intrigue
at a distance, views it for its own
sake: the slapstick gimmicks are
funny just because they're so ob
viously gimmicks. And, at best,
the Players hit just this note of
sharp stylization.
It's the shape of farce one gets,
almost abstractly: Lady Hurf en
ters in a sudden flurry of danc
ing passers-by, Dedier Dupont-
Dufort Jr. (Herbert Propper)
flounces off like a dandy of the
190's. William Allison's second
act set it's a rococo daydream
daydream — flowers in empty
space.
Under the laughs, however, is
the play's real heart loneliness
and young love or soft under
belly, if one is not careful to keep
the surface hard and shiny.
The Players, in I heir huge au
ditorium, have to spread out the
action: bigger, broader and bold
er. The comic scenes come
through this well enough, but the
serious breaks seem by contrast
more lax: not more real but slow
er, and Anouilh himself at these
points comes close to crossing
from genuine tenderness to rath
er weepy pathos.
101 lon Kay as Eva, though, and
even Margaret Stewart as Lady
Hurf who seems overly abstract
at times, and a little monotonous
bring an occasional catch of
real feeling, and there are laughs
enough to carry the rest.
David O'Hrion as the thieves'
ringleader stiffens grandiloquent
ly, collapses with a shrug it is,
after all, nonsense rebounds sar
castically with a huge vaudeville
take.
William O'Brien,as Hector, sec
ond of the gang, and professional
seducer, mugs like mad and deft
ly; William Davis plays the "hon
est" thief Gustave with a precise
ly stylized combination of charm
and downright slow-wittedness.
The Players' "Thieves' Carni
val," in short, if not quite in focus
all evening, exhibits enough of
Anouilh's play to be a memorable
event.
