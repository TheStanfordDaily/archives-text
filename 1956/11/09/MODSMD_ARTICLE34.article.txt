# Pendleton, San Jose, Cards in Three-Way Race
## 
### 
Camp Pendfeton and San Jose
State will furnish the Indian
crosscountry squad, with another
rugged test when the three teams
meet on the Stanford Golf Course
tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Pendleton has proved to be
California's strongest aggrega
tion, losing just once this season.
The lone defeat was administered
by Occidental last week at the
San Diego State Invitational, but
Pendleton had earlier beaten Oxv
on several occasions.
Stanford and San Jose will be
out to resolve which is the better
team, after their first meeting of
the season resulted in a 28-28 tie
a cross-country rarity.
Chief reason for the Marines'
success has been their excellent
team balance. While no one man
has dominated any of the Pendle
ton meets, the team as a whole
has placed well.
It has not yet been decided
whether each team will name
seven men for scoring purposes,
or whether the first seven from
each squad to finish will be
scored.
If the former is true, Coach
Payton Jordan has seven men

jjominated to score for Stanford.
Heading the list is Doug Mar
tin, top Stanford man in last
week's UCLA meet. Senior Ralph
Love and freshman Bobby Mon
zingo are the others in the top
trio.
Ernie C un 1 if 112 e and Maury
Graves are two veterans who also
will represent the Indians. Rodg
er Beck.Â»the most improved run
ner of the year, ran fifth last
week at UCLA.
Joining Beck and the others

will be Warren Wood. Wood was
the top Stanford man in last
week's junior varsity race, and
replaces Don Richardson on the
top seven.
Richardson and seven or eight
other men from the JV team are
also expected to run, whether or
not they can count for scoring
purposes.
As has been the case all season,
the top seven men in tomorrow's
race will gain the right to run in
the team's next race.
