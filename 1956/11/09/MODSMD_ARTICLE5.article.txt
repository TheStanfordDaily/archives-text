# Visitor Finds Friendliness From Russians
## 
### 
The amount of freedom of
speech and friendliness in Russia
surprised San Francisco State
Professor Alfred G. Fisk during
a 26-day stay in the U.S.S.R. this
summer.
Approximately 90 persons in
Bowman Alumni House yester
day afternoon heard humorist
philosopher Fisk declare, "After
10 years of vitriolic anti-Ameri
can propaganda, the amount of
friendliness surprised me."
"There was not one incident of
hostility or discourtesy to us be
cause we were Americans," Fisk
related.
He pointedly asked the group
if Americans Would be that cour
teous to a group of 21 Russians
touring this country.
"To Kiss Us"
"When we left church in Rus
sia," Fisk recalled, "they all
wanted to come up and kiss us.
. . . They have the custom of
kissing on both cheeks hut there
can be too much of a good thing."
The 21 -member group spoke be
fore audiences in Baptist
churches and mentioned America
is "devoted to peace." "When we
said that," the professor related,
"they almost audibly cried."
To set a background for the
"friendliness" he and his 20 com
panions found, Fisk described
anti - American propaganda in
Russia.
"When the potato crop failed,"
! the Ph.D. graduate of Occidental
| College said, "we (America) were
blamed for it. When the trams
â–  wouldn't run because of elec
tricity, loudspeakers said, 'Due to
the United States.'"
.Serious Subjects
Fisk said he was also surprised
by the apparent freedom with
which natives discussed "serious
subjects." Students, he reported,
I spoke of Stalin as "the old man"
but volunteered the comment
i that the secret police are no long
' er so strict as they once were.
From such talks, the author-
I traveler gleaned the information
i that "there is dissatisfaction in
Russia but no disaffection. This
was in contrast to the conditions
: we found in the satellites."
Fisk used the title of Martin
Higgins' book, "Red Plush and
Black Bread." to illustrate the
contrast between the lack of con
sumer goods in Russia and the
"plush" public artifacts.
"Their subway stations are like
i palaces," the speaker reminisced.
