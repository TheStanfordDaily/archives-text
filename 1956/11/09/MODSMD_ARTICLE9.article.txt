# GOLF WITH IKE
## Ike's Second Cousin Here At Stanford 
### 
The 1956 Presidential election
hold spccial interest for Stanford
senior Boh Lucas. The reason:
Lucas is second cousin to Presi
dent Eisenhower.
Ike's mother and Bob's father's
mother are sisters. Lucas, who is
a history major and member of
Kappa Sigma, told of some of his
meetings with his famous rela
tive.
The first time he met Ike was
in 1941 when Ike was a lieutenant
colonel at Fort Lewis. The next
meeting was in 1950 when Ike
was president of Columbia Uni
versity. In 1952 they met again
when Lucas was in Washington
state on the campaign train with
Ike. They met again in that same
year at the Inauguration.
Dinner with Ike
In the summer of 1953 he went
back to Washington, D.C., and
had dinner with Ike and Mamie
in the White House. They were
together again in 1953 for two
days when Ike attended the Gov
ernors' Conference in Seattle.
One of the President's five
brothers, Edgar, lives in Tacoma,
Wash. Since Lucas lives in Yak
ima, Edgar is the closest relative
to, the President that Bob knows
best.
Lucas once played golf with
Ike and Edgar. "We were about
even," Lucas says. "Dwight does
n't keep very close count of the
score. lie just plays for the en
joyment of it."
Ike's Brothers
Edgar Eisenhower is a promi
nent lawyer i;i Tacoma. All five
Eisenhower hr o th e r s worked
their way to success alter starling
at the bottom. Milton Eisenhow
er was president of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania and is now
president of the Johns Hopkins
Medical School. The other living
brother, Marie, is in the advertis
ing business in the Mid-West. An
other brother, Roy, died about 15
years ago.
Lucas's father hears from Ike
quite often, and he and M;imio
are both very friendly and so
ciable, according to Lucas. The
family was sure that he would
win the election. As far as the
President's administration goes,
Lucas thinks he has done as good
a job as anyone could.
