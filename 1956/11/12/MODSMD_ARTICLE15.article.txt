Il was students who sparked the revolts and
students were among those who were the last
to give up against the treacherous onslaught
of Bussian tanks, troops and bombers.
But theirs was a losing cause. Another pup
pet government has been set up and just
pockets of resistance remain.
Students in all free nations have displayed
their sympathy for their Hungarian brothers.
From Belgium to Vienna to South America
mass demonstrations have been staged. Some
limes the anger against the inhuman tactics of
the Soviet leaders has gotten out of hand, and
marches have been staged against Hussian em
bassies or consulates.
Hut these demonstrations have been mostly
a result of frustration, a feeling that something
should be done to aid the Free Hungarians in
their struggle to get out from under Russian
tyranny.
i\ow World University Service, an interna
tional student organization, has come up with

a plan of actual material aid. It has sent out
a plea to all universities for relief funds for
the thousands of Hungarian student refugees
who have escaped across the border into Aus
tria.
President Sterling received a telegram from
WUS over the week end asking for immediate
contributions. \\ hen he turned it over to the
student government, Legislature by a special
vote Saturday unanimously handed ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Bill Mathewson a blank check
to draw out of student funds whatever he
wished for the cause.
Today a check for $300 from Stanford for
Hungarian students is speeding its way toward
Austria.
The present aid may seem like locking the
barn door after the horse has been stolen;
aiding the refugees does not aid the Hungarian
fight for freedom. But it does show the sym
pathy and admiration of students the world
over for what has been done.
Legislature should he heartily commended
for acting immediately to do its small hut
important part.
