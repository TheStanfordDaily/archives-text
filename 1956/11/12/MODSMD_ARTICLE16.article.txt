More Altention lo Hungary
Editor, The Daily:
I have read the letter to you " 'Help' . . . And
No Answer" by Luis Harss in your Thursday
edition, and I found every line just too true, the
cartoon right above the article underlining the
frightful tragedy by trying to use the cruel and
bloody murder of tens of thousands of Hunga
rians as a subject for a joke—a terrible joke in
deed.
And I am wondering whether you think the
cartoon a very good substitute to the space
you did not devote on the front page to the last
desperate fight of a nation for freedom which is
being suffocated in streams of blood and tears
and tens of thousands of mothers and wives
standing not in front of graves but before lamp
posts with their cruelly massacred sons.and hus
bands on them.
You as the editor of the daily paper of one
of the top universities of the United States are
in possession of a strong instrument of influ
encing a great number of college students who
will once become leaders of your nation and I
believe that you have the great responsibility of
carefully evaluating the importance of the mat
ters you bring to their attention.
Bearing this in mind I believe you will find
it of greater importance to tell your readers of
one of the greatest crimes against mankind in
more than half a column despite the fact that
a "College Revue Goes into Rehearsal" and de
spite the fact that Hungary is "far away" and
that the desperate rebellion will soon be liqui
dated anyway, for it is only because of ignorance
that our "civilized" Western world is almost com
pletely indifferent while a whole nation is being
slaughtered.
We just could not stand by and watch such
a mass-murder without moving our little finger
to help if we were just fully aware of the facts.
(I am an Austrian student from Vienna and I
was given the chance to see the United States by
an ASSU scholarship. As I lived in the Russian
zone I have a slight imagination of what it is
like to be under Communist rule and strongly
feel that the people must be told the frightful
deeds of Russia as often as only possible, more
over, as words can never describe the horror of

Communist rule and suffering of the people be
hind the Iron Curtain.)

Shame Over Student Disinterest
Editor, The Daily:
The first word from a student at Stanford
about the Hungarian rebellion has been spoken—
by a foreign student.
As an American student, I feel a great sense
of shame when I realize that, much as I deplore
the seeming American attitude of apathy and
lather pathetic indifference toward other than
personal affairs, I have still let myself be one
of these isolationists, and have had to let a for
eign student speak for me in a matter which,
according to American beliefs in liberty and free
dom from oppression, is equally hateful to all
of us—the despicable and brutal Soviet invasion
of Hungary.
The revolt in Hungary was nation-wide. There
was every indication that it would spread with
equal force to the other satellite countries, even
. into the Soviet Union itself.
But the United States was occupied with the
narrow and shallow inanities of election-year
politicking, and had no interest in anything but
whether Stevenson or Eisenhower was the most
popular man in the country. The Hungarian
people needed, at the least, arms; the American
government gave them platitudes and paper sym
pathy.
Even if there is no way to give material help
to this valiant little country—in fact, to the en
tire bloc of Soviet satellites why haven't Ameri
can university students at least protested the
Soviet action in words, deeds and writing in any
way open to them?
Certainly students in universities have a
unique opportunity to band together in the
face of such a crisis, and make their collective
voice of protest—if action be impossible heard
throughout the nation and the world.
As Mr. Harss has said, we American students
can only feel the deepest shame that we have not
proven ourselves worthy of our heritage of hu
man liberty and political freedom by, at the very
least, loudly protesting, individually and collec
tively, the Soviet Union's despicable actions.
