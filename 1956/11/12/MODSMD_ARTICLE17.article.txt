free showing of the film version of Steinbeck's
"Ol Mice and Men" in Cubberley Auditorium.

Won't it be great when we won't have to go
hear concerts in Cubberley Auditorium, with
its odor of education and memories of lecture

a piano recital there Friday night, will be appear

be a pleasant evening though, in spite of the
atmosphere. Recital starts at 8 under the aus

in the musical needle, it might be well to mention
Sunday's Chamber Music and Organ Concert with
Herbert Nanney at the organ and Salgo Sandor

of Baroque music. The concert will be at 4 p.m.

in the musical needle, it might be well to mention
Sunday's Chamber Music and Organ Concert with
Herbert Nanney at the organ and Salgo Sandor
