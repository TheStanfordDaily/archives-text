# Immortal 21' Form First Axe Society
## 
### 
Axe Society came into exist
ence when a small group of male
Stanford students ran off with
the prodigal Axe tucked under
their arms. These men, later
known as the "Immortal 21,"
comprised the first roster of
members in what is today called
Axe Society.
During the war Axe Society
waned into an almost non-exist
ent campus association, but in
1952, six members representing
the classes of '52, '53 and '54 re
organized it. Since then, it has

evolved into a society dedicated
to the duty of familiarizing stu
dents with all aspects of campus
life.
During autumn quarter, Axe
Society usually assists in plan
ning for the Big Game Alumni
Reunion. Winter quarter it aids
all campus drives as well as
Alumni Association activities.
In spring the annual Activities
I Handbook, distributed to incom
i ing freshmen, is compiled.
Throughout the year, Axe Soci
ety serves as host to all campus
visitors through the general sec
retary's office. It is now co-ordi
nating the annual Alumni Mem
bership Drive.

Axe boasts as past and present
members many ASSU officers.
Cardinal members, class offi
cers, sponsors and chairmen of
several committees. Membership
is permanent once acceptance is
obtained. "We try to spread mem
bership evenly throughout the
classes and living groups," Bill
Crookston, Axe Society president,
said.
Crookston urged that "students
take advantage of present re
duced alumni membership rates."
Information about the drive may
be obtained from the campus di
rectory card which Axe and the
Alumni Association published
this quarter.
