# Petroleum Lab Construction Will Start in December
## 
### 
Stanford University will begin
construction about Dec. 1 on the
Lloyd Noble Laboratory of Petro
leum Engineering.
It will contain a 45-seat class
loom, five laboratories, a seminar
and library room, five two-man
offices for graduate students, and
a drafting room.
According to Dean Park of the
School of Mineral Sciences, the
laboratory will provide Stanford
with one of the outstanding facili
ties in the field of geophysics on
the Pacific Coast.
Frank G. Miller, professor of
petroleum engineering, will be in
charge of undergraduate and
graduate teaching and research
activties in the building.
"In the Noble Laboratory we
shall study properties of gas and
oil under conditions of high pres
sure and temperature that exist
in the natural underground
pools," Miller said.
"Evaluation of underground
formations quality testing of
crude oil and gas, and research
on their physical properties and
tlow behavior are among the
projects which will be underta
ken," said Miller.
Bids are being sought for the
6560-square-foot structure which
is scheduled to be completed next
summer at a cost of $150,000.
