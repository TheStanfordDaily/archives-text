# Cards' Rose Bowl Hopes Die As OSC Edges Stanford, 20-19
## Indians Ahead by Wide Margin Until Beavers Score Two TD's in Fourth Period to Cinch Win 
### Bob Mierow 
Two points in two weeks. They certainly simplified the Christmas
vacation plans of a host of Stanford students.
Little place-kicking artist Mickey Raftery sat on the bench Satur
day nursing a bum knee as Stanford dropped its second consecutive
one-point ball game, 20-19, to Oregon State. With it vanished practi-

cally all hopes of a Rose Bowl
bid for the Indians.
Only two games remain on the
Stanford schedule. Washington
invades the Stadium next week
and California hosts the Tribe the
following Saturday. Oregon State
faces lowly Idaho and Oregon.
Usually reliable Doug Dick
failed to equal the crossbar-split
ting talents of OSC's John Clark
and that was the ball game.
Breakaway Threats
Besides Clarke, the Beavers can
thank deceptive breakaway
threats Paul Lowe and Earnel
Durden and Coach Tommy Proth
ro's strategy to pace his regulars
for the victory.
"Durden and Lowe are the best
runners we faced all year," said
Tribe mentor Chuck Taylor after
the game. That's quite a compli
ment considering the Cards have
faced such ball - carriers as Jon
Arnett and C. R. Roberts of USC.
Clarence Peaks of Michigan State
and sophomore wizard Dan Clark
of Ohio State.
Both Durden and Lowe are
sophomores. Give them a couple
of years of experience and they
could be all-time OSC greats.
First Beaver TI)
Durden set up the Beavers'
first tally by scooting for 16, 21
and nine yards on three reverses.
Joe Francis bucked over in three
tries from the nine-yard stripe.
Stanford battled back to tally
twice in the second quarter on
drives of 59 and 80 yards. Lou
Valli bucked over for the first
score from the three after a trio
of Brodie passes had moved the
ball into scoring position.
Three more completed passes
by the Big Red passing magician
set up the second Card score. Bri
die rolled out to his right for a
three-yard touchdown jaunt be
hind a key block by flanker
back Jerry Angove.
During a period in the first and
second quarters, Brodie com
pleted seven consecutive passes.
His total for the day was 19 com
pletions in 31 attempts for 223
yards.
The Beavers did not apply the
seven- and eight-man rush on Bio
