## Indians Ahead by Wide Margin Until Beavers Score Two TD's in Fourth Period to Cinch Win 
### Bob Mierow 
Two points in two weeks. They certainly simplified the Christmas
vacation plans of a host of Stanford students.
Little place-kicking artist Mickey Raftery sat on the bench Satur
day nursing a bum knee as Stanford dropped its second consecutive
one-point ball game, 20-19, to Oregon State. With it vanished practi-

cally all hopes of a Rose Bowl
bid for the Indians.
Only two games remain on the
Stanford schedule. Washington
invades the Stadium next week
and California hosts the Tribe the
following Saturday. Oregon State
faces lowly Idaho and Oregon.
Usually reliable Doug Dick
failed to equal the crossbar-split

"Durden and Lowe are the best

Durden set up the Beavers'
first tally by scooting for 16, 21
and nine yards on three reverses.
Joe Francis bucked over in three
tries from the nine-yard stripe.
Stanford battled back to tally
twice in the second quarter on
drives of 59 and 80 yards. Lou
Valli bucked over for the first
score from the three after a trio
of Brodie passes had moved the
ball into scoring position.
Three more completed passes
by the Big Red passing magician
set up the second Card score. Bri

three-yard touchdown jaunt be

Stanford used what amounted
to an eight-man line in its unsuc
cessful attempt to stop the Cor
vallis eleven's running attack,
the three linebackers rnoved
right up with the five linemen as
the ball was snapped.
The Indians scored what ap
peared to be the clinching touch
flown late in the third quarter.
A 1 Harrington, set free by Ty
Polich's crisp block, rambled 41
yards up the left sideline on a
punt return to begin the Tribe

43 yards in eight plays to move

OSC's final and game-winning
touchdown was set up by Tom

Francis crossed up the Tribe
defense by firing a pass to re
serve end Frank Negri on the
goal line. Francis' kick was low
but it didn't make any difference.
The Tribe had almost nine min
utes to come back. Brodie mixed
runs by Valli and Young with
passes to Isaacs and Van Gaider
to move the ball to OSC's 28. A
six-yard loss on a pitchout and
two incompleted passes later the
Cards surrendered the ball and
all hope for victory.
Taylor picked guard John

Little place-kicking artist Mickey Raftery sat on the bench Satur
day nursing a bum knee as Stanford dropped its second consecutive
one-point ball game, 20-19, to Oregon State. With it vanished practi-

Only two games remain on the
Stanford schedule. Washington
invades the Stadium next week
and California hosts the Tribe the

faces lowly Idaho and Oregon.

and nine yards on three reverses.
Joe Francis bucked over in three
tries from the nine-yard stripe.
Stanford battled back to tally

drives of 59 and 80 yards. Lou
Valli bucked over for the first
score from the three after a trio
of Brodie passes had moved the
ball into scoring position.

and six-man rush at the passer.
Stanford used what amounted
to an eight-man line in its unsuc
cessful attempt to stop the Cor
vallis eleven's running attack,
the three linebackers rnoved
right up with the five linemen as
the ball was snapped.
The Indians scored what ap
peared to be the clinching touch
flown late in the third quarter.
A 1 Harrington, set free by Ty
Polich's crisp block, rambled 41
yards up the left sideline on a
punt return to begin the Tribe

43 yards in eight plays to move

touchdown was set up by Tom

Brodie pass. Six plays later the
Beavers had a second down situ

Francis crossed up the Tribe
defense by firing a pass to re
serve end Frank Negri on the
goal line. Francis' kick was low
but it didn't make any difference.
The Tribe had almost nine min
utes to come back. Brodie mixed
runs by Valli and Young with
passes to Isaacs and Van Gaider
to move the ball to OSC's 28. A
six-yard loss on a pitchout and
two incompleted passes later the
Cards surrendered the ball and
all hope for victory.
Taylor picked guard John
Clark as one of Stanford's out
standing linemen against the Bea
vers. Paul Wiggin and Troy Bar
bee also drew praise from their
boss.
"I wouldn't trade Wiggin for
anybody," Taylor disclosed. "He's
