# Axe Backfires, Slices Roses From Stanford
## 
### Dick Meister 
.Stanford rooters brought out
Axe yell twice Saturday and twice
it was turned on them as Oregon
State neatly sliced a bouquet of
roses out of eager Indian hands.
This was the big one, the money
game for the roses. Players knew
it, and fans knew it. With Stan
ford down, 19-20, late in the fourth
quarter, Indian rooters called for
the yell usually reserved for Cali
fornia.
Stanford answered the call with
a sustained drive, the last run for
the roses. But an equally eager
band of Oregon State rooters roar
ed as their Beavers held Stanford
and earned No. 1 shot at the Rose
Bowl.
In the stands as well as on the
field both schools put in a full
60 minutes of all-out effort. OSC
partisans didn't let their size hold
them down, with some 200 stu
dents and a thousand or more local
rooters continually screaming.
OSC Girls
State brought its five pompon
girls along. The girls must train
as devotedly as their football he
roes. Depending on smelling salts
rather than times out to revive
their spirits, they kept the rock 'n'
roll gyrating for 60 minutes.
The crowd of 62,000 was swelled
by some 2000 high school musi
cians participating in Stanford's
second annual High School Band
Day. They represented 32 high
schools from the San Francisco
Bay Area and Peninsula.
They put on a half-time combi
nation fest of songs of the armed
forces, under the hand of Stan
ford Band Master Jules Shuckett.
Pompon Exchange
Half-time was livened by the
usual exchange of pompon girls.
But the rock 'n' roll beauties from
OSC couldn't get their favorite
record started on the Stanford
side. They weren't as well receiv
ed as they have been in the past.
The reason: Stanford roughs fi
nally have some real pompon girls
of their own to ogle.
Oregon State fans have picked
up the latest Pacific Coast Con
ference fad, the air horn. They
also picked a trick from Stanford
rooting sections: they too bounced
a little black balloon from fan to
fan.
Cheers almost as loud as those
on opposite 50 • yard lines came
from end zone spectators at the
end of the first and third quar
ters. In each case one team was
driving for the end zone when the
gun sounded, and those in the end
zones loudly cheered or booed, ac
cording to their location.
The game was marred by one
fist fight in the stands. It took
10 local policemen to quell the
offenders. They carted one Levi
dad youngster off to the pokey
as a result.
The law also put in its usual
