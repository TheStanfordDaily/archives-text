# LOSING MONEY
## Accountant Called to Hike Cellar Profits 
### 
An accountant from the Los
Angeles firm of Hoiwath & Iloi
wath has been called in to deter
mine what can he done to increase
Cellar profits.
The Cellar, operated as a serv
ice to the students, has been losing
money for several years. Chris
tine Flicker, director of University
residences, estimates that the loss
last year exceeded $3000.
The reason, according to Miss
Ricker, is the number of hours
the Cellar must stay open to serve
student needs. The lower Cellar
will be crowded at certain limes
of the day and nearly empty at
others.
Miss Ricker pointed out that a
large staff is needed to serve
these crowds when they occur,
and the staff must remain, when
they disappear, to serve the later
crowds.
Self-Competition
The Cellar is actually running
in competition with itself. This
unprofitable situation is brought
about by the desire of the Union
Board to serve student needs.
The Snack Bar is a relatively
new part of the Cellar unit. It
was not opened until after World
War 11, and people who would
ordinarily purchase lunch in the
lower Cellar now go to the Snack
Bar.
While this situation results in
the whole unit making money, the
lower Cellar will run in Ihe red.
The opening of the Snack Bar
alsf) means that two separate
staffs must be maintained.
Rainy Days
Miss Ricker pointed out (he con
sequences of this action on rainy
days, when "the Snack Bar won't
do much business and everyone
crowds the Collar. Yet two peo
ple must stay for the hardy
souls."
Other competition comes from
the Cellar unit in the Encina base
ment and the "Holes" operated in
the women's residences. Miss
Ricker also noted that each time
the University opens a new dor
mitory potential Cellar customers
are diminished. People will not
eat at the Cellar when they have
already paid for lunch in the
dorms.
The accountant will arrive with
in two weeks and look over the
whole set-up to make recommen
dations lor increased efficiency
and decreased expenses. How
ever. Miss Ricker seems dubious
about the results so long as the
purpose r»f the Cellar is "to serve
student needs."

The reason, according to Miss
Ricker, is the number of hours
the Cellar must stay open to serve
student needs. The lower Cellar
will be crowded at certain limes
of the day and nearly empty at
others.
Miss Ricker pointed out that a
large staff is needed to serve
these crowds when they occur,
and the staff must remain, when
they disappear, to serve the later
crowds.
Self-Competition
The Cellar is actually running
in competition with itself. This
unprofitable situation is brought
about by the desire of the Union
Board to serve student needs.
The Snack Bar is a relatively
new part of the Cellar unit. It
was not opened until after World
War 11, and people who would
ordinarily purchase lunch in the
lower Cellar now go to the Snack
Bar.
While this situation results in
the whole unit making money, the
lower Cellar will run in Ihe red.
The opening of the Snack Bar
alsf) means that two separate
staffs must be maintained.
Rainy Days
Miss Ricker pointed out (he con
sequences of this action on rainy
days, when "the Snack Bar won't
do much business and everyone
crowds the Collar. Yet two peo
ple must stay for the hardy
souls."
Other competition comes from
the Cellar unit in the Encina base
ment and the "Holes" operated in
the women's residences. Miss
Ricker also noted that each time
the University opens a new dor
mitory potential Cellar customers
are diminished. People will not
eat at the Cellar when they have
already paid for lunch in the
dorms.
The accountant will arrive with
in two weeks and look over the
whole set-up to make recommen
dations lor increased efficiency
and decreased expenses. How
ever. Miss Ricker seems dubious
about the results so long as the
purpose r»f the Cellar is "to serve
student needs."
