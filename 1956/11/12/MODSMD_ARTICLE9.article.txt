# Men Outnumbered By Women in 1956 Big Game Gaieties
## 
### 
The Stanford ratio is reversed
in this year's Gaieties cast.
There are 55 women in the
troupe and 20 men, making the
ratio 2.7 in favor of the men. This
situation has come about through
the addition of a 40-woman chorus
line which will be seen in two
numbers and the finale.
The women will appear in "A
Pretty Girl Is Like a Pretty Girl,"
a take-off on the gaudy tradition
of the Ziegfeld Follies. The cho
rus will wear four-fool headdress
es. cut-away skirts and gaudy
trims. Gene Carlson will be the
sole male member of the act. The
chorus will also be featured in the
last act In "Girlie Kick."
"My Fair Pelvis," starring Gary
Waynesmith, is a combined take
off on "My Fair Lady" and Elvis
Presley. Also featured in the act
will be Mario Brierly, Michael du-
Pont and Mark Sammer. A male
quartet, starring Glenn Dußose,
William Kinsolving, Lair Parent
and Jim Ralph, will imitate Pies
lev's unorthodox style.
Nancy Wiser will star in "It's
the Sweetest," a comedy song
done by a former burlesque queen
who doesn't understand modern
"rock 'n' roll." A number entitled
simply "Four People From . . ." is
the tie-in of the show with Big
Game, according to Roger Can
noll, Ram's Head president. It
will feature Gail Aguilar, Dave
Dierdorff. Mary Ann Van Bercke
laer and Addison Yeaman.
