# Rebels Hit New Regime With Strike
## Hungarian Workers' Refusal to Co-operate Threatens Starvation 
### 
VIENNA, Nov. 12 (UP)—A
general strike by Hungarian
workers became Iho ma jor rebel
weapon today against the Rus
sian army and the puppet Com
munist government.
Determined bands of national
ists still fought the hopeless fight
against Russian tanks and troops
in Budapest and in the provinces.
But the rebels began playing up
the 20-day-old strike which has
paralyzed the economy and added
to the troubles of the Commu
nists already plagued by the
threat of starvation throughout
the country.
Fighting was reported still con
tinuing on Csepei Island, at the
northern suburb of IJ.jpest and
the Koebanya industrial district
on the southeastern edge of Bu
dapest. The reports were not im
mediately confirmed, however.
Early today heavy guns opened
up, but neither the sites of the
batteries nor their targets could
be determined.
Leaflets to Workers
Leaflets distributed in the
streets of Budapest appealed to
the workers: "Do not work under
the command of the occupiers
and the illegal usurping govern
ment."
"We shall ration our supplies
and help each other. But we shall
continue to strike."
The government of Premier Ja
nos Kadar tried to bait workers
back to factories with promises
that food would be sold in the
plants.
Kadar himself admitted yester
day that the situation was "diffi
cult." fie promised a moderate
independent government if the
strike is ended and order re
stored.
Nationwide Refusal
The nationwide refusal to
work, which started shortly after
the rebellion broke Oct. 23, ap
peared developing the very
"chaos" which provided the Ka
dar regime with the excuse for
calling in Soviet troops.
Returning Western newsmen
reported the city a wreck. As late
as Thursday, bodies lay in the
streets unburied. The stench of
death was everywhere. Russian
tanks coughed death. Whole
houses were pulverized to kill in
dividual snipers.
The people complained bitterly
that, the West had failed to pro
vide arms needed to fight the
Russians.
They said Western radio broad
casts had been offering sympa
thy for years. But when the chips
were down, the West failed to
provide material aid.

the 20-day-old strike which has
paralyzed the economy and added
to the troubles of the Commu
nists already plagued by the
threat of starvation throughout
the country.
Fighting was reported still con
tinuing on Csepei Island, at the
northern suburb of IJ.jpest and
the Koebanya industrial district
on the southeastern edge of Bu
dapest. The reports were not im
mediately confirmed, however.
Early today heavy guns opened
up, but neither the sites of the
batteries nor their targets could
be determined.
Leaflets to Workers
Leaflets distributed in the
streets of Budapest appealed to
the workers: "Do not work under
the command of the occupiers
and the illegal usurping govern
ment."
"We shall ration our supplies
and help each other. But we shall
continue to strike."
The government of Premier Ja
nos Kadar tried to bait workers
back to factories with promises
that food would be sold in the
plants.
Kadar himself admitted yester
day that the situation was "diffi
cult." fie promised a moderate
independent government if the
strike is ended and order re
stored.
Nationwide Refusal
The nationwide refusal to
work, which started shortly after
the rebellion broke Oct. 23, ap
peared developing the very
"chaos" which provided the Ka
dar regime with the excuse for
calling in Soviet troops.
Returning Western newsmen
reported the city a wreck. As late
as Thursday, bodies lay in the
streets unburied. The stench of
death was everywhere. Russian
tanks coughed death. Whole
houses were pulverized to kill in
dividual snipers.
The people complained bitterly
that, the West had failed to pro
vide arms needed to fight the
Russians.
They said Western radio broad
casts had been offering sympa
thy for years. But when the chips
were down, the West failed to
provide material aid.
