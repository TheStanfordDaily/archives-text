### 
LONDON. Nov. 12 (UP)—The first United Nations truce observers
arrived in Egypt today in advance of a UN international force mo
bilizing in Italy. The police force will move into the Suez Canal Zone
tomorrow.
Five UN observers, headed by U.S. Colonel Newton Nelson, flew

into Cairo. Five others drove
from Jerusalem to Port Said, the
occupied northern terminus of
the Suez Canal Zone where An
glo-French and Egyptian troops
were maintaining a precarious
truce.
In the Naples, Italy, staging
area, troops from Colombia
joined a Scandinavian advance
guard in last - minute military
drills while awaiting the go-ahead
to fly by neutral Swiss airlift to
battle-torn Egypt.
A spokesman for Swiss Air
lines said the first DC-6-B planes
were ready to take off as soon as
instructions arrived.
First Units
The 50 Norwegians, 50 Danes
and 52 Colombians made up the
first units of a force expected to
number 6000 men from nine na
tions.
A Canadian contingent was on
its way here, to be followed by
soldiers from Sweden Finland,
India, Pakistan and Brazil. A
101 h nation, Ethiopia, also has of
fered men.
The UN was racing against
lime to get the international
force, expected eventually 1o in
clude troops from nine nations,
into the truce area before Mos
cow could carry out threats to
send "volunteers" in on the side
of (he Arab nations.
New Rumblings
Even as the UN force prepared
to take over, there were rum
blings of new trouble in the ex
plosive Middle East:
• The heads of all Arab Middle
East states, with the exception of
Egypt, gathered in Beirut, Leba
non, for a "summit." conference
designed to tighten co-ordination
of their policies against Britain,
France and Israel. •
• Israeli political sources said
Russia has promised Syria to in
tervene with Soviet "volunteer"
troops if hostilities break out on
Israel's border with Syria and
Jordan. Observers in Moscow
feared a "second round" of Arab-
Israeli warfare might break out
there in view of the concentration
of Syrian, Iraqi and Jordanian
troops.
Calls Reserves
• Saudi Arabia called up all re
serves and men with military
training and King Saud appealed
to President Eisenhower to take
| "positive action" in the Middle
; East to avert "a war threatening
; humanity."
• An air raid alert was report
ed this morning in Cairo and anti
aircraft guns went into action a
short time later in Heliopolis, six
miles to the north. There was no
indication any bombs wore drop
ped.
• In Port Said. British officials
charged the Egyptians were ap
parently trying to cut off the
city's water supply in a move
against Anglo-French occupation
of the key canal point.

LONDON. Nov. 12 (UP)—The first United Nations truce observers
arrived in Egypt today in advance of a UN international force mo
bilizing in Italy. The police force will move into the Suez Canal Zone
tomorrow.
Five UN observers, headed by U.S. Colonel Newton Nelson, flew

into Cairo. Five others drove
from Jerusalem to Port Said, the
occupied northern terminus of
the Suez Canal Zone where An
glo-French and Egyptian troops
were maintaining a precarious
truce.
In the Naples, Italy, staging
area, troops from Colombia
joined a Scandinavian advance
guard in last - minute military
drills while awaiting the go-ahead
to fly by neutral Swiss airlift to
battle-torn Egypt.
A spokesman for Swiss Air
lines said the first DC-6-B planes
were ready to take off as soon as
instructions arrived.
First Units
The 50 Norwegians, 50 Danes
and 52 Colombians made up the
first units of a force expected to
number 6000 men from nine na
tions.
A Canadian contingent was on
its way here, to be followed by
soldiers from Sweden Finland,
India, Pakistan and Brazil. A
101 h nation, Ethiopia, also has of
fered men.
The UN was racing against
lime to get the international
force, expected eventually 1o in
clude troops from nine nations,
into the truce area before Mos
cow could carry out threats to
send "volunteers" in on the side
of (he Arab nations.
New Rumblings
Even as the UN force prepared
to take over, there were rum
blings of new trouble in the ex
plosive Middle East:
• The heads of all Arab Middle
East states, with the exception of
Egypt, gathered in Beirut, Leba
non, for a "summit." conference
designed to tighten co-ordination
of their policies against Britain,
France and Israel. •
• Israeli political sources said
Russia has promised Syria to in
tervene with Soviet "volunteer"
troops if hostilities break out on
Israel's border with Syria and
Jordan. Observers in Moscow
feared a "second round" of Arab-
Israeli warfare might break out
there in view of the concentration
of Syrian, Iraqi and Jordanian
troops.
Calls Reserves
• Saudi Arabia called up all re
serves and men with military
training and King Saud appealed
to President Eisenhower to take
| "positive action" in the Middle
; East to avert "a war threatening
; humanity."
• An air raid alert was report
ed this morning in Cairo and anti
aircraft guns went into action a
short time later in Heliopolis, six
miles to the north. There was no
indication any bombs wore drop
ped.
• In Port Said. British officials
charged the Egyptians were ap
parently trying to cut off the
city's water supply in a move
against Anglo-French occupation
of the key canal point.
