## Any Step Is a Landmark

The United Nations lias faced the lest of
Mood, and it lias survived. More lhari just
perpetuating itself, I lie moral force of world *
opinion in tliis international body has made
tlie first concrete step toward achieving peace
in the war-torn Middle East.
Many staunch supporters of the idea of in
ternational organization feared the occurrence
of such a test, believing strongly in llie princi
ples of the UN hut fearing its actual poWer
to deter outbreak of war. In the Middle East
lliey saw road signs pointing the pathway to a
second Ethiopia, the incident which crushed
irrevocably the deterrent force of the League
of Nations and was one of the steps leading to
the outbreak of World War JI.
Moth the Security Council and the General
Assembly, the latter acting as it did in the
Korean crisis in 1950 when Security Council
action was blocked by big-power veto, worked
tirelessly to achieve some sense of peace from
the war rumbles in the Middle East.
The efforts of the UN have not gone un
rewarded, and with the welcome announcement
that Egypt gives her conditional consent to the
stationing of a United Nations police force in
the Suez area we see the first concrete indica
tions that peace may eventually be restored
between Egypt and her assailants.
Many condemn the United Nations for fail-

ing to take action in the Hungarian crisis, hut
it can hardly be expected that a body dedicated
â€¢ to preservation of international peace will risk
all-out war on the speculation that the Russians
would withdraw in horror or that the UN
could act when the major powers are com
mitted to inaction.
However infamous the Soviets' action in
Hungary was, the world can take at least a
measure of satisfaction in that more blood will
not be spilled in the Middle East.
One of the reasons, for the dismal outlook
for the United Nations during the past few
weeks was that people expected it to be every
thing or nothing. Because it is the organ of
last resort, they expect it to work miracles.
They fail to understand that because of the
nationalist ambitions of both major and minor
powers the UN works under severe handicaps
and that any steps it can make toward achieving
a more durable peace are landmarks in them
selves.
The effects of the unified action in Korea
and the Canadian-sponsorc'l police force in the
Middle East may seem faltering now, Iml his
tory will no doubt rceord them as two of the
first successful efforts in which peave-loving
nations have sacrificed a measure of their own
ambitions to unite foreefullv lo avert world
wide holocaust.
