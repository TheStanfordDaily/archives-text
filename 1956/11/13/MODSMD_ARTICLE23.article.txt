'Champions of Human Rights'
Editor, The Daily:
The events of the past two weeks have hardly
a parallel in history. For the first time an entire
people, cruelly suppressed and enslaved for the
eight years, has risen under the threatening
guns of the superior Russian army, a people
fighting with their practically weaponless fists
against the best equipped army in the world. *
Students, women, workers and farmers die—
die with the cry for freedom and help on their
lips. . . . The unanimous plea of the Hungarians
dies away in the hallways of Western democra
cies, does not even rise a spark of enthusiasm
and the wish to help in the hearts of the Ameri
can people.
One cannot help feeling appalled to notice the
utter inability of Americans, as expressed in
newspapers, radio comments and the opinions of
individuals, to realize that now—today—the very
basis of any pretense or claim to stand for free
dom and justice is washed out and swept away
by the events and our reaction to the events of
the last two weeks.
Irreparable damage is done to our cause by
the passivity and inefficiency of the Western
democracies to help Hungary to its natural rights
as a country. In a tremendous effort Hungary
forced open the door toward freedom against a
far superior power, and all we would have had
to do was to put our shoe in the gap and keep
tiie door open.
But no; in stupefied wonder and passive ad
miration, the first chance was given away, and
when the challenge came up in a treacherous
breach of promise and armed aggression against
a defenseless country it was hastily laid away
like a dangerous explosive.
The sickening caution and cowardice with
which important personalities avoided a firm
stand and a pledge for real help was like turning
away one's face from the uplifted hands of a
drowning man. And drowning they are indeed
on the plains of Hungary in their blood, shed for
a hope.
During these days students and other people
throughout the western European nations demon
strate and protest against Russian tyranny and
terror as expertly manifested in these days. But
with the deeply well-rooted and well-founded
hatr ed against Russia goes an equally strong feel
ing of disappointment and disgust with the three
leading Western powers. England and France
placed their own egotistic national interests over
a cause of life or death of a nation, at the same
time giving Rtissia an alibi in their aggressive
intervention.
But also the United States, which evidently
tries to follow a "principle of least action," com
mitted an unpardonable crime against humanity
and their own principles. They are crimes com
mitted by not doing certain things rather than
by doing them.
"What of our business is Hungary?" they seem
to ask, with the startled look of a child who is
disturbed in its play and faced with a problem
it doesn't grasp. Not in any other way can I
explain the detached coolness and sober judgment
of the commentators and politicians who exhaust
themselves in predictions of the end of the fight
ing and Russians moves instead of accepting the
responsibility this country should feel as the only
country strong enough to deal with the Russians
in their way, namely, on the basis of equally
strong armed forces. But instead the last voices
fade away through the ether
For years radio stations like "Free Europe" and
the "Voice of America" have aroused hopes in

the eastern European countries, creating the feel
ing among the people that all that was needed
to safeguard American help was a revolution
against the ruling system, impossible as it seemed
to be.
With the unshakable strength of last hopes,
this idea was kept alive and grew. Grew into a
flaming dream that today was quenched under
the unchallenged brutality of Russian troops.
The incredible had happened, and all it met was
deaf ears on our side.
It is our own future existence as free people
that is decided, and sooner or later we ourselves
will be presented the bloody bill. With the very
inactivity of the West (and its overactivity in
Egypt) in the past two weeks it has smashed all
future resistance in the suppressed eastern Euro
pean countries, depriving Europe of the idol of
the United States as the spiritual as well as
material leader of the West and the last bastion
of freedom.

'Are You Proud?'
Editor, The Daily:
Most of us here at Stanford are citizens of the
United States. As such, we enjoy the privileges
of cilizens of a democratic country. It appears
that we also derive some duties from this citizen
ship. A democracy, in theory at least, is con
trolled by the desires of its population. If it is
to survive, it must exhibit to its leaders these
desires, or it falls or tends to dictatorship.
We, as individuals, feel that we Stanford stu
dents, as well as the rest of the population, have
shown a criminal disrespect for these duties in
the past two weeks.
There has been a revolution in Hungary. Nearly
100,000 people have spilled their blood in an effort
to achieve the human dignity and individual in
tegrity that we purport to hold sacred. We, as
students, are supposed to be the future leaders
of our nation, yet we have done nothing to show
actively an interest in the people of Hungary.
What worth as believers in the principles of
democracy have we if our chosen leaders hear
no whisper of interest in a matter which so fla
grantly violates the beliefs which we Americans
claim to embrace?
We would like to point out that Saturday a
number of people, in excess of 60,000, showed
enough interest in their own recreation to attend
a football game.
We would like to ask the students of Stanford
to consider four questions which we ourselves
have been forced to consider:
« Did you feel enough anger or sympathy over
the Hungarian situation to even consider attend
ing the demonstration in San Francisco?
• Are you going to fulfill your civic duty to
express yourself?
• Did you attend the football game?
• In the light of your answers to the above
questions are you proud of yourself?

An Accounting Problem?
Editor, The Daily:
I read with interest the article about the Cel
lar's financial embarrassment as decsribed in
Monday's Daily. There one day last summer my
wife and 1 I were served six pieces of silverware
with our lunch. Four of these carried with them
large food particles left by previous diners.
Neither of us has since patronized the Cellar.
Now really, is this an accounting problem?

One cannot help feeling appalled to notice the

by the events and our reaction to the events of

Irreparable damage is done to our cause by
the passivity and inefficiency of the Western
democracies to help Hungary to its natural rights

forced open the door toward freedom against a
far superior power, and all we would have had
to do was to put our shoe in the gap and keep

intervention.

tries to follow a "principle of least action," com

"What of our business is Hungary?" they seem

themselves in predictions of the end of the fight

responsibility this country should feel as the only
country strong enough to deal with the Russians
in their way, namely, on the basis of equally
strong armed forces. But instead the last voices
fade away through the ether
For years radio stations like "Free Europe" and
the "Voice of America" have aroused hopes in

the eastern European countries, creating the feel

to safeguard American help was a revolution
against the ruling system, impossible as it seemed
to be.
With the unshakable strength of last hopes,
this idea was kept alive and grew. Grew into a
flaming dream that today was quenched under
the unchallenged brutality of Russian troops.

It is our own future existence as free people

Most of us here at Stanford are citizens of the
United States. As such, we enjoy the privileges
of cilizens of a democratic country. It appears
that we also derive some duties from this citizen
ship. A democracy, in theory at least, is con
trolled by the desires of its population. If it is
to survive, it must exhibit to its leaders these
desires, or it falls or tends to dictatorship.
We, as individuals, feel that we Stanford stu
dents, as well as the rest of the population, have
shown a criminal disrespect for these duties in
the past two weeks.
There has been a revolution in Hungary. Nearly
100,000 people have spilled their blood in an effort
to achieve the human dignity and individual in
tegrity that we purport to hold sacred. We, as
students, are supposed to be the future leaders
of our nation, yet we have done nothing to show
actively an interest in the people of Hungary.
What worth as believers in the principles of
democracy have we if our chosen leaders hear
no whisper of interest in a matter which so fla
grantly violates the beliefs which we Americans
claim to embrace?
We would like to point out that Saturday a
number of people, in excess of 60,000, showed
enough interest in their own recreation to attend
a football game.
We would like to ask the students of Stanford
to consider four questions which we ourselves
have been forced to consider:
« Did you feel enough anger or sympathy over
the Hungarian situation to even consider attend
ing the demonstration in San Francisco?
• Are you going to fulfill your civic duty to
express yourself?
• Did you attend the football game?
• In the light of your answers to the above
questions are you proud of yourself?

Most of us here at Stanford are citizens of the
United States. As such, we enjoy the privileges
of cilizens of a democratic country. It appears
that we also derive some duties from this citizen
ship. A democracy, in theory at least, is con
trolled by the desires of its population. If it is
to survive, it must exhibit to its leaders these
desires, or it falls or tends to dictatorship.
We, as individuals, feel that we Stanford stu
dents, as well as the rest of the population, have
shown a criminal disrespect for these duties in
the past two weeks.
There has been a revolution in Hungary. Nearly
100,000 people have spilled their blood in an effort
to achieve the human dignity and individual in
tegrity that we purport to hold sacred. We, as
students, are supposed to be the future leaders
of our nation, yet we have done nothing to show
actively an interest in the people of Hungary.
What worth as believers in the principles of
democracy have we if our chosen leaders hear
no whisper of interest in a matter which so fla
grantly violates the beliefs which we Americans
claim to embrace?
We would like to point out that Saturday a
number of people, in excess of 60,000, showed
enough interest in their own recreation to attend
a football game.
We would like to ask the students of Stanford
to consider four questions which we ourselves
have been forced to consider:
« Did you feel enough anger or sympathy over
the Hungarian situation to even consider attend
ing the demonstration in San Francisco?
• Are you going to fulfill your civic duty to
express yourself?
• Did you attend the football game?
• In the light of your answers to the above
questions are you proud of yourself?
