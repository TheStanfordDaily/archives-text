BKOIHIO ( AN HUN TOOâ€”Stanford's John Brodie (12) slips past
would-be Beaver tacklers on his way to a 13-yard gain against the
Oregon Staters Saturday. Troy Barbee (71), Indian tackle, comes
in on the third-quarter play. Brodie was passing (completing 19
out of 31) and running well for the Tribe, but it wasn't enough as
OSC prevailed, 20-19. Daily Photo by George Wyse
