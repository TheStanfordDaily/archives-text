# Gridders Face Huskies Next; In Short Drill
## Luckless Cards Grim As They Prepare for Last Home Appearance 
### 
Stanford's luckless gridders
grimly got down to work yester- i
day in preparation for Saturday's
battle with the University of
Washington.
Chuck Taylor is optimistic over :
Stanford's chances in the two
games remaining on the schedule,
Washington and California, but
the bloom is gone from the In
dians for this year.
Oregon State needs only a win
over the Idaho Vandals to cinch
the Pasadena trip. This is the sec
ond time in four years that a toe
has separated Stanford from the
Rose Bowl bid. In 1953 it was
Sad Sam Tsagalakis who kicked
a field goal for a 23-20 USC vic
tory to eliminate the Indians.
Scouting Report
Practice yesterday saw a shovt
drill and then the team adjourned
tf> the BAC for a scouting report
on the Huskies by George Lynn.
Although Washington was beat
en, 13-9, by UCLA, the Husky
gridders outgained the Bruins by
better than two to one, and only
a 2-yard Washington punt gave
UCLA the victory.
Washington set a new school
record for yardage gained in a
season as they pushed their total
to 2172 yards for eight games.
This broke the previous record set
in 10 games by more than 100
yards. The 1950 UW squad, star
ring Hugh McElhenny and Don
Heinrich, set the old mark.
Optimistic Note
The most optimistic note of the
â€¢lay was sounded by trainer Con
nie Jarvis, who reported that
Stanford went injury free in the
OSC tray. Halfback Mickey Raf
tery, Stanford's sorely missed
PAT kicker, will be back, while
Paul Camera will be back in top
form.
Camera was down and out for
a tense moment last Saturday, but
luckily only had his wind knocked
out and was able to return to
action a few minutes later.
