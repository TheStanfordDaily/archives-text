Stanford Athletic News Director Don Liebendorfer says he has
already received confirmation from a major magazine that Indian
quarterback John Brodie has been named to its team.
The award includes an appearance on the Ed Sullivan TV show.
Oregon State's All-American tackle John Wit to is an apprentice
mortician learning the trade from ex-OSC back Don Durdan, now
funeral director in Corvallis and coroner of Benton County. Witte
is also a top wrestler and hopes to win the NCAA heavyweight mat
championship this year after participating in the Rose Bowl game.
The 1956 Stanford team may not bo Pasadena-bound any more
but it is tho biggest drawing; card in University history.
One week after the Rose Bowl classic, on Jan. 8, co-captain and
tackle Paul Wiggin will be representing the Indians in the Hula Bowl
tilt. This contest pits 22 mainland gridders against a team of Ha
waian all-stars. Jon Arnett of USC will also play.
On this year's San Francisco Olympic Club basketball team are
ex-Stanfordites Russ Lawler, '55, Barry Brown, '56, and George Sel
leck. '56. Two other former Tribe cagers, Run Tomsic, '55, and Jim
Walsh, '52, are now in Melbourne, Australia, with the United States
Olympic Games net squad. Both Walsh and Tomsic have made the
starting line-up, as have Big Bill Russell and K. C. Jones of the 1955-
56 San Francisco Dons.
Dame Fortune's dealing the Cards out of the Rose Howl on two
straight one-point defeats recalls the luckless history of tho 1928
Tribe. Deciding tho issue that year was the USC tilt, played three
days before Herbert Hoover was elected President.
Stanford was the pre-game favorite as the odds were 10-8. and
legendary coach "Pop" Warner was cocky enough to prognosticate:
"I'll be damned if any Southern California squad can outfight a Stan
ford team."
The Warnermen outfought the Trojans that day and also out
gained, outpunted and outpassed them. Amassing 252 yards to SC's
143 and 14 first downs to the Trojans' four, Stanford backs operated
behind one of the most determined groups of linemen ever seen in
Los Angeles Coliseum. As a Daily reporter said, "The Warner line
never played a finer game. Every man on the forward wall gave all
he had."
lint none of Stanford's statistics and none of Stanford's fight
was of any influence upon the final score. The "breaks" simply
went the other way. Four times the Indians threatened deep iii
Trojan territory and four times fumbles threw the chance away.
An intercepted pass set up SC's only touchdown. With a fourth
quarter field goal providing their only legitimate score, the Trojans
won, 10-0, and went on to cop the Coast Conference championship.
Stanford finished third.
Incidentally, that football season was fraught with ill luck for
first-place SC and second-place Cal as well. The Trojans lost tho
Rose Bowl bid on a vote and the Bears lost the Rose Bowl game on
a certain wrong-way run. â€¢
