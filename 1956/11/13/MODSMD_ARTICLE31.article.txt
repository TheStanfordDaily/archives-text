Best Effort

Praises Lowe
"Earnel Durden [OSC's sopho
more wingback] is one of the
finest backs we've ever met."
He also had "kind" things to
say about OSC tailbacks Paul
Lowe, who literally danced 10
yards through the Stanford team
to score the second OSC touch

! down which put the Beavers back
: in the game early in the fourth
: period, and Joe Francis of Hono
lulu.
"John Brodie [the nation's top
I passer] and Paul Wiggin [Stan
ford's nominee for an All-America
1 lineman] played their best games
! of the year," he said.

passes to set up all three, of the
Stanford touchdowns, and Wiggin
was a standout in the line."
