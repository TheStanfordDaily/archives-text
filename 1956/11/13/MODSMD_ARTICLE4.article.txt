### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 12 (UP) -The Hungarian puppet
government of Janos Kadar told the United Nations today it would
refuse to admit UN observers into Hungary.
The notice was given Secretary General Dag Ilammarskjold in a
cable from Istvan Sebes, acting minister for foreign affairs of the

| "revolutionary workers' and peas
ants' government of the Hunga
rian people's republic."
"In view of the fact that Soviet
troops are in Hungary at the re
quest of tlie Hungarian govern
ment, the Hungarian government
is decidedly of the opinion that
the sending of representatives to
be appointed by the Secretary
General of the United Nations is
not warranted." the cable said.
Government Competent
Sebes said in his telegram that
the Hungarian and Soviet gov
ernments are "exclusively compe
tent" to negotiate for withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Hungarian
soil.
It said only Hungarian author
ities could handle the holding of
free elections in Hungary.
Sebes said, however, that the
Hungarian government would ac
cept Western food and medicines
for the Hungarian people and is
co-operating with the Interna
tional Red Cross.
"The Soviet troops in Hungary
do not hinder this relief work in
any way," the cable said.
"Fascists and Criminals"
Sebes charged that elements in
cluding "organized fascists" and
"ordinary criminals" had seized
on peaceful demonstrations for
"patriotic demands" and created
general disorder throughout Hun
gary.
"In I his situation the first task
was the restoration of law and
order, the prevention of the dan
ger of fascism, which task Hun
gary has . . . undertaken to carry
out," Sebes said.
"In the serious situation which
arose, the revolutionary workers'
and peasants' government could
restore law and order only by re
questing the aid of Soviet troops.
After the complete restoration of
order the Hungarian government
will immediately begin negotia
tions with the government of the
Soviet Union for the withdrawal
of these troops from Hungary.
"On the basis of the foregoing,
the Hungarian government most
emphatically states the settle
ment of the situation which has
arisen in Hungary lies exclusive
ly within the internal legal com
petence of the Hungarian state."
