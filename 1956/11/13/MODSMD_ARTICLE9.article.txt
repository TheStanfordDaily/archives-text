# Freshmen Begin Round-the-Clock Watch on Bonfire
## 
### 
With searchlights ablaze and
armed with Dean William Craig's
approval to use "anything short
of a cannon" for defense, the men
of the class of '60 have started the
annual round-the-clock vigil to
guard their precious bonfire ma
terials against the maraudings of
Cal students, local jokesters and
spiteful upperclassmen.
Encouraged by promises of a
never-ending line of Roble girls
to bring them coffee and com
pany through the night, the
freshmen started their watch last
Sunday night and will continue
it through Nov. 21. After that a
call will go out for volunteers.
Each of the houses of Wilbur
and the freshman corridors of
Stern have been assigned a day.
The watch is split into three
shifts: from midnight to <8 ;i.m.,
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and from
4 p.m. to midnight.
Materials are piling up well as
the arrival is expected soon of
the 19 65 - foot telephone polos
which will form the main base of
the bonfire and all the wood from
a dormitory being ripped down in
Menlo Park.
