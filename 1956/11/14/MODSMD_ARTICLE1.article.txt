# Sterling Gives Reasons for Stand in PCC Turmoil

"lf an institution of higher learning will not work to honor a
compact freely agreed to, then it has debased itself and its purpose,"
President Wallace Sterling of Stanford declared in an article on the
Pacific Coast Conference Code violations in the November issue of
the Stanford Review.
The Review, published for its 20,000 members by the Stanford
Alumni Association, will appear next week. The article was prepared
for alumni in response to requests from graduates for a statement
of the University's position.
Stanford has not engaged in "whistle-blowing" on other Confer
ence schools or self-righteousness, Dr. Sterling said.
"Our concern has been to make our word as good as our bond
by doing our best to live up to the obligation of our Conference com
pact with our sister institutions as well as to Stanford's own Funda
mental Standard of honesty and good conduct by which our students
govern themselves," the president stated.
Dr. Sterling sTiid that, contrary to frequent allegations, Stan
ford has not claimed to be "pure" in the matter of Code violations.
What we have claimed is this: that we have worked hard and

faithfully to honor the provisions of the Code," he stated, adding that
he had made explicit with the faculty, Director of Athletics, coach
ing staff, and past and present officers of the Buck Club their re
sponsibility for administering Stanford intercollegiate athletics in
accord with the Code. "1 have been assured of their general under
standing and endorsement," he said.
Stanford s own investigation disclosed that a few individuals with
allegiance to Stanford but' over whom the University had no juris
diction were guilty of minor violations. These instances were re
ported to the Conference, Dr. Sterling said.
In May, 19.53, Dr. Sterling recounted, the PCC presidents agreed
that existing provisions of the Code should be honored. Two issues
were given particular consideration: first, the general violations of
the Conference Code; and secondly, the financial assistance to stu
dents participating in intercollegiate athletics.
It is evident, he said, that "violations of the Code continued and
that, in some institutions, officers and staff members had knowledge
of continuing violations and to that extent were party to them. In
most Conference institutions, but not in all, disciplinary action, fre

quently severe, has been taken against those who had failed to
discharge the responsibilities agreed to in May, 1953."
Dr. Sterling explained why Stanford cast the lone vote in the
Conference against the motion which has enabled senior football
players at penalized schools to compete in five games this fall. An
earlier Conference action had declared them ineligible for the year.
I voted as 1 did because I could not agree that a student, guilty of
violating the Code, was entitled to special consideration because he
was a senior."
A university holds students accountable for meeting academic
requirements, for academic honesty and for good conduct," Dr. Ster
ling said in the Review article. "When a student fails to meet these
obligations, he is liable to penalties which range from the withhold
ing of a passing grade to expulsion from the university. A student
is not entitled to exemptions because he is an athlete or because he
is a senior.
"A university is measured most exactly by its educational stand
ards and performance, by the training which it affords to young men
and women who seek to improve their minds by acquiring knowledge

and wisdom, and by the examples it sets for them in matters of char
acter and conduct.
In the whole educational enterprise which is measured by these
standards there is an important place for intercollegiate athletics.
But this place cannot be justified if such importance is attached to
victory on the athletic field as to produce practices which lead to
cheating.
I v\ ould remind you that there are manifold opportunities and
many ways of providing assistance openly and above-board. It is
the concentration of assistance to athletes and the history of dubious
pi act ices in connection with such aid which so strongly suggest that
interest in a student's opportunity for education may be secondary
to interest in a student's ability to win games."
Whistle-blowing— the efforts of an institution found guilty of Code
violations to bring to light violations by another institution was
desc l ibed bj Dr. .Sterling as "a misdirection of energy and animus
which placed under additional strain such good faith as existed
among the Conference institutions."
He said it was unfortunate that equal energy was not expended
in seeing to it that the provisions of the Code were lived up to.

and women who seek to improve their minds by acquiring knowledge

and wisdom, and by the examples it sets for them in matters of char

In the whole educational enterprise which is measured by these
standards there is an important place for intercollegiate athletics.
But this place cannot be justified if such importance is attached to

I v\ ould remind you that there are manifold opportunities and

the concentration of assistance to athletes and the history of dubious

Whistle-blowing— the efforts of an institution found guilty of Code
violations to bring to light violations by another institution was
desc l ibed bj Dr. .Sterling as "a misdirection of energy and animus
which placed under additional strain such good faith as existed
among the Conference institutions."
He said it was unfortunate that equal energy was not expended
in seeing to it that the provisions of the Code were lived up to.
"lf an institution of higher learning will not work to honor a
compact freely agreed to, then it has debased itself and its purpose,"
President Wallace Sterling of Stanford declared in an article on the
Pacific Coast Conference Code violations in the November issue of
the Stanford Review.
The Review, published for its 20,000 members by the Stanford
Alumni Association, will appear next week. The article was prepared
for alumni in response to requests from graduates for a statement
of the University's position.
Stanford has not engaged in "whistle-blowing" on other Confer
ence schools or self-righteousness, Dr. Sterling said.
"Our concern has been to make our word as good as our bond
by doing our best to live up to the obligation of our Conference com
pact with our sister institutions as well as to Stanford's own Funda
mental Standard of honesty and good conduct by which our students
govern themselves," the president stated.
Dr. Sterling sTiid that, contrary to frequent allegations, Stan
ford has not claimed to be "pure" in the matter of Code violations.
What we have claimed is this: that we have worked hard and

faithfully to honor the provisions of the Code," he stated, adding that
he had made explicit with the faculty, Director of Athletics, coach
ing staff, and past and present officers of the Buck Club their re
sponsibility for administering Stanford intercollegiate athletics in
accord with the Code. "1 have been assured of their general under
standing and endorsement," he said.
Stanford s own investigation disclosed that a few individuals with
allegiance to Stanford but' over whom the University had no juris
diction were guilty of minor violations. These instances were re
ported to the Conference, Dr. Sterling said.
In May, 19.53, Dr. Sterling recounted, the PCC presidents agreed
that existing provisions of the Code should be honored. Two issues
were given particular consideration: first, the general violations of
the Conference Code; and secondly, the financial assistance to stu
dents participating in intercollegiate athletics.
It is evident, he said, that "violations of the Code continued and
that, in some institutions, officers and staff members had knowledge
of continuing violations and to that extent were party to them. In
most Conference institutions, but not in all, disciplinary action, fre

quently severe, has been taken against those who had failed to
discharge the responsibilities agreed to in May, 1953."
Dr. Sterling explained why Stanford cast the lone vote in the
Conference against the motion which has enabled senior football
players at penalized schools to compete in five games this fall. An
earlier Conference action had declared them ineligible for the year.
I voted as 1 did because I could not agree that a student, guilty of
violating the Code, was entitled to special consideration because he
was a senior."
A university holds students accountable for meeting academic
requirements, for academic honesty and for good conduct," Dr. Ster
ling said in the Review article. "When a student fails to meet these
obligations, he is liable to penalties which range from the withhold
ing of a passing grade to expulsion from the university. A student
is not entitled to exemptions because he is an athlete or because he
is a senior.
"A university is measured most exactly by its educational stand
