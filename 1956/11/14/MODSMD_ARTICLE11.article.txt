# Series Speaker Says Intellectual Exchange Needed
## 
### 
The estrangement with Euro
pean intellectuals who are in op
position to the United States' poli
cies must be viewed with concern,
said Ernst Erich Noth last night
at the Tuesday Evening Series
lecture.
Noth, a professor of compara
tive literature at the University of
Oklahoma, said that these intel
lectuals are key figures in our
relations with other countries. He
would like to see a spontaneous
exchange of intellectual writings
between the United States and
Europe begun.
Professor Noth is editor-in-chief
of the international quarterly
Books Abroad, published at the
University on a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation. Profes
sor Hilton of Stanford's Hispanic-
American department, who is an
editor of the literary magazine,
introduced Noth.
The German - born author re
turned recently from a tour of
western Europe, where he talked
with many authors, publishers
and critics. He regretted most
that his report did not include the
East European countries, which
he was unable to visit.
Surface prosperity seemed ap
parent in manv of the countries,
but, as one Swede told North,
"being always assured of having
enough to eat does not make one
happy." Amidst the material suc
cess Noth found that the spirit
remained unsatisfied.
The most dynamic writing ap
peared to be coming from Bel
gium and Austria, Noth said.
There are new German writers of
promise, but their work is not yet
developed enough for judgment.
Spain's and Portugal's literature
is still suppressed by censorship.
Noth said he was impressed by
Swiss newspapers. "Nowhere else
is there more factual, clear, un
biased writing." he said. In Italy
the intellectual and artistic curi
osity is on a level to compare with
the awareness of life, he said.
