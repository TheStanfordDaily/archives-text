# Truce in Middle East Threatened By Delay Of UN Police Force
## Britain and France Hint They Might Reject Egypt's Conditions for Peace 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 13 (UP)â€”The shaky Middle East truce threatened
to fall apart tonight.
Arrival of a 6000-man United Nations police force in Egypt to keep
the peace was delayed for "technical reasons."
UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold postponed for 24 hours

a scheduled flight from New
York to Rome tonight for confer
ences on the Mid-East police force
operation.
Britain and France hinted they
might reject Egypt's conditions
for accepting the police force on
its soil.
Israel reported stepped-up "Fe
dayeen" (Arab suicide comman
do) raids during the last 24
hours.
Iraq demanded liquidation of
Israel.
Military leaders at Anglo
French headquarters on Cyprus
voiced fear of a "sneak" attack
from Syria where Russia has
shipped quantities of MIG jets.
British Colonial Secretary Alan
Lennox-Boyd told Commons Brit
ain was "deeply disturbed" both
by the Soviet threat to send "vol
unteers" to Egypt and by the ex
tent of Soviet penetration in the
Mid-East.
Red Trick
He said this was the trick the
Reds used in Greece and Korea
to continue the fighting and that
"infiltration" in Egypt would be a
follow-up to "large imports of So
viet war material into Egypt
since the beginning of the year
and into Syria."
The Anglo-French attack, he
said, has disrupted "carefully-laid
Soviet plans" on the Mid-East.
For the third day.the vanguard
of the UN police force assembled
at Capodichino Airport near Na
ples. Italy, delayed its takeoff for
Egypt
A UN spokesman said the de
lay was "techncal," and caused
by a decision to send the troops
to the combat zone rather than
to Cairo as originally planned.
However, both Britain and
France indicated displeasure with
Egypt's insistence that it control
the location and movement of UN
troops on its soil.
British Insist
Britain will insist on full imple
mentation of the UN resolution
providing for the establishment
of the police force, sources said.
French Foreign Minister Chris
tian Pineau said Anglo - French
forces would remain where they
are until the UN troops take over
"every essential point." He indi
cated he wanted occupation from
Said to Suez, along the 101-mile j
length of the canal. Egypt's con
ditions could block such an exten
sive occupation.
Arab support of Egypt was so
lidifying.
Iraq, a member of the pro-
Western Baghdad Pact, demand
ed liquidation of the Jewish state
and return of its territory to i
Arab refugees.
Chiefs of seven of the nine!
Ai*ab League nations, with the
exception of Egypt and the Su
dan. met at Beirut, Lebanon,
where Lebanese President Ca
mille Chamoun appealed for sup
port for Egypt in the Suez crisis.
It appeared, however, that the
Arab summit conference would
not support Russia but would try
to chart a middle course between
East and West.
