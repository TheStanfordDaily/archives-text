# A 						Serious Awareness
## 
### 
Ofti \ \vr: iikar the complaint that Stanford
students stand placidly aside as the events of
ihe world <io whirling past them, that they are
content to sit cozy ami warm in their ivorv
tower of academic smugness and let the world
take care of itself.
Often vve have shared in the complaint that
students at this university shrug off their social
conscience with narv a care. We have lamented
the lack of political interest on campus this
vear and the faltering interest in the broader
and deeper aspects of student government.
Nevertheless, if we are to judge by the Hood
of letters we have received and the discussions
we have heard on Quad, at the Cellar and in
residences, the deep humanitarian aspects of
the Hungarian debacle and the possible con
sequences of Middle Eastern warfare have
aroused interest and concern on this campus
in welcome contradiction to the usual concep
tion of the isolated, self-orientated Stanford
student.
11 is not only rampant emotionalism in the
form of shrieking demonstrations that lias be
come manifest on this campus, but there has
also arisen a more serious awareness to the
impact and tragedy of history that is being
made hour by hour in obscure places with
obscure-sounding names.

Every opportunity for further discussion anil
evaluation should he utilized. Through ihe
Thursday afternoon consular talks, the Insti
tute of International Relations has offered stim
ulating speakers and attracted standing-room
only crowds, unhealing strongly the latent in
terest in international affairs on this campus.
It has heen part of the philosophy of this
newspaper that university students are al the
same time citizens of the national and interna
tional community and that their objects of
concern extend beyond Saturday night's dance
and the next football game and pertain to the
course of human events that is going on he von d
the four corners of Quad. For this treason we
have attempted to present as much' news and
interpretation on developing world affairs as
our limited space will allow.
Tomorrow evening the Political Union is
sponsoring a program, a significant part of
which will be dedicated to student debate and
discussion. It is a meeting well worth attend
ing, for throughout the past few weeks it has
become apparent that student opinion on the
Hungarian matter, in particular, is provocative
and fairly enlightened.
The newly born interest on ibis campus is
encouraging. We hope il is indicative of a
permanent trend.
