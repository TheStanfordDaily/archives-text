Representative Skip Rentier has studied the
problem, drawn up a revised petition, a state
ment of policy and an idea for a brochure. The
matter now rests in the hands of Legislature.
At best, the handling of the liquor petition
in the past has been chaotic. For several days
petitions were wildly circulated on campus
urging the legal drinking age be changed to J8;
then new petitions went out urging the age be
changed to 19. Students talked impressively
of starting a state • wide college movement

ii«£i»iiisl the present law. Then .silence.
The emotional fire over llie issue lias died

Nov. 6 elections will necessitate a popular ref
erendum to change the law, and indeed it will
he more difficult to hring about reduction of
the legal drinking age. Hut the fact that the
challenge is greater is no adequate reason why
the matter should he cast off hy a shrug of the
shoulders.
It is time that Legislature knuckled down
and decided, for once and lor all, whether they
are going to give their sanction to the petition
advocating change in the state legal drinking
