# The 						True Purpose
## 
### 
"A UNIVERSITY IS MEASURED most exactly by its
educational standards and performance." This
statement, uttered by Stanford President Wal
lace Sterling, seems to us to define the true
purpose of a university, despite opinions re
ccnlly advanced by Southern California sports
writers and football alumni.
Football has its place in an educational sys
tem. "But," in Sterling's words, "this place
cannot be justified if such importance is at
tached on the athletic field as to produce prac
tices which lead to cheating."
\\ lien the great portion of a university's re
sources are devoted to fielding a winning, pay
ing team to please the fans, then it is time that
something be done. And Sterling is the only
one of the PCC presidents who has stood 100
per cent behind this principle.
Last spring Washington, USC and UCLA
players received their now famous ineligibility

penalties. Last August the presidents' confer
ence, by an 8-to-l vote, reduced the penalties
of offending seniors to a five-game limit.
The one dissenting vote was from Sterling,
who rightfully held that the seniors in question
knew exactly what they were doing when they
received the outside aid. The penalty was in
the PCC regulations and was not meant to be
enforced halfway, though Sterling was the only
one courageous enough to brave the anger of
other schools and newspaper writers hy sav
ing so.
As for Stanford's violations, Sterling has said
he welcomes concrete evidence from anyone,
and as yet no one has found anything.
We solidly support Sterling's stand to try to
hold the PCC together only if the University
does not sacrifice, the academic principles for
which it is famous.
If tlii s is being ''simon-pure,' then we are
proud of it.
