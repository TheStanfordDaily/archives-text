ship in memory of Dr. Arnaud Leavelle, bril
liant Stanford political science professor who

It is fitting that the memorial be a scholar
ship award to the best student in Political
Science 150. For this course, Introduction to
Political Thought, was his favorite and the one
in which students recognized his teaching

genius and his eagerness and capacity to make
them think.
