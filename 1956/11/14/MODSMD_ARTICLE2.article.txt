# Hungarian Rebels Hold Large Industrial Center
## Last Resistance Groups Ignore Communist Government Appeals to End General Strike 
### 
BUDAPEST, Hungary, Nov. 13 (UP)â€”Holdout rebels on Csepel
Island, largest industrial center in Hungary, warned today they
would blow it up rather than surrender.
They were among the last centers of resistance to massed Soviet
tanks and troops who today moved into the industrial suburb of

Ujpest where other resistance
fighters had fought 10 days of all
out attack.
"Revolutionary councils" ig
nored repeated appeals from the
Soviet-supported Communist gov
ernment for an end to the general
strike which has become the re
bellion's chief weapon.
Hundreds of thousands of peo
ple swarmed through the streets,
seeking food, and long lines
formed at distribution points
where bread, potatoes and cab
bage were on sale.
Crowds also formed at any
shop that opened its doors as
Hungarians fearful of inflation
rushed to exchange money that
may soon depreciate in value for
any goods that could be had.
Food and medicines shipped in
by the International Red Cross
were distributed by Hungarian
and foreign workers today, help
ing in some degree to ease the sit
uation.
In New York, it was announced
that Hungary has accepted an of
fer of United Nations aid. Secre
tary General Dag Hammarskjold
postponed his scheduled depar
ture for the Middle East to set
up the aid program.
U.S. Relief Check
U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge Jr. presented to Hammar
skjold today a check for $1 mil
lion as the U.S. contribution to
the UN relief program for Hun
garian refugees.
At the same time, the Soviet
Union voiced in the UN a thinly
veiled warning to its other Iron
Curtain satellites not to attempt
a repetition of the bloody Hunga
rian insurrection.
Although the Hungarian gov
ernment refused to admit a UN
fact-finding team for an on-the
spot investigation, today's mes
sage from Istvan Sebes, acting
foreign minister, said:
"The Hungarian government
states again that it values very
highly the offer of assistance
from the UN and is prepared, in
reference to the proposal of the
Secretary General, to conduct
talks on the best means of pro
viding the assistance required as
well as how the representatives
appointed by the Secretary Gen
eral may participate in organiz
ing the assistance on the spot."
The General Assembly voted to
carry over its regular agenda
from its emergency sessions both
the Middle East and Hungarian
situations. The General (steer
ing) Committee had recommend
ed such action earlier in the day.
There was no objection to car
rying over the Middle East situa
tion. But the Commuinst bloc de
manded the Hungarian question
be dropped. The vote was 62-9
with eight abstentions to put it
on the agenda.
Kadar Protected
Premier Janos Kadar and his
seven-man government remained
holed up in the parliament build
ing under the protection of hun
dreds of Russian troops, tanks
and guns. The general belief in
Budapest was that Kadar and his
cohorts would be lynched if the
Russians withdrew their protec
tion.
The lesser officials who would
talk confirmed reports that Ka
dar had been trying to persuade
ex-Premier Imre Nagy now liv
ing as a refugee in the Yugoslav
embassy to support his govern
ment, but said they did not know
the result.
Kadar and Nagy have been
meeting at Ihe embassy. Ambas
sador Dalibor Soldatic had left
for Belgrade, presumably to re
port to his government and re
reive instructions.
