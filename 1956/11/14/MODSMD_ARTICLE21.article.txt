# Frosh Builders Guard Bonfire From Sabotage
## 
### 
Bonfire building by the fresh
man men is in full swing in spite
of the fact that the blaze will con
flict with Thanksgiving dinners.
The frosh men, who started col
lecting wood three weeks ago,
have so far had one preview of
how the fire will look.
Thursday night some unknown
villain set the stacked wood on
fire and destroyed about one
third of the gathered supplies.
"We shouldn't have any more
of that kind of trouble," said Bob
Roberts, bonfire chairman, "be
cause 24 â€¢ hour -a - day guarding
started last Saturday.
"And as a second precaution,"
said Roberts, "about ten Cedro
men are manning the corporation
fire truck and sleeping at the
boat house."
Fire truck manning is a new
idea in bonfire guarding and is
attributed to the class of '60.
Menlo College Is tearing down
a dorm and has contributed all of
it to the Stanford bonfire. Also,
mnny local people have donated
wood.
Yesterday the PG&E company
installed the telephone poles
which form the basic structure
for the actual building of the bon
fire.
The*bonfire building, known as
the "Big Push," starts Wednes
day, Nov. 21.
Wally Hawley, freshman class
president, said that they were
"expecting a large turn-out for
the Big Push even though
Thanksgiving vacation and Stan
Kenton will be competing with
the efforts of ihe class of '60 to
build the biggest bonfire ever."
