## 'Put Up or Shut Up' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
While the Hungarians are at this moment dying by the hundreds,
nay, the thousands, to secure a liberty which by sheer force of arms
will be denied to them, it is imperative that the United States re
appraise, agonizingly if it must, its policy toward the satellite
peoples.
For the ugly truth is that the blood of these unbelievably valiant
Hungarians is as much on our hands as it is on the Russians'. Since
the end of World War 11, it has been no secret that we have encour
aged these people, in so many words, to revolt against their Russian
masters; although refraining from directly supplying them with
arms, we have kept up a ceaseless propaganda campaign via Radio
I ree Europe, balloon leaflets and public pronouncements of our
leaders.
In all our pious exhortations to these captive peoples, we appar
ently failed to make clear to them that no intervention by American
arms could be expected; that it was even unthinkable for the United
States to go further than sponsor resolutions of condemnation
against the Soviet Union in the United Nations; that, in the last
analysis, we could only sit by and watch in utter helplessness the
i inevitable Soviet retribution for fear of offending the Soviets and
I thereby hazarding a third world war.
Radio Free Europe, or any other agency whose words reach
across the Iron Curtain, should not urge revolt, when it should be
clear to the entire world by now that without free world military
intervention, any revolt is doomed to failure. In other words, we
should put up or-shut up.
Yet, Jet no one mistake it, The crisis goes on, the plot thickens,
and we are not untouched for the freedom fighter sprawled dead on
a Budapest street died for us, too.
As the last sniper shot passes into history, do not "ask for whom
the bell tolls, it tolls for thee." Donald Jonas
