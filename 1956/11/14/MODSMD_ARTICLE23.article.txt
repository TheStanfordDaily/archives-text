# Cards Prepare Pass Defenses For WU Invasion on Saturday
## 
### Bill Nichols 
Passing got the major emphasis in a two-hour practice session
yesterday as Stanford prepared for Saturday's contest with the Uni
versity of Washington.
Washington is a running team but Chuck Taylor emphasized pass
defense last night, as he realigned the Indian defenses against aerial
attack.

The Huskies face a different
problem in defensing Stanford.
IJW hasn't met a good passing
team since September when ex
teammate Bob Cox and his IVlin
nesotans riddled the Seattleites.
Injury Report Good
The injury report from both
camps is good. From the great
Northwest comes word that A 1
Ferguson is ready to play for the
first time in a month. He saw
limited action last year as a soph
omore, but completed 57 per cent
of his passes this year before
hurting his shoulder.
Stanford's three running backs,
Paul Camera, Lou Valli and Gor
dy Young, all reported to prac
tice in sweatsuits, favoring minor
bumps and bruises, but all will he
ready to go on Saturday.
Guard John Clark came up
with a charlie horse yesterday,
but will be back at top speed to
day.
Six Potent Hacks
Washington will counter John
Brodie, the nation's top passer
and total offense leader, with six
potent running backs. All six
are averaging over 4.5 yards a
carry, with sophoomre Luther
Carr leading the way with 418
yards in 57 carries for a 7.3 aver
age. Carr has lost only seven
paces all year.
Darrell Royal sent his troops
through a short workout yester
day, working mainly on pass de
fense. His Huskies are leading
the conference iti pass defense,
having allowed only 78 yards a
game to he gained on them
through the air, but Brodie
should do considerably better
than that.
