# Elward: 'No Rout' In Braves' Loss
## 
### 
In an unscheduled press confer
ence last night Braves football
coach Mai Elward took exception
to writers who termed Fort Ord's
39-G win over his club a "rout."
Elward termed the soldiers
"pro team" and claimed his boys j
did well to hold them to a 33-point
margin. "Dick Mires ran back a
kickoff 60 yards for us; that's
pretty good," Elward huffily
claimed.
