# UN 						Described as 'Dangerous' By Political Union Speaker

The United Nations is a dangerous threat to United States consti
tutional rights, San Francisco attorney Sylvester McAtee told the
Independent Caucus of the Political Union yesterday. â™¦
McAtee described the UN as a creeping encroachment on matters
of United States domestic concern, saying that there is great danger

of world government, ruled by
people who have no concept of
American ideals and freedoms.
Liberal interpretations of the
UN charter and the United States
Constitution, treaties and execu
tive agreements, are the means
by which national sovereignty
will gradually be lost and inter
preted into world government,
McAtee said.
McAtee sees as especially dan
gerous the UN conventions on
genocide and human rights, nei
ther of which has been ratified
as yet by the United States.
The former would grant extra
dition of U.S. citizens to be tried
on foreign soil, for a crime- that
does not even exist in America,
McAtee said. There would also
be no trial by jury.
The human rights convention
would restrict freedoms to pro
tect public safety, which could
easily lead to peacetime censor
ship, according to McAtee.
No amendment to the constitu
tion is needed to participate in
worl d government, McAtee
warned. And this would include
world legislature, court, police
force and, most important, taxes.
Lewis Mum ford and others
have proposed a world equaliza
tion tax on nations, which would
specifically affeot United States'
wealth and resources.
"The United Nations poses a
threat because it is the source of
so many treaties and conven
tions," McAtee said.
He also attacked the concept of
treaties -and Presidential agree
ments being above the constitu
tion, first developed in Missouri
vs. Holland and upheld by John
Foster Dulles in a 1052 speech.
McAtee had some good words
to say about the UN, however.
He believes that it is perhaps do
ing service in Egypt, even though
it has certainly failed in Hun
gary. and may eventually justify
its existence if kept strictly with
in narrow bounds.
