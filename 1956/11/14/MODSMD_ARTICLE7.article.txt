# New Liquor Plan To Be Discussed By LASSU Tonight
## 
### 
A petition urging the legisla
ture to reduce the legal drinking
age to 19 will be presented to
Legislature tonight at 7:30 in the
ASSU conference room by Men's
Row Representative Skip Renner.
The petition, a revision of one
currently being circulated by
Lloyd Downton, was drawn up by
Renner and a four-man commit
tee appointed by ASSU President
Bob Freelen to study tlie matter.
Along with the petition, Renner
will present a suggested state
ment of liquor policy and a bro
chure on the liquor problem.
President Freelen will present
a plan whereby nominations for
candidates to run in the spring
quarter elections will be filed the
week before Dead Week of winter
quarter. Elections would be held
in the first few weeks of spring
quarter.
"This would give enough time
lapse." said Freelen, "to allow
candidates to plan their cam
paigns. Campaigning would be
easier in the first part of the next
quarter, with less activities going
on."
Freelen explained that his pro
posal would probably need some
special bylaw drafting work and
might not actually bo voted on
until next week.
Other items on the agenda are
bylaw changes concerning Ram's
Head, Publications Board and so
cial regulations.
