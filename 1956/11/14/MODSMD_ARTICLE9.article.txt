# Supreme Court Rules on Bus Desegregation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (UP)
—- The S u pr e m e Court, today
struck down as unconstitutional
city and state laws requiring seg
regation of Negroes and whites
on buses.
In a unanimous order, it af
firmed the decision of a three
judge federal court in Montgom
ery, Ala., June 5 that Montgomery
and Alabama laws requiring bus
segregation are unconstitutional.
The ruling was far more sweep
ing than a high-court action last
April 23 which outlawed bus seg
regation in four Southern states—
but on a technicality without set
tling the constitutional question.
Broad Application
The decision today, by specif
ically "affirming"4he three-judge
court ruling based on constitu
tional grounds, appeared broad
enough to outlaw all city and state
laws requiring segregation on
public transportation within state
borders.
This would not prevent private
ly - run companies from making
their own segregation rules. But
it forbids use of government au
thority to require or enforce seg
regation on government - run or
privately-run buses.
The ruling was a legal victory
tor the Negroes in Montgomery,
whose 11 -month boycott of segre
gated buses is still in effect.
8 Other States Involved
The action also cast a legal
cloud on similar laws in eight
other states — Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee.
Additional litigation may be re
quired in these states, however.
Some Southern states indicated
they will seek new ways to main
tain bus segregation.
C. C. Owen, president of the
Alabama Public Service Commis
sion, said his state will ask public
carriers to "maintain segregation
in order to maintain peace and
order." He predicted the compa
nies will "cooperate."
Florida Attorney General Rich
ard Ervin said the decision does
not strike down Florida's segre
gation laws "until direct suit is
brought attacking our laws and
city ordinances." Such a suit has
boon fled in Miami, where two
Negroes were arrested for refus
ing to take back seats in a bus.
Boycott Leaders Elated
Rev. Martin Luther King, lead
er of the Montgomery bus boy
cott, hailed the Supreme Court de
cision as a "glorious daybreak to
end the long night" of enforced
racial separation in public trans
port. He said Montgomery Ne
groes will hold a mass meeting
tomorrow night and may decide
to end their boycott.
