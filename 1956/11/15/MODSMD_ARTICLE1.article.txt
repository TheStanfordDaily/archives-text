# Hungarian Rebels Sent To Russia
## Freedom Fighters' Destination May Be Siberian Prison Camp 
### 
BUDAPEST, Nov. 14 (UP) â€”
Thousands of Hungarians are be
ing bundled aboard freight cars
and shipped off to Russia in re
taliation for the Hungarian revolt,
apparently authenticated reports
said tonight.
.(Reports in Vienna said the
Hungarian rebel s presumably
were being sent off to concentra
tion camps in Siberia. The Buda
pest radio confirmed that freedom
fighters are being deported.)
Railroad workers estimated
that 16,000 persons from Budapest
alone had been seized and loaded
on trains bound for Russia.
Soviet tanks occupied the big
factories on Csepel Island today,
putting an end to the last vestige
of violent resistance in Budapest,
but angry workers refused to call
off their general strike.
Strikers attending a mass meet
ing at the Csepel Island iron and
steel plant vowed they would not
return to their jobs until Russia
withdraws its troops from Buda
pest, restores ex - Premier Imre
Nagy to power and releases Maj.
Gen. Pal Maleter from Soviet cap
tivity.
"We want trade unions that rep
resent the workers and not a po
litical party," one speaker said.
Although the Russians have
done nothing to alleviate the suf
fering of the Hungarian people,
they have tidied up the wreckage
of their army. One neutral diplo
mat estimated that 180 Russian
tanks were destroyed in Budapest
alone, but few signs of military
damage remained visible today.
