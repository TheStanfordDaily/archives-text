# Pole Leaders Seek Kremlin Concessions
## Gomulka May Ask Non-Interference in Polish Red Policy 
### 
WARSAW, Nov. 14 (UP)
Nine leaders of Poland's "Tito
ist" regime, which yesterday
eased Marshal Konstantin Rokos
sovsky and 38 other high-ranking
Russians out of key Polish army
posts, left by train today for
Moscow to seek new concessions
from the Kremlin.
(The Polish embassy in Mos
cow announced tonight that the
Polish delegation, headed by
Communist Secretary
Oomulka, is expected in the So
viet capital at 12:45 p.m.
(The embassy described the
visit as the first that the Poles
ever have paid to Moscow as
"equal partners" in the "common
wealth of free, independent sov
ereign nations" forecast by the
Russian declaration of Oct. 30.
Russian Promise
(Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin
promised President Eisenhower
last week that Russia would
stand by that declaration despite
the Hungarian revolt.)
Reports of new Soviet troop
movements into Poland touched
off a nation-wide stirring of un
rest unequaled since the over
throw of the old Stalinist regime
as Poland's now leaders left the
country.
Reports circulating here said
some or all of the seven to 10 di
visions that marched in last week
from Lithuania, ostensibly on the
way to East Germany, remained
in Poland to reinforce troop con
cent rat ions along the Russian
border.
Deportations
Considerable indignation also
was caused here by reports of
mass deportations to Central
Russia and Siberia of Jews and
Poles living in the former East
Polish territories taken over by
Russia in 1939.
The question of Russian troop
movements in Poland was said to
be one of the three key issues Go
mulka intends to take up with
Russia's leaders at the Moscow
conference.
The Poles are expected to ask
the Russians:
° Not to interfere in Polish
Communist policy.
• To increase trade with Po
land specifically to sell this
country a million tons of badly
needed Russian wheat.
• Not to move new forces into
Poland or to shift the troops they
have here without obtaining the
consent of the Polish govern
ment.
