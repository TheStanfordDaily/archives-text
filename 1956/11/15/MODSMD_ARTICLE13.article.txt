# Britain, France to Hold Egypt To Terms of Suez Agreement
## Anglo-French to Withdraw on Condition UN Police Force Is Effective in Canal Zone 
### 
(Compiled from United Press)
British and French leaders, in emergency London talks, yesterday
agreed to stand fast against any Egyptian "watering down" of the
agreed UN terms for an Allied withdrawal from the Suez Canal
Zone.
Egypt has demanded that tho police force evacuate the Canal Zone

immediately after Anglo-French
forces pull out. It also reserves
the right to expel UN forces at
any timer
French interim Foreign Minis
ter Albert Gazier flew to London
today and conferred with British
Prime Minister Anthony Eden on
an allied line of policy in the
face of Nasser's tough police
force terms.
British and French sources
complained that the countries at
tached by Nasser to his accept
ance of the UN force gave him
virtual veto power over its com
position, movements and location.
Informed sources said Eden
and Gazier agreed in their secret
talks that Anglo-French with
drawal from Egypt would be con
ditional on the projected UN po
lice force being effective.
The sources said Britain and
France, standing by UN resolu
tions, will continue to insist that
the police force aid the restora
tion of "freedom of navigation"
on the canal. Egypt has been con
testing this point.
In New York, Israeli Foreign
Minister Mrs. Golda Meir said Is
rael would demand unhindered
passage of Israeli ships through
the Suez Canal before withdraw
ing its troops from Egypt. She
also indicated Israel might want
to hold onto the Gaza strip.
Israel was also apprehensive
lest the Egyptians use the UN
force as an excuse to force the
Israelis to retreat to the old 1949
armistice lines.
