# SU, Cal Will Ban Pranks For Big Game
## 
### 
A non - aggression pact which
will restrict dangerous Big Game
pranks is to bo negotiated at a
mooting here tomorrow afternoon
with representatives from the
University of California.
As now scheduled, Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler, ASSU
President Bob Freelen and ASSU
Business Manager Bill Mathewson
will meet with Cal's dean of stu
dents, its student body president,
and its head yell leader to make
the agreement.
However, Dean Winbigler is
hoping to enlarge the meeting to
include other student body repre
sentatives and is awailing approv
al from the California representa
tives to put his idea ( through. If
this is arranged, the meeting will
be in the form of a luncheon dis
cussion.
When finally negotiated, the
non-aggression pact will probably
resemble those which have cov
ered Big Games for the past three
or four years. They outlaw any
pranks which would cause serious
damage to university property
and place restrictions on such
tilings as dropping leaflets from
airplanes.
There will be no censorship of
either rooting sec t i on's card
stunts, however. "We leave that
up to the good sense of the rally
committees," said Mathewson.
The pacts are most effective,
ho said, in informing students that
any violations will be handled by
their university's judicial council
and will be dealt with severely.
Stanford also had a non-aggres
sion pact with USC this year.
