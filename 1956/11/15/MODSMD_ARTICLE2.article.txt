## 
### 
VIENNA. Nov. 14 (UP)—So
viet - backed Hungarian Premier
Janos Kadar fired 12 Stalinists
from top Hungarian Communist
party posts today in a desperate
attempt to win favor of his anti-
Soviet countrymen.
A communique broadcast by
Budapest radio said the Stalinists
were ousted because they "par
ticipated in crimes committed by
Matyas Rakosi," former party
boss who was fired last summer
and who has been blamed by the
party for "blunders" which led to
the current Hungarian revolt.
The purge was the biggest in
Hungary since the Communists
seized power in 1947. It altered
the entire structure of the party
hierarchy and virtually complet
ed "de-Stalinization" of its lead
ers.
Among those ousted were Enro
Gero, former party strongman
who succeeded Rakosi, and for
mer puppet Premier Andras He
gedues.
Kadar had been reported des
perate to come up with a solution
to the anti-Soviet rebellion. Since
he was installed as premier Nov.
4 by the Soviet army which
crushed the violent uprising, he
had failed to end the nationwide
strike, to restore order or to gain
the slightest measure of public
confidence.
Tonight's communique did not
say whether the 12 Stalinists
were ousted from the party. It
said merely that they were dis
missed from top posts on the
central committee and the Polit
buro.
