# A 						Worthy Experiment
## 
### 
In a university the size of Stanford quite often
students will miss the true purpose of educa
tion —to make lliem tliiuk for themselves and
express their ideas in a free exchange of
thoughts.
The big class, with a professor lecturing to a
mass of students, and with multiple-choice type
examinations, offers no opportunity for inti
mate academic contact.
The addition of colloquia to the class sched
ules, under the new General Studies Program,
and the ruling against repeating examinations
are two steps in the right direction. But more
contact is needed—a way in which students and
faculty alike can exchange ideas outside barren
academic walls.
Last spring there was an innovation. A
small group of students was given the chance

to retreat into an isolated setting and hash
out academic and other pertinent problems.
This student hostel program may become a
permanent thing this year. If the next few
hosteJs are successful, future ones will have a
permanent 80-acre site for a permanent student
retreat.
Not only will the hostels allow for a flow of
ideas between students, but they will also allow
for closer contact between student and profes
sor. Another feature of last year's hostels that
we hope will continue is a free mixture of
foreign and American students at the gather
ings, so ideas and philosophies of the different
nations can be discussed.
We heartily recommend that students take
advantage of the hostel programs offered this
year. One week end could be worth a whole
quarter of classes.
