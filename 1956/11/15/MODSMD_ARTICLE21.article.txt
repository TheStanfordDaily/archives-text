# Inch Off the Yardstick

### 
Another INCH was removed from America's ,
yardstick of bigotry Tuesday when the Supreme
Court unanimously ruled that Alabama's racial
segregation laws for public conveyances are
unconstitutional.
The court supported a federal court ruling
in Montgomery, Ala., on June 5 of this year,
and superseded its own earlier ruling which
was based on a legal technicality and affected
only four states.
Following on the heels of llie school desegre
gation ruling by the eourt, this decision affirms
1 hat the judicial branch of the United States
government is bent on having our constitutional
principles become our constitutional practices.
I his action is not, of course, the solution to
the problem. Similar cases will undoubtedly

reach the court, and enforcement problems may
take a long time to solve. But it is a step toward
the erasing of bigotry which is hurting the
American people both internally and through
out the world.
Another equally important aspect of the de
cision is its affirmation of the principle and
practice of government through and hv the
people.
Eleven months ago the Negro population of
Montgomery instigated a boycott, of segregated
buses. For them this decision is a legal and
moral victory proving the rights of citizens to
exercise control over the government. Thus the
yardstick of bigotry in America has been made
a little shorter. The eventual disappearance of
racial discrimination may evolve slowly, but the
Supreme Court has hastened itK coining.
