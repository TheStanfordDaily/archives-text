## Hostel Success Hinges on Student Interest 
### Eve Eimson 
How would it be to share a weekend of dis
cussion with other students and members of the
faculty at a retreat area three and a half miles
back in the hills behind Stanford?
The success of the student hostel program
and the possibility of a permanent hostel being
established at Stanford rests on the question of
whether students here feel the need for some
thing to counterbalance the four-wall, blackboard
approach to education.
"Hostels are organized for the purpose of pro
viding a casual, unrestrained setting for serious
discussion and analysis of current problems
faced by all young people, college students in
particular," said Pete Swan, Cardinal member
and chairman of this year's hostel program.
Swan explains that the secondary purpose be
hind the original idea of planning a gathering
where a small group of students and faculty
could meet informally and trade ideas was to
provide more effective integration between for
eign and American students.
Since this approach to education is in tune
with the continental attitude, foreign students
were drawn to last year's successful hostels.
Here they could meet American students on an
extra-curricular level.
Faculty members participating in the hostels
are not invited to lead discussions, Swan said,
but to contribute their views and wisdom to Ihe
discussion.
Five hostels were organized and carried out
during the first five weeks of last spring quarter,
and an average of 11 persons attended each. This
year two hostels have planned, hut because
of a lack of interest, they were canceled.

George Abe], who pushed the idea originally,
Xeels the hostels that were held last year were
successful in accomplishing their purpose. He
felt they were so successful that he has proposed
a plan for a permanent hostel site near Sears
ville Lake about three miles behind the campus
in an area of 80 acres of heavily forested land.
This land, Abel said, is currently unused ex
cept for botanical studies and riding paths and
would be an excellent setting for a wilderness
retreat.
The retreat - building would have kitchen and
sleeping facilities, be located near a recreational
area and could be used by other student organi
zations also.
The ultimate plan would be to make the site
inaccessible by car, but a path would lead along
San Francisquito Creek to the hostel area along
which students could walk, bike or horseback
ride.
The administration, according to Presidential
Assistant Frederic O. Glover, is keenly interested
in the hostel program.
"Maybe we are even more interested than
most of the students," he said. "The plan as we
know it now has the whole-hearted support of
the President's office and the Dean of Students."
Glover himself is currently exploring the pos
sibility of a permanent site. A site, he said, does
not only involve beauty conducive to creativeness,
but also the realistic necessities of such facilities
as water, electricity and security.
The administration also feels that, while it is
necessary to further explore possible permanent
sites, it is also necessary to explore methodically
long-range student interest.
