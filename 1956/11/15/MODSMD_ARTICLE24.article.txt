Demand U.S. Intervention
Editor, The Daily:
For the past several weeks we have watched
Ihe slow, certain destruction of a whole nation
under the heel of the Russian army.
To most of us this is so far away that we don't
even concern ourselves-with it except in passing.
But these are not Hungarians fighting Russians
. . . these are free men, women and children
fighting the enslavement of Communism. They
are giving up their lives to buy a little liberty.
These dying Hungarian freedom fighters are
on our side. The question is: Are we on their
side? Will we wait until the Communists start
killing Frenchmen or Englishmen, or will we wait
until they start killing Americans? Do you have
any compassion for a nation fighting on our side
against terrible odds?
I say the time has come for us to give these
people some hope that their deaths will not go
for nought. . . . Some of you have given money
and some have joined in demonstrations, and that
is fine, but alone you are only a small voice.
Together we can be heard.
Do not wait, but today wire your Congressman,
Senator,—the White House. Demand immediate
U.S. intervention in Hungary while there is some
hope that we can save a few lives.
Money given to the Red Cross will help bury
the dead and feed the survivors, but what is
needed now is arms, ammunition and the support
of our great nation.
Are you afraid? Why should you be afraid
when 14-year-old boys and girls have stopped
Communist tanks wilh bottles of gasoline?
Will you live up to it—or be remembered in his
tory as the nation of Neros who sat and watched
the free world burn? ,
.John Hanna
Think Twice Over Hungary
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to the situation in Hungary, it
seems that this paper has come out in favor of
aiding and abetting a group of persons who have
attempted to overthrow the established govern
ment through the use of force and violence.
In light of this principle, might we not also
send aid to the North Africans who are trying
to overthrow the French or perhaps give sym
pathy and money to the more democratic forces

of Spain that would like to overthrow General
Franco.
The point is that it is a very short step from
advocating force and violence in Hungary to ad
vocating it anywhere else.
It can be said that revolutions are started by
a minority of the population, and I would ask,
before I began to aid and abet the revolutionary
forces, who this minority is and what and whom
it is representing.
It is one thing to say that "Hungarians" are
rebelling and another thing to state specifically
who these Hungarians are. However, it is not
the right or wrong of the situation that is inter
esting, but the fact that so many people have so
quickly come to accept force and violence as an
acceptable way to get rid of established govern
ment, legitimate, puppet or otherwise.

Emotionalism in Demonstrations
Editor, The Daily:
I felt enough sympathy over the Hungarian
situation to consider attending the demonstration
in San Francisco last week. I rejected the idea,
for although a means of communication, a dem
onstration is not the most effective or intelligent
means.
If each demonstrator had written a letter to
his government representative, or to those of
Hungary, and sent the cost of his transportation
to some relief organization, I should think it
would have been more effective.
I attended the football game. I am not proud
of myself. Perhaps I would be if I had attended
the demonstration. It is possible that demonstra
tions serve better as a means of dissipating one's
feelings of inadequacy in dealing with problems
than they do as a means of conveying solutions.
This is not an attempt to belittle those who
are honestly and justifiably concerned with a
grave problem. I mean only to suggest that the
world is aware of the problem, and it is doubtful
that anyone believes that we are not horrified by
the fate of the Hungarian people.
Supposedly leadership will come from those
who are students in this University today. The
function of leadership is to propose and execute
rational solutions, not to make emotional restate
ments of the problem.

means.
If each demonstrator had written a letter to
his government representative, or to those of
Hungary, and sent the cost of his transportation
to some relief organization, I should think it
would have been more effective.
I attended the football game. I am not proud
of myself. Perhaps I would be if I had attended
the demonstration. It is possible that demonstra
tions serve better as a means of dissipating one's
feelings of inadequacy in dealing with problems
than they do as a means of conveying solutions.
This is not an attempt to belittle those who
are honestly and justifiably concerned with a

that anyone believes that we are not horrified by
the fate of the Hungarian people.

Demand U.S. Intervention
Editor, The Daily:
For the past several weeks we have watched
Ihe slow, certain destruction of a whole nation
under the heel of the Russian army.
To most of us this is so far away that we don't
even concern ourselves-with it except in passing.
But these are not Hungarians fighting Russians
. . . these are free men, women and children
fighting the enslavement of Communism. They
are giving up their lives to buy a little liberty.
These dying Hungarian freedom fighters are
on our side. The question is: Are we on their
side? Will we wait until the Communists start
killing Frenchmen or Englishmen, or will we wait
until they start killing Americans? Do you have
any compassion for a nation fighting on our side
against terrible odds?
I say the time has come for us to give these
people some hope that their deaths will not go
for nought. . . . Some of you have given money
and some have joined in demonstrations, and that
is fine, but alone you are only a small voice.
Together we can be heard.
Do not wait, but today wire your Congressman,
Senator,—the White House. Demand immediate
U.S. intervention in Hungary while there is some
hope that we can save a few lives.
Money given to the Red Cross will help bury
the dead and feed the survivors, but what is
needed now is arms, ammunition and the support
of our great nation.
Are you afraid? Why should you be afraid
when 14-year-old boys and girls have stopped
Communist tanks wilh bottles of gasoline?
Will you live up to it—or be remembered in his
tory as the nation of Neros who sat and watched
the free world burn? ,

Think Twice Over Hungary
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to the situation in Hungary, it
seems that this paper has come out in favor of
aiding and abetting a group of persons who have
attempted to overthrow the established govern
ment through the use of force and violence.
In light of this principle, might we not also
send aid to the North Africans who are trying
to overthrow the French or perhaps give sym
pathy and money to the more democratic forces

of Spain that would like to overthrow General
Franco.
The point is that it is a very short step from
advocating force and violence in Hungary to ad
vocating it anywhere else.
It can be said that revolutions are started by
a minority of the population, and I would ask,
before I began to aid and abet the revolutionary
forces, who this minority is and what and whom
it is representing.
It is one thing to say that "Hungarians" are
rebelling and another thing to state specifically
who these Hungarians are. However, it is not
the right or wrong of the situation that is inter
esting, but the fact that so many people have so
quickly come to accept force and violence as an
acceptable way to get rid of established govern
ment, legitimate, puppet or otherwise.
