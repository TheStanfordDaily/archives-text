# Indians, Huskies Prepare for Clash
## Light Workout Feature Of Stanford Practice; Royal Sings Blues 
### Bill Nichols 
Chuck Taylor holrl a light
workout yesterday in preparation
for the Washington game on Sat
urday, but a note of optimism
showed through. The gridders
spent ir> minutes running at the
goal from only five yards out;
Taylor apparently expects his
team to get dose to the Husky
goal.
Meanwhile, up in Seattle had
luck struck. Darrell Royal said
yesterday that second • string
quarterback [Jill Snider would
miss Saturday's game because of
an injured shoulder.
Snider hurt his shoulder scrim
fnaging last night. He had start
ed four games for the Huskies
while A 1 Ferguson was sidelined.
Ferguson returned to action last
week.
Royal sent his charges through
a rough defensive scrimmage
yesterday despite a steady Seattle
rain.
At Stanford the injury situa
tion was reported as unchanged.
Trainer C'onnie Jarvis reported
all of the wounded were coming
along fine with no complications.
Taylor took exception to writ
ers asking him if his squad would
"bounce back" after two one
point defeats. "They don't need
to bounce back; they're not down.
You can't really say a team is 'up'
or 'down'; how can you tell about
31 individuals?"
Not worried about his team be
ing "down," Taylor is worried
about Washington's potent run
ning attack. "We've put in Ihe
best defense we have; I hope it
works," he added.
"Having Ferguson back helps
them too. They don't throw very
much, but the threat helps their
running." As an afterthought
Taylor remarked glumly, "Ore
gon State didn't throw very much
either, but they sure clicked when
they did."
A 59-yard pass play set up the
Beavers' second touchdown last
Saturday, and the winning mark
er came on a pass from Joe Fran
cis to Fred Negri.


ONF OF A PAIR —Dick Day is one half of what Washington fans
believe to be the finest pair of tackles in the league. The 6-3, 240-lb.
junior is paired with equally fearsome George Struger, a 6-5 235-1 b.
giant. Day, who went to Washington on an academic scholarship,
played first-string guard and middle linebacker last season.

junior is paired with equally fearsome George Struger, a 6-5 235-1 b.
giant. Day, who went to Washington on an academic scholarship,
played first-string guard and middle linebacker last season.
Chuck Taylor holrl a light
workout yesterday in preparation
for the Washington game on Sat
urday, but a note of optimism
showed through. The gridders
spent ir> minutes running at the
goal from only five yards out;
Taylor apparently expects his
team to get dose to the Husky
goal.
Meanwhile, up in Seattle had
luck struck. Darrell Royal said
yesterday that second • string
quarterback [Jill Snider would
miss Saturday's game because of
an injured shoulder.
Snider hurt his shoulder scrim
fnaging last night. He had start
ed four games for the Huskies
while A 1 Ferguson was sidelined.
Ferguson returned to action last
week.
Royal sent his charges through
a rough defensive scrimmage
yesterday despite a steady Seattle
rain.
At Stanford the injury situa
tion was reported as unchanged.
Trainer C'onnie Jarvis reported
all of the wounded were coming
along fine with no complications.
Taylor took exception to writ
ers asking him if his squad would
"bounce back" after two one
point defeats. "They don't need
to bounce back; they're not down.
You can't really say a team is 'up'
or 'down'; how can you tell about
31 individuals?"
Not worried about his team be
ing "down," Taylor is worried
about Washington's potent run
ning attack. "We've put in Ihe
best defense we have; I hope it
works," he added.
"Having Ferguson back helps
them too. They don't throw very
much, but the threat helps their
running." As an afterthought
Taylor remarked glumly, "Ore
gon State didn't throw very much
either, but they sure clicked when
they did."
A 59-yard pass play set up the
Beavers' second touchdown last
Saturday, and the winning mark
er came on a pass from Joe Fran
cis to Fred Negri.


ONF OF A PAIR —Dick Day is one half of what Washington fans
believe to be the finest pair of tackles in the league. The 6-3, 240-lb.
junior is paired with equally fearsome George Struger, a 6-5 235-1 b.
giant. Day, who went to Washington on an academic scholarship,
played first-string guard and middle linebacker last season.
