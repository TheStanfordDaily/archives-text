## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 14 (U?)â€”
John Brodie, the latest in Stan
ford's long line of star quarter
backs, has virtually clinched this
year's major college passing and
total offense honors.
National Collegiate Athletic
Bureau figures show that the 21-
year-old 190 - pound Brodie has
completed 110 of 195 passes for
a wide lead in that department
and also tops the nation in total
offense with 1391 yards gained.
Brodie leads in total yardage de
spite the fact he has gained only
23 yards rushing.
Brodie completed 19 of 31 at
tempts for 223 yards in last Sat
urday's 20-19 loss to Oregon State
and now has gained 1368 yards in
the air. Bob Reinhart of San Jose
State ranks second with 74 com
pletions in 138 tries for 938 yards,
Brodie also apparently has the
total offense crown in his grasp
although a great performance by
Notre Dame's Paul Hornung
could still produce a major chal
lenge. Hornung trails Brodie by
289 yards, with 1102 yards gained
on 164 plays, bul has three games
left to play while Brodie has only
two.
