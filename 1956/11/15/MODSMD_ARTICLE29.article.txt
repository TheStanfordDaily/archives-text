## 
### 
Ernie Cunliffe blazed his way
to a 1:56.8 half-mile clocking as
the Stanford track team held its
second intra-squad meet of the
autumn yesterday at Angell
Field.
Cunliffe's excellent time was
only 2.1 seconds off his all-time
best—a time he recorded in 1955,
running in the CIF Southern Sec
tion finals.
Yesterday, Cunliffe hit the 440
mark in 55.0 and the 660 in
1:25.0. but did not have all of his
usually hard kick in the last 110
yards.
Dean Smith, a freshman, pro
vided the big surprise in the
sprints when he won his heat of
the 100-yard dash in 10.2.
Bob Monzingo, another frosh,
posted an excellent 4:31.4 as he
easily won the mile run. A 1 Sal
cedo was second in 4:36.9, the
best time of his career.
Field events, the high hurdles
and a special 440 will be conduct
ed this afternoon as the meet con
cludes.
