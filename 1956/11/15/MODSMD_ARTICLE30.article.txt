# Quarterback Jackie Douglas Prepping for Top '57 Role
## Santa Monica Are Is Expected to Step In Where Quarterback Brodie Has Trod 
### Dick Barnes 
While most of the quarterback talk has centered about the Indians'
John Brodie this season, another talented passing specialist- Jackie
Douglas has also been performing in top-flight fashion.
Playing in eight of last year's ten games and in all of this season's
encounters, Douglas has shown that he will be the prime candidate

for the number one quarterback
spot in 1957.
Douglas pulled what was one
of the season's most surprising
plays against Southern Califor
nia. With Stanford ahead 21-19
and less than a minute to play,
Douglas was sent in for Brodie.
Everyone in the stands fully
expected a series of line plays to
run out the clock, but Douglas
hfd different ideas. He rolled to
the left, and then flipped a neat
touch d o w n pass to fullback
Chuck Shea, who was all alone.
As a result, the Indians had the
victory by a convincing 27-19
score instead of just a conversion
triumph.
While most of the football team
is sweating out the rugged spring
practice sessions, Douglas is ca
vorting around the tennis courts.
Last year he was the number one
man on the Stanford net team,
and teamed with Jack Frost to
help the Indians make a good
showing at the NCAA champion
ships.
He also reached the semi-finals
of the California State Singles
championships, although he was
not even seeded in the tourna
ment.
Douglas prepped at Santa Mon
ica High, a perennial power in
Southern California high school
football. His senior year, 1953,
was no exception as he helped
lead the Vikings to the CIF title.
In his freshman year at Stan
ford, Douglas hit for over 57 per
cent of his passes while the Pa
pooses lost just one game.
