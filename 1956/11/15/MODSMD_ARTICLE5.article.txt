# Soviets Mass Troops; Tito 'Worried Man'

### 
LONDON, Nov. 14 (UP)â€”Rus
sia is massing armored forces on
(he Yugoslav border and passing
the word to neighboring satellites
that President Tito is to blame for
the upsurge of anti-Soviet senti
ment in eastern Europe, diplomat
ic sources said today.
These sources reported that the
Kremlin campaign has made Tito
"a very worried man."
Moscow's resentment of the
world criticism inspired by its in
tervention in Hungary was re
ported to be focusing on the Yugo
slav leader, who has become the
chief symbol of "independent"
Communism.
Tito's successful defiance of the
Kremlin, climaxed by Communist
Party Chief Nikita Khrushchev's
pilgrimage to Belgrade last year
to woo him back into the Soviet
fold, had won him considerable
respect among his satellite neigh
bors and Communist parties out
side the Iron Curtain.
Diplomatic observers r e p or t,
however, that Russian suppres
sion of the Hungarian revolt and
the tightening of the Kremlin's
grip on most other satellites has I
produced some serious second J
thoughts in eastern Europe.
Officially, Russia blames its i
troubles in Hungary on "imperial
ist forces," but a Moscow-spon
sored whispering campaign fn sat
ellite Europe is saying that the
"subversive effect" of Tito's "du
bious political conceptions" is at
least equally responsible.
