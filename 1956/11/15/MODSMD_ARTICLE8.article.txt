## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UP)
—President Eisenhower said to
day that Russia's bloody suppres
sion of the freedom revolt in Hun
gary flouted every concept of
"right and justice in the world."
He assured his news conference
i that this country is doing "every
thing possible" to help the Hun
garian patriots both through the
United Nations and by rushing
relief supplies.
But he made it emphatically
clear that the United States has
no intention of sending troops to
support the rebels, as some Hun
garian freedom fighters have urg
ed. He denied this country has
ever advocated a revolt which had
no chance to win.
Eisenhower's denunciation of
Russia's role in the revolt came
amid these other developments:
• The State Department said it
is giving "urgent consideration"
to reports that Russia is deport
ing Hungarian rebels to the So
viet Union. Asked if there is any
U.S. reaction to the deportations,
department spokesman Lincoln
! White said. "Of course there is
| reaction revulsion."
• A masked, unidentified stu
dent leader of the Hungarian re
volt told the Senate Internal Se
jcurity subcommittee that Soviet
(occupation troops were "on the
I side of the rebels" at the start of
I the revolt ami at first refused to
I fire upon them.
• The Army began preparing
barracks at Camp Kilmer, N.J.,
for 5000 Hungarian refugees ex
pected within 30 days. The White
House said some may arrive by
the end of next week. Many may
be sent directly to American
homes.
