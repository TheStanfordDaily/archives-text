# LASSU Drops Liquor Issue Permanently
## Renner's Proposal to Lower Drinking Age Opposed by Majority 
### Dave Scott Associate Editor 
Legislature dropped the liquor |
problem for good last night.
It voted down, with just four |
dissenting votes, Skip Renner's !
proposal that Legislature approve '
sending of recommendatory let- i
tors and petitions to lower the 1
drinking age to 19 to other
schools.
It ended the matter completely
by passing by voice vote Vice-
President Sue Coshow's motion
that Legislature "drop the entire
matter, as not enough students
really care."
Renner's (Men's Row represent
ative) included a state stu
dent organization to try to raise
lobby support to influence state
legislature members to lower the
drinking ago.
Shaky Support
He admitted to Legislature
members that support for lower
ing the age was shaky on the
campus and he would set up the
state organization before petition
ing the Stanford campus.
He reported a straw vote of 450
campus students: 77 per cent for
lowering the age, 13 per cent "ve
hemently against" and 10 per cent
with no interest.
Steve Tallent, assistant to Presi
dent Sterling, opposed the plan,
stating: "It is not proper action
for Legislature to undertake. In
the long term it would be com
mitting itself to a program which
would die a slow and agonizing
death."
Renner replied, "I agree that it
would die this death, but we know
the law is wrong and we have a
moral obligation to change it."
LASSU President Bob Freelen
supported Tallent and concluded
the argument against the plan by
saying: "A campaign of this na
ture is next to impossible to carry
on at college campuses. The two
year period between state elec
tions and the quick turnover on
campuses would make it most dif
ficult."
Passed Election Plan
Legislature also passed unani
mously Freelen's plan to move
the time for nominations for
ASSU spring election candidates
to the week before Dead Week of
winter quarter.
In asking for the moving up of
the nomination time and for hold
ing elections in the first week of
spring quarter, Freelen and Tal
lent gave as their reasons:
• Time over vacation to plan
campaigns.
• More time for campaigning
and student interest earlier in the
quarter.
• Easier and quicker turnover
of newly elected officers and more
time for tryouts for positions for
the coming school year.
