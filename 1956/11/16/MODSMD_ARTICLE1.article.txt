# Beleaguered Cards Meet UW Gridmen
## Each Club Out to End Losing Skein in Game Seen as Offensive Tilt 
### Bill Nichols 
Fighting to go into the P»ip
Game next week with a record
over ..100, Stanford's beleaguered
footballers tangle with the Uni
versity of Washington at 2 p.m.
tomorrow in Stanford Stadium.
Both teams are anxious to end
losing streaks. The Cards have
taken it on the nose for two suc
cessive weekends now, while the
Husky gridders have dropped
four in a row after an auspicious
start. Stanford is 4-1 on the sea
son at present.
The game shanes up as an of
fensive battle all the way. UW
has a potent running attack and
just enough passing to keep the
defense honest, and Stanford will
have John Brodie at the helm.
Defense Weak
The Husky defense isn't too
sharp, though. One hundred six
ty-seven points have been scored
against the Purple and Gold in
eight games for an average of
over 20 digits, and there is no rea
son to assume Stanford will score
less than this.
Stanford's problem then be
comes one of holding Washing
ton's runners in check. Washing
ton is second in rushing offense
with 263.6 yards a game, a scant
10 yards less than USC.
Aside from their running
backs, Washington boasts two top
linemen in 235 - pound George
Strugar and 240-pound Dick Day
at the tackles. After these the
quality falls off, especially at
guards and center.
Last in Passing
Washington, presently last in
the PCC in passing, gets a boost
here with the return of quarter
back A 1 Ferguson, a 1954 JC All-
American. Ferguson will throw
to Corky Lewis and Bruce Clar
idge.
Dean Derby, Mike McCluskey
and Jim Jones round out the
backfield. The potency of this
outfit is evidenced by the fact
that Luther Carr, 185-pound soph,
and Credell Green are kept on the
bench.
To counter these points Stan
ford can cal upon Brodie, the na
tion's leading passer and total of
fense man, and a running attack
which has averaged 126.8 yards
a game.
Brodie has an outside chance to
set a new PCC total offense rec
ord this season as he needs 416
yards in Stanford's two remain
ing games to tie Don Heinrich,
who set the mark of 1807 yards
in 1950.
Brodie also needs 27 completed
psases to tie Heinrich's record of
137 set in 1952.
Rose Bowl hopes gone, Stan
ford needs victories this week and
next week to cap the season with
a happy note. Washington has
also' run into tough luck in its
last few games. The Huskies won
three of their first four games, j
losing only to Minnesota, and i
beating Illinois, but have lost to !
USC, California, Oregon State
and UCLA on successive week
ends.
Last week's game marked the
second time in two years that UW
has lost freak games to UCLA.
In 1955 Washington deliberately
gave UCLA a safety with less
than three minutes to play only
to have the Bruins kick a 25-yard
field goal to win, 19-17.
This year Dick McVeigh's kick
from the Husky end zone hit one
of his blockers and UCLA recov
ered on the two, setting up the
winning score in a 13-9 game.
If Stanford has any luck at
holding Washington's runners, it
will emerge triumphant. The
oddsmakers feel it will, for they I
will give 10 points on the Hus
kies.
The game will be televised over
station KRON, channel 4, begin
ning at 1:45 p.m.

Rose Bowl hopes gone, Stan
ford needs victories this week and
next week to cap the season with
a happy note. Washington has
also' run into tough luck in its
last few games. The Huskies won
three of their first four games, j
losing only to Minnesota, and i
beating Illinois, but have lost to !
USC, California, Oregon State
and UCLA on successive week
ends.
Last week's game marked the
second time in two years that UW
has lost freak games to UCLA.
In 1955 Washington deliberately
gave UCLA a safety with less
than three minutes to play only
to have the Bruins kick a 25-yard
field goal to win, 19-17.
This year Dick McVeigh's kick
from the Husky end zone hit one
of his blockers and UCLA recov
ered on the two, setting up the
winning score in a 13-9 game.
If Stanford has any luck at
holding Washington's runners, it
will emerge triumphant. The
oddsmakers feel it will, for they I
will give 10 points on the Hus
kies.
The game will be televised over
station KRON, channel 4, begin

Fighting to go into the P»ip
Game next week with a record
over ..100, Stanford's beleaguered
footballers tangle with the Uni
versity of Washington at 2 p.m.
tomorrow in Stanford Stadium.
Both teams are anxious to end
losing streaks. The Cards have
taken it on the nose for two suc
cessive weekends now, while the
Husky gridders have dropped
four in a row after an auspicious
start. Stanford is 4-1 on the sea
son at present.
The game shanes up as an of
fensive battle all the way. UW
has a potent running attack and
just enough passing to keep the
defense honest, and Stanford will
have John Brodie at the helm.
Defense Weak
The Husky defense isn't too
sharp, though. One hundred six
ty-seven points have been scored
against the Purple and Gold in
eight games for an average of
over 20 digits, and there is no rea
son to assume Stanford will score
less than this.
Stanford's problem then be
comes one of holding Washing
ton's runners in check. Washing
ton is second in rushing offense
with 263.6 yards a game, a scant
10 yards less than USC.
Aside from their running
backs, Washington boasts two top
linemen in 235 - pound George
Strugar and 240-pound Dick Day
at the tackles. After these the
quality falls off, especially at
guards and center.
Last in Passing
Washington, presently last in
the PCC in passing, gets a boost
here with the return of quarter
back A 1 Ferguson, a 1954 JC All-
American. Ferguson will throw
to Corky Lewis and Bruce Clar
idge.
Dean Derby, Mike McCluskey
and Jim Jones round out the
backfield. The potency of this
outfit is evidenced by the fact
that Luther Carr, 185-pound soph,
and Credell Green are kept on the
bench.
To counter these points Stan
ford can cal upon Brodie, the na
tion's leading passer and total of
fense man, and a running attack
which has averaged 126.8 yards
a game.
Brodie has an outside chance to
set a new PCC total offense rec
ord this season as he needs 416
yards in Stanford's two remain
ing games to tie Don Heinrich,
who set the mark of 1807 yards
in 1950.
Brodie also needs 27 completed
psases to tie Heinrich's record of
137 set in 1952.
