# Beleaguered Cards Meet UW Gridmen
## Each Club Out to End Losing Skein in Game Seen as Offensive Tilt 
### Bill Nichols 
Fighting to go into the P»ip
Game next week with a record
over ..100, Stanford's beleaguered
footballers tangle with the Uni
versity of Washington at 2 p.m.
tomorrow in Stanford Stadium.
Both teams are anxious to end
losing streaks. The Cards have
taken it on the nose for two suc
cessive weekends now, while the
Husky gridders have dropped
four in a row after an auspicious
start. Stanford is 4-1 on the sea
son at present.
The game shanes up as an of
fensive battle all the way. UW
has a potent running attack and
just enough passing to keep the
defense honest, and Stanford will
have John Brodie at the helm.
Defense Weak
The Husky defense isn't too
sharp, though. One hundred six
ty-seven points have been scored
against the Purple and Gold in
eight games for an average of
over 20 digits, and there is no rea
son to assume Stanford will score
less than this.
Stanford's problem then be
comes one of holding Washing
ton's runners in check. Washing
ton is second in rushing offense
with 263.6 yards a game, a scant
10 yards less than USC.
Aside from their running
backs, Washington boasts two top
linemen in 235 - pound George
Strugar and 240-pound Dick Day
at the tackles. After these the
quality falls off, especially at
guards and center.
Last in Passing
Washington, presently last in
the PCC in passing, gets a boost
here with the return of quarter
back A 1 Ferguson, a 1954 JC All-
American. Ferguson will throw
to Corky Lewis and Bruce Clar
idge.
Dean Derby, Mike McCluskey
and Jim Jones round out the
backfield. The potency of this
outfit is evidenced by the fact
that Luther Carr, 185-pound soph,
and Credell Green are kept on the
bench.
To counter these points Stan
ford can cal upon Brodie, the na
tion's leading passer and total of
fense man, and a running attack
which has averaged 126.8 yards
a game.
Brodie has an outside chance to
set a new PCC total offense rec
ord this season as he needs 416
yards in Stanford's two remain
ing games to tie Don Heinrich,
who set the mark of 1807 yards
in 1950.
Brodie also needs 27 completed
