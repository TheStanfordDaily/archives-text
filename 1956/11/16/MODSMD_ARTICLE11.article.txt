## British Diplomat Backs Up England's Action in Egypt 
### Barbara Bachman 
Stanford's generally-apparent apathy was a non-existent entity
yesterday afternoon when 200 students turned out for British Consul
Sir Robert Hadovv's address on "Why Britain and France Fought
Alone."
Nor was this audience of the passive variety, for throughout the

talk comments, questions and ex-1
cited exclamations continually in
terrupted Hadow.
Egyptian. African. British and
American studonts/>bviously dem
onstrated through their opinions
and reactions the very sentiments
of the nations and their involve
ments in the current Suez: crisis.
Hadow began by giving a sum
mary of events between Israel,
Egypt and Britain leading up to j
the present time. In 1918 Britain's j
mandate in Israel ended and the 11
independent "state of Israel was j
created.
Egypt Refuses'
Even then Egypt gave warning
of her future intentions by refus
ing to recognize Israel's new sta
tus, by blocking her ports and
preventing her ships from passing
through the Suez Canal.
In 1951 the United Nations de
manded an end to these block
ades; again in 1934 the same de
mand was made, neither of which
were obeyed. Hadow continued by
pointing out that at both times
when the order was made Russia,
opposed the plan.
The same uneasy situation con
tinued, along with many border
raids, until April of this year,
when a "cease-fire was agreed!
upon by both sides." But Egyp
tian Premier Abde] Oamal Nasser
said "a cease-fire is not a reason
for ending a slate of war." He
therefore continued to blockade
Israeli ships and to ignore her in
dependent position. At one time
he said, "We shall grind Israel be
neath our heels."
Aggressor?
The UN suspected Egypt of
having aggressive ideas when she |
began exporting her only major
product, cotton, in a serious ex
change for arms. Then when Is
rael launched the unexpected ag
gression into Egypt the UN was
placed in a very perplexing situa
tion, he explained.
"Oil is the secret of the whole
of his [Nasser's] ambition," Sir
Robert said. Without oil the whole
country would cease to function.
He reminded the audience that
this was actually the cause of the |
whole Suez crisis but, in the light
of succeeding events, has been
nearly forgotten.
Oil Vital
Also from the British side, i
Hadow admitted that "without oil
we of Europe are a doomed na
tion." With the whole world in- j
terested in this vital product, and
with the Suez Canal the main
means of economic transportation,
anything limiting access would be
extremely serious.
"In the back of all this is Mos- i
cow." he said. "They have as their
ultimate and ulterior object this
great country |IJ.S.|. If Moscow
can cut off the products of Africa j
and Asia from the U.S., this nation ;
will be starved to death.
"We [Britain] are loyal mem- j
hers of the UN, but our life blood '
depends on international running \
of the Suez Canal - and that we
must have. If the canal passes to
Egypt we twlicve the free world
is doomed.

Alone."
Nor was this audience of the passive variety, for throughout the

talk comments, questions and ex-1
cited exclamations continually in
terrupted Hadow.
Egyptian. African. British and
American studonts/>bviously dem
onstrated through their opinions
and reactions the very sentiments
of the nations and their involve
ments in the current Suez: crisis.
Hadow began by giving a sum
mary of events between Israel,
Egypt and Britain leading up to j
the present time. In 1918 Britain's j
mandate in Israel ended and the 11
independent "state of Israel was j
created.
Egypt Refuses'
Even then Egypt gave warning
of her future intentions by refus
ing to recognize Israel's new sta
tus, by blocking her ports and
preventing her ships from passing
through the Suez Canal.
In 1951 the United Nations de
manded an end to these block
ades; again in 1934 the same de
mand was made, neither of which
were obeyed. Hadow continued by
pointing out that at both times
when the order was made Russia,
opposed the plan.
The same uneasy situation con
tinued, along with many border
raids, until April of this year,
when a "cease-fire was agreed!
upon by both sides." But Egyp
tian Premier Abde] Oamal Nasser
said "a cease-fire is not a reason
for ending a slate of war." He
therefore continued to blockade
Israeli ships and to ignore her in
dependent position. At one time
he said, "We shall grind Israel be
neath our heels."
Aggressor?
The UN suspected Egypt of
having aggressive ideas when she |
began exporting her only major
product, cotton, in a serious ex
change for arms. Then when Is
rael launched the unexpected ag
gression into Egypt the UN was
placed in a very perplexing situa
tion, he explained.
"Oil is the secret of the whole
of his [Nasser's] ambition," Sir
Robert said. Without oil the whole
country would cease to function.
He reminded the audience that
this was actually the cause of the |
whole Suez crisis but, in the light
of succeeding events, has been
nearly forgotten.
Oil Vital
Also from the British side, i
Hadow admitted that "without oil
we of Europe are a doomed na
tion." With the whole world in- j
terested in this vital product, and
with the Suez Canal the main
means of economic transportation,
anything limiting access would be
extremely serious.
"In the back of all this is Mos- i
cow." he said. "They have as their
ultimate and ulterior object this
great country |IJ.S.|. If Moscow
can cut off the products of Africa j
and Asia from the U.S., this nation ;
will be starved to death.
"We [Britain] are loyal mem- j
hers of the UN, but our life blood '
depends on international running \
of the Suez Canal - and that we
must have. If the canal passes to
Egypt we twlicve the free world
is doomed.
