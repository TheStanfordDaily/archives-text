### 
BELGRADE, Nov. 15 (UP) â€”
President Tito has told Yugoslav
Communists that the Stalinist "old
guard" in Russia and satellite Eu
rope were to blame for the Hun
garian revolt.
Tito, addressing a party meet
ing, said Russia's leaders had ig
nored his warning that other coun
tries in the Soviet orbit would
follow Yugoslavia's lead in seek
ing independence unless Stalinism
was completely liquidated.
He said it was ridiculous to
speak of "counter-revolution" in
Hungary, where "a large part of
the working class and progressive
people took arms in hand to fight
against Soviet armed forces."
The Yugoslav President also
dismissed efforts by "persons who
were trying to nully Yugoslavia"
to blame his regime for the recent
upsurge of demands for independ
ence in Poland and Hungary.
"This perfidious tendency comes
from hardened Stalinist elements
in various | Communist J parties
who succeeded in keeping their
positions and would like to recon
solidate their rule and impose Sta
linist tendencies on their own and
other nations," he said.
Tito spoke Sunday al a regional
Communist meeting in the pro
vincial town of Pula. His speech
was not made public until today.
Meanwhile, Poland's top leaders
arrived in Moscow today arid
started negotiations expected to
guarantee Poland ;i "free and
equal" place in a new-style "com
monwealth of Communist na
tions."
The Polish delegation was head
ed by Communist Secretary Wla
dyslaw Gomulka, who returned to
power- only last pionlh after serv
ing a prison term for - "Titoist"
activity.
With Gomulka were Premier
Josef Cyrankiewicz and six other
top officials of the Polish govern
ment.
