# Britain, France Using American Arms in Egypt
## Defense Department Says Equipment Use Violates Agreements 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (UP)
The United States has accused
Britain and France of violating
agreements with this country by
using American arms aid equip
ment in their attack on Egypt, it
was disclosed today.
However, there is no apparent
U.S. intention of doing much more
than protesting. The government,
would be extremely reluctant to
halt military shipments to its two
allies, because of the importance
it puts on continued build-up of
the forces of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
It was officially indicated the
whole matter may be forgotten if
the Suez cease-fire sticks and no
further violations occur.
"Made Representations"
A Defense Department spokes
man told the United Press that
the government "has made repre
sentatfons to the British and
French concerning their violation
of bilateral agreements concern
ing military equipment destined
for the defense of the North At
lantic Treaty area."
The statement, approved in ad
vance by Assistant Defense Secre
tary Gordon Gray, said this coun
try "has been aware . . . that U.S.
equipment has been diverted to
the support of operations in the
Suez area."
This is the first official U.S.
charge that Britain and France
have violated their arms aid agree
ments, although it became known
early in the fighting from press
reports that the two countries
were using American equipment.
The Defense Department at the
time took a noncommittal stand.
No Denials
Britain and France have nol do
nied the charges. In fact Britain
officially admitted use of some
American weapons in the Egyp
tian invasion, saying it would
have been impossible to sort out
U.S. equipment used by the Royal
Air Force in the assault on Egypt
The Defense Department said
that, apart from "representations"
already made, further action by
this country "will be a matter of
future consideration."
The department in its statement
noted that the United States re
minded Britain and France Nov. .'{
that U.S. arms aid was to be used
only for NATO purposes and call
ed for "strict observance" of this
provision.
The government at that time
also reminded other nations in
volved in the Mideast conflict that
aims furnished by the United
States were "for defense purposes
only,"
