"Let's drop the entire matter, as not enough
students really care."
With these words expressed at Wednesday
night's Legislature meeting, the idea of a stu
dent protest against the present ,liquor law
landed Hquarely and irreconcilably on the junk
heap.
True, any attempt to conduct a state-wide
campaign without appreciable hacking at this
university and extensive, well laid planning
would backfire and hurt the cause more than
il would help it.
True, the law would be difficult to change,
and emotional fire over the issue has died down.
True, there are other issues of greater im
portance.
Lots of things arc true; there are two sides
to every issue. This is the argument that is
always brought up when a &roup wants to avoid

taking action. They say that youth is the ago
lor protest, the ape when odds are not consid
ered and individuals are willing to risk hatting
their heads against a wall for a cause. Tint not
so now, not on this campus anyway.
Never was there anything more than a straw
vote taken, this vote indicating that many stu
dents on campus did seek a change in the law.
We should like to have seen either Legislature,
as the representative hody of the students, or
Ihp student hody as a whole express its<*lf on
the fundamental issue of whether the legal
drinking age should he lowered.
-
By such artful dodging that was evinced at
Wednesday night's meeting, the present liquor
law stands and will remain a prime of legal
immorality. It will he openly and willfully
violated with nary a protest from those whom
it affects most directlv.
