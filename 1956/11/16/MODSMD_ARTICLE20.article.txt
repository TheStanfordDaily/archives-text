It has long been a valid complaint against the
timing of ASSU spring elections that il is not
conducive to a stimulated interest in campaign
ing and running for student posts.
Heretofore nominations were held early in
spring quarter, and the period for campaigning
and primary and final elections extended well
into the middle of the quarter, conflicting with
midterms and making it more difficult for stu
dent groups who, because of the lal<> date of
ASSU elections, were forced to hold trvonts
near the end of the quarter.
Legislature voted Wednesday night to move
spring quarter nominations up to the weok pre
ceding dead week winter quarter, iherebv giv

ing nominees time over spring vacation to plan
more intelligent, extensive campaigns and end
ing i lie past conflict between midterm examina
tions and the climax of the election campaign.
Legislature members have all gone through
the process of campaigning and are well aware
of llie necessity for greater preparations in cam
paigning which help them and in turn serve
the purpose of acquainting students with their
governmental representatives and the functions
they fill.
Although far from dissolving all the prob
lems involved in engendering greater interest
and participation in student government, the
step taken by Legislature this week was a slep
in ihe right direction.
