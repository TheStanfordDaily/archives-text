Propaganda in Pictures
Editor, The Daily:
The photograph of dead children in the streets
of Port Said that you printed in your issue of last
Tuesday arouses indignation. Nobody can keep
cold-blooded when looking at the bodies of those
innocent children.
It shows the Anglo-Freneh intervention in the
Suez Canal under a barbarian aspect which re
minds us of Hungary. It looks like a crime
against mankind.
If this is to be considered as a crime, how
ever, I would like to point out that the United
States also is guilty. During World War 11,
American raids over France killed an awful lot
of innocent children. Photographs like the one
you printed were used by German propaganda
to show what a barbarian, bloodthirsty nation
the United States was.
Such propaganda is unfair and I am aston

ished it got printed in The Daily. The American
air force took every possible precaution to mini
mize civilian casualties. So did the Anglo-French
in Egypt. It is unfortunately impossible to hit
military targets without also killing some civil
ians.
1 have great respect for your efforts to be ob
jective. This is why I could hardly believe it
when I saw this slaughter picture in The Daily
Tuesday. It appeals to the emotional possibilities
of Stanford students to have them condemn the
Anglo-French action in Suez. '
You could have achieved exactly the opposite
result by printing the pictures of equally inno
cent victims of fedayeen raids in Israel or in
Algeria where Egyptian-trained men have been
fiercely killing and mutilating civilians for years.
So I feel that by printing that picture of dead
children in the streets of Port Said, for the first
time you chose propaganda instead of objectivity
as an aim.
