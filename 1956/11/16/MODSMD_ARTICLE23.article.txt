# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Is There a New Republicanism Appearing? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
President Eisenhower has claimed that his
overwhelming victory over his Democratic op
ponent was caused by the American people's
belief in "new Republicanism."
•' The term in itself implies tliat there was such
;j tiling as "old Republicanism." If so. what was
that old Republicanism?
■,«
The Republican party was formed in 1854.
The cement which held the numerous small
groups together in one party was the issue of
ant i-slavery.
Lincoln himself constantly referred to the
common man, always indicating that he himself
one of the common men. In a letter he
wrote in 1859 Lincoln said,.". . . Republicans,
on the contrary, arc for both the man and the
dollar,, but in case of conflict the man before
the dollar."
' The (-ivi 1 War, which was fought under Lin
t'ohi, had two results: The interests of the
nation were considered paramount over the in
terests of any one or any group of states, and
the issue which made the Republican party
was no longer an issue.
Following that war a tremendous population
and economic upsurge began. Developments
were rapid. The nation, which during Lincoln's
time was primarily agricultural, evolved into
an industrial nation of large dimensions. Thus
new problems and new issues were created.
\\ iih these changes in the economy came
changes in the concept of the "common man.""
Where in Lincoln's time the common man was
the individual farmer and small craftsman, the
wage-earner became the base of the economic
pyramid, and thus became the common man.
lint the Republican party no longer contin
ued as the "champion" of the common man.
\\ hen the craftsman became the industrialist,
the Republican party also became the partv of
the industrialist. Thus, the new common man
could find no place in the ranks of the Repub
lic an party.
It was leit to the Democratic party to cham
pion the rights of tin? wage-earners, the new
common men. I his it has done since before the
days of Wilson, a person who believed as much
in the common man and in the humanitarian
rights and freedoms of the "people" as did
I ancoln.
Lincoln's Republican party of craftsmen and
farmers evolved into Hoover's Republican party
ol industrialists and farmers. A party does not
choose its membership; it is what: its member
ship is. I lie head of the party cannot change
its policy or composition—only the member
ship can.
Before new, or modern, Republicanism can
be definitely established, the composition of
the membership of the Republican party will
have to be drastically changed. A careful study
of the registration lists of the Republican party
does not indicate this change.

Is there a New Republicanism appearing on
the American scene?
I lie great popular approval of President
Eisenhower's administration in the 1956 elec
tion has given the (»OP standard-bearer au op
portunity to press forward with his "modern
izing ol the Republican partv.
Loss ol both the Senate and Mouse to Demo
cratic contro| shows there is still a long way
to go in bringing the GOP back to a majority
position in the nation. And il Republicans are
to survive in 1960 they will have to travel that
long route.
The coming four years present the golden
opportunity lor the (,()!' to overcome the psy
chological shortcomings which have plagued
the party since the 1920'5.
I liese shortcomings arc in two categories:
public relations and public policy.
I lie Democrats got the jump in 1932 when
they propagandized effectively bv characteriz
ing the Hoover administration as adverse to
the interests of the depression-suffering people.
I ntil 1952 the drum-thumping themes of "com
mon man and "people's party/' swept the
Democrats into office time and time again.
I lie Republicans countered so ineffectively
that they were reduced to a struggling minority.
I hey (ailed to appeal to the mass of voters;
they failed to properly defend their beliefs
against the propaganda machines.
Not until Dwight Eisenhower captivated peo
ple ol every level did the (JOP public relations
gain momentum. It still must overcome big
obstacles—the false impressions created in the
minds of a generation of voters bv a successful
advertising campaign.
In public policy the Republicans have only
now begun to rebound from the labels foisted
on them by Democrats during the New Deal
and Welfare Stale eras. These labels clothed
the (»()P in garments of reaction and regres
sion rather than those of progress and foresight.
Under the Eisenhower middle-road leader
ship the (,()P is struggling to overcome lhe
psychological disadvantage of the past 25 years.
I he President is molding together those prin
ciples of the Republican party that have been
buried under a pile of perverted electioneering.
In brief, the principles of "New Hepuhlican
ism are not new to those believers in the pre
cepts on which the parly was founded. They
are the same old principles that guided Abra
ham Lincoln and other great Republican lead
ers since but they are now reasserted in a new,
positive way : through the sound programs of
President Eisenhower and those Republicans,
independents and Democrats who support him.
A new Republican party is being molded in
the mind of every American voter by the Eisen
hower administration. It is revitalizing the
concepts of Republicanism that have been dor
mant too long. Il is extinguishing the vestiges
ol a weedlike growth which has been allowed
to represent the (»()P in the minds of the voters
during the past quarter-centurv.
