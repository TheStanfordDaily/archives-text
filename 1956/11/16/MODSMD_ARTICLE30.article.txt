## 
### Dick Lee 
Excellent night club entertain
ment comes to the Peninsula as
the Pagliacci Club in Redwood
City presents "The Pizza Pusher"
this Sunday and next Wednesday.
Written by J. F. Goodwin, this
musical satire was winner of the
Phelan Award for outstanding
night-time entertainment when at
the hungry i last year.
In mock operatic form, the plot
involves the fortunes of a pizza
maker in times when pizza con
sumption has been outlawed. An
Irish cop and a spinster social
worker combine with the Italian
to manufacture enough pizza to
keep the "pizzaphrenics" happy.
But, alas, the business is such
a success that the Italian decides
to run for President. Exploding
pizza ovens, singing pigeons and
double-crosses complicate the ri
diculous plot.
This is not opera, yet the voices
are strong and clear and pleasing.
Carefully written music comple
ments fast action, and the chorus
of eight pizzaphrenics is truly
comic.
