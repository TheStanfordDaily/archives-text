# Coach Jordan Leaves Sunday For Australia to See Olympics
## Track Boss to Witness His Fourth Olympiad; Traveled to Berlin as Competitor in '36 Games 
### Dick Barnes 
Head track and field coach Payton Jordan leaves for Melbourne,
Australia, Sunday as Stanford's official representative to the 1956
Olympic Games. Jordan will travel with the Track and Field News
tour, flying to Australia by Quantas Airlines.
This will be the fourth Olympiad Jordan has witnessed, as he has

missed only one since 1932.
Jordan was an official member
of the Olympic team in 1936,
when the Games were held in
Berlin, Germany. He had been se
lected as an alternate member of
the 400-meter relay team, but did
not get to run in the event.
With the advent of World War
11, the Olympics were not again
held until 1948 and it was not
until 1952 that Jordan again
made the trip to the Games.
To Finland
Four years ago, he went to Hel
sinki, Finland, once again a mem
ber of the official party. This
time, Jordan worked with Bill
Schroeder of Helms Hall in mak
ing an official Olympic Commit
tee report of the Games.
Not until last weekend did Jor
dan know he would be going to
Melbourne. He was telephoned at
home and asked if he could make
arrangements to go to Melbourne
as Stanford's official representa
tive, and of course the answer
was yes.
Jordan's greatest thrill in con
nection with the Olympics was
seeing Bob McMillan of Occiden
tal College come within a hair
of winning the 1500-meter crown
at Helsinki. McMillan was given
the same time as the winner, and
is credited with jointly holding
the Olympic record.
Rapid Rise
At the time, Jordan was coach
ing at Occidental and had a great
deal to do with McMillan's rise
from an unknown to an Olympic
record-holder.
Not far behind McMillan's feat,
in Jordan's eyes, was Horace
Ashenfelter's tremendous upset
victory in the 3000-meter steeple
chase in 1952 as he outsprinted a
heavily favored Russian entrant.
This year, Jordan expects the
United States to make its best
Olympic showing. He figures
United States athletes will win
gold medals in 12 of the 24 track
and field events and may even
bring home 14.
Tentative plans will have Jor
dan returning to the United
States Dec. 5.
