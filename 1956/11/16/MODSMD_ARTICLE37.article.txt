# Braves Hope to Repeat 54-0 Victory Against SJS Jayvee Eleven Tomorrow

Don't sell those rooters' tickets!
You can see Stanford vs. Wash
ington on TV all right. But you'll
miss the Braves' game.
The Braves face a belligerent
bunch of JV's from San Jose State
at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in the
Stanford Stadium preliminary.
Decisive Win
True, the Braves took a decisive
54-0 victory from these Staters
earlier in the season, but San Jose
will be back to regain prestige in
this Santa Clara County rivalry.
The Spartans just don't believe in
past scores.
To prove they are right, they
may bring along a few players
who were not around during the
last encounter. The San Jose var
sity does not play until tomorrow
evening.
The real feature of watching a
Braves game, though, is seeing
the pin-point passing attack di
rected by Bob Nicolet and the run
ning game which features a myr
iad of backs.
Long-Gain Runners
Roy Stephen and Jifn Byrer are
both long-gain runners, while Dick
Mires, Wally Honeywell and John
Cole are consistent.
The Braves are anxious to make
up for their 39-6 loss to Fort Ord

last Saturday. Thref%rucial Stan
ford fumbles and two long touch
down passes over less-experienced
Brave backs spelled the difference
in that one.
There'll be nothing of the sort
this week. With a 4-2-1 record,
Mai Elward's Braves will be solid
favorites against the winless San
Jose squad. However, the Braves
are capable of the same fine of
fensive show.
