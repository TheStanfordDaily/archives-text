# Indian Harriers To Meet Top Men In San Jose Meet
## 
### 
Stanford will tangle with the
best distance runners in northern
California this afternoon at the
San Jose State Invitational cross
country Meet.
With practically every school in
the upper part of the state repre
sented, the winner will be recog
nized as the unofficial northern
California champion.
Ralph Love, Doug Martin, Bob
by Monzingo and Maury Graves
will lead the Indians' seven-man
team in quest of the title.
In last Saturday's meet with
San Jose and Camp Pendleton,
each of these four placed among
the top eight and posted his top
time of the season on the Stanford
four-mile course.
Rodger Beck, Ernie Cunliffe and
Don Richardson will be the other
three Indian representatives in
the meet. This trio each improved
an average of almost 30 seconds
in last week's meet.
