# Russians Continue to Deport Hungarian 'Freedom Fighters'
## Thousands of Young Men Sent to Slave Camps Despite Soviet Promises to End Mass Exiling 
### 
VIENNA. Nov. 15 (UP) —Soviet "slave trains" are still carrying
thousands of young Hungarians to Russia despite official Commu
nist promises that mass deportations would cease, reports from Bu
dapest sai 5 d today.
Assurances that no more "freedom fighters" would be shipped to

Russia were part of the appease
ment "package" Soviet-supported
Premier Janos Kariar offered to
rebellious Hungarian workers to
day in an effort to halt the gen
eral strike in that country.
The General Workers' Council
of Greater Budapest, principal
spokesman for the strikers, de
clared at a meeting today that
Kadar's offers were "unsatisfac
tory."
Tanks Surround
Soviet troops and tanks sur
i rounded the building in Budapest
112 where the Workers' Council met
; today. All persons in the building
I were searched and held under
| guard. The Russians withdrew
| and allowed the meeting to pro
i ceed after a Council leader com
j plained to Kadar.
The Hungarians being deported
■to Russia are almost all young
! men, and it appeared likely that
j they arc wanted for work in So-
I viel slave labor camps.
Student leaders who spoke at
i today's Council meeting said the
| Russians were arresting every
young Hungarian they found on
the streets after the 8 p.m. cur
few. Older persons were ques
tioned but usually not held.
Scaled Train
The s t u d en t s brought with
J them a note, thrown out of a
j sealed train at Cegled, listing the
names of 25 persons out of the
1500 reported on board the train.
"We are in a transport of 1500
on the way to Russia," the note
said. "Please help your Hunga
rian brothers and sisters."
Most of the persons listed came
from Budapest, but there were
some from such provincial towns
as Balaton, Zire and Nagykata.
! The students said they have con
firmed that every person men
tioned in the list had disappeared.
Although no one was certain
how many Hungarians have been
shipped off to Russia, the num
ber- was certain to run into the
thousands.
