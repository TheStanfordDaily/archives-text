# The 						Point After

### Dean Stewart 
"The point after touchdown is the most important point of the
game."
This bitter truth has been echoed down through the football years.
Undoubtedly the first person to reveal this axiom in the form of
words was the first coach to lose a game hy one point.
Stanford had the misfortune to test the wisdom of the above
quotation on not just one game but on the past two Saturdays.

Not only was the value oi the
extra point driven liome to
Stanford supporters but these
same persons are now staunch
defenders of one of the oldest
of all adages: "Nothing hurts
like the truth."
UCLA learned the value of a
single conversion in 1953 when
Stanford edged them 21-20 in one
of Cards' greatest comefrom
behind victories. Only a last-min
ute field goal by USC and a 21-21
Big Game tie enablod the Bruins
to go to the Rose Bowl. The
Bruins needed and got outside
holp to send tnem to the Rose
Bowl. USC aided by edging Stan
ford 23-20 with a last-minute field
goal and Cal came through with
a 21-21 Big Game tie.
No such outside help can be
expected to send Stanford to the
Rose Bowl this coming Jan. 1.
Most fans realize this and accept
the fact because they now have a
better understanding of the ex
tra point.

However, many Bay Area sports writers and so-called grid ex
perts claim Stanford players and fans alike will sit home around
their TV sets this New Year's Day instead of sitting inside the Rose
Bowl because of just one play in the Oregon State game.
These Monday morning quarterbacks blame not so much what
happened on the disputed play but the very calling of the play
itself. To refresh your memory it was early in the fourth quarter
When "the" play was called. Oregon State had just scored but
Stanford was still leading 19-14. The Beavers kicked off and each
team exchanged punts.
With the ball resting on the Cafcl 29-yard line, John Brodie called
a pass play. This, say the experts, was a very bad call. They are
quick to point out that Stanford had a five-point lead which should
have been protected by ball control to eat up the time. They also
claim it is much safer to run with the ball rather than pass.
Of course Oregon State was also aware of Stanford's position and
stacked its defenses to slop a ball-controlling ground attack. In a
battle of minds Brodie hoped to cross up the Beavers' expectations
by trying a long first-down pass.,
All who were at the game remember that Brodie's pass was
intercepted by State's Tom Berry on the Beavers' 49-yard line. Few
can recall that Stanford end Joel Freis was a good two yards past
Berry, tlie only man who might have prevented a Card touchdown
if Brodie's pass had been a few feet higher.
The point of all this rehashing is to emphasize that Brodie had
outguessed the Oregon State defense and had called a six-point play.
There was nothing wrong with the call, only in the play's execution.
Seven plays after Berry's interception Oregon State had scored.
There was still just short of nine minutes left in the final quarter.
If the "experts" who would have had Stanford playing ball control
by running instead of passing had their way, Stanford would either
have scored or punted to the Beavers.
Stanford as everyone knows is a passing team. Passes are the
bread-and-butter. To have expected the Cards to maintain ball
control without using her best/ plays is asking a little too much. If,
then, they were going to have to pass why not have them do it on
first down since statistics have shown that a first-down pass is
more likely to be complete than one thrown on a later play?
All in all it appears that those who are saying that Brodie's
fourth-quarter intcrception-pass-play-call-witli-a 112 ive point lead cost
the Indians a trip to the Rose Bowl are talking nonsense.
