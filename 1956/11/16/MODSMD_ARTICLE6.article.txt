# Med School Opens Campus Cancer Lab
## 
### 
A new cancer chemotherapy
laboratory, which will also serve
as headquarters for the Univer
| sity Pharmacology Department,
has been established in the base
ment of Anatomy Building, Medi
cal School Dean Windsor Cutting
has announced.
This marks the first step to
wa r d consolidation of Medical
School facilities in San Francisco
with the University proper. By
I 10.10 the entire school is expected
to lie housed in a $22,000,000 modi
ral center, to be located adjacent
to the Anatomy Building, which
will go under construction in the
near future.
National Aid
The laboratory was built and
equipped with the aid of $50,000
, from the National Cancer Insti
tute of the U.S. Public Health
Service, plus $10,000 from Univer-
I sity funds. A radioisotope labora
| tory also has been set up in the
newly created space with gifts
totaling $0700 from the Ladies'
Auxiliary of the California De
partment of the Veterans of For
eign Wars.
The new facilities contain ap
proximately 4000 square feet, di
vided into three offices, seven lab
oratories, an animal room and sev
eral small special-purpose rooms.
An additional grant of $68,000
from the National Cancer Insti
| tutc is supporting research for the
first year. Dr. Avram Goldstein,
hear! of the Medical School's Phar
macology Department, will head
the investigations.
Fundamental Research
A group under his direction is
tackling the problem of why can
cel- cells develop resistance to anti
cancer drugs. This work includes
fundamental research in the bio
chemistry of cells to determine
; what changes may be responsible.
Professor Arthur Furst is con
| ducting a second approach to the
problem in a search for new and
(more potent anti - cancer drugs.
; New drugs are being synthesized
; from promising compounds by
chemical manipulation of their
I molecular structure.
