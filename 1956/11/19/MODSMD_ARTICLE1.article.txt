# UPPERCLASS ATTACKS
## Bonfire Raids Made to Expose Ineffectiveness of Frosh Guard 
### 
Four upperclassmen "raided" the freshman bonfire Thursday
night at 11:30 with the intent of showing up the ineffectiveness of
the guard and set off a flurry of rumors about "violent attacks."
In a letter to The Daily and in an interview with a Daily reporter
the four, who call themselves "The Disenchanted," said, "We cannot

believe the gross disorganization
and mass stupidity displayed by
the freshman class while guard
ing the bonfire. . . . Rumor has it
that at least 1.50 Cal saboteurs in
vaded the campus in_an attempt
to destroy prematurely the tradi
tional Stanford bonfire,
"Actually a mere four insignifi
cant uppercjassmen caused the
mass confusion which took place.
The freshman vanguard sat on
their hands dumbfounded while
the four heaped fuel on the fire.
Nobody • told them to leave or
even challenged their actions."
The letter went on to say that
the raiders then went back to
Wilbur shouting "Raid!" Some
two hundred freshmen ran out
and the vandals, even helped
transport some of them back to
Lake Lagunita.
Rumors
The rumors that followed the
raid gave many different stories.
Some said that it was done by 15
Palo Alio high school students in
a well-planned attack which in
cluded stealing the fire truck.
Supposedly they cam# out.of the
woods armed with torches.
One freshman class official
even said s'nme of the raiders
were hospitalized. Another story
said rhembors of the football
team had committed the raid
while yet one more said that it
was done by the Theta Delt fra
ternity. One freshman guard
boasted that his house had "beat
en off the attack."
Sponsors
On Friday evening a sponsor
| fmm the Cedro house of Wilbur
plus two other sponsors also de
termined to test the organization
of the guard.
Wearing Cal rooters' caps and
carrying a can labeled "kerosene"
they walked across Lake Lag,
through the guards huddled
around the small camp files and
j up on top of the pile of wood,
j There they deposited the can and
i left. No one challenged them dur
! ing the entire time.
On Saturday evening one fresh
[ man broadcast a warning to the
j entire hall at 1:30 a.m. over his
hi-fi amplifier saying, "Wake up.
| Wake up. The bonfire needs your
help. We ate being attacked."
' With the exeption of the Thurs
day night warning spread by the
four upperclassmen all have been
false alarms.
Paly High Students
One rumor on Saturday eve
ning said a planned raid by 73
j Palo Alto High School students
had been broken up by the police
i when the group pulled into a gas
station.
In concluding their letter to
| The Daily the four upperclass
i men said, "If these are the 'men'
I In whom we of Stanford place
! our trust, then let the school
barn down, for the freshman
girls could have done a better job.
j We conclude with the hope that
next year's freshman class will
I not be a bunch of panlywaists."

said rhembors of the football
team had committed the raid

Four upperclassmen "raided" the freshman bonfire Thursday
night at 11:30 with the intent of showing up the ineffectiveness of
the guard and set off a flurry of rumors about "violent attacks."
