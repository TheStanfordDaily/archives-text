# Gaieties Has Final Rehearsal Today; Opens Tomorrow
## 
### 
"Every number is a potential
show stopper."
This is the opinion of Director
Walt Brown as Gaieties goes into
its final rehearsal tonight before
the opening tomorrow.
"This show has the potential of
being far and away the best Gaie
ties ever," he added.
Bright, original music, elabo
rate sets and costumes and a
large singing and dancing chorus
are the ingredients put together
by a staff of 12 writers for this
year's show.
The number everyone confiden
tially predicts .will be a "show
stoppef" is "A Pretty Girl Is Like
a Pretty Girl," a take-off on the
gaudy tradition of the Ziegfeld
showgirl. Costumes for this one
act alone are "fantastic" in the
words of Paul Ilarwood, costume
designer.
