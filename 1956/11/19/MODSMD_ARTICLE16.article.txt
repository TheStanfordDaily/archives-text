# Twenty Soviet Divisions Pour Into Hungary
## Troop Trains Cross Border; Strikers May Not Accept Ultimatum 
### 
BUDAPEST, Nov. IS (UP)
The vanguard of 20 Russian in
fantry divisions poured over the
frontier from Russia today to re
inforce the 15 armored divisions
already engaged in crushing the
Hungarian rebellion.
Sources in the puppet regime of
Premier Janos Kadar said troop
trains were crossing the border at
Zahony in a steady stream. They
arrived despite the paralyzing
general strike which workers
promised to continue until Rus
sian troops withdraw.
A government back-to-work ul
timatum for tomorrow morning
was expected to be ignore l by
heavy-industry workers and also
others.
200,000 3len
The government sources quoted
Maj. Gen. K. Grebennyik, Soviet
commander in Budapest, as say
ing 20 Soviet divisions, compris
ing more than 200.000 men, were
en rpute.
Armored forces of between 13
and 15 Russian divisions, with
200,000 men and 4600 tanks, al
ready were in the country.
The new military buildup was
disclosed two weeks to the day
after Soviet armored units attack
ed Budapest and rebel provincial
strongholds and overthrew the
moderate government of Premier
Imre Nagy.
(Nevertheless, reliable reports
reaching Vienna said large areas
still were controlled by partisan
bands.
(Viennese dispatches said work
ers and farmers had pledged to
continue their strike which began
Oct. 23 until Red army forces are
withdrawn and deportation of cap
tured freedom fighters to Sibe
rian slave camps ceases.
30,000 Rebels
(Reports reaching the Austrian
capital from Budapest said as
many as 30,000 rebels had been
shipped to Russia from the Buda
pest area alone. There were au
thenticated reports that partisans
had captured several trains load
ed with deportees and had freed
the prisoners.
(Farmers were refusing to turn
over produce to the Russians and
Hungarian Communists, the di
patches said.)
Sources in Budapest said it wa .
not known whether the Russian
infantry would permanently re
inforce the armored troops ot
eventually would replace them.
Western observers said the
armor probably would be pulled
back since it is cheaper to main
tain foot soldiers than tank force-.,
and infantry would be more eft "•
tive in controlling strikebound
factories.
It appeared likely the Russian
infantry would live off the coun
tryside, thereby lessening the a I
ready scant food supplies avail
able for Hungarians.
