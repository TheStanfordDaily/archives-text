# THIS WEEK ON QUAD
## Big Doings—Big Game 
### Earl Cilley 
Regardless of what you think about how big
Ihe Big Game is going to be, the week and all
1 fiat goes before is still the most excitingitime of
the year at Stanford, and there are a host of
things planned for you to get mixed up in.
Among them are the rally and bonfire Thurs
day, featuring Bill Duke and fireworks; senior
reunion Friday and the big rally Friday night in
the City with alumni cocktail parties, the fist
lights, the band and all. Saturday is The Game,
followed by multiple blasts of varying potency
on both sides of the Bay and as far south as Wat
sonville. And that's how she looks.

The Stanford Folk and Square Dancers want a
plug this week for their Monday evening soirees
at the Women's Gym, which begin at 8. The kids
promise to teach you all about square dancing,
even if you've never seen one do it; so if by some
strange chance you have nothing better to do
with your time this evening, why not drop over?

There are some simply peachy-dandy seminars
this afternoon. Of course, if you're one of the
serious students here, you won't be interested
since this stuff is primarily for the tech school
boys who are majoring in mental-manual train
ing and shop courses, but, for their interest as
conversation pieces, here they are.
All scheduled at either 4 or 4:15 p.m., they are
"Structure of the Stillwater Range, Nevada" and
"Current Research in Mineralogy," a double bill
at Geology Corner, Room 320; "The Control of
Respiration Rate in Chlorella," featured by the
Biology Department and preceded by tea and hot
buttered hydras for the nobs, in Room 430; and
"An Orthogonal Polynomial Equation of State,"
a quantitative unknown which is being given
under the banners of the Department of Chemis
try and Chemical Engineering at the Chem Build
ing, Room 20.

Now, tomorrow afternoon there's an intellec
tual bit scheduled for which you don't have to
carry a slide rule and wear dirty blue jeans to
qualify as being properly dressed. This refers of
< our.se to Professor Pease's masterly analysis of
"The Eisenhower Election," given under the aus
pices of the History Honor Graduate Society at
4:15 in the Women's Clubhouse.

Tomorrow night is Bank Nite at Mem Aud.
Two for the price of one. No, they're not giving
away free dishes, but come at 7:30 and for abso
lutely free you can hear Dwa Mya Sein, historian
holder of the first U Nu Fellowship from the Uni
versity of Rangoon, talk on "Modern Burma."
And, friends, it won't cost you a dime; nossir, not
one solitary penny. '
And then, following a brief amount of skir
mishing back stage, a certain amount of ticket
taking out front and a good deal of stumbling
around and swearing in the pit, Ram's Head will
present the opening night performance of this
year's Big Game Gaieties.
That's at 8:30, and it's going to be one of the
best in recent history, with more good music and
more girls with less on than have been seen on
Quad in many a moon.
The show runs Tuesday through Friday nights,
but if you're going away for Thanksgiving you
might plan to go tomorrow or Wednesday. After
all, like Christmas, Gaieties comes but once a
year.

Wednesday afternoon the junior "class is spon
soring a benefit concert. It'il Jazz in Mem Aud
when Stan Kenton and the boys go to work al
4 p.m. To give a listen will cost you the sum of
$2 per ducat if you're a student ($2.50 if you're
not), but it's for sweet charity and that's not a
bad price at all for Kenton. Think what you have
to pay in the City, by the time the barmaid has
visited you a couple of times.

Thursday, of course, is Thanksgiving Day, and
everybody eats turkey and goes to the rally and
bonfire. Lake Lagunita, 7:30.

Saturday, 2 p.m.: intercollegiate football. Uni
versity of California at Berkeley vs. Stanford Uni
versity. University of California Stadium, Berke
ley. Major athletic event.

Anybody whose eyes will focus and whose hat
will fit by Sunday night will be interested to know
that Danny Kaye and Mai Zetterling (do you sup
pose that's her RFAL name?) will Vie at Mem Aud
at 7:30. Personally, the sack gets the nod, but
in a noisy, noisy movie called "Knock on Wood"
mayhap you will think otherwise. Oh, yeah,
there's two cartooons, too.
