# POLITICAL UNION
## Campus Group Fosters Student Political Views 
### Sally Trapnell 
Stanford's Political Union, which was especially active dur ing this
autumn's campaign, was organized four years ago to create political
awareness among students and to give this awareness an opportunity
lor expression.
Throughout its existence thj Political Union has attempted to

bring on campus men whose
names are well known in the
fields of politics, public speaking
and governmental leadership.
Such speakers as Governor
Goodwin J. Knight, Sen. Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota, Senator
Malone of Nevada and Attorney
General Brown of Califor
nia have appeared here under the
group's auspices.
In addition, Political Union has
fostered student participation in
campus politics through debates
between candidates for ASSU of
fices and between other students
on various political questions such
as this fall's# "Should the Demo
crats Be Returned to Power in
1956?"
Both Sich's Presents!
The group attempts to present
both sides of an issue whenever
possible. Last month they were
able to sponsor speeches by Wil
liam Vatcher and Charles Gubser,
the opposing candidates for Con
gress from Ihe 10th district.
Last year when Sen. William S.
Knowland appeared here under
Political Union auspices during
United Nations Week, his policies
were attacked by a student de
bater who followed him, with no
opportunity for Knowland to
reply.
Since then the program plan
ners have either omitted student
replies to speakers or-included
two student debaters representing
both sides o{ a question.
Monthly Meetings
Meetings of the Political Union
are usually held once a month in
Cubberley Auditorium and gener
ally have a featured speaker or
debaters, followed by floor debate.
Cliff Kimber, president of the Po
litical Union this year, presides
over the meetings.
There are also three caucuses
within .the organization — Inde
pendent, Republican and Demo
cratic. These meet once a month
in Bowman Alumni House.
Any 25 per- cent of the member
ship of Political Union may form
such a caucus, which has its own
meetings and can invite speakers
on any subject 4n which it is par
ticularly interested.
Caucus Speakers
This year the caucuses have
heard Sen. William Jackson of
Washington, C. P. Cotter of the.
Political Science department, who
headed the northern California
group of Eggheads for Eisenhow
er, and San Francisco Attorney
Sylvester M c A t e e , who spoke
against the United Nations.
The Political Union was formed
in 1953 by Wayne Fuller, the first
president. It became a Board of
the ASSU under the ASSU consti
tutional revision of last year, and
a representative now sits in the
ASSU president's advisory cabi
net.
Future Programs
For its future programs Politi
cal Union has contacted newly
elected Senators Bible of Nevada,
Morse of Oregon, Church of Idaho
and Kuchel of California to ad
dress the student body before they
go to Washington for the next
session of Congress.
In January the director of the
Alcoholic Beverages Commission
will address the Political Union on
the state's position and legal as
pects of the 19-year-old drinking
question.

Stanford's Political Union, which was especially active dur ing this
autumn's campaign, was organized four years ago to create political
awareness among students and to give this awareness an opportunity
lor expression.
Throughout its existence thj Political Union has attempted to

bring on campus men whose
names are well known in the
fields of politics, public speaking
and governmental leadership.
Such speakers as Governor
Goodwin J. Knight, Sen. Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota, Senator
Malone of Nevada and Attorney
General Brown of Califor
nia have appeared here under the
group's auspices.
In addition, Political Union has
fostered student participation in
campus politics through debates
between candidates for ASSU of
fices and between other students
on various political questions such
as this fall's# "Should the Demo
crats Be Returned to Power in
1956?"
Both Sich's Presents!
The group attempts to present
both sides of an issue whenever
possible. Last month they were
able to sponsor speeches by Wil
liam Vatcher and Charles Gubser,
the opposing candidates for Con
gress from Ihe 10th district.
Last year when Sen. William S.
Knowland appeared here under
Political Union auspices during
United Nations Week, his policies
were attacked by a student de
bater who followed him, with no
opportunity for Knowland to
reply.
Since then the program plan
ners have either omitted student
replies to speakers or-included
two student debaters representing
both sides o{ a question.
Monthly Meetings
Meetings of the Political Union
are usually held once a month in
Cubberley Auditorium and gener
ally have a featured speaker or
debaters, followed by floor debate.
Cliff Kimber, president of the Po
litical Union this year, presides
over the meetings.
There are also three caucuses
within .the organization — Inde
pendent, Republican and Demo
cratic. These meet once a month
in Bowman Alumni House.
Any 25 per- cent of the member
ship of Political Union may form
such a caucus, which has its own
meetings and can invite speakers
on any subject 4n which it is par
ticularly interested.
Caucus Speakers
This year the caucuses have
heard Sen. William Jackson of
Washington, C. P. Cotter of the.
Political Science department, who
headed the northern California
group of Eggheads for Eisenhow
er, and San Francisco Attorney
Sylvester M c A t e e , who spoke
against the United Nations.
The Political Union was formed
in 1953 by Wayne Fuller, the first
president. It became a Board of
the ASSU under the ASSU consti
tutional revision of last year, and
a representative now sits in the
ASSU president's advisory cabi
net.
