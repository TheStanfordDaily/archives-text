# Scholarships Reach Annual $500,000 Total
## Business Corporation Contributions Provide For Recent Increase 
### 
Giving away $500,000 each year
may sound like a pleasant job.
But Stanford's committee on fi
nancial awards needs all summer
to decide which students they can
assist.
In the past 20 years the under
graduate scholarship fund has
grown from $50,000 to $500,000
but Mrs. Olivia Byler, Financial
Awards Secretary, says this still
isn't nearly enough to go around.
Recently, business corporations
have contributed greatly to the
scholarship fund.
Now one out of 17 entering
freshmen who apply for schol
arships has a chance to receive
one. For other undergraduates
about half of those who apply are
given some help. Approximately
one of 15 applicants for graduate
fellowships receives an award.
First Scholarship
Back in the days when Stan
ford charged no -tuition, Mrs.
Stanford established the first
scholarship in memory of Le
land Stanford Jr. This covered
the cost of books and room and
board for one student.
In 1916 an award committee
was set up to handle, on a com
petitive basis, eight scholarships
totaling $1339.
The basis for awarding scholar
ships has always been personal
qualifications, degree of need and
scholastic excellence. The com
mittee screens all applicants' rec
ords carefully and categorizes
them.
Restrictive Grants
Some scholarships are restric
tive, such as those for students
from a particular area or for chil
dren of war veterans, so there is
little competition for these.
Giants on the graduate level
are given in relation to and by
recommendation of the depart
ment. Grants-in-aid are given all
year long.
Spring and summer are the
peak periods for the scholarship
office, however. Entering fresh
men apply before March 1 for
awards. The deadline for other
students is April 15.
