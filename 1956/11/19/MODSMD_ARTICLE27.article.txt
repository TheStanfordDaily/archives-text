routing Santa Clara 9-2 here on

"For the first time the boys
shbwed they could work togeth
er," said Coach Fred Priddle

Cal improved 100 per cent. I was
n't so sure last week."

scored on a picture goal. The ball
was headed across field into the
nets with Ben Pentsil beautifully
lobbing it over the goalie's head
for Bill Wren to tap in.

post, but managed to get in front
of the ball to send it into the net.
Minutes later Pentsil scored from
a pass by Wren.

put in. Wren scored again on a
breakaway, and Eduardo Mall set
up Pentsil for Stanford's eighth
goal. Mall himself finished the
