## 
### Jack Rannells 
Not until fullback Jim Byrer
had given the Braves a 2S-7 lead
over the San Jose State JV's with
a 69-yard touchdown dash at the
third'quarter terminus did Stan
ford have Saturday's preliminary
in firm grasp.
The Braves eventually won the
contest 42-19, but the State quar
terback had begun to exploit the,
vulnerable area behind tlie
Braves' seven-man line with .jump
passes, and the game was any
thing but in the bag at the time.
Byrer, who led the Stanford
ground gainers with 112 yards on
12 carries, boomed over guard on
a fourth - and - one situation and
shot right through the San Jose
backfield for his score.
The Staters, who had suc
cumbed to the Braves, 54-0, car-!
lier this season, made a much
better contest out of Saturday's
game.
Completing 17 of 25 passes,;
mostly on 10 -12 - yard jump ef
forts, the State JV's gained 238
yards through the air and picked

up another 104 overland. All
three of their touchdowns came
through passes.
Trainer-halfback Hank Roldan
scorer! two touchdowns for the
Braves' cause, but it was alter
nating fullbacks John Cole and
Byrer, and Bob Nicolet, who kept
the Stanford attack rolling.
Cole picked up 51 yards in nine
carries, and Nicolet hit on 13 of
20 pass attempts for 179 yards to
lead the Braves' attack. In total
yardage the Jayvees accrued 45G
yards, 211 running and 245 pass
ing.
Halfback Bob Parks swept
right end for a five-yard Braves
touchdown in the first quarter.
Early in the second quarter Cole
rambled nine yards around end
for the second tally.
After setting it up by tossing a
41-yard pass, Roldan scored his
first touchdown on a one - yard
pass from Jerry Hitchman as the
half ended. Half-time score was
21-0.
San Jose scored on an 11-yard
aerial in the third quarter, and

then Byrer stepped out for his
equalizer.
There was a flurry of scoring
in the final period as San Jose j
tallied on passes of 34 and 14 i
yards to push the score to 28-19. j
Nicolet and Byrer then com- |
bined talents to move the Braves
to â€¢ their fifth counter, coming
after a five-yard pass from Nico
let to end Jim Ukropina. A 21-
yard Nicolet pass to Roldan cap
ped the scoring for the day.
