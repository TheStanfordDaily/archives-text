# Two Upsets in Weekend Play; WSC, Ducks Topple Cal, USC
## 
### 
Saturday was a dayVfor the
| Northwest as Washington, Wash
ington State and Oregon all
I knocked off favored California
I foes to give the PCC's "lower
I echelon" its most successful out
ing on the gridiron in many a
moon.
And the Northwest's own whip
ping boy, Idaho, almost pulled
one of the greatest upsets in his
tory before falling to Rose Bowl
bound Oregon State, 14-10.
Lowe and Durden
Tailback Paul Lowe and wing
j back Earnel Ditrden, two major
! factors in OSC's win over Stan
j ford, combined on a 60-yard pass
! that set up the Beavers' winning
I tally in the last three minutes of
j the game. Lowe went five yards
i for the clincher.
The pesky Vandals thoroughly
outplayed OSC all the way, and
Jerry Kramer's fourth - quarter,
'35-yard field goal looked like Ihe

winning margin until the death
dealing pass.
Oregon downed its second
Southern rival in a row with a
7-0 win over Southern California
on a muddy field in Portland. The
Trojans, suffering their second
loss of the year, were bothered
by the slippery turf and mounted
only one threat.
Cal Loses
WSC scored its first victory
over California since 1941 on Sat
urday by dumping the lowly
Bears, 14-13, in Berkeley. The
youthful Cougars, the nation's
N"- 1 passing team, riddled the
Cal secondary for 12 completions
in 16 attempts, Bob Newman
making 11 of the strikes.
Kirk Wilson passed, ran and,
most of all, punted UCLA to a
13-0 non-conference triumph over
Kansas. The sophomore tailback
scored both Bruin touchdowns in
addition to setting a new PCC
record by averaging 56 yards on
four punts.
