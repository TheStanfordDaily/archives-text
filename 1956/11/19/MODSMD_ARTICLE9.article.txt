# Huskies Down Indians, 34-13; Big Game Next
## 
### Bill Nichols 
All eyes now turn to Berkeley.
The effect of Saturday's unex
pected loss to the Washington
Huskies won't be known until
after the California tussle next
week. To the national football
scene, to the PCC standings, next
Saturday's fracas doesn't mean
too much, but to the two teams,
to the coaches, to the students
and to thousands of alumni, next
Saturday it's the Big Game.
Stanford found a new way to
lose a ball game Saturday: fum
ble. Card backs dropped the hall
five times and each time it was
a white-shirted Husky who fell
on, or grabbed, it. Two fumbles
were directly responsible for
Washington's touchdowns.
Dispirited Team
Stanford's team looked dispir
ited during a first half that saw
Washington outscore them 20-7,
and generally push them around.
John Brodie had one of his better
days, completing 20 for 20, but
aside from Stanford's two scor
ing drives he couldn't seem to
move the team regularly.
Although Brodie's passing
closed the gap to 20-13 early in
the third quarter, the Huskies
came back with a scoring drive
of their own, and then capitalized*
on two breaks to choke off fur
ther Cardinal efforts.
Third Loss
This was S t a n f o r d ' s third
straight loss and their fifth of the
season. The Indians have gone
steadily down hill since their 27-
19 win over USC, and the big
question is: Will the trend con
tinue through next week's Big
Game?
Chuck Taylor is optimistic,
claiming that Saturday's loss
would help the Indian gridders
against the Bears who need a win
over Stanford to avoid their
worst record in 59 years.
Taylor wasn't too disappointed,
although on the scoreboard
things looked bad. The statistics
tend to bear Taylor out. Stanford
out gained the UW team 301 to
350 and generally held its own in
all departments except two.
Five was the Key number for
the Huskies. They tried five
passes, completed five. Stanford
fumbled five times, Washington
recovered all five. All five passes
hurt Stanford.
The first pass covered 16 yards
and was the big move in Wash
ington's second TD drive. The
second covered 40 yards and
moved UW to the Stanford 19
before they ran out of gas.
The fourth was a 38-yarder to
Carr who went into the end zone
with the clincher, pushing the
score to 2713. After that one
Stanford muffed its only two
scoring chances.
First Muff
Early in the fourth quarter
Brodie came in to throw a fourth
down pass from punt formation.
Bob Herring picked off the pass
and returned it 33 yards to.mid
field, from where the Huskies
went on to score again.
Jack Douglas and Chuck Shea
pulled off the day's second long
est gainer, but it ended in disas
ter as three Huskies converged
on Shea at the 25 and jarred the
ball loose. The pass play covered
(it) yards and was equaled only by
a Brodie to Gordy Young to Don
McCumby.
The ending of this play, osten
sibly a pitchout from Brodie to
Young, was also unrehearsed.
McCumby, a UW tackle, grabbed
the ball as it bounced off Young's
chest, and he trundled 73 yards
down the field.
First Time
Young was the only Indian who
had a chance to catch up with
McCumby, but Young's lack of
speed was never more evident.
"It was about the only time I
ever touched a football," McCum
by said gleefully after the game.
The dressing room presented
an incongruous scene. In con
trast to last week when it sound
ed like a tomb, the players were
fairly cheerful this week.
The injury situation is rela
tively good. The only new loss
is lackle John Kidd who hurt a
knee. Paul Wiggin, down for an
a n x i<1 u s lew minutes in the
fourth quarter, suffered only a
muscle cramp.
Gary Van Galder got a knock
on the head, but will be OK.
Feeling is high already for the
Big Game. Dutch Fehring called
the turn nicely when he said, "It's
a new season starting Monday."
On to Big Game!

McCumby, a UW tackle, grabbed
the ball as it bounced off Young's
chest, and he trundled 73 yards
down the field.
First Time
Young was the only Indian who
had a chance to catch up with
McCumby, but Young's lack of
speed was never more evident.
"It was about the only time I
ever touched a football," McCum

fairly cheerful this week.
The injury situation is rela

On to Big Game!

All eyes now turn to Berkeley.
The effect of Saturday's unex
pected loss to the Washington
Huskies won't be known until
after the California tussle next
week. To the national football
scene, to the PCC standings, next
Saturday's fracas doesn't mean
too much, but to the two teams,
to the coaches, to the students
and to thousands of alumni, next
Saturday it's the Big Game.
Stanford found a new way to
lose a ball game Saturday: fum
ble. Card backs dropped the hall
five times and each time it was
a white-shirted Husky who fell
on, or grabbed, it. Two fumbles
were directly responsible for
Washington's touchdowns.
Dispirited Team
Stanford's team looked dispir
ited during a first half that saw
Washington outscore them 20-7,
and generally push them around.
John Brodie had one of his better
days, completing 20 for 20, but
aside from Stanford's two scor
ing drives he couldn't seem to
move the team regularly.
Although Brodie's passing
closed the gap to 20-13 early in
the third quarter, the Huskies
came back with a scoring drive
of their own, and then capitalized*
on two breaks to choke off fur
ther Cardinal efforts.
Third Loss
This was S t a n f o r d ' s third
straight loss and their fifth of the
season. The Indians have gone
steadily down hill since their 27-
19 win over USC, and the big
question is: Will the trend con
tinue through next week's Big
Game?
Chuck Taylor is optimistic,
claiming that Saturday's loss
would help the Indian gridders
against the Bears who need a win
over Stanford to avoid their
worst record in 59 years.
Taylor wasn't too disappointed,
although on the scoreboard
things looked bad. The statistics
tend to bear Taylor out. Stanford
out gained the UW team 301 to
350 and generally held its own in
all departments except two.
Five was the Key number for
the Huskies. They tried five
passes, completed five. Stanford
fumbled five times, Washington
recovered all five. All five passes
hurt Stanford.
The first pass covered 16 yards
and was the big move in Wash
ington's second TD drive. The
second covered 40 yards and
moved UW to the Stanford 19
before they ran out of gas.
The fourth was a 38-yarder to
Carr who went into the end zone
with the clincher, pushing the
score to 2713. After that one
Stanford muffed its only two
scoring chances.
First Muff
Early in the fourth quarter
Brodie came in to throw a fourth
down pass from punt formation.
Bob Herring picked off the pass
and returned it 33 yards to.mid
field, from where the Huskies
went on to score again.
Jack Douglas and Chuck Shea
pulled off the day's second long
est gainer, but it ended in disas
ter as three Huskies converged
on Shea at the 25 and jarred the
ball loose. The pass play covered
(it) yards and was equaled only by
a Brodie to Gordy Young to Don
McCumby.
The ending of this play, osten
sibly a pitchout from Brodie to

Five was the Key number for
the Huskies. They tried five
passes, completed five. Stanford
fumbled five times, Washington
recovered all five. All five passes
hurt Stanford.
The first pass covered 16 yards
and was the big move in Wash
ington's second TD drive. The
second covered 40 yards and
moved UW to the Stanford 19
before they ran out of gas.
The fourth was a 38-yarder to
Carr who went into the end zone
with the clincher, pushing the
score to 2713. After that one
Stanford muffed its only two
scoring chances.
First Muff
Early in the fourth quarter
Brodie came in to throw a fourth
down pass from punt formation.
Bob Herring picked off the pass
and returned it 33 yards to.mid
field, from where the Huskies
went on to score again.
Jack Douglas and Chuck Shea
pulled off the day's second long
est gainer, but it ended in disas
ter as three Huskies converged
on Shea at the 25 and jarred the
ball loose. The pass play covered
(it) yards and was equaled only by
a Brodie to Gordy Young to Don
McCumby.
The ending of this play, osten
sibly a pitchout from Brodie to
Young, was also unrehearsed.
McCumby, a UW tackle, grabbed
the ball as it bounced off Young's
chest, and he trundled 73 yards
down the field.
First Time
Young was the only Indian who
had a chance to catch up with
McCumby, but Young's lack of
speed was never more evident.
"It was about the only time I
ever touched a football," McCum
by said gleefully after the game.
The dressing room presented
an incongruous scene. In con
trast to last week when it sound
ed like a tomb, the players were
fairly cheerful this week.
The injury situation is rela
tively good. The only new loss
is lackle John Kidd who hurt a
knee. Paul Wiggin, down for an
a n x i<1 u s lew minutes in the
fourth quarter, suffered only a
muscle cramp.
Gary Van Galder got a knock
on the head, but will be OK.
Feeling is high already for the
Big Game. Dutch Fehring called
the turn nicely when he said, "It's
a new season starting Monday."
On to Big Game!

All eyes now turn to Berkeley.
The effect of Saturday's unex
pected loss to the Washington
Huskies won't be known until
after the California tussle next
week. To the national football
scene, to the PCC standings, next
Saturday's fracas doesn't mean
too much, but to the two teams,
to the coaches, to the students
and to thousands of alumni, next
Saturday it's the Big Game.
Stanford found a new way to
lose a ball game Saturday: fum
ble. Card backs dropped the hall
five times and each time it was
a white-shirted Husky who fell
on, or grabbed, it. Two fumbles
were directly responsible for
Washington's touchdowns.
Dispirited Team
Stanford's team looked dispir
ited during a first half that saw
Washington outscore them 20-7,
and generally push them around.
John Brodie had one of his better
days, completing 20 for 20, but
aside from Stanford's two scor
ing drives he couldn't seem to
move the team regularly.
Although Brodie's passing
closed the gap to 20-13 early in
the third quarter, the Huskies
came back with a scoring drive
of their own, and then capitalized*
on two breaks to choke off fur
ther Cardinal efforts.
Third Loss
This was S t a n f o r d ' s third
straight loss and their fifth of the
season. The Indians have gone
steadily down hill since their 27-
19 win over USC, and the big
question is: Will the trend con
tinue through next week's Big
Game?
Chuck Taylor is optimistic,
claiming that Saturday's loss
would help the Indian gridders
against the Bears who need a win
over Stanford to avoid their
worst record in 59 years.
Taylor wasn't too disappointed,
although on the scoreboard
things looked bad. The statistics
tend to bear Taylor out. Stanford
out gained the UW team 301 to
350 and generally held its own in
all departments except two.

the Huskies. They tried five
passes, completed five. Stanford
fumbled five times, Washington
