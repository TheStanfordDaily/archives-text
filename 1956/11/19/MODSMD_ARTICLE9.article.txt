# Huskies Down Indians, 34-13; Big Game Next

All eyes now turn to Berkeley.
The effect of Saturday's unex
pected loss to the Washington
Huskies won't be known until
after the California tussle next
week. To the national football
scene, to the PCC standings, next
Saturday's fracas doesn't mean
too much, but to the two teams,
to the coaches, to the students
and to thousands of alumni, next
Saturday it's the Big Game.
Stanford found a new way to
lose a ball game Saturday: fum
ble. Card backs dropped the hall
five times and each time it was
a white-shirted Husky who fell
on, or grabbed, it. Two fumbles
were directly responsible for
Washington's touchdowns.
Dispirited Team
Stanford's team looked dispir
ited during a first half that saw
Washington outscore them 20-7,
and generally push them around.
John Brodie had one of his better
days, completing 20 for 20, but
aside from Stanford's two scor
ing drives he couldn't seem to
move the team regularly.
Although Brodie's passing
closed the gap to 20-13 early in
the third quarter, the Huskies
came back with a scoring drive
of their own, and then capitalized*
on two breaks to choke off fur
ther Cardinal efforts.
Third Loss
This was S t a n f o r d ' s third
straight loss and their fifth of the
season. The Indians have gone
steadily down hill since their 27-
19 win over USC, and the big
question is: Will the trend con
tinue through next week's Big
Game?
Chuck Taylor is optimistic,
claiming that Saturday's loss
would help the Indian gridders
against the Bears who need a win
over Stanford to avoid their
worst record in 59 years.
Taylor wasn't too disappointed,
although on the scoreboard
things looked bad. The statistics
tend to bear Taylor out. Stanford
out gained the UW team 301 to
350 and generally held its own in
all departments except two.
Five was the Key number for
the Huskies. They tried five
passes, completed five. Stanford
