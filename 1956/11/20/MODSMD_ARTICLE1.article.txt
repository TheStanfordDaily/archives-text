# 'Pantywaist' Label Unfair Claim Frosh
## Guards of Bonfire Protest 'Firings' By Other Classes 
### Dave Scott Associate Editor 
Four Cedro freshman officers
and bonfire guards indignantly
told The Daily yesterday that
their class had .not shown itself
to he "pantywaists" in last week
end's bonfire scuffles.
One of the freshmen, Alan Sell
gren, further hotly contended lliat
"the purpose of the guards was to
protect the fire against raids from
Paly High students and Cal peo
ple, ami it is rather disgusting,
that all attacks have come from
upperclassmen inside the cam
pus."
John Cailleau, substantiated by
Sellgren, Bob Campbell and Jim
Pries, gave an eyewitness account
of what actually happened in the
now rumor-filled raids.
Truck Blockade
Cailleau said when he arrived
at ihc fire site at 11:45 Thursday
night he found that an empty
truck had been put diagonally
across the road by instigators of
the plot. The same group, accord
ing to Cailleau, earlier in Ihe eve
ning took the guarding fire en
gine by making use of "a promi
nent student body officer" who
told the freshman guards the
truck had to be taken to the Cor
poration Yard for minor repairs.
Small Pi re Started
Just as the freshman guards at
the gate pushed the truck out of
the way so Cailleau could get by,
a small fire by a pile of wood near
the Boathouse was noticed. The
people guarding the main pile of
wood rushed over to the fire, leav
ing the main pile of wood rela
tively exposed.
"Then," said Cailleau, "a group
of fellows including myself heard
voices and footsteps along the
bank. VVe turned and yelled for
the other fellows over at the fire
to come and help us.
"Then we turned around and
saw five or six figures, with hand
kerchiefs over their faces, slowly
walking up to the fire carrying
burning torches. Then they broke
into a run."
Brief Scuffle
After a brief scuffle, they threw
the torches into part of an old
shack and ran. All four freshmen
are sure the attackers were up
perclassmen. perhaps the "Disen
chanted" ones mentioned in yes
terday's Daily interview.
"Friday night," said Cailleau,
"was dead quiet."
But early Sunday morning
things were hopping.
"About 1:30 a.m.," explained
Cailleau, "about 1.5 or 20 Stanford
upperclassmen walked down off
the Boathouse hill. Their number
included several prominent foot
ball players full of spare energy,
not to mention extra spirits.
"Relatively Quiet"
"Due to their size and the fact
they were relatively quiet, our
men did nothing to stop them.
They did succeed in lighting one
small brush fire, which was quick
ly put out.
"They then let the air out of
one of the tires of the fire engine
and yanked some of our men out
of the cab. In trying to defend
himself in a fist fight, one of our
men, Ray Harrington, had his lip
injured and had to have one stitch
taken."
Cailleau went to Wilbur for
help, bul when he returned, the
raiding group had given up after
lighting one small brush pile, and
left.
The guards later received word
that 75 Palo Alto High School
youths armed with chains were
on their way to the fire sile. but
21 of them were arrested and the
raid was squelched.

now rumor-filled raids.
Truck Blockade
Cailleau said when he arrived
at ihc fire site at 11:45 Thursday
night he found that an empty
truck had been put diagonally
across the road by instigators of
the plot. The same group, accord
ing to Cailleau, earlier in Ihe eve
ning took the guarding fire en
gine by making use of "a promi
nent student body officer" who
told the freshman guards the
truck had to be taken to the Cor
poration Yard for minor repairs.
Small Pi re Started
Just as the freshman guards at
the gate pushed the truck out of
the way so Cailleau could get by,
a small fire by a pile of wood near
the Boathouse was noticed. The
people guarding the main pile of
wood rushed over to the fire, leav
ing the main pile of wood rela
tively exposed.
"Then," said Cailleau, "a group
of fellows including myself heard
voices and footsteps along the
bank. VVe turned and yelled for
the other fellows over at the fire
to come and help us.
"Then we turned around and
saw five or six figures, with hand
kerchiefs over their faces, slowly
walking up to the fire carrying
burning torches. Then they broke
into a run."
Brief Scuffle
After a brief scuffle, they threw
the torches into part of an old
shack and ran. All four freshmen
are sure the attackers were up
perclassmen. perhaps the "Disen
chanted" ones mentioned in yes
terday's Daily interview.
"Friday night," said Cailleau,
"was dead quiet."
But early Sunday morning
things were hopping.
"About 1:30 a.m.," explained
Cailleau, "about 1.5 or 20 Stanford
upperclassmen walked down off
the Boathouse hill. Their number
included several prominent foot
ball players full of spare energy,
not to mention extra spirits.
"Relatively Quiet"
"Due to their size and the fact
they were relatively quiet, our
men did nothing to stop them.
They did succeed in lighting one
small brush fire, which was quick
ly put out.
"They then let the air out of
one of the tires of the fire engine
and yanked some of our men out
of the cab. In trying to defend
himself in a fist fight, one of our
men, Ray Harrington, had his lip
injured and had to have one stitch
taken."
Cailleau went to Wilbur for
help, bul when he returned, the
raiding group had given up after
lighting one small brush pile, and
left.
The guards later received word
that 75 Palo Alto High School
youths armed with chains were
on their way to the fire sile. but
21 of them were arrested and the
raid was squelched.
Four Cedro freshman officers
and bonfire guards indignantly
told The Daily yesterday that
their class had .not shown itself
to he "pantywaists" in last week
end's bonfire scuffles.
One of the freshmen, Alan Sell
gren, further hotly contended lliat
"the purpose of the guards was to
protect the fire against raids from
Paly High students and Cal peo
ple, ami it is rather disgusting,
that all attacks have come from
upperclassmen inside the cam
pus."
John Cailleau, substantiated by
Sellgren, Bob Campbell and Jim
Pries, gave an eyewitness account
of what actually happened in the
now rumor-filled raids.
