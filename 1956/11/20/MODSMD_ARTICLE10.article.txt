# Hungarians Don't Want Soviet Paradise, Says Refugee Monk
## Panelists Discuss Revolution Before Overflow Crowd Which Caused Move to Cubberley 
### Sally Trapnell 
The Hungarians revolted because they wanted only freedom, not
the paradise that the Soviets promised them and then withdrew,
Dr. Egon Javor, a Benedictine monk from Hungary, said at a Po
litical Union panel discussion last, night.
I'he meeting was scheduled for Bowman Alumni House, but was

forced to move to Cubberley be
cause of an ovei'flow crowd.
The Russians attempted to be
popular with important groups
by distributing land, paying high
salaries to workers and put ting
education under the slate where
it could be carefully supervised.
But soon the farmers discov
ered that they had exchanged the
tyranny of landlords for that of
the state, workers' quotas were
steadily raised and culture and
art were rigidly limited by party
demands, Javor said.
Demand for Freedom
"The nature of culture and art
demands freedom," Javor said.
"Thousands of Hungarian stu-1
dents are locked in boxcars atj
this moment on their way to the'
steppes of Siberia, because they i
fought for this freedom."
"If the pet classes turn against
the regime, as happened in Hun
gary, what can be expected of the
other satellites?" .Javor asked.
Dr. Klara Fetter, of ihe Hoover!
Institute, gave some background
on the rebellion. She said that of
all the satellites only Hungary is
non-Slavic and has had an unbro
ken record of anti-Communism,
thus making it less amenable fo
the Soviet system.
Key Position
"But the country is in a key j
geographic position on the Dan
ube," she added, as our reasonj
Ihe Soviets would even use the!
Red Army to keep a loitering [
pro-Communist regime in power.
"I do not know the reason fori
the Hungarians' courage in re
volting," she said. "Bui an Aus-j
trian writer once ( ailed their his-1
lory an unbroken heroic epic."
"A new chapter has siarted in
this epic during Ihe past three
weeks," she added. "I hope I hat
the world will not permit it to be
the final one."
Political Hackground
Dr. John Sallo, of the Hunga
rian Relief Committee, was Hie
final panel speaker who gave Ihc
political background and results |
of the Hungarian revolt.
"The rebellion destroyed two
myths," he said. "That of Soviet
strength was Ihe first."
For ten years Russia worked to
set up a defensive line in Europe,
he continued. They believed that
their satellite armies and all pro
letariat would fifrht for them.
The events of the last three
weeks have proved different ly.
But Ihe myth of Western mor
ality is also half-dead, Sallo said, i
Just at the moment when Hun
gary was led to expect aid. she
was stabbed in the back by the
British and French invasion of
Sue/, which turned attention
from her plight.
Sallo emphasized that there is
no dividing line between Hunga- j
rian freedom and U.S. liberty.
