# Rebel Workers Continue Strike In Budapest
## Ignore Back to Work Order; Hunger, Cold Weakening Resistance 
### 
BUDAPP:ST. Nov. 19 (UP) â€”
More than half of Hungary's
workers braved hunger, cold and
an influx of Soviet infantry today
to continue their general strike in
defiance of a Communist back-to
work ultimatum.
A spot check of factories in the
industrial heart of the country in
and around Budapest showed less
than 50 per cent of the strikers
surrendered to the order effective
this morning. Those who did
found little or nothing to do be
cause of shortages.
Many returnees said the threat
of hunger and cold forced them
to go back, not the puppet regime
of Premier Janos Kadar.
"Kadar didn't convince us," one
worker said. "But winter is here
and misery comes."
Bitter Spokesman
A spokesman for a group of re
turning workers was bitter.
"The whole country can't live
on relief." he said.
"The workers were so much
united by last week's events that
they will never fall apart again.
The government must realize by
now that the use of force is point
less."
Their three week walkout had
left the country paralyzed, short
of coal, electricity and raw mate
rials.
'Some fighting still was going
on, according to the Russians.
The Soviet party newspaper
"Pravda" said partisans still were
fighting and were making "spe
cial efforts to prevent restoration
of normal traffic on railroads.")
HO l*er ('ent Return
II appeared that the lack of ma
terials, power shortages and poor
transportation facilities kept oth
er workers from going back. Nev
ertheless. it was evident the
strike was far from smashed.
Only .'-in per cent of the HK.ooo
workers at the Csepel Island iron
and steel industrial complex in
the Danube separating Bttda and
Pest had gone back to work. The
plants were idled by shortages.
Arrests and deportations were
continuing, it was reported.
