## 
### 
Today you wii.i. nr. ask.i.D to give, and give gen
erously, to a cause 111 a I needs 110 testimony as
to its merit. Â»u will ho asked to give as much
as son can to relieve the hunger, eold and suf
fering of Hungarians who have been forced to
flee the reign of terror that has engulfed their
country for the past several weeks.
I he.-e refugees represent the hold hands of
Hungarians who fought the hardest for free
dom. I liev do not leave iheir homeland will
ingly or out of cowardice, for these people who
loiijihl against insurmountable odds for a clier
i-lied principle are among the hravest of the
human race. v
I here is little that citizens of this country
can do lo regain for llie valiant Hungarian
people iheir lost possessions and lost liberties,

hut every penny, dime and dollar that you can
give will, in some measure, help I hose who were
forced to flee at bayonet's point lo re-establish
themselves in a country where they no longer
need fear for iheir lives.
Students here have spoken of iheir feeling
of frustration over the fad thai this country's
hands remain tied at a lime when the last
flicker of freedom is burning out in Hungary.
By our very example of freedom and our words
of encouragement to ihe satellite states we must
pitifully share part of ihe blame for this mass
murder.
But, at the same lime, you can do something
to relieve llie suffering of these people. You
can help by giving generously and willingly to
today's Hungarian relief drive.
