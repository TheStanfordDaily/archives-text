# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Dave Scott
## Universities Begin Hungarian Relief Drives 
### 
Stanford is not alone in its drive for Hun
garian relief. University campuses throughout
the country have pitched in to collect funds to
help the Hungarian student refugees.
ale seems lo he topping all campuses in
generosity. Al their opening rally, which 1500
students attended, Yale gave more than $2000.
Organizations pledged $1000, while another
$1000 in change was collected in buckets.
Members of Yale's administration expressed
si rong sympathy for the Hungarian cause at the
rally. William <!. DeVane pledged that Yale
would give scholarships lo qualified Hungarian
refugee students. The dean of the law school
blasted the Unjted Nations and the United
Stales for llieir failure to respond to Hungarian
pleas. He suggested that this failure may "scut
lle Ihe UN."
l ast Thursday USC senate approved a drive
for supporting World University Service's Hun
graian program, and already nearly $1000 has
been contributed. The University of Idaho has
started a similar drive, but so far has raised
only $50.
But Cornell proved to be an exception to the
rule. There the student council called an emer
gency session to consider helping in the Hun
garian situation—and turned down a National
Student Association-sponsored measure for aid.
The Cornell Daily Sun supported the council's
decision, declaring in part:
"The revolt in the Soviet satellite happened
so quickly, and is character changed so rapidly
in the few days the revolutionary government
held power, that the foreign ministers and state
departments all over the world have been left
puzzled and confused.
"Too often sponsoring NSA flies off on wild,
unworkable adventures, only to find that more

considerate student council actions all over the
country have calmly curbed its impractical en
thusiasm and antagonistic idealism."
It concluded hv saying that the council had
intelligently and successfully stymied "NSA
pressure by frankly admitting its own lack of
background information on the Hungarian
crisis."

Student interest has also shown itself on the
Mideast turmoil.
At the University of San Francisco the col
lege paper, The Foghorn, Annducled a poll on
the question "Should the United States enter
into the Middle East conflict?"
The answer favored U.S. support of the UN
international police force now moving into the
Suez area.
One student said: "This dillydallying around
with votes and vetoes is beginning to get my
goat. The UN charter plainly forbids any such
aggression as has been committed by Israel,
France and Great Britain. Either we stand by
the laws of the organization that we helped to
create or we go on allowing the nations of the
world to laugh at us."

The interest in international affairs has man
ifested itself on the University of North Caro
lina campus. There the legislature recently
voted (18-13) $400 to The Daily Tar Heel for
a national and international wire service.
In pleading his cause, Editor Fred Prowledge
said: "Vte no longer live in a campus commu
nity. What goes on in the rest of the world
affects every student on campus."
Opposition said the wire would cut into cam
pus news, and several small organization heads
said the paper was not even at present printing
all their articles.
