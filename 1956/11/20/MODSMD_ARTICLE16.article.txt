Faels Behind tlie Bonfire
Editor, The Daily:
We suggest that before believing the drivel
printed on the front page of The Daily yesterday,
you look at what really has been happening at
Lake Lag the past few nights.
We have been under the impression that this
bonfire we are building is for Big Game . . . and
thus, the football team. Then, if some of our
"spirited" (?) gridders warn to burn the fire
< arly, why stop them? The enthusiastic spirit,
they showed Saturday n ,t a. Lag was sorely
missed in Saturday afternoon's fiasco.
The alarm sounded in the early hours of Sun
day morning was anything but /'false," as you
stated in Monday's paper. It was caused by the
appearance of a good-sized contingent from the
region known as the "Row." Represented among
their number were the ATO's, Phi Delts, Fijis,
Sigma Nil's, Zetes and El Toro—to mention a
few.
And if Ihe Saturday alarm was false, how did
oiio freshman happen to suffer a badly cut lip
which required stitches? Was it his imagination
or was it a wrapped fist? How did several small
fires start, by spontaneous combustion or at ihe
hands of our loyal Stanfordites from the Row?
And just what authority do these hairy-chest
ed simpletons have to hang an effigy of coach
('buck Taylor? This was done, Saturday after
nuon, in front of the Cellar. But much to their
dismay, a group of freshmen on their way to
l ake Lag promptly tore down the effigy and
carted it off, with our brave executioners in pur
suit.
Yesterday The Daily wasted space by printing
a whole article of unfounded lies directed at ridi
culing the freshman class. Now we ask that a
liitie of the truth be known.
If those enthusiastic athletes who wanted Ihe
fire burned last week want to burn it tonight,
that's fine . . . but please come sober.*
And may we remind you that the materials
for the bonfire remain unhurried? What more
do you want?

I have missed only eight Big Game bonfires
since 1927, but I sadly predict that this or next

year's will be the last. This great tradition is
showing all the signs of decay and death.
At one time it was an all-campus project, a
blazing defiance against Cal. The freshmen were
permitted the privilege of building it while up
perclassmen guarded every road leading into the
campus. One fall, when it. was burned prema
turely, men from all four classes turned out
and rebuilt it in a day.
But in recent years, raids from Cal have all
but ceased, and even high school kids are show
ing less and less interest in incendiary attacks.
A comparatively indifferent student body has
made the bonfire the responsibility of the fresh
man class.
Now to create an ersatz spirit under un
natural conditions, upperclassmen are staging
fake raids and not-so-fake raids on their own
symbol of a promised victory over Cal.
Soon, maybe this week or maybe next fall, a
Stanford man will get seriously injured at the
hands of other Stanford men. That will finish it.
All traditions must die sometime. Since this
one has lost its original spirit, perhaps it should
be decently buried now. The freshmen won't
like this proposal, but many of the upperclass
men don't really care.
Leave it to some of us old-timers to recall the
good old days when the building, guarding and
lighting of the Big Game bonfire was the pre
cious concern of every loyal Stanfordite.

Imagine how extremely shocked and appalled
wc were when we read in The Daily of our con
nection in some childish plot to set asunder the
freshmen's bonfire. Heaven forbid such wanton
thoughts. An institution such as ours frowns
on such vulgar displays of barbarism.
However the accusation was made, and after
a boisterous meeting yesterday at Rossotti's of
the ( Pheta Delt) Security Council, it was con
cluded that the action was definitely not a house
function.
Furthermore, in view of the fact that The
Daily continues to drag the sterling names of
fraternities in the mud, we have therefore de-
cided to refrain from lining our garbage cans
with the results of your journalistic efforts.

I have missed only eight Big Game bonfires
since 1927, but I sadly predict that this or next

year's will be the last. This great tradition is
showing all the signs of decay and death.
At one time it was an all-campus project, a
blazing defiance against Cal. The freshmen were
permitted the privilege of building it while up
perclassmen guarded every road leading into the
campus. One fall, when it. was burned prema
turely, men from all four classes turned out
and rebuilt it in a day.
But in recent years, raids from Cal have all
but ceased, and even high school kids are show
ing less and less interest in incendiary attacks.
A comparatively indifferent student body has
made the bonfire the responsibility of the fresh
man class.
Now to create an ersatz spirit under un
natural conditions, upperclassmen are staging
fake raids and not-so-fake raids on their own
symbol of a promised victory over Cal.
Soon, maybe this week or maybe next fall, a
Stanford man will get seriously injured at the
hands of other Stanford men. That will finish it.
All traditions must die sometime. Since this
one has lost its original spirit, perhaps it should
be decently buried now. The freshmen won't
like this proposal, but many of the upperclass
men don't really care.
Leave it to some of us old-timers to recall the
good old days when the building, guarding and
lighting of the Big Game bonfire was the pre
cious concern of every loyal Stanfordite.

Imagine how extremely shocked and appalled
wc were when we read in The Daily of our con
nection in some childish plot to set asunder the
freshmen's bonfire. Heaven forbid such wanton
thoughts. An institution such as ours frowns
on such vulgar displays of barbarism.
However the accusation was made, and after
a boisterous meeting yesterday at Rossotti's of
the ( Pheta Delt) Security Council, it was con
cluded that the action was definitely not a house
function.
Furthermore, in view of the fact that The
Daily continues to drag the sterling names of
fraternities in the mud, we have therefore de-
cided to refrain from lining our garbage cans
with the results of your journalistic efforts.

We suggest that before believing the drivel
printed on the front page of The Daily yesterday,
you look at what really has been happening at
Lake Lag the past few nights.
We have been under the impression that this
bonfire we are building is for Big Game . . . and
thus, the football team. Then, if some of our
"spirited" (?) gridders warn to burn the fire
< arly, why stop them? The enthusiastic spirit,
they showed Saturday n ,t a. Lag was sorely
missed in Saturday afternoon's fiasco.
The alarm sounded in the early hours of Sun
day morning was anything but /'false," as you
stated in Monday's paper. It was caused by the
appearance of a good-sized contingent from the
region known as the "Row." Represented among
their number were the ATO's, Phi Delts, Fijis,
Sigma Nil's, Zetes and El Toro—to mention a
few.
And if Ihe Saturday alarm was false, how did
oiio freshman happen to suffer a badly cut lip
which required stitches? Was it his imagination
or was it a wrapped fist? How did several small
fires start, by spontaneous combustion or at ihe
hands of our loyal Stanfordites from the Row?

year's will be the last. This great tradition is
showing all the signs of decay and death.
At one time it was an all-campus project, a
blazing defiance against Cal. The freshmen were
permitted the privilege of building it while up
perclassmen guarded every road leading into the
campus. One fall, when it. was burned prema
turely, men from all four classes turned out
and rebuilt it in a day.
But in recent years, raids from Cal have all
but ceased, and even high school kids are show
ing less and less interest in incendiary attacks.
A comparatively indifferent student body has
made the bonfire the responsibility of the fresh
man class.
Now to create an ersatz spirit under un
natural conditions, upperclassmen are staging
fake raids and not-so-fake raids on their own
symbol of a promised victory over Cal.
Soon, maybe this week or maybe next fall, a
Stanford man will get seriously injured at the
hands of other Stanford men. That will finish it.
All traditions must die sometime. Since this
one has lost its original spirit, perhaps it should
be decently buried now. The freshmen won't
like this proposal, but many of the upperclass
men don't really care.
Leave it to some of us old-timers to recall the
good old days when the building, guarding and
lighting of the Big Game bonfire was the pre
cious concern of every loyal Stanfordite.

Editor, The Daily:
Imagine how extremely shocked and appalled
wc were when we read in The Daily of our con
nection in some childish plot to set asunder the
freshmen's bonfire. Heaven forbid such wanton
thoughts. An institution such as ours frowns
on such vulgar displays of barbarism.
However the accusation was made, and after
a boisterous meeting yesterday at Rossotti's of
the ( Pheta Delt) Security Council, it was con
cluded that the action was definitely not a house
function.
Furthermore, in view of the fact that The
Daily continues to drag the sterling names of
fraternities in the mud, we have therefore de-
cided to refrain from lining our garbage cans
with the results of your journalistic efforts.
