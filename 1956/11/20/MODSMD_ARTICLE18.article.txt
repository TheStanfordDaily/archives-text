# FOR THE CON HOME
## Allied Arts Guild Volunteer Staff Plans Big Holiday Season 
### 
Christmas and children go to
gether, and some 130 area women
are trying to make the Christmas
shopping season serve an extra
turn for children at the Stanford
Convalescent Home.
The 130 women are members
of the Woodside-Atherton Junior
Auxiliary of the Con Home, and
they operate the Allied Arts
Guild on Creek Drive in Menlo
Park, the profits from which go
to the Con Home.
The Guild includes nine shops.
Two of the shops, the Traditional
Shop and the Pajio Building, are
operated by the Auxiliary. Mem
bers sell, at prices comparable to
those of other local merchants,
a variety of unusual gifts.
Volunteer Personnel
The two shops are staffed pri
marily by volunteer personnel.
Members of the Auxiliary donate
eight hours a month to work in
the stores, in order to remain ac
tive in the organization. They
also act as landlords for the other
shops and supervise the grounds.
The Palo Alto Junior Auxiliary
staffs a tearoom where shoppers
may eat lunch or drink tea before
a fire in the winter or beneath the
sun on the courtyard in the sum
mer.
Besides purchasing ready-made
items from the merchants at the
Guild, the customer may patron
ize Guild tenants who do custom
made work, such as Robert
Clarke, potter; Martin Nelson,
cabinet maker; and Mildred Gar
net t, weaver.
Christmas Hours
The Guild is open daily from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. and will be open the
first three Sundays in December
from 12 to 5 p.m. to aid Christ
mas shoppers.
Through the efforts of the Aux
iliary workers, five beds are
maintained at the Con Home.

Spanish • style buildings which
house Guild's shops stand on
a small portion of what was once
the Rancho de las Pulgas, land
grant from Ihe King of Spain to
Don Jose Argiiello, commandant
of San Francisco in the early
1800's.
In 1929, three ana a half acres
of the property were purchased
by Mr. and Mrs. Garfield Merner,
world travelers and collectors, as
a site for a guild, similar to those
in Europe, where craftsmen could
carry on the traditions of early
California through their work.
Some of the original barn and
sheep sheds were incorporated
into the guild and new buildings
arose, continuing Ihe colonial
Spanish theme. The gardens were
planned by Mrs. Merner, and they
are named in Spanish manner.
The Court of Abundance is at the
entrance to the main building;
the Garden of Delight in spring
blossoms out in blue; and the Cer
vantes Court features a mural of
Cervantes dedicating his master
piece, "Don Quixote."
frescoes throughout the area
were created by the De Lemos
family and Maxine Albro.
Lunchroom
In 1932, the Merners invited the
Palo Alto Junior Auxiliary to
maintain a lunchroom at the
Guild, with proceeds to go to the
Con Home. The originators of the
Guild retired from active opera
tion in 1935 and leased the Guild
to the Senior Auxiliary of the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
In 1946, a group who named
themselves the Allied Arts Asso
ciates, Inc., bought the property
and continued to run the enter
prise for the Home's benefit.
In 1951, they turned the trus
teeship and management over to
ihe Woodside-Atherton group.
