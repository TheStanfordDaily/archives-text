# Stanford Again Favorite in Big Game
## Van Galder and Polich Out for Season; Carswell Ready to Go 
### Jerry Kelly Sports Editor 
For the fourth week in a row,
Stanford takes ihe favorite's role.
Three times the Bay Area and
national prognosticators have
heen wrong. But this Saturday it
will take more than bad luck to
heat the Indians this is the Big
Came.
Disheartening news reached the
Card coaching s t a 112 112 yesterday
when starting right end Gary Van
Calder was pronounced definitely
out for the season after incurring
a head concussion in the Wash
ington fracas. Ty Polich, too, will
miss the Big Game because of an
injured knee and will leave the
left-tackle position with little
depth.
The Stanford varsity reported
to yesterday's practice session in
game uniforms for the benefit of
photographers in a scheduled Pic
ture Day for Big Game. Only light
warm-up drills were scheduled for
the varsity members.
Coach Chuck Taylor's lineman
problems took a turn to the better
in the left-guard position with the
return of Donn Carswell to the
lineup. Carswell, out since the
Southern California game, will
boost the center of the line consid
erably. The Big Game will be the
last collegiate appearance for the
three-year letterman. r
Carswell's substitute during the
three-week interim, John Clark,
provided stellar performances de
spite his previous lack of experi
ence. Taylor will be relying on
the 200-pound junior for reserve
.strength this Saturday.
In Berkeley, Coach Lynn Wal
dorf, upset over his team's unex
pected loss to Washington State
last Saturday, 14-13, has his outfit
drilling in pass defense—a weak
ness last Saturday and the week
before in losing to Southern Cali
fornia, 20-7.
Waldorf and his staff have also
worked on a more potent running
and passing attack in an effort to
outscore the Indians in what is
considered to be "a wide-open ball
game."
Cal's passing, ranked third he
hind Stanford and Washington
State, will be led by sophomore
Joe Kapp and returning veteran
Gus Gianulias. Fullback Herb
Jackson and halfbacks Jack Hart
and John Stewart lead the Bear
rushing statistics.


SOPHOMORE QUARTERBACK—Most of California's hopes for a
Biy Game victory will rest on the ability of sophomore quarterback
Joe Kapp. Injuries at the quarterback spot paved the way for
Kapp and he has been the starting Bear signal caller most of the
season. A 195-pound back, .Kapp is his team's leading; passer as
well as the total offense leader.

Carswell's substitute during the
three-week interim, John Clark,
provided stellar performances de
spite his previous lack of experi
ence. Taylor will be relying on
the 200-pound junior for reserve
.strength this Saturday.
In Berkeley, Coach Lynn Wal
dorf, upset over his team's unex
pected loss to Washington State
last Saturday, 14-13, has his outfit
drilling in pass defense—a weak
ness last Saturday and the week
before in losing to Southern Cali
fornia, 20-7.
Waldorf and his staff have also
worked on a more potent running
and passing attack in an effort to
outscore the Indians in what is
considered to be "a wide-open ball
game."
Cal's passing, ranked third he
hind Stanford and Washington
State, will be led by sophomore
Joe Kapp and returning veteran
Gus Gianulias. Fullback Herb
Jackson and halfbacks Jack Hart
and John Stewart lead the Bear
rushing statistics.


SOPHOMORE QUARTERBACK—Most of California's hopes for a
Biy Game victory will rest on the ability of sophomore quarterback
Joe Kapp. Injuries at the quarterback spot paved the way for
Kapp and he has been the starting Bear signal caller most of the
season. A 195-pound back, .Kapp is his team's leading; passer as
well as the total offense leader.
For the fourth week in a row,
Stanford takes ihe favorite's role.
Three times the Bay Area and
national prognosticators have
heen wrong. But this Saturday it
will take more than bad luck to
heat the Indians this is the Big
Came.
Disheartening news reached the
Card coaching s t a 112 112 yesterday
when starting right end Gary Van
Calder was pronounced definitely
out for the season after incurring
a head concussion in the Wash
ington fracas. Ty Polich, too, will
miss the Big Game because of an
injured knee and will leave the
left-tackle position with little
depth.
The Stanford varsity reported
to yesterday's practice session in
game uniforms for the benefit of
photographers in a scheduled Pic
ture Day for Big Game. Only light
warm-up drills were scheduled for
the varsity members.
Coach Chuck Taylor's lineman
problems took a turn to the better
in the left-guard position with the
return of Donn Carswell to the
lineup. Carswell, out since the
Southern California game, will
boost the center of the line consid
erably. The Big Game will be the
last collegiate appearance for the
three-year letterman. r
