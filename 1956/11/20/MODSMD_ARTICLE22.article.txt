# Card Cross-Country Team to Battle Strong Cal Club Today
## 
### 
It's the Big Meet of the season
for the Stanford cross-country
team today at 4 p.m. when the
Tribe travels to Berkeley to run
against Califorina's potent Bears.
The two teams have run against
each other twice before this year,
with Cal coming out on top both
times. Today's meet, however,
will be the one which counts in
the PCC Southern Division stand
ings, and the Indians will be out
to get their first conference win
of the year.
Cal ran roughshod over Stan
ford several weeks ago, whipping
the Indians by a 20-37 count. Last
Friday the two teams took part

in the San Jose State Invitational,
and things were much closer.
The Bears won the meet title
with a low score of 39, followed
! by San Jose State with 42 and
Stanford with 43. On a dual meet
scoring basis, Cal edged the SU
harriers, 27-29, while the Indians
and Spartans had their second 28-
28 tie of the season.
Individual winner was Califor
nia's Bob House, who ran the four
miles in 21:50. Top man for coach
Pay ton Jordan's squad was Ralph
Love, who ran third in 22:18.
Other point-scorers for Stanford
were Doug Martin fifth, Maury
Graves eighth, Bob Monzingo
ninth and Don Richardson 18th.
Rodger Beck. Ernie Cunliffe and
Warren Wood will join the top
five in running against the Bears
today.
A second meet will take place
today on the Stanford Golf Course
at 4:00, when the Indian JV's tan

gle with Palo Alto High School in
a two-mile race.
The Stanford second-line team
nipped Paly earlier in the year,
but the prepsters have since won
the northern California cross
country championship and will
provide a stern test for the
Braves.
