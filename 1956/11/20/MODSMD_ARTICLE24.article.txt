# Joe Ruetz Has Many Problems Repairing Line
## (Editor's Note: This is the fourth of a series on the Stanford football coaching: staff.) 
### Dean Stewart 
Assistant Coach Joe Ruetz ex
perienced one of 'his most diffi
cult coaching seasons this year.
Ruetz along with Coach Dutch
Fehring instructs the Card line
men on both offense and defense.
"Our main problem this year
has been injuries, of course," said
Ruetz. "When you lose top line
men like (Donn) Carswell, (Jer
ry) Beatie, (Sieve) Docter and
for a lew games Bob Long,
(Gary) Van Galder and Noel Rob
inson, you're bound to have prob
lems.
"Our replacements did real
well, especially John Clark at
guard, but they lacked experi
ence. A good line has to operate
as a unit. When you're forced to
make replacements a great deal
of co-ordination is lost."
In addition to his line coaching
duties Ruetz spends several Sat
urday afternoons scouting future
Card opponents. During the win
ter he works as an assistant rug
by coach.
Ruetz graduated from Notre
Dame with a B.S. in Pre-Med

sign, USNR, and was stationed at
St. Mary's Pre-Flight where he
was an athletic instructor and
played on the Pre-Flight team.
That year he was chosen All-Serv
ice All American.
In the spring of 1943 Ruetz re
signed his commission and en
listed as an aviation cadet. After
Completing his training he was
commissioned a second lieuten
ant. USMCR, in June, 1944. In
1945 ho was assigned to overseas
duty as a carrier fighter pilot.
