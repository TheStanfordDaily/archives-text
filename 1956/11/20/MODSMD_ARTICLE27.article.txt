### 
Martin Jepson, E.E., Purdue, "53,
is an Engineer in the Radio and
Special Services Section of Illinois
15(11 Telephone Company.
"I help design mobile radiotele
phone systems." says Martin. "We
have a wide variety of customers,
including trucking firms, railroads
and marine traffic of all kinds. Many
businessmen, too. want these systems
for their private cars. Each customer
has his own communications prob
lems, and these are a constant and
stimulating engineering challenge.
"Another part of my job is to help
set up facilities for conventions,

sports events and the like. T,nst sum
mer's Democratic National Conven
tion, for instance, used enough
circuits and facilities to serve a small
city. There were special circuits for
broadcasting, teletypewriters, the
press, and for inside communica
tions. It was our job to set those
facilities up and keep them operating.
"The increase in demand for tele
phone and related services is phe
nomenal. It's this growth that's
creating real career opportunities in
the telephone business. Add to this
the fact that it's a stable business,
and vou've reallv got something!" 1
