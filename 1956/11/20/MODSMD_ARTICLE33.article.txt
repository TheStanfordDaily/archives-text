# 'Indian Flyers' Seek Own Plane, Official Sanction
## 
### 
The Indian Flyers are strug
gling to buy their own plane and
achieve University recognition
for their club. 11 current plans
succeed the group will have its
most successful year since pre
war days.
The immediate problem is rais
ing money to buy a new two-seat
er, 65-horsepower Luscombe air
plane which costs $1100. Though
a the 50 members of the
group*have their own planes the
organization itself has not owned
an airplane in more than ten
years
As a result, members are
forced to rent planes to do any
regular amount of flying. Meet
ings are held every Thursday af
ternoon and the group travels to
San Jose Airport where'they are
able to hire planes.
At present nine enthusiasts
have agreed to put up $50 each
as a down payment on the Lus
combe.
Club representative John Car
do/a said the club is anxious to
have any interested person .join
in the plan. He can be contacted
any evening at the Wilbur office
before 7:30.
At its inception in the early
1930's the club was very popular
and owned its own plane. It also
had University recognition. After
the war the club had to soil its
plane and in 1947 official sanction
was withdrawn.
