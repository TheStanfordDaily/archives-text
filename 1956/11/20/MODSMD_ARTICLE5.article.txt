UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov.
I!) (Hl'i Soviet Foreign Minister
Dmitri T. Shcpilov said today it
was an "Outlandish invention"
that the Russians wore deporting
Hungarians to Siberia.
U.S. "Ambassador Henry Cabot
Uodge Jr. promptly told the UN
Gen e r a 1 Assembly that 16.000
Hungarians had been deported in
boxcars from Budapest alone as
of last Friday.
Cuba's Ambassador Kmilio Nu
nez-Port uondo, in a scathing de
nunciation of Russia's interven
tion in the Hungarian revolution,
asked the General Assembly to de
mand an immediate halt to all de
portations and that Russia get ils
troops out of Hungary immedi
ately.
Shrpilov, in an hour-long full
dress diatribe against the West,
said Cuba's resolution "has about
it the fetid odor of provocation."
He said Soviet troops would be
withdrawn from Hungary "as
soon as the situation there is nor
malized."
