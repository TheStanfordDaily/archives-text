the "Intellectual Giant of Jazz"
because of his original, progres

harmonic variations on standard
themes, utilizing such concert in
struments as French horns and
bass tubas to achieve his unique
sound.
Students "Appreciative"
"I have always been convinced,"
said Kenton yesterday, "that the
student is more appreciative than
a member of the general public.
It is possible for a college audi
ence to conceive in th e i r own
minds what we are trying to do
with the music.
"We never have to wony about
getting too commercial during a
concert on a college campus," he
continued. "Students are interest
ed in hearing music that has
meaning and background, and,
the proper 1 atmosphere for creat
ing Is present, this is what we try
to give them."
Early Training
Kenton had an early musical
training in the trumpet, sax. banjo
and his favorite, the piano. His
idol is the famous Karl 'T'atha"
Mines. Early in 1941 he formed
his own band to introduce pro
gressive jazz to the popular music
field.
Kenton said he was "thrilled"
at the idea of playing at Stanford.
