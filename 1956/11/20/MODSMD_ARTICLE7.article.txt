## Claims He Is Trying To Be 'Little Stalin' With Satellite States 
### 
MOSCOW, Nov. 19 (UP>—Rus
sia accused President Tito of Yu
goslavia today of trying to set
himself up as a little Stalin and
warned him to stop meddling in
the affairs of other Communist
states.
The first harsh Soviet criticism
of the Yugoslav leader since he
and Moscow restored friendly re
lations last year came in a public
statement by the Soviet party
newspaper "Pravcla" and in pri
vate talks by Russian officials.
The officials privately attrib
uted to Tito and to Titoism at
least partial blame for the events
in Hungary.
Interference Charged
"Pravda" charged he was inter
fering in the affairs of foreign
states and warned him to stop
advertising Titoism as "the sole
true road to socialism."
The paper condemned the Yu
goslav leader for his speech at
Pula, Yugoslavia, Nov. 11 in
which he said the Soviet "system"
as well as Stalinism was respon
sible for the Hungarian tragedy.
Russians resented most Tito's
classification of Kremlin leaders
into Stalinists and non-Stalinists,
at a time when Soviet Commu
nists are trying to forget Stalin's
misdeeds and develop relations
with foreign Communists along
now lines.
"Reactionary Propaganda"
"Pravda" referred to Tito's
charge as "reactionary propagan
da."
It virtually accused Tito of re
serving to himself the Stalinist
practice of telling other Commu
nist parties how to run their af
fairs.
Furthermore, "Pravda" said.
Tito failed to keep faith with
promises made to Soviet party
chief Nikita S. Khrushchev on
various affairs dealing with rela
tionships among Communist par
ties.
Tito and Khrushchev had held
conferences in October both in
Yugoslavia and in the Soviet
Black Sea resort of Yalta.
