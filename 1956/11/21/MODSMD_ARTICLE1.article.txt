Hardest Fought Series
Not the oldest of football rivalries, the Big Game is definitely
the most evenly balanced and hardest fought series iu the cuuulrv.

I he alums spread throughout the Bay Area will say tradition
and prestige arc at slake. For the team, the coaches and the stu
dents, a successful season and the Axe are at stake. Last November,
after nine long years, the Axe was returned to the Farm. Stanford
had won, 19-0 the first Big Game win on the Stanford campus
since 1935.
VXill the Tribe retain the Axe? Stanford goes into the fracas
a two-touchdown favorite. Those who have witnessed many Big
(rames iu the past, however, will tell you upsets are common,

Stanford this year featured a football team "upset" on three,
consecutive Saturdays probably the greatest Cardinal aggrega
tion e\er to suffer five defeats in one season. First, two Big Ten
powerhouses, Michigan State and Ohio State, ground out lough
wins, 2I -. and 32-20. I lie Indians caught fire and rolled over San
Jose Stale, Oregon and Southern California to gain the eighth
spot in national rankings. Il was those one-point losses to I CI,A
I I 113) and Oregon State (20-19) that sank the high-flying Cards.
Fast Saturdays loss to Washington was the aftermath. The ques
tion now: ''Can 1 aylor's men sail again in the Big Game?"
More Serious Troubles
California has had more serious troubles this year. Only an
impressive 11-0 win over an Eastern grid leader, Pittsburgh, and
a 13-9 win over Washington have saved the Bears from a com
pletely dismal season.
Coach Chuck Jaylor has his Stanfords primed for the kill.
Predicting a win, as per usual, Taylor has geared his Tribe to s.i\r
face. Al l-American quarterback John Brodie will direct the In
dians and is expected lo keep the skies filled with his sharp aerials.
I he nation s ton passer and total offense leader will end a brilliant
collegiate career Saturday.
\\ ith Brodie in the back field will he two other seniors, half
backs Gordy Noting and Paul Camera. Camera, considered Stan
ford's most underrated performer, is tops in a line of outstanding
Indian pass receivers and has played a brilliant defensive game
for three seasons. Young, also in his third year as a varsity letter
man, has averaged better than five yards per carry while carrying
the mail at Stanford.
On the line, All-American tackle Paul Wiggin plays hi* final
game, as do center Bob Long, guard Dunn Carswell and ends Carl
Isaacs and Boh Gergen. All have been outstanding in their re
spective positions during a three-year tenure as varsity men.
Backs Jerry Angove, Bill Burgel and Mickey Bafterv will al«»o
appear for the last time in an Indian uniform.
California has an unpredictable ball club which will pull i
few surprises come Saturday. Coach Pappy Waldorf, working with
a younger crew, has developed a hot-and-cold passing attack with

sophomore Joe Kapp and (ins
Gianulias.
Waldorf (lie Wise Walrus uti
lizes the spread-T formation this
season along with the regular T.
His two most potent back to ditto
in the rushing department are
I lerb Jackson and John Stewart,
each vvith better than a four-yard
average.
Playing their final game for
llir Bears are backs Jackson and
Nat Brazil, center Frank Malta
roccl, guard Don Gilkey and end
Bill Vallbtton.
Saturday there's no Rose Bowl
at stake, no conference title, no
national rating but still it's the
Big Game, and Coach Taylor
says. "We'll win!"

after nine long years, the Axe was returned to the Farm. Stanford
had won, 19-0 the first Big Game win on the Stanford campus
since 1935.

Stanford this year featured a football team "upset" on three,
consecutive Saturdays probably the greatest Cardinal aggrega
tion e\er to suffer five defeats in one season. First, two Big Ten
powerhouses, Michigan State and Ohio State, ground out lough
wins, 2I -. and 32-20. I lie Indians caught fire and rolled over San

More Serious Troubles
California has had more serious troubles this year. Only an
impressive 11-0 win over an Eastern grid leader, Pittsburgh, and
a 13-9 win over Washington have saved the Bears from a com
pletely dismal season.
Coach Chuck Jaylor has his Stanfords primed for the kill.
Predicting a win, as per usual, Taylor has geared his Tribe to s.i\r
face. Al l-American quarterback John Brodie will direct the In
dians and is expected lo keep the skies filled with his sharp aerials.
I he nation s ton passer and total offense leader will end a brilliant
collegiate career Saturday.
\\ ith Brodie in the back field will he two other seniors, half
backs Gordy Noting and Paul Camera. Camera, considered Stan
ford's most underrated performer, is tops in a line of outstanding
Indian pass receivers and has played a brilliant defensive game
for three seasons. Young, also in his third year as a varsity letter
man, has averaged better than five yards per carry while carrying
the mail at Stanford.
On the line, All-American tackle Paul Wiggin plays hi* final
game, as do center Bob Long, guard Dunn Carswell and ends Carl
Isaacs and Boh Gergen. All have been outstanding in their re
spective positions during a three-year tenure as varsity men.
Backs Jerry Angove, Bill Burgel and Mickey Bafterv will al«»o
appear for the last time in an Indian uniform.
California has an unpredictable ball club which will pull i
few surprises come Saturday. Coach Pappy Waldorf, working with
a younger crew, has developed a hot-and-cold passing attack with

sophomore Joe Kapp and (ins
Gianulias.
Waldorf (lie Wise Walrus uti
lizes the spread-T formation this
season along with the regular T.
His two most potent back to ditto
in the rushing department are
I lerb Jackson and John Stewart,
