# Axe Has Eventful Past
## The 						Axe: Tangible Part of Intangible 'Stanford Spirit' 
### Camille Petersen 
The Stanford Axe? What is so
significant about this tomahawk
shaped, 10 pound lumberman's
broad axe? Well, it might be
railed a tangible part of the
"Stanford Spirit."
And like the other outstanding
fealures, tangible and intangible,
of the school, the Axe has a most
colorful past.
Just 57 years ago, three years
after Ihe introduction of Stan
ford's own Axe Yell by Will Ir
win and Will Bradley, and with a
large red "S" painted on its 15-
inch blade, the Axe made its first
official appearance. The date:
April 14, 1899. The occasion: a
rally held for the basebail team
before its second encounter with
the University of California
team; the UC team had already
won the first game of a three
game series.
Black Day
The following day was a black
day for all Stanfordites. Despite
the decapitation ceremony of an
imaginary "Golden Bear" with
the Axe and wild brandishing of
the instrument, the team dropped
the game, 9-7.
The three guardians of the Axe
were the last to leave the park.
Lying in wait, ready to relieve
them of their precious charge,
were more than 30 Cal men.
More Stanford students joined
the fray, but the Axe was passed
to the star member of the Cal
track team who immediately set
out to break all existing records
for speed and endurance. He was
nearly stopped by two Stanford
men attacking from a side street,
but he finally made his way safe
ly to a delivery wagon and was
sped away with his prize.
Search
Even policemen searching all
boarding ferries to Berkeley
could not stop the theft of the
Axe. The handle had been sawed
off, and a boy was able to it
under his shirt and board the
ferry with a girl friend without
being detected. Upon /eudiiiig
Oakland, he and the Axe headed
at top speed for Berkeley.
A "delegation" of Stanford men
stormed the Chi Psi fraternity,
home of the Cal baseball captain,
where the Axe was hidden. But
once again, they failed to find it.
For 31 years Stanford was des
tined to be without its Axe. Stan
ford beat California in athletic
contests many times. But Cal had
compensation in watching Stan
fordites bristle to their retort of
"We've got the Axe." Many at
tempts to recover the prized pos
session were made, but all were
doomed to failure.
Then came April 3, 1930.
The magic words "We've got
Ihe Axe" brought Stanfordites
from their beds.
Planning Paid
Three years of planning by men
of Sequoia Hall had paid off.
They have gone down in Stanford
history as the "Immortal 21."
Gone down in history? More
than that. They have become a
legend.
On that fateful day, the "21"
piled into three cars and headed
for enemy territory, razzing po
licemen all the way. Once there
they took up their individual, pre
assigned positions and went to
work.
Some mingled with the Cal
rooters and Axe guards. Howard
Avery, by igniting a broom han
dle and waving it high in the air
while the Californians were reli
giously singing their hymn, al
most gave the plot away.
The Axe was returned by ar
mored car to the bank at 9:30
p.m. "Cameramen" were waiting,
and persuaded the Cal guards to
let them some quick shots of
the Axe. At the right moment,
the St anf or d "cameraman"
clicked the camera, shooting flash
powder into the guards' eyes,
temporarily blinding them, and
grabbed the Axe.
After the Axe passed "bucket
brigade fashion" away from Ihe
scene of action, one of the boys
slipped it under his sweater,
made his way to a waiting black
Buick sedan and made his get
away.
A tear-gas bomb thrown into
the crowd allowed most of the
"21" to make good their escape.
A few remained to lead the angry
Cal men astray when they at
tempted to follow.
Within 50 minutes the Axe was
back on the Farm.
Last year, as a result of a 19-0
score, the Axe came home again.
Stanford students are wondering,
"Will it stay another year?"
