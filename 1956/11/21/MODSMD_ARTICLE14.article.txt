# Bonfire 'Push' Starts at Noon; 5-10,000 Will See Oski Born
## 
### Larry Lynch 
"Big Push" starts at noon today.
One of the newer innovations in the colorful history of Stanford
Big Game bonfires, the "Big Push" idea was originated in 1953.
Every freshman on campus will be mustered for this all-out con
struction effort. Work on the giant structure will continue at a

steady pace through the night
and far into Thursday.
And despite the holiday a
crowd of 5000 to 10,000 is ex
pected to be on spirited hand as
Oski is consumed by blight or
ange flames.
In the face of early burnings,
flaming arrows, incendiary time
bombs and any additional plans
Cal could put to the foil, Stanford
student spirit has been rallied by
bonfires for 58 years, and on an
evening prior to Big Game for
almost that long.
Faces to Fire
Last year some 5000 frozen
rooters put their backs to the
wind, their faces to the fire and
rang forth with the "Axe Yell" in
reception to a Big Game victory
prediction by Coach Chuck Tay
lor.
Stanford had not won for nine
years. But on Saturday the pre
diction came true, 19 to 0.
That's history now. Also 'his
tory are many unusual events
Bonfire spirit has kindled and the
many attempts to upset that
spirit that have been tried anci
have failed.
In 1955 there was the flaming
arrow shot at the grand structure
just before it was lighted unsuc
cessful.
In 1953 plans for an intricate
bombing attempt found their way
to the ears of several freshman
sponsors. They warned the men
constructing the bonfire to be on
the lookout for light logs. One
was noticed that didn't look right,
and an investigation instigated. It
was found to enclose an incen
diary time bomb. Some 300 feet
of wiring was uncovered.
After World War II
The Big Game bonfire actually
began as a big project just after-
World War 11. In 1946 the first
sophomore was appointed to take
charge of the construction and
the freshmen started building for
height. A record of 85 feet was
set in 1947.
But pre-game football bonfires,
Big Game and otherwise, have
burned every year since 1898
when a group of Roble women
came up with the idea of using
Lake Lagunita as the scene of a
bonfire.
At the 1904 bonfire, Cal set fire
to the once-sacred "Big C" fence.
The first bonfire-inspired serpen
tine wound through Inner Quad
prior to the 1911 rugby tussle
with Cal.
Time Bomb
The initial time bomb attempt
was made in 1928. In fact it suc
ceeded in leveling the wood a day
before the scheduled burning. Ra
dio appeals went out for more
wood. In one day the structure
was rebuilt and the rally went off
on schedule.
The classical "Doodles" Weaver
led a rally crowd in the "Axe
Yell" in 1935 and the tradition
was firmly implanted. It was the
year that rooters spirited the
"Vow Boys," who as sophomores
vowed never to lose to Cal or
USC, to a 13-0 victory over the
Bear. Doodles returned to the
bonfire in '36 to lead an inspired
; "Nuts to Cal" chant.

Faces to Fire
Last year some 5000 frozen
rooters put their backs to the
wind, their faces to the fire and
rang forth with the "Axe Yell" in
reception to a Big Game victory
prediction by Coach Chuck Tay
lor.
Stanford had not won for nine
years. But on Saturday the pre
diction came true, 19 to 0.
That's history now. Also 'his
tory are many unusual events
Bonfire spirit has kindled and the
many attempts to upset that
spirit that have been tried anci
have failed.
In 1955 there was the flaming
arrow shot at the grand structure
just before it was lighted unsuc
cessful.
In 1953 plans for an intricate
bombing attempt found their way
to the ears of several freshman
sponsors. They warned the men
constructing the bonfire to be on
the lookout for light logs. One
was noticed that didn't look right,
and an investigation instigated. It
was found to enclose an incen
diary time bomb. Some 300 feet
of wiring was uncovered.
After World War II
The Big Game bonfire actually
began as a big project just after-
World War 11. In 1946 the first
sophomore was appointed to take
charge of the construction and
the freshmen started building for
height. A record of 85 feet was
set in 1947.
But pre-game football bonfires,
Big Game and otherwise, have
burned every year since 1898
when a group of Roble women
came up with the idea of using
Lake Lagunita as the scene of a
bonfire.
At the 1904 bonfire, Cal set fire
to the once-sacred "Big C" fence.
The first bonfire-inspired serpen
tine wound through Inner Quad
prior to the 1911 rugby tussle
with Cal.
Time Bomb
The initial time bomb attempt
was made in 1928. In fact it suc
ceeded in leveling the wood a day
before the scheduled burning. Ra
dio appeals went out for more
wood. In one day the structure
was rebuilt and the rally went off
on schedule.
The classical "Doodles" Weaver
led a rally crowd in the "Axe
Yell" in 1935 and the tradition
was firmly implanted. It was the
year that rooters spirited the
"Vow Boys," who as sophomores
vowed never to lose to Cal or
USC, to a 13-0 victory over the
Bear. Doodles returned to the
bonfire in '36 to lead an inspired
; "Nuts to Cal" chant.
"Big Push" starts at noon today.
One of the newer innovations in the colorful history of Stanford
Big Game bonfires, the "Big Push" idea was originated in 1953.
Every freshman on campus will be mustered for this all-out con
struction effort. Work on the giant structure will continue at a

steady pace through the night
and far into Thursday.
And despite the holiday a
crowd of 5000 to 10,000 is ex
pected to be on spirited hand as
Oski is consumed by blight or
ange flames.
In the face of early burnings,
flaming arrows, incendiary time
bombs and any additional plans
Cal could put to the foil, Stanford
student spirit has been rallied by
bonfires for 58 years, and on an
evening prior to Big Game for
almost that long.
