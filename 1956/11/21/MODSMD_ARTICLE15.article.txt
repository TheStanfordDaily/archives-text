# Class Rivalry Caused Big 'C' Construction
## 
### Joan Woods 
Stanford has its tower, and Cal
has its Big C.
For the uninitiated, the Big C
is a 60-foot-long C made of yellow
cement sunk into the hill north of
the campus. It came into exist
ence in 1905 as a result of class
rivalry.
In the early years of this cen
tury Cal faced a rather violent
form of class rushing and hazing.
The "Hillside Gang" was formed
and became important in campus
affairs. They conceived the idea
of constructing a permanent sym
bol of the university in the Berke
ley hills.
It was decided that the Big C
should be made of an enduring
masonry rather than the original
idea of trees. Official approval for
the project came on March 1,1905.
Protest
Actual construction began on
March 20. Protest over the shape,
site, material and color came in
from Berkeley residents, who
feared the C would spoil the
beauty of the hills. Difficulties
were eventually overcome, and
the president of the university
proclaimed an academic holiday
for the freshman and sophomore
classes who were building the C.
Big C is 60 feet in length and
26 feet in width. Eleven steel-re
inforced footings, sunk several
feet into the ground, anchor the C
to the hill. Its size is indicated by
the amount of construction mate
rial that was used—over 24 sacks
of cement, 4 cubic yards of coarse
sand and 7 cubic yards of broken
sand. The structure was covered
with a layer of cement mixed with
yellow ocher.

ters on the day of construction.
Mechanics and engineers came
through with their talents in addi
tion to the manual labor of the
freshmen and sophomores. Me
chanics installed a force pump
with connecting pipe to mix the
concrete, and the engineers pre
pared the site by digging holes,
grading and setting up the con
crete-mixing platform.
Donations
Construction companies donated
wheelbarrows, masonry equip
ment, shovels, picks, lumber, nails
and saws. Additional materials
were bought by the workers them
selves. A bucket brigade was
formed to carry the materials up
the hill.
A bronze plaque was embedded
in the lower slab of the C by the
two classes which built it. The
inscription reads: "In memory of
the Rush, buried by the classes of
1907 and 1908. March 23, 1905.
Requiescat in pace."

Mechanics and engineers came
through with their talents in addi
tion to the manual labor of the
freshmen and sophomores. Me
chanics installed a force pump
with connecting pipe to mix the
concrete, and the engineers pre
pared the site by digging holes,
grading and setting up the con
crete-mixing platform.
Donations
Construction companies donated
wheelbarrows, masonry equip
ment, shovels, picks, lumber, nails
and saws. Additional materials
were bought by the workers them
selves. A bucket brigade was
formed to carry the materials up
the hill.
A bronze plaque was embedded
in the lower slab of the C by the
two classes which built it. The
inscription reads: "In memory of
the Rush, buried by the classes of
1907 and 1908. March 23, 1905.
Requiescat in pace."
Stanford has its tower, and Cal
has its Big C.
For the uninitiated, the Big C
is a 60-foot-long C made of yellow
cement sunk into the hill north of
the campus. It came into exist
ence in 1905 as a result of class
rivalry.
In the early years of this cen
tury Cal faced a rather violent
form of class rushing and hazing.
The "Hillside Gang" was formed
and became important in campus
affairs. They conceived the idea
of constructing a permanent sym
bol of the university in the Berke
ley hills.
It was decided that the Big C
should be made of an enduring
masonry rather than the original
idea of trees. Official approval for
the project came on March 1,1905.
Protest
Actual construction began on
March 20. Protest over the shape,
site, material and color came in
from Berkeley residents, who
feared the C would spoil the
beauty of the hills. Difficulties
were eventually overcome, and
the president of the university
proclaimed an academic holiday
for the freshman and sophomore
classes who were building the C.
Big C is 60 feet in length and
26 feet in width. Eleven steel-re
inforced footings, sunk several
feet into the ground, anchor the C
to the hill. Its size is indicated by
the amount of construction mate
rial that was used—over 24 sacks
of cement, 4 cubic yards of coarse
sand and 7 cubic yards of broken
sand. The structure was covered
with a layer of cement mixed with
yellow ocher.
