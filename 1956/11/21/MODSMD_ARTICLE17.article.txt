# Big Game Gaieties 'Intriguing'

Memorial Auditorium last night, j
Director Walt Brown awl his
Ram's Head crew have put to-1
get her a good show for this;
year's "big" week, but rely. on !
second-act impressions to make a
name for the production.
Gaieties' first stanza lacks 1
much of the spark and color with |
which the show closes. It was
evident, however, that material
ind not direction is responsible
for this lack.
Big Numbers
Back to back in the second act
are Gaieties' two big numbers,
and this is what appears to throw
the show out of balance. "A
Pretty Girl Is Like a Pretty Girl"
and "My Fair Pelvis" are nothing
short of brilliant, and are chal
lenged only by the Russian movie
in the opening division.
Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick
Loewe, collaborators on the "My
Fair Lady" score of Broadway
fame, would probably have en
joyed last night's wonderful farce
as much as the audience did.
Flo Ziegfeld might have felt
something different about the
"Pretty Girl" number, but Gene
Carlson and the lovely ladies of
the cast turn in a fine job, keep
ing alive the inherited laughter
from the Pelvis scene.
Russian Movie
First - act bright spots include
the opener and a satire on a Rus
sian movie. "Look at Yourselves,"
the curtain riser, presents an un
usual beginning to a variety pro
duction, and is backed by good
music and eye-catching stage
work and sets. The chorus does a
I fine job on the Jim Anderson-
Dick Lam I) song.
Music and sets are under the
direction of Bob Christiansen and
Bob Brand. The orchestra isn't at
its peak throughout the perform
ance, and gives the impression
that it hasn't seen some parts of
the score. Paul Harwood has done
a tremendous job in the costume
department. His shining achieve
ment is the "Pretty Girl" display.
Guest Star
Two appearances by the Gaie
ties guest star are pleasant sur
prises. Paul Harwood's imper
sonation of Tallulah is amusing,
but overplayed at times. While
some of his lines fall, the over
all effect is en joyable.
"Four People From . . ." and
"Tennis" are gay numbers in the
first act. Carol McKanna, who
sings the Jim Kason number, is
liable to become the singing hit
of the show.
Park scenes which close the
first act and open the second are
as close to being professional as
the Gaieties gets. A well-trained
and balanced chorus whips
through two numbers, "A Won
derful Day for Singing" and
"Boom Chuck," with the finesse
of old hands.
"Chieongo"
Choreographer Glenn Dußose
comes in for his share of praise
after the "Chieongo" dance se
quence. It's a clever idea, well
staged. Dußose's work with the
precision dancers was also a fine
effort.'
Interspersed throughout the
show are three or four other
numbers which neither add to
nor detract from the. production.
Big Game Gaieties 1956 is a
lively show and offers about two
hours of delightful entertainment.

Flo Ziegfeld might have felt
something different about the
"Pretty Girl" number, but Gene
Carlson and the lovely ladies of
the cast turn in a fine job, keep
ing alive the inherited laughter
from the Pelvis scene.
Russian Movie
First - act bright spots include
the opener and a satire on a Rus
sian movie. "Look at Yourselves,"
the curtain riser, presents an un
usual beginning to a variety pro
duction, and is backed by good
music and eye-catching stage
work and sets. The chorus does a
I fine job on the Jim Anderson-
Dick Lam I) song.
Music and sets are under the
direction of Bob Christiansen and
Bob Brand. The orchestra isn't at
its peak throughout the perform
ance, and gives the impression
that it hasn't seen some parts of
the score. Paul Harwood has done
a tremendous job in the costume
department. His shining achieve
ment is the "Pretty Girl" display.
Guest Star
Two appearances by the Gaie
ties guest star are pleasant sur
prises. Paul Harwood's imper
sonation of Tallulah is amusing,
but overplayed at times. While
some of his lines fall, the over
all effect is en joyable.
"Four People From . . ." and
"Tennis" are gay numbers in the
first act. Carol McKanna, who
sings the Jim Kason number, is
liable to become the singing hit
of the show.
Park scenes which close the
first act and open the second are
as close to being professional as
the Gaieties gets. A well-trained
and balanced chorus whips
through two numbers, "A Won
derful Day for Singing" and
"Boom Chuck," with the finesse
of old hands.
"Chieongo"
Choreographer Glenn Dußose
comes in for his share of praise
after the "Chieongo" dance se
quence. It's a clever idea, well
staged. Dußose's work with the
precision dancers was also a fine
effort.'
Interspersed throughout the
show are three or four other
numbers which neither add to
nor detract from the. production.
Big Game Gaieties 1956 is a
lively show and offers about two
hours of delightful entertainment.

Gaieties' first stanza lacks 1
much of the spark and color with |
which the show closes. It was
evident, however, that material
ind not direction is responsible
for this lack.
Big Numbers
Back to back in the second act
are Gaieties' two big numbers,
and this is what appears to throw
the show out of balance. "A
Pretty Girl Is Like a Pretty Girl"
and "My Fair Pelvis" are nothing
short of brilliant, and are chal
lenged only by the Russian movie
in the opening division.
Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick
Loewe, collaborators on the "My
Fair Lady" score of Broadway
fame, would probably have en
joyed last night's wonderful farce
as much as the audience did.
