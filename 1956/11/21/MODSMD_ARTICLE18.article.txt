# Big Game Show Began in 1892 With Theater Party After Game
## 
### Joan Woods 
The tradition of a Big Game |
Show is almost as old as the Big
| Game itself.
It all started with the second
j Stanford-California game, in 1892. |
; Post-game celebrations were held:
1 in San Francisco each year, and ,
j an important part of the celebra
j tion was a 1 heater party.
The first events were not Stan- j
I ford-produced'shows. The team
and rooters attended a previously j
; selected comedy given by a pro-1
fessional company in some San
Francisco theater. Reservations
| were made in advance and the:
; company adapted lines to suit the
| occasion.
i Stanford - California jokes were
I added and the University colors
I displayed. The Stanford Glee Club
i or the Mandolin Club was often
! asked to participate.
Attendance Unsatisfactory
Attendance at these functions
! proved unsatisfactory. In 1894 a
; Daily editorial said, "Is there not
! inducement enough in the thought
! of seeing our football heroes in
i the proscenium box, in dress suits
and chrysanthemums, to sell a
J theater section?"
| Students were dissatisfied with
j second-class plays, and the next
i year saw the first all - Stanford
production. It was jointly directed
by ihe heads of the orchestra, the
| Glee Club, the Mandolin Club, the
I band and the Vaudeville Club.
On Nov. 18, 1895, The Daily
; warned, "Let there be no attempt
j at coarseness or even a suspicion
j of grossness or vulgarity; for, as
this is practically a Stanford en
tertainment, the reputation of our
: college depends upon the charac
: ter of the show."
The program included "joshes"
on faculty members, the whole
cast on stage to sing the "Drink
| ing Song," skirt dances and a
farce entitled ' Trilby, the Co-ed,
! or Svengali's Forward Pass."
Show Popular
The show proved so popular
I that it was decided to follow the
, same pattern for I he next year.
Troubles developed, however, that
: plagued the Big Game Show for
; the next 10 years. In 1896 a feud
j between campus musical organi
zations was patched up just in
time to permit rehearsals.
In 1897 Ihe show had to be re
cast: as "there was much objection
to permitting University women

to act in San Francisco." Despite i
this drawback, the show grossed '
over $300.
No show was given in 1898; and ]
in 1899, due to the amount of time
necessary to put on a student pro
duction, the Big Game Show re
verted to mere attendance at a
professional performance. Th is
was continued over the next five
years.
The production was first held
on campus in 1905 at the old As
sembly Hall. No good original
play was submitted and a profes
sional play was again adapted for
the occasion. Campus coeds were
so reluctant to participate that no
female chorus was used.
This show proved such a finan
cial success that the tradition of
a Big Game production with all-
Stanford talent was firmly estab
lished.
