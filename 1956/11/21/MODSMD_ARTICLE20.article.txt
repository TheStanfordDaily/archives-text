same plane. The 6-3, 183-pound basketball player has 24 receptions this
season for 315 yards. He is also second in scoring with 31 points. Carl has

71 BARBE2E 218 6-1 LTR 6-2 221 lAUKEA 75
Barbee, a 6-1, 218-pound bruiser, is one of several sophomore linemen who
got his chance to prove himself when the Indians were riddled by injuries
early in the season. Outstanding with the frosh last season, he stepped into
the starting role when Steve Docter and John Kidd were forced out. Kidd
has returned, but has not been able to displace Troy, He has the speed to
play the guard position also and is a very rugged tackier.
A junior college transfer, Curtis laukea broke into the Cal starting lineup
at midseason awl has helfi tight. He is fast for his size.

64 CARSWELL 208 6-0 LCR 5-11 200 JACUZZI 66
Though Donn may not see much action Saturday, he must be listed as
the starting guard. Voted outstanding frosh in 1953, he played 600 minutes
of varsity football prior to this season. His relentless pursuit, tackling and
down-field blocking led to his nomination as All-Coast guard this season.
John Clark, a 5-11, 204-pound junior, has filled in capably since Carswell was
injured in the IJSC game.

54 LONG 200 6 0 C 6-2 220 MATTAROCCI 53
Bob has made a strong return since he was hospitalized by mononucleosis
after (he Michigan State game. Though several eager sophomores made a
strong bid for his slot, the 6-0, 200-pound senior moved right back into the
first string when he got back into condition. Long is an excellent pass pro
tector and a good blocker. He was student member of the Stanford Athletic
Board last year. •
Injured and disabled for the year in last season's opener against Pitts
burgh, Mattarocci was not too heavily counted upon this year. Instead, the
6-2, 215-pound junior has played a majority of the center for Cal. He has
strong competitive ability and is rugged, showing better on defense than
offense.

66 N. ROBINSON* 196 5-9 RCL 6-3 234 CILKEY 61
Like Carswell, Noel was the outstanding player on his frosh team in
1954. The 5-9, 196? pound junior player played 111 minutes last season and
has been a starter when not injured this year. He is a proved pass rusher
and blocker, both in the line and down-field. Robinson is another rugby
player.
Team captain Gilkey is topping off his thii'd season as a Bear regular.
The 6-3, 240 pound senior began this season as the most experienced man
on the squad and appears to have a firm grip on the time-played crown again
this season. Fast for his size, Don is also the squad's No. 1 punter.

79 WIGCiN 228 6-3 RTL 6-4 234 MARTIN 74
Paul has dominated the line play for the Indians for the past two seasons.
AP Ail-American last season, he is a strong candidate again this year. Wig
gin is a high-playing 6-3, 228-pounder who is quick enough and strong enough
to merely toss opposing blockers aside. He is especially effective on defense,
where his tremendous pursuit gains him many tackles on the opposite side
of the line, but he is also a fine blocker. He has stabilized the sophomore
manned line throughout the season.
A rugged 234-pounder, Martin moved right into the starting left-tackle
position after returning from a two-year stint in the Army. Harley, a sopho
more," played on the 1952 California freshman team before entering the
service, where he played on the Eighth Army team. Big and strong, Martin

Another of the outstanding sophomores, Ben Robinson has been called on
for the starting role in place of the injured Gary Van Galder. Seasoned
through play in each game this year, Robinson looms as one of Brodie's
favorite targets.
Ron is a 6-2, 220-pound junior from South Pasadena. He has all the attri
butes of a great football player—speed, size, strength, agility and desire—
and was Cal's nomination for All-American end honors this season. He was

12 BRODIE 192 6-1 QB 6-2 195 KAPP 22
John is the heart of the Stanford offense. Following in the footsteps of
Albert, Kerkorian and Garrett, he has perhaps outdone them all. He has
been the passing and total yardage leader in both the conference and nation
since early in the season. He has gained 1547 yards passing and 1554 yards
offensively this season. The 6-1,192-pound senior is a sure-fire Ail-American,
having already been selected on the Collier's 11.
Kapp, an intense sophomore all-around athlete, stepped into the first
string quarterback role when Gianulias and Contestabile were forced out by
injuries during mid-season. He is a hot-and-cold passer. Joe completed five
out of six in the first half against USC and then none out of seven in Ihe last
half.

32 CAMERA 203 6-1 LHR 5-5 145 BRAZILL 41
Paul was the leading receiver in the nation until a back injury, incurred
in the USC game, limited his play. Nevertheless, he still leads Stanford re
ceivers with 27 receptions for 340 yards. Last season he was second on the
team and in the PCC with 22 catches for 330 yards. Paul is also an excellent
blocker, a prerequisite for the flanker-halfback in the Taylor offense. The
6 1, 203 pound San Franciscan is considered a prime professional candidate.
Brazill, who is the smallest man on the Bear squad, is voted a "complete"
football player by coach Pappy Waldorf. This 5-5, 145-pound halfback sur
prises Bear opponents with his excellent blocking and defensive ability.
