# Card Tricks Date Back to 1905 Game Haltime Festivity

Stanford rooters are generally
credited with being the first, in
the nation to perform card stunts
in the bleachers between halves
of a football game.
The man who started this prac
tice was Thomas Jewell, a civil
engineer, '05. Jewell wrote in the
Stanford Illustrated Review:
"I saw a great blotch of red on
the bleachers resulting from the
rooters' red hats, and it occurred
to me thai it would be possible
lo work out the block letter 'S'
in white.
"That evening 1 discussed Ihe
idea with Roger Nissen, and the
idea appealed to him; the next day
we proposed it to Mr. Thorp, the
yell, leader. It was suggested that
each person silting in the radius
of the letter 'S' be supplied with a
strip of white muslin, and at the
signal from the yell leader this
should be thrown over their hats
and shoulders."
,This stunt was used success
fully at the 1904 Big Game.
By 1928, Rally Committee was
in full swing with all of today's
committee's trials and tribula
tions. According to Leftn Levi, '2R,
Stanford had by then earned the
reputation of having the most ef
ficient looting stunts of any col
lege in the country. This reputa
lion was attested by letters re
ceived from universities in all
parts of the country asking Stan
ford for aid and advice.
Thus it is readily seen that the
history of Stanford card stunts is
a long one. They were at first
just done at Big Game and al the
tJSC game. Now, however', they
have become a usual sight at a I
most all games, not. only at Stan
ford hut al universities through
out the country.
