### 
Fifteen Stanford freshmen fought off hii attempt by 2~> Menlo Jun
ior College students to burn the Big Came bonfire at '1:30 yesterday
morning in a battle thai sent throe men to thr Palo Alto Hospital and
seriously damaged three cars and a truck.
But the defense may have more serious consequences. Dean Wil

i liam Craig said yesterday,"The
dangers to students are becoming
j so great that we might have to
, call the bonfire off."
Regarding future bonfires, he
j said. "The idea of building a big
ger and better bonfire is getting
; out of hand. We should find some
i way to shorten the preliminary
material gathering and guarding
j period when most of the trouble
j occurs. A fire 2'Â» or 30 feet high
would be sufficient."

Chevrolet pickup truck filled
I with Menlo Junior College stu
dents broke through barriers and
j drove toward the bonfire wood.
J The raiders tried to scoop gaso

I of wood, freshmen attacked the
truck. During the fight, a raider
accidentally spilled his gasoline

into flames when a torch was
pitched onto the truck by one of
