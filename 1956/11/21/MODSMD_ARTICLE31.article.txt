# Cal Daily Would Like to Know Whereabouts of Bear 'Mascot'
## 
### Sherry Speer 
Whore is Iho bear?
This question is on Ihe minds
of Cal students and apparently
the bear's creator also. The ani
mal, once the proud possession of
the Cal Daily, was sculptured by
Bentemino Bufano, a little Italian-
American artist who for three dec
ades has been one of San Fran
cisco's best known and most con
troversial artists.
When Bufano tried to give the
bear to the University of Califor
nia in 1941, the university politely
but firmly refused the five-foot
plaster-of-paris and gold leaf ani
mal, enclosed in a gold case.
Eugene Neuhaus, an art profes
sor at the school, was quoted as
saying, "How Bufano can think
that this bear with a broad, flat
lailjike-a beaver, a back of a seal,
ears of a deer, nose of a boar and
its feet encased in German artil
lery boots could ever represent
the California brown bear is be
yond me!"
But the Daily Californian staff
liked the animal and adopted it
for Iheir mascot. During football
season of that year the bear was
a victim of Ihe traditional SI an
ford-California rivalry. Afler a
mysterious five-day. absence, the
animal appeared wilh a note from
Ihe staff of The Stanford Daily
and a missing front toolh. When
Bufano was told of the incident
he said, with a chuckle, "This is
a case of art in action."
During Ihe following years the
mascot suffered further mutila
tions, mainly in Ihe form of hav
ing its ears knocked off periodi
cally. II disappeared again sev
! oral limes, but was always return
| etl, although the identity of the
j "hearnapers" was never ascer
tained.
Around 1950 the bear disappear
ed permanently, and its where
abouts have since remained un

known. Bufano, in a speech to Cal
students in the spring of 1954, ad
mitted lie didn't know where 1 lie
animal was, but offered the stu
dents a new statue, a replica of
the original. This proposal was
enthusiastically accepted, but Bu
fano hasn't been heard from since
and there is still no bear.
The life of Beniamino Bufano is
legendary in the Bay city. Stories
told of him, stories told by him
and actual incidents of his past all
blended into tlie Bufano legend,
so that not even Benny is exactly
sure what happened.
He was born in the small vil
lage of San Fele near Rome, sev
eral years before the turn of Ihe
century. He came to America al
the age of three with his parents.

and actual incidents of his past all
blended into tlie Bufano legend,

sure what happened.
He was born in the small vil

century. He came to America al
the age of three with his parents.
Whore is Iho bear?
This question is on Ihe minds
of Cal students and apparently
the bear's creator also. The ani
mal, once the proud possession of
the Cal Daily, was sculptured by
Bentemino Bufano, a little Italian-
American artist who for three dec
ades has been one of San Fran
cisco's best known and most con
troversial artists.
When Bufano tried to give the
bear to the University of Califor
nia in 1941, the university politely
but firmly refused the five-foot
plaster-of-paris and gold leaf ani
mal, enclosed in a gold case.
Eugene Neuhaus, an art profes
sor at the school, was quoted as
saying, "How Bufano can think
that this bear with a broad, flat
lailjike-a beaver, a back of a seal,
ears of a deer, nose of a boar and
its feet encased in German artil
lery boots could ever represent
the California brown bear is be
yond me!"
But the Daily Californian staff
liked the animal and adopted it
for Iheir mascot. During football
season of that year the bear was
a victim of Ihe traditional SI an
ford-California rivalry. Afler a
mysterious five-day. absence, the
animal appeared wilh a note from
Ihe staff of The Stanford Daily
and a missing front toolh. When
Bufano was told of the incident
he said, with a chuckle, "This is
a case of art in action."
During Ihe following years the
mascot suffered further mutila
tions, mainly in Ihe form of hav
ing its ears knocked off periodi
cally. II disappeared again sev
! oral limes, but was always return
| etl, although the identity of the
j "hearnapers" was never ascer
tained.
Around 1950 the bear disappear
ed permanently, and its where
abouts have since remained un

known. Bufano, in a speech to Cal
students in the spring of 1954, ad
mitted lie didn't know where 1 lie
animal was, but offered the stu
dents a new statue, a replica of
the original. This proposal was
enthusiastically accepted, but Bu
fano hasn't been heard from since
and there is still no bear.
The life of Beniamino Bufano is
legendary in the Bay city. Stories
told of him, stories told by him
and actual incidents of his past all
blended into tlie Bufano legend,
so that not even Benny is exactly
sure what happened.
