# Memorial Stadium Dedicated in 1923
## 
### 
"The House That Andy Built."
That nickname has been given !
to California's Memorial Stadium,
seene of Saturday's Big Game. !
The stadium, dedicated in 1923,
received its epithet from the great
demand to see Andy Smith's Cali j
fornia Wonder Teams of 192-1-25. |
On the home side of the field
is located the Andy Smith Bench,
which was built at the same time
as the stadium.
Inscribed on it are the follow
ing words: "We do not want men
who will lie down bravely to die,
but men who will fight valiantly
to live . . . winning is not every
thing. And ii is far better to play
the game squarely and lose than
to win at the sacrifice of an ideal."
Construction began in Decem
ber, 1922, and cost $1.3 million.
The mammoth stadium, original
ly seating 76,000 and since en
larged to 82,000, was not com
pleted until the eve of the 1923
Big Game.
