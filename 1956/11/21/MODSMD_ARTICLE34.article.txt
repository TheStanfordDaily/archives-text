# Enviable Record for Taylor In Playing, Coaching Years
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
An All-American football play
er, coach of an undefeated fresh
man grid squad and voted "Coach
of the Year" his first season as a
varsity mentor. This, a portion
of an enviable record, only begins
to describe the man, Charles
(Chuck) Taylor.
At the age of 31, Taylor was
appointed head coach of the In
dians. At season's end he had di
rected Stanford t<r the PCC cham
pionship. a Rose Bowl bid and had
been named by his fellow coaches
as "Coach of the Year" — the
youngest coach ever to receive
the honor.
Taylor received his degree at
Stanford in 1943. As a sophomore
he was an All-Coast selection at
guard with the famous "Wow
Boys" of 1940. He was All-Coast
again the next season and was
named All-American in 1942.
Appointed as freshman coach in
1917, Taylor led his teams to 14
victories without a defeat in three
years. His first varsity team roll
ed up nine consecutive wins and
the PCC title, and in 1954 Taylor
coached the West to a 31-7 victory
over the favored East in the
Shrine classic.
Turning out a top-notch football
team is the desire of every coach.
Oflen il is impossible for one man
t<i handle this task alone. It fol
lows. then, that the success of any
team is partly due to the work of
its assistant coaches.
Stanford head coach Chuck
Taylor believes that loyalty is the
prime requisite for any coaching
staff; a team cannot be successful
without this factor. Taylor places
emphasis on the fact that good
coaches must be students of the
game; they must follow the
game's trends.
In third position among his re
quirements, the Cardinal mentor
believes a staff must be "willing,"
a criterion necessary for the long
hours of work il puts in. His own
staff ranks high in all these fea
tures. Taylor believes. "Further,"
lie adfls, "the Indian staff is com
posed of gentlemen."
Dutch Fehring is responsible
for grooming the Indian linemen.
He joined the Stanford athletic
program in 1949. bringing to it
All - American experience gained
at Purdue in 1933-34. In college
Fehring held down the tackle slot
for his Boilermakers.

Also serving on the lino staff is
assistant coach Joe Ruetz. Notre
Dame's teams of 1935-7 saw Ruetz
as a quarterback, a guard and an
Ail-American. Before coming to
the Indians in 1951, Ruetz was
head coach at St. Mary's College.
Cardinal backs come under the
scrutiny of Pete Kmetovic. a Stan
ford man. He played left half for
the "Wow Boys" in 1940 and later
played with the professional Phil
adelphia Eagles and Detroit Lions.
Kmetovic was top man at San
Bernardino Valley College and a
backfield coach at USF before
reaching Stanford in 1950.
An Ohio State quarterback
from 1941 to 1943 tutors the rest
of the back field men. George
Lynn saw service as a backfield
coach at the University of Okla
homa and Kent State before join
ing Chuck Taylor for the 1951
season.
While their primary duties are
handling junior varsity and frosh
ball, respectively, coaches Mai El
ward and Bob Ghilotti are on
{ hand to offer assistance when it
j is necessary.
Elward is a Notre Dame gradu
ate with over 25 years of coaching
| experience. GhiiottW a Farm na
i live, has worked with Taylor since
1949. Ghilotti was a student as-
I sistant then.
This is how the coaching staff
j feels about Big Game, 1956:
Dutch Fehring: "ll'll be a good
game- like they all have been.
: Past records mean nothing, as the
underdog quite often comes out
on top."
George Lynn: "Regardless of
Ihr records, it'll he 'tough.' They
beat us in '51 after we'd won nine
straight. Barring injuries, we
have a 'good chance.' "
Pete Kmetovic: "Big Game is
always tough. Pappy Waldorf and
the Cal team are always 'up' for
jit. It's a real dog fight. Our
chances appear better than usual
| this year."
Mai LI ward: "1 feel it's the great-
Jest tradition this year will be no
different. Don't look at records.
Stanford should win."
Big Game Television?
Application has been made to
i televise Salurday's Pag Game on
a local basis. The NCAA has au
■ thority to approve such a request
since the game is a sell-out.
