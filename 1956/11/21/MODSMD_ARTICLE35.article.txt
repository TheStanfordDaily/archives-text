### 
It was 1947 when the University of California was first recognized
as one of the post-war giants in the national collegiate football scene.
Such a remarkable change of events can be attributed to one man-
Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf.
That year Waldorf took oVer the reins as head coach at the

Berkeley campus and guided the
Golden Bears to nine victories in
10 encounters—this the year after
Cal had registered a 2-7 win-loss
record the previous season.
The next three years were un
doubtedly the high points in Wal
dorf's sparkling career. The Bears
rolled to three consecutive PCC
titles and in that period won 29
games, lost three and tied one.
In 30 years of coaching "Pappy"
has recorded an amazing 169 wins,
94 losses and 16 ties. Only last
year and this season has Waldorf
had a losing team. As head coach
at Oklahoma A&M in 1929-33. he
directed the Aggies to four Mis
souri Valley championships. He
coached at Kansas State one year
and directed that team to the Big
Six title. The next year he jumped
to Northwestern, where he re
mained until 1947.
The 250 - pound Waldorf was
named "Coach of the Year" for
his grid mastery while directing
Cal to the Rose Bowl in 1949.
From 1947 to 1953 he posted a
57-13-3 record at Berkeley.
Along with Waldorf came other
experienced coaches to assist in
the rebuilding tasks. Wes Fry fol
lowed Waldorf from Northwest
ern to handle the backfield coach
ing chores, and Herm Meister
came in 1951 to guide the linemen.
Four- other coaches on the Cal
staff are Jim Lawson, end coach
and former Stanford player; Rod
Franz, former All-American Bear
guard; John Ralston and Carl Van
Ilcuit.
