# 82,000 to See Big Game; Total Attendance 3 Million
## 
### Dick Meister 
I hroughout Big ();imo history the sellout crowd has been the rule,
an 1 this Saturday, when an expected 82,000 fans crush their way into
( alifornia's Memorial Stadium, the all-time Cal-Stanford attendance
figure will he straining at the 3-million mark.
The fit st big one in 1892 drew an overflow mob of IS,OOO fans 1o

a small field in San Francisco,
almost overwhelming Student
Manager Herbert Hoover.
Big Game crowds have been of
capacity size ever since. Accurate
data are not available on attend
ance before 1921, when Stanford
built its huge stadium. All that's
certain is that the games were
usually sellouts.
In 1921, 60,000 rooters filled
Stanford Stadium for dedication
ceremonies and s t ay e d on to
watch Cal's Wonder Team cn'.sh
Stanford, 42-7. The Stanford Daily
summed it up tersely: "Saturday
a football machine smashed a
football team."
24 Sellouts 1
In the 32 Big Games since that
stadium opener, only eight have
failed to fill the standsâ€” at Stan
ford or Cal. The 1932 to 1935
crowds were below par because of
the Depression, and the 1939-1942
crowds were smaller because me
diocre talent and the threat of
war kept some fans at home.
Largest crowds in game his
tory have turned out at Stanford's
90,000-capacity stadium. Califor
nia's Memorial Stadium seats ap
proximately 82,000.
Smallest crowd since 1921 turn
ed out for the '39 game. Some
55,000 came to Stanford Stadium
to watch the low men in the Pa
cific Coast Conference battle for
the cellar spot. The Indians en
tered the game winless. Cal had
won only two games that season,
but managed to beat hapless Stan
ford. 32-14.
Big Game crowds have provided
strong incentive for both univer
sities to enlarge their stadiums to
accommodate the capacity-taxing
mobs each year. In 1927 Stanford
enlarged its stadium from a 60.000
top figure to 83.000 capacity and
through the years has made en
largements to reach the present
90,000 limit.
Capacity Increased
In 1928 Cal increased Memorial
Stadiums' capacity to its present
82,000 figure.
Figured in money terms, it's dif
ficult to determine what the over
flow crowds have netted Big
Game rivals, but it's certain that
more than .$5 million has poured
through gatekeepers' hands in the
64 years since the first Stanford-
Cal battle.
And the elements of the s e
crowds?
The old alums who never quite
forget their four years of "Hate
Stanford!" or "Hate Cal!" agita
tion; the would-be alums who
yearly pull for their adopted uni
versity Red and White or Blue
and. Gold; the swarms of young
sters who can't wait to grow up
to be a "Stanford man" or a "Cal
man"; and Ihe rooters, students
and others, whose frantically par
tisan yells help make Big Game
the sellout spectacle it's been
since the beginning.
Stadium Hawkers
There are the innumerable sta
dium hawkers; the advertisers
with their "Big Game specials";
the newspapers and their Big
Game editions; the spots
and their Big Game parties; and
the traffic cops and t heir tickets
for the inevitable parking viola
tions that come with the sellout
crowd.
