# Card Soccer Team Faces California In Season Finale
## 
### jack Winkler 
There is no A\s at stake when
Stanford's soccer team faces the
California Bears, but there is still
the opportunity to "beat Cal" and
finish above the Bears in the final
conference standings when the
Cardinal 11 treks to Berkeley for
the final game of the season this
Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
The Bears have a pair of high
scoring insides in Joe Muscat, a
transfer from City College of San
Francisco, and Pablo Dibos, who
has been on a season-long scoring
spree.
In earlier games this season Cal
lost to CCSF, 2-0, the squad that
beat Stanford, 4-0. They held Uni
versity of British Columbia to a
2-1 loss, while ÃœBC mopped up
Stanford, 9-1. Yet the Bears were
held to a tie by San Francisco
State, a team Stanford beat eas
ily, 4-1.
The starting lineup is still in
doubt, but will probably include
Bill Ditman in goal, with the
backs being chosen from Art Har
low, Jack Benjamin and Otto Jo
chems.
The halfback line includes Dave
Brant, Jim Bowditch, John Leon
ard and co-captain Peter Mack.
The forward line will probably
start Eduardo Maal, Ben Pentsil,
co-captain Bill Wren, Mike Asafo-
Boakyne and Ned Avary. How
ever, Kiev Larsen. Josef Javari,
Tony Chandler, Bob Shafer and
Jack Winkler will all see action.
