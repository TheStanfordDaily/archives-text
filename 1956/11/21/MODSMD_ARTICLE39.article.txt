# Wiggin, Brodie Head List In All-American Selection
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Tackle Paul Wiggin of Stanford
was the only unanimous choice
among 11 All-Americans selected
for The Daily's 1956 Collegiate
Dream Team.
Eight schools from all sections
of the country were represented
on the all-star team, picked by 11
sports scribes of The Daily.
Two backs and two other line
men each missed by only one vote
of being unanimous selections.
Joining Wiggin was his teammate,
Stanford quarterback John Bro
die. Tailback Johnny Majors of
Tennessee, end Ron Kramer of
Michigan and guard Jim Parker
of Ohio State were the other three
td garner 10 votes.
Arnett Named
One other player from the PCC,
halfback Jon Arnett of Southern
California, was selected. The
fourth member of the dream back
field was Tommy McDonald, the
top scorer for unbeaten and un
tied Oklahoma.
Bob Ripple was the first Ohio
University man to make the team.
The two-time Little All-American
was named at end. George Appel
of Columbia was picked at the
other tackle spot, with guard Stan
Slater of Army and center Jerry
Tubbs of Oklahoma making up
the remainder of the line.
.Brodie and Wiggin — the two
Stanfordites named—fulfilled all
expectations that were held for
them at the beginning of the sea
son. For Wiggin it was the sec
ond year he has been an All-Amer
ican.
Brodie is following in the tra
dition set by a long line of great
passing quarterbacks at Stanford.
Since coming into his own during
the second half of last year's Stan
ford-UCLA game, Brodie has con
tinually befuddled opponents with
his aerial wizardry.
Wiggin and Brodie are the 17th
and 18th All-Americans from
Stanford since 1924 and find them
selves in distinguished company.
Brodie is the third Indian quarter
back since 1910 to be acclaimed
the best in the nation.
Albert First QB
Frankie Albert, college foot
ball's first great T-formation pass
er, reaped All-American honors in
1940 and 1941 and led Stanford to
the 1941 Rose Bowl championship.
The second of the quarterbacks
was Bob Garrett, an All-American
in 1953. Garrett's greatness was
acknowledged by football's aerial
masters —the professionals—when
he was selected as the pro draft's
bonus choice, an honor that is
also expected to go to Brodie.
The best years for All-Ameri
cans at Stanford were 1934 and
1935, when the same four men
were named both years. The
"Vow Boys" of those years were
led by fullback Bob Grayson, end
Monk Moscrip, halfback Bones
Hamilton and tackle Bob Reyn
olds, each of whom was recog
nized as the best in the country
at his position.
First All-Americans
Stanford's first All-Americans
were Jim Lawson and Ernie Nev
ers of the 1924 squad. Lawson,
an end, captained that team and
was one of the heroes of the 20-20
tie in the Big Game—a game rec
ognized as the greatest comeback
in Stanford football history.

also expected to go to Brodie.
The best years for All-Ameri
cans at Stanford were 1934 and
1935, when the same four men

Monk Moscrip, halfback Bones

Stanford's first All-Americans

All-American to Play in Last Bij;- Game
Tackle Paul Wiggin of Stanford
was the only unanimous choice
among 11 All-Americans selected
for The Daily's 1956 Collegiate
Dream Team.
Eight schools from all sections
of the country were represented
on the all-star team, picked by 11
sports scribes of The Daily.
Two backs and two other line
men each missed by only one vote
of being unanimous selections.
Joining Wiggin was his teammate,
Stanford quarterback John Bro
die. Tailback Johnny Majors of
Tennessee, end Ron Kramer of
Michigan and guard Jim Parker
of Ohio State were the other three
td garner 10 votes.
Arnett Named
One other player from the PCC,
halfback Jon Arnett of Southern
California, was selected. The
fourth member of the dream back
field was Tommy McDonald, the
top scorer for unbeaten and un
tied Oklahoma.
Bob Ripple was the first Ohio
University man to make the team.
The two-time Little All-American
was named at end. George Appel
of Columbia was picked at the
other tackle spot, with guard Stan
Slater of Army and center Jerry
Tubbs of Oklahoma making up
the remainder of the line.
.Brodie and Wiggin — the two
Stanfordites named—fulfilled all
expectations that were held for
them at the beginning of the sea
son. For Wiggin it was the sec
ond year he has been an All-Amer
ican.
Brodie is following in the tra
dition set by a long line of great
passing quarterbacks at Stanford.
Since coming into his own during
the second half of last year's Stan
ford-UCLA game, Brodie has con
tinually befuddled opponents with
his aerial wizardry.
Wiggin and Brodie are the 17th

Brodie is the third Indian quarter
back since 1910 to be acclaimed
the best in the nation.
