## 
### 
This Saturday another great Stanford quarterback hangs up his
togs after his last Big Game. In 1941 it was Frankie Albert, in 1951
it was Gary Kerkorian, in 1953 it was Bobby Garrett and this year
it's John Brodie.
Brodie, selected this week on the football coaches' first-team All-

America — generally ranked the
top pick—has surpassed his three
Stanford predecessors in the pass
ing department.
This year the talented aerial
artist completed 130 of 221 passes
for a 58.8 percentage, tops in the
nation. He leads the country in
total offense, too, with 1546 yards
gained, 1541 in the air, and has
connected for 11 touchdowns.
In his sophomore year Brodie
completed 81 of 163 passes for 937
yards (49.6 per cent). As a junior
he led his team and the Pacific
Coast Conference both in passing
and total offense by completing
76 passes out of 133 attempts (57.1
per cent) for 1024 yards and five
touchdowns.
This year in the Stanford tri
umph over USC, Brodie cinched
the Indian win with two scoring
passes and a touchdown plunge.
Against Michigan State his five
accurate completions touched off
a sensational 80-yard touchdown
drive against the then undaunted
Spartans. Brodie had Ohio State
plenty worried when ho complet
ed 21 of 35 passes for 256 yards
and two touchdowns.
Against UCLA. Brodie's long
50-yard pass to Mickey Raftery
led to a Stanford touchdown after
another long pass.
Although Stanford lost to OSC,
Brodie, in the first and second
quarters, completed seven consec
utive passes. His total air yard
age for the day was 223 yards.
In the Wasliington-Stanford tan
gle Brodie completed an amazing
20 passes out of 26 tries, making
his average for this year 58.8 per
cent—an all-time Stanford high.
After graduation he would like to
play pro football and go into the
insurance business, although he
says,"I will probably have to go
into the Army."
