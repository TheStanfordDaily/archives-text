# Cal, Indians Deadlocked In 54 Games
## 
### Dean Stewart 
Down through the years the
California - Stanford game ha. 1
?rown in stature. Playing before
capacity crowds a I every gamt
since the conception of the rivalry
in 1892, the "Big Game," as thÂ»
contests have been labeled, ha:
certainly proved no misnomer.
Although the Big Game is not
the oldest rivalry or the longest
it might justifiably lay claim tc
the most even series. Since the
92 opener Stanford has won 2
contests, California has also wor
24, and the amazing number o'
10 ties has occurred in the 54
game series.
Whenever old grads get togeth
er and discuss Big Games the}
are seldom in agreement about
which was the best Big Game
The most recent thriller that
sticks out in the minds of many
is the 1947 classic.
Cal Lost One
California had lost only one
game that year under new head
coach Lynn "Pappy" Waldorf.
Cal's one loss had been to a strong
USC outfit. Stanford, on the other
hand, was enjoying its worst sea
son.
Playing way over their heads,
Stanford used guts and spirit to
almost pull what would have been
the greatest upset in the Big
Game's 54-game history. Leading,
18-14, with time running out, in
the fourth quarter, Stanford seem
ingly had the game sewed up.
However, a long pass-scoring play,
usually described as intramural,
won the game for Cal, 21-18.
There are other games that
were equally exciting to others.
One was the 1950 7-7 tie. This
contest featured" spectacular
catches by Ail-American end Bill
McColl, a Stanford touchdown
called back and a long, long Mc-
Coll pass that just missed the
finger tips of speedy trackman
Bobby Bryan, who was in the
game for just that one play.
20-20 Tie
However, the Big Game that
really puts the old grads in a
nostalgic mood is the 20-20 tie of
1924.
Cal had run up a string of 47
games without a defeat. Stanford,
under new coach Glenn "Pop"
Warner, was working on a seven
game winning streak. The winner
of this natural was to play the
Four Horsemen of Notre Dame in
the Rose Bowl.
Playing without the great Ernie
Nevers and halfback Norm Cleve
land, Cal was a slight favorite.
However, the Cards led, 6-0, at
half-time on two field goals by
little Murray Cuddeback. Warner
had been strongly criticized for
using Cuddeback because he had
gained only 7 yards from scrim
mage during Stanford's three con
ference games.
Cal dominated play for the first
25 minutes of the second half.
They led, 20-6, with just five min
utes remaining in the game.
The stage was set for the great
est comeback in Stanford's his
tory. Reserve back Ed Walker
passed to end Ted Shipkey for
the Cards' first touchdown. Mo
ments later Walker hit Cuddeback
with a TD pass. Cuddeback scored
his 14th point of the game by
again kicking the extra point to
tie up the ball game.
