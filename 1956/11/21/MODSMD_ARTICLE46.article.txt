# Bright Outlook For'57 Season With Returnees
## 
### 
Now that the nine-year draught
has ended, the "Wait till next
year!" cry has been redirected
from the Big Game to the bigger
one the Rose Bowl.
Though he is not to be envied,
because of the tremendous pres
sure felt by a coach whose team 1
will be a pre-season choice to take
the championship, Chuck Taylor j
cannot be anything but happy
when he looks at the list of 20
lettermen who will be returning
next fall.
Add to these the bulk of a
strong JV squad and the most
successful freshman team since
1950, and even the staunchest pes
simist will have to agree that the
1957 Indians will be logical con
tenders for PCC laurels and the!
ensuing post-season^g*ime.
Best news of all is the long list
of seasoned linemen who will be
back next fall. For the first time
since Taylor's arrival on .the
Farm, there will be no "thin" po- i
sitions in the line.
Russ Steele and Roch Conklin
at center, Meigs Jones and Bob
Peterson at guard, Ty Polich and
Troy Barbee at tackle and ends
Garry Van Galder, Ben Robinson
and Joel Freis return as seasoned
veterans.
Among other outstanding pros
pects back next year are linemen
John Kidd, Chris Plain, Eric Pro
tiva, Armand DeWeese, Larry Es
chelman and Dick Stein. In the
backfield are quarterbacks Jackie
Douglas, Jack Taylor and Bob Ni
colet and a host of r unne rs,
among whom are A 1 Harrington,
Doug Dick, Lou Valli, Archie
Schmitt, Bob Schmidt, Jeri McMil
lin, Chuck Shea and Roy Stephen.
