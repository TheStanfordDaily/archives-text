# Liebendorfer Says Cal Tilt Is 'The'Game
## 
### 
"I would rather heal Cal than
any other team. It is always our
most important game. No matter
what our schedule is or how the
season has gone, it is always THE
big game."
Those are a few of the rapid
fire statements delivered by Don
Liebendorfer, news service direc
tor, in a recent interview. Having
been connected with Stanford ath
letics since 1925, Liebendorfer is
probably the most qualified au
thority on the Indian sports scene.
"This year's team hasn't played
its best game yet," he said. "I
expect to beat Cal. They've had
a bad season, but you can bet
they'll play their greatest game
against us. They always do. We're
going to have to play our best
game to beat them
Four Top Teams
"Four of the teams we played
this year were right up in the top
10 or 20, and three of them Mich
igan State, Ohio State and Oregon
State are still in the top 10. We
have had a real tough schedule
this season, and I just didn't see
how we could improve our 195.1
record. But that's the way Chuck
[Taylor] wanted it. You can't
learn anything by playing weak
teams all the time.
"Next year I think we'll do all
right. We lose seven of the 11
probable starters against Cal. On
the other hand, we only lose about
three off the next two teams.
"Our frosh outfit is a good
team. Not a great one, but a good
team. There are several men who
should help the varsity. Then, too,
our schedule is not quite as diffi
cult. We drop Michigan State and
Ohio State. We add Northwestern
and Rice."
Asked to reflect on past Big
Games, Liebendorfer still held
that for him the 1947 Big Came
was his favorite, even better than
the famous 20-20 tie of 1924.
"The '47 contest was thrilling
from start to finish. We didn't
win it, but it still gets my vote as
the No. 1 Big Game. [California
had an 8-1 seasonal record* and
were heavy favorites over winless
Stanford. Only a desperate touch
down pass play in the closing min
utes gave Cal a 21-18 win.]
"The '24 game was very dull
except for the last five minutes.
Stanford hadn't come close to a
touchdown until then. We had
two first-half field goals. Other
wise it was all Cal. They pushed
us all' over the field. And if they
hddn't gotten cocky and pulled
their two top backs out of the
game in the fourth quarter, Stan
ford probably wouldn't have been
able to come back.
"It's the Rules"
"Under the rules, you couldn't
go back into the game during a
quarter you had already played
in. Of course, the climax was
really unbelievable. Two touch
downs and conversions in five
minutes by passing. It was even
more amazing in those days of
slower power football.
"Many left' the game early so
they could get a good place in line
for the ferry to San Francisco.
When they left, the game was al
most over with Cal leading, 20-6.
It must have been quite a shock
to read the newspaper headlines
across the bay in Frisco only to
find that Stanford had rallied to
tie the score.
"It was quite a finish, all right.
But I'm sure I've seen a great
number of games that were more
exciting, taken on the basis of the
whole game. However, because of
that finish and the place it has
attained in the memories of so
many, I have to rank it as the
No. 2 Big Game."
