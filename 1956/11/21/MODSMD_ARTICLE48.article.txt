# All-American Paul Wiggin Is Indestructible Rock in Line
## 
### Dean Stewart 
In a season marred with inju
ries, Paul Wiggin's No. 79 stood
out like an indestructible rock in
Stanford's forward wall. Again
and again the coaching staff was
forced to make replacements in
the Card line. But always there
was No. 79 standing, from which
they could build.
"Because of his great ability,"
said line coach Joe Ruetz, "we
always asked Wiggin to cover a
much larger area than is normal
for any player, especially a tackle.
Sometimes on defense we expect
ed him to cover the whole side of
the other team's line.
"Wiggin is definitely rated the
best tackle we've had here at
Stanford in the last five years.
Every team we've played has had
to put two men on Paul, yet no
club succeeded in stopping him."
Al* All-American
Ln recognition of his greatness,
Wiggin was chosen first - string
All-American tackle last year by
the Associated Press.. He was also
chosen the "Outstanding Lineman
of Northern California" by both
the Touchdown Club of San Fran
cisco and the Northern California
Sports Writers.
Perhaps the greatest tribute
given Wiggin was that of Paul
Brown, coach of the professional
football Cleveland Browns. Know
ing full well that Wiggin wouldn't
be available for another year,
Brown wanted Wiggin so much
that he went ahead and used up
a choice so as not to take a chance
on losing Wiggin,
"I would like to play pro foot
ball," says Wiggin, "but my draft
board has first call on me. It will
depend on what they do as to

whether I'll play pro football or
not. I imagine the Browns will
use me as a defensive end, as Tm
not big enough for a pro tackle."
Wiggin has the ideal build for
a college tackle—6-3 in height and
228 pounds. Trainer Connie Jar
vis rates Wiggin as one of the
best all-around physical specimens
he has ever seen.
"He is one or the ;>est pursuit
tackles I have ever seen," said
Jarvis. ' Paul makes tackles clear
on the other side of the field on
plays where the average tackier
wouldn't even be near. Paul has
such quick reactions that even
when he is blocked correctly he
still is able to recover and make
the tackle."

the Card line. But always there
was No. 79 standing, from which
they could build.
"Because of his great ability,"
said line coach Joe Ruetz, "we
always asked Wiggin to cover a
much larger area than is normal
for any player, especially a tackle.
Sometimes on defense we expect
ed him to cover the whole side of
the other team's line.
"Wiggin is definitely rated the
best tackle we've had here at
Stanford in the last five years.
Every team we've played has had
to put two men on Paul, yet no
club succeeded in stopping him."
Al* All-American
Ln recognition of his greatness,
Wiggin was chosen first - string
All-American tackle last year by
the Associated Press.. He was also
chosen the "Outstanding Lineman
of Northern California" by both
the Touchdown Club of San Fran
cisco and the Northern California
Sports Writers.
Perhaps the greatest tribute
given Wiggin was that of Paul
Brown, coach of the professional
football Cleveland Browns. Know
ing full well that Wiggin wouldn't
be available for another year,
Brown wanted Wiggin so much
that he went ahead and used up
a choice so as not to take a chance
on losing Wiggin,
"I would like to play pro foot
ball," says Wiggin, "but my draft
board has first call on me. It will
depend on what they do as to

whether I'll play pro football or
not. I imagine the Browns will
use me as a defensive end, as Tm
not big enough for a pro tackle."
Wiggin has the ideal build for
a college tackle—6-3 in height and
228 pounds. Trainer Connie Jar
vis rates Wiggin as one of the
best all-around physical specimens
he has ever seen.
"He is one or the ;>est pursuit
tackles I have ever seen," said
Jarvis. ' Paul makes tackles clear
on the other side of the field on
plays where the average tackier
wouldn't even be near. Paul has
such quick reactions that even
when he is blocked correctly he
still is able to recover and make
the tackle."

Cleveland Wants Him; So Does the Army
In a season marred with inju
ries, Paul Wiggin's No. 79 stood
out like an indestructible rock in
Stanford's forward wall. Again
and again the coaching staff was
forced to make replacements in
the Card line. But always there
was No. 79 standing, from which
they could build.
"Because of his great ability,"
said line coach Joe Ruetz, "we
