## Or how to "strike oil" twice in the same place 
### 
"C
uome people believe that the more govern
ment has to say about business, the better.
"They argue, for instance, that the petroleum
industry ought to be under more government
control to keep America from running out of oil.
"What they forget is that it's just good busi
ness for oilmen to produce a property effi
ciently. We get more oil from a well when it is

operated at its best rate of flow. This is one of
the ways of conserving this natural resource!
l/'Take Dominguez field in California. Union
and another company discovered oil there
back in 1923.
"By 1936 oil production reached a peak of
almost 31,000 barrels a day. But by 1947 our
dailv rate had declined to about 15,000 barrels.

"To get the most out of the field, we started
waterflooding some areas. In our most recent
project—which was started with the coopera
tion of the landowners and the other companies
operating the field —we injected more than
7,000,000 barrels of water into 17 wells. 'J'his
has forced oil out of 21 producing wells.
"As a result, we are now pumping 2,800 bar
rels of crude every day from these wells —an
increase of 2,200 barrels a day over what we'd
normally expect without waterflooding.
"You show me how government control could
have added one barrel of oil to our production.
Or conserved the pool any better so we can
recover more oil in the future with methods
yet to be developed!"

Harry Aggers—who has been with Union Oil
lor 22 years—manages our secondary recovery
operations.
He believes that by 1975, at least 25% of all
t nited States oil production will be by water
-1 looding. I his does not include secondary
recovery by gas injection or by methods yet
to be developed.
The Dominguez results demonstrate again
how efficiently a free oil industry achieves
maximum economic production from a lield,
while conserving the source of the oil.
