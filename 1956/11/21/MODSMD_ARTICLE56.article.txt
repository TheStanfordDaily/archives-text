For those Stanford rooters who i
will be watching a foothill game
for the first time Saturday or
for those of you who have
watched the great American
sport before but still don't know
one end of the football from the
other this article is a must.
It's easy, really. Just look at
three different places at once
tlie line (particularly Ihe guards i.
the backs and the football.
Now anyone knows you can't
watch all these things at the
same instant. To solve this prob
lem, Coach Bud Wilkinson i who
has done some pretty nifty things
with a football team down Okla
homa way) has I his to say:
Cast your eyes over, the line
charge for the first couple of
seconds before the ball is snap-j
ped.
In thai instant you can usually
tell what type of play .the offen
sive team (the one with the ball)
is running and what type of do
fense the defenders are employ
ing.
If the offensive linemen on the
left side of Ihe line charge across
the scrimmage into the second
ary, look for a run to the right.
If the linemen on the rigid side
break across, the chances are that
the running play is going lo Ihe
left. The men who break across

the line of scrimmage are headed
out to block a man in the defen
sive secondary (backfield to you).
If none of Ihe linemen cross the
scrimmage, the odds are good
that a pass is coming. Linemen
may not go down the field on a
pass except in the special case of
i tackle eligible play, where the
ends drop back a step or two and
the tackle becomes an eligible re
ceiver.
At the start of pass plays, you
can also tell what type of general
defensive maneuver is being em
ployed. Wilkinson says the defen
sive line either charges or "plays
it cozy." Usually some linemen
charge and some play it cozy. Hut
a majority will be doing one ma
neuver and will do it on a major
ity of plays.
Those are a couple of trends

yiui can discover hy watching the
linemen as the oall is snapper!.
In doing this you won't lose track
of the ball. In fact, knowing
which way the play is going may
hcip you pin down the ball carrier
more easily.
Another method of getting a
quick insight on the direction of
.'he offensive attack is to follow
ihc guard. Many systems use tho
guard as the lead blocker for the
bail carrier.
As the game progresses, re
memljcr what the previous plays
have brought. Notice trends
where the offense gains consist
ently, what type of plays result
in big gainers, who is making tho
bulk of the tackles. With this
Knowledge, you can begin to un
derstand the tactical aspects of
carrying on a football battle.
