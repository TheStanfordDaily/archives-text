# LIVES ENDANGERED
## Pyre Blazed On Thursday Despite It All 
### 
During the past week lives of
Stanford and Menlo College stu
dents were twice endangered as a
result of the building of the 1956
bonfire at Lake Lagunita.
Plagued all week, beginning
with the burning of a gasoline
soaked pick-up truck, and ending
with the premature lighting of
the bonfire Thursday morning,
the freshman class finally suc
ceeded in building another bon
fire that was burned on schedule
at the rally Thursday evening.
The trouble came to a head at
about 4 Thursday morning. Just
after they had watched the last
worker climb down from the top
of the bonfire, someone called,
"We've got smoke!"
Fire Truck Stalls
Shocked into action, guards
rushed to their 1000-gallon water
truck to put out the fire.
It stalled.
When they were finally in a
position to fight the blaze, the
fire was too far advanced to
quench. The fire department
sped two trucks to the scene, but
they were equally helpless.
"It was done by some kind of
c hem ic a 1 bomb, probably by
someone who was working all
night with the builders, and who
just got close enough with the
right material," said Bob Roberts,
bonfire chairman.
"This year the bonfire was a
headache," said Stanford Fire
Chief John Marston.
The day before the bonfire was
scheduled there were ten alarms
sent from the lake area, he .said.
Human Torches
"I was really Concerned with
the burning of the truck Tues
day," he said. "If that file had
got on any kids they would have
been human torches."
At 1 Tuesday morning 20 fresh
men, def en ding their work
against '5.1 Menlo College stu
dents, accidentally set on fire a
pick-up truck driven by the in
vaders.
Since I lie bonfire tradition
started at Stanford in 1898, there
was only one other successful
premature burning in 1928. An
attempt was made a few years
ago If) set it off early, but the fire
department was tipped off and
saved the fire.
Dean William Craig said, "We
have to figure some way to short
en the initial period of fire build
ing to a day or two. This way we
can perpetuate the tradition if the
students want it. 1 will request
that Cardinals look into the mat
ter to see what they can do about
it."
