## Big Game Features Duel Between Valli, Kapp; Bear 11 Scores First Three rimes It Gets Ball 
### Jerry Kelly Sports Editor 
Stanford's about-face i's complete.
In four weeks the Indians, once rated "sure fire" favorites to win
the Rose Bowl nod, have turned around and jost everything. Satin
day afternoon at Memorial Stadium, Berkeley, it was complete. Stan
ford had lost the Big Game and with it the Axe.
For the third time in four weeks, Coach Chuck Taylor's warrior .

went down to defeat via the point
after-touchdown route. The Cali
fornia Bears left Card followers
with nothing to cheer about in
shutting the lid on Stanford in
the 59th Big Game, 20-18, before
81.400 fans.
Saturday's Rig Game will go
down in history as one of the
most exciting. It was a great vic
tory for California and a fitting
tribute to their departing coach,
Lynn (Pappy t Waldorf. It was
an upset, but when Stanford and
Cal meet, upsets are common.
Heartbreaking Loss
Saturday's loss was a heart
breaker for co-captains John Bro
die and Paul Wiggin, for half
backs Paul Camera and Gordy
Young, for end Carl Isaacs, guard
Donn Carswell and center Bob
Long. It was their last Big Game
the one they wanted to win
above everything else.
It was a heartbreaker for full
back Lou Valli, the 1715-pound dy
namite who was tlie shining light
in the Card offense. Valli sped
for 209 yards in 23 carries in "giv
ing his all." But he'll get another
chance next year.
It was disheartening too for
Coach Taylor, his staff and the
players who had worked so hard
and long this season. And the
fans too took their bumps.
That Extra Point
All learned the hard way the
importance of that extra point
after a touchdown. First it was
UCLA, 14-13, then Oregon State,
20-19, finally Cal. 20-18.
Bad breaks have been common
on the Farm football scene all
season. Injuries riddled the line,
key fumbles stopped many a long
drive.
Saturday the Bears in taking
the edge in the Big Game series,
25-24 with 10 ties, recovered three
Card fumbles; a Brodie • to - Ca
mera pass, good for a TD, was
called back and a long Brodie ae
rial, hitting the chest of its in
tended receiver, was dropped on
the goal line.
Inspired Cal Team
This is not to take anything
away from an inspired California
team. The Bears, displaying a
blazing first-half attack behind
the brilliant quarterbacking of
sophomore Joe Kapp, tallied the
first three times they had the
ball. The Indians couldn't control
the lightning attack.
Waldorf's charges took the
opening kickoff and marched 07
yards in 10 plays with Kapp,
Herb Jackson, Darrell Roberts
and Jack Hart taking turns on
the ground. Jackson, Cal's hard
hitting senior, crashed over from
two yards out for the game's first
counter. Roberts kicked the PAT.
Stanford, getting the ball for
the first time, began rolling at
the onset with Valli and Young
gaining consistently. Brodie. how
ever, fumbled a handoff on the
Cal 37 and the Boars started TD
march number two.
In the 43 - yard drive Kapp
mixed his plays, consistently
crossed up the Card defense with
up-t he-middle keeps, wide swings
and reverses and carried himself
for 28 yards on one carry. Rob
erts leaped over for the second
TI) from one yard out, succeeded
on his second PAT and Cal led
14-0 in the initial period.
Seems Stanford has a habit of
getting behind at the outset and
this was no exception. But the
Cards settled down and began to
roll offensively. The huge crowd
was up and flown with every play
as Brodie engineered Stanford's
first TD.
A screen pass to Valli was good
for 28. The little charger carried
the Indians to the M with succes
sive runs of 15, nine and two
yards. .Jeri McMillin on the next
play raced wide around right end
for the tally.
Bad Center Pass
Even at this point the crowd
sensed the importance of Stan
ford's try-for-poijit. a bad pass
from center, a fast-charging Bear
line and Mickey Raflery's at
tempt went wide.
Whether Cal's Kapp or the In
dians' VaHi was the most out
standing player in the packed sta
dium Saturday is debatable.
This time it was Kapp's turn to
lake over again. The Card de
fense got tougher, but Cal was
not to be denied and rallied a
third time for its final score.
On the March
Kapp threw for 18, handed off
to Hart and Jackson for consist
ent gains and carried himself on
an end sweep from the 10 to the
Stanford one.
Hart plowed through the left
side for the counter and Cal led,
20-6, early in the second quarter.
The Cal rooters went frantic.
All-American Brodie pulled the
Stanfords together for their sec

ond successful drive. A pass to
lien Robinson was good for 10.
Valli cut through the line and
broke for 3j and the Indians were
in scoring position once more. It
was Valli 11 on a pitch
out, Brodie for one and a Brodie
pass to Robinson for the score.
Raftery's kick went wide and
the first half, loaded with action,
closed with CaJ leading, 2012.
Stanford's defense was mark
edly improved in the second half.
The Bears were forced to punt on
six occasions and failed to threat
en.
f'al Holds
The Tribe took the kickoff and
marched G6 yards to the Bear 13
before California held.
After a series of exchanges,
Stanford moved to the Bear 17
with a first down. Brodie, .racing
the width of the field with Cal
linemen in pursuit, spotted Ca
mera in the clear. Camera took
the soft pass on the four and fell
over the goal line.
But a backfield in motion pen
alty nullified the TD and before
the Cards knew it, they had
fourth flown with 47 to go.
• Drops TD Toss
Early in the fourth quarter
Joel Freis dropped a beautiful ae
rial on the goal line- one of Bro
die's longest passes of the season.
Moments later, Valli spurted 14
yards through a host of Cal de
fenders for Stanford's third score.
Cal 20, Cards 18.
In completing nine passes, Bro
die, having one of his poorer
flays, broke a PCC record set by
Don Heinrich of Washington.
Brodie has connected on 139 ae
rials in 10 games, two more than
Heinrich's 1952 record.
And so the 59th Big Game goes
to California. Stanford, in losing
to the Bears, finished a disap
pointing season with four wins as
opposed to six losses. Only the
gate receipts can bring on a half
smile.

TRIPPED UP —Stanford's churning fullback Lou Valli is tripped
up after one of his many gains in Saturday's Big Game loss to
California. Making the tackle is an unidentified Bear lineman.
Valli put on perhaps the finest performance of his career before
81,400 fans in Memorial Stadium. The San Jose speedster slammed
the Cal line to shreds in racking up 209 yards in 28 carries for
an average of nearly 10 yards a trip. Valli is a junior.
