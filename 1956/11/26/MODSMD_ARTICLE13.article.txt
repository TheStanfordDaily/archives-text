Stanford's about-face i's complete.
In four weeks the Indians, once rated "sure fire" favorites to win
the Rose Bowl nod, have turned around and jost everything. Satin
day afternoon at Memorial Stadium, Berkeley, it was complete. Stan
ford had lost the Big Game and with it the Axe.
For the third time in four weeks, Coach Chuck Taylor's warrior .

went down to defeat via the point
after-touchdown route. The Cali
fornia Bears left Card followers
with nothing to cheer about in
shutting the lid on Stanford in
the 59th Big Game, 20-18, before
81.400 fans.
Saturday's Rig Game will go
down in history as one of the
most exciting. It was a great vic
tory for California and a fitting
tribute to their departing coach,
Lynn (Pappy t Waldorf. It was
an upset, but when Stanford and
Cal meet, upsets are common.
Heartbreaking Loss
Saturday's loss was a heart
breaker for co-captains John Bro
die and Paul Wiggin, for half
backs Paul Camera and Gordy
Young, for end Carl Isaacs, guard
Donn Carswell and center Bob
Long. It was their last Big Game
the one they wanted to win
above everything else.
It was a heartbreaker for full
back Lou Valli, the 1715-pound dy
namite who was tlie shining light
in the Card offense. Valli sped
for 209 yards in 23 carries in "giv
ing his all." But he'll get another
chance next year.
It was disheartening too for
Coach Taylor, his staff and the
players who had worked so hard
and long this season. And the
fans too took their bumps.
That Extra Point
All learned the hard way the
importance of that extra point
after a touchdown. First it was
UCLA, 14-13, then Oregon State,
20-19, finally Cal. 20-18.
Bad breaks have been common
on the Farm football scene all
season. Injuries riddled the line,
key fumbles stopped many a long
drive.
Saturday the Bears in taking
the edge in the Big Game series,
25-24 with 10 ties, recovered three
Card fumbles; a Brodie • to - Ca
mera pass, good for a TD, was
called back and a long Brodie ae
rial, hitting the chest of its in
tended receiver, was dropped on
the goal line.
Inspired Cal Team
This is not to take anything
away from an inspired California
team. The Bears, displaying a
blazing first-half attack behind
the brilliant quarterbacking of
sophomore Joe Kapp, tallied the
first three times they had the
ball. The Indians couldn't control
the lightning attack.
Waldorf's charges took the
opening kickoff and marched 07
yards in 10 plays with Kapp,
Herb Jackson, Darrell Roberts
and Jack Hart taking turns on
the ground. Jackson, Cal's hard
hitting senior, crashed over from
two yards out for the game's first
counter. Roberts kicked the PAT.
Stanford, getting the ball for
the first time, began rolling at
the onset with Valli and Young
gaining consistently. Brodie. how
ever, fumbled a handoff on the
Cal 37 and the Boars started TD
march number two.
