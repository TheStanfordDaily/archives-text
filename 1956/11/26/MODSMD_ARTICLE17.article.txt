# "Hold It, Men, That Last One Was Khrushchev Again"
## Effects of International Myopia 
### 
Instead of lessening ttte cap between ihe
I niled Stales and lier major European allies,
llie period that has elapsed since the first dra
matic outbursts in the Middle East has eluci
dated more clearly than ever the depth of the
divergency of views among Western nations as
to how peace will he achieved in that crisis
ridden area.
(»reat Britain and France, once great colonial
powers with diplomatic prestige and economic
fortune, are now reduced to second- and third
rate powers, dependent to a great extent on the
will and generosity of other powers.
I'ride \h certainly involved in their
hul along with it is the absolute realization
that, internally speaking, these countries can
never be self-sufficient.
I hey can depend on trade with friendly
'-tales, hul a pessimistic outlook on the world
.-itualion leads them to the not altogether illogi
cal conclusion that friendly trade lies are not
enough, especially when they are dealing with
nations whose nationalistic ambitions can cut
trade agreements to ribbons.
I he irony of the situation is that the precious
oi! (low through the Suez ("anal which Britain
and I- ranee were attempting to safeguard is now
cut oft precisely because of their attempted
coup. •

However important international control of
the canal may look to them now, their action
was myopic and directed toward a narrow self
interest, for the West has again been tainted
with a colonial tinge and the Soviet Union has
put herself up as the lord protector of the Aral)
underdog against "colonial warmongers."
The United Stales can, and has, barked
loudly, hut this country cannot bile without
further widening the breach in the Western
alliance—action she will never lake, especially
in view of the increasing danger of a reversal
to Stalinist tactics within the Kremlin.
One of the foremost aims of the Soviet Union
has been to aggravate relations among nations
of the West in the hope that the United States
will become isolated from her chief allies. In
th is case Russia has reaped harvests with 110
effort expended.
The Western alliance can stand short rifts
and misunderstandings, but if the constructive
work of Ihe Marshall Plan and NATO in estab
lishing a bulwark against the expansion of
world Communism is not to be recorded in
history as a worthwhile effort futilely drowned
in national jealousies, both Britain and France
must erase their dreams of colonial dominance
and work as best they ran to stabilize their
economic status within a cooperative frame
work.
