Oi r hats (;o OFF to the (lodged crow of fresh

fiom building the annual Big Game bonfire.
Considering ihe pyromaniacal tendencies of
upperclassmen, Menlo Junior College invaders
and possibly even a wandering erew from across
the Bay, it is small wonder there was even a
splinter left unburned by the time of the rally
Thursday night.
» he bonfire, small as it was, was nevertheless
a success—a fact strongly indicating that the
height and breadth of the pyre ami the long
hours expended in guarding miscellaneous piles
of wood scattered around the bed of Lake
Lagunita contribute little to the success or
failure of the rally.

Ihe long period of wood gathering and
guarding was an open invitation to marauders
from local schools and disspirited upperclass
men whose dangerous "pranks" in jured several
students, endangered the lives of others and
ruined valuable equipment.
The risk of human tragedy is too great, as
pointed out by police who said the gasoline
explosions Tuesday night came close to turning
bystanders into "human torches."
The fighting determination of the spirited
112 rosh crew notwithstanding, we again urge pre
cautious to avert the near-disaster of this year's
bonfire elimination of the extended collecting
and guarding period and more complete police
surveillance.
