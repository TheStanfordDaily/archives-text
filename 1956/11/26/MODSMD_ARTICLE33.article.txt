# Indian Journalists Lose in Ink Bowl
## 
### 
In one of the big upsets of the
year, The Daily's pencil-pushers
were edged 6-0 by Ihe Daily Cali
fornian in Saturday's Ink Bowl
game.
Threatening only once during
the game, the Indian scribes were
outnumbered by the free-substi
tuling Cal gridders. The Bear
newspapermen scored early in
the battle when tailback Marvin
(Buddy) Lavin raced back to pick
up a high pass from center and
tossed a 20-yarder to Darrel Se
vi 11a in the end zone.
