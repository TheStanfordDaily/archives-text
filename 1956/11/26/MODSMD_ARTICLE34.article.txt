# Student Tells Contrasts of SU, Keio Life
## No Steam-Heated Flats At Japanese School, Masao Oda Explains 
### 
Stanford - Keio Affiliation has
arranged a scholarship this year
for a Japanese student to study
at Stanford. In return, the Japa
nese university has invited a stu
dent from Stanford to attend Keio
next year.
What a Stanford student could
expect while attending Keio was
explained by Masao Oda, this
year's Keio student on scholar
ship at Stanford.
Don't expect a steam-heated flat
in a fraternity house, with a lot
of friends. Don't plan on taking
your car. And you won't get to
come home for Thanksgiving, be
cause Tokyo is 6000 miles away,
he said.
Non-Resident ( ampus
Keio is a non - residence cam
pus. Therefore, the student will
live in a local home. Here he can
count on getting up bright and
early out of his bed on the floor
to a breakfast of soup and rice,
Oda said.
The student will not have to
worry about bucking the parking
problem since individual cars arc
virtually non-existent. Instead, he
will find a very crowded train to
take him to school, he said.
Oda reports "Keio has an en
rollment of about 12,000 students.
It is comparable to Stanford in
that it is a private school and
tends to draw students from good
families who will graduate into
good jobs."
Major Difference
The major difference between
the two schools, Oda explained, is
that Keio is on the year- system.
"This means that you go to
school from April through March.
Thus you take exams only once
a year and have plenty of time to
go into specialized fields of the
subjects which interest you," he
said.
"The year system also gives the
students more time to participate
in cultural activities.'"
Since the purpose of the Keio-
Stanford Affiliation scholarships
is to increase cultural exchange
between the schools, Oda said he
felt that an American student go
ing to Keio would have plenty of
time to do this.
