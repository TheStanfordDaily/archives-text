# Sadie Will Reveal Identity Tonight
## 
### 
Who is Stanford Sadie?
The answer to this question—
and many others—will be given
tonight on KZSU when Sadie re
veals her identity.
Listeners will learn the name
of the girl with the suggestive
voice who took them through a
mass hypnotism experiment and
who has been answering the ques
tions they phone in.
Winner of the "Why I Would
Like a Date with Sadie" essay
contest will also be announced.
Th e pri / e is, appropriately
enough, a date with Sadie.
