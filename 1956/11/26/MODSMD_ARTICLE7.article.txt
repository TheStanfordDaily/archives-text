# Stanford 'Kicks In' to Present 20-18 Parting Gift to Waldorf
## For SU, Bitter Pill; for Pappy, One Big Thrill Scalpers Lose, Cops Triumph in Conflict With Big Game Fans 
### Dick Meister 
A busy and happy weekend
earrre to a sudden halt Saturday
afternoon about 4:.'JO when 82,000
faces turned to the big score
board at Berkeley's Memorial Sta
dium and read the awful truth:
California 20, Stanford 18.
For those in blue it was only a
momentary half; delirious sup
porters of the Golden Bear are
probably still risking natural dis
aster, with their earth-shaking
celebrations in Cal's Strawberry
Canyon.
Red - togged partisans couldn't
be further froitt happiness, but
they're busy all right busy try
ing to foi'get a young California
quarterback who stripped the
gears on their Big Red Machine,
and a rotund coach named Pappy
who bowed out like a real
trouper, with an Axe clutched
firmly in his hands.
Overflow Crowd
There have l>een more exciting
Big Games than Saturday's 59th
renewal of the classic, but not in
the opinion of the usual overflow
mob that packed the Berkeley
bowl to see the game that broke
a 24-24 series tie.
They saw the underdog win
once again.
Pre-game spirit was at its usual
towering height, but with Cal an
eight-point underdog Bear root
ers had little but hope.
Friday night three students
were arrested at a Union Square
rally in San Francisco. A crowd
of 3000 had overflowed onto the
street, slowing traffic.
One celebrant pulled the near
est fire alarm box and brought
six fire trucks to the scene.
Yell Leader Arrested
Among those arrested was
Cal's head yell leader, Ron Allbee,
who protested that "I was just
leading a yell." The man in blue
said "disturbing the peace." All
bee was released in time to lead
Cal rooters at Berkeley.
Lead his rooters he did to one
of Cal's most satisfying triumphs
in many a year. This wasn't just
the Big Game, it was Pappy's
game too. Coach Waldorf packed
a seven won, one lost, two tied
Big Game record into Saturday's
tilt; and since his retirement an
nouncement last Tuesday Califor
nia had been determined to "win
this one for Pappy."
Tributes to Pappy
Waldorf' s retirement plans
came so suddenly that both rout
ing sections and the Cal band had
lo do a quick change. Card stunts
featured tributes to Pappy and
the UC band rededicated its pie
game show to their- coach.
After it was all over and Wal
dorf had been given the game ball
by his team he was carried on the
gridders' shoulders. This vws a
tough assignment. The 54-year
old mentor weighs in at 2(i5.
The Cal hero of the piece was
quarter back .Joe Kapp.
Kapp proved tr, ,>c the fans' do
light or nemesis, according to
which side of the field they were
sitting on. He led Cal in a first
hall performance so fast paced
that it's a wonder players and
footers had strength left for the
second half.
There were the usual first -ha If
hi- jinks between the Cal and
Stanford routing sections, but
seemingly quieter than usual.
Perhaps Cal's nnslop p a h Ie
charges stunned Indian rooters
into disbelieving silence.
Quiet in Stands
Comparative quiet reigned in
the stands before kiekoff, except
when the Axe was brought into
Stanford view and when Califor
nia rooters presented the Indians
with their version of a '"'Bowl
Game, Stanford Style" a famil
iar bathroom fixture.
Hundreds sat above 'iie sta
dium on "Tightwad Hill." but
they needn't have bothered.
Scalpers were offering game tick
ets for as little as $1.
The police department did well.
Dozens of cars in one- or two
hour parking /.ones had little
white envelopes on their wind
shields after the game in which

cheered as the Axe changed hands again after only one year on
the Farm. —Daily Photo by Ed Fayle
