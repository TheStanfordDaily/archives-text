# Stanford 'Kicks In' to Present 20-18 Parting Gift to Waldorf
## For SU, Bitter Pill; for Pappy, One Big Thrill Scalpers Lose, Cops Triumph in Conflict With Big Game Fans 
### Dick Meister 
A busy and happy weekend
earrre to a sudden halt Saturday
afternoon about 4:.'JO when 82,000
faces turned to the big score
board at Berkeley's Memorial Sta
dium and read the awful truth:
California 20, Stanford 18.
For those in blue it was only a
momentary half; delirious sup
porters of the Golden Bear are
probably still risking natural dis
aster, with their earth-shaking
celebrations in Cal's Strawberry
Canyon.
Red - togged partisans couldn't
be further froitt happiness, but
they're busy all right busy try
ing to foi'get a young California
quarterback who stripped the
gears on their Big Red Machine,
and a rotund coach named Pappy
who bowed out like a real
trouper, with an Axe clutched
firmly in his hands.
Overflow Crowd
There have l>een more exciting
Big Games than Saturday's 59th
renewal of the classic, but not in
the opinion of the usual overflow
mob that packed the Berkeley
bowl to see the game that broke
a 24-24 series tie.
They saw the underdog win
once again.
Pre-game spirit was at its usual
towering height, but with Cal an
eight-point underdog Bear root
ers had little but hope.
Friday night three students
were arrested at a Union Square
rally in San Francisco. A crowd
of 3000 had overflowed onto the
street, slowing traffic.
One celebrant pulled the near
est fire alarm box and brought
six fire trucks to the scene.
Yell Leader Arrested
Among those arrested was
Cal's head yell leader, Ron Allbee,
who protested that "I was just
leading a yell." The man in blue
said "disturbing the peace." All
bee was released in time to lead
Cal rooters at Berkeley.
Lead his rooters he did to one
of Cal's most satisfying triumphs
in many a year. This wasn't just
the Big Game, it was Pappy's
game too. Coach Waldorf packed
a seven won, one lost, two tied
Big Game record into Saturday's
tilt; and since his retirement an
nouncement last Tuesday Califor
nia had been determined to "win
this one for Pappy."
Tributes to Pappy
Waldorf' s retirement plans
came so suddenly that both rout
ing sections and the Cal band had
lo do a quick change. Card stunts
featured tributes to Pappy and
the UC band rededicated its pie
game show to their- coach.
After it was all over and Wal
dorf had been given the game ball
by his team he was carried on the
gridders' shoulders. This vws a
tough assignment. The 54-year
old mentor weighs in at 2(i5.
The Cal hero of the piece was
quarter back .Joe Kapp.
Kapp proved tr, ,>c the fans' do
light or nemesis, according to
which side of the field they were
sitting on. He led Cal in a first
hall performance so fast paced
that it's a wonder players and
footers had strength left for the
second half.
There were the usual first -ha If
hi- jinks between the Cal and
Stanford routing sections, but
seemingly quieter than usual.
Perhaps Cal's nnslop p a h Ie
charges stunned Indian rooters
into disbelieving silence.
Quiet in Stands
Comparative quiet reigned in
the stands before kiekoff, except
when the Axe was brought into
Stanford view and when Califor
nia rooters presented the Indians
with their version of a '"'Bowl
Game, Stanford Style" a famil
iar bathroom fixture.
Hundreds sat above 'iie sta
dium on "Tightwad Hill." but
they needn't have bothered.
Scalpers were offering game tick
ets for as little as $1.
The police department did well.
Dozens of cars in one- or two
hour parking /.ones had little
white envelopes on their wind
shields after the game in which

crowd of nearly 82,000 who turned mil for the 59th Big Game at
Berkeley's .Memorial Stadium Saturday. Indians mourned, Bears

to place their $2 contribution to
Berkeley city progress.
With all eyes on the field an j
eager Cal rooter managed to lift
Indian drum major John Pan
kratz's shako hat and dash across |
the field with an Indian band
member in pursuit. He made it
into the safety of the Cal section
but a few moments later a Cal
bandsman returned the hat as
Stanford rooters cheered.
Half-time featured the usual
card stunts and an outstanding
marching band show with Stan
ford presenting a "Ttuir of San
Francisco." .But the real honors
must go to Cal's 100-piece aggre
gation for its "Salute to Broad
way, 1956" which featured danc
ing and singing by the band.
With seconds remaining in the !
game a low roar reached its |
height in the Cal section. "We;
got the Axe." The gun sounded 1
as Stanford linemen stood mo- j
tionless and their supporters in
the stands did likewise.
Entrenched
The goal posts didn't come
down; they're too solidly en
trenched for that. It didn't mat
ter anyway; Cal had its eyes on
the Axe. With a chant of "We
want the Axe" the rooters
stormed the Stanford section and
watched as co - captain Brodie
handed over the trophy that has
been Stanford's for only one year
since 1946.
Cal co-captain John Gilkey ac
cepted the trophy and handed it
to Cal rally commers who were
escorted out of the stadium by a
cordon of police while yell leader

I
Duke moaned. "Take good care of i
it."
Before the Axe was turned |
over Brodie was presented with
his All-America award from Col
lier's magazine.
Farm Fans Quiet
Stanford fans were quiet. They
know they had been upset. But
they had little consolation — no
PCC title, no Rose Bowl, and now
no Big Game. They had seen
the world's best team that had
been beaten five times go down
to defeat for the sixth time.
The team had even lost a pos
sible chance to play in the Pine
apple Bowl against Hawaii.
They saw a sign on a Berkeley
building leading "Stanford Go
Home" and they quietly acqui
esced.
They're sad. sorry and tired,
| but hell, it's only 363 days till
J next Big Game and that will be
I the year.
