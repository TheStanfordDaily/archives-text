### 
Construction will bpjjin npxt
summer on the $22 million Vet
erans Administration Hospital on
Stanford land, according to Dr.
John Prusmack, director of the
Veterans Hospital in Menlo Park.
In a progress report made re
cently, Prusmack said the 1000-
beci hospital f'»r treatment ot tire
mentally ill will be ready for use
by .Tanuarv 1980.
Some 8,"5 acres of rolling hills
west of Barron Park, near the in
dustrial area, will be leveled for
the building project.
Welton Becket, Los Angeles ar
chitect, has designed the future
hospital. It is being constructed
in separate units following a Vet
erans Administration pattern
which has been tested throughout
the U.S. for the past 10 years.
Concrete Buildings
The reinforced concrete build
ings will range from a six-story
medical-surgical unit to one-story
housing units.
The entire area will be land
scaped, according to Prusmack.
Plans are being prepared by Palo
Alto landscape architects Ailan H.
Reid and Herbert J. Kopp.
Prusmack said the property
would be fenced on all sides ex
cept Junipero Serra, but denied
that the fence is to protect the
public from the mental patients.
Fear of Patients
When the government obtained
the property from Stanford on a
friendly condemnation suit for the
hospital, residents in the area ex
pressed fear of the danger of
escaped mental patients.
Prusmack admitted that some
patients will occasionally "wander
off" the hospital grounds, but
"they will probably need more
protection than anything else."
Prusmack, who will reportedly
manage the new hospital as well
as the Menlo Park institution he
now heads, said that all 1000 beds
of the new hospital will be avail
able for teaching for Stanford
Medical School students. He also
reported that the 1400-bed Menlo
Park hospital, now 30 years old,
may be remodeled when the Stan
ford hospital is completed.
