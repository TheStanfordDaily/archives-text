WASHINGTON, Nov. 2H (UP)
Democratic National Chairman
Paul M. Butler proposed today
that the present $3 million limit
on campaign spending by nation
al political committers be raised
to $9 million or $10 million to
meet soaring campaign costs.
But he insisted that some sort
of ceiling should be retained on
each committee's outlay because,
he said, "we shouldn't have a sit
uation where the election could
be purchased by either party."
Butler said the present 63000
limit on individual political con
tributions is "realistic." He pro
posed that Congress give an in
come t<ix credit for all contribu
tions up to $10.
