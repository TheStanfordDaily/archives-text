the border twice last week, and it
was reported then that the Rus
sians were insisting that only sol

right to ride the allied trains.
United Press Staff Correspond
ent Ernest J. Cramer was put off
the American train today, appar
ently by Soviet demand.
The train commander told Cra
mer he would have to leave the
train at Marienborn, the Soviet
border check-point, because only
servicemen could travel across So
viet Germany to encircled Berlin.
The UP correspondent, who was
traveling on Army orders, pointed
out that State Department offi
cials, newsmen and other Ameri
cans accredited to the Army in
Germany have been riding the al
lied trains ever since the war.
"That was a mistake," the train
commander said. He would give
no further details.
New Procedures
British officials said their ttain
was turned back after it had trav
eled 110 miles across Soviet-held
territory to Mairenborn because
of "new documentation proce
dures." They would give no fur
ther details.
The British train, which left
Berlin at 11:38 p.m. yesterday,
reached the bolder about 2 a.m.
today.
"The train was returned to Ber
lin after a considerable delay be
cause of misunderstanding about
new documentation procedures de
manded by the Russians," a Brit

The American train reached Ma
rienborn about 4 a.m. It was al
lowed to proceed shortly before
6 a.m., after Cramer had been put
off.

BERLIN, Nov. 26 (UP) —The
Russians turned back a westbound
i British train at Germany's Iron
| Curtain border today in an omi
nous renewal of travel curbs like
i those that started the Soviet
blockade of Berlin in 1948.
An American train headed for
j Berlin was allowed to pass after
; a two-hour delay at the border,
but only when it appeared that
; the U.S. Army had surrendered to
j Soviet demands.
No one would say officially just
what the Russians are up to, but
i it appeared they are challenging
the right of the Western allies to
carry civilians on the trains they
one rate between Berlin and the
West.
Trains Delayed
British trains were delayed at
the border twice last week, and it
was reported then that the Rus
sians were insisting that only sol
diers, sailors and airmen had the
right to ride the allied trains.
United Press Staff Correspond
ent Ernest J. Cramer was put off
the American train today, appar
ently by Soviet demand.
The train commander told Cra
mer he would have to leave the
train at Marienborn, the Soviet
border check-point, because only
servicemen could travel across So
viet Germany to encircled Berlin.
The UP correspondent, who was
traveling on Army orders, pointed
out that State Department offi
cials, newsmen and other Ameri
cans accredited to the Army in
Germany have been riding the al
lied trains ever since the war.
"That was a mistake," the train
commander said. He would give
no further details.
New Procedures
British officials said their ttain
was turned back after it had trav
eled 110 miles across Soviet-held
territory to Mairenborn because
of "new documentation proce
dures." They would give no fur
ther details.
The British train, which left
Berlin at 11:38 p.m. yesterday,
reached the bolder about 2 a.m.
today.
"The train was returned to Ber
lin after a considerable delay be
cause of misunderstanding about
new documentation procedures de
manded by the Russians," a Brit
ish spokesman said.
The American train reached Ma
rienborn about 4 a.m. It was al
lowed to proceed shortly before
6 a.m., after Cramer had been put
off.
Ambassadors Meet.
Allied ambassadors in Bonn met
today to discuss the new Russian
interference with travel. Western
officials here took up the incident
directly with the Russians.
The four- power occupation
agreements that made West Ber
lin an island of freedom in thr>
heart of Soviet Germany guaran
teed the right of the allies to
transport "occupation personnel"
to and from the isolated city.
Most of the time since then the
Russians have been willing to ac
cept as "occupation personnel"
anyone whom U.S. authorities
cleared for travel.
