# A 						Lesson in Sportsmanship

### 
Immature individuals can always find a scape
goat when things don't go their way. When it
rains, they blame the weatherman; when they
flunk an examination, the professor's lousy.
Saturday we lost the Big Game. Sunday
Chuck Tayloi wj<3 hanged in effigy in Memo
rial Auditorium.
The student 'sponsible for the hanging
must be quite proud. They must be happy to
have relieved their post-game frustration in
such a self-satisfying, childish manner.
Vi hile Stanford was winning or at least living
up to its potential, Taylor was a god among
coaches. But when he hit the hard knocks this
season —as any coach or team will do—his ad
mirable record has become forgotten by several

unthinking individuals, and on his shoulders
alone is thrown the blame for the team's defeat.
To lay the "'blame" at some one person's feet,
whether he be the coach or one of the team,
is hardly a measure of good sportsmanship or
good taste. When a man has devoted six years
to building the type of team that any university
would be proud of, he deserves more than
ridicule.
Stanford has prided itself on good sports
manship, on placing the emphasis on a good,
healthy football contest —win or lose.
It would be a black mark on Stanford's
record of clean athletics should a numerical
victory take precedence over good sportsman
ship—at home as well as on the field.
