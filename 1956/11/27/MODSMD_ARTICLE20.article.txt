# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Mary Ellen Romney
## Religious Revival Spreads Over Campuses 
### 
Thanksgiving was observed in a way unique
to college campuses last week at a group of East
ern universities. Rather than football contests,
vacation trips home, and feasts, the colleges
turned the emphasis to religion.
At the University of Cincinnati "Religious
Emphasis Week" began with a hymn at the
Wichita-Cincinnati football game. Through the
week students attended a kick-off dinner, an all
university convocation and a community convo
cation, all centered on the theme "Where Do You
Stand?"
The renowned Protestant theologian Reinhold
Niebuhr was guest speaker at Johns Hopkins
University's "Religion in Life Week" program.
Niebuhr, professor at Yale Divinity School, led
discussion groups and spoke to several all-univer
sity audiences during the week.
At George Washington University "Religion
in Life Week" began with three simultaneous
Thanksgiving services for Protestant, Catholic
and Jewish students. The following day univer
sity leaders gathered for a kick-off dinner, and
the campus fraternities and sororities held group
discussions with guest leaders on the subject of
the place of religion in college life.
Inter-faith discussions were scheduled for the
week, with noted religious leaders in the area
as leaders and speakers. The week ended with
regular university chapel services Sunday.

The snowball of student expressions of sym
pathy for Hungary continued unabated last
week, as campus after campus joined the fund
raising drive for the oppressed rebels. Several
universities came up with a new twist—offering
scholarships to Hungarian students among the
refugees to be taken in by the United States.
At Columbia University, ten scholarships and
fellowships were announced by President Gray
son Kirk. Some will cover full tuition and addi

tional help, for both undergraduate and graduate
study. Negotiations have already begun, and it
is hoped that the program will be ready in time
for Columbia's second semester in February.
Yale University has also announced that it
will offer scholarship aid and student employ
ment to the Hungarian refugees. Nearly $3500
has been raised already by Yale students for the
fund.
On the West Coast, the University of British
Columbia students launched a fund-raising drive
for three scholarships for Hungarian students.
The drive opened with a ceremony, lowering the
campus flag to half-mast, with a Hungarian stu
dent and professor speaking on the Hungarian
situation. Their goal is $2000 to help defray the
expenses of three students, to be selected by
World University Service.

A protest against student apathy was filed
last week In the Occidental daily paper. The
anonymous letter went as follows:
"This is one of the few Occidental Nobodies
speaking. My group greets you since we rarely
see or have contact with you. We, as a group,
go to many of the cultural or fine arts activities
offered to all on campus, and, though you don't
know us, we are always noticed. For instance,
at last weekend's play performance and at the
music department recital, everyone was saying,
'Look, Nobody's here!'
"You see, we sometimes put these activities
before our studies—and you know that makes us
nobody and nowhere at Occidental College. We
try to make time for recitals, plays, lectures, etc.,
and this, as you know, is quite un-Occidentalish
because a liberal arts education means taking
four semesters of Civ and sometimes going to
assemblies.
"Nevertheless, please don't worry about stu
dious reputation of scholastic standing—because,
as I've said, we're Nobody."

universities came up with a new twist—offering
scholarships to Hungarian students among the
refugees to be taken in by the United States.
At Columbia University, ten scholarships and
fellowships were announced by President Gray
son Kirk. Some will cover full tuition and addi

tional help, for both undergraduate and graduate
study. Negotiations have already begun, and it
is hoped that the program will be ready in time
for Columbia's second semester in February.
Yale University has also announced that it
will offer scholarship aid and student employ
ment to the Hungarian refugees. Nearly $3500
has been raised already by Yale students for the
fund.
On the West Coast, the University of British
Columbia students launched a fund-raising drive
for three scholarships for Hungarian students.
The drive opened with a ceremony, lowering the
campus flag to half-mast, with a Hungarian stu
dent and professor speaking on the Hungarian
situation. Their goal is $2000 to help defray the
expenses of three students, to be selected by
World University Service.

A protest against student apathy was filed
last week In the Occidental daily paper. The
anonymous letter went as follows:
"This is one of the few Occidental Nobodies
speaking. My group greets you since we rarely
see or have contact with you. We, as a group,
go to many of the cultural or fine arts activities
offered to all on campus, and, though you don't
know us, we are always noticed. For instance,
at last weekend's play performance and at the
music department recital, everyone was saying,
'Look, Nobody's here!'
"You see, we sometimes put these activities
before our studies—and you know that makes us
nobody and nowhere at Occidental College. We
try to make time for recitals, plays, lectures, etc.,
and this, as you know, is quite un-Occidentalish
because a liberal arts education means taking
four semesters of Civ and sometimes going to
assemblies.
"Nevertheless, please don't worry about stu
dious reputation of scholastic standing—because,
as I've said, we're Nobody."
Thanksgiving was observed in a way unique
to college campuses last week at a group of East
ern universities. Rather than football contests,
vacation trips home, and feasts, the colleges
turned the emphasis to religion.
At the University of Cincinnati "Religious
Emphasis Week" began with a hymn at the
Wichita-Cincinnati football game. Through the
week students attended a kick-off dinner, an all
university convocation and a community convo
cation, all centered on the theme "Where Do You
Stand?"
The renowned Protestant theologian Reinhold
Niebuhr was guest speaker at Johns Hopkins
University's "Religion in Life Week" program.
Niebuhr, professor at Yale Divinity School, led
discussion groups and spoke to several all-univer
sity audiences during the week.
At George Washington University "Religion
in Life Week" began with three simultaneous
Thanksgiving services for Protestant, Catholic
and Jewish students. The following day univer
sity leaders gathered for a kick-off dinner, and
the campus fraternities and sororities held group
discussions with guest leaders on the subject of
the place of religion in college life.
Inter-faith discussions were scheduled for the
week, with noted religious leaders in the area
as leaders and speakers. The week ended with
regular university chapel services Sunday.
