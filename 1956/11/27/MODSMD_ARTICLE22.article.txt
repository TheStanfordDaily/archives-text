An 'Agonizeil Realization"
Editor, The Daily:
Recent events make clear that this is not the
time for an "agonizing reappraisal" of our for
eign policy, but rather for the agonized realiza
tion that the United States has nothing worthy
of the name; for the sad fact is that the sum total
of our world-politics resource includes nothing
really capable of advancing the country's inter
ests.
Take, for example, the Hungarian business.
Russian troops have deposed that country's pre
mier, slaughtered its inhabitants and are pres
ently engaged in shipping large quantities of
them off to Siberia. And the United States has
done nothing to deter this.
Of course, we ran to the United Nations and
moved to "deplore" the Soviet action; we even
offered the embattled Hungarians, in response to
their pleas for arms, food. But no sensible per
son would maintain that either of these steps
has had any real effect; and in fact no great
sagacity was required to see that they could not
even be expected to.
And then we have Suez. We pressured the
British to get out of Die Canal Zone (this was
designed to show true neutrals like India, who
fought the deploratory resolution on Hungary,
that we Westerners are good boys too). When
that vital waterway was seized from its owners
by the Egyptians, to whom we had given goodly
amounts of aid, we prevented our allies from do
ing anything effective as with Russian support
Nasser entrenched himself in the canal.
But-finally Britain and France, like us greatly
dependent on the canal, having exhausted confer
ence and UN channels, took the only remaining
alternative despite our having virtually assured
Nasser that he might keep the stolen canal un
less he chose voluntarily to return it. Whereupon
we promptly joined the Russians in combatting
that threat to their interests. Indeed, one might
say that our statesmen lack not only means to
achieve our interests, but even comprehension of
what those interests are.
Now the United Nations has real worth as a
world forum, and it can make recommendations,
but action beyond the stage of resolutions de
pends upon the states of the world which com
prise it.
Nevertheless, like a naive child fascinated by
an attractive idea, we have been oblivious to the
UN's severely limited nature and we have repu
diated independent action in favor of a foreign
policy whose sole significant resource is to run
to that organization, expecting in our folly that
it will do what it cannot and we will not. And
as recent events should make crystal-clear, such
a policy is devoid of favorable issue.

Menlo Parkin#
Editor, The Daily:
Do you believe in local self-government? If
so, exercise your rights of citizenship by attend-

ing the public meeting of the Menlo Park City
Council tonight at 7:30 in the City Council cham
bers at Menlo Park Civic Center off Ravenswood.
The mattpr to be brought up is elimination
of the prohibition of overnight parking on Menlo
streets to be substituted for by giving the chief
of police discretion to issue permits in hardship
cases where there is insufficient off-street park
ing. The absolute prohibition "now in effect is
claimed to make street cleaning easier, prevent
vandalism on parked cars and reduce accidents.
Most cities operate very well without any sort
of such ordinance. Nearby Palo Alto has an or
dinance prohibiting overnight parking, but giv
ing consideration for hardship cases by allowing
the chief of police discretion to permit parking
in those cases. This does not seem to impose any
difficulties on Palo Alto, and I doubt it would
be any different in Menlo Park.
I realize that it is the majority who govern,
and this problem faces only a minority; however,
it is a basic principle of our democracy that the
rights of the minority may not be disregarded,
as .seen in our Constitution's "equal protection
under the law."
The Traffic Safety Commission has decided
against this proposal, and the only hope for relief
lies with the City Council. Your support (by
letter or attendance) for a new ordinance may
turn the tide.

Right to Revolution
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Haig Bosmajian's letter "Think
Twice Over Hungary":
Mr. Bosmajian states that a group of persons
in Hungary have attempted to overthrow the
established government through use of force and
violence, and that we must not support the use
of force by a minority, especially since we do not
know who this minority is and whom it repre
sents.
How else, then, could the Hungarian people
have freed themselves of this "established gov
ernment," which was not established according
to their will, but through the use of force, and
which depends on the Russian troops to insure
its power?
Violence was the only way left, for although
the Hungarian people had tried peacefully for
many years, they hadn't gained free election or
true freedom of press and speech.
According to international law, there is a
right to revolution, and we tend to justify such
as the American revolution to gain independence.
However, genocide, which Russia has committed,
is a crime, according to the terms of the Genocide
Convention.
Also we cannot say that only a minority of
the Hungarians revolted, when we know that the
resistance of a minority would long have been
extinguished; only the resistance of a whole peo
ple can hold out this long. A minority cannot
cause a general strike and a standstill of the
whole national economy.
