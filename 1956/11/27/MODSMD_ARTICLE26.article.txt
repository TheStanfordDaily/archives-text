THE GIFT HORSE
The college lifo is a busy one, especially at this time
of year. What with going to classes and studying for
exams and pursuing a full social schedule and construct
ing rope ladders to foil dormitory curfews, the average
undergrad is so pressed for time that he cannot do justice
to his Christmas shopping.
Therefore, to aid you in your Christmas shopping, T
have gone into the market place and selected for you a
list of gifts, notable for their originality.
Perhaps the most original gift of all this year is a
carton of Philip Morris Cigarettes. "Original?" you ex
claim, your bushy young eyebrows rising. "Why, we
have been giving cartons of Philip Morris for years!"
True, I reply, but each time you give Philip Morris,
it, is a new treat, a fresh delight, a pristine pleasure. Each
carton, each pack, each cigarette, each puff, is just as
good as the first one you ever tried.
Another gift destined for certain popularity this
year is a gift certificate from the American Dental As
sociation. This certificate, good at any dentist's office in
America, is accompanied by a handsome gift card upon
which is engraved this lovely poem:
Merry Christmas, little pal,
Do you need some root canal? ,*
Prophylaxis? Porcelain caps? " "
Bridyework to close up them yaps?
Shiny braces that will straiyhten?
Inlays? Fillings? Upper platen?
Merry Christmas to your teeth,
And the rosy yams beneath.

Another gift that is always welcome is a book, espe
cially to people who read. This Christmas the selection
of books is particularly attractive. For lovers of an
thologies, there is William Makepeace Sherpa's A Treas
ury of the World's Great Treasuries. For those who fancy
inspiring success stories, there is the stirring autobi
ography of William Makepeace Pemmican entitled How
1 Got a Forty Pound Monkey Off My Back and Started
the Duluth Zoo. For devotees of skin-diving, there is
] Married a Snorkel by Lydia Makepeace Watershed. For
calorie counters and jwaistline watchers, there is Harry
Makepeace Wildfoster's Eat and Grow Fat.
My own favorite book this season is a pulse-pounding
historical novel from that famous author of pulse-pound
ing historical novels, Daphne Makepeace Sigafoos. This
one is called E(/ad and Zounds, and it tells the poignant
romance of two young lovers, Egad and Zounds, who,
alas, can never be married, for fiery Egad is but a gypsy
lass, while tempestuous Zounds is a Kappa Sigma. They
later become Ludwig of Bavaria.
My final gift suggestion is one that a great many
people have been fervently wishing for since last year.
Do you remember the introduction last Christmas of
tiny personal portable radios that plugged into your ear?
Well, this year, you will be delighted to know, you can
buy an ingenious pick to get them out.
