# You don't have to be an Old Grad to use Bowman Alumni House
## 
### 
Bowman Aiumni 1 lousn
means the Stanford Alumni
Association. That's where we
hang our hats. Ami we hope
you'll hang yours there, tdo —
often. The alumni maintain it,
hut they can't use it much.
I hey're too busy out there in
the outside world being alum
ni. Although it's supported
out ol alumni dues, Bowman
Alumni I louse is a umi/uis fa
cility, and its main use is by
students.
For instance, more than 300
meetings (see picture) are held
here each year, rent free-—and
the majority of these are meet
ings of student groups. But we
can handle more, and we're
anxious to do it. Come in and
see us.
We maintain one mimeo
graph machine solely for the
use of students. Come in and
use it.
We have data on all those
who have ever attended Stan
ford—living or dead, degree
holder or not. If you want to
trace an old grad—ask us and
we'll look him up for you.
If you need some other serv
ice you think might be up our
alley, come in and talk it over.
II we can help—we will.
We call it Bowman Alumni
I louse because alumni built it
and maintain it. But we might
just as well call it Bowman Stu
dent I louse. They use it most
—and that's the way we want
it.
Incidentally, life tnembershi/) rates
are up Dec. 1. Saturday.
If yon join now instead of waiting
until after ifrthluation you II save
yontself f4O.
