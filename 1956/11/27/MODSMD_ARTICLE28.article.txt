# Valli Leads Indian Running Attack; Young, Dick Follow; Brodie Top Passer
## 
### 
Lou Valli, plucky Stanford
fullback, is high man in yards
gained on the Cards' final statis
tics with 649 yards gained this
season.
Lou has consistently sparked
the Indian running attack. The
clearest example of the fleet-foot
ed Valli's efforts showed in the
Big Game Saturday.
Valli consistently packed the
leather for good - sized'yardage
gains. In the 23 times he carried
the ball he made a net yard gain
of 209, averaging 9.1 yards a car
ry. Lou was the one who led the
way to Stanford's scoring with
hi* tremendous yardage gains.
Fullback Gordy Young ranks
second in yardage gained with

446 for the season. This is Gor
dy's last year and he has proved
that Stanford can put forth an
excellent running team when oc
casion demands.
Halfback Doug Dick, off to a
slow start early in the season, has
come forth the last part of the
season to make himself a likely
starter on next year's Indian
team. He holds third place in
yardage gained with 145.
In the passing department John
Brodie, of course, has no equal in
the nation. All-American Brodie
last Saturday broke the all-time
PCC pass completion record, 137,
set by Don Heinrich of Washing
ton in 1952, with his 139 comple
tions for the season.
