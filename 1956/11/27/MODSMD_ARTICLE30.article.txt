### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 26
i TIP i — Coach Chuck Taylor,
Whose Stanford Indians sustained
three out of their last four losses
because of missed conversions,
said today he was in favor of
junking the extra point.
Taylor said the next best solu
tion might be to convert touch
downs by other means.
"Maybe it would be better to
put the ball on the 10-yard line
and give a team four shots to
rush the ball over. Or maybe the
conversion should be kicked from
the 25-yard line," Taylor said.
The red-headed coach made his
observations at the final session
of this season's Northern Califor
nia football writers' luncheon
where Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf,
California's outgoing coach, made
his farewell adddress.
Waldorf, and Bob Bronzan of
San Jose State who also is step
ping out after one more game to
become the school's athletic direc
tor, were named "co-coaches of
the year" by the association.
Waldorf emphasized that he
had worked all season to give his
unnamed successor a good foun
dation for next season's cam
paign and predicted, "I think
there will bo a 'good nucleus at
California for at least the next
two seasons."
The huge coach described last
Saturday's 20-18 upset conquest
of Stanford as "a game that
transcended technical discussion."
"It was an example of great
dedication by a wonderful group
of kids who have had some frus
trating moments this year."
