Dick Foster joined Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply
unit o) the Bell System, in February 1952, shortly after earning his
H. S. in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois. As a
development engineer on a new automation process Dick first
worked at the Hawthorne Works in Chicago. Later, he moved to
the Montgomery plant at Aurora, Illinois where he is pictured
above driving into the parking area.


Here Dick and a set-up man check over the automatic production line
used to manufacture a wire spring relay part jor complex telephone
switching equipment. This automatic line carrier a component oj the
relay on a reciprocating conveyor through as many as nine different
and very precise operations — such as percussive welding in which
small block contacts of palladium are attached to the tips oj wires tt.
within a tolerance of ~ .002".


nick finds lime for many Western Hlectric employee activ
ities. Here he is scoring up a spare while tuning up for
the engineers' howling league. He is active also in the gulf
cluh, camera cluh, and a professional engineering society.
Dicl<, an Army veteran, keeps bachelor quarters in sub
urban Chicago where he it able to enjoy the outdoor lift
as well a\ the advantages of the city.


Dick's day mav bet-in in one of several ways: an informal
office chal with liis boss, a department "brain session" to
tackle a particularly tough engineering problem (above);
working with skilled machine builders in the mechanical
development laboratory; or "on the line" (below) where
he checks performance and quality anil looks for new
ways to do things.


Kxuminine the plastic molded "comb" components of
the wire spring relay Dick recalls- his early work
when he was involved in working-up forming and
coining tools for the pilot model of the automation
line for fabrication of wire spring sub-assemblies for
relays. At prevent he is associated with the expansion
of these automation lines at the Montgomery Plant.
