# Does Du Pont hire men who have definite military commitments?

Oran Ritter asks:

Don Sutherland answers:

Yes, Oran, wo certainly do! We've employed quite a
number graduates with definite military
commitments, even when we knew they could work no
more than a few weeks before reporting for duty. Take
my own case. I was hired in November of 1953 and
worked for only four weeks before leaving for the Army.
Two years later T returned to Du Pont.
You see, we're primarily interested in men on a long
range basis. The fact that they're temporarily unavail
able, for a good reason like military service, isn't any bar
to their being considered for employment. After working
only one day, an employee is guaranteed full re-employ
ment, rights—that's the law. And if a man works for
Du Pont a full year before entering the service for two or
more years, he receives an extra two months' salary. If he
goes into the service for six months, he's paid a hall

month's salary. When hp's entitled to a vacation but
doesn't have time to take it before leaving, Du Pont
gives him equivalent pay instead.
Even if present employment is impossible, Oran, we
definitely recommend your talking with Du Pont'u repre
sentatives as well as those of other companies. The very
least you'll gain will be valuable background and some
contacts of real benefit to you when you leave military
service.
