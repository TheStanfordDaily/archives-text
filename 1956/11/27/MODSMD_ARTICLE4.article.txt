# Lewis 'One of Finest Artists' To Appear at Farm Concerts
## Navigates Difficult Passages With Rare Charm; Aria From Little-Known Opera Tops Program 
### Bob Christiansen 
Certainly one of the finest artists to appear in the Stanford Con
cert Series in a long time was tenor Richard Lewis. His program
last evening showed a fine balance in choice of material, and essen
tially a very fine voice.
Lewis' performance of the aria "War He Sung Is Toil and Trouble"

by Handel was indeed excellent.
He navigated some very difficult
passages with a charm and grace
which very few singers have.
The aria "Dalla sua pace" from
Don Giovanni was unfortunately
placed too early in the program.
Lewis gave a labored effect to an
essentially graceful and high me
lodic aria.
Program Highlight
Probably the highlight of the !
program was the aria "Pria che
spunti in ciel" from Domenico Ci
marosa's little-known opera, "II
Matrimonio Segreto." This aria
was sung in a flawless opera
bouffe style which few singers of
today can muster. The end of the
aria, which contains some very
florid passages, was sung as ef
fortlessly as if Lewis were warm
ing up with a few scales.
Of the four Lieder which Lewis
sang, probably the one most suit
ed to his voice, and the one best
executed, was "Die Litanei" by
Schubert. Here Lewis showed his
magnificent ability to support
long phrases and to produce warm
tones to best advantage.
The four songs of Henri Duparc
were sung as well as they've ever
been sung. Lewis has that espe
cially fine ability to be able to
sing French songs in a French
styleâ€”which is almost unknown
in any other English singer, with
the exception of Maggie Toyte.
Best Songs
As was expected, the songs that
Lewis did the most justice to, and
those which were most suited to
that style of singing that is so
peculiar to the English, were tho
songs of Vaughn Williams, Peter
Warlock, Roger Quilter and Ben
jamin Britten. Probably the most
charming of all these songs was
"The Water Mill" by Vaughn Wil
liams.
Peter Warlock's "Pretty Ring j
Time," set to a text of Shake
speare, seemed a bit out of con
text, especially when the John J
Dowland version of this song is
so well known. Two added bon
bons to this collection of English
songs were Benjamin Britten's at - j
rangements of "Sally Gardens" j
and"The Plough Boy."
Lewis sang "How Beautiful
They Are" from an English opera j
entitled "The Immortal Hour" and
the Serenade from Bizet's "La
Jolie Fille de Perth" as encore
selections.
