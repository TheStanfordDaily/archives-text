# El Toros Lift Axe, Then Give It Back To Victorious Cal
## 
### 
Stanford almost kept the Axe—
regardless of who won the Big
Game.
According to ASSU Vice-Presi
i dent Sue Coshow, during the
game Bill Crookston, Axe Society
chairman, had the Axe with him
in the Stanford rooting section.
Two minutes before the game end
ed, five El Toro men—Gary Gie
low, Stan Chessmore, Bill Sars
field, Chris Houser and Rob Schae
fer—took the Axe from his pos
session and went "whipping out
of the stadium."
The mounted trophy, covered by
a coat, was transported down the
steps and out through the gates
surrounded by a huge, milling
crowd leaving the game early.
The five "bodyguards" passed
a group of policemen, cleared the
crowd and fled a block from the
stadium toward their car, when
they suddenly had a change of
heart and decided to return the
Axe, Miss Coshow said.
Th e y turned around, rushed
back through the growing crowd,
uncovered the Axe and marched
across the field, barely in front of
Cal rooters who came swooping
down from the stands.
The men made their way to the
Stanford side, just in time to con
tinue the post-game scheduled
ceremonies. The Axe was turned
over to Bill Duke, head yell lead
er, who in turn gave it to John
I Brodie, who finally presented it
i to California football co-captain
i Don Gilkcy.
