# SU Hungary Drive Totals Over $1500 for Refugees
## Largest Donations Come from Campus Booths; Lagunita Court Tops Contributors with $176.49 
### 
Hungarian Relief Drive totals as of last night hit $1389.36 collected
or pledged.
This figure is still incomplete, said drive chairman Wally Simpson,
vice-president of the Institute of International Relations, which spon
sored the drive in conjunction with Drives Committee.

Funds from the living groups
are nearly all in, he said. "Some
groups have said that their dona
tions will be turned in within the
week."
"The drive exceeded my own
expectations and those of most
others concerned with the drive,"
Simpson said. "It whs trulv an
expression of sympathy for the
Hungarian people who fought so
valiantly for tlneir freedom."
Most of the funds were so
licited by volunteer groups either
as service projects or just be
cause of a desire on the part of
the individual to donate his time
to the project.

By far the largest amount was

Simpson said. These two totaled

Adding the two checks and the

staff members to the aid of the
Hungarian refugees in Austria.

"The drive exceeded my own

Miscellaneous donations were
received from three sources.
Stanford Medical School contrib

at Cubberley Auditorium after
the Political Union program
brought in $31.38.
By far the largest amount was
collected in the booths on campus
and donations turned directly in
to the ASSU office. These
amoutned to $382.85.
Two checks were received
which were written out to relief
organizations that could not be
counted with the campus drive.
Simpson said. These two totaled
$53.
Adding the two checks and the
amount sent directly to San Fran
cisco by two fraternities to the
amount collected, a total of
$1687.36 was donated by Stan
