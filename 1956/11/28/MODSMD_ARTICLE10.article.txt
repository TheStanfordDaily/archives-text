# Hungary Reds Start Arresting Rebel Enemies
## Cold, Hunger, Russian Army Threaten to End Workers' Total Strike 
### 
VIENNA, Nov. 27 (UP)—The
Communist Hungarian puppet
government has started arresting
"criminals and counter-revolution
aries" throughout the country in
a new terror campaign designed
to crush all resistance, dispatches
from Hungary said today.
Hungarian labor leaders admit
ted they were virtually helpless.
Cold and hunger were breaking
up their "total strike'' and send
ing workers back to the job.
Ruthless Tactics
A spokesman for the Budapest
Workers Council told UP Corre
spondent Russell Jones, the only
American newsman left in Buda
pest, that it was 70 per cent cer
tain the ruthless tactics of Pre
mier Janos Kadar would win out.
"Kadar is now rejecting every
demand of the workers, ufcing ar
guments wrought with the help
of 5000 Soviet tanks," the spokes
man said bitterly.
Diplomats coming out of Hun
gary reported the wave of arrests
started even before Kadar's
speech to the country yesterday,
in which he threatened arrests
and blandly rejected demands that
kidnaped former Premier Imre
Nagy be returned to Budapest.
"I solemnly declare that all
criminals and counter-revolution
aries will be sought out and put
on trial," Kadar said in the speech.
Nagy "Removed"
He did not say whether Nagy
came under those classifications.
But he charged that the former
premier had been removed from
the country lest "provocateurs"
kill him for permitting the slaugh
ter of "many Communists" during
the early days of the October re
volt.
There was no indication of
Nagy's whereabouts. He was kid
naped in front of the Yugoslav
embassy by Russian soldiers, in
violation of a safe conduct worked
out by Yugoslavia. Some reports
have said he is in Moscow await
ing a treason trial. Kadar origi
nally said Nagy had gone to Ro
mania "of his own free will."
Kadar himself announced the
first two candidates for trial. He
identified them as journalist Mik
los Gimes and writer Andras Szan
dor, both recognized as "Titoists."
The crackdown was ruthless.
Army Arrested
Russian troops arrested the en
tire 600-man Hungarian army gar
rison at Kegyeshalom, a town
near the Austrian border.
All were charged with helping
refugees escape.
Refugees arriving in Eisenstadt,
Austria, today said they saw the
bodies of 20 Hungarians, shot by
Russian border guards and laid
out in rows to "deter" others from
trying to flee the country.
The workers, trying to achieve
their demands for the return of
Nagy, an independent government
and withdrawal of Russian troops,
could not cope with Soviet armed
might and the onslaught of bitter
winter weather.
Leaders of the total strike called
last Wednesday ruefully admitted
that the order against "criminals
and counter-revolutionaries" could
include almost everyone in Hun
gary.

Nagy, an independent government
and withdrawal of Russian troops,
could not cope with Soviet armed
might and the onslaught of bitter
winter weather.
Leaders of the total strike called
last Wednesday ruefully admitted
that the order against "criminals
and counter-revolutionaries" could
include almost everyone in Hun
gary.
VIENNA, Nov. 27 (UP)—The
Communist Hungarian puppet
government has started arresting
"criminals and counter-revolution
aries" throughout the country in
a new terror campaign designed
to crush all resistance, dispatches
from Hungary said today.
Hungarian labor leaders admit
ted they were virtually helpless.
Cold and hunger were breaking
up their "total strike'' and send
ing workers back to the job.
Ruthless Tactics
A spokesman for the Budapest
Workers Council told UP Corre
spondent Russell Jones, the only
American newsman left in Buda
pest, that it was 70 per cent cer
tain the ruthless tactics of Pre
mier Janos Kadar would win out.
"Kadar is now rejecting every
demand of the workers, ufcing ar
guments wrought with the help
of 5000 Soviet tanks," the spokes
man said bitterly.
Diplomats coming out of Hun
gary reported the wave of arrests
started even before Kadar's
speech to the country yesterday,
in which he threatened arrests
and blandly rejected demands that
kidnaped former Premier Imre
Nagy be returned to Budapest.
"I solemnly declare that all
criminals and counter-revolution
aries will be sought out and put
on trial," Kadar said in the speech.
Nagy "Removed"
He did not say whether Nagy
came under those classifications.
But he charged that the former
premier had been removed from
the country lest "provocateurs"
kill him for permitting the slaugh
ter of "many Communists" during
the early days of the October re
volt.
There was no indication of
Nagy's whereabouts. He was kid
naped in front of the Yugoslav
embassy by Russian soldiers, in
violation of a safe conduct worked
out by Yugoslavia. Some reports
have said he is in Moscow await
ing a treason trial. Kadar origi
nally said Nagy had gone to Ro
mania "of his own free will."
Kadar himself announced the
first two candidates for trial. He
identified them as journalist Mik
los Gimes and writer Andras Szan
dor, both recognized as "Titoists."
The crackdown was ruthless.
Army Arrested
Russian troops arrested the en
tire 600-man Hungarian army gar
rison at Kegyeshalom, a town
near the Austrian border.
All were charged with helping
refugees escape.
Refugees arriving in Eisenstadt,
Austria, today said they saw the
bodies of 20 Hungarians, shot by
Russian border guards and laid
out in rows to "deter" others from
trying to flee the country.

their demands for the return of
Nagy, an independent government
