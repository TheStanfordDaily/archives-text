# British, U.S. Debaters Discuss Nationalism in Verbal Circles
## 20th Century Anachronism Is Question For Stanford, Oxford Forensic Artists 
### Bev Johnson 
Combining witticisms and criticisms, English and American debat
ing techniques and opposing viewpoints, debaters from Stanford and
Oxford universities presented an entertaining and interesting dis
cussion on nationalism last, night in Memorial Auditorium.
Kirk West of Stanford and Alec Grant of Oxford took the affirma-

tive stand on the topic "Is Na
tionalism a Dangerous Anachro
insm in the 20th Century?" Steve
Breyer of Stanford and Roy Dick
son of Oxford answered the ques
tion with a negative view.
Grant opened the debate with
an attempt at defining national
ism. "Nationalism is a word used
to describe attitudes of people we
don't like. In ourselves we call
these attitudes patriotism," he
said.
Generalizations
Nationalism results in false
generalizations about whole
groups of people, Grant said.
"People cannot be classified as
insects."
West, Grant's colleague for the
affirmative stand, spoke .for a
spirit of a world commmunity
with final allegiance not to the
nation but to the world. His con
tention was that nationalism is
out of date in a world of modern
technology.
Both Oxford debaters made lib
eral use of the British custom to
speak out during the other's
speech. Dickson said nationalism
does exist today and is just be
ginning in many parts of the
world. He presented nationalism
as a step in the growth to matu
rity. Grant replied that national
ism does have the characteristics
of adolescence.
Perversion or Good
Dickson and Breyer said that
nationalism is capable of perver
sion but is also capable of great
good. Hungarians used national
ism to rise together as one to
throw off domination.
Breyer said nationalism gives
the motivation to act together
and advance economically. "Na
tionalism is a prime moving force
in the world today. We cannot
possibly call it an anachronism,"
lie said.
Because each university had
one speaker upholding each side
of the question, no winning side
was declared.
Dr. Philip Rhinelander, Dean of
the Stanford School of Humani
ties and Sciences, acted as moder
ator for the debate, final Tuesday
Evening Series presentation for
autumn quarter.

Combining witticisms and criticisms, English and American debat
ing techniques and opposing viewpoints, debaters from Stanford and
Oxford universities presented an entertaining and interesting dis
cussion on nationalism last, night in Memorial Auditorium.
Kirk West of Stanford and Alec Grant of Oxford took the affirma-

tive stand on the topic "Is Na
tionalism a Dangerous Anachro
insm in the 20th Century?" Steve
Breyer of Stanford and Roy Dick
son of Oxford answered the ques
tion with a negative view.
Grant opened the debate with
an attempt at defining national
ism. "Nationalism is a word used
to describe attitudes of people we
don't like. In ourselves we call
these attitudes patriotism," he
said.
Generalizations
Nationalism results in false
generalizations about whole
groups of people, Grant said.
"People cannot be classified as
insects."
West, Grant's colleague for the
affirmative stand, spoke .for a
spirit of a world commmunity
with final allegiance not to the
nation but to the world. His con
tention was that nationalism is
out of date in a world of modern
technology.
Both Oxford debaters made lib
eral use of the British custom to
speak out during the other's
speech. Dickson said nationalism
does exist today and is just be
ginning in many parts of the
world. He presented nationalism
as a step in the growth to matu
rity. Grant replied that national
ism does have the characteristics
of adolescence.
Perversion or Good
Dickson and Breyer said that
nationalism is capable of perver
sion but is also capable of great
good. Hungarians used national
ism to rise together as one to
throw off domination.
Breyer said nationalism gives
the motivation to act together
and advance economically. "Na
tionalism is a prime moving force
in the world today. We cannot
possibly call it an anachronism,"
lie said.
Because each university had
one speaker upholding each side
of the question, no winning side
was declared.
