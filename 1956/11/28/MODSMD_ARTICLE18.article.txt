## Mid-East Land Considers Ties With Russians Aid from Egypt, Syria, Arabians to Replace English Assistance

AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 27 (Up)
Jordan scrapped its military
agreement with Britain today and
demanded the withdrawal of all
British forces from this Middle
Eastern Arab state. It also said it
was considering establishment of
diplomatic relations with Russia.
The decision to abrogate Jor
dan's long-standing military ac
cord with Britain was announced
in the Chamber of Deputies by
Premier Suleiman Al-Nabulsi.
The premier said his govei n
ment had agreed in principle to
accept aid from Egypt, Syria and
Saudi Arabia to compensate for
loss of the $.35 million annual as
sistance Jordan is receiving from
Britain.
Liberation Regime
Al-Nabulsi also announced a
plan to set up a "national libera
tion regime" in Jordan and said
vigorous steps would be taken to
strengthen the nation's armed
forces.
"The government will equip our
armed forces with effective arms,
particularly the air force, and co
operate with Arab countries in
this respect," the premier said,
without further elaboration.
The anti British move was an
nounced in an atmosphere made
tense by Syrian-Jordanian charges
that neighboring Iraq, a Baghdad
Pact ally of Britain, was acting in
league with Israel to foment a
revolt in Syria.
Jordanian officials said today
that some 1000 rifles discovered
in the hands of Bedouins on the
Syria-Jordan border were handed
over to Syrian authorities. Jordan
radio said the arms were made in
Israel and smuggled into Syria
from Iraq.
Safety Threat
The state-controlled radio sa ; d
the alleged arms smuggling con
stituted a threat to the safety of
both Jordan and Syria.
(Iraq's pro-Western government
denied the charges last night and
appealed to the United States for
more arms. Iraq bluntly warned
Syria—reported heavily armed by
Russia—that recent developments
there had assumed "dangerous
proportions.")
The Jordanian premier told Par
liament that the government "is
studying the establishment of dip
lomatic relations with the Soviet
Union and others."
