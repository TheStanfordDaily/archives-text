# A 						Question of Compulsion
## 
### 
For several wffks the editorial page of The
Daily Californian, student newspaper of the
University of California, has been waging a
verbal battle againtt compulsory military train
ing for lower division male students.
In 1940 about 4000 UC students were asked
their opinion on compulsory ROTC, and the
present system was opposed by 75 per cent of
those polled. According to The Daily Califor
nian, this expression of student opinion was
ignored by the regents and no reasons were
given for their refusal to reconsider the require
ment.
Now the student newspaper has again taken
up the cudgel against compulsory ROTC and
is attempting to engender interest on the cam
pus with the goal of changing the minds of the
university regents.
Their crusade is a valid and constructive one
for many r-'aeons.
On the pru'tical side, as The Daily Califor
nian says, "compulsory ROTC could very easily
be defended if the services were to offer some
material gain to those with just the two years'
ser\ ice in the lower division ROTC. For those
who wish to take the full course, there is some
thing concrete that they can obtain from the
course —a high rank upon graduating, and the

pay and privileges to match it. For those who
do not wish to take the course and who <Io not
go into upper division, there is nothing for
them in ROTC."
More abstractly, as the paper brought out,
military training, especkjly when it is com
pulsory, implies adherence to "the strictest
rules of conformity known in the United States
—those practiced by the armed services."
It is highly valid to ask whether students
should be forced to conform—while they are in
a university attempting to gain a liberal edu
cation—to the strict prescriptions of military
conduct which do little to encourage a ques
tioning and independent mind.
We do not question that courses in military
training should be offered as electives, as they
are at Stanford. Students should be free to
choose the types of courses they want, and if
they want to learn military technique it is
proper that these courses should be offered to
train the officers who, however unfortunately,
are.necessary for the defense of this country.
The Daily Californian is championing a
worthy cause, and we hope, along with its
editors, that the Board of Regents rescinds its
ruling on compulsory ROTC and allows its
students the liberality in choice of courses that
is offered here.

nian says, "compulsory ROTC could very easily
be defended if the services were to offer some
material gain to those with just the two years'
ser\ ice in the lower division ROTC. For those
who wish to take the full course, there is some
thing concrete that they can obtain from the
course —a high rank upon graduating, and the

pay and privileges to match it. For those who
do not wish to take the course and who <Io not
go into upper division, there is nothing for
them in ROTC."
More abstractly, as the paper brought out,
military training, especkjly when it is com
pulsory, implies adherence to "the strictest
rules of conformity known in the United States
—those practiced by the armed services."
It is highly valid to ask whether students
should be forced to conform—while they are in
a university attempting to gain a liberal edu
cation—to the strict prescriptions of military
conduct which do little to encourage a ques
tioning and independent mind.
We do not question that courses in military
training should be offered as electives, as they
are at Stanford. Students should be free to
choose the types of courses they want, and if
they want to learn military technique it is
proper that these courses should be offered to
train the officers who, however unfortunately,
are.necessary for the defense of this country.
The Daily Californian is championing a
worthy cause, and we hope, along with its
editors, that the Board of Regents rescinds its
ruling on compulsory ROTC and allows its
students the liberality in choice of courses that
is offered here.
For several wffks the editorial page of The
Daily Californian, student newspaper of the
University of California, has been waging a
verbal battle againtt compulsory military train
ing for lower division male students.
In 1940 about 4000 UC students were asked
their opinion on compulsory ROTC, and the
present system was opposed by 75 per cent of
those polled. According to The Daily Califor
nian, this expression of student opinion was
ignored by the regents and no reasons were
given for their refusal to reconsider the require
ment.
Now the student newspaper has again taken
up the cudgel against compulsory ROTC and
is attempting to engender interest on the cam
pus with the goal of changing the minds of the
university regents.
Their crusade is a valid and constructive one
for many r-'aeons.
On the pru'tical side, as The Daily Califor
nian says, "compulsory ROTC could very easily
