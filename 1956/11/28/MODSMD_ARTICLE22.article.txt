# Fighting the Cold War at Melbourne
## 
### 
The designated purpose ot the Olympic Games
now being held in Melbourne, Aiistralia, is to
promote a genuine feeling of international
friendship through healthy athletic competi
tion.
But since the development of the Cold War,
this purpose has become lost amid political
\ iluperations. The Soviet Union and the United
States are vying for team point honors with ihe
rest of the teams relegated to second-rate po
sitions.
For the last four years there has been con
stant speculation by leading U.S. sports officials
that the American team might lose lo the Soviet
Union. For a contest in which individual per
formances are supposed to be the only relevant

factor, lliig hardly seems the proper attitude.
Several nations have withdrawn from the
games over the Hungarian situation. While this
expression of sympathy may seem admirable,
it seems to indicate that the games have become
an athletic adjunct to United Nations political
debates. The same can he said over the tussle
between Nationalist and Red China over which
Chinese team is entitled to he represented.
And there seems to be a strong parallel be
tween the misconceptions of Southern Califor
nia "football alumni" and the nations of the
world over the true virtue of athletic endeavors.
Il leads us to wonder if the world isn't in a
sorry state if nations won't even allow peaceful
coexistence on the athletic field.
