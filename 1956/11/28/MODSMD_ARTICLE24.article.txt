Editor, The Daily:
• This year's edition of the Big Came bonfire is now another mem
ory in the minds of most students. To many observers this year's
classic was perhaps a bit more dramatic and sensational than pre
vious bonfires, but nevertheless just another link in the chain of
student activities.
To the class of 'GO, however, the Big Came bonfire will be remem
bered as the rallying point, for it was in the final hours of prepara
tion for this event that the freshmen found themselves united.
They demonstrated this unity by sacrificing their Thanksgiving
dinners to hastily prepare a second bonfire so thai the Big ("lame
"spirit" would not be dampened by the absence of a bonfire. 1 wish
to congratulate the class of '60 for' an exhausting job well done.
However, behind the scenes there is another lint hanked group of
sophomores who formed the Bonfire Committee. It was wood col
lecting chairman John Bohn who shaped more than 700 phone calls
into an enormous woodpile. John Rubin, construction chairman, then
created two bonfires out of this pile.
Dave Ward was the propaganda chairman in charge of seeing
thai Ihe outside world (and lire inside workers) knew what was
coming off. Finally, the Oski which burned so well owes his exist
ence to Jerry Coldmari. It was this committee which planned the
bonfire and put, the manpower of the frosh class into the creation of
the West Coast's largest organized fire show.
