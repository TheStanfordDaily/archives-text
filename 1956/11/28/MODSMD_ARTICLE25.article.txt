## Sequoia Has Imposing Article On Education Two Vignettes 
### Dick Frey 
With the autumn 19.% issue
Sequoia begins its second year of
publication today by featuring an
imposing lead article and two
vivid, powerful vignettes from
the international scene.
Dean Philip Rhinelander of
Stanford's School of Humanities
and Sciences in his article "On
General Education" discusses the
aims of general education and
their relationship to the univer
sity, its faculty and its students.
Rhinelander says, ". . . . it is
my view . . . that the ultimate
aim of a college or university, to
which all other aims however im
portant must be secondary, is the
good of its students."
He believes, he said, that spe
cialization in one's chosen field is
necessary, and that atomism
rather than specialization is the
harmful element to the student.
He describes atomism as "a
frame of mind or habit of
thought which is content to treat
each aspect of experience and
each field of inquiry as a sepa
rate, self-contained unit having
no significant connection with
any other."
The teacher's task, then, is to
impait to his pupils "a sense of
the unity of human experience, of
the wholeness of knowledge, of
the macrocosm behind the micro
cosm."
Recruiting Problem
Rhinelander then discusses the
problems of recruiting and train
ing people for teaching in general
education.
"On General Education" is a
highly interesting and timely
essay which continues Sequoia's
tradition of excellent articles.
Gilbert Church's "Letter from
Indonesia" and Nancy Working's
"The Demonstration" are two re
ports on cultural trends abroad.
Church's article surveys briefly

the customs and attitudes prevail
ing today in Indonesia. He applies
a sharp analysis of these atti
tudes in relation to Asia's views
toward the West.
"The Demonstration" is Nancy
Working's vivid account of stu
dent political demonstrations in
Paris, where she studied last
year.
The short-story fare in this is
sue is limited. Vic Lovell's "Mod
ern Man in Search of a Soul" is
a short short which draws a dis
turbing parallel between ele
ments of apparent difference.
Intellectual Humor
"A-Talionis" by Gus Blaisdell is
an attempt at intellectual humor
which doesn't quite succeed.
Also included in this issue are
poems by Sister Mary Jean,
Thorn Gunn and Richard Elman.
Bill Davis' hilarious series of
drawings 1 itled "The Social
Graces" pokes fun at a few of
mankind's most helpless mo
ments.
The cover is Ihe only disap
pointing feature of the magazine.
It reminds one of a Rorschach
ink-blot test running wild.
Outside of this minor defect
this issue's contests show skill in
the selection of interesting and
excellent work, especially in the
article field. That infamous Stan
ford "intellectual vacuum" is a
long way toward being filled by
the high standard of literary fare
that Sequoia presents.
