# LA 						Accountant Tries to Raise Cellar Profits
## 
### 
Aii accountant from the Los An
geles firm of Iloiwath & Hoiwath
arrived on campus yesterday to
determine what can be done to
increase Cellar profits.
He will remain on campus five
or six days to investigate the set
up and to report to the Union's
board of governors with recom
mendations for increased efficien
cy and decreased expenses.
Losing Money
The lower Cellar, operated as a
service to the students, has been
losing money for several years.
Christine Ricker, director of Uni
versity dining halls, estimates the
loss last year exceeded $3000.
The reason, according to Miss
Ricker, is the number of hours
the Cellar must stay open to serve
student needs. At certain times
of the day the lower Cellar is
crowded and at other times near
ly empty.
A large staff is needed to serve
the crowds when they occur. Then
it must remain through the "emp
ty" hours to serve later crowds.
The Cellar is actually running
in competition with itself and
with Cellar units in the dormi
tories.
Snack Bar
The Snack Bar, opened after
World War 11, provides a place
for people to purchase lunch who
would otherwise go to the lower
Cellar. While the whole unit does
make money, the lower Cellar has
been operating in the red. More
over, two separate staffs must be
maintained.
The Cellar unit in the Encina
basement and the "Holes" in the
women's dorm residences also
provide a drain on potential Cel
lar customers.
