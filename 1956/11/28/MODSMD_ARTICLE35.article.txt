may lie a lean year for Stanford
basketball.

has been rated as low as last in
pro-season ratings of the Pacific
Coast Conference. Washington,
Oregon Slate and California have
been tabbed by the experts as the
P( 'C teams 1o watch.
All of the Coast clubs appear
to have a height advantage on the
Cards, which is nothing new. Re
turning non-letterman Clint War

more Dick Haga, (5 feet 1 inches,

Isaacs. Assistance is expected
from three sophomores up from
last season's strong frosh leam,

Ilaga, Paul Neumann and John
Pfleuger.
