# You don't have to be an Old Grad to understand alumni service
## 
### 
Li ii: Mi;\i lii: rsi up is more
than just an easy way of nail
ing down Big Game tickets (al
though it does just that). And
it's more than a lifetime sub
scription to the award-winning
Stanford Review which each
month serves ,a slice of Stan
ford to "alums" all over the
world (although it's that, too).
Stanford Alumni Associa
tion is just another way of
spelling service. To alumni—
through the annual Conference
Series covering a dozen cities,
the Summer Camp, the Alumni
Directory, Reunions, and Myr
iad other projects. To the Uni
versity — in every way we
know how. But above all:
To the students — because
without a never-ending stream
of them there would be no Uni
versity—and no alumni. Make
our I louse a regular port of
call.
Your membership will en
able us to continue our serv
ice to students down through
the years—long after you've
shaken Dr. Sterling by the
hand and tucked your diploma
under your arm. There's some
thing to this concept of serv
ice, you know. Many of
Stanford's finest "products"
contribute valuable time and
money to make this Stanford
Alumni Association a going
concern.
So membership gives you
the feeling of sharing this im
portant work, and you get
your money's worth to boot—
a rare combination.
In othei words—all this and
Big Came tickets too!
Incidentally, life membership
tales are yointj u/> Vec. I —
Saturday. Jf you join now
instead c»/ trailing until after
fit initiation you'll save yourself
$40.
