# Cap and Gown Selects Eight Senior Women as Members
## Honorary Society Parades Through Houses In Black Robes, Tapping Women as Pledges 
### 
A long black-robed line passed through three women's dining halls
last night, tapping eight senior women for membership in Cap and
Gown, women's honorary society.
The seniors tapped were Mary Bell, Jody Downs, Ellie Kronfeld,
Julie Olson, Jane Pyle, Pat Schulze, Kay Thomas and Judy Wharton.

Following the tapping parade
which wove its way through
Hurlburt House and Gavilan and
Loro houses in Florence Moore,
the new members joined the old
members and Cap and Gown
alumnae for a dessert party at
the Women's Clubhouse.
At this time, the pledges were
introduced and given Cap and
Gown pins.
Cap and Gown members are se
lected for their scholarship, lead
ership and contribution to the
University.
Cap and Gown was begun in
1906 as an honorary society for
women who were leaders in stu
dent activities. Members of the
honorary contributed funds
through their annual calendar
sales and other projects for the
construction of the Women's
Clubhouse.
With money collected from the
calendar sales, Cap and Gown
provides scholarships for a do
mestic and foreign scholar, this
year's scholars being Britta Bal
lig, from Austria, and Vicky Hale.
