# Demos to Seek 'Liberal' Laws As in Platform
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (UP)
—A group of Democratic leaders
voted today to create a high-level
advisory committee to promote a
"liberal" legislative program
along the lines of the 1956 party
platform.
The action appeared to be an
attempt to give the Democratic
National Committee a more effec
tive voice in shaping party poli
cies in the new Congress.
During the past four years
these policies have largely been
the handiwork of Senate Demo
cratic Leader Lyndon B. Johnson
and Speaker Sam Rayburn.
"Social Progress"
A resolution adopted by the ex
ecutive committee of the National
committee called on Democratic
lawmakers who will control the
new Congress to enact a program
of "liberal and enlightened social
progress."
It authorized National Chair
man Paul M. Butler to appoint a
17-member advisory committee
"to coordinate and advance ef
forts in behalf of Democratic pro
grams and principles."
Butler was asked whether this
was a slap at the "moderation"
policies espoused by Johnson. He
replied that he was not certain
what the term "moderation"
meant, but said, "I do believe in
the platform of 1956."
Advisory Committee
He said both Johnson and Ray
burn will be invited to serve on
the advisory committee. He also
mentioned Adlai E. Stevenson,
Senator Estes KefauveV\ former
President Truman and Mrs. Elea
nor Roosevelt as other possible
members.
The resolution said the party
"should lose no time in advancing
a plan of action to meet America's
most pressing needs."
Johnson has said he is not in
favor of the move.
