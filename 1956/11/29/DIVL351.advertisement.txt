Alumni Association
You < an measure how much
we value student participation
in the Alumni Association by
two tliinys. We make you eli
gible for membership as soon
as you register for the first
time. And we grant you spe
cial reduced rates —$15 under
scale; right now, $75 cash. Or
$10 down and the rest spread
out over seven years. You
can't hardly beat that for a
deal.

Ih'cember I. After this month,
student life memberships will
cost $100; regular life member
ships will set the buyer back
$115. The student who joins
now, or promotes a gift mem
bership from the family, will
end up $40 ahead of the slow
poke who waits until after
graduation ("when I'll have
more money").
Remember this: Life mem
bership rates, like Stanford tui
tion, never go down. Only up.
There were increases in 1939,
1947, 1952-—and'now again.
Your Econ professors tell you
that the entire history of
money is inflationary. Add to
this our own increasing life
expectancy and expanding
Alumni Association services
and you can plainly see that
you can never join for any
less than you can this month.
