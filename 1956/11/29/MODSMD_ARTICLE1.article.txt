# REFUGEES JUST LAUGH
## Hungary Offers 'Blanket Pardon' to Fleeing Rebels 
### 
VIENNA, Nov. 28 (UP)- Hungary's puppet government offered a
blanket pardon today to any of 92,000-odd "illegal" refugees who re
turn home before New Year's.
The official Budapest radio said a decree will be published "short
ly" promising amnesty to any of the thousands of men, women and

children who have braved Rus
sian guns and sub-zero weather
to flee to the West â€” provided
they return this year.
Another decree offering a gen
eral pardon for "several other
crimes" is in preparation, the of-,
ricial radio said.
Hungarian refugees in Aus
trian emergency camps received
the offer with bitter laughter.
None showed the slightest inter
est in taking advantage of it.
Refugee Flow
Despite the tightened Soviet
border precautions which have
stemmed the flow of refugees
somewhat in the past few days,
'1800 Hungarians made their way
to this country in the past 24
hours. A total of 92,325 refugees
have been registered by authori
ties here since Oct. 28.
While puppet Premier Janos
Kadar tried to woo anti-Russian
Hungarians abroad, reports from
Budapest said his regime is crack
ing down ruthlessly on foes of
the Soviet at home.
Kadar himself denounced anti-
Soviet writers Andras Szandor
and Miklos Gimmes last night as
"criminal counterrevolutionaries"
who will be "sought out and put
on trial."
Reports reaching here today
said Szandor has been arrested,
but there was no word as to
Gimmes' fate.
Szandor, a member of the Pe
toefi Club whose anti-Russian
demonstrations touched off the
Hungarian revolt, is the latest of
a number of fighters for freedom
reported under arrest in Hun
gary.
India, Red China
Radio Budapest also hinted to
day that the Kadar regime hopes
India and Red China may be able
to persuade Russia to agree to
some sort of a compromise in
Hungary.
An official broadcast said the
talks scheduled to take place be
tween Red China's Premier Chou
En-lai and India's Premier Jawa
harlal Nehru in the next two
weeks may have "an important
effect on Hungary."
The Communist radio in China
has repeatedly echoed the Soviet
charge that the Hungarian rebels
are "fascist counterrevolutiona
ries," but the Budapest broadcast
er said a Communist newspaper
in that country has- expressed
hope that Russia can be per
suaded to "repair" relations with
Hungary.
Mounting opposition pressure
in the Indian parliament last
week constrained Nehru to ac
knowledge that "Soviet armies
were there (in Hungary) against
the wishes of the Hungarian peo
ple," but he refused to criticize
the Kadar regime.
