The United Slates was under
stood to believe that this would

letter from Lloyd
The UN secretary - general re
leased a letter from British For
eign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd that
Egypt had ordered "thousands" of
British subjects to leave Egypt
"within a few days."
"This operation is being canned
out with indiscriminate and brutal
haste against people who have
given service to Egypt and have
spent their lives in that country,"
Lloyd said.
Hammarskjold said virtually all
4100 UN troops pledged to the
force would be posted out within
two weeks to save the peace. He
said the UN was aiming at a 6000-
man force.
Sabry Warns
Meanwhile, Ali Sabry, Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser's
chief political aide, warned in
Cairo that fighting may be re
sumed in Egypt unless "aggres
sive forces" are withdrawn imme
diately.
Sabry warned that if Britain,
France and Israel ignore the UN
resolutions for immediate with
drawal of their troops from the
country, the Egyptian government
will take measures that could lead
to a world war.
In London, the British Admir
alty announced it has dispatched
"large reinforcements" to join the
eight salvage ships already work
ing at clearing out Suez Canal ob
structiohs, despite Egyptian objec
tions that it should do the job
with UN aid.
Semi-official Turkish sources in
Ankara warned that Syria was
massing troops on the Lebanese
border in an apparent attempt to
force Lebanon into the pro-Com
munist camp.
Syria, Iraq
The Israeli radio Jerusalem,
quoting Syrian sources, reported
Turkey itself had massed 35,000
troops along the Syrian frontier,
including an infantry brigade and
an armored battalion.
Syria also was embroiled in a
bitter dispute with Iraq, which it
charges is trying to foment a rev
olution against the Syrian regime.
The Middle East News Agency

today as saying that "massive"
demonstrations had broken out in
the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. It
said 22 persons were killed and
60 wounded in the rioting.
