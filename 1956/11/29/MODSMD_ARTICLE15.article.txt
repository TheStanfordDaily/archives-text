# Symphony Ticket Exchange Set Up
## 
### 
Holders of San Francisco Sym
phony season tickets may turn in
individual tickets, and non-holders
may repurchase them, through a
symphony ticket exchange pro
gram set up by the Concert Series
Office.
According to Dick Lee, Concert
Series manager, this is a non
profit activity. Tickets will sell
for $1, $1.35 and $1.73.
Today is the symphony's first
concert, and students desiring to
take advantage of this exchange
are urged to report to the Concert
Series office in the Nitery as soon
as possible. Office hours are 1 to
5 p.m.. Monday through Friday.
Ticket exchanges for concerts
on Dec. 6. 13, 20 and Jan. 3 will
be conducted during dead week
and on registration day.
