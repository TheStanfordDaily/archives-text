## Russian Reply Follows U.S. Arms Charge Red Minister Repeats Soviet Peace Claims; Accuses 'Aggressors' 
### 
COPENHAGEN, Den m a rk ,
Nov. 28 (UP' Soviet Foreign
Minister Dmitri T. Shepilov said
here today he had "incontestable
information" that the British,
French and Israelis intend to at
tack Syria, Lebanon. Egypt and
other Middle East countries.
Shepilov made the statement,
here during a stopover on liis
way back from the United Na
tions Assembly meeting in New
York.
It was not clear whether Shepi
lov's inclusion of Egypt in his
charge indicated he was referring
to events before the invasion of
Egypt or whether he meant a
present threat.
U.S. Charge
Shepilov's statement followed a
U.S. State Department charge
that Russia was creating new ten
sions in the Middle East by send
ing "substantial shipments" of
arms into Syria.
The Soviet foreign minister had
been pointedly silent earlier to
day when his plane touched down
at Prestwick, in Scotland.
Shepilov spoke briefly to news
papermen at the Copenhagen aii
port.
"I am in possession of incon
testable information to the effect
that Britain, France and Israel in
tend to attack Syria, Lebanon and
Egypt.
"The Soviet Union, on the other
hand, is determined to support
world peace. The imperialists
have not abandoned their plans."
Changes Plans
Shepilov had been scheduled to
switch from a Scandinavian Air
lines plane to a Soviet Ilyushin-14
airliner here but decided to spend
the night in Copenhagen.
Danish authorities imposed the
most drastic security precautions
since World War II at the airport
and around the Soviei embassy
for Shepilov's stopover. The gov
ernment apparently feared a new
outburst of public opinion over-
Soviet action in Hungary.
Sources , close to the Danish
government expressed grave con
cern over the significance of She
pilov's statement here.
They said his remarks might bo
taken as a hint Russia is ready
ing "preventive intervention" in
the troubled Middle East under
the pretext of safeguarding tho
Arabs.
