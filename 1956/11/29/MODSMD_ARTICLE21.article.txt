# "It's a Great Performance Going On—Take My Word for It"
## Sugar-coating the Issue 
### 
Wll F.N A problem EXISTS, the first logical step
in its solution is for the parties involved to
recognize the existence of this problem.
This may seem a moot point, hut it seems
the foreign policy experts in Washington, in
cluding the President, have —at least in state
ments to the public—attempted to sugar-coat
the dangerous rift in the Western alliance with
lovely, optimistic assurances that things aren't
really as had as they seem.
The most recent and glaring example of this
was the statement that came forth from Wash
ington yesterday, with the President's approval,
that "differences [caused by British-French ac
tion in Egypt] in no way should be construed
as a weakening or disrupting of the great bonds
that have so long joined our nation with the
United Kingdom and the Republic of France."

At the same time the statement was issued,
a powerful bloc of the British Conservative
party was bitterly condemning the United
•States for "gravely endangering the North At
lantic alliance."
And, outside of their painfully 9IOW with
drawal of troops from the Suez area and occa
sional conciliatory remarks, Britain and France
remain resolute in their determination to flaunt
world opinion as well as that of this country.
Both the United States and her Western
allies are responsible in different ways for the
disintegration, and both must awake to the
demands and causes of the rift if it is ever to
be sealed over.
Attempting to hide the serious implications
of the problem from the American peoplq and
the world at large will ease jittery nerves, but
will hardly bring about a solution.
