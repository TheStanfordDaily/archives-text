"TaylorV Vroven Inadequacy^
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to "he Daily's editorial of Nov. 27
which decried the hanging in effigy of Coach
Chuck Taylor, I would like to point out that
mute capitulation to Taylor's proven inadequacy
to support his own ill-founded predications is
equally poor sportsmanship.
Let's face it. Taylor continued this year his
rash habit of giving his team a big build-up, ei
ther not realizing Stanford's weakness or not
being honest about it. In either case, his ability
and integrity as a coach are questionable.
When he failed to profit by his mistakes, such
as not devoting enough attention to the art of
kicking extra points, thi:» neglecting to protect
hard-earnea touchdowns against USC, and per
mitted the same kind of fault to cost'the follow
ing two important games, then Taylor certainly
laid himself open to on the
part of even disinterested football fans as well
as devoted students and alumni.
Taylor undershot an easy mark by quite an
embarrassing miss and can honestly be appraised
as the laughing stock of the '56 season, no doubt,
to the deserved delight of the Southland in gen
eral.
Taylor's latest cry to abolish the TD conver
sion from does him no good in my eyes;
if he cannot win the game, should he doctor it
up so it fits his quirks?
The idea behind sports competition is the
overcoming of obstacles within known rules, not
of facilitating a watered-down "victory" by legis
lating away all risks.

Editor, The Daily:
The biased journalism of this newspaper is no

longer to be tolerated. Yesterday's supreme ex
ample was the article on the Hungarian Relief
Drive. While all campus living groups received
itemized listing of donations, The Daily had the
audacity to lump the eating clubs together. I
should like to point out the eating clubs consist
of seven separate, distinct and individual organi
zations. ...
May I suggest that The Daily either print the
itemized account or hereafter relegate itself to
the use of statements similar to those used to
describe the eating clubs, i.e., "the fraternities,
the women's dorms . . . more consistent with
the approach to fair and judicial publishing poli
cies.

Editor's Note: At. I he time the story was
written, the figures of individual eating club
contributions were unavailable to us. With due
apologies to the offended clubs, we list the fol
lowing contributions: Breakers, $15.61; El
Campo, $17; El Capitan, .$30.02; El Cuadro,
$7.20; El Toro, $15.61; El Tigre, $16.38; Eos
Arcos, $8.02.
Greetings from Berlin

co-operation between our universities will con

Greetings from Berlin
Editor, The Daily:
The students of the Free University of Berlin
send the best wishes for a merry Christmas and
a joyous New Year to the students of Stanford.
We hope we shall meet as many of you in
Berlin in 1957 as we met in 1956, and that the
co-operation between our universities will con
tinue to be as successful in the future as it has
been in the last six years.

Editor, The Daily:
In reply to "he Daily's editorial of Nov. 27
which decried the hanging in effigy of Coach
Chuck Taylor, I would like to point out that
mute capitulation to Taylor's proven inadequacy
to support his own ill-founded predications is
equally poor sportsmanship.
Let's face it. Taylor continued this year his
rash habit of giving his team a big build-up, ei
ther not realizing Stanford's weakness or not
being honest about it. In either case, his ability
and integrity as a coach are questionable.
When he failed to profit by his mistakes, such
as not devoting enough attention to the art of
kicking extra points, thi:» neglecting to protect
hard-earnea touchdowns against USC, and per
mitted the same kind of fault to cost'the follow
ing two important games, then Taylor certainly
laid himself open to on the
part of even disinterested football fans as well
as devoted students and alumni.
Taylor undershot an easy mark by quite an
embarrassing miss and can honestly be appraised
as the laughing stock of the '56 season, no doubt,
to the deserved delight of the Southland in gen
eral.
Taylor's latest cry to abolish the TD conver
sion from does him no good in my eyes;
if he cannot win the game, should he doctor it
up so it fits his quirks?
The idea behind sports competition is the
overcoming of obstacles within known rules, not
of facilitating a watered-down "victory" by legis
lating away all risks.

The biased journalism of this newspaper is no

longer to be tolerated. Yesterday's supreme ex
ample was the article on the Hungarian Relief
Drive. While all campus living groups received
itemized listing of donations, The Daily had the
audacity to lump the eating clubs together. I
should like to point out the eating clubs consist
of seven separate, distinct and individual organi
zations. ...
May I suggest that The Daily either print the
itemized account or hereafter relegate itself to
the use of statements similar to those used to
describe the eating clubs, i.e., "the fraternities,
the women's dorms . . . more consistent with
the approach to fair and judicial publishing poli
cies.
