# INTERNATIONAL LIVING
## To Share Foreign Life Abroad U.S. Students Given Chance 
### 
To live abroad is to experiment
in international living. Each sum
mer such an opportunity is of
fered to students who live abroad
for two months with a foreign
family, sharing its daily life.
Typically, going on the Experi
ment means that a group of 10
American students travels to" a
city in a selected country. Each
student lives with a family for
about seven weeks, sharing their
cultural and recreational activi
ties.
Informal Trips
During the last' two weeks of
the living-in period, the American
students and Iheir adopted fami
lies take an informal trip through
t lie country. Time is allowed at
the end of the trip for traveling
independently.
The Experiment, in Internation
al Living was founded 25 years
ago by Donald B. Watt. Based on
the principle that world peace
and understanding will prosper
as people learn to comprehend
(he cultures of other nations, the
Experiment makes it possible for
participants to see a country
through the eyes of its people.
The students live as family mem
bers, thus acquiring a knowledge
more far-reaching than a super
ficial sightseeing tour.
Past Experiments
Stanford has Deen well repre
sented in past Experiments. One
student to participate was John
VandeCamp, who lived with a
machinist's family in Denmark.
To him, the family life was the
best feature of his stay because
he had "adequate time to get ac
quainted with the country rather
than the usual postage stamp
view."
Wyn Wachhorst, who spent
two summers in Germany, re
turned feeling that he had expe

rienoed the real differences he
tween Germany and America.
Italy was Mardy Keyes' home
for a summer. She was surprised
by the preconceptions "her" fam
ily had about America and the
first questions she was asked: the
age of her grandparents, fur in
stance, and whether the Lord's
Prayer means the same in both
languages. To her, international
living is the best way for develop
ing good international relations.
Agreement,
These opinions are seconded by
Steve Breyer and Marilyn Page,
who went to France, Mary Jane
Havens and Beverly Brown, who
lived in Switzerland, and Karen
Frickson, who went to Finland.
Membership in the Experiment
is based upon personal merit and
is open to those between 16 and
30 years. Members are chosen ac
cording to their qualifications
and recommendations.
Details on the necessary quali
fications, applications and further
information on International Liv
ing will be given in an open meet
ing at Bowman Alumni House to
night at 9.
Stanford students who have
gone abroad on the Experiment
in previous years will be present
to answer questions about the
program in such countries as Eu
rope, South America, India, Ja
pan and Nigeria.
