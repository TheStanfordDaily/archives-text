# Cross-Country Season Ends; Track Next
## 
### 
Willi thoughts turning from
cross-country to flat running, the
Stanford distance runners will be
gin to point for the spring track
season. Cross - country season
came to a halt last Tuesday as the
Indians dropped a dual meet to
California at: Berkeley.
Record - wise, the season was
riot too successful; but from an
improvement standpoint, the In
dians did well. Stanford ran to a
28-28 tie with San Jose State in
the year's first meet.
Beaten by LJSO
Tn their PCC opener, the In
dians were beaten by USC, and
also dropped a practice meet to
Cal. The second of three South
ern Division losses was received
at the hands of UCLA in Los An
geles.
The harriers' brightest day was
against San Jose and Camp Pen
dleton as Stanford soundly de
feated both teams.
Coach Pay ton Jordan's squad
finished third in the Northern
California championships at San
Jose, finishing only four points
behind Cal and one point back of
the host club. Then came the "Big
Meet" and another loss to Cal.
Big Three
Doug Martin, Ralph Love and
Bob Monzingo stood out as the
top three throughout most of the
season. Martin and Love will both
be vital cogs on the track team as
they run in the long races. Mon
zingo is only a freshman and is
displaying great potential for his
remaining three and a half years
at Stanford.
Another freshman, Roger Beck,
showed perhaps the greatest indi
vidual improvement during the
season. Maury Graves, although
not: quite living up to expecta
tions, helped the team. Ernie Cun
liffe, Don Richardson and War
ren Woorl were the others who
made up the backbone of the var
sity team.
