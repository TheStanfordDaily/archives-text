### 
TUKAJ (Tokay), Hungary, Nov.
28 (UP) More than 1500 young
Hungarian guerrillas are battling
tho Russians in the forests along
the eastern frontier near this fa
mous old wine town, it was re
ported today.
Sources in contact with the
guerrillas said most of the un
vanquished freedom fighters are
students from Sarospatak College
irr nearby Satoral-Jau.jhely. The
school was tounded by Protestants
and formerly specialized in Ihe
study of English, Anglo-American
history and similar subjects.
The young Hungarians were re
porter! to have plenty of food,
small arms and ammunition and
two Russian 85mm (3.3-inch) anti
tank guns they stole from their
crews after getting Ihe Soviet
gunners drunk.
The guerrillas have scant am
munition for their anti tank guns,
the sources said, but the knowl
edge that they have them has
been enough so far to deter the
Russians from attempting to con
quer the wild, broken country
held by their foes.
They control the countryside so
completely, the sources said, that
the Russians dare travel only on
the main roads â€”and then only
during the day.
