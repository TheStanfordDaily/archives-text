# LASSU Okays Destination of Relief Money
## Main Action Concerns 'Weighty' Problems Of By-Laws, Minutes 
### Dave Scott Associate Editor 
Legislature held its last meet
ing of the quarter last night and
spent most of it tackling the
weighty problems of constitution,
bylaws and minutes.
For a few brief moments it
paused on the more serious prob
lems of the Hungarian relief drive
and the Model United Nations con
ference on campus next April.
It approved unanimously Hun
garian Drive Chairman Wa 11 y
Simpson's request that the money
collected in last Tuesday's drive
be sent to the United Hungarian
Relief Committee.
The committee headquarters in
San Francisco will send the funds
directly to Austria for the aid of
Hungarian youth and children.
The money will be sent Monday
when all has been collected. So
far $1574.36 has been collected,
according to Simpson.
Model UN
Legislature also approved Model
UN Chairman Chuck Reynolds'
request that the maximum num
ber of delegates allowed be raised
to 550 from 400, provided that
Reynolds can prove to a three
man committee headed by ASSU
President Bob Freelen that ade
quate facilities can be provided.
The first serious debate of the
evening revolved around minutes
of the first-year law students and
the graduate students. Legisla
ture ended up by not allowing a
graduate mixer held a week ago!
Despite Assistant to the Presi
dent Steve Tallent's admonition
that the by-laws forbid a party
during dead week and that they
should be followed, Legislature re
fused to strike down the first-year
law minutes and allowed a spir
ited social gathering during dead
week.
Branner Constitution
After approval or the Graduate
Students Association constitution
legalizing future graduate mixers,
Legislature struck down the Bran
ner Hall constitution, condemning
its rather noble-sounding pream
ble.
Said preamble read: "We, the
residents of Branner Hall, in order
to form a more perfect hall, estab
lish justice, insure domestic tran
quility, provide for the common
defense, promote the general wel
fare and secure Ihe blessings of
liberty to ourselves and for pos
terity, do ordain and establish this
constitution for Branner Hall of
Stanford University."
"The whole constitution doesn't
have the sensitivity to words that
a fifth-grader should have," Tal
lent remarked.
Political Union
Legislature also struck down,
earlier in the evening, the min
utes of Political Union on the
ground that the president, of the
organization, Cliff Kimbcr, is not
a registered student.
And finally Ram's Head's con
stitution was approved, despite
the pleas of some absent Ram's
Head directors, through a Legis
lature member, that the new con
stitution might make them direct
plays they would not want to.
Amid cries of "A merry Christ
mas to all!" Freelen adjourned
the meeting, the next session to
be held January 8.
