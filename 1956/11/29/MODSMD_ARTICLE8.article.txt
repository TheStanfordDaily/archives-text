# 'L' Wing of Woodpecker Lodge Razed for Geophysics Addition
## Corp Yard Demolishes Former Women's Gym To Construct New $100,000 Petroleum Annex 
### 
The "L" wing of Woodpecker Lodge is being razed bv the Cor
poration Yard to make room for a $100,000 petroleum wing addition
to the Geophysics Building.
The new petroleum wing will combine with Ihe old Geophysics
Building, located north of Woodpecker, to form a U-shaped struc-

ture, according to John Smart
Lynd, Planning Office planning
assistant.
The Corp Yard will complete
demolishing the "L" wing of
Woodpecker in about 10 days. In
cluded in the wing were two first
floor rehearsal rooms used by the
Music Department and a second
floor studio used by the Art De
partment.
Woodpecker Lodge has a long
and varied history. It was used
at one time as a carriage house
and then served as a women's
gymnasium during the early days
of the University until the present
women's physical education facili
ties were constructed.
The building received its name
from the number of woodpeckers
which inhabit the building and
have left their marks all over the
old wooden structure.
The Music Department will soon
have the facilities of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, now under construc
tion, to replace the Woodpecker
rooms.
The firm of Knutsen & Son will
begin construction of the new pe
troleum wing next mouth.
