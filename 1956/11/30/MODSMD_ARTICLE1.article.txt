# New Music Building is Beginning of Multi-Unit Student Activity Center
## 
### Ellen Spiegl, Staff Editor 
In a few years' time Stanford will have a complete Student Ac
tivities Center, and evidences of its future presence are already
showing.
Covering a 15-acre area, the center will include the Music Center,
the Tresidder Memorial Building, new post office, new bookstore
and remodeled Union, Union residence and Men's and Women's
clubhouses.
It is hoped ;lie center will serve as the core of the campus, as a
unit in itself. No automobile traffic will run through it, but plans
are being made for parking lots nearby to accommodate students
and visitors.
First of the buildings to be completed will be the Music Center,
now under construction across the street from the post office. It is
estimated the building will be ready for use in April.
It will house the Department of Music and, on the main floor,
the Florence Hellman Dinkelspiel Memorial Auditorium, with a
seating capacity of 728. Also on the ground-floor level will be a
rehearsal hall and practice rooms. The all-glass entrance lobby will
open on a wide terrace bordered at the other end by the Tresidder
Memorial Building.

The Music Center, designed by San Francisco architect Milton
Pfluger, is being included in the Student Activities Center "because
of its particular nature and audience factor," according to Director
of Planning Eldridge T. Spencer in a booklet prepared recently on
the center.
Tresidder Memorial Building, named for Stanford's late Presi
dent Donald B. Tresidder, is also under way. Pieliminary plans by
San Francisco architects Spencer & Ambrose have been approved
by the Board of Trustees.
This building will be in several sections. The pavilion will house
a ballroom, a lounge and catering facilities for University functions.
Another unit of the memorial building will provide offices and
conference rooms for student government officials and organiza
tions. A recreation building- an underground level of the memorial
running beneath the other two units—will house a bowling alley,
lounge and a large recreation room with billiard tables, ping-pong
equipment and card tables. This level will connect with the Union
dining facilities.
Architect John Warneke designed the new post office for the
area. Plans are in the final stages and construction will begin soon

on the lot north of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house.
This building will replace the present post office, now 36 years
old. Plans call for a large one-story building with a gable roof and
exterior of redwood and glass.
Pieliminary plans for the bookstore have also been presented
for consideration by Warneke, but no final plans or construction
date has been set. It will go in the area near Madrofto, which will
be torn down before work on the bookstore can begin.
Still in the talking stage are plans for remodeling the Union.
However, according to the Planning Office, it will eventually contain
a public dining room, a group of private dining rooms, a cafeteria,
faculty dining and lounge rooms and extensive kitchens and pantries
to serve these dining rooms.
The Union residence will also be remodeled, with the upper two
floors providing 45 residential hotel rooms with bath and four larger
suites for the use of distinguished guests on campus.
University plans for remodeling the Women's and Men's club
houses are beginning to take form in addition to the new construc
tion planned. The Women's Clubhouse will provide offices and con
ference rooms for women's organizations and an apartment for a
resident hostess on the first floor.

The building will also have access to a sunken garden terrace
between it and the Tresidder Memorial Building.
Alterations in the Men's Clubhouse-—now housing the Cellar and
ASSU offices—call for a snack bar, coffee shop, barber shop and
drug store on the first floor and offices on the second anil third
floors, including meeting rooms and workrooms for student pub
lications.
Finally, it is hoped the area behind the Music Center will become
a 400-car parking lot for on-campus students and visitors. It would
stretch back to Moore Hall, with a landscaped, lighted pedestrian
walkway to the hall.
Landscape architect John Church, who did the work at Moore,
has been hired to do the landscaping for all the Student Activities
Center buildings and also the courts and pedestrian passages be
tween them.
All the organizational planning for the center has been done by
the University Planning Office over a period of years.
In his recent report Director Spencer said, "This area will con
tribute vastly to the cultural, social and recreational life of the Uni
versity's student body, faculty, staff and visitors and will better for
all time their way of life at Stanford."
