# Hughes: U.S. Foreign Policy â€˜Fails to Put First Things First'
## Says Britain, France 'Desperate Governments' In Speech Before Political Science Fraternity 
### 
"We have failed to put first things first," said H. Stuart Hughes,
head of the history department, last night, in a review and criticism
of United States foreign policy.
lie spoke at a banquet of Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary political sci
ence fraternity, at L'Omelette restaurant, before an audience of

about 35 professors and students.
Hughes first reviewed the situ
ation in Hungary and the Middle
East, and told of American, Brit
ish and French policies toward
those areas.
He said the situation in Hun
gary was hopeless after it had
passed the Titoist stage. The only
possbile solution for the satellites
is through a Titoist stage. The
only gain in that whole situation
is the clear split in the ranks of
the Communist world.
"View Not. Equal"
"Our view of other nations is
not equal. We take more of an
interest in those countries we fcc*l
closest to. Hungary was one of
the closest to us in that area. Brit
ain and Israel are in our own cul
tural tradition.
"It may be that the countries in
our own group may not act as we
always want them to, but we
can't afford to let them go by
the wayside.
"Let us not suggest that we
have anything so much in com
mon with the still colonized coun
tries in North Africa and Asia.
We were not a former colonial
nation like India and Egypt. We
have at least as much in common
with the French in North Africa
as we do with Egypt."
Crisis Unique
"It has not been mentioned
enough that this crisis is unique."
Hughes said. "First, we are deal
ing with three desperate govern
ments: Britain, France and
Egypt. Also there are the ques
tions of French colonials, Israel's
borders and Colonel Nasser.
"Our pol-ey toward Nasser has
been one of vacillation, - ' Hughes
remarked.
More recently came Israel's at
tack and Russian "volunteers." "I
think the Russian 'volunteer' of
fer was a bluff and the United
States failed to call it,"the pro
fessor said.
The only alternative is to sug
gest that a package deal be
worked out including all the ma
jor problems, Hughes advised.

think the Russian 'volunteer' of
fer was a bluff and the United
States failed to call it,"the pro
fessor said.
The only alternative is to sug
gest that a package deal be
worked out including all the ma

H. STUART HUGHES
"A Muddle of Policy"
"We have failed to put first things first," said H. Stuart Hughes,
head of the history department, last night, in a review and criticism
of United States foreign policy.
lie spoke at a banquet of Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary political sci
ence fraternity, at L'Omelette restaurant, before an audience of

about 35 professors and students.
Hughes first reviewed the situ
ation in Hungary and the Middle
East, and told of American, Brit
ish and French policies toward
those areas.
He said the situation in Hun
gary was hopeless after it had
passed the Titoist stage. The only
possbile solution for the satellites
is through a Titoist stage. The
only gain in that whole situation
is the clear split in the ranks of
the Communist world.
"View Not. Equal"
"Our view of other nations is
not equal. We take more of an
interest in those countries we fcc*l
closest to. Hungary was one of
the closest to us in that area. Brit
ain and Israel are in our own cul
tural tradition.
"It may be that the countries in
our own group may not act as we
always want them to, but we
can't afford to let them go by
the wayside.
"Let us not suggest that we
have anything so much in com
mon with the still colonized coun
tries in North Africa and Asia.
We were not a former colonial
nation like India and Egypt. We
have at least as much in common
with the French in North Africa
as we do with Egypt."
Crisis Unique
"It has not been mentioned
enough that this crisis is unique."
Hughes said. "First, we are deal
ing with three desperate govern
ments: Britain, France and
Egypt. Also there are the ques
tions of French colonials, Israel's
borders and Colonel Nasser.
"Our pol-ey toward Nasser has
been one of vacillation, - ' Hughes
remarked.
More recently came Israel's at
tack and Russian "volunteers." "I
think the Russian 'volunteer' of
fer was a bluff and the United
States failed to call it,"the pro
fessor said.
The only alternative is to sug
gest that a package deal be
worked out including all the ma
jor problems, Hughes advised.
