## 
### 
•i
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (UP)
—The United States today sternly
warned Russia, Syria and other
nations against any attack on
members of the Baghdad Pact.
In a statement approved by
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles,
the State Department said any
threat to pact nations would be
regarded with "utmost gravity"
by this country.
The past joins Turkey, Iran,
Iraq, Pakistan and Britain in a
mutual defense alliance. While
the statement did not mention any
ibossible aggressor by name, offi
cials said it was aimed at Russia,
Syria or any other nation that
might threaten pact members.
Critical Situation
U.S. officials refused to say
whether the statement was
prompted by any imminent threat
of attack on any Baghdad powers.
They said, however, that the situ
ation in the area is so critical it
could explode into violence with
little advance notice.
America and Britain have be
come increasingly alarmed over
Russian arms shipments to Syria,
which borders on Iraq and Tur
key, two Baghdad Pact members.
Fears have been expressed that
Moscow may be seeking a spring
board in Syria for a possible
threat to Turkey.
The Turkish newspaper Milliyet.
reported in Istanbul today that
Russia is smuggling arms to
Syria in ships passing illegally
through the Turkish Straits. The
Turkish government was said to
be taking a "very grave" view of
the emergence of a pro-Russian
regime in Syria.
To Save Peace
Members of the Baghdad Pact,
in recent meetings not attended
by Britain, have urged the United
States to join the alliance now as
the best way to save the peace in
the Middle East.
The United States, which sug
gested the pact in the first place,
has indicated up to now it is not
yet ready to join.
