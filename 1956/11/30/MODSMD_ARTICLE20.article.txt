# The 						Face Will Change
## 
### 
Stanford is not only on the move; it's gal
loping.
Alumni who returned to the University the
past week end were astonished by the renova
tion and addition that have changed the face
of rlie university they once knew. And, judging
by the growth of the past several years, students
returning in four or five years will be struck
similarly.
This physical growth, which is partly in
answer lo the present and planned increases in
enrollment, has been criticized for its tendency
lo turn Stanford into an academic machine that

impersonally pours out torrents of students
each year.
fiut Stanford, by increasing its enrollment
ami expanding its physical plant, has accepted
a greater share of the responsibility of educat
ing the growing number of young people whose
desires and capabilities qualify- them for a col
lege education.
But, at the same time, this moral responsi
bility must be coupled with continued efforts
lo keep the Stanford education a personal one.
If ibis is done, Stanford's face may change, but
the spirit and quality behind it will remain
the same.
