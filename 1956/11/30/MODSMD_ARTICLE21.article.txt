# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## What Does the Future Hold for the Demos? 
### WALLY SIMPSON JIM PALMER 
With the national elections over, the Demo
cratic party finds itself in the position of having
io rebuild and reorganize for the next presidential
race.
The party finds itself in a relatively unique
position, however, in that not ali was lost in the
election. In fact, in some areas major gains were
made, such as in the governorships.
The Democrats still have a good base in Con
gross, since they control both houses. They can
even expect to make gains there in 1958 since in
off-year elections the party not in power in the
Administration usually makes gains.
The major question, unanswerable at this time,
is that of a successor to Adlai Stevenson as party
leader. Presumably Stevenson will retain nominal
leadership until an apparent successor becomes
chief party spokesman.
Among the liberals, up - and - coming Senator
John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts will probably
come into the foreground as leading spokesman,
lie will undoubtedly get competition from Gov
ernor Averell Harriman of New York. Both Har
riman and Kennedy are probably eyeing 1960 as
the year of promise for themselves.
Republican inroads into traditionally solid Dem
ocratic Southern states will doubtless cause a
flurry of reorganization of state Democratic party
systems in those areas. This will be good to the
Democratic party as a whole since in the reorgan
ization process there is a possibility that Demo
cratic liberals in the South may gain greater in
fluence in the party system.
Greater emphasis will probably be placed upon
grass-roots work in the various states. Present
Democratic National Chairman Paul Butler has
been greatly instrumental in increasing grass
roots party work. He may be kept in his present
position, but this is doubtful and depends upon
which personality emerges as dominant figure in
the Democratic party.
It will be interesting to watch how personali
ties will emerge. Much of politics is determined
in the small conferences that will be held in the
near future throughout the country.
Another interesting thing to watch will be the
proposed high-level advisory group which is sup
posed to promote a liberal legislative program
along the lines of the 195*' party platform. A
dominant personality coul -ell emerge from this
group, if it is set up by th democratic party.
Senate Majority Leader Lyndon F. Johnson is
in opposition to this proposed group. If he pre
vails, it. will be an indication of his strength; if
not, then look for a strong liberal to take the
dominant role in national Democratic policy
making.

Democrats face an extensive rebuilding job on
the national level during the coming years.
First, they must pick a new chairman to suc
ceed Paul Butler and a new leader to replace
Adlai Stevenson. During the four years between
presidential elections it is common for Ihe con
gressional leaders of the "out" party to exercise
the leadership necessary to keep the show on the
road.
This is a major turning point for the Demo
crats. The direction they select will determine
the future success of the party in national elec
tions.
In the search for a winning combination the
Democrats will look fo their strength in Congress.
Important figures in the shaping of the future
will certainly include Senator Lyndon B. Johnson,
Speaker Sam Rayburn, and Senators Kennedy,
Morse, Lausche arid perhaps Kefauver.
The twice-defeated Stevenson is destined to fade
away into the shadows of private life. Me leaves
behind him a battered and divided party.
The strongest faction of the party appears to
be the young liberals, but they are opposed by
the older and less idealed New Deal-Fair Deal
ghosts and the Southern conservatives.
Whether the younger element and its leader-
Senator Kennedy—can successfully gain the reins
of the party is a question that will emerge in the
conferences scheduled in the months ahead.
The Truman-Harriman forces still have a meas
ure of strength, and the Southerners are always
in an imposing position in the party. The young
sters have a rocky road ahead of them. Unless
they can gain power it appears that any rebuild
ing job will debut a false facade for the same old
party that discredited itself in 20 years of rule
and has never been the same since.
Rebuilding is desperately needed on the local
levels, too. Chicago and New Jersey machines
have crumbled to dust. New York is losing
strength. Pennsylvania is the only brilliant light
left in the Democratic hopes in the North.
The South has revolted in the past Ihree na
tional elections, and no longer can the Democrats
boast of solid unily there. Rebuilding is needed
in the South.
The 1958 congressional elections will test the
inroads on Republican strength that Democrats
make in the next two years. The Senate seats'on
ihe block will be those taken in Ihe Eisenhower
landslide of 1952.
The first step is to get rid of that element which
has distorted the democratic precepts of the party
during the past 25 years.

they can gain power it appears that any rebuild
ing job will debut a false facade for the same old
party that discredited itself in 20 years of rule
and has never been the same since.
Rebuilding is desperately needed on the local
levels, too. Chicago and New Jersey machines
have crumbled to dust. New York is losing
strength. Pennsylvania is the only brilliant light
left in the Democratic hopes in the North.
The South has revolted in the past Ihree na
tional elections, and no longer can the Democrats
boast of solid unily there. Rebuilding is needed
in the South.
The 1958 congressional elections will test the
inroads on Republican strength that Democrats
make in the next two years. The Senate seats'on
ihe block will be those taken in Ihe Eisenhower
landslide of 1952.
The first step is to get rid of that element which
has distorted the democratic precepts of the party
during the past 25 years.
With the national elections over, the Demo
cratic party finds itself in the position of having
io rebuild and reorganize for the next presidential
race.
The party finds itself in a relatively unique
position, however, in that not ali was lost in the
election. In fact, in some areas major gains were
made, such as in the governorships.
The Democrats still have a good base in Con
gross, since they control both houses. They can
even expect to make gains there in 1958 since in
off-year elections the party not in power in the
Administration usually makes gains.
The major question, unanswerable at this time,
is that of a successor to Adlai Stevenson as party
leader. Presumably Stevenson will retain nominal
leadership until an apparent successor becomes
chief party spokesman.
Among the liberals, up - and - coming Senator
John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts will probably
come into the foreground as leading spokesman,
lie will undoubtedly get competition from Gov
ernor Averell Harriman of New York. Both Har
riman and Kennedy are probably eyeing 1960 as
the year of promise for themselves.
Republican inroads into traditionally solid Dem
ocratic Southern states will doubtless cause a
flurry of reorganization of state Democratic party
systems in those areas. This will be good to the
Democratic party as a whole since in the reorgan
ization process there is a possibility that Demo
cratic liberals in the South may gain greater in
fluence in the party system.
Greater emphasis will probably be placed upon
grass-roots work in the various states. Present
Democratic National Chairman Paul Butler has
been greatly instrumental in increasing grass
roots party work. He may be kept in his present
position, but this is doubtful and depends upon
which personality emerges as dominant figure in
the Democratic party.
It will be interesting to watch how personali
ties will emerge. Much of politics is determined
in the small conferences that will be held in the
near future throughout the country.
Another interesting thing to watch will be the
proposed high-level advisory group which is sup
posed to promote a liberal legislative program
along the lines of the 195*' party platform. A
dominant personality coul -ell emerge from this
group, if it is set up by th democratic party.
Senate Majority Leader Lyndon F. Johnson is
in opposition to this proposed group. If he pre
vails, it. will be an indication of his strength; if
not, then look for a strong liberal to take the
dominant role in national Democratic policy
making.

Democrats face an extensive rebuilding job on
the national level during the coming years.
First, they must pick a new chairman to suc
ceed Paul Butler and a new leader to replace
Adlai Stevenson. During the four years between
presidential elections it is common for Ihe con
gressional leaders of the "out" party to exercise
the leadership necessary to keep the show on the
road.
This is a major turning point for the Demo
crats. The direction they select will determine
the future success of the party in national elec
tions.
In the search for a winning combination the
Democrats will look fo their strength in Congress.
Important figures in the shaping of the future
will certainly include Senator Lyndon B. Johnson,
Speaker Sam Rayburn, and Senators Kennedy,
Morse, Lausche arid perhaps Kefauver.
The twice-defeated Stevenson is destined to fade
away into the shadows of private life. Me leaves
behind him a battered and divided party.
The strongest faction of the party appears to
be the young liberals, but they are opposed by
the older and less idealed New Deal-Fair Deal
ghosts and the Southern conservatives.
Whether the younger element and its leader-
Senator Kennedy—can successfully gain the reins
of the party is a question that will emerge in the
conferences scheduled in the months ahead.
The Truman-Harriman forces still have a meas
ure of strength, and the Southerners are always
in an imposing position in the party. The young
sters have a rocky road ahead of them. Unless

Democrats will look fo their strength in Congress.
Important figures in the shaping of the future
will certainly include Senator Lyndon B. Johnson,
Speaker Sam Rayburn, and Senators Kennedy,
Morse, Lausche arid perhaps Kefauver.
The twice-defeated Stevenson is destined to fade
away into the shadows of private life. Me leaves
behind him a battered and divided party.
The strongest faction of the party appears to
be the young liberals, but they are opposed by
the older and less idealed New Deal-Fair Deal
ghosts and the Southern conservatives.
Whether the younger element and its leader-
Senator Kennedy—can successfully gain the reins
of the party is a question that will emerge in the
conferences scheduled in the months ahead.
The Truman-Harriman forces still have a meas
ure of strength, and the Southerners are always
in an imposing position in the party. The young
sters have a rocky road ahead of them. Unless
they can gain power it appears that any rebuild
ing job will debut a false facade for the same old
party that discredited itself in 20 years of rule
and has never been the same since.
Rebuilding is desperately needed on the local
levels, too. Chicago and New Jersey machines
have crumbled to dust. New York is losing
strength. Pennsylvania is the only brilliant light
left in the Democratic hopes in the North.
The South has revolted in the past Ihree na
tional elections, and no longer can the Democrats
boast of solid unily there. Rebuilding is needed
in the South.
The 1958 congressional elections will test the
inroads on Republican strength that Democrats
make in the next two years. The Senate seats'on
ihe block will be those taken in Ihe Eisenhower
landslide of 1952.
The first step is to get rid of that element which
has distorted the democratic precepts of the party
during the past 25 years.
With the national elections over, the Demo
cratic party finds itself in the position of having
io rebuild and reorganize for the next presidential
race.
The party finds itself in a relatively unique
position, however, in that not ali was lost in the
election. In fact, in some areas major gains were
made, such as in the governorships.
The Democrats still have a good base in Con
gross, since they control both houses. They can
even expect to make gains there in 1958 since in
off-year elections the party not in power in the
Administration usually makes gains.
The major question, unanswerable at this time,
is that of a successor to Adlai Stevenson as party
leader. Presumably Stevenson will retain nominal
leadership until an apparent successor becomes
chief party spokesman.
Among the liberals, up - and - coming Senator
John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts will probably
come into the foreground as leading spokesman,
lie will undoubtedly get competition from Gov
ernor Averell Harriman of New York. Both Har
riman and Kennedy are probably eyeing 1960 as
the year of promise for themselves.
Republican inroads into traditionally solid Dem
ocratic Southern states will doubtless cause a
flurry of reorganization of state Democratic party
systems in those areas. This will be good to the
Democratic party as a whole since in the reorgan
ization process there is a possibility that Demo
cratic liberals in the South may gain greater in
fluence in the party system.
Greater emphasis will probably be placed upon
grass-roots work in the various states. Present
Democratic National Chairman Paul Butler has
been greatly instrumental in increasing grass
roots party work. He may be kept in his present
position, but this is doubtful and depends upon
which personality emerges as dominant figure in
the Democratic party.
It will be interesting to watch how personali
ties will emerge. Much of politics is determined
in the small conferences that will be held in the
near future throughout the country.
Another interesting thing to watch will be the
proposed high-level advisory group which is sup
posed to promote a liberal legislative program
along the lines of the 195*' party platform. A
dominant personality coul -ell emerge from this
group, if it is set up by th democratic party.
Senate Majority Leader Lyndon F. Johnson is
in opposition to this proposed group. If he pre
vails, it. will be an indication of his strength; if
not, then look for a strong liberal to take the
dominant role in national Democratic policy
making.

Democrats face an extensive rebuilding job on
the national level during the coming years.
First, they must pick a new chairman to suc
ceed Paul Butler and a new leader to replace
Adlai Stevenson. During the four years between
presidential elections it is common for Ihe con
gressional leaders of the "out" party to exercise
the leadership necessary to keep the show on the
road.
This is a major turning point for the Demo
crats. The direction they select will determine
the future success of the party in national elec
tions.
