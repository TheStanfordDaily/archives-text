In Defense of Taylor
Editor, The Daily:
A few comments on Mr. Seidel's letter of No
vember 28.
Anyone with a basic knowledge of football can
look at the past season and by weighing the physi
cal and psychological barriers realize why Stan
ford did not win more games. Certainly the games
were good ones and never lacked for excitement
and good football, which is what football is sup
posed to stand for. When you begin to demand
more—i.e., a winner—you have fallen into the
same misconception as the alumni of two of our
more prominent West Coast universities.
In regard to the specific points of the letter,
Coach Taylor's predictions are based on a very
sound premise—that you can't succeed unless you
have faith in your own ability. He is fully aware
of the weakness of his team but believes that a
positive attitude is bettor than one which causes
a toam to lose faith in its own ability. . . .
No serious-minded person would take Taylor's
statements at the football writers' meeting Mon
day as evidence of his true feelings, any more
than they would take his statements at the prior
Monday's meeting concerning an agreement with
Coach Waldorf not to defend against passes as
true. . . .
I, for one, vote for Chuck Taylor—his ability
and his integrity.
Joe Mell
E:l!tor, The Daily:
Mr. Seidel's criticism of Chuck Taylor is in
correct, unintelligent and unfair.
His criticism is incorrect in that it infers that
Taylor spoke against extra points after the games
were lost. Taylor disapproved of points after
touchdowns long before this season began. In
correct also is his statement that Taylor was tho
cause of some of the losses this season. There
nrc several other factors involved in a win or a
los • including competing teams and a little luck.
Seidel is unintelligent in that he believes every
thing he reads on the sports pages. He should
know more about football before he writes such
remarks.
Third, he is unfair because he questions the
ability and honesty of a man he does not know.
I suggest * 'r. ,V idel review what Taylor has done,
rot what newspapers say he should have
done. He shou i 'hen talk to Taylor and decide

for himself the man's moral integrity.
I'm sure Seidel felt worse after each game than
the football players. I'm very sorry lhat he isn't
going to the Rose Bowl.

Sir Robert- Answers
Editor, The Daily:
Two weeks ago the Consular Talks Committee
of the Institute of International Relations was
privileged to sponsor a visit to Ihe campus by
Sir Robert Hadow, British consul-general in San
Francisco.
During the course of his talk at Bowman Alum
ni House he incurred a bel wjlh a student from
the Gold Coast concerning the political status of
1 his crown colony. ... I submit excerpts from a
letter received from Sir Robert last week:
"Last July a general election in Ihe Gold Coast
was won by Ihe 'reasonable majority'; on which
H.M.G. agreed to consent to Iheir country's inde
pendence, subject to consent of Parliament. Con
sideration of this bill was scheduled for Nov. 12;
but I am frank in saying that I have no proof that
this took place, and in view of the events in Suez
I fancy that this legislation may have been re
tarded.
"The fact that the name 'Gold Coast' has offi
cially been changed to Ghana, and that independ
ence within the commonwealth has been asked
for by Ghana's Prime Minister Nkrumah and ac
ceded to by Her Majesty's government, is proof
that the charge of 'colonialism' which I was seek
ing to rebut is as dead in West Africa as in all
other parts of the British Commonwealth. . . .
"Whether I be adjudged the winner or the loser.
I enclose herein a cheque for the Hungarian re
lief fund, which it was agreed would benefit
1 hereby.
' "If, as I hope, the decision goes in my favour,
no doubt your student body member, who honest
ly sought to impugn my argument that Nassar's
anti-colonialism was a barren accusation, will add
his mite to mine in such a worthy cause."
On behalf of the lIR, I have expressed our ap
preciation and thanks to Sir Robert for his gen
erous contribution and for his speaking at Stan
ford on such a controversial and pertinent issue.

same misconception as the alumni of two of our
more prominent West Coast universities.
In regard to the specific points of the letter,
Coach Taylor's predictions are based on a very
sound premise—that you can't succeed unless you
have faith in your own ability. He is fully aware
of the weakness of his team but believes that a
positive attitude is bettor than one which causes
a toam to lose faith in its own ability. . . .
No serious-minded person would take Taylor's
statements at the football writers' meeting Mon
day as evidence of his true feelings, any more
than they would take his statements at the prior
Monday's meeting concerning an agreement with
Coach Waldorf not to defend against passes as
true. . . .
I, for one, vote for Chuck Taylor—his ability

E:l!tor, The Daily:
Mr. Seidel's criticism of Chuck Taylor is in
correct, unintelligent and unfair.
His criticism is incorrect in that it infers that
Taylor spoke against extra points after the games
were lost. Taylor disapproved of points after
touchdowns long before this season began. In
correct also is his statement that Taylor was tho
cause of some of the losses this season. There
nrc several other factors involved in a win or a
los • including competing teams and a little luck.
Seidel is unintelligent in that he believes every
thing he reads on the sports pages. He should
know more about football before he writes such
remarks.
Third, he is unfair because he questions the
ability and honesty of a man he does not know.
I suggest * 'r. ,V idel review what Taylor has done,
rot what newspapers say he should have
done. He shou i 'hen talk to Taylor and decide

for himself the man's moral integrity.
I'm sure Seidel felt worse after each game than
the football players. I'm very sorry lhat he isn't
going to the Rose Bowl.

No serious-minded person would take Taylor's
statements at the football writers' meeting Mon
day as evidence of his true feelings, any more
than they would take his statements at the prior
Monday's meeting concerning an agreement with
Coach Waldorf not to defend against passes as
true. . . .
I, for one, vote for Chuck Taylor—his ability
and his integrity.

E:l!tor, The Daily:
Mr. Seidel's criticism of Chuck Taylor is in
correct, unintelligent and unfair.
His criticism is incorrect in that it infers that
Taylor spoke against extra points after the games
were lost. Taylor disapproved of points after
touchdowns long before this season began. In
correct also is his statement that Taylor was tho
cause of some of the losses this season. There
nrc several other factors involved in a win or a
los • including competing teams and a little luck.
Seidel is unintelligent in that he believes every
thing he reads on the sports pages. He should
know more about football before he writes such
remarks.
Third, he is unfair because he questions the
ability and honesty of a man he does not know.
I suggest * 'r. ,V idel review what Taylor has done,
rot what newspapers say he should have
done. He shou i 'hen talk to Taylor and decide

for himself the man's moral integrity.
I'm sure Seidel felt worse after each game than
the football players. I'm very sorry lhat he isn't
going to the Rose Bowl.

Sir Robert- Answers
Editor, The Daily:
Two weeks ago the Consular Talks Committee
of the Institute of International Relations was
privileged to sponsor a visit to Ihe campus by
Sir Robert Hadow, British consul-general in San
Francisco.
During the course of his talk at Bowman Alum
ni House he incurred a bel wjlh a student from
the Gold Coast concerning the political status of
1 his crown colony. ... I submit excerpts from a
letter received from Sir Robert last week:
"Last July a general election in Ihe Gold Coast
was won by Ihe 'reasonable majority'; on which
H.M.G. agreed to consent to Iheir country's inde
pendence, subject to consent of Parliament. Con
sideration of this bill was scheduled for Nov. 12;
but I am frank in saying that I have no proof that
this took place, and in view of the events in Suez
I fancy that this legislation may have been re
tarded.
"The fact that the name 'Gold Coast' has offi
cially been changed to Ghana, and that independ
ence within the commonwealth has been asked
for by Ghana's Prime Minister Nkrumah and ac
ceded to by Her Majesty's government, is proof
that the charge of 'colonialism' which I was seek
ing to rebut is as dead in West Africa as in all
other parts of the British Commonwealth. . . .
"Whether I be adjudged the winner or the loser.
I enclose herein a cheque for the Hungarian re
lief fund, which it was agreed would benefit
1 hereby.
' "If, as I hope, the decision goes in my favour,
no doubt your student body member, who honest
ly sought to impugn my argument that Nassar's
anti-colonialism was a barren accusation, will add
his mite to mine in such a worthy cause."
On behalf of the lIR, I have expressed our ap
preciation and thanks to Sir Robert for his gen
erous contribution and for his speaking at Stan
ford on such a controversial and pertinent issue.
