Bowman Ai.umnl ! lousn means the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation. That's where we hang our hats. And we hope you'll
hang yours there, too —often. I he alumni maintain it, hut
they can't use it much. They're too busy out there in the
outside world being alumni. Although it's supported out of
alumni dues, Bowman Alumni 1 louse is a cvunpus facility, and
its main use is by students.
For instance, more than 300 meetings (see picture) arc
held here each year, rent free—and the majority of these are
meetings of stmh'iit groups. But we can handle more, and
we're anxious to do it. Come in and see us.
We maintain one mimeograph machine solely for the use
of students. Come in and use it.
We have data on all tl\pse who have ever attended Stan
ford—living or dead, degree holder or not. If you want to
trace an old grad, ask us and we'll look him up for you.
If you need some other service you think might be up our
alley, come in and talk it over. If we can help—we will.
We call it Bowman Alumni I louse because alumni built it
and maintain it. But we might just as well call it Bowman
Student I louse. You use it most —and we like it that way.

'Tomorrow is ihe final day
I.iff MnMRHRSiup is more than just an easy way of nailing down
Big Game tickets (although it does just that). Anil it's more than
a lifetime subscription to the award-winning Stanford Jieniew,
which each month serves a slice of Stanford to "alums" all over
the world (although it's that, too).
Stanford Alumni Association is just another way of spelling
service. To alumni —through the annual Conference Series cover
ing a dozen cities, the Summer Camp, the Alumni Directory, Re
unions, and myriad other projects. To the University—in every
way we know how. But above all:
To the students —because without a never-ending stream of
them there would be no University—and no alumni.
Your membership will enable us to continue our service to
students down through the years—long after you've shaken Dr.
Sterling by the hand and tucked your diploma under your arm.
There's something to this concept of service, you know. Many of
Stanford's finest "products" contribute valuable time and money
to make this Stanford Alumni Association a going concern.
Membership gives you the feeling of sharing this important
work, and you get your money's worth to boot—a rare combina
tion.
In other words —all this and Big Game tickets too!
And you gel seven years to pay!
You CAN mi ashm: how much we value student partici
pation in the Stanford Alumni Association by two things.
We make you eligible for membership as soon as you
register for the first time. And we you special
reduced rates —SI 5 under scale; right now, $75 cash.
Or $10 down and the rest spread out over sepen years.
You can't hardly beat that for a deal these days.
Bui rates are cfointf ii/i December i —Saturday. TO
MORROW! After that, student life memberships will
cost $100; regular life memberships will set the buyer
back $115. The student who joins now will end up $40
ahead of the slowpoke who waits until after graduation
("when I'll have more money").
Remember this: I.ite membership rates, like Stanford
tuition, never go down. Only up. There were increases
in 1030, 1047, 1052 —and now again. Your Econ pro
fessors tell you that the entire history of money is in
flationary. A del to this your own increasing life expect
ancy and expanding Alumni Association services and you
can plainly see that you can never join for any less than
you can today. 9M<>! rncu jjevf tneck!

To the students —because without a never-ending stream of
them there would be no University—and no alumni.
Your membership will enable us to continue our service to
students down through the years—long after you've shaken Dr.

There's something to this concept of service, you know. Many of

Remember this: I.ite membership rates, like Stanford
tuition, never go down. Only up. There were increases
