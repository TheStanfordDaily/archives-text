# New Steam Plant to Provide Campus With Million Dollar Heating System
## Unit to Be Located Near Medical Center; Completion in 1958 
### 
Stanford University will build
a new, modern steam plant at a
cost "in excess of $1 million to
meet the needs of the proposed
Stanford Medical Center and to
improve the campus heating sys
tem.
"We hope to have the new plant
in operation by 1958 when the
first units of the Medical School
are scheduled for completion,"
said Assistant Business Manager
Seraphim Post.
Faced with the problem of ex
panding hot water and heating fa
cilities to take care of the new
buildings, the University had
three alternatives. It could build
a special plant for tiie Medical
School, enlarge the present facili
ties or build a new super unit to
service the entire University.
Better Heating
The extra cost of $25,000 a year
for maintaining two steam plants
ruled out the first idea. Then, in
the interests of better heating, the
University decided to build a new
super unit in the Medical Center,
to be located near the Anatomy
Building.
The Business Office has ordered
two new boilers, but there is a 12-
month delay in delivery of these,
so construction of the new plant
will wait until they are ready.
Once they are in operation, the
University will close down the
present heating plant and move
its two youngest boilers to the
new facility.
At present the campus heating
system is located in a plant on
Galvez Street between the Encina
gymnasium and Frost Amphithe
ater. It was built shortly before
World War I and additions have
been made periodically since then.
Hot Water Supply
Natural gas is used to heat up
the four massive boilers, with a
large oil reserve on hand in case
of emergencies. Four firemen,
two stcamfitters and a foreman
operate the plant, under the su
pervision of Carroll L. Blacker,
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds.
Though the hours vary with the
season, in the colder months the
heat is turned on at 4:30 a.m. to
take the early morning chill off
the buildings. By 7 a.m. hot water
is ready for all the University
buildings.
The heat is turned down at mid
day and raised again in the late
afternoon, finally being turned
off at 10:30 p.m. The supply of
hot water is then used up, com
monly running out before 11:30
p.m.
Boiler Budget
This schedule of hours was set
up when the plant was first built
and "is a pattern suited to our
needs and our pocketbook," said
Post. The Business Office budg
ets just over $196,000 a year for
heating, but if the boilers were to
run full steam all night to sup
ply heat and hot water it would
cost $77 an hour for gas plus the
cost of maintaining a staff for the
extra hours.
Last summer a chain of larger
steam lines was laid to connect
the present plant with outlying
University buildings. These new
lines will also fit into the new
plant, which should be ready to
take over the entire load of cam
pus heating by early 1959.
Post said ho would be happy to
hear students' opinions on the
heating system and that they may
bring suggestions to him at his
office in Encina.

early in l!)f>f>. The new plant will cost more than $1 million. It is
said to be needetl to meet the needs of the proposed Stanford
Medical Center. —Daily Photo by Larry Lynch
