# Indians Open Basketball Season Tonight
## San Jose Hosts Cards; St. Mary's Next Foe In First Home Match 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford opens its 1956-57 bas
ketball season tonight against the
San Jose Spartans at 8:15 in San
Jose. Tomorrow night the Cards
host St. Mary's in the home open
er at the Pavilion.
Both the Spartans and the
Gaels will be out to avenge nar
row losses suffered at the hands
of coach Howie Dalimar's five
last season. San Jose dropped a
72-70 decision to the George Sel
leck-paced Indians last year while
St. Mary's was nosed out, 51-50,
on Barry Brown's last • minute
shot. Both Selleck and Brown are
missing this year.
But the Spartans and Gaels
have much the same problems as
Stanford. San Jose coach Walt
McPherson greets back only one
senior from last season's club,
and he's a doubtful starter. Three
juniors who won starting as
signments last season as sopho
mores pace the Spartan attack:
cent e r Marv Branstrom, 6-7;
guard Eddie Diaz, 511, and for
ward Gil Egeland, 6-3. They are
the only lettermen. Expected to
round out the starting five are
forward George Wagner and
sophomore guard Don Rye.
Spartan llohlovers
Other Spartan holdovers are
Jack Rowley, Ihe lone senior; Bill
Sherwood, Arl Pasquinelli and
Danny Wilson. Returning from
the service are Buster Burgos,
who averaged 15 points a game
for the 1953 Golden Raiders, and
6-5 sophomore Denny Harris. The
San .lose roster has been bol
stered by a number of junior col
lege transfers and promising
sophomores.
St. Mary's coach Jim Weaver
will send four sophomores on the
floor to open against Ihe Cards
Saturday. The Gaels' lone start
ing veteran is forward Odell
.Johnson, 6-2, one of the top Gaels
last season. Sophomores who
have apparently cracked the
starting five are guards Andy
Sloan and Bob Dold, forward
Dick Sigady, (> 1 1 •*, and center
Mike Caroseilli, 6-6 V£. Backing
them up is Leroy Doss.
The Gaels have made it known
they are "after Stanford" to get
revenge for last season's narrow
setback. But Mike Wadsworth
and Bill "Weelo" Sanches, who
starred in that game for St.
Mary's along with Johnson, will
not be around to help. The Gaels
have a definite height advantage
on Ihe Cards, which doesn't take
much, and lack nothing in the
way of hustle.
Veteran forward Bill Bond,
third high Indian scorer last year,
is expected to be the big man in
the Stanford attack 1 his year. The
6-2 senior pumped in 328 points
last season, mostly on his deadly
jump shot, and is figured to be
even tougher this lime around.
Captain Harold "Hap" Wagner
has taken over George Selleck's
spot as the sparkplug of the
Tribe offense. Replacing Brown
at center is non-letterman veteran
(Mint Waring, 63, while sopho
mores Dick Haga and Paul Neu
mann round out the starting five.

Third High Scorer Last Year
Stanford opens its 1956-57 bas
ketball season tonight against the
San Jose Spartans at 8:15 in San
Jose. Tomorrow night the Cards
host St. Mary's in the home open
er at the Pavilion.
Both the Spartans and the
Gaels will be out to avenge nar
row losses suffered at the hands
of coach Howie Dalimar's five
last season. San Jose dropped a
72-70 decision to the George Sel
leck-paced Indians last year while
St. Mary's was nosed out, 51-50,
on Barry Brown's last • minute
shot. Both Selleck and Brown are
missing this year.
But the Spartans and Gaels
have much the same problems as
Stanford. San Jose coach Walt
McPherson greets back only one
senior from last season's club,
and he's a doubtful starter. Three
juniors who won starting as
signments last season as sopho
mores pace the Spartan attack:
cent e r Marv Branstrom, 6-7;
guard Eddie Diaz, 511, and for
ward Gil Egeland, 6-3. They are
the only lettermen. Expected to
round out the starting five are
forward George Wagner and
sophomore guard Don Rye.
Spartan llohlovers
Other Spartan holdovers are
Jack Rowley, Ihe lone senior; Bill
Sherwood, Arl Pasquinelli and
Danny Wilson. Returning from
the service are Buster Burgos,
who averaged 15 points a game
for the 1953 Golden Raiders, and
6-5 sophomore Denny Harris. The
San .lose roster has been bol
stered by a number of junior col
lege transfers and promising
sophomores.
St. Mary's coach Jim Weaver
will send four sophomores on the
floor to open against Ihe Cards
Saturday. The Gaels' lone start
ing veteran is forward Odell
.Johnson, 6-2, one of the top Gaels
last season. Sophomores who
have apparently cracked the
starting five are guards Andy
Sloan and Bob Dold, forward
Dick Sigady, (> 1 1 •*, and center
Mike Caroseilli, 6-6 V£. Backing
them up is Leroy Doss.
