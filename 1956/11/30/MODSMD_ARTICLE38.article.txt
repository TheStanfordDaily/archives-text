# Freshman Basketball Quintet Meets San Jose, Fullerton JC
## 
### Dean Stewart 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team, which was described as
"probably the best over-all team
we've had since before ihe war"
by Coach Dick Clegg, gets its
first test run tonight againsl, the
San Jose frosh.
A preliminary to the varsity
contest, the freshman game is
scheduled to start at 6 p.m. at San
Jose.
"This group has the best poten
tial of any I've seen since I've
been at Stanford," said Clegg.
"For once we've got some height
to work with. And they're not just
big men; they're active as well.
"We know very little about San
Jose's frosh. We'll definitely use
the fast break this year, and I
think we have the men to make it
i effective. Our rebounding should
be real good."
Tomorrow night the Stanford
freshmen play Fullerton Junior
College. The game will be played
in Stanford Pavilion starting at
6 p.m.
"Fullerton had a very good team
last year," admitted Clegg, "and
they're expected to be strong
again this season. They should
give us a rough go of it.
"Neil Brockmeyer was slated to
start at center for us this week
end, but he injured his ankle and
I won't be able to play. Although
Marion Keyes should fill in capa
bly, it weakens our bench.

"Jerry Thuesen and Mike Tip
ton will open at forwards, fend
Dean Prince and Mason Byles will
handle the guard posts. Closely
pressing the starting five will be
forwards John"Hendry, Jim Weer
sing and Chris Burford and guard
Di c k Thompson. Burford was
playing football and has only been
practicing with us for a few days,
but he looks good already.
"Brockmeyer is (5-8, Thuesen 6-7,
Keyes 6-SM-, Weersing 6-4'/a and
center Steve Pentoney 6-6, so we
have plenty of height. In fact,
only four of the 18 men on Ihe
team roster are under 6-2.
