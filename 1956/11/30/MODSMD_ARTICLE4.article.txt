## Consul-General Says France Acts as Mediator in Algeria 
### 
French Consul-General Robert Luc yesterday said that his country
is acting as a mediator in Algeria between the native and French
factions.
Luc in an Institute of International Relations Consular Talk
at Bowman Alumni House.
France intends, he said, to give Algeria self-government as soon

ias order is restored. The elec
tions hoped for this fall, though,
had to be postponed due to terror
ist uprisings.
Luc explained the purpose of
the uprisings was to avoid the
i elections. The terrorist minority
i wishes to break away completely
from the mother country, while
the "majority" want only limited
independence, he said.
Al the root of this conflict. Luc
speculated, is the eight-to-one ra
j tio of native Algerians to French
men born in Algeria. However,
speaker declared that remov
ing the while minority would do
I more harm than good.
The white minority he credited
with having built up the coun
try's prosperity.
In con!rast to the difficulties in
Algeria, Tunisia offers few prob
lems. Luc explained that no large
white minority inhabits this Afri
can land. Besides, he said, Tuni
sia has gained independence from
France.
