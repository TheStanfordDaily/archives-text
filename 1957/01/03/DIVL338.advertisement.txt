THE HOUSE THAT Jf
JET ENGINES BUILT C
Engineer?? and scientists at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft ,
developed the piston engines that wrote aviation history /
for three decades. Then came the jet age, and again it /
was the P & W A team that came up with the mighty # /
J-57, most powerful production aircraft engine in the " J
world today. Behind such accomplishments, of course, \
stand many development tools...tools like the house that V
jet engines built: the Andrew Willgoos Laboratory.
Located on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River
in East Hartford, this windowless, thick concrete-walled [
laboratory has been growing almost continuously since V.
its initial "completion" in 1950. As more powerful, far
more advanced turbojet engines are conceived, the means
for testing them in development stages must itself under- /
go carefully calculated alteration. Hence, authorship of /
today's specifications for Willgoos Laboratory properly 112
belongs to the experimental engines it is testing today. V
Similarly, tomorrow's proportions, capacities and equip- \
ment will depend upon the requirements of tomorrow's
power plants. N.
Behind the ponderous walls of this multi-million-dollar /r
structure lies the wherewithal to simulate many of the /
rigorous flight conditions to be encountered by military I
and commercial aircraft. The range of these conditions I
must vary from ambient pressures and temperatures in \
a static condition at sea level all the way to the pres
sures, temperatures and high speeds involved in high- *
altitude flight.
This, then, is the house that jet engines built; at the if 112 •' '
