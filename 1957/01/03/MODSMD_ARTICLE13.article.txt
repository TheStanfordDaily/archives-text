WASH IM.; i ON, Jan. 2 ( UP) President Eisenhower decided tenta
tively today to make a personal appeal to Congress for support of his
new Middle East proposal nt an extraordinary joint session Friday.
The decision came as several Democratic leaders predicted Con
gress will approve the President's request to use money and troops,

if necessary, to head off possible
Soviet penetration of the oil-rich
area.
Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Tex.)
said the President sent word he
would like to appear personally
before the lawmakers one day af
ter the new Congress convenes to
explain his "Eisenhower doc
trine."
Rayburn promptly agreed to
the Friday date and Senate Dem

son (Tex.) said he was willing
to schedule the joint session any
time the President wanted it.
