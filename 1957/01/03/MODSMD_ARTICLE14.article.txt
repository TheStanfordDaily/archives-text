# Rayburn Gives No Aid on New Mideast Policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2 (UP) —
Speaker Sam Rayburn today re
jected as premature an Adminis
tration request for advice in draft
ing a congressional resolution set
ting forth President Eisenhower's
new Middle East policy.
The development came as Eis
enhower asked congressional lead
ers to arrange an unusual .joint
session of the House and Senate
so he can make a personal plea
for- approval of the new policy.
The timing of the appearance ap
parently was still up in the air.
The Administration's hid for
Rayburn's help in drafting the
final resolution to be laid before
Congress was made by Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles at a
conference with the Speaker and
other House leaders and foreign
affairs experts.
Rayburn told newsmen after
the closed meeting that Dulles
asked him and other leaders for
"advice" in framing the'resolu
tion. He said he took the position
it was "not proper" for him to
give such advice.
Rayburn said the draft resolu
tion which Dulles carried to the
meeting should be completed and
presented to the House Foreign
Affairs Committee for its consid
eration.
Dulles and t Rayburn agreed,
however, that the 70-minute meet
ing with House leaders was a
"good meeting."
Rayburn had announced several
hours earlier that Eisenhower had
sent word to the Capitol that he
would like to make a personal ap
pearance before the lawmakers on
Friday, the day after Congress
convenes, to explain his new Mid
dle East plan.
The Speaker said he promptly
agreed. Senate Democratic Lead
er Lyndon R. Johnson of Texas
subsequently said he did not un
derstand that Friday definitely
had been fixed as the day, but
that he was willing to do what
ever Ihe President desired.
