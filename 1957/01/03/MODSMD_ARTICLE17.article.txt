# 1957—It Belongs to Us
## 
### 
To YOUTH, the older generation often says, the
future lies in your hands. You can profit hy
our mistakes and reconstruct the world into
the type of place we hoped, but failed to see.
To those who reminisce and speculate at
New \ ear's time, this type of thinking gives
rise to at least a grain of hope. Parents and ed
ucators see in this Younger Generation, whose
minds and bodies they are attempting to pre
pare for the trials of future life, a new hope
for mankind—truly the only hope for mankind.
And, in a sense, the year 1956 belonged to
the Younger Generation.
Although not participating directly in the
dangerous maneuvering of international poli
tics, this generation is becoming necessarily
more aware that they will bare the brunt of
the older generation's mistakes. Sometimes
realizing it and sometimes not, they are pre
paring to handle the responsibility that soon
>\ill be thrust upon them.
To tl le more than 8000 of the Younger Gen
eration at Stanford, the future is not a dim one.
Those about to graduate have profited by a
challenging education at one of the country's
most outstanding universities. Those who will
graduate in 'SB, 59 and thereafter will profit
even more by the constant attempts at curricu
lum evaluation and perfection that have in the
past, ami will continue in the future, to main
tain this University in high standing.
The tragic but inspiring attempt to grasp
liberty in Hungary bel" > r ed to the Younger
Generation —those who 10 years had been

fed a constant stream of Communist propa
ganda and yet knew by instinct the finest defi
nition of freedom.
The fight against racial bigotry in one sec
tion of our country lies in the hands of ibis
Younger Generation. The Supreme Court can
promulgate, the Congress can legislate, but it
is only through patient teaching of racial unity
in the schools that a new generation can grow
to maturity unscorehed by the blotch of racial
antagonism.
This Younger Generation can look forward
to a time when the thought of integrated
schools will raise no eyebrows, when education
is shared fully and equally by all in the finest
of American traditions of equality of oppor
tunity for all.
Yes, this Younger Generation will admit, the
challenges ahead are ominous and somewhat
terrifying. Yet, we are a fat and happy gen
eration. There is an ever-present danger that
our easy, prosperous and comfortable life will
make us into a sluggish and passive generation
so mentally and physically unprepared for the
challenges ahead that we will falter under the
lightest load. But this need not be.
If any New Year's resolutions need be made
and kept this year and during the years that
lie ahead, a resolution should be made to fulfill
the hope that the older generation has placed
in us.
That we should be the hope, and not the
dismal failure, of mankind.
