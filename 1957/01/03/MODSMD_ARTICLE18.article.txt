# Old business for the New Congress

### 
gram, the President will turn over to Congress
with new hopes of success his immigration bill,
which was tossed about futilely by the 84tli
Congress.
Another old bill seeking a kinder eye from
the new Congress is the school construction bill,
slightly modified from its ill-fated predecessor
which died under the onus of the Powell
Amendment during the last Congress.
Also sure to arise is a vigorous debate over
past and future handling of foreign policy, in
cluding discussion of the new "Eisenhower
Doctrine" of American protection of the ex
plosive Middle East by force if necessary.
This new Congress will provide a good testing
ground for the President's "New Republican
ism ' and his hold over the more conservative
element in his party; and it>vvi 11 also provide
a good battleground for the conservative-liberal
fight among Democratic legislators.
Hut, beyond this, both sides of the aisle in
Congress must act without party rancor to
initiate long-unborn but badly needed legis
lation affecting severely the country's pros
perity, strength and security both here and
abroad.

Hfforf. EMBARKING on a truly new legislative
career, the B.»tli Congress, wliieh convenes
today, will have to clear/he ledger of the old
84th Congress of some of its most important,
unpassed legislation.
\\ itil the election-year klieg lights no longer
focused on a vote-minded Congress, the country
can hope for a calmer, more rational perspec
tive to prevail 011 Capitol Hill.
Nevertheless, hitter fights will arise. A mod
erate civil rights hill sponsored hy the Eisen
hower Administration will encounter stubborn
resistance from Southern legislators, as will
proposals from the liberal Northern Democrats
to eliminate the Senate filibuster.
The Administration's eye is again upon a
balanced budget, and the debate over domestic
and foreign expenditures will continue to howl.
No tax cut proposals are included in the Presi
dent's new legislative program, and economy
minded Congressmen will be in a mood to shear
down many of the President's proposed ex
penditures.
