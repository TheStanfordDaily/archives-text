Defense of Compulsory ROTC
Editor's Note: The following letter, received
after The Daily suspended publication last
quarter, is in answer to an editorial praising
the Daily Californian for its crusade to end
compulsory military training on the campuses
of land grant colleges.
Editor, The Daily:
I refer to your editorial of Nov. 28 entitled
"A Question of Compulsion" and, in particular to
the paragraph:
"It is highly valid to ask whether students
should be forced to conform while they are in a
university to the slrict prescriptions of military
conduct which do little to encourage a question
ing and independent mind."
I suggest that it is also highly valid to ask
what does "being forced to conform" to a proper
code of conduct have to do with encouraging or
discouraging a questioning and independent
mind. From early childhood to the death bed, we
all must conform to certain codes of conduct and
for ages past people have* lived under codes of
proper conduct which have enabled questioning
and independent minds to nourish. Oddly enough
each year the number of Rhodes scholars s(v
lected each year from West Point is greater than
for any other single school in the country.
1 would also like to call your attention to the
fact that the University of California is a "land

grant" school established or maintained In whole 1
or in part by the Land Grant Act of 1862 and ;
subsequent acts of Congress.
The purpose of the act was to provide for a
college in each state "where the leading objective |
shall be, without excluding other scientific and
classical studies and including military tactics,!
to teach such branches of learning as are related
to agriculture and the mechanic arts . .
Part of the intent behind the act was to pro
vide a means for training the youth of the coun
try in military tactics to augment our military
forces in time of war. Thus the verv condition
which, according to my interpretation of your
editorial comments, hampers the acquisition of a
questioning and independent mind is in fact re
sponsible for sponsoring in part the acquisition
of same.
I also question the statement "there is noth
ing tor them in ROTC" referring to those who
have taken only lower division ROTC (under the
compulsory law). There is a great deal to be
said lot the man who contributes to Ihe common
good without immediate personal reward, in
this case the common good being the preparation
to defend the United States.
If there is no material reward (and I suggest
there is), then there is at least the moral reward
ot knowing that one has contributed to the wel
fare of the nation or is in a better position to
contribute.
