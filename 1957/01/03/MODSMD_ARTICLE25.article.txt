## HAPPY TALK 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy with Cheek," etc 
As we all know, conversation is terribly important
on a date. When lulls in the conversation run longer than
an hour or two, one's partner is inclined to grow logy —
even sullen. What, then, does one do?
If one is wise, one follows the brilliant example of
Harlow Thurlow.
Harlow Thurlow prepares. That is his simple secret.
Before the date, he goes to the library and reads all 24
volumes of the encyclopedia and transcribes their con
tents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure that no matter
what his date's interests are, he will have ample material
to keep the conversation alive.
Take, for example, Harlow's first date with Priscilla
de Gasser, a fine, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl,
lavishly constructed and rosy as the dawn.
Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for
Priscilla, and, as always, he did not start to converse im
mediately. First he took her to dinner because, as every
one knows, it is useless to try to make conversation with
an unfed coed.
So he took her to a fine steak house where he stoked
her with gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French
fries and thickets of escarole and battalions of petits
fours. Then, at last, dinner was over and the waiter
brought two finger bowls.
"1 hope you enjoyed your dinner, my dear," said
Harlow, dipping into his finger bowl.
"Oh, it was grandy-dandy!" said Priscilla. "Now let's
go someplace for ribs."
"Later, perhaps," said Harlow. "Put right now, I
thought we might have a conversation."
"Oh, goody, goody, two-shoes!" cried Priscilla. "I
been looking everywhere for a boy who can carry on an
intell i gent conversation."
"Your search is ended, madam," said Harlow and
pulled back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a
likely topic to start the conversation.

( Jh, woe! Oh, lackaclay! Those cuffs on which Harlow
had painstakingly transcribed such diverse and fasci
nating information — those cuffs were nothing now but
a big, blue blur! For Harlow—poor Harlow! — splashing
around in the finger bowl had gotten his cuffs wet and
the ink had run and not one word was legible! And
Harlow broke out in a,night-sweat and fell dumb.
"I must say," said Priscilla after several silent hours,
"that you are a very dull fellow. I'm leaving."
Wjth that she flounced away and poor Harlow was
too crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a
cigarette.
All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. "Was
that," she asked, "a Philip Morris you just lit?"
"Yes," said Harlow.
"Then you arc vot a dull fellow!" she cried and sprang 1
into his lap. "You are bright! Anybody is bright to smoke
such a perfect doll of a cigarette as today's rich, tasty
Philip Morris, which is brimming-full of natural tobacco
goodness and fresh unfiltered flavor.... Harlow, tiger,
wash your cuffs and be my love!"
"Okay," said Harlow, and did, and was.
