# Tribe Meets Oregon State In PCC Schedule Opener
## 
### 
Coach Howie Dallmar's Stan
ford Indians open their Pacific
Coast Conference basketball
schedule at 8:30 Friday night
when they host the Oregon State
College Beavers in the first of a
two-game set at the Pavilion. The
second game of the series will be
played on Saturday.
Dallmar told his squad at yes
terday's practice session that
OSC is a "good" and "dangerous"
quintet. lie warned his Indians
of the Oregon front line height.
Three Favorites
Looking over the early part of
the PCC schedule, the Stanford
hoop mentor noted that his squad
would start its season against
three of the pre-season favorites,
the Beavers, California and
Washington. He was "pleased,"
however, with the progress
shown in every Stanford perform
ance over the holidays.
Last year the Beavers split a
two-game series with the Indians,
winning 69-59 and succumbing
75-50. Eventually, the Indians tied
with Cal for third place in the
PCC standings while OSC tied for
fifth place with Oregon.
In starting roles, captain Hap
Wagner and Paul Neumann are
expected guards, Clint Waring
will most likely go at center and
Bill Bond and either John Pflue
ger or Diek Haga should begin at
the forward posts.
Scoring Leaders
Neumann and Bond are the
current Indian scoring leaders,
while Wagner and substitute
Gary van Galder were rated most
valuable assets on the recent road
trip. Fans can expect 1o see foot
baller Carl Isaacs in action now
that his Shrine grid commilment
has passed.
Fresh from the victors' seat at
l he Far West Classic tourney
which they hosted at Corvallis,
the Beavers will bring to Stan
ford a squad which is described
as "stronger than last year," but:
"very young." OSC sported a
disappointing 5-11 record in 1955-
56.
Beaver coach Slats Gill is work

ing with a team composed mostly
of sophomores and juniors. Only
three seniors are posted on the
roster; two of these are not ex
pected to see much service this
season. Two men were lost to the
Beavers after graduation last
year; neither of these was a regu
lar.
Probable Starters
Probable starters for the Bea
vers include Bob Allord and Dave
Gambee, forwards; Wayne Moss,
cenler; and Jim Anderson and
Lee Harman, guards. Gambee is
the OSC nominee for an All-Coast
position. Fast for his size, 6-7,
Gambee is also a point-getter. In
16 conference games last year he
scored 278 points, averaging 17.4.
Allord, the only starting senior,
is "dangerous" and "underrated"
according to Coast coaches. The
6-4 hoopster scored 194 markers
last season. A pre-season choice
to start at center, Moss may lose
out to sophomore Gary Goble
who at 6-8 is an inch shorter than
Moss but felt by some to be the
better man.
Stanford students will be ad
mitted free If) both the freshman
game, at 6 p.m., and the varsity
game. Student body cards must
be shown.
