Stanford intramural director F. |
B. Bugge announces that sign up
lists for the winter quarter has- j
ketball program have been posted
in the gym.
It is hoped that all groups en
tering teams in the intramural
league will register their inten
tions by January 10. Information
pertinent to registering will be
found posted beside the lists.
Most important, according lo
Bugge, is that procedure which
must bo followed if a group plans
on more than one team. Two
teams from the same group must
be entered in different leagues.
No more than two teams may par
ticipate from one living group.
Table tennis and wrestling com
petition will begin at mid-quarter.
