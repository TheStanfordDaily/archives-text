# Stanford Scientists Receive Grants for Atmosphere Study
## NSF Awards Three to Make Radio Studies Of Skies for International Geophysical Year 
### 
Three special grants of more
than $325,000 from the National
Science Foundation have been
awarded to Stanford scientists
for radio investigations of the
upper atmosphere during the In
ternational Geophysical Year,
1957-58.
The work will involve a net
work of 24 radio-radar stations
extending from the Arctic Circle
in the north to Little America
near the South Pole. Well over
half a' million dollars will be ex
pended on the combined Stanford
research before the year-and-a
half IGY period ends.
Stanford liecipicnts
A grant of $202,000 went to
Professor Allan M. Peterson, and
another of $118,000 to Professor
Robert A. Helliwell. Both are
members of Stanford's Radio
Propagation Laboratory.
A grant of $.">OOO is being used
by Professor O. G. Villard Jr.,'
senior member of the laboratory,
for radar meteor investigations at
Little America.
Dr. Peterson's research is relat
ed to the lGY's aurora and air
glow studies. He will establish
an direct the work of 13 ionosphe
ric "scatter - sounding" stations
ranging from Greenland down
both coasts of North America.
Other stations will be located in
Central and South America and
in Australia.
Equipment Built Here
Their unique equipment, de
signed and built at Stanford, will
give a radar-like picture of invis
ible ionized cloud effects in the
upper atmosphere lor a thousand
miles or more around each sta-
I ion.
Dr. IlclliweH's work, part of
the IGY's ionospheric physics
'program, has to do with the cu
rious "whistler" sounds believed
caused by lightning flashes which
generate radio signals that travel
far out into space. There will be
10 stations, located in the north
ern and southern hemispheres,
participating in this research.
The combined investigations

are expected to yield considerable
new information about the
earth's magnetic field, the myste
rious Northern Lights, the
amount of matter in the earth's
outer atmosphere, and the beha
vior of the atmosphere during
"magnetic storms." Such data
should prove extremely useful in
radio and television communica
tions, for the launching of earth
satellites, and in other fields.
Dr. Villard pointed out that the
IGY program is an all-out effort
by scientists of 40 nations to
amass new facts about the earth.
Many problems in geophysics,
such as the origin of magnetic
storms, cannot be solved by ob
servations made in any one coun
try. World-wide, co-operative re
search is required, he said.
Largest single item in the U.S.
program is the earth satellite,
which will cost $20,000,000 or
more. A similar sum is budgeted
for meteorology, geomagnetism,
aurora and airglow, ionospheric
physics, solar activity, cosmic
rays, glaciology, oceanography
and other fields of study.
