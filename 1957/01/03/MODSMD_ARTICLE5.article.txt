# Ike Challenges Soviet Leader To Take Troops From Hungary
## Rejects Bulganin's 'Summit Meeting' Idea; Asks Soviets to Bow to UN Resolution 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (UP) President Eisenhower challenged
: Russian Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin tonight to bow to a United Na
tions resolulion and withdraw Red armies from Hungary.
Eisenhower said such action by the Kremlin would be a "signifi
cant step" toward the reduction of East-West tensions which, he said,

Russia professes to seek.
Eisenhower issued the chal
lenge in a new letter to Bulganin
rejecting the Soviet leader's Nov.
17 proposal for a five - power
"summit meeting" to end the
long disarmament deadlock.
He noted that Britain and
France had abided by UN deci
sions in the Sue/, crisis and said
Russia should do the same in
Hungary.
Bulganin's Nov. 17 letter pro
posed that the United States, Rus
sia, Britain, France and India call
a top-level disarmament meeting.
In his letter, made public by
the White House, the chief execu
tive said he was willing to enter
tain the idea of a meeting of
i chiefs of state if he thought it
| would produce "significant re-
I suits."
But "in my opinion," he said,
"deliberations within the frame
! work of the United Nations seem
more likely to produce a step for
ward in the highly • complicated
matter of disarmament. Accord
ingly, the United States will make
further proposals there."
Series of Letters
Administration officials said
the Eisenhower letter, latest in a
long series of exchanges with the
Soviet premier, was delivered to
the Soviet foreign office in Mos
cow earlier today by the Ameri
can embassy.
In his Nov. 17 letter to Fisen
hower, Bulganin turned down the
chief executive's "open skies"
proposal under which Russia and
this country would have ex
changed military blueprints and
conducted aerial reconnaissance
; over each other's territory.
He did, however, indicate a
! willingness to consider an aerial
I photographic zone 500 miles on
either side of the Iron Curtain.
The President told Bulganin lie
! found himself in "basic disagree
ment" with the Russian analysis
of international tensions.
He also rebuked what he called
Russia's attempt to dismiss as "a
slanderous campaign" the world's
indignant reaction to the brutal
Soviet repression of the Hunga
rian revolt.
"Slanderous < 'ampai^n"
He noted that although Russia
ignored "the constructive recom
mendations of the United Nations
with respect to Hungary, the par
ities at dispute in the Middle East
have accepted the assistance of
the United Nations.
[ "A similar response by the So
viet Union to the resolutions of
! the United Nations concerning
j Hungary would constitute a sig-
I nifieant step toward the reduc-
I tion of the tensions to which the
Soviet declaration addresses it
self."
Eisenhower went on to say that
Bulganin's Nov. 17 letter suggest
ed th.it the strategic advantage in
Europe now lies with Russia.

either side of the Iron Curtain.
The President told Bulganin lie
! found himself in "basic disagree

of international tensions.
He also rebuked what he called
Russia's attempt to dismiss as "a
slanderous campaign" the world's
indignant reaction to the brutal
Soviet repression of the Hunga
rian revolt.
"Slanderous < 'ampai^n"
He noted that although Russia
ignored "the constructive recom
mendations of the United Nations
with respect to Hungary, the par
ities at dispute in the Middle East
have accepted the assistance of
the United Nations.
[ "A similar response by the So
viet Union to the resolutions of

I nifieant step toward the reduc-

Soviet declaration addresses it
self."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (UP) President Eisenhower challenged
: Russian Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin tonight to bow to a United Na
tions resolulion and withdraw Red armies from Hungary.
Eisenhower said such action by the Kremlin would be a "signifi
cant step" toward the reduction of East-West tensions which, he said,

Russia professes to seek.
Eisenhower issued the chal
lenge in a new letter to Bulganin
rejecting the Soviet leader's Nov.
17 proposal for a five - power
"summit meeting" to end the
long disarmament deadlock.
He noted that Britain and
France had abided by UN deci
sions in the Sue/, crisis and said
Russia should do the same in
Hungary.
Bulganin's Nov. 17 letter pro
posed that the United States, Rus
sia, Britain, France and India call
a top-level disarmament meeting.
In his letter, made public by
the White House, the chief execu
tive said he was willing to enter
tain the idea of a meeting of
i chiefs of state if he thought it
| would produce "significant re-
I suits."
But "in my opinion," he said,
"deliberations within the frame
! work of the United Nations seem
more likely to produce a step for
ward in the highly • complicated
matter of disarmament. Accord
ingly, the United States will make
further proposals there."
Series of Letters

hower, Bulganin turned down the
chief executive's "open skies"

changed military blueprints and
conducted aerial reconnaissance
