Medical Center Fund Chairman
W. P. Fuller 111 announced that
working drawings for the first
unit of Stanford Medical School,
to comprise the major portion of
the center, are scheduled to be

The finished hospital plans will
require approval by the project's
joint steering committee, as well
as by the city council and Stan
ford's trustees, after which they
will be released for construction
bids. Hospital construction is ex
pected to begin late in April, be
finished by November 1958 and
the hospitals should commence

Med School Plans
The estimated' progress sched
ule was worked out by Edward D.
Stone, the architect, E. Todd
Wheeler, hospital consultant, and
Milton F. Johnson, Stanford co
ordinator of the medical center
project.
Fuller said the Rehabilitation
Center is Ihe first unit of the
Medical School scheduled for con
struction, which should begin
next June and be finished in De
cember 1958.
Working drawings for Ihe en
lire school should be ready next
July, lie said. It should be built
by April 1959, and in operation
May 1, 1959.
Fuller cautioned that the esti
mated progress schedule for the
medical center is based upon ar
chitectural and construction con
siderations only.
No Financial Delay
"Full realization of these plans
calls for enthusiastic and gener
ous support of the Stanford Medi
cal Center Fund from business
and industry, from medical alum
ni, and from the general public,
all of whom will benefit directly
from this great center," he*said.
It was pointed out that Stan
ford fund-raising efforts will not
delay construction of the urgent
ly needed Palo Alto pavilion of
the combined hospitals. Financ
ing of the Palo Alto pavilion was
assured in 1955 by voters' ap
proval of a $4,000,000 bond issue,
and Stanford trustees have appro
priated $2,000,000 toward the Uni
versity's share of the cost of core
facilities to serve both pavilions.
