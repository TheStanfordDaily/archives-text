BUDAPEST, .lan. 2 (UPI Hun
garian police and militia rammed
trucks into a crowd of 20(H) jeer
ing Hungarians here I o d Â» y to
crush a flash demonstration
against police storm-arm methods.
The demonstration broke out
when police shoved and jostled a
crowd of women in front of a
state-run department store that
opened its doors for the first time
today since the revolution.
A group of men intervened an
grily on the side of the women
shoppers. Police drew their trim
cheons and slugged into I he shout
ing crowd.
Powerful police reinforcements
were called out and threatened to
mow flown the surging throng
with their powerful trucks. The
demonstrators were dispersed in
less than a half hour by an esti
mated 200 police and militiamen.
No shots were fired, although
Co m m un is I police nervously
pointed Soviet-made Tommy guns
at the crowd.
I'he incident reflected the angry
mood of Budapest citizens result
ing from Premier .lanos Kadar's
"black new year" policy of mass
dismissals in power-short facto
l ies and the Idle state administra
tion.
It alsfi recalled the violent clash
es between Budapest women and
Red police at the end of Novem
ber. In those demonstrations So
viet troops opened fire on the
women. There were no Russians
in evidence today.
A blocks-long queue of women
shoppers had gathered outside the
big Magyar Divatscarnok. a state
department store that was de
stroyed during the uprising but
was reopening in new premises.
Strong patrols of police and mi
litia stood by with their Tommy
guns shouldered and watched the
gay. jostling line.
