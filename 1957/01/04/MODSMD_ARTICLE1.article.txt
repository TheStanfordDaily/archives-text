# Florida Bus Segregation Held Illegal
## Federal judge Says Case Already Decided In Montgomery Holing 
### 
MIAMI, Jan. 3 (UP) An Ohio
born federal judge ruled abruptly
today that Miami and Florida bus
segregation laws are illegal, and
the transit company served notice
that 100,(500 daily riders will
travel on a mixed basis.
The City of Miami has 10 days
in which to appeal the decision by
District Judge Emett Choate
which signaled the biggest bus
integration attempt yet in the
turbulent South.
Hut in upstate Tallahassee, the
Florida capital, Gov. Lerwy Col
lins and state legal experts said
tlie ruling had no "immediate or
direct" effect on that city. Talla
hassee buses have been braked to
a halt on the governor's orders
as a measure to preserve order.
But unrest continued last night
when a four-foot cross was burned
at the church of the Negro min
ister who led attempts to inte
grate the buses.
Seven Cities'
With Miami now involved, a
lotal of seven Southern cities has
been brought into the bus inte
gration struggle which began two
weeks ago at Montgomery, Ala.
Buses there were ordered cleared
of racial barriers by the Supreme
Court in what was considered the
precedent case.
Judge Choate, 65. dropped a
bombshell in federal court with
an oral decision which caught
everyone by surprise. The judge
ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court
already had decided the question
in holding that segregation on
buses in Montgomery is illegal.
"I have no hesitation in saying
that these segregation laws are
unconstitutional and hence are
unenforceable," the judge said.
The Miami City Commission
went into an emergency session
to determine if the city will ap
peal the ruling. The bus company
served notice that its buses, which
haul more than 100,000 passen
gers daily, would be integrated if
the city did not appeal.
Decision After Hearing
Judge Choate's decision came
at a hearing on a motion by city
attorneys to dismiss a petition
brought by four Negro women.
The Negroes complained t ha t
their rights under the 14th amend
ment to the Constitution were vio
lated when they were required to
move from the front to the rear
of a Miami Transit Co. bus last
October.
The judge ended the hearing 15
minutes after it started.
"There is no use taking up a
lot of time talking about some
thing already decided," he sairl.
"If this is merely a suit to deter
mine the validity of segregation
in buses. I think that has already
been decided [in the Montgomery
cases J."

Seven Cities'
With Miami now involved, a
lotal of seven Southern cities has
been brought into the bus inte
gration struggle which began two
weeks ago at Montgomery, Ala.
Buses there were ordered cleared
of racial barriers by the Supreme
Court in what was considered the
precedent case.
Judge Choate, 65. dropped a
bombshell in federal court with
an oral decision which caught
everyone by surprise. The judge
ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court
already had decided the question
in holding that segregation on
buses in Montgomery is illegal.
"I have no hesitation in saying
that these segregation laws are
unconstitutional and hence are
unenforceable," the judge said.
The Miami City Commission
went into an emergency session
to determine if the city will ap
peal the ruling. The bus company
served notice that its buses, which
haul more than 100,000 passen
gers daily, would be integrated if
the city did not appeal.
Decision After Hearing
Judge Choate's decision came
at a hearing on a motion by city
attorneys to dismiss a petition
brought by four Negro women.
The Negroes complained t ha t
their rights under the 14th amend
ment to the Constitution were vio
lated when they were required to
move from the front to the rear
of a Miami Transit Co. bus last
October.
The judge ended the hearing 15
minutes after it started.
"There is no use taking up a
lot of time talking about some
thing already decided," he sairl.
"If this is merely a suit to deter
mine the validity of segregation
in buses. I think that has already
been decided [in the Montgomery
cases J."
MIAMI, Jan. 3 (UP) An Ohio
born federal judge ruled abruptly
today that Miami and Florida bus
segregation laws are illegal, and
the transit company served notice
that 100,(500 daily riders will
travel on a mixed basis.
The City of Miami has 10 days
in which to appeal the decision by
District Judge Emett Choate
which signaled the biggest bus
integration attempt yet in the
turbulent South.

Florida capital, Gov. Lerwy Col
lins and state legal experts said
