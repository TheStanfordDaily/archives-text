LONDON, .lan. 3 (UP> 3ritnin and France ioincd Hie United
States today in rejecting Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin's call
for a "summit conference" on disarmament.
In separate notes to Bulganin, British Prime Minister Anthony
Eden and French Premier Guy Mollet supported President Eisen
hower's suggestion that disarmament discussions should be con
tinued through the United Nations.
Neither note, however, replied lo Bulganin's suggestion for
aerial inspection of areas r>oo miles on either side of the Iron Cur
tain. a move that would hamstring the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization forces.
Bulganin made his proposals in notes delivered Nov. 17. He
suggested the chiefs of government of the United States, Britain,
France, Russia and India confer on disarmament.
Eden said in his reply that "experience suggests that in pres
ent circumstances a discussion of disarmament in a top level con
ference such as you propooxed is not likely to lead to progress."
Mollet gave much the same reply. But the French premier went
on in diplomatic terms to call Bulganin a liar in his evaluation of
recent world events such as the invasion of Egypt.
"If certain of your proposals appear to merit an attetnive exam
nation," he wrote, "the analysis which accompanies !hem is not
acceptable. The events of the past months are presented therein
with such little objectivity that I believe it preferable to abstain
from all commentary on such deformations of the truth."
