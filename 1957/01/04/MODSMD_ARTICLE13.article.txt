WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (UP)
American officials said today Dial
Nikita S. Khruschev's new praise
for Joseph Stalin appears to be
an attempt to slow the"de Stalin
izatlon" campaign and check the
unrest it has created behind I lie
Iron Curtain.
They said they do not believe
the remarks, made by the Com
munist party chief at a New
Year's Eve party in Moscow, indi
cate Russia means to return to
the iron-fisted policies of the for
mer' dictator.
The recent campaign by party
leaders to downgrade Stalin pro
voked a wave of doubt and criti
cism against Ihe Soviet system
throughout Russia and its satel
lites.
The cr 11 iel s m came chiefly
from students and intellectuals in
Russia and the satellites who re
ceived somewhat greater freedom
under the de-Stalinization pro
gram.
