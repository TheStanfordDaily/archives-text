# Congress Votes Rare Sat. Session to Hear Ike's Mideast Policy
## Lausche's Vote Gives Demos Senate Control Upper House to Debate Anti-Filibuster Motion In 2nd Meeting Today 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3 (UP)—
The Democratic • controlled SFit'i
Congress opened today and
promptly voted to meet in extra
ordinary joint session Saturday
to hear President Eisenhower ex
plain his plan for blocking Red
aggression in the Middle East.
The House and Senate con
vened shortly after noon with the
President's Middle East policy
and a Senate civil rights row the
priority issues. The Senate sched
uled a showdown in the civil
rights battle for 3 p.m.. PST, to
morrow.
In a suspenseful opening ses
sion, freshman Senator Frank J.
Lausche of Ohio clinched Demo
cratic control of the narrowly-di
vided Senate by voting with his
party to organize the chamber.
Some Democrats feared up to the
last he would vote with the Re
publicans.
But the colorful opening day
events were overshadowed by thn
decision to hold an unusual 12:30
p.m. Saturday session to hear
Eisenhower explain his now Mid
dle East policy. Saturday ses
sions are rare enough at any
time—much less two days after
Congress convenes.
Approval Expected
The President will seek Con
gressional approval of a resolu
tion authorizing $400 million in
economic aid for the area and
the use of U.S. troops, if neces
sary, to block Russian aggression
there. Despite some Democratic
misgivings, Congress is expected
to approve the plan.
The Democrats, enjoying a 233
to 200 majority, took over control
of the House with ease and
named Representative Sam Ray
burn of Texas to his eighth term
as speaker.
But suspense hovered over the
Senate as members awaited
Lausche's vote. Had he voted
with the GOP, as he hinted last
summer that he might, the Re
publicans would have be->n able
to take over control. The Sc ite
lineup is 49 Democrats and 47 Re
publicans.
Lausche kept his silence until
his name was called, then sided
with his party.
Filibuster Fight Ahead
With that issue out of the way,
the Senate turned to the civil
rights - filibuster fight that has
been building up for weeks. Sen
ator Clinton P. Anderson (D-
N'.M.l, leader of the civil rights
forces, introduced a motion for
adoption of new Senate rules.
The Anderson forces hope to
force through a proposal to make
it easier to choke off Southern
filibusters against civil rights leg
islation.
Senate Democratic Leader Lyn
don B. Johnson (Tex.) countered
Anderson's maneuver with a pro
posal to vote at 3 p.m. PST, to
morrow on the motion to table.
The civil rights forces arc ex
pected to lose. If so, it will leave
the Senate with the present rule
requiring the votes of 64 Sena
tors to shut off debate.

aggression in the Middle East.
The House and Senate con
vened shortly after noon with the
President's Middle East policy
and a Senate civil rights row the
priority issues. The Senate sched
uled a showdown in the civil
rights battle for 3 p.m.. PST, to
morrow.
In a suspenseful opening ses
sion, freshman Senator Frank J.
Lausche of Ohio clinched Demo
cratic control of the narrowly-di
vided Senate by voting with his
party to organize the chamber.
Some Democrats feared up to the
last he would vote with the Re
publicans.
But the colorful opening day
events were overshadowed by thn
decision to hold an unusual 12:30
p.m. Saturday session to hear
Eisenhower explain his now Mid
dle East policy. Saturday ses
sions are rare enough at any
time—much less two days after
Congress convenes.
Approval Expected
The President will seek Con
gressional approval of a resolu
tion authorizing $400 million in
economic aid for the area and
the use of U.S. troops, if neces
sary, to block Russian aggression
there. Despite some Democratic
misgivings, Congress is expected
to approve the plan.
The Democrats, enjoying a 233
to 200 majority, took over control
of the House with ease and
named Representative Sam Ray
burn of Texas to his eighth term
as speaker.
But suspense hovered over the
Senate as members awaited
Lausche's vote. Had he voted
with the GOP, as he hinted last
summer that he might, the Re
publicans would have be->n able
to take over control. The Sc ite
lineup is 49 Democrats and 47 Re
publicans.
Lausche kept his silence until
his name was called, then sided
with his party.
Filibuster Fight Ahead
With that issue out of the way,
the Senate turned to the civil
rights - filibuster fight that has
been building up for weeks. Sen
ator Clinton P. Anderson (D-
N'.M.l, leader of the civil rights
forces, introduced a motion for
adoption of new Senate rules.
The Anderson forces hope to
force through a proposal to make
it easier to choke off Southern
filibusters against civil rights leg
islation.
Senate Democratic Leader Lyn
don B. Johnson (Tex.) countered
Anderson's maneuver with a pro
posal to vote at 3 p.m. PST, to
morrow on the motion to table.
The civil rights forces arc ex
pected to lose. If so, it will leave
the Senate with the present rule
requiring the votes of 64 Sena
tors to shut off debate.
