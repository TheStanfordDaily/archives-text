# Ideals in Science
## 
### 
Teaching and training of students in science,
mathematics and engineering comes in for
harsh criticism on two opposing scores.
Some say their education is too narrow, spe
cialized arid hardly conducive to building a
well-rounded individual.
Others counter-charge that we are not train
ing enough scientists and engineers at a time
when they are badly needed to keep our tech
nical output on a par \ ilk Miat of other coun
tries.
The ideal lies somewhere between the two
extremes. Education must he liberal in the
sense that the individual is given the chance
to become acquainted with more than one
aspect of life around him, but there must also
be proper incentive to draw young people into
fields where their talents are needed.
VTe see progress, at least, toward this ideal
in the generous grants that are given liberal
universities such as Stanford to promote the
study of science and engineering.
Many students are here at Stanford now
because of scholarship grants set up by foun-

dations and large corporations which find that
young people are one of their soundest invest
ments for the future.
Last month Stanford received $280,000 from
the National Science Foundation to conduct
an institute for high school teachers of science
and mathematics. The importance of adequate
scientific training in high schools cannot be
overemphasized, for it is there that students
first become aware of where their talents and
interests lie.
I lie plans for Stanford's new 30-aere Science
Quadrangle effectively dramatize the demand
for up-to-date scientific training and Stanford'/*
part in the attempt to fulfill this demand.
I here is no completion date for this new scien
tific community; it will grow as rapidly as
University finances, outside contributions and
other financial considerations allow.
The scientific endowments made by large
corporations and foundations are investments
not only in their own financial future but also
in the future, well-being and progress of the
nation at large.
