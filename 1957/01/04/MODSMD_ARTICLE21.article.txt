# Stalin May Be Back
## 
### 
Tf the New Year's toasts made by the men
of die Kremlin are indicative of a new Soviet
policy switch, tlio world mav be in store for a
*
now dose of Stalinism, possibly nioro dangerous
tli an tlio last because of the erratic tendencies
of the present Kremlin leaders.
Favorable comments about Stalin are again
issuing forth from men who only a few months
ago condemned liim for his one-man, repressive
rule. Instead of denouncing him for doing
more harm than good, as they once did, they
are now praising him for doing more good than
harm and* excusing his "mistakes'" as ordinary
human failures shared by all.
( ommunist Party Leader Khrushchev and
those who help in their own mysterious ways
to create Soviet policy have seen their old poli
cies of relaxing their hold on the satellites
crumble over resurgent demands for greater
freedom.
I hey have seen Tito and his rebellious ideas
become the opening wedge for revolt in many
of the satellites. In the future they may well
dccide that Stalinist tactics of repression, how

ever distasteful to the rest of the world, at least
kept the Soviet Empire intact.
I his period of flux will he a severe test for
the United Stales and other Western nations.
Leadership cannot be wanting, and bold words
must be followed by bold action.
I he recent turmoil in the Middle East and
the continuing threats of Soviet encroachment
have dramatically pointed out the results of
this country's confused, and sometimes non
existent, foreign policy. The new "Eisenhower
Doctrine" of protecting Middle Eastern nations
by financial aid (and force if neeessary) from
Soviet penetration is a dynamic move toward
developing a policy in the area.
The peoples of the Arab and Asian worlds
need financial help to bolster their young eeon
omies, and they do not care who gives it. It is
to their interests, and our own, that they should
not become dependent on the Soviet Union
for help.
This new doctrine, now only in words, could
become the foundation for a new, vigorous
foreign policy if the words are transformed
into action.
