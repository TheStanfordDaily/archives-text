## SIRO Helps Students in 13 Nations 
### 
Do you have any old clothes
you'd like to get rid of? Woidd
you like to toss any of your school
books in the ashcan? Are you in
favor of fighting Communism, or
aiding needy refugees?
If the answer to any of Ihese
questions is yes, Stanford Inter
national Relief Organization will
we 1 c onie your help. SIRO, a
branch of the Institute of Inter
national Relations, is conducting
a drive during dead and finals
weeks to collect books for ship
ment to 13 Asiatic countries and
old clothes for distribution to Eu
ropean refugees.
In drives last year students do
nated 1500 books and two truer
loads of clothes. But only about
50 per cent of the living groups
were represented in donations.
"We'd like 100 per cent this
year," said Kay Lewis, chairman
of the four-member SIRO com
mittee.
Students may leave their old
books and clothing at the lIR
Shack. Collections will also be
made in living groups. SIRO ships
books through Asia Foundation to
universities in Burma, Ceylon,
Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ja
pan, Korea, Pakistan, Philippines,
Sarawak, Singapore, Taiwan and
Thailand.
Miss Lewis said, "We feel there
is a greater need for books in
Asia because of Communism be-'
ing so near." The main purpose
of sending literature to Asia is to
furnish an idea of what American
education and ideals are like.
"I've gotten letters back saying
scientific books are greatly appre
ciated," Miss Lewis said.
Aside from books contributed
by students, this nine-year-old or
ganization sponsors CARE's
American Book Shelf. After re
ceiving an annual $30 allotment
from the ASSIJ, SIRO sends this
fund to CARE for purchase of the
book shelf. CARE a group
of representative American books
and picks out a university to
which to send them.
Clothing travels from SIRO
through World University Serv
ice, a student relief group.
Students interested in working
on SIRO may contact Miss Lewis
from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Tuesdays or
Thursdays in the lIR Shack.
Miss Lewis said the relief or
ganization 'TS"a year-around proj
