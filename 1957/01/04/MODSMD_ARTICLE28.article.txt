# Tribe to Host OSC in PCC Cage Opener; Beavers Favored in Two-Game Series
## OSC, One of Favorites In Conference Race Has Tall Hoop Squad 
### Jerry Kelly Sport Editor 
Height versus hustle. That's 1 lie
story tonight when the Stanford
Indians host a strong Oregon
State Beaver quintet in the Pa
cific Coast Conference opener.
The two squads square off again
tomorrow night, both Pavilion
tilts commencing at 8:30 p.m.
The towering Beavers, one of
the preseason favorites in the
PCC race, are led by All-Coast
forward Dave Gamhee, a 0-7 jun
ior 1 ; Bob A 1 lord, a 0-4 forward;
Wayne Moss, a 0-9 center, and
Gary Coble, a 0-8 center.
Alter experimenting with vari
ous player combinations and of
fensive formations, the visiting
Oregonians hosted the first an
nual Far West basketball classic
last week. The Beavers copped
all honors with impressive wins
over the University of San Fran
cisco and Washington. The Bea
vers currently ride in the co-favo
rite spot along with Washington,
California and UCLA.
Pre-Season Predictions
In contrast, Coach Howie Dall
mar's hustling squad was given
the "also-ran" role in pre-season
predictions by coast sports writ
ers. The talented mentor, how
ever, becomes more optimistic as
the season progresses. To date
Stanford has won four contests
while'dropping five, but the com
petition has been rough and the
Cards have definitely improved
with age and experience.
Before leaving on an extended
road trip which took them to
Miami, Florida, Dallmar's cagers
tripped a highly-touted Rice In
stitute live, 05-04, itr a thriller
which proved height is not every
thing. On the road Stanford edged
Centenary College of Louisiana
and Valparaiso while losing close
tests against Tuiane, Tennessee,
Connecticut and Western Ken
tucky, all rated top basketball
squads.
Coach Dallmar announced last
night thai center Clint Waring
will return to the starting lineup
for the Oregon State encounter,
thus adding height in the forward
wall. War ing, a 0-4 junior, was i
in jured on the road trip.
liond, lluga at Forwards
With Waring in Ihe starting
lineup will be forwards Bill Bond, |
two-year veteran, and sophomore
Dick llaga. Captain Hap Wagner
and sophomore Paul Neumann j
will start at the guard positions. I
Neumann has proved Ihe most |
pleasant surprise to Stanford fol-1
lowers. The 0-IV2 sharpshooter)
has been a consistent high scorer
along with the experienced Bond.
Another sophomore, John Pfiu
eger, has proved a valuable asset
in Dallmar's court attack. He will
be used often, as will guard Gary
Van Galder, a one-year veteran.
Footballer Carl Isaacs will be
back in basketball togs this week
end. but because of lack of prac
tice he will probably not be used
against the Beavers. Isaacs ap
peared in the Shrine East-West
game December 29 and has been
unable to practice.
Indians, Heavers Split
Last year was the first time
Oregon State and Stanford met in
PCC action. The Beavers topped
the Tribe, 09-59, the first night,
but Dallmar's hoopsters came
back to dump OSC the next night,
75-50.
Oregon State Coach Slats Gill
has developed a dangerous squad
around seven returning lettermen
and a host of promising sopho
mores. Biggest threat comes from
the forward slots, where Dave
Gamhee and Bob Allord loom as
high scorers. An improved Stan
ford defense which has proved
effective in recent tilts will prob
ably concentrate more on Oregon
State's one-two punch in Ihe for
ward wall.
Gamhee as a sophomore last

season scored 407 points in 20
games, third high in OSC history.
Gary Goble will probably start at
center, with Lee Harman and
Jerry Crimins at the guard slots.
"We've learned a lot on the road
trip," Coach Dallmar said, "and
I expect at least a split against
the Beavers. They are a good
team, but if we can improve our
shooting percentage we can beat
them."
Not All Roses
It won't be all roses for Stan
ford after the Oregon State series.
Dallmar's men must then face an
other tough foe in California come
Tuesday evening. The Bears host
the Indians in the first of a home
and-home series.
"California is very difficult to
play against,*' Dallmar said. "Any
one of tin 1 starters could have an
exceptionally good night."

Gamhee as a sophomore last

season scored 407 points in 20
games, third high in OSC history.
Gary Goble will probably start at
center, with Lee Harman and

"We've learned a lot on the road
trip," Coach Dallmar said, "and
I expect at least a split against

team, but if we can improve our
shooting percentage we can beat
them."
Not All Roses
It won't be all roses for Stan

Dallmar's men must then face an
other tough foe in California come

LEE lIAH\IAN
Oregon State Starting Guard
Height versus hustle. That's 1 lie
story tonight when the Stanford
Indians host a strong Oregon
State Beaver quintet in the Pa
cific Coast Conference opener.
The two squads square off again
tomorrow night, both Pavilion
tilts commencing at 8:30 p.m.
The towering Beavers, one of
the preseason favorites in the
PCC race, are led by All-Coast
forward Dave Gamhee, a 0-7 jun
ior 1 ; Bob A 1 lord, a 0-4 forward;
Wayne Moss, a 0-9 center, and
Gary Coble, a 0-8 center.
Alter experimenting with vari
ous player combinations and of
fensive formations, the visiting
Oregonians hosted the first an
nual Far West basketball classic
last week. The Beavers copped
all honors with impressive wins
over the University of San Fran
cisco and Washington. The Bea
vers currently ride in the co-favo
rite spot along with Washington,
California and UCLA.
Pre-Season Predictions
In contrast, Coach Howie Dall
mar's hustling squad was given
the "also-ran" role in pre-season
predictions by coast sports writ
ers. The talented mentor, how
ever, becomes more optimistic as
the season progresses. To date
Stanford has won four contests
while'dropping five, but the com
petition has been rough and the
Cards have definitely improved
with age and experience.
Before leaving on an extended
road trip which took them to
Miami, Florida, Dallmar's cagers
tripped a highly-touted Rice In
stitute live, 05-04, itr a thriller
which proved height is not every
thing. On the road Stanford edged
Centenary College of Louisiana
and Valparaiso while losing close
tests against Tuiane, Tennessee,
Connecticut and Western Ken
tucky, all rated top basketball
squads.
Coach Dallmar announced last
night thai center Clint Waring
will return to the starting lineup
for the Oregon State encounter,
thus adding height in the forward
wall. War ing, a 0-4 junior, was i
in jured on the road trip.
liond, lluga at Forwards
With Waring in Ihe starting
lineup will be forwards Bill Bond, |
two-year veteran, and sophomore
Dick llaga. Captain Hap Wagner
and sophomore Paul Neumann j
will start at the guard positions. I
Neumann has proved Ihe most |
pleasant surprise to Stanford fol-1
lowers. The 0-IV2 sharpshooter)
has been a consistent high scorer
along with the experienced Bond.
Another sophomore, John Pfiu
eger, has proved a valuable asset
in Dallmar's court attack. He will
be used often, as will guard Gary
Van Galder, a one-year veteran.
Footballer Carl Isaacs will be
back in basketball togs this week
end. but because of lack of prac
tice he will probably not be used
against the Beavers. Isaacs ap
peared in the Shrine East-West
game December 29 and has been
unable to practice.
Indians, Heavers Split
Last year was the first time
Oregon State and Stanford met in
PCC action. The Beavers topped
the Tribe, 09-59, the first night,
but Dallmar's hoopsters came
back to dump OSC the next night,
75-50.
Oregon State Coach Slats Gill
has developed a dangerous squad
around seven returning lettermen
and a host of promising sopho
mores. Biggest threat comes from
the forward slots, where Dave
Gamhee and Bob Allord loom as
high scorers. An improved Stan
ford defense which has proved
effective in recent tilts will prob
ably concentrate more on Oregon
State's one-two punch in Ihe for
ward wall.

peared in the Shrine East-West
game December 29 and has been
unable to practice.
Indians, Heavers Split
Last year was the first time
Oregon State and Stanford met in
PCC action. The Beavers topped
the Tribe, 09-59, the first night,
but Dallmar's hoopsters came
back to dump OSC the next night,
75-50.
Oregon State Coach Slats Gill
has developed a dangerous squad
around seven returning lettermen
and a host of promising sopho
mores. Biggest threat comes from
the forward slots, where Dave
Gamhee and Bob Allord loom as
high scorers. An improved Stan
ford defense which has proved
effective in recent tilts will prob
ably concentrate more on Oregon
State's one-two punch in Ihe for
ward wall.
Gamhee as a sophomore last

season scored 407 points in 20
games, third high in OSC history.
Gary Goble will probably start at
center, with Lee Harman and
Jerry Crimins at the guard slots.
"We've learned a lot on the road
trip," Coach Dallmar said, "and
I expect at least a split against
the Beavers. They are a good
team, but if we can improve our
shooting percentage we can beat
them."
Not All Roses
It won't be all roses for Stan
ford after the Oregon State series.
Dallmar's men must then face an
other tough foe in California come
Tuesday evening. The Bears host
the Indians in the first of a home
and-home series.
"California is very difficult to
play against,*' Dallmar said. "Any
one of tin 1 starters could have an
exceptionally good night."

Height versus hustle. That's 1 lie
story tonight when the Stanford
Indians host a strong Oregon
State Beaver quintet in the Pa
cific Coast Conference opener.
The two squads square off again
tomorrow night, both Pavilion
tilts commencing at 8:30 p.m.
The towering Beavers, one of
the preseason favorites in the
PCC race, are led by All-Coast
forward Dave Gamhee, a 0-7 jun
ior 1 ; Bob A 1 lord, a 0-4 forward;
Wayne Moss, a 0-9 center, and
Gary Coble, a 0-8 center.
Alter experimenting with vari
ous player combinations and of
fensive formations, the visiting
Oregonians hosted the first an
nual Far West basketball classic
last week. The Beavers copped
all honors with impressive wins
over the University of San Fran
cisco and Washington. The Bea
vers currently ride in the co-favo
rite spot along with Washington,
California and UCLA.
Pre-Season Predictions
In contrast, Coach Howie Dall
mar's hustling squad was given
the "also-ran" role in pre-season
predictions by coast sports writ
ers. The talented mentor, how
ever, becomes more optimistic as
the season progresses. To date
Stanford has won four contests
while'dropping five, but the com
petition has been rough and the
Cards have definitely improved
with age and experience.
Before leaving on an extended
road trip which took them to
Miami, Florida, Dallmar's cagers
tripped a highly-touted Rice In
stitute live, 05-04, itr a thriller
which proved height is not every
thing. On the road Stanford edged
Centenary College of Louisiana
and Valparaiso while losing close
tests against Tuiane, Tennessee,
Connecticut and Western Ken
tucky, all rated top basketball
squads.
Coach Dallmar announced last
night thai center Clint Waring
will return to the starting lineup
for the Oregon State encounter,
thus adding height in the forward
wall. War ing, a 0-4 junior, was i
in jured on the road trip.
liond, lluga at Forwards
With Waring in Ihe starting
lineup will be forwards Bill Bond, |
two-year veteran, and sophomore
Dick llaga. Captain Hap Wagner
and sophomore Paul Neumann j
will start at the guard positions. I
Neumann has proved Ihe most |
pleasant surprise to Stanford fol-1
lowers. The 0-IV2 sharpshooter)
has been a consistent high scorer
along with the experienced Bond.
Another sophomore, John Pfiu
eger, has proved a valuable asset
in Dallmar's court attack. He will
be used often, as will guard Gary
Van Galder, a one-year veteran.
Footballer Carl Isaacs will be
back in basketball togs this week
end. but because of lack of prac
tice he will probably not be used
against the Beavers. Isaacs ap
peared in the Shrine East-West
game December 29 and has been
unable to practice.
