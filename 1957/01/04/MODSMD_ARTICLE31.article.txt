j hold penalties against four mem
| her schools for permitting exces

The action was taken by presi
dents, faculty representatives and
'athletic directors of the nine
member schools at the opening
session of their two-day winter

for periods of two to three years.
4-5 Vote
In other major action the con
ference rejected, by a 4-5 vote, a
proposal to abolish the round
robin schedule, but instead ap
proved a plan to let a member
school out of a scheduled game if
it can provide "good and suffi
cient reason" to tlie conference.
USC, UCLA. California and
Washington voted to abolish the
round robin schedule. They had
been reported anxious to sched
ule more inter - sectional games
which draw more attendance.
Seahorg said that good and suf
ficient reason might mean a
school's "lack of confidence in the
general athletic program of an
other, such as the suspicion it
was lowering entrance require
ments for athletes or that it was
giving athletes an illegal sub
sidy."
However, Seahorg said that he
saw no indication itt today's meet
ing that any member school was
preparing to invoke the new code
change.
Anofher Code Change
Another change in the code
which had been proposed by the
Presidents' Council Dec. 2 stipu
lated that "all existing obligations
i as to athletic game schedules be
fulfilled unless it can be demon
strated they are flexible for ad
justments as might be agreed to
by the conference."
Another rule change approved
today by the conference requires
athletes to maintain a solid "C"
grade average for approximately
28 semester or 42 quarter units
between seasons of competition
and in 12 units while competing.
