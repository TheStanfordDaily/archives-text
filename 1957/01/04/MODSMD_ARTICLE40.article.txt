# New Sidewalk Recent Work Of Corp Yard
## 
### 
Perhaps you have noticed that
the sidewalk opposite the Book
store has been recently extended
to the curb to provide more walk
ing space for the, students. This
is a result of wo'rk done by the
Corporation Yard and Grounds
department of Stanford.
The "Corp" Yard, employing 133
men, includes carpenters, engi
neers, mechanics, men in charge
of the grounds, and office work
ers. The nerve center of this de
partment, consisting of the offices
and storage facilities for equip
ment, is in the area behind the
Fire Station. In the future the
Corp Yard will be moved to make
way for expansion of University
laboratories, according to Superin
tendent Carroll Blacker.
The Corporation Yard does not
include Stanford Village, which
has its own staff and power plant.
Also, the Board of Athletics has
its own Corp section, which main
tains the athletic plant and takes
care of the athletic grounds, in
cluding the stadium. The wom
en's athletic facilities are included
within the main Corp Yard de
partment.
The department uses many
types of equipment, including
trucks, road-rollers, graders and
air compressors. Two recent pur -
chases include a bulldozer tractor
and a "chipper," which is used for
clearing fallen trees and brush.
This new equipment is used main
ly to save time.
Typical jobs done by the Corp
Yard are installing lights, paint
ing buildings, repairing roads and
maintaining University grounds.
As one of the latest projects un
dertaken by the Corporation Yard,
ground was broken on Nov. 6 for
the new physics lecture hall.
