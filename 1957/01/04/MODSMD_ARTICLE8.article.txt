# Up Gues the Ratio Favoring Women As Reg Day Ends
## 
### 
Workmen removed the last of
the registration equipment from
the Pavilion late yesterday after
noon and began to clean up the
debris left by the G792 returning
students who tramped in and out
during the day.
In a breakdown of the total
number, 5147 are men and 1645
women, according to Registrar
| Harvey Hall.
Last winter 5048 men and 1840
women registered on the initial
registration day for a total of
6888 students.
Gasping male mathematicians
will note that the number of men
increased by 99 while the number
I of women decreased by 195.
However, the total of 96 fewer
students this year can be attrib
uted to the Thursday registration
d;ite, and many arc expected to
return over the week end to brave
j late filing fees.
