career in retailing?
There is an opportunity for college graduates in retailing that few
other industries offer. Where can you achieve the satisfaction of
seeing, every day, the tangible results of your own efforts? Where
can you have the chance of assuming early executive responsibility
before the age of 2.V? Where can women and men find equal ad
vancement- possibilities? Where can you find the substantial earn
ings and other benefits that are concomitant to this industry and
to its dynamic growth? Where? In retailing! Mary's has an Ex

these things possible.
