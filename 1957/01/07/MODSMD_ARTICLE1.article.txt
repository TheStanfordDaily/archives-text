# Professors Propose Way To Put Losing Candidate, Ex-Presidents in Senate
## Suggestion Made as Constitutional Amendment, Sent to U.S. Senators and Leading Newspapers 
### 
An amendment to the Constitution of the United States was pro
posed last month by four Stanford professors.
Sent to about one-third of the members of the United States Senate
and to leading newspapers throughout the country, the proposal
states that in addition to the present elected members of the Senate

the following members shall be
entitled to serve:
• Persons who have served as
President of the United States.
Each such person shall hold his
place in the Senate for life.
• The person who receives the
second highest number of votes
for President of tho United States
at the most recent election for
that office, pursuant to the 12th
amendment to the Constitution.
This person shall be entitled to
serve in the Senate for a term of
four years, beginning January 3
of the year following the appoint
ment of electors for the election
of the President.
One Exception
The additional members under
the proposal would bo entitled to
all the rights, privileges and re
muneration now exercised by the
senators, with one exception.
These new members would not
be eligible to cast a vote on the
appointment of committees of the
Senate.
This proposed amendment was
signed bv Professors Lawrence F.
Ebb of the Law School, Mollis B.
Chenery of the Economics Depart
ment, Robert A. Walker of the
Political Science Department and
H. Stuart Hughes, formerly with
the History Department.
Faculty Meeting
According to PJbb, a group of
interested faculty members met
together on Nov. 13 last year to
consider the general problem of
how to put to work effectively the
talents of the former Presidents
and the runner-up in the latest
presidential race.
This group first tried to find
some way of solving the problem
without having to resort to a con
stitutional amendment. After dis
cussing for some time various
possibilities, it was decided that
there could be no effective solu
tion without giving these men a
vote in the Senate, Ebb said.
The essence of the proposal
came from this meeting and oth
ers which followed, and a draft
of the proposal was completed in
early December. The copies were
sent out Dec. 22.
Favorable Comments
Ebb said he has received replies
from three senators, all of which
were "favorable." He said two of
these, one from a northern Re
publican and the other from a
southern Democrat, backed the
proposed amendment without
qualification.
"I will say that the fact that
one Northerner and one Southern
er, one Republican and one Demo
erat, have backed it I'd say this
is pretty good grounds for opti
mism," he went on to say.
Ebb said that several newspa
pers have lister! some speculated
"horribles" that might arise if
this amendment were adopted,
but he said that his group discuss
ed pretty thoroughly the possibil
ities lhat might arise, and it was
felt that the expected advantages
to the American political system
would far outweigh the possible
disadvantages.
Only four professors signed the
proposal, Ebb said, because it was
felt that one representative from
each of the four departments con
cerned would lend .just as much
weight as a long list of faculty
signatures, since the proposal was
something to be studied not a
potition to be acted upon immedi
ately.
