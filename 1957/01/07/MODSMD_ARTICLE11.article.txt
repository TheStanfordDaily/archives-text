LAXMIBAINAGAR, India, Jan. 6 (UP) — Premier Jawaharlal
Nehru said today he believes any U.S. attempt to provide military
aid to the Middle East under the Eisenhower Doctrine "will lead to
trouble."
Nehru told a convention of his Congress party that military inter-

vention in the Mideast by any na
tion would "cause conflicts." He
welcomed the idea of economic
aid to backward nations of the
area, no matter whether it comes
from the United States or Russia.
Although Nehru named no na
tion in his military comments,
aides said the speech was directed
at President Eisenhower's offer
of military aid to any Mideastern
victim of Red aggression.
Radio Moscow, attempting to
sow dissension among the West
ern allies, said today the doctrine
•represented a U.S. effort to
squeeze Britain and France out
of the Middle East.
Iran Supports I'lank
Two nations directly affected
I by the plan expressed differing
I views. Pro • Western Iran ex-
I pressed unreserved support for
j the plan, but Soviet - supplied
j Syria called it an "official U.S.
i declaration of cold war in the
Middle East.
Nehru told the Congress party
convention that the "so-called
: power vacuum" in the Mideast
! should be filled by the nations of
the area "through their own in
ternal strength and unity."
In Washington, Senator Mike
! Mansfield (D • Mont.» predicted
that the Democrats will come up
I with their own version of Presi
dent Eisenhower's program for
blocking Communist penetration
of t he Mideast.
Mansfield, a key member of the
I Senate' Foreign Relations Com
mittee, indicated the Democratic
plan will attack the "basic prob
lems" of Ihe area the A; ah Is
raeli dispute, the Suez Canal situ
ation and Communist arms sales
to Arab states.
Senator Sparkman Agrees
Senator John J. Sparkman (D-
Ala.i, another committee mem
ber, apparently agreed. He said
it is "absolutely essential" to
work out differences between
Arabs and Israel, settle the Arab-
Israeli refugee problem and keep
j a United Nations force in the Mid-
I die East.
Eisenhower pr o pose s to use
U.S. armed forces, if necessary, to
'"protect the territorial integrity
land political independence" of
any Middle East nation seeking
American help "against overt
| armed aggression from any ra
tion controlled by international
| Communism."
Me also asked Congress for
$400 million in economic aid for
the Middle East over the next two
j years "without regard to the pro
visions of any other law or regu
lation." He also would use an un
stated amount of previously • ap-
I piopriated funds.
