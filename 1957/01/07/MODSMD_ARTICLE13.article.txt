WASHINGTON, Jan. 0 (UP)
The Atomic Energy Commission
warned private industry today to
step up development of nuclear
power unless it wants the govern
ment to step in and do the job.
The warning was contained in
a third AEC invitation to private
and public power groups to sub
mit proposals for constructing
and operating n u e lea r power
plants.
"If industry does not submit
acceptable proposals," the an
nouncement said, "the commis
sion will request additional funds
to initiate such projects under
complete federal financing."
A spokesman said the invitation
means the full commission has
adopted a new eight - point pro
gram by Chairman Lewis Strauss
to speed the day of cheap and
safe nuclear power.
