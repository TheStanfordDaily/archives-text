### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. (> (UP)-
The atomic submarine Nautilus.
I with more than 500.W) history
making miles behind it. is about
I to ho refueled for the first time.
i it was learned today.
The Nautilus presumably could
sail even further on its original
load of enriched urpnium. But its
peak efficiency would gradually
diminish.
It whs almost exactly two years
ago that the Nautilus' launching
ushered in the era of the atomic
powered Navy.
