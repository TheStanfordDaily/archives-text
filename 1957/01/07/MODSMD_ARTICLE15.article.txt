## Demos to Make Own Program Of Legislation 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. (5 (UP) —
A group of Northern Congress
men hope to heal President Eisen
hower to the punch by laying
down their own "Democratic leg
islative program" before he out
lines his program to Congress.
Leaders of the House group are
secretly circulating among North
ern Democrats for endorsement a
statement setting forth the pro
posed legislative program. They
are racing against time in hope of
getting enough endorsements to
make issuance of the document
worth while.
Eisenhower will outline his leg
islative proposals in his State of
the Union message to the new
Democratic - steered Congress
next Thursday. He gave GOP
legislative leaders a special pre
view last week.
They said afterward it will pro
vide for a $70 billion budget, dom
inated by increasing military and
aid spending, federal aid for
school construction, a liberalized
immigration law, a four - point
civil rights program and some
farm law changes.
Republicans and Democrats in
both houses meet tomorrow to
make assignments to the commit
tees which will handle these vari
ous proposals. However, the
House Foreign Affairs and Agri
culture committees decided to get
to work immediately without
waiting for formal organization.
The proposed Democratic state
ment has not been cleared with
Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Tex.)
because sponsors don't Ihink he
would approve of the maneuver.
They are not asking Southern
Democrats to sign it. They know
they woulrl refuse.
The statement includes a call
for enactment of a strong civil
rights program which the South
erners oppose. It also would com
mit this country to try to end
colonialism by extending foreign
aid to friendly nations which give
up overseas holdings.
The maneuver was prompted,
at least in part, by the fear of
liberal Northern Democrats that
Eisenhower will recommend a
program less liberal , than they
favor but more liberal than Con
gress will enact.
