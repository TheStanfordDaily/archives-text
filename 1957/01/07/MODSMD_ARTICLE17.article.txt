buster and talk to death all civil
rights legislation they oppose.
The Senate on Friday voted
down the first attempt this ses
sion to change the rule, by a vote
of 55 to 38. Opponents of the anti
filibuster bloc argued that the
Senate is a continuing body whose
rules passed automatically from
one Senate to another.

bloc were heartened by their show
of strength. Rut it had been ex
pected that they would refrain

couraged to make a second at
tempt this session bv the ruling
of Vice President Richard Nixon
thHi each Senate has the consti
tutional right to draft its own
rules.
