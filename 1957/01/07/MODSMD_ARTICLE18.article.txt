# Egypt Requests U.S. to Release Frozen Funds
## Canal Passage Clear; Nasser Demands Israel Withdrawal From Gaza 
### 
CAIRO, Jan. 6 (UP)â€”Egypt
has asked the United States to
release $50 million in Egyptian
funds frozen in American banks
as a result of the nationalization
of the Suez Canal, the govern
ment said today.
An official spokesman did not
mention the United States by
name, but referred to a "certain
country." Informed sources said
he meant the United States, which
followed Anglo-French action in
blocking Egyptian currency after
President Gamal Abdel Nasser
nationalized the canal last July 26.
The waterway itself was slowly
getting back to normal.
Delayed Completion
Eight of 13 ships trapped in
the 102-mile canal since the Anglo-
French invasion of Port Said on
Nov. 5 resumed their long-delayed
journey to the Mediterranean to
day. The other five were to start
moving tomorrow toward the
Port Said northern terminus.
Cairo radio in a broadcast heard
in Beirut, Lebanon, said that, once
the waterway is cleared of ob
structions which have blocked it,
Nasser will put forward a new
set of conditions for canal pas
sage.
The radio quoted Nasser as say
ing Britain and France will not
be allowed to transit the canal
until Israeli troops evacuate the
30-mile Gaza strip seized from
Egypt during the Israeli invasion
last October.
Toll Demand
Nasser also is sticking by his
demand that all vessels using the
canal pay tolls to the Egyptian
Canal Authority, the radio said.
Britain and France have been pay
ing tolls to the old Anglo-French
company which Nasser national
ized.
In Jerusalem, Israel announced
that it is willing to let Arab ves
sels use the Gulf of Akaba, the
body of water lying between Is
rael and Egypt at their southern
junction. Israel said it was im
portant that the gulf be kept open
to all shipping. Israel now com
mands the approaches to the gulf
straits.
Egypt has refused to allow Is
raeli vessels to use the Suez
Canal.
