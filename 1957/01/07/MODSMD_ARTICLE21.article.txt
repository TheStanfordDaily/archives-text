# Decide for Yourself
## 
### 
To many Stanford freshmf.n the next two
weeks will be all-important. During this time
they will make a decision that will strongly
influence and affect their whole lour years at
Stanford.
It is to these students, a little tense and ex
cited about embarking on the annual procedure
known as "rushing," that we address this edi
torial.
Life as an independent or as a member of a
fraternity or an eating club—each of these has
its virtues and its drawbacks. Don't let anyone
try to tell you which is best for you; only you
can and should decide.
Many of you will choose the close-knit, com
munity spirit of fraternity life. Some will go
through rushing with an open mind and mature
perspective, wisely evaluating the good and bad
points of fraternity living. Others, unfortu
nately, will be impressed only by the appear
ance of the Greek letters on the door and will
do little investigation inside.
Those who choose to join one of Stanford's
seven eating clubs will find something of a cross

between the independent life of a non-frater
nity man and the fraternal life on the How.
Here, again, we advise rushees to look beyond
the eager hand-shakers to discover whether this
type of life suits their tastes and personality.
Many are doubtful about rushing at all. To
these we say: take the opportunity of seeing
the fraternities and eating clubs. Then, if you
decide to remain independent, you will know
why you have made this decision.
Freshmen have been at Stanford one quarter
now and have had the opportunity to observe,
indirectly at least, both fraternities and eating
clubs. For the next few days they can observe
them directly.
By the time pledging comes, the mature,
independent - minded individual should have
discovered for himself the right decision.
For each person it will be a different deci
sion, based on different reasons, but it will be
a wise decision if the person has been honest
with himself iu making a careful evaluation of
both the type of life he is moving into and
whether he is the type of person who would
enjoy and benefit by it.

nity man and the fraternal life on the How.
Here, again, we advise rushees to look beyond
the eager hand-shakers to discover whether this
type of life suits their tastes and personality.
Many are doubtful about rushing at all. To
these we say: take the opportunity of seeing
the fraternities and eating clubs. Then, if you
decide to remain independent, you will know
why you have made this decision.
Freshmen have been at Stanford one quarter
now and have had the opportunity to observe,
indirectly at least, both fraternities and eating
clubs. For the next few days they can observe
them directly.
By the time pledging comes, the mature,
independent - minded individual should have
discovered for himself the right decision.
For each person it will be a different deci
sion, based on different reasons, but it will be
a wise decision if the person has been honest
with himself iu making a careful evaluation of
both the type of life he is moving into and
whether he is the type of person who would
enjoy and benefit by it.
