# A 						Job for Elder Statesmen
## 
### 
Because of the vicissitudes of American olec
toral history, brilliant and valuable men are
often stripped from public life. It is particu
larly unfortunate that persons who have served
as President or have'reached the stature of a
presidential candidate of one of the major
political parties should be left without a voiee
or influence in the management of our govern
ment, except, of course, in the ex-officio capacity
of elder statesman.
An ex-President has a wealth of experience
and wisdom won from the years in which he
guided the nation. A presidential runner-up,
although not receiving a majority of votes, has
at least received a mandate of confidence from
millions of voters in the country and generally
serves as spokesman for the opposition party.
At a time when the challenge of new ideas
needs to be tempered with the wisdom of ex
perience, the country should not be made to
suffer the silence of these men.
I he proposal made by Stanford professors

Lawrence Ebb, If. Stuart Hughes, llollis Chen
ery and Robert \\ alker is a bold one and merits
serious consideration.
In essence, it would provide for a constitu
tional amendment allowing ex-Presidents a life
time seat in the Senate and presidential run
ners-np a four-year Senate term. These men
would have all the privileges of regular sena
tors except a voire in the organization of the
Senate and appointment of committees. It
would apply to both former Presidents and the
most recent runner-up candidate, Adlai Ste
venson.
In a sense, thr proposal contravenes the prin
ciple of elective representation in the Congress
and will come in for sharp criticism from those
who maintain that such a move would be a
departure from legislative tradition in this
country.
A departure it would certainly be, but, we
feel, a good departure that would keep emi
nently qualified men in public life.
