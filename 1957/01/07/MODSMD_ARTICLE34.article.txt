# Indians Rebound to Nick OSC, 60-58, After Dropping Friday Thriller, 64-63
## 
### Dean Stewart 
For crowd-pleasing, dramatic
tension a professional wrestling
promoter couldn't have made a
better matching than this week
end's basketball games between
Stanford and Oregon State.
OSC took the Pacific Coast
Conference opener for both teams
64-63, Stanford copping the Satur
day encounter 60-58. Tomorrow
night the Cards cross the East
Bay mud flats to battle California
at Berkeley.
Both OSC-Stanford games were
remarkably identical. Each fea
tured tight defense, sharp, fast
ball handling and —as far as the
crowd was concerned — dubious
refereeing. Several calls or "mis
calls" by the striped two appeared
so erroneous that the partisan
Stanford fans went so far as to
boo calls against OSC.
In Friday night's contest the
Beavers' Dave Gam bee scored 30
points to cop high point honors.
9-1 Lead
OSC took an early 9-1 lead
mainly via the free-throw route.
The taller Beavers controlled
both backboards as they gave ev
ery indication of running away
with the game.
However, the Cards slowly be
gan to warm up and eventually
closed the gap. Forward Bill Bond
showed his teammates how and
soon everyone was getting into
the scoring act. Finally Gary Van
Galder put Stanford ahead for
the first time 30-29 with 2:15 min
utes to go in the half.
With seconds remaining, tall
Gary Gobje (6-8) dunked a field
goal to give the Beavers a 34-32
halftime lead.
The final 20 minutes were

touch and go all the way. Oregon
State spurted to the most sizeable
lead either team held in the sec
ond half, 44-37. Again the Cards
came back.
In Lead Hut
With minutes loft Wagner gave
Stanford a 59-54 lead, its biggest
of the second half. Again OSC
went in front 60-59, then
stretched it 1o 62-f>9. Neumann re
turned to tie it up at 62-62 and
Bond put Stanford ahead for the
last time with a free throw, 63 62.
With 1:55 left Wagner out
jumped Ken Nanson and Stan
ford, leading by one point, con
trolled the ball. Neumann tried
an easy layup but the ball would
not drop.
OSC took the rebound and Jer
ry Crimins' layup made it 64-63
with one minute to go. Wagner
called time to set up a play but
Bond missed a shot with 25 sec
onds to go. The Beavers took'the
rebound but couldn't cross the
center line in the 10-second allot
ment.
Again Stanford took time out
to set up. a play. Clint Waring
missed a hook shot but OSC hi)
the ball out of bounds. The ball
was tossed in to Haga standing
all alone under the basket. Haga's
would - be winning shot was good
but it was ruled no basket as the
buzzer was sounding and the
game was over.
Another Thriller
Saturday night's thriller used
the same pattern as the Friday
game. Led by some sharp shoot
ing from Bond, Ihe Cards held
slim leads most of the first half.
However, three straight field
goals by Garnbee gave OSC a 37-
34 halftime lead.
Midway in the second half

Stanford hold a seemingly com
fortable eight-point lead, 58-50.
However, the Indians were only
to score two more points in ihe
remaining 10 minutes. As OSC
gradually crept up on Stanford,
the Cards decided to play a cau
tious, stalling game.
Then the Beaver defense finally
opened up. Wagner tried a lay
up but the ball rolled in and out.
OSC made it 58-56 with 3:30 to go.
Stanford slowly brought the ball
down court but Crimlns stole the
j ball from Neumann and went all
i the way for an easy two points
i and the score was 58-58.
With 1:15 left Neumann
! avenged himself by scoring the
winning basket, 60-58. In the re
maining 75 seconds OSC couldn't
do anything right.
