# Cal, Washington, UCLA Break On Top in Coast Cage Action
## 
### 
California, Washington and IJC
LA broke on top in the Pacific
Coast Conference basketball race
alter a weekend of hair-raising
thrillers.
The Rears swept a pair from
Washington State while the Hus
kies and Bruins were eking out
double wins over Southern Cali
fornia and Idaho.
Defending champion UCLA ran
its PCC cage win streak to 29
games with a pair of one-point
victories over Idaho's scrappy
Vandals. Sophomore Walt Tor
rence supplied the margin for the
Rruins' 64-63 double-overtime win
Friday night and substitute Fred
Crabtree sank two long howitzers
in the last minute for Saturday's
69-68 triumph.
Free Throws Spell Loss
Inaccuracy from the free-throw
line cost Idaho Saturday's game
as they cashed in on only 28 of 45
gift tosses while UCLA was hit
ting 31 of 37. Tho Vandals were
without tho services of injured
guard Gary Simmons, their top
scorer and one of tho loop's best
little men.
Junior center Bruno Boin and
sophomore forward Doug Smart
paced Washington to 76-72 and 80-
78 wins over USC in Los Angeles.
Roin scored 48 points and Smart
43 in the two-game set to subdue
the crippled Trojans.
Comfortable Margins
Only California was able to get
through the weekend with com
fortable margins, bul only after
WSC had given the heavily fa
vored Roars two healthy scares.
Larry Friend paced a comeback

Friday night after the Cougars
had taken a 38-34 half time load.
Saturday night WSC almost
made tho comeback but a late Cnl
spurt gave the Rears a (55-51 tri
umph. Friend again topped scor
ers with 24. Larry Beck paced
the Cougars both nights with 22
and 18.
