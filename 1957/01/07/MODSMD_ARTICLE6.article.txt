# Kadar Revives 'Dictatorship Of Proletariat'
## Crushes Rebel Hopes, Guarantees Freedom Only to Red Faithfuls 
### 
BUDAPEST, Jan. 6 (UP)— Pre
mier Janos Kadar's regime today
declared an old-style Communist
"dictatorship of the proletariat"
that crushed the last hope of pa
triots for political freedom in
Hungary.
Russian tanks trundled into po
sition outside the secret police
headquarters prime rebel target
during the Oct. 23 uprising—to
back up with force the govern
ment declaration which denied
every rebel demand and threat
ened "severest" penalties for
those who resist.
The 10,000-word policy state
ment accused exiled Premier Imre
Nag.v of "treason" and immediate
ly spread fears of a new purge.
Three-Day Meeting
The document was drawn up at
a three-day meeting here between
Soviet Party Chief Nikita Khrush
chev and Deputy Soviet Premier
Georgi Malenkov and the party
bosses of Hungary, Romania, Bul
garia and Czechoslovakia. Inde
pendence-minded Poland and Yu
goslavia were not represented.
The declaration hammered
home two major points:
• "A dictatorship of the pro
letariat has been established in
which the right of freedom is
guaranteed only to those workers,
peasants and intellectuals who are
faithful to the regime."
• "Enemies of the regime must
face prosecution."
The government said the Soviet
army in Hungary "defends, in the
present strained situation, the
Hungarian people against possi
ble military attack by imperial
ists." It said the presence, of
troops would be "negotiated." No
where was withdrawal mentioned.
Neutrality Rejected
Neutrality was rejected with
the statement that Hungary be
lieves there can be peace only
through "a durable association
with the Soviet Union and the
socialist bloc."
Free elections were not men
tioned.
The government promised only
to start negotiations with non-
Communist party representatives
for possible inclusion in the gov
ernment if they are ready to
"fight against counterrevolution."
For all, there would be more
economic woes.
The Kadar regime declared a
short-term economic program that
will temporarily shut down facto
ries idled by the current coal
shortage and abolish capital in
vestments.
