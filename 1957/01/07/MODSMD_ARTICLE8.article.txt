### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 6 (UP)
legislators assemble
in the Capitol tomorrow for 120
days of what is expected to he
the most controversial session in
recent years.
The stage has been set in the
interim since the 1955 session for
bitter fights on such issues as
water rights for counties of sur
plus and counties of need, as well
as for possible unitization of oil
fields. One of the biggest items
in the session, Governor Goodwin
J. Knight's $2 billion budget, will
not make its appearance for an
other week.
