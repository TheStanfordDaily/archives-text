# Fraternal Discrimination
## 
### 
Printed bf.low is a letter wliicli speaks for
itself. Shamefully enough, the letter is a highly
valid appraisal of the wretched situation that
exists in many fraternities on this campus.
Many excuses can and will he made for
clauses in fraternity charters which prohibit
local chapters, many times against their will,
from pledging members of racial and religious
minority groups. But as the letter-writer—a
fraternity man himself—points out, there is no
decent defense.
These clauses are a disgraceful concession to
strong chapters in the Deep South or, in many
cases, merely concessions to religious or racial
intolerance and social pressure.
Current fraternity actives are not responsi
ble for the writing and maintenance of these,
clauses, for fraternity alumni are all-powerful
in creating fraternity policy. Actives can only
recommend policy changes on the national
level.
And it is to the credit of many Stanford
chapters that, in many cases, the restrictive
clauses are totally or partially ignored.
Nevertheless, there are many chapters which
abide by the national rules, burying their ideals
and sense of morality because of alumni pres
sure and fear of the nationals taking action to
revoke their charter.
The situation is not new or unique to Stan
ford. but it something that is talked of in

hushed tones behind fraternity doors. Tt is not
a matter of concern for fraternities exclusively,
as many think, but it is a question of whether
the University or llie student body as a whole
should be made to tolerate the stigma of such
practice.
What can be done? Stanford chapters, be
cause of the nationals'' concern for maintaining
their affiliation at this university, can act posi
tively within their own organization to change
these rules.
•The Interfraternity Council could—and we
believe should—take strong action to see to il
that the Stanford chapters negotiate with the
nationals for removal of these clauses.
Each rushee can take a close look behind the
scenes before he pledges and, if he does pledge
a "discriminating" fraternity, work with good
faith to wipe out this reactionary display of
intolerance.
A fatalistic attitude of acceptance of the
nationals' rides is inexcusable. Even ignoring
the rules, however commendable this may be,
is not enough; for the charters still sanction
racial and religious intolerance, and this policy
is followed by these fraternities on other
campuses.
Stanford fraternities are in a position to lead.
They are in a position to do some needed house
cleaning. They have a worthy cause to
champion.

Current fraternity actives are not responsi
ble for the writing and maintenance of these,
clauses, for fraternity alumni are all-powerful
in creating fraternity policy. Actives can only
recommend policy changes on the national
level.
And it is to the credit of many Stanford
chapters that, in many cases, the restrictive
clauses are totally or partially ignored.
Nevertheless, there are many chapters which
abide by the national rules, burying their ideals
and sense of morality because of alumni pres
sure and fear of the nationals taking action to
revoke their charter.
The situation is not new or unique to Stan
ford. but it something that is talked of in

hushed tones behind fraternity doors. Tt is not
a matter of concern for fraternities exclusively,
as many think, but it is a question of whether
the University or llie student body as a whole
should be made to tolerate the stigma of such
practice.
What can be done? Stanford chapters, be
cause of the nationals'' concern for maintaining
their affiliation at this university, can act posi
tively within their own organization to change
these rules.
•The Interfraternity Council could—and we
believe should—take strong action to see to il
that the Stanford chapters negotiate with the
nationals for removal of these clauses.
Each rushee can take a close look behind the
scenes before he pledges and, if he does pledge
a "discriminating" fraternity, work with good
faith to wipe out this reactionary display of
intolerance.
A fatalistic attitude of acceptance of the
nationals' rides is inexcusable. Even ignoring
the rules, however commendable this may be,
is not enough; for the charters still sanction
racial and religious intolerance, and this policy
is followed by these fraternities on other
campuses.
Stanford fraternities are in a position to lead.
They are in a position to do some needed house
cleaning. They have a worthy cause to
champion.
Printed bf.low is a letter wliicli speaks for
itself. Shamefully enough, the letter is a highly
valid appraisal of the wretched situation that
exists in many fraternities on this campus.
Many excuses can and will he made for
clauses in fraternity charters which prohibit
local chapters, many times against their will,
from pledging members of racial and religious
minority groups. But as the letter-writer—a
fraternity man himself—points out, there is no
decent defense.
These clauses are a disgraceful concession to
strong chapters in the Deep South or, in many
cases, merely concessions to religious or racial
intolerance and social pressure.
