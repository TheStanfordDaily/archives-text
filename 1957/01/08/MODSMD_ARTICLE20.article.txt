'No-Colored-Brothers' Allowed
Editor, The Daily:
Who four years ago would have thought that
bus segregation would be thrown out in many of
our "backward" Southern states before social
segregation was junked at Stanford?
Will we continue 'iscriminate against hu
man brothers who have dark skin here at Stan
ford long after our Southern states make "love
thy black neighbor as well as thy white" a fact
as well as a law?
It would seem so, for there has not been so
much as one word spoken out against the "no
colored-brothers" clause in several of the na
tional fraternity charters here at Stanford.
Now that the scrutinizing eyes of the class
of '60 are focused upon the 24 Stanford fraterni
ties, might it not be the time also for them to
take a look at the national charters upon which
these living groups are based?
With a little bit of research it will be found
that only a small minority of the 24 houses have
"no-colored-brothers" clauses.
Why? Are these few houses faced with the
situation that the majority of the chapters in
their nationals are Southern ones and that the
Northern chapters have tried only in vain to
change the present "no-colored-brothers" clauses?
This is probably the case, yet can this be
rightly used as an excuse for continuing this sup
port of Southern segregation here at Stanford?
Are two or three Greek letters written In â™¦he
same sequence as 30 or 60 fellow chapters more
important to a Stanford living group than the
true democracy of living professed but not prac

ticed in America? Would a minority of "local
fraternities" suffer very greatly among a major
ity of national fraternities if the former became
"local" in the interest of a truer kind of "Chris
tian living"?
What shall the pledge classes of '60 decide?
Will they give their stamp of approval to the
"no-colored-brothers" clauses, by disregarding
the discriminatory charters, or will they join
ranks in an effort to "clean house" by pledging
and applying pressures from within or by refus
ing to associate with and applying pressure from
without the discriminating Stanford chapters?
The next, two weeks W'ill decide the issue.

Last Chance
Editor, The Daily:
Tonight at 8 the final round of a battle to
win consideration for those who do not have ade
quate off-street parking facilities will rommence.
The Menlo Park ordinance which absolutely pro
hibits overnight parking is on the agenda.
In effect, this ordinance says that if you don't
have room to park off the street, you can either
leave town or sell your car. Palo Alto operates
very well indeed under a system whereby per
mits are issued to hardship cases. It will be per
fectly feasible to keep streets clean, reduce acci
dents and vandalism and still permit the minor
ity who need to park overnight the freedom to
do so.
The meeting will be held in the City Council
chambers near Stanford Village, off Ravenswood.
