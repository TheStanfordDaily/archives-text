# Colonel Quizzed On Leak of Secret Missile Document
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP)â€”
The Army announced here today 1
that it is questioning a colonel at j
the Red Stone Arsenal, Hunts- j
ville, Ala., in connection with the
leak of a secret document to "un
authorized persons."
The colonel was identified as
John C. Nickerson, Jr., a Ken
tuckian who is chief of the Field
Co-ordination Branch, Army Bal
listic Missile Agency, Red Stone
Arsenal.
Except for Nickerson, a 1938
West Point graduate, the Army i
did not identify anyone being
questioned about the document.
Army Secretary Wilbur M. I
Brucker announced the investiga-!
tion. He said the Army was stud-;
ying "what appears to be a viola- j
tion of security regulations."
The document was understood
to contain comments on the deci
sion of Defense Secretary Charles
E. Wilson last Nov. 26 allotting
certain guided missiles to the
Army and others to the Air
Force.
"The alleged violation came to
light," Brucker said, when a docu
ment which apparently contained
secret information which dis
cussed the roles and missions de
cision of Nov. 26, 1956, was dis
covered "in the hands of unau
thorized persons."
