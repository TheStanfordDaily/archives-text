# Indians Seek Seventh Consecutive Win Over Cal Bears in Berkeley Tilt Tonight
## Newell's Men Favored In Opening Encounter Of Cross-Bay Rivals 
### Jerry Kelly Sports Editor 
Seven wins in a row over Cali
fornia. That's the record Coach
Howie Dallmar's Stanford cagers
will be out to meet tonight. The
favored Rears host the Indians in
a Pacific Coast Conference home
and home series at 8 in the Ber
keley Gymnasium for Men.
Coach Pete Newell's hoop spe
cialists, who currently lead in the
early PCC basketball race with a
2-0 record, have yet to beat a
Stanford team. The Indians have
topped Cal in their past six en
counters, last year in two spine
tinglers, 66-03 and 70-68.
The experienced Bears have
started the season off strong and
already are harboring hopes of a
PCC championship. Last week
end Cal jumped into the leader's
role with a pair of victories over 1
Washington State College, 62 58
and 05-!) 1.
Rears Lose Two
In pre - conference encounters
the Bears have lost only to the
University of San Francisco, then
rated in the nation's top ten, and
Kansas, the nation's leading col
legiate outfit.
There are several big reasons
other than past performances
why California again takes the
favorile's role. In terms of height
it's center Duane Asplund (6-7)
and forward Don Mcintosh (6-6).
In terms of outstanding court:
performances it's forward Larry
Friend and guard Earl Robinson,
both All-Coast cagers.
Then, too, the Rears will be
playing on their home court, a
definite advantage in this game
of basketball. Finally, Newell's
maple court masters have title
hopes and plan a clean sweep
against Stanford tonight and Ore
gon Friday and Saturday nights.
Perennially, however, Dall
mar's Indian quintet has been the
thorn in the Bear fur. Lacking
real basketball height, the Cards
have combined hustle and deter
mination in upsetting favorites
time and again. With a well-de
served split against Oregon State
last weekend, the Indian five has
gained in confidence. The Rea
vers were rated along with Wash
ington. California and UCLA as
the "big four" this season on Ihe
coast.
Starting Lineup
Dallmar plans to stick with the
starting lineup he used against
OSC. Veteran Bill Bond, who tal

lied 30 points over the weekend,
and Dirk Ilaga will start as for
wards, Clint Waring at center
and Paul Neumann, high man
last weekend with 33 points, and
captain Hap Wagner start at the
guard slots.
F or w a r d s John Pflueger, a
sophomore, and Lee Leonard,
guard Gary Van Galder and cen
ter Carl Isaacs are all slated for
action as top reserves.
In conference action Stanford
trails UCLA, California and
Washington, each with a 2-0 rec
ord. The Cards to date have won
five while losing six. California
has won eight of 10 tilts.
The Bears have most of the
same cast that faced Stanford
last year. Losing but two letter
men, Coach Newell has a sea
soned starting five and a good nu
cleus of sophomores. California
is led by captain Larry Friend,
who holds a 23.5-point game av
erage. The 6-4 forward is rated
by Coach Dallmar as the most
dangerous scorer in the PCC.

With Friend at forward will be
Don Mcintosh. Duane Asplund
starts at center with Earl Robin
son and Gabe Arillaga at the
guard pbsitions. Asplund and
Robinson, too, are high scorers
and have had their nights on the
basketball court.
An advocate of a strong basket
ball defense, Coach Dallmar tabs
California as the toughest team
to check. "You can't concentrate
on any one player," Dallmar
said, "or the other four will run
away with the game."
As an example of the Cal scor
ing ability, Friend, Robinson and
Asplund each averaged over 11
points a game last season, hitting
for 40 per cent of their shots.
Last night Dallmar sent his
varsity through a rugged drill in
preparation for the season's first
meeting between the cross - bay
rivals. After the Cal tilt, the var
sity members will have a short
lay-off before practice begins for
the next double-header against
the University of Washington
here Jan. 18 and 19.

cialists, who currently lead in the
early PCC basketball race with a
2-0 record, have yet to beat a
Stanford team. The Indians have
topped Cal in their past six en
counters, last year in two spine
tinglers, 66-03 and 70-68.
The experienced Bears have
started the season off strong and
already are harboring hopes of a
PCC championship. Last week
end Cal jumped into the leader's
role with a pair of victories over 1
Washington State College, 62 58
and 05-!) 1.
Rears Lose Two
In pre - conference encounters
the Bears have lost only to the
University of San Francisco, then
rated in the nation's top ten, and
Kansas, the nation's leading col
legiate outfit.
There are several big reasons
other than past performances
why California again takes the
favorile's role. In terms of height
it's center Duane Asplund (6-7)
and forward Don Mcintosh (6-6).
In terms of outstanding court:
performances it's forward Larry
Friend and guard Earl Robinson,
both All-Coast cagers.
Then, too, the Rears will be
playing on their home court, a
definite advantage in this game
of basketball. Finally, Newell's
maple court masters have title
hopes and plan a clean sweep
against Stanford tonight and Ore
gon Friday and Saturday nights.
Perennially, however, Dall
mar's Indian quintet has been the
thorn in the Bear fur. Lacking
real basketball height, the Cards
have combined hustle and deter
mination in upsetting favorites
time and again. With a well-de
served split against Oregon State
last weekend, the Indian five has
gained in confidence. The Rea
vers were rated along with Wash
ington. California and UCLA as
the "big four" this season on Ihe
coast.
Starting Lineup
Dallmar plans to stick with the
starting lineup he used against
OSC. Veteran Bill Bond, who tal

lied 30 points over the weekend,
and Dirk Ilaga will start as for
wards, Clint Waring at center
and Paul Neumann, high man
last weekend with 33 points, and
captain Hap Wagner start at the
guard slots.
F or w a r d s John Pflueger, a
sophomore, and Lee Leonard,
guard Gary Van Galder and cen
ter Carl Isaacs are all slated for
action as top reserves.
In conference action Stanford
trails UCLA, California and
Washington, each with a 2-0 rec
ord. The Cards to date have won
five while losing six. California
has won eight of 10 tilts.
The Bears have most of the
same cast that faced Stanford
last year. Losing but two letter
men, Coach Newell has a sea
soned starting five and a good nu
cleus of sophomores. California
is led by captain Larry Friend,
who holds a 23.5-point game av
erage. The 6-4 forward is rated
by Coach Dallmar as the most
dangerous scorer in the PCC.

With Friend at forward will be
Don Mcintosh. Duane Asplund
starts at center with Earl Robin
son and Gabe Arillaga at the
guard pbsitions. Asplund and
Robinson, too, are high scorers
and have had their nights on the
basketball court.
An advocate of a strong basket
ball defense, Coach Dallmar tabs
California as the toughest team
to check. "You can't concentrate
on any one player," Dallmar
said, "or the other four will run
away with the game."
As an example of the Cal scor
ing ability, Friend, Robinson and
Asplund each averaged over 11
points a game last season, hitting
for 40 per cent of their shots.
Last night Dallmar sent his
varsity through a rugged drill in
preparation for the season's first
meeting between the cross - bay
rivals. After the Cal tilt, the var
sity members will have a short
lay-off before practice begins for
the next double-header against
the University of Washington
here Jan. 18 and 19.

end Cal jumped into the leader's
role with a pair of victories over 1
Washington State College, 62 58
and 05-!) 1.
Rears Lose Two
In pre - conference encounters
the Bears have lost only to the
University of San Francisco, then
rated in the nation's top ten, and
Kansas, the nation's leading col
legiate outfit.
There are several big reasons
other than past performances
why California again takes the
favorile's role. In terms of height
it's center Duane Asplund (6-7)
and forward Don Mcintosh (6-6).
In terms of outstanding court:
performances it's forward Larry
Friend and guard Earl Robinson,
both All-Coast cagers.
Then, too, the Rears will be
playing on their home court, a
definite advantage in this game
of basketball. Finally, Newell's
maple court masters have title
hopes and plan a clean sweep
against Stanford tonight and Ore
gon Friday and Saturday nights.
Perennially, however, Dall
mar's Indian quintet has been the
thorn in the Bear fur. Lacking
real basketball height, the Cards
have combined hustle and deter
mination in upsetting favorites
time and again. With a well-de
served split against Oregon State
last weekend, the Indian five has
gained in confidence. The Rea
vers were rated along with Wash
ington. California and UCLA as
the "big four" this season on Ihe
coast.
Starting Lineup
Dallmar plans to stick with the
starting lineup he used against
OSC. Veteran Bill Bond, who tal

lied 30 points over the weekend,
and Dirk Ilaga will start as for
wards, Clint Waring at center
and Paul Neumann, high man
last weekend with 33 points, and
captain Hap Wagner start at the
guard slots.
F or w a r d s John Pflueger, a
sophomore, and Lee Leonard,
guard Gary Van Galder and cen
ter Carl Isaacs are all slated for
action as top reserves.
In conference action Stanford
trails UCLA, California and
Washington, each with a 2-0 rec
ord. The Cards to date have won
five while losing six. California
has won eight of 10 tilts.
The Bears have most of the
same cast that faced Stanford
last year. Losing but two letter
men, Coach Newell has a sea
soned starting five and a good nu
cleus of sophomores. California
is led by captain Larry Friend,
who holds a 23.5-point game av
erage. The 6-4 forward is rated
by Coach Dallmar as the most
dangerous scorer in the PCC.

With Friend at forward will be
Don Mcintosh. Duane Asplund
starts at center with Earl Robin
son and Gabe Arillaga at the
guard pbsitions. Asplund and
Robinson, too, are high scorers
and have had their nights on the
basketball court.
An advocate of a strong basket
ball defense, Coach Dallmar tabs
California as the toughest team
to check. "You can't concentrate
on any one player," Dallmar
said, "or the other four will run
away with the game."
As an example of the Cal scor
ing ability, Friend, Robinson and
Asplund each averaged over 11
points a game last season, hitting
for 40 per cent of their shots.
Last night Dallmar sent his
varsity through a rugged drill in
preparation for the season's first
meeting between the cross - bay
rivals. After the Cal tilt, the var
sity members will have a short
lay-off before practice begins for
the next double-header against
the University of Washington
here Jan. 18 and 19.

Cal Threat Klarling at Guard
Seven wins in a row over Cali
fornia. That's the record Coach
Howie Dallmar's Stanford cagers
will be out to meet tonight. The
favored Rears host the Indians in
a Pacific Coast Conference home
and home series at 8 in the Ber
keley Gymnasium for Men.
Coach Pete Newell's hoop spe
cialists, who currently lead in the
early PCC basketball race with a
2-0 record, have yet to beat a
Stanford team. The Indians have
topped Cal in their past six en
counters, last year in two spine
tinglers, 66-03 and 70-68.
The experienced Bears have
started the season off strong and
already are harboring hopes of a
PCC championship. Last week
end Cal jumped into the leader's
role with a pair of victories over 1
Washington State College, 62 58
and 05-!) 1.
