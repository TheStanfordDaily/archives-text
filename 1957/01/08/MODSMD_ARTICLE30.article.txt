## 
### 
Freshman basketball roach Dick Clegg will send a "ready" squad
against the California frosh this evening at 5:45 in Berkeley. The
local mentor has noted that his squad "did all light" over the past
weekend and is now ready for any foe.
His main problem thus far this season, Clegg reports, has been

teaching his men to play new po
sitions, namely the forward and
guard posts. Second to this has
been the unification of the squad
into a close-knit, smoothly oper
ating unit.
Another point of optimism in
the local camp is the fact that re
serves Marion Keyes and Ted
Muhs have proved themselves ca
pable of breaking into the start
ing lineup.
Thus far this year the Califor
nia team has posted only a 1-3
record for the season, but has
played good ball in its trio of de
feats. Under the eye of the Stan
ford team will be high scorers
Earl Schneider, forward, and Jer
ry Mann, guard.
Named to meet the Cal men
are: Neal Brockmeyer, center;
forwards Chris Burford and Jer
ry Thuesen; and guards Mason
Byles and Ken Balling.
Following the Berkeley tilt, the
frosh will prepare to meet San
Jose JC in a 6 p.m. tussle at the
Pavilion on Saturday.
