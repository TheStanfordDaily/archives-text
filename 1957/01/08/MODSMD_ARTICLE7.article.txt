## 
### 
Both Dean of Students H. Don
aid Winbigler anrl Police Chief
Gordon Davis yesterday labeled
as a "success" the new parking
plan begun last quarter.
Winbigler said, "As in all new
plans there were some unantici
pated difficulties which through
out the quarter were resolved.
My overall reaction is that il was
a conspicuous success."
Davis praised the plan as a
"huge success. We'd have been in
very serious difficulty if we had
n't set it up this year."
The police chief lauded stu
dents for their "excellent co-oper
ation." Admitting difficulties still
exist, Davis philosophized, "There
are r/)00 autos on campus and you
can't park them all around the
Quad."
Regarding the future of the
plan, Winbigler said the adminis
tration will keep on the lookout
to see that no parking lots are
overcrowded fir underused.
No immediate changes in the
plan are contemplated.
