# New PCC Code Will Not Force Stanford Bolt
## 
### Dare Scott Associate Editor 
The recent liberalizing of the
Pacific Coast Conference by the
PCC Council does not necessa
rily mean that Stanford will bolt
the conference, according to As
sistant to the President Frederic
O. Glover.
After the PCC released its
"less work and more .pay" de
cision last Friday, University
President Wallace Sterling told
the press that 'itlie action of the
conference will oblige Stanford
University to re-examine the na
ture' of its participation in inter
collegiate athletics."
Glover emphasized "there are
other ways of re-examination be
side actually leaving the confer
ence." The president is mostly
disturbed about the long-range
meaning of tire fiction.

Sterling has long insisted on
not sacrificing academic princi
ples in order to hold the confer
ence together. Stanford and Or
egon were the only schools to
cast dissenting votes on the
statement of principle about lib
eralized aid.
Last summer Sterling cast the
only negative vote when the
PCC presidents voted 1o ease the
penalties against USC, UCLA,
Washington and California play
ers from a full season to five
games.
Under the new plan, a grant
in-aid for subsistence will be
added to the grant-in-aid for tui
tion and the money-earning job.
An agency would tal<e a for
mula sot by the conference and
determine the amount of this
subsistence grant. Details of the
amount of work a player would

do during the football season
and the rest of the year would
be set forth.
All jobs on this new system
would have to be on campus, as
anypne accepting an off-campus
job would not be eligible for a
grant-in-aid or another orr-cam
pus job.
The Big Ten recently approved
a similar plan, except that it set
no minimum for work.
Such details as work mini
mums and grant regulations will
be worked out in a PCC meeting
in May. The plan definitely ends
the old set-up of a wage limit
under which athletes were pe
nalized last year.
At the same time the council
elected to lift penalties on sports
other than football for; Washing
ton and UCLA. USC had al
ready been freed from these pen

alties. If the National Collegiate
Athletic Association approves
this action, the three schools can
win titles in basketball, baseball
and track. Stanford voted to
keep the original penalties.
The PCC Council was com
posed of the president, athletic
director and faculty representa
tive of each school. Stanford
was represented by Sterling, fac
ulty representative Rixford K.
Snyder atrd Professor John Hurl
but, representing sick Athletic
Director A 1 Masters.
Reaction to the new code has
been heated. Many universities
doubt they can meet the finan
cial obligations of the new code.
University of California Chan
cellor Clark Kerr termed the
code "a step toward profession
alism." San Francisco Chronicle
sports editor and Stanford alum

nus Bill Leiser said. "The Pacific
Coast Conference has decided to
play with professionals."
The code has had the effect of
increasing the tension between
those schools which want unlim
ited aid to athletes and those
wishing to de-emphasize the
stress on and aid to athletics.
The NCAA indicated yester
day that it is seriously consider
ing an amendment to the ath
letic code which would reduce
the allowable salary the athlete
might receive to the point where,
added to his scholarship, it
would cover his room, board,
books, fees and laundry allow
ance.
Walt Byeres, NCAA executive
director, explained that this rule
would prevent a pyramiding of
scholarships and jobs, a thing
feared under the new PCC and
Big Ten rulings.

Reaction to the new code has
been heated. Many universities
doubt they can meet the finan
cial obligations of the new code.
University of California Chan
cellor Clark Kerr termed the
code "a step toward profession
alism." San Francisco Chronicle
sports editor and Stanford alum

nus Bill Leiser said. "The Pacific
Coast Conference has decided to
play with professionals."
The code has had the effect of
increasing the tension between
those schools which want unlim
ited aid to athletes and those
wishing to de-emphasize the
stress on and aid to athletics.
The NCAA indicated yester
day that it is seriously consider
ing an amendment to the ath
letic code which would reduce
the allowable salary the athlete
might receive to the point where,
added to his scholarship, it
would cover his room, board,
books, fees and laundry allow
ance.
Walt Byeres, NCAA executive
director, explained that this rule
would prevent a pyramiding of
scholarships and jobs, a thing
feared under the new PCC and
Big Ten rulings.
The recent liberalizing of the
Pacific Coast Conference by the
PCC Council does not necessa
rily mean that Stanford will bolt
the conference, according to As
sistant to the President Frederic
O. Glover.
After the PCC released its
"less work and more .pay" de
cision last Friday, University
President Wallace Sterling told
the press that 'itlie action of the
conference will oblige Stanford
University to re-examine the na
ture' of its participation in inter
collegiate athletics."
Glover emphasized "there are
other ways of re-examination be
side actually leaving the confer
ence." The president is mostly
disturbed about the long-range
meaning of tire fiction.

Sterling has long insisted on
not sacrificing academic princi
ples in order to hold the confer
ence together. Stanford and Or
egon were the only schools to
cast dissenting votes on the
statement of principle about lib
eralized aid.
Last summer Sterling cast the
only negative vote when the
PCC presidents voted 1o ease the
penalties against USC, UCLA,
Washington and California play
ers from a full season to five
games.
Under the new plan, a grant
in-aid for subsistence will be
added to the grant-in-aid for tui
tion and the money-earning job.
An agency would tal<e a for
mula sot by the conference and
determine the amount of this
subsistence grant. Details of the
amount of work a player would

do during the football season
and the rest of the year would
be set forth.
All jobs on this new system
would have to be on campus, as
anypne accepting an off-campus
job would not be eligible for a
grant-in-aid or another orr-cam
pus job.
The Big Ten recently approved
a similar plan, except that it set
no minimum for work.
Such details as work mini
mums and grant regulations will
be worked out in a PCC meeting
in May. The plan definitely ends
the old set-up of a wage limit
under which athletes were pe
nalized last year.
At the same time the council
elected to lift penalties on sports
other than football for; Washing
ton and UCLA. USC had al
ready been freed from these pen

alties. If the National Collegiate
Athletic Association approves
this action, the three schools can
win titles in basketball, baseball
and track. Stanford voted to
keep the original penalties.
