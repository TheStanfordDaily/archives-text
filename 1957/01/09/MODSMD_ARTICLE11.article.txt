# Top GOP Congressmen Say Eisenhower Doctrine Merits Full Priority in '57 Session
## Representative Walks Out on Dulles Meeting Says Administration Hampers Committee With Mideast Secrecy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP) —
President Eisenhower and Repub
lican congressional leaders agreed
today that the "Eisenhower Doc
trine" resolution and extension of
corporation and excise tax laws
should receive top priority in the
new Congress.
r i hey also marked for urgent
attention such measures as the
President's civil rights and school
construction programs and a bill
to clarify the status of Hungarian
refugees. The tax law involves
about $3 billion a year in federal
revenues.
First '57 Meeting*
The list was drawn up at the
first regular meeting of the year
between Eisenhower and House
and Senate Republican leaders.
The GOP leaders conceded they
will need the approval of the Dem
ocratic leadership in pressing this
legislation. But they expressed
confidence the two parties can get
together on items picked for early
action.
Senate GOP leader William F.
Knowland (Calif.) and House
GOP leader Joseph W. Martin, Jr.,
said their discussion with the
President covered the entire list
of legislation he will recommend
in his State of the Union message
to Congress Thursday.
Streamlined Address
Presidential press secretary
James C. Hagerty said Eisenhow
er will deliver a streamlined mes
sage this year, making it shorter
and more generalized than is cus
tomary.
Also in Washington today. Rep
resentative Wayne L. Hays stalk
ed from a closed-door committee
meeting with Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles, accusing the
Administration of trying to "tie
the committee's hands" with se
cret data on the Middle East.
Closed Doors
The outspoken Ohio Democrat
said he left the House Foreign
Affairs Committee meeting be
cause "I don't believe Dulles ought
to be allowed to hide behind closed
doors to answer embarrassing
questions" about the Administra
tion's past Middle East policies.
Hays paid he wanted to find out
how the Middle East "mess" de
veloped. Several Democratic sen
ators have said they will pursue
the same line of questioning when
hearings on the Middle East issue
shift to the Senate next week.
Doctrine Explanation
Dulles, who testified publicly
yesterday, appeared behind locked
doors today to explain President
Eisenhowers request for author
ity to use economic aid and U.S.
troops, if necessary, to block Rus
sian penetration of the oil-rich
Middle East.
The group clied for a civil
rights program 1 hat would not
only protect the voting rights of
Negroes and other minorities but
would also end "discrimination"
in employment.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP) —
President Eisenhower and Repub
lican congressional leaders agreed
today that the "Eisenhower Doc
trine" resolution and extension of
corporation and excise tax laws
should receive top priority in the
new Congress.
r i hey also marked for urgent
attention such measures as the
President's civil rights and school
construction programs and a bill
to clarify the status of Hungarian
refugees. The tax law involves
about $3 billion a year in federal
revenues.
First '57 Meeting*
The list was drawn up at the
first regular meeting of the year
between Eisenhower and House
and Senate Republican leaders.
The GOP leaders conceded they
will need the approval of the Dem
ocratic leadership in pressing this
legislation. But they expressed
confidence the two parties can get
together on items picked for early
action.
Senate GOP leader William F.
Knowland (Calif.) and House
GOP leader Joseph W. Martin, Jr.,
said their discussion with the
President covered the entire list
of legislation he will recommend
in his State of the Union message
to Congress Thursday.
Streamlined Address
Presidential press secretary
James C. Hagerty said Eisenhow
er will deliver a streamlined mes
sage this year, making it shorter
and more generalized than is cus
tomary.
