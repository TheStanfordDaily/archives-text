# Firm Studies Cellar Losses, Answers Student Complaints
## Accountants Submit 22-Page Finance Report, Suggest Juke Box to Improve Atmosphere 
### 
Horwath & Horwath, Accountants and Auditors, were hired a few
months ago to survey the operations of the Cellar and make recom
mendations on how to improve its ever-poorer financial status.
The accountants recently submitted a 22-page report of their .find
ings to ASSU President Bob Freelen and Student Business Manager

j Bill Mathewson. The points cov
ered in their study were:
• Causes of operating deficit.
• Physical appearance and at
I mosphere of the Cellar.
• Quality of food served.
• Portion sizes and price struc
ture.
• Menu construction.
• Practicability of serving hot
food after 7 p.m.
The principal cause of opera
tional loss is the high cost of
labor, they found. The prime cost
for the year ended Oct. 31, 1956,
was 83.4 per cent of sales. The
loss reported was about 5 per
cent of sales.
To break even in operation, the
prime cost (food and employ
ment) should not exceed 80 per
cent, the firm said. The Cellar
must cut either on food costs or
on payroll costs, they said.
On investigation they found it
would be better to cut food cost
than to tamper with employee
policy.
They suggested the Cellar
should make a determined effort
to create a new active student in
terest.
Student Complaints
Students in recent months have
voiced several complaints about
the Cellar. They complain that it
is unattractive, drab and in need
of renovation.
The accountants agreed with
the students. They recommended
action be taken as soon as pos
sible. They suggested installation
of indirect lighting, and a hi-fi
phonograph, juke box or "canned
music" to improve the atmos-
I phere.
Students complain that Cellar
food is of inferior quality and is
served in portions too small for
prices charged. The present Cel
lar cook has been here for 10
I years. lie may, they said, have
I developed a monotony of style in
preparing the food, which may
; be what students complain of, the
j firm sairl. They found the por
' lions served to he adequate.
Coffee (iood
They said the quality of Cellar
coffee is good. A possible trouble
■ spot may be the water, which,
they suggest, may be improved

Installation of a charcoal broil

They found that serving hambur-
I gcrs at night would be impracti
cal, because of handling difficul
ties.
