Singer Elvis Presley drew a
good crowd last Sunday while
dangling from an overpass on a
highway southeast of Nashville
in his native Tennessee.
Anil Presley wasn't even
wearing sideburns or blue suede
shor-i and wasn't even singing.
The former truck driver who
now drives Cadillacs waS hang
ed in effigy.
The dummy, with the word
"Elvis" emblazoned across its
back, was clad in a red shirt,
blue jeans, light colored leather
sandals and a brown duck-billed
cap.
lis pockets bulged with phony
money.
When a state trooper hauled
down the effigy, the crowd
shouted, "Don't be cruel!" and,
"V' ain't nuthin' but a houn'
dog!"
