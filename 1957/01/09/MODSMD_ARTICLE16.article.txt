### 
WASHINGTON Jan. S (UP)-
Twentv-eight House Democrats
jumped the gun on President Ei
senhower and their own party
leadership today by laying down
a legislative program for the new
session of Congress.
They called for enactment of a
host of measures in a wide vari
ety of fields, including tax relief
for consumers and small busi
ness, school construction and civil
rights.
The group also proposes that
this country take the lead in try
ing to end colonialism by offering
economic aid to nations giving up
their overseas holdings.
Projected Program
The Democrats said it was "im
portant" that the party in control
of a new Congress state publicly
at the outset its "projected pro
gram."
Some of the points were in
cluded on a priority list which
President Eisenhower and Repub
lican Congressional leaders drew
up today. But in most cases the
Democratic proposals went far
beyond the administration's rec
ommendations.
Thus far, the Democratic Con
gressional leadership has not
come up with a legislative pro
gram of its own. It plans to use
the Eisenhower program as a
starting point and proceed from
there.
Independent Action
Acti tig independently, the 28
House Democrats proposed such
measures as an increase in the $1
hourly minimum wage, increased
social security benefits, increased
unemployment compensation and
a cost-of-living pay boost for gov
ernment workers.
They did not consult with
Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Tex.)
in drafting the program and no
Southern Democrats were asked
to endorse it.
However, they predicted a ma
jority of Democratic House mem
bers would support it.
Dulles, replying to Hays' se
crecy biast, said he gave the com
mittee some information that "in
volved the security of the United
States." He told reporters it was
"Ihe kind of thing we normally
don't give except in executive ses
sion."
