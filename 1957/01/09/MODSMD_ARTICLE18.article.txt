# Isolation in the PCC
## 
### 
Thf. Pacific Coast Conff.rf.nce is going pro
fessional. Ami Stanford is the only school that
seems seriously worried ahout it.
In its meeting last week the conference
opened the door'to unlimited financial aid hy
adopting its grants-in-aid for subsistence. The
pressure 112 rom Fred Fagg of USC and Raymond
Allen of UCLA and the worry at dropping
nine out of ten Howl games to I lie Hig Ten
have been too much for the rest of the schools.
Under the new athletic code, players wjuhl
he given needed money beyond the amount
already handed them in the form of grant-in
aid tuition and money earned hy them in on
campus jobs. We hold that this amounts to
hiring athletes. And the practice of a faculty*
agency determining the amount of subsistence
grant-in-aid to he handed to the athlete would
he a farce.
This is the way Stanford President Sterling
feels and this is the way he has voted. We
firmly agree with him that if a student wants
to play football, that is his business. If he can't
support himself working the same hours under
the same conditions as any other student, then
he has no right to play football. Tuition grants
should be determined solely on academic per
formance and financial need. If they are suffi
ciently good students, athletes won hi receive
their proportion of grants and scholarships.
Unfortunately, Stanford stands practically
alone on this subject. It is the only school that
is standing for a university emphasis on aca
demics above athletics. Sterling has long said
he would not be willing to sacrifice his aca
demic principles to keep Stanford in the
Pacific Coast Conference.
The ball is rolling away from Sterling's edu
cational philosophy and toward big-money ath
letics. Though it is doubtful that they could
meet the fin-t rial obligations brought about

by the new, confusing code, the smaller schools
are apparently anxious to he counted among
the big boys.
Stanford is a singularly unique institution
on the West Coast. It is the only large school
west of the Mississippi with a nationally
famous, high academic reputation. 11 it leaves
the conference it will he faced with the pros
pect of having no schools within a thousand
miles in a similar situation which it could play.
W hen faced with a comparable situation a
few years ago, the Ivy League schools abolished
spring practice, quit recruiting practices, with
drew into their own league and are now play
ing .practically no outsiders. They have re
tained their high academic standing and are
still enjoying good football.
Northwestern was faced with a problem like
Stanford's. It also found itself an island of
intellectualism in a sea of professionalism. The
university had to surrender and go big time
along with the rest of the conference.
The question stares us bleakly in the face.
Where does Stanford from here? There is
a slight hope that in May, when the PCC con
venes again, it will ignore the wishes of south
ern California sports writers and chancellors,
and go hack to amateur athletics, leaving the
"■play for {Jay" 1 on the West Coast to the San
Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Hams.
Hut if this doesn't happen, it will force Stan
ford, as Sterling has put it, "to re-examine the
nature of its participation in intercollegiate
athletics."
If the present athletic code remains, this
re-examination can come to but one conclusion
—leave the Pacific Coast Conference. The com
bination of sacrificing faculty salaries, scholar
ships, or building money and placing athletics
above education is just too much. No sport,
no matter how enjoyable, is worth this.
