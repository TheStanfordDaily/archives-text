# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Anne Johnson
## Let's Have Pro Ball, Says Daily Cal Editor 
### 
Big-time football is here to stay. That is, if
the editor of UC's Daily Californian has his
way.
In a Jan. 4 editorial, outgoing editor Boh
Falk suggested that ti.c Cal team become a
professional outfit managed by the California
alumni.
"The philosophy of amateur athletics," Falk
wrote, "is a fine one —the object is not so much
to win as to play well and, if the fates decree,
lose graciously. But we think those who insist,
on applying this principle to a quasi-profes
sional sport either fail to understand or pur
posely neglect the essential characteristics of
their own game. It's not too unlike telling the
stockholders of General Motors to make fine,
cars and forget the cost."'
Falk's solution to the PCC controversy would
retain all the Saturday afternoon hoop-la for
I he Cal student body. The only differences
would he that the players wouldn't he bothered
with attending classes and the school wouldn't
have to face salary demands. Loyal alumni
would pick up all tabs.
'"It is traditional," Falk wrote, "that the
Golden Bears be students. It is not at all es
sential. No one would seriously suggest, for
example, that the 49ers do not represent San
Francisco because they are not native San
Franciscans . . .
'"If professional college football should fail,
it can be abandoned. But if it works, it will
become professional intercollegiate football.
Other schools and other alumni associations
wi II follow our example, new conferences will
be formed, we can again look forward to our
day in the Rose Bowl, and the Big Game will
be revised—bigger than ever, we might add.
"The interim period will be a trial period,
and there will be minor inconveniences—as we
suggested, the Big Game would cease to exist
for a few seasons—but little will be ventured,
and there is much to be gained. And, after all,
inconvenience is the price of leadership."
This solution, titled "A Modest Proposal,"
seems to be a little strong for the Berkeley
students. In an editorial the following day,
Falk explained that his sentiments had not
been those of the Daily Californian staff.

The same day, the UCLA Daily Bruin carried
the banner headline "Last PCC Hopes Fade."
In its top story, the paper lamented the fact
that it expected the latest PCC session to
uphold all football penalties.
It explained that the university's student gov
erning body, the Academic Senate, had given
its approval to withdraw from the conference,
but playing dates had been made through
January, 1958. This was the day before the
session liberalized conference regulations.

UCLA found itself the target of a state senate
un-American activities investigation the week
before vacation.
A subcommittee descended upon the West
wood campus and began probing into Red
infiltration in student activities. It announced
that the Daily Bruin had been infiltrated from
1951 to 1954, when the student body began to
elect the editor.
In a protest editorial, the paper asked why
Communist activity was not given credit for
the change in election policy at that time. We
printed biased material, argued the Daily
Bruin, but it was a case of misguided judgment,
not Communist inspiration.

requested that more than $38 million be al
