# 'ROYAL CHASE'
## Plot of 'The Sleeping Prince' Trite, Yet Play Well Staged 
### Richard Lamb 
The production of "The Sleeping Prince," now delighting audiences
at the Geary in San Francisco, Is an ingeniously directed, hand
somely staged, cleverly acted romp through Terrence Rattigan's
poorest play.
The plot of "The Sleeping Prince" is so trite it makes "The Ten

Commandments" look experimen
tal. An American chorus girl in
London is invited 1o dinner by
the wily Regent of the mythical
kingdom of Carpathia. She goes,
and spends the evening running
around a sofa in the embassy,
pursued by this middle-aged royal
wolf.
With*the help of a goodly quan
tity of champagne and vodka,
Real Love hits her near the end
of the chase, and before the eve
ning is over she wants to over
come "the lack of love in your
life." She never gets the chance;
the drunken chorus girl passes
out.
Half wit Wife
The Grand Duchess, a half-deaf
half-wit who is the Regent's wife
in-name-only as the result of an
international agreement, discov
ers the chorus girl the next .morn
ing and, oblivious to the clandes
tine tryst that was scheduled to
have taken place, takes a fancy to
her and makes her a lady-in-wait
ing. The chorus girl thus sticks it
out in the embassy for a few
more days, long enough for the
Regent to fall in love with her.
But alas, she realizes that This
Can Never Be, and forsakes her
position as court mistress to re
turn to the chorus line, an ending
that might have stirred Sigmund
Romberg or Victor Herbert to
write music for this otherwise
complete operetta.
Visual Comedy
Playwright Rattigan has appar
ently tried to keep the action in
significant and the dialogue as
absurd as possible to allow for an
abundance of visual comedy. Be
cause of the excellent cast, his
idea succeeds. Even the wildest
slapstick is compatible with Rat
tigan's lines. Regrettably, the
play could be even funnier if it
were well written.
The show is carried by Shirley
MacLaine and Hermione Gingold.
Miss MacLaine, the most refresh
ing young actress around, makes
a captivating chorus girl. She is
capable of doing wonderful things
with her face, and she has a
sparkling sense of humor that
permeates everything and every
one on stage. Of course she over
acts — she doesn't walk, she
lunges. Big; the play would die
without her.
Comic Genius
La Gingold's few appearances
as the Grand Duchess are like
new life. The moment she enters,
she»brings the audience up to a
high peak of hilarity that is sus
tained until she exits, which is al
ways too soon. It is hard to imag
ine a funnier woman. She is ei
ther a comic genius or out of her
mind.
Francis Lederer as the Regent
is one of the weaker members of
the cast. He is getting too old to
play romantic leads, and for some
strange reason his Balkan accent
sounds faked (he is a Czech).
The supporting cast is gener
ally excellent, especially David
Lewis and Launa Anders.
