On a recent tour of seven million American colleges,
I was struck by two outstanding facts: first, the great
number of students who smoke Philip Morris; and second,
the great number of students who are married.
The first phenomenon—the vast multitude of Philip
Morris smokers — comes as no surprise, for what could
be more intelligent than to smoke Philip Morris? After
all, pleasure is what you smoke for, and pleasure is what
Philip Morris delivers. Try one. Light up and see for
yourself.... Or, if you like, don't light up. Just take
a Philip Morris, unlighted, and puff a couple of times.
Get that wonderful flavor? You bet you do! Even with
out lighting you can taste Philip Morris's fine natural
tobacco. Also, you can make your package of Philip
Morris last practically forever.
No, T say, it was not the great number of Philip
Morris smokers that astounded me; it \ms the great
number of married students. Latest statistics show that
at some coeducational colleges, the proportion of married
undergraduates runs as high as twenty per cent! And,
what is even more startling, fully one-quarter of these
marriages have been blessed with issue!
Now, to the young campus couple who are parents
for the first time, the baby is likely to be a source of con
siderable worry. Therefore, let me devote today's column
to a few helpful hints on the care of babies.
First of all, we will take up the matter of diet. Tn
the past, babies were raised largely on table scraps. This,
however, was outlawed by the Smoot-Hawley Act, and
today babies are fed a scientific formula consisting of
dextrose, maltose, distilled water, evaporated milk, and
a twist of lemon peel.
After eating, the baby tends to grow sleepy. A lullaby
is very useful to help it fall asleep. In case you don't
know any lullabies, make one up. For example:
Co to sleep, my little infant,
Goo-goo moo-moo poo-poo binfant.
A baby sleeps best on its stomach, so place it that way
in its crib. Then to make sure it will not turn itself over
during the night, lay a soft but fairly heavy object on its
back —another baby, for instance.

So, as you see, raising a baby is no great problem.
All you need is a little patience and a lot of love. Also
