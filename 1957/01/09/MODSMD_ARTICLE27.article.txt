# Looking It Over With Jerry Kelly

### 
This was a most serious decision Harry Doolittle's parents faced
and one thai had their 18-year-old son confused too. llarry had only
recently graduated from Union High School class of 1962. As is
usually the case when a hoy wants to go to college, the problem was
not a financial one.
Mr. Doolittle had mapped his boy/s collegiate future for years—
a solid education as well as an athletic distinction at Stanford. "He'll
be another Bobby Garrett or John Brodie," ho often repeated to his
wife back in the years Harry was tossing the football for a grade
school team- 1955-56-57.
Mr. Doolittle had put away a little money toward his son's educa
tion each year to insure the best. Harry too had saved some money
working when he wasn't playing football. He was a good student and
prided himself upon being practical.
The real problem didn't arise until Harry's senior year in high
school when Harry the football player became Harry Doolittle, All-
State quarterback. Immediately the pressure was on and the boy
liked tin* attention he received, especially thai from the two re
gionul grid powers, Southern California and UCLA.
Harry hadn't considered either school until the sportlight was
turned on him and handsome offers were found in the most unique
places. The talented football player began to lose sight of a univer
sity's primary function and listened only to tales of what he, Harry
DoolittjC, needed.
He was told he needed free tuition, room, board and books. He
also needed money for dates and "everyday expenses." Then 100 he
needed a guarantee of employment after finishing his four years as
a football player. Some schools discovered Harry needed more things
than others.
As important as all this made Harry feel, he was still confused
and, above all, he didn't want to offend his father. Mr. Doolittle, torn
between a decision of football fame or a recognized education, sat
down with his son to explain the difficult situation..
Father told son the history of a once-powerful Pacific Coast
Conference, which in terms of players, coaches and performances
was unofficially rated the nation's best league prior to World War
11, slipped to a second place behind the Bif? Ten after the war and
finally in the mid-1950's was lowered to a "humiliating" third spot.
He explained how institutions individually tried to better their
own position by violating the PCC financial aid code. Washington,
UCLA and Southern California were issued severe penalties by the
PCC Presidents' Council.
"Did that clear it up?" Harry inquired. .
"Just made things worse," Mr. Doolittle said. "That's when the
real fireworks began." He recalled how the presidents met time after
time, how the representatives switched votes save for the president
of his alma mater, Stanford's Wallace Sterling, who continually
voted a straight ticket backed by moral principles.
"Here comes the clincher, Harry. The elements favoring a strong,
balanced PCC, once the majority* suddenly became the minority.
Early in 1957 the Council voted to pay the athlete for participating
in school sports. It. no longer was a part of the student's extra
curricular activities it became a professional business. The code
itself was later changed so that there would he no more violators.
"Some schools, such as Stanford, were forced to object to a
Pacific Coast Conference because of moral convictions; others
were financially unable to compete with the relatively few."
Both Harry and his father agreed the educational standards at
Stanford had not changed, but also that no one could now make All-
American playing there. After all, UCLA and USC had Oklahoma,
Miami, Maryland, Michigan State and Georgia Tech on their sched
ules.
Harry and his father weighed all the facts, rationalized and crime
to a hard decision.
The boy wanted "big-time" football—to play for a "big-name"
school.
