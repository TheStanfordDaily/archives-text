# Speaker Tells Series Audience Of Hopes for Austria-Hungary
## Dengler Calls Homeland Courageous For Condemning Russia, Yet 'Nothing Is Safe' 
### 
Austria-Hungary of 1908 was an economically stable country, Dr.
Paul L. Dengler told a large Tuesday Evening Series audience last
night. "It was my idea then, and throughout my life, that, people
who enjoy economic advantages together should learn to like each
other."
Speaking of his own life and experiences in Austria during the

past 50 years, Dr. Dengler told
how ho organized summer colo
nies of students with this end in
mind.
"Life at the Iron Curtain To
day" was the topic for Dengler's
lecture, fie spoke of "The Mir
acle of Austria — the Glory of
Hungary." An internationally
known educator, he has made
nine lecture tours through the
United States.
"Austria condemned Russia for
its action in Hungary," Dengler
said. "That look courage. In aid
ing (he refugees Austria was able
to do something I never dreamed
she would he able to do."
The Austrian educator spoke of
the aid given to 160,000 Hunga
rian refugees in the recent revo
lution as the fulfillment of his
wish "that Austria and Hungary,
as brothers, would get together."
Dengler credited three factors
for what he called the "Miracle of
Austria." The most surprising
thing was the quick recovery of
Austria. Vienna was rebuilt with
in 10 years after World War II
and the currency and govern
ment are now stable.
"His wit and charm and ability
to accept the situation has saved
the Austrian, along with assist
ance from the United States and
good luck, he said. Austria was
never completely occupied by
Russia.
"Life has become easier for
us," said Dengler, "but it is a dan
gerous living. Nothing is safe.
Within my lifetime I have seen
three empires go down."
