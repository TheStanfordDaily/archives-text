## Robinson, McIntosh, Friend, Asplund Hit; Second Half Decisive 
### 
BERKELEY GYMNASIUM â€”
California burst into a second
half scoring spree to dump a fum
bling Stanford five, 59-45, here
last nighl.
The win, Cal's first over the
Indians since 195-4, placed the
Bears in undisputed leadership in
the young PCC season with a 3-0
record.
Both teams started slow with
Stanford maintaining a 10-6 lead
at the quarter mark. The Cal
quintet was quick to eradicate
this lead and took a healthy five
point lead, 2119, by halftime.
The second half was "no con
test" as four Bears ran their per
sonal scores inlo the double fig
ures while opening their leading
margin to as many as IS points.
Earl Robinson and Larry Friend
tallied 16 and 33 points, respec
tively, for the Bears.
However, Stanford's Dick Ilaga
led the individual scorers with an
18-point output. Bill Bond, cold
in the first half, was the only
other Indian to score over 10
points as Coach Howie Dallmar's
faltering offense failed to match
another good defensive perform
ance.
Stanford did lead 10-6 after 10
minutes of play. Tied at 10-10
shortly thereafter, they never
again held the lead, although they
were as close as 17-18 after a
jump shot by guard Paul Neu
mann late in the half.
During the second half Stan
ford couldn't hit {it even the seven
for 23 pace they had maintained
from the floor in the first half.
The Indians finished the contest
with less than a 30 per cent floor
average. Cal's 40 per cent aver
age tells the story of Ihe ball
game.
