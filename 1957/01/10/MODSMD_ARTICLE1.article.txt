# Eden Resigns Top British Post; Blames Health
## Minister May Become Peer Or Remain a House Member Suez Policy Failure, 111 Health Climax Eden's 30-Year Career on British Political Scene 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 9 (UP)—Sir Anthony Eden resigned as prime min
ister of Great Britain today under the crushing weight of the failure
of his Sue/. Canal policy and his own ill health.
1) was a dismal climax to a brilliant 30-year career which reached
its peak when he stepped in as Winston Churchill's successor less

than two years ago only to meet
failure in a disastrous invasion of
Egypt.
Labor Party Leader Hugh
Gaitskell in Boston, Mass., on a
lecture tour, said he was sorry
to hear about Eden's failing
health but added, "He has done
the right thing in resigning."
It was not immediately certain
whether the 59-year-old Eden will
accept a peerage amounting to
retirement from politics—or re
main in the House of Commons
as his preceessor, Sir Winston
Churchill, has done.
Eden first advised the Queen
that he intended to resign in a
private meeting at her Sandring
ham country home in Norfolk
last night. He returned to Lon
don today to inform the cabinet.
Queen Returns
The Queen's unexpected return
to London was the first indication
the public had had that Eden
had made up his mind to quit.
The Prime Minister spent 40
minutes with (lie Queen. As soon
as he left the palace, a terse an
nouncement of his resignation
was distributed to the press.
A few minutes later, Eden's of
fice at 10 Downing Street pub
lished a medical bulletin saying
"The Prime Minister's health
gives cause for anxiety," and a
farewell statement from Eden
himself saying that it was failing
health that inspired his resigna
tion.
It was the first public indica
tion that the three-week Carib
bean vacation Eden took late last
year to recover from "severe
overstrain," brought on by the
Anglo-French invasion of the
Sue/ Canal Zone, had not fully
restored his strength.
"When I returned to this coun
try a month ago, I hoped that my
health had been sufficiently re
stored to enable me to carry out
my duties effectively for some
considerable time," Eden said.
"That hope has not been real
ized.
"Unable"
"I do not feel that it is right for
me to continue in office as the
Queen's First Minister Knowing
that I shall be unable to do my
full duty by my sovereign and my
country.
"I have therefore decided, with
the utmost regret, that I must
tender my resignation to the
Queen, which Her Majesty has
been graciously pleased to ac
cept."
Eden's resignation marks the
virtual end of a 30-year career as
a statesman, capped by 21 months
in the highest post any British
political leader can hope to
achieve.
He first achieved an interna
tional reputation as British dele
gate to the League of Nations
during the 1930'5. He became For
eign Secretary in 1938, resigned
in protest against the prewar
"appeasement" policy, and re
sumed the office in Churchill's
wartime coalition cabinet.
It only recently became known
that Churchill formally nominat
ed Eden as his choice for the next
Prime Minister 14 years ago, in
the depths of World War 11.
Poor Health
The Prime Minister had been
plagued by recurrent bouts of
poor health since World War II
most seriously in 1952-53, when
he underwent three delicate op
erations in the United States.
Eden was first elected to Par
liament in 1923, and has been a
member of the House of Com
mons He became Par
liamentary Private Secretary to
Foreign Secretary Sir Austen
Chamberlain in 1926, and pro
gressed steadily up the ladder to
leadership in Britain's foreign af
fairs.
Whoever is chosen to succeed
Eden as Prime Minister will not
need to call a new general elec
tion, but it is probable that he will
do so as soon as he considers the
situation favorable as Eden him
self did after succeeding Church
ill in 1955.
The unpreccdentcdly solid ma
jority which the outgoing Prime
Minister won in the 1955 election
means that no new general elec
tion will have to be held until
1960, although the new Prime
Minister may call one whenever
he chooses.

to London was the first indication
the public had had that Eden
had made up his mind to quit.
The Prime Minister spent 40
minutes with (lie Queen. As soon
as he left the palace, a terse an
nouncement of his resignation
was distributed to the press.
A few minutes later, Eden's of
fice at 10 Downing Street pub
lished a medical bulletin saying
"The Prime Minister's health
gives cause for anxiety," and a
farewell statement from Eden
himself saying that it was failing
health that inspired his resigna
tion.
It was the first public indica
tion that the three-week Carib
bean vacation Eden took late last
year to recover from "severe
overstrain," brought on by the
Anglo-French invasion of the
Sue/ Canal Zone, had not fully
restored his strength.
"When I returned to this coun
try a month ago, I hoped that my
health had been sufficiently re
stored to enable me to carry out
my duties effectively for some
considerable time," Eden said.
"That hope has not been real
ized.
"Unable"
"I do not feel that it is right for
me to continue in office as the
Queen's First Minister Knowing
that I shall be unable to do my
full duty by my sovereign and my
country.
"I have therefore decided, with
the utmost regret, that I must
tender my resignation to the
Queen, which Her Majesty has
been graciously pleased to ac
cept."
Eden's resignation marks the
virtual end of a 30-year career as
a statesman, capped by 21 months
in the highest post any British
political leader can hope to
achieve.
He first achieved an interna
tional reputation as British dele
gate to the League of Nations
during the 1930'5. He became For
eign Secretary in 1938, resigned
in protest against the prewar
"appeasement" policy, and re
sumed the office in Churchill's
wartime coalition cabinet.
It only recently became known
that Churchill formally nominat
ed Eden as his choice for the next
Prime Minister 14 years ago, in
the depths of World War 11.
Poor Health
The Prime Minister had been
plagued by recurrent bouts of
poor health since World War II
most seriously in 1952-53, when
he underwent three delicate op
erations in the United States.
Eden was first elected to Par
liament in 1923, and has been a
member of the House of Com
mons He became Par
liamentary Private Secretary to
Foreign Secretary Sir Austen
Chamberlain in 1926, and pro
gressed steadily up the ladder to
leadership in Britain's foreign af
fairs.
Whoever is chosen to succeed
Eden as Prime Minister will not
need to call a new general elec
tion, but it is probable that he will
do so as soon as he considers the
situation favorable as Eden him
self did after succeeding Church
ill in 1955.
The unpreccdentcdly solid ma
jority which the outgoing Prime
Minister won in the 1955 election
means that no new general elec
tion will have to be held until
1960, although the new Prime
Minister may call one whenever
he chooses.
LONDON, Jan. 9 (UP)—Sir Anthony Eden resigned as prime min
ister of Great Britain today under the crushing weight of the failure
of his Sue/. Canal policy and his own ill health.
1) was a dismal climax to a brilliant 30-year career which reached
its peak when he stepped in as Winston Churchill's successor less

than two years ago only to meet
failure in a disastrous invasion of
Egypt.
Labor Party Leader Hugh
Gaitskell in Boston, Mass., on a
lecture tour, said he was sorry
to hear about Eden's failing
health but added, "He has done
the right thing in resigning."
It was not immediately certain
whether the 59-year-old Eden will
accept a peerage amounting to
retirement from politics—or re
main in the House of Commons
as his preceessor, Sir Winston
Churchill, has done.
Eden first advised the Queen
that he intended to resign in a
private meeting at her Sandring
ham country home in Norfolk
last night. He returned to Lon
don today to inform the cabinet.

full duty by my sovereign and my
country.
"I have therefore decided, with
the utmost regret, that I must
tender my resignation to the
Queen, which Her Majesty has
been graciously pleased to ac

Eden's resignation marks the
virtual end of a 30-year career as
a statesman, capped by 21 months
in the highest post any British
political leader can hope to
achieve.
He first achieved an interna
tional reputation as British dele
gate to the League of Nations
during the 1930'5. He became For
eign Secretary in 1938, resigned
in protest against the prewar
"appeasement" policy, and re
sumed the office in Churchill's
wartime coalition cabinet.
It only recently became known
that Churchill formally nominat
ed Eden as his choice for the next
Prime Minister 14 years ago, in
the depths of World War 11.
Poor Health
The Prime Minister had been
plagued by recurrent bouts of
poor health since World War II
most seriously in 1952-53, when
he underwent three delicate op
erations in the United States.
Eden was first elected to Par
liament in 1923, and has been a
member of the House of Com
mons He became Par
liamentary Private Secretary to
Foreign Secretary Sir Austen
Chamberlain in 1926, and pro
gressed steadily up the ladder to
leadership in Britain's foreign af
fairs.
Whoever is chosen to succeed
Eden as Prime Minister will not
need to call a new general elec
tion, but it is probable that he will
do so as soon as he considers the
situation favorable as Eden him
self did after succeeding Church
ill in 1955.
The unpreccdentcdly solid ma
jority which the outgoing Prime
Minister won in the 1955 election
means that no new general elec
tion will have to be held until
1960, although the new Prime
Minister may call one whenever
he chooses.
LONDON, Jan. 9 (UP)—Sir Anthony Eden resigned as prime min
ister of Great Britain today under the crushing weight of the failure
of his Sue/. Canal policy and his own ill health.
1) was a dismal climax to a brilliant 30-year career which reached
its peak when he stepped in as Winston Churchill's successor less

than two years ago only to meet
failure in a disastrous invasion of
Egypt.
Labor Party Leader Hugh
Gaitskell in Boston, Mass., on a
lecture tour, said he was sorry
to hear about Eden's failing
health but added, "He has done
the right thing in resigning."
It was not immediately certain
whether the 59-year-old Eden will
accept a peerage amounting to
retirement from politics—or re
main in the House of Commons
as his preceessor, Sir Winston
Churchill, has done.
Eden first advised the Queen
that he intended to resign in a
private meeting at her Sandring
ham country home in Norfolk
last night. He returned to Lon
don today to inform the cabinet.
Queen Returns
The Queen's unexpected return
to London was the first indication
the public had had that Eden
had made up his mind to quit.
The Prime Minister spent 40
minutes with (lie Queen. As soon
as he left the palace, a terse an
nouncement of his resignation
was distributed to the press.
A few minutes later, Eden's of
fice at 10 Downing Street pub
lished a medical bulletin saying
"The Prime Minister's health
gives cause for anxiety," and a
farewell statement from Eden
himself saying that it was failing
health that inspired his resigna
tion.
It was the first public indica
tion that the three-week Carib
bean vacation Eden took late last
year to recover from "severe
overstrain," brought on by the
Anglo-French invasion of the
Sue/ Canal Zone, had not fully
restored his strength.
"When I returned to this coun
try a month ago, I hoped that my
health had been sufficiently re
stored to enable me to carry out
my duties effectively for some
considerable time," Eden said.
"That hope has not been real
ized.
"Unable"
"I do not feel that it is right for
me to continue in office as the
Queen's First Minister Knowing
that I shall be unable to do my
full duty by my sovereign and my
country.
"I have therefore decided, with
the utmost regret, that I must
tender my resignation to the
Queen, which Her Majesty has
been graciously pleased to ac
cept."
