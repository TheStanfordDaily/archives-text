Stanford will Tun a fellowship
program for high school mathe
matics teachers from Western
states here next summer as part
of Ceneral Fleetric Company's
educational support program.
"The program is intended! to
deepen the knowledge of mathe
matics teachers in our high
schools and increase their aware
ness of the role their subject
takes in contemporary civiliza
tion," said Dr. Sterling.
The application of mathematics
in science and industry will be
particularly stressed in classroom
work and field trips to fIE labora
tories aiift Bay Area factories.
Pr of c <* so r Paul W. Rerg of
Stanford's Mathematics Depart
ment will direct the program
which will start late in June and
continue for six weeks. The
courses offered will include num
ber theory, projective geometry,
fundamental calculus and a semi
nar in philosophy ;md the meth
ods of problem solving.
