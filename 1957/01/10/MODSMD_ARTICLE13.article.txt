# Eastland Regains Senate Committee Chairmanship
## Douglas Bases Opposition on Senator's Supreme Court Segregation Ruling Attack 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP)—Senator James O. Eastland of
Mississippi, a leader in the fighl against civil rights legislation, was
named chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee today despite
opposition from Senator Paul 11. Douglas (D-Ill.)
The action came as the full Senate confirmed Democratic and P.e-

publican commit'ee assignments,
for the new 85th Congress. The
only audible "No" came from
Douglas, although he said Sena
tor Joseph S. Clark, Jr., would
have voted with him if Clark had
been present.
Douglas said the move was
"painful" to him because he en
joyed pleasant personal relations
with his Mississippi colleague and
did not question Eastland's sin
cerity on the civil rights issue.
Demo Spokesman
Rut he said Eastland's attack
on the Supreme Court decision
outlawing racial segregation in
the public schools made him ap
pear as the Democratic spokes
man on this issue.
Douglas also said that his ac
tion was prompted by the fact
that seniority no longer appeared
to be a controlling factor in Dem
ocratic committee assignments.
That was an obvious reference
to the fact that the Democrats
passed over Senator E.stes Kefau
ver (Tenn.) to name Senator
John F. Kennedy (Mass.) to a
coveted seat on the Senate For
eign Relations Committee al
though Kefauver has four years'
seniority.
Morse Resolution
Senator Wayne L. Morse (D-
Ore.), who criticized Eastland's
election as Judiciary Committee
chairman last year, said he had
not changed his position. But he
explained that he is preparing a
resolution dealing with the over
all question of seniority. Sena
tors Richard L. Neuberger (D-
Ore.) and John A. Carroll (D-
Colo.) said they shared Morse's
view. His resolution will go to
the Rules Committee.
The Republicans, who made
their committee assignments ear
lier today, hewed strictly to the
seniority custom. The prize as
signments went to Senators with
the longest service, with fresh
man Senators and those with less
service taking what was left.
Senator William E. Jenner (R
-fnd.) won the most sought after
GOP vacahcy. He was shifted
from the Rules Committee to the
Finance Committee, which han
dles tax, tariff and social security
bills.
The GOP conference gave seats
on the Armed Services Commit
tee to Senators Prescott Bush
(Conn.) and F rank Barrett
(Wyo.). Bush and Barrett had to
relinquish their seats on the Pub
lic Works Committee and the
Rules Committee, respectively.

opposition from Senator Paul 11. Douglas (D-Ill.)
The action came as the full Senate confirmed Democratic and P.e-

publican commit'ee assignments,
for the new 85th Congress. The
only audible "No" came from
Douglas, although he said Sena
tor Joseph S. Clark, Jr., would
have voted with him if Clark had
been present.
Douglas said the move was
"painful" to him because he en
joyed pleasant personal relations
with his Mississippi colleague and
did not question Eastland's sin
cerity on the civil rights issue.
Demo Spokesman
Rut he said Eastland's attack
on the Supreme Court decision
outlawing racial segregation in
the public schools made him ap
pear as the Democratic spokes
man on this issue.
Douglas also said that his ac
tion was prompted by the fact
that seniority no longer appeared
to be a controlling factor in Dem
ocratic committee assignments.
That was an obvious reference
to the fact that the Democrats
passed over Senator E.stes Kefau
ver (Tenn.) to name Senator
John F. Kennedy (Mass.) to a
coveted seat on the Senate For
eign Relations Committee al
though Kefauver has four years'
seniority.
Morse Resolution
Senator Wayne L. Morse (D-
Ore.), who criticized Eastland's
election as Judiciary Committee
chairman last year, said he had
not changed his position. But he
explained that he is preparing a
resolution dealing with the over
all question of seniority. Sena
tors Richard L. Neuberger (D-
Ore.) and John A. Carroll (D-
Colo.) said they shared Morse's
view. His resolution will go to
the Rules Committee.
The Republicans, who made
their committee assignments ear
lier today, hewed strictly to the
seniority custom. The prize as
signments went to Senators with
the longest service, with fresh
man Senators and those with less
service taking what was left.
Senator William E. Jenner (R
-fnd.) won the most sought after
GOP vacahcy. He was shifted
from the Rules Committee to the
Finance Committee, which han
dles tax, tariff and social security
bills.
The GOP conference gave seats
on the Armed Services Commit
tee to Senators Prescott Bush
(Conn.) and F rank Barrett
(Wyo.). Bush and Barrett had to
relinquish their seats on the Pub
lic Works Committee and the
Rules Committee, respectively.
