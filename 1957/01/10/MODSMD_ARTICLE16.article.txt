# Johnson joins New Filibuster Revision Move
## Senator Teams With Knowland to Sponsor 'Middle Ground' Rule 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP) —
Senate Democratic leader Lyndon
R. Johnson (Tex.) today joined
Senate GOP leader William F.
Knowland (Calif.) in sponsoring
a "middle ground" revision of the
Senate's controversial filibuster
rule.
The Johnson-Knowland propos
al was designed to make it easier
for the Senate to break filibus
ters, the traditional weapon used
by Southerners to kill civil rights
legislation.
Under the proposed change, a
vote of two-thirds of senators
present and voting could impose
cloture, or "gag," on debate over
legislation and all other matters
coming before the Senate.
Under the present rules, 64 sen
ators must vote to limit debate on
legislation. In addition, the pres
ent rule stipulates that no limita
tion whatever can be imposed on
debate over a proposed rules
change.
A bipartisan group of Northern
senators was defeated, 57 to 38,
last week in an effort to force tho
Senate to open up its rules for im
mediate revision.
Knowland then announced he
would sponsor a resolution to re
vise the filibuster rule under the
procedures laid down in tho pres
ent rules.
Johnson said he was joining
Knowland in sponsoring the
change because the proposal ap
peals to him "as being based on
the middle ground, which is the
strongest to stand upon."
He said the proposed change
"would expedite the business of
the Senate but would retain the
legitimate safeguards of minority
rights."
Johnson noted that the leader
ship proposal would be referred
to the Rules Committee for care
ful consideration on its merits
"rather than on the basis of tem
porary expediency."
