# Do Alumni Believe in Stanford?
## 
### 
Financing a university with an enrollment
of nearly 8000 students —a community in itself
—is of necessity big business. One aspect of
Stanford's financial aflairs which until recently
has received little notice is the Stanford Fund,
now nearing the close of its 1956-57 campaign.
Each year, during autumn and part of win
ter quarters, the major campaign is conducted.
It is entirely separate from special gifts, do
nations and trusts, and appeals only to Stan
ford alumni and parents of Stanford students.
Soliciting is done each year by mail and
persor.al interviews. Stanford is growing, costs
are growing, and income must grow to meet
these needs. Even if the University were re
maining static, financial aid would be neces
sary.
Recently the Fund was given an editorial
boost by a number of Hay Area newspapers.
But in recent years the Fund has fallen below
the expected quotas, both in money terms and
in the number of alumni contributing.
It is true that Stanford ranks fifth highest
in the nation in over-all contributions to any
college or university. Hut the Stanford Fund

falls far below oilier University alumni funds.
Last year only 18.2 per cent of the alumni
made contributions. Over-all donations totaled
$10,750,000. Alumni donations amounted to
only approximately $600,000 of this figure.
While, of course, the University administra
tion and students who benefit by their dona
tions should he grateful to the many alumni
who have given their time and money lo aid
the school, the small proportion of more than
60,000 alumni who did donate is disturbing.
President Sterling posed this question in last
gear's Stanford Fund report when he said:
"Unless the University can abundantly demon
strate that its own graduates believe in it, and
express that belief by giving, support from
sources with no direct Stanford connection is
more difficult to come by.
"So, along with my great gratitude goes the
earnest hope that more and more of us may
translate interest and belief in Stanford into
active participation in the support of her
progress and growing achievement."
This is the problem. Now it's up to Stanford
alumni, and students who will soon number
among that alumni, to help solve the problem.
