# Eastland Reigns Again
## 
### 
The outworn custom of Senate seniority has
again given progress a kick in the shins.
\\ itli the near-unanimous approval of the
full Senate, "white supremacy" champion
James Eastland was again appointed as chair
man of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Paul
Douglas of Illinois was the lone standout
against giving Eastland glorious new oppor
tunities to thwart civil rights progress.
The senator's record is one of the bleakest
in the country, yet he now stands as chairman
of the Senate committee which has life-and
death nower over the success of all civil rights
leg'-iai mi that body.
I pi ning why he voted against Eastland
and ignored seniority rules. Douglas said that
seniority was 110 longer the controlling factor

in Senate appointments in view of Ilio appoint
ment of John Kennedy over Estes Kefauver
earlier this week. By seniority rules, Kefanver
would have won tlie appointment.
Liberals in both parties oppose Eastland and
all he stands for, yet only one broke with the
seniority custom and voted on a matter of
principle. Senators Morse, ■\cuberger and Car
roll are preparing a resolution to change the
seniority custom for the future. Hut mean
while Eastland reigns.
It is time the Senate took a long, hard look
at itself—and the rules under which it oper
ates, or fails to operate. Committee chairmen
can make or break legislation, as Senator East
land has often proved. It seems a moot point
that they should hi* chosen foy. quality of per
formance rather than quantity of years.
