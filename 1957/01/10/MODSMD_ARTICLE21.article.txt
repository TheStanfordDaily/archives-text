If an in ... strong enough in his
convictions, there is no reason he should be
afraid or ashamed to disclose his name.
In particular, wo received an unsigned lot tor
011 Tuesday from several students who pro
fessed to speak as "spokesmen for several Stan

his convictions, there is no reason he should
be afraid or ashamed to disrloso his name.
