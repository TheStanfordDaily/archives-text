No 'Constitutional Manipulation"
Editor, The Dai];/:
I was amazed to read in certain California
newspapers a suggestion by four Stanford pro
fessors that the United States Constitution he
amended to enable the "most recent runner-up
candidate for Presidency" to act as Senator for
four years and all former Presidents to become
Senators-at-large forever.
Nobody in a rational frame of thought would
contend that a person defeated by a few votes is
all bad and the one emerging victorious is all
good, but the fact remains that there is no better
yardstick for accepting one set of views and re
jecting another as the basis for a four-year ad
ministration.
To resurrect these rejected views and boost
them up as an effective opposition standpoint in
the Senate will run counter, not only to the
spirit of the American Constitution but also to
that of democracy itself. Should this be done, it
would transfer the conflict of ideas and ambi
tions generated in the Presidential election to
the Senate, which is not intended by the Pound
ing Fathers to serve as an arena for such con
flicts.
The emotional warfare against the Chief Ex
ecutive which the defeated Presidential candidate
is bound to bring with him into the Senate must
be accompanied by serious nihilistic tendencies
as the goals of this warfare will be directed to
ward revenge, and this will further retard the
already slow process of legislation. . . .
The aim of Congressional representation is to
provide for a "meeting of minds," not lor a fac
ing of incompatibles. All conventions of repre
sentation are ways of delimiting interests and
adjusting them, and any innovation seeking to
reduce the scope or chances of such delimitation
and adjustment will be an example of a cor rupt
ing tendency which Lasswell has called "the
habit ol' balancing political characterizations on
opposite ends of an ideological teeter-totter."
The legislative function of the British Parlia
ment is unaffected by the "verbal jockeying" be
tween the two warring parties because of the
party discipline, whatever is said against it.
Lacking such discipline, the Senate would be
come a permanent prey to a competitive sensa
tionalism in which the Presidential supporters
and opponents will mostly trade, if the latter are
reinforced with a strong leadership from outside.
It is surprising that professors of political
science and constitutional law failed to distin
guish between the kind of experience required
lor, or acquired from, a Presidential election
campaign and the one that a Senator is supposed
to have behind him.
With his primarily vague and largely general
national outlook constantly intruding upon the
narrow approach of other constituency - bound
Senators, an ex-President or a defeated Presiden
tial candidate is likely to prove a bull in the
china shop, combatting the effect of separation
of powers, the life-breath of the American Con
stitution.
Having no moorings in any Congressional dis
trict, this new legislating gentry will lack the
character, the outlook, the aspiration, and the
sense of responsibility possessed by other sec
tions of the house; and it will, therefore, try to
organize Senate responses to situations having
little or no relevance to its fundamental func
tions.
If a broad national approach is at all neces
sary to exei'cise its moderating influence upon
Senate deliberations, this can be best achieved
by widening the authority of the Vice-President,
who is the president of that house. At the hands
of the intruding outsiders special advantages
may be sought to be enthroned in the policies
supposedly established for the common benefit,
and new tensions and conflicts of interest may
be created to the disadvantage of the-Administra
tion, which may have to suffer for the resulting

maladjustments arrd disequilibr iums without i:
having had any share in causing them.
It is not understandable why the argument â€ž
of experience be used only in the case of ex-
Presidents and the most recent runner-up candi
date for Presidency. There is a whole horde of
physically disabled, mental incapables and ideo
logical incompatibles whose* enor mous experi
ence, everything else apart, would recommend
them for some of the highest positions in the
country.
Once the principle for such utilization is ac
cepted, it will have no reason to stop operating
until it has exhausted the entire store of the
nation's retired Secretaries of State, Treasury,
Agriculture, etc., Mayors, Aldermen, Senators,
Representatives, committee chairmen and the 1
like. If the waste has to be stopped at all it will
have to be stopped on all levels, not only on one.
Stopping it only on one plane and allowing it to
continue on others will only confirm the popular
suspicion that some special political advantage is
being sought in the name of a principal, which
would operate only to the extent of yielding that
advantage.
Although it is not fair to impute motives to
the learned professors, one cannot help thinking
that the proposal offers a leverage to the Demo
cratic leaders like Truman and Stevenson for re
asserting tutelage over their parties in Congress
after it has been scornfully declined by Senate
Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, House Speak
er Sam Rayburn and some committee chairmen
who refuse to participate in an extra-Congres
sional advisory body.
To tighten their loosening grip over- their fol
lowers, a party's leaders should use political
means a resort, to constitutional manipulation
is against the ethics of the game.

Fraternal Obligation
Editor, The Daily:
A word from Professor Ililgard's psychology
text to certain independent students here at Stan
ford who fear fraternity obligation: Growth is
the result of assuming obligation and responsi
bility. lie would have one believe that fraternal
obligation is good. . . .
Independents here at Stanford have succeeded
in catching the "discrimination band wagon."
Climbing on, they shout that fraternities are "the
most undemocratic of all American institutions."
I ask if you decided this while playing golf at
your father's private country club. What dis
crimination did you find there?
Certain independents are telling us that fra
ternity men should fear "rule by the alumni."
Member s of our house look forward to seeing our
alumni. They're helping us to build a new house.
There often seems to be more stress on grade
achievement lhan on knowledge growth at Stan
ford. Surely the "A" student learns more than
the "B" student. I believe that we should be en
couraged to worry less about getting grades and
more about improving our thinking process. A
fraternity man can leave Stanford with more
between the ears because he is subjected to a
more complex college experience than others.
Fraternities will welcome any help from dis
approving students or faculty members. Until
they give us better solutions to our problems,
watch us continue to improve ourselves as we
have.
A new member of a fraternity is raised to the
standards ol his organization upon entering with
sacred decrees and will remain at that level of
prestige until he can improve himself. With im
provement, he'll be the better man.
Rushing is a trying, complicated process of
selection crammed into too short a period of
time. It takes stamina, patience and much
ihought. History has taught us that nothing
worth while has been easy. . . .
