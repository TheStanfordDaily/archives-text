# Village Dorm Is Again Shut Down
## 
### 
The "autumn-quarter dorm" at
Stanford Village is again locked
up until the fall of 1957.
Building 310 was closed this
winter quarter—as it was a year
ago—because of lack of students.
According to University Housing
Director Dr. John Yarborough,
the Village always has its peak in
residents during the autumn
quarter.
As students move on campus or
into private residences the Vil
lage population goes down
enough so that an entire building
can be closed during the other
two quarters.
