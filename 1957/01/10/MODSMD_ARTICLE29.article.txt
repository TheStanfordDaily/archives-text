## Olympics Exemplify Best In Athletics, Jordan Says 
### Dick Barnes 
Sportsmanship, hard work, con
fidence and relent lessness: these
are the things which stand out
most in the mind of Pay ton Jor
dan after his trip to the 1956
Olympic flames in Australia.
Stanford's head track and field
coach, attending his fourth Olym
piad, thinks that the international
games exemplified the best in
athletics; that they provided the
best possible example of "sport
for sport's sake."
Jordan only wishes that the
Olympics could be held every
year. Even amidst the tense
world situation, a better under
standing between athletes of
widely differing backgrounds
was promoted an understanding
which could help to heal world
differences.
Nol to Inspire Hate
The games also showed that
heat of competition should not in
spire hate of competitor. During
their two weeks in Melbourne,
athletes constantly visited with
iheir foes of the track and exhib
ited true sportsmanship when
running or jumping or throwing
against these same men.
Jordan was particularly im
pressed with the humility of Bob
by Morrow and Ron Delany, and
ihe inspiration of John Landy.
Landy, the hero of all Australia
and an early inspiration to De
lany, was the first to congratu
late the Irishman when he won
the 1500-meter gold medal. De
spite aching tendons, Landy had
just taken third in the same race,
but there he was beside the kneel
ing Delany in a gesture of true
sportsmanship.
After 1 talking with the world's
greatest coaches and comparing
notes on all sorts of training pro
grams, Jordan came away con
vinced of one thing: hard work
and sacrifice are a necessity if a
track or field competitor is to suc
ceed.
Turn to Advantage
The ability to take charge—to
turn disadvantage to advantage
was also shown to be vital to a
champion. Russia's distance ace,
Vladimir Kuts, best exemplified
this when he won the 5000 me
ters. Despite being pressed all

the way by Gordon Piric, even to
the extent of having his heels
ticked by Pi lie's shoes, Kuits re
lentlessly wore down the English
man with all matter of varied
running strategy and eventually
won the race. The race, and oth
ers like it, all pointed up the fact
that when one can control him
self, he has nearly won.
No Limitations
That one must have supreme
confidence and must place no
limitations on himself was, to
Jordan's way of thinking, best
shown by hammer thrower Hal
Connelly. Competing with a with
ered and oft-broken left arm, Con
nelly nonetheless met and defeat
ed the challenge of the Russian
great, Mikhail Krivonosov. Kri
vonosov, on the other hand, did
not have the confidence and could
not even avoid fouling each of his
three final throws.
By facing up to the situation
despite handicaps, Connelly
proved to the Stanford mentor
that there is no room in sport for
alibis.
lie said that another important;
ingredient to the winning idea
is the feeling that someone is in
terested in whether or not the
performer wins. It is in this re
gard that other members of the
University can best help the Stan
ford team by displaying an in
terest in the sport and by encour
aging the competitor's.

After 1 talking with the world's
greatest coaches and comparing
notes on all sorts of training pro
grams, Jordan came away con
vinced of one thing: hard work
and sacrifice are a necessity if a
track or field competitor is to suc
ceed.
Turn to Advantage
The ability to take charge—to
turn disadvantage to advantage
was also shown to be vital to a
champion. Russia's distance ace,
Vladimir Kuts, best exemplified
this when he won the 5000 me
ters. Despite being pressed all

the way by Gordon Piric, even to
the extent of having his heels
ticked by Pi lie's shoes, Kuits re
lentlessly wore down the English
man with all matter of varied
running strategy and eventually
won the race. The race, and oth
ers like it, all pointed up the fact
that when one can control him
self, he has nearly won.
No Limitations
That one must have supreme
confidence and must place no
limitations on himself was, to
Jordan's way of thinking, best
shown by hammer thrower Hal
Connelly. Competing with a with
ered and oft-broken left arm, Con
nelly nonetheless met and defeat
ed the challenge of the Russian
great, Mikhail Krivonosov. Kri
vonosov, on the other hand, did
not have the confidence and could
not even avoid fouling each of his
three final throws.
By facing up to the situation
despite handicaps, Connelly
proved to the Stanford mentor
that there is no room in sport for
alibis.

ingredient to the winning idea
is the feeling that someone is in

Sportsmanship, hard work, con
fidence and relent lessness: these
are the things which stand out
most in the mind of Pay ton Jor
dan after his trip to the 1956
Olympic flames in Australia.
Stanford's head track and field
coach, attending his fourth Olym
piad, thinks that the international
games exemplified the best in
athletics; that they provided the
best possible example of "sport
for sport's sake."
Jordan only wishes that the
Olympics could be held every
year. Even amidst the tense
world situation, a better under
standing between athletes of
widely differing backgrounds
was promoted an understanding
which could help to heal world
differences.
Nol to Inspire Hate
The games also showed that
heat of competition should not in
spire hate of competitor. During
their two weeks in Melbourne,
athletes constantly visited with
iheir foes of the track and exhib
ited true sportsmanship when
running or jumping or throwing
against these same men.
Jordan was particularly im
pressed with the humility of Bob
by Morrow and Ron Delany, and
ihe inspiration of John Landy.
Landy, the hero of all Australia
and an early inspiration to De
lany, was the first to congratu
late the Irishman when he won
the 1500-meter gold medal. De
spite aching tendons, Landy had
just taken third in the same race,
but there he was beside the kneel
ing Delany in a gesture of true
sportsmanship.
