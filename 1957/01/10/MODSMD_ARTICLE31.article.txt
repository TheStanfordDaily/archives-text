ST. LOUIS, Jan. 9 (UP)â€”The
National Collegiate Athletic Asso-1
ciation's executive council today
rejected the appeal of three Pa- j
cific Coast Conference members
for a ruling which would lessen
penalties imposed earlier.
The universities, Southern Cali-1
fornia, Washington and UCLA, i
had asked that their restrictions 1
should apply only to football.
But the council held that pro
bation applied to all sports at UC
LA for three years and for two
years at Washington. Only in the
case of Southern Cal was the all
sport penally limited to one year
of a two-year probation period.
