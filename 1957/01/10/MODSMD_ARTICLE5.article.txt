# Ike to Deliver Streamlined State of the Union Message
## Report Contains Legislative Recommendations, World Review; Budget Plan Due Next Week 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP) President Eisenhower will deliver
to Congress in person tomorrow a streamlined report on the State
of the Union that will include some legislative proposals and a review
of conditions at home and abroad.
He will follow it up next Wednesday with his budget message

which is expected to call for
spending of $70-$72 billion in the
new fiscal yean starting July 1.
More than 60 per cent of the
money will be earmarked for the
armed forces and related defense
pi ojects.
Broad Summary
Presidential press secretary
James C. Hagerty said the State
of the Union message would con
tain a few legislative recommen
dations, chiefly in the domestic
field. But primarily it will be a
broad summary of the domestic
and international picture.
Hagerty also announced that
the White House had changed its
mind and decided to bar all press,
radio and picture coverage when
Eisenhower takes the actual oath
of office for his second term on
Sunday, Jan. 20.
Hagerty previously had agreed
to limited coverage. But he said
coverage requests had "gotten out
of hand" and the White House
would hold the ceremony in pri
vacy. The public will have its
chance to see the ceremony re
enacted at ceremonies on Capitol
Hill Monday, Jan. 21.
School Aid
Eisenhower's domestic legisla
tive requests may include federal
school aid and a four-point civil
rights program, both of which
died in the last Congress, and a
liberalization of the immigration
laws.
Both Eisenhower and GOP con
gressional leaders have ruled out
any general tax relief in the next
12 months in favor of a "modest"
budget surplus to be applied
against the national debt. Some
members of Congress, however,
hope to work out a tax cut for
small business.
Tax Extension
Eisenhower and the GOP Sen
ate-House leaders agreed yester
day that extension of present cor
porate and excise taxes will re
ceive top priority in the new Con
gress. These levies, which bring
in $3 billion a year, are scheduled
to drop April 1 unless Congress
acts.
Detailed proposals affecting the
"Eisenhower Doctrine" for the
Middle East, as well as other for
eign policy issues, probably will
be covered in the Jan. 16 budget
message, according to Hagerty's
report.
A $70-$72 billion budget for the
new fiscal year would mean an
increase of some $5 billion over
Eisenhower's spending requests
last year.

12 months in favor of a "modest"
budget surplus to be applied
against the national debt. Some
members of Congress, however,
hope to work out a tax cut for
small business.
Tax Extension
Eisenhower and the GOP Sen
ate-House leaders agreed yester
day that extension of present cor
porate and excise taxes will re
ceive top priority in the new Con
gress. These levies, which bring
in $3 billion a year, are scheduled
to drop April 1 unless Congress
acts.
Detailed proposals affecting the
"Eisenhower Doctrine" for the
Middle East, as well as other for
eign policy issues, probably will
be covered in the Jan. 16 budget
message, according to Hagerty's
report.
A $70-$72 billion budget for the
new fiscal year would mean an
increase of some $5 billion over
Eisenhower's spending requests
last year.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP) President Eisenhower will deliver
to Congress in person tomorrow a streamlined report on the State
of the Union that will include some legislative proposals and a review
of conditions at home and abroad.
He will follow it up next Wednesday with his budget message

which is expected to call for
spending of $70-$72 billion in the
new fiscal yean starting July 1.
More than 60 per cent of the
money will be earmarked for the
armed forces and related defense
pi ojects.
Broad Summary
Presidential press secretary
James C. Hagerty said the State
of the Union message would con
tain a few legislative recommen
dations, chiefly in the domestic
field. But primarily it will be a
broad summary of the domestic
and international picture.
Hagerty also announced that
the White House had changed its
mind and decided to bar all press,
radio and picture coverage when
Eisenhower takes the actual oath
of office for his second term on
Sunday, Jan. 20.
Hagerty previously had agreed
to limited coverage. But he said
coverage requests had "gotten out
of hand" and the White House
would hold the ceremony in pri
vacy. The public will have its
chance to see the ceremony re
enacted at ceremonies on Capitol
Hill Monday, Jan. 21.
School Aid
Eisenhower's domestic legisla
tive requests may include federal
school aid and a four-point civil
rights program, both of which
died in the last Congress, and a
liberalization of the immigration
laws.
Both Eisenhower and GOP con
gressional leaders have ruled out
any general tax relief in the next
