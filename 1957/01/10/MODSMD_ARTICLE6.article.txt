# CAMPAIGN
## Stanford Fund Drive Nears February End 
### Ellen Stuff Editor 
Swinging into its closing weeks
is the Stanford Fund campaign,
which ends in late February.
The annual alumni campaign
iias been compressed this year
into autumn and early winter
quarters, instead of extending
throughout the year.
In reality the Stanford Fund is
a fund-raising project, directed by
and to alumni for financial aid to
the University. Soliciting is done
by mail and personal interviews,
with over 60,000 alumni being
contacted annually.
Parents Committee
Also included in the Fund is the
Parents Committee, which con
tacts non-alumni parents of Stan
ford students.
Other divisions of the Fund in
clude the Law School Fund, Medi
cal Alumni Fund, Engineering
Fund, Business School Fund and
Mineral Sciences Fund.
Graduates of each of these de
partments are contacted for con
tributions, as well as< all other
Stanford alumni. Last year the
solicitation gained $000,000 for the
University, with only 18.2 per cent
of the alumni donating.
Assistance
The General Secretary's office,
under the direction of Dave Jacob
son, helps co-ordinate, assist and
direct promotional efforts and
public relations for this and other-
Stanford fund raising projects.
Present chairman of the Fund
is San Francisco advertising man
Gene K. Walker. Since it was es
tablished in 1936. the Fund has
had seven chairmen.
Money brought in by the cam
paign last year was used for the
following purposes: buildings and
equipment, 1 per cent; student
aid, 2\ per cent; research, 2 per
cent; schools and departments, 32
per cent; salaries, 2 per cent;
other, 2 per cent; unrestricted, 30
per cent.
Some of the funds collected go
to make up the difference be
tween tuition payments and what
it costs the University to house
and educate the students.
Ranks Fifth
In comparison with oilier pri
vate schools, Stanford ranks fifth
highest in over-all fund raising.
But in alumni funds Stanford
ranks low on the list.
In spile of this relatively low
alumni contribution to the Uni
versity, non-alumni parents of
current Stanford students donat
ed over $100,000 last year, making
them number one in the nation
in giving to their children's Alma
Mater.
The Stanford Fund is based pri
marily on a volunteer effort; in
terviewing, sending letters anrl
other activities are carried on by
alumni volunteers.
Associates
Originally the Fund was estab
lished by a small group of alumni,
the Stanford Associates. It was
not prompted by the University
or the Alumni Association, but
grew of itself, untij it has reached
its present membership of 309.
In 1930 the Associates called for
the creation of the Stanford Fund,
and with the approval of ihc
Board of Trustees it was estab
lished. During the period from
193.1 to 1911 the Fund activities
were 112 in a nc e d by University
grants. In 1911 the General Sec
retary's office was established lo
aid these activities.
It is hoped, according to Secre
tary Jacobson, that this year's
Fund toial will exceed last year's.
"However," he said, "it is amazing
to think of the thousands of peo
ple throughout the country who
are taking the time and money to
help Stanford and its students."

help Stanford and its students."

(See editorial, page 2)
Swinging into its closing weeks
is the Stanford Fund campaign,
which ends in late February.
The annual alumni campaign
iias been compressed this year
into autumn and early winter
quarters, instead of extending
throughout the year.
In reality the Stanford Fund is
a fund-raising project, directed by
and to alumni for financial aid to
the University. Soliciting is done
by mail and personal interviews,
with over 60,000 alumni being
contacted annually.
Parents Committee
Also included in the Fund is the
Parents Committee, which con
tacts non-alumni parents of Stan
ford students.
Other divisions of the Fund in
clude the Law School Fund, Medi
cal Alumni Fund, Engineering
Fund, Business School Fund and
Mineral Sciences Fund.
Graduates of each of these de
partments are contacted for con
tributions, as well as< all other
Stanford alumni. Last year the
solicitation gained $000,000 for the
University, with only 18.2 per cent
of the alumni donating.
Assistance
The General Secretary's office,
under the direction of Dave Jacob
son, helps co-ordinate, assist and
direct promotional efforts and
public relations for this and other-
Stanford fund raising projects.
Present chairman of the Fund
is San Francisco advertising man
Gene K. Walker. Since it was es
tablished in 1936. the Fund has
had seven chairmen.
Money brought in by the cam
paign last year was used for the
following purposes: buildings and
equipment, 1 per cent; student
aid, 2\ per cent; research, 2 per
cent; schools and departments, 32
per cent; salaries, 2 per cent;
other, 2 per cent; unrestricted, 30
per cent.
Some of the funds collected go
to make up the difference be
tween tuition payments and what
it costs the University to house
and educate the students.
Ranks Fifth
In comparison with oilier pri
vate schools, Stanford ranks fifth
highest in over-all fund raising.
But in alumni funds Stanford
ranks low on the list.
In spile of this relatively low
alumni contribution to the Uni
versity, non-alumni parents of
current Stanford students donat
ed over $100,000 last year, making
them number one in the nation
in giving to their children's Alma
Mater.
The Stanford Fund is based pri
marily on a volunteer effort; in
terviewing, sending letters anrl
other activities are carried on by
alumni volunteers.
Associates
Originally the Fund was estab
lished by a small group of alumni,
the Stanford Associates. It was
not prompted by the University
or the Alumni Association, but
grew of itself, untij it has reached
its present membership of 309.
In 1930 the Associates called for
the creation of the Stanford Fund,
and with the approval of ihc
Board of Trustees it was estab
lished. During the period from
193.1 to 1911 the Fund activities
were 112 in a nc e d by University
grants. In 1911 the General Sec
retary's office was established lo
aid these activities.
It is hoped, according to Secre
tary Jacobson, that this year's
Fund toial will exceed last year's.
"However," he said, "it is amazing
to think of the thousands of peo
ple throughout the country who
are taking the time and money to
help Stanford and its students."
