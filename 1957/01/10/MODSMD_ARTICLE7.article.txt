## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (TIP)
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary of Stale John Foster Dulles
expressed hope today that resign
ing British Prime Minister Sir An
thony Eden soon would recover
his health.
Diplomatic quarters predicted
Eden's resignation would Hear
the way for greatly improved
American licitish relations.
In separate statements, Eisen
hower and Dulles also wished
Eden "many useful years of hap
piness."
White Mouse press secretary
.lames ('. Hagerty, who issued the
President's statement, was asked
whether such statements did not
normally contain some expression
of regret.
Hagerty declined to go'beyond
the language of the statement ex
cept to say that Eisenhower was
sending a personal message to
Eden.
But 'Dulles later issued a for
mal statement saying Eden's res
ignation "is a matter of rleep re
gret." He praised Eden's "ability
and effective dedication to the
cause of freedom in the world."
There was some official feeling
here at the time of the Egyptian
crisis that Eden double-crossed
the United States by not giving
any advance hint that British
forces were planning to move into
Egypt.
Most congressmen commenting
on the Prime Minister's resigna
tion expressed regret. However,
Rep. John M. Vor.vs (It Ohio),
leading Republican foreign policy
spokesman in the House, said he
thought Eden's resignation "Is a
good thing for Anglo-American
relations."
