### 
LONDON, Jan. 10 (UP)—Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold
Macmillan, a wartime friend of President Eisenhower, was named
Prime Minister by Queen Elizabeth today to succeed the resigned Sir
Anthony Eden. He was expected to move quickly to warm up Sue/.-
chilled relations with the United States.
The suave 61-year-old Macmillan, whose mother was an American,

immediately announced he would
lake office without a general
election. Me faced the difficult
task of repairing British economy
and presige from damages caused
by the Suez intervention policy.
In a nationwide television ad
dress, Macmillan appealed to all
Britons, regardless of party, to
support his efforts. He said he
was now forming a new govern
ment and would present it to the
Queen for approval "in a few
days."
Difficult Task
"We have a difficult task he
fore us," Macmillan told I ho na
tion. "It will need all our cour
age and strength and it will need
the sympathy and understanding
of everyone in the country, what
ever their par ty or beliefs.
"We shall have that sympathy
and I am certain that with Hie
effor ts of all we can succeed."
The surprise choice of Macmil
lan was a victory for right-wing
Conservatives who r e ,j e c t e d
Eden's nominal heir apparent,
H o u s e of Commons Majority
Leader 11. A. Butler, because of
his opposition to the Egyptian in
vasion.
Macmillan, a one-lime, Foreign
Minister, firmly backed Eden's
Sue/ policy. But the guiding fac
tor in his strategy as government
leader' was expected to bo ;i firm
alignment with the United States.
Diplomatic sources here pre
dicted he would make an early
visit to the United States to con
fer with President Eisenhower.
He had a friendly personal tela
tionship with Eisenhower when
Macmillan served as Sir Winston
Churchill's special envoy in North
Afr ica in World War II.
Macmillan was summoned to
Buckingham Palace by the Queen
just 18 hours after- Eden, ex
hausted and discouraged because
of the failure of his lough policy
in Egypt, resigned because of ill
ness.
General Election
When Macmillan returned to
his official residence at No. II
Downing Street—right next door
to his new Prime Minister's quar
ters- newsmen asked him wheth
er he would call a general elec
tion as demanded by opposition
Socialists.
"No," Macmillan replied blunt
j ly. "And when there is one we
will win it."
Under the constitution, MacmiJ
i Ian can take office without a vole
because the term of the present
House of Commons has three
years to run. As long as the new
Prime Minister can command its
confidence, he can continue in
office.

task of repairing British economy
and presige from damages caused
by the Suez intervention policy.
In a nationwide television ad
dress, Macmillan appealed to all
Britons, regardless of party, to
support his efforts. He said he
was now forming a new govern
ment and would present it to the
Queen for approval "in a few
days."
Difficult Task
"We have a difficult task he
fore us," Macmillan told I ho na
tion. "It will need all our cour
age and strength and it will need
the sympathy and understanding
of everyone in the country, what
ever their par ty or beliefs.
"We shall have that sympathy
and I am certain that with Hie
effor ts of all we can succeed."
The surprise choice of Macmil
lan was a victory for right-wing
Conservatives who r e ,j e c t e d
Eden's nominal heir apparent,
H o u s e of Commons Majority
Leader 11. A. Butler, because of
his opposition to the Egyptian in
vasion.
Macmillan, a one-lime, Foreign
Minister, firmly backed Eden's
Sue/ policy. But the guiding fac
tor in his strategy as government
leader' was expected to bo ;i firm
alignment with the United States.
Diplomatic sources here pre
dicted he would make an early
visit to the United States to con
fer with President Eisenhower.
He had a friendly personal tela
tionship with Eisenhower when
Macmillan served as Sir Winston
Churchill's special envoy in North
Afr ica in World War II.
Macmillan was summoned to
Buckingham Palace by the Queen
just 18 hours after- Eden, ex
hausted and discouraged because
of the failure of his lough policy
in Egypt, resigned because of ill
ness.
General Election
When Macmillan returned to
his official residence at No. II
Downing Street—right next door
to his new Prime Minister's quar
ters- newsmen asked him wheth
er he would call a general elec
tion as demanded by opposition
Socialists.
"No," Macmillan replied blunt
j ly. "And when there is one we
will win it."
Under the constitution, MacmiJ
i Ian can take office without a vole
because the term of the present
House of Commons has three
years to run. As long as the new
Prime Minister can command its
confidence, he can continue in
office.
