# Prof Says New Anti-Filibuster Proposal Has 'Good Chance'
## SU's Barclay Sees Cuts Across Party Lines In Senate Voting on Imposing Debate Limits 
### 
Political Science Professor Thomas Barclay said yesterday the bi
partisan anti-filibuster proposal of Senators William Knowlatid and
Lyndon Johnson "has a good chance for adoption."
Barclay found this Senate proposal "fairer" than the one sponsored
by Democratic Senators Paul Douglas and Wayne Morse.

The Knowland-Johnson propo
sal, introduced Wenesday, would
enable two-thirds of the members
present and voting to impose clo
ture on debate over legislation
and all matters coming before
the Senate. It would change the
present filibuster rule, number
22, which necessitates for cloture
a two-thirds approval of all mem
bers, whether present and voting
or not.
The proposal of Douglas and
Morse would give 40 senators—
a constitutional majority — the
right to cut off debate on any
legislation after the legislation
had been under discussion for 15
calendar days.
Not Popular Majority
"A majority of the Senate."
Barclay said, "does not necessa
rily represent a majority of the
American people. It might be best
to adopt the Knowland-Johnson
proposal This provides for wider
coverage."
Barclay anticipated Senators
representing both Northern and
Western st.ites would cut across
party lines and vote for the
Knowland-Johnson proposal.
Barclay attempted to put the
present Senate filibuster fight in
the perspective of history.
Since the revision of the Senate
rules in 1806," the professor re
later!, "there is no way of mov
ing the previous question and
thus bringing debate to a close."
11)17 Rule
He went on to say that the
Senate adopted in 1017 a rule de
signed to stop filibustering.
"But," said Barclay, "it proved
ineffective and was used only on
four occasions."
The 1017 rule, he indicated, con
tained' virtually the same provi
sions as does the proposal spon
sored by Johnson and Knowland.
In I OH), after what Barclay
called a "bitter legislative strug
gle," the Senate adopted the pres
ent filibuster rule.
"Attempts to secure cloture un
der the rule of 1949," Barclay
continued, "have not succeeded.
The bipartison coalition in the
Senate in the present session of
Congress realizes that, if civil
rights legislation is to be enacted,
it will be necessary first to
change ... the nresent rule. . .
Delayed Legislation
While filibusters may have de
layed legislation, he emphasized,
measures postponed by filibus
ters usually become law.
In conclusion, Barclay declared,
"Wide freedom of debate, and ab
sence of cloture, except in grave
emergency, are cherished tradi
tions of the Senate. In my opin
ion, they should be retained. They
tie a necessary check upon the
executive branch and on party
domination."

by Democratic Senators Paul Douglas and Wayne Morse.

The Knowland-Johnson propo
sal, introduced Wenesday, would
enable two-thirds of the members
present and voting to impose clo
ture on debate over legislation
and all matters coming before
the Senate. It would change the
present filibuster rule, number
22, which necessitates for cloture
a two-thirds approval of all mem
bers, whether present and voting
or not.
The proposal of Douglas and
Morse would give 40 senators—
a constitutional majority — the
right to cut off debate on any
legislation after the legislation
had been under discussion for 15
calendar days.
Not Popular Majority
"A majority of the Senate."
Barclay said, "does not necessa
rily represent a majority of the
American people. It might be best
to adopt the Knowland-Johnson
proposal This provides for wider
coverage."
Barclay anticipated Senators
representing both Northern and
Western st.ites would cut across
party lines and vote for the
Knowland-Johnson proposal.
Barclay attempted to put the
present Senate filibuster fight in
the perspective of history.
Since the revision of the Senate
rules in 1806," the professor re
later!, "there is no way of mov
ing the previous question and
thus bringing debate to a close."
11)17 Rule
He went on to say that the
Senate adopted in 1017 a rule de
signed to stop filibustering.
"But," said Barclay, "it proved
ineffective and was used only on
four occasions."
The 1017 rule, he indicated, con
tained' virtually the same provi
sions as does the proposal spon
sored by Johnson and Knowland.
In I OH), after what Barclay
called a "bitter legislative strug
gle," the Senate adopted the pres
ent filibuster rule.
"Attempts to secure cloture un
der the rule of 1949," Barclay
continued, "have not succeeded.
The bipartison coalition in the
Senate in the present session of
Congress realizes that, if civil
rights legislation is to be enacted,
it will be necessary first to
change ... the nresent rule. . .
Delayed Legislation
While filibusters may have de
layed legislation, he emphasized,
measures postponed by filibus
ters usually become law.
In conclusion, Barclay declared,
"Wide freedom of debate, and ab
sence of cloture, except in grave
emergency, are cherished tradi
tions of the Senate. In my opin
ion, they should be retained. They
tie a necessary check upon the
executive branch and on party
domination."


PROF. THOMAS BARCLAY
Says Proposal "Fairer"
Political Science Professor Thomas Barclay said yesterday the bi
partisan anti-filibuster proposal of Senators William Knowlatid and
Lyndon Johnson "has a good chance for adoption."
Barclay found this Senate proposal "fairer" than the one sponsored
by Democratic Senators Paul Douglas and Wayne Morse.

enable two-thirds of the members
