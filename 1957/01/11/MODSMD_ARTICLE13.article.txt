## President Warns Against Dangers of Inflation; Bids for Swift Approval of Mid-East Program

WASHINGTON Jan. 10 (UP)—President Eisenhower urged busi
ness and labor today to soft-pedal wage and price increases lest a
lack of "self-discipline" increase the danger of inflation. This, he
said, would materially damage the economy.
Striving to continue America's "unprecedented" orosoeritv I-.ispn.

j hower also proposed that Con-1
gress create a special "citizens"
commission to conduct a sweep
| ing investigation into the nation's
! financial system and its credit
j policies.
! ' The twin economic proposals
i were among the highlights of a
streamlined 4000-word State of
the Union message which the
President delivered in person to
a televised .joint session of the
new Democratic • controlled 85th
Congress.
In the troubled international!
field, Eisenhower warned that:
Russia's "strongly armed impe
rialist dictatorship poses a contin
uing threat to the free world's
and thus to our nation's security
and peace."
A New Epoch
But he said the "surging and
understandable tide of national
ism" among peoples determined
to be free heralded "a new epoch
in the affairs of mankind." He
cautioned that the United States
could not remain aloof from this
"revolt against tyranny."
The President also entered a
new bid for swift Congressional
approval of his program for keep
ing Russia out of the Middle East
but # the message bore down heav
ily on domestic issues, including a
series of legislative requests
which died in the last Congress.
Eisenhower declared that his
administration had held inflation
in check—a statement which was
promptly challenged by Speaker
Sam Rayburn and other Demo
cratic Congressional leaders.
They said consumers knew living
costs have gone up.
Democratic Opposition
The Democrats also served no
tice that they wanted Congress
rather than a special Presidential
commission to conduct the pro
posed financial investigation.
Senate and House Democrats pre
viously had taken steps to launch
such an inquiry.
The proposed study would be
the first big investigation of cred
it and financial practices since
the famed Pecora investigation
conducted by the Senate Banking
Committee in the early 1930'5.
That study led to many reforms
in banking and stock market
practices.
While Eisenhower deferred
most of his legislative proposals
until his budget message next
Wednesday, he did appeal for
prompt action o na school con
struction bill and his four-point
civil rights program.
Appeal to Business
In his appeal to business and
labor, the President said infla
tionary tendencies are always
present, "in a dynamic economy
operating at today's high levels.
But unions and management, he
said, could help counteract such
trends.
"Business in its pricing policies
should avoid unnecessary price
increases especially at a time like
the present when demand in so
many areas pressed hard on short
supplies," he said. ,
"If our economy is .to remain
healthy, increases iti wages and
other labor benefits, negotiated
by labor and management, must
lie reasonably related to improve
ments in productivity."
Eisenhower appeared to put
equal responsibility on labor and
management. While he did not
threaten government action, he
said that failure to exercise "self
discipline" inevitably would bring
"increasing pressure on govern
ment" to step in.
