# Ike's Address Criticized by Demo Leaders
## Representatives Say Inflation Has Not Been Held in Check 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UP) —
Democratic leaders in Congress
today challenged President Eisen
hower's contention that inflation
has been held in check during the
past four years of his administra
tion.
They also served notice that
they want the Democratic-control
led 85th Congress to conduct the
broad investigation of the nation's
economy, instead of the citizens'
commission proposed by Eisen
hower.
Congressional reaction to Eisen
hower's State of the Union mes
sage — his first since his over
whelming re-election last Novem
ber — generally followed party
lines.
Republicans praised it highly,
but Democarts complained that
the message was too general or
they criticized specific points in
the President's recommendations.
Oppose Statement
House Democratic leaders were
particularly critical of Eisenhow
er's statement that inflation had
been held in check and the cost
of living stabilized under his ad
ministration.
Speaker Sam Rayburn si'd he
did not think "the people who
have been buying things have
found that the cost of living has
been very stable. They have found
it going up."
House Democratic whip Ck-1 Al
bert (Okla.) agreed. Noting that
the cost of living was at an all
time high, Albert said "there is
serious question" as to whether
inflation has been checked as the
President said.
Both Sens. Harry F. Byrd (D-
Va.) and William E. Jonner <R-
Ind.) complained that the Admin
istration's increased government
spending would add to inflation
ary pressures. Jenner said fed
eral spending and tax levels "are
far too high for economic health
or the continued vitality of our
political system."
Cool Reception
Democrats in both the House
and the Senate gave a cool recep
tion to Eisenhower's proposal that
a citizens' commission be set up
to make a broad investigation of
the nation's economic and finan
cial system.
Rayburn noted that Rep. Wrigl '
Patman (D-Tex.) already has in
troduced a resolution calling for
an investigation by the House
Banking Comrryttee Into inters t
rates and other aspects of the
economy. Rayburn said that such
an inquiry seemed "a very proper
thing to do."

an investigation by the House
Banking Comrryttee Into inters t
rates and other aspects of the
economy. Rayburn said that such
an inquiry seemed "a very proper
thing to do."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UP) —
Democratic leaders in Congress
today challenged President Eisen
hower's contention that inflation
has been held in check during the
past four years of his administra
tion.
They also served notice that
they want the Democratic-control
led 85th Congress to conduct the
broad investigation of the nation's
economy, instead of the citizens'
commission proposed by Eisen
hower.
Congressional reaction to Eisen
hower's State of the Union mes
sage — his first since his over
whelming re-election last Novem
ber — generally followed party
lines.
Republicans praised it highly,
but Democarts complained that
the message was too general or
they criticized specific points in
the President's recommendations.
Oppose Statement
House Democratic leaders were
particularly critical of Eisenhow
er's statement that inflation had
been held in check and the cost
of living stabilized under his ad
ministration.
Speaker Sam Rayburn si'd he
did not think "the people who
have been buying things have
found that the cost of living has
been very stable. They have found
it going up."
House Democratic whip Ck-1 Al
bert (Okla.) agreed. Noting that
the cost of living was at an all
time high, Albert said "there is
serious question" as to whether
inflation has been checked as the
President said.
Both Sens. Harry F. Byrd (D-
Va.) and William E. Jonner <R-
Ind.) complained that the Admin
istration's increased government
spending would add to inflation
ary pressures. Jenner said fed
eral spending and tax levels "are
far too high for economic health
or the continued vitality of our
political system."
Cool Reception
Democrats in both the House
and the Senate gave a cool recep
tion to Eisenhower's proposal that
a citizens' commission be set up
to make a broad investigation of
the nation's economic and finan
cial system.
Rayburn noted that Rep. Wrigl '
Patman (D-Tex.) already has in
troduced a resolution calling for
an investigation by the House
Banking Comrryttee Into inters t
rates and other aspects of the
economy. Rayburn said that such
an inquiry seemed "a very proper
thing to do."
