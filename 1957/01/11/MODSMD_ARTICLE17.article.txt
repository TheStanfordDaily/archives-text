# NCAA Means Business
## 
### 
Tut Pacific Coast Com-trench failed to get
by the National Colle wii \*hletic Association
in its march toward professionalism.
Monday the NCAA announced it was seri
oiish considering an amendment to its athletic
code which would reduce the allowable salary
an athlete might receive to the point where,
added to his scholarship, it would cover only
hi- room, hoard, hooks, fees and laundry allow
ances.
This could be a step in the right direction,
an tttempt to halt the pyramiding of jolts and
payments. The only real answer, however, is
the elimination of special athletic subsidies as
such, as even these can be worked around by
I.;!:fu! PCC and Big Ten recruiters.
'f'nt it shows the NCAA's concern with the
{5( nt drift of college amateur athletics.
A more direct slap was delivered to the PCC
\\ ednesday. The NCAA refused to lift the
PCC bans on UCLA, USC and Washington on
sports other than football. Last Friday the PCC
sent a request for the NCAA to do this.

Ibis means the PCC will recognize cham
pionships gained by the three schools in track,
basketball, tennis and baseball, but the NCAA
will not give this recognition and will not allow
the teams in any post-season playoff games.
Obviously the NCAA means business. It is
not allowing the southern California profes
sional element to pressure the organization into
backing down on its penalties. It is holding
to its doctrine that each institution is respon
sible for its violations and must pay the penalty.
We heartily agree with the NCAA. It is too
bad thai a few of the minor sports have to
suffer because of violations in the major sports.
Hut it is basically a problem in the philosophy
of athletics, and if there is over-emphasis on
recruiting, the whole athletic program must
suffer. Hacking down on these bans would
eventually lead to hacking down on other reg
ulations.
It is unfortunate that the PCC didn't see this
for itself and had to be reminded bv a national
organization.
