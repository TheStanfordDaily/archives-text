'fndependent' Point of View
Editor. The Daily:
a recent letter published in The Daily, Tom
T r ably demonstrated that he has been raised
certain "Wei of prestige" and that "with
inrmovement he'll be the better man."
Out of respect for Telfer's enhanced status as
;• v;;ember of a fraternal organization, it is only
fail that he be explained to those who have not
en; being "subjected to a more complex col-
J; >> experience than others."
: 1 first asks us if fraternities are so bad be
1 they practice discrimination, drawing a
: illel between fraternities and country clubs.
It is apt.
We realize that though fraternities and coun
clubs may practice discrimination, some
n ''rubers may be opposed to such standards;
but Telfer appears to base his offensive declara
tion on the contention that because some of us
''ice discrimination in one way, we should all
idone discrimination in any way. Neither fra
t nit ?s nor country clubs are the most undemo
i" institutions in America, for they both elect
th i' house officials.
Then Tclfer examines the structure of knowl
> with penetration and insight. He states, "A
ternity man can leave Stanford with more be
■ \y -in the ears because he is subjected to a more
tv >lle' e experience than others."
n rely proves what a lot of people have

already held: that we should dispense with
classes and devote all our time to extra-eurricu.-
lar activities, social events and sports. Using
these three media as a base it is quite likely that
any college student could leave Stanford with a
much more complex college experience than ho
would ever gain in the classroom.
But unfortunately, this is a university where
acaemic learning is still the major enterprise of
many of the people. The thinking process may
well be improved by trying to decide which
freshmen to pledge, but it has been held that
this can also take place in the classroom.
Telfer examines the metamorphosis attend
ing pledging a fraternity. Enough to say that
serious question exists whether a person is
"raised" or "lowered" to the standards of his
fraternity by joining, or whether any transfor
mation at all takes place.
last Teller calls rushing a severe test
of all ttfe positive attributes of man. Final ex
aminations are too.
The basic problem here is not one of truth;
it is one of orientation. As discrimination is prac
ticed by fraternities, so is it practiced by country
clubs. This is fine if you are a proponent of dis
crimination and have the money to belong to a
eountiy club. 1 am sure Teller deplores discrimi
nation, but he might be reminded that some
people do not join country clubs either.
