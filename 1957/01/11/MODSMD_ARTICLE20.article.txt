# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## What Next for California's Knowland? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
Senator William F. Knowland's announce
ment Monday that he would not seek re-election
in 1958 came as a surprise- even a shock —to
Americans in general, but to Californians specifi
cally.
Conjectures have been flying thick and fast
throughout this state over what the future will
hold for both Democrats and Republicans if
Knowland makes good his announced intention.
Knowland attributed his decision to family
considerations. The political speculators are at
tributing it to other reasons prominent among
them being the possibility that he may run for
governor of this state in 1958. This is how one
series of conjectures runs.
Presidential Hopes
Knowland would like to succeed Eisenhower
as President. His greatest opposition at this time
appears to be Vice-President Richard Nixon. Of
inestimable value to him would be control of Cal
ifornia's delegation to lire Republican convention
in 19(50.
Last year convention delegates were picked
by Knowland, Knight and Nixon. The picker can
usually control the votes of those he picked. Thus
Knowland wants to be in a position to pick dele
gates who will support him over Nixon.
Were he to remain as Senator, Knowland
would probably still have iris pick of only one
third of the delegation. Possible solution? Re
move one of the pickers. Obviously Nixon cannot
be removed as he will still be Vice-President in
39(50. That leaves Knight.
If Knowland were governor in 1960, there
would only be the two pickers unless Senator
KucheJ were given a number' of delegates to
choose. Leaving Kuchel out for the moment,
the delegates would be picked evenly between
Knowland and Nixon.
But if Kuchel were allowed to pick some, and
if Kuchel threw his support behind Knowland
rather than Nixon then Knowland would indeed
be in a good position as far as California's votes
go in the Republican convention.
And Nixon, without the support of his home 1
state, would indeed be in a precarious position
as far as the Presidential nomination is con
cerned.
Could Beat Knigld
Knowland could beat Knight for the gover
norship if, indeed, the light doesn't cripple Ihe
Republicans so much that a Democrat takes
over. But their again, it is conceivable that
Knight, despite his protestations that Knowland's
announcement came as a surprise, may have
been promised a Federal position. There are
rumors to that effect floating around. They were
in the air 1 before Knowland's announcement. If
true, this would eliminate a crippling fight.
Certainly Knowland is not one to make politi
cal gambles unless the odds are pretty much in
his lavor, unless everything h;is been worked out
well in advance.
Republicans stand a possibility of losing a
Senatorship to the Democrats in 1958 regardless
ol what Knowland does. Democrats have been
quiet so far except for Sarn Yorty. One Repub
lican has already thrown his hat in the ring, but
a Democrat running against a Republican who
is not an incumbent might well win the election.
Richard Richards lost last year. He may well
win if he runs again next year.

California should he spelled with a "K." For
it is the "K's" that keep the political fires blazing
in ihe Golden West fires ihat were stoked up
last Monday with the surprise announcement
that one of the "K's" was "retiring."
Senator Knowland, for 12 years a key figure
in the Capitol, made it clear that he would not he
satisfied with the Senate seat after 1958. This
announcement sent at least two other "K's" into
action.
In Sacramento, Governor Goodwin J. Knight
donned a cherubic smile and protested that the
announcement would "not affect" his plans for
the future.
State Controller Robert C. Kirkwood, hearing
the word of a vacated spot in the upper house,
announced he would be ;i candidate for the job
in 1958.
What the Senator plans to do is his secret.
But it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion
that at the age of -18 he is not planning 40 qualify
for a retirement pension.
The evidence points to the probability that
Knowland will be an earnest candidate for the
Presidency in 1900. The two-year period between
1958 and 1960 would furnish an excellent chance
for campaigning.
Active Participation
Last year ihe Senator' made no bones about
his desire to run for the highest office, and only
the candidacy of Eisenhower occasioned Know
land's withdrawal from active participation in
primaries. Nevertheless, he received a number
of token votes in Illinois, Florida and even in
Alaska.
It is not likely, however, that the Senator has
his eye on the governorship, if a race for that
ollice would require him to oppose the present
governor in a Republican primary.
The result of a Knight-Knowland race would
be ol little benefit to the Republican party or to
Knowland himself. The chance of defeat at the
hands of the incumbent gover nor- is no small one,
although Knight has not distinguished himself
in GOP circles during the past lew years.
To place his popularity on the line against a
fellow Republican would t><* ;i risk that Knowland
could not afford to miscalculate, and the only
reward would be the narrowing of the field for
control 0! the i960 convent ion'delegation from
California.
The "K's" of California must realize Ihat 1o
attempt to "bump each other off" woul he politi
cal suicide for ihe Republican party as a whole
in the state.
No One Unscathed
For it is unlikely that any one of the "K's"
has enough influence to survive unscathed in a
battle of survival. In liquidating each other they
would be liquidating themselves, and contribut
ing to a Democratic Iriumph.
There is certain to be a showdown for the 1960
Presidential nomination among leaders from
California, but that is an elephant of a different
color.
For the time being, William Knowland must
realize that his announcement left open only one
political door that of the While House, not the
Governor's Mansion.
