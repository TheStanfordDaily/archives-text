A mess is a mess is a mess.
Ami despite last week's PCC Presidents' Council meeting, it just
doesn't scorn lo he getting any less messy. Of course, we are refer
ring to the controversy which has rocked the PCC since the athletic
fines on Washington last spring.
We heard of that incident and the subsequent injunctions against
IISC, UCLA and California even before we returned to this area in
midsummer from an overseas tour with Uncle Sam. But little did
we suspect from reading the impartial, non-editorial sports pages
of Stars and Stripes the gas pains which the PCC body was suffering.
We soon caught up. "Simon-pure" Stanford seemed pitted against
Ihe world, especially the ogres from the materialistic southland, by
the sports pages.
San Francisco sports writers who were printing "Gee whiz, why
shouldn't football players get scholarships when flute players (no
offense) do?" editorials when we left this country had change
their tunes. They were standing behind Stanford's President Sterling
and his "academic principles." Jab after jab was being directed
southward. These were being returned with equal vehemence by
Los Angeles advocates of a "realistic" policy. We expected to see
Linotypes catapulting overhead at any moment.
The Southern California-Stanford football game was billed as Ihe
carnage of the century. Handling of Ihe UCLA game followed suit.
Needless to say no atomic bombs were unleashed by victor or loser,
either on the Farm or in Los Angeles.
Presidents' Code Meets Opposition
The December and January meetings of the PCC executive com
mittee brought forth another rash of editorial comment and rabble
rousing. Last week's Presidents' Council meeting was especially
heralded as a chance for ihe PCC to "set the course of college foot
ball for the next quarter century. "Don't ameliorate the standing
penalties and don't incorporate the full-free-ride and pro football,"
the papers cried. The presidents did both.
The response was instantaneous. "Pacific Coast Conference Has
Cone Professional," Bill Leiser cried across the top of Sunday's
Sporting Green.
Not satisfied with having UCLA and USC jumping from the
PCC ;j|l fall, the Examiner ran a big, black banner headline, "Stan
for May Holt PCC Over Aid Plan" in its Monday issue. This despite
ihe fact that the subsequent article did not carry even an indirect
quote from a Stanford authority.
Another writer expressed new-found sympathy for the penalized
players who saw their "crimes" made legal. To its 1 his last piece
seemed a hit like kicking a decapitated chicken to make it flop.
It) fact, that is the crux of our comments. We feel there has been
too much kicking just to make the chicken whether it be UCLA,
USC or the PCC flop. This is not to say that we consider the work
manship to be of inferior quality. Nor are we at variance with many
of the points marie by the writers. The sporting pages share the
newspaper's "watchdog" responsibilities for the public and they have
served them well. They have given the public Ihe facts. They have
given them editorial comment.
Too Much "Rainy Day" Writing
However, we have felt we were getting "rainy day" writing too
much of the time. "Let's see, what shall 1 write about today. Oh,
might as well hit this PCC thing again." That is the sort of thing
we felt, especially when the column was just a rehashing of an ear
lier editorial.
We felt at times that the writers were beginning to believe in the
monsters they were perpetrating. Not since the Spanish-American
War has the press made the efforts it did preceding the USC-Stanford
game to provoke open warfare. We could almost feel the disap
pointment in Ihe stories of that contest that there were no incidents.
In effect, all Ihe bales of propaganda about those "grudge games"
did was exert undue pressure on, and ruin the season, for, a fine
Stanford team.
We found Hearst headline of last Monday a classic example
of splash with zero behind it.
The gentlemen from San Francisco seem to be making a bit too
much noise wilh a bit too little said. Too much noise, especially the
"rainy day" variety, may also have an adverse effect on the PCC
policy makers who are to make a final and intelligent decision on
many athletic questions this spring.
However, we would like lo see continued, fresh analysis on the
subject, for we cannot approve of Ihe presidents' code. It is a bit
too nebulous.
We hope the San' Francisco press will forget about their banner
headlines and concentrate on more consistent depth in their analyses.
We feel intelligent application of facts will soon show the unfeasi-
Uility of the new code. Continued emphasis on anticipating PCC
jumps and "grudge" games will do nothing to lead us out of the mire.
It will only create a bigger mess is a mess is a mess.
"Over-emphasis," we calls it.
