## Boxers Take Five Matches Forfeit Two Divisions; Bill Sampson Stars In Light-Heavy Bout 
### Dean Stewart 
Stanford's boxing team, after
forfeiting the first two bouts, fin
ished strong to win five of the
eight bouts actually fought to
earn a 5-5 split with California.
Indians Chuck Bonnett and Bill
Sampson scored impressive wins
as did Herb Davis of California.
In one of the most even battles
of the evening, the Cards' classy
George Batcabe won a split deci
sion over Bill Anderson.
In the 156-pound class, Bonnett,
untested till tonight, must have
been a pleasant surprise for
Coach Ray Lunny. In the first
round Bonnett scored a quick
knock-down over Jim Vogt. Bon
nett pressed his advantage the
rest of the round but appeared to
be tiring at the end. However, he
came out fast and ended the fight
with a clean knockdown in 27 sec
onds.
One of the most colorful fights
of the night was in the 178-pound
class. The Cards' stocky Bill
Sampson came out swinging and
didn't stop until he was awarded
a technical knockout in 1:50 sec
onds of the first round. Cal's Don
Nemir was never in the fight,
finding Sampson's swarming tac
tics too much for him.
Davis, a member of California's
team last year, caught Wally
Honeywell with a sharp left hook
in the openings seconds of the
first round. Davis was awarded a
knockout in 37 seconds.
Ty Miller spotted Cal's Mike
Mcpherson weight and height in
the evening's heavyweight match.
After weathering McPherson's
heaviest blows Miller moved in on
his opponent, constantly beating
him to the punch. Miller contin
ued to pile up points during the j
second. However, he lost his I
mouthpiece and both boxers were
bleeding extensively from the j
mouth at the end of the round, j
The fight was stopped because of!
cuts to both men and the fight
awarded to Miller on points.
Batcabe and Anderson showed I
experience and condition in the j
evening's most professional look- |
ing fightt. Both men were fast, :
threw straight, hard punches and
covered well. However, Batcabe
was the more aggressive of the
two.
The first and third rounds were |
very even. Anderson perhaps held j

a slim advantage in the third (
round, Batcabe the same edge in j
the first. However, the second
round appeared to be all Bat- j
cabe's. None the less, Batcabe I
won only by a split decision.
Tom Ireland tn the 165-pound j
class was Stanford's fifth winner. I
Ireland scored a quick knock
down in the first round and con-1
j tinned to hold the edge over his
I opponent. The fight slowed
through ihe second and third i
I rounds as both men tired.
In the first fight the Indians'
i Greg Lawlor lost a tough TKO to
Cal's Clarke Ide. The first two
I rounds were fast and even. But
i both men were almost too tired to
j box in the third round when the
I fight was stopped and Ide given a ;
TKO in 1:31 seconds.

In one of the most even battles
of the evening, the Cards' classy
George Batcabe won a split deci
sion over Bill Anderson.
In the 156-pound class, Bonnett,
untested till tonight, must have
been a pleasant surprise for
Coach Ray Lunny. In the first
round Bonnett scored a quick
knock-down over Jim Vogt. Bon
nett pressed his advantage the
rest of the round but appeared to
be tiring at the end. However, he
came out fast and ended the fight
with a clean knockdown in 27 sec
onds.
One of the most colorful fights
of the night was in the 178-pound
class. The Cards' stocky Bill
Sampson came out swinging and
didn't stop until he was awarded
a technical knockout in 1:50 sec
onds of the first round. Cal's Don
Nemir was never in the fight,
finding Sampson's swarming tac
tics too much for him.
Davis, a member of California's
team last year, caught Wally
Honeywell with a sharp left hook
in the openings seconds of the
first round. Davis was awarded a
knockout in 37 seconds.
Ty Miller spotted Cal's Mike
Mcpherson weight and height in
the evening's heavyweight match.
After weathering McPherson's
heaviest blows Miller moved in on
his opponent, constantly beating
him to the punch. Miller contin
ued to pile up points during the j
second. However, he lost his I
mouthpiece and both boxers were
bleeding extensively from the j
mouth at the end of the round, j
The fight was stopped because of!
cuts to both men and the fight
awarded to Miller on points.
Batcabe and Anderson showed I
experience and condition in the j
evening's most professional look- |
ing fightt. Both men were fast, :
threw straight, hard punches and
covered well. However, Batcabe
was the more aggressive of the
two.
The first and third rounds were |
very even. Anderson perhaps held j

a slim advantage in the third (
round, Batcabe the same edge in j
the first. However, the second
round appeared to be all Bat- j
cabe's. None the less, Batcabe I
won only by a split decision.

Sampson came out swinging and
didn't stop until he was awarded
a technical knockout in 1:50 sec
onds of the first round. Cal's Don

very even. Anderson perhaps held j

a slim advantage in the third (
round, Batcabe the same edge in j

won only by a split decision.
