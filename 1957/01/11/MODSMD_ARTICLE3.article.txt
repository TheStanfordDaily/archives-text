# Macmillan Is 'Good Choice,' Student Says

"One very good reason for the
choice of Harold Macmillan as
Prime Minister of Great Brilain
is that England now faces an eco
nomic crisis as an aftermath of
the Suez adventure," said Gra
ham Norton, a former student at
the London School of Economics.
"For the next six months at
least, problems facing the gov
ernment will be economic, rather
than purely diplomatic. As Mac
mi linn was Chancellor of the Ex
chequer, his mind is well ac
quainted with these problems."
Norton, now a senior at Stan
ford, said Macmillan had appar
ently approved of the decision to
go into Suez. "Yet he is a man of
moderate views. In spite of look
ing almost like Eden's brother, he
is a man of conisderable original
ity, and is an adroit and polished
speaker."
Macmillan has had close per
sonal contact with the Middle
East. He was Minister Resident
fo Allied Force Headquarters,
Mediterranean Theater, 1043-45.
"The appointment of Harold
Macmillan may, perhaps, see a
much closer connection between
the United Kingdom and the
states of continental Western Eu
rope," Norton suggested. Mac
millan has recently broached a
scheme for partial free trade and
a much closer economic connec
tion with the continent.
"Now, if ever, is the moment
for such a move. With many
members of the Conservative
parly angry with the United
Stales, they may be persuaded to
drop .their normally suspicious
attitude toward continental en
tanglements, and out of this la
mentable situation may come
eventually a much more stable
and rational position for Western
Europe as a whole," he said.
