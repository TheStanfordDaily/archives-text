# Jordan Blasts Israel Troop Concentrations
## Asks Hammarskjold To Investigate Border; Jews Reject Charge 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Jan.
10 (UPi Jordan charged today
thai Israol had assembled "huge
troop concentrations" along the
Jordanian border in the last two
days.
Jordanian delegate Abdul Mo
nem Rifai asked Secretary-Gen
eral Dag Hamrnarskjold to inves
tigate. 110 sairl Hamrnarskjold
immediately asked the UN truce
supervision organization in Pales
tine for a report.
A spokesman for the Israeli
delegation rejected the Jordanian
report as "false."
"Most of the fedayeen raids on
Israel during the past month
have originated from Jordanian
territory," he said. "The allega
tions of Israel troop concentra
tions are obviously designed to
camouflage this action."
General Assembly
Rifai said if Hamrnarskjold
could do nothing about the al
leged buildup he might ask the
General Assembly or the Secu
rity Council to act.
Jordan and Syria both charged
in the latter part of November
that Israel was building up "mas
sive concentrations" of troops on
their borders.
Hamrnarskjold asked his Pales
tine observers to investigate and
they reported no signs of such a
buildup.
Rifai told the General Assem
bly about the alleged buildup at
the end of this morning's session
on the Hungarian question.
Cablegram
Rising on a point of order, lie
read a cablegram he said he had
received from his foreign minis
ter.
"Huge Israeli troop concentra
tions have assembled in the Tul
karan sector along the Jordan
border during the past two days,"
the message said.
"Contact the Secretary-General
of the UN and bring the matter
immediately to the attention of
the UN members before aggres
sion takes place."
