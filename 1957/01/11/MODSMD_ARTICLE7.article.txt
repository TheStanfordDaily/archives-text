# Science Quad Construction
## 
### 
Cons!ruction progresses on the major buildings
of I lie new 30-acre Science Quadrangle. The
physics lecture hall, petroleum engineering
building and microwave addition are well under
way toward completion. Buildings presently
under construction comprise approximately one
fourth of the total 420,000 square feet proposed
for the entire, Science Quad. Seven of < lie II

proposed structures in the area arc now com
plete or under construction. The Science Quad,
developing since IJ)1S when the present High
Energy Physics Laboratory was built, will coin
cide in architecture and landscaping with the
original and adjacent Quad. Completion date
has not yet been determined.
