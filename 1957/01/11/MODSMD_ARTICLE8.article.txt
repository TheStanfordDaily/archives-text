# ACHESON
## Solons Urged To Reject Mid-East Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UP) â€”
Former Secretary of State Dean
Acheson said today the surprise
British-French-Israeli fit tack on
Egypt never would have happened
if he had still been in office.
Acheson, a Cabinet member in
the former Truman Administra
tion, made the statement in urg
ing Congress to, reject President
Eisenhower's new Middle f]ast
policy. He termed it "vague, un
certain, inadequate" and "far too
hazardous."
Acheson testified before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
shortly before Eisenhower issued
a new appeal in his State of the
Union message for his proposed
Middle East resolution. He said it
was*vital to world peace.
Questioned
Rep. Margaret Stilt Church (R
III'.) asked Acheson what lie would
have done if he had been Secre
tary of Stair* when this country's
two NATO partners joined Israel
in the attack on Egypt.
"I would never have allowed il
to happen in the first place," he
replied. He said he would not
have permitted the breakdown in
Anglo-French relations with I tie
United States that preceded the
attack.
"If you reach the point when
your besl friends aren't lolling
you what they are doing," he said,
"something's seriously wrong
wit h Ihe works."
Acheson also was asked if he
did nol agree with the "moral "po
sition" taken by Eisenhower in
declaring after the attack I hat the
United Slates could nol have one
set of rules for its enemies and
another for ils friends.
Different Rules
"Folly," he replied. "Of course
you have different rules for your
friends. You simply couldn't func
lion in international relations if
you didn't.
"The point is nol whether Ihe
British and French should have
committed aggression of course
they should not. The point is
whether they did commit aggres
sion or whether I hey simply took
action which was forced upon
them by our lack of action."
