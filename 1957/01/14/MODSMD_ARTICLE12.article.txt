SACRAMENTO, .fan. 13 (UP)
A private university can resist
certain "pressures" better than a
public institution, according to
Stanford University President J.
Wallace Sterling.
Sterling contended in a speech
here last night that in such areas
as choosing textbooks a contro
versial item in the state at present
and awarding scholarships, pri
vate schools have a stronger po
sition than public schools.
The Stanford head also sided \
with private universities in being
more selective in accepting stu
dents who apply for entrance.
Competition between the two
kinds of schools is a healthy
thing, said Sterling.
lie said a school like Stanford
was not trying to match a public
school's "en masse educational
programs," but rather striving to
give talented students, drawn
from its more select group, great
er individual attention.
Sterling told a meeting at the
Sutter Club that Stanford current
ly is a $21 million annual busi
ness. He said one main problem
is keeping high standards as
growth occurs.
