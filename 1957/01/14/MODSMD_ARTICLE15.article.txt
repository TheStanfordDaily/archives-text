WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (UP)- -Senator Wayne Morse (D-Ore.)
said today this country should not "spill American blood for Ara
bian oil" in developing a policy toward the Middle East.
He said on the AF3C television program "College Press Confer
ence" that he so far has not been "convinced" of the need for the
new "Eisenhower Doctrine." The plan calls for the use of Ameri
can troops, if necessary, to protect the Middle East from Commu
nist aggression.
Another senator who voiced doubts about the President's plan
today was Senator Joseph R McCarthy (R-Wis), who frequently
has clashed with Morse in the Senate.
McCarthy, appearing on the ABC-TV program "Press Confer
ence." said he could not agree that Congress should "abdicate its
duty" by giving Eisenhower standby authority to use U.S. forces.
He said the White House is only "10 minutes" from the Capitol
and that the President could seek Congressional approval of any
action he wanted to take after an emergency arose.
Morse said the doctrine "could bring us into World War 111 if
someone got trigger happy" or an Arab leader deliberately pro
voked Russia into making a military attack.
He said that instead of acting alone in the Mid East, this coun
try should be sponsoring the creation of a United Nations police
force to keep peace in the area. Such a force, he said, "would call
Russia's bluff" in the Middle East.
Senator Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.), also a member of thp For
eign Relations Committee, agreed that the doctrine represents a
go it alone policy in conflict with previous administration
pledges to deter aggression through the UN.
"We are treading on very dangerous ground," he said. He
urged Congress to study "carefully and cautiously . . . the risks
implications and dangers involved" in the President's proposals'
