# FOREIGN AID PASSAGE
## House Demo Leader Warns Of Trouble if Tito Visits U.S. 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (UP)â€”House Democratic Leader John W.
McCormack warned President Eisenhower today that the adminis
tration's foreign aid bill would run into trouble if he invited Marshal
Tito of Yugoslavia to visit the United States.
McCormack, citing "strong rumors" of a Tito trip to Washington,

said that an official invitation
from Eisenhower to the Yugoslav
Communist, leader "would be re
sented by the American people,
and properly so." He said they
would "consider it an insult."
"In addition," he said, "the re
sentment of the people would
make it more difficult to pass an
effective foreign assistance bill,
as well as obtain the necessary
appropriations."
Congressional Protest
Congressional storm clouds be
gun gathering late last month
when a Yugoslav spokesman in
dicated in Belgrade that plans for
the Tito visit were becoming
firm. One Congressman, Repre
sentative Alvin E. O'Konski (R-
Wis.), said he might resign in
protest.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said on Dec. 18 that a
Tito visit was receiving "sympa
thetic consideration" and recalled
that he held "worthwhile" talks
with the Yugoslav chief in 1955.
Other State Department offi
cials said then that there had
been contacts with the Yugoslav
government on the projected vis
it. But they added that the ques
tion of an actual invitation still
was under "consideration and de
velopment."
Jenner Opposition
Senator William E. Jenner (R-
Ind.) joined O'Konski in his oppo
sition. Several other members of
Congress, including Senators Al
exander Wiley and John Spark
man (D-Ala.), took the position
that it was up to Eisenhower and
Dulles to decide whether a Tito
visit might benefit this country.
McCormack said in his state
ment that "it is difficult to be
lieve that President Eisenhower
is seriously considering inviting
Tito to visit the United Slates, or
to permit an invitation to be ex
tended to him as the guest of our
country.
