# Politburo Airs Concern Over Polish Unrest
## Worried About Effect Of Chou En-lai Speech On Coming Elections 
### 
WARSAW, Jan. 13 (UP)—The
Politburo met last night to air its
concern over growing unrest in
Poland and the prospect that yes
terday's Moscow • line speech by
Red China's Premier Chou En-lai
may stir up new trouble, it was
reported today.
Informed sources said Commu
nist Secretary Wladyslaw Gomul
ka called a special meeting of the
party's high command to discuss
the mounting violence of the cam
paign for next Sunday's election
and the unfortunate impression
created by Chou's speech to the
people of Warsaw.
Reports that the Politburo will
hold another special meeting to
morrow could not be confirmed
immediately.
Province Dispatches
Dispatches from the provinces
contain daily reports of campaign
brawls, lynchings, anti-semitism,
hooliganism and steadily growing
opposition to Communism among
the Polish people. .
Although it is probable that the
reports are somewhat exaggerat
ed, there is no doubt that unrest
in Poland today is more serious
than at any time since World
War 11.
The Communists have been
making every effort to line up a
solid electoral majority, purging
unpopular candidates and encour
aging the idea that any voter who
stays away from the polls is a
traitor; but reports of anti-Red
agitation continue to pour in from
all parts of the country.
All Pro-Communist
Although there are nominally
three parties contesting the elec
tion, ail of the candidates are pro-
Communist.
Chou's speech was regarded as
a serious setback for Communist
efforts to muster popular support.
To d a y's Warsaw newspapers
printed the text of the Red lead
er's speech without comment, but
informed sources said Gomulka
was seriously worried by the
tenor of the visitor's remarks.
Chou said repeatedly that the
world's "socialist" countries are
united behind Russia, and empha
sized what he called a recent im
provement in relations between
Poland and the Kremlin.
