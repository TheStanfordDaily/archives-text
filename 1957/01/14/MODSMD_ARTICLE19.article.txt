### 
LONDON, Jan. 13 (UP)—
Prime Minister Harold Macmil
lan kept Foreign Secretary Sel
wyn Lloyd in his new cabinet to
night in a firm and unexpected
rebuff to opponents of British
Middle East policy.
• Diplomats expressed amaze
ment that Macmillan decided
against a clean break with the
policy and personalities involved
in the Suez debacle that led to to
resignation of Prime Minister Sir
Anthony Eden last week. Llo; i
had been Eden's chief lieutenant
in carrying out Middle East poli
cies.
It was believed that Macmillan,
who completely revised his de
fense team, kept Lloyd in office
as a face-saving gesture and that
Lloyd would be replaced at a later
date.
Member.ship Revealed
Macmillan revealed the mem
bership of his 18-man cabinet
after presenting the last to Queen
Elizabeth for her token approval.
Most of the ministers in the
new cabinet are holdovers from
the Eden cabinet. Macmillan
dropped only six of Eden's 19
ministers.
Macmillan named Duncan San
dys, Eden's housing minister and
a son -in - law of Sir Winston
Churchill, to the defense ministry
post, succeeding Antony Head.
Viscount Hailsham, outspoken
First Lord of the Admiralty, was
shuttled to the ministry of educa
tion.
Home Secretary
R. A. Butler, majority leadpr in
the House of Commons who was
passed over for the premiership,
became Home Secretary. The ap
pointment acknowledged his ex -
pected role as a deputy Prim* 2
Minister. He retains his previous
nominal cabinet post as Lord
Privy Seal.
Otherwise, Macmillan kept on
most of the Eden team.
Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd-
George was dropped in favor'of
Butler.
Sir Percy Mills, businessman
and president of the National De
velopment. Corporation, became
Minister of Power with o\
responsibility for developing Brit
ain's power resources in the
atomic era. It will be his first
ministerial job.
Exchequer Post
The post of Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Macmillan's o] ' inb
under Eden, went to Peter Thor
neycroft, president of the Board
of Trade.
Retention of Lloyd as Foreign
Minister was the key to Macmil
lan's plans.
Tt had been predicted that
Lloyd would be ousted as a sym
bol of the unsuccessful Suez ven
ture that helped lead to Eden's
resignation last Wednesday.
Macmillan organized his cabi
net during three days of confer
ences at his official residence, 10
Downing Street.
The constitutional drama
reached its climax when Queen
Elizatfeth returned from her va i
tion at Sandringham to Bucking
ham Palace to receive the cabinc t
list from the hands of her Prime
Minister.
