# Value of Pure Athletics
## 
### 
Wf. are participants in a streamlined, rapid,
hydromatie culture. In a material sense, there
is little that a machine won't do for us. Physi
cal labor—and the accompanying physical ex
ercise.—is cut to a minimum to afford man a
more comfortable and leisurely life.
In a very great sense, this is progress toward
freeing man's energies from purely material
bonds and letting him dwell on higher pursuits
that will bring cultural, as well as material,
achievement to mankind.
Yet there is a direct connection between a
man's physical and mental stature. A collec
tion of intellectual but weak and sickly people
i.- not the answer to man's problems.
This is the higher principle for athletics
being included in the curriculums of most
schools and higher academic institutions. The
ead part of it is that the true value of physical

exercise for the sake of building stronger bodies
is often lost in the spectacular aspects of com
petitive sports. Football is the outstanding
example.
Athletes, especially those who participate in
the more spectacular sports, are adorned heroes,
but they have also become pawns of grand
stand rivalries.
Pure athletics definitely has its place in col
lege life, but pure athletics is not the type of
quasi-professional sport about which we have
been hearing lately.
An institution which is known and envied
for its athletic invincibility above all other
things has only hollow fame. Although Stan
ford's athletic emphasis is far from perfect, we
can he proud and thankful that this university's
name spreads further than Memorial Stadium
and the Sporting Green.
