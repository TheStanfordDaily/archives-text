To Cure the Cellar's Ills

Editor, The Daily:
The results of the Cellar survey as reported
in Wednesday's Daily are a farce, compounding
that evidenced by the hiring of a firm of account
ants and auditors to conduct the study in the
first place.
The contents of the report were largely to be
anticipated from the observations of Christine
Ricker, Director of University Dining Halls,
printed in The Daily when the firm of Horvath
and Horvath was first hired. Hut this is no apol
ogy to the student body and the patrons of the
Cellar for the disservice that has been done to
both.
That the principal cause of operating loss in
the Cellar is high labor cost is sufficiently plain
so that an independent survey was required. The
books of account have shown it; and the Cellar
manager has known it for a painfully long time.
The inadequate physical arrangement and fa
cilities now available in the Cellar and its as
signed mission of service to students can pro
duce no other condition than an excessive labor
cost.
To recommend correction by reducing still
further the food cost is an utterly nonsensical
answer.
That the adequacy of the food served and the
reasonableness ol the prices charged have main
tained their present level with the existing ratio
ol lood cost is a tribute to the capability of the
management and employees.
When compared with ratios customary at
commercially operated restaurants, it is unbeliev
able.
Jt is charged that the continued employment
ol one cook in the Cellar lor 10 years may have
caused her, not him 1 believe, to develop a "mo
notony of style." Since the average student is on
(am pus loi only four years, the clear answer
to monotony" is the hiring of a new cook every
two to four years. This, of course, would not

tamper with employee policy" which the report
hopefully desires to avoid.
The plain truth is that there is a limited num
ber of reasonably priced menus that can be pre
pared with the present facilities, even without
further reducing the percentage of food cost.
It is further recommended that the obviously
drab, rundown environment of the place be im
proved, and patronage thereby increased by in
stallation of such items as indirect lighting and
a music system of some sort.
By themselves, these would represent money
down the drain. The music, in fact, couldn't even
be heard.
What would very likely have been seen in the
situation by a competent firm of management
consultants, what has been pleaded for by the
Cellar management for a number of years, and
what would quite probably eliminate the deficit
is the conversion to u cafeteria system of opera
tion. At the same time, this alteration could well
improve the quality of the food served, while
maintaining the price line in the face of ever
increasing bare costs of food and labor.
When such a conversion has been proposed
in the past, it has been tossed off without more
than a cursory investigation of the cost involved,
nificials have argued it was not a worthwhile
investment in view of the imminent construction
ol the Tresidder Memorial Union, where the cam
pus restaurant was to be relocated.
The new Union has not come to pass, nor
is it expected to be begun in the near future.
Even begun tomorrow, construction would take
from one to two»years.
So as the alternative to cutting the amount
of service to students by cutting food costs or
raising prices- as would be inferred from the
recommendations of the Horvath report, let's put
some sense in the effort and give serious eon
sidoiation to a conversion to cafeteria service in
the Cellar.
Clearly, any capable architect could come up
with a suitable design that would be likely lo
pay off its cost within two to three years.
