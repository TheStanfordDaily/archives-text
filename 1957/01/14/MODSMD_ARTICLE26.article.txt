# Foreign Scholar Says Yugoslavia Comes Closest to Classical Marxist Teachings
## Yugoslav Factories Are Run by Workers, In Russia by Leaders 
### Stan Gross 
"Yugoslavia has a unique posi
tion as a laboratory of socialism,"
said Alexander "Sasha" Aranieki,
ASSU foreign scholar from that
country.
"This is because classical Marx
ist teachings have been most,
closely followed in Yugoslavia,"
he said.
"One of the basic practical dif
ferences between Russian - type
Communism and that of Yugo
slavia is that in the Soviet Union
means of production theoretically
belonging to the people are run
by a score of ministers from a
bureaucratic center," Aranieki
said. "The workers in a factory
do not take an active part in the
running of the enterprise.
"In Yugoslavia every enterprise
is run by a workers' committee
chosen from the employees for a
certain time. This committee em
ploys an administrative director
for the factory, who is responsible
to them and not to any central
ministry," he commented. "In this
way the workers have a direct
part in running the enterprise."
Aranieki, noting a difference in
the agriculture industry between
the two countries, said: "We, un
likt* the Russians, still have pri
vate ownership of land. We try
only to encourage the peasants to
unite among themselves in coop
eratives, keeping private owner
ship even inside the co-operatives.
"This is done because a single
peasant cannot, afford the mod
ern equipment the co-operative
can supply, while the Russians
have a system of collective farms
in which the peasant was forced
to give up his land," he said.
On the international scene, Yu
goslavia has tried to lead an in
dependent policy, especially in the
last decade, Aranieki explained.
"Being a small country, and try
ing to modernize and industrial
ize," he said, "we are vitally in
terested in preserving peace, and
we want to have friendly relations
both with East and West.
"In the recent crises in Hun

gary and I fie Suez, Yugoslavia has
acted according to the independ
ent position of a socialist coun
try," Sa.sha said.
"Both Marshal Tito and Vice-
President Kardelj have denounced
the intervention of the Soviet
army in Hungary as a violation
of the sovereignty of Hungary.
"On the other hand, in the later
stages of the Hungarian rebellion
danger existed that the workers'
rule in Hungary would be over
thrown ami the previous regime
returned. Only in this case, per
haps, the intervention of the So
viet forces was necessary as a
'necessary evil'."
Yugoslavia denounced the An
glo - French - Israeli attack on

Egypt- For the first time in her
history, he said, Yugoslavia sent
men from her army abroad as
part of the United Nations police
force in the Suez.
"Perhaps out of these two blood
sheddings peace will be stronger,"
he said, "because these two cases
proved that any intervention of
!he great powers can cause the
attackers so much damage that it
doesn't pay off | for them to try]
lo solve international problems by
force.
Aranicki would like very much
to see many Stanford students
and other Americans visit Yugo
slavia and enjoy the "famous hos
pitality and extremely interesting
country."
