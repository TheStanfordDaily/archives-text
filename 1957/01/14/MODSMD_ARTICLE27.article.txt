## Experimental Radar Station Installed on Stanford Land 
### 
An experimental radar station with a 61-foot diameter antenna and
100-megacycle transmitter has been installed in the liills west of
earn pus.
The radar station is a Stanford Research Institute project designed
for studies of "upper-atmosphere clutter." This "clutter," due to re-

flection from meteor and auroral'
ionization, continually disrupts I
transmission and reception of j
high frequency signals.
Stanford scientists have been
investigating the problem of at
mospheric clutter since 1915. As
a result operation of Ihe radar
back of campus is presently being
carried out by SHI in co-opera
tion with the Radio Propagation
Lab at the University. Construc
tion was begun last summer.
Last week, another special ra
dar, very similar to the one in
stalled here, was shipped to Alas
ka by the Institute. To be located
near Fairbanks, this second radar
will generate power outputs up
to 60,000 watts in the 200-400-meg
acycle range.
Stanford campus observations
and conclusions will be used to
set up a yardstick for experi
ments in Alaska. The Alaska
project will be carried out in con
junction with the Geophysical In
stitute, University of Alaska, at
the college* near Fairbanks.
The transmitter at the Stanford
radar station is a 50,000-watt FM
broadcasting transmitter modi
fied for pulse transmission. Tt
plus auxiliary equipment is lo
cated in a shelter 40 by 10 feet. '
