# Bear Cagers Dump Ducks, Tie for Lead
## Huskies, UCLA Keep Perfect PCC Marks By Double Victories 
### Bob Payne 
California rolled to its fourth
and fifth straight PCC basketball
victories on the week end by
dumping Oregon twice, while
Washington and UCLA kept their
conference records unblemished
with double wins over Idaho and
Washington State.
In other action, Oregon State
split a pair with Southern Cali
fornia.
The Golden Bears, paced by
I.arry Friend's 19 points, romped
to a 71-57 win over the lowly-rated
Ducks Saturday night, after a
rather unimpressive 53-46 tri
umph on Friday. The young Web
foots, making their first confer
ence start for new coach Steve
Belko, showed inexperience and
almost handed the Bears the first
game.
Friend Cal's Friend
Friend was top scorer for the
series with 35 points, while Ore
gon's Hal Duffy followed with 34.
Washington, paced once again
by Bruno Boin and Doug Smart,
had little trouble in disposing of
Idaho, the same club which had
held IJCLA to-two one-point wins
a week earlier. Smart tanked 20
points in the 77-58 Friday night
victory, while Boin was the big
man Saturday with a 19-point per
formance to lead a 71-49 Huskie
triumph.
31 Straight for IJCLA
UCLA ran its PCC cage win
streak to 31 straight witli a pair
of easy 87-65 and 83-62 victories
over weak Washington State. The
Bruins had sevtfn men in double
figures during the two games,
while the Cougars' fine forward
Larry Beck topped scorers both
nights with 20 points Friday and
22 on Saturday.
USC scored its first victory of
the conference season Friday with
a 55-49 upset of Oregon State, but
was turned back by the Beavers
and big Dave Gambee, 07-52, Sat
urday. Though the 6-7 OSC shot
master was held to two points in
the first game after four quick
fouls, he came back to counter 24
the second night to destroy the
Trojans.
