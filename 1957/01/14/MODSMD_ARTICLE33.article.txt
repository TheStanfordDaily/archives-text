## Taylor: Football Can Be Maintained on Level Of Integrity if Presidents, Faculty Co-operate 
### 
Football coach Chuck Taylor, in a plea for integrity in college
sports, told an alumni conference in Sacramento Saturday night:
"II Stanford were merely interested in making money from sports,
I would suggest we buy the best race horse available and run it
under the Stanford colors. We'd make more money with less trouble.

But thai is not wh;it we're trying
to do."
No Sanction
Taylor specified his speech
was his own impressions and had
no University sanction. lie said
loot ball could be maintained' on
a high level of integrity if college
presidents and faculty co-oper
ated.
"I believe the problem for col
leges is to forget about the other
schools, and control their own
sport on a high level. If other
schools persist in doing some
thing you can't sanction, then it
is your privilege not to schedule
ihem," Taylor maintained.
The 36-year-old coach said the
president and faculty can control
any athletic program and tell the
coach what to do.
"Another Coach"
"If the coach doesn't comply,"
| Taylor emphasized, "they can al
! ways get another coach."
The former Stanford All-Amer
! ican guard urged eliminating
| snap courses for athletes but said
j athletes should not be penalized.
"A friend can help the neigh
! bor's son financially to get a col'-
| lege education, and it is a fine,
i friendly gesture," Taylor said,
I "but if the boy happens to be an
athlete it is professionalism."
