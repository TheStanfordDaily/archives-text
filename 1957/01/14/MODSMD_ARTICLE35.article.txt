# Frosh Beat San Jose JC; Byles Pumps In 14 Points
## Papooses Notch Triumph by Balanced Attack; Aim for Fifth Win Friday in Rattle with Braves 
### Steve Baffrey 
Coach Dick Clegg's freshman
hoop squad can look forward to
Friday's tilt with the Stanford
Braves with an impressive 4-2 rec
ord for play thus far this year.
The frosh posted their fourth win
last Friday when they downed
San Jose Junior College, 68-56.
Leading the attack for the Pa
pooses was guard Mason Byles,
who pumped in 14 counters. Chris
Burford and Jerry Thuesen fol
lowed with 10 and eight points,
respectively, in a game which saw
almost every man on the team
grab one marker or more.
After pushing through the first
points in the game, the frosh were
never headed. Even at the outset
"no contest" signs were clearly
visible.
San Jose's hoopsters did man
age to close the gap at the seven
minute mark in the first period,
when their high scorer, Curtis
Schwartz, brought them within
two points of the frosh, 16-14.
Only Worry
Schwartz appeared to be the
only Stanford worry as he drove
to a game high of 18 points. Be
hind him in San Jose scoring was
a three-way tie between Maurice
Elrod, Armando Moreno and Ron
Wyrsch, each with six counters.
Clegg's starting five were aided

in their play by strong reserves
Ken Balling and Mike Tipton.
Balling was not a starter as had
been expected; 5-7 guard Dick
Thompson started in his place.
Eleven men scored for the frosh,
and 10 members of Ihe learn saw
action in the game.
Playing their first game for
the frosh were John Bwd and
Steve Pentony. Bond reported late
for practice because of his au
tumn quarter football duties, and
Pentony has been described as
possessing "potential."
Worries Over
After leading at half-time. 37-28,
the Stanford men tightened their
defenses in the second half and
stopped Schwartz, while their of
fensive plays opened up new
heights for them. Early in the
period they pulled away io a 49-35
lead.
San Jose bagged an impressive
number of free throws through
out the second stanza, but these
alone were nol enough. The frosh
managed to capture their share
of gratis shots, but boosted their
total with a higher percentage of
field goals.
At 6 p.m. this Friday the frosh
will meet the Stanford JV Braves
in the preliminary to the varsity-
Washington game. Saturday will
find the Papooses tackling Mo
desto JC here at 4 p.m.
