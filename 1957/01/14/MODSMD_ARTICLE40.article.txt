# Speed Traps, Signs Slow Up Panama Street, Lagunita Traffic
## Bumps Inspired by Mrs. Stanford's Traps To Limit 'Horseless Carriages' to 5 mph 
### Steve Deck 
During the Christmas holidays the University Safety Committee
thought up two ways to slow traffic and increase the life span of
students and faculty.
Two areas on campus were in obvious need of a remedy: the east
side of Panama Street and the roads on either side of Lagunita.

Panama Street is divided in
front of Union and the Stanford
Press, with only the west side oi
the one-way street actually paved
and intended for traffic. The east
road is only for access to the elec
tronics research building and to
the parking areas. The Safety
Committee and Chief Gordon R.
Davis of the Stanford police de
partment noticed that motorists
were in the habit of driving along
the east road at high speeds,
which was of great danger to life
and limb of anyone crossing.
Speed Traps
What was needed was a speed
trap. Luckily, someone remem
bered that Mrs. Jane Stanford,
who disliked horseless carriages
and their speed, had installed sev
eral speed traps on campus some
many years ago. As a result,
horseless carriages could not go
faster than five miles an hour.
So several speed traps, in the
form of long humps across the
road, were duly installed on the
east side of Panama Street . Those
with experience will testify that
it is still not advisable to drive
faster than five miles an hour,
since this results in heads being
knocked severely through the top
of the car.
Warning Signs
Signs were placed along the
road warning motorists of the
humps. Signs were subsequently
removed by an anonymous soul
obviously in desperate need of
room decoration. Chief Davis re
quests that the signs be returned
before someone unaware of the
humps drives too fast and loses
control of his car.
The second distress area, the
roads on each side of Lagunita,
suffered from the same problem
of speed. Here the problem was
solved by placing stop signs at
the ends of the roads, making it
once again safe for the Lagunita
girls to venture forth.
