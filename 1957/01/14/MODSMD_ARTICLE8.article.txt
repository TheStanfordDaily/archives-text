# Rushing Moves Into Final Stages; Parties Continue
## 
### 
Pledge classes are being formed
on the Stanford campus as the
1957 rushing season moves into
its final stages.
The 24 fraternity houses con
tinue their party-throwing tonight,
as they work to fill their quota
of pledges. The formal rushing
period, which began last: night,
will run through Thursday night.
Following Thursday night par
ties, the no-contact rule will be in
effect until 5:15 Friday afternoon.
Pledge card signing dinners will
be held Friday night.
Eating clubs will hold their
final open houses tonight. The
scheduled Tuesday open houses
have been cancelled by the seven
groups.
Fraternity and eating club men
are allowed in Wilbur lobbies this
week between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m.
They may visit the rooms of frosh
rushees only between 11:30 a.m.
and 1:30 p.m. and between 5 and
7:30 p.m.
Rushing functions being held
this week by the various houses
include evening and afternoon
parties, buffet and regular din
ners and lunches. Several houses
will also hold mud football games,
weather permitting.


THE IIiDDLN ELEMENTS — Freshman men
visiting at an Alpha Sigma Phi onen house have
just discovered a "closet, case." And out of this
mysterious room are tumbling the "undesir
ables," the men who are carefully hidden all
during rushing for fear they might scare away

prospective pledges. All in fun this picture was
staged but perhaps—if alert freshmen look hard
enough—they just might open the wrong door
at some other house and who knows what they
might find.
