Arthur Shores, the Negro who
won an order getting Autherine
Lucy Foster admitted to the Uni
versity of Alabama last winter.
The city commission and Ihe bus
company were made defendants.
The suit asked for a temporary
injunction blocking a scheduled
city trial Feb. 11 and for a declar
atory judgment and a permanent
injunction forbidding further ar
rests of Negroes who ride unseg
regated.
There were 22 Negroes ar
rested on Dec. 26 but one, a
