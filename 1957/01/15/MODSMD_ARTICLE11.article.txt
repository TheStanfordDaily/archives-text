WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (UP)
The Army today announced a
drastic overhaul of its Reserve
program that will require Nation
al Guardsmen as well as Reserv
ists to take six months' active
military training.
The program, bitterly opposed
by the National Guard Associa
tion, also will reduce the weekly
'h ill obligation of the nation's Re
servists and provide an escape
route from Ihe draft for youths
who elect to enlist in the Re
serves.
The program, which goes into
effect April 1, almost amounts to
a completely new application of
the 1055 Military Reserve Jaw,
which was aimed at building a
2.0 million men Reserve bv 19(50.
