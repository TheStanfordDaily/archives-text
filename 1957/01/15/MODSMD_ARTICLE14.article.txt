## Eisenhower, Benson, Seaton Tour Drought-Stricken States 
### 
EN ROUTE WITH EISENHOWER, Jan. 14 (UP)—President Ei
senhower followed the trail of one of the nation's worst droughts
across Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico today. The trail was
marked by gaunt cattle eating prickly pear, powder-dry soil and
abandoned farms.
Eisenhower is on a 4500-mile plane and automobile tour of Texas,
Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colo i -

rado, Kansas and Arizona. He
stopped at San Angelo, Tex.,
Woodward, Okla., and Clovis,
N.M., today.
He and his party — which in
cludes Secretary of Agriculture
Ezra Taft Benson and Secretary
of the Interior Fred Seaton—will
put up for the night at Tucson,
Ariz.
On the way back East tomor
row, the President will investi
gate conditions around Pueblo,
Colo., Garden City, Kan., and
Wichita, Kan. At stops today, he
took automobile trips into the
countryside to talk to farmers
and ranchers.
Flies Low
Between stops, he had his
plane, the Columbine 111, fly as
low as 1500 feet, so he could get
a general picture of the cold
brown plains and hills.
Eisenhower walked in dust up
to his shoe-tops and saw sand
piled up against fence-rows in ed
dies. The cattle and the sheep he
saw were gaunt from lack of
feed.
Over most of the drought area,
which is in one of the worst dry
weather cycles in the Weather
Bureau's history,* farmers haven't
had a normal year in six to eight
years.
Only Three Crops
At San Angelo, for instance,
farmers told Eisenhower that
they have made only-three crops
in eight years. The last decent
crop they Harvested was in 1950.
Although hard times were
plainly upon the land, the Presi
dent was greeted by thousands
of smiling persons. When he re
turned from his drive outside San
Angelo. the last three miles of the
route to Good fellow Air Force
Base was lined with spectators.
An estimated 10,000 persons
met him at Woodward. The gov
ernor of each state he visited,
state agricultural experts and
other agricultural and ranching
leaders were at each stop to brief
him.
