BUDAPEST, Jan. 15 (UP) â€”
Georgette Chapelle, of Milwau
kee, a 35-year-old photographer
who apparently tried to smuggle
herself into Hungary, is a prison
er of the Communist regime, the
U.S. legation announced today.
An American spokesman said
the government admitted it had
imprisoned Mrs. Chapelle. Com
munist authorities have refused
to release her despite "repeated
representations" by the legation,
the spokesman said.
Her whereabouts had been a
mystery since she left Vienna
Dec. 4. expecting to return in two
or three days. Friends said she
had paid a Hungarian border-run
ner $1000 to guide her into his
country by a safe route.
The official press and radio
said operations were "normal" in
Hungarian miens and factories
today under the new decree
which made strikes and other un
ion agitation against the govern
ment punishable by death.
Radio Budapest said the long
paralyzed mines sot a post-revolt
record by producing 47,720 tons
of coal during the 24 hours that
ended at noon.
It was impossible for Western
correspondents to check on the
official reports. The new decree
makes it a violation of Hungary's
martial law to enter any factory
without official permission.
