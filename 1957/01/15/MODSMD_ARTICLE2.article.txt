# Dulles Cites Mid-East Crisis As 'Most Serious' U.S. Threat
## Secretary Addresses Senate Groups Supporting Ike Proposal to Protect Mid-East Against Reds 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP) â€”Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today the danger of Soviet domination of (tie kiddle East
posed "the most serious threat" to the United States in the past
decade.
Dulles issued his warning at a joint hearing of the Senate Armed

Services and I* oreign Relations
committees on President Eisen
hower's new proposal to use U.S.
troops, if necessary, to protect
Middle Eastern nations against
Red aggression.
Two influential members of the
committees, Senators Richard B.
Russell (D-Ga. I and J. William
Fulbright (D-Ark.), sharply chal
lenged the need for the economic
aid features of the new program.
Senate Democratic Leader Lyn
don B. Johnson (Texas), a mem
ber of the Armed Services Com
mittee, told Dulles that Eisenhow
er's request could be justified
only by the existence of some
"grave danger" to the United
States. He asked what this dan
ger might be.
Serious Threat
"This is the most serious threat
we have faced over the past 10
years," Dulles said deliberately.
He hesitated again, and added:
"The threat, it it led to interna
tional (Communist) control of
the area, would win without open
use of arms an area which has
been endangered but which the
Soviet would not risk open war
to get. I speak of Western Eu
rope.
He said that If Russia obtained
control of the Middle East, the
Communists would "have their
hands on the throttle of the life
blood to Western Europe to cut
off or give as they please."
Under such conditions, Dulles
said, he doubled if t|ie nations of
Western Europe could maintain
their independence.
Renewed Plea
Dulles renewed l.ist week's
plea to the House Foreign Affairs
Committee for quick Congres
sional approval of the President's
plan. He said that "events of the
past few months" have convinced
him that unless Congress ap
proved the new Mid-East doctrine
"the probabilities are that the
area will be lost to international
Communism."
"International Communism
needs a victory," he said. "And
this is the area of the world
where events have played into So
viet hands and could give them a
victory of great magnitude."
He said again then was no evi
dence that Russia was planning
"direct aggression" in the oil-rich
area. But he said there was evi
dence of the "advance of Commu
nism" in the area. And he warned
that the Kremlin "will lake every
risk that they dare to take in
order to win the Middle East."
