# Prints Displayed In Library Today
## 
### 
Print reproductions of famous
paintings will be on exhibit in the
foyer of Main Library today from
8:30 to 11 a.m.
These prints may be borrowed
from the library for a quarter at
a time, and many students have
found this an inexpensive way to
decorate their dorm rooms. .
