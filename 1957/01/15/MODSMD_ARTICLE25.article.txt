# Only a 'Family' Affair

Next Sunday tiif. President of the United
States will be formally inaugurated for his
second term.
The American people elected him to the
nation's highest office. They made the in
auguration ceremony possible bv their votes.
\ et the ceremony this year will be private,
restricted by presidential order to the imme
diate families of President Eisenhower and
Vice-President Nixon.
The next day a public ceremony is planned,
buF it will mean nothing. The President will
already have been sworn in.
White House correspondents have protested
being banned, in a letter to Press Secretary
.lames Hagerty. .The newspaperman's magazine
Editor and Publisher has complained edito
rially. But their protests have been ignored.
The President has an odd definition of pri
vacy. Apparently he doesn't think his weekly
visits to church and almost-weekly vacations
are "private" matters, for they are always
covered by the press.
Of all presidential acts, the inauguration cer
emony is perhaps the most public. To the
American people it is a symbolic climax to the
free voting process by which a President is
elected.
T'.is l test restriction on a supposedly free
press is part of a continuing deterioration of
open press relations with the Eisenhower Ad

ministration. Many of the men in the Admin
istration have business backgrounds. They have
been accustomed to giving the press "handouts"
which include only the material they think
should be made public for the benefit of their
own "good" public relations.
The result has been an increasing amount
of government information falsely labeled
"classified" and withheld from the press and
the people.
Most news that is released is given out to
help the Administration's public relations. No
news from the present Administration most
often means bad news. Truth and the right
to know have often been ignored as criteria.
Eisenhower hasn't held a press conference
since Nov. 14, shortly after his re-election. Now
comes another adront to the AmericanV right
to know, the classification of the presidential
inauguration as "private."
During his first four years in office the Presi
dent had fairly good relations with the press.
But now these relations are taking a turn remi
niscent of the Hoover Administration and the
second terms of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry
Truman.
The people have the right to know—and to
see. The President's duty is to maintain that
right, not ignore it. The nation's press has a
right to attend the inauguration and to report
what it sees there to the people who made that
ceremony possible.

But now these relations are taking a turn remi
niscent of the Hoover Administration and the
second terms of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry
Truman.
The people have the right to know—and to
see. The President's duty is to maintain that
right, not ignore it. The nation's press has a
right to attend the inauguration and to report
what it sees there to the people who made that
ceremony possible.
Next Sunday tiif. President of the United
States will be formally inaugurated for his
second term.
The American people elected him to the
nation's highest office. They made the in
auguration ceremony possible bv their votes.
\ et the ceremony this year will be private,
restricted by presidential order to the imme
diate families of President Eisenhower and
Vice-President Nixon.
The next day a public ceremony is planned,
buF it will mean nothing. The President will
already have been sworn in.
White House correspondents have protested
being banned, in a letter to Press Secretary
.lames Hagerty. .The newspaperman's magazine
Editor and Publisher has complained edito
rially. But their protests have been ignored.
The President has an odd definition of pri
vacy. Apparently he doesn't think his weekly
visits to church and almost-weekly vacations
are "private" matters, for they are always
covered by the press.
Of all presidential acts, the inauguration cer
emony is perhaps the most public. To the
American people it is a symbolic climax to the
free voting process by which a President is
elected.
T'.is l test restriction on a supposedly free
press is part of a continuing deterioration of
open press relations with the Eisenhower Ad

ministration. Many of the men in the Admin
istration have business backgrounds. They have
been accustomed to giving the press "handouts"
which include only the material they think
should be made public for the benefit of their
own "good" public relations.
The result has been an increasing amount
of government information falsely labeled
"classified" and withheld from the press and
the people.
Most news that is released is given out to
help the Administration's public relations. No
news from the present Administration most
often means bad news. Truth and the right
to know have often been ignored as criteria.
Eisenhower hasn't held a press conference
since Nov. 14, shortly after his re-election. Now
comes another adront to the AmericanV right
to know, the classification of the presidential
inauguration as "private."
During his first four years in office the Presi
