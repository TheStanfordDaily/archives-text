At the University of North Carolina, Albert
B. Moore exploded against violations of rules
regulating collcge football. Moore, graduate dean
of the University of Alabama and outgoing presi
dent of the National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion, criticized the recruiting of college athletes
in his address to a college Rotary Club.
"It is high time that college administrators,
athletic authorities and alumni give more serious
attention to the matter of maintaining their ath
letic programs on the same high plane of integ
rity and idealism upon which their other educa
tional programs are maintained.
"It is generally recognized that alumni do
most of the under-the-table dealing to outstand
ing athletes, but it is also known that where
there is much of this sort of thing being done
the coafhing staff knows about it and approves
it. Universities and colleges have dodged behind
alumni long enough."
Several North Carolina schools have been
heavily penalized this year by the NCAA for
football violations.

The Mita Campus, Keio University publica
tion, reports the Hungarian relief activities of
Japanese students. A group called "The Sympa
thetic Confederation of University Students for
the Hungarians" was organized, which sent en
couraging telegrams to the Hungarian govern
ment and to the Hungarian Olympic team.
More than 2500 students from 14 universities
were mobilized in a fund drive, culminating in
a demonstration meeting at Hibiya Park in To
kyo. A total of 33,415 yen was raised and pre
sented to the Red Cross, to be used for Hunga
rian relief.

At the University of North Carolina, Albert
B. Moore exploded against violations of rules
regulating collcge football. Moore, graduate dean
of the University of Alabama and outgoing presi
dent of the National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion, criticized the recruiting of college athletes
in his address to a college Rotary Club.
"It is high time that college administrators,
athletic authorities and alumni give more serious
attention to the matter of maintaining their ath
letic programs on the same high plane of integ
rity and idealism upon which their other educa
tional programs are maintained.
"It is generally recognized that alumni do
most of the under-the-table dealing to outstand
ing athletes, but it is also known that where
there is much of this sort of thing being done
the coafhing staff knows about it and approves
it. Universities and colleges have dodged behind
alumni long enough."
Several North Carolina schools have been
heavily penalized this year by the NCAA for
football violations.
