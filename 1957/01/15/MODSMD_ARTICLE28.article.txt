# CAMPUS OPINION
## Should Stanford Withdraw From the PCC? 
### 
Now that Stanford's president, faculty and
newspaper have had their say on the Pacifie
Coast Conference football hassle, what about its
student body? Do students think Stanford should
withdraw from the PCC if it continues to "liber
alize" its program of aid to athletes?"
Jesus Gonzalez, '59, Sterling Hull: "Yes, if the
PCC program keeps getting liberalized Stanford
will soon lose its academic standing."
Grant Chappell, '59, Delta Tau Delta: "There's
a point you can go to. You can just go so far.
I think the present suggestion that the PCC came
out with is fine. I can't see going much farther
than that."
Caroline Bien, '(JO, Roble Hall: "No, because
intercollegiate sports are an important part of
college life and from what I've read, I understand
that if we drop out of the PCC there will be v no
teams for us to compete with. Thus Stanford
students will lose an important part of their
social unity."
Norman Dunbar, '57, off-campus: "No. Foot
ball is an excellent source of revenue for Stan*
ford. To withdraw could seriously reduce the
amount of income."
Ginger Miller, '58, Storey House: "Yes. Most
of the southern teams have money to buy play
ers and there would be no point in competing.
The spirit of the sport would be lost. If the PCC
does allow money payments, all the teams should
go professional and Stanford should withdraw.
Stanford shouldn't put sports ahead of academics,
because Stanford prides itself on its educational
facilities."
George Tsongas, '59, Stern Hull: "No, if the
program is liberalized only moderately. If the
program came to the point that we were paying
players almost anything they asked just to keep
them, then we should drop from the PCC.
Changes which are not drastic will not hurt us
serioulsy."
Brute Busching, '58, Wilbur Hall: "It's hard
to say without knowing the specific rules in
volved, but generally I'm, very much against
professionalism in college sports. If the PCC
goes too far, I would be for withdrawing."
Mike Stanislawski, '58, Terman Hall: "There
would be no need for Stanford to withdraw if it
would quit charging admission to games. Should
this be done it would automatically exclude
sports scholarships and would in fact limit Stan

ford to itnramural sports. Reed College (in Ore
gon) has one this successfully for many years.
We should use the money now going to sports
scholarships for academic scholarships."
Harlan Limmer, '<>0. Wilbur Hull: "No, the
aid will enable the poorer student with good
grades and athletic ability to obtain a Stanford
education and Stanford will benefit by better
football teams."
Brian Wickland, '58, Stern Hall: "Although
it would probably entail a considerable decrease
in her revenue, Stanford's withrawal from the
present liberally inclined PCC would be consist
ent with her traditional standards of goo taste,
and in opposition to the cheap- commercialism
of our culture which has even invaded the field
of athletics."
Bob Cuhill, '59, Stern Hull: "I'm not in favor
of any more liberalization. However, I would not
advocate pulling out unless it threatened to make
football more of a professional sport than one of
amateur athletics."
Gr«'g Juckson, '58, Deltu Kuppa Epsilon: "I
don't see anything wrong with liberalizing. Ei
ther we do it, too, to keep our team up to par
and play other conference teams, or do not do
it and play with independent teams. Actually,
de-emphasizing football is a good idea."
Merritt llait, '59, Deltu Tau Deltu: "I think
that everything should lie done to refrain from
that kind of action, but if it would cause us to
back down on policies that we think are best
for Stanford students and the reputation of the
school, it should be done."
Ned Bulkey, '59, Delta Kappa Epsilon: "I
think that Stanford is light in acting the way it
has in regard to the present situation of the PCC.
However, it appears that we are the lone wolf
in the crowd and our individuality is liable to lose
us valuable financial support. Thus if the PCC
wants to go professional we should too and de
clare it openly."
Jerry Gins/burg, '59, Stern: "This [golting out
of the PCC | is something which will be pretty
hard to avoid. I think it can be reconcile with
out conceding to either side. If it comes to a mat
ter of choice, I think the present academic stand
ards should be maintained."
Larry Turner, '59, Delta Kappa Epsilon: "Yes.
We should drop out of the PCC if athletes be
come paid and academic requirements are low
ered. I want college football, not pro ball."

it and play with independent teams. Actually,
de-emphasizing football is a good idea."
Merritt llait, '59, Deltu Tau Deltu: "I think
that everything should lie done to refrain from
that kind of action, but if it would cause us to
back down on policies that we think are best
for Stanford students and the reputation of the
school, it should be done."
Ned Bulkey, '59, Delta Kappa Epsilon: "I
think that Stanford is light in acting the way it
has in regard to the present situation of the PCC.
However, it appears that we are the lone wolf
in the crowd and our individuality is liable to lose
us valuable financial support. Thus if the PCC
wants to go professional we should too and de
clare it openly."
Jerry Gins/burg, '59, Stern: "This [golting out
of the PCC | is something which will be pretty
hard to avoid. I think it can be reconcile with
out conceding to either side. If it comes to a mat
ter of choice, I think the present academic stand
ards should be maintained."
Larry Turner, '59, Delta Kappa Epsilon: "Yes.
We should drop out of the PCC if athletes be
come paid and academic requirements are low
ered. I want college football, not pro ball."
Now that Stanford's president, faculty and
newspaper have had their say on the Pacifie
Coast Conference football hassle, what about its
student body? Do students think Stanford should
withdraw from the PCC if it continues to "liber
alize" its program of aid to athletes?"
Jesus Gonzalez, '59, Sterling Hull: "Yes, if the
PCC program keeps getting liberalized Stanford
will soon lose its academic standing."
Grant Chappell, '59, Delta Tau Delta: "There's
a point you can go to. You can just go so far.
I think the present suggestion that the PCC came
out with is fine. I can't see going much farther
than that."
Caroline Bien, '(JO, Roble Hall: "No, because
intercollegiate sports are an important part of
college life and from what I've read, I understand
that if we drop out of the PCC there will be v no
teams for us to compete with. Thus Stanford
students will lose an important part of their
social unity."
Norman Dunbar, '57, off-campus: "No. Foot
ball is an excellent source of revenue for Stan*
ford. To withdraw could seriously reduce the
amount of income."
Ginger Miller, '58, Storey House: "Yes. Most
of the southern teams have money to buy play
ers and there would be no point in competing.
The spirit of the sport would be lost. If the PCC
does allow money payments, all the teams should
go professional and Stanford should withdraw.
Stanford shouldn't put sports ahead of academics,
because Stanford prides itself on its educational
facilities."
George Tsongas, '59, Stern Hull: "No, if the
program is liberalized only moderately. If the
program came to the point that we were paying
players almost anything they asked just to keep
them, then we should drop from the PCC.
Changes which are not drastic will not hurt us
serioulsy."
Brute Busching, '58, Wilbur Hall: "It's hard
to say without knowing the specific rules in
volved, but generally I'm, very much against
professionalism in college sports. If the PCC
goes too far, I would be for withdrawing."
Mike Stanislawski, '58, Terman Hall: "There
would be no need for Stanford to withdraw if it
would quit charging admission to games. Should
this be done it would automatically exclude
sports scholarships and would in fact limit Stan

ford to itnramural sports. Reed College (in Ore
gon) has one this successfully for many years.
We should use the money now going to sports
scholarships for academic scholarships."
Harlan Limmer, '<>0. Wilbur Hull: "No, the
aid will enable the poorer student with good
grades and athletic ability to obtain a Stanford
education and Stanford will benefit by better
football teams."
Brian Wickland, '58, Stern Hall: "Although
it would probably entail a considerable decrease
in her revenue, Stanford's withrawal from the
present liberally inclined PCC would be consist
ent with her traditional standards of goo taste,
and in opposition to the cheap- commercialism
of our culture which has even invaded the field
of athletics."
Bob Cuhill, '59, Stern Hull: "I'm not in favor
of any more liberalization. However, I would not
advocate pulling out unless it threatened to make
football more of a professional sport than one of
amateur athletics."
Gr«'g Juckson, '58, Deltu Kuppa Epsilon: "I

would quit charging admission to games. Should
this be done it would automatically exclude
sports scholarships and would in fact limit Stan

ford to itnramural sports. Reed College (in Ore
gon) has one this successfully for many years.
We should use the money now going to sports
scholarships for academic scholarships."
Harlan Limmer, '<>0. Wilbur Hull: "No, the
aid will enable the poorer student with good
grades and athletic ability to obtain a Stanford
education and Stanford will benefit by better
football teams."
Brian Wickland, '58, Stern Hall: "Although
it would probably entail a considerable decrease
in her revenue, Stanford's withrawal from the
present liberally inclined PCC would be consist
ent with her traditional standards of goo taste,
and in opposition to the cheap- commercialism
of our culture which has even invaded the field
of athletics."
Bob Cuhill, '59, Stern Hull: "I'm not in favor
of any more liberalization. However, I would not
advocate pulling out unless it threatened to make
football more of a professional sport than one of
amateur athletics."
Gr«'g Juckson, '58, Deltu Kuppa Epsilon: "I
don't see anything wrong with liberalizing. Ei
ther we do it, too, to keep our team up to par
and play other conference teams, or do not do
it and play with independent teams. Actually,
de-emphasizing football is a good idea."
Merritt llait, '59, Deltu Tau Deltu: "I think
that everything should lie done to refrain from
that kind of action, but if it would cause us to
back down on policies that we think are best
for Stanford students and the reputation of the
school, it should be done."
Ned Bulkey, '59, Delta Kappa Epsilon: "I
think that Stanford is light in acting the way it
has in regard to the present situation of the PCC.
However, it appears that we are the lone wolf
in the crowd and our individuality is liable to lose
us valuable financial support. Thus if the PCC
wants to go professional we should too and de
clare it openly."
Jerry Gins/burg, '59, Stern: "This [golting out
of the PCC | is something which will be pretty
hard to avoid. I think it can be reconcile with
out conceding to either side. If it comes to a mat
ter of choice, I think the present academic stand
ards should be maintained."
Larry Turner, '59, Delta Kappa Epsilon: "Yes.
We should drop out of the PCC if athletes be
come paid and academic requirements are low
ered. I want college football, not pro ball."
Now that Stanford's president, faculty and
newspaper have had their say on the Pacifie
Coast Conference football hassle, what about its
student body? Do students think Stanford should
withdraw from the PCC if it continues to "liber
alize" its program of aid to athletes?"
Jesus Gonzalez, '59, Sterling Hull: "Yes, if the
PCC program keeps getting liberalized Stanford
will soon lose its academic standing."
Grant Chappell, '59, Delta Tau Delta: "There's
a point you can go to. You can just go so far.
I think the present suggestion that the PCC came
out with is fine. I can't see going much farther
than that."
Caroline Bien, '(JO, Roble Hall: "No, because
intercollegiate sports are an important part of
college life and from what I've read, I understand
that if we drop out of the PCC there will be v no
teams for us to compete with. Thus Stanford
students will lose an important part of their
social unity."
Norman Dunbar, '57, off-campus: "No. Foot
ball is an excellent source of revenue for Stan*
ford. To withdraw could seriously reduce the
amount of income."
Ginger Miller, '58, Storey House: "Yes. Most
of the southern teams have money to buy play
ers and there would be no point in competing.
The spirit of the sport would be lost. If the PCC
does allow money payments, all the teams should
go professional and Stanford should withdraw.
Stanford shouldn't put sports ahead of academics,
because Stanford prides itself on its educational
facilities."
George Tsongas, '59, Stern Hull: "No, if the
program is liberalized only moderately. If the
program came to the point that we were paying
players almost anything they asked just to keep
them, then we should drop from the PCC.
Changes which are not drastic will not hurt us
serioulsy."
Brute Busching, '58, Wilbur Hall: "It's hard
to say without knowing the specific rules in
volved, but generally I'm, very much against
professionalism in college sports. If the PCC
goes too far, I would be for withdrawing."
