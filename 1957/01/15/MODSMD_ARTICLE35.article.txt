# The 						Point After

### Dean Stewart 
There was just one thing wrong with the exciting show the Stan
ford boxing team put on in the Pavilion last Thursday night only a
handful of spectators turned out to watch ihe performance.
It seems a shame that so much work and talent should be wasted
on so few. But that's the way it is with boxing here on the Farm.
It's a dying sport.
A few days before Thursday's matches I went over to the gym
to gather some data on the team from its coach, Ray Lunny. Our
conversation went something like this:
"What schools will the team be meeting this year, Coach?"
"Well, we meet Santa Clara, Chico State, and Oal twice."
"Just four meets? Is that all?"
"That's right," said Lunny. "So many schools have.been going
big time that I've had to drop them from the schedule. There's no
sense in scheduling schools when all but one or two of the bouts
will be complete mis-matches."
Still not convinced I said, "But what about Cal Poly. We used
to meet them, didn't we?"
"Yeah, we did, but I had to drop them this year. They've simply
gotten out of our class."
It was hard to believe. Little Cal Poly, out of our class. Remem
bering the filled Pavilion that used to witness boxing matches just
five years ago, I had to see for myself.
Thursday night I showed up for the tournament. Ten minutes
before the first bout one could have parked in the Pavilion drive
way inside it was practically deserted. It seemed as if there were
as many student guards as spectators.
What with all the controversy about professionalism in college
athletics, it seems that the hoxing situation here at Stanford is
worth reflecting upon. Boxing at the Farm is strictly amateur
and yet it is dying. Why?
If boxing were not the exciting competitive sport that it is, the
Stanford student body's lack of enthusiasm would be understandable.
But the truth of the matter is that boxing is one of America's favor
ite sports.
Advertisers know the wide interest in boxing and spend millions
each year televising the sport, knowing full well that millions will
be watching. And yet professional fights are often not nearly as
exciting as the amateur bouts that took place in the Pavilion.
Other colleges turn out in large numbers to watch boxing. Mil
lions watch it on TV or pay to see ft. Stanford students used to
watch it. In short, boxing is normally a good spectator sport. But
not at Stanford any more.
If Stanford is going to completely de-emphasize sports, as they
have been considering, perhaps they would be wise to study the
boxing situation first. Boxing at Stanford is strictly amateur
.and normally a good spectator sport. Both traits would be deemed
desirable by any athletic department seeking de-emphasi/ation.
II our other sports football, basketball, track, etc.â€”when ama
teurized, follow the same course as boxing which is already pure,
then floes it follow that the same spectator apathy will result? And
what about competition?
One ray of light emerged from our conversation with Coach
Lunny. Noticing that the name "Jim Bryer" was scheduled for the
heavyweight bout with California and then crossed out, I asked
Lunny about it.
"That's sort of a funny story," said Lunny. "Jim came in one
day and said, 'I hear you don't have anyone to fight heavyweight.'
I told him ! didn't, and I didn't at the time, so he said he'd done
a little boxing and would like to give it a try.
"Naturally I didn't turn him down. He worked out a few times
and looked real good, too. But he had some bridge work in his teeth
he was concerned about so I told him to have his dentist check it
and see if it was okay for boxing.
"His dentist told him it would be better if he didn't box so that's
why he's been scratched from ihe card. But I thought it was real
nice on Jim's part to come in like that."
Noticing that Bryer played football, I couldn't help but wonder
if he was going to Stanford on one of those athletic scholarships
that tend to professionalize alhletics so that they only play for pay.
If he is it certainly didn't hurt his competitive spirit.
Stanford and the entire sports world could learn from Bryer's
"boxing lesson." If more people would take his can-I-help? attitude
instead of let's-kill-it-while-it's-down attitude, perhaps a great deal
more could be done to help athletics.
C ompetitive sports are worth saving, but is de-emphasis the
solution? Before you answer in the affirmative, remember the
Stanford boxing situation. It's a completely de-emphasized, strictly
amateur, dying sport.
