# Weekend Series Will See Huskies Fighting for Top
## Washington Now in Second Place With UCLA; Win Would Boost Them Over Idle Californians 
### 
Washington's youthful and talented Huskies invade Stanford this
weekend for a two-game series that figures to make or break the
Card cagers.
A double win for Washington would practically eliminate the In
dians from the conference title race, while giving the Huskies at
least a tie for the league top spot, i

Currently, Coach Tippy Dye's
five is undefeated in four loop
contests, ranking with UCLA
behind California. The. Golden
Bears are idle this week, leaving
the way open for the Huskies and
Bruins to move into first place.
Dye has only Iwo seniors, both
reserves, on his '57 squad and the
current Husky frosh are tabbed
as "great." Pacing the attack all
season for the Seattleites has
: been the terrible tandem of 6-9
I junior center Bruno Boiii and C>-7
I sophomore forward Doug Smart.
This skyscraping pair have alter
; nated in annihilating Husky op
! ponents in their four league
clashes.
Stanford's cagers returned to
the courts yesterday after a five
! day layoff since last Tuesday's
California game. Coach Howie
Dallmar hopes to find a remedy
for the "coolness" shown by Card
shooters in Berkeley. Brightest
spot, and perhaps the only bright
! one, was sophomore Dick Haga's
1 18-point performance against the
j Bears.
Washington flexed its muscles
last weekend with two smashing
victories over a scrappy Idaho
team. A week earlier, the Van
dals had narrowly missed two up
set wins over UCLA, losing both
times by one point.
Game lime for the Washington
series is 8:30 p.m. In what fig
ures to be an exciting prelimi
nary, the Stanford frosh will
meet the Braves at 6 p.m. on Fri
day.
