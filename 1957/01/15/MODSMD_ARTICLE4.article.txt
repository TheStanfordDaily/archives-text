# Two Candidates For Knowland's Seat Are Alumni
## 
### 
The two most likely candidates
to fill the vacancy left hy Repub
lican Senator William Knowland's
resignation at the end of his term
in 1958 are both Stanford gradu
ates.
Alan Cranston and Robert. Kirk-
Wbod, who have been active in
California politics for years, are
both "highly qualified" for the
position, according to Alfred De-
Grazia, associate professor of po
litical science at Stanford.
Cranston, who is credited with
having rebuilt the Democratic
party in California "from the
ground up," was graduated from
Stanford in 1936 with an A.B. in
English.
Republican Kirkwood was grad
uated in 1930 with an A.B. in eco
nomics. "His strongest appeal will
be his diligent work in elective
office in California," DeGrazia
said. Kirkwood is now state con
troller.
Both men have spoken at Stan
ford at political rallies and re
unions several times. They are
aligned with liberal wings of their
respective parties concerning for
eign and domestic issues.
