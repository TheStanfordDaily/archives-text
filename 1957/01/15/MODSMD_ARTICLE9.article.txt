## Eleven-Month Fight Brings to Close Top Box Office Career 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 14 (UP) —
Humphrey Bogart, after saying
with a premonition, "Good-bye,
kid," to wife Lauren Bacall, died
early today at his home following
an 11-month battle against cancer.
The Oscar-winning movie tough
guy, 57, for months optimistically
told his doctors he felt sure he
could lick his dread ailment that
was revealed when he was oper
ated on for cancer of the esopha
gus last March.
The sardonic, balding actor had
battled cancer with the same
toughness he applied to his movie
roles for 25 years from"The Pet
rified Forest" to his last, "The
Harder They Fall."
Radiation Treatments
After his operation he took ra
diation treatments at Los Angeles
Tumor Institute which caused
him to lose 50 pounds, he recently
said. Last month he entered St.
John's Hospital for removal of
scar tissue in the hope his appe
tite would improve and the pain
lessen. He returned to his home
after a week, but never regained
the lost weight.
Bogart was a top box-office star
for- near ly 20 years. He won an
Academy award for "The African
Queen" in 1951 and three other
nominations—for "Casablanca" in
1943, "Treasure of the Sierra Ma
dre" in 1947 and"The Caine Mu
tiny" in 1954.
Off-Stage
But the colorful, uninhibited
Bogart was equally well known
for his off-stage behavior. In 1949
he was hauled into court in New
York for flooring a girl who tried
to take a toy panda fr om him. He
was fond of blasting anything and
everybody, from the press to the
new "method" school of acting.
Bogart was born Dec. 25, 1899,
in New York city, the son of sur
geon Belmont Bogart and artist
Maude Humphrey. As a wealthy
youth he tried Wall Street, but
jvound up acting on the stage. His
role in "The Petrified Forest" in
1932 was repeated in films, and he
became a screen star.
