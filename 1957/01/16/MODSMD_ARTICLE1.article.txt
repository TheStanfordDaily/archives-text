# Medical Research Center Added to Industrial Park
## Beckman Instruments Opens New Building For Scientific Study of Polio, Heart Ailments 
### 
A $.>OO,OOO research and development center was unveiled Monday
in Stanford Industrial Park.
I he building is part of the Spinco Division, Beekman Instruments
Incorporated, it can accommodate 100 men working on the discovery
of new instruments for the study of cancer, viruses, polio, heart
I ailments and other infectious dis*

eases.
An additional building is plan
ned within the next several
months for research in electronics.
Formal Unveiling;
The formal unveiling, which
came after the building had been
in operation for a month, marks
■<i total investment by Beekman
in the area of nearly $10 million.
Beekman operates several other
facilities in the area, including the
Shock ley Semiconductor Labora
tory in Mountain View and the
Spinco Division manufacturing
plant in Belmont.
Dr. William Shockley, one of
three Americans who won the
1956 Nobel Prize in Physics, is
head of the Beekman Laboratories
in Mountain View and will be in
charge of the transistor research
program in Stanford Industrial
Park.
Expansion'
The research center covers 33,-
000 square feel. Plans are being
made to expand it eventually to
100,000 square feet, room enough
for a staff of 500.
Research in the new building
will expand a program that has
already produced, among other
medical developments, the optical
ultracentrifuge, an instrument
which helped scientists to isolate
polio virus.
