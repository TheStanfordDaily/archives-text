# Ike to Present Congress With Record Budget
## Government Enabled To Operate in Black If Tax Cut Foregone 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP)
â€”President Eisenhower will lay
before Congress tomorrow a rec
ord peacetime spending budget
calling for an outlay of about $72
billion for defense, foreign aid
and home front needs.
Despite its size, well-informed
sources said, tho budget will en
able the government to operate
in the black in the fiscal year be
ginning next July 1 with an indi
cated surplus of about $1.7 bil
lion.
This will be possible, however,
only if Congress agrees to forego
a general tax cut and to extend
excise and corporation tax levies
that are scheduled to drop on
April 1.
Priority List
Eisenhower and Republican
Congressional leaders have
placed legislation to continue
current excise and corporation
tax rates on their priority list.
Administration sources have in
dicated, however, that the Presi
dent probably would go along
with a move to provide some tax
relief for small businesses now in
the pinch of the tight money mar
ket.
Increased military spending
will account for most of the in
crease in the fiscal 1958 budget.
This item is expected to top $38
billion, a jump of about $2 billion
over defense spending in the cur
rent fiscal year.
Legislation
Eisenhower also will spell out
in his budget message a series of
domestic legislative proposals. He
chose to use the budget as a legis
lative vehicle this year rather
than outline his program in the
State of the Union message,
which he delivered last week.
Key members of Congress ex
pect the President to press for ac
tion this year on such measures
as his school construction pro
gram, a postal rate increase to
reduce the post office deficit and
possibly his civil rights program.
All were left hanging last session.
A $72 billion budget would be
tho highest since the end of
World War II except in fiscal
1953 when the Korean war was in
progress. But the administration
is counting on the booming econ
omy to increase the tax yield
enough to take care of the extra
spending.
