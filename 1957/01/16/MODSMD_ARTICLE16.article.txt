# Ike to Ask Congress to Aid Drought-Stricken Great Plains
## President Urges That $76 Million Be Spent On Assistance Loans, Agricultural Conservation 
### 
WICHITA, Kan., Jan. 15 (UP)—President Eisenhower, ending a
4500-mile tour of the drought-stricken Southern Great Plains, an
nounced tonight that he will ask Congress to spend $76 million
on drought relief.
The President told a special drought conference of representatives

from 15 Western, Midwestern and
Southwestern states that he will
ask Congress to:
• Let him spend $25 million ,
from the Disaster Loan Revolv
ing Fund for emergency feed as
sistance to ranchers and farmers.
• Extend, until June 30, 1958,
$25 million of the unobligated
funds appropriated for agricultu
ral conservation, so Secretary of
Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson can
pay farmers to carry out wind
erosion and other emergency con
servation measures.
• Appropriate an additional
$26 million primarily for refi
nancing farm indebtedness by di
rect loans.
Eisenhower told the delegates
to the conference that the West
ern Railway Association has
agreed to continue until March 31
a 50 per cent reduction in freight
rates on hay in drought areas.
The rate reduction period was
scheduled to expire today. Exten
sion of the reduction was one
point many drought sufferers
told the President they needed.
The President, who started a
tour of the drought - stricken
Great Plains Sunday, investi
gated conditions in Colorado and
Kansas, the state in which he was
reared, today as he flew eastward
toward Washington, D.C. He got
as far west as Tucson. Ariz.
Agricultural experts warned
him today that a monumental
drought has laid millions of acres
open to ravishment by dust
storms and left farmers and
ranchers in critical financial con
dition.
The Colorado drought commit
tee reported that many ranchers
have run out of credit and the
cattle they are trying desperately
to hold on to are not. worth the
subsidized feed that they have
eaten.
When Eisenhower r cached
Kansas, an Agricultural Exten
sion Service report warned him
that the spring winds are likely
to strip the soil from more than
10 million acres of crop and
rangeland, unless it rains.
The Kansans complained that
the emergency feed prog r a m
needs to be two or three times
bigger than it is. They said their
state has h;id less rain in the last
five years than in any five years
since the Weather Bureau started
keeping records 70 years ago.

gated conditions in Colorado and
Kansas, the state in which he was

him today that a monumental
drought has laid millions of acres
open to ravishment by dust
storms and left farmers and
ranchers in critical financial con
dition.
The Colorado drought commit

have run out of credit and the
cattle they are trying desperately
to hold on to are not. worth the
subsidized feed that they have
eaten.

sion Service report warned him
that the spring winds are likely
to strip the soil from more than
10 million acres of crop and
rangeland, unless it rains.
The Kansans complained that
the emergency feed prog r a m
needs to be two or three times
bigger than it is. They said their

five years than in any five years
since the Weather Bureau started
keeping records 70 years ago.
