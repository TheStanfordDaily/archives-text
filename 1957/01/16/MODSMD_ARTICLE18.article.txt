# Texas Demo Is Named to Fill Senate Vacancy
## 
### 
AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 15 (UPâ€”
Retiring Governor Allan Shivers
appointed William Blakley, a mil
lionaire Dallas lawyer and finan
cier, today to the crucial U.S.
Senate seat vacated by Price Dan
iel. The appointment apparently
means continued Democratic con
trol of the Senate.
Daniel had to vacate the Senate
seat at midnight Monday so he
could be sworn in at noon today
as the 38th governor of Texas.
Shivers, who is an ardent Eisen
hower supporter, appointed Blak
ley, 58, less than two hours before
his term expired.
If Shivers had appointed a Re
publican, it would have meant a
48-18 tie in Senate voting, which
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon
could have broken in favor of the
Republicans.
Blakley said he is "a lifelong
Democrat and has no intentions
of being anything else," and Sen
ate Democratic Leader Lyndon
Johnson of Texas said Blakley
will vote as a Democrat. Blakley
refused to say how he would vote
if he had to vote today.
He kept, saying, "I will vote
when it comes time to vote," but
he would follow this with a re
mark such as "Remember, I am a
lifelong Democrat and have no
intention of being anything else."
He said he voted for Eisenhow
er in 1952 and 1956, but when
newsmen asked whether his gen
eral party affiliation could be
used as a guide to his conduct in
the Senate, he said, "I think it
can."
