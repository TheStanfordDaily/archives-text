# Dulles: War Not Likely If Ike Doctrine Passed
## Demos Skeptical Of Request for Standby Power 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today the chance of
U.S. fighting in the Middle East
would be "very much less" than
50-50 if Congress approved the
Eisenhower Doctrine.
"If this resolution passes," he
said, "there is very little likeli
hood" that American troops will
have to go to war in the crisis
ridden area.
But Dulles said there is "very
great likelihood" that U.S. troop's
will have to fight in the Middle
East if Congress fails to grant
the President's request.
The Secretary made the state
ments in his second day-long ap
pearance before a joint hearing
of the Senate Foreign Relations
and Armed Services committees
on the proposed economic and
military aid features of the reso
lution.
Skeptical
Congressional Democrats have
been openly skeptical of Eisen
hower's request for standby au
thority to employ U.S. troops to
block Communist aggression in
the area if necessary.
Senator Mike Mansfield (D-
Mont.) asked Dulles if the admin
istration had given any thought
to negotiating with Russia on a
Middle East policy.
"Thought, yes," Dulles replied.
"Just thought?" Mansfield
asked.
"Yes," Dulles answered.
Asked if the Middle East coun
tries faced a threat of "overt So
viet attack," Dulles said, "I think
they do face that danger, yes."
Mansfield questioned how the
United States could justify in
creased commitments abroad in
view of planned reductions in
manpower of the armed forces.
Peak Strength
Dulles said that U.S. military
strength "is at its peak" and that
it is possible to reduce manpower
as the power of weapons in
creases. "There is no more illu
sory test of strength than man
power," he said.
Senator Estes Kefauver (D-
Tenn.) asked Dulles if Congress
would be called on to declare war
if there is substantial conflict in
the Middle East."
State of War
Dulles replied that "if there
were hostilities of a major char
acter," Congress probably would
be asked to "declare that a state
of war exists." .
Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland (Calif.) said he
was prepared to support Eisen
hower's request for authority to
use troops in the Middle East. But
he objected to language in the
resolution which would send U.S.
armed forces into any Middle
East nation "requesting such aid
against overt armed aggression."
Dulles said, "I don't think we
can act to help protect a country
unless it wants to be protected."
But he added, ."We can act in
our own interest."

sory test of strength than man
power," he said.
Senator Estes Kefauver (D-
Tenn.) asked Dulles if Congress
would be called on to declare war
if there is substantial conflict in
the Middle East."
State of War
Dulles replied that "if there
were hostilities of a major char
acter," Congress probably would
be asked to "declare that a state
of war exists." .
Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland (Calif.) said he
was prepared to support Eisen
hower's request for authority to
use troops in the Middle East. But
he objected to language in the
resolution which would send U.S.
armed forces into any Middle
East nation "requesting such aid
against overt armed aggression."
Dulles said, "I don't think we
can act to help protect a country
unless it wants to be protected."
But he added, ."We can act in
our own interest."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today the chance of
U.S. fighting in the Middle East
would be "very much less" than
50-50 if Congress approved the
Eisenhower Doctrine.
"If this resolution passes," he
said, "there is very little likeli
hood" that American troops will
have to go to war in the crisis
ridden area.
But Dulles said there is "very
great likelihood" that U.S. troop's
will have to fight in the Middle
East if Congress fails to grant
the President's request.
The Secretary made the state
ments in his second day-long ap
pearance before a joint hearing
of the Senate Foreign Relations
and Armed Services committees
on the proposed economic and
military aid features of the reso
lution.
Skeptical
Congressional Democrats have
been openly skeptical of Eisen
hower's request for standby au
thority to employ U.S. troops to
block Communist aggression in
the area if necessary.
Senator Mike Mansfield (D-
Mont.) asked Dulles if the admin
istration had given any thought
to negotiating with Russia on a
Middle East policy.
"Thought, yes," Dulles replied.
"Just thought?" Mansfield
asked.
"Yes," Dulles answered.
Asked if the Middle East coun
tries faced a threat of "overt So
viet attack," Dulles said, "I think
they do face that danger, yes."
Mansfield questioned how the
United States could justify in
creased commitments abroad in
view of planned reductions in
manpower of the armed forces.
Peak Strength
Dulles said that U.S. military
strength "is at its peak" and that
it is possible to reduce manpower
as the power of weapons in
creases. "There is no more illu
sory test of strength than man
power," he said.
Senator Estes Kefauver (D-
