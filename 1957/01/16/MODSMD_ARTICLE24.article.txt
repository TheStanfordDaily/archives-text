# No 'Dancing in the Aisles'
## 
### 
To THOSF. WHO IIAVF. seen the elaborate motif
of San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House,
jazz ringing from the rafters might seem a
little incongruous. But it is appealing.
Evidently the directors of the Opera House
don't see the appeal, for they recently refused
use of the building to a group of touring jazz
artists which included Count Basie and his
band and singers Billy Eckstine and Sarah
Yaughan.
The door was similarly slammed last week
on Dizzie Gillespie by the directors of the
nearby Veterans Building.
The Opera House is said to be too fancv for
"dancing in the aisles."
The general manager ot the Veterans Build
ing reasoned that if jazz seeps its way into the
vets" building, "then pretty soon it'll be rock
and roll. * He hastened to admit, though, that
he didn't really know the difference between

rock and roll and "these other types" and had
never heard of Dizzie Gillespie, who has just
finished an engagement at Carnegie Hall.
For some reason, many Americans still look
upon jazz as the art of crazed jungle-tribal
dancers, rather than as a truly unique cultural
contribution.
They equate any loud, off-beat noise with
jazz. They tremble at the thought of sending
jazz artists abroad for fear they represent some
diseased aspect of American society.
But strangely enough, Europe has adopted
jazz with wild enthusiasm. In fact, Europeans
seem to appreciate this country's rich jazz
heritage to a far greater degree than many
musically-inclined Americansâ€”or at least so it
wo uld seem from the run-around that jazz got
this past week in San Francisco.
Why shouldn't jazz have its chance at the
Opera House and the Veterans Building?
