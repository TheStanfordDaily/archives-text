'Necessary Evil*
Editor's Note: The letter printed below per
tains to a statement made by ASSU Foreign
Scholar Alexander Aranicki in an interview in
Monday's Daily. The Yugoslav scholar said, in
reference to the Hungarian crisis, "in this case,
perhaps, the intervention of the Soviet forces
was necessary as a 'necessary evil'."
Editor, The Daily:
We wish t'i. Thank Alexander Aranicki for his
statements c ""ying the situation that existed
in J T *ary. But we are still confused as to one
sm 'l m ter. The Communist Manifesto declares
tha. munism's ends can be attained only by
a "forcible overthrow of all existing social con
ditions." We understand that Hungary was en
joying a workers' government, so why the work
ers should revolt against themselves puzzles us.
Obviously the workers could not revolt against
themselves, so there must have been another rea
son.
Have those rascals from Wall Street tunneled

to Budapest where they incited the schoolchil
dren to riot? Or was the problem overpopula
tion, and did those dear, brave young people com
mit mass suicide so that others might survive?
A saintly act, and not unrecognized. And al
though we were troubled somewhat by the de
struction in Budapest we have it on good author
ity that this was merely the razing which pre
ceded a new public park for the use of the work
ers. Wonderful progress, truly wonderful.
Oh, yes, one other thing. We do not under
stand certain rumors of Russian tanks in Hun
gary. Were they merely out on night maneuvers
and made a wrong turn? For certainly, if there
really was a revolution in Hungary, every good
Russian and Yugoslav who had the courage of
his convictions would have spared no pains to
assist the revolution, for "the proletarians have
nothing to lose but their chains. They have a
world to win."
