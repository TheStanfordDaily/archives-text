## 
### 
Three high school teachers
from Finland and one from Bel
gium arrived on Stanford's cam
pus yesterday to visit Hoover
Tower and Library.
All are on six months Fulbright
scholarships under the auspices
of the United States Health, Edu
cation and Welfare Department.
For nine weeks they studied
about America at the University
of Pennsylvania and now are
touring the country.
Side Trip
Stanford was a side trip for
the four. "We heard it was the
most beautiful campus in Amer
ica so we wanted to see it," com
mented Miss Lauri Karttunen, a
language teacher in Liperi, Fin
land.
The four teachers are observ
ing U.S. schools'and have found
several differences, mainly in our
more competitive system.
Pupils go eight years to ele
mentary schools if they don't
plan to continue their education,
explained Miss Inkeri Ellonen,
who teaches languages in a school
at Lappeenranta, Finland, other
wise, they go lour years and then
take examinations for secondary
school.
Students study for eight years
in these secondary schools and
are charged a nominal fee. Every
year they are required to pass ex
aminations before moving up to
the next grade/added Ir.ja Kaske
naiu, English and grammar teach
er from Helsinki, Finland.
Examinations
After students complete this
schooling, they are ready to take
graduation examinations. Miss
Ellomen said pupils who pass are
automatically eligible It) enter
one of Finland's universities.
Compulsory languages taught
in the Finnish high schools are
Swedish, Latin and either Eng
lish or German. Most of the
schools are coeducational.
"Physical education is very im
portant in Finland and is taught
in every grade," added Miss Kart
tunen.
Joseph Mertens from Malines,
Belgium, explained the Belgian

school system is. very similar
to the Finnish one. Examina
tions are given every year there
also hut elementary school lasts
for six years. Major difference is
that French, English and Merman
are taught, being the languages
spoken in Belgium.
"Liquidation"
Mertens, a graduate of the Uni
versity of Louvain in Belgium,
said out of an entering college
class of 90, there might be a grad
uating class of 12.. lie studied
Germanic philosophy there for
five years. Smilingly, he com
mented, "As you can see, the
class liquidation was very easy."
The three Finnish teachers all

took their degrees a I the Univer
sity of Helsinki. That university
is scattered throughout the city,
explained Kaskenaia, nol concen
trated in one spot as Stanford is.
Enthusiastic
The visitors were very enthu
siastic over Hoover Tower. "It
has the best collection of Finnish
literature we've seen in this coun
try," said Miss Ellonen.
The lower carrillon, made in
Belgium, especially interested
Mertens. He found it a line ex
pression of Flemish art.
All talked about the palm trees
and sunny climate. During Jan
uary at home, they explained,
there is deep snow.
