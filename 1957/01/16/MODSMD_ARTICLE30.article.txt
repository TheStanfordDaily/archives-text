LITTLE STORIES WITH BIG MORALS
First Liltlp Story
Once upon a time there was an Indian brave named
Running Bear who had a squaw named Giggling Water.
Giggling Water was sort of a mess, but she sure could
make beaded moccasins. Every day she whipped up a
brand-new pair of beaded moccasins for Running Bear
which were so gorgeous that all the Indian maids on the
reservation grew giddy with admiration.
Well sir, Giggling Water got livid about all the girls
making goo-goo eyes at Running Bear, and one night she
told him so. Then he got livid too, and they had a terrible
rumble, and he slapped her on the wrist, and she started
crying like crazy and moved out of the wigwam and
went home to her mother and never came back.
"Good riddance!" said Running Bear, but he soon
found out how wrong he was, for the Indian maids were
not ( really interested in him, only in his moccasins, and
when he stopped showing up with a new pair every day,
they quickly gave him the yo-heave-ho, and today he is
a broken man, sitting all alone in his tepee and muttering
ancient Ute curses.
MORAL: Don't jifjht the hand thai beads ijoii.

Second Utile Story
( )nce upon a time there was a sweet old gentleman
named Nathan who ran a tobacco counter at a large
American university. All of the students loved him
dearly, and they used to come over whenever they could
to buy Philip Morris Cigarettes and chat with Nathan,
both of which were highly satisfactory pursuits. The
Philip Morrises were highly satisfactory because they
are full of natural goodness that is friendly and humane
and soothing and no small consolation in this strife
ridden world of ours. Nathan, like Philip Morris, was
also full of natural goodness that was friendly and
humane and all like that.
Well sir, the students smoked Philip Morris and
yocked with Nathan, and everything was lovely. Then
one day the university decided to fire Nathan and put
in a cigarette vending machine instead.
Well sir, the students did riot take that lying down,
you may be sure! They organized a monster rally and
went over to prexy's house and made fiery speeches about
good old Nathan and how they loved him.
Well sir, prexy was no fool, and when he saw how
heartbroken the students would be if Nathan went, he
decided that the wisest course was to keep Nathan and
cancel the cigarette vending machine. This he did, and
they all lived happily ever after.
MORAL: Better Xatr than tcvcr.
