# Coach Drills Card Cagers To Stop UW's Boin, Smart
## 
### Bob Payne 
Slopping the high-scoring duo
ol Bruno Boin and Doug Smart
is the chief worry for Coach How
ie Dallmar as he prepares the lit
dians for this week's chishes with
the powerful Washington Hus
kies.
Dalimar rates the Huskies
"near the top, if not on top," in
the Coast Conference. "Wash
ington presents more of a prob
lem lha.i Oregon State did. The
Beavers had one good man, Dave
Gambee, and a fair one, Gary
Goble. They were nowhere near
the threat that Boin and Smart
will be."

Dick Haga, Stanford's starting
forward, incurred a severe ankle
sprain in practice Monday eve
rung and team physician Dr. E. F.
Roth has placed the scrappy
.sophomore on a questionable list
for ihe weekend series against
the University of Washington.
Haga, a regular starter who
leads the Stanford scoring parade
in f'CC action with i2 points in
ihree tilts, will he replaced by
either Gary Van Galder or John
ITlueger if he is placed on the
disabled list

The 6-9 Boin, a junior, and 6-7
Smart, only a sophomore, have
scored 7.X and 69 points, respec
tively, in PCC action 1 his season.
Both performed with distinction
against Kansas and the Jay
hawks' 7 - foot soph sensation,
Wilt (The Stilt) Chamberlain last
month. In the second game Smart
scored one more field goal than
the Still, scoring 33 points to
Chamberlain's 37. And Boin!
lofted | | long hook shots into Ihe
hoop over Chamberlain's guard,
giving doubts as to the Kansan's
defensive prowess and illustrat-1
ing the extreme efficiency of
Bruno's favorite shot. But Kan
sas won both games.
Dye Praises Boin
Washington Coach Tippy Dye
calls Boin "the greatest long
hook-shooter in the game's his- j
tors thus rating him ahead of
Bol) Iloubregs, the fabulous!
Husky hooker of several seasons
back. Following last season the)
lanky junior joined the ranks of j
Seattle's AA' : champs, Buchan !
Bakers, and played a key role as
the Bakers went on to capture the
national crown.
Smart, remarkably agile de-j
spite his 230 pounds, has been
breaking Boin's records almost |
as lasi as Bruno could set them. I
As a senior with the state cham
pion Franklin of Seattle high |
school learn, Boin set a new city i
mark with 321 points in 14 games.
The next season Small scored 374
points to smash Boin's mark as j
lie paced Garfield High to the
slate title. Last season, Doug*
wiped out Bruno's one-year-old
Husky frosh record with 298
points.
Still (ioing
Had enough? Well, it hasn't
ended yet. The second highest
scorer in Seattle prep history, 6-4
Earle Irvine, is currently starring
lor the Husky Pups. Irvine Scored
364 points, with a record 44 in
one game, as he paced Lincoln to :
last year's Evergreen state
crown. And then there is 6-3 A 1
Murphy, from nearby Bremerton,
who scored 38 points in one game
for Ihe Husky frosh last month.
Needless 1o say, things are look
ing up in Seattle.
