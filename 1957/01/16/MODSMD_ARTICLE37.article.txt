# Stanford Frosh, Braves Tangle Friday Night
## 
### 
Campus interest is running high
for the Stanford freshmen-Braves
game which precedes the varsity
tilt at the Pavilion Friday night
at (>. The home teams' battle looks
to he one of the most exciting
tussles scheduled for the season.
This will not be the first time
the frosh have met the jayvees.
Early-season scrimmages, where
scores were not kept, produced
close, exciting sessions. Both
coaches feel that Friday's game
will follow this pattern.
Dick C 1 eg g's freshmen are
spending time with their offense
patterns, a problem which has
confronted them all year. The
frosh mentor feels, however, that
his squad has improved in this
area and in its defensive work.
Added experience, Clegg feels,
will give the Braves a slight ad
vantage. but he hopes the Pa
pooses will overcome this. In any
event, he noted, the game will be
a close one. "I think my boys
have more potential," Ik 1 added;
"it's a talented squad."
Present expected starters for
the frosh include Neal Brockmcy
er, center; Jerry Thuesen and
Chris Burford, forwards; and Ma

son Byles and Dick Thompson,
guards. Thompson has show n
much improvement in practice
and has moved up to the starting
five since the season began.
In the Braves' camp the words
of warning have been, "Try to
stop the frosh." Coach George
Lynn feels that because his squad
has not been able to work much
on, or to master, an offensive
technique the only thing it can
do is to defensively stop the Pa
pooses.
"We will be watching Byles and
Thuesen." Lynn has said, "and
also Burford, who has really come
along. At the center post we can
not mat c h Broekmeyer. The
Braves' Bob Bleteher is only (>••)."
Brave hopes will rest partly
with sharpshooter Mark Davis,
who pumped 27 points through
the hoops against Moffett Field
last week. Davis and Mai Craw
ford or Bob Dean will start at for
wards and Phil Link and Tom
Dyer will go at the guard posi
tions.
Saturday's frosh game against
Modesto JC has been moved up
to the customary (i p.m. starting
time.
