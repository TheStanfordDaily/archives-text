Currently on display at the
Stanford Art Gallery are 77 origi
nal woodcuts and engravings by
Albrecht Duerer, loaned to the
University by Richard F. Timken
of Palo Alto.
Duerer, the German master,
lived from 1471 to 1528 and is
noted for his fine woodcutting
skill which enabled 15th century
publishers of religious works to
illustrate their books and broaden
public interest.
Koberger, in 1453, proved this
interest by the success of his
Ninth German Bible (Nurem
berg), illustrated with hundreds
of woodcuttings.
This exhibit is especially impor
tant for the number of woodcut
tings and engravings present,
since few complete sets exist in
the world today.
Duerer's book, "The Life of the
Virgin," which he began in 1500
and completed in 1511, contained
20 of the large woodcuts on dis
play. The Nativity Scene is one
of 37 woodcuts from the "Small
Passion" in the exhibit, which
also includes 1G engravings from
the "Engraved Passion."
Among several individual
works is Duerer's masterly en
graving, "St. Jerome in His
Study."
Hours at the Stanford Art Gal
lery, just east of History Corner,
are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday
through Saturday adn 12 to 4 p.m.
Sundays. The gallery is closed
