### 
The importance of fondness and consideration instead of intense
love was stressed by Dr. David McK. Rioeh in last night's Tuesday
Evening Series lecture.
The chief of neuropsychiatry at Walter Reed Army Medical Center
in Washington, D.C., told a large audience that humiliation, hate and

other ego-centered emotions were
the real cause of such a professed
Jove.
Dr. Rioch said, "The greatest
change in thinking which has oc
curred in the present relativist
revolution is the kind of question
one is allowed to ask." Question
ing has changed from "how" to
"why."
Speaking on the topic "Certain
Problems in the Investigation of
the Psychology of Sex," Dr. Rioch
said everyone puts up a front, ihe
I or self, and it is a very respect
able thing. But it changes rapidly
to fit the situation. ■
"It never hurt anybody to 6e
sexually deprived, physically or
psychologically," the psychiatrist
said, "but it hurts if you feel you
are abnormal.
"The learned gender role is tlie
most important thing learned by
the human," said Dr. Rioch. "This
determines how one fits into, the
culture." He emphasized the im
portance of stable social commu
nication to the individual and of
avoidance of social isolation.
Tension resulting from density
of population was prophesied by
Ihe psychiatrist. "But," he said,
"this is a field in which we can act
operationally. We've only begun
to develop methods and tech
niques."
