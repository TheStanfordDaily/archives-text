"Social Standards, Made By and For the Women Students of
Stanford University."
This is the title of a small booklet distributed every year to
women students of the University. It is more than-a title; it is a
statement of the philosophy behind the University's long-developed
policy of social self-regulation.
It has not always been so. When the first Roble Hall (later
Sequoia Hall and now the Statistics Laboratory) opened its doors,
its residents were protected from Encina men with Victorian fervor.
Gentlemen callers were permitted on Sunday afternoons, but no
girl was ever to be seen alone with a man.
The social revolution of post-World War I days was felt at
Stanford, too. Although such relics as rules stating that "Stanford
women are war ned not to walk in the hills in groups of less than
four" and "First-quarter freshmen women may not motor off
campus after dark unless accompanied by another Stanford woman"

lingered on into the late '20's, the late Dean Mary Yost was helping
to make the social regulations more realistic.
"My women students are far more likely to want too much social
regulation -than too little," Dean Yost stated in 1930. "You would
he surprised if you knew how often I serve as a balance to prevent
too many rules. The most important function of college life is to
help the student pass from the small-group activities of the family
to the larger interest of professional life with as little maladjust
ment as possible. We must develop initiative, the ability to stand
alone and a sense of group responsibility."
It was about this time that agitation began for the granting
of 2:30 late leaves for special occasions. The issue was thoroughly
debated. Professor Marge Bailey said, "Women should abolish rules
which both men and women consider fit only for the government
of little girls!"
• The Daily stated its position on the issue: "The lives of the
women are endangered by screaming down the highway to make
the campus by 1:30. We should recognize the reality of social con
ditions. Our 1:30 rule is a relic of Victorianism and the double
standard."

As has been the case in the development of the social regulations,
public opinion won the day and 2:30 late leaves were instituted.
Up to 1939, the number of late leaves allowed to each woman
was allotted on a weekly basis, depending on their academic average
and class standing. The 1938 Revision Committee made extensive
recommendations, including the adoption of "a graduated scale of
late leaves, escaping too many complexities," and the abandoning
of academic standing as a criterion. Also recommended were a late
bonus and extension of the Honor Code to social regulations.
Once again, the system was modified according to the wishes
of the majority, and the recommendations were adopted. The
present system of increased late leaves with higher class standing
was instituted, along with the 15-minute bonus plan, in 1939.
Durin'g the 1940's the key system wa* begun, under which women
living in small living groups could let themselves in at night with
their own key, rather than hiring a night assistant. After a few
difficulties, the system worked well and is still in use.
In 1949 the demerit system replaced the old lock-in plan, which
is still used at most other colleges. Instead of being "campused"

for social violations, women are given fractions of demerits, which
accumulate during their fours years and can lead to social probation
or suspension.
The last major rule change occurred in 1953, when the women
of the student body voted out the old "lone-woman" rule, which said
that a woman could not enter a man's residence unless accompanied
by another woman.
The evolution of the social regulations to their present form is
a result of the Associated Women Students working together with
Women's Council and the Dean of Women. The administration has
demonstrated increasing confidence in the women students by
placing almost total responsibility for the system in the hands of
AWS and Council.
The functions are divided between the legislative body (AWS
and its advisory Social Regulations Committee) and the judicial
body (Women's Council). While the latter may interpret the exist
ing rules, it is the former group which has, over the years, attempted
to establish the regulations in response to the desires of the women
students.

recommendations, including the adoption of "a graduated scale of
late leaves, escaping too many complexities," and the abandoning
of academic standing as a criterion. Also recommended were a late
bonus and extension of the Honor Code to social regulations.
Once again, the system was modified according to the wishes
of the majority, and the recommendations were adopted. The
present system of increased late leaves with higher class standing
was instituted, along with the 15-minute bonus plan, in 1939.
Durin'g the 1940's the key system wa* begun, under which women
living in small living groups could let themselves in at night with
their own key, rather than hiring a night assistant. After a few
difficulties, the system worked well and is still in use.
In 1949 the demerit system replaced the old lock-in plan, which
is still used at most other colleges. Instead of being "campused"

for social violations, women are given fractions of demerits, which
accumulate during their fours years and can lead to social probation
or suspension.
The last major rule change occurred in 1953, when the women
of the student body voted out the old "lone-woman" rule, which said
that a woman could not enter a man's residence unless accompanied
by another woman.
The evolution of the social regulations to their present form is
a result of the Associated Women Students working together with
Women's Council and the Dean of Women. The administration has
demonstrated increasing confidence in the women students by
placing almost total responsibility for the system in the hands of
AWS and Council.
The functions are divided between the legislative body (AWS
and its advisory Social Regulations Committee) and the judicial
body (Women's Council). While the latter may interpret the exist
ing rules, it is the former group which has, over the years, attempted
to establish the regulations in response to the desires of the women
students.

"Social Standards, Made By and For the Women Students of
Stanford University."
This is the title of a small booklet distributed every year to
women students of the University. It is more than-a title; it is a
statement of the philosophy behind the University's long-developed
policy of social self-regulation.
It has not always been so. When the first Roble Hall (later
Sequoia Hall and now the Statistics Laboratory) opened its doors,
its residents were protected from Encina men with Victorian fervor.
Gentlemen callers were permitted on Sunday afternoons, but no
girl was ever to be seen alone with a man.
The social revolution of post-World War I days was felt at
Stanford, too. Although such relics as rules stating that "Stanford
women are war ned not to walk in the hills in groups of less than
four" and "First-quarter freshmen women may not motor off
campus after dark unless accompanied by another Stanford woman"

lingered on into the late '20's, the late Dean Mary Yost was helping
to make the social regulations more realistic.
"My women students are far more likely to want too much social
regulation -than too little," Dean Yost stated in 1930. "You would
he surprised if you knew how often I serve as a balance to prevent
too many rules. The most important function of college life is to
help the student pass from the small-group activities of the family
to the larger interest of professional life with as little maladjust
ment as possible. We must develop initiative, the ability to stand
alone and a sense of group responsibility."
It was about this time that agitation began for the granting
of 2:30 late leaves for special occasions. The issue was thoroughly
debated. Professor Marge Bailey said, "Women should abolish rules
which both men and women consider fit only for the government
of little girls!"
• The Daily stated its position on the issue: "The lives of the
women are endangered by screaming down the highway to make
the campus by 1:30. We should recognize the reality of social con
ditions. Our 1:30 rule is a relic of Victorianism and the double
standard."

As has been the case in the development of the social regulations,
public opinion won the day and 2:30 late leaves were instituted.
Up to 1939, the number of late leaves allowed to each woman
was allotted on a weekly basis, depending on their academic average
and class standing. The 1938 Revision Committee made extensive

girl was ever to be seen alone with a man.
The social revolution of post-World War I days was felt at
Stanford, too. Although such relics as rules stating that "Stanford
women are war ned not to walk in the hills in groups of less than
four" and "First-quarter freshmen women may not motor off
campus after dark unless accompanied by another Stanford woman"

lingered on into the late '20's, the late Dean Mary Yost was helping
to make the social regulations more realistic.
"My women students are far more likely to want too much social
regulation -than too little," Dean Yost stated in 1930. "You would
he surprised if you knew how often I serve as a balance to prevent
too many rules. The most important function of college life is to
help the student pass from the small-group activities of the family
to the larger interest of professional life with as little maladjust
ment as possible. We must develop initiative, the ability to stand
alone and a sense of group responsibility."
It was about this time that agitation began for the granting
of 2:30 late leaves for special occasions. The issue was thoroughly
debated. Professor Marge Bailey said, "Women should abolish rules
which both men and women consider fit only for the government
of little girls!"
• The Daily stated its position on the issue: "The lives of the
women are endangered by screaming down the highway to make
the campus by 1:30. We should recognize the reality of social con
ditions. Our 1:30 rule is a relic of Victorianism and the double
standard."

As has been the case in the development of the social regulations,
public opinion won the day and 2:30 late leaves were instituted.
Up to 1939, the number of late leaves allowed to each woman
was allotted on a weekly basis, depending on their academic average
and class standing. The 1938 Revision Committee made extensive
recommendations, including the adoption of "a graduated scale of
late leaves, escaping too many complexities," and the abandoning
of academic standing as a criterion. Also recommended were a late
bonus and extension of the Honor Code to social regulations.
Once again, the system was modified according to the wishes
of the majority, and the recommendations were adopted. The
present system of increased late leaves with higher class standing
was instituted, along with the 15-minute bonus plan, in 1939.
Durin'g the 1940's the key system wa* begun, under which women
living in small living groups could let themselves in at night with
their own key, rather than hiring a night assistant. After a few
difficulties, the system worked well and is still in use.
In 1949 the demerit system replaced the old lock-in plan, which
is still used at most other colleges. Instead of being "campused"

for social violations, women are given fractions of demerits, which
accumulate during their fours years and can lead to social probation
or suspension.
The last major rule change occurred in 1953, when the women
of the student body voted out the old "lone-woman" rule, which said
that a woman could not enter a man's residence unless accompanied
by another woman.
The evolution of the social regulations to their present form is
a result of the Associated Women Students working together with
Women's Council and the Dean of Women. The administration has
demonstrated increasing confidence in the women students by
placing almost total responsibility for the system in the hands of
AWS and Council.
The functions are divided between the legislative body (AWS
and its advisory Social Regulations Committee) and the judicial
body (Women's Council). While the latter may interpret the exist
ing rules, it is the former group which has, over the years, attempted
to establish the regulations in response to the desires of the women
students.
