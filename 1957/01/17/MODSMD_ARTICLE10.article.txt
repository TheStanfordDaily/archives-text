# Budget Starts House Skirmish Over Cause of High Living Cost
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, .Inn. 16 (UP) — President Eisenhower's record
peacetime budget touched off a Democratic-Republican skirmish
today over whether Eisenhower of former President Truman was
responsible for increased living costs.
Democrats charged that Eisenhower had abandoned GOP "econ

omy" pledges in out-spending the
Truman administration. Republi
cans retorted that Ihe budget at
least was balanced and should
make possible tax cuts in the fu
ture.
The row broke out on the
| House floor shortly after Con
gress received Eisenhower's
budget calling for spending of
$71.8 billion in the 12 months
starting July I. Although most
was for defense, nearly every
government agency would spend
more next year.
Democrats and some Republi
cans promised 1o scrutinize the
budget carefully. But they appar
ently saw little chance of substan
tial reductions.
Chairman Clarence Cannon (D-
Mo.) of the House Appropriations
Committee sparked a House floor
fight by charging that the Eisen
hower administration had broken
its promise of "economy." He
said, "There is no economy, there
is no retrenchment."
Cannon charged that persons
i living on fixed salaries and pen
sions "are in distress today be
cause of inflation as a result of
spending by this Congress at the
urgent insistence of this adminis
tration."
Representative Jo h n Ta be r
iN.Y.i, top Republican on the Ap
j propiiations Committee, retorted
| that three-fourths of the increase
j in the cost of living had come
under the Truman administra-
11 ion.
Taber said he believed Con
gress could make some cuts in
the budget, enabling the govern
ment to wind up the next fiscal
year with a surplus of $3 or $1
i billion instead «»f the $1.7 billion
I forecast, by the President.

come from and how it will he spent in financing President Elsen
hower's proposed 1958 fiscal budget. Estimated receipts of $73. fi
billion will finance the biggest peacetime spending program in
history.
