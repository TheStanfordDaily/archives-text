# Hungarians Greet Chon En-Lai With New Threats of Uprising
## Chinese Premier Says U.S. Trying To Interfere With Rising Socialism 
### 
VIENNA, Jan. 16 (UP»—Defiant Hungarian freedom fighters
greeted Chinese Premier Chou En-lai today with posters on Budapest
walls proclaiming a new uprising for Jan. 26.
Travelers arriving from Budapest said the posters told citizens t<
"stand by."
The posters urged Hungarians not to forget the dead of the up-

rising and said "65,000 Hunga
rians did not die in vain."
Chou arrived in Budapest on a
Moscow - backed swing through
restive Red satellites to promote
"unity" of the Communist bloc.
In his speech, as aired by Ra
dio Budapest, the Red Chinese
premier said that "the imperial
ists, and particularly the United
States, are always trying to inter
fere in-the affairs of Hungary."
"An example of such interfer
ence is the doctrine of Eisenhow
er," Chou said. "This gives proof
that the power of socialism is in
creasing while that of imperial
ism is on the decline.
"Imperialism will last for a
while yet, but it cannot stop so
cialism in the long run."
Even before Chou arrived in
Budapest, his statements in Mos
cow and Warsaw had ended Hun
garian hopes that some form of
Chinese - Indian mediation would
intervene to change Premier Ja
nos Kadar's announced return to
Communist dictatorship.
The Peiping leader's speech
confirmed the worst fears of the
Hungarian people. It said:
Crush Uprising
The Russian regime was right
to crush the Hungarian uprising
because otherwise the "imperial
ists" would have supported the
revolution with arms.
Hungary must rely in the fu
ture on "Soviet friendship."
The Hungarian government
will take care to "protect the peo
ple" against the activities of
"counter-revolutionaries."
Chou went through a formal
round of speeches and toasts,
carefully screened from anything
that could give him more than a
glimpse of the ferment still seeth
ing in Hungary. He was shep
herded by Premier Janos Kadar
from the moment he arrived
aboard a modern jet airliner from
Warsaw.
Count on Red China
In an airport speech quoted by
Budapest Radio, Chou said Hun
gary could always count on "sym
pathy and help" from Red China.
The sources who reported the
appearance of Budapest revolt
posters said that even before they
were pasted up, rumors were
sweeping Budapest that a new
revolt would take place in Febru
ary.
The rumors stemmed from the
desperate plight of Hungary's
factory workers and miners, now
threatened with death if they
show any resistance to the Com
munist regime or even complain
about working conditionh.
The travelers reported that 12,-
000 workers already have been
drafted into the labor-short mines
from Budapests' big Csepel Is
land iron and steel works.
Csepel was the scene of bloody
demonstrations last, week in
which Coinmunisl militia, backed
by Soviet tanks, fired into crowds
of defiant workers demanding the
ouster of Premier Janos Kadar.

The Hungarian government
will take care to "protect the peo

"counter-revolutionaries."
Chou went through a formal
round of speeches and toasts,
carefully screened from anything
that could give him more than a
glimpse of the ferment still seeth
ing in Hungary. He was shep
herded by Premier Janos Kadar
from the moment he arrived
aboard a modern jet airliner from
Warsaw.
Count on Red China
In an airport speech quoted by
Budapest Radio, Chou said Hun
gary could always count on "sym
pathy and help" from Red China.
The sources who reported the
appearance of Budapest revolt
posters said that even before they
were pasted up, rumors were
sweeping Budapest that a new
revolt would take place in Febru
ary.
The rumors stemmed from the
desperate plight of Hungary's
factory workers and miners, now
threatened with death if they
show any resistance to the Com
munist regime or even complain
about working conditionh.
The travelers reported that 12,-
000 workers already have been
drafted into the labor-short mines
from Budapests' big Csepel Is
land iron and steel works.
Csepel was the scene of bloody
demonstrations last, week in
which Coinmunisl militia, backed
by Soviet tanks, fired into crowds
of defiant workers demanding the
ouster of Premier Janos Kadar.
VIENNA, Jan. 16 (UP»—Defiant Hungarian freedom fighters
greeted Chinese Premier Chou En-lai today with posters on Budapest
walls proclaiming a new uprising for Jan. 26.
Travelers arriving from Budapest said the posters told citizens t<
"stand by."
The posters urged Hungarians not to forget the dead of the up-

rising and said "65,000 Hunga
rians did not die in vain."
Chou arrived in Budapest on a
Moscow - backed swing through
restive Red satellites to promote
"unity" of the Communist bloc.
In his speech, as aired by Ra
dio Budapest, the Red Chinese
premier said that "the imperial
ists, and particularly the United
States, are always trying to inter
fere in-the affairs of Hungary."
"An example of such interfer
ence is the doctrine of Eisenhow
er," Chou said. "This gives proof
that the power of socialism is in
creasing while that of imperial
ism is on the decline.
"Imperialism will last for a
while yet, but it cannot stop so
cialism in the long run."
Even before Chou arrived in
Budapest, his statements in Mos
cow and Warsaw had ended Hun
garian hopes that some form of
Chinese - Indian mediation would
intervene to change Premier Ja
nos Kadar's announced return to
Communist dictatorship.
The Peiping leader's speech
confirmed the worst fears of the
Hungarian people. It said:
Crush Uprising
The Russian regime was right
to crush the Hungarian uprising
