# The 						Senate's Archaic Rule 22
## 
### 
The Umtfd States Senate has already begun
considering the crucial issues of the day, but
it is working under one of the most crippling
and archaic rules imposed on a legis
lative body—Senate Rule 22.
This rule permits unlimited debate by Senate
members unless two thirds of the total members
of the body (64) vote for cloture, or a time
limit on debate.
For years a minority of Southern senators
has successfully blocked civil rights legislation
by simply talking the measures to death. There
lias been no way to bring the question to a
< lose in order to vote.
Talking for hours on end lo stall action on
a vote is no way for civilized human beings to
debate. For instance, in 1953 this country was
treated to the spectacle of Senator Wayne
Morse of Oregon talking for almost 24 hours
on the tidelands oil bill.
Ironically enough, this same senator is co
sponsor of a bill which we believe is the answer %
to the Senate's problem. Unfortunately, the
Senate will probably never pass it.
Morse's bill would give a majority of ihose
senators voting the right to cut off debate on
any legislation after that legislation had been
under discussion for 15 calendar days.
1 his would lead to a period of reasonable
debate rather than an endurance contest. The

15-day clause gives the minority its ehanee to
speak before the majority shuts off the debate.
Another proposal up for debate is the one
advanced by Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson
and Minority Leader William F. Knowland.
This would shut off debate if voted for by two
thirds of those attending.
But this is an insufficient answer. The abso
lute requirement of 64 would be pone, but one
more than one third could still prolong debate.
r l lie Morse proposal does not stand a chance
of passage because the very filibuster practice
under lire would be used against it.
Surprisingly enough, Vice-President Richard
Nixon has given some hope to the liberals with
the decision that a simple majority would be
all that would be needed to change the Senate
rules of debate, rather than the two thirds.
But there will be a long fight. Even the
Johnson-Knowland proposal will be hard to
get through the Senate, a body which seems to
hold talking as sacred as tenure. The likes of
Mississippi's James Eastland die bard; the con
servatives of the Senate form a formidable
opposition.
We hope the Senate will finally do something
about this blot on its reputation and integrity
and adopt the Morse-Douglas proposal.

The Umtfd States Senate has already begun
considering the crucial issues of the day, but
it is working under one of the most crippling
and archaic rules imposed on a legis
lative body—Senate Rule 22.
This rule permits unlimited debate by Senate
members unless two thirds of the total members
of the body (64) vote for cloture, or a time
limit on debate.
For years a minority of Southern senators
has successfully blocked civil rights legislation
by simply talking the measures to death. There
lias been no way to bring the question to a
< lose in order to vote.
Talking for hours on end lo stall action on
a vote is no way for civilized human beings to
debate. For instance, in 1953 this country was
treated to the spectacle of Senator Wayne
Morse of Oregon talking for almost 24 hours
on the tidelands oil bill.
Ironically enough, this same senator is co
sponsor of a bill which we believe is the answer %
to the Senate's problem. Unfortunately, the
Senate will probably never pass it.
Morse's bill would give a majority of ihose
senators voting the right to cut off debate on
any legislation after that legislation had been
under discussion for 15 calendar days.
1 his would lead to a period of reasonable
debate rather than an endurance contest. The

15-day clause gives the minority its ehanee to
speak before the majority shuts off the debate.
Another proposal up for debate is the one
advanced by Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson
and Minority Leader William F. Knowland.
This would shut off debate if voted for by two
thirds of those attending.
But this is an insufficient answer. The abso
lute requirement of 64 would be pone, but one
more than one third could still prolong debate.
r l lie Morse proposal does not stand a chance
of passage because the very filibuster practice
under lire would be used against it.
Surprisingly enough, Vice-President Richard
Nixon has given some hope to the liberals with
the decision that a simple majority would be
all that would be needed to change the Senate
rules of debate, rather than the two thirds.
But there will be a long fight. Even the
Johnson-Knowland proposal will be hard to
get through the Senate, a body which seems to
hold talking as sacred as tenure. The likes of
Mississippi's James Eastland die bard; the con
servatives of the Senate form a formidable
opposition.
We hope the Senate will finally do something
about this blot on its reputation and integrity
and adopt the Morse-Douglas proposal.
