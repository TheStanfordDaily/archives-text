## UN
						Charter Is Basis for Peace in Mideast 
### 
Editor's Note: Willi the opening of Hie an
nual Model United Nations session here in
April, Stamj-d will have an opportunity to
\va'. ]. a facsimile UN in action. The model
General Assembly, Security Council and other
I N councils and agencies will deal with con
crete problems that have faced the UN since
its birth in 1945.
In a series of weekly articles, we shall at
tempt to present background information on
the more recent problems the UN lias faced
lauAthc methods it uved to handle them. To
day's article covers the crisis over the Anglo-
French-Israeli invasion of Egypt.
Behind all the noise and inflammatory per
sonal battles which ■, cd the Suez problem,
it was the United ~s Charter which pro
vided a basis for negotiation and the organiza
tion for the Emergency Force which is currently
maintaining peace in the Middle East.
Negotiations between Britain, France and
Egypt over nationalization of the Suez Canal
Company had failed. The Canal Users' Associa
tion had failed to formulate a solution acceptable
to both parties.
These negotiations were entirely in line with
Article 33 of the UN Charter which says that
parties to an international dispute should at
tempt, "first of all, to seek a resolution by nego
tiation ... or other peaceful means of their
own choice."
But in case this means fails, Hie Charter also
provides for the dispute to be brought before the
Security Council, the UN organ which deals with
the maintenance of international peace.
The debate which followed produced no solu
tion Then representatives of Egypt, France and

Britain met in secret around the coffee table
in the offices of UN Secretary-General Dag Ilam
marskjold and worked out the six principles on
which they agreed to negotiate.
Only Ihe method of "insulation" remained to
be settled. The Anglo-French proposal asked for
an international board as outlined at the 15-na
tion London Conference. Egypt, backed by a
Russian veto, refused the method. The dispute
continued until Oct. 29, when Israel invaded
Egypt-
The Security Council met the next day. Brit
ain and France had already demanded immediate
withdrawal of all troops from the Suez area and
threatened occupation of the canal, ostensibly to
protect its traffic. The two nations then vetoed
resolutions asking all parties to refrain from
using force.
The Council, thus blocked by vetoes, invoked
the "Uniting for Peace" resolution, created in
November, 1950, when Russia had walked out
of the UN. By this, the problem can be turned
over to the General Assembly by a procedural
vote of seven of the eleven members.
The General Assembly passed a resolution
calling upon Britain, France and Israel to cease
hostilities. Then under Article 42 of ihe Charter
it created Ihe UN Emergency Force to obtain
and supervise a truce "with the consent of the
nations concerned." This Article was also in
voked at the outset of the Korean War.
The four nations agreed to both resolutions
and on Nov. l."> the first units of the UN Emer
gency Force landed at Port Said.
Thus, When independent means had failed, the
UN organization set up a basis for negotiation
and prevented further fighting and a possible
Middle Eastern war with its police force.
