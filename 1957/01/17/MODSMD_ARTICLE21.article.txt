# Visiting Professor Leads in Search For More Constructive Use of Science
## 'Scientists Should Try To See Fundamental Problems as Theirs' 
### Dave Canfield 
Among the visiting professors
at Stanford this year is a leader
in the promotion of less science
for war and more science for
peace.
This man is Albert Vinicio Baez,
physics professor from Redlands
(College and a past vice-president
of the Society for Social Responsi
bility in Science.
SSRS is not, as the visiting pro
fessor jokingly advised, to be con
fused with USSR, and has as its
purpose to "clarify our thinking
as to what constitutes the con
structive and the destructive as
pects of science and to open up
imaginative outlets for engi
neers." A monthly newsletter
helps carry out this purpose.
Baez emphasized the distinction
between scientists and engineers.
"All," he said, "have the ordinary
moral and social responsibilities;
some have a unique responsibility
because of their new power."
Few Scientists
Few can become pure scientists,
while many must become engi
neers, I he SSRS leader said. These
engineers have a choice to make
in choosing their profession today.
"Today," continued Bae/, "much
of the effort in the country cen
ters aro.und so-called 'defense,'
which is really preparation for the
best offense. This requires many
applied scientists who must de
vote their time to the construction
of weapons."
Although such work offers
great economic rewards, it often
bases itself on what the visiting
professor called "a debatable
premise"—that the United States
must heavily lean on its war
making potential.
"Since wars begin in the minds
of men," Baez theorized, "it is in
the minds of men that the de
fenses of peace must be estab
lished. Therefore, some applied
scientists must, of choice, move
into areas where they do construc
tive work."
Weapons Work
If his choice instead leads the
scientist into weapons work, he
should "stay and participate in
this way." But here, Baez declar
ed, "you're no longer a scientist.
You're an engineer using your
talents to serve your country, or
to serve your aircraft company,
or to buy your family a better
home."
If, on the other hand, the scien
tist feels that enemies such as
poverty, fear, ignorance or disease
should receive the brunt of sci
ence's attack, he should enter con
structive work, the SSRS man ad
vised.
"Our need for scientists, pure
and applied, is greater, not less,
than heretofore," he went on. "But
more should be motivated, by
proper teaching, to view the basic
problems of ignorance, fear and
hunger as their problems."
UNESCO
Attacking such problems is the
United Nations Educational, Sci
entific and Cultural Organization,
nicknamed "Unesco." Through
this organization, Baez said, "even
a third-rate Ph.D. from the United
States could be of tremendous
help in an underdeveloped coun
try."
Baez himself served aft head of
the UNESCO technical assistance

mission to Iraq in 19131-52. While
there he also taught in the College
of Arts and Sciences in Baghdad.
Of his job in Baghdad he com
mented: "The idea behind Unesco
is jthat long-range problems of
peace can be solved by education
and science. If you go as a teach
er, the satisfaction is of having
dropped a pebble into this reser
voir."
Nobel Prize Winner
Advocating such constructive
use of science are men such as
German Nobel prize winner Max
von Laue, French nuclear physi
cist Pierre Auger and Japanese
Nobel prize winner S. I. Maya
kawa.
The membership of SSRS also
includes, as Bae/ described them,
"a small minority of lesser lights
like myself."
The professor has a hobby of
visiting "highest scientific men"
and sounding them out on SSRS's
aims.
Oiven Encouragement
These men have given Baez en
couragement. As he put it, "Many
of these men in high places say,
'.I must devote part of my time to
interesting problems which are
even more pressing than my daily
life.' "
However, Baez emphasized that
concerned scientists shouldn't let
enthusiasm for constructive work
overshadow competence in their
daily affairs.
"Finally," summed up Baez,
"the responsibility for using sci
entific discoveries properly rests
just as heavily on statesmen, poli
ticians, military leaders and ordi
nary people."

Among the visiting professors
at Stanford this year is a leader
in the promotion of less science
for war and more science for
peace.
This man is Albert Vinicio Baez,
physics professor from Redlands
(College and a past vice-president
of the Society for Social Responsi
bility in Science.
SSRS is not, as the visiting pro
fessor jokingly advised, to be con
fused with USSR, and has as its
purpose to "clarify our thinking
as to what constitutes the con
structive and the destructive as
pects of science and to open up
imaginative outlets for engi
neers." A monthly newsletter
helps carry out this purpose.
Baez emphasized the distinction
between scientists and engineers.
"All," he said, "have the ordinary
moral and social responsibilities;
some have a unique responsibility
because of their new power."
Few Scientists
Few can become pure scientists,
while many must become engi
neers, I he SSRS leader said. These
engineers have a choice to make
in choosing their profession today.
"Today," continued Bae/, "much
of the effort in the country cen
ters aro.und so-called 'defense,'
which is really preparation for the
best offense. This requires many
applied scientists who must de
vote their time to the construction
of weapons."
Although such work offers
great economic rewards, it often
bases itself on what the visiting
professor called "a debatable
premise"—that the United States
must heavily lean on its war
making potential.
"Since wars begin in the minds
of men," Baez theorized, "it is in
the minds of men that the de
fenses of peace must be estab
lished. Therefore, some applied
scientists must, of choice, move
into areas where they do construc
tive work."
Weapons Work
If his choice instead leads the
scientist into weapons work, he
should "stay and participate in
this way." But here, Baez declar
ed, "you're no longer a scientist.
You're an engineer using your
talents to serve your country, or
to serve your aircraft company,
or to buy your family a better
home."
If, on the other hand, the scien
tist feels that enemies such as
poverty, fear, ignorance or disease
should receive the brunt of sci
ence's attack, he should enter con
structive work, the SSRS man ad
vised.
"Our need for scientists, pure
and applied, is greater, not less,
than heretofore," he went on. "But
more should be motivated, by
proper teaching, to view the basic
problems of ignorance, fear and
hunger as their problems."
UNESCO
Attacking such problems is the
United Nations Educational, Sci
entific and Cultural Organization,
nicknamed "Unesco." Through
this organization, Baez said, "even
a third-rate Ph.D. from the United
States could be of tremendous
help in an underdeveloped coun
try."
Baez himself served aft head of
the UNESCO technical assistance

mission to Iraq in 19131-52. While
there he also taught in the College
of Arts and Sciences in Baghdad.
Of his job in Baghdad he com
mented: "The idea behind Unesco
is jthat long-range problems of
peace can be solved by education
and science. If you go as a teach

If his choice instead leads the
scientist into weapons work, he
should "stay and participate in
this way." But here, Baez declar
ed, "you're no longer a scientist.
You're an engineer using your
talents to serve your country, or
to serve your aircraft company,
or to buy your family a better
home."
If, on the other hand, the scien
tist feels that enemies such as
poverty, fear, ignorance or disease
should receive the brunt of sci
ence's attack, he should enter con
structive work, the SSRS man ad
vised.
"Our need for scientists, pure
and applied, is greater, not less,
than heretofore," he went on. "But
more should be motivated, by
proper teaching, to view the basic
problems of ignorance, fear and
hunger as their problems."
UNESCO
Attacking such problems is the
United Nations Educational, Sci
entific and Cultural Organization,
nicknamed "Unesco." Through
this organization, Baez said, "even
a third-rate Ph.D. from the United
States could be of tremendous
help in an underdeveloped coun
try."
Baez himself served aft head of
the UNESCO technical assistance

mission to Iraq in 19131-52. While
there he also taught in the College
of Arts and Sciences in Baghdad.
Of his job in Baghdad he com
mented: "The idea behind Unesco
is jthat long-range problems of
peace can be solved by education
and science. If you go as a teach
er, the satisfaction is of having
dropped a pebble into this reser
voir."
Nobel Prize Winner
Advocating such constructive
use of science are men such as
German Nobel prize winner Max
von Laue, French nuclear physi
cist Pierre Auger and Japanese
Nobel prize winner S. I. Maya
kawa.
The membership of SSRS also
includes, as Bae/ described them,
"a small minority of lesser lights
like myself."
The professor has a hobby of
visiting "highest scientific men"
and sounding them out on SSRS's
aims.
Oiven Encouragement
These men have given Baez en
couragement. As he put it, "Many
of these men in high places say,
'.I must devote part of my time to
interesting problems which are
even more pressing than my daily
life.' "
However, Baez emphasized that
concerned scientists shouldn't let
enthusiasm for constructive work
overshadow competence in their
daily affairs.
"Finally," summed up Baez,
"the responsibility for using sci
entific discoveries properly rests
just as heavily on statesmen, poli
ticians, military leaders and ordi
nary people."

Among the visiting professors
at Stanford this year is a leader
in the promotion of less science
for war and more science for
peace.
This man is Albert Vinicio Baez,
physics professor from Redlands
(College and a past vice-president
of the Society for Social Responsi
bility in Science.
SSRS is not, as the visiting pro
fessor jokingly advised, to be con
fused with USSR, and has as its
purpose to "clarify our thinking
as to what constitutes the con
structive and the destructive as
pects of science and to open up
imaginative outlets for engi
neers." A monthly newsletter
helps carry out this purpose.
Baez emphasized the distinction
between scientists and engineers.
"All," he said, "have the ordinary
moral and social responsibilities;
some have a unique responsibility
because of their new power."
Few Scientists
Few can become pure scientists,
while many must become engi
neers, I he SSRS leader said. These
engineers have a choice to make
in choosing their profession today.
"Today," continued Bae/, "much
of the effort in the country cen
ters aro.und so-called 'defense,'
which is really preparation for the
best offense. This requires many
applied scientists who must de
vote their time to the construction
of weapons."
Although such work offers
great economic rewards, it often
bases itself on what the visiting
professor called "a debatable
premise"—that the United States
must heavily lean on its war
making potential.
"Since wars begin in the minds
of men," Baez theorized, "it is in
the minds of men that the de
fenses of peace must be estab
lished. Therefore, some applied
scientists must, of choice, move
into areas where they do construc
tive work."
Weapons Work
If his choice instead leads the
scientist into weapons work, he
should "stay and participate in
this way." But here, Baez declar
ed, "you're no longer a scientist.
