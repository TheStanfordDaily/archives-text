# INJURED HAGA DOUBTFUL
## Tall Washington Cagers Peril Indian Title Hopes 
### Bob Payne 
"D-Day" has arrived for Ihe
Stanford varsity cagers as they
must gain at least a split with
Washington's Huskies this week
end to stay in strong contention
for the Pacific Coast Conference
basketball crown.
Card fortunes took a dip Tues
day when hustling sophomore
forward Dick Haga suffered a se
verely sprained ankle in practice.
The 6-4 rookie had just been com
ing into top form, having scored
IS points last week against Cali
fornia.
Should Haga be unable to play,
his height may be sorely missed
in the Indian lineup against the
lanky Huskies. Most likely re
placements are sophomore John
Pflueger and Gary Van Galder,
usually a guard. Another possi
bility is G-7 Lee Leonard, while
ex-gridder Carl Isaacs has been
regaining form and may also see
action.
Stanford has always been espe
cially scrappy and tough to beat
on the home court . . . and some
of this "luck" may be needed this
week. The one-point loss to Ore
gon State two weeks ago was the
only Pavilion setback suffered by
the Cards this season. Revenge
was gained the next night with a
60-58 victory, but Washington,
according to Coach Howie Dall
mar, poses a different problem.
Currently 1-2 in conference
play, a double loss would almost
eliminate the Indians. Next week
a single conference clash with
California is on tap, at Stanford,
followed by a Saturday night
meeting with Santa Clara in the
Cow Palace.
The hustling play of Bill Bond,
Paul Neumann and Hap Wagner
has made it extremely tough on
Card opponents to bring the ball
down court unmolested. This trio
swings into high gear in the late
going and has already pulled sev
eral games out of Ihe fire. Haga
and husky Clint Waring have also

l>een collaring a good share of re
bounds despite the faet lhat at 6-4
they rank as short men under the
boards.
Haga took the team lead in con
ference scoring with his 18-point
burst at Cal last week. Following
him with 41 apiece are Neumann
and Bond. Neumann's 20-point
performance against OSC is the
single game high for league ac
tion.
Stanford is the only PCC team
to hold a lifetime cage advantage
over the Huskies. The Cards have
dumped Washington nine times
while losing seven.
The Huskies are scheduled to
arrive from Seattle this after
noon and have slated a short
workout at Stanford. Both games
are scheduled for 8:30. The Stan
ford frosh meet the Braves in the
Friday night preliminary.

must gain at least a split with
Washington's Huskies this week
end to stay in strong contention
for the Pacific Coast Conference
basketball crown.
Card fortunes took a dip Tues
day when hustling sophomore
forward Dick Haga suffered a se
verely sprained ankle in practice.
The 6-4 rookie had just been com
ing into top form, having scored
IS points last week against Cali
fornia.
Should Haga be unable to play,
his height may be sorely missed
in the Indian lineup against the
lanky Huskies. Most likely re
placements are sophomore John
Pflueger and Gary Van Galder,
usually a guard. Another possi
bility is G-7 Lee Leonard, while
ex-gridder Carl Isaacs has been
regaining form and may also see
action.
Stanford has always been espe
cially scrappy and tough to beat
on the home court . . . and some
of this "luck" may be needed this
week. The one-point loss to Ore
gon State two weeks ago was the
only Pavilion setback suffered by
the Cards this season. Revenge
was gained the next night with a
60-58 victory, but Washington,
according to Coach Howie Dall
mar, poses a different problem.
Currently 1-2 in conference
play, a double loss would almost
eliminate the Indians. Next week
a single conference clash with
California is on tap, at Stanford,
followed by a Saturday night
meeting with Santa Clara in the
Cow Palace.
The hustling play of Bill Bond,
Paul Neumann and Hap Wagner
has made it extremely tough on
Card opponents to bring the ball
down court unmolested. This trio
swings into high gear in the late
going and has already pulled sev
eral games out of Ihe fire. Haga
and husky Clint Waring have also

l>een collaring a good share of re
bounds despite the faet lhat at 6-4
they rank as short men under the
boards.
Haga took the team lead in con
ference scoring with his 18-point
burst at Cal last week. Following
him with 41 apiece are Neumann
and Bond. Neumann's 20-point
performance against OSC is the
single game high for league ac
tion.
Stanford is the only PCC team
to hold a lifetime cage advantage
over the Huskies. The Cards have
dumped Washington nine times
while losing seven.
The Huskies are scheduled to
arrive from Seattle this after
noon and have slated a short
workout at Stanford. Both games
are scheduled for 8:30. The Stan
ford frosh meet the Braves in the
Friday night preliminary.
"D-Day" has arrived for Ihe
Stanford varsity cagers as they
must gain at least a split with
