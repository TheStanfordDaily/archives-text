# Stu-Fac Commission Organized To Encourage Better Relations
## 
### 
When satisfied that students and faculty has attained a sponta
neous relationship, the Student-Faculty Commission will cease to
function. The commission's purpose is to eliminate a need of out
side encouragement for better relations from such a group.
Instigated three years ago by Liz Livadary and Lois Paddleford,

under the direction of ASSU Pres
ident Pete Bing, the commission
(then committee) was composed
of approximately 40 members.
Working together, members of
the group succeeded in drawing
up fundamental plans for the
committee and functioned for a
year. Eventually cutting itself
down to its present size of 15
members, the group was formed
into a temporary committee of
the ASSU.
Made Conuiiission
Last year when the ASSU con
stitution was revised, the commit
tee was made a permanent ASSU
commission.
The Student - Faculty Commis
sion supervises student - faculty
coffee hours, dessert get-togethers
and the system of living groups
inviting faculty guests for lunch
cons, dinners and informal dis
cussions.
A special Dean's Fund has been
established to finance these activi
ties. According to Chairman Bob
Faust, students may use this fund
any time they want to have a
faculty guest for lunch or dinner
in any living group.
Guest Meals
The procedure is simply to no
tify the dining room director and
ask to have the bill sent to the
Dean's Office. The fund is also
available for entertaining faculty
guests' wives. A similar fund may
be used by faculty members for
entertaining students.
Last year the commission pro
posed student-faculty lounges in
each department, similar to the
Education Lounge in Cubberley.
The idea was accepted by both
students and faculty, but at the
present time there is'lack of room
for something of this nature.
The commission is currently
sending separate letters to faculty
members and student living
groups informing them of plans
for future student-faculty func
tions and asking for suggestions.
Like Suggestions
"The commission will be glad
to receive suggestions from stu
dents who at any time feel some
policy is inadequate or could be
improved." commented Faust.
Suggestions can be made to
commission members at any time.
