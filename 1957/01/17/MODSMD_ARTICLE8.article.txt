# Student Seals Now Reserved At Cage Games
## Area Below Hailing In Pavilion to Be For SB Card Holders 
### 
Stanford students now have re
served seats for all I lie varsity
basketball games.
Athletic Director Al Masters has
reserved all seats in the Pavilion
below the railing for holders of
Stanford student body cards.
Masters acted by request of a
letter from ASSU President Bob
Freelen and Men's Row represent
ative Ed Baker asking for the res
ervation. In its Jan. 9 meeting
Legislature unanimously voted
for the letter to be drafted.
Receives Letter
Tuesday Freelen received a let
ter from Eunice Du Prau, admin
istrative assistant to Masters,
which stated: "I have talked to
Mr. Masters regarding the con
tents of your letter, and we are
perfectly willing to hold those
seats below the aisle railing for
Stanford students. We will put
the plan into operation this week
and hope it works out well for all
concerned."
This means that the plan will
go into effect during this week
end series with the University of
Washington and will operate dur
ing every other varsity game.
Done Before
Seats were reserved for Stan
ford students many years ago
until the Pavilion began to have
seats added to it, and then the
restrictions were lifted.
Presently the Pavilion seats
2700, with 700 to 1000 students
attending. The below-aisle seats,
with the exception of those re
served for the basketball teams,
are expected to take care of a
large part of the student seat
problem, according to Miss Du
Prau.
