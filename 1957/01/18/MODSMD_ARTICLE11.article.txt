# IIR Speaker Says Bay Area Very Important Art Center
## Art Should Be Lived With, Suggests Expert, But Museums Are Best Practical Substitute By Dave Canfield 
### 
Dr. Grace Morley, director of the San Francisco Museum of Art,
yesterday called the Bay Area "one of the very important centers
for contemporary art in the United States."
In an Institute of International Relations Cultural Talk, Dr. Mor
ley spoke before about 50 persons in the Main Library Bender Room.

Although 23 years ago San Fran
cisco was isolated from national
and international art trends, the
museum director said, the city
now has taken its place in inter
national art.
"It is rare," Dr. Morley said,
"for a city outside of Boston,
New York, Washington and Phila
delphia—;to boast three ait mu
seums, as San Francisco can.
"Museums Not Ideal"
"Museums," she went on, "are
not an ideal system, because art
is meant to be lived with and not
to be hidden away in galleries."
Dr. Motley indicated that the
average person, however, does not
possess the money lo "live with
art." "In a museum Hie average
person does not stay in front of
any one picture for more than 20
seconds," the art lecturer said.
"It is just ridiculous to think
that anyone can get an impression
in that short a time," she declared.
"To dare say you like a picture
or dislike it in a short lime just
isn't fair it isn't fair lo it and it
isn't fair to you."
She said a painting "is apart
from what a camera can do better
and what ;i writer can do better.
A painting isn't a picture, nor is
;i shitue an exact replica of, let's
say, a nude."
"Go Having Mad . . ."
While it is "an obligation, h
privilege and an opportunity" lot
people lo respond to the message
that art gives, she explained peo
ple do not "respond to all art
equally." Some people, Dr. Mor
ley related, "go raving mad in an
exhibition oT modern art."
As reasons for such artistic
hysteria, she gave the following:
• "The pleasures of recognition
in most human beings far out
weigh the pleasures of discovery."
• The modern artist depicts a
disturbing world.
• "It is hard to enjoy work of
a personality that rloes not jibe
with your personality. ... Art is
like a friendship."
Dr. Mot ley assuaged people who
may feel "guilty" bent use they
don't "enjoy" modern art.
Before throwing open the pro
gram to questions, the speaker
showed two pictures exemplifying
expressionism and geometric ab
straction. She described geomet
ric abstraction as the "relation of
areas of color in frames."
