# ICC Approves Plans for New Eating Club Recreation Area
## Space to Contain Large Athletic Field, Four Volleyball Courts as Well as Barbecue Pit 
### 
Interclub Council has approved new plans for a $16,300 Interclub
Recreation Area. Complete plans are being drafted by a landscape
architect and will be submitted to the Board of Trustees for their
final approval.
The recreation area will consist of a large athletic field, four vol-

leyball courts, two of which will
be convertible into a basketball
court, and a barbecue area.
It is to be located behind the
eating club dining hall, and is to
be Lshaped in a fashion similar
to the dining halls.
On its outer extremities the
area is to be 365 feet on the north
and 310 feet on the east.
According to the plan the grass
athletic field will be at the south
east end, 140 by 237 teet. It will
be bounded on one side by plants,
a walkway and curbing.
The volleyball courts, made of
asphalt or clay, will be at the
north end of the "L." Two will
have removable net posts, so the
area may be converted into a bas
ketball court at any time. Back
stop posts, part of the basketball
court, will be permanent., and of
very rugged construction.
ICC plans to have a barbecue
pit built professionally, at a cost
not to exceed $500, but may have
if built at a later date than the
rest of the recreation area. When
built, it would be large enough to
cook 20 steaks at a time.
Landscaping will cut the barbe
cue area from the athletic field.
A road will bound the entire area
on the north.
