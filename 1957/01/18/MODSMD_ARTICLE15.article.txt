WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles has assured Congress that
President Eisenhower will "lean
over backward" to avoid using
U.S. troops under his new Middle
East plan, it was disclosed today.
Dulles' hitherto secret testi
mony was made available to the
United Press shortly after Speak
er Sam Rayburn threw his pow
erful support behind President
Eisenhower's new anti - Commu
nist program for the area.
Rayburn also said he was in
favor of handling the economic
and military features of the plan
in one legislative package, in
stead of splitting them as some
Democrats suggest. Such senti
ment particularly was strong in
the Senate.
Eisenhower asked Congress for
permission to spend $400 million
in the next two years on eco
nomic aid to the Middle East. He
also wanted authority to use
American troops, if necessary, to
deter any Communist military
aggression in the area.
Dulles said in his closed-door
testimony that a decision on us
ing U.S. troops in Ihe Middle East
should be left to Eisenhower's
best judgment. He conceded that
a miscalculation could touch off
World War 111, but added:
"I think there can be an abso
lute conviction that the President
would lean over backward not to
interpret the facts as justifying
the use of armed force unless
there was real danger to the
United States."
Dulles said, however, that the
real danger to the Middle East
nations came from Communist
subversion, not armed aggres
sion. He said the President's pro
posals were "designed primarily
to assist in preventing subver
sion."
