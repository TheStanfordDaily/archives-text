## Joint Statements Attack U.S. Plan For Middle East 
### 
MOSCOW, Jan. 17 (UP)—The
premiers of Russia and Commu
nist China, addressing an extrao)
dinary Kremlin r'ally, denounced
the Eisenhower Doctrine today as
a United States plan to seize con
trol of the vital Middle East.
Chinese Premier Chou En-lai,
just back from a tour of Poland
and Hungary, joined with Soviet
Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin in a
call for greater "vigilance" to
combat the American Middle
East policy plan.
Both spoke to an estimated
3500 persons in a "friendship
meeting" in the Kremlin's white
marble Supreme Soviet chamber.
American correspondents were
excluded from the meeting, but
speeches were broadcast by Mos
cow radio.
"Ringleader"
The Chinese leader had just
flown back from Budapest where
he attacked the U.S. as "the main
ringleader of the imperialists," in
a statement issued jointly with
Hungarian Premier Janos Kadar.
The Budapest communique
charged the United States is "pre
paring for war." It attacked the
Eisenhower Doctrine as an at
tempt to "subjugate the people in
the Near East, to renew the cold
war, to stir up rebellion."
The joint communique approv
ing Soviet action in crushing the
Hungarian rebellion was seen by
observers as a clear demonstra
tion that China stands solidly be
hind Russia on'all major policy
issues.
"Liberation"
At the Kremlin meeting attend
ed by Soviet leaders, Bulganin
warmly supported China's plea
for a seat in the United Nations,
and for the "liberation" of Na
tionalist Formosa.
Bulganin said that talks be
tween Chou and Soviet laders had
shown "an absolute identity of
views on current international
problems" between the two coun
tries.
In his speech Chou agreed, but.
said that "at times not everything
went well" in relations of Com
munist nations. He added, how
ever, that "all has been settled
amicably."
The Chinese premier also re
marked that the Chinese people,
while following the road to so
cialism opened up by Moscow,
were applying Communist doc
trines "taking into particular »- -
count the characteristics of our
country."

ringleader of the imperialists," in
a statement issued jointly with
