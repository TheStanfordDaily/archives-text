# New for an Old Policy
## 
### 
Despite the fanfare and debate over the
coming of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," it can
scarcely be called an innovation in foreign
policv. It is an old gun with a new name aimed
at a new target.
It is reminiscent of the Marshall Plan and
the Truman Doctrine in that it attempts to
build up underdeveloped countries to the point
where they can withstand the temptation of
Communism and Soviet economic aid.
It is reminiscent of Eisenhower's earlier
appeal to Congress for power to move American
forces into another, then critical, area- —the
Formosa Straits.
The whole concept of the President reserving
the power to use military forces to protect a
free nation against Communist attack is remi
niscent of Truman's sending troops to Korea
in 1950.
If Congress approves the President's plan,
hew« tiiu !»e authorized to use American armed
forces against any Communist or Communist
dominated aggressor in the Middle East ii the
attacked nation requested American assistance.
The action must be in accord with American
treaty obligations and the United Nations
charter. Hour-by-hour contact must be kept
with Congress.
To build a firmer democratic basis in the
Middle East, the Pre.'-'1« it has called for an
extensive $400,000,000 foreign aid program 1o
cover a two-year period.
True, it does empower the President to draw
the country into war, but by his constitutional
power as Commander-in-Chief h e would tech
nically have the power to send forces to the
Middle East anyway, thus involving us in war.
There is little new in all this. The innova
tion lies in the fact that, at last, this country
has come up with a foreign policy —or at least
a segment of a foreign policy — toward the
Middle East.

Although Eisenhower has turned the matter
over to Congress, Congress certainly cannot turn
down the President's request. Any serious mod
ification of it would he an open invitation to
the Soviets to move into the Middle East.
The real danger is that the Administration
and congressional leaders will breathe a sigh
of relief, say "at last we have a policy toward
the Middle East" and accept the doctrine as a
cure-all.
ft is far from a cure-all, for, except for the
economic aid provisions, it does not get t<» the
eore of the problem, which is the deep-rooted
friction between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Until this dispute is brought to a practical
settlement the whole Middle Eastern area will
be ripe for chaos.
Through the UN and decisive leadership
from Washington, the warring parties may he
brought to an agreement, and the time to start
working is now.
American prestige is unusually high in the
Arab world because of the part lliis country
played in forcing the withdrawal of Erencli,
British and Israeli forces from the Suez Canal.
If the United States can capitalize on its
newly-won prestige, it could decisively cut away
the groundwork on which the Communists seek
to build their new "sphere of influence'" in tin-
Middle East.
Our policy has long been one of containment
—aimed directly at the Soviet Union and its
satellites. Sole dependence on a policy of con
tainment can be dangerous when we see nothing
but the specter of the glowering Soviet Union
and leave unattended such power vacuums as
that in the Middle East.
The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is only a part of
a full-fledged, dynamic and forward-looking
foreign policy that this country must develop
toward the Middle East.

True, it does empower the President to draw
the country into war, but by his constitutional
power as Commander-in-Chief h e would tech

There is little new in all this. The innova

a segment of a foreign policy — toward the

Although Eisenhower has turned the matter
over to Congress, Congress certainly cannot turn

the Soviets to move into the Middle East.
The real danger is that the Administration

Our policy has long been one of containment

that in the Middle East.
The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is only a part of

Despite the fanfare and debate over the

It is reminiscent of the Marshall Plan and

build up underdeveloped countries to the point

Communism and Soviet economic aid.
It is reminiscent of Eisenhower's earlier
