# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Why Not Invite Yugoslavia's Tito? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
Since tho proposal was made last year to invite-
Yugoslavian President Josip Broz (Marshal Tito)
to visit the United States as the guest of this
government, much criticism has been leveled
against the prospective visit.
Speaking strongly against such a visit have
been such nationally - known personalities as
House Majority Leader John McCormack, na
tional commanders of both the American Legion
and the Veterans of Foreign Wars and, of course,
Senator Joseph McCarthy and that group of
extreme right-wing Republicans he sometimes
speaks for.
It is only natural that the advisability of Tito's
visit would be questioned. It has—and no really
satisfactory answer has been made.
The proposal to invite Tito has come out of
State Department policy. This would indicate
perhaps that the United States had some kind
of policy regarding Yugoslavia. But if American
policy toward the Near East was rather indefinite
and nebulous, the policy toward Yugoslavia is
certainly much more so.
One wonders whether it can even be called
"policy."
When Tito broke' with Stalin, the Truman
Administration immediately took steps to further
the rift by driving an economic wedge between
the two dictators.
This action cannot be called wooing in a posi
tive sense—it was just a measure to keep Yugo
slavia from falling back into the Soviet orbit
when the break had been made. Russia, on the
other hand, did seriously woo Tito. How success
ful she has been is undetermined.
Rut the question of how far we should go
toward wooing Tito, or how much military or
economic aid we should lend Yugoslavia, is one
that is fraught with political issues.
Granted thr. it is always advisable for the
Administratis ~> keep its relations with Con
grc cordial as possible, it seems that the
Ac nnis ition is deferring the establishment of
ai- : policy toward Yugoslavia until Con
gress definitely makes up its collective mind as
to whether or not the United States should
support Tito.
This could be neVer.
Tito is a dictator. His government is Commu
nistic. Democracy is not the order of the day in
Yugoslavia. This is all too true.
But Tito is still the head of the Yugoslavian
government. His Communistic government is still
the established governr nt. And when a king's
hands are bloody, it d ' make him any less a
king. Foreign policy is policy between govern
ments. If the over-all goals of American foreign
policy can be enhanced by strengthening the ties
between the United States and Yugoslavia, then
by all means let the government do so.
Provided—and this is important—that the Unit
ed States does not embarrass her democratic
friends by her attitude toward Tito. A visit by
Tito would not do this. And perhaps this could
be Jhe basis of a positive policy toward Yugo
slavia .

Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, a country strad
dling the line separating the balance of power of
two opposing forces, will come to the United
States in April to take a look at the flora and
fauna of President Eisenhower's foreign aid
garden.
The independent spirit of Yugoslavia has al
ways been one of the Seven Wonders of the
Satellite World, but it has never been admired
in quite the same vein as the independent spirit
in Hungary and Poland.
Somehow, the erstwhile Tito has clung to the
cliff above Soviet Communism and at the same
time has clutched the helping hand of American
democracy from the plateau above.
His coming visit to the nation is hot being
greeted with favor in some circles. It appears
there are those who view any impending visitor
from abroad as a Searcher of Wealth. Indeed,
the Fountain of the Treasury has invariably over
flowed—on the hour, like old Faithful—for these
tourists.
But the skeptics fail to see the gain America
has received from the largesse of its coffers—l he
good will, the friendship and the increasing
strength of alliance.
To be certain, there are moments when these
three items of intrinsic value have been lacking.
Not always has the kindred spirit of debtor
creditor fired the hearts of the people who have
bathed in the hot-and-colrl running from U.S.
monetary faucets. Even England and France
have splashed a bit in their diplomatic adventures.
But, as a whole, U.S. foreign aid money has
bought a sizable number of groceries in the
market of world struggle between two ideologies.
Without it, there would be no Free World as we
know it today.
For, unfortunately, America must rely on dol
lars and material aid to win friends away from
the sinister shadow of Soviet Communism. And
those who are already won must be kept on this
side of the line.
And so, Marshal Tito will be warmly received
in Washington, D.C., by the statesmen of the
country, not because he is "one of the family,"
but because he is a maverick on tho line dividing
two opposing forces.
How far America will go in keeping up the
pretense of equilibrium is not a difficult question.
It will go only so far as it needs to go, no farther.
Tito may cling to the cliff for an eternity, and
the Free World will not shed a tear.
But one slip downward to the canyon will com
mand the attention of all. One purpose of the
visit in April will be to gauge how far down the
cliff the marshal is now—and to determine how
much attention is required to keep him hanging
on for the months ahead.
