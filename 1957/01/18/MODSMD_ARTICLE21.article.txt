## Ruins of Old Tower, Bridge Cause Rise Of Fantastic Stories 
### Rich Brown 
An old brick tower — which
looks like some remnant of Me
dieval Europe — stands forlornly
on University land near Page Mill
Road. Some distance away, near
Frenchman's Road, a crumbling
bridge spans nothing but dry
land.
And in the same vicinity aban
doned tunnels add further mys
tery to the area, a place shrouded
with stories about "The French
man." Rumors float around that
the tunnels and tower were built
"to withstand a siege by the ene
mies" of this "fugitive from jus
tice."
For those romantically-inclined
individuals who took these ru
mors as gospel truth, a big disap
pointment is in store. But the
facts of the matter contain more
drama than does the fiction.
The Frenchman, as local people
called the builder of these pres
ent-day wonders, was a victim of
most unusual circumstances •
such as rival French political
groups and a bank failure
which gave rise to the many sto
ries about him.
Born in 1822
Me was born on his family es
tate near Bordeaux, France, in
1822 and was christened Jean-
Baptiste Paulin Caperon. The
parents were wealthy landowners
and his father had been an officer
in the French army under Napo
leon.
Paulin, as he was called by his
family, was intelligent and stu
dious and he specialized in Latin,
Greek and other languages.
The year 1848 proved to be a
tragic one for the Caperon fam
ily, as well as for much of Eu
rope (which underwent several
unsuccessful revolutions), for
Paulin's parents were killed when
their carriage overturned.
The estate was divided, Paulin
receiving a large share. He soon
broke with his family since he
favored a republican form of gov
ernment for France and his rela
tives were royalists.
Book Hobby
With his understanding of
many languages, Paulin loved to
collect and translate rare books
and other documents. So avidly
did he pursue this hobby that at
the time of his death in 1890 the
collection was worth more than
a million francs.
He married Mile. Marie Elisa
Alexandrine Marissal, an or
phaned daughter of wealthy par
ents, in 1860. A son was born in
1864, followed by a daughter in
1870. Not content to sit around
on his estate, Caperon founded
his own bank in Paris and also
ran an anti-royalist newspaper,
La Liberte. At one time he was
an unsuccessful candidate for
deputy from the Department of
Gironde fa political subdivision).
In 1870 he affiliated his bank
with a Swiss banking institution,
an act which he was soon to re
gret. The head of the Swiss bank
ordered him to invest in a doubt
ful venture, one of which Cape
ron did not approve. The money
was lost—through no fault of Ca
peron.
Paid Investors
Contrary to later rumors which
said he fled to California to es
cape his investors, Caperon sold
his bank and enough property to
pay each of his investors in full.
The shock of the bank failure,
plus a heart ailment, weakened
Caperon so much that his doctor
advised him to travel. He left his
family and estate in the care of
trusted employees and went to
Brussels.
Next he visited a distant cousin
in Switzerland-at the same time
French royalists were breathing
hotly down the back of his neck.
The cousin was Baroness Bur
dette - Coutts, widow of Peter
Coutts.
Then fate played a hand. It
happened that Peter Coutts had
the same initials as Caperon. So
when Caperon decided that royal
ist pressure was so great 1 hat he
should go 1o America, Ihe baron
ess loaned him the identification
papers of her deceased husband
and he assumed that name.
He crossed the Atlantic, then
the American continent and set

tied in San Francisco in 1874. His
wife, children, aunt and governess
followed soon after. The next year
he bought a 1242-aere farm in
Santa Clara County. The farm
was later enlarged to 1440 acres.
His property was located be
tween the town of Mayfield (now
part of Palo Alto) and what is
now Lasuen Street, and extended
into the hills.
Since Coutts was going under
an assumed name, while the fam
ily retained their real name, he
had the property registered in the
name of the governess, Mile. Eu
genie Clogenson. One of the du
ties of the governess was to care
for the Frenchman's wife, who
had been an invalid since the birth
of their daughter.
Coutts didn't spare the horses
on his farm. He had built a roomy
cottage, an office-library, stables,
barns, an artificial lake with a
bridge over one end, and a brick
water storage tower.
Tunnels Bored
To supply water, tunnels were
bored through the hills to Mata
dero Creek. One of his study
rooms was located under the tank
in the water tower.
The "Ayreshire Farm," as he
named it, was prosperous. Coutts
imported thoroughbred horses
from Europe to add to those from
California. The family still has a
sterling silver platter won at the
State Fair.
The good • natured Frenchman
was popular with the people of
Mayfield. He even liked to hear
wild stories about himself and so
didn't, try to stop rumors. His
reluctance to deny false stories
was later to cause much embar
rassment for 1 his descendants.
All was going well with Coutts.
Then a stranger from San Fran
cisco appeared, said he knew of
Coutts' real identity and about his
"dishonesties" in France. "Pay me
and I'll keep quiet," said the
stranger.
Visits Consul
With tales that he was dis
honest, Coutts decided it was high
time io visit the French consul
in San Francisco and clear up the
whole mlater.
Good news awaited him from
the consul. A change in the
French government had put re
publicans in charge, and Coutts
learned that if he returned im
mediately to France he could re
gain his lands which had been
confiscated during the previous
regime.
He and his family departed
quickly in 1882, leaving the Cali
fornia holdings in charge of an
agent to be sold. It was in that
year that Leland Stanford pur
chased tlie land and added it to
his Palo Alfo Farm.
The work of the Frenchman
was not to be wasted. True, the
tunnels, water tower and bridge

have long since ceased to be any
thing hut curiosities, hut Cape
ion's house was destined for a
dislinguished career.
When Ihe University opened in
1891 its president, David Starr
Jordan, lived in (he old Ooutts
house, which he named Escondite
('of I age.
Cottage Continues
Later Eliot Blackwelder, now
emeritus professor of geology,
lived in Escondite. The cottage is
still going strong; today it is
the residence of Professor and
Mrs. William Bark.
The old tunnels have been "dis
covered" again and again by
Stanford students. Rumors of
buried treasure are eagerly ac
cepted by many, but of the count
less "expeditions" into the shafts
no one is ever known to have
found money.
Today's legend - covered tower
and bridge are nothing more than
remnants of an estate built by a
well-educated gentleman who vol
untarily exiled himself because of
his bitter' opposition to the Third
Empire of France.

An old brick tower — which
looks like some remnant of Me
dieval Europe — stands forlornly
on University land near Page Mill
Road. Some distance away, near
Frenchman's Road, a crumbling
bridge spans nothing but dry
land.
And in the same vicinity aban
doned tunnels add further mys
tery to the area, a place shrouded
with stories about "The French
man." Rumors float around that
the tunnels and tower were built
"to withstand a siege by the ene
mies" of this "fugitive from jus
tice."
For those romantically-inclined
individuals who took these ru
mors as gospel truth, a big disap
pointment is in store. But the
facts of the matter contain more
drama than does the fiction.
The Frenchman, as local people
called the builder of these pres
ent-day wonders, was a victim of
most unusual circumstances •
such as rival French political
groups and a bank failure
which gave rise to the many sto
ries about him.
Born in 1822
Me was born on his family es
tate near Bordeaux, France, in
1822 and was christened Jean-
Baptiste Paulin Caperon. The
parents were wealthy landowners
and his father had been an officer
in the French army under Napo
leon.
Paulin, as he was called by his
family, was intelligent and stu
dious and he specialized in Latin,
Greek and other languages.
The year 1848 proved to be a
tragic one for the Caperon fam
ily, as well as for much of Eu
rope (which underwent several
unsuccessful revolutions), for
Paulin's parents were killed when
their carriage overturned.
The estate was divided, Paulin
receiving a large share. He soon
broke with his family since he
favored a republican form of gov
ernment for France and his rela
tives were royalists.
Book Hobby
With his understanding of
many languages, Paulin loved to
collect and translate rare books
and other documents. So avidly
did he pursue this hobby that at
the time of his death in 1890 the
collection was worth more than
a million francs.
He married Mile. Marie Elisa
Alexandrine Marissal, an or
phaned daughter of wealthy par
ents, in 1860. A son was born in
1864, followed by a daughter in
1870. Not content to sit around
on his estate, Caperon founded
his own bank in Paris and also
ran an anti-royalist newspaper,
La Liberte. At one time he was
an unsuccessful candidate for
deputy from the Department of
Gironde fa political subdivision).
In 1870 he affiliated his bank
with a Swiss banking institution,
an act which he was soon to re
gret. The head of the Swiss bank
ordered him to invest in a doubt
ful venture, one of which Cape
ron did not approve. The money
was lost—through no fault of Ca
peron.
Paid Investors
Contrary to later rumors which
said he fled to California to es
cape his investors, Caperon sold
his bank and enough property to
pay each of his investors in full.
The shock of the bank failure,
plus a heart ailment, weakened
Caperon so much that his doctor
advised him to travel. He left his
family and estate in the care of
trusted employees and went to
Brussels.
Next he visited a distant cousin
in Switzerland-at the same time
French royalists were breathing
hotly down the back of his neck.
The cousin was Baroness Bur
dette - Coutts, widow of Peter
Coutts.
Then fate played a hand. It
happened that Peter Coutts had
the same initials as Caperon. So
when Caperon decided that royal
ist pressure was so great 1 hat he
should go 1o America, Ihe baron
ess loaned him the identification
papers of her deceased husband
and he assumed that name.
He crossed the Atlantic, then
the American continent and set

tied in San Francisco in 1874. His
wife, children, aunt and governess
followed soon after. The next year
he bought a 1242-aere farm in
Santa Clara County. The farm
was later enlarged to 1440 acres.
His property was located be
tween the town of Mayfield (now
part of Palo Alto) and what is
now Lasuen Street, and extended
into the hills.
Since Coutts was going under
an assumed name, while the fam
ily retained their real name, he
had the property registered in the
name of the governess, Mile. Eu
genie Clogenson. One of the du
ties of the governess was to care
for the Frenchman's wife, who
had been an invalid since the birth
of their daughter.
Coutts didn't spare the horses
on his farm. He had built a roomy
cottage, an office-library, stables,
barns, an artificial lake with a
bridge over one end, and a brick
water storage tower.
Tunnels Bored
To supply water, tunnels were
bored through the hills to Mata
dero Creek. One of his study
rooms was located under the tank
in the water tower.
The "Ayreshire Farm," as he
named it, was prosperous. Coutts
imported thoroughbred horses
from Europe to add to those from
California. The family still has a
sterling silver platter won at the
State Fair.
The good • natured Frenchman
was popular with the people of
Mayfield. He even liked to hear
wild stories about himself and so
didn't, try to stop rumors. His
reluctance to deny false stories
was later to cause much embar
rassment for 1 his descendants.
All was going well with Coutts.
Then a stranger from San Fran
cisco appeared, said he knew of
Coutts' real identity and about his
"dishonesties" in France. "Pay me
and I'll keep quiet," said the
stranger.
Visits Consul
With tales that he was dis
honest, Coutts decided it was high
time io visit the French consul
in San Francisco and clear up the
whole mlater.
Good news awaited him from
the consul. A change in the
French government had put re
publicans in charge, and Coutts
learned that if he returned im
mediately to France he could re
gain his lands which had been
confiscated during the previous
regime.
He and his family departed
quickly in 1882, leaving the Cali
fornia holdings in charge of an
agent to be sold. It was in that
year that Leland Stanford pur
chased tlie land and added it to
his Palo Alfo Farm.
The work of the Frenchman
was not to be wasted. True, the
tunnels, water tower and bridge

have long since ceased to be any
thing hut curiosities, hut Cape
ion's house was destined for a
dislinguished career.
When Ihe University opened in
1891 its president, David Starr
Jordan, lived in (he old Ooutts
house, which he named Escondite
('of I age.
Cottage Continues
Later Eliot Blackwelder, now
emeritus professor of geology,
lived in Escondite. The cottage is
still going strong; today it is
the residence of Professor and
Mrs. William Bark.
The old tunnels have been "dis
covered" again and again by
Stanford students. Rumors of
buried treasure are eagerly ac
cepted by many, but of the count
less "expeditions" into the shafts
no one is ever known to have
found money.

An old brick tower — which

on University land near Page Mill
Road. Some distance away, near
Frenchman's Road, a crumbling
bridge spans nothing but dry
land.
And in the same vicinity aban
doned tunnels add further mys
tery to the area, a place shrouded
with stories about "The French
man." Rumors float around that
the tunnels and tower were built
"to withstand a siege by the ene
mies" of this "fugitive from jus
tice."
For those romantically-inclined
individuals who took these ru
mors as gospel truth, a big disap
pointment is in store. But the
facts of the matter contain more
drama than does the fiction.
The Frenchman, as local people
called the builder of these pres
ent-day wonders, was a victim of
most unusual circumstances •
such as rival French political
groups and a bank failure
which gave rise to the many sto
ries about him.
Born in 1822
Me was born on his family es
tate near Bordeaux, France, in
1822 and was christened Jean-
Baptiste Paulin Caperon. The
parents were wealthy landowners
and his father had been an officer
in the French army under Napo
leon.
Paulin, as he was called by his
family, was intelligent and stu
dious and he specialized in Latin,
Greek and other languages.
The year 1848 proved to be a
tragic one for the Caperon fam
ily, as well as for much of Eu
rope (which underwent several
unsuccessful revolutions), for
Paulin's parents were killed when
their carriage overturned.
The estate was divided, Paulin
receiving a large share. He soon
broke with his family since he
favored a republican form of gov
ernment for France and his rela
tives were royalists.
Book Hobby
With his understanding of
many languages, Paulin loved to
collect and translate rare books
and other documents. So avidly
did he pursue this hobby that at
the time of his death in 1890 the
collection was worth more than
a million francs.
He married Mile. Marie Elisa
Alexandrine Marissal, an or
phaned daughter of wealthy par
ents, in 1860. A son was born in
1864, followed by a daughter in
1870. Not content to sit around
on his estate, Caperon founded
his own bank in Paris and also
ran an anti-royalist newspaper,
La Liberte. At one time he was
an unsuccessful candidate for
deputy from the Department of
Gironde fa political subdivision).
In 1870 he affiliated his bank
with a Swiss banking institution,
an act which he was soon to re
gret. The head of the Swiss bank
ordered him to invest in a doubt
ful venture, one of which Cape
ron did not approve. The money
was lost—through no fault of Ca
peron.
Paid Investors
Contrary to later rumors which
said he fled to California to es
cape his investors, Caperon sold
his bank and enough property to
pay each of his investors in full.
The shock of the bank failure,
plus a heart ailment, weakened
Caperon so much that his doctor
advised him to travel. He left his
family and estate in the care of
trusted employees and went to
Brussels.
Next he visited a distant cousin
in Switzerland-at the same time
French royalists were breathing
hotly down the back of his neck.
The cousin was Baroness Bur
dette - Coutts, widow of Peter
Coutts.
Then fate played a hand. It
happened that Peter Coutts had
the same initials as Caperon. So
when Caperon decided that royal
ist pressure was so great 1 hat he
should go 1o America, Ihe baron
ess loaned him the identification
papers of her deceased husband
and he assumed that name.
He crossed the Atlantic, then
the American continent and set

tied in San Francisco in 1874. His
wife, children, aunt and governess
followed soon after. The next year
he bought a 1242-aere farm in
Santa Clara County. The farm
was later enlarged to 1440 acres.
His property was located be
tween the town of Mayfield (now
part of Palo Alto) and what is
now Lasuen Street, and extended
into the hills.
Since Coutts was going under
an assumed name, while the fam
ily retained their real name, he
had the property registered in the
name of the governess, Mile. Eu
genie Clogenson. One of the du
ties of the governess was to care
for the Frenchman's wife, who
had been an invalid since the birth
of their daughter.
Coutts didn't spare the horses
on his farm. He had built a roomy
cottage, an office-library, stables,
barns, an artificial lake with a
bridge over one end, and a brick
water storage tower.
Tunnels Bored
To supply water, tunnels were
bored through the hills to Mata
dero Creek. One of his study
rooms was located under the tank
in the water tower.
The "Ayreshire Farm," as he
named it, was prosperous. Coutts
imported thoroughbred horses
from Europe to add to those from
California. The family still has a
sterling silver platter won at the
State Fair.
The good • natured Frenchman
was popular with the people of
Mayfield. He even liked to hear
wild stories about himself and so
didn't, try to stop rumors. His
reluctance to deny false stories
was later to cause much embar
rassment for 1 his descendants.
All was going well with Coutts.
Then a stranger from San Fran
cisco appeared, said he knew of
Coutts' real identity and about his
"dishonesties" in France. "Pay me
and I'll keep quiet," said the
stranger.
Visits Consul
With tales that he was dis
honest, Coutts decided it was high
time io visit the French consul
in San Francisco and clear up the
whole mlater.
Good news awaited him from
the consul. A change in the
French government had put re
publicans in charge, and Coutts
learned that if he returned im
mediately to France he could re
gain his lands which had been
confiscated during the previous
regime.
He and his family departed
quickly in 1882, leaving the Cali
fornia holdings in charge of an
agent to be sold. It was in that
year that Leland Stanford pur
chased tlie land and added it to
his Palo Alfo Farm.
The work of the Frenchman
was not to be wasted. True, the
tunnels, water tower and bridge

have long since ceased to be any
thing hut curiosities, hut Cape
ion's house was destined for a
dislinguished career.

An old brick tower — which

And in the same vicinity aban

with stories about "The French
man." Rumors float around that
the tunnels and tower were built
"to withstand a siege by the ene

For those romantically-inclined
individuals who took these ru

The Frenchman, as local people
called the builder of these pres
ent-day wonders, was a victim of
most unusual circumstances •
such as rival French political
groups and a bank failure
which gave rise to the many sto
ries about him.
Born in 1822
Me was born on his family es
tate near Bordeaux, France, in
1822 and was christened Jean-
Baptiste Paulin Caperon. The
parents were wealthy landowners
and his father had been an officer
in the French army under Napo
leon.
Paulin, as he was called by his
family, was intelligent and stu
dious and he specialized in Latin,
Greek and other languages.
The year 1848 proved to be a
tragic one for the Caperon fam
ily, as well as for much of Eu
rope (which underwent several
unsuccessful revolutions), for
Paulin's parents were killed when
their carriage overturned.
The estate was divided, Paulin
receiving a large share. He soon
broke with his family since he
favored a republican form of gov
ernment for France and his rela
tives were royalists.
Book Hobby
With his understanding of
many languages, Paulin loved to
collect and translate rare books
and other documents. So avidly
did he pursue this hobby that at
the time of his death in 1890 the
collection was worth more than
a million francs.
He married Mile. Marie Elisa
Alexandrine Marissal, an or
phaned daughter of wealthy par
ents, in 1860. A son was born in
1864, followed by a daughter in
1870. Not content to sit around
on his estate, Caperon founded
his own bank in Paris and also
ran an anti-royalist newspaper,
La Liberte. At one time he was
an unsuccessful candidate for
deputy from the Department of
Gironde fa political subdivision).
In 1870 he affiliated his bank
with a Swiss banking institution,
an act which he was soon to re
gret. The head of the Swiss bank
ordered him to invest in a doubt
ful venture, one of which Cape
ron did not approve. The money
was lost—through no fault of Ca
peron.
Paid Investors
Contrary to later rumors which
said he fled to California to es
cape his investors, Caperon sold
his bank and enough property to
pay each of his investors in full.
The shock of the bank failure,
plus a heart ailment, weakened
Caperon so much that his doctor
advised him to travel. He left his
family and estate in the care of
trusted employees and went to
Brussels.
Next he visited a distant cousin
in Switzerland-at the same time
French royalists were breathing
hotly down the back of his neck.
The cousin was Baroness Bur
dette - Coutts, widow of Peter
Coutts.
Then fate played a hand. It
happened that Peter Coutts had
the same initials as Caperon. So
when Caperon decided that royal
ist pressure was so great 1 hat he
should go 1o America, Ihe baron
ess loaned him the identification
papers of her deceased husband
and he assumed that name.
He crossed the Atlantic, then
the American continent and set

tied in San Francisco in 1874. His
wife, children, aunt and governess
followed soon after. The next year
he bought a 1242-aere farm in
Santa Clara County. The farm
was later enlarged to 1440 acres.
His property was located be
tween the town of Mayfield (now
part of Palo Alto) and what is
now Lasuen Street, and extended
into the hills.
Since Coutts was going under
an assumed name, while the fam
ily retained their real name, he
had the property registered in the
name of the governess, Mile. Eu
genie Clogenson. One of the du
ties of the governess was to care
for the Frenchman's wife, who
had been an invalid since the birth
of their daughter.
Coutts didn't spare the horses
on his farm. He had built a roomy
cottage, an office-library, stables,
barns, an artificial lake with a
bridge over one end, and a brick
water storage tower.
Tunnels Bored
To supply water, tunnels were
bored through the hills to Mata
dero Creek. One of his study
rooms was located under the tank
in the water tower.
The "Ayreshire Farm," as he
named it, was prosperous. Coutts
imported thoroughbred horses
from Europe to add to those from
California. The family still has a
sterling silver platter won at the
State Fair.
The good • natured Frenchman
was popular with the people of
Mayfield. He even liked to hear
wild stories about himself and so
didn't, try to stop rumors. His
reluctance to deny false stories
was later to cause much embar
rassment for 1 his descendants.
All was going well with Coutts.
Then a stranger from San Fran
cisco appeared, said he knew of
Coutts' real identity and about his
"dishonesties" in France. "Pay me
and I'll keep quiet," said the
stranger.
Visits Consul
With tales that he was dis
honest, Coutts decided it was high
time io visit the French consul
in San Francisco and clear up the
whole mlater.
Good news awaited him from
the consul. A change in the
French government had put re
publicans in charge, and Coutts
learned that if he returned im
mediately to France he could re
gain his lands which had been
confiscated during the previous
regime.
He and his family departed
quickly in 1882, leaving the Cali
fornia holdings in charge of an
agent to be sold. It was in that
year that Leland Stanford pur
chased tlie land and added it to
his Palo Alfo Farm.
The work of the Frenchman
