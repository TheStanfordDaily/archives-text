# Tippy Dye's Powerful Huskies Invade Farm to Battle Scrappy Card Makers
## Haga Reported Ready After Injuring Ankle; Indians Seek Upset 
### Bob Payne 
Coach Tippy Dye brings his
young, lull and t a tented Washing
lon Huskies to ihe Stanford Pa
vilion tonight to give local fans a
look ui the I earn many are cull
ing the best in the Pacific Coast
Conference. Came time is 8:30.
Wailing for the purple-shirts
! from Ihe Northwest is u never
suy-die band of Stanford Indians,
Dick Hugu included, who will be
| shooting for another big upset,
llugu is expected to start against
the the Huskies, apparently re
covered from the sprained ankle
which sidelined him Tuesday.
Husky mentor Dye, now in his
I seventh season ut Seuttle, holds
(one of Ihe most enviable coach
t ing jobs in ihe nation. For on
j ibis learn which is so highly rated
; he bus u starting five of three
| sophomores and Iwo juniors and
I a lop-notch reserve crew of three
sophomores, four juniors and a
; lone senior. N<{J only this, but
I the Huskies have an unbeaten
freshman team which has been
i averuging HO points a game.
Hoin Sets Record
Bruno Boin, the (3-9 hooker who
set a PCC scoring record for
sophomores last season with 277
points, is Ihe muinspring of the
Washington offense. Teuming
with him to give he Huskies the
conference's most loured one-two
'demolition squad is 0-7 sopho
; more Doug Smart. Out front,
I Dye culls on two more rookies,
lit lie Johnny Puriseuu and sharp
shooting Don Dorlund. Unsung
Istalwurt Bill Study teams with
Smurt ut forwurd.
For bench strength Dye has
such performers us Johnny Tuft,
just recently eligible, who was a
starter lule lust seuson; co-cap
tuin Don Sunitsch, the lone sen
ior, and G-6 sophomore Jim Greer,
capable of filling in for either
Smurt or Boin.
But despite this awesome ar
ray of budding young talent, no
body is selling this gume down
the river and pucked houses are
expected to view a pair of thrill
ers. Muking up for whut muy be
lucking with terrific hustle, fight,
and determination, Stunford aims
to give the Huskies the same
treatment Oregon State received
two weeks ago. On that occusion
the heuvily fuvored Beuvers were
lucky to escape with a split.
Bond, Neumann Sparkplugs
Bill Bond and Paul Neumann
have been the sparkplugs of the
I scrappy Cards all year, both of
-5 fensively and defensively. Bond,
1 possessor of one of the gume's
deadliest jump shots, has been
i the man who starts the rallies
with his clutch shooting and ball
steuling. Neumann, a sophomore
destined for reul stardom, fin
ishes ihem . . . as he did in sink
ing OSC with a last-minule shot.
Coach Howie Dallmar expects
to start the same five which
opened against OSC and Califpr
niu, provided Haga is sound. This
would have Bond and Haga at
forwards, Clint Waring at center,
and Neumann and Hap Wagner
at guards.
Washington came out of its
preseason slate with only a 3-6
record, but on the schedule were
such national powers as Kansas
and Oklahoma A&M. The Hus
| kies finished second to host OSC
! in the Fur West Classic but are
! ruled aheud of the Beavers now.
Seasoned aguinst the best and
shaking the signs of greenness,
| the Huskies opened PCC play by
j taking u puir of close decisions
I from Southern California in Los

Angeles. Last week they shel
lucked a plucky Idaho five twice.
This was the same Idaho team
which had sixth-ranked UCLA
beaten twice, only to lose by n
single point both times.
Koin Leading Scorer
Boin hus scored 78 points in
conference pluy und Smurt hus
tunked 09, both performunces
fulling below their season's rec
ords. Smurt has averaged 10 re
bounds a game.
Puriseuu, Dorlund und Study,
becoming more polished with ev
ery gume, leuve Ihe Husky lineup
virtuully devoid of u weuk spot.
Dorlund hus hit on 10 of 17 tries
from the field and 13 of 14 gift
tosses.
The going looks rough for the
Curds. They huve no height to
mutch the Huskies . . . only fight.
And fight will be the story if
Stanford wins. It's happened be
fore.

DICK lIAGA
Ready for Action
Coach Tippy Dye brings his
young, lull and t a tented Washing
lon Huskies to ihe Stanford Pa
vilion tonight to give local fans a
look ui the I earn many are cull
ing the best in the Pacific Coast
Conference. Came time is 8:30.
Wailing for the purple-shirts
! from Ihe Northwest is u never
suy-die band of Stanford Indians,
Dick Hugu included, who will be
| shooting for another big upset,
llugu is expected to start against
the the Huskies, apparently re
covered from the sprained ankle
which sidelined him Tuesday.
Husky mentor Dye, now in his
I seventh season ut Seuttle, holds
(one of Ihe most enviable coach
t ing jobs in ihe nation. For on
j ibis learn which is so highly rated
; he bus u starting five of three
| sophomores and Iwo juniors and
I a lop-notch reserve crew of three
sophomores, four juniors and a
; lone senior. N<{J only this, but
I the Huskies have an unbeaten
freshman team which has been
i averuging HO points a game.
Hoin Sets Record
Bruno Boin, the (3-9 hooker who
set a PCC scoring record for
sophomores last season with 277
points, is Ihe muinspring of the
Washington offense. Teuming
with him to give he Huskies the
conference's most loured one-two
'demolition squad is 0-7 sopho
; more Doug Smart. Out front,
I Dye culls on two more rookies,
lit lie Johnny Puriseuu and sharp
shooting Don Dorlund. Unsung
Istalwurt Bill Study teams with
Smurt ut forwurd.
For bench strength Dye has
such performers us Johnny Tuft,
just recently eligible, who was a
starter lule lust seuson; co-cap
tuin Don Sunitsch, the lone sen
ior, and G-6 sophomore Jim Greer,
capable of filling in for either
Smurt or Boin.
But despite this awesome ar
ray of budding young talent, no
body is selling this gume down
the river and pucked houses are
expected to view a pair of thrill
ers. Muking up for whut muy be
lucking with terrific hustle, fight,
and determination, Stunford aims
to give the Huskies the same
treatment Oregon State received
two weeks ago. On that occusion
the heuvily fuvored Beuvers were
lucky to escape with a split.
Bond, Neumann Sparkplugs
Bill Bond and Paul Neumann
have been the sparkplugs of the
I scrappy Cards all year, both of
-5 fensively and defensively. Bond,
1 possessor of one of the gume's
deadliest jump shots, has been
i the man who starts the rallies
with his clutch shooting and ball
steuling. Neumann, a sophomore
destined for reul stardom, fin
ishes ihem . . . as he did in sink
ing OSC with a last-minule shot.
Coach Howie Dallmar expects
to start the same five which
opened against OSC and Califpr
niu, provided Haga is sound. This
would have Bond and Haga at
forwards, Clint Waring at center,
and Neumann and Hap Wagner
at guards.
Washington came out of its
preseason slate with only a 3-6
record, but on the schedule were
such national powers as Kansas
and Oklahoma A&M. The Hus

j taking u puir of close decisions

Coach Tippy Dye brings his
young, lull and t a tented Washing
lon Huskies to ihe Stanford Pa
vilion tonight to give local fans a
look ui the I earn many are cull
ing the best in the Pacific Coast
Conference. Came time is 8:30.
Wailing for the purple-shirts
! from Ihe Northwest is u never
suy-die band of Stanford Indians,
Dick Hugu included, who will be
| shooting for another big upset,
llugu is expected to start against
the the Huskies, apparently re
covered from the sprained ankle
which sidelined him Tuesday.
Husky mentor Dye, now in his
I seventh season ut Seuttle, holds
(one of Ihe most enviable coach
t ing jobs in ihe nation. For on
j ibis learn which is so highly rated
; he bus u starting five of three
| sophomores and Iwo juniors and
I a lop-notch reserve crew of three
sophomores, four juniors and a
; lone senior. N<{J only this, but
I the Huskies have an unbeaten
freshman team which has been
i averuging HO points a game.
Hoin Sets Record
Bruno Boin, the (3-9 hooker who
set a PCC scoring record for
sophomores last season with 277
points, is Ihe muinspring of the
Washington offense. Teuming
with him to give he Huskies the
conference's most loured one-two
'demolition squad is 0-7 sopho
; more Doug Smart. Out front,
I Dye culls on two more rookies,
lit lie Johnny Puriseuu and sharp
shooting Don Dorlund. Unsung
Istalwurt Bill Study teams with
Smurt ut forwurd.
For bench strength Dye has
such performers us Johnny Tuft,
just recently eligible, who was a
starter lule lust seuson; co-cap
tuin Don Sunitsch, the lone sen
ior, and G-6 sophomore Jim Greer,
capable of filling in for either
Smurt or Boin.
But despite this awesome ar
ray of budding young talent, no
body is selling this gume down
the river and pucked houses are
expected to view a pair of thrill
ers. Muking up for whut muy be
lucking with terrific hustle, fight,
and determination, Stunford aims
to give the Huskies the same
treatment Oregon State received
two weeks ago. On that occusion
the heuvily fuvored Beuvers were
lucky to escape with a split.
Bond, Neumann Sparkplugs
Bill Bond and Paul Neumann
have been the sparkplugs of the
I scrappy Cards all year, both of
-5 fensively and defensively. Bond,
1 possessor of one of the gume's
deadliest jump shots, has been
i the man who starts the rallies
with his clutch shooting and ball
steuling. Neumann, a sophomore
destined for reul stardom, fin
ishes ihem . . . as he did in sink
ing OSC with a last-minule shot.
Coach Howie Dallmar expects
to start the same five which
opened against OSC and Califpr
niu, provided Haga is sound. This
would have Bond and Haga at
