# Freshmen, JV's Clash In Prelim Tonight; Byles Out With Sprain
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team will be without the services
of play-maker Mason Byles when
they tackle the Stanford Braves
tonight and Modesto JC on Sat
urday. Both games are scheduled
for 0 p.m., as preliminaries to the
varsity-Washington tilts.
Byles sprained his ankle in
practice Tuesday and will he re
placed by 5-7 John Stabler at the
guard position. Stabler is a "fast
improving" man according to
fi'osh mentor Dick Clegg. With
this exception Clegg has said that
his starting lineup would remain
unchanged.
Practice sessions all week have
been devoted to lining up offen
sive plays with an eye on out-of
bounds tactics. A defensive meas
ure which the frosh concentrated
on was backboard-clearing.
"No special measures" was [
Clegg's comment on his team's j
preparation for Friday's tussle |
with the Braves. "Also," he add-1
ed, "we haven't done anything
unusual for Modesto."
Frosh eyes will be on 6-5 center .
Ron Thomas when the Modesto
JC quintet invades the Pavilion I
on Saturday. Thomas is the J
stand-out in the MJS lineup.
Close behind him is Frank D'Gio
vanni, whose jump shots from ,
outside have aided the visitors all j
year.
Against a front line which aver
ages 6-5, Clegg feels his men will
have a battle on their hands.
"We'll have to battle to control
the boards."
Modesto plays a ball â€¢ control
game and doesn't use a fast
break. The team is well balanced
and strong on defense. Coach
Clegg noted that Modesto was at
"good team" and that his squad's i
game with them would be "close." j
