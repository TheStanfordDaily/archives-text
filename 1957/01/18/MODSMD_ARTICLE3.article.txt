## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP) â€”
Speaker Sam Rayburn came out
today against any general tax cuts
this year even if the Democratic
Congress succeeds in trimming
President Eisenhower's record
peacetime-spending budget.
Two years ago the powerful
Democratic leader led the unsuc
cessful fight to enact a tax cut
over Eisenhower's opposition.
But Rayburn joined the Presi
dent in opposing a tax cut under
present conditions. Eisenhower
rules out any over-all tax cut in
his $71.8 billion budget and spe
cifically calls for extension of
sales and corporate tax rates, now
scheduled to drop April 1.
Economy - minded congressmen
promised every effort to cut the
President's budget, but apparently
saw little hope of making substan
tial reductions.
However, Sen. Harry F. Byrd
(I)-Va.), the Senate's loading econ
omy advocate, arose in the cham
ber yesterday Lo praise Treasury
Secretary George M. Humphrey
for urging Congress to trim the
budget if this can be done safely.
While Humphrey's statement
that the budget can be cut sur
prised some reporters, Adminis
tration sources said there was no
disagreement between the secre
tary and the Chief Executive over
lite nerd to reduce spending and
taxes as soon as possible.
