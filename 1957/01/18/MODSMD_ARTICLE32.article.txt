### Dick Barnes 
Positions on the Stanford track team, places in the track room
and interclass supremacy will all be on the line tomorrow at 1 p.m.
when the Indians' winter track and field championships are held on
Angell Field.
A combined freshman-senior team will face the sophomore-junior

outfit for scoring purposes.
Frank Herrmann will captain the
first team, with Chris Plain lead
ing the latter squad.
Coaches Payton Jordan and
Floyd Strain have instituted sev
eral sets of performance stand
ards for use during the season.
In order to hold membership on
the team, athletes must better a
basic requirement in their event.
They must then top a stiller
standard to gain a place in the
I team's private locker room. Since
J a man loses his standing any lime
! he falls below the requirements,
tomorrow's 75 or more competi
tors will be going all out.
The tightest event could well
: be the 220-yard dash. Six men
j Herrmann, Jim Easter, Don Che-
I sarek, Norman Pease, Terry Cad
fly and Jack Groat have each
registered a best mark of either
22.4 or 22.5.
The quarter mile is expected 1o
be nearly as close with any of
eight men a possible winner. Chc
sarek, Groat, Chuck I nee, Hob
Hyde and Bill Carls have all run
within one second of each other.
Three frosh, Chuck McKenney,
Leon Campbell and Bob Besse,
are also in the running.
Kent Hansen, the Tribe's 200-
foot-plus javelin man, will head
the entries in the spear event.
Good marks are expected in tho
880, mile and two-mile, although
it is still undecided just who will
lie running where. The team
captains have both been keeping
some entries a secret in efforts
to outwit the other. Bob Monziiv
go, Ernie Cunliffe, Ralph Love
and Maury Graves will be the
men to watch most, no malter
what event thpy may go in.
Field events will open the meet
at 1, with the first race set to go
