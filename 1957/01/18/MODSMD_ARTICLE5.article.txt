# Social Regulations Progress to Meet Women's Needs

plaining women's social regulations.)

Applying a set of uniform regulations to a group as large and
diverse as the women students at Stanford presents a continuous
challenge. Trying to make the social standards fit the consensus
of the women's opinions, and trying to make the rules af>ply in a
variety of living situations, is the job of the AWS Social Regulations
Committee and the Women's Council.
Perhaps tracing the beginnings and application of a fictional
rule will demonstrate the machinery of these groups most effec
tively.
A particular group of women might feel that they should be
allowed to have male visitors in their residence living area until
1:30 on week end nights. (This actually was tried many years ago.)
The group then could discuss the plan in house meeting and decide
to ask their AWS representative to bring the question up at the
next AWS Cabinet meeting. At this meeting, the cabinet would
probably refer the question to the Social Regulations Committee,
which would consider and evaluate the system and propose changes.
The committee would perhaps take an opinion poll and would
consult persons who would be affected, such as dormitory directors,
resident assistants and night assistants. If the plan seemed feasible,
and widespread interest in its passage were shown, AWS could pass

it into law, as a legislative body representing all women students,
or, if the issue proved to be controversial, would call a referendum
and place it in a general election.
If the proposal passed, it would be incorporated into the social
regulations and included in the yearly revision of the Social Stand
ards handbook.
The machinery of enforcement is more complicated. If a woman
violates a social regulation, she is given the appropriate penalty
outlined in the Social "Regulations book by the Council representa
tive in her living group. Each residence has such a representative,
who records the late leaves and attends a weekly meeting with the
Women's Council.
At these meetings, questions raised in the living groups about
social regulations are discussed, and the representatives bring the
results of these discussions back to the residence house meetings.
Council also decides the borderline cases betwen technicals and
offenses which the representatives bring to them.
If a woman feels that the penalty given her is unjust or unfair,
she is encouraged to appeal her case to the Council. Every Monday
night Women's Council hears appeals—a trip to the Council office
is all that is necessary to be placed on the docket.
Council itself is an elected body of five women students. Two
are elected in the autumn and three in the spring of each year.
Besides meeting with area representatives and hearing appeals,
members of the Council meet with the Fundamental Standard Com

mission, the AVVS Cabinet and the Social Regulations Committee.
With the members of Men's Council, they make up the Judicial
Council, which hears all Honor Code cases.
In hearing a case, Women's Council acts as a regular judicial
body. First of all, they refer to the Social Standards handbook. If
the question is not adequately covered there, they turn to the "policy
booklet"—an unorganized collection of previous decisions, where
the reasoning of the Council on previous similar cases can be con
sulted.
As in common-law tradition, the Council is not bound by previous
decisions, but an attempt is made to preserve consistency through
the years in reoccurring situations. When a new situation arises,
the Council tries, through group discussion, to reach a consensus
on the proper method of handling the case.
If a student is still unsatisfied after a Council hearing, his case
is reappealable through the administration.
The whole system of social regulations and their enforcement
is a fluid one, and changes are made as the times and the women
students themselves have changed. The system presupposes the
ability for growth—it is expected that the senior with unlimited
I:3o's will be more able to apportion her time wisely than the first
quarter freshman with two late leaves a week.
The liberality of Stanford's regulations, as compared with other
universities, is based on the idea that only where there Is a chance
for error is there room to succeed.

and place it in a general election.
If the proposal passed, it would be incorporated into the social
regulations and included in the yearly revision of the Social Stand
ards handbook.
The machinery of enforcement is more complicated. If a woman
violates a social regulation, she is given the appropriate penalty
outlined in the Social "Regulations book by the Council representa
tive in her living group. Each residence has such a representative,
who records the late leaves and attends a weekly meeting with the
Women's Council.
At these meetings, questions raised in the living groups about
social regulations are discussed, and the representatives bring the
results of these discussions back to the residence house meetings.
Council also decides the borderline cases betwen technicals and
offenses which the representatives bring to them.
If a woman feels that the penalty given her is unjust or unfair,
she is encouraged to appeal her case to the Council. Every Monday
night Women's Council hears appeals—a trip to the Council office
is all that is necessary to be placed on the docket.
Council itself is an elected body of five women students. Two
are elected in the autumn and three in the spring of each year.
Besides meeting with area representatives and hearing appeals,
members of the Council meet with the Fundamental Standard Com

mission, the AVVS Cabinet and the Social Regulations Committee.
With the members of Men's Council, they make up the Judicial
Council, which hears all Honor Code cases.
In hearing a case, Women's Council acts as a regular judicial
body. First of all, they refer to the Social Standards handbook. If
the question is not adequately covered there, they turn to the "policy
booklet"—an unorganized collection of previous decisions, where
the reasoning of the Council on previous similar cases can be con
sulted.
As in common-law tradition, the Council is not bound by previous
decisions, but an attempt is made to preserve consistency through
the years in reoccurring situations. When a new situation arises,
the Council tries, through group discussion, to reach a consensus
on the proper method of handling the case.
If a student is still unsatisfied after a Council hearing, his case
is reappealable through the administration.
The whole system of social regulations and their enforcement
is a fluid one, and changes are made as the times and the women
students themselves have changed. The system presupposes the
ability for growth—it is expected that the senior with unlimited
I:3o's will be more able to apportion her time wisely than the first
quarter freshman with two late leaves a week.
The liberality of Stanford's regulations, as compared with other
universities, is based on the idea that only where there Is a chance
for error is there room to succeed.

Applying a set of uniform regulations to a group as large and
diverse as the women students at Stanford presents a continuous
challenge. Trying to make the social standards fit the consensus
of the women's opinions, and trying to make the rules af>ply in a
variety of living situations, is the job of the AWS Social Regulations
Committee and the Women's Council.
Perhaps tracing the beginnings and application of a fictional
rule will demonstrate the machinery of these groups most effec
tively.
A particular group of women might feel that they should be
allowed to have male visitors in their residence living area until
1:30 on week end nights. (This actually was tried many years ago.)
The group then could discuss the plan in house meeting and decide
to ask their AWS representative to bring the question up at the
next AWS Cabinet meeting. At this meeting, the cabinet would
probably refer the question to the Social Regulations Committee,
which would consider and evaluate the system and propose changes.
The committee would perhaps take an opinion poll and would
consult persons who would be affected, such as dormitory directors,
resident assistants and night assistants. If the plan seemed feasible,
and widespread interest in its passage were shown, AWS could pass

it into law, as a legislative body representing all women students,
or, if the issue proved to be controversial, would call a referendum
and place it in a general election.
