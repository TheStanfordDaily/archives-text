# Poland dives Gomulka Huge Confidence Vote
## Titoite Triumphs As Church Implies Official Backing 
### 
WARSAW, Jan. 20 (UP)—Po
land today gave "Titoite" Commu
nist leader Wladyslaw Gomulka i
huge vote of confidence in "free"
nation • wide parliamentary ele<
tions which could settle Poland'.*
future as an independent state
Although no official returns
were in, it was apparent by mid
night that Gomulka would get a
huge majority
There had been fears that h°
would not: But a combination of
church appeals to the nation to
vote—-an indirect endorsement of
Gomulka—and dire w ami n . 3
from Gomulka of what would hap
pen if there was an anti-Commu
nist trend apparently swung the
day for the party.
The ligures of voting strength
will not be made public until to
morrow, and the final elect :
returns will not be made n
officially Until Tuesday
Limited Choice
The election $et-up was so de
vised that the Polish voter had a
limited freedom of choice - - but
nothing like that in Western de
mocracies.
The Polish voter could have re
frained from supporting the Com
munist-backed candidates, and he
could have boycotted the elections
altogether.
But reports from voting places
showed that the turnout was
large. They also showed that a
majority of the voters were givin /
their support to the top candidates
on the ballot. Most of them be
long to Gomulka's Polish United
Workers party, the Communist
party of Poland.
Heavy Turnout
The turnout wa3 heavy. But,
despite increased security precau
tions, there were few reported i>;
cidents.
Gomulka, once imprisoned b,
the Soviets for "Titoist tendon
cies," has remained relatively in
dependent of Moscow control sincr
his recent return to power in
Poland.
At stake were 429 seats in thr
Sejm (parliament), to be filled
from a total of 720 candidate?.
All belonged to the "Nation ■
Front" composed of hand-picked
representatives of the Un it e :
Workers (Communist) party, th<
Peasants party and the Demon it
ic party.
Indications were that Poland
had little choice but to vote for
Gomulka and his party
Until last week, it had appear-d
there might be a strong anti-Con
munist vote. But then the churcii
in this predominantly Cathob
country appealed for a big vot •
turnout—an announcement take 1
to mean support for Gomulkc>
