WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (UP)
Interior Secretary Fred A. Sea
t«»n said today he believes the ad
ministration's $76 million drought
relief program "is sufficient."
Sea ton, interviewed on the
CBS-TV program "Face the Na
tion," said that President Eisen
hower would give "sympathetic"
consideration to any appeals for
additional government aid.
But he said he was not aware
of "any crying demand from the
people of that area to go beyond
the point" that Eisenhower pro
posed in his recent budget mes
sage.
Sea ton, who accompanied Ei
senhower on his tour of the
Southwestern drought area,
pointed out that the program of
direct relief is being augmented
by a "gigantic" water conserva
tion and reclamation program al
ready under way.
Ile conceded farmers and
ranchers could use more funds.
