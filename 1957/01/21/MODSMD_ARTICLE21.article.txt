terday, President Eisenhower began his second
term in the White House. His magnetic, father
ly personality, which drew from the people a
feeling of conli 'ence and trust, was one of the
strom: eo> :ributing factors to his re-election.
lie is in a position now to use this abounding
popularity to convert '"'progress"' from a cam
paign slogan to actual fact. Progress rather
th m the old claims of "peace" and "prosperity"
became the watchword of the Eisenhower in
fluence on the "New Republican Party. 1 lie
pledged progress.
There is one field in particular where Eisen
hower could exert â€”ar r ' as yet has failed to
