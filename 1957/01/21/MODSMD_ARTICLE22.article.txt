Editor, The Daily:
In regard to your particularly disagreeable
editorial in Wednesday's Daily ("No Dancing
in the Aisles"), we find your desire for jazz exhi
bitions to be held in the San Francisco Opera
House highly offensive, and your definition of
jazz as a "unique cultural contribution" even
more so.
Wo prefer the proposed definition of jazz
' artists" as "crazed jungle-tribal dancers." Clear
ly their warm reception in Europe reflects the
decadence of post war society in general.

Editor, The Daily:
Can our cheerleaders do anything about Ihe
bad sportsmanship of Slanford fans at basket
ball games this year?
Each time a member of the opposing team
attempts a free throw there is an effort to dis
tract him with shouting and whistling. Several
times during the game Saturday night Coach
Dallmar and Hap Wagner gestured futilely to
the crowd to be quiet.
Good sportsmanship should need no reward,
but some benefit to the team may be involved.
For if Wagner's reaction represented the attitude
of the tpam, the noise is more irritating to our
own players than distracting to opponents.
