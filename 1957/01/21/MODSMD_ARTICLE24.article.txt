# THIS WEEK ON QUAD-By Earl Cilley
## Rushing Is Over ... Life Rack to Normal 
### 
Well, the most formal part of the rushing pro
gram is over now, the last mass function has
been held and now all that's left is for the treas
urers to ligure how they're going to pay for all
the parlies.
Interesting thing about this year's rushing is
how well certain organizations did in compari
son with other more popular organizations. As
one rushing chairman was heard to say, "The
lousy freshmen are thinking; we'll take gas."
Laler in the week The Daily will publish tlie
results, which will make very interesting head
ing, and we'll ail know jusi who inhaled, and
how much.
