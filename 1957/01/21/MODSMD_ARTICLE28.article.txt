Isaacs and enough light for two
teams. Result: a wellearned vic
tory for each side in one of the
most thrilling week ends of bas
ket hall the Pavilion has seen.

Paul Neumann performed bril
liantly in the clutch, and Hap
Wagner stood out on defense.
The Huskies' Q8 fi4 Saturday
night win could he credited to Bill
Stady for his game-winning shot
or to the great hustling play of
co-captain Don Sunitsch, the only
senior on Ihe team. Boin was kept
inside by the Cards and marie only
one of his fabled long hooks dur
ing both games, but his rebound
ing played a big role in the Husky
victory.
Bond topped scorers in both
games, hitting 25 on Friday and
20 on Saturday. Isaacs played Ihe
best games of his career, scoring
17 and 10 respectively, stealing
the ball like a guard and perform
ing greatly on Ihe boards and in
checking Boin.
Fiw Throws Decisive
Remarkable accuracy from the
free-throw line accounted for the

charity line w hi 1 e hitting two
fewer field goals.
The lead changed hands 10
times in the first six minutes of

free throws, slapped in a rebound
and tanked a short hook to cut :
the lead to 5119.
Bond iced the game after the
Huskies had pulled il 1o 59-57
with six straight points on two
.jump shots and two free throws.

story Saturday night. Boin turned
in one of his top board games of
the year as Ihe I luskies staved off
the Cards to gain a O<X-(!4 win.
Stanford jumped off to a 20-11
lead early in the game, but Smart !

at half time on a similar play by
Sunitsch and then moved 10 points
ahead six minutes into the second

dered the Cards to go into a full
court press, and the tactic began
to pay off.
Down 56-47, Neumann scored on
a driving lay-in. Gary Van Galder
profnptly broke up a Husky pass
and, while flat on his back, passed
to Hap Wagner, who waltzed in
for an easy lay-in.
There Goes Washington

when I>ick Haga put in an under
hand hook, was fouled and turned
it into a three-pointer. Isaacs' tip
in tied it up, and then sophomore
