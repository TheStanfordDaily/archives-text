# Webfoots, Vandals Divide Two Tilts
## 
### 
Basketball teams of Oregon and
Idaho combined efforts over the
week end to move out of the Pa
cific Coast Conference cellar.
The two leams split a pair at
Eugene to give Oregon sixth and j
Idaho seventh, ahead of winless
Washington State.
In Friday's battle, the Vandals
slammed the Ducks, 64-46, but the
Webfoots fought back Saturday lo|
grab a last-flitch 50-48 thriller.
Charlie Franklin and Bill Moore
each potted 13 markers Saturday
to lead Oregon to victory.
For the losers, Bob Prestel sank |
12 and Jim Branom 11.
