# East German, Soviet Troops Display Might
## 
### 
BERLIN, Jan. 20 (UP) Soviet
and East German troops marched
side by side for the first time in
East Berlin today, in a display of
armed might (hat marie it clear
no resistance to the Communist
regime will be tolerated.
The Stalinist-minded East Ger
man leaders, fresh from confer
ences in Moscow, were using show
of force and severe jail terms as
deterrents to the unrest sweeping
East German youths since the
Hungarian rebellion.
The appearance of the Red
army in East Berlin to help East
Germany celebrate the anniversa
ry of two Communist heroes un
derlined the repeated threats by
the East German Reds to put
down any attack on the govern
ment with ruthless severity.
Rod army units marcher! with
the East German "people's army"
and workers' militia formations.
The parade was billed as a
"fighting demonstration" against
West German militarism. The
Communists said it showed that
"workers and soldiers stand to
gether against militarism."
In staging the parade wit h
armed workers' militia, the Com
munists again violated four power
occupation agreements barring
armed civilians in Berlin. How
ever, Western allied protests in
I he past have been rejected by
the Soviets.
