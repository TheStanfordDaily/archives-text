# Dribble-Dance Almost Staged By Frosh, Basketball Team
## 
### 
Have you ever wanted to watch your basketball in the dark, to
l he accompaniment of a dance band, with the Big Red team shar
ing the court with 400 dancing couples?
This situation almost developed when the Stanlord-Santa Clara
basketball game, scheduled for this Saturday night at the Cow
Palace in the City, was rescheduled at the Pavilion. Already
planned for that night was the Freshman Class Card Dance—also
in the Pavilion.
It seems California and the University of San Francisco were
also supposed to play in the Cow Palace Saturday as part of a
douhleheader program. But the two schools got into a hassle
over whether the Cow Palace was USF's home court or not and
the game was called off. And with it went Stanford's date there
too.
The freshman class got to work quickly and switched its dance
to the Women's Gym, so now the dribbling and the dancing will
be separated., Alas! It would have been interesting.
