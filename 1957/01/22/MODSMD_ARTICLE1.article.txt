### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 21 J UP) —
Adlai E. Stevenson, twice-defeated
Democratic candidate for Presi
dent, charged today that the Na
tional Security Council once held
his views on banning superbomb
tests, but changed its decision "for
obviously political reasons."
Writing in the current issue of
Look magazine, Stevenson revived
the hydrogen bomb controversy,
which became a major political
issue between him and President
Eisenhower during the 1936 cam
paign.
Gives Reasons
Stevenson said such tests should
be suspended because:
• "The survival of mankind
may well depend upon it."
• "It would increase our na
tional security."
• "It would strengthen our po
sition in the cold war."
He said that when he first dis
closed his views last April before
the American Society of Newspa
per Editors, his stand "was virtu
ally ignored by the White llou.se
"But when I restated it before
the American Legion convention
on September 5, during the cam
paign, the President chose to
make this proposal a political is
sue and on September 19 called it
'a theatrical gesture'," Stevenson
said.

"There was, indeed, reason to
believe," he said, "that the Na
tional Security Council itself, be
tween September 5 and September
19. had voted 'unanimously' in
favor of a similar superbomb pro
posal: but this decision had then
been set aside for obviously po
litical reasons, and my suggestion
for strengthening our position
morally and physically in the
world was grievously distorted
and assailed by Republican (ram
pa ign orators as a proposal to
weaken our defenses."
The former Illinois governor
said the H-bomb controversy later
was overshadowed by the Hunga
rian revolt and the Middle East
crisis, but "we can't sweep it un
der Ihe rug."
