### 
WARSAW, Jan. 21 fUP)â€”Po
land hoped thai it qualified today
for American economic aid on the
basis of a resounding election vic
tory for Wladyslaw Gomulka and
his independent brand of Commu
nism.
The "liberal" Communist party
leader was expected to take his
mandate of victory which reached
99 pei- cent in many areas as a
mandate to sweep out holdover
Stalinists from the government.
Sources predicted Stalinist Dep
uty Premier Zenon Nowak would
be removed.
Gomulka and his candidates for
the 429-seat Sejm (parliament)
won majorities ranging up to
99.44 per cent, according to the
semi-official news agency Pap.
1 lis United Workers (Commu
nist) party was assured of at
least 52 per '-ent of the seals and
probably would get 70 per cent
or more on the basis of final re
turns to he announced tomorrow.
Poles said they hoped the vic
tory tor independent - minded
Communism over the Stalinists
would pave the way for American
loans badly needed to shore up
the Polish economy.
The United States thus far has
been cold to overtures from Po
land for aid.
The newspaper "Zycie Warsza
wy," asking why the subject of a
loan has not been discussed in
Congress, quoted Western press
reports to the effect that the
United States was waiting for the
results of the election to see
whether the country would tic
sfa bilized.
While the election was a victory
for Gomulka, Poland still re
mained an ardently Communist
country. Gomulka himself, . al
though a "Titoist," has pledged
friendship with the Soviet Union.
He warned in an election - eve
speech thai defeat for him and
his friendship tor Russia would
result in "crossing Poland off the
map of Europe."
