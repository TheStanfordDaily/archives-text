# MOSLEM RIFT GROWS
## Jordan Asks Britain to End Air Base Occupation Treaty 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 21 (UP) —Jordan served notice on Britain today it
wants lo break off the Anglo-Jordanian treaty that permits the Brit
ish to maintain aid and ground bases in that strategic Middle East
kingdom.
The Jordanian move was disclosed by the British Foreign Office

as a rift widened in the Moslem
world over President Eisenhow
er's economic and military plan
lo safeguard the Middle East from
Communist penetration.
Moslem nations of the anti-Com
munist Baghdad Pact announced
"full support" today for the "Eis
enhower Doctrine." which has
been hostilely received by the neu
tralist Arab bloc led by Egypt.
High emissaries of both factions
are en route to Washington for
talks with Eisenhower.
King Saud of Saudi Arabia sail
ed for the United States from
Genoa, Italy, today to bargain for
the "southern tier" Arab bloc of
Egypt. Syria, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
Iraqi Prince
Crown Prince Abdul Illah of
Iraq arrived in London on his way
to Washington to represent the
Baghdad Pact Moslem members—
Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan and Iran.
It was reported he would urge
full-scale U.S. membership in the
pact.
Jordan's move to abrogate its
pact with Britain was a swift
sequel to the week-end Cairo sum
mil conference of Saud. Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
King Hussein of Jordan and Pre
mier Abri El-Ssali of Syria.
The conference resulted in a
pledge from Egypt, Saudi Arabia
and Syria to take over payment
of some $33,000,000 in military
and economic afel Jordan receives
annually under the treaty with
Britain.
Jordan Parliament
The Jordanian Parliament al
ready had voted to scrap the trea
ty. but until now Biitain had re
ceived no formal notification. Jor
dan apparently fell free lo make
a formal break-off move, now that
it had been promised substitute
Arab aid.
A Foreign Office announcement
tonight said Britain had offered
to renegotiate the pact before the
Arab summit conference sealed
the apparent death of the eight
yea r-old treaty.
In Ankara, a joint communique
of the four Moslem Baghdad Pact
nations formally accepted the Eis
enhower Doctrine "as the best de
signed lo maintain peace in this
area.''
But the "northern tier" coun
tries withheld any comment on
whether I hey had derided to re
store Britain to active participa
tion In the pact. Britain has been
left out of pact deliberations since
the Suez invasion.
