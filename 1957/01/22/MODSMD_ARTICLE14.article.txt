GROTON, Conn., Jan. 21 (UP)
â€”The Seawolf, the nation's sec
ond atomic - powered submarine,
slipped out to sea secretly today
on its first trial run.
The $63 million snub-nosed le
viathan was put through its paces
three weeks behind schedule be
cause of "bugs" that developed in
its power plant.
The maiden voyage of the 3260-
ton submarine, bigger and faster
than the Nautilus, the world's first
atomic-powered vehicle, was made
without any fanfare.
Word of the departure leaked
out this morning. It later was
confirmed by both the Navy and
the Seawolf's builders.
In Washington, Navy officials
said the vessel put. to sea this
morning for "builder's trials."
In New York, the General Dy
namics Corporation, builder of the
vessel, announced: "The Seawolf
is operating at sea under nuclear
power as a continuation of the
builder's trial."
For weeks, officials of the Navy
and the Electric Boat Division of
General Dynamics feared that the
Seawolf's radical new power sys
tem might be a failure and would
have to be replaced with the same
system used in the Nautilus.
In dockside tests, the Seawolf's
power plant superheater did not
work properly. The nuclear re
actor, most vital part of the ves
sel, operated satisfactorily, how
ever.
