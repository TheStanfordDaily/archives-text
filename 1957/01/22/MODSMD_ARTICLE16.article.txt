# President Pledges to Overcome ‘Divisive Force' of Communism
## Ike Will Strive To Build Peace; Warns of Price 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan, 21 (UP)
— President Eisenhower today
solemnly pledged his second term
to overcoming the "divisive force"
of international Communism and
building toward a "true force of
peace" with justice under law for
all.
But he warned his countrymen
that the price of peace is high:
"in toil patiently sustained, in
help honorably given, in sacrifice
calmly borne." And yet, he said,
it. is to this goal that "we are
called and our strength dedi
cated."
With former President Hoover,
author of the "Fortress America"
concept, sitting just behind him,
Eisenhower said flatly I hat "no
nation can longer be a fortress,
lone and strong and sale." Said
the President: "No people can
live to itself alone."
Eisenhower proclaimed hi de
votion to these "constant princi
ples" in an eloquent, address be
fore thousands massed in ihe
great plaza east of the Capitol to
witness the nation's 43rd Presi
dential inauguration.
World Destiny
The President made rlear at the
outset America's "deep involve
ment in the destiny of men every
where/' He addressed himself not
only to his fellow Americans but
to "the friends of my country
wherever may be."
Moments before, under skies
alternately cloudy and sun
streaked, Eisenhower and Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon re
peated the oaths of office they
had taken yesterday at a private
White House ceremony.
He bluntly blamed internation
al Communism and the power
that controls it for the present
"tragically divided" world. But
even so, he said, the Communist
world has been shaken by a
"fierce and mighty force" in Hun
gary.
Budapest Symbol
"Budapest," he declared as the
crowd roared, "is no longer mere
ly the name of a city; henceforth
it is a new and shining sym
man's yearning to be free."
And so, he said, the United
States never can turn its back on
the changes taking place in the
world.
"We look upon this shaken
earth, and we declare our firm
and fixed purpose—the building
of a peace with justice in a world
where moral law prevails."
Calling on Americans to meet
the high price of peace, he said
that "we must pay the costs of
our needed military strength, and
help to build the security of oth
ers."
Must Use Assets
"We must use our skills and
knowledge and, at times, our sub
stance, to help others rise from
misery, however far the scene of
suffering may be from our
shores.
"For wherever in the world a
people knows desperate want,
there must appear at least the
spark of hope, the hope of prog
ress—or there will surely rise at
last the flames of conflict."
Senate Democratic whip Mike
Mansfield (Mont.), a memt r of
the Senate Foreign Relation .
Committee, said the speech w.:i .
"magnificent" and "well delivered
on a high plane." He said Eisen
hower appealed to "the peoples oC
the world" rather than their lead
ers.
