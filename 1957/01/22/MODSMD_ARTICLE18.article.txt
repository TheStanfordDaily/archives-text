# A 						Matter of Self-Delusion
## 
### 
Seldom can an individual stand aloof from
his society and look objectively at himself.
For this reason, the criticisms and evaluations
a foreign visitor makes after a stay in the
United States often present provocative and
sometimes disturbing thoughts.
Mrs. Amina El Said, an Egyptian newspaper
woman who visited the campus yesterday, did
not claim to be an expert on the American
character, but she did offer some insight that
is not iiiappiv^.nate to the United States in
general, m.J Stanford in particular.
She said Americans seem genninely eager to
learn—in her case, eager to learn about the
Arab world. But at the same time, she said,
Americans tend to remain inflexible in their
ideas and attitudes.
To stretch Mrs. Said's point a little further—
individuals, conditioned by environment and
group pressures, often find it easier to make
the facts fit their attitv s than their attitudes
fit the facts. And the : ill is self-delusion.

After a particularly good lecture, it is nol
uncommon to hear a student remark something
to the effect, "You know, 1 have to agree that
the professor is right in many ways, hut that
just isn't the way 1 think."
In varying degrees, we are all guilty of this
same sell-delusion. It is a form of mental lazi
ness, of unwillingness to change the whole pat
tern of our thinking when we find that our
gttitudes or biases have led us astray.
Morbid self-analysis is not the answer, but
neither is cloning our minds to the possibility
of further insight.
A person's mind is a flexible thing. With
each new experience, with each new hit of
knowledge a person gets, he should broaden his
thinking, rather than becoming confused he
cause of the narrow channel down which his
prejudices have led him.
Mrs. Said's thoughts were by no means
unique, but her reflections are well worth con
sidering.
