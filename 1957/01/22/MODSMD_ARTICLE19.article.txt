## Discrimination Problems Face Fraternities 
### Mary Ellen Romney 
Fraternity life at Stanford has settled down
to normal after rush week activities, but at some
other Western campuses, life on the row has been
quite eventful.
At San Jose State a decision by Interfraternity
Council to attempt to bring more social fraterni
ties to the campus was immediately followed by
the introduction of a bill in the State Legislature
which would prohibit all state schools from recog
nizing fraternities and sororities which restrict
membership on the basis of race, religion or color.
The IFC felt San Jose was large enough to
support more fraternities, and that the fact that
many of the students who rushed last quarter
did not pledge proves that more students would
like to belong to houses.
But the anti-discrimination bill being considered
in the State Legislature would complicate this
expansion process. Dean Helen Dimmick, adviser
to San Jose's Panhellenic Council, said that no
sororities with restrictive clauses are presently
on campus.
"At Ihe time nationals were admitted here a
number of the sororities had some type of under
stood racial or religious restriction, but for the
past eight years the college has been very careful
not to admit organizations with written restric
tions," she said.
Many fraternities have unwritten "understand
ings" over admission policy.
Such a law could work both ways - Negro, Jew
ish and other raeial fraternities would also be
prohibited.
IFC adviser Dean Robert Martin said San Jose
would obey the law if it is passed. Several of the
national fraternities on the campus would be
affected by such a ruling.

Two students were expelled from the Univer
sity of Idaho after what began as a playful snow

ball fight ended with six broken windows and
two wounded students.
A group of men students gathered and a snow
fight developed as the group moved past ihe
dormitories to the row. There, in front of a fra
ternity house, Ihe fight enlarged, and the house
was pelted by snowballs. Six windows of the
house were broken. At this point two members
of the fraternity fired shotguns into the air above
the crowd to break it up, wounding two students
in the legs with shotgun pellets.
The men who fired Ihe guns have been sus
pended on the recommendations of the men's
discipline committee, with the concurrence of the
university president.
Commenting on the incident in the Idaho Argo
naut, a columnist wrote: " 'Boys will be boys,
hell! . . . Have you ever wondered if the people
who are paying for our education might not start
thinking this is nothing but an institution wheif
kids can release pent-up animalistic tendencies?
"The blame rests on those who acted those
expelled because they acted rashly under an
tagonism those who tromped over the campus
looking for excitement."

On the sunnier side of the row, the Beta Theta
Pi house at Washington State College gave their
cook the thrill of her life last week. Mrs. Hulda
Burgquist, a cook at the house for 25 years, was
presented with a gift of $1500.
Mrs. Burgquist is to use the money for a trip
to New York, where she will embark for a seven
week visit to Sweden. Although she has never
been to Sweden, she has many relatives there
and can speak Swedish.
More than 400 alumni and the 45 men in the
Beta house made the gift possible. Mrs. Burg
quist is planning the trip for next July.
