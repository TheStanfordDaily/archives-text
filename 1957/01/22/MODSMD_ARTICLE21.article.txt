# FROM ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## Outlook for ASSU Called â€˜Encouraging' 
### Bob Freelen 
Editor's Note: This week The
Daily will present a series of spe
cial features on student govern
ment. They include today's "View
point" by ASSU President Boh
Freelen, a "Viewpoint" dealing
with the long-I'lln appearance of
student government, an article on
ASSU finances and a "Campus
Opinion" column on student reac
tion to student government.
Freelen was asked hy The Daily
to fcive his analysis of problems
lacing this year's student govern
ment, how it has attempted to
solve these problems and what
can he done to improve it.
Significant problems concerning
Stanford's libraries, Bookstore,
Tresidder Memorial Union and
travel facilities for students and
faculty will confront student gov
ernment in the next six months.
Currently a student library
committee is being formed to
work in conjunction with Dr. Ray
mond C. Swank, director of Uni
versity Libraries, and his staff.
Perhaps the major function of the
committee will he to channel stu
dent suggestions concerning the
libraries to proper authorities.
ll is hoped I his committee can
be effective in producing some
worthwhile suggestions and in
satisfying disgruntled student de
mands. The committee may pos
sibly have a hand in urging future
remodeling of the Main Library
and development of plans for a
new undergraduate library.
Some consideration is being giv
en to alteration of the method in
which Bookstore profits are dis
bursed for student benefit. Plans
have not been fully completed, but
an initial proposal will he submit

ted to the Bookstore board of di
rectors late this month or early
in February.
1 have had several talks wilh
Kenneth Cuthbertson, assistant to
President Sterling, in regard to
the Tresidder Memorial Union. II
funds are nol made available by
donors wilhin the near future,
other means of financing the
structure will be investigated.
Since it will lake l<S months to
construct, Stanford will not have
a new Union for al least three
years. A decision will have to be
made soon, because the annual
rise in building costs exceeds our
annual receipts for the Union.
Recently a New York firm call
ed The Open Road contacted me
concerning chartered flights from
New York to London, Amsterdam
or Pai is for about $81)0 round trip.
Presumably this type of transpor
tation could be made available to

students and faculty who desire j
to travel independently in Europe, i
As nearly as I can determine,
charter flights have been success-;
fully sponsored by the associated}
students of several universities.
Because of a Civil Aeronautics 1
Board ruling, such charter flights
would have to be sponsored by
the ASSU. The feasibility of such
a program al Stanford will be
considered in the near I inure.
1 have also been asked to specu
late on the future potentialities of
student government at Stanford.
The outlook is encouraging, but*
I do not believe any noteworthy]
uptrend will be evidenced until i
Tresidder Memorial Union is com- j
pleted.
With ample and attractive facil
ities, we can expect keener com-1
petition for student government
positions, less indifference by the'
student body, much bigger elec
tions and attempts to place more!
authority in the hands of student
government.
ASSU organizational structure
will change considerably. Such j
change will probably allow the!
ASSIJ to function as a centrally
directed unit rather than a dis
cordant group of committees.
Whether student government
expands its influence and juris
diction will depend primarily upon
its leaders and their ability to re
frain from unwise crusades. If
handler! in a competent and pa
tient manner, there will be room
for expansion of student responsi
bility.
Current relations wilh the Uni
versity are as cooperative as pos
sible in most areas. Therefore,
most of the changes will occur
among students.

Freelen was asked hy The Daily
to fcive his analysis of problems
lacing this year's student govern
ment, how it has attempted to
solve these problems and what
can he done to improve it.
Significant problems concerning
Stanford's libraries, Bookstore,
Tresidder Memorial Union and
travel facilities for students and
faculty will confront student gov
ernment in the next six months.
Currently a student library
committee is being formed to
work in conjunction with Dr. Ray
mond C. Swank, director of Uni
versity Libraries, and his staff.
Perhaps the major function of the
committee will he to channel stu
dent suggestions concerning the
libraries to proper authorities.
ll is hoped I his committee can
be effective in producing some
worthwhile suggestions and in
satisfying disgruntled student de
mands. The committee may pos
sibly have a hand in urging future
remodeling of the Main Library
and development of plans for a
new undergraduate library.
Some consideration is being giv
en to alteration of the method in
which Bookstore profits are dis
bursed for student benefit. Plans
have not been fully completed, but
an initial proposal will he submit

ted to the Bookstore board of di
rectors late this month or early
in February.
1 have had several talks wilh
Kenneth Cuthbertson, assistant to
President Sterling, in regard to
the Tresidder Memorial Union. II
funds are nol made available by
donors wilhin the near future,
other means of financing the
structure will be investigated.
Since it will lake l<S months to
construct, Stanford will not have
a new Union for al least three
years. A decision will have to be
made soon, because the annual
rise in building costs exceeds our
annual receipts for the Union.
Recently a New York firm call
ed The Open Road contacted me
concerning chartered flights from
New York to London, Amsterdam
or Pai is for about $81)0 round trip.
Presumably this type of transpor
tation could be made available to

students and faculty who desire j
to travel independently in Europe, i
As nearly as I can determine,
charter flights have been success-;
fully sponsored by the associated}
students of several universities.
Because of a Civil Aeronautics 1
Board ruling, such charter flights
would have to be sponsored by
the ASSU. The feasibility of such
a program al Stanford will be
considered in the near I inure.
1 have also been asked to specu
late on the future potentialities of
student government at Stanford.
The outlook is encouraging, but*
I do not believe any noteworthy]
uptrend will be evidenced until i
Tresidder Memorial Union is com- j
pleted.
With ample and attractive facil
ities, we can expect keener com-1
petition for student government
positions, less indifference by the'
student body, much bigger elec
tions and attempts to place more!
authority in the hands of student
government.
ASSU organizational structure
will change considerably. Such j
change will probably allow the!
ASSIJ to function as a centrally
directed unit rather than a dis
cordant group of committees.
Whether student government
expands its influence and juris
diction will depend primarily upon
its leaders and their ability to re
frain from unwise crusades. If
handler! in a competent and pa
tient manner, there will be room
for expansion of student responsi
bility.
Current relations wilh the Uni
versity are as cooperative as pos
sible in most areas. Therefore,
most of the changes will occur
among students.
