Not Thriving, Rill Dorailenl
Editor, The Daily:
I was shocked into my senses Monday by the
acute — nay, rather succinct — insight into and
analysis of jazz presented by Messrs. Wallin and
Wickland.
Heretofore T had always been under Ihe im
pression Ihat those of my friends who held an
appreciation for jazz presented at least a certain
measure of vitality representative of a thriving
society.
Hut no. Now T have been shown that, like
Europe, whose "warm reception (of jazz| reflects
the decadence of post-war |i assume this refers
to the Korean War World War II was "over 12
years ago) society in general," my friends are
probably decadenl 400. And 1 now they fore look
at my friends with horror and revulsion, for they

admire the music of "crazed jungle • tribal I
dancers."
In the Stanford male, this tendency is a truly j
repellent, but still condonable, trait. But in our
Stanford woman, this ape instinct is insuperably!
odious.
Gentlemen, we owe an obligation to our women.
We cannot therefore, during the next two days
in our classes, ask the girl sitting to the right of
us. and the girl to the left, if she likes jazz.
And if she does, we must beseech her to dislike
jazz, for otherwise she might well turn into, if
she has not already turned into, a decadent fe
male ape.
This proposal is submitted with due solemnity.
The S:iu Francisco Opera House has already co
operated. M;iy it be granted that you cooperate
too.
