# Egyptian Official Compares Arab Revolt to U.S. Revolution
## Says Nasser Is Mid-East 'George Washington,' Wants Freedom From East-West Domination 
### Rich Brown 
"Egypt's President Nasser is the George Washington of the Middle
East," Dr. Hussein Kamel Selim, one-time undersecretary of the
Egyptian Ministry of Guidance, told a gathering at Bowman Alumni
House yesterday.
Selim is touring the United States at his own expense to pre-

sent the Egyptian poini of view.
He emphasized that he was speak
ing personally and not as a gov
ernment official.
"We want freedom from for
eign domination both East and
West just like you wanted inde
pendence in 177(5," he said.
"Egypt had a revolution in
July, 1952, in which President
Nasser was installed as the new
leader with the blessing of the
United States," Selim continued.
He pointed out how Egypt had
been ahead of Western nations
until only six centuries ago. Then
the West surpassed Egypt in
technological developments, aijd
today Egypt is in the process of
sudden growth to make up lost
time.
"Bloodless Revolution"
"Our political, social, education
al and economic revolution of
1052 was surprisingly bloodless,"
Selim said.
One of the first informs was in
land. Before 1952, most of the
country's land was in the posses
sion of a very few, who added
nothing In the economy hut spent
most of their time in Paris and
other foreign cities.spending the
money which rightfully belonged
to those who tilled the soil, he ex
plained.
"Even when we broke up land
holdings ol more than 200 acres,
the owners received full compen
sation for their former property,"
Selim added.
A Step Forward
"Many revolutions have failed
and have set countries back," Se
lim said, "but we feel that with
sympathetic assistance from our
friends like the United States, our
revolution can be a step in the
right direction."
One of the key programs in
Egypt's battle against undei privi
lege is the Aswan Dam project,
Ihe speaker noted. When com
pleted, ii will provide lighting for
ail Egypt's villages and increase
the water acreage by a third.
"The International Bank prom
iserl a loan to augment what we
would spend from our own treas
ury, but on July 20 the same day
Nasser announced his acceptance
of the loan Secretary of State
Dulles withdrew the offer, with
Britain and the bank itself follow
ing."
Suez Revenue
The only way to raise money
was to nationalize the Suez Canal
and use the revenue from it to
finance the dam, he said.
"Our decision was misconstrued
by the British and French," he
said. "They did everything to
stop canal operation and finally
used Israel as an excuse to attack
us last November."
Selim answered two questions
concerning the status of the wa
terway. "While it is an 'interna
tional' canal it nevertheless has
an owner, just like the San Fran
cisco International Airport is
owned by the city of San Fran
cisco."
As to Egypt's refusing permis
sion for Israel to use the canal in
violation of the IKBB treaty speci
fying use by all nations, he
pointed out that Britain was the
one to start the precedent of for
bidding her wartime enemies to
use the canal, in both world wars.
