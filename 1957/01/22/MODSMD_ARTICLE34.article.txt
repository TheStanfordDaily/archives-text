Western Civ students, current
ly embroiled in medieval theology
and philosophy, know the pains
taking methods of illumination
practiced by the early monks in
producting such books as the An
glo-Saxon Book of Lindesfarne.
A facsimile reproduction of this
book will soon be available in the
Bender Room, purchased with a
recent gift to the University Li
brary.
The Bender Room includes, in
its capacity as Division of Special
Collections, such varied things as
an ancestor of the modern con
lour chair, I wo original Bach man
uscripts, a book two inches high
and first editions of "Alice in
Wonderland" from England, Italy,
France and the United States.
The library had been receiving
gifts of rare books for some time
when the Albert M. Bender con
tributions made the collection sig
nificant. A special room was set
aside for these books in 1939.-40.
Books are automatically assigned
to the Rare Book Room by date,
cost, size of editions and fragility
of t he copies.
First Math Hook
Books are considered rare if
they were published in Europe
before 1640, in England before
1710 and in America before 1800.
Among these old books are the
Incunabula books published in
the first 50 years of printing. One
of these is the first printer! mathe
matics book, put out 10 years be
fore the discovery of America.
Besides these books that fall
into the general rare book cate
gory, the Bender Room is in
charge of the special collections
which have been donated to the
library. Materials from the Ben
der Room and from these special
collections are availab'e to any
one, but must be used in the room
itself.
Some of the special collections
are housed in the Rare Book
Room, on the top floor of the li :
brary; others are in special rooms
of their own, such as the Hopkins
Study and the Felton Library.
Hopkins' Study
The "contour chair" is a part
of the furnishings in the Hopkins
Room, the study of Timothy Hop
kins which was transplanted bod
ily from his mansion in Menlo
Park to the sixth floor of the li
brary.
The Charlotte Felton Room is
also furnished with things from

her home. This collection, donated
by Mrs. Kate Felton Elkins, fea
tures English and American liter
ature from mid - nineteenth cen
tury to the present time, largely
in first editions.
The Memorial Library of Music,
recently moved to the Bender
Room, boasts the manuscript of
"Danses Concertantes," presented
directly to the collection by the
composer, Igor Stravinsky.
Donated as a memorial to Stan
ford's war dead by Mr. and Mrs.
George Keating of Los Altos, the
collection consists of music manu
scripts, first editions of engraved
and printed scores, and books
about music, including some on
folk songs and jazz.
Newton Collection
A first edition of Newton's
"Prineipia" is a part of the Isaac-
Newton Collection, probably the
most complete collection of New
tonia in existence. This library is
a history of scientific thought,
with present books being continu
ally added to the nucleus of New
ton's works.
The donor of the collection,
Frederick Braseh, was a student
at Stanford, specializing in math
ematics. He has been associated
with the Library of Congress as
a chief of the Smithsonian Divi
sion. His office is now in the
Bender Room, where he acts as
bibliographer for his collection.
Another very recent collection
acquired by the library also deals
with science, in the specific fields
of engineering and mechanics.
The Timoshenko Library, many
of whose books are written in
Slavic languages, was donated by
a Stanford professor of econom
ics, Vladimir Timoshenko.
Americana Documents
There are various collections of
Americana. One donated by San
Francisco's former mayor, Elmer
Robinson, has documents dating
back to the American Revolution,
including several letters written
personally by George Washing
ton.
The library subscribes to cur
rent Danish periodicals to keep
its Greenland Collection up to
date. This unusual collection is
devoted primarily to science, but
includes some books on Greenland
folklore. Although most of the
books in the collection are written
in Eskimo or Danish, they are
widely circulated through inter
library loans, according to Bender
Room librarian Catherine Morton.
