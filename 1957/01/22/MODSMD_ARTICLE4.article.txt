# Egypt Women Have Equality, Says Feminist
## 
### 
Egyptian women are actually
ahead of America's ladies in one
regard, Mrs. Amina El Said, lead
er in the Egyptian feminist move
ment, noted in a Daily interview
yesterday. That is the right to
retain their maiden names after
marriage.
Incidentally, Egyptian married
women have the title "Mrs."
Mrs. Said, editor of an impor
tant Egyptian magazine, is tour
ing the States with Dr. Hussein
Kamel Selim, who spoke yester
day in Bowman. Both are pre
senting the Egyptian side of the
story, though their opinions are
strictly personal.
Mrs. Said noted that Egyptian
women have had legal equality
with men since President Nasser
took ovei\ "The only thing which
holds back our women is lack it
education. With 20 per cent of our
budget now devoted to education
we feel that it is only a matter of
time until all women arc equal to
men."
Egyptian opinion about Ihe
United States skyrocketed last
November, she said, when Presi
dent Eisenhower took the stand
he did concerning the British-
French-Israeli invasion.
Mrs. Sairl explained that Egypt
bought arms from Czechoslova
kia only after it had been refused
by the United States and other
nations. "But we didn't buy their,
ideology in fact Communism is
illegal in Egypt."
Dr. Selim and Mrs. Said have
been touring the United States
since Dec. 2. They report a "most
gratifying response" to their
talks on other campuses and in
various communities.
"We want to explain the Arab
situation so that Americans will
see the other side of the story
when they read reports from the
Middle East," Mrs. Sairl ex
plained.
