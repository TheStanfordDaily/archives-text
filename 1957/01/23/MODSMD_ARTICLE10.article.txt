# Masters Blasts State Control Of PCC Bill
## Says Athletic Plan Is 'Beginning of End For Free Enterprise' 
### 
Stanford Athletic Director A 1
Masters has hit out at a state
legislature bill which, would put
Pacific Coast Conference athletics
under state control, terming it
"the beginning of the end for free
enterprise."
Assemblyman Charles H. Wil
son, a Los Angeles Democrat, an
nounced two days ago lie would
introduce a bill which would put
the athletic programs of public
and private colleges under a five
man state commission.
As Stanford is receiving indi
rect support in the form of prop
erty tax exemptions, says Wilson,
it would fall under the commis
sion's jurisdiction.
"('lean Up Mess"
Purpose of the commission
would be "to clean up the present
I'CC mess" and "give us teams
that can compete favorably with
any team in the country."
Masters has further said that
any bill that would give the slate
control of collegiate athletics
"should be sent to Russia."
"II such a bill were passed," he
said, "it would mean the end to
intercollegiate athletics. If it gets
over, the newspapers miâ„¢ht be
next. Somebody might get the
idea of appointing a commission
to regulate newspapers. I don't
think there's any chance for a bill
like that to pass."
Administration Silent
The University administration
had no official opinion on the bill:
"The University founding grant
forbids us to enter political mat
ters," explained Assistant to the
President Frederic O. Oliver. "Mr.
Masters has commented on the
athletic aspects.
"But I do think there is entirely
too much excitement over the bill.
It doesn't stand a chance of get
ting passed."
