# GENETIC HAZARD
## Adlai 'Exactly Accurate,' Says 112 Ex-Atom Commissioner 
### Dave Canfield 
Former Atomic Energy Commission member Hardin B. Jones yes
terday called Adlai Stevenson's campaign statements on atomic fall
out "exactly accurate."
"It (Stevenson's statements! fell on other scientists who hadn't
investigated the problem and they concluded Adlai Stevenson was

wrong," said Jones in a speech be
fore the Political Union Independ
ent Caucus.
Stevenson has said continued
atomic testing is producing
enough radioactive material in
the atmosphere to make a health
and genetics hazard.
Atomic fallout, Jones said, is
particularly important in the
Western half of the United
States.
"We'are in the genetic latitude
where all tests are made," ex
plained the radiohiologist. "Fall
outs in the Western United States
are greater than in the rest of
the world by an approximate fac
tor of 10."
Defines Fallout
Jlf defined atomic fallout as
the fallout of radioactive male
rial from the upper atmosphere
in an A-bomb blast. Radioactive
m a l e r i a 1 in sufficiently large
amounts causes cancer, leukemia
and harmful mutations.
"Atomic fallout does not,"
Jones said, "constitute a danger
at the present time. But the dan
ger cannot help but increase by
a factor of 10 within the next 50
yea rs.
"Over 1 a period of 50 years we
come out that the maximum ac
ceptable level would lead to a
four-fold tendency for bone can
cer to occur."
Radiation fallout would then
take as large a toll in human life
as automobile accidents do now,
he illustrated. 'The automobile
costs the average person two
months out of his life span."
Minimizes Problem
Jones minimized somewhat the
future atomic fallout problem,
stating it would still be less dan
gerous than the present problem
of "the casual use of X-rays."
Each full mouth dental X-ray,
the speaker related, removes Iwo
weeks from the life span of the
average person. "When you con
sider that most people get a den
ial X-ray at least once a year,"
Jones said, "Ihat mounts up."
Also potentially dangerous is
using X-rays in shoe stores and
tuberculosis mobile units, the ex-
AEC member said.
"TB X-rays." said Jones, "de
crease life a couple of days per
individual and you're losing ei
ther lo days or 30 days to geti
that."
