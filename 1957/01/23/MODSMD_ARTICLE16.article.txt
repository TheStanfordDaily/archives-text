# Israeli Troops Evacuate Sinai; Maintain Control of Gaza Strip
## Israel Ignores Call for Complete Evacuation; Fears Egyptian Action 
### 
JERUSALEM, Israel, Jan. 22 (UP)â€”lsrael withdrew its troops
from most of the conquered Sinai Desert today. But it kept posses
sion of the (.a/a Strip anrl a 180-mile coastal ribbon guarding the
Gulf of Aqaba shipping lane.
A United Nations General Assembly resolution last Saturday had

called for a complete evacuation
of (he Sinai Peninsula. But an Is
raeli foreign ministry spokesman
said today that Israeli planned no
further withdrawal.
The mass of Israeli occupation
troops completed a pull-back by
noon, reports reaching here said.
Troops of the UN emergency
force moved in behind the depart
ing Israeli units.
Mark Frontier
But instead of following the
pre-invasion armistice line from
the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.
the Israelis marked out their
frontier outside the refugee-filled
Gaza Strip and the long Aqaba
coastal area in the south.
A new frontier of white-painted
oil drums and barbed wire was
set up to demarcate the two con
tested areas which the Israelis
vow they will not return to Egypt
without firm guarantees they will
not be used as bases for aggres
sive activity.
Israel charges that the Gaza
Strip, a narrow 30-mile-long fin
ger of land jutting up into Israel
along the Mediterranean coast,
long was used by Egypt as a base
for Fedayeen commando raids
into Israeli territory.
Prevent Blockade
By retaining the Gulf of Aqaba
coast, the Israelis want to prevent
the renewal of an Egyptian gun
blockade that long kept Israeli
shipping from reaching the
southern port of Elath.
An Israeli foreign ministry
spokesman said the new demarca
tion line extends two-thirds of a
mile west from the border town
of Rafa on the Mediterranean and
then turns into the old truce line
south of the town. Thus, it cuts
off the Gaza Strip.
Israeli troops retained posses
sion not only of the coastal slice
but also the strongpoint of Sharm
Es-Sheikh which dominates the
entrance to the gulf.
