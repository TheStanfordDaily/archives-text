# British Leader Says Cabinet Free to Act
## Macmillan Turns Down Laborite Demands for Parliamentary Control 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 22 (UP) Hal
oid Macmillan, in his Paiiiamen
tary debut as Prime Minister, re
.jected a Laborite demand today
for laws requiring advance Pai lia
mentary approval of "Suez-type"
attacks on Britain's enemies.
"Her Majesty the Queen, by vir
tue of her royal prerogative,
makes war and peace, acting on
the advice of her ministers, who
are responsible to Parliament,"
Macmillan said.
Polite Way
That was a polite way of saying
the Cabinet will continue to direi t
Britain's affairs, subject only to
majority approval by Parliament
after the event.
The Laborite opposition was in
furiated by former Prime Minis
ter Anthony Eden's failure to con
sult Parliament about his plans to
attack Egypt last fall. They had
demanded laws giving the legisla
ture power to veto such expedi
tions in future.
Communist Rally
A Communist - sponsored rally
began forming outside Parliament
as Macmillan spoke. Hundreds of
persons converged on the build
ings to demand immediate general
elections, something the Laborites
also want but which Macmillan
has refused to grant.
Police admitted the demonstra
tors 50 at a time to see their repre
sentatives in Commons.
Macmillan also turned down La
borite demands for a new "sum
mit" approach to Russia, the
United States and other nations.
He sidestepped a pacifist demand
for the withdrawal of British
troops from Germany.
