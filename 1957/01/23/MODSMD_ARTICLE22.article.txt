# Not a Legislative Matter
## 
### 
A southern California legislator seems to
think, he has the solution to the Pacific Coast
Conference football recruiting ills.
Charles 11. Wilson of Los Angeles two days
ago said he was introducing a hill before the
California State Legislature creating a. fiveÂ«nian
*tate commission with "complete jurisdiction"
over athletic programs of every college or uni
versity receiving "direct or indirect support
from the state."
ilson says the provision would give the
commission jurisdiction over private institu
tions such as Stanford, which receives property
tax exemptions.
Wilson's reasons for the bill seem typical of
the sentiment:) of Southland sports boosters:
u \\ e've got to be realistic. We've got to have
athletic programs that satisfy the public and
give us teams that can compete favorably with
any team in the country,"
Assemblyman Wilson is continuing the "more
pay * theme ol southern California colleges.
Indeed lie seems to he UCLA coach Red San
ders' personal representative to the legislature.
"It is obvious to me that much of the present
difference has been caiwd by professional jeal
ousy of college presidt. 4 md professors against

the financial successes and the greater publicity
given to athletic coaches. There appears to he
a vendetta to get (loach Sanders," he said.
We admit Wilson's allegation that the I'CC
presidents and faculty representatives have not
handled the situation in the best possible man
ner, but we certainly don't think Wilson's
measure is the answer.
What Wilson apparently wants is a profes
sional California football league supported by
taxpayer money and supervised by government
workers. Wilson, who describes himself as a
"sports lover who never went to college," seems
to miss the true meaning of education in his
attempted stampede to catch up with the Rig
Ten professional conference.
Rut, even more important, the legislature
has no business in I'acifie Coast Conference
art airs. The problem is one for the conference
to decide, not for politicians in Sacramento.
Resides, the legality of controlling private in
stitutions like Stanford is something more than
shaky.
The I'CC is meeting again in May. It is then
the issue will he decided one way or another.
We have confidence that the stale legislature
will keep a level head and throw out this dan
gerous bit of legislation.
