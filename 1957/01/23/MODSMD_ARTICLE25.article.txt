# Student Financial Office 'Big Business'; Expects to Spend Nearly Half a Million
## Each Student Pays $5 As a Part of Tuition, Explains Mathewson 
### 
Financing of Stanford's Associ
ated Students is no small matter.
With a growing University enroll
ment and more clubs and activi
ties, nearly half a million dollars
is expected to pass through the
ASSU financial office during the
academic year.
This figure includes all regular
ASSU financing plus the funds
belonging to living groups and
other clubs.
Monetary chief of this expand
ing "big business" is student fi
nancial manager Bill Mathewson,
a junior from Stockton majoring
in economics.
Mathewson, incidentally, is one
of the few male "members" of
the Associated Women Students.
Since he has to account for that
group's expenditures, he is an ex
officio member of the AWS Coun
cil, just as he holds ex-officio po
sitions on other ASSU organiza
tions.
Students' Pay Does
To get things going, all stu
dents .pay dues to the ASSU, al
though most of them do it un
knowingly. The "painless" collec
tion process is handled by the Uni
versity at the time tuition is paid.
Thus, tuition is really $245 a
quarter, with the other $5 being
turned over to the Associated Stu
dents. Once collected, the $5 is
divided and distributed into spe
cific functions.
Student Union operation and the
building fund for Tresidder Me
morial Union receive $1 each from
all students. Beyond this, the dues
are broken up according to wheth
er they are paid by men or women
students.
Financial discrimination be
cause of sex results from the
theory that men participate more
in athletics than do women. Thus,
men pay $1 to the Board of Ath
letic Control, while women pay
only half that amount.
WAA fiels Funds
As compensation, men pay only
$1.25 to the general ASSU fund,
while women contribute $1.75. But
the women are determined not to
be slighted on athletics, so the
extra 50 cents they plunk into Ihe
ASSU coffers is immediately turn
ed over to the Women's Athletic
Association.
Both men and women contribute
75 cents lo The Daily.
In addition to overseeing gen
eral ASSU funds, Mathewson is in
charge of the Students' Organiza
tions Fund, a bank for living
groups and clubs. All student liv
ing groups except fraternities and

eating clubs are to be
long to SOF.
SOF was begun in 1019 by Reg
istrar J. Pierce Mitchell, who
wanted lo protect group funds,
insure group solvency and shield
the University against student
debtor groups. Before 1919, Ma
thews on noted, these debtor
groups could cause real head
aches.
"For instance," he sai d, "a
bunch of fellows would have a
fling at some restaurant, tell the
waiter to charge it lo Encina, and
walk out. The Encina office would
be flabbergasted at receiving the
bill, and usually the University
would gel stuck with it."
Purchase Orders
Under Ihe present set-up, all
group funds are kept in the SOF,
and no merchandise may be or
dered without Ihe club's treasurer
first making out a purchase order
in which the student financial
manager certifies that the funds
are available.
The purchase order is given to
the merchant, who bills ihe SOF
directly and receives a check from
that office. All SOF business is
carried on in the Associated Stu
dents office, in ihe Union Build
ing.
Sometimes merchants become
confused over the account names.
Foi* example, the financial office
once received a letter concerning
the Wilbur llall account which
began, "I )ear Mr. I Jail."
Mathewson lias direct control
over the linaneial affairs of ASSU
groups • such as Cardinals and
AWS, bui serves only as an ad
viser for living groups.
Among non-financial duties of
Mathewson is that of appointing
the head student policeman, Ihe

movie manager a nit lifeguards. (
The student financial manager
himself is appointed for a one
year term by Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler.
Mathewson is no greenhorn for
his job. His father is in the bank
ing business, while he himself
served as treasurer of Stockton
College student body while a sen
ior in high school (at thai time
the college includ»*l the last lw<>
years of high school).
The student financial manager,
formerly called student manager,
receives $100 a month for his serv
ices. He has to spend some 40 lo
60 hours a week checking every
financial transaction carried <<ut
by student groups.
Draws l'p KudgH
The task of drawing up the
next year's budget also fails on
the student financial manager
every spring. He consults the pre
vious year's budget as well as club
treasurers. When he finishes his
draft he presents it to Legislature
for approval.
This year's ASSU budget comes
close to $40,000. After the budget
was drawn up last spring and
most of the money earmarked for
special purposes, nearly $3000 re
mained unappropriated.
This unappropriated amount is
what's known as the contingency
fund, a nest-egg for future use.
All appropriations made by Legis
lature this year came from $3000
left over after the budget was
prepared last spring.
Another job of Mathewson is
serving on Ihe governing boards
of the Bookstore and the Union
dining hall system. These outfits
are in a classification of their
own, since they operate independ
ently of the ASSU budget and the
Students' Organizations Fund.
