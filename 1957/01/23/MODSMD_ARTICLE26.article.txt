SACRAMENTO, Jan. 22 (UP)
-The president of Ihe California
Republican Assembly predicted
loday lhal Senator William F.
Knowland (R-Calif.) will not be
a candidate for governor in 1958.
Robert Fenton Craig told a. cau
cus of GOP state legislators that
he did not believe Knowland
would take any action which
would split the Republican party
in the state.
Craig went on to say that he
believed Knowland considers his
present position in the Senate as
a more important one than gov
ernor.
"The job (governor) would
clearly be a step down from party
leadership in the Senate and
would greatly reduce the plat
form from which he could com
ment on national issues," Craig
said.
The Republican Assembly is a
volunteer organization. It has no
official connection with the na
tional party.
