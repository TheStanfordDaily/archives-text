# Chappie Sells Again Today
## 
### 
So the Old Boy is trying to
do it again. The first wittier
quarter issue of the Stanford
Chaparral will appear today on
all four corners of Quad and at
the post office, attempting to
peddle its wares for 13f> cents.
It's featuring science fiction
and detective stories this month
along with its usual quota of
twice-told jokes.
Isut there's a big added at
traction, according to its ad
vance publicity, a fold-out page
with the queen's picture on it.
This is for pin-up art for all the
lower breeds.
