Championship Series'
Looking hack over his playing
memories, the 30-year-old physi
cal education major remembers
ihe '. r )0 baseball championship
games with Washington State.
"We lost two one-run games. We
all felt we'd have won seven of a
10 game series if we'd been able
to play one. Nothing wont right
for us in those days."
As a basketball player Clogg
remembers playing with George
Yardley when he (Yardley) was
going after Hank Luisetli's scor
ing records. "I used to pass to
Coorge when I could, to help him.
In return he'd try to throw to me
when I was clear. It was a nice
thing for him to do, but 1 was •a
poor shooter."
Coaching freshman ball has
been an exciting experience for
Clogg, lie feels Ik 1 is in a posi
tion to see many future "stars"
start their careers. Of the teams
he has handled Clogg says the
first, one was the most fun.
Selleck Was Best
"Coorge Selleck played on that
team," ho remembers, "and it had
ihe best record but probably the
least ability." Selleck impressed
the frosh mentor as "the host lit
He man I've ever seen, lie was a
leader and really made the team
•go'."

group according to Clogg. Where
as most freshman teams seem to
have about 112 ive varsity prospects.

I more, Clogg feels.
