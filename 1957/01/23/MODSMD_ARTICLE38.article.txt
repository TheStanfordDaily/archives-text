# FINALS FIRST
## Bears, Broncos Hit Books, Prep for Stanford Series 
### Dave Canfield 
I Stanford's basketball team is j
| finding an ally 1 his week in the j
form of final exams. It's finals
j week for both the Indians' week
| end opponents California and
' Santa Clara.
Santa Clara's Broncos, tied for
j first in the California Basketball |
Association, won't begin practic-1
j ing for Saturday's Pavilion till
until today because of finals.
Despite a need to hit books as'
well as baskets, the Cal Bears!
have been drilling hard all week I
1 for Friday's Pavilion clash with
the Big Red Machine. But the Cal j
five has the handicap of having to ,
! work out in a foreign gym.
Since finals are being held in j
Berkeley's gymnasium, the Bears j
have moved over to St. Mary's j
College for their practices this
week. Both Cal Coach Pete New
ell and Stanford mentor Howie I
Dallmar have gone on record as
I predicting Friday's battle will be
j a "real cliffhanger."
12th in Nation
Although rated 12th in the na
j tion by UP and 19th by AP, the
Bears reportedly are taking no
! chances on losing their first-place \
j perch Friday against the upset-j
! minded Indians.
The Cards, having already!
knocked tiile contenders Oregon!
State and Washington off the top j
of the Pacific Coast Conference
ladder, are gunning for their j
third big upset of the year.
Bill Bond, named as "Player of j
the Week" by sportswriters for
his Washington performances,!
will be leading the Stanfordites !
against Larry Friend and Cal. ;
Both forward Friend and forward
Bond have improved since last
year.
And even Ihen, Bond was good
enough to finish seventh and
Friend 13th in conference scor-1
ing. Pond, 101 h highest poinlmak-j
or in Stanford history, is pump- j
ing in jump shots to the tune of
14.5 points a game, tops for the
| Indians.
Deadly Set Shot
Friend, a 6 1 string bean whose i
specially is a deadly, booming set
shot, has rained IS.S points a
j game through the nets.
Neither team's defense can con- j
1 cent rate on Friend or Bond lo the
| neglect of I he other four starters,
I though. Cal also has two sure
I shot jumpers in juniors Don Me
' Intosh, forward, and Earl Robin
I son, guard; a flip em in rebound

or in center Duane Asphind, and
;i dribbling dervish in guard Gabe
Arrillaga.
Stanford counts on second-high
scorer (13.6 a game) Paul Neu
mann; forward Dick Haga, who
is perhaps the hottest shot on the
team; johnny - come - lately Carl
Isaacs at center, and captain and
piaymaker Hap Wagner at guard.
Haga and guard Neumann are
only sophomores and have been
improving with each game.
Good Reserves
Both teams have unusually
good reserve strength. Gathering
no splinters on Cal's highly active
bench are two-year veterans Mike
Diaz and Joe Hagler and juniors
Bernie Simpson and Ev McKeen.
Hagler stands 6-8 and will spell
Asplund at center.
Perhaps equally strong are
such Stanford "reserves" as hot
shooting Gary Van Galder (52 per
cent i, hard-driving John Pflue
gcr. toweijng Lee Leonard <6-7>
and aggressive Clint Waring.
The Santa Clara game Satur
day night may pit, as Bronco

hausted team (Stanford) against
a rusty one (Santa Clara).

Stanford counts on second-high

Good Reserves
Both teams have unusually
