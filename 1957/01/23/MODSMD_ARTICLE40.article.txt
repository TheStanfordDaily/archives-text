Meanwhile, an official of the
i National Boxing Association said

I featherweight champion.
Chairman Fred Saddy of the
NBA's rating committee made
the announcement after learning
of Sandy Saddler's retirement.
Saddler was stripped of his title
by the NBA last week for failure
to defend it.
Saddler's retirement, whi c h
startled boxing circles, was an
nounced by his manager, Charley
Johnston, following an examina
tion by Dr. Thomas W. Matthew.
'â€¢I have advised Sandy that if
he boxes again, ho will run a
grave risk of going completely
blind," Dr. Matthew said. "Sandy
is in agreemoHt although it
means giving up his livelihood.
"He still retains partial vision
and if he does not go back into
the ring, there is a fair chance he
will retain what sight he has
left."
Saddler, who has held his
championship longer than any
currently recognized titleholder
in any weight division, was in
jured in an automobile accident
here last July 27.
