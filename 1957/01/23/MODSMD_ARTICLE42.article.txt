# FOR 4500 YEARS
## New Museum Exhibit Depicts Growth of Chinese Porcelain 
### Terry Coddington 
Stanford Museum's newest exhibit is on the "Evolution of Chinese
Porcelain." It depicts the development of the finest Chinese porce
lain from its etude beginnings in 4500-year-old earthenware to the
finely colored and glazed art of the Sung Dynasty.
This exhibit, a composite of several private collections on long-

j term loans to the Museum, shows
examples of Neolithic earthen
ware <2500 8.C.), a rough, por
ous pottery fired at relatively
low temperature.
Stoneware of the Shang Dy
nasty (1766-1122 8.C.) is shown
with .some fragments of an ex-,
tremely rare type of highly re
fined pottery offering the first
hint of reproduceable porcelain.
However, the pottery on display
from succeeding dynasties shows
little of the same degree of re
finement for some 1500 years, ac
cording to Museum Curator John-
David Laplante.
Some accidental glaring of pot
tery which led to the eventual de
velopment of porcelain is shown
from the Chou Dynasty (1122-256
8.C.). The glazing occurred from
the fusion of the clay material it
self at higher 1 firing tempera
j tines, said Laplante.
Porcelain appears in the exhibit
j from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.
I to 220 A.D.). A definite glaze was
j employed for these pieces and
; styling reflects the influence of
j the Near East.
Since all ancient pottery is re
covered from tombs, little was re
covered from the turbulent Six
Dynasties period from 220 to 589
! A.D., Laplante said.
The exhibit includes several
i samples of true porcelain devel
oped early in the T'ang Dynasty
(618-907 A.D. i.
This exhibit is scheduled to be
! open through May 1, according to
; Curator Laplante.
Museum hours ar£ 1 to 5 p.m.
| daily. Admission is 25 cents, with
I Stanford students, faculty and
I staff admitted free.

j term loans to the Museum, shows
examples of Neolithic earthen
ware <2500 8.C.), a rough, por
ous pottery fired at relatively
low temperature.
Stoneware of the Shang Dy
nasty (1766-1122 8.C.) is shown
with .some fragments of an ex-,
tremely rare type of highly re
fined pottery offering the first
hint of reproduceable porcelain.
However, the pottery on display
from succeeding dynasties shows
little of the same degree of re
finement for some 1500 years, ac
cording to Museum Curator John-
David Laplante.
Some accidental glaring of pot
tery which led to the eventual de
velopment of porcelain is shown
from the Chou Dynasty (1122-256
8.C.). The glazing occurred from
the fusion of the clay material it
self at higher 1 firing tempera
j tines, said Laplante.
Porcelain appears in the exhibit
j from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.
I to 220 A.D.). A definite glaze was
j employed for these pieces and
; styling reflects the influence of
j the Near East.
Since all ancient pottery is re
covered from tombs, little was re
covered from the turbulent Six
Dynasties period from 220 to 589
! A.D., Laplante said.
The exhibit includes several
i samples of true porcelain devel
oped early in the T'ang Dynasty
(618-907 A.D. i.
This exhibit is scheduled to be
! open through May 1, according to
