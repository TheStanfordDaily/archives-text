# Hamilton's Ambition Whetted By Obstacles, Speaker Says
## Tuesday Series Marks Hamilton Bicentennial; Miller Says 'Audacity Keyed His Character' 
### Bev Johnson 
"Alexander Hamilton was temperamentally incapable of standing
in the shadow of any man," Professor John C. Miller told a Tuesday
Series audience last night. "Audacity was the key to his character."
"Hamilton entered the world through the left-hand door, but a little
too proudly and triumphantly to succeed," Miller said, speaking in
i commemoration of the Alexander

Hamilton bicentennial. "His am
| bition was whetted by the ob
stacles he encountered."
Miller, who holds the Edgar E.
Robinson professorship in United
United Stales history here, de
scribed Hamilton as a "national
ist to the core" who knew only
one thing, American union.
Hamilton's opposition to de
mocracy was explained by the
despotism of the majority which
he witnessed in the interval fol
lowing the Revolution. lie
thought of democracy as a "gov
ernment of the worst passions of
the worst men."
Democracy Hostile
Hamilton claimed, Miller said,
that democracy was hostile to
true liberty. People killed liberty
because they could not possess it
moderately.
Concentration of strong central
power was advocated by Hamil
ton, who regarded the slates as
the eternal enemies of national
government.
"Jefferson said Hamilton want
ed to establish a monarchy in the
United States," said Miller. When
Hamilton was Secretary of the
Treasury he attempted to create
a commercial independent, repub
lic of the United States.
Rear Heavy Deb!
Hamilton held the conviction
that the United Stales could bear
a heavy national debt through fu
ture exploitation of natural re
sources. In his breadth of vision,
Miller said, he foresaw today's
rise to power and the need for
creation of a firm and indissol
uble union.
Jefferson arid Hamilton clashed
on their ideas for the nation's
economy. The question lay be
tween an agricultural economy
(hat Jefferson believed would
i lead to happiness and a manufact
uring and industrial nation with
| future greatness as its aim.
Professor Miller is preparing a
three- or biography
: of Hamilton. He is the author of
I several other books.
