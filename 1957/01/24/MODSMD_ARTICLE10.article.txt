# Israel Claims Will Bar From Gaza Strip Permanently
## Arab Leaders Demand UN Impose Sanctions To Enforce Evacuation of Disputed Areas 
### 
JERUSALEM, Israel, Jan. 23 (UP)—Premier David Ben-Gurion
declared today Israel never will permit Egypt to return to the Gaza
Strip. He said Israel also will hold the west shore of the Gulf of
Aqaba until free navigation of the gulf is assured.
Arab leaders in New York replied to Ben-Gurion's declaration by

demanding that the United Na
tions impose sanctions on Israel
to enforce its demand for evacua
tion of the two disputed areas.
Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban
spent a half-hour with UN Secre
tary General Dag Hammarsk.jold
today, discussing the Gaza-Aqaba
situation.
"Sufficient Guaratnees"
Ben-Gurion said Israeli forces
will hold the Aqaba coast until
the United Nations or the neigh
boring Arab states offer "suffi
cient guarantees" that there will
be no interference with shipping
to or from the Israeli port of Ei
iat.
It had been clear for some time
that Israel intended to hold the
two areas indefinitely in defiance
of the UN, but Ben-Gurion's state
ments were the first formal decla
ration of its intentions.
Authoritative Israel sources
have declared repeatedly that
nothing the UN could do—neither
condemnation nor sanctions
could shake Israel's determina
tion.
Egypt has warned, on the other
hand, that it will not reopen the
Suez Canal until Israel has with
drawn from Gaza and the Aqaba
coast.
Reserved for Arabs
The Gaza Strip is an area re
served for Arabs under the Unit
ed Nations partition of Palestine.
Hassanein fteikal, a friend of
President Gamal A. Nasser, said
today in an article published by
the Cairo weekly Akher Saa that
the canal could be back in busi
ness in about six weeks if Israel
had evacuated the conquered tor
ritones by that time.
"If Israel resorts to procrasti
nation or attempts to derive gains
from her aggression, events will
take a different turn," lleikal
said.
Ben-Gurion left a sickbed to at
tend today's session of parlia
ment.
The premier said Israel would
be willing to withdraw troops
from the Gaza Strip as a conces
sion to the UN but that it would
insist on its police and other civil
officials remaining in the area.

declared today Israel never will permit Egypt to return to the Gaza
Strip. He said Israel also will hold the west shore of the Gulf of
Aqaba until free navigation of the gulf is assured.
Arab leaders in New York replied to Ben-Gurion's declaration by

demanding that the United Na
tions impose sanctions on Israel
to enforce its demand for evacua
tion of the two disputed areas.
Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban
spent a half-hour with UN Secre
tary General Dag Hammarsk.jold
today, discussing the Gaza-Aqaba
situation.
"Sufficient Guaratnees"
Ben-Gurion said Israeli forces
will hold the Aqaba coast until
the United Nations or the neigh
boring Arab states offer "suffi
cient guarantees" that there will
be no interference with shipping
to or from the Israeli port of Ei
iat.
It had been clear for some time
that Israel intended to hold the
two areas indefinitely in defiance
of the UN, but Ben-Gurion's state
ments were the first formal decla
ration of its intentions.
Authoritative Israel sources
have declared repeatedly that
nothing the UN could do—neither
condemnation nor sanctions
could shake Israel's determina
tion.
Egypt has warned, on the other
hand, that it will not reopen the
Suez Canal until Israel has with
drawn from Gaza and the Aqaba
coast.
Reserved for Arabs
The Gaza Strip is an area re
served for Arabs under the Unit
ed Nations partition of Palestine.
Hassanein fteikal, a friend of
President Gamal A. Nasser, said
today in an article published by
the Cairo weekly Akher Saa that
the canal could be back in busi
ness in about six weeks if Israel
had evacuated the conquered tor
ritones by that time.
"If Israel resorts to procrasti
nation or attempts to derive gains
from her aggression, events will
take a different turn," lleikal
said.
Ben-Gurion left a sickbed to at
tend today's session of parlia
ment.
The premier said Israel would
be willing to withdraw troops
from the Gaza Strip as a conces
sion to the UN but that it would
insist on its police and other civil
officials remaining in the area.
