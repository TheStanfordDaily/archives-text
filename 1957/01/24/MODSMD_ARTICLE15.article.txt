# Dean Cutting Quits Med School Job; Stays on Stanford Faculty
## Officials Express Surprise; Successor Is Not Yet Named Sterling Says His Work on Medical Center A 'Tremendous Contribution' to Stanford 
### 
Windsor V. Cutting, dean of the Medical School since 1953, hn
resigned his post to resume teaching and research, the University
announced yesterday.
No successor has been named. Cutting, 4'J, will remain on the
Medical School faculty.
A University spokesman said the resignation came as a surprise

to officials, although some of them
thought Cutting was "finding ad
ministrative work not entirely to
his liking."
Cutting, contacted at his cam
pus office, declined any comment
on reasons for resigning and said
he doesn't know yet the date when
he will relinquish his duties.
Not Eased Out
The spokesman said that "Dr.
Cutting was definitely not"eased
out. The resignation came from
him."
The letter of resignation was
received in President J. E. Wallace
Sterling's office last Friday, but
the spokesman said the announce
ment was to have been delayed
until Sterling's return from a trip
to the East.
Sterling is due back next Mon
day. The spokesman said the trip
concerns "other University busi
ness. He is not looking for a new
dean."
The spokesman discounted the
notion that the move of the medi
cal school from San Francisco to
the local campus caused Cutting's
resignation. "This sort of thing
was part of the administrative
burden," he said.
Graduated in 1928
Cutting was graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from Stanford in 1928 and
received the M.D. degree in 1932.
From 1931 to 1935 he served as a
house officer in the Stanford-Lane
Hospital, a San Francisco branch
of the Medical School.
He spent the years 1935 and
1036 as a natural research fellow
at the Courtabauld Institute of
Biochemistry in London. Cutting
then served as a Johns Hopkins
fellow in pharmacology until 1938.
That year Cutting was appointed
to the Medical School faculty and
in September 1953 he was named
acting dean.
The dean is an authority on
virus diseases and antibiotic won
der drugs and has written more
than 100 professional papers on
these subjects. He is the author
of two books, "Manual of Clinical
Therapeutics" and "Actions and
Uses of Drugs."
Sterling Praises
Sterling, in a statement issued
in New York, praised Dean Cut
ting's "tremendous contributions
to the medical school program as
we went through the arduous
work of planning the move . . .
and the laying out of a new cur
riculum.
"He devoted himself tu'elessly
to his dream of a great medical
center on the campus, and, now
that the project is so close to be
coming actuality, I can under
stand why he might wish to re
turn to his teaching and research.
"Dean Cutting has earned the
thanks of everyone interested in
the progress of medicine."
Sterling prefaced his remarks
by saying he had had no chance
to talk with Cutting on his resig
nation and therefore would find
it difficult to discuss.
The president expressed hope
that the successor will take up
where Cutting left off and con
tinue to "forge ahead" with Medi
cal School plans.

Sterling Praises
Sterling, in a statement issued
in New York, praised Dean Cut
ting's "tremendous contributions
to the medical school program as
we went through the arduous
work of planning the move . . .
and the laying out of a new cur
riculum.
"He devoted himself tu'elessly
to his dream of a great medical
center on the campus, and, now
that the project is so close to be
coming actuality, I can under
stand why he might wish to re
turn to his teaching and research.
"Dean Cutting has earned the
thanks of everyone interested in
the progress of medicine."
Sterling prefaced his remarks
by saying he had had no chance
to talk with Cutting on his resig
nation and therefore would find
it difficult to discuss.
The president expressed hope
that the successor will take up
where Cutting left off and con
tinue to "forge ahead" with Medi
cal School plans.

Instrumental in Medical School Move
Windsor V. Cutting, dean of the Medical School since 1953, hn
resigned his post to resume teaching and research, the University
announced yesterday.
No successor has been named. Cutting, 4'J, will remain on the
Medical School faculty.
A University spokesman said the resignation came as a surprise

to officials, although some of them
thought Cutting was "finding ad
ministrative work not entirely to
his liking."
Cutting, contacted at his cam
pus office, declined any comment
on reasons for resigning and said
he doesn't know yet the date when
he will relinquish his duties.
Not Eased Out
The spokesman said that "Dr.
Cutting was definitely not"eased
out. The resignation came from
him."
The letter of resignation was
received in President J. E. Wallace
Sterling's office last Friday, but
the spokesman said the announce
ment was to have been delayed
until Sterling's return from a trip
to the East.
Sterling is due back next Mon
day. The spokesman said the trip
concerns "other University busi
ness. He is not looking for a new
dean."
The spokesman discounted the
notion that the move of the medi
cal school from San Francisco to
the local campus caused Cutting's
resignation. "This sort of thing
was part of the administrative
burden," he said.
Graduated in 1928
Cutting was graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from Stanford in 1928 and
received the M.D. degree in 1932.
From 1931 to 1935 he served as a
house officer in the Stanford-Lane
Hospital, a San Francisco branch
of the Medical School.
He spent the years 1935 and
1036 as a natural research fellow
at the Courtabauld Institute of
Biochemistry in London. Cutting
then served as a Johns Hopkins
fellow in pharmacology until 1938.
That year Cutting was appointed
to the Medical School faculty and
in September 1953 he was named
acting dean.
The dean is an authority on
virus diseases and antibiotic won
der drugs and has written more
than 100 professional papers on
these subjects. He is the author
of two books, "Manual of Clinical
Therapeutics" and "Actions and
Uses of Drugs."
