# Less Time Over Nothing
## 
### 
Last year it chased itself around in silly circles
of red tape and insignificant technicalities. But
this year it merely exists in a state of sleepy
inertia.
Stanford's student legislature—theoretically
the nerve center of student government —lias
become little more than a clearing-house for
bylaw changes, minutes and other technical
business of campus organizations.
At least this year Legislature takes less time
to do nothing than it did last year —and this
is to their credit. Under the heavy gavel of
ASSU Preside Bob Freelen, Legislature has
unsnarled byia*. tangles that would have tied
last year's Legislature in knots for hours.
But still nothing of any significance has been
done.
Committees have been appointed to study
pertinent problems, but, on the whole, there
has been no enthusiasm to do these "extra
curricular"' chores.
The prevailing attitude has been: "Let's get
this over and go home. There are more impor
tant things to do." A t idly enough, there is
justification for this attitude.
There are v. ry things that Legislature could
be.
It could be an effective and representative

voice of the students on local, national and
international levels. It is not.
It could be the forum from which could
develop searching discussions pertinent to uni
versity life. It is not.
Not only does it not interest students on
campus, but apparently it doesn't even interest
most Legislature members.
But the blame for this governmental void
cannot rest entirely with Legislature. In fact,
many Legislature members, including Freelen,
have tried hard to pump new life into the
hollow legislative skeleton.
The issues with which a student legislature
should properly grapple are simply of little
consequence to most students. Their life at
Stanford would go on in much the same man
ner with or without student government —and
they know it.
The point is that student government can
have no life or meaning unless there is a de
mand for it. 11 is a vicious circle—there is no
demand because there is no meaning, and no
meaning because no demand.
The situation will not change until Stanford
students change, until ihey begin to care a little
about I hep roblems that face a university com
munity as a whole. The prospect for change
does not look' bright.

pertinent problems, but, on the whole, there
has been no enthusiasm to do these "extra
curricular"' chores.
The prevailing attitude has been: "Let's get
this over and go home. There are more impor
tant things to do." A t idly enough, there is
justification for this attitude.
There are v. ry things that Legislature could
be.
It could be an effective and representative

voice of the students on local, national and
international levels. It is not.
It could be the forum from which could
develop searching discussions pertinent to uni
versity life. It is not.
Not only does it not interest students on
campus, but apparently it doesn't even interest
most Legislature members.
But the blame for this governmental void
cannot rest entirely with Legislature. In fact,
many Legislature members, including Freelen,
have tried hard to pump new life into the
hollow legislative skeleton.
The issues with which a student legislature
should properly grapple are simply of little
consequence to most students. Their life at
Stanford would go on in much the same man
ner with or without student government —and
they know it.
The point is that student government can
have no life or meaning unless there is a de
mand for it. 11 is a vicious circle—there is no
demand because there is no meaning, and no
meaning because no demand.
The situation will not change until Stanford
students change, until ihey begin to care a little
about I hep roblems that face a university com
munity as a whole. The prospect for change
does not look' bright.
Last year it chased itself around in silly circles
of red tape and insignificant technicalities. But
this year it merely exists in a state of sleepy
inertia.
Stanford's student legislature—theoretically
the nerve center of student government —lias
become little more than a clearing-house for
bylaw changes, minutes and other technical
business of campus organizations.
At least this year Legislature takes less time
to do nothing than it did last year —and this
is to their credit. Under the heavy gavel of
ASSU Preside Bob Freelen, Legislature has
unsnarled byia*. tangles that would have tied
last year's Legislature in knots for hours.
But still nothing of any significance has been
done.
Committees have been appointed to study
pertinent problems, but, on the whole, there
has been no enthusiasm to do these "extra
curricular"' chores.
