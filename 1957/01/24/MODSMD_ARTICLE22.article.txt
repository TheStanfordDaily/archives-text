# CAMPUS OPINION
## What Meaning Does the ASSU Have? 
### 
Years ago, the right of self-government on a
college campus was won through Ihe persistent
efforts of dedicated students. Now nearly every
college or university has student government, in
one form or another.
Do Stanford students care about their right to
self-government? Does student government
mean anything to the Stanford individual, or the
community as a whole?
Gary Smith, '57, off-campus: "Student govern
rnent can have any number of meanings to the
Stanford community depending upon the collec
tive attitudes of the individuals in the student
body. If that attitude is one of apathy, then stu
dent government has little, if any, real meaning.
If, however, the students show interest in their
government, then it will be of value in promoting
more favorable attitudes toward government in
later years."
Perry Gambour, graduate, off•campus: "Stu
dent participation is nil. Nobody seems to care.
If students would take an active interest it would
be more important. I suppose the officers are
really itnerested. but they seem to run only for
the honor involved."
Nancy Shires, *60, Branner: "I find Stanford
student government a refreshing change from
high school-type government because there is no
social pressure to take part in the government,
yet it is there to handle the many problems
which arise in a community of this kind and
size."
T. Michael Ward, T>9, Theta Delia Chi: "I
think student government has two important
purposes. First, it should provide good activities
for the group it governs; and secondly, it should

teach those who actively participate how to han
dle people and administer affairs. I believe stu
dent government definitely has ;i function and a
place here at Stanford."
Sara McGrath, '60, Roble: "Student govern
ment offers the opportunity to develop a sense
of responsibility for later in life. You learn how
to react to different situations and to become ac
quainted with more people. It,gives your activi
ties more purpose, with a teeling that you are
doing something outside of and bigger than your
personal college life."
Ann Galbraith, '(50, Branner: "I feel that stu
dent government makes sure that 1 get a fair
chance in deciding what will happen on campus.
It protects the students from being controlled by
faculty and gives them an opportunity to develop
their own ideas. 1 think most Stanford students
are interested in what happens in students' gov
ernment but do not take an active part because
their time is limited."
Bob Bernstein, graduate, off • campus: "It
seems to me that there's less interest here than
at some other schools. Ideally, I suppose it would
be the sounding board of opinions of students on
all the variousp hases of academic and social
life."
Katy Smith, 'HO, Branner: "I am a good ex
ample of the apathetic Stanford student. The
student government doesn't affect me too much
and I'm not really interested in it since there are
so many other things more important, like
classes and lectures. Also, I don't think that one
can draw a parallel between participation in col
lege government and interest in the national gov
ernment."
