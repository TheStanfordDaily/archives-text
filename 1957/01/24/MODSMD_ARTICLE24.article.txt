Editor, The Daily:
1 was rather amused to read the series on
women's social regulations, particularly where ii
referred to "protecting the women's interests"
if in not those exact words, at least that implica
tion.
This theory of protection seems very much
out of line with the avowed Stanford policy of
treating its students as adults.
Young women of 17 or 18 are adults physi
cally, and they should be expected to be adults
mentally as well. If some cannot control them
selves, let them leave; they will be no loss.
But it is highly undesirable to impose such
tilings as hours-to-be in on Stanford women, not
because some don't need restrictions, but because
some do.
The only way people learn is by taking re
sponsibility for their own actions, not by merely
obeying childish rules. AWS restrictions keep
children children, and only lei them grow up at
the approved speed, which is far too slow. The
rules unnecessarily hinder those who do not re
quire them to behave.
The Social Regulations of the AWS are mani-

testations of certain American puritanical trends,
and contribute to the tendency in this country of
onl> letting people grow up at the conventionally
slow rate A; T e is a- v*-ry imperfect guide to ma
turity.

Editor, The Daily:
Several of us have noticed the tragic waste
of produce from the various types of fruit irees
which adorn the Stanford campus. 1 say adorn
because apparently the trees serve no other pur
I»>se.
li seems a shame to lei the fruit ripen and
then rot away. II seems even more of a shame
someone responsible for their heing here does
nothing about if.
1 wonder if the fruit couldn't be put to some
good use. Instead of, or rather, in addition to,
sending money to Hungary, or, for that matter,
any country in need of food supplies, why not
send a few baskets of oranges. II may seem like
a small thing, but it somehow seems just as sen
sible as lo allow the present waste to persist.
Maybe the Cellar could use the fruit.

Several of us have noticed the tragic waste
of produce from the various types of fruit irees
which adorn the Stanford campus. 1 say adorn
because apparently the trees serve no other pur
I»>se.
li seems a shame to lei the fruit ripen and
then rot away. II seems even more of a shame
someone responsible for their heing here does
nothing about if.
1 wonder if the fruit couldn't be put to some
good use. Instead of, or rather, in addition to,
sending money to Hungary, or, for that matter,
any country in need of food supplies, why not
send a few baskets of oranges. II may seem like
a small thing, but it somehow seems just as sen
sible as lo allow the present waste to persist.
Maybe the Cellar could use the fruit.

Editor, The Daily:
1 was rather amused to read the series on
women's social regulations, particularly where ii
referred to "protecting the women's interests"
if in not those exact words, at least that implica
tion.
This theory of protection seems very much
out of line with the avowed Stanford policy of
treating its students as adults.
Young women of 17 or 18 are adults physi
cally, and they should be expected to be adults
mentally as well. If some cannot control them
selves, let them leave; they will be no loss.
But it is highly undesirable to impose such
tilings as hours-to-be in on Stanford women, not
because some don't need restrictions, but because
some do.
The only way people learn is by taking re
sponsibility for their own actions, not by merely
obeying childish rules. AWS restrictions keep
children children, and only lei them grow up at
the approved speed, which is far too slow. The
rules unnecessarily hinder those who do not re
quire them to behave.
The Social Regulations of the AWS are mani-

testations of certain American puritanical trends,
and contribute to the tendency in this country of
onl> letting people grow up at the conventionally
slow rate A; T e is a- v*-ry imperfect guide to ma
turity.
