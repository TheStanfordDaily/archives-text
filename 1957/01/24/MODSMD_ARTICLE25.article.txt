# Panofsky Describes Soviet Conference
## 
### 
A strong precedent in interna
tional foreign policy was broken
lasl May when the Soviet govern
ment allowed the Russian Acad
emy of Science to invite American
physicists to a physics conference
in Russia.
Wolfgang Panofsky, Stanford
professor of high-energy nuclear
physics, was among those who
went on the tour of Russian tech
nological laboratories. Tuesday at
the "Y" Public Affairs luncheon
in the Women's Clubhouse, Panof
sky told his impressions of Russia.
The conference, sponsored by
the Soviet government, was initi
ated by recently published prog
ress reports of nuclear physics
achievements in the Soviet Union.
Panofsky's visit was centered
mostly around.a large high-energy
physics laboratory north of Mos
cow.
The lab was well constructed
and contained the rnosl modern
equipment, in contrast to homes
and shops it. The equip
ment and facilities were far be
hind the education expended on
physics and engineering, however.
The quality of the products was
good, Panofsky said, but there
was a definite lack of originality:
the experiments tried were always
certain to succeed instead of being
speculative.
"Social Elite"
The social position of Russian
people in technological work is
good, according to Panofsky.
"They and the lop government of
ficials form the social elite," he
said. "Whereas a skilled laborer
might receive 800-1000 rubles a
month [a ruble is worth about 10
cents], undergraduate physicists
are paid 1500 rubles a month and
graduates 2000.
"Technicians' standards of liv
ing have improved, too. This is a
change that began in Russia two
or three years ago, after the death
of Stalin. They are allowed much
more freedom of experimentation
than formerly," Panofsky said.
He told of one scientist he met
who remarked about the change
of scientific social status. "In his
circle of acquaintances no one had
been arrested for nearly two
years," he said.

Since all Soviet government
spending is being put into science
and the military, Panofsky ex-1
plained that the civilian conditions j
he observed were still primitive.!
The translator who accompanied I
him was one of the few Russians'
with a car, which he earned by
translating the works of Jack
London into Russian.
Misleading Publicity
Panofsky stated that publicity
about the lack of technicians in
the United Stales is misleading.
There are more Soviet engineers!
at the intermediate level than in
the U.S., but the number at higher
and lower levels of engineering is
comparable.
It is true, Panofsky said, thai
more R us si a n students study
physics and engineering than do
U.S. students, but education is on
a much more competitive basis in|
Russia, with a curriculum similar;
to that of pre-war Europe.
The University of Moscow has

about 20,000 students, 2000 of
whom are physics majors.
The amount oJÂ» pro-Western feel
ing and criticism of the Soviet
government among Russian scien
lists "amazed" Panofsky. He said
they were "very eager" to trade
technical information, and he
found them "extremely well read
and trained."
Women Encouraged
Soviet women with technologi
cal skills are encouraged to prac
tice them.
Panofsky was "impressed by
the friendliness of Hie Soviet peo
ple."
"It was clear that good will was
just turned on for general mutual
benefit, and, in light of the Hun
garian incident, this seems hypo
critical," he added.
In answer to another question,
Panofsky decided that the average
Russian citizen does not have a
realistic idea of life in the United
Slates. "They do not know of Ihe
equalizing influence of income
tax," he concluded.
