WHO WENT TO THE PROM
...AND WHY
"Hello," said the voice on the telephone. "This in
Werther Sigafooe."
"Who?" said Anna Livia Plurabelle.
"Werther Sigafoos," said Werther Sigafoos. "I sit
next to you in psych. I'm kind of dumpy and I always
wear a sweatshirt."
"I'm afraid I don't remember you," said Anna Livia.
"I'm the one whose lecture notes you've been borrow
ing for two years," said Werther.
"Oh, yes!" she said. "What do you wish, Walter?"
"Werther," said Werther. "What I wish is to I:ike
you to the Junior Prom next April."
"That's months away, Westnor," said Anna Livia.
"Werther," said Werther. "Yes, I know, but you are
so round and beautiful th;it I was afraid you might
have ;i date already."
"As a matter of fact I do, Wingate," said Anna Livia.
"Werther," said Werther. "Oh, drat!"

Anna Livia did not really have a date, but she was
expecting to be asked by Stewart Stalwart, athlete and
BMOC, handsome as Apollo, smooth as ivory, driver of
a 2.9 litre Bugatti, wearer of faultless tweeds, smoker
of Philip Morris Cigarettes, which, even without his
other achievements, would by itself stamp him as a man
of discrimination, as the possessor of a pleasure-oriented
palate, as one who smoked for the pure joy of it, who had
sought and found a cigarette brimming over with zest
and zip and hearty good fellowship — Philip Morris!
Well sir, Anna Livia waited for Stewart to ask her,
but two days before the Prom, to everybody's amazement,
he asked Rose-of-Sharon Kinsolving, a nondescript girl
with pavement colored hair and a briefcase.
Anna Livia sobbed for a spell and then, not wishing
to miss the most gala event of the junior year, she
phoned Werther Sigafoos.
"My Prom date has come down with a dread virus,"
she said, "and I'll accept your invitation, Waldrop."
"Werther," said Werther. "Oh, goody ganders!"
The next day Anna Livia received a phone call from
Stewart Stalwart. "My Prom date has come down with
a dread virus," he said. "Will you go with me?"
"Certainly," she said and immediately phoned Wer
ther and said, "I have come down with a dread virus and
cannot go to the Prom with you, Whipstitch."
"Werther," said Werther. "Oh, mice and rats!"
So Anna Livia went to the Prom with Stewart and
who do you think they ran into? Rose-of-Sharon with
Werther, that's who!
Stewart had felt obliged to ask Rose-of-Sharon be
cause she always did his homework, but she had weaseled
out because she really wanted to go with Werther with
whom she felt a great oneness because they were both
so dumpy. He fell wildly in love with her at the Prom,
and today they are married and run a very successful
five-minute auto-wash in New Bern, N. C.
Anna Livia and Stewart are happy too. They are
still juniors and have not missed a Prom in six years.
