# Indians Face Greater Height, Experience in California Game
## 
### Dave Canfield 
Experience, size and skill ver
sus youlhful drive and fight.
Thai is likely to be the story
tomorrow night at 8:30 when the
California Bears and the Stanford
Indians take the Pavilion floor in
what has been predicted by both
opposing coaches as a basketball
battle down to the wire.
Coach Pete Newell's Bears are
a veteran team with not a single
sophomore in the starting lineup.
Superior experience and skill have
given them onesided conference
wins over Washington State
(twice), Oregon (twice) and Stan
ford (once) this season. The
Berkeleyites rank in first place.
Stanford will open with two
sophomores tomorrow night, high
scoring guard Paul Neumann and
forward Dick llaga. The Indians
have a 2-3 record in the Pacific
roast Conference, but have tan
gled wiih tougher teams than
have the Bears namely Washing
/on and Oregon State.
And Coach Howie Dallmar's
quintet is reportedly improved
since the 59'15 humbling at the
Bears' hands on .lan. 8. As Newell
has said: "I know we'll have to
play as well or better [to beat
Stanford again]. They've added
Carl Isaacs, and it was apparent
last Kriday that it's an improved
team."
Isaacs Shows Stuff
Isaacs did not report for aclion
until, after the East-West football
game. Last week end's Washing
ton double-header marked the (5-3
redhead's first real chance to show
his stuff and he came through for
27 points, nearly half his 1955-56
season's total.
Isaacs' only drawback Friday
and Saturday was trying to keep
his new set of contact lenses in
place. "If it happens [this] P'ri
day," said Newell, "there'll be five
Stanfords trying to find it and
five Bears trying to lose it."
The Bears won't need to remove
Isaacs' contact lenses to give the
Cards a rough lime, though. Ex
perience, height and "on paper"
form all favor the Newellmen.
.Much Height
At center the Bears boast 6-8
.Toe Ilagler on the bench and 6-6
Duane Asplund in the starting
lineup. At forward they will start
6-6 Don Mcintosh and 6-4 Larry
Friend, giving their forward wall
an average height of 6-s'ft.
Tallest Indian, Lee Leonard,
stands (5-7 and he's a reserve. No
man on the Cards' starting five

stretches as high as Iho Bear for
ward wall's average
Experience-wise, iho boys from
the other side of the Bay will tip
off with a starting quintet com
posed completely of lettermen.
Two Juniors
Only guards Earl Robinson and
Gabe Arrillaga are juniors, and
Robinson made the All-PCC sec
ond team lust winter.
On paper, the Bears have run
up an 11-2 record thus far against
the Indians' 6-8. The Newellmen
are building on a nine-game win
ning streak. Their only losses
have come at the hands of last
yea r's national champion San
Francisco Dons, 70-56, and this
year's predicted national cham
pion Kansas Jayhawks. 66-56.
San Jose State, which took the
Cards into camp, 59-55, later met
the Bear Machine and lost by 22
points.
But hope is not gone in Indian
land. Coach Howie Dallmar, who
correctly predicted the Dec. 15
Rice gatne would have a one-point
verdict (Stanford 65, Rice 64 I, has
gone on record as saying tomor
row's clash will be a "real cliff
hanger." The Pavilion will he
packed with fans hoping to see
just that.


DP AND OVKR â€”Indian guard Paul Neumann eyes tlie basket as
lie prepares In add to the Cardinal .scoring in the first ( al game
of the season. Guarding him are Bear center Duane Asplund and
an unidentified player.
