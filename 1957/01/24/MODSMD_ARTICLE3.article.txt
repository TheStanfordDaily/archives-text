### 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Jan. 23
(UP)â€”Segregationist Asa (Ace)
Carter was charged today with
intent to murder two Ku Klux
Klansmen, only 21 hours before
he planned to announce his candi
dacy for city police commissioner.
Carter, an adviser to the Klan
and executive secretary of the big
North Alabama White Citizens
Council, was accused of wounding
two men in an intra-Klan shooting
at a meeting of some 50 hooded
and robed members last night.
Carter's attorney, R. B. Jones,
told United Press tonight his cli
ent had planned either to qualify
or announce his candidacy for the
police commissioner post tomor
row, but that such action "was
blocked" by the charges placed
against him.
The fiery segregationist has
been leading a drive to oust Police
Commissioner Robert Lindbergh
in the May 7 city elections. Carter
and his followers claim Lindbergh
is not doing all within his power
to quell local Negroes' pro-inte
gration movements.
Carter Had hinted he was in-
Icrested in running for the past
several weeks, but his attorney's
announcement tonight was the
first definite word that he plan
ned to make the; race.
Carter surrendered to police
shortly before noon and was jailed
under $20,000 bond.
His brother, Douglas Carter,
who assists in Citizens Council
work, said ii would probably be
tomorrow before the bail could be
raised.
