# Ike, Humphrey Deny Budget Disagreement
## Agree Spending Is 'Higher than Desired'; Congress Cut Possible 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP) -
President Eisenhower and Treas
ury Secretary George Humphrey
acted today to scotch reports that
they disagreed over the size of
the President's new $71.8 billion
budget.
The President told a news con
ference Humphrey expressed "my
convictions very thoroughly"
when I lie Cabinet officer said that
federal spending is higher than
desirable, and can possibly be cut
by Congress.
At the same time, Humphrey
l old the House Appropriations
Committee he had "no criticism
of the budget at this moment" and
was not prepared to recommend
any cuts.
What appeared to be an intra-
Administration controversy boiled
up last week when Humphrey told
reporters "there are a lot of
places" the new budget, highest
in peacetime history, can be cut.
"Hair-Curling" Depression
The Secretary went on to say
that continued high federal spend
ing would lead to a "hair-curling"
depression.
Asked about the matter today,
Eisenhower said he had talked
with Humphrey very recently and
could report that the Treasury
chief "wasn't talking about the
immediate future" in voicing fear
of a possible depression.
Actually, the President said,
"the outlook for the next few
months in the economic field is
very good indeed."
Pinpoint Ideas
The House committee called on
Humphrey to pinpoint ways he
thought the budget could be cut.
A summary of his closed - door
testimony was given to newsmen
by committee chairman Clarcnce
Cannon ID-Mo.i, who has called
the new budget "unconscionable."
Cannon said Humphrey "ex
pressed himself as being alarmed
a I the trend of expenditures," but
"declined to point out where cuts
can be made."
The Secretary, who attended the
briefing, challenge Cannon's state
ment that Humphrey "has public
ly said there are many places to
cut" the budget.
Humphrey said he had merely
voiced hope that ways could bo
found, both by Congress and Iho
executive departments, to reduce
spending.
Senator Styles Bridges (R-N.H.)
said, "I'm glad we have men in
government who holievc in econ
omy and are willing lo apply it."
Bridges, ranking Republican on
the Senate Appropriations Com
mit lee, said, "If I can find a way
lo cut this budget, I'm going to
do it."

any cuts.
What appeared to be an intra-
Administration controversy boiled
up last week when Humphrey told
reporters "there are a lot of
places" the new budget, highest
in peacetime history, can be cut.
"Hair-Curling" Depression
The Secretary went on to say
that continued high federal spend
ing would lead to a "hair-curling"
depression.
Asked about the matter today,
Eisenhower said he had talked
with Humphrey very recently and
could report that the Treasury
chief "wasn't talking about the
immediate future" in voicing fear
of a possible depression.
Actually, the President said,
"the outlook for the next few
months in the economic field is
very good indeed."
Pinpoint Ideas
The House committee called on
Humphrey to pinpoint ways he
thought the budget could be cut.
A summary of his closed - door
testimony was given to newsmen
by committee chairman Clarcnce
Cannon ID-Mo.i, who has called
the new budget "unconscionable."
Cannon said Humphrey "ex
pressed himself as being alarmed
a I the trend of expenditures," but
"declined to point out where cuts
can be made."
The Secretary, who attended the
briefing, challenge Cannon's state
ment that Humphrey "has public
ly said there are many places to
cut" the budget.
Humphrey said he had merely
voiced hope that ways could bo
found, both by Congress and Iho
executive departments, to reduce
spending.
Senator Styles Bridges (R-N.H.)
said, "I'm glad we have men in
government who holievc in econ
omy and are willing lo apply it."
Bridges, ranking Republican on
the Senate Appropriations Com
mit lee, said, "If I can find a way
lo cut this budget, I'm going to
do it."
