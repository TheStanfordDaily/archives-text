KEPLER'S KWIK KOURSE No. 9
The History of Western Civilization
In the beginning there was no Western Civilization . . .
Throughout Europe, Brifein and the Americas, simple peoples lived
in relative harmony. Some, like the Eskimos, didn't even have a word (or
the concept) "war." Indeed, life; was on a primitive, uncivilised level.
Then a flourishing Civilization emerged in Crcece. Within a few
hundred years the Creeks destroyed and emasculated their socicty through
unending internecine warfare.
Next, the short swords were taken up by the simple, sturdy Romans
who in a few hundred years conquered the world and brought Civilization
through a never-ending series of wars. This culminated in the Dark Ages.
In the age of chivalry a new feudal socicty carrying the Christian Banner
brought Civilization through warfare to Europe. Christ's soldiers bludg
eoned their way to the Holy Land, and Allah's warriors clashed into southern
France and to Constantinople.
Civilization flourished.
Came the Renaissance, Machiavclli and the Borgias. Poison, knife,
bribery and war carried Civilization to new heights. The Christians, having
defeated the Moslems, now carried on great wars among themselves as
Protestant and Catholic smote and burned one another. The Jews were
confined, between pogroms, in Ghettoes.
Religion and Western Civilization grew ever greater.
In the 16th and 17th Centuries the Nation States and Absolute
Monarchs carved new places in the sun. Men died, women wept, children
starved and Civilization flourished.
The French Revolution for Liberte, Eqalite, Fraternite "liberated"
thousands from their lives in France & Europe. It brought "equality"
through the Levee en masse: all were equally conscripted. The "fraternity"
was that of arms as wars were fought from 1 790 until 1815.
Out of Liberte emerged the Dictator Napoleon. Civilization flourished.
In 1815 Napoleon fell. The Congress of Vienna settled matters so well
that in the years following Civilization flourished as wars and incipient
revolutions broke out all over Europe. .
Britain enlarged and consolidated its empire, its fleet operating by
bomb and sword bringing Civilization to the "Lesser Breeds."
The United States, victorious in its war against Britain, brought Civili
zation to the American Indians throughout the I 9th Century—by massacre,
alcohol, lies, concentration camps, making and breaking treaties, war and
other civilized methods. This effort was so successful that by 1900 there
was hardly an uncivilized Indian left. In fact, there was hardly an Indian
left.
All this brought us to the 20th Century, World Wars I & 11, the Rus
sian Revolution, Hitler's Europe, the Cold War and the H Bomb.
Civilization flourishes.
If, after all this, you still wonder what Lockheed is doing over there
on Stanford land, the next time you're out with your ROTC unit, march
over and see.
