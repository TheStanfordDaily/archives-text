# Memorial Church Celebrates 54th Anniversary Today
## 
### Rich Brown 
It was 54 years ago today,
Jan. 25, 1903, that one of the
fondest dreams of Jane Lathrop
Stanford was realized—the open
ing of Stanford Memorial
Church.
Mrs. Stanford had planned
that the church should be the
physical as well as the spiritual
center of the University. On that
Sunday morning more than half
a century ago some 2500 crowd
ed into the magnificent struc
ture, with its 80 - foot Roman
esque tower, for the dedication
service.
Today the church continues to
fulfill the plans of the University
founders. Regular non-denomi
national Sunday services are
augmented by Wednesday eve
ning candlelight services, month

ly Holy Communion services and
informal discussions.
Leader of church activities is
the Rev. R. M. Minto, University
chaplain. In addition to his "for
mal" duties with the church, lie
is available to all students for
consultation.
Rev. Minto, who has been at
Stanford since 1947, was born in
Glasgow, Scotland, and attended
Glasgow University. He did
graduate work at New York's
Union Theological Seminary and
spent time as a minister in Ma
laya and later as a British Navy
chaplain.
This year he will deliver I he
main address at the convention
of the National Association of
College and University Chap
lains lo be held in April at Uni
versity of Michigan. Rev. Minto
is also a member of I lie Literary

Award jury of the Common
wealth Club of California.
Helping Rev. Minto is Assist
ant Chaplain Thomas S. Derr,
who counsels students and pre
sides over meetings of the Coun
cil of Religious Affairs. This
group is composed of presidents
of various student denomina
tional groups.
Another organization is the
Memorial Church Committee,
composed of student volunteers,
which provides ushers, conducts
the candlelight services and pro
motes discussion.
Betty Camm is church secre
tary. while Eleanor Alton, a
graduate student, organizes dis
cussions and counsels students.
The church, in conjunction
with the Department of Educa
tion, operates a Sunday school
for children. This school, under

the direction of Charles Mere
dith, is staffed entirely by Stan
ford students.
Memorial Church Choir, di
rected by Harold C. Schmidt,
sings the anthems at Sunday
services, accompanied by Uni
versity Organist Herbert B. Nan
ney. Before and after each serv
ice sophomore John F. Mullen
plays the carillon bells in Hoover
Tower.
Until the church was complet
ed, services were held in the
chapel, the building now occu
pied by the Dean of Students
Office. The chapel, the name of
which has given rise to the mis
nomer applied to the church, was
destined to see service again, for
the church was severely dam
aged in the 1906 earthquake.
Fortunately for Mrs. Stanford,
she did not live to see the church

with its demolished tower and
blown-out facade.
The church reopened in 1913,
a decade after its original dedi
cation. Since funds were not im
mediately available for rebuild
ing the tower, a temporary wood
en roof was built over the tower
base. This "temporary" roof is
still there.
The clock and chimes which
had been in the original tower
were placed in a wooden tower
behind the church, another "tem
porary" structure.
Memorial Church for many
years was the scene of Stan
ford's commencement exercises.
It was the church which first
published a student handbook.
And it is in Memorial Church
that many students and alumni
choose to be married.
Although the church is nor

mally open only when the Uni
versity is in session, a special
Christmas program was held
last month.
With floodlights illuminating
the front mosaic, the church
hosted a large group for <a
Christmas Eve service. A 60-
member choir was composed of
teen-age children of the Stanford
faculty. Another service follow
ed on Christmas Day.
Thousands of visitors come an
nually to see the church. It is
worth noting that in reporting
the 1906 earthquake the London
Times referred to the church as
"perhaps the most beautiful of
all buildings in the United
States."
But most important is not the
physical plant of the church;
rather it is the spiritual influ
ence which it exerts on the lead
ers of tomorrow.

MEMORIAL CHURCH ALTAR
Famed Edifice Moves into 54th Year
It was 54 years ago today,
Jan. 25, 1903, that one of the
fondest dreams of Jane Lathrop
Stanford was realized—the open
ing of Stanford Memorial
Church.
Mrs. Stanford had planned
that the church should be the
physical as well as the spiritual
center of the University. On that
Sunday morning more than half
a century ago some 2500 crowd
ed into the magnificent struc
ture, with its 80 - foot Roman
esque tower, for the dedication
service.
Today the church continues to
fulfill the plans of the University
founders. Regular non-denomi
national Sunday services are
augmented by Wednesday eve
ning candlelight services, month

ly Holy Communion services and
informal discussions.
Leader of church activities is
the Rev. R. M. Minto, University
chaplain. In addition to his "for
mal" duties with the church, lie
is available to all students for
consultation.
Rev. Minto, who has been at
Stanford since 1947, was born in
Glasgow, Scotland, and attended
Glasgow University. He did
graduate work at New York's
Union Theological Seminary and
spent time as a minister in Ma
laya and later as a British Navy
chaplain.
This year he will deliver I he
main address at the convention
of the National Association of
College and University Chap
lains lo be held in April at Uni
versity of Michigan. Rev. Minto
is also a member of I lie Literary

Award jury of the Common
wealth Club of California.
Helping Rev. Minto is Assist
ant Chaplain Thomas S. Derr,
who counsels students and pre
sides over meetings of the Coun
cil of Religious Affairs. This
group is composed of presidents
of various student denomina
tional groups.
Another organization is the
Memorial Church Committee,
composed of student volunteers,
which provides ushers, conducts
the candlelight services and pro
motes discussion.
Betty Camm is church secre
tary. while Eleanor Alton, a
graduate student, organizes dis
cussions and counsels students.
The church, in conjunction
with the Department of Educa
tion, operates a Sunday school
for children. This school, under

the direction of Charles Mere
dith, is staffed entirely by Stan
ford students.
Memorial Church Choir, di
rected by Harold C. Schmidt,
sings the anthems at Sunday
services, accompanied by Uni
versity Organist Herbert B. Nan
ney. Before and after each serv
ice sophomore John F. Mullen
plays the carillon bells in Hoover
Tower.
Until the church was complet
ed, services were held in the
chapel, the building now occu
pied by the Dean of Students
Office. The chapel, the name of
which has given rise to the mis
nomer applied to the church, was
destined to see service again, for
the church was severely dam
aged in the 1906 earthquake.
Fortunately for Mrs. Stanford,
she did not live to see the church

with its demolished tower and
blown-out facade.
The church reopened in 1913,
a decade after its original dedi
cation. Since funds were not im
mediately available for rebuild
ing the tower, a temporary wood
en roof was built over the tower
base. This "temporary" roof is
still there.
The clock and chimes which
had been in the original tower
were placed in a wooden tower
behind the church, another "tem
porary" structure.
Memorial Church for many
years was the scene of Stan
ford's commencement exercises.
It was the church which first
published a student handbook.
And it is in Memorial Church
that many students and alumni
choose to be married.
Although the church is nor

mally open only when the Uni
versity is in session, a special
Christmas program was held
last month.
With floodlights illuminating
the front mosaic, the church
hosted a large group for <a
Christmas Eve service. A 60-
member choir was composed of
teen-age children of the Stanford
faculty. Another service follow
ed on Christmas Day.
Thousands of visitors come an
nually to see the church. It is
worth noting that in reporting
the 1906 earthquake the London
Times referred to the church as
"perhaps the most beautiful of
all buildings in the United
States."
But most important is not the
physical plant of the church;
rather it is the spiritual influ
ence which it exerts on the lead
ers of tomorrow.

MEMORIAL CHURCH ALTAR
Famed Edifice Moves into 54th Year
It was 54 years ago today,
Jan. 25, 1903, that one of the
fondest dreams of Jane Lathrop
Stanford was realized—the open
ing of Stanford Memorial
Church.
Mrs. Stanford had planned
that the church should be the
physical as well as the spiritual
center of the University. On that
Sunday morning more than half
a century ago some 2500 crowd
ed into the magnificent struc
ture, with its 80 - foot Roman
esque tower, for the dedication
service.
Today the church continues to
fulfill the plans of the University
founders. Regular non-denomi
national Sunday services are
augmented by Wednesday eve
ning candlelight services, month

ly Holy Communion services and
informal discussions.
Leader of church activities is
the Rev. R. M. Minto, University
chaplain. In addition to his "for
mal" duties with the church, lie
is available to all students for
consultation.
Rev. Minto, who has been at
Stanford since 1947, was born in
Glasgow, Scotland, and attended
Glasgow University. He did
graduate work at New York's
Union Theological Seminary and
spent time as a minister in Ma
laya and later as a British Navy
chaplain.
This year he will deliver I he
main address at the convention
of the National Association of
College and University Chap
lains lo be held in April at Uni
versity of Michigan. Rev. Minto
is also a member of I lie Literary

Award jury of the Common
wealth Club of California.
Helping Rev. Minto is Assist
ant Chaplain Thomas S. Derr,
who counsels students and pre
sides over meetings of the Coun
cil of Religious Affairs. This
group is composed of presidents
of various student denomina
tional groups.
Another organization is the
Memorial Church Committee,
composed of student volunteers,
which provides ushers, conducts
the candlelight services and pro
motes discussion.
Betty Camm is church secre
tary. while Eleanor Alton, a
graduate student, organizes dis
cussions and counsels students.
The church, in conjunction
with the Department of Educa
tion, operates a Sunday school
for children. This school, under

the direction of Charles Mere
dith, is staffed entirely by Stan
ford students.
Memorial Church Choir, di
rected by Harold C. Schmidt,
sings the anthems at Sunday
services, accompanied by Uni
versity Organist Herbert B. Nan
ney. Before and after each serv
ice sophomore John F. Mullen
plays the carillon bells in Hoover
Tower.
Until the church was complet
ed, services were held in the
chapel, the building now occu
pied by the Dean of Students
Office. The chapel, the name of
which has given rise to the mis
nomer applied to the church, was
destined to see service again, for
the church was severely dam
aged in the 1906 earthquake.
Fortunately for Mrs. Stanford,
she did not live to see the church

with its demolished tower and
blown-out facade.
The church reopened in 1913,
a decade after its original dedi
cation. Since funds were not im
mediately available for rebuild
ing the tower, a temporary wood
en roof was built over the tower
base. This "temporary" roof is
still there.
The clock and chimes which
had been in the original tower
were placed in a wooden tower
behind the church, another "tem
porary" structure.
Memorial Church for many
years was the scene of Stan
ford's commencement exercises.
It was the church which first
published a student handbook.
And it is in Memorial Church
that many students and alumni
choose to be married.
Although the church is nor

mally open only when the Uni
versity is in session, a special
Christmas program was held
last month.
With floodlights illuminating
the front mosaic, the church
hosted a large group for <a
Christmas Eve service. A 60-
member choir was composed of
teen-age children of the Stanford
faculty. Another service follow
ed on Christmas Day.
Thousands of visitors come an
nually to see the church. It is
worth noting that in reporting
the 1906 earthquake the London
Times referred to the church as
"perhaps the most beautiful of
all buildings in the United
States."
But most important is not the
physical plant of the church;
rather it is the spiritual influ
ence which it exerts on the lead
ers of tomorrow.
