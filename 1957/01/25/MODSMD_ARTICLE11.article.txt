## Budget Head Fears Raise By Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UP) —
Budget Director Percival F. Brun
dage indicated today that he was
more afraid of congressional in
creases than reductions in Presi
dent Eisenhower's new record
peacetime budget.
Emerging from a closed meet
ing of the House Appropriations
Committee, Brundage told news
men he had informed the group
that "I hoped they could find ad
ditional ways to cut it fthe budg
et |, but that I especially hoped
they wouldn't increase it."
President's Proposals
The budget chief appeared be
fore the group at his own request
to say he had done all he could
to hold down the President's pro
posals to spend $71.8 billion in the
new fiscal year 1938, which begins
nqxt July 1.
His appearance was seen as an
indication that the Administration
is afraid that Congress—despite
its economy pledges — will add
more items to the new budget
than it cuts out.
In that connection, it was learn
i ed that committee leaders rejected
a Brundage plan for heading off
possible requests by individual
federal agencies for more money
than Eisenhower allotted them in
the budget.
Behind Locked Doors
Under the plan, a Budget Bu
| reau official would have been per
mitted to attend all Appropria
tions subcommittee hearings.
; Stich meetings traditionally are
held behind locked doors and are
I restricted to committee members
and officials of the agency in-
I volved.
