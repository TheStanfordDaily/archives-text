"There is no future for the Mid
dle East in neutrality," said Iran
ian Consul General Ahmad Egh
bal yesterday afternoon in an In
stitute of International Relations
Consul Talk.
Speaking before about 50 per
sons in Bowman Alumni House,
Eghbal recalled, "We learned our
lesson in neutrality the hard way
in World War II."
Now tying Iran to the Western
free world, (lie speaker said, is
membership in the Baghdad Pact.
The pact, composed of Iran, Iraq.
Turkey and Pakistan, is a protec
ti on "against subversion from
within and imposition from with
out," the consul general said.
"The opposition of the Commu
nists to it is the best proof of its
desirability," the speaker added.
Cooperation
He emphasized the importance
of international cooperation such
as the pact provides: "Every local
thing affects the rest of the world
North Korea invades South Korea
and the man in the street in Te
hran has to tighten his belt."
Cooperation of the United States
with the Baghdad Pact is highly
important, according to Eghbal:
"The full participation of the Unit
ed States of America with the
Baghdad Pact would . . . hearten
the doubtful and confirm the be
lieving and would answer the
needs of tomorrow as well as
those of today."
"Stepchild"
He said the United States has
"buttressed" the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the
Southeastern Asiatic Treaty Or
ganization, but has "treated the
Baghdad Pact as a stepchild."
With the Suez Canal crisis, in
ternational cooperation is all the
more important, the consul gen
eral emphasized. He said Iran
ships about three fourths of her
exports and imports through the
[ Canal.
Iran Strategic
While the Suez Canal is stra
tegic, Eghbal said. Iran also plays
a strategic role in Middle Eastern
affairs. "Iran." he declared, "has
repeatedly played a decisive role
In history."
He quoted from a recent speech
by President Eisenhower in which
the President said, "Iran is the
key to the Middle East."
