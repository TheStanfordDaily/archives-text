# $80,000 Phone Exchange System Okayed by Board
## Plan Includes Telephones In Every Dormitory Room One-Number Exchange to Operate All Day Serving Both University and Residences 
### 
An $80,000 telephone exchange system with phones in every dormi
tory room has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
The 24-hour system that will connect the University exchange with
the dormitory telephones under one number will be completed in
two phases.
The first phase includes the construction of a new building to

house the system. It should be
completed by next winter quar
ter. The complete University ex
change system should be in oper
ation by autumn quarter of 1958,
according to University officials.
24-Hour Operation
The new exchange will be oper
ated 24 hours per day. Telephone
company personnel will probably
operate the equipment. Theoreti
cally calls can be placed from any
room of one dormitory to any
room of another dormitory when
completed. This may be subject
to the rules of each living group,
however.
The new PBX system building
will be constructed in the engi
neering area across the street
from the Cellar.
The architectural firm of Spen
cer and Ambrose in San Fran
cisco is working on the prelimi
nary plans for the new building
at the present time. Much of the
automatic equipment is expected
to be placed underground, a
spokesman for the University
Planning Office said.
Phone Per Boom
The long-range plans for the
new system include telephones
for each room in the dormitories.
Florence Moore Hall already has
these telephones installed.
Wings 5 and 6 of Stern Hall
and Wilbur Hall have "phone
jacks" in each room to which
phones may be attached. It is not
known yet when the remaining
dormitories will be equipped.
Besides the University and dor
mitory exchanges, other ex
changes around campus will also
be connected into the new sys
tem These will include the one
at the BAC and some of the pri
vate lines that run into student
and University organization of
fices.
It is not known yet what ar
rangement will be made for the
private lines in the Row houses,
but they may also be placed un
der the new system.
25 Lilies
Seraphim F. Post of the Uni
versity Business Office said that
the new Stanford number will
probably have 25 lines running
into it from off campus. The Uni
versity line itself should then not
be tied up. Most of the calls will
run from one area of the Univer
sity to another and will operate
through the automatic systems
and will not affect the outside
lines.
It has not been announced yet
when coustruction on this build
ing will start.
