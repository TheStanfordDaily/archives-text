# More Idealism Than Necessity
## 
### 
Does Stanford really need that vague, half
hidden quantity known as "student govern
ment"? I)oe9 it fulfill enough of a function
to justify its existence?
True, most students would never know the
difference if it suddenly failed to exist. A few
would care, but not many.
Student government's real function now is
administrative rather than executive or legis
lative. It coordinates rather than leads. Most
of its work centers around appropriating funds
to other student orga» ,: ' 'ions, stamping "yes"
or "no" on ideas aivi j „ t iccts from these stu
dent groups and hassling in an enervating
fashion over the rewording ami organization
of bylaw revisions.
This is a necessary task in the function of
any student government, but it should not he
paramount, as it lias become at Stanford.

Several years ago subjects pertinent to aca
demic life were discussed in a healthy and
thorough manner. The Honor Code was scruti
nized and re-evaluated, the principle and prac
tice of academic freedom were delved into, the
value membership in the [National
Students Association was debated.
The real justification for student government
is now more idealism than necessity. It is no
voice of the students now, but there may be a
time when this voice will be demanded and
used.
For this reason, I lie agency through which
the students may speak and act is kept in
mothballs. It is kept in reserve until either
student leaders act to create issues or these
issues rise spontaneously from the students
I hemselves.
If nothing else, it is a symbol of what has
been and might some day be.
