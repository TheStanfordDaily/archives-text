# House Committee Firmly Backs Ike Mideast Plan
## Senate Demos Attack Dulles Foreign Policy; Fulbright Demands Congressional Examination 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP)—The House Foreign Affair's Corn
mil tee tonight overwhelmingly approved President Eisenhower's
plan to use economic aid—and force if necessary—to block Russian
penetration of the Middle East.
The vote was 24 to 2 with one, member voting present (abstain).

" Five members were absent. The
proposal now goes before the full
House of Representatives which
was expected to add its over
whelming endorsement late next
week.
The House group made five
minor changes in the President's
original resolution. But it voted
him essentially the authority he
sought to keep Russia from real
izing its historic ambition of es
tablishing a Middle East foothold.
While the program seemed like
ly to slide through the House
without difficulty, trouble was
building up in the Senate.
Angry Attack
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles went before the combined
Senate Foreign Relations-Armed
Services Committee for a third
day today and promptly bumped
into an angry Democratic attack
on his foreign policies.
Senator J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.), who led the attack,
charged that the Secretary's poli
cies have been "harmful to our
interests." He demanded a full
scale Congressional review of
Dulles' policies before acting on
the Mifleast resolution.
Former President Truman also
stepped into the controversy by
urging Congress to overhaul the
President's proposal to fill what
he termed a "void" left by the
administration. But he said the
lawmakers had "no choice except
to take some action."
Eisenhower Plan
Eisenhower requested author
ity to send U.S. military forces, if
necessary, to resist any Commu
nist aggression in the Middle
East. He also asked for $600 mil
lion in economic aid for the area
over the next 2Vi years, including
$200 million already appropri
ated.
Committee Chairman Thomas
S. Gordon (D-III.), describing the
measure as a "good hill." said he
would have the committee resolu
tion ready for the House next
week. Speaker Sam Hay burn ear
lier forecast overwhelming ap-
I proval by Friday.
Dulles sat stonily as Fulbright
I leveled his attack on administra
j lion foreign policy in the Senate
hearing.
