## Gradual End to Social Regulations 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In my letter printed yesterday, I expressed
violent disapproval of the social regulations here
at Stanford. I now wish to continue and expand
the previous discussion.
One of the mo&t unfortunate and disturbing
aspects of the entffe problem is that the women
perhaps I should say girls, under the circum
stancesâ€”seem to be afraid to accept responsibil
ity, and, under the guise of so-called propriety,
are content to maintain the system of rules under
Which they live.
It is almost frightening to be presented with
the fact that they, most of whom are legally old
enough to get married, do not consider them
selves mature erjough as a body to live without
supervision and to come in when they think it
is proper to do so.
The schools in Europe, which are not "dens
of iniquity," although they are sometimes repre
sented to be by Americans, have none of the
type of restrictions on hours, etc., that is in
force here. Yet almost all the Americans who
transfer there seem to thrive and mature as they

are finally given the choice of running their own
Jives.
I have talked to many students who have gone
1o European schools and universities, and they
have without exception stated variations on the
above theme. And many Europeans have com
mented on the childish restrictions in force here.
As one put it, "if you get into a university,
you are presumed to be an adult." Stanford says
so as well, but it does not seem to Jive up to its
statement.
This University has a responsibility to pre
pare its students for Iheir future existence, and
to properly educate them in the world's tradi
tions. If they are not already, it has a responsi
bility to make them adults. And the only way
it can do so is to give them ihcir heads and let
them learn.
It may lake time, and some unfortunate chil
dren may not remain with us. They should never
have been allowed to come. The AWS social
regulations should be gradually thrown out, and
the girls here, who are called adults, should be
allowed to assume the responsibility which goes
with the title.
