# THE NATIONAL SCENE
## Nixon—Opportunist or Wrongly Accused? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
Richard M. Nixon could be the central figure
of the success story of the century. It all depends
on what happens in 1900.
But who is this man? What are his real po
litical beliefs?
Nixon is the Vice-President of the United
States. In 1950 he was elected Senator for the
first time. In 1948 be was a Congressman.
Strangely enough, he has held the position of
Vice-President longer than anything else. What
has caused this meteoric rise in the career of a
young man who was almost unknown as little as
10 years ago?
Unknown ipiantity
This is a question many people are asking.
Americans proudly hold up examples of famous
people who have achieved great success. Their
stories have been written and told hundreds of
times. They have been set up as patterns to
follow.
But in each and every case their success has
been attributed to something their own per
sonal drive, usually. In Nixon's case . . . ?
Who really knows about Nixon? He's been
attacked strongly try political opponents, lie's
been charged with using political tactics that
were of the vilest types: But of ail the charges
that have been made against him, the charge
that he is one of the most cunning of political
opportunists seems to be the most acurate one.
No Fear Among Old Guard
The "new" Republican regime points to Nixon
as the shining example of a believer- in Eisen
hower's "New Republicanism" policies. Here,
they say, is the epitome of Republican liberalism.
Here, they claim, is the man who will continue
what Eisenhower has begun.
Bui regardless of how much Nixon is pro
claimed the liberal, there seem to be no fears
developing among the Republican Old Guard, the
strong conservative wing. Why?
Could it be that lire Old Guard feels that this
liberal will never control the destinies of the
GOP? Hardly. Everything points toward Nix
on's control of the inside track for the i960 rromi
nation.
Senator Knowland is regarded as a strong
conservative. Few would disagree with lhat.
Now this is the strange part. A comparison of
the voting records of Knowland and Nixon irr
the Senate between 1950 and 1953 reveals the
little-known fact that Nixon voted much more
conservatively than Knowland. His voting record
made Knowland appear to be a liberal.
Wolf' Turned Sheep
But perhaps he has changed, as some of his
strong supporters insist. Why certainly he's
changed. A wolf with sheep's clothing is changed
too. But if a person can change from a conserva
tive to a liberal as rapidly as Nixon is supposed
to have done, lie could change into a communist
or an isolationist just as easily and just as rap
idly.
Actually people's outlook on political and eco
nomic issues does not change suddenly. It's a
slow transition that involves other changes too—
especially in the personality. That is, unless it's
a• rude awakening.
But whatever' Nixon is, or whatever Nixon
believes, only history will tell Nixon himseli cer
tainly will not.

Now that the Democrats have retired to their
places on-the-outside-looking-in for another four
years, there may he expected a new onslaught
of critical disapproval of the grinding gears ol
government run hy the newly inaugurated vie '
tors.
Already the first armchair comments have
hern made by Messrs. Stevenson and Truman as
concerns an Administration policy and an Eisen !
hower address.
And it's just the start of a '■Pi* year-long fight
hy the outsiders to gain the prized possession
that went to the enemy camp last November.
No holds are barred in this continual struggle,
and so it is inevitable there will again be heard ,
the gutter gurgles against personalities, particu
larly the ones who will figure in the 1960 race.
Heading the smear list of nearly every Demo
crat-Liberal is the name of .Richard M. Nixon,
certainly a contender for the 19(50 Republican
nomination, but more immediately a man near
the helm ol the Ship of Slate.
A Credit in November
Emerging from the November elections,
Nixon appeared more than ever as a capable po
litical campaigner, vote-getter and leader. Even
cartoonist Herbert L. Block was giving Nixon
less and less of a live o'clock shadow. Critics
were forced to return to their lairs and rehash
time weary charges against Nixon of a vintage
100 old to turn away any votes from the GOP
ticket. There was little material for new vindic
t ivc.s.
The new stature acquired by Nixon as a result
of the 19f>() campaign has given him a boost
where it does the most good- among the Repub
lican inner circles. But it is doubtful that it af
fected his most desperate critics very much.
Discrediting (Conspiracy
They still consider him as a man who smeared
his way into the public eye and who has always
had crafty designs to advance his own fortunes
at the expense of anyone.
fortunately, this is a fading conception. Tt
has its source in the bitter- juice of political sour
grapes. II is supported only by the wishful
imagination and distorted information of minds
susceptible to an evilly-calculated conspiracy to
discredit Nixon.
These minds will never acknowledge Ihe real
Richard Nixon because they have been nurtured
to believe in an illusory Richard Nixon, They
have accepted without question the rigged allega
tions that Nixon conducted dishonorable cam
paigns for Congress and Senate, and that, he
slugged Democrats below the belt in I9. r )2 and
1954.
Impeccable Record
r Io these minds, the truth will never be ac
cepted. They will never change what they want
to believe.
But as a result of his impeccable record of
four year's service to America in the Vice Presi
dency combined with his remarkably successful
J950 campaign appearances, the American people
can be more certain than ever* that Nixon is not
the man his critics would have him be.
