LONDON, Jan. 24 (UP)â€”Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan an
nounced today he has ordered a
sweeping reorganization of Brit
ish armed forces aimed at "sub
stantial reduction" of defense
spending and manpower.
The new Prime Minister dis
closed the cutback program to
Parliament, on the eve of a trip
to Washington by his Defense
Minister, Duncan Sandys.
Macmillan, announcing his first
policy shift, said Sandys would be
given the widest powers of any
defense minister since Sir Win
ston Churchill held the post along
with the premiership in World
War 11. Sandys is Churchill's son
in-law.
The Prime Minister said Sandys'
first task will he to formulate, "in
the light of present strategic
needs, a defense policy which will
secure a substantial reduction in
expenditure and manpower."
The move reflected British real
ization that the nation's economy
can no longer afford the present
defense program. The Suez in
vasion demonstrated that Brit
ain's widely-spread "fire brigade"
army was not as effective as
hoped.
British armed forces now total
780,000 men and women, including

276,500 draftees. Defense appro
priations for the current year to
taled $4,317 million.
About SI 12 million already has
been cut from this figure. British
newspapers predicted Maomillan
might trim as much as $1,120 mil
lion from defense spending next
year.
Sandys is leaving for Washing
ton tomorrow for talks with U.S.
defense officials on a new basis
for sharing Western defense strat
egy.
