# Looking It Over With Jerry Kelly

Sign a check for two million dollars ($2,000,000) loday and the
Stanford athletic department promises that construction of a new
basketball pavilion will start tomorrow.
Sounds simple, doesn't it? That seems to be the only way, though,
thai the proposed ultra-modern pavilion will ever become a reality.
One athletic department official suggested ihat any such money left
in a will would also be gratefully accepted.
Cniil then however, only 2,70'j spectators.at a time will be able
to witness Pacific Co.-. t Conference hoop action on the Stanford
campus, l or the many, many students who will lie deprived of seeing
the Indians np et Cal tonight, there is little consolation.
I'ercliaJice, your children may watch "their" teams perform
in tli)- new pavilion—an architect's extravaganza which will com
fortably house H,OOO.
Several apt signs on campus advising to "Thimk Ahead" or
"Thinh Big" may lie applicable here. Will 8,000 seats suffice in 1970?
Plan:- for Ihe new pavilion have lieen completed and the ink has
long ago dried. A model scale can l>e seen at the BAC. One some
limes wonders which will cost more the diamond shaped building
with the Alps-slope root or the landscaping plans which cover twice
ihe area of the Pavilion. •
Stanford boasts the second largest privately-owned fool ball
Indium in the country. Upwards to 90,000 could jam into Ihe grid
garden, bill rarely do. All athletics lund surplus is needed for upkeep
and repairs on the stadium.
The Harlem Globetrotters played before 75,000, a world's record,
during the late 40's in West Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Perhaps it
ran be assumed from this: the more seating capacity, the bigger
the crowd.
.lust as in all other sports, (he!'('(! is rated high in the
basketball field. Two good representatives, Oregon State College
and the University of Washington, have met Stanford in the
lo'-al "erackerbox" this year an.l Ili«' games have been real crowd
pleasers. These same two sehools return to their home courts
and play before 10,000 against any TCC foe.
Is thi not one reason several Southern schools have given for
refusing to play football in the Northwest? Lack of big gale receipts?
The nt -.1 is gre.it and time's a wasting. With an 8,000 capacity
pavilion, Ihe Indian cagers would be playing before 8,000 tonight,
next week and next year.
Willi but 2700 seats now, Ihe athletic officials have not been
greedy al the gate and have given'the Stanford student first crack
al picking up basketball tickets. But even Ibis plan has failed to help
a goodly number of hoop fans. Tonight, just as the last two week
ends, there will be many disappointed turn-aways.

While on the subject/if basketball and the I'CC, refereeing
procedures at the Oregon State and Washington series should
not be passed without a word. It's getting so had, the spectators,
definitely partial to Stanford, are booing even when the whistle
blows against the opposition.
Against Washington last weekend, Stanford forward Lee
Leonard had four Huskies on his back, his back was parallel to the
floor and he wasn't falling. No whistle. This followed a wrestling
match staged at mid-court. No whistle.
The referee, suddenly realizing his error, blew the whistle and
called a foul the next time a Husky looked cross-eyed at an Indian.
So Ihe refs really aren't partial, just slow trying to be fair. If a
player gets (tailed, he's bound It) gel lhat free throw sooner or later.

called a foul the next time a Husky looked cross-eyed at an Indian.
So Ihe refs really aren't partial, just slow trying to be fair. If a
