# Indians Out to Chop Cal's PCC Lead
## Experts Pick Cal; Santa Clara Plays Cards Tomorrow 
### Dave Canfield 
Al 8:30 tonight in the.Pavilion,
Cal's and Stanford's basketball
teams will lip ofl' a "Big Game"
I hat has the underdog Indians
hopeful and the favored Bears
worried.
A ('al loss and a Washington
win tonight would knoek the
Bears oui of the league lead.
Santa Clara will invade the
Farm al 8:30 p.m. tomorrow.
Ticket's for this till are still avail
able, free to students, al Ihe BAC.
Height, experience, comparative
scores, win loss records every
thing the "experts" have It) go on
will be favoring a ('al win to
night.
The Berkeley rebounding corns
<)•() center Duane Asplund and 0-7
forward Don Mcintosh and (5-4 for
ward Tarry Friend will out aver
age Stanford's forward wall by
three inches, sizable even in mod
ern beanpole basketball.
Experience favors Coach Pete
Nevvell's crew as well, with three
seniors Friend, Asplund and
Gabe Arrillaga and two juniors
Earl Robinson and Mcintosh
forming an all-letterman five.
Comparative scores center
around games with San Jose
State. The Indians lost to the
Spartans by four points; the Bears
won by 22.
Records Favor Cal
Won-lost records give the Cal
quintel 11-2 season-wise, and 5-0
Pacific Coast Conference - wise,
while Stanford stands 0-8 and 2-3,
respectively. One Card setback
came at Berkeley, Jan. 8, when
the Bears won, 59-45.
The boys from across Ihe Bay
have shellacked Arizona State, si.
Mary's (in a first-place California
Basketball Association tie with
Santa Clara), Arizona, COP, San
Jose Slate, Washington State and
Oregon all by fairly safe mar
gins.
Only losses were to Kansas and
I'JSF, and some fool the improving
Berkeleyites won't, lose another
game this season.
A few more Bear statistics: Cal
has the third best defensive unit
in the country, having held oppo
Merits to . r >2.'l points a game. Of
fensively, I hey have enjoyed com
fortable winning margins by av
eraging 05.4 points a game.
To go a long way toward filling
out this average, Friend, playing
his third year of first-string Cal
basketball, is spinning I hem in to
the lune of 18.8 markers a tilt. In
PCC action ihe Bear- captain ranks
fourth with a 19-flat average.
Robinson has 11.2, Asplund 10.1,
Mcintosh 7.5 and fully seven oth
er players be'tween iwo and four
points a game.
Free-Throw Experts
Robinson, the smooth guard
from Berkeley, and Asplund both
shoot free throws as if they had
the basket magnetized. Robinson
has swished through a cool 87
per cent from the foul line to rank
second in the league. Asplund at
85.7 per cent is fourth.
First in the conference is Stan
ford's Carl Isaacs, who has had,
however, only 17 free-throw at
tempts.
Despite the height, advantage,
the superior experience, ihe com
parative scores, the win-loss rec
ords and other statistics, Cal
Coach Newell is still worried. Say

ing his quintet will have anything
but an time with the Indians,
the youthful Bear mentor predict
ed "a Warner Brothers finish a
real cliff-hanger."
Rough Play?
And Rene Herrerias, who scoul
ed the Washington-Stanford dou
ble-header for Newell, is no more
optimistic. In his scouting report,
Herrerias fretted not only about
the Cards' phenomenal improve
ment since Ihe Jan. 8 defeat and
about the addition of Isaacs, but
also about the great disadvantage
of playing Stanford in Ihe Pa
vilion.
Coach Howie Dallmar's men,
Herrerias alleged, "got away with
rough play" in their home game
last week end.

Comparative scores center
around games with San Jose

Won-lost records give the Cal

came at Berkeley, Jan. 8, when

Only losses were to Kansas and

Free-Throw Experts
Robinson, the smooth guard
from Berkeley, and Asplund both
shoot free throws as if they had
the basket magnetized. Robinson
has swished through a cool 87
per cent from the foul line to rank
second in the league. Asplund at
85.7 per cent is fourth.
First in the conference is Stan

however, only 17 free-throw at

respectively. One Card setback
came at Berkeley, Jan. 8, when
the Bears won, 59-45.
The boys from across Ihe Bay
have shellacked Arizona State, si.
Mary's (in a first-place California
Basketball Association tie with
Santa Clara), Arizona, COP, San
Jose Slate, Washington State and
Oregon all by fairly safe mar
gins.
Only losses were to Kansas and
I'JSF, and some fool the improving
Berkeleyites won't, lose another
game this season.
A few more Bear statistics: Cal
has the third best defensive unit
in the country, having held oppo
Merits to . r >2.'l points a game. Of
fensively, I hey have enjoyed com
fortable winning margins by av
eraging 05.4 points a game.
To go a long way toward filling
out this average, Friend, playing
his third year of first-string Cal
basketball, is spinning I hem in to
the lune of 18.8 markers a tilt. In
PCC action ihe Bear- captain ranks
fourth with a 19-flat average.
Robinson has 11.2, Asplund 10.1,
Mcintosh 7.5 and fully seven oth
er players be'tween iwo and four
points a game.
Free-Throw Experts
Robinson, the smooth guard
from Berkeley, and Asplund both
shoot free throws as if they had
the basket magnetized. Robinson
has swished through a cool 87
per cent from the foul line to rank
second in the league. Asplund at
85.7 per cent is fourth.
First in the conference is Stan
ford's Carl Isaacs, who has had,
however, only 17 free-throw at
tempts.
Despite the height, advantage,
the superior experience, ihe com
parative scores, the win-loss rec
ords and other statistics, Cal
Coach Newell is still worried. Say

ing his quintet will have anything
but an time with the Indians,
the youthful Bear mentor predict
ed "a Warner Brothers finish a
real cliff-hanger."
Rough Play?
And Rene Herrerias, who scoul
ed the Washington-Stanford dou
ble-header for Newell, is no more
optimistic. In his scouting report,
Herrerias fretted not only about
the Cards' phenomenal improve
ment since Ihe Jan. 8 defeat and
about the addition of Isaacs, but
also about the great disadvantage
of playing Stanford in Ihe Pa
vilion.
Coach Howie Dallmar's men,
Herrerias alleged, "got away with
rough play" in their home game
last week end.
