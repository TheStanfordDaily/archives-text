# AEC to Renew Nevada Atomic Tests in Spring
## 'Low Yield' Shots Will Involve New Nuclear Anti-Aircraft Missiles 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP> —
The Atomic Energy Commission
announced today that a series of
"low-yield" atomic tests will be
held in Nevada late this spring,
presumably involving nuclear an
tiaircraft missiles.
The commission said a major
objective of the tests, sixth to be
held at Frenchman's Flat proving
ground, will be the "development
of weapons for defense against
attack." The tests will be known
as "Operation Plumhbob."
Apparently mindful of some
fears about radiation effects, the
commission also announced that
"an extensive radiation monitor
ing network will again be used
during the series." It also noted
that "high-yield" weapons never
are tested in Nevada.
45 "Shots"
Since 1951 the United States has
fired 43 atomic "shots" in Nevada.
In all, this country has staged at
least 75 atomic explosions includ
ing those during World War II
and the Pacific H-bomb blasts of
1952, 1954 and 1956.
The United States has announc
ed 17 Soviet atom-hydrogen tests.
It has been estimated, however,
that Russia actually may have
fired some 40 shots. Britain has
staged nine atomic explosions and
will test its first H-bomb al Christ
mas Island, south of Hawaii, be
tween March I and Aug. 1.
Weapons Effects
The AEC said the Defense Do
partment and the Civil Defense
Administration will participate in
the new U.S. tests. It said studies
of "weapons effects" will be con
ducted to improve U.S. defenses
against atomic attack.
"The program of tests is aimed
to attain new knowledge impor
tant to the defense of the United
States and the free world, which
must be maintained pending nlti
mate attainment of international
agreement on safeguarded disarm
amcnt," the commission said.
The AEC also announced that
during the year it will conduct
separate Nevada tests related to
the safety of various weapons and
experimental devices "in the event
of accidents such as fires during
handling or storage" of nuclear
materials.
These tests, started Nov. I, 1955,
are aimed, among other things, at
making sure that atomic materi
als do not catch fire and are stored
safely.

mate attainment of international
agreement on safeguarded disarm
amcnt," the commission said.
The AEC also announced that
during the year it will conduct
separate Nevada tests related to
the safety of various weapons and
experimental devices "in the event
of accidents such as fires during
handling or storage" of nuclear
materials.
These tests, started Nov. I, 1955,
are aimed, among other things, at
making sure that atomic materi
als do not catch fire and are stored
safely.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP> —
The Atomic Energy Commission
announced today that a series of
"low-yield" atomic tests will be
held in Nevada late this spring,
presumably involving nuclear an
tiaircraft missiles.
The commission said a major
objective of the tests, sixth to be
held at Frenchman's Flat proving
ground, will be the "development
of weapons for defense against
attack." The tests will be known
as "Operation Plumhbob."
Apparently mindful of some
fears about radiation effects, the
commission also announced that
"an extensive radiation monitor
ing network will again be used
during the series." It also noted
that "high-yield" weapons never
are tested in Nevada.
45 "Shots"
Since 1951 the United States has
fired 43 atomic "shots" in Nevada.
In all, this country has staged at
least 75 atomic explosions includ
ing those during World War II
and the Pacific H-bomb blasts of
1952, 1954 and 1956.
The United States has announc
ed 17 Soviet atom-hydrogen tests.
It has been estimated, however,
that Russia actually may have
fired some 40 shots. Britain has
staged nine atomic explosions and
will test its first H-bomb al Christ
mas Island, south of Hawaii, be
tween March I and Aug. 1.
Weapons Effects
The AEC said the Defense Do
partment and the Civil Defense
Administration will participate in
the new U.S. tests. It said studies
of "weapons effects" will be con
ducted to improve U.S. defenses
against atomic attack.
"The program of tests is aimed
to attain new knowledge impor
tant to the defense of the United
States and the free world, which
must be maintained pending nlti
mate attainment of international
agreement on safeguarded disarm
amcnt," the commission said.
