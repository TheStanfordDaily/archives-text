# Emissary Says While Prestige Now Waning
## 
### 
"While prestige is diminishing
in Africa," said Dr. Douglas V.
Steere at the Women's Clubhouse
last night. Steere, a special emis
sary of the American Friends
Service Committee to Europe and
Africa, told the audience of sev
eral trends apparent in that once
dark continent.
"Parts of Africa are very dif
ferent from each other," he said,
"and it is difficult to make gener
alizations."
Prestige Down
First, the white prestige has
vastly diminished in the last 25
years. The wars especially have
done much to tear it down. The
Africans see Hie whites slaugh
tering themselves, and wonder if
that is the kind of life Ihe whites
have in store for them.
Secondly, the prestige Hi |
minished ;»s the white empires j
have broken up. "The Africans
begin to think of when it will be j
their day to break away," he said. '
Thirdly, the African way of life i
has been developing by itself, j
The average African has a pool j
diet and little education, but tie
sees I hat he may have a chance
to g'H these things, and wants
them.
Lducation Level
In the progressive count Hps, at \
most there are about .'«• to 10
per cent of the Africans attendinp !
school, Imi this figure usually ;
drops after Ihe fourth or fifth
grade level.
The missions have had a pro
found effect on the Africans.
They have been very instrumen
tal in bringing medicine, educa
tion and culture.
"Sometimes il seems lo the Al
riean that if he could pet rid of
the white man mII his troubles
would be over," Steere said. "That
notion is false."
In Liberia, which has had self
government for 2.") years, a black
elite merely has replaced ;i white
elite. The governing group still
looks al the rest of the people as
aborigines. The elite must be mo *
tivated by high principles.

have broken up. "The Africans
begin to think of when it will be j
their day to break away," he said. '
Thirdly, the African way of life i
has been developing by itself, j
The average African has a pool j
diet and little education, but tie
sees I hat he may have a chance
to g'H these things, and wants
them.
Lducation Level
In the progressive count Hps, at \
most there are about .'«• to 10
per cent of the Africans attendinp !
school, Imi this figure usually ;
drops after Ihe fourth or fifth
grade level.
The missions have had a pro
found effect on the Africans.
They have been very instrumen
tal in bringing medicine, educa
tion and culture.
"Sometimes il seems lo the Al
riean that if he could pet rid of
the white man mII his troubles
would be over," Steere said. "That
notion is false."
In Liberia, which has had self
government for 2.") years, a black
elite merely has replaced ;i white
elite. The governing group still
looks al the rest of the people as
aborigines. The elite must be mo *
tivated by high principles.
