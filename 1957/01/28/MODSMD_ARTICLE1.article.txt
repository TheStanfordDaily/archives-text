WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP)
Senator .1, William Fulbright (D-
Ark.) conceded today that he
probably will lose his fight to da
lay action on President Eisenhow
er's Mideast resolution until Con
gress can conduct a full-scale re
view of administration foreign
policy.
Hut he predicted that he will be
successful in forcing such an in
c|iiiry later.
The combined Foreign Rela
tions-Armed Services Committee
will meet behind closed doors to
morrow to act on the Fulbright
proposal. II will also take secret
testimony from Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles.
Attacks on Dulles continued to
day <is senators of both parties
debated the issue on Sunday TV
panel shows. Freshman Senator
Joseph Clark (D-Pa.) said he
would vole for the resolution but
called for Dulles' resignation.
Knowland < 'ommcnts
Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland (Calif.) told re
porters earlier that he believes
some of the Secretary's Demo
cratic critics are trying to force
him to quit.
Senator Henry M. Jackson (D-
Wash.) said he would back Ful
hright's demand for a review of
foreign policy but not to put it
ahead of the resolution.
lie also said that Dulles is
"jeopardizing other economic aid
programs" by refusing to tell
Congress how the funds author
ized in the resolution would be
spent.
Policies Harmful
Fulbright, second-ranking Dem
ocrat on Ihe foreign relations
group, told an obviously angry
Dulles last week that he felt the
Secretary's policies had been
harmful.
He therf called for a review of
those policies before the Senate
acts on the President's request to
use money and troops, if neces
sary, to stop Communist penetra
lion of the Middle East.
* Fulbright, who appeared on the
CHS-TV program, "Face the Na
tion," was asked how he thought
I lie vote would go tomorrow. He
replied that he believed the joint
committee would vote for the re
view. but after the resolution has
been disposed of.
To Oppose Resolution
lie said many senators are re
luctant lo delay Ihc vote on the
resolution. But he said he per
sonally would oppose it unless
the review came first.
Fulbright also was asked about
K(lowland's suggestion I hat some
Democrats are trying to force the
Secretary's resignation.
The senator replied that lhis
conclusion was "premature." He
said it may be that Dulles has
some "good explanation" for
what he called the "apparent
failure'' of U.S. foreign policy.
Clark said, however, Iha I he
I bought lh" resignation would be
a step toward clearing up U.S.
policy in the Middle East.
