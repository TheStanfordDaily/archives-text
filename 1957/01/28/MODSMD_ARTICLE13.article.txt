# Stanford Receives Additional Money
##

J
The Slate District Court of Ap
peals reversed a Santa Clara
County court decision Friday and
awarded $150,000 to Stanford's
Hoard of Trustors.
The money had been held in a
trust fund set up in 190.1 on the
death of Mrs. Leland Stanford.
Mrs. Stanford's niece, Amy L.
Hansen, was beneficiary of the
fund. After her death in 1954 her
three adopted children filed
claims to the trust fund.
The county court ruling gave
the trust fond to the three chil
dren, but Friday's appellate rul
ing tin ned them down on grounds
of their adopted status.
