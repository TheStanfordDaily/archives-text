I'uited Nations sanctions against Israel and prepared blistering argu
ments for tomorrow's two funeral Assembly sessions on the Middle

East.
Basis of the Arab angei was Is

mile belt of the Sinai Desert
dominating the Gulf of Aqaba lo
the south.

Strip to come under Egyptian
control again as a base for mili
tary operations.

tion of the conquered Gaza Strip
in defiance of the UN stand and
;i special committee was formed
to supervise development proj
ects in the wasteland.

uled to address the Assembly to

ceed until Israeli forces evacuate
all territory seized in the invasion

expected to address Hie Assem
bly lo present the Israeli point of
view that Israel intends to pre
vent the Gaza and Aqaba areas

threat they were before the inva

oners. All said they had been tor
tured or mistreated.
