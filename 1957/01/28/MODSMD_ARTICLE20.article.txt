# Official Calls Ike's Mideast Plan Unsound
## Information Employee Says Power Request Could Bring Next War 
### 
TOKYO, Jan. 27 (UP) A U.S.
information officer charged today
that President Eisenhower's re
quest for special powers to de
fend the Middle East is a "blank
check for one man rule" that
could lead 1o atomic war.
Charles Edmunson, who is as
signed to the Seoul branch of the
U.S. Information Service, de
nounced U.S. policy in a "strictly
personal statement" handed out
to newsmen during a stopover
here.
Edmunson charged that U.S.
aid is lining thp pockets of "prol'i
teers, grafters and politicians"
around the world. He denounced
"reckless so-called investigations"
of State Department activities.
He challenged government inter
ference with the "sacred and in
violable right" of U.S. newsmen
to travel where they please.
Prepared to Resign
He prefaced his statement with
a message to USIS headquarters
in Washington, advising his chief
that he is prepared to resign if
they do not like his views.
There was no immediate indica
tion that the USIS had taken him
up on the offer.
Edmunson reserved his strong
est criticism for the President's
request for special powers to
back up the "Eisenhower Doc
trine" for the defense of the Mid
east against. Communist aggres
sion.
Into Atomic War
"I cannot conscientiously sup
port a foreign policy which I be
lieve may lead us beyond the
brink and into atomic war," he
said.
"President Eisenhower's call
for a blank check to make war if
he sees fit in the Middle East,
constitutes a demand for Con
gress to abdicate to the White
House the duties and preroga
tives vested in it by the constitu
tion. In American history, yiere
is no peacetime parallel for such
an opening to one-man rule. . . .
"If America is ready to take
such a chance of war as the pro
posed unilateral action in the
Middle East involves, we should
have taken it in Hungary, The
moral imperative would' then
have been clear."
Korea Aid Wasted
As regards aid. he charged spe
fically that much of the money
America is pumping into South
Korea is "wasted" because of a
lack of "economic and adminis
trative help at the top."
"Due chiefly to policies and pro
cedurcs laid down in Washington,
much of the hundreds of millions
which we spend in underdevel
oped countries is wasted by being
channeled through speculators,
grafters and politicians while es
sential agriculture and industry
suffer, . . . "Edmunson said.
