# Let the Women Speak Out
## 
### 
Despite the well-known liberality of Stan
ford's social regulations, they must he subjected
frequently to evaluation and analysis lest they
impose unneeded restrictions on the women
students and encourage violation by their very
arbitrariness.
This philosophy is one of basic trust in the
Stanford woman —that she, knowing herself
better than anyone else. Knows what rules and
regulations best applv 1 her community.
True, the regulati they now stand do
riot treat the women students as adults in any
absolute sense of the word, but it is not the
University administration, as it is in many col
leges, who have dictated policy. It is the stu
dents themselves.
The ideal would he a situation where no
social regulations were necessary, where every
woman student fully accepted the trust placed
upon her by the Fundamental Standard to obey
the spirit of the social and moral order neces
sary to university life.
Evaluation of social regulations should be
viewed continually in this light. If Ihe women
students have enough faith in their own sense
of honor and obligation, they should experi
ment liberally with their own regulations, at
tempting to make honor rather than the (!<•-

merit system the primary consideration.
There are many phases that need liberalizing.
\\ hy, for instance, should freshman women he
allowed only five 2:30 late leaves their first
quarter and six during their second and third,
when freshman men have no restrictions what
soever?
It is difficult to argue that women are less
able to adjust to university life and must he
prevented from squandering their lime hy the
imposition of a severe late-leave system.
Why should the number of late leaves for
sophomores, juniors and seniors he restricted
at all? Tlif •se students have, for the most part,
become aware of their responsibilities as adults
in a university, and there is little justification
that they will change their habits of study and
academic emphasis simply because they have
unlimited late leaves.
These rather silly restrictions, and many
others, exist now and will continue to exist
unless the women themselves demand I hey he
changed.
Many complain to themselves and In small
groups of friends, hut unless lliev speak out
through their residence officers and Associated
Women Students, their silence as a group will
he interpreted as agreement.
