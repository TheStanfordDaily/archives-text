# An Open Door for Tito
## 
### 
From rotii sides of thf. aisi.i. in Congress,
from liberals and conservatives alike, the pro
posed visit of Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito lias
been given the verbal whiplasli.
I ito's government is far from ideal. His rule
has been as tyrannical as that of the Soviet
Union, his dictatorship as debasing to indi
vidual liberties as that of fascist countries.
Although far from being a model democrat,
he is a strong personal force behind the great
spirit of independence—and liberty that has
sprung up in Iron Curtain countries, and for
this all democratic countries owe him at least
a measure of gratitude.
Democracy on the Western pattern. ma> not
be his intent, but he has contributed to its
eventual establishment by the very fact that
he had the courage to cut loose from the Krem
lin's grip and thus set a pattern for all other
courageoxis satellites to follow.
It would be diplomatic hypocrisy for the
I nited States to blind herself to Tito's faults
and treat him as a sincere democratic convert,
but it would be equal folly to become overly
choosy about friends and supporters.
Actually, Tito's merits and demerits are not
the primary consideration. He is a powerful
leader of a potentially powerful people- and

on this score alone should rest the justification
for his visit.
I he I nited Slates is not condoning Commu
nism, totalitarianism or Titoism bv inviting
him. It is merely encouraging the friendly
exchange of world leaders, whomever tliey
might be, in the hope that such reciprocal
visits will bring about the genuine undcrstand
ing necessary to world peace.
It is not expected that one visit will turn
I ito into a devoted democrat. Prime Minister
Nehru's recent visit to this country did not
change his socialist and neutralist outlook, hut
it did give him a deeper appreciation of this
country's motivations and foreign policy aspi
rations. by couldn t this also happen to Tito?
And what harm could a simple visit do?
I ito would hardly hiing along spies and sabo
teurs, and it is doubtful that free exchange of
international leaders would hurt the feelings
ol our allies who have been complaining all
along that the United States is taking too rigid
an approach toward recognition of foreign gov
ernments.
It would be wise for the United States to take
some of the starch out of her diplomatic collar
and develop new channels of communication
and understanding with the nations with which
she is attempting to live.

he had the courage to cut loose from the Krem

courageoxis satellites to follow.
It would be diplomatic hypocrisy for the
I nited States to blind herself to Tito's faults
and treat him as a sincere democratic convert,
but it would be equal folly to become overly
choosy about friends and supporters.
Actually, Tito's merits and demerits are not
the primary consideration. He is a powerful
leader of a potentially powerful people- and

on this score alone should rest the justification
for his visit.
I he I nited Slates is not condoning Commu
nism, totalitarianism or Titoism bv inviting
him. It is merely encouraging the friendly
exchange of world leaders, whomever tliey
might be, in the hope that such reciprocal
visits will bring about the genuine undcrstand
ing necessary to world peace.
It is not expected that one visit will turn
I ito into a devoted democrat. Prime Minister
Nehru's recent visit to this country did not
change his socialist and neutralist outlook, hut
it did give him a deeper appreciation of this
country's motivations and foreign policy aspi
rations. by couldn t this also happen to Tito?
And what harm could a simple visit do?
I ito would hardly hiing along spies and sabo
teurs, and it is doubtful that free exchange of
international leaders would hurt the feelings
ol our allies who have been complaining all
along that the United States is taking too rigid
an approach toward recognition of foreign gov
ernments.
It would be wise for the United States to take
some of the starch out of her diplomatic collar
and develop new channels of communication
and understanding with the nations with which
she is attempting to live.
From rotii sides of thf. aisi.i. in Congress,
from liberals and conservatives alike, the pro
posed visit of Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito lias
been given the verbal whiplasli.
I ito's government is far from ideal. His rule
has been as tyrannical as that of the Soviet
Union, his dictatorship as debasing to indi
vidual liberties as that of fascist countries.
Although far from being a model democrat,
he is a strong personal force behind the great
spirit of independence—and liberty that has
sprung up in Iron Curtain countries, and for
this all democratic countries owe him at least
a measure of gratitude.
Democracy on the Western pattern. ma> not
