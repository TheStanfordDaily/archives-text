# Bear, Santa Clara Fives Win Weekend Cage Tilts
## Indian Uprising Fails in Cal Overtime Thriller; Bond Leads Scorers in Both Games With 22, 19 
### Dave Canfield 
It was the T>6 football Big Game
all over again Friday night as
once again a determined Stanford
team came Iron) behind only to
see a fighting rally fail. Cal won,
67-61.
Saturday night, on the same Pa
vilion floor, the Indians seemed all
"basketballed" out as a red-hot
Santa Clara five won, 77-61.
Coach Howie Dallmar took some
of the sting out of the California
heart breaker by labeling the
Bears as "a lot stronger club than
either Oregon Stale or Washing
ton."
The Dallmarmen were down
throughout the game, often by as
much as 12 points, and didn't
cal eh the Bears until 1 1 - minutes
remained, when scrambling guard
Paul Neumann, cool forward Dick
Haga and aggressive center Carl
Isaacs combined for a score.
Neumann batted the ball out of
Bear 1 guard Gabe A r r i 1 I a g a's
hands, falling on his face in the
process, and (hen flipped to Haga.
Haga turned around, saw Isaacs
all alone under the basket and
heaved the ball to Carl, who scor
ed. That tied it at 59-59. A minute
later game high scorer Hill Bond
pumped in a jump shot for his
22d point of the evening. Score,
til-59.
Wagner Steps Up
And when Hap Wagner stepped
to the free-throw line with 10 sec
onds left, it seemed the game was
Stanford's. But Wagner missed
on]y his second miss in nine tries.
Isaacs and Bear guard Karl Rob
inson, 17 point man Friday, tan
gled and, as was the case all night
when the rel's were in doubt, a
jump was called.
The lip- went lo Cal center
Duane Asplund. Asplund ricochet
ed it lo Larry Friend going down
the middle of the court* like the
Bayshore traffic, and the game
was in overtime, 61-61.
Three minutes into the over
time, Friend left the game with
Hi points and 5 fouls as Haga
stepped to the free-throw line,
scene of many Stanford frustra
tions throughout the night.
â€¢ This time the fated line proved
friendly, though, as the towering I
sophomore forward netted one
and missed one and Stanford got
the rebound. Then it was Neu
mann slipping right past the
Bears for a driving, hooking lay
up. Score, f> I -f> I.
But from there on in, every-1
thing wenl wrong. Robinson start
ed it off by flexing his lithe arm
to the tune of a two-point corner
set shot.
Killer Kapp
And, with 40 seconds left. .Toe
Kapp, who killed the Cards in a
Big Came of some remembrance,
slid under the hoop for a 65-64
hook shot.
Haga, owner of the best shoot
ing percentage on Ihe squad, miss
ed two tip-ins and then fouled
Bear guard Eddie Diaz.
Twenty seconds remained and
one point divided the fives, but to
Diaz it was just good, clean fun.
From all appearances the coolest
man in the Pavilion, the ."j-11 Bear
guard flipped them both in for
the game.
Cal might have been even bet
ter had not the Berkeleyites lost
6-0 forward Don Mcintosh early
in the game with a sprained ankle.
Until Mcintosh was forced to
retire, Cal could count on getting
to hat the ball around like a vol
leyball under its own basket.
All-Court Press
Cal's all-court press also seemed
to bother the Indians in the first
half. With four minutes left, the
Bears held their longest lead of

the game at 35-23. FriCnd then
1 left with three fouls, though, and
j at half time things had subsided
to around 41-31.
Stanford's big second-half break
; came at 13:23 when Friend racked
up his fourth foul. Bear hacker
iRv McKeen then went in for
! Friend, and the Indians went to
I work.
With Bond, Haga, Neumann and
j Isaacs leading the way, the Cards
began to chip away at the Cal 10-
j point edge. Two short ones by
i Isaacs cut il to three points, and
| then Haga flicked in a jumper for
! 58-57. Two minutes remained as
Arrillaga stepped to the free
throw line on a widely-booed call.
He made one for 59-57 and miss
ed one to let the Bears stall. Neu
-1 mann, on whom the Arrillaga foul
had been called, wasn't having any
of that, though, and set off the
I confusing climactic circumstances
when lie stole the ball.
The win was Cal's 10th straight
and gave the Bears a 6-0 confer
ence record. Stanford has two
wins and four losses.
Kasy Win
In the Santa Clara game, the
Indians let the Broncos first
place five in the California Bas
ketball Association dominate re
bounding and shooting in coasting
to an easy win.
The Dallmarmen seemed to he
suffering the effects of their
grueling Cal battle and were
handicapped by the absence of
Neumann, who was resting an
ankle injury incurred last week.
The closes! the Cards ever came
was at 16-14, midway through the
i first half. But the Broncos' Jerry
Bachich then bucketed six straight
points, and Santa Clara was off
and running to a 45-32 half-time
I bulge.
The Stanfords came out fight
ing after the intermission. But
the Indians' fight appeared to do
more harm than good as their ag
gressive defense turned the see
j ond half's first 10 minutes into a
! whistle - blowing contest between
I the two referees. Santa Clara re
sponded by free-throwing its way
I to a 60-42 cushion.
Bond poured nine poi nt s
through in the next six minutes
to cut it to a close 64-57. but Isaacs
fouled out at that point, and that
was the ball game.
The Indians' next cage foe will
be the last-place Oregon Webfoots,
whom they play this Friday and
Saturday at Eugene.
