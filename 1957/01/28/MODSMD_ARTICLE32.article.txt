Washington and Washington State took the measure of their
neighbors from Oregon in weekend basketball action as the UW
Huskies ran their conference record to 7-1 with a double win over
OSC and WSC downed Oregon twice.
The Huskies reached the halfway mark in the PCC with (>4-53
and 58-51 triumphs over OSC, almost eliminating the Beavers from
title contention. Big Doug Smart topped the Seattleites both nights,
scoring 22 on Friday and 20 on Saturday. But the spark in a Husky
comeback Friday night was reserve guard Dick Crews.
Washington now has eight games remaining in PCC play, two
series on the road against tail-enders Oregon and WSC and a pair
of home court crucials with unbeaten California and UCLA.
Larry Beck, the conference's leading scorer, fattened his point
lead with a 64-point output against Oregon. The 6-3 Cougar for
ward, held to his season's low, 13, by Idaho on Tuesday, scorched
the nets for 33 points Friday and 31 on Saturday in leading 87N1
and 74-07 victories.
Oregon's Charley Franklin, however, almost stole the show
from Beck with a 36-point performance on Friday, top single-game
show in the conference this season. Franklin came back with 20
markers in the second game. •
WSC pushed the Webfoots further down into the* PCC cellar
with the triumphs and brought their own record up to 3-5. Stan
ford takes on the Cougars next week in the next home series for
the Cards. This week Coach Howie Dallmar's hustlers travel to
