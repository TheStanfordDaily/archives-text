WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 ( I JP)
Sen. Henry M. Jackson (I)-Wash.)
proposed today that the armed
forces combine their missile pro
grams under one over all agency.
Jackson, a member of the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee,
made the statement when asked
about reports that the Air Force's
Thor ballistic missile had "failed"
on a recent test.
lie said he did nol know the
details but felt "a lot of trial and
error" could be expected in such
programs.
Jackson was a leading critic of
Defense Department missile and
air' policies during last year's Sen
ate hearings on relative strength
of the United States and Russia.
Under- congressional "prodding,"
he said, ttie department is now
pushing the missile program, al
though it has "lost valuable time."
He said the main problem now is
to "get better working relation
ship between the services."
Interviewed on the ABC-TV
"Press Conference" program, he
said the United States has "air
atomic superiority at the present
time." But he warned it might
fall behind Russia in the matter
of "dcliverability."
Jackson also said he saw "no
possibility" of cutting the new
military budget. He said cuts
made in one place would bo "swal
lowed up" in another.
