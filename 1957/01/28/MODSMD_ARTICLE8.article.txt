I believes the Republicans would

I gresfc last November if Christian
A. llerter had been President Ei
senhower's running mate instead
of Vice - President Richard M.
Nixon.
He also said Herder's name on
the GOP ticket would have won

j elections for the GOP.
Stassen, interviewed on Ihc
' ABC television program, "College
| News Conference," declined to

| GOP candidate for President in
! 1960.
Wants Ike Again
He said he wished personally
\ that "we could have President Ei
senhower for a third term." Ei
I senhower cannot run again be
| cause of the c on s t i t u Ii on a I

[ to two terms.
The former Minnesota gover

Stassen, who entered into the
political discussion reluctantly,
refused to speculate on the possi
bility of a race between Nixon
and Senate Republican Leader
William F. Knowland (Calif.) for
the 1960 GOP Presidential nomi
nation.
But he said Knowland's recenl
announcement that he will retire
from the Senate at the end of his
term in J958 was a "very signifi
cant step." There has been some
talk Knowland will run for Cali
fornia governor in 1958 as a
springboard to the Presidential
nomination.
