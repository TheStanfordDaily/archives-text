WASHINGTON, .lan. 27 (UP)
Treasury Secretary George Hum
phrey said tonight he is confident
that the Administration, working
together with Congress and the
public, can trim President Eisen
hower's new record peacetime
budget.
He added that "it we can make
a sufficient reduction now, then
wp would be in a position to re
dure taxes a year from now."
Humphrey, interviewed on the
NBC-TV program "Meet I lie
Press," conceded that the chore
will not be easy. He said il will
require working "days, nights and
Sundays" dur in g the next IX
months to cut federal spending
wherever possible.
"I don't see why we can't make
some progress toward doing it,"
he said. "I think we will make
some progress."
Humphrey, who has predicted a
"hair-curling" depression eventu
ally if federal spending is not cut,
refused to be drawn into a con
Iroversy with Eisenhower over the
government's role in such a situ
ation.
He syid, however, that it would
be "hard for me to see" any cir
cumstances which would justify
red-ink spending by the govern
ment. Eisenhower said 'last week
lie would use any constitutional
means to halt a depression.
Humphrey denied a suggestion
that he was waging a "one-man"
economy drive. He said Eisen
hower is in "complete accord"
with his goal and there is "almost
unanimous belief in the Cabinet
that wc have to improve the situ
ation."
