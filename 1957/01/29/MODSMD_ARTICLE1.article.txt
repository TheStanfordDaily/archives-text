LONDON, Jan. 2S C P) -Brit
ain's government today hailed the
Eisenhower Doctrine and the sta-
Honing <>l U.S. forces in this coun
try as measures designed to pre
vent an atomic war.
Ilotne Secretary R. A. Butler,
standing in for Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan, flatly rejected
a Laborite demand for the imme
diate withdrawal of U.S. airmen
from Britain.
The troop - withdrawal demand
was presented l>v Stephen Davies,
a Welsh pacifist, who charged
I hat the Eisenhower Doctrine and
(he presence of U.S. troops in
crease the risk that Britain will
be involved in war. *
"No, sir,'" Butler snapped.
Solely to Protect
"The policy announced by the
President envisages the use of
American forces in the Middle
Easl solely to protect Middle
Eastern countries against overt,
armed aggression from any na
lion controlled by international
Communism, and (hen only at the
desire of the nation attacked.
"The purpose of this policy, far
from provoking war, is to prevent
it. The U.S. forces in the United
Kingdom (Britain) are part of
lite deterrent against war."
The discussion in the House of
Commons coincided with the start
of Defense Minister Duncan San
dys' current conferences in Wash
ington talks which Bulle}' said
are likely to increase Anglo-
American atomic co-operation.

Meanwhile in Washington, Ei
senhower's Middle East resolu
tion cleared its next to last House
hurdle today when the Rules
Committee sent it to the House
floor for final approval expected
Wednesday.
Simultaneously, the combined
Senate Foreign Relations-Armed
Services Committee postponed ac
tion until tomorrow on a Demo
cratic move to force a full review
of U.S. foreign policy, with em
phasis on the Middle East.
The Senate committee had been
scheduled to vote today. But
Democrats said Republicans re
quested the postponement so they
could confer with Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles. Sena
tor- J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.)
predicted the study would be ap
proved.
The House committee sent the
President's resolution to the floor
under a "gag" rule barring
amendments. Several members
protested that the rule put the
1 louse in a "straitjacket." But
they decided against engaging in
a parliamentary fight.
