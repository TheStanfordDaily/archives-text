corrupt ion.
One OFscutiug Vote

was the member who voted
against the statement and that
two other council members ab

ephone calls at his hotel when
sought for comment.
"The AFL-CIO is determined
that any remaining vestige of
racketeering or corruption in un

cated," the policy statement said.
"We believe that Congress, in
the interest of enacting corrective
legislation . . . has the right,
through proper committees, lo
investigate corruption wherever
it exists, whether in labor, indus
try or anywhere else."
Right to Investigate
The EJxecutive Council, repre
senting some 60,000,000 members
of various unions, said its policy
was lo "co-operate fully with all
proper legislative committees."
"This means that all officials of
the AFL-CIO and its affiliates
should freely and without reser
vation answer all relevant ques
tions asked by proper law en
forcement agencies, legislative
committees and other public bod
ies seeking fairly, and objectively
to keep the labor movement free
of corruption," the statement
said.
Meany explained it would be up
to the individual unions to pun
ish their own officials if they vio
late the policy. The Executive
Council would step in if the un
ions failed to take action.
