SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28 —
<TJP)—Henry Ford 11, president
of Ford Motor Co., today criticized
the nation's foreign policy as "tire
alarm diplomacy" and suggested
that the withholding of aid from
Soviet satellites was not in "our
own best interests."
Ford told some 5000 delegates
to tho 40th annual National Auto
mobile Dealers convention that
present trade policies with Red
China and other satellite nations
"have tended to play right into
the Kremlin's hands to the extent
that they make the satellites more
dependent on Moscow."
Need to Be Realistic
"1 think we need to be realistic,"
he said, "and decide whether our
trade-and-aid policies toward such
satellite areas as Poland, Hunga
ry. East Germany and even Red
China are really in our own best
interests."
The young industrialist said
that in view of the menacing new
world situation "we are going to
have to come of age fast" to meet
the crises in Europe and the Mid
dle East.
"We can no longer afford to
take a passive stand and merely
react to things after they happen,
in a sort of fire alarm diplomacy,"
Ford said. "We've got to get out
ahead of events and try to lead
them and shape them to the best
of our ability."
Must Meof Challenge.
A former alternate U.S. dele
gab* to the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly. the auto maker
said the nation must meet the
challenge of the new Soviet eco
nomic and political aggression "by
devising realistic and long term
programs of trade and economic
aid."
"This is a struggle tor which
we are uniquely filled, both by
tradition and experience," he said
"If American know how and in
eenuity have anything to contrib
ute lo the progress of mankind,
it is precisely in the areas of this
conflict. If we don't step up and
meet Ibis test, then the Russians
will have us licked at the game we
know best."
Ford advocated a "triors real
istic and unemotional approach"
to foreign aid and warned that
"we should gel rid ot the childish
notion that we are out to buy love
or friendship. What we should on
pert is for other nations to realize
that our friendship is to be desired
and our antipathy to br avoided
in their own best intfU'ests."
