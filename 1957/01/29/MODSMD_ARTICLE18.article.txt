# $2.2 Billion Requested For Federal School Aid
## President Sends Program to Congress; Has Formula That Failed Last Year 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 < UP>â€”President Eisenhower today sent
Congress a $2.2 billion school aid program containing the same
financial formula that contributed to its defeat last year.
He told the House and Senate in a special 2000-word message
thai (he program is necessary to wipe out the "most critical"

shortage of classrooms that has
developed since World War 11.
Its main provision would be
$1 .3 billion in grants to the states
handed out at the rate of $325
million a year for four years un
der a complex distribution sys
tem.
Eisenhower proposed that the
program take into account a
state's financial needs, as well as
its school population, in allocat
ing the funds.
Scuttled by Democrats
This provision was scuttled last
year by House Democrats who
drafted a substitute bill basing
the formula solely on population.
The measure eventually was de
feated in a controversy over the
financing feature and an anti-seg
regation amendment.
Eisenhower sought to head off
another integration fight this
year by urging Congress to con
sider the program "on its own
merits, uncomplicated by provi
sions dealing with the complex
problems of integration."
Defending his "need and ef
fort" allocation formula, Eisen
hower said any system "based
solely on school age population
would tend to concentrate federal
aid in wealthy states most able to
provide for their own needs."
Predicts Passage
Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Tex.)
predicted the House will pass a
school aid bill this year. But he
said he hoped it would not include
the President's allocation plan.
House Republican Leader Jo
seph W. Martin Jr. (Mass.) said
the President's aid plan would
safeguard local control of the
schools. He said it would deal
with an "emergency" and "is not
a permanent program of aid that
will go on and on indefinitely."
Chairman Lister Hill (D-Ala.)
of the Senate Labor Committee
said he planned to offer a bill
which would provide larger
grants than the President's pro
gram would provide.
Hill, whose group handles
school legislation in the Senate,
also indicated he would wait to
see what the House does before
taking action. He said the Senate
had twice passed school aid bills
whereas the House had not.
