NEW YORK. Jan. 28 (UP)â€”
The government pressed its case
against three alleged Soviet spies
today by questioning prospective
members of a special federal
grand jury to decide on an indict

When court adjourned late to
day, no jurors had been chosen.
The questioning was to resume
tomorrow.
The painstaking process took
place under the watchful eye of
kingpin gambler Frank Costello's
veteran attorney. George Wolf,
who turned up to represent two
of the defendants, Jack Soble, 53,
and his wife, Myra, 52.
The other alleged spy, Jacob
Albam, (i5, was represented by a
court-appointed attorney.
The three, all natives of Lithu
ania, were arrested at their homes
last Friday on charges of conspir
ing to commit espionage for the
Soviet Union. Federal attorneys
have indicated they may seek the
electric chair for the trio.
