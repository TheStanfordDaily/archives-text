# Wilson Calls National Guard Sort of Scandal
## Says Used for 'Draft Dodging Business' During Korean War 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 28 (UP)
— Defense Secretary Charles E.
Wilson said today the National
Guard was "a sort of scandal"
during the Korean war and was
used by young men as a "dratt
dodging business."
Wilson's accusation, which re
called former President Truman's
one-time troubles with the Marine
Corps, evoked sharp rebuttals in
Congress and from the National
Guard Association.
Maj. Gen. E. A. Walsh, presi
dent of the latter group, said two
Guard divisions and many other
Guard units saw combat in Ko
rea. Other thousands of men, he
said, volunteered for Guard units
ticketed for Korea.
"If those tens of thousands of
men were trying to avoid miiltary
service, they certainly took a pe
culiar way of doing it,"he said.
Pulls No Punches
Wilson, pulling no punches in
what he termed "this politically
controversial area," made the
statement while testifying before
the House Armed Services Com
mittee on President Eisenhower's
new military budget.
Committee members, already
aroused by the Army's recent
overhaul of its reserve program,
expressed regret over what Rep
resentative Melvin Price (D-Ill.)
called Wilson's "unfortunate" re
mark.
Price said the Guard was "usu
ally the backbone of the wartime
Army . . . the first into combat."
"No Comparison"
Representative Charles E. Ben
nett (D-Fla.) agreed. He said
there was "no comparison be
tween their (the Guard's) com
bat readiness and that of the re
serves.
Wilson indirectly blamed the
National Guard for the failuie ol
the new reserve program which
was supposed to build a 2.9-mil
lion-man ready-reserve by 1960,
paving the way for cuts in the
regular anned forces.
He said many men now in the
reserve forces—which inlcude the
Guard — "are not basically
trained." He added that steps
were being taken to correct "thir.
undesirable situation."
