# Another Dulles Blooper
## 
### 
Tf the Eisenhower Administration were to
award a prize for the most devastating blooper
{>u!!ed by ann >er of the "team," John Foster
Dulles would win hands down.
Until last Friday, Dulles ran a poor second
to Defense Secretary Charles Wilson, but in one
swoop the "Flying Dutchman" of the State De
partment left Wilson lagging far behind.
Speaking before a Senate hearing on Eisen
hower's Mideast policies and the United States'
position in that area, Dulles, apparently in a
humorous manner, commented that "personally
\ would rather not hnv French and British
soldiers beside me, ' n my right and one
on my left."
He was refeir'ng to the possibility of re-entry
of Briiish and French forces into the Sue/ area,
but his reference was not couched in the most,
tactful or diplomatic language.
An acid-sharp blast immediately broke from
across the Atlantic. British papers bannered
Dulles' "insult" across the front pages.
in characteristic British language, the Lon
don Times said editorially that Dulles had
"made another of his irritating gaffes."
"A statesman," the Times said, "should guard
his tongue."

Ihe British are sensitive about their recent
embarrassment in ihe Middle East. They have
paid dearly for it —both economically and in
terms of international self-respect.
Hot considering the neeessity of mending
the breach in the Atlantic alliance, it is im
perative that we ignore past rifts and work
constructively and diplomatically to achieve
harmony where discord once existed.
Many Democrats are crying out for Dulles'
scalp. Much of this is political expediency,'but
there is truth in the criticism thai Dulles, de
spite his good intentions, has offended allies
by his tactless statements, undermined the effi
ciency and self-confidence of State Department
officials by his constant flights abroad and given
a confused picture (if this country's foreign
policy to I lie American people as well as to
our allies.
I lie ( nited States has seen that it cannot
afford the luxury of a weak and vacillating
foreign policy. And, in the same vein, this
country should not he made to suffer the
damage of a Secretary of State who, more than
once, has thrown our allies into a stale of
righteous indignation b\ a careless slip of the
tongue.

Until last Friday, Dulles ran a poor second
to Defense Secretary Charles Wilson, but in one
swoop the "Flying Dutchman" of the State De
partment left Wilson lagging far behind.
Speaking before a Senate hearing on Eisen
hower's Mideast policies and the United States'
position in that area, Dulles, apparently in a
humorous manner, commented that "personally
\ would rather not hnv French and British
soldiers beside me, ' n my right and one
on my left."
He was refeir'ng to the possibility of re-entry
of Briiish and French forces into the Sue/ area,
but his reference was not couched in the most,
tactful or diplomatic language.
An acid-sharp blast immediately broke from
across the Atlantic. British papers bannered
Dulles' "insult" across the front pages.
in characteristic British language, the Lon
don Times said editorially that Dulles had
"made another of his irritating gaffes."
"A statesman," the Times said, "should guard
his tongue."

Ihe British are sensitive about their recent
embarrassment in ihe Middle East. They have
paid dearly for it —both economically and in
terms of international self-respect.
Hot considering the neeessity of mending
the breach in the Atlantic alliance, it is im
perative that we ignore past rifts and work
constructively and diplomatically to achieve
harmony where discord once existed.
Many Democrats are crying out for Dulles'
scalp. Much of this is political expediency,'but
there is truth in the criticism thai Dulles, de
spite his good intentions, has offended allies
by his tactless statements, undermined the effi
ciency and self-confidence of State Department
officials by his constant flights abroad and given
a confused picture (if this country's foreign
policy to I lie American people as well as to
our allies.
I lie ( nited States has seen that it cannot
afford the luxury of a weak and vacillating
foreign policy. And, in the same vein, this
country should not he made to suffer the
damage of a Secretary of State who, more than
once, has thrown our allies into a stale of
righteous indignation b\ a careless slip of the
tongue.
Tf the Eisenhower Administration were to
award a prize for the most devastating blooper
{>u!!ed by ann >er of the "team," John Foster
