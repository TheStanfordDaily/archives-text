Much More Than a Symbol
Editor, The Daily:
Judging only from a reading of Daily no
counts of student government activities, the Jan.
25 editorial gives a good description of the cur
rent state of student government affairs on cam
pus.
However, I think it is a mistake to look only
to action on "issues" which are either "created"
or rise "sp6ntaneously from the students" for
increasing the value of student government
This approach overlooks the role which stu
dents can fulfill in discussing and resolving prob
lems of concern to th<* entire University. Stu
dents can take an active part in discussing prob
lems like the pressure of increasing enrollments,
course evaluation and credit requirements.
The National Student Association and its
many member student governments are actively
concerned with these and many other problems,
among which are student tax relief, draft laws,
desegregation and international student rela
tions.
We cannot long remain isolated from the na
tional student community and still expect to be
aware of and concerned about all of the areas in
which student government can contribute to the
University.
Even without the "issues" which the editorial
socme 1 to hope for, student government can be
much more than "a symbol of what has been and
nvght someday be."
Hod Nelson

Editor's Note: Nelson's point that student
government should consider problems of ('on
cer!) to the University community as a whole
is an excellent one and one that we did not in
tend to pass over.
When we spoke of issues "created by stu
dent government" or "rising spontaneously
from the students," we were speaking of issues
and matters of significance. As we said in
Thursday's editorial, "Student government
could be the forum from which discussions f»er
tiiu'nt to University life could develop."
Stanford experimented briefly with the Na
tional Students* Association and the "more se
rious" issues which it attempted to bring forth.
There was serious interest among a limited
number of students, but in a campus-wide ref
erendum last year, Stanford's membership in
NSA was decisively rejected.
The main complaint against NSA was that
it failed to deal with anything "concrete," that
Stanford was so tar ahead of other universities
that a national association would have little to
contribute to us.
But there is an intrinsic value to any group
whit h offers an exchange in viewpoints, objec
tives and methods of problem-solving. This fact
was ignored, or considered of little value.
It is our hope that eventually Stanford's
membership in NSA will be reconsidered, or at
least, that Stanford will become preoccupied
with the problems that are of serious concern
to the University community as a whole.

The National Student Association and its
many member student governments are actively
concerned with these and many other problems,
among which are student tax relief, draft laws,
desegregation and international student rela
tions.
We cannot long remain isolated from the na
tional student community and still expect to be
aware of and concerned about all of the areas in
which student government can contribute to the
University.
Even without the "issues" which the editorial
socme 1 to hope for, student government can be
much more than "a symbol of what has been and
nvght someday be."
Hod Nelson

Editor's Note: Nelson's point that student
government should consider problems of ('on
cer!) to the University community as a whole
is an excellent one and one that we did not in
tend to pass over.
When we spoke of issues "created by stu
dent government" or "rising spontaneously
from the students," we were speaking of issues
and matters of significance. As we said in
Thursday's editorial, "Student government
could be the forum from which discussions f»er
tiiu'nt to University life could develop."
Stanford experimented briefly with the Na
tional Students* Association and the "more se
rious" issues which it attempted to bring forth.
There was serious interest among a limited
number of students, but in a campus-wide ref
erendum last year, Stanford's membership in
NSA was decisively rejected.
The main complaint against NSA was that
it failed to deal with anything "concrete," that
Stanford was so tar ahead of other universities
that a national association would have little to
contribute to us.
But there is an intrinsic value to any group
whit h offers an exchange in viewpoints, objec
tives and methods of problem-solving. This fact
was ignored, or considered of little value.
It is our hope that eventually Stanford's
membership in NSA will be reconsidered, or at
least, that Stanford will become preoccupied
with the problems that are of serious concern
to the University community as a whole.
Much More Than a Symbol
Editor, The Daily:
Judging only from a reading of Daily no
counts of student government activities, the Jan.
25 editorial gives a good description of the cur
rent state of student government affairs on cam
pus.
However, I think it is a mistake to look only
to action on "issues" which are either "created"
or rise "sp6ntaneously from the students" for
increasing the value of student government
This approach overlooks the role which stu
dents can fulfill in discussing and resolving prob
lems of concern to th<* entire University. Stu
dents can take an active part in discussing prob
lems like the pressure of increasing enrollments,
course evaluation and credit requirements.
