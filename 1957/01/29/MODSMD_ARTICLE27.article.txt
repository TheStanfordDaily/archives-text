# Language Rooms Started in Library
## Music Listening Area Converted for Class Training Purposes 
### 
The Stanford Lforary under
went a progressive transforma
tion at the beginning of autumn
quarter this year a fact that is
still surprising a great many peo
ple on campus.
A rnusiu lover, hoping to hear
a recording of Beethoven's Fifth
last week, was just such a person.
Sneaking into the music listen
ing room, he plugged in the ear
phones and settled hack to enjoy
the strains of his favorite com
poser. Instead, his ears were
greeted with the words, "Nun lia
ben wir eir.e Geschichte auf
Deutseh!" Hoping to hear Bee
thoven's music and not his lan
guage, the student quickly tried
the other tapes.
"Quiere Ud. oir una groma en
espanol?"
"La langue franchise n'est pas
si difficile, quand on pent enten
dre les phrases ..."
It was no use. And so the stu
dent sadly trudged away, taking
his search for Beethoven else
where.
A more linguistically endowed
person would perhaps have been
happier to discover that the old
music listening room has now
been turned over to the manage
ment of the Germanic and Ro
manic Languages Department,
and that six new high fidelity
playback tape machines now sup
plement classes in French, Ger
man, Italian, Portuguese and
Spanish.
And he, along with all other
language students, will also be
pleased to note that this room
has been redecorated and equip
ped with acoustical tile, fluores
cent light, and wired formica
tables—financed in part by the
Ford Foundation.
The hours for this new lan
guage listening room are !) a.m.

p.m. Monday through Friday; ft
a.m. to noon on Saturday, and I

phones in th<> music listening room of the Main Library. Six new
machines now play hack supplements to Germanic and Itomanic
language courses.
The Stanford Lforary under
went a progressive transforma
tion at the beginning of autumn
quarter this year a fact that is
still surprising a great many peo
ple on campus.
A rnusiu lover, hoping to hear
a recording of Beethoven's Fifth
last week, was just such a person.
Sneaking into the music listen
ing room, he plugged in the ear
phones and settled hack to enjoy
the strains of his favorite com
poser. Instead, his ears were
greeted with the words, "Nun lia
ben wir eir.e Geschichte auf
Deutseh!" Hoping to hear Bee
thoven's music and not his lan
guage, the student quickly tried
the other tapes.
"Quiere Ud. oir una groma en
espanol?"
"La langue franchise n'est pas
si difficile, quand on pent enten
dre les phrases ..."
It was no use. And so the stu
dent sadly trudged away, taking
his search for Beethoven else
where.
A more linguistically endowed
person would perhaps have been
happier to discover that the old
music listening room has now
been turned over to the manage
ment of the Germanic and Ro
manic Languages Department,
and that six new high fidelity
playback tape machines now sup
plement classes in French, Ger
man, Italian, Portuguese and
Spanish.
And he, along with all other
language students, will also be
pleased to note that this room
has been redecorated and equip
ped with acoustical tile, fluores
cent light, and wired formica
tables—financed in part by the
Ford Foundation.
The hours for this new lan
guage listening room are !) a.m.
to noon, J to 4 p.m. and 7 to 10
p.m. Monday through Friday; ft
a.m. to noon on Saturday, and I
to 112) p.m. on Sunday.
