# Looking It Over

Willi Pacific Conference basketball action at the half way mark,
lot s look over the situation, ponder on the remaining tilts and ihrow
in a prediction or two.
from this corner it appears that a most unfortunate situation is
in the making.
II is almost certain that California, UCLA and Washington will
continue as the '"Big Three" in conference play. In previous years
the conference champion automatically went to the NCAA Regional
playoffs at Corvallis. This year, however, both UCLA and Washing
ton arc ineligible for NCAA championship competition. Therefore,
the Bears of Berkeley should get the nod.
Looking over the remaining games as scheduled fur the
season, tin* Washington Huskies appear blessed with the must ad
vantage.>u:.■ seliedali —«»ne which calls fur double-headers against
bulb the Itroins und the {{ears in Seattle. The Huskies are tough
to beat no their home court, a huge pavilion which gives the oppo
sition an inferiority complex.
California and UCLA, both undefeated thus far in conference
play, have a tougher schedule and between them may lose up to
seven games before the season'(haws to a close. Looking from ihis
angle, it's Washington (15-1.), UCLA (13-3) and California (12-4)
after the last whistle. The Huskies' only loss? A 70-03 beating at
Stanford.
II tiiis outlook is correcl, the third best PCC representative will
enter the NCAA regionals. This lime it comes from no ruling of
conference officials. The PCC applied to the national committee 1o
accept all hut football champions in official post-season playoffs.
The request was refused.
The Cal Bears whose only competition for the playoff bid would
come from either Stanford <ir Oregon State College, will, undoubt
edly, he worthy representatives. Coach Pete Newell's cagers have
lost only tn Kansas and San Francisco this year and appear to be well
seasoned. Hut the road is rough and rocky from here on out. Larry
Friend. Karl Robinson and Company will find Washington, UCLA
and USC not so accommodating as Washington State, Oregon and
the Indians.
The program next year will greatly help eliminate any annual
advantage. The liome-and-liome schedule calls for each l'('( squad
to meet (he entire conference representation—once at home, once
on the road.
Along with California in the Western regional playoffs, it will
probably be the rugged Broncos of Santa Clara, nationally-rated
Seattle University and Brigham Young, leader in the Skyline Con
ference.
Of tier likely contenders for the National Collegiate championship
are Kansas, lops in the Big Seven; Ohio State, undefeated in Big Ten
play; Kentucky, lied for the lead in the Southeastern Conference,
and North Carolina, undisputed leader in the Atlantic Conference.
