OSC and Washfngton in their six
outings against the leaders and
suffered only one decisive defeat,

' to Cal in Berkeley. The total mar
gin of defeat in the other three
losses has been eight points.

j records and set a new season's
i individual high for the PCC when
: he pumped in 36 points against
Washington State Friday night,
i lie followed with a 20-point per
formance on Saturday. Frank-
I lin's Friday night showing was

prepare to take what looks like a breather this week when they
.journey to Eugene to meet the last-place Oregon Ducks. But nothing
is too certain the way Pacific Coast Conference basketball has been
going lhis season.
Coach Steve Belko's Webfoots have managed only one victory over

Idaho in six conference outings.
Last week they extended Wash
ington State twice before losing
to the Cougars, 87-81 and 74-67.
The Ducks' most impressive PCC
performance was their opener
against league - leader California
when they gave the unbeaten
Bears a big scare before dropping
a 53-46 decision.
Only UCLA of the loop power
houses remains on the Stanford
schedule. The Bruins were rated
along with Washington. Califor
nia and Oregon State at the top
of the PCC this season. The
Cards have managed upsets over
OSC and Washfngton in their six
outings against the leaders and
suffered only one decisive defeat,

' to Cal in Berkeley. The total mar
gin of defeat in the other three
losses has been eight points.
