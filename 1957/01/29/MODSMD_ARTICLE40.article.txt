# Ability of Foreign Student To Express Self Discussed
## McDaniel Leads ESPRI Discussion; Croup Attempts to Define Academic Freedom 
### Steve Deck 
The degree to which a foreign
student can express himself with
out being criticized was the sub
ject of an ESPRI discussion in
Cubberley yesterday.
ESPRI, which is officially the
Educational Society for the Pro
motion of Relations Intercultural,
also attempted to define "aca
demic freedom," with Dr. Henry
Bonner McDaniel, professor of
education and psychology, lead
ing the discussion.
Charles A. Zwingmann, a grad
uate education student from
Switzerland, representing the for
eign students on campus, told the
group that a foreign student usu
ally feels bound by certain rules
of courtesy.
He hesitates to make critical
statements for fear of antagoniz
ing people around him. The for
eign student is a minority on a
U.S. campus and is quite aware
of it.
McDaniel said that Stanford at
tempts to see no difference be
tween foreign and United States
students. It is important that for
eign students lie given a mecha
nism for expression, either con
structive or critical.
He defined academic freedom
as the freedom to question and
criticize, and said that the faculty
is intellectually committed to this
freedom. The faculty are human
beings, however, and able to
make mistakes, so that language
barriers make misunderstandings
more possible.
The foreign student, McDaniel
said, perceives these language
problems because of his natural
diffidence in un 112 a m i 1 i a r sur
roundings, and does not talk over
any problems that arise until the
situation has become acute.
Part of the problem of failure
to discuss such situations earlier
is the student's conception of the
proper role students and faculty
should occupy in a university,
Zwingmann said.
He was "puzzled," he said,
when he first came to the United
States by the informal relation
ship between students and fac
ulty. and his surprise is shared by
most of the foreign students.
The faculty, McDaniel said,
generally tends to think of aca
demic freedom in connection with
the amount of information the
person expressing an opinion has.
Difficulties arise when broad
sweeping statements are made,
classifying numbers of people un
fairly, which immediately puts
the audience on the defensive.

Zwingmann said that, in plan
ning a program of study, the for
eign student is largely dependent
upon the direction and advice of
his adviser. If the student is re
luctant to say what he thinks, he
may find himself in a program
he does not like at all.
Some foreign students may feel
a conflict in doing things that
they do not quite believe in, in
order to participate and learn
Ihem as the United States' way
of living. Zwingmann said. Here
again is the problem the foreign
student has in not knowing
whether to say what he feels.
ESPRI is the education depart
ment's vehicle for intercultural
relations on campus. It strives
for an interchange of ideas be
tween U.S. and foreign students
and faculty on an informal level,
through group meetings such as
the one yesterday.
