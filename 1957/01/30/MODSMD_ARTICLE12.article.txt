# World State Plans Attacked By Speaker
## 
### 
Dr. William V. Lawlor of Glen
dale yesterday attacked proposed
world government plans "because
there's no getting out of them,
they're universal and they even
tually and ultimately involve the
use of force."
In a speech sponsored by Stan
ford's Independent Caucus in
Bowman Alumni House, the Glen
dale doctor said Robert Maynard
Hutchins, Clarence Streit, the
World Parliamentarians, the
World Federalists and other advo
cates of world government "do
not want representative govern
ment."
Want Dominance
What they do want, Lawlor
said, is a highly centralized gov
ernment involving almost com
plete dominance of the executive
branch over the legislative and
judicial.
Besides, he said. "The Commu
nist elements in the world would
hold the balance of power in any
world government." This is be
cause the free world holds only
37',:• per cent of world's popu
lation to the Communist world's
62'j per cent, Lawlor said.
He said a world government,
such as those suggested, would
not only dominate national and
international affairs but would
control the daily and domestic
lives of citizens.
Need Local Control
Local control over such officers
is needed, according to Lawlor,
because local control insures rep
resentative government. He said
loopholes permit America to fall
under world government by. mere
executive agreement.
Although he was not directly
referring to the United Nations
in his attack on world govern
ment, Lawlor assailed that body
for its lack of "moral position,"
"its playing of power politics"
and the weakness of its Genocide
Pact.
"The Genocide Pact," he said,
"prosecutes the innocent and lets
the criminal go free because it
does not apply to nations, which
•commit atrocities, and does apply
to individuals, against whom
atrocities are committed."
