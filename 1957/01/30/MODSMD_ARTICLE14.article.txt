"Eisenhower Doctfine."
The unanimous vote came as President Eisenhower's proposal lor

Mideast won its first test on the
House floor, 2H2 to 146. The si/.e
of the vote virtually clinched
final House approval of the Presi
dent's plan tomorrow.
The House approved a so-called
"gag rule" which limited debate
on the proposal to one day and all
but forbade amendments. One
Congressman, Representative H.
R. Gross (R-la.i, accused House
leaders of trying to "ram" the
proposal through.
But House Democratic Leader
John W. McConnack (Mass.)
joined GOP leaders in urging
speedy approval of Eisenhower's
proposal to use American dollars
and U.S. troops if necessary
against any Communist aggres
sion or subversion in the Middle
East.
Let Them Worry
McCormack drew a roar of
approval from House members
when he declared: "Too many
Americans worry about what the
Communists are saying and
thinking. It's time we let the
Communists worry about what
we do and what we say."
The extensive review of U.S.
Middle East policy was voted by
the Senate committee in approv
ing a compromise resolution
sponsored by Senator J. William
Fulbright (D-Ark.). He and oth
er Democrats have harshly criti
cized the policies of Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles.
However, Eisenhower staunch
ly defended Dulles today as "an
outstanding, dedicated man, do
ing a terrific job under handi
caps." He made the statement
during a surprise visit to the Cap
itol for lunch with Republican
Senators.
Social Call
Chairman Styles Bridges 'R-
N.H.) of the Senate GOP Policy
Committee said Eisenhower also
spoke of "the importance of the
Middle East resolution." But he
added that the President's visit
was "essentially a social call."
Republicans approved the for
eign policy review after it was
agreed that the period to be stud
ied would be extended from five
to 10 years to cover the Truman
as well as the Eisenhower admin
istration.
Both the State Department and
Eisenhower said they had no ob
jection. GOP Congressional lead
ers reported after a White House
meeting that Eisenhower agreed
so long as the review did not hold
up action on his Middle East pro
gram.
