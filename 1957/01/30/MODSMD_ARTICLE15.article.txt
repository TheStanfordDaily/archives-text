WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (UP)
Senate Democratic airpower in
vest iga tors charged today that
U.S. defenses against surprise
atomic attack have been weak
ened by the administration's
"tendency to either ignore or un
derestimate" Russian military
progress.
The three Democrats, members
of a special investigating subcom
mittee headed by Senator Stuart
Symington (D-Mo.). said Ameri
can vulnerability to sudden at
tack has increased "greatly" in
the past 10 years and "will con
tinue to increase in the foresee
able future."
They said the U.S. "heartland"
is vulnerable to submarine mis
sile attack; the U.S. defense
warning system is inadequate;
Russia already has more combat
planes and is closing the "quali
tative gap"; and the United States
is short of jet tankers.
Ticking off other "deficien
cies," they said the U.S. missile
program has lagged.
