# Wilson Stands Fat on Charge Against Guard
## Defense Chief Refuses To Retract Guard Draft-Dodging Charge 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (UP) —
Defense Secretary Charles E Wil
son, ignoring a nation-wide bar
rage of protest, today stood firmly
behind his charge that the Na
tional Guard has been used as a
"draft dodging business."
Dripping with rain outside the
"draft-dodging business."
not only refused to retreat, but
again displayed his facility for
using colorful expressions.
Asked why he had called on
President Eisenhower, Wilson re
plied, "This is not my dunghill—
anything that is to be announced
over here, somebody else ought
to announce."
Guard Not Discussed
But one thing they did not dis
cuss, he said, was Wilson's con
troversial remarks about the Na
tional Guard yesterday before the
House Armed Services Commit
tee.
Wilson, defending his depart
ment's plan to make guardsmen
take six months of basic training,
told the committee that the guard
was a "sort of scandal ... a
draft - dodging business" during
the Korean war.
The words were no sooner out
of his mouth than he was caught
in.a crossfire of criticism from
congressmen and guard officials
from coast to coast.
"Tough Language"
As the barrage grew heavier
today, Wilson conceded he per
haps used "a little tough lan
guage." But he said "that is exact
ly what it amounted to."
Asked about demands that he
apologize, the white-haired de
fense leader, no stranger to such
disputes, told reporters, "I know
of no reason why I should."
lie also said in reply to ques
tions that he had fixed no date for
quitting the government, but ex
pected to leave "soonei or later."
