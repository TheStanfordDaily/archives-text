# Help Yourself... And Help Me Too'

"Help me, too," says the blue-eyed blond
little boy on crutches who looks out from I lie
March of Dimes campaign poster. The moan
ing of this plea is clear; thousands of children
and adults are still stricken by and suffering
from polio.
The Salk vaccine, developed by the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis with March
of Dimes funds, brings in sight the end of polio.
But until all present cases are rehabilitated and
all possible future eases prevented, the work
of the March of Dimes will not end.
Stanford students may do more than just
help those already stricken. Not only may
every person here help prevent the spread of
infantile paralysis, but may at the same time
insure himself safety from the disease.
Every Wednesday and Thursday afternoons
the Health Service offers vaccination shots at
cost, with no administration charge, to all Stan
ford students. The series of three shots comes
as close to complete immunization as modern
science has be ■ able to achieve.
So far, the - alth Service program has ad
*ered a total of 2800 shots, giving about
i 00 each day. Chief nurse Mrs. Mary F. Wood
■v' s this is a ""pretty good response, but it could
be much better."
The importance of the Salk vaccinations can
not be underestimated. Not only is the student
insuring his own safety, but he is decreasing
the number of people able to catch and spread
polio. Monetary contributions to the March

of Dimes are, of course, important. They aid
those people who are already victims of the
disease.
Last year alone, Santa Clara County March
of Dimes funds totaling $122,500 were spent
on 176 infantile paralysis patients. There are
more than 80,000 people suffering from the
disease in the United States today, and 15,000
of that number are cases which occurred last
year alone. The March of Dimes is continuing
its research on cure for these patients and is
changing its foens from emergency aid to long
term rehabilitation.
Hut money is not enough. Recently the Amer
ican Medical Association called a nation-wide
meeting of doctors and scientists to launch an
all-out campaign to end polio in the United
States. This job cannot be completed until the
public is shaken out of "its inertia and apathy"
toward use of the Salk anti-polio vaccine, said
AMA president I)r. Dwight H. Murray.
Vi hen he called the meeting to map plans
for an intensive vaccination program, Murray
said: "This public service project is aimed at
the key target of eliminating the disease once
and for all. But the public's 'don't care' atti
tude may be the real enemy."
There is no need for Stanford students to
have the "don't care" altitude. There is no
right for Stanford students not to care. The
vaccine is available, the cost is less than usually
charged, the location offers all possible ease.
Everyone can answer the call to "help me, too."
Everyone can answer the call to help himself.
