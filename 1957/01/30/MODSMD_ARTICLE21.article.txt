# ON OTHER CAMPUSES-By Mary Ellen Romney
## University Editors Bemoan Press Controls 
### 
Two topics occupied the minds of college
newspaper editors across the country last week
—freedom of information, and again that contro
versial problem, the role of the fraternity in the
university.
* * *
Editor of the University of Washington Daily,
in a front-page editorial "The Right to Know,"
bemoaned the fact that the university had not
revealed the salary of the U. of W.'s new Husky
football coach.
Athletic director of the university had refused
to reveal the salary on the grounds that "a man's
salary is his personal business." But the Daily
felt ' information which is of vital interest and
concern to the student body and the public, as
we feel this is, should be made public.
"A matter such as this must be expect «*d to
face public comment and possible criticism." the
editorial said. "The student body and the public
must be given the right to judge for themselves."
The Washington incident is mentioned in an
editorial from the University Hatchet of George
Washington University in Washington. D.C. The
editorial summarized an article from Editor and
Publisher magazine, which reviewed the issues
of collegiate press freedom.
Speaking of difficulties college papers have
encountered, the editorial said:
"An editor of the Daily Northwestern re
ported current freedom to comment In spite of
the fact that three editors have been fired by
the publications board in recent years, which fir
ings the editor attributed to irresponsibility.

"A member of the Black and White, Univer
sity of Georgia, told of a long history of editorial
suppression by a politically controlled board ot
regents, and a member of the Daily Texan at the
University of Texas reported a recent editors'
fight with the board of regents, resulting in a
denial by the publications board of student mem
bers' rights to vote and an intimidation of the
editors."
The editorial concludes: "The freedom of the
press is a continuing struggle, even on an under
graduate level, and no college community can
claim to be mature without a school paper
headed by editors who realize their responsibility
and an administration which allows that respon
sibility to be exercised."

A few postscripts on fraternity problems:
After a University of Washington pledge was
found in Seattle's central bus depot clad only in
his underwear and a blanket, the Dean of Men
at the university said a review must be under
taken immediately of hazing activities.
A sociology professor at Northwestern
charged "some persons in charge of regulating
the Greek houses favor retaining discriminatory
clauses," and as a result fraternity and sorority
discrimination has not been discouraged by uni
versity policy.
The professor, Raymond Mack, spoke at a
Student Religious Council lecture series on dis
crimination. He said he was disturbed about the
nature but not the existence of fraternities and
sororities at the university.

found in Seattle's central bus depot clad only in
his underwear and a blanket, the Dean of Men
at the university said a review must be under
taken immediately of hazing activities.
A sociology professor at Northwestern
charged "some persons in charge of regulating
the Greek houses favor retaining discriminatory
clauses," and as a result fraternity and sorority
discrimination has not been discouraged by uni
versity policy.
The professor, Raymond Mack, spoke at a
Student Religious Council lecture series on dis
crimination. He said he was disturbed about the
nature but not the existence of fraternities and
sororities at the university.
Two topics occupied the minds of college
newspaper editors across the country last week
—freedom of information, and again that contro
versial problem, the role of the fraternity in the
university.

Editor of the University of Washington Daily,
in a front-page editorial "The Right to Know,"
bemoaned the fact that the university had not
revealed the salary of the U. of W.'s new Husky
football coach.
Athletic director of the university had refused
to reveal the salary on the grounds that "a man's
salary is his personal business." But the Daily
felt ' information which is of vital interest and
concern to the student body and the public, as
we feel this is, should be made public.
"A matter such as this must be expect «*d to
face public comment and possible criticism." the
editorial said. "The student body and the public
must be given the right to judge for themselves."
The Washington incident is mentioned in an
editorial from the University Hatchet of George
Washington University in Washington. D.C. The
editorial summarized an article from Editor and
Publisher magazine, which reviewed the issues
of collegiate press freedom.
Speaking of difficulties college papers have
encountered, the editorial said:
"An editor of the Daily Northwestern re
ported current freedom to comment In spite of
the fact that three editors have been fired by
the publications board in recent years, which fir
ings the editor attributed to irresponsibility.

"A member of the Black and White, Univer
sity of Georgia, told of a long history of editorial
suppression by a politically controlled board ot
regents, and a member of the Daily Texan at the
University of Texas reported a recent editors'
fight with the board of regents, resulting in a
denial by the publications board of student mem
bers' rights to vote and an intimidation of the
editors."
The editorial concludes: "The freedom of the
press is a continuing struggle, even on an under
graduate level, and no college community can
claim to be mature without a school paper
headed by editors who realize their responsibility
and an administration which allows that respon
sibility to be exercised."
