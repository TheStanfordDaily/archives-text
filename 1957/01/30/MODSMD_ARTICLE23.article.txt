Proposed Changes in Social Rules
Editor, The Daily:
Wo have read Willi interest Ihe discussions
and letters concerning women's social regula
tions. It is our opinion that these regulations do
not meet the need for which they arc intended
and deny the formulation of maturity in college
students.
The purposes of social regulations are to help
the student to develop "social maturity" by giv
ing her the freedom of decision, to provide a
concrete basis upon which to carry out the Fun
damental Standard, and to alleviate the possi
bility of a student's presenting an unfavorable
appearance to the public. *
When a woman enters .Stanford, she should
he mature enough to be able to accept certain
responsibilities. If she is not mature enough to
do so, it should he the goal of (he University to
help her to attain this responsible attitude. How
ever, existing social regulations do not achieve
this goal. The student is given very little, if any,
freedom of decision.
By imposing strict rules upon the students,
social regulations curtail the development of re
sponsibility and judgment. The strict quota and
hours of late leaves result in a girl's evading the
responsibility of formulating her own standards.
Being given this rigid set of rules, she has no
need to think about making her own decisions.
This trust should extend into the realm of wom
en's social regulations. A person is much more
likely to become responsible and trustworthy
when she is given a reasonable degree of freedom
and expected to use it. sensibly than when she
must conform to senseless rules imposed upon
her arbitrarily by an outside source.
The reputation of Stanford is created by (he
actions of the individual students, not by the
rules which govern them. Such rules can, and
will, be broken if ihey are unreasonable.
Wc would suggest that the following changes
be made in social regulations:
• That the late leave quota be unlimited and
that all late leaves be 2:30's. First-quarter fresh
men, however, would be given thirty 2:30's, aver
aging three a week. The signout procedure, for
reasons of practicality, would be kept, and the
procedure on offenses and technicals would re
main unchanged.

• That a three-technical bonus, similar to the
existing ifj late minute bonus, be instituted each I
quarter. This would give a leeway for the rea-.
sonable percentage of human error, which, in I
effect, inconveniences no one.
• That the necessity of having a hostess on
an overnight be abolished.
• That a woman be allowed to live off cam
pus if she is 21 or a senior.
We believe these suggestions are practical
and are in keeping with the true spirit of "the
Fundamental Standard. If carried out, they
would encourage women students to develop the
mature outlook needed to face situations after
graduating from college.

Social Regulations Necessary
Editor, The Daily:
1 am one of the men who believes in the So
cial Regulations for Women. Some people may
overlook that women are human. From what I
have been able to see, most Stanford women are
after an education and like to study.
Since the women are the minority sex at Stan
lord, they are liable at all times before closing
hours to be called up by one or more of many
boy friends not to say that they do not appre
ciate the call, but talking does take up valuable
study time. Those hours after 10:30 in Hie eve
ning are, no doubt, valuable study hours.
If the women's dorms were to remain open
until midnight, I have little doubt that their
house grade-point averages would go down. The
desirability of closing up the women's dorms was
hi ought home to me one time as I was returning
a girl to her dorm one night between 10:30 and
midnight. Outside the dorm there was a fellow,
obviously drunk, who was throwing stones at the
building trying to get the attention of one of the
girls inside.
Fortunately the dorm was locked and I under
stand that the police took care of him. 1 shudder
to think what might have happened if the dorm
had been open. No doubt the girls can protect
themselves, but. Furthermore, women 9vc much
more closely controlled by their families than are
the men. Would their parents allow them to
come to a Stanford"which had no social regula
tions for women? I seriously doubt it.
