One of the causes of poor eye
sight, particularly in the aged, is
I due to diminished blood circula
tion in the retina. With the use
of radioactive blood, the Stanford
physicians found hy Cleiger coun-
I ter readings that the proportion
of blood flow was in a normal 37-
to-1 ratio between the choroid and
the retina.
