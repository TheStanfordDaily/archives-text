THE DRESS PAHADE
What will the American college student wear this
spring? Gather round, you rascals, and light a good
Philip Morris Cigarette, and puff that rich, natural to
bacco, and possess your souls in sweet content, and listen.
As we know, college fashions have always been casual.
This spring, however, they have become wake shift.
The object is to look madly improvised, gaily spur-of
the-moment ! For example, girls, try a peasant skirt with
a dinner jacket. Or matador pants with a bridal veil. Or
Bermuda shorts with bronze breastplates. lie rakish!
Be impromptu! Be devil-take-the-hindmost!
And, men, you bo Ihe same. Try an opera cape with
sweat pants. Or a letter-sweater with kilts. Or a strait
jacket witTi hip boots. Be bold! Be daring! Be a tourist
attraction!

But all is not innovation in college fashions this
spring. In fact, one of the highlights of the season turns
time backward in its Might. I refer to the comeback of
the powdered wig.
This charming accoutrement, loo long neglected, lias
already caught on with style-conscious students all over
the country. On hundreds of campuses rock-and-roll is
giving way If) (he minuet, and patriotic undergraduates
are dumping British tea into the nearest harbor. This, of
course, does not sit well with old King George. For that
matter, a lot of our own people are steamed up too, and
there has even been some talk of revolution. But I
hardly think it will come to that. I mean, how can we
break with 1<he mother country when we are dependent
on her for so many things — linsey-woolsey, minie balls,
taper snuffers, and all like that ? She, on the other hand,
relies on us for turkeys, Philip Morris, Cinemascope, and
other valuable exports. So 1 say, if Molly Pitcher and
those other Rryn Mawr hotheads will calm down, we may
yet find an amicable solution for our differences. Hut
let not our British cousins mistake this willingness to
negotiate for weakness. If fight we must, then light we
will! Paul Revere is saddled up, the rude bridge arches
the Mood, and the ItOTC is ready!
I5ut I digress. We were smoking a Philip Morris
Cigarette — 0, darlin' cigarette! (), happy smoke! (),
firm! 0, fresh! O, fragrant! O, long-size! 0, regular!
O, get some!—and talking of new spring fashions, let
us turn now to the season's most striking new feature:
pneumatic underdrawers. These inflatable rubber gar
ments make every chair an easy chair. Think how wel
come they will be when you sit through a long lecture!
They are not, however, without certain dangers. Last
week, for example, Rimbaud Sigafoos, a University of
Pittsburgh sophomore, fell out of an 18th story window
in the Tower of Learning. Thanks to his pneumatic
underdrawers, he suffered no injury when he struck the
sidewalk, but the poor fellow is bouncing and it is
feared that he will starve to death.
