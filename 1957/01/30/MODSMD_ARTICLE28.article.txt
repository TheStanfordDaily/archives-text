Whal is this "jolly old sport" called rugby?
Nobody swishes ion bags around in a cup out there on ihe field.
Nobody asks, "Mow many lumps?" Although there are jimple op
portunities to pick up a few the kind that come from shoulder driven
into lummy in playing the game.
Rugby, first of all. is not soccer, ft is a body-contact sport like
American football. It is a basically simple game which is confusing
primarily because spectator and player alike.cannot divorce their
thinking from football.
English rugby football is a direct antecedent of American
football. It is also suspected that it had profound influence on
l>r. Naismith, developer of basketball. Because both of these
spoils have drawn heavily on rugby for rules, rugby can best
be described in the familiar terms of these two more common
games.
Rugby is played by 1 ~ man sides; on football fields up to 150 yards
in total length and 75 yards wide.
The teams are divided between eight-man scrums (lines) and seven
back field men. Despite the fact tliat tackling is an integral part of
the game, players wear only shoil punts and the characteristic rui/by
jersey.
Though the length of the field is not absolute, the maximum is
110 yards from goal line to goal lino, with 20-yard in-goals (end zones)
at each end. Goal posts are on the goal lines.
The game is played with a football which appears to have a severe
case of the mumps. It is better adapted to kicking than the American
ball, which was streamlined to facilitate forward passing. There is
ijo forward passing in rugby, though the ball may be "dribbled"
forward with'the feet (as in soccer).
Rugby is an offensive game. The constant activity of the
game is broken only by scores or official actions. There are no
huddles. The 40-minute halves mean nearly 80 minutes of action.
Compare this with the li minutes which Sports Illustrated re
cently revealed was the sum of actual play in the Rose Bowl.
Naturally enough, the object of the offense ihe game is to score.
This is done by running and pushing steadily goalward until the ball
has actually been touched down in the 1 opponent's in-goal (though it
is a real touchdown, it is called a try) or until the ball can be kicked
between the goal posts (field goal). Both of these maneuvers net
the team three points.
The only other means of scoring is to convert the free kick
awarded to a team after it has scored a try. This is worth two points.
It is interesting to note that for this conversion tin* ball is
brought out 25 yards parallel with the sidelines from the exact
point where it was touched down. The closer to the center the
ball is touched down in-goal, the easier the converter's job.
Major differences between rugby and football, besides the constant
activity and spontaneity of play, are that there ;s no blocking, no
forward passing and no offensive movement ahead of the ball. The
ball spearheads the rugby attack as is somewhat the case in soccer
and basketball.
In rugby, however, anyone closer to the opponents' goal than the
ball must freeze until the ball carrier passes him. Otherwise he is
"off-side."
The off-side rule is the greatest enigma of the game, both lo
spectator and player. The man with the ball must lead the attack,
and the only real contact in the game conies between tackled and
tackier or between men playing a loose ball in a scrum.
The runner is theoretically on his own, but football players cannot
resist the urge to clear things out downfield.
This situation is further confused when a man punts the ball (as
is liable to happen almost any time during play). All of his team
mates goalward from him when he punts are off-side until the punter
has passed them.
They may not make any attempts to harass or tackle an opponent
until they are put on-side by the punter or until (he opponent has
played the ball (run with or punted it).
The punier, thus, becomes the hall for off-side purposes, ami
only players behind him when he punts can play tin' opponent
without first being put on-side.
Â£ final point accentuating the difference between football and ;
rugby is the fact that one referee and two sideline judges (who merely !
indicate which team was least responsible for putting the ball out j
ol bounds and therefore should be allowed to toss it back into play) j
handle the officiating in rugby.
