# Neumann Question Mark As Indians Prep for Ducks
## 
### Dick Harms 
Paid Neumann remains the big
question mark for Stanford's up
coming week-end series with the
Oregon Ducks in Eugene. Neu
mann, who injured an ankle
against Washington, will not take
to the.court until Friday night
garnet ime.
Should Neumann's injury make
him unable to start against the
Ducks, sophomore John Pflueger
will take his place. Pflueger was
the man who took over Neu
mann's slot against Santa Clara
last Saturday as Coach Howie
Dallmar initiated rest treatment
lor his reliable guard.
The Indians will bo playing only
their second and third road games
of the now year, having played
seven of their last eight in the
friendly Stanford Pavilion.
Dallmar isn't worried about this
angle, however, noting that Stan
ford played generally good ball on
its long road tour over the Christ
mas vacation and has looked bad
in only one away game the 59-45
loss to California at Berkeley.
The situation is just tho reverse !
for Oregon. Tho Ducks, who have j
compiled a poor 1-5 record in PCC j
competition, have played only two
of those games at home. Theyl
will now he at home for three j
straight..series beginning with tho
two games against tho Indians.
That the Ducks will be rough
at homo is evidenced by their split
with invading Idaho. A week ear- j
lier the Vandals lost a pair of one
point decisions to UCLA, ihe na
tion's fifth-ranked team.
If the Tribe can sweep Ihe se
ries thoy will even their PCC rec
ord at 4-4 and greatly enhance
their chances for at least a fourth- [
place finish. Stanford closes out
its schedule with two-game sets
against three second-division clubs
Washington State, Idaho and
USC â€” and the powerful UCLA
team.
Stanford will continue to prac
tice at home today and tomorrow
and will fly to Eugene Friday!
morning.
