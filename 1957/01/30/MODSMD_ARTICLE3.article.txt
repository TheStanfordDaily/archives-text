# GOOD PEDAL WORK
## Harvard Musician Combines Virtuosity With Unsteadiness 
### Bob Christiansen 
Remarkable virtuosity combined with a little unsteadiness in llie
organ concert of Carl Weinrich, head of the music department of
Harvard University, last night in Memorial Church.
The Harvard musician, presenting a program in the regular Tues
day Evening Series, showed highly practiced pedal work in his per-

formance of the Prelude, Fugue |
and Chaconne in C of Buxtehude. j
r l'lie Pavan of William Byrd, i
which was originally composed
for virginal, in its organ guise
came off a little worse for wear.
Wcinrich had an unusual choice
of stops, and the use of tremolo
was very much out of place.
The Concerto in F by George ]
Frederick Handel again showed
a highly practicel virtuosity, but,
unfortunately, was plagued by
highly erratic tempi. The two
fast movements, especially,
showed this lack of steadiness
which is so contrary to the style
of the period. Of the four Cho
rale Preludes of Bach, by far the
best was "These Are the Holy
Ten Commandments."
Weinrich's choice of the vox
humana stop with tremolo for
the Chorale Prelude "Out 1 Fa
ther" was in highly questionable
taste. The well known St. Anno
Fugue of Bach was capably
played.
Probably the highlight of the
program was Weinrich's playing
of the Chorale in B Minor of Ce
sar Franek. The composition is
essentially a theme with varia
tions. Weitirieh showed a feeling
for the style as well as a polished
virtuosity.
The program concluded witi*
Liszt's Fugue on Ad Nos Salula
rein which was, indeed, a wonder
ful showcase for Weinrich's many
talents. Especially notable was
the fine pedal technique in this
piece. «

organ concert of Carl Weinrich, head of the music department of
Harvard University, last night in Memorial Church.
The Harvard musician, presenting a program in the regular Tues
day Evening Series, showed highly practiced pedal work in his per-

formance of the Prelude, Fugue |
and Chaconne in C of Buxtehude. j
r l'lie Pavan of William Byrd, i
which was originally composed
for virginal, in its organ guise
came off a little worse for wear.
Wcinrich had an unusual choice
of stops, and the use of tremolo
was very much out of place.
The Concerto in F by George ]
Frederick Handel again showed
a highly practicel virtuosity, but,
unfortunately, was plagued by
highly erratic tempi. The two
fast movements, especially,
showed this lack of steadiness
which is so contrary to the style
of the period. Of the four Cho
rale Preludes of Bach, by far the
best was "These Are the Holy
Ten Commandments."
Weinrich's choice of the vox
humana stop with tremolo for
the Chorale Prelude "Out 1 Fa
ther" was in highly questionable
taste. The well known St. Anno
Fugue of Bach was capably
played.
Probably the highlight of the
program was Weinrich's playing
of the Chorale in B Minor of Ce
sar Franek. The composition is
essentially a theme with varia
tions. Weitirieh showed a feeling
for the style as well as a polished
virtuosity.
The program concluded witi*
Liszt's Fugue on Ad Nos Salula
rein which was, indeed, a wonder
ful showcase for Weinrich's many
talents. Especially notable was
the fine pedal technique in this
piece. «
