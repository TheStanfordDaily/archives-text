### 
Stanford basketball fans will be
able to see only one game in the
Pavilion this weekend. Coach
Dick Clegg's Stanford Papooses
will meet Mountain View High
School in a till tenfatively sched
uled for 6 p.m. Saturday.
There is some possibility that
Ihe game will be rescheduled t<Â»
4 p.m.
One change has been made in
the freshman starting lineup for
this game. Clegg has named Mike
Tipton to start in place of John
Stabler. Tipton turned in a 17-
point contribution in last Friday's
win over Oakland J.C.
Remaining starters include Jer
ry Thuesen and Chris Burford at
forwards, Ne a 1 Brockmeyer at
center and Dick Thompson at
guard.
Mountain View's quintet cur
rently has a tight hold on the
second - place spot in the Santa
Clara Valley Athlelic League,
which is quite strong this year.
Led by the rebounding and
shooting of Steve Flynn, 6-5 cen
ter, and aided by jump-shot artist
Earl Escobar, ihe Mountain View
squad has continually challenged
the league leaders this season.
Clegg feels they will be a good
match for his squad.
Co-captain Mason Byles, while
not listed as a starter, is expected
to see more action Saturday, now
that his injured ankle has been
strengthened.
