## 
### 
Philip 11. Ithinelander, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
oners, lasi night advised students
to "choose a field of concentra
tion not directly related to your
intended vocation."
Speaking he Tore 100 students on
how to choose a major, Rhine
lander said that the above advice
applied pariicularly to pre law and
pie-Business School students who
deiny their vocational preparation
until their graduate work.
"Your undergraduate career,"
Ithinelander said, "is the one lime
in your life when you can ex
plorc."
Narrow Training
Some courses, such as engineer
ing and, to a lesser degree, pre
incd, do require narrow vocational
training, the dean said.
But in general he told the stu
dents not to "feel disturbed if by
your sophomore and junior years
you haven't made up your mind,s
as to your vocations. One of the
purposes of college is to help you
make up your mind."
< hoice BeMer
In his senior year the average
student can make his vocational
choice hotter than in his freshman
year, Ithinelander said. Besides,
lie continued, college has other
purposes besides preparing stu
dents for vocations.
Ilhinolandor's speech, sponsored
by the sophomore class, was given
in Bowman Alumni House.
