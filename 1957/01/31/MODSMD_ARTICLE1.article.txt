# Speaker Emphasizes Racial Issue Alter Trip to Russia
## Reds Make Propaganda Out of Social Problems; USSR Citizens Interested in Minority Troubles 
### 
I he major result of Wilson C. Riles' 28-day visit to Russia was the
realization thcil today's controversial racial situation is American
democracy's biggest danger.
Riies, ;t Negro member of a San Francisco State College-sponsored
tour In the USSR, explained in a YWCA speech yesterday that Rus-

sian propagandists are capitaliz
ing on, as well as exaggerating
and distorting, every unfavorable
racial issue that arises in this
country.
Specifically, he cited the recent
Autherine Lucy case, noting that
11io incident was publicized in
front - page banner headlines in
newspapers throughout Europe
and many parts of Asia.
He explained that the Soviet
people have a great diversity
among their racial and ethnic
groups. But the government is
doing its best to establish friend
ship among the Soviet people. He
said that posters and propaganda
literature were as prevalent and
noticeable in Russia as Coca-Cola
advertisements arc in this coun
try.
The Russians point to the Unit
ed States as "the last great
stronghold of capitalism" and
stress its big racial problem; and
they advantageously stress that
their socialist regime is effective
ly abolishing the problem.
Everywhere he went, Riles
said, he was followed by large
groups of people. He questioned
an American now living in Russia
concerning the reasons for the
Russians' great interest in him.
The reasons were as follows:
• The Russians are naturally a
very friendly, outward, expres
sive group, almost adolescent in
their naivete.
• They feel themselves cham
pions of the oppressed minorities,
since they themselves have been
raised out of oppression under so
cialism.
• They are very interested in
the treatment of minority groups
in America as contrasted with
their treatment in Russia.
Riles, vice - president of the
Southern California Branch of
the American Civil Liberties Un
ion, spoke under the auspices of
the YWCA yesterday afternoon
in the Women's Clubhouse.
