Breakers jumped the gun by chip
ping in $50 toward the $8000 goal. ,
"Giving Important"
Winbigler, speaking before
about 25 of the 400 solicitor volun
teers, said: "The business of giv- j
ing is a very important part of
education. My interest in this
charity drive is somewhat directed
toward the needs of the Red
Cross, somewhat directed toward
the needs of the Community!
Chest, somewhat directed toward
the needs of Ihe World University
Service but mostly directed to
ward Ihe needs of the Stanford
student." He "congratulated" so
licitors for their charitable action.
The dean said some of the poor
est individuals are the richest in
respect to generosity. He gave the
example of the students at a cer
tain Middle Western college dur
ing the depression who, he said,
"wore more generous than Stan
ford students today."
Material Generosity
Generosity is important, Win
bigler said, although generosity in
material things doesn't always
lead to "intellectual generosity."
"It is possible for people to be
generous with money and to be
very stingy intellectually—to be
bigoted," Winbigler said.
Being generous is part of the
life of a community, he said, and
college students must take part in
that life.
"One of Ihe attitudes that I run
into," Winbigler said, "is: 'While
we're in school we're not living.
We'll live later. Now we're in
school.' "
Students can'l put off living or
giving until later, Winbigler said.
Dean's Kolc
Referring to his role in the
drive's Weigh * the - Dean Contest
next Thursday, Winbigler 1 quip
ped, "I'll be out there making a
spectacle of myself for this cause,
and I'll be thinking of you out
there making a spectacle of your
selves also."
Other features of the solicitors'
meeting included a speech by
ASSU President Bob Kreelen arrd
the reading of h letter from Presi
dent Wallace Sterling.
Winter Quarter Drives commit
tee chairman Skip Renner read
Sterling's letter to Ihe committee,
which said, in part: "Acceptance
of Ihe obligation of service to
one's fellow man is the mark of
h good citizen I am proud of
the record of Stanford students in
relief and welfare work at home
and abroad."
"American Tradition''
Sterling noted Ihe "American
tradition" of "voluntary support"
for worthwhile causes. He ended:
"You can collect money only by
asking for it. Be thorough in your
solicitation and it will pay."
Freelen reminded the audience
of Alexis de Tocqueville's (author
of the Political Science I text "De
moeracy in America") observation
lhal Americans meet their needs,
not through government, hut
through voluntary, associations.
He cited Ihe Winter Quarter
I Charity Drive committee as an
example of such a voluntary asso
ciation.

"Giving Important"
Winbigler, speaking before
about 25 of the 400 solicitor volun
teers, said: "The business of giv- j
ing is a very important part of
education. My interest in this
charity drive is somewhat directed
toward the needs of the Red
Cross, somewhat directed toward
the needs of the Community!
Chest, somewhat directed toward
the needs of Ihe World University
Service but mostly directed to
ward Ihe needs of the Stanford
student." He "congratulated" so
licitors for their charitable action.
The dean said some of the poor
est individuals are the richest in
respect to generosity. He gave the
example of the students at a cer
tain Middle Western college dur
ing the depression who, he said,
"wore more generous than Stan
ford students today."
Material Generosity
Generosity is important, Win
bigler said, although generosity in
material things doesn't always
lead to "intellectual generosity."
"It is possible for people to be
generous with money and to be
very stingy intellectually—to be
bigoted," Winbigler said.
Being generous is part of the
life of a community, he said, and
college students must take part in
that life.
"One of Ihe attitudes that I run
into," Winbigler said, "is: 'While
we're in school we're not living.
We'll live later. Now we're in
school.' "
Students can'l put off living or
giving until later, Winbigler said.

and abroad."
"American Tradition''
Sterling noted Ihe "American
tradition" of "voluntary support"
for worthwhile causes. He ended:
"You can collect money only by
asking for it. Be thorough in your
solicitation and it will pay."
Freelen reminded the audience
of Alexis de Tocqueville's (author
of the Political Science I text "De
