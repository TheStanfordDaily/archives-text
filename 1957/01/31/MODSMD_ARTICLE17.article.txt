# Eisenhower's Proposal Passed by House Vote
## Middle East Plan Strongly Endorsed By Both Parties 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (UP)
—The House handed President Ei
senhower a major legislative vic
tory today by giving overwhelm
ing approval to his "fight if we
mist doctrine for protecting the
Middle East against Communism
By a roll-call vote of 355 to 61,
Republicans and Democrats
joined in a strong display of bi
partisanship to send the resolu
tion to the Senate, where it face 1
a. stormy course.
On the final House showdow i,
188 Democrats joined 167 Repub
licans in voting for the resolution.
Only 35 Democrats and 26 Repub
licans were opposed. The House
rejected, 191 to 45, a last-minute
attempt by Representative Law
rence H. Smith (R-Wis.) to send
the legislation back to committee.
The House vote came shortly
after Eisenhower vigorously de
fended Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles from rising Demo
cratic criticisms in the Senate. He
told his news conference he be
lieved Dulles was the best Secre
tary of State he ever had known.
The resolution would give Ei
senhower virtually all the extra
power he requested to deter So
viet penetration into the oil-rich
Middle East. As it passed the
House it would:
• Authorize the President to
use U.S. troops, if necessary, to
thwart military attack on a
Mideast nation by Russia or any
other Communist-controlled coun
try. The nation attack
. would have to request the aid.
I ® Permit him to spend, largely
as he sees fit, an extra $200 mil
lion in economic aid in the area
I before June 30. Eisenhower also
wants another $400 million in
Mideast, aid over the next two fis
cal years.
Eisenhower's request for Con
gressional approval of his new
Mideast policy has prompted t lie
Senate to undertake a long-range
view of U.S. policy in that area.
It also has provoked a barrage
of criticism of Dulles for his han
dling of U.S. Mideast policy. Some
influential Democrats have de
manded that Dulles resign.
