# Criticism Where It's Needed
## 
### 
President Eisenhower yesterday made a posi
tive move toward honest, straightforward gov
ernment when he said that Defense Secretary
Charles E. Wilson was "very unwise" in saying
the National Guard was used as a "draft-dodg
ing"' device during the Korean war.
This open rebuke by the President is a grati
fying sign that approval is given to those who
deserve it, and criticism to those who need it.
Earlier this week Wilson accused the Na
tional Guard of being "a sort of scandal * used

for draft-dodging. After a later conference.wilh
Eisenhower, Wilson con tinned his barrage of
strong language in referring lo llie While House
as a "dunghill. '
Wilson has already been called lo task'hy
many members of Congress and llie National
Guard for his criticism of the thousands of men
who fought in Korea. Nonetheless, he saw "no
reason to apologize." The President is to be
commended for speaking openly to the nation
on the Administration's stand.
