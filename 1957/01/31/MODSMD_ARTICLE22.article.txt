# MODEL UNITED NATIONSâ€”By Jack Winkler
## Host of Problems Faces 85 MUN Workers 
### 
With 85 people working in the Stanford Secre
tariat as department heads, committee members
and secretaries, the Model United Nations staff is
now solving transportation problems for 500 dele
gates from 58 schools who will be here April 10-13.
The Secretariat must arrange travel facilities
for all the visiting student'' from their motel ac
commodations stretched a >ng El Camino to Stan
ford each day for mea 3 . 1 MUN meetings.
Another big transpc rtanon problem faces the
staff in how to get the visitors up to the Saturday
night banquet in San Francisco.
Delegates will be coming from as far away as
Victoria, 8.C.; Moscow, Ida., and Phoenix, Ariz.,
and most will not have their own cars. Current
plans have the guests eating at University dining
halls and fraternity houses for all meals, includ
ing breakfasts. What that means is that 500
people will have to be picked up at motels all the
way from San Jose to San Francisco and brought
to Stanford in time for early breakfast.
Also being worked out at the moment are the
room assignments for the seven committees and
the International Court of Justice. Arrangements
are being made with the ROTC to provide ser
geants-at-arms, in full uniform, for all committee,
ICJ and General Assembly meetings.
Currently being prepared is a large series of
exhibits on UN organization, functions and ac
complishments to be placed on view around cam
pus during the MUN meeting.

The agenda for the four-day meeting was re
leased yesterday by Department of Public Infor
mation director Randy Freeman. Scheduled tor
Wednesday evening is the welcome to all the dele
gates and the keynote address. The speaker is
not definitely set as yet, but it is hoped that ex-
UN Secretary-General Ralph Bunche will be here
to open the meeting.
This facsimile United Nations is the largest
such organization of its kind in the world. It was
started at Stanford in 1950 and has been growing
each year since then.

On Thursday and Friday the Security Council
and the committees will meet to discuss their
agenda items and pass resolutions concerning
Ihem.
The Department of Conference Services, under
Stephen Breyer, has worked out agendas similar
to those being discussed at the real United Na
tions this year and is now training Stanford stu
dents to act as chairmen of the seven committees.
Walt Hayes will direct the Security Council,
Craig Barnes the Economic and Social Council,
John Renshaw the Trusteeship Council, Jay
Kowal the Political and Security Committee, Eric
Flicker the Economic and Finance Committpe,
John Jordan the Social, Cultural and Humanita
rian Committee, and Claude Laval the Ad Hoc
Political Committee.
On Saturday morning the General Assembly,
under the chairmanship of a faculty member from
ihe Speech Department, will meet in the Pavilion
to act on the resolutions passed by the,various
committees.
* * *
A bit of excitement, should be created when
the Central Washington College of Education,
which is representing Hungary, has its two dele
gations fight over which representatives should
be seated.
Throughout ihe four days, affairs will be spiced
up by various caucus meetings of the "power
blocs." Arab, Latin-American, Communist, Afro-
Asian and Western groups will all have impromp
tu, informal conferences.
The General Assembly meeting will definitely
be on network radio and KZSIJ, and plans are
being made to have the meeting filmed for tele
vision. There will also be extensive newspaper
coverage.
MUN will climax the session with a banquet
Saturday evening at either the St. Francis or the
Fairmont hotel in San Francisco, and the dele
gates will leave either that night or Sunday
morning.

With 85 people working in the Stanford Secre
tariat as department heads, committee members
and secretaries, the Model United Nations staff is
now solving transportation problems for 500 dele
gates from 58 schools who will be here April 10-13.
The Secretariat must arrange travel facilities
for all the visiting student'' from their motel ac
commodations stretched a >ng El Camino to Stan
ford each day for mea 3 . 1 MUN meetings.
Another big transpc rtanon problem faces the
staff in how to get the visitors up to the Saturday
night banquet in San Francisco.
Delegates will be coming from as far away as
Victoria, 8.C.; Moscow, Ida., and Phoenix, Ariz.,
and most will not have their own cars. Current
plans have the guests eating at University dining
halls and fraternity houses for all meals, includ
ing breakfasts. What that means is that 500
people will have to be picked up at motels all the
way from San Jose to San Francisco and brought
to Stanford in time for early breakfast.
Also being worked out at the moment are the
room assignments for the seven committees and
the International Court of Justice. Arrangements
are being made with the ROTC to provide ser
geants-at-arms, in full uniform, for all committee,
ICJ and General Assembly meetings.
Currently being prepared is a large series of
exhibits on UN organization, functions and ac
complishments to be placed on view around cam
pus during the MUN meeting.
