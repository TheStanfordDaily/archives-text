Only "Extended Adolescence''
Editor, The Daily:
I read Mr. Guild's letter (advocating gradual
end to women's social regulations) with great
interest, and was glad to find that every women's
house meeting Monday night devoted time for
discussion of the present women's regulations. I
would urge that we use these discussions toward
active reform.
College should be the testing ground of the
individual to prove her maturity. It should be
ihe transition point from the relatively sheltered
a i restricted life of childhood to the life of
; ulthood and independence.
It should be the test for those principles and
standards we have learned in our homes, and the
«>; portunity for growth through trial and error.
T>ut under the existing regulations, Stanford for
• 'ornen is virtually another four years of ex
tended adolescence.
There is an outstanding inconsistency in the
conditions under which Stanford women live. The
Fundamental Standard, in which we are so thor
ughly indoctrinated as freshmen, applies appar
ently only to our scholastic education.
But in other facets of the life of the Stanford
woman, practical application of the Standard is
extremely limited. We are told that we are
adults, and are restricted by arbitrary rules
which deny the opportunity to use adult and in
dependent judgment.
University policy requires, reasonably
enough, that there be closing hours and sign-out
lips so that the University can get in touch with
the student in case of emergency. All other regu
lations are open for refr m. I would like to sug
gest the following:
After the nan year (when there is a
temptation to take undue advantage of new free
d< m before we have learned to organize our

time), there should be no restrictions on hours
or number of late leaves.
Every woman should sign out designating the
time that she expects to return, no matter at
what time of day or night that it is, and thus be
bound by her own decision, not by an arbitrary
ruling of with she has no choice. After that time,
she should be subject to penalty as consequence
of not living up to her own judgment.
This plan doubtless imposes more responsi
bility upon each person. Women will be forced
to think for themselves and use independent
judgment. This is what we are asked every day
to do in our classes, and expected to do in out
post-college years when restrictions' are neces
sarily self-imposed.

Inaccuracy of reporting is not the least fault
of Mr. Christiansen's review of Carl Weinrich's
concert. Any gentleman with even a slightly sen
sitive response to great music would have quick
ly recognized that the excellences which Mr.
Weinrieh displayed here last night could not pos
sibly have been fostered at the institution which
was listed as his academic home.
Let not the reputation of any great artist be
slighted by slanderous as ;ociatlon with the false
sophisticates on the Charles River marsh.
Loyal Princetonians rescue Mr. Weinrieh
from such slights and proudly let it be known
'hat he is the organist of the chapel and profes
sor of music at Princeton University.

University policy requires, reasonably
enough, that there be closing hours and sign-out
lips so that the University can get in touch with
the student in case of emergency. All other regu
lations are open for refr m. I would like to sug
gest the following:
After the nan year (when there is a
temptation to take undue advantage of new free
d< m before we have learned to organize our

time), there should be no restrictions on hours
or number of late leaves.
Every woman should sign out designating the
time that she expects to return, no matter at
what time of day or night that it is, and thus be
bound by her own decision, not by an arbitrary
ruling of with she has no choice. After that time,
she should be subject to penalty as consequence
of not living up to her own judgment.
This plan doubtless imposes more responsi
bility upon each person. Women will be forced
to think for themselves and use independent
judgment. This is what we are asked every day
to do in our classes, and expected to do in out
post-college years when restrictions' are neces
sarily self-imposed.

Inaccuracy of reporting is not the least fault
of Mr. Christiansen's review of Carl Weinrich's
concert. Any gentleman with even a slightly sen
sitive response to great music would have quick
ly recognized that the excellences which Mr.
Weinrieh displayed here last night could not pos
sibly have been fostered at the institution which
was listed as his academic home.
Let not the reputation of any great artist be
slighted by slanderous as ;ociatlon with the false
sophisticates on the Charles River marsh.
Loyal Princetonians rescue Mr. Weinrieh
from such slights and proudly let it be known
'hat he is the organist of the chapel and profes
sor of music at Princeton University.

I read Mr. Guild's letter (advocating gradual
end to women's social regulations) with great
interest, and was glad to find that every women's
house meeting Monday night devoted time for
discussion of the present women's regulations. I
would urge that we use these discussions toward
active reform.
College should be the testing ground of the
individual to prove her maturity. It should be
ihe transition point from the relatively sheltered
a i restricted life of childhood to the life of
; ulthood and independence.
It should be the test for those principles and
standards we have learned in our homes, and the
«>; portunity for growth through trial and error.
T>ut under the existing regulations, Stanford for
• 'ornen is virtually another four years of ex
tended adolescence.
There is an outstanding inconsistency in the
conditions under which Stanford women live. The
Fundamental Standard, in which we are so thor
ughly indoctrinated as freshmen, applies appar
ently only to our scholastic education.
But in other facets of the life of the Stanford
woman, practical application of the Standard is
extremely limited. We are told that we are
adults, and are restricted by arbitrary rules
which deny the opportunity to use adult and in
dependent judgment.
