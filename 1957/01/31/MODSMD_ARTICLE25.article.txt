## 
### Stan Gross 
The appointment of German
General Speidel to command the
Allied Land Forces in the Paris
Headquarters "makes any future
war virtually impossible," said
Wolf Dietrich Met bit/ ASSIT For
eign Scholar from Germany.
"It is a marvelous progress In
European affairs to have this sort
of unification militarily as well
as economically," he said.
Dieter, as he likes to be called,
is '2'A, and has been at Stanford
since autumn quarter, lie is ma
joring in economics, and is work
ing toward a degree from the
Free University of Berlin.
Germany recently called up the
first 200,000 conscripts fur an of
ficial build up of the army. "They
took only persons born in 1937,
and want to give each man spe
cial consideration," he said.
It might seem an inconsistency
in policy after the people have
be«">n educated for so many years
against militarism, "but it is a ne
cessity with East Germany build
ing up an efficient army," Dieter
said. The economy of West Ger
many can now support such an
army, he said. "Germans may be

better off economically than mosl
other European countries."
An influx of Hungarian refu
gees lias complicated West Ger
many's already serious refugee
problem. Thousands of East Ger
mans and people from East Prus
sia and Silesia have been enter
ing West Germany.
"People who are still called
Nazis are only old Nazis who can
I not forget the time when they
were on top profiting from Hit
ler's regime. Hut public opinion
is very aware of nationalism, es
pecially in the youth who will be
! the leaders of the country in a
j few years," he added.
"Nationalism might become a
j danger it the right wing radicals
take 1 lie issue of reunifying East
| and West Germany to advance
their position. Reunification is a
i very hot issue at present," lie
sal. I.
When Dieter returns to Ger
many, and after he receives his
diploma, he wants to work abroad
with one of the newly set up in
ternational authorities, such as
the Administration of the Coal
[and Steel Pool of the Sehuman
! Plan.

The appointment of German
General Speidel to command the
Allied Land Forces in the Paris
Headquarters "makes any future
war virtually impossible," said
Wolf Dietrich Met bit/ ASSIT For
eign Scholar from Germany.
"It is a marvelous progress In
European affairs to have this sort
of unification militarily as well
as economically," he said.
Dieter, as he likes to be called,
is '2'A, and has been at Stanford
since autumn quarter, lie is ma
joring in economics, and is work
ing toward a degree from the
Free University of Berlin.
Germany recently called up the
first 200,000 conscripts fur an of
ficial build up of the army. "They
took only persons born in 1937,
and want to give each man spe
cial consideration," he said.
It might seem an inconsistency
in policy after the people have
be«">n educated for so many years
against militarism, "but it is a ne
cessity with East Germany build
ing up an efficient army," Dieter
said. The economy of West Ger
many can now support such an
army, he said. "Germans may be

better off economically than mosl
other European countries."
An influx of Hungarian refu
gees lias complicated West Ger
many's already serious refugee
problem. Thousands of East Ger
mans and people from East Prus
sia and Silesia have been enter
ing West Germany.
"People who are still called
Nazis are only old Nazis who can
I not forget the time when they
were on top profiting from Hit
ler's regime. Hut public opinion
is very aware of nationalism, es
pecially in the youth who will be
! the leaders of the country in a
j few years," he added.
"Nationalism might become a
j danger it the right wing radicals
take 1 lie issue of reunifying East
| and West Germany to advance
their position. Reunification is a
i very hot issue at present," lie
sal. I.
When Dieter returns to Ger
many, and after he receives his
diploma, he wants to work abroad
with one of the newly set up in
ternational authorities, such as
the Administration of the Coal
[and Steel Pool of the Sehuman
! Plan.

tumn to study economics. He pkfhs to work tor an international
