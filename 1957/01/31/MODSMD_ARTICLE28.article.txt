There is something about the thrashing and heaving of the two
scrums i linos), the multiple laterals and brilliant, individually exe
cuted runs of the backfield "rushes" and the pervading spontaneity
of play which give the rugby offense an incomparable flavor.
Rugby offense can be divided into iwo phases: scrum play and
backfield play.
Any of the 30 men in a game can, and often do, carry the hall.
This is a matter of great delight to football linemen who would
never otherwise have the privilege.
However, offensive phiy of the eight-man serum is generally
restricted to participation in formal and loose scrummages and
line-outs.
Formal scrummages are at once football's line of scrimmage
and basket ball's jump ball.
They are the forming of the two scrums after a rule violation
in an attempt to gain possession of Ihe ball which has been tossed
on the ground between them. The scrums can either push the other
loam off the ball or "heel" it to the backs.
These formations afford a good opportunity to name the scrum
members. Formed in an interlocked 3-11 formation are the prop,
hook and prop in the front; the break-away, two second-rankers and
a break-away in the middle row and ;i lock in the back.
Loose scrums are the forming of one or more players from each
team around a ball which is loose on the ground.
IJnc-onts' (basketball's out-of-bounds plays) occur after the ball
has gone out of bounds. The team least responsible for putting it
out is allowed to throw it in, generally to full scrums lined up in
parallel rows perpendicular to the sidelines. Only two players, one
to throw the ball and one to catch it, are required to form a line
out'.
Once the ball is gained by one team or the other, the scrum gen
erally head alter an opposing ballcarrier or follow their offense to
lorm loose scrums should the backs be tackled.
At. any time when action is broken by a line-out or scrummage,
the seven backs align themselves in a formation which generally
strings tliem across the field away from the scrum. This sets' up
the lateral series.
Actually, only four backs Ihe scrum-half, first-five, second-five
and center-Illree-qu;iiters shift with the scrum. One wing-back re
mains on each side of the field as the end man. lie throws Ihe ball,
in for line-outs. The fullback (safety.) is the only primarily defensive
player.
Kicking is as integral a part of the offense as running and
laleraling. Kicks vary from kick-offs to running punts.
Kick-offs are place kicks from mid-field which open both halves
and follow converted goals.
Penalty kicks are awarded against teams for rule violations. If
the kicking team is close enough to attempt a field goal it may do so.
Otherwise, they have the option of kicking the ball in any manner.
Free kicks are allowed for a fair catch. The catcher must per
sonally kick the ball.
A 25-yard drop-out is a drop-kick from behind the 25-yard line
which follows the touching down of Ihe ball by a player in his own
in goal (football's safpty).
Once the ball has been put into play the heart of rugby—the
lateral series—comes into play. Kacli back takes the ball as far
as he can, before being challenged. Then he must lateral to the
next player, punt or fake the tackier. There is little planned of
fense when compared lo American football.
The wing must either make it around the corner or punt the
ball. Judicious punting by any back along the is of more advan
tage than getting the ball out to a hopelessly trapped wing. In any
case punting the ball is better than getting tackled. The tackled ball
carrier in rugby is required to drop or fumble the ball.
Once play begins the activity is constant until the ball goes out
of-bounds, a team scores or a rule is violated. The "advantage rule,"
Which provides that the referee does not blow his whistle until lie
can determine if continued play is really to the advantage of the of
fending team, adds to the flow of the game.
Rugby defense is generally as simple as this: "Tackle the man
and get the ball."
Unfortunately, space limits further description of the game. .You
could do worse during those Saturday afternoon study breaks,
though, than to stroll out to one of the better matches. Any time
UCLA, Cal or the Olympic Club is in the area interesting things will
be going on.
As far as Ihat goes, the JV's can play as spectacular, as spon
taneous, a game. They're all playing the "jolly old sport" for fun.

Any of the 30 men in a game can, and often do, carry the hall.
This is a matter of great delight to football linemen who would
never otherwise have the privilege.
However, offensive phiy of the eight-man serum is generally
restricted to participation in formal and loose scrummages and
line-outs.
Formal scrummages are at once football's line of scrimmage
and basket ball's jump ball.
They are the forming of the two scrums after a rule violation
in an attempt to gain possession of Ihe ball which has been tossed
on the ground between them. The scrums can either push the other
loam off the ball or "heel" it to the backs.
These formations afford a good opportunity to name the scrum
members. Formed in an interlocked 3-11 formation are the prop,
hook and prop in the front; the break-away, two second-rankers and
a break-away in the middle row and ;i lock in the back.
Loose scrums are the forming of one or more players from each
team around a ball which is loose on the ground.
IJnc-onts' (basketball's out-of-bounds plays) occur after the ball
has gone out of bounds. The team least responsible for putting it
out is allowed to throw it in, generally to full scrums lined up in
parallel rows perpendicular to the sidelines. Only two players, one
to throw the ball and one to catch it, are required to form a line
out'.
Once the ball is gained by one team or the other, the scrum gen
erally head alter an opposing ballcarrier or follow their offense to
lorm loose scrums should the backs be tackled.
At. any time when action is broken by a line-out or scrummage,
the seven backs align themselves in a formation which generally
strings tliem across the field away from the scrum. This sets' up
the lateral series.
Actually, only four backs Ihe scrum-half, first-five, second-five
and center-Illree-qu;iiters shift with the scrum. One wing-back re
mains on each side of the field as the end man. lie throws Ihe ball,
in for line-outs. The fullback (safety.) is the only primarily defensive
player.
Kicking is as integral a part of the offense as running and
laleraling. Kicks vary from kick-offs to running punts.
Kick-offs are place kicks from mid-field which open both halves
and follow converted goals.
Penalty kicks are awarded against teams for rule violations. If
the kicking team is close enough to attempt a field goal it may do so.
Otherwise, they have the option of kicking the ball in any manner.
Free kicks are allowed for a fair catch. The catcher must per
sonally kick the ball.
A 25-yard drop-out is a drop-kick from behind the 25-yard line
which follows the touching down of Ihe ball by a player in his own
in goal (football's safpty).
Once the ball has been put into play the heart of rugby—the
lateral series—comes into play. Kacli back takes the ball as far
as he can, before being challenged. Then he must lateral to the
next player, punt or fake the tackier. There is little planned of
fense when compared lo American football.
The wing must either make it around the corner or punt the
ball. Judicious punting by any back along the is of more advan
tage than getting the ball out to a hopelessly trapped wing. In any
case punting the ball is better than getting tackled. The tackled ball
carrier in rugby is required to drop or fumble the ball.
Once play begins the activity is constant until the ball goes out
of-bounds, a team scores or a rule is violated. The "advantage rule,"
Which provides that the referee does not blow his whistle until lie
can determine if continued play is really to the advantage of the of
fending team, adds to the flow of the game.
Rugby defense is generally as simple as this: "Tackle the man
and get the ball."
Unfortunately, space limits further description of the game. .You
could do worse during those Saturday afternoon study breaks,
though, than to stroll out to one of the better matches. Any time
UCLA, Cal or the Olympic Club is in the area interesting things will
be going on.
As far as Ihat goes, the JV's can play as spectacular, as spon
taneous, a game. They're all playing the "jolly old sport" for fun.
There is something about the thrashing and heaving of the two
scrums i linos), the multiple laterals and brilliant, individually exe
cuted runs of the backfield "rushes" and the pervading spontaneity
of play which give the rugby offense an incomparable flavor.

Formal scrummages are at once football's line of scrimmage
and basket ball's jump ball.
They are the forming of the two scrums after a rule violation
in an attempt to gain possession of Ihe ball which has been tossed
on the ground between them. The scrums can either push the other
loam off the ball or "heel" it to the backs.
These formations afford a good opportunity to name the scrum
members. Formed in an interlocked 3-11 formation are the prop,
hook and prop in the front; the break-away, two second-rankers and
a break-away in the middle row and ;i lock in the back.
Loose scrums are the forming of one or more players from each
team around a ball which is loose on the ground.
IJnc-onts' (basketball's out-of-bounds plays) occur after the ball
has gone out of bounds. The team least responsible for putting it
out is allowed to throw it in, generally to full scrums lined up in
parallel rows perpendicular to the sidelines. Only two players, one
to throw the ball and one to catch it, are required to form a line
out'.
Once the ball is gained by one team or the other, the scrum gen
erally head alter an opposing ballcarrier or follow their offense to
lorm loose scrums should the backs be tackled.
At. any time when action is broken by a line-out or scrummage,
the seven backs align themselves in a formation which generally
strings tliem across the field away from the scrum. This sets' up
the lateral series.
Actually, only four backs Ihe scrum-half, first-five, second-five
and center-Illree-qu;iiters shift with the scrum. One wing-back re
mains on each side of the field as the end man. lie throws Ihe ball,
in for line-outs. The fullback (safety.) is the only primarily defensive
player.
Kicking is as integral a part of the offense as running and
laleraling. Kicks vary from kick-offs to running punts.
Kick-offs are place kicks from mid-field which open both halves
and follow converted goals.
Penalty kicks are awarded against teams for rule violations. If
the kicking team is close enough to attempt a field goal it may do so.
Otherwise, they have the option of kicking the ball in any manner.
Free kicks are allowed for a fair catch. The catcher must per
sonally kick the ball.
A 25-yard drop-out is a drop-kick from behind the 25-yard line
which follows the touching down of Ihe ball by a player in his own
in goal (football's safpty).
Once the ball has been put into play the heart of rugby—the
lateral series—comes into play. Kacli back takes the ball as far
as he can, before being challenged. Then he must lateral to the
next player, punt or fake the tackier. There is little planned of
fense when compared lo American football.
The wing must either make it around the corner or punt the
ball. Judicious punting by any back along the is of more advan
tage than getting the ball out to a hopelessly trapped wing. In any
case punting the ball is better than getting tackled. The tackled ball
carrier in rugby is required to drop or fumble the ball.
Once play begins the activity is constant until the ball goes out
of-bounds, a team scores or a rule is violated. The "advantage rule,"
Which provides that the referee does not blow his whistle until lie
can determine if continued play is really to the advantage of the of
fending team, adds to the flow of the game.
Rugby defense is generally as simple as this: "Tackle the man
and get the ball."
Unfortunately, space limits further description of the game. .You
could do worse during those Saturday afternoon study breaks,
though, than to stroll out to one of the better matches. Any time
UCLA, Cal or the Olympic Club is in the area interesting things will
be going on.
As far as Ihat goes, the JV's can play as spectacular, as spon
taneous, a game. They're all playing the "jolly old sport" for fun.
There is something about the thrashing and heaving of the two
scrums i linos), the multiple laterals and brilliant, individually exe
cuted runs of the backfield "rushes" and the pervading spontaneity
of play which give the rugby offense an incomparable flavor.
Rugby offense can be divided into iwo phases: scrum play and
backfield play.
Any of the 30 men in a game can, and often do, carry the hall.
This is a matter of great delight to football linemen who would
never otherwise have the privilege.
