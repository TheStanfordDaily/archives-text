# Franklin, Duffy Chief Oregon Treats for Invading Indians
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Charlie Franklin and Hal Duffy
will be the big problems confront
ing Stanford when the Indians
meet Oregon in a two-game set
this weekend in Eugene.
Both men are in their second
year of full-time play, although
each is only a junior. Oddly
enough Franklin and Bill Bond,
the Indians' top scorer, have each
scored 108 points in six games.
Their 18.0 average is good
enough to deadlock for sixth
place in PCC rankings.
Duffy, the Ducks' G-6 center
and tallest man on the squad, has
averaged 12.2 points in each of
his six games. Duffy's biggest
asset is rebounding ability. He
has pulled down 75 rebounds in
PCC play to rank third in the con
ference.
Franklin, although standing
just G-3, has grabbed G3 rebounds,
making him the PCC's best
"short man" under the boards.
Tribe Coach Howie Dallmar has
thus far given no indication as to
how he will attempt to contain
the two big threats, naturally pre
ferring to keep his strategy se
cret.
Despite their dismal l-f> record,
Oregon has shown definite signs
of improvement, particularly in
Tuesday night's G4-G3 non-confer
ence loss to the powerful Wash
ington Huskies. The Ducks' only
PCC win was over Idaho, but

they gave good competition 1o
both Cal and Washington State
before losing a pair of games to
each.
This will probably lÂ»e the only
series in which Stanford can
boast a starting line-up nearly as
tall as iheir opponents. Center
Carl Isaacs is two inches shorter
than Duffy, but forward Dick
Haga has an inch advantage over
Franklin.
Bond is three inches shorter
than Bill Moore, the Ducks' other
regular forward. Stanford guards
Paul Neumann and Hap Wagner
are each slightly taller than Bud
Kuykendall and Wimp Hastings,
the probable starters for Oregon.
Stanford's only possible line-up
change is at one guard spot,
where Neumann is still resting a
bad ankle. He sustained the in
jury against Washington, but
played the foil o wing week
against Cal.
