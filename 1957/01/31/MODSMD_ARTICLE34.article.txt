# What a MATHEMATICIAN can do at IBM
## 
### 
Mathematics is an ancient but ever-advancing science that contains many
forms. It shouldn't surprise you then that it took some time before John
Jackson discovered the one brand of mathematics that seemed custom
tailored to his ability and temperament. John is an Applied Science Repre
sentative, working out of the IBM office at 122 East 42nd Street, N. Y. C.

First of all, what's it all about? What
does a fellow like John Jackson do
all day? In his own words, "I keep
in touch with the executives of many
different companies—advising them
on the use of their IBM electronic
data processing computers. I person
ally consult with these customers,
and analyze their scientific and tech
nical problems for solution by IBM.
Occasionally, I'm asked to write
papers, and give talks and demon
strations on electronic computing.
All in all, it's pretty fascinating . . .
something new pops up every day."
In other words, John is a full-fledged
computing expert, a consultant . . .
and a very important person in this

coining age of automation through
electronics.
Since the IBM laboratories are
always devising easier and faster ways
to solve the problems of science, gov
ernment, and industry, an Applied
Science Representative can never say
he's learned his job and that's the
end of it. At least once every two
months, he attends seminars to be
updated on the latest developments in
engineering and operations research.
Introduces new methods
During the two years that John
has spent with IBM in Applied Sci
ence, he has guided innumerable IBM
customers to new and better ways of
doing things electronically. For ex
ample: about a year ago, a leading
aircraft manufacturer wanted to ex
periment with a radically different
design for a nuclear reactor. Although
the basic format had been established,
the project still required many monl hs
of toil with mathematical equations.

The aircraft people decided that they
couldn't afford to wait that long, so
they called in IBM. After discussion
with top executives, John helped to
map out a computer program that
saved the organization over 100 days

of pencil-chewing, nail-biting arith
metic. Later, for this same company,
John organized the establishment of
computer systems fop aircraft per
formance predictions ... for data
reduction of wind tunnel tests ... and
for wing stress analysis. At the same
time, he worked with this company's
own employees, training them in the
use of IBM equipment. John still
drops around to see that everything
is running smoothly.
Another service that John performs
is the constant reappraisal of each
customer's IBM operation. Occasion
ally, a customer may tie himself in
knots over a procedural "stickler."
Periodically, in fact, John brings
IBM customers together . . . just to
talk over what's happening in each
other's business—how everybody else
handled that old bugaboo in any
industry ... details.
New field for Mathematicians
John is exercising his mathematical
know-how in a field that was prac
tically unheard of ten years ago. Even
now, this kind of work may be news
to you. It was to John Jackson a few
years back when he was an under
graduate at the University of Colo
rado. At that time, he was considering
actuarial work or mathematical re
search. But John liked the excitement
and diversification of science and in
dustry and he wanted to use his

mathematical background in both of
those areas. It was not until he was
interviewed by IBM that field com
puting whetted his scientific appetite.
A few months later, John launched
his own IBM career as an Applied
Science trainee.
Promotionwise, John has come a
long way since that time. He's now
an Applied Science Representative in
one of the busiest, most responsible
offices in the IBM organization . . .
mid-town Manhattan.
With his wife, Katherine, and
daughter. Lisa, 20 months, and John,

Jr., 6 weeks, he enjoys his suburban
Port Washington home. He's happy
and he's satisfied. And then, too, John
knows a few vital statistics about
IBM . . . such as the fact that the
Applied Science Division has quad
rupled during the past three years,
and that in 1956 alone, over 70 pro
motions were conferred. If ever a
future held promise, here is one.

IBM hopes that this message will help
to give you some idea of what a mathe
matician can do at IBM. There are equal
opportunities for E.E.'s, M.E.'s, physi
cists and Liberal Arts majors in IBM's
many divisions—Research, Product De
velopment, Manufacturing Engineering,
Sales and Technical Services. Why not
drop in and discuss IBM with your Place
ment Director? He can supply our latest
brochure and tell you when IBM will
next interview on your campus. Mean
while, IBM will be happy to answer your
questions. Just write to Mr. P. H. Bradley,
