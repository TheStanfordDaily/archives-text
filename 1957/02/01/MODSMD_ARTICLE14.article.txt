# 'Twelfth Night’ Enjoyable, Professionally Acted Comedy
## Production Similar to Elizabethan Style; Set Makes All Action Close to Audience 
### Dick Lee 
Stanford Players' presentation of "Twelfth Night'' was highly en
joyable Shakespearean comedy excellently cast and professionally
produced.
Too often today Shakespeare is given the Orson Welles treatment,
every line delivered as if it were a maxim of wisdom 01 a prophecy

of doom. Or the comedy is a poor
imitation of bad slapstick.
Director F. Cowles Strickland
has chosen a more satisfying for
mula. "Twelfth Night" is pre
sented in a manner similar to an
original Elizabethan production.
The comedy is low. but tongue-in
cheek; and everywhere is fantasy.
Settings, lighting and costumes
all aid the fantasy. William Alli
son designed a set that utilizes
the area over the orchestra pit as
well as the regular stage.
As a result, the action of the
play is considerably closer to the
audience and much freer than is
normally possible. High scal
loped arches and side panels mer
cifully hide much of Memorial
Hall.
Nancy I'owlkes If!
Unintentionally, one circum
stance adds to the fantasy. Be
cause oj illness, Shirley Douglass
appeared as Viola in place of
Nancy Fowlkes. Though she had
to use a script during the second |
act, Miss Douglass gave a highly
competent and enjoyable per-1
forma nee.
In a comedy the audience
wishes to he entertained. "Twelfth
Night" has many good comic
roles, all of which were well
played last night. Top honors for
exceptional entertainment go to
David O'Brien as Feste and
Speech and Drama Professor
Robert Loper as Malvolio.
O'Brien's Feste is, willy, charm
inc. exceedingly graceful and al
ways enjoyable. He is equally
worthy in a verbal battle with his
mistress Olivia or in a drunken
soiree with Sir Toby Belch and
Sir Andrew Aguecheek As spe
cial fare. O'Brien sings three old
English ballads as part of the in
cidental music.
I.oper (wives Coiitinsl
Robert Loper, playing the vain,
overbearing steward Malvolio,
furnishes the necesary contrast
Id (he continuing revelry. But of
course, his very manner occasions
his downfall. Loper fully under
stands the conceited and egocen
trie nature of Malvolio, and con
sequent ly furnishes one ol the
best characterizations seen on the
Stanford stage.
But what should have been ten ■
der love scenes were only embar
rassing and uninteresting. The
play lacked a general charm in
addition to its prominent com
edy. Perhaps if the incidental
music, arranged or created by Kr
ich Kclnvandt, had been more pre
cise and more positive, some of
the original enchantment would!
have remained to the final bow.

Stanford Players' presentation of "Twelfth Night'' was highly en
joyable Shakespearean comedy excellently cast and professionally
produced.
Too often today Shakespeare is given the Orson Welles treatment,
every line delivered as if it were a maxim of wisdom 01 a prophecy

of doom. Or the comedy is a poor
imitation of bad slapstick.
Director F. Cowles Strickland
has chosen a more satisfying for
mula. "Twelfth Night" is pre
sented in a manner similar to an
original Elizabethan production.
The comedy is low. but tongue-in
cheek; and everywhere is fantasy.
Settings, lighting and costumes
all aid the fantasy. William Alli
son designed a set that utilizes
the area over the orchestra pit as
well as the regular stage.
As a result, the action of the
play is considerably closer to the
audience and much freer than is
normally possible. High scal
loped arches and side panels mer
cifully hide much of Memorial
Hall.
Nancy I'owlkes If!
Unintentionally, one circum
stance adds to the fantasy. Be
cause oj illness, Shirley Douglass
appeared as Viola in place of
Nancy Fowlkes. Though she had
to use a script during the second |
act, Miss Douglass gave a highly
competent and enjoyable per-1
forma nee.
In a comedy the audience
wishes to he entertained. "Twelfth
Night" has many good comic
roles, all of which were well
played last night. Top honors for
exceptional entertainment go to
David O'Brien as Feste and
Speech and Drama Professor
Robert Loper as Malvolio.
O'Brien's Feste is, willy, charm
inc. exceedingly graceful and al
ways enjoyable. He is equally
worthy in a verbal battle with his
mistress Olivia or in a drunken
soiree with Sir Toby Belch and
Sir Andrew Aguecheek As spe
cial fare. O'Brien sings three old
English ballads as part of the in
cidental music.
I.oper (wives Coiitinsl
Robert Loper, playing the vain,
overbearing steward Malvolio,
furnishes the necesary contrast
Id (he continuing revelry. But of
course, his very manner occasions
his downfall. Loper fully under
stands the conceited and egocen
trie nature of Malvolio, and con
sequent ly furnishes one ol the
best characterizations seen on the
Stanford stage.
But what should have been ten ■
der love scenes were only embar
rassing and uninteresting. The
play lacked a general charm in
addition to its prominent com
edy. Perhaps if the incidental
music, arranged or created by Kr
ich Kclnvandt, had been more pre
cise and more positive, some of
the original enchantment would!
have remained to the final bow.
