A\ TDITOR's LAST F.DITOKIAL is the most difficult
to write. There is so much to say, so many
aspirations ami dreams for the perfection of
The Daily ami the community it serves, that
the final words come out as a mixture of nos
talgia and hope.
Because of my faith in the potentiality of
The Daily and every individual who has con
tributed to its pages, this editorial is dedicated
to the staff.
Dave, you, as editor, have been elected to a
position of responsibility ami influence of al
nvjt unlimited extent, llse the responsibility
with great care and the influence with great
determination.
You have seen the successes and failures of
Volume 130 of The Daily, and you can benefit
by them.
As editor of a newspaper that is independent
in fact and spirit, you must justify its inde
pendence by speaking out clearly and emphati
cally on issues that demand attention, by in
terpreting the news in line with your best judg
ment and by maintaining your high ideals of
what is best for The Daily and for its readers.
Although you and the rest of the editorial
board guide the policies of the paper and give
it your editorial interpretation, your job is not
a lonely or solitary one. You have an audience

that deserves and wants stimulation; you have
a staff that can give it to them.
Kverv one of von —from editor to reporter —
has found that, in giving of your time and
talents, you have gained a valuable asset in the
art of self-expression, an attainment which will
accompany vou all vour life.
You have learned to work in a spirit of
friendly cooperation necessary to the success
of any effort. From your contacts on and off
The Daily, yon have gained friends you will
never lose.
Vou have learned about your university from
a perspective few others have. You see it as
an organized whole —a faculty and adminis
tration attempting to educate youth so that
they will not make the same mistakes their
elders did; a student body frustrating in their
apathetic attitudes, hut nevertheless genuinely
eager to become an educated and healthy
society.
The Daily, in its news and editorial columns,
is a reflection of the vitality, eagerness and
idealism of every person who works on the
paper. The whole theme of the paper is faith
—an idealistic view that the day-by-day pres
entation of news and thoughts will make each
person more aware of the world lie lives in
and the part he plays in the drama that is life.
Best of luck to the staff of Volume 131.
