Carran â€¢ Waller Immigration Act

lor legislation giving permanent
residence to as many as 15,000
Hungarian refugees now here on
"parole" status. Congress could
deny the privilege in individual

request, Eisenhower called for an
overhaul of the so-called national
origins immigration "quota sys

law, would admit 05,000 more im
migrants a year on a permanent
basis. The present ceiling of 154,-

210.000.
Bills to carry out Eisenhower's
program were introduced immedi
ately by Reps. Patrick J. Hillings
i R-Calif.) and Kenneth B. Keating
(R-N.Y.). Hillings said the pro
gram would admit as many as
200,000 more immigrants a year.
