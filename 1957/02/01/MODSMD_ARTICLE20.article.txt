# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Should Communist China Be Recognized? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
Every time the question of Red China is raised,
the air is charged with political tensions. To most
Americans any question of Red China has already
been settled and is no longer a valid discussion
topic.
But is this really the case?
The United States has never extended recog
nition in any form to the de facto government in
the mainland area of the nation known as China.
This country says the de jure government in
Formosa, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist govern
ment, is the de jure government of the whole
couutry and also the de facto government of the
whole country. We seem to have forgotten the
meaning of the term "de facto."
No Recognition ... No Contact
Non-recognition of a government in any form
positively implies non-intercourse with a govern
ment in any form. But we have had intercourse
with representatives of the Red Chinese govern
ment. Not directly, it is pointed out, but inter
course nevertheless.
We have bargained with Mao Tse-tung's gov
ernment over the release of Americans impris
oned in China. We have talked to its representa
tives over the truce table in Panmunjom. The
latter intercourse was direct.
By bargaining with representatives of a coun
try. we are in fact bargaining with the govern
ment of that country. And if we bargain with a
government, we are implying that that govern
ment is competent to deal with the problems over
which we are bargaining. If we imply this, why
don't we admit it?
Logical Inconsistency
There seems to be some inconsistency in the
logic our government uses. But perhaps our gov
ernment is not run on logic. Perhaps emotional
considerations take precedence over logical proc
esses. Perhaps? There is no doubt on that.
When a subject of controversy comes up be
fore two people who are not on speaking terms,
it can be settled—but seldom without a fight.
When they can speak together, regardless of how
much they hate each other, the controversy can
usually be settled without a fight—provided both
realize it's to their benefit to do so.
If it's morally wrong for the United States to
recognize Red China, it is also morally wrong for
Great Britain. France, India or any other country
to recognize Red China. Are we the only nation
in the world with moral values in our foreign
policy? Or is it more likely true that we have
tried to make a moral issue over the recognition
of Red China when in reality it is not a question
of morality?
Lob jies and Pressure Groups
Perhaps morality is being used to hide some
more basic reason why the government feels Red
China should not be recognized. There are strong
lobbies and pressure groups in Washington cry
ing out against any recognition of that govern
ment.
We do not have to approve of a government
to recognize it. There is no implictaion of such
a thing. Look at the countries we recognize now
that we do not approve of. In fact, we definitely
should not approve of the government. This is
the difference between de facto and de jure
recognition.
The benefits of reco \ ion could be numerous,
in the economic fie 1 1 e , dally. The benefits of
non-recognition—are they really benefits?

This week Henry Ford II told the press he
favored a policy of trade with Red China. Once
again the often-debated topic of United States
diplomatic relations with the Communistsnon
grata had cropped into the headlines and the con
versations of our nation.
While Ford's interests can be said to be purely
commercial, the problem entails much more than
a mere dollars-and-cents consideration.
For the nearly nine years since the Commu
nists sent the Nationalists fleeing 1o Formosa,
America has staunchly refused to recognize the
legal existence of a country which is very much
in physical existence — with a population ap
proaching 600 million and a land area one-third
larger than continental United States.
The principle underlying our diplomatic posi
tion can be simply stated: We will not accord a
position of respectable legal standing to a gov
ernment run by insurgents who have demon
strated no recognition of the fundamental decen
cies, of respect of the rights of their neighbors
and of responsibility 1o the precepts of world
law and order.
No Responsible Government
What these words mean is, Red China has no
responsible government, no respectable govern
ment and thus no government worthy of equal
sovereign treatment with the nations of the
world.
How do wo arrive at this damning conclusion?
It is based on the experience of nine years of
observation—a witnessing of moral, ethical and
political sodomy committed in defiance of inter
national law.
Men like Ford ask why not face up to the
reality of physical existence—why not stop pre
tending there is no Red China and face facts?
And men like Senator William Knowland an
swer back that there is nothing any more real
than the deplorable consequences which would
come from according any kind of recognition to
the country.
Moral and Ethical Conclusions
These consequences can be stated in terms of
moral and ethical conclusions from what has
been said above, but more immediately important
are the political considerations:
• Recognition would give Red China equal
bargaining status with the leading powers of the
world at conference tables, in the United Nations
and elsewhere, adding to the strength of the
Comrhunist bloc generally and contributing to
the blockade of responsible decision-making at
the international forums.
• Recognition would enable Red China to ex
pand economically by increased trade opportuni
ties and to exert its influence to the detriment
of world peace over a greater sphere than it now
does.
• The United States would lose the friendship
of the Chinese Nationalists, and would lose the
prestige it ha:? built with the many enemies of
Red China.
• Communism generally would gain an im
portant foothold in the Cold War, and the Free
World would lose one with no compensation for
the concession.
There may come a time when it will be no
longer politically expedient, to refuse recognition
to Red China, but that time is not now, when
the balance of the Cold War is more delicate
than ever in the Middle East.
And even when that time comes, all persons
of moral integrity will have to decide if they will
sacrifice their principles on the altar of inter
national diplomacy.

it can be settled—but seldom without a fight.
When they can speak together, regardless of how
much they hate each other, the controversy can
usually be settled without a fight—provided both
realize it's to their benefit to do so.
If it's morally wrong for the United States to
recognize Red China, it is also morally wrong for
Great Britain. France, India or any other country
to recognize Red China. Are we the only nation
in the world with moral values in our foreign
policy? Or is it more likely true that we have
tried to make a moral issue over the recognition
of Red China when in reality it is not a question
of morality?
Lob jies and Pressure Groups
Perhaps morality is being used to hide some
more basic reason why the government feels Red
China should not be recognized. There are strong
lobbies and pressure groups in Washington cry
ing out against any recognition of that govern
ment.
We do not have to approve of a government
to recognize it. There is no implictaion of such
a thing. Look at the countries we recognize now
that we do not approve of. In fact, we definitely
should not approve of the government. This is
the difference between de facto and de jure
recognition.
The benefits of reco \ ion could be numerous,
in the economic fie 1 1 e , dally. The benefits of
non-recognition—are they really benefits?

This week Henry Ford II told the press he
favored a policy of trade with Red China. Once
again the often-debated topic of United States
diplomatic relations with the Communistsnon
grata had cropped into the headlines and the con
versations of our nation.
While Ford's interests can be said to be purely
commercial, the problem entails much more than
a mere dollars-and-cents consideration.
For the nearly nine years since the Commu
nists sent the Nationalists fleeing 1o Formosa,
America has staunchly refused to recognize the
legal existence of a country which is very much
in physical existence — with a population ap
proaching 600 million and a land area one-third
larger than continental United States.
The principle underlying our diplomatic posi
tion can be simply stated: We will not accord a
position of respectable legal standing to a gov
ernment run by insurgents who have demon
strated no recognition of the fundamental decen
cies, of respect of the rights of their neighbors
and of responsibility 1o the precepts of world
law and order.
No Responsible Government
What these words mean is, Red China has no
responsible government, no respectable govern
ment and thus no government worthy of equal
sovereign treatment with the nations of the
world.
How do wo arrive at this damning conclusion?
It is based on the experience of nine years of
observation—a witnessing of moral, ethical and
political sodomy committed in defiance of inter
national law.
Men like Ford ask why not face up to the
reality of physical existence—why not stop pre
tending there is no Red China and face facts?
And men like Senator William Knowland an
swer back that there is nothing any more real
than the deplorable consequences which would
come from according any kind of recognition to
the country.
Moral and Ethical Conclusions
These consequences can be stated in terms of
moral and ethical conclusions from what has
been said above, but more immediately important
are the political considerations:
• Recognition would give Red China equal
bargaining status with the leading powers of the
world at conference tables, in the United Nations
and elsewhere, adding to the strength of the
Comrhunist bloc generally and contributing to
the blockade of responsible decision-making at
the international forums.
• Recognition would enable Red China to ex
pand economically by increased trade opportuni
ties and to exert its influence to the detriment
of world peace over a greater sphere than it now
does.
• The United States would lose the friendship
of the Chinese Nationalists, and would lose the
prestige it ha:? built with the many enemies of
Red China.
• Communism generally would gain an im
portant foothold in the Cold War, and the Free
World would lose one with no compensation for
the concession.
There may come a time when it will be no
longer politically expedient, to refuse recognition
to Red China, but that time is not now, when
the balance of the Cold War is more delicate
than ever in the Middle East.
And even when that time comes, all persons
of moral integrity will have to decide if they will
sacrifice their principles on the altar of inter
national diplomacy.
Every time the question of Red China is raised,
the air is charged with political tensions. To most
Americans any question of Red China has already
been settled and is no longer a valid discussion
topic.
But is this really the case?
The United States has never extended recog
nition in any form to the de facto government in
the mainland area of the nation known as China.
This country says the de jure government in
Formosa, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist govern
ment, is the de jure government of the whole
couutry and also the de facto government of the
whole country. We seem to have forgotten the
meaning of the term "de facto."
No Recognition ... No Contact
Non-recognition of a government in any form
positively implies non-intercourse with a govern
ment in any form. But we have had intercourse
with representatives of the Red Chinese govern
ment. Not directly, it is pointed out, but inter
course nevertheless.
We have bargained with Mao Tse-tung's gov
ernment over the release of Americans impris
oned in China. We have talked to its representa
tives over the truce table in Panmunjom. The
latter intercourse was direct.
By bargaining with representatives of a coun
try. we are in fact bargaining with the govern
ment of that country. And if we bargain with a
government, we are implying that that govern
ment is competent to deal with the problems over
which we are bargaining. If we imply this, why
don't we admit it?
Logical Inconsistency
There seems to be some inconsistency in the
logic our government uses. But perhaps our gov
ernment is not run on logic. Perhaps emotional
considerations take precedence over logical proc
esses. Perhaps? There is no doubt on that.
When a subject of controversy comes up be

commercial, the problem entails much more than
a mere dollars-and-cents consideration.
For the nearly nine years since the Commu
nists sent the Nationalists fleeing 1o Formosa,
America has staunchly refused to recognize the
legal existence of a country which is very much
in physical existence — with a population ap
proaching 600 million and a land area one-third
larger than continental United States.
The principle underlying our diplomatic posi
tion can be simply stated: We will not accord a
position of respectable legal standing to a gov
ernment run by insurgents who have demon
strated no recognition of the fundamental decen
cies, of respect of the rights of their neighbors
and of responsibility 1o the precepts of world
law and order.
No Responsible Government
What these words mean is, Red China has no
responsible government, no respectable govern
ment and thus no government worthy of equal
sovereign treatment with the nations of the
world.
How do wo arrive at this damning conclusion?
It is based on the experience of nine years of
observation—a witnessing of moral, ethical and
political sodomy committed in defiance of inter
national law.
Men like Ford ask why not face up to the
reality of physical existence—why not stop pre
tending there is no Red China and face facts?
And men like Senator William Knowland an
swer back that there is nothing any more real
than the deplorable consequences which would
come from according any kind of recognition to
the country.
Moral and Ethical Conclusions
These consequences can be stated in terms of
moral and ethical conclusions from what has
been said above, but more immediately important
are the political considerations:
• Recognition would give Red China equal
bargaining status with the leading powers of the
world at conference tables, in the United Nations
and elsewhere, adding to the strength of the
Comrhunist bloc generally and contributing to
the blockade of responsible decision-making at
the international forums.
• Recognition would enable Red China to ex
pand economically by increased trade opportuni
ties and to exert its influence to the detriment
of world peace over a greater sphere than it now
does.
• The United States would lose the friendship
of the Chinese Nationalists, and would lose the
prestige it ha:? built with the many enemies of
Red China.
• Communism generally would gain an im
portant foothold in the Cold War, and the Free
World would lose one with no compensation for
the concession.
There may come a time when it will be no
longer politically expedient, to refuse recognition
to Red China, but that time is not now, when
the balance of the Cold War is more delicate
than ever in the Middle East.
And even when that time comes, all persons
of moral integrity will have to decide if they will
sacrifice their principles on the altar of inter
national diplomacy.
Every time the question of Red China is raised,
the air is charged with political tensions. To most
Americans any question of Red China has already
been settled and is no longer a valid discussion
topic.
But is this really the case?
The United States has never extended recog
nition in any form to the de facto government in
the mainland area of the nation known as China.
This country says the de jure government in
Formosa, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist govern
ment, is the de jure government of the whole
couutry and also the de facto government of the
whole country. We seem to have forgotten the
meaning of the term "de facto."
No Recognition ... No Contact
Non-recognition of a government in any form
positively implies non-intercourse with a govern
ment in any form. But we have had intercourse
with representatives of the Red Chinese govern
ment. Not directly, it is pointed out, but inter
course nevertheless.
We have bargained with Mao Tse-tung's gov
ernment over the release of Americans impris
oned in China. We have talked to its representa
tives over the truce table in Panmunjom. The
latter intercourse was direct.
By bargaining with representatives of a coun
try. we are in fact bargaining with the govern
ment of that country. And if we bargain with a
government, we are implying that that govern
ment is competent to deal with the problems over
which we are bargaining. If we imply this, why
don't we admit it?
Logical Inconsistency
There seems to be some inconsistency in the
logic our government uses. But perhaps our gov
ernment is not run on logic. Perhaps emotional
considerations take precedence over logical proc
esses. Perhaps? There is no doubt on that.
When a subject of controversy comes up be
fore two people who are not on speaking terms,
it can be settled—but seldom without a fight.
When they can speak together, regardless of how
much they hate each other, the controversy can
usually be settled without a fight—provided both
realize it's to their benefit to do so.
If it's morally wrong for the United States to
recognize Red China, it is also morally wrong for
Great Britain. France, India or any other country
to recognize Red China. Are we the only nation
in the world with moral values in our foreign
policy? Or is it more likely true that we have
tried to make a moral issue over the recognition
of Red China when in reality it is not a question
of morality?
Lob jies and Pressure Groups
Perhaps morality is being used to hide some
more basic reason why the government feels Red
China should not be recognized. There are strong
lobbies and pressure groups in Washington cry
ing out against any recognition of that govern
ment.
We do not have to approve of a government
to recognize it. There is no implictaion of such
a thing. Look at the countries we recognize now
that we do not approve of. In fact, we definitely
should not approve of the government. This is
the difference between de facto and de jure
recognition.
The benefits of reco \ ion could be numerous,
in the economic fie 1 1 e , dally. The benefits of
non-recognition—are they really benefits?

This week Henry Ford II told the press he
favored a policy of trade with Red China. Once

diplomatic relations with the Communistsnon

• Recognition would enable Red China to ex
pand economically by increased trade opportuni
ties and to exert its influence to the detriment
of world peace over a greater sphere than it now

• The United States would lose the friendship
of the Chinese Nationalists, and would lose the
prestige it ha:? built with the many enemies of
Red China.

World would lose one with no compensation for
the concession.

longer politically expedient, to refuse recognition
to Red China, but that time is not now, when
the balance of the Cold War is more delicate
than ever in the Middle East.
And even when that time comes, all persons
of moral integrity will have to decide if they will
sacrifice their principles on the altar of inter
national diplomacy.
