# Carillonneur—One Stanford Musician Who Plays Weekly, Yet Never Rehearses
## Mullen First Stanford Student to Perform On Tower Keyboard 
### Rich Brown 
While practice is considered a
must for most musicians, there is
one Stanford musician who per
forms every week for an audience
of several thousand, yet he
spends not one second in rehear
sal.
This is Stanford carillonneur
John F. Mullen, 19-year-old sopho
more majoring in physics. Mul
len can't afford the luxury of
striking even one hlue note when
he plays the Hoover Tower caril
lon, for the whole University com
munity would know immediately.
Mullen said he will not oppose
anyone who wants to donate a
practice set of bell levers a set
connected to a xylophone irather
than far-sounding bells.
Regular Performance
Stanford's carillonneur per
forms regularly on Sundays be
fore and after church services
and for special occasions. One of
his spe c i a 1 concerts was for
Prince Albert of Belgian, who vis
ited Hoover Library last year.
It was in Prince Albert's coun
try that the bells were cast. They
were first used in the Belgian Pa
vilion al the New York World's
Fair in 1939 and 19-10. The caril
lon was presented to Stanford in
1940 in honor of Herbert Hoover
by the Belgian American Educa
tional Foundation.
Mullen is Stanford's first stu
dent carillonneur. He became in
terested in the instrument al San
Francisco's Grace Cathedral, and
last summer studied at Univer
sity of Chicago under James R.
Lawson, a former carillonneur at
Stanford.
35 Bells
Mullen operates the 35 bells
with a range of three octaves
from a clavier on the 13th floor.
The clavier is a series of levers
and foot pedals arranged like a
piano keyboard, as far as while
and black notes are concerned.
The difference is the wooden
levers are larger than ivory keys,
and Mullen usually plays them
with his clenched fist. It is pos
sible for him to strike six notes
simultaneously—two with each
hand and one apiece with his feet.
Level's and pedals are con
nected by wires to clappers in
side the bells. Just so he can hear
what's going on, Mullen opens a
trap door between the 131 hand
observation floors.
Drum Device
In addition to the clavier, a
large drum apparatus, like thai
of a music box, can ring the bells
by a separate set of hammers.
This automatic device was in
tended for use at the New York
fair and is no longer operated.
At the time of its installation
in 1941, the carillon was valued at
$100,000. At its Hoover Tower
dedication it was played by K;i
miel Lefevere, who now presides
over the world's largest (74 bells)
carillon at New York's Riverside
Church.
Some carillons are operated by
piano keyboards in which the
keys control electrically-operatcd
clappers, but the player has no
control over the volume.
The largest of the bells in Hoo
ver Tower has a Latin inscription
which fits in with the purpose of
Hoover Library— to preserve his
torical materials which will be
helpful in bringing about peace
ful solutions to international
problems.
As translated, the inscription
reads:
Because I am called Leopold
the Royal
For Peace alone do I ring
Over the waves of the Atlantic.
