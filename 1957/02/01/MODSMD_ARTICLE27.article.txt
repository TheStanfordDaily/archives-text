# Looking It Over

Willi Jerry Kelly
It's lime for a change.
This over-used saying has been applied on many occasions this
decade in politics, in the collegiate coaching ranks and in ihe Pacific
Foast Conference meetings, to name a few.
Tomorrow marks another change a change from Volume 130 to
Volume 131 of The Stanford Daily and with it a change of sports
editors. Dean Stewart, a veteran Air Force flier-turned-journalist,
lakes over Ihe reins for the second half of the school year.
As a swan song, it was suggested to sing the blues. But, then,
that wouldn't do. Looking it fiver, hasn't the athletic program ;tt
Stanford provided for the students exactly what it set out to do?
Has it not given all a chance to participate in or witness exciting
compel it ion?
Who can say the Oregon State, UCLA and California football
games didn't generate the utmost in excitement and interest? Yet
we lost. The important thing is not always the winning, but rather
performing to the best.
There has been plenty to cheer about. There wasn't a football
game played this season that wasn't jam-packed with good, hard
play. Our basketball team, too, has surprised all with its come-from.-
behind performances against strong competition.
In Volume 130 stories were included of a Southern "crusade"
and a subsequent Stanford football victory over the Trojans of South
ern (California, 27-19; stories of heartbreaking grid defeats via the
extra point route; stories of All-America notice to quarterback John
IJrodie, tackle Paul Wiggin and halfback Paul Camera.
This was the year Pay ton Jordan look first notice on campus
first with his autumn quarter track meels, then with his trip to the
Olympic (lames in Melbourne, Australia.
Basketball hogged the limelight in December and no one can take
it away from Coach Howie Dallmar and his hustling cagers. Before
Christmas the big news was an upset over R?ce Institute, one of the
powerhouses of the Southwest Conference. Swinging into PCC action,
Ihe basketball quintet gave students something to cheer about in
knocking olf Oregon Stale and Washington, the tall timber of ihe
Northwest.
People enjoy athletics beeai:"« it is competitive, and the closer
the outcome the better the competition A.s in football, there is con
solation in losing if a real effort is expended. In losing to California,
Connecticut, Tennessee, Washington and Oregon State, among others,
Stanford's cagers put on a real exhibition.
What will Dean Stewart and his sports staff have to write about?
The Indian cagers continue PCC action until March St. Before that
date, no one can count Dallmar and his squad out. Then Payton
Jordan, Dutch Fehring , Eud Finger, Lou Lindsey, Tom Ilaynie and
Bob Itenker take over as coaches, with activities in track, baseball,
golf, rowing, swimming and tennis into full swing.
Accomplishments on all these sports fronts are expected to im
prove over last year. The efforts of Jordan are already noticeable
with four times the number of students participating and individual
records broken before the season officially begins. The Indian base
ball nine, with but throe varsity members from last year gone, is
expected to cop the league championship.
Finger has a host of sophomores ready for varsity action in golf
lo join a rounded group of upperclassmen. Finger's outstanding
record as golf coach speaks for itself. Rowing coach Lou Lindsey, a
daily commuter from San Francisco, brought the Stanford crew from
Ihe unknown ranks to fifth in the national collegiate regatla last year.
My thanks to Athletic Director Al Masters, who is now recovering
at home from an operation; News Director Don Liebendorfer, and all
of the athletics staff for their cooperation and assistance during the
school year.

It's lime for a change.
This over-used saying has been applied on many occasions this
decade in politics, in the collegiate coaching ranks and in ihe Pacific
Foast Conference meetings, to name a few.
Tomorrow marks another change a change from Volume 130 to
Volume 131 of The Stanford Daily and with it a change of sports
editors. Dean Stewart, a veteran Air Force flier-turned-journalist,
lakes over Ihe reins for the second half of the school year.
As a swan song, it was suggested to sing the blues. But, then,
that wouldn't do. Looking it fiver, hasn't the athletic program ;tt
Stanford provided for the students exactly what it set out to do?
Has it not given all a chance to participate in or witness exciting
compel it ion?
Who can say the Oregon State, UCLA and California football
games didn't generate the utmost in excitement and interest? Yet
we lost. The important thing is not always the winning, but rather
performing to the best.
There has been plenty to cheer about. There wasn't a football
game played this season that wasn't jam-packed with good, hard
play. Our basketball team, too, has surprised all with its come-from.-
behind performances against strong competition.
In Volume 130 stories were included of a Southern "crusade"
and a subsequent Stanford football victory over the Trojans of South
ern (California, 27-19; stories of heartbreaking grid defeats via the
extra point route; stories of All-America notice to quarterback John
IJrodie, tackle Paul Wiggin and halfback Paul Camera.
This was the year Pay ton Jordan look first notice on campus
first with his autumn quarter track meels, then with his trip to the
Olympic (lames in Melbourne, Australia.
Basketball hogged the limelight in December and no one can take
it away from Coach Howie Dallmar and his hustling cagers. Before
Christmas the big news was an upset over R?ce Institute, one of the
powerhouses of the Southwest Conference. Swinging into PCC action,
Ihe basketball quintet gave students something to cheer about in
knocking olf Oregon Stale and Washington, the tall timber of ihe
Northwest.
People enjoy athletics beeai:"« it is competitive, and the closer
the outcome the better the competition A.s in football, there is con
solation in losing if a real effort is expended. In losing to California,
Connecticut, Tennessee, Washington and Oregon State, among others,
Stanford's cagers put on a real exhibition.
What will Dean Stewart and his sports staff have to write about?
The Indian cagers continue PCC action until March St. Before that
date, no one can count Dallmar and his squad out. Then Payton
Jordan, Dutch Fehring , Eud Finger, Lou Lindsey, Tom Ilaynie and
Bob Itenker take over as coaches, with activities in track, baseball,
golf, rowing, swimming and tennis into full swing.
Accomplishments on all these sports fronts are expected to im
prove over last year. The efforts of Jordan are already noticeable
with four times the number of students participating and individual
records broken before the season officially begins. The Indian base
ball nine, with but throe varsity members from last year gone, is
expected to cop the league championship.
Finger has a host of sophomores ready for varsity action in golf
lo join a rounded group of upperclassmen. Finger's outstanding
record as golf coach speaks for itself. Rowing coach Lou Lindsey, a
daily commuter from San Francisco, brought the Stanford crew from
Ihe unknown ranks to fifth in the national collegiate regatla last year.
My thanks to Athletic Director Al Masters, who is now recovering
