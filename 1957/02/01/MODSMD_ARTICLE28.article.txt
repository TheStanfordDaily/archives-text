(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth <>l* a series 011 the indi
viduals thai make up Howie
Hallmar's Stanford basketball
team.)
Prior 1o the Washington bas
ketball series this year Carl
Isaacs was just one of two foot
hall players on the Stanford bas
ketball team. As far as his cage
ability was concerned he was
known as a good end playing bas
ketball.
Nonetheless, early in the first
half of ihe Friday night game
against the Washington Huskies,
Isaacs got the call from coach
Howie Dallmar to go in at center.
Pavilion fan reaction was a stoi
cal what-have we-got-to-lose? at
litude.
Washington looked unbeatable.
They had height, experience and
ability. A good home game sched
ule favored the Huskies to cop
the Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball title. Pregame experts
figured Washington would mftke
Stanford victims five and six to
add to their spotless ■l-O.
opponent team.
Playing like a wild man 10 feet
tall, Isaacs literally out-hustled
Ihe entire Washington team dur
ing the remainder of ITIO first
half. It was his spirited play,
more than any other factor, that
sparked the Indians to a 70-P>3 up
.■jet victory.
Isaacs scored 17 total ly unex
pected points thai night. Even
more unexpected were his II
.straight foul shots, missing only
on his twelfth attempt when the
outcome of the contest had al
ready been decided.

Because of the difficulty of ad
justing' from football to basket
ball and because of the lack of
year-round court experience, Is
aacs' play larks polish. Although
he jumps well and uses his height
to good advantage under the
boards, his shooting, ball han
dling and dr i bb 1 in g lacks a
"smooth touch."
The Stanford coaching staff
feels that if Isaacs had concen
(rated on basketball he would
have become an outstanding play
er. As it is, however, his rugged,
aggressive play earned the 18.'!
pound, fi-M senior the starling role
and it looks as if he's there to
stay.
