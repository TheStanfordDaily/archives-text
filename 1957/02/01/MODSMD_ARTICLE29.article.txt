# Card Cagers Meet Ducks In Two-Game PCC Series
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Wit h bad ankles apparently
1 ready to harass Stanford as much
!as opposing players, the Indian
cagers left for Eugene, Ore., last
night lo meet the University of
Oregon in a two-game sot tonight
and Saturday.
The ankle troubles which are
i currently plaguing Coach Ilowie
Dallmar have come in the form
of injuries to John Pflueger and
Paul Neumann.
Pflueger s injury came late
I Wednesday in practice, but wasn't
; fully diagnosed until yesterday,
i Then it was decided that lie would
be unable to make the trip north
i and should instead concentrate on
| resting his sprain and try to hurry
! the recuperation with whirlpool
! baths.
While Pflueger's loss would be
; serious at any lime, it is especially
j critical since Neumann, another
j soph guard, is also troubled hy an
ankle strain. lie suffered the acci
! dent two weeks ago against Wash
ington, but nonetheless started in
; last week's California game.
Tabbed for Cellar
Before the season began, ox
j ports tabbed the Ducks and the
Indians to light it out for the PCC r
basement. After six games, how
over. Stanford has rolled up a 2-1 j
mark against three of the four
contenders for the championship. I
Oregon has played good ball, but i
has been hold down to a 1-5 PCC i
mark.
Oregon's lone PCC victory came
at the expense of Idaho after the
Ducks had just lost a game to the
Vandals. The remaining four loss
es have been at the hands of
league-loading California and Lar-1
ry Beck-paced Washington State.
The Ducks have been forced to
play four of their six games on
the road and are now returning I
to their friendly home confines I
for six straight contests; thus the!
homo court could spoil some ad-;
vantage over Stanford. The In
dians have played only one of I
their 1957 tilts on the road.
Two Problems
Charlie Franklin and Hal Duffy
are Ihe two problems the Tribe
must solve if they are to have a
successful trip. These two men
are the heart of the Oregon team,
doing far more than their share
of scoring and rebounding. Frank
lin has averaged 18 points a game,
with Duffy contributing over 12
per contest. The pair rank sixth
and third respectively in the PCC
rebounding statistics.
'Flio jump-shooting of Bill Bond
and all-around hustling and ball-;
hawking tactics will he Stanford's i
biggest weapons. All season long 1
the Indians have more than held j
their own in rebounding against!
much tailor teams, but ihis time
they will get a chance to see how
they can perform off ihe boards
against a team whose tallest man
is 6-6.
