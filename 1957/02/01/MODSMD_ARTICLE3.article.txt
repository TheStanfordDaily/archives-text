Undersized and outdated as it is, the I'avilion
will be around for some time to come. A new

"we just don't have the money." Bid the Ath-

letic Department does have a tentative model
for a million new I'avilion. The model was
constructed by architect C arl Warnecke, '452,
a meinber of the "Wow Boys" football team.
