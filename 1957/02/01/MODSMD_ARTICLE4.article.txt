day in advance lhat Britain,
France and Israel would attack I
Egypt. Administration officials
disclosed today.
Intelligence information was in!
the hands of Washington officials
about the time thoy were getting
"misleading" answers from Hie
three nations about pending Mid
dle developments.
This country became suspicious
that lhe three nations would move
against Egypt considerably in ad
vance of the actual attack.
There still was some question
in official circles here as to when
Britain actually committed her
self. Some feel British involve
ment might have dated from an
Oct. 16 Paris meeting between top
British-French officials.
The White House and the State
Department hud said the first
news of the main events in the
Suez Canal conflict came from
news agency reports. But the
three-nation attack did not come
as a complete surprise to Wash
ington.
The United Press was informed
that a top-secret report prepared
by Intelligence agencies was deliv
ered to the White House about 24
hours prior to the Israeli attack
of Oct. 29.
The report, dated Oct. 28, was
said to have made these three
main points:
• Israel had decided not to at
tack Jordan. Karlier Intelligence
estimates indicated thai Israel
would strike against Jordan to
seize territory west of the Jordan
River.
• Israel would attack Egypt.
• France and Britain would
move into the Suez Canal area.
Details of U.S. Intelligence may
be brought into the forthcoming
Senate investigation of the Ad
ministration's Middle East policy.
