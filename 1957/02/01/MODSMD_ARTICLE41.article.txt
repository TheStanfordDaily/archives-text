## Stanford Convalescent School Experiments in Rehabilitation 
### 
The task of educating and rehabilitating physically handicapped
children is being treated from a new angle by the Stanford Con
valescent School.
In an article in the January issue of "Exceptional Children,"
Mrs. Freya W. Owen of the school's staff tells of the "team-

work" method which is coming
into use more and more through
out the country in this work.
In the past, many workers have
acted independently without con
sulting each other. At the Con
valescent school doctors, social
workers, nurses, teachers and
therapists hold frequent confer
ences.
This gives the children benefit
from all the services offered. The
plan is operated around a pro
gram centering on the child's
preparation for return to regular
school and home life.
The school is operated by the
Palo Alto Unified School District
in connection with the Stanford
Convalescent Home. The chil
dren, who are from all over the
state, are handicapped by such
diseases as rheumatic fever, asth
ma, polio and tuberculosis. Al
though past the infectious stages
of their ailments, they require ex
tensive rehabilitation.
When the child nears the end of
his convalescence period, the way
is paved for his arrival home by
visiting schools, doctors, minis
ters and others, in order to make
the transition as easy as possible.
