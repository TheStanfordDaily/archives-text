# IIR Speaker Says Yugoslavia Stresses Consumer Products
## ‘Unsuccessful’ Agriculture Program Parallels Shift from Primary Emphasis on Armaments 
### 
Yugoslavia has shifted its economic; emphasis from military goods
to consumer goods, aSSU Foreign Scholars Aloxandc; Aranieki said
yesterday about his native country.
In an Institute of International Relations cultural talk in Bowman
Alumni House, he praised the condition of industry in Yugoslavia,

bul said agriculture presents
some problems.
Farms, he said, are "primitive
ly toiled because no one ran af
ford any tractors, combines or
other machines. . . . The govern
ment labor- co-operatives are not
very successful because our peas
ants would rather do il with their
bare hands than enter into any
thing that could deprive them of
their land."
Seventy per rent of the country
is devoted to agriculture despite
the mountainous terrain, he said.
Industry
In Yugoslav industry, Aranicki
said, every employee has a share
of the profits of his "organiza
tion." A committee of employees
is organized in each industry to
run business.
At the end of each year, elec
tions are held for new committee
men and profits are distributed
among the workers. Economic
elements of the population re
ceive representation in the Yugo
slav House of Producers, he said.
The House of Producers can
make laws relating only to eco
nomic matters, and can't be over
ruled, he said.
"Only those who produce some
thing can be represented in the
House of Producers," he said,
"and as a student I can't be rep
resented in it because I don't pro
duce anything."
As for climate, Aranicki de
scribed the weather of the Yugo
slav mountains as "the same as
you have in the Rocky Moun
tains."
Warm < lim;ite
The Adriatic coast has, Ara
nicki said, "a very warm climate
like here. The middle of the
country has a continental climate,
rather close to the Midwest very
hot in the summer, cold !n Ihe
winter, fall and spring."
Turning to Yugoslavia's his
tory, Aranicki recounted the na
tion's founding in 1918, the
stormy period of the kingdom,
the invasion of the Nazis and the
liberation directed by Marshal
Tito and Ihe Allies.
He sai/l the Russians gave little
help in driving the Germans out
of his country. "The partisans
were helped by the Communists
for only one month from Sep
tember to (Jclober, 194 I."
lint the Communists were very
much help in repairing Ihe war
damage, Aranicki said.
"There was not two feel of rail
road track undamaged by the
Germans when they < 111 i t the
country," he said. "In two years
all the damage was repaired."
He said Tito followed the Soviet
Union's lead in foreign policy
until the split of 1048. Discussing
the split in that year Aranicki
said, "It was a thing that was
building up for a long lime."

lint the Communists were very
much help in repairing Ihe war
damage, Aranicki said.
"There was not two feel of rail

all the damage was repaired."
He said Tito followed the Soviet

. . primitive toil"
Yugoslavia has shifted its economic; emphasis from military goods
to consumer goods, aSSU Foreign Scholars Aloxandc; Aranieki said
yesterday about his native country.
In an Institute of International Relations cultural talk in Bowman
Alumni House, he praised the condition of industry in Yugoslavia,

bul said agriculture presents
some problems.
Farms, he said, are "primitive
ly toiled because no one ran af
ford any tractors, combines or
other machines. . . . The govern
ment labor- co-operatives are not
very successful because our peas
ants would rather do il with their
bare hands than enter into any
thing that could deprive them of
their land."
Seventy per rent of the country
is devoted to agriculture despite
the mountainous terrain, he said.
Industry
In Yugoslav industry, Aranicki
said, every employee has a share
of the profits of his "organiza
tion." A committee of employees
is organized in each industry to
run business.
At the end of each year, elec
tions are held for new committee
men and profits are distributed
among the workers. Economic
elements of the population re
ceive representation in the Yugo
slav House of Producers, he said.
The House of Producers can
make laws relating only to eco
nomic matters, and can't be over
ruled, he said.
"Only those who produce some
thing can be represented in the
House of Producers," he said,
"and as a student I can't be rep
resented in it because I don't pro
duce anything."
As for climate, Aranicki de
scribed the weather of the Yugo
slav mountains as "the same as
you have in the Rocky Moun
tains."
Warm < lim;ite
The Adriatic coast has, Ara
nicki said, "a very warm climate
like here. The middle of the
country has a continental climate,
rather close to the Midwest very
hot in the summer, cold !n Ihe
winter, fall and spring."
Turning to Yugoslavia's his
tory, Aranicki recounted the na
tion's founding in 1918, the
stormy period of the kingdom,
the invasion of the Nazis and the
liberation directed by Marshal
Tito and Ihe Allies.
He sai/l the Russians gave little
help in driving the Germans out
of his country. "The partisans
