# Lawmaker: Land Plans 'Shocking'
## Blasts Armed Forces For Improving Bases They Now Will Dump 
### 
WASHINGTON, Teh. 3 (UP)
Representative Clair Engle (D-
Calif.) today termed "shocking"
estimates that the armed forces
may have spent up to $1.5 billion
improving installations they now
are trying to get rid of.
Engle is chairman of the House
Interior Committee, which has
been engaged in a running battle
with the Defense Department over
military use of public lands. The
commit lee has charged that the
armed services have spent $315
million on facilities on the lands
they now want to dispose of.
A committee staff member said
the Defense Department has com
pleted only 22 per cent of an in
ventory survey.
"It Ratio Continues"
"Hut if (he same ratio continues
it is conceivable that when the
full report is in we'll find that the
armed services have spent $1.5
billion improving installations
they are now trying to dump,"
lie said.
"These are shocking figures,"
Engle said. "To sit down on these
ranges and put in this expensive
instrumentation, and then have to
pull up stakes and move out,
makes us wonder if there is any
responsibility in the Defense De
partment."
The committee-Defense Depart
ment controversy, which has been
building up for the past year, also
revolves around charges that the
armed services have spent vast
sums building such "luxury" fa
cilities as swimming pools and
golf courses on installations which
now are considered excess.
To Resume Hearings
The committee will resume its
hearings Tuesday to find out why
the Defense Department wants to
dispose of 1,056,083 acres of land
and at the same time has request
ed acquisition of an additional 10,
million acres for military use.
A Defense Department spokes
man said the accusations were
"unfair" because they did not give
"the whole picture."
"None of the so-called luxury
facilities was built with taxpayers'
money," the spokesman said. "The
funds were raised on th* bases
themselves t hr o u g h activities
sponsored by men in the service."
"As for the request to dispose
of certain lands and acquire oth
ers." lie continued, "that is neces
sitated by the constant changes in
military needs. For example, one
installation that miulit have been
adequate as a gunnery range is
no good for guided missile test
ing."
