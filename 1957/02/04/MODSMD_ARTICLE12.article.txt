# CESARE SIEPI
## Concert Shows Fine Singing, Intelligence, Sense of Style 
### Bob Christiansen 
It is often difficult to define that certain quality which distin
guishes an Italian bass from all others. It seems to be a certain
something possessed by such men as Ezio Pinza, Fernando Corena
and, indeed, Cesare Siepi.
Siepi's concert yesterday afternoon showed some fine vocalism,

but, more than I hat, it showed
great intelligence and a fine sense
of style on Siepi's part.
The program opened with two
Handel arias, the "Dignare" from
the Dettingen "Te Deum" and
"Non e si vago e hello" from
"Giulio Cesare." These were both
capably done, with a fine under
standing of the style of the pe
riod.
The air "Good Fellows Be Mei
ry" from the "Peasant Cantata"
of J. S. Bach showed a little too
much of Siepi's fine Italian style
for the trim lines of the Bach
aria.
Strauss Songs
The group of Strauss songs
which followed were as well sung
as they have been by an Italian
in quite a while. One generally
misses the pure German quality
which is so often associated with
these songs.
The two Mozart selections
which followed. "Osmin's Air"
from "The Abduction from the
Seraglio" and Figaro's air, "A
ptife tin po\" from "The Marriage
of Figaro." found Siepi right in
his element.
These were both sung with an
abundance of style. It was rather
surprising to hear "Osmin's Air"
in English, but again. Siepi's fine
sense of style made the defects in
the translation almost unnotice
able.
"Don Juan's Serenade" by
Tschaikovsky was sung with a
much firmer command of his
voice than had Siepi earlier in the
evening. This was followed by
"Mephisto's Serenade" from "The
Damnation of Faust" of Berlioz.
Here Siepi showed not only a
command of style but also com
mand of flexible voice.
Transitory Interest
The group of eontemporary
l\rtglish songs which followed
were well sung, but of only tran
sitory musical interest.
Probably the most enjoyable
selection was nne of the encores,
the famous "Catalog Aria" from
"Don Giovanni." Here Siepi was
at his finest.
This aria was sung not only
with a command of the style of
the period and a command of his
voice, but also with that extra
little "naughtiness" which the
aria rarely gets today. The bland
ncss and the envy of Leporello
were wonderfully portrayed by
Siepi.
"Le Veau d'Or" from "Faust"
was also sung as an encore. Siepi
was ably assisted at the piano by
Ijfo Tauhman.
