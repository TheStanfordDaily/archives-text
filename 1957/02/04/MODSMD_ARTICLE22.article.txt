# College Newspapers and Conformity
## 
### 
We LIVE in an age of growing conformity. 1 n
fortunately, colleges are a breeding ground of
this conformity.
The problem is faced by a college newspaper
perhaps more acutely than any other organi
zation on campus. As Volume 131 of The
Stanford Daily opens, it would be wise to
review our conception of how a college news
paper should function under this atmosphere
of conformity.
â€¢ i people would argue that a college
primary purpose is to reflect; that
the "bullet'.; board'" concept. The paper,
they argue, el Id be completely responsible
to student opinion. li' the majority of students
don't care about national and international
problems, the paper has no business spending
half its front page on news of the world via
the United Tress.
A college paper, they say, has its primary
duty to the campus and should let the city
papers worry about the cares of the nation and
the world. Student activities, pep organizations
and class events she- receive all the play
they want, regardless 01 ... vs value to the whole
campus.
And certainly a college paper should not take
an editorial stand contrary to the views of the
majority, and it has no business taking a stand
on controversial political issues.
But we hold that a college paper should not
publicize; it should inform: It should not
reflect; it should help mold.

One big reason for colleges breeding con
formity is the student's isolation from the out
side world and his lack of concern about this
isolation. When he takes his place in society
his first reaction is confusion, then the satis
faction of going with tlie majority and not
worrying about his individualism.
Therefore, we believe that a college paper
should keep its readers informed about what
is going on in the world, especially since the
paper may be the students' 1 only source of in
formation. Academics and student activity are
fine, but, all by themselves for four years with
out any stimulus from additional sources, they
produce an ivory tower conformist unable to
cope with the outside world.
Similarly, we believe that a college paper
should say what it thinks editorially, regardless
of what the majority student opinion says. For
in this way only will there be any sort of in
tellectual stimulation and freedom of thought
that are sorely needed on this campus. We
heartily condemn any society which, officially
or unofficially, ostracizes anyone who speaks
with a thought not iu line with the so-called
sacred ma jority.
As far as news is concerned, a college paper
should play up student activities which benefit
students, develop individualism and train them
ultimately for the outside world. And it edi
torially should encourage other organizations
to become this way.
Only if it does these things will a paper be
a worthy organ in the university community.
