# Givingâ€”Part of Community Living
## 
### 
This WEEK is 'Winter Quarter Charity Drive
week on the Stanford campus. Each year this
drive is held for the benefit of the American
Red Cross, the Community Chest and 11i<"
World University Service.
Combining the three drives into one is a
unification pattern being adopted throughout
the nation. Its value to Stanford students is
in being able to gi\e once for all three organi
zations, reducing the number of solicitations
during the year.
The causes for which the $8000 goal drive
is being held speak for themselves. Each of
the three organizations is a service group which
is of value not only to the needy but also to
the wealthy of any community. Everyone bene
fits directly and indirectly through the work
of these three organizations.
This year the Stanford Drives Committee is

continuing a tradition established to make
giving pleasant and easy far students. Besides
a personal solicitation campaign, there is an
activity planned for each day of the week.
Profits from the Dave Brubcck concert, the
W eigh-the-Dean Contest, the Penny Mile and
the Taxi Dance will he donated to'lhe drive.
In simple terms, students may give to a worthy
cause and still receive some valuable entertain
ment in return.
Sometimes a certain lethargy attacks students
concerning charity drives and donations. "We'll
give to those things later, when we're finished
with school' is a common refrain. In a solici
tors meeting held lawt week, Dean 11. Donald
\\ inbigler answered this statement. "Being
generous is a part of the life of a community,"
he said, "and college students must take part
in that life. Students can"t put off living or
giving until later." 1
