"An Arcliilecrs Kxtravaganzu"
Editor, The Daily:
We read with interest Ihe recent column by Daily writer Jerry
Kelly concerning the possibility of a new basketball pavilion for
Stanford.
We compared the estimated two million dollar cost for an 8000
seat pavilion with the cost of two similar, recently-built structures,
fieldhouses lor the University of Wichita at Wichita, Kansas, and
Montana State College al Bozeman, Montana.
The figures, as shown in the table below, are rather startling:
.Montana Stale Wichita IJ. Stanford (est.)
Total cost $1,450,000 $1,405,700 $2,000,000
Seating capacity 12,500 10,235 8,000
Cost per seat lit; 137 250
The significant figure is the cost per seat. The estimated cost
of the Stanford pavilion is 182 per cent of that of the WU fieldhouse
and 210 per cent of the cost of the MSG building, on a per seat basis.
Though we have only seen pictures of the MSC fieldhouse, we
have been to the Wichita IJ. fieldhouse. It is a modern, functional
structure which would be a credit to any campus.
Jerry Kelly's description of the proposed Stanford pavilion, "an
architect's extravaganza," is quite fitting. The Board of Athletic
Control would be well advised to seek a more practical and economi
cally feasible design.
If they choose not to, Stanford probably will still he performing
before 2700 tans in 1967.
