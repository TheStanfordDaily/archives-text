sweep of a FCC series this season
as I lie Indians whipped Oregon in
two games al lingerie over the
weekend.
On Friday night, Coach Howie
Dallmar's crew pulled ahead with
11 minutes to play and went on
to roll over I lie Ducks, (58-52. Sat
urday, the Tribe had a much eas
ier lime of it, although winning
hy jus! nine points, G5-56.
Jn the first game of the series,
ii appeared as though Stanford
was destined for another of its
famous hair raising finishes. It
was nip and tuck throughout the
first half, with the Indians leav
ing the floor holding a 29-2<X edge.
Sliil <iiitt" Score
The score shifted hack and
forth again in the second stanza
until IJond hit on a jump shot to
put Stanford ahead 47-45. The
winners quickly shot ahead by 10,
saw their lead crumple to three
points, hut then put on another
scoring hurst to ice the contest.
Through Hie final II minutes, the
bucks were outseored 21-7 hy the
hall-hawking Stanford team.
Bond led the way with 23
points, while Hap Wagner tanked
II and bick Haga scored 10. The
Indians collected their 23 field
goals on only 45 attempts, good
for a 51 per cent average. Prob
ably the poorest statistic as l'ar as
the Tribe was concerned was in
free throw shooting as they capi
talized on only 22 of 37 foul shots.
The team as a whole cooled off
a bit on Saturday, but Bond
warmed up even more as he
scored 2S points in leading Stan
ford to the win. This time, the
IVC's surprise team jumped off
to a quick K-0 lead over the sur
prised bucks.
Indians Red-Hoi
Stanford continued to widen its
lead during the first half, and
stretched it to 12 points at half
time, 34 22. The Indians were still
red-hot when the second 20-min
ute period began as they pulled
ahead 42 2"), the 17-poinl lead be
ing their widesl margin of the
night.
Oregon eventually moved back
to within eight points of Stanford
on two occasions, but by this time
ballinar was giving the Tribe's I
reserves a chance to pick up val
uable playing time.
The five starters were the only
men to score for Stanford as
I laag hit for 13 points, and Paul
Neumann, Wagner and Carl Is
aacs flipped through nine., eight
and seven respectively.
Itegain Free-Throw Accuracy
In the second game, Stanford
was again up to par in Ihe free
throw department as they made |
75 per cent of their 36 attempts. I
Bond hit 12 in a row, but missed I
his last.
Neumann's ankle, which was i
hurl against Washington two |
weeks ago and had been a source
of concern to ballmar, was appar
ent ly almost back to full strength !
as the sophomore guard played
much of both games and picked!
up a total of 10 points.
The twin wins pulled the In
dians up to 4 1 in conference I
standings, and they now have
four more victories than so-called
pie-season experts predicted they :
would have at this stage of the 1
season. The 4-4 record has put
Stanford in fourth place, three
games behind California, UCLA
and Washington.
Fourth place will go on the line
this weekend when Washington
Stale comes to the Pavilion for a
two game set. The Cougars are
in fifth with a 3-4 record, and
have been rough all season.


FAMILIAR POKE â€”Bill Bond, Stanford's high-scoring master of
the jump shot, is shown here in recent Pavilion action. Over the
weekend against Oregon Bond scored 51 points to lead the Indians
to a sweep of the two-game series. Stanford now has a 4-4 record
in conference play.
