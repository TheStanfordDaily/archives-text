>11. \>w Takes Early Lead
Coach Dick Clegg's freshmen
found themselves unable to con
nect on their passing in the first
half, and consequently were in
possession of the ball very sel
dom. The frosh were also having
-trouble on the backboards where,
at first. I lie visiting Eagles looked
their sharpest.
Behind 6-5 center Steve Flynn
the Mountain View squad lost no
time in taking control. At one
point Ihe Eagles drove to a 13-
point spread, 25-12, and were still
in the lead at the buzzer, 30-23.
Stanford connected on only six
field goals in Ihe first half.
Flynn dumped in 15 markers in
the first stanza but was only able
to add two more in the second
half to emerge the game leader
with 17. John Escobar and Do
mingo Roldan of the Eagles tied
behind the leader with 11 each.
Borford Sparks Drive
Stanford's glory was all written
in the second - half drive which
was sparked by Burford's offen
sive and defensive attack. Early
in the third period on two free
throws Jim Curtice tied the game
at 36 all for the locals and then
sent them a point ahead, 37-36.
Mountain View then jumped to
a one-point, 38-37 lead but this
was the last time they were to see
themselves ahead of the frosh.
Clegg's hoopsters dropped in 30
counters in the third quarter
alone and ou I scored ihe visitors
37 points to Id at one point in the
