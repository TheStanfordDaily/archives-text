# Chamber of Commerce Head Calls for $5 Billion Budget Cut
## Council of Economic Advisers Chief Takes Mild View of Inflationary Effects of Spending 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (UP)—President John S. Coleman of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce said today a federal budget cut of at
least $5 billion is "absolutely essential" to the national economy.
He said preliminary chamber studies show that between $2 billion
and $3 billion can be cut from President Eisenhower's new $71.8 bil-

lion budget "without harm to any
necessary federal service."
These studies have not yet
touched on costly foreign aid and
farm subsidy programs, Coleman
said. He said ho is certain the
completed study will'show "that
at least $5 billion, and perhaps
more, can be cut."

Senator Jacob K. Javits 'k-
N.Y.i said loday he believes Con
gress can cut the budget, but not
to any "really big extent."
Meanwhile, the House-Senate
Economic Committee made pub
lie testimony by Raymond J. Saul
nier, chairman of the Council of
Keonomic Advisers, on the infla
tionary effects of the budget.
Saulnier, who testified before
the group last Monday, appeared
to take a somewhat milder view
than that expressed previously by
Treasury Secretary George M.
Humphrey.
"Curl Your Hair"
Humphrey predicted a depres
sion flint "will curl your hair"
unless the federal tax drain on
the economy eventually is re
duced.
Saulnier refused to interpret
Humphrey's comment. But he
saifl he did not believe the present
spending level, which does not ex
cred revenue, is "a factor likely
to produce depression conditions
• in the immediate run."
He said a balanced budget is
"an anti inflationary element in
our program." However, he said
he would like to see h larger sur
plus than the $1.7 billion fore
cast in the budget for fiscal 1938.
