# Does Du Pont have summer jobs for students?
## 
### 
G. Carter received his M.S. in industrial engineering
from Ohio State in 1951 and joined Du Pont soon afterward.
After varied plant experience, he recently undertook an inter
esting new assignment in the Polychemicals Department at
Du Pont's Sabine River Works, Orange, Texas. The major func
tion of his current work is to coordinate cost information as an
aid in maintaining cost control.
You bet we do, Walt! They're part of a regular Tech
nical Training Program which Du Pont has had fof>
years.
Ordinarily we try to assign summer employees to work
which ties in with their fields of training in college and
with their long-range interests. Informal or formal instruc
tion on Company matters is usually provided.
We're definitely in favor of these summer contacts, (or
they provide students with practical technical experience
and make them more valuable to industry when they
graduate. And it gives us a chance to become better
acquainted, too, with some of the men we'll be consider
ing for permanent employment, later. It's a program of
mutual benefit.

Tn addition to (lie Formal Technical Training Program,
we frequently have a number of vacation replacement
jobs and other temporary posit ions which are available
to college students.
Last summer we hired a total of 720 students from 171
different colleges and universities. Most, of these were
juniors, or were graduate students about one year away
from permanent employment.
You can see our program is a fairly substantial one,
Walt.
