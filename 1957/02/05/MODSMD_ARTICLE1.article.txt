# Brubeck, Co. Open Drive With Concert
## Outstanding Delicacy Characterizes Group; Continuity Pleasing 
### Bob Dolan 
The college went to the jazz
last night as Brubcek opened up
this winter's charity drive with
a superb concert.
For only $1.50 per, Stanford
students were treated to Brubeck
ill one of bis best moments. Bru
beck took only a small percentage
of his usual fee and the rest of
I lie funds will go toward the
â€¢ Sttooo goal of I lie charity drive.
The proceeds of this drive will be
split among Red Cross, World
University Service and the Com
munity Chest.
Perpetual Trophy
This year's drive inaugurates a
perpetual trophy for the living
group with the highest per capita
donation. The trophy, a bronze
plaque, will be engraved with the
names of the winners.
During the concert, the? entire
group played with outstanding
delicacy. "VVe seem to have con
tinuity tonight," Brubeck said.
"That's the way I like it."
Brubeck was so pleased with
the first half of the concert that
he decided to try some new num
bers oft nis latest record, "Jazz
Impressions of the U.S.A." on Co
lumbia. Numbers like "Summer
Song," with Dave's haunting in
tro, show that this record is one
to check.
Also from the new record was
"Plain Song." Written on a bus
somewhere in the Midwest, it il
lustrates the subtle and beautiful
changes in the repetitious scen
ery of the plains. Phrases recur,
just as a tree or a farm will, ap
pearing just like the last, only
not quite.
Morello a Surprise
A surprise to some was Jo Mo
rello, a drummer who joined the
group last October. His driving
rhythm refuted the contention
that the quartet does not swing.
Joe was featured in "Sounds of
the Loop," a number musically
portraying the Loop district of
Chicago.
"He's the world's greatest
drummer," Desmond said. His
solo on this number showed
amazing originality and tech
nique. At one point his bass
drum was reminiscent of Louis
Bellson's bass drum roll in "Skin
Deep." But Bellson used two bass
drums, and Morello had only one.
Brubeck, recently on tour in the
Midwest, is now holding out at
the Black Hawk in San Francisco
until Fib. 2(>. Then the group will
fly to New York for an engage
ment there.

continuing throughout the week,

proposed goal. He expects great

coming week. If the concerts is a
good indication of the quality of
the drive, he won't be disap
pointed.
