WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP)—Crown Prince Abdul Ilah of Iraq
arrived hero today seeking first hand information on President Eisen
hower's program to keep Communism out of the Middle East.
Abdul Ilah, who is here on an "informal" visit, also will confer with
King Saud of Saudi Arabia. Saud said today he believed other Arab

leaders would accept Fisenhow
er's Middle East doctrine ii it was
fully explained 1o them.
If "the points 1 raised here
could be clarified to them as thoy
have been to mi\" Saud said, oth
er Arab leaders would accept Ei
senhower's plan. It calls for use
of U.S. dollars and troops if nec
sary to halt. Red expansion in
the Mideast.
To Confer Tomorrow
Abdul Ilah will confer tomor
row with Eisenhower and Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles.
He told reporters as he stepped
off his train from New York that
ho would ask them for more de
tails on the President's plan.
The prince also is expected to
renew Iraq's long-standing re
quest for U.S. jet fighters.
Because the crown prince is
here on an "informal" visit the
reception by U.S. officials was
markedly different from Saud's
welcome. Saud was welcomed bv
U.S. destroyers in New York and
later flown to Washington where
he was greeted at the airport by
Eisenhower.
Abdul Ilah was met at the train
station by the ambassadors of
several Middle Eastern countries,
William Rountree, Assistant Sec
retary of State for Near Eastern
Affairs,, and several other State
Department officials.
Plans Week's Visit
Originally Abdul Ilah's visit
was to have lasted only two days.
But he was forced to postpone the
visit and he now plans to stay in
the capital for a week.
Saud said he will try to clear up
Arab misunderstandings of the
President's plan when he returns
home. It calls for use of U.S. dol
lars — and possibly troops ■— to
keep Russia out of the Mideast.
The king's statements, a big
boost for the plan, were made in
an interview with Marguerite
Higgins of the New York Herald
Tribune and confirmed by a royal
Saudi counselor.
, Son in Hospital
Meanwhile, the king went to
Walter Reed Army Medical Cen
ter to pick up his scene-stealing
son, Prince Masshur.
The youngster, who suffers
from partial paralysis of his right
arm and leg, was wearing a new
leg brace to help him walk better.
It was anonunced that a U.S.
Army doctor will go to Saudi Ara
bia to instruct Arab physicians
in treatment of the ailment. The
doctor, to be chosen later, will be
a top specialist in the field.
