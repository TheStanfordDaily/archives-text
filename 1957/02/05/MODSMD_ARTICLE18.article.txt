## UN 						Resolutions Cause Variety of Middle East Clashes, Israeli Says 
### 
Avraham Biran, Consul Gen
eraJ of Israel for the 11 Western
states, yesterday afternoon told
of the complex problem he seps
when "An Israeli Looks at the
Middle East."
Biran spoke before nearly 100
persons in a speech sponsored by
the Institute of International Re
lations and Hoover Institute and
Library and Bowman Alumni
House. Dr. C. Easton Rothwell,
Director of Hoover Library, in
troduced the speaker.
Variety of Problems
"It is important to recognize
the variety of problems in the
Middle East," he said. There is a
classification between East and
West, "a clash within the Arab
world, a clash within the world al
liance and a clash between Israel
and the Arab world," he said.
The United Nations attempted
to solve the problem in the Mid
dle East by passing a resolution
in Israel was not happy
with the resolution because it did
not give her as much as she had
asked for, and Jerusalem was not
within her territory, he said. "But
she accepted it in good faith" in
the interest of peace.
Biran said the Arabs use "a
double moral standard" — "one
standard when a resolution af
fects Israel, another when it af
fects Arabs."
UN Resolution Passed
A 1951 resolution passed in the
UN favored Israel. It was to give
her free passage through the
Suez Canal, but it was not imple
mented.
Israel's decision to attack
Egypt in October, 1956, was
reached "purely because of the
problem of the physical existence
of the state of Israel," he said.
The double threat of Nasser and
the Communists made the action
a "necessity," he said.
Biran calls the action a "coun
ter-attack." As such, he said it
would be sanctioned by the Unit
ed Nations Charter. The Egyp
tians themselves had said a state
of war still existed between the
two nations, he noted.
