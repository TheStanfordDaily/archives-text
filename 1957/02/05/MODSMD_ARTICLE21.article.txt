Svudi Arabia's King Saud and President Eisen
hower conclude their talks this week end, and
then Saud and his gold-sworded bodyguards
will return to their desert palaces.
But judging from their first round of talks
it appears that the United States will continue
to receive a major part of its foreign oil from
Saudi Arabia and will continue to keep Saud s
backing with arms and aid.
With almost ail other Middle Eastern oil
sources cut off, the United States must of ne
cessity hold on to this cheapest of oil sources.
Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson
made a strong point Sunday when he suggested
to the State Department that more Middle
Eastern officials be invited to the United States.
We contend that this suggestion should also
be extended to Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito, an

other person who is vitally needed in our
touchy relations with the satellite nations.
To say that Saint should not have heen in
vited to the United Stales because he is anti
(latholic, anti-Jewish and ruler of a slave state
is ridiculous. It is impossible to apply Ameri
can values to a foreigner whose culture is com
pletely different.
The same holds for Tito, whom certain con
gressmen should realize vve must keep as an
all\fc Besides, as Johnson pointed out, Tito anil
others cannot help being impressed Jay a first
hand view of American life.
"Unlike the Russians, vve have nothing to
hide and plenty to show, and we should lake
advantage of that fact,"" he sums up.
It is important to present a strong picture to
the world, but I here is no reason for slamming
the door in the face of foreign leaders.
