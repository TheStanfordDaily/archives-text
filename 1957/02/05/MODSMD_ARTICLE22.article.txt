The Chaparral and Elvis Presley are making
news at other Pacific Coast college?: besides Stan
ford.
Members of the Chappie staff invaded the Uni
versity of California campus last Thursday at !
p.m. and set up shop in Eshieman Court.
For about an hour everything went fine. About
30 copies of the Chap. il's latest journalistic
effort, priced at 35 < r<> vere sold in the hour
until University >112 .'.ilhurnia Publications Office
Director stopped by.
Frederick paused, picked up a magazine,
laughed, bought the copy and told Chappie to
leave the campus.
Frederick later explained that no peddling or
soliciting is permitted on the UC campus.

In Moscow, Idaho, radio station KRPL recently
took an Elvis Presley popularity poll which re
lated 533 people liked Presley's vocalism while
451 voiced disagreement over his type of croon
ing.
But "Gub" Mix, KRPL Presley poll spokesman,
said most Washington State College and Univer
sity of Idaho students voted "negatively."

From Seattle, Washington, however, come re
ports "there may he a rush on blue suede boots."
The University of Washington Daily says tenta
tive plans call for a rodeo to be held in the Husky
football stadium in March, featuring "Elvis Pres
ley and assorted bulls."
Plans are highly indefinite, the TJW Daily hints,

as "there is also a degree of doubt about Pres
ley's willingness to share billing (or hulling)
with anybody or anything else."
Student body president Dick Leon is also con
sulting Husky public opinion, telling studentsJo
come to his office and "swoon or register com
plaints."

While Washington is pondering the need for a
Presley rodeo, the University of Oregon Daily
Emerald, in an editorial last week, doubted the
need for so many campus "queens."
It seems the Eugene (Ore.) Junior Chamber of
Commerce is sponsoring the local elimination
routes) for Queen of the Canadian Rockies Con
test and the Daily Emerald staff protests this sit
uation because they think women are in school
to learn and not to primp and they think Oregon
has enough queens.
"This university," the Daily Emerald pro
claims, "already boasts of 1217 Queens of Some
thing-or Other."
In the week preceding the Daily Emerald's edi
torial, no less lhaii three queens were crowned
on i lie Eugene campus.
University of Oregon women are also learning
iiow to shoot pool. In a roped-off, women-only
area of Hie Student Union last Tuesday, billiards
expert Charlie Peterson spent two hours teach
ing Webfoot women the line arts of three cush
ion and pocket billiards.
So great was the demand, Peterson had to give
several exhibitions, as well as numerous lessons.
