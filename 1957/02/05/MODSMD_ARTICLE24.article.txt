Hard Push for Regulation < Jianges
Editor, The Daily:
I have been both delighted and amazed to no
tice toe response of the women of Stanford to my
iftpas on liberalization of the Social Regulations.
As l'ar as 1 can judge, they are very close to
achieving their chance to demonstrate their ma
turity in handling their own lives. But they must
push, and push hard, il they are to carry the
changes through.
The subject has now been reopened, and it must
be kept opened; the Social Regulations Commit
tee and Women's Council must realize that the
women here really want a chance to prove them
selves. Those who fiave written The Daily and
have spoken in their houses advocating liberali
zation are to be sincerely congratulated for being
willing to take adult responsibility.
I feel there is one aspect of the problem which
must be treated carefully, and that is the fresh
men. Unfortunately, a combination of a back
ward culture and overly protective parents places
many girls here who have had virtually no expo
rienee in handling themselves.
Nevertheless, they must come out of the nest
sometime, and so, while il might be dangerous
to grant them complete freedom of late leaves
right away, perhaps they could be given :i7> the
first quarter, 40 the next and 50 the third, in
preparation for the unlimited late leave system
which seems to me the only sensible system for
the upper-classmen.
However 1 , there seems no reason why all the
dorms, including Roble and Brainier, could not
stay open until midnight, at least for the girls,
so they could get ;i late evening cup of coffee
without having to plan before 10:30, which seems
a bit ridiculous.
It is fantastic to me that the only adverse com
ment so far has come from a gentleman, Mr. Mal

colmn C Maddy. Mr. Maddy said that lie feared
for the grades of the women and quoted a situa
tion where he "shuddered to think" what the
results would have been had the dormitory been
open. The figures, however, indicate that Mr.
Maddv should do a lot more worrying about the
men's grades than those of the women, and if
he is going to shudder about people who have
imbibed alcohol being around women's dormi
tories, Mr. Maddy is going to have dfath-like
chills every night of the week for a long, long
lime.

Yugoslavian Speedi <lorrcctions
Editor, The Daily:
In your report about my speech on Yugoslavia
which was published Friday your reporter has
misunderstood or mis-remembered a few facts:
• In line one you say that "Yugoslavia has
shifted its economic emphasis from military to
consumer goods. I said that we shifted emphasis
I rom heavy industry to industry of consumer
goods (heavy industry means industry of, e.g.,
hydroelectric turbines, tractors, heavy machin
ery).
• In line 12 instead of labor co-operatives I
said agricultural co-operatives.
® In lines lfi-17 you say: "than enter into any
thing that could deprive them of their land." I
said: "than enter into anything that they think
would possibly deprive them of their land." (Ac
cording to the law members of our agricultural
co-operatives retain their private land.)
• Line !)f>: Il is not cold in winter, spring and
autumn, but only in winter while spring and an
I umn are predominantly warm.
• Line l? from bottom: The Partisans were
helped by the Red Army is what T said.
