The Scarlet Letter
Th is is a heart rending story of a humble Boston lass
named Hester Prynne who is so poor that she does not
have enough to eat, nor a roof to cover her head. But
she is a brave, brawny lass and she never complains and
by and by her patience is rewarded: in the summer of
]859 she wins a football scholarship to Alabama.
Hester works hard and makes the varsity and wins
her letter. Everybody says she is a shoo-in for All-Con
ference honors, but along cornes the War Between the
States, and football, alas, is dropped for the duration.

Poor Hester goes back to Boston. Tt is a bitter cold
winter, and poor Hester, alas, does not have :i roof over
her head, and the only warm clothing she owns is the
football sweater from Alabama, but that, alas, has a
big scarlet "A" on the front of it, and she can hardly wear
such a thing -in Boston where Union sentiment runs
no high.
Poor Heater, alas, freezes to death.

Little Women
The Marches are a very happy family —and for no
reason whatsoever. They are poor as snakes; they work
from cockcrow to evensong; their dear old father Philip
is away with the Union armies; and their mattresses are
lumpy.
Still, nothing can dampen the spirits of madcap Meg, *
jocular Jo, buoyant Beth, animated Amy, and crazy old
Marmee, as the merry March girls lovingly call their £
lovable mother. ">
Well sir, one Christmas 1he March girls get an in
vitation to a ball. But Beth reminds the sisters that they
can hardly go traipsing off and leave poor Marmee alone /
at Christmas time. The sisters swear a lot, but they
finally agree with Heth.
Marmee, however, will not hear of it. "Land's sake,
little women!" she cries. "You must go to 1he ball and
have some fun. There will be punch and ginger snaps
and confetti. Best of all, there will be morris dancing.
Oh, how your father and I used to love that!"
"I never knew father could dance," cries Meg.
"Oh, yeah?" cries Marmee. "You should have seen
Philip morris!"
"Was Philip a good morriser?" cries Jo.
"The best," cries Marmee. "Philip could morris in
long size and regular and was full of natural goodness
and fresh and firm and unfiltered too."
•
The girls are cheered to hear this and go to the ball.
Marmee stays home all alone, but soon gets a wonderful
surprise: Philip comes back from the war!
When the girls return from the ball, they find Marmee
and Philip morrising, and they cry "Huzzah!" and throw
their bonnets in the air, where they are to this day.
