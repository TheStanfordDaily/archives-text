# Sequoia Needs Writers

Any undergraduates interested
in writing articles for Sequoia?
Eleanor Ogden, newly elected
editor, hopes that the magazine
will be less pressed for material
in the future, especially for ar
ticles by undergraduate students.
After she lakes over from pres
ent editor Don Shoup in the
spring, she hopes to have a list of
desired topics for articles drawn
and mailed to those who have ex
pressed an interest. This list
would also be available at the
Sequoia, office.
This year a subscription pro
gram was tried that was very sue-
I cessful. Next year the program
1 will be enlarged to include mail
ing copies home. Miss Ogden
hopes that since the Sequoia will
probably never become self-sup
porting even with a circulation
increase, the ASSU will continue
its support of the magazine.
Sequoia has a very flexible
staff. Positions may be added or
I subtracted as the needs of the
, magazine change. The present
I staff will c on t in u e serving
through spring quarter. Miss Og-

I den will pick all but one or two
jof her next year's staff during
. spring quarter. This arrangement
| not only makes it possible for
I new members to become better
acquainted with their new duties
before they lake over in the fall,
but also gives old board members
a chance to take a little time off
during spring quarter if they
need to.
The Sequoia office consists of
three rooms with a lounge in
front where workers may gather
to chat during "slow" hours.
[ Those interested in working on
the publication are welcome to
drop in and talk with a member
of the staff. Miss Ogden said.
Another aim of the new editor
is to sponsor a dinner before each
issue and have a guest speaker
from the area. Last year such a
dinner was sponsored at which
i Dr. Margery Bailey spoke.
