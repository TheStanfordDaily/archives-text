Not all of the exciting basketball played here at Stanford this
year has come as part of a varsity game. Granted, the Indians have
tinned in some spectacular shows, hut in the course of the season
Dick Clegg's Papooses have deserved to step into the local limelight.
This year's frosh squad has been mind I lie "l ines!" Papoose
team to appear on campus within the lust five years at least.
< oueli Clegg has called it the "finest team lie has worked with,"
and Indian mentor llnwie Dallinar believes it to he"the best
freshman club he has seen" either at Stanford or at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, where he coached before coming to tin*
I'arm.
Currently sporting an impressive 9-2 record for the season, the
frosh have repeatedly proved themselves worthy of the credit they
have received. Their only losses have come at the hands of the East
Contra Costa J.C. quintet, 73(13, and the Berkeley frosh, 42-40.
Impressive wins have been scored over Fullerton J.C., long a first
rate junior college team, and Modesto and Oakland junior colleges,
among others. In their last victory, over highly-ranked Mountain
View High School, the frosh had to overcome the results of a bad
start to finally down the high schoolers, but did so with the finesse
of old pros, completely stealing the thunder in the second stanza.
Giving credit to individuals on the squad is a difficult task.
Tills writer would venture to say that there has seldom been a
club with such depth. This fact is proven in Clegg's inability to
name a definite starting live. From week to week competition
al practice decides the various starters, and this competition is
keen.
These facts about the frosh may lead us to look to the future.
What is in store for Dallmar and the varsity in the next couple of
year's? Almost any member of the Papooses has the ability to play
varsity hall. Experience alone will be the deciding factor in many
cases.
At this writing it appears that (i-K center Neal Brockmeyer and
forwards Jerry Thuesen, Chris Burford and Mike Tipton will be hard
to keep off the varsity team. Each of these men has been valuable
to Clegg this year 1 , and Dallmar is looking forward to the help they
will give him in '.77-7)8. Dallmar's only concern is that Burford, a
double-threat man who is also a top footballer 1 , will be reporting late
to practice.
What cannot be overlooked is the fact that these men can be
outplayed by many other Papooses. Dick Thompson, Ted .Vlulis
and 'lim Curtice have shown the most improvement this year and
will soon he pressuring the squad leaders for starting roles.
Also moving fast within the frosh ranks is 5-7 guard John Stabler,
who is rated the "toughest man to cover 'one-on-one' besides Ron
Tomsic and Bill Bond" that Clegg has ever seen. With Stabler is
Marion Keyes, who lacks experience and some work in fundamentals,
but who possesses much potential.
Bated high in the improvement department is Ken Balling, whose
lack of experience is partly overshadowed by his great rebounding
ability for his size.
Tipton and Brockmeyer will also be improving with additional
experience. Tipton is playing his first year away from the center
spot which he held in high school, and Brockmeyer will gain needed
i.ggressive practice by playing against better opponents.
The outlook is good—in fact, excellent. There never has been
a better one. Indian fans can expect to see heap good basketball
on their home court for at least the next three years. If yon
haven't dropped in at the Pavilion early enough to see the frosh
play, you've missed something. It might also he worth giving up
a dinner sometime during the remainder of the season to check
on this forecast of the future.

double-threat man who is also a top footballer 1 , will be reporting late
to practice.
What cannot be overlooked is the fact that these men can be
outplayed by many other Papooses. Dick Thompson, Ted .Vlulis
and 'lim Curtice have shown the most improvement this year and
will soon he pressuring the squad leaders for starting roles.
Also moving fast within the frosh ranks is 5-7 guard John Stabler,
who is rated the "toughest man to cover 'one-on-one' besides Ron
Tomsic and Bill Bond" that Clegg has ever seen. With Stabler is
Marion Keyes, who lacks experience and some work in fundamentals,
but who possesses much potential.
Bated high in the improvement department is Ken Balling, whose
lack of experience is partly overshadowed by his great rebounding
ability for his size.
Tipton and Brockmeyer will also be improving with additional
experience. Tipton is playing his first year away from the center
spot which he held in high school, and Brockmeyer will gain needed
i.ggressive practice by playing against better opponents.
The outlook is good—in fact, excellent. There never has been
a better one. Indian fans can expect to see heap good basketball

Currently sporting an impressive 9-2 record for the season, the
frosh have repeatedly proved themselves worthy of the credit they
have received. Their only losses have come at the hands of the East
Contra Costa J.C. quintet, 73(13, and the Berkeley frosh, 42-40.
Impressive wins have been scored over Fullerton J.C., long a first
rate junior college team, and Modesto and Oakland junior colleges,
among others. In their last victory, over highly-ranked Mountain
View High School, the frosh had to overcome the results of a bad
start to finally down the high schoolers, but did so with the finesse
of old pros, completely stealing the thunder in the second stanza.
Giving credit to individuals on the squad is a difficult task.
Tills writer would venture to say that there has seldom been a
club with such depth. This fact is proven in Clegg's inability to

These facts about the frosh may lead us to look to the future.
What is in store for Dallmar and the varsity in the next couple of

varsity hall. Experience alone will be the deciding factor in many
