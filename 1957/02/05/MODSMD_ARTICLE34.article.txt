"A hard and conscientious
worker" is Ihe description given
the Indians' big center, Clint War

prospectus.
Waring a junior and varsity let
terman from the 1955-56 Indian
cage troupe, has started most of
this season at the center position.
Last year he saw limited action in
19 games, playing behind veteran
Barry Brown.
Not tall as modern centers go,
War ing carries a solid 215 pounds
on his six-foot four-inch frame.
A resident of Stockton, Waring
attended Stockton High School
where, in jiddition to basketball
awards, he won two letters in
baseball and one in football. In
football he held down ihe center
position and in baseball his tal
ents were employed as a pitcher.
Waring is a nislory major, and
plans to enter business after
graduation.

"Big Cat" of last year's UCLA
live, the best basketball player
he's faced in competition .'it Stan

best club ho has played against
and last season's UCLA series the
best. An underdog Tribe dropped
a pair of thrillers, 50 18 and 81-
