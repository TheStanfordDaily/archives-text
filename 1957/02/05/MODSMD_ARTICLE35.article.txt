# Indians Seeking Four Straight In Weekend Series With WSC
## Cougars Stand 3-5 in Coast Conference Play; Cards' Bond and WSC's Beck in Scoring Duel 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford's Indians hope to run their conference victory string to
four straight this weekend when Larry Beck and the Washington
State Cougars come to the Pavilion for- a two-game set.
The Cards scored their first series sweep of the season last Friday
and Saturday nights when they downed last-place Oregon twice in

Eugene. The Cougars also swept ,
a pair from the Webfoots in their]
last conference outing.
WSC is currently 3-5 in league
play, having dropped two games
each to the conference unheatens, j
California and UCLA, and split ,
with arch rival Idaho.
Indians 4-4
Stanford brought its record up
to an even 4-4 with the wins over
Oregon and hopes to move over
to the winning side of the ledger
against Jack Friel's lads.
Only one Cougar has caused
much of a sensation this season,
hut that one boy presently rests
far out front in conference scor
ing. lie's Larry Beck, the 6-3,
215 - pound senior who has
pumped through 183 points in
eight games for a 22.9 average.
Beck has been collared only
once during league play, when J
Idaho stopped him with 13. He
came back later that week, how- j
ever, with 33- and 31 -point per*- j
formances against Oregon, his |
high totals for the season.
Argument from Bond
But Beck may have an argu-1
mcnt from Stanford's Bill Bond
before Ihe season is over as to
who lakes the loop scoring crown.
Bond averaged only 13.7 points
in his first throe league contests
but has been singeing the cords
to the tune of 23.6 points per
game in the last five outings.
Bond hit his season's high, 28, !
last Saturday. This scoring burst i
moved the Card star into second
position in the scoring race with
1.")!) points and a If).}) average for
the season.
