NEW YORK. Feb, -1 (UP)-
Mickey Mantle was rewarded
with the "greatest" pay increase
in the history of the giltÂ»edged
New York Yankees today when
he officially signed his 1957 con
tract for a reported $60,000.
Moreover, club president Dar;
Topping predicted that "if Mickey
remains sound" he might crack
baseball's $100,000 ceiling "within
two years."
The 25 - year - old. blond - haired
center fielder toiled tor an esti
mated $32,000 last year when ho
won the American League's triple
crown batting titles. Thus, his
new contract represents almost a
100 per cent increase.
Not even the great Babe Ruth,
who once was paid $80,000 by the
Yankees, or Joe DiMaggio, ihe
former $100,000 Yankee Clipper,
earned such a one-year pay hike
in their salad days with the world
champions.
