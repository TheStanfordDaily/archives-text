# Ebb: Enough Interest Shown In Amendment
## Law Professor Defends Bill, Refutes Criticisms In Poli Union Speech 
### 
Professor Lawrence Ebb,
speaking yesterday before mem
bers of the Political Union Inde
pendent Caucus, declared that he
feels that sufficient interest has
been demonstrated in the consti
tutional amendment proposed by
several faculty members to war
rant presenting it again.
The amendment consists of two
sections. The first would grant a
life term in the Senate to all ex-
Presidents, and the second a four
year term to the Presidential run
ner-up.
In view of the fact that many
of those senators who commented
on the proposal felt that the first
section of the bill was "old stuff"
and that the Senate has just
passed a bill which gives ex-Pres
idents a life-time pension and
therefore some official status
this section will probably be elim
inated from the re-draft.
Senators at Large
The second section will be pre
sented with some clarification.
The title "Senator-at-Large" may
be inserted to pacify those who
feel that the change would de
stroy equal representation of the
states in the Senate. And a clause
delaying the application of the
amendment until the election af
ter its adoption will be inserted.
This will insure that the person
ality issue will not play a part in
its acceptance.
"But it. seems obvious that
some change must be made," said
Ebb. "Big and rich as we are we
cannot afford to waste the talent
available to us. especially in this
time of international crisis."
This system would enable the
runner-up to keep in touch with
senatorial leaders in his own par
ty, and at the same time he would
be in an effective position to vote
and to, obtain day-by-day informa
tion on legislation.
Arguments Against
In conclusion Ebb discussed
some of the arguments against
the proposal. He did not feel that
the addition of one man to the
Senate would deprive regular
members of their committee posi
tions.
Nor did he feel that the run
ner-up would use the position as
a political football. "There is no
reason to believe that he would
be more ambitious than any other
senator, and this way he would
at least have a positive record if
he wished to run again."
