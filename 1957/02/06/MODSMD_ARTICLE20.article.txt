Dean ol Students 11. Donald Winbigler and

For a university the size of Stanford, the
"Stanford— Today and Tomorrow" talks are a
unique privilege. In most universities the ad
ministration would be content to send informa
tive publications to the alumni about develop
ment and growth of the campus, and not bother
to acquaint the students with any other uni
versity lite than academic.
Fortunately, this is a university that believes
a student is more valuable if he feels himself
a part of all University life, and is not shut off
in his academic ivory tower.
It would be a mistake if every Stanford stu
dent did not avail himself ol the opportunity
to hear about how his University is run, from
the verv men who run it.
