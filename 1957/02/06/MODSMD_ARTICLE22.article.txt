Social Regulations for Men
Editor, The Daily:
We are two of the men who advocate social
regulations for Malcolm Maddy. Some people are
obviously overlooking ttie fact that Malcolm Mod
dy is human. While an understandable mistake,
this opinion should here be refuted. Therefore,
the idea of social regulations for men is a valid
one. He is after an education and likes to study.
Therefore, men should be prohibited from throw
ing rocks after 10:30. Or even 8:30.
On the subject of phone calls. We suggest that
Malcolm be given a private telephone number
lhat «.o one could dial. This way he could avoid
those wrong numbers which distract from his
study time.
Since are in the minority, it is only
fnir that all men have as few dates as Malcolm.
Social regulations for men would leave the way
open for faculty members who are older and
need it more. It's only fair.
We unanimously quiver to think what would
happen, but, would the parents of Stanford men
send their sons to a Stanford where drunken
women were constantly throwing rocks at the

men's dormitories. Or to any Stanford for that
matter. We, toi one, have no idea. Hut maybe.
Or not».

Increased Restrictions
Editor, The Daily:
We have read with interesl the lelter from
Marsha Bodger, Sonja Soehnel and Linda Thomp
son printed Jan. 30, proposing changes in girls'
social regulations.
We believe, however, that Ihe extreme imma
turity and general misunderstanding of proper
social conduct by most Stanford women not only
makes these social regulations imperative but
should point out the need for more restriction.
If Stanford is ever to regain her once promi
nent social position, she must open her eyes to
the many immoral practices caused by too liberal
social regulations.
We realize the truth in these words will of
fend many eats, but we must forget foolish pride
and rid ourselves of this scandalous situation.
