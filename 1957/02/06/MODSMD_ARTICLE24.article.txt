## Annual Series of Discussions Started To Pave Way for Informed Alumni 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Until Stanford students
knew little about activities and
policy making of Stanford's ad
ministrators and educators.
Alumni were kept up to date
concerning University growth and
projects through such groups as
the"Know Your Stanford Com
mil tee" of the Stanford Associ
ates, but the students weren't in
formed.
Driven .by the curiosity of how
Stanford policies are made and
why, Steve Horn, T>3, then student
business manager (now working
for his I J h.l>. in the Political Sci
ence Dept.) inquired into the pos
sibility of having someone give
the students the same type of in
formation that the alumni were
getting, lie felt that the begin
ning of alumni information should
be given while students are here
on campus and still personally
concerned with University func
tions.
A group of students, faculty
and administrators united efforts
with the Stanford Associates and
formulated ;i plan for presenting
this information to students by
having those in a position at the
top speak to them and give them
an opportunity to ask questions.

The program, designed to give
the plans anil policies of Stanford
for both the present and the fu
ture, is "Stanford Today and To
morrow." The first series, under
Walt Menninger, stressed academ
ics, building and land, and fi
nances.
Those men who knew most
about each of the topics met with
students in living groups and dis
cussed these facets of University,
life with thcin. Since the 19. r )2
series, topics have broadened
greatly to include such questions
as enrollment, admissions frater
nities and tuition.
"Stanford Today and Tomor
row" is now a committee of stu
dents, faculty and administrators,
run by the students under the di
rection of Helen Nebeker. Until
last year positions on the commit
tee were by invitation only, but
tryouts now determine committee
members.

The 19.77 series begins today
with an evening program for
freshmen. Each Wednesday this
month several living groups will
meet with the speakers, including
President Wallace Sterling, the
deans, top faculty members and
administrators. Student commit
tee members will act as moder
ators.
This year more students than
ever will have the chance to meet
with the men who run the Uni
versity. All living groups have
been invited to participate in Ihe
program. Off - campus students
may attend any meetings.
Students are invited to ask ques
tions of the speakers. The com
mittee feels that only through this
direct contact with Stanford poli
cies will its ultimate goal mak
ing students better-informed alum
ni be obtained.

Alumni were kept up to date
concerning University growth and
projects through such groups as
the"Know Your Stanford Com
mil tee" of the Stanford Associ
ates, but the students weren't in
formed.
Driven .by the curiosity of how
Stanford policies are made and
why, Steve Horn, T>3, then student
business manager (now working
for his I J h.l>. in the Political Sci
ence Dept.) inquired into the pos
sibility of having someone give
the students the same type of in
formation that the alumni were
getting, lie felt that the begin
ning of alumni information should
be given while students are here
on campus and still personally
concerned with University func
tions.
A group of students, faculty
and administrators united efforts
with the Stanford Associates and
formulated ;i plan for presenting
this information to students by
having those in a position at the
top speak to them and give them
an opportunity to ask questions.

The program, designed to give
the plans anil policies of Stanford
for both the present and the fu
ture, is "Stanford Today and To
morrow." The first series, under
Walt Menninger, stressed academ
ics, building and land, and fi
nances.
Those men who knew most
about each of the topics met with
students in living groups and dis
cussed these facets of University,
life with thcin. Since the 19. r )2
series, topics have broadened
greatly to include such questions
as enrollment, admissions frater
nities and tuition.
"Stanford Today and Tomor
row" is now a committee of stu
dents, faculty and administrators,
run by the students under the di
rection of Helen Nebeker. Until
last year positions on the commit
tee were by invitation only, but
tryouts now determine committee
members.

The 19.77 series begins today
with an evening program for
freshmen. Each Wednesday this
month several living groups will
meet with the speakers, including
President Wallace Sterling, the
deans, top faculty members and
administrators. Student commit
tee members will act as moder
ators.
This year more students than
ever will have the chance to meet
with the men who run the Uni
versity. All living groups have
been invited to participate in Ihe
program. Off - campus students
may attend any meetings.
Students are invited to ask ques
tions of the speakers. The com
mittee feels that only through this
direct contact with Stanford poli

ing students better-informed alum
ni be obtained.
