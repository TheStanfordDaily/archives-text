Stanford's freshman basketball team, 42-40 losers to the Univer
sity of California frosh Jan. 8, should have no trouble whipping the
Hear Cubs in the Washington's Birthday battle here.
Scholastic difficulties have cut six hoopsters off the California
freshman squad. With the completion of semester exams at the
Berkeley campus Jan. 25, three regulars and three reserves became
ineligible.
Two of tile reserves have since transferred out of the Univer
sity of California. Though still at Berkeley, starting' guard and
third high point maker Witlo >lc< iillough is ineligible and bis loss
should burl the Bear ( übs.
Also missing through ineligibility will be two frosh trackmen and
two frosh baseballers.
At Cal the grading system seems to discriminate against rather
than for the athlete as ordinary students need only a straight (' aver
age to participate in extracurricular activities but athletes need to
pass five times as many units as they flunk.
Thus an athlete could get A's in four courses and still be in
eligible it lie flunked bis fifth one.
Look for the University of Oregon, presently embedded in the
Pacific Coast Conference cellar, to move uphill next year. Coach
Don Kirseh's Webfoot 'frosh have netted eight wins this year against
no losses.
Hut, then, up at Seattle, things look even rosier. The University
of Washington yearlings are undefeated after- 13 games. Height the
Washington young Huskies do nol have. Skill they do. Top man is
6-3 center Earle Irvine who is averaging 20-plus markers a game
and holds the Washington freshman single game scoring record of
ii'.), bucketed against Sand Point Naval Air Station Jan. 25.
The entire 19-man I W frosh squad, save one lowly reserve,
prepped within the state of Washington. They have posted a 95-76
win over the highly rated Seattle University freshmen, the highest
score any Washington team has ever made against Seattle IJ.
High scores are lire Pups' specially as they have averaged about
SO points a game to their foes' 66. Backing up Irvine, the ex-Lincoln
(Wash.) all-stater, on the Pup first five are high-scoring forwards
Al Murphy and Ron Crowe, and guards George Grant and Hob
Johnson.
Tie in the outstanding frosh team with a Washington varsity that
will have II of the first 12 men returning next winter and you have
an inkling of why Coach Tippy Dye isn't exactly singing the blues.
The present varsity has won seven of eight conference games,
causing Dye to forecast a PCC title this year, so you take it from
there. Seattle fans are looking ahead a hit and forecasting the
Husky eagers will he challenging the Kansas .layhavvks for the
national championship next winter.
Washington's new football coach Jim Owens and Cal's latest, Pete
Elliott, are remarkably similar in background and opinions. Both
are young men (each is 30), both formerly played and coached in
the Midwest i Elliott gridded at Michigan and mentored at Nebraska,
Owens al Oklahoma and Texas A&M) and both stress academics as
well al athletics.
"An education is the most important thing a boy can get oul of
college," said Owens on arriving at Seattle last week. "In modern
football a player must be able to think quickly. The day of the 'alh
let ic bum' is past."
Owens emphasized the educational facilities at Washington
were one of the main reasons he took the job (aside from a $15,000
salary). Apparently believing what he says, though, Owens ma
jored in law at Oklahoma and has had l'» years of law school.
Elliolt is also an ex-Oklahoma man, having worked for five years
as Pud Wilkinson's assistant, before his orie-year stay at Nebraska.
Elliott feels thai football need not interfere with academics.
The most successful teams he has been associated with also have
been the smartest, Elliott has said, lie himself was no brain in
school, but no dunce either, averaging 2. I at the University of
Michigan.
lie did stand out on the playing field, though, winning four
letlers each in football, basketball and golf, liis record of I'd let
ters still stands av an Ann Arbor record.
West coast fans may remember him as the single-wing quarter
back who helped lead Ihe 49-0 1948 Rose Bowl win over Southern Cal
or' as the brother of Michigan's All-American halfback Chalmers
("Bumps") Elliott.
In golf, Elliott once decisioned Ifarvie Ward, later a national ama
teur champ. Ilis old football coach at Michigan, Ihe great "Fritz"
Crisler, has called Pete "a great strategist and excellent teacher.
One of his greatest qualities is his kpeh ability to get across to his
players."
No less an authoritv than Wilkinson has said of Elliott: "He
is a great coach with a fine persoanlily. Pete has great integrity,
works hard and has a keen understanding of the problems of the
individual player."

High scores are lire Pups' specially as they have averaged about

Washington's new football coach Jim Owens and Cal's latest, Pete
Elliott, are remarkably similar in background and opinions. Both
are young men (each is 30), both formerly played and coached in
the Midwest i Elliott gridded at Michigan and mentored at Nebraska,
Owens al Oklahoma and Texas A&M) and both stress academics as
well al athletics.
"An education is the most important thing a boy can get oul of
college," said Owens on arriving at Seattle last week. "In modern
football a player must be able to think quickly. The day of the 'alh
let ic bum' is past."
Owens emphasized the educational facilities at Washington
were one of the main reasons he took the job (aside from a $15,000
salary). Apparently believing what he says, though, Owens ma
jored in law at Oklahoma and has had l'» years of law school.
Elliolt is also an ex-Oklahoma man, having worked for five years
as Pud Wilkinson's assistant, before his orie-year stay at Nebraska.
Elliott feels thai football need not interfere with academics.
The most successful teams he has been associated with also have
been the smartest, Elliott has said, lie himself was no brain in
school, but no dunce either, averaging 2. I at the University of
Michigan.
lie did stand out on the playing field, though, winning four
letlers each in football, basketball and golf, liis record of I'd let

West coast fans may remember him as the single-wing quarter
back who helped lead Ihe 49-0 1948 Rose Bowl win over Southern Cal
or' as the brother of Michigan's All-American halfback Chalmers
("Bumps") Elliott.
In golf, Elliott once decisioned Ifarvie Ward, later a national ama
teur champ. Ilis old football coach at Michigan, Ihe great "Fritz"
Crisler, has called Pete "a great strategist and excellent teacher.
One of his greatest qualities is his kpeh ability to get across to his
players."
No less an authoritv than Wilkinson has said of Elliott: "He
is a great coach with a fine persoanlily. Pete has great integrity,
works hard and has a keen understanding of the problems of the
individual player."
