# COACH'S INNOVATION
## WSC to Use Two Teams Against Indian Cagers 
### Bob Payne 
Two-platoon basketball, an Innovation Of Washington Stale Coach j
Jack Friel, will be tested against the hustling, ball-hawking play of j â– 
Coach Howie Dallmar's Stanford Indians this weekend when the |
two teams square off at Hie Pavilion.
Friel, in bis 29th year as head man at Cougarville, is generally j

credited with originating the idea
of basketball substitution by
units. Larry Beck, the confer
ence's leading scorer, heads the
platoon which sees the most ac
tion. The chief purpose of the
second unit is to give the starters
a breather.
Top Coaching Record
Only seven college basketball
coaches stand ahead of Friel irr
games won during their careers,
and that list includes such men
tors as Phog Allen, Hank Iha and
Adolph Rupp. In 28 years at Pull
man, Friel's teams have won 472
games while losing 334, despite
Ihe recent bad seasons.
The Cougars haven't had a win
ning season since 1950 when a
lanky sophomore center named
Gene Conley paced them to ihe
Northern Division crown. This is
the same Conley of baseball fame
with the Milwaukee Braves. Fr iel
hasn't had a good big man since
big Gene and often has been
forced to try inexperienced soph
omores in an attempt to find a
good- combination.
Paul Ronhaar, (i-6 sophomore,
is the big man in this year's at
tack. Ronhaar beat out a pair of
veterans, 6-7 Bill Galbraith and
6-5 Bruce Olson, who had been
rated ahead of him at the season's
start. Superior rebounding skill
won out for Ronhaar as he had
scored only 43 points in eight
games.
Smallest Guards in Loop
The Cougars have the smallest
pair of guards in the loop in 5-7
Jim Ross and 5-11 Dick Rask.
Both have seven-point averages.
Rask worked his way into a starl
ing role last season as u sopho
more and has followed Beck in
scoring all season.
Teaming with Beck to give
WSC on&rof the biggest sets of
forwards in the loop is 6-3 sopho
more Jerry Spanner. Beck tips
ihe scales at 215 pounds while
Spanner, a 26-year-old Air Force
veteran, weighs 210 pounds.
Mainly because of the presence
of Ross, Stanford will finally go
into a game with a height advan
tage . . . but a small one. Both
Friel and Dallmar have had their
troubles this season trying to find
good backboard strength.
