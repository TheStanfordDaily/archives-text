When the Staniord Papooses
take the Pavilion floor against the
University of Santa Clara fresh
men Friday night they will be
counting on a speed advantage to
help them conquer the visitors.
Greater height, usually an attri
bute of the local hoopsters, be
longs to ihe invaders, who aver
age over 6-5. Santa Clara, too,
has been rated "fast for its size,"
but local opinion has given the
Papooses an advantage in this
area.
Going into the game, the Santa
Clara men will sport an 8-1 record
which includes wins over San Jose
J.C. and Lowell Hi g h School,
early-season Stanford foes.
Lowell nearly tripped the visi
tor's, taking them into overtime
before giving up. The frosh found
the going easier with the high
school squad, winning 71-57.
Santa Clara is rated with the
College of the Pacific freshmen
as the best teams in the area;
t he i r only loss came at COP
hands. The squad is led in the
shooting department by 6-6 for
ward Frank Sobrero, a left-handed
.jump shooter.
Coach Dick Clegg has said that
his squad is preparing for Santa
Clara by working from the speed
angle. With the height competi
tion which the visitors will pre
sent, he feels that this is Uic
locals' best offensive and defen
sive measure.
Game time for the Santa Clara
tilt is set for 6 p.m.
