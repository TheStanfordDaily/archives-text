### 
LOS ANGELES, Fob. 5
The Pacific Coast Conference to
day disclosed it had concluded all
discussions and contracts for con
tinuing the Rose Bowl football
game under present arrangements
for an indefinite period of time,
according to PCC' Commissioner
Victor O. Schmidt.
As a result, teams representing
the Western Conference (the Big
Ten) and PCC will continue to
meet in the Rose Bowl on New
Year's Day for an indefinite pe
riod or until one of the confer
ences gives notice of termination.
This notice must be given suf
ficiently far in advance to permit
playing of at least two additional
Rose Bowl games after the notice
lias been given. A similar "open
end" contract is held by the PCC
with the Pasadena Tournament of
Roses, which controls the Rose
Bowl Stadium.
An "open-end" clause was also
incorporated in to the contract
with the National Broadcasting
Company, which continues to
have exclusive rights to radio and
television.
Continued in the new contract
is the "no-repeat" principle where
by no team can play in the Rose
Bowl two years in succession.
