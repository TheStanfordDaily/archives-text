# Stanford Drive To Aid Students Through WUS
## Program to Promote World-wide Education, Health, Housing Aid 
### 
One-third of funds being col
lected this week by Winter Quar
ter Drives Committee will be ear
marked for use by university stu
dents throughout the world.
World University Service will
receive a third of Stanford funds
collected for it, as well as the Red
Cross and the Community Chest.
WUS is sponsored jointly by the
national associations of B'nai
B'rith Hillel, Newman, National
Student Association and United
Student Christian Council.
Set up in 1936 to aid Chinese
students after the Japanese at
tack. WUS now helps promote cdÂ»
ueation the world over by giving
aid in four main categories: indi
vidual, housing, health and educa
tional equipment.
Special Collection
Last fall WUS took up a special
collection' for Hungarian student
relief since ils ordinary budget
had already been allotted. Stan
ford students contributed some
$300 to this special project.
"While the Hungarian situation
was spectacular, there are many
situations in 4 the world which
need help just as quickly, if not
more so," said Morrie Blumberg
of the WUS office in Los Angeles.
He pointed out the urgent sit
uation in Hong Kong, to which
four universities moved after the
Communist regime took over
most of China.
"Classes meet in shacks, while
the only living accommodations
are 6x6 huts made of wooden
frames and flattened tin cans,"
Blumberg said. "Water hydrants
are a fourth of a mile away and
each family is rationed to one
bucket of water a day for all pur
poses."
Students are without money
and at present the WUS is feed
ing all of them. Every dollar
given to WUS will buy about $50
worth of U.S. surplus food, Blum
berg said.
Limited Equipment
At University of Saigon in Viet
Nam, a WUS official found that
the entire set of equipment for
the medical school was limited to
one microscope and one balance.
These had to serve 300 students
for their entire time spent in med
ical school. Thus WUS furnishes
needed equipment.
At Calcutta WUS is building
dormitories in an attempt to put
a roof over the heads of 3000
homeless students, who literally
have to sleep on sidewahks.
World Health Organization re
ports that nearly 5000 students in
Japan need immediate hospitali
zation for tuberculosis and anoth
er 18,000 have mild TB which will
become acute if not treated. WUS
is helping to supply medical
equipment such as X-ray ma
chines.
Karachi students were "on the
ball." They got the Pakistan gov
ernment to agree to give double
the amount which the students
could raise. So, when WUS gave
$10,000 the government chipped
in twice that amount.
Pump Priming
Then the students approached
local b us in e s s m en and said,
"Look, why can't you do some
thing for us if foreigners can?"
Businessmen gave $30,000 and the
government was then stuck for j
$60,000. "The pump-priming as- i
I >ect of WUS is very important,"
Blumberg noled.
WUS also sees to it that books
and clothing contributed, to Stan
ford International Relief Organi
zation reach their destination.
WUS feels that in order to con
tinue with a free world it is vital
that as many as possible receive
educations. And by helping these I
students to help themselves WUS]
hopes to promote a freer world, i
