### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (UP)
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles, rejecting any thought of
resigning, strongly defended his
Middle Eastern policies today. He
predicted that history will judge
them as honorable and sound.
The secretary also told his first
news conference since Dec. 18 that
he still believed an American visit
by Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia
would be useful. But he said a
date for the now-stalled visit had
never been set.
Dulles has been under heavy
attack from congressional Demo
crats, who have forced a review
of the course followed by the Unit
ed States in Hie Middle East since
1946.
Tito Visit
The proposed Tito visit also has
stirred up ;i storm of congres
sional opposition. As a result,
plans for the independent-minded
Communist leader to come here
have been temporarily shelved.
Dulles did not appear greatly
disturbed by the criticism he has
drawn, including demands that he
resign. lie said lie had no present
plans to leave his post.
Dulles also voiced no concern
over the Senate's delay in approv
ing the "Eisenhower- Doctrine" to
use U.S. dollars and troops, if
necessary, to prevent Communist
aggression in the Middle East.
Psychological Effect
He said the delay may have
weakened the psychological effect
of the resolution somewhat. But:
he said everyone recognizes that
Congress has not been following
dilatory tactics.
Discussing the Democratic at
tacks on his policies, Dulles said
they resembled those heard dur
ing last year's campaign and were
no more bitter than is traditional
in American politics.
