# Israel's Soil Reveals Bible Study Material
## 
### 
"The soil of Israel reveals a
mass of archaeological material
for study of the Bible and the
ancient world," said Avraham Bi
ran, last night's Tuesday Series
speaker, in his lecture "Digging
for History in Israel."
Hi ran, (lie Los Angeles Consul
General of Israel, pointed out two
recent archaeological events that
he said have caught the imagina
tion of the people of Israel. The
publication of Hie seventh scroll
of the Dead Sea Scrolls, known
to archaeologists as the Genesis
Apocrypha, revealed an elabora
tion on the Rook of Genesis.
An archaeological survey of the
Sinai Peninsula, in an attempt to
trace the route of the exodus of
the Israelites from Kgypt. re
suited in the discovery of a fort
ress which is believed to have
been the most important camp of
the Israelites during the 40 years'
wandering of Biblical fame.
"II is only once in a lifetime
wh en an archaeologist finds
enough proof to satisfy the skep
tics," Hi ran said. But he empha
sized that attempts to prove the
historical truth of Bible incidents
have resulted in a "veracity of all
tradition which is indeed amaz
ing."
nil aii showed several slides of
excavations which archaeologists
have agreed upon as the actual
sites ol places mentioned in the
Bible, tic also showed a number
of slides of pottery, mosaics and
other works of art which were re
covered from these excavations.
