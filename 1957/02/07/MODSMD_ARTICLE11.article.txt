# Ike Warns of Possible Controls on Inflation
## President to Call for Legislation On Wages, Prices, 'If Necessary' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UP)â€”President Eisenhower warned today
that the government will have to move in with "controls of some
kind" it business and labor refuse to hold the wage-price line against
inflation.
Urging both sides again to act voluntarily, he said that when the

government begins "to control I
prices and allocations and wages
and all the rest, then it is not the
America we know."
Eisenhower raised his threat of
"firm" intervention at a news
conference. He also said that
more oil must be shipped to fuel
hungry Europe and reported
progress toward peace in the Mid
dle East.
As Strong as Ever
Discussing the Communist
threat, he said the United States
is as strong now as it ever has
been in time of peace. At the
same time, he said, the likelihood
of a Soviet attack on the United
States grows less each year as all
nations realize that full-scale war
would be "suicide."
Eisenhower opened the news
conference by announcing the
resignation of Arthur S. Flem
ming as Defense Mobilizer and
the appointment of Assistant De
fense Secretary Gordon Gray as
his successor. Flemming has
been a Presidential economic ad
viser.
His remarks on inflation came
shortly afterward when a report
er referred to the President's
State of the Union message in
which Eisenhower urged business
and labor to exercise "self-disci
pline" and base wage-price in
creases on "productivity."
Enlightened Americans
"I wasn't merely asking them
to be altruistic by any manner or
means," Eisenhower said. "Their
own long-term good is involved,
and I am asking them merely to
act as enlightened Americans.
"Now, unless this happens, the
United States then has to move in
more firmly with so-called con
trols of some kind. . . .
"I believe any intelligent man
can see the direction we will have
to go, unless there is some wis
dom exercised not only in govern
ment but throughout the whole
economy."
As for the Middle East, Eisen
hower predicted that Israel will
withdraw her forces from the
Gaza Strip and Egyptian territory
in accordance with United Na
tions demands. Questioned about
sanctions if Israel does *ot with
draw, the President said only that
this country supports the UN.
He said the visit here of King
Saud of Saudi Arabia had in
creased chances of "keeping a
peaceful and maybe eventually a
united Mideast." He said Saud's
visit had cleared away an "under
brush of misunderstanding."
