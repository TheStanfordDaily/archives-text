# House Passes Soil Bank Bill; Benson Objects
## Republican Heads Fail To Press Secretary's Fight Against Measure 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UP)—
The House brushed aside admin
istration protests today and
passed a "baby soil bank" bill
drafted by Democrats to aid
drought-stricken ranchers.
The measure was approved by
a 270*t0-108 roll call vote after
Republican leaders failed to press
Agriculture Secretary Ezra T.
Benson's fight against it.
The bill would authorize fed
eral "rental payments" to ranch
ers who agree to keep livestock
off parched lands. Its
purpose was to prevent perma
nent damage to pastures in the
Southwestern drought belt.
Before the vote, House Repub
lican Leader Joseph W. Martin
Jr. (Mass.) read a letter from
Benson protesting that the bill
would "create more problems
than it solves." But otherwise
Martin made no attempt to pre
vent its passage.
Goes to Senate
The measure now goes to the
Senate where it has the backing
of Democratic Leader Lyndon B.
Johnson (Tex.). Martin said the
administration would try to "cor
rect" it before the Senate votes.
Benson had urged the House to
postpone any drought • relief ac
tion until the administration
made its own recommendations,
which he said would be forth
corning soon. But he was able to
obtain only a 36-hour delay in pas
sage of the measure.
Benson contended the rental
plan would be difficult if not im
possible to administer and would
benefit wealthy ranchers and ab
sentee land owners instead of
small-scale cattle raisers.
"More Flexibility"
The House acted as Benson was
testifying before the Senate Agri
culture Committee in favor of
"more flexibility" in the farm
price support system.
The "baby soil bank" plan ap
proved by the HoUse did not
specify the amount of rental pay
ment other than to say it should
not be below the average for the
country. Sponsors of the meas
ure estimated the payments
would average $1 to $1.25 an
acre.
Only farmers and ranchers in
localities designated by the gov
ernment as "major disaster
areas" would be eligible for the
payments.
