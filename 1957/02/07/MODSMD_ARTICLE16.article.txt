A CONSTITUTION a!, AMENDMENT making ex-Pres
identa and presidential candidate losers mem
bers of the Senate was hearlily defended by
Stanford law professor Lawrence F. Ebb, one
of its originators, earlier this week.
"It £%?ems obvious some change must he
made," he said. "Big and rich as we are, we
cannot afford to waste the talent available to
us, especially in this time of international
crisis."
Though there is some talent in the ex-Presi
dent and ex-candidate categories, we believe
that the amendment's had points outweigh the
advantages it might offer to the country.
The amendment would give a four-year term
as senator-a't-large to the person who receives
the second highest number of votes for Presi
dent in the most recent election for that office.
We hold that this is a violation of the prin
ciple that a legislature is a body of men elected
by the people and directly responsible to them.

The senator-at-large would be elected by no
one; in lad, a defeat by the people of ihe
country would be the very thing that would
put him in office. He would answer to no one
but his own self-interests for four years.
There is no assurance that the losing presi
dential candidate, nominated by a convention
and not elected by the people, would be of any
higher caliber than a regularly elected senator.
If the man is the proven caliber that the
amendment intimates he is, then let him run
for the Senate from his home slate and let the
people decide for themselves.
One purpose in the amendment is perpetu
ating the losing candidate in the people's eyes
merely till the next election. The senator-at
large would merely use the office as a campaign
platform for the next four years until the next
convention.
Let the Stevensons and Deweys make their
own way in the political world, rather than
being given a consolation prize.
