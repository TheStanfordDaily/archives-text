## Expansion Program Criticized 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The University is at present in the process of
converting large areas of the country surround
ing the campus into housing developments, fac
tories and a veterans' mental hospital (or insane
asylum, if you are unprogressive).
Now it cannot be argued that the University's
surroundings are enhanced by this (some may
even think that the opposite is the case); the pro
gram's justification, hence, must be looked for
in the increased revenue which it brings the Uni
versity, and in what that increased revenue ac
complishes.
Stanford, we know, is very poor (so poor, in
fact, that it has been forced to abandon the
original construction program worked out with
Mrs. Stanford in favor of cheap utilitarian con
st! action); so presumably these proceeds from
land development are a real help, enabling the
University to do what it eds.
But is this thee? " mammoth construc
tion program is. 1 e sun.-, impressive. But is
it necessary? Is it 30 necessary as to justify sur
rounding Stanford with factories and housing
developments?
Take the Medical School, which, for lo these
many years, has been thriving in San Francisco,
conveniently located with regard to other insti
tutions and supply of raw material; why is it
now so advantageous to build a whole new Stan
ford Hospital on the campus?
Why is that ensemble of concrete boxes, Wil
bur, built, while Encina's five stories go idle and
unused (surely the old hall is not hopelessly be
yond safety standards, or has not suddenly be
come such; it seems to have been acceptably safe
for several score of years)?
To the extent that the building program is
one of tearing down and rebuilding, or replacing,
it reflects a lack of permanency in planning and
construction; to the extent that it represents en
largement to meet the needs of a larger student
body, it may be pointed out that such would not
be needed were the caliber of the student body
raised by higher entrance standards; that is, were

Ihe aim of Stanford more directed at the educa
tion of quality than quantity than it at present is.
Perhaps, indeed, largeness brings more advan
tages to a university than comparative small
ness; possibly, even to the student. At any rate,
far be it from me to question the judgment of
a great university in which more money is ap
propriated to football-game card stunts than to
debate activities (with the result that the debate
team is prevented from attending most tourna
ments to which it is invited).
It is just that at times one gets the impression
that some questionable aspects may exist.

Why is that ensemble of concrete boxes, Wil
bur, built, while Encina's five stories go idle and
unused (surely the old hall is not hopelessly be
yond safety standards, or has not suddenly be
come such; it seems to have been acceptably safe
for several score of years)?
To the extent that the building program is
one of tearing down and rebuilding, or replacing,
it reflects a lack of permanency in planning and
construction; to the extent that it represents en
largement to meet the needs of a larger student
body, it may be pointed out that such would not
be needed were the caliber of the student body
raised by higher entrance standards; that is, were

Ihe aim of Stanford more directed at the educa
tion of quality than quantity than it at present is.
Perhaps, indeed, largeness brings more advan
tages to a university than comparative small
ness; possibly, even to the student. At any rate,
far be it from me to question the judgment of
a great university in which more money is ap
propriated to football-game card stunts than to
debate activities (with the result that the debate
team is prevented from attending most tourna
ments to which it is invited).
It is just that at times one gets the impression
that some questionable aspects may exist.

The University is at present in the process of
converting large areas of the country surround
ing the campus into housing developments, fac
tories and a veterans' mental hospital (or insane
asylum, if you are unprogressive).
Now it cannot be argued that the University's
surroundings are enhanced by this (some may
even think that the opposite is the case); the pro
gram's justification, hence, must be looked for
in the increased revenue which it brings the Uni
versity, and in what that increased revenue ac
complishes.
Stanford, we know, is very poor (so poor, in
fact, that it has been forced to abandon the
original construction program worked out with
Mrs. Stanford in favor of cheap utilitarian con
st! action); so presumably these proceeds from
land development are a real help, enabling the
University to do what it eds.
But is this thee? " mammoth construc
tion program is. 1 e sun.-, impressive. But is
it necessary? Is it 30 necessary as to justify sur
rounding Stanford with factories and housing
developments?
Take the Medical School, which, for lo these
many years, has been thriving in San Francisco,
conveniently located with regard to other insti
tutions and supply of raw material; why is it
now so advantageous to build a whole new Stan
ford Hospital on the campus?
