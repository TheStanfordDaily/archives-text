# Letters in Poor Taste

### 
Editor, The Daily:
1 read with interest and growing amazement
the two letters on social regulations printed Wed
nesday morning and 1 feel that some rather defi
nite reply is required to all four of the writers.
The first one, by Messrs. Hammer and Ralph,
concerned itself far more with Malcolm Maddy
lhan anything else, so much so 1 hat it seemed to
me in very poor taste to print it. But through
the great satire, which had all the subtlety of a
Sherman tank and about as much consideration,
one could faintly discern the point being made
that limiting hours is not the way lo get an edu
cation. One could also see through the meaning
less verbiage principle that closing the dor
mitories will not, ipso facto, have any beneficial
effect on either morals or grades. With these
two points 1 can only agree.
As to the second letter, I feel that the women
at Stanford must answer, and do so immediately.
Messrs. Byles and Curtis not only are attacking
the women here, they are outrightly insulting the
University. This University has' spent many
hours choosing the most qualified women it
could, and I may remind that aptitude is not even
half of the determining factor in admission. With
the choice it has in the women to admit, it would
certainly not bring many hero who did not under
stand proper social conduct, and it would not
kepp any who did not for long.
