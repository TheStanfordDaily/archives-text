# IN-THE-ROUND STAGING
## Opera Ring Players Perform Brilliantly in 'Street Scene' 
### Richard Lamb 
In its current production of Kurt
Weill's "Street Scene," the Opera
Ring in San Francisco has a
worthy successor to "The Golden
Apple" and"The Threepenny Op
era," which the group performed
brilliantly last season.
Irma Kay, a talented lady who
produced and directed ihe show,
knows what to do with an arena
type theater and has come up with
some of the most exciting in the
round staging yet seen in these
parts. If you've never seen any
ul Miss Kay's work, catch "Street
Scene." it is musical Little Thea
ter at its seldom-seen best.
"Street Scene" is not really an
opera. It is a musical tragedy,
based on Elmer Kice's play of life
in a New York tenement district.
But, except for brief spoken pas
sages, the dialogue is sung, re
quiring voices of operatic caliber
to handle Weill's demanding score.
Skilled Voices
Fortunately, ihe Opera Ring has
ihe voices as well as several ac
tors and actresses of considerable
skill. Particularly outstanding are
June Purviance, a gifted young
comedienne, as the leader of ihe
neighborhood gossip circle; Mary
MeMahon as Mrs. Fiorenlino, a
real trouper with a marvelous
sense of timing.
Louise and .lames Oldt, husband
and wife on stage and off, who
best project ihe tension of im
pending violence; Stanford junior
Stan Throneberry, who gives a
touching performance as Sam
Kaplan, a serious-minded young
man whose loneliness succumbs to
love; Ardyce Slein as Mrs. Olsen;
Lorraine Roche as Shirley Kap
lan; Robert Romanovsky as Abra
ham Kaplan; Hal Williams, Vir
ginia Kae, Connell McCary, Mil
dur Mahl, Barbara Kelso and
Keith Fowler, who give thought
ful interpretations to lesser roles.
Stanford Graduate
Kean Anderson Mantius, Stan
ford '56, sings beautifully and acts

| convincingly most of the lime in
the role of Rose, Ihe young gill
I with whom Sam falls in love. Bui
ial the climax of Ihe second act,
: when she comes home to find that
: her father has shot her mother
iri a jealous rage, and everyone on
stage turns to see her reaction,
she scarcely reacts at all. As a
result the meaning of the moment
escapes Ihe audience because she
: does not seem to l»e aware of ii
herself
Miss Kay's fling at ehoreogra
phy in one or Iwo spots shows
less imagination Ihan the simple,
striking movements of Ihe crowd
! scenes.
Costumes and settings a I Ihe
| Opera Ring are as fine as you will
see al any Little Theater, nol
! withstanding a low budget.
This is the West Coast premiere
of "Si ieel Scene," which was pre
| sented in New York sever al sea
sons back.

"Street Scene" is not really an
opera. It is a musical tragedy,
based on Elmer Kice's play of life
in a New York tenement district.
But, except for brief spoken pas
sages, the dialogue is sung, re
quiring voices of operatic caliber
to handle Weill's demanding score.
Skilled Voices
Fortunately, ihe Opera Ring has
ihe voices as well as several ac
tors and actresses of considerable
skill. Particularly outstanding are
June Purviance, a gifted young
comedienne, as the leader of ihe
neighborhood gossip circle; Mary
MeMahon as Mrs. Fiorenlino, a
real trouper with a marvelous
sense of timing.
Louise and .lames Oldt, husband
and wife on stage and off, who
best project ihe tension of im
pending violence; Stanford junior
Stan Throneberry, who gives a
touching performance as Sam
Kaplan, a serious-minded young
man whose loneliness succumbs to
love; Ardyce Slein as Mrs. Olsen;
Lorraine Roche as Shirley Kap
lan; Robert Romanovsky as Abra
ham Kaplan; Hal Williams, Vir
ginia Kae, Connell McCary, Mil
dur Mahl, Barbara Kelso and
Keith Fowler, who give thought
ful interpretations to lesser roles.
