## Cards Aim for Revenge Alter Upset Loss; WSC Unable to Find Second Consistent Scorer

As might be expected, stopping I
conference scoring leader Larry j
Beck is the biggest problem con
fronting Coach Howie Dallmar as
h<* prepares his Indians for this
week's series with Washington
Slate.
Las! season Beck pumped in 64
points in l wo g;imes against Stan
ford as Ihe clubs split ;i pair in
Pullman. He scored .'{o on the
first nigh! although his team fell,
SI 70, and came back the follow
ing evening with 2X counters to
pace a 09-07 upset of the Cards.
That victory was one of just two i
conference triumphs last season
lot Ihe Cougars as I hey finished
I heir worst season in history.
"Last year we couldn't even
â€¢ lop Beck wilh Barry Brown, who
was a line defensive man,"
warned Dallmar. "You can give
him (Beck) his 2.~> points, but
when lie gels more than that . . . i
you're in trouble. We found lhat j
oiii last year."
I,ends by 24
Berk has scored 183 points in i
Ihe Cougars' eight conference
lilts this season, putting him 24
ahead of Stanford's Bill Bond for
Ihe loop leadership. Bui Bond
will be a definite threat to Beck |
during Ihe second half of the sea
son. The Card ace has increased
his scoring average more than six
points in Ihe past five games and
shows no signs of letting up. Dall
mar has termed the clash of the
two aces a sure "scoring classic."
The Cougars have been unable
In find any consistent scorer to
back up Beck this season. Guard
Dick I task ranks second in scor
ing with only 7)~> poinls. Paul Ron
haar, 0 0 center, has cashed in
on only 43 points in eight games
and trails reserve pi vot m a n
Bruce < )lson, who has 40 points.
Two Surprises
Two pleasant surprises in the i
Cougar attack have been 5-71
guard Jim Ross and 5-11 Mert j
Kennedy, both sophomores. Ross j
apparently has won Ihe first
siring job from Kennedy and has |
<1!) points in seven games. Ken
nedy, despite his small size, has
been one of the team's leading re- j
bounders.
Sophomore John Pflueger.l
sixth man most of the season for
Ihe Indians, returned to the court j
yeslerday for the first time in al- !
most a week. The 6-3 southpaw j
injured his ankle in practice last !
Thursday and was left home
when the club traveled to Oregon, j
Another sophomore, starter
Paul Neumann, was also hobbled i
by an ankle injury but appeared j
fully recovered last week against i
Ihe Webfools. Neuman'n ranks;
second to Bond in scoring for the ,
Tribe this season and has also j
been a tower of strength defen- j
sively . . . as have most of his j
mates.
