## 
### Dick Barnes 
John Pflueger, among (he most
promising sophomores on ihe
Stanford varsity, is looking for
ward to returning to action for
the Cards when they host the-
Washington State cagers this
weekend.
Late last week, the 6-3, 185-
pounder injured his ankle in prac-

tice and was forced to miss the
weekend series aaginst Oregon.
Pflueger is confident he'll he all
right by Friday night, although
Tribe coach Howie Dallmar has |
confined his practice activities
this week to just shooting
around.
While the Indians captured
both games against the Ducks,
they still missed the services of
Pflueger, who has been one of the
year's best surprise packages. He

]Ed last year's frosh team in scor
ing with a 1-4-point average, but
was still thought to he a hit too
short on experience to get in a
lot of playing time this year.
It hasn't taken him long to
move into the number six spot on
Da 11 ma r' s team, where he is
called upon frequently to play ei
ther forward or guard. Pflueger
uses his height to good advan
tage, and is also an excellent shot,
lie has also heen instrumental in
providing the Trihe with the
drive and hustle it has needed
this year.
Pflueger notes that while Stan
ford is pretty much out of cham
pionship running this year, the
Indians should still finish up fair
ly high in the standings. He looks
for a pair of wins this weekend
over WSC, hut foresees a rugged
battle next week a! UCLA.
Doug Smart, the (J-8 forward
from Washington, is the best
player Pflueger has seen this
year in PCX' action. He was also
impressed by Cal's (2a be Arrilla
ga in his two games against Stan
ford, but noted thai he has been
inconsistent against other teams.
Pflueger admitted that he "was
snowed by it all" when he played
his first varsity game, hut is now
in the swing of things. lie feels
his best game was during the va
cation against Tennessee, when
he got hot and hit for Mi points.
As far as next year is con
cerned, Pflueger expects the In
dians to be really good, and that
he and some of the other players
are "sort of figuring on winning
the championship."
