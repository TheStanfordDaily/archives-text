# Reno Empties Another Block In Blast Scare
## Sourer of Propane Fumes Still Unknown; Guardsmen Set Watch 
### 
RENO, Nov., Feb. 6 (I'D City
officials evacuated a block and a
half of large business buildings
in downtown Reno today as the
odor of propane gas fumes raised
fear of a repetition of yesterday's
disastrous explosions :=nd fire.
Fire Chief Karl Evans ordered
all persons away from at least
eight large buildings on South
Virginia Street, a block easl of
the scene of yesterday's tragedy
which killed two and injured
persons.
Buildings in the area included
the 11-story Mapes Hotel and the
six-story First National Bank and
Arcade buildings.
The Mapes Hotel was not evac
uated, but all guests and employ
ees were required to stay inside
the building and no one was per
mitted to enter.
Sentry Duty
National Guardsmen did sentry
duty at each end of the blocked
oil area as police and firemen
sought to discover the source of
the fumes.
Meanwntie, city employees, Na
tional Guardsmen and airmen
from Slead Air Force Base
cleared away smoking rubble at
First and Sierra streets in a
search for more possible victims
of yesterday's rending gas explo
sion.
The business block looked like
an air raid target at dawn today
with smoke still rising from the
ruins of five major buildings and
the street littered with broken
glass and rubble.
Buildings Destroyed
Listed as completely destroyed
wore the two-story Paterson de
partment store, the Elks Club
building, Gray - Reid department
store, the Bankers Trust building
and I lie Blitz building. Almost a
score of adjoining structures
were damaged to varying degrees.
Most, of them had only gaping
holes where their windows had
been.
Despite the fury of the triple
explosion from an underground
gas main, the death toll remained
at I wo. Officials credited the
amazingly low death list to the
alertness of several building own
ers who smelled the escaping gas
and rushed people out of the
structures seconds before the
first blast.
