# Summer School Planned in Mexico
## 
### 
A summer school will be held
I his year at the Mexico City Col
lege, according to Ronald Hilton,
director of Hispanic American
Studies. Although the program is
partly sponsored by Iho Hispanic
American Report, Hilton feels
that the government offices and
industries in Mexico would also
interest majors in engineering,
law and education.
An informal pilot group went
to Mexico City last summer, but
this is the first official year of
the program. There will be a par
allel program in English for those
who cannot speak Spanish.
The program, which will last
from July 1 to Aug. 9, will cost
about $200, including $90 tuition.
Living quarters will be in private!
homes.
Anyone interested in applying!
may contact Professor Hilton, I
Room 255.
