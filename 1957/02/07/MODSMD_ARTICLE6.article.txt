## Sterling Says Student Hotly To Be Kept at Present Level 
### 
"Our chances of maintaining and improving Stanford's high stand
ards will be enhanced il Ihe student body is kept at the same size,"
said University President J. E. Wallace Sterling last, night before a
group of freshmen attending the first meeting of the Stanford Today
and Tomorrow series.
"For the foreseeable future 1 think we will attempt to hold the

undergraduate number al its
present size of from 5300 through
5400," continued Sterling. "How
ever, the number of graduate stu
dents may increase."
The question of University ex
pansion of both student body and
facilities is of major importance
regarding Stanford's future. Ster
ling stressed that since a quality
job is most desirable, the Univer
sity must have a student body
size which can best be accommo
dated by a sound, progressive and
exciting curriculum.
Building Boom
Regarding the building boom
on campus ,Sterling said, "Not a
building is going up that doesn't
have a specific educational pur
pose,"
The building plan allows for a
maximum of space at a minimum
of cost. Instead of building new
buildings for offices and class
rooms, science buildings which
will be out of use following (he
completion of the new Science
Quad will be rehabilitated. Reha
bilitation of this type was done
on the buildings housing the
Deans' and Fnglish Department
of ices at a cost greatly lower than
that '>| new buildings, and with a
space increase of over 50 per cent.
$25 Million Operation
Stanford operates on a $25 mil
lion total financial operation, in
eluding development, endowment,
gifts and tuition "We're behind
in the amount of tuition re
ceived," said Sterling, lie pointed
out that the majority of private
institutions in Ihc U.S. have al
ready raised tuitions, and hinted
al "Ihc handwriting on the wall."
When asked whether the Uni
versify plans to expand its school
of education to include more tech
nologieal training. Sterling said
plans are for "growth in strength
rather than expansion in new
kinds of activily."
"Universities can't afford l<» in
dulge in the luxury of semi-isola
tion," said Stanford's president.
"Stanford has the opportunity of
enhancing its standing by work
ing to close the gap between Uni
versity and community through
public service."
Conferences II«'l«l
Several conferences have been
held to attract leadership in the
West in various phases of husi
ness and professions, such as the
tax and state government confer
ences held by the Law School re
cently.
(ioa I of present University
plans is to "grow strong rather
than to expand in size," concluded
Sterling.
Following his talk s I u d en Is
asked several questions regarding
University plans and policies.
Seven other S.T.&T. meetings
were held at Wilbur last night.
The talks will continue next
week.
