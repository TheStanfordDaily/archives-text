"My decision to join the All Stanford Tour rather than travel independently
was a good idea and I certainly would encourage and recommend this tour.
Financially, it was far cheaper to go with a group because that gave us group
rates. A guided tour means that you will see much more of Europe than
you ever would on your own. Without direction if is far too easy to waste
valuable time trying to find your destination and obtain hotel space. We
stopped in rural areas as well as in the larger cities. The Stanford Tour
familiarizes you with Europe in a way that is almost impossible to do other •
wise. And European travel is too greal an investment not to invest your
time and money wisely."
