•NEW YORK. Feb 7 (UP) —
Three scientists said today man
has absorbed only a fraction of
the maximum amount of stron
tium 90 his body can safely stand
from radioactive fallout, but that
the average is higher for children
and is rising for all age groups.
The scientists said such fallout
"produces both internal and exter
nal hazards to the human race"
They said the internal hazard
"is primarily the development of
bone cancer." The external hazard
results from interaction of gam
ma rays "on the genes ol individ
uals, which produces an increased
mutation rate."
The scientists— Walter R. Eck
elmann, J. Laurence Kulp and Ai
thur R Schulert of Columbia Uni
versity published their findings
in the Feb 8 issue of Science, a
journal of the American Associa
tion for the Advancement of Sci
ence.
