# Two Slays, One Stunt Left As Winter Drives Totals $570 Toward $8000 Goal
## Freshman Women to Make Change For Mile of Pennies Contest Today 
### 
With two days and one g:mmick left, Winter Quarter Charity
Drives Committee has collected $570 toward its $8000 goal.
Yesterday's Weigh-the-Dean Contest had to be canceled because of
rain. During the day $145 was collected.
One-third of the money will go to World University Service, one
third to Community Chest and one-third to Red Cross. Winter Quar-

ter Drives' 400 solicitors have un
til Sunday to turn in their bags
of money to the temporary office
upstairs in the Student Union.
Today a mile of pennies is
hoped to be added to the charity
fund as students will attempt to
run a chain of copper coins
around Quad starting at Engi
neering Corner.
Five-Eighths Mile Record
But no past charity drive has
passed the Business School, which
is only about five-eighths of a
mile from Engineering.
"We hope to beat that this
year," Chairman Skip Renner has
said
The Penny Mile will begin at 8
a.m. Freshman women will be at
Enginering Corner all day mak
ing penny change for charitable
students.
Winter Drives is an ASSU proj
ect. Community Chest is a local
organization, while World Univer
sity Service is an international
one.
WUS Funds
WUS funds go to provide
books, clothing and food for
needy students abroad. Cross
funds are channeled through the
local organization in Palo Alto,
with a portion going for national
use.
Some Winter Quarter Drives
donations will help flood victims
in Virginia, West Virginia, Ken
tucky and Tennessee. The flood
disaster has increased the na
tional Red Cross goal by $5 mil
lion and the local Palo Alto goal
by $2791.
This brings the national goal to
$95 million and the Palo Alto goal
to $65,342.
