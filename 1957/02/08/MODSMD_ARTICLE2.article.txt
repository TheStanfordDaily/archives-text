### 
UNITED NATIONS, Keb. 7 —
(UP) A strong group of states
in the Afro Asian bloc decided
today to demand sanctions eco
nomic or military measures and
perhaps expulsion from the Unit
ed Nations against Israel for its
refusal to quit Egyptian territory.
The 27-nation group caucused
on the proposed action. It was
understood that there was not
unanimous agreement. However',
drafting of a sanctions resolution
was undertaken. It would call for
penalties against Israel for its re
fusal to comply with the UN's re
peated calls to withdr aw its troops
from the Gaza strip and the Gulf
of Aqaba shoreline.
A Jerusalem dispatch indicated
that Premier David Ben-Gurion
and his Cabinet had decided to
risk sanctions rather than give up
the disputed areas without guar
antees that Egypt would not. use
them for military action against
Israel.

"non-belligerency."
A United Press dispatch from
the Sinai front said Israel had
begun withdrawal from the Gaza
and Aqaba strips last Saturday,
but sent its troops back into posi
tion later.
