On New Fathers, 4-F"s
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (UP)—
Selective Service Director Lewis
B. Hershey urged Congress today
to order military training for
some 3.7 million young fathers
and 4-F's now draft deferred.
He told a House Armed Services
subcommittee studying the Re
serve and National Guard pro
grams that many men in the two
groups could "perform well, espe
cially iri a ready reserve." He said
they should be trained in case of
a large mobilization.
4-F's for Civil Defense
Hershey said that if his sugges
tions wei'e followed, a fathers'
draft still would be at least two
or three years away. He also pro
posed that many of the 4-F's be
used for Civil Defense work in
emergencies.
Hershey made the proposal as
Maj. Gen. Edgar C. Erickson, head
of the Army's National Guard Bu
reau, disclosed that he opposrd
the Administration's new si\
month training program for Na
tional Guard recruits.
Guard Drop Expected
Erickson also told the subcom
mittee that even with "our most
optimistic estimates," the bureau
expected Guard strength to drop
by 30,000 by the middle of next
year. Guardsmen believed the new
training program would cripple
their enlistments.
Hershey testified there wen l
about 5 million men in their late
teens and early 20's who were not
in service or in the Reserves. They
include 1.4 million fathers, 2.3 mil
lion classed as "unacceptable" and
