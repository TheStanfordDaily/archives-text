# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Is Eisenhower Doctrine the Answer? 
### Wally Simpson 
Nine years ago Greece was embroiled in a
stiuggle to decide whether that nation would
ii in in the ranks of democracy or whether, by
i< i ::o of arms, Communism would sweep another
country behind the "Iron Curtain."
Today another struggle is going on, in an area
qu te ciose to Greece and in an area just as vital,
it more so. Certainly it is larger, more stra
to; ' and contains a prime source ol the free
'.vi lid's oil supply.
In the case of Greece it was the"Truman Doe
that saved the day. In the case of the
*i idle East it is the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that
; been advanced to save the day. The doctrine
i the same; the Chief Executive is not.
The opposition is of a different nature, too.
In Greece it was an armed struggle with Greek
Communist rebels, supplied from Yugoslavia.
{ '"ito and Stalin were friends at that time.)
T n the Middle East the opposition is elusive.
It is ''Imost non-existent to the eye. It is certainly
not that of armed rebellion in the hands of Com
; unistic forces.
But the danger of armed conflict is forever
present so long as that area contains oil, Suez,
political despots and oppressed people living in
ub - standard conditions. Communist ideology
tl rives on situations such as the last two men
tinned—like flies on a rotten apple.
No Forcible Ren> »val
l T nfortunately, the free Wwr'd cannot forcibly
remove these deplorab 'on- .ons in that part
' the world. We ccr m even offer the people
1! ere relief. We can only deal with the govern
ments in those areas, and the governments will
dictate to the people.
The"Truman Doctrine" aided Greece, and by
aiding Greece it aided the Greek people. And only
ily did it aid the American people by prevent
ing a nation of peoples from being swallowed up.
it was as unselfish an act as any people or gov
i nment could do for another people and govern
ment.
The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is not only "not"
im elfish; it is a doctrine calculated to preserve
American oil interests and the free world's ship
interests in the Suez Canal. If passed, it will
! : obably prevent the peoples in that area from
Willing under Communist control. But it will not
remove the conditions 1 hat brought that danger
in the first place.
Truman Doctrine Remembered
To that extent the American people can say the
Ei < nhower Doctrine" is good. It will be bene
ficial. In fact, it is necessary. But Truman will
remembered by the Greek people long after
; Mihower is forgotten by the people of the
i Ho East. The efficacy of the"Truman Doe
| was such that Ihe whole people benefited.
The objective of that doctrine was reached, and
tand-by powers needed by Truman to attain
11 'it objective did not have to continue indefi-
The powers requested by Eisenhower for
1;; ' Middle East will have to continue in effect
!nd( finitely. The danger is not a temporary one,
nor can ihe United States make it temporary.
1 oily the removal of despotic governments and
standard conditions or the removal of Com
' lunism. from the world will remove the danger
i the Middle East.

Never has the Middle East been such a topic
of national controversy and concern than it has
in recent days.
On Capitol Hill, senatorial sagacity is attacking
the problem posed in President Eisenhower's
request for wide powers to financially and mili
tarily aid the hot spot.
Down the street at the White House, the Presi
dent himself is quaffing orange juice cocktails
with the King of Saudi Arabia. Also in town is
the Crown Prince of Iraq. Everybody wants to
get into the act.
Means to Eliminate Obstacles
Over at the State Department, John Foster
Dulles is hatching means to eliminate the ob
stacles in the way of an effective United States
policy for the Middle East—a policy which has
taken on the aura of mystery under the title "The
Eisenhower Doctrine."
This catch-all term hides the real meaning of
the request of President Eisenhower. Actually it
is not a doctrine he is seeking to impose, for Web
ster defines "doctrine" as "knowledge" or "a
teaching." Rather, it is at best "a calculation."
There is no certain knowledge in the interna
tional flux of the Middle East today. The problem
there arises from an ever-changing undercurrent
of old-fashioned "wheeling and dealing" by the
oil-rich Arab nations.
Neither President Eisenhower nor Secretary
Dulles can formulate a doctrine in the true mean
ing of the word, for the knowledge they have
indeed, the knowledge anyone has—is only half
knowledge. The other half is calculation.
And that is exactly what the Eisenhower re
quest is a finely calculated bit of international
power politics based on uncertain risks and af
fected by not entirely-known elements.
Now, just who did the calculation? And to
what extent may it be criticized?
Experts Did Calculation
The answer to the first question is simple
experts did the calculation. Advisers in the field,
State Department diplomats, top-level govern
ment aides—men who realize the problem and
can figure out the probabilities.
Their conclusion: $200 million aid and exeou
tive powers for military assistance are the best
calculated means of meeting the problem.
Against the experts argue the congressmen and
senators, the political critics and Hie armchair
diplomats. They like the term "Eisenhower Doe
trine" because it is easier to play political foot
ball with. It's a means for them to express their
disapproval of American foreign policy leaders
in general.
Meanwhile the problem continues. The risk
increases.
In the White House, President Eisenhower tries
to bridge the gap by exchanging citrus-juice as
surances with a rich King. Over at State, John
Foster tries to fill the void by having press con
ferences, talking with a Crown Prince and trying
to satisfy senatorial sagacity.
But meanwhile the Middle East smolders as a
dampened log on Ihe embers of fire which erupted
once and may erupt again unless an effective fire
extinguisher is provided by the United States
Congress as requested by the President and the
Secretary of State.
