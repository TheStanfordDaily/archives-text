Mil's, Orwell Happy
Editor. The Daily:
l want to express my admiration for the splen
(' 1 satirical qualities of your Tuesday editorial
' liich you remark, "To say that Saud should
: have been invited to the United States be
<se he is anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish and the
i il. i of a slave state is ridiculous." It is not
iy day that The Stanford Daily, like Dryden,
ioves such a high level.
One very minor literary criticism. It would
ie heightened the effect had you been able to
■ it in that Saudi Arabia, like the Union of
'i Africa, is part of the free world. Also an
'i.que reference to the Nobel Prize winners who

have been denied entry into (he TTnitPd State*
would have helped.
Although such observations might have dimin
ished tlie space below for ftlvis, one feels sun
they would have brought warmth to the hearts
of John Stuart Mill and George Orwell in then
otherwise cold and desolate graves.
Keep up the good work in keeping the Aspi
distra flying.
Frank li. Tangherlini
Ed. Note: For the benefit of Hi? uninformed,
the dictionary says Aspidistra is a smooth,
stendess Asiatic herb grown as a house plant.
Personally, we don't get the connection.
