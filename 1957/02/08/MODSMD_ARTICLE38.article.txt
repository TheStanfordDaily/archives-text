There is a possibility that for the first time this season the erack
erbox Stanford Pavilion will not be packed to the rafters for a con
ference game. But those fans who might be scared away by the so-so
record of the Washington State team may be missing out on a torrid
'.coring duel between two of the best jump-shooters in the business.
< >n the Stanford side is Hill Bond, the (M senior who has been amaz
ing fans all season with his beauliful long, arching jumpers. Oppos
ing Bond will be WSC's senior forward, (5-3 Larry Beck, the leading
■ I'orer in the Pacific Coast Conference.
I.usl year Ibis pair squared off in a two-game match in the
Cougars' Holder Gymnasium as the two clubs split a pair of thrill
ers. It..Hi lads turned in (heir lop scoring performances l of I lie
season, Beck tanking Mti and 2H points while Bond was picking up
26 and 27. Bond started this season rather poorly, scoring only 41
points in the first three league games, but since lias come through
with performances of 2f>, 20, 22, 23 and 28 points to raiwe his con
ference average l<> !!>.!> markers per game. Not only this, but Bill's
hustling floor [day, ball-hawking and passing have played almost
as big a role in I he Card attack as his phenomenal shooting.
Beck is almost the entire Cougar offense, being a dangerous scor
er from anywhere on the floor. Big Larry's specialty is the jump
• hot, too. Beck currently has IS.'} points in eight games to stand far
out front in the PCC point race. Against Oregon two weeks ago,
Larry hit his highs for the season, 33 and 31. Last season he was
econd in loop scoring to UCLA's great Willie Naulls, potting 338
points to the "Whale's" 378.
Beck, who looks more like an All-American end than a forward,
probably will come out on top in any scoring "duel" wilh Bond and
fatten his point lead. But this only because the Cougars have no
body else to call on. As far as the games are concerned, the Indians
hould come away with a double victory.
It's half over now. Stanford lias a respectable 4-4 record. The i
conference title is out of the question and there is only a slim
i bance to slill gain the NCAA playoff berth. But for a few unwel
come breaks the Cards would now be 7-1. causing the "experts"
uho tabbed them last to rub their eyes and look again. Light last
second points—one by Oregon State, four by Washington and three
by California —are all that separates Stanford from that 7-1 record.
I''or the most part, it's been a rather disappointing season because
of these narrow heart-breakers. But before condemning this man
or that man for "choking," consider this: those Indians had no
business being that close to the Huskies or Bears or maybe even
the Beavers . . . let alone beat them.
This is not to say that the Stanford basketball team is not a tal
< nlcd one. On the contrary, there are few shooters to match Bond.
Dick I lag;I is still second in conference shooting. But the unfortunate j
thing about basketball today is that glaring fact that a good big man
is more valuable than a good little man.
Coach Howie Dallmar and his little Indians have had to cope wilh
the likes of OSC's 6-7 Dave Gambee, Washington's 6-7 Doug Smart
and 6!) Bruno Boin, California's 6-7 Duane Asplund and Oregon's
6 6 Hal Duffy in conference games. And outside the conference
they've met men like Rice's 6-10 Temple'Tuclier and Santa Clara's
6 i' Rich Montgomery. There were no Stanfords to match these "boys. ■
Anyone who has gone to any of the games this season knows why '
th<\Cards have been so tough. Fight. No more need be said about
Bond. His shooting and hustling have been the heart of the Stanford
attack all season. Call Isaacs and Dick Haga have done brilliant jobs
of rebounding against much taller opponents and have proven valu
able close in scorers. Paul Neumann represents the club's second
most dangerous scoring threat. And captain Hap Wagner has-really
been the "quarterback" of the club. They're all hustlers, as are front
line reserves John Pflueger, Gary Van Galder, Leo Leonard and
Clint Waring.
They may be a little short on height, but they're long on the
scrap . . . making them a most pleasing team to watch. There.are
lour home games led this season, all expected to be victories. If
you haven't seen these husllcrv in action yet, you've missed some
t liing.

Anyone who has gone to any of the games this season knows why '
th<\Cards have been so tough. Fight. No more need be said about
Bond. His shooting and hustling have been the heart of the Stanford
attack all season. Call Isaacs and Dick Haga have done brilliant jobs
of rebounding against much taller opponents and have proven valu
able close in scorers. Paul Neumann represents the club's second
most dangerous scoring threat. And captain Hap Wagner has-really
been the "quarterback" of the club. They're all hustlers, as are front
line reserves John Pflueger, Gary Van Galder, Leo Leonard and
Clint Waring.
They may be a little short on height, but they're long on the
scrap . . . making them a most pleasing team to watch. There.are
lour home games led this season, all expected to be victories. If
you haven't seen these husllcrv in action yet, you've missed some
t liing.
There is a possibility that for the first time this season the erack
erbox Stanford Pavilion will not be packed to the rafters for a con
ference game. But those fans who might be scared away by the so-so
record of the Washington State team may be missing out on a torrid
'.coring duel between two of the best jump-shooters in the business.
< >n the Stanford side is Hill Bond, the (M senior who has been amaz
ing fans all season with his beauliful long, arching jumpers. Oppos
ing Bond will be WSC's senior forward, (5-3 Larry Beck, the leading
■ I'orer in the Pacific Coast Conference.
I.usl year Ibis pair squared off in a two-game match in the
Cougars' Holder Gymnasium as the two clubs split a pair of thrill
ers. It..Hi lads turned in (heir lop scoring performances l of I lie
season, Beck tanking Mti and 2H points while Bond was picking up
26 and 27. Bond started this season rather poorly, scoring only 41
points in the first three league games, but since lias come through
with performances of 2f>, 20, 22, 23 and 28 points to raiwe his con
ference average l<> !!>.!> markers per game. Not only this, but Bill's
hustling floor [day, ball-hawking and passing have played almost
as big a role in I he Card attack as his phenomenal shooting.
Beck is almost the entire Cougar offense, being a dangerous scor
er from anywhere on the floor. Big Larry's specialty is the jump
• hot, too. Beck currently has IS.'} points in eight games to stand far
out front in the PCC point race. Against Oregon two weeks ago,
Larry hit his highs for the season, 33 and 31. Last season he was
econd in loop scoring to UCLA's great Willie Naulls, potting 338
points to the "Whale's" 378.
Beck, who looks more like an All-American end than a forward,
probably will come out on top in any scoring "duel" wilh Bond and
fatten his point lead. But this only because the Cougars have no
body else to call on. As far as the games are concerned, the Indians
hould come away with a double victory.
It's half over now. Stanford lias a respectable 4-4 record. The i
conference title is out of the question and there is only a slim
i bance to slill gain the NCAA playoff berth. But for a few unwel
come breaks the Cards would now be 7-1. causing the "experts"
uho tabbed them last to rub their eyes and look again. Light last
second points—one by Oregon State, four by Washington and three
by California —are all that separates Stanford from that 7-1 record.
I''or the most part, it's been a rather disappointing season because
of these narrow heart-breakers. But before condemning this man
or that man for "choking," consider this: those Indians had no
business being that close to the Huskies or Bears or maybe even
the Beavers . . . let alone beat them.
This is not to say that the Stanford basketball team is not a tal
< nlcd one. On the contrary, there are few shooters to match Bond.
Dick I lag;I is still second in conference shooting. But the unfortunate j
thing about basketball today is that glaring fact that a good big man
is more valuable than a good little man.
Coach Howie Dallmar and his little Indians have had to cope wilh
the likes of OSC's 6-7 Dave Gambee, Washington's 6-7 Doug Smart

of these narrow heart-breakers. But before condemning this man
or that man for "choking," consider this: those Indians had no
business being that close to the Huskies or Bears or maybe even
the Beavers . . . let alone beat them.
This is not to say that the Stanford basketball team is not a tal
< nlcd one. On the contrary, there are few shooters to match Bond.
Dick I lag;I is still second in conference shooting. But the unfortunate j
thing about basketball today is that glaring fact that a good big man
is more valuable than a good little man.
Coach Howie Dallmar and his little Indians have had to cope wilh
the likes of OSC's 6-7 Dave Gambee, Washington's 6-7 Doug Smart
and 6!) Bruno Boin, California's 6-7 Duane Asplund and Oregon's
6 6 Hal Duffy in conference games. And outside the conference
they've met men like Rice's 6-10 Temple'Tuclier and Santa Clara's
6 i' Rich Montgomery. There were no Stanfords to match these "boys. ■
Anyone who has gone to any of the games this season knows why '
th<\Cards have been so tough. Fight. No more need be said about
Bond. His shooting and hustling have been the heart of the Stanford
attack all season. Call Isaacs and Dick Haga have done brilliant jobs
of rebounding against much taller opponents and have proven valu
able close in scorers. Paul Neumann represents the club's second
most dangerous scoring threat. And captain Hap Wagner has-really
been the "quarterback" of the club. They're all hustlers, as are front
line reserves John Pflueger, Gary Van Galder, Leo Leonard and
Clint Waring.
They may be a little short on height, but they're long on the
scrap . . . making them a most pleasing team to watch. There.are
lour home games led this season, all expected to be victories. If
you haven't seen these husllcrv in action yet, you've missed some
t liing.
There is a possibility that for the first time this season the erack
erbox Stanford Pavilion will not be packed to the rafters for a con
ference game. But those fans who might be scared away by the so-so
record of the Washington State team may be missing out on a torrid
'.coring duel between two of the best jump-shooters in the business.
< >n the Stanford side is Hill Bond, the (M senior who has been amaz
ing fans all season with his beauliful long, arching jumpers. Oppos
ing Bond will be WSC's senior forward, (5-3 Larry Beck, the leading
■ I'orer in the Pacific Coast Conference.
I.usl year Ibis pair squared off in a two-game match in the
Cougars' Holder Gymnasium as the two clubs split a pair of thrill
ers. It..Hi lads turned in (heir lop scoring performances l of I lie
season, Beck tanking Mti and 2H points while Bond was picking up
26 and 27. Bond started this season rather poorly, scoring only 41
points in the first three league games, but since lias come through
with performances of 2f>, 20, 22, 23 and 28 points to raiwe his con
ference average l<> !!>.!> markers per game. Not only this, but Bill's
hustling floor [day, ball-hawking and passing have played almost
as big a role in I he Card attack as his phenomenal shooting.
Beck is almost the entire Cougar offense, being a dangerous scor
er from anywhere on the floor. Big Larry's specialty is the jump
• hot, too. Beck currently has IS.'} points in eight games to stand far
out front in the PCC point race. Against Oregon two weeks ago,
Larry hit his highs for the season, 33 and 31. Last season he was
econd in loop scoring to UCLA's great Willie Naulls, potting 338
points to the "Whale's" 378.
Beck, who looks more like an All-American end than a forward,
probably will come out on top in any scoring "duel" wilh Bond and
fatten his point lead. But this only because the Cougars have no
body else to call on. As far as the games are concerned, the Indians
hould come away with a double victory.
It's half over now. Stanford lias a respectable 4-4 record. The i
conference title is out of the question and there is only a slim
i bance to slill gain the NCAA playoff berth. But for a few unwel
come breaks the Cards would now be 7-1. causing the "experts"
uho tabbed them last to rub their eyes and look again. Light last
second points—one by Oregon State, four by Washington and three
by California —are all that separates Stanford from that 7-1 record.
