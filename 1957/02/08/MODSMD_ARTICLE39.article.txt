Washington Stale and Larry
Beck will be pitted against Stan
ford and Bill Bond tonight at the
Pavilion as the Cougars and In
dians open a two-game set which

pleaser.
Stanford was tabbed for the Pa
cific Coast Conference cellar by
preseason dopesters and WSC was
just one notch up the ladder. But
both clubs have proved the ex
perts "all wet," with some out
standing performances desp i t e
their lack of height.

play, wilh all of their losses com
ing at I he hands of the three clubs
rated at the top in most of the
forecasts. And three of the losses
were narrow heart breakers. The
Cougars have a 3-5 mark, which
already is an improvement on last
season, when I hey were 2-14.
The big feature of this week
end's clashes will be the scoring
duel expected between the confer
ence's two leading point-getters,
Beck of WSC and Bond of Stan
lord. Beck, runnerup in scoring
last season to IJCLA's Willie
Naulls, jumped to an early lead in
the scoring derby and currently
rests on top with a 22.9 average.
The burly Cougar holds a healthy
lead over Bond, but the Card ace
has been pulling up fasl and has
averaged 23.6 points in his last
five games.
Barring injury or the emer
gence of some new defensive wiz
ard, Bond is almost a cinch to lie
come the fourth Stanford player
in history to score 1000 points in
his career. Bill needs 118 in the
next eight games to take his place
alongside Ron Tomsic, Hank Lui
sclli and George Selleck. Tie needs
22 points to pass Olympian Jim
Walsh in all-time figures.
Two Platoons Shown
Stanford fans wift also get a
look at the two-platoon system of
Cougar coach Jack Friel. One of
I he few exponents of this rare
basketball system, the veteran
mentor takes almost as much care
in picking his second-stringers as
he does the first. The two pla
toons do not mean, however, Ihat
both squads play equal time. The
second unit is inserted to give ihc
starters a rest and present a con
trast in style of attack. More often
than not, the insertion of Friel's
second platoon brings on a raft

of substitutions by the opposing
coach, too.
Sophomore Jerry Spanner, one
of the Cougars' top three forwards
all season, dropped from school
Monday because of "family re
sponsibilities" and will be replac
ed on the second unit by Jack
Hein. Dick Axelson, 6-0, is ex
pected to start at forward with
Beck. The center slot is held down
by 6-6 Paul Ronhaar, while 5-11
Dick Rask and 5-7 Jim Ross are
at guard.
Axelson and Spanner had been
vying for the first-string role
since the league season starter.
Both sophomores, Axelson has 32
points and Spanner had 40. Span
ner also was the third ranking re
bounder on the squad. His re
placement, I rein, also stands 6-3
but has seen no action in con
ference games this season.
Ilein and 0-7 letterman Bill Gal
braith will be forwards on the sec
ond platoon. At center is 0-5 Bruce
Olson, the team's lone senior be
sides Beck and the top scorer of
the second five. Guards are scrap
py Mert Kennedy, 5-11, and 0-2 Ed
Steele, who lettered last season
and was a starter for some time.
No Change
There will be no change in the
Stanford starting lineup: Bond
and Dick Haga at forwards, Carl
Isaacs at center and Paul Neu
mann and captain Ilap Wagner at
the guards. John Pflueger, who
missed last week's Oregon games
with an ankle injury, is reported
ready to return to action. Neu
mann's ankle is also apparently
fully recovered from the injury
which kept him out of the Santa
Clara game.
