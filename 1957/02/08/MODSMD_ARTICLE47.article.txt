fourth engagement ending in a
I tie. Herrmann was PCCchampion

two years ago and runner-up last
year, so is expected to soon hegin
getting plenty of distance.
Phil Fehlen, out to make amends
for his relatively poor showing
last timp out, is the favorite in
the high jump. Fehlen negotiated
"only" 6-3 : >i three weeks ago after
having cleared (it! with surprising
regularity. Larry Kelley, another
6-3% man. and Ron Bondoe, (>-2 :, 4.

expected to come from the KKO,
mile and two-mile, Roger Beck,
Maury Graves, Ralph Love, Boh
Monzingo and Warren Wood can
all he counted on for improving
performances in the mile and/or
iwo-mile. Ernie Cunliffe is the
definite choice in the half-mile,

should not be too far back.
