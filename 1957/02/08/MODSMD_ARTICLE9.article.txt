# Stanford Choir Gives Beautiful Performance In First Appearance With S.F. Symphony
## 
### Dick Lee 
The Stanford University Choir
as soloist last evening with the
San Francisco Symphony gave a
beautiful and highly sensitive
reading of the "Flos Campi" by
English contemporary composer-
Ralph Vaughan Williams.
This composition for solo viola,
choir and small orchestra is a
series of six interwoven sections,
inspired by the Biblical Song of
Solomon, which take full advan*

tage of the contrasting tonal qual
ities of the various solo parts.
Maestro Enrique Jorda brings
out the quasi-Romantic, almost
pantheistic characteristics of this
work but stays well within the
delicate chamber structure. i
Stanford professor Harold C.
Schmidt's choir has been trained
to a high professional level.
Though they actually uttered no
words, the choir members convey
complete emotions through pre
cise and varying humming and
ahhing, intended by Vaughan
Williams to convey an instrumen
tal feeling
The choir's presentation and
appearance should encourage fre
quent future appearances with
the San Francisco Symphony.
Sharing the solo spotlight with
the Stanford Choir was guest ar
tist Gary Graffman, a 28-year-old
American pianist. Graffman bril
liantly interpreted the Prokofieff
Third Piano Concerto before an
audience highly receptive toward
this difficult modern work
For once this season the orches
tra and soloist completely co-ordi
nated efforts This feat is more
readily understood in light of the

projected release oi a recording
of this concerto by Graffraan and
the Symphony. Also included on
the program were Schubert's
Symphony No 3 and Smetana's
"The Moldau," under the direc
tion of Jordci.
The program will be repeated
this afternoon at 2:15 and tomor
row night at 8:30 in the War Me
morial Opera House in San Fran
cisco.
