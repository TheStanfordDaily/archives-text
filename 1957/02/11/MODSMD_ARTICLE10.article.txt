# Penny Mile Sets New Record Drive Totals Far Below Goal
## Only One Past Goal as High, Renner Says 
### 
With one record already bro
ken, Winter Quarter Charity
Drive is aiming at smashing an
other one by the deadline at 10
tonight.
The Penny Mile broke the dis
tance record Friday when enough
copper coins were contributed to
yield a chain from Engineering
Corner to the Memorial Arch. The
old record was to the Business
School.
Drive Chairman Skip Renner
said students chipped in some
money without getting it changed
into pennies. He estimated these
added funds would have stretched
the pennies to Physics Corner.
Mile Nets $207
In all the Penny Mile netted
$207. All contributions have to
taled "about $4000" so far, Ren
ner "said, but he emphasized that
was only an "educated guess."
If the drive goes over the goal
of $8000, it will be the first Win
tor Quarter Charity Drive to do
so in Stanford history. Renner
admitted the drive is a long way
from its goal, but said only one
past goal was as high.
"Since this is the last day and
we're making such a poor show
ing," the chairman said, "if ev
eryone would really make an ef
fort we might have a chance to
put it over the top for the first
time."
Solicitors to Tour
Four hundred solicitors will
tour living groups all day today
and containers are placed at stra
tegic campus spots.
In continuing his plea to the
campus, Renner said, "A lot of
people don't have very much
money. People who do have the
money should give as much as
they possibly can."
According to incomplete tabu
lations, Women's Row has donat
ed $1.50 a person, Roble $1.20,
Union $1.10 and Stern Hall 10
cents or, as Renner said, "maybe
seven cents."
Trophy Award
Men's Row figures are not yet
in, Renner said. A trophy will be
awarded to the living group with
the highest contribution per cap
ita.
He cited as an outstanding ex
ample of generosity the $20 trav
eler's check given by a campus
visitor identified only as William
Lightfoot, Jr. (no relation to
Prince Lightfoot). Renner did
not know where the visitor was
from but said, "He seemed to be
from the Midwest by his accent."
"It snows you on a campus
where you're used to fighting for
a dime," he said of Lightfoot's
contribution.

He cited as an outstanding ex
ample of generosity the $20 trav

visitor identified only as William
Lightfoot, Jr. (no relation to

not know where the visitor was
from but said, "He seemed to be
from the Midwest by his accent."

Hearing the Law School entrance are (left to

With one record already bro
ken, Winter Quarter Charity
Drive is aiming at smashing an
other one by the deadline at 10
tonight.
The Penny Mile broke the dis
tance record Friday when enough
copper coins were contributed to
yield a chain from Engineering
Corner to the Memorial Arch. The
old record was to the Business
School.
Drive Chairman Skip Renner
said students chipped in some
money without getting it changed
into pennies. He estimated these
added funds would have stretched
the pennies to Physics Corner.
Mile Nets $207
In all the Penny Mile netted
$207. All contributions have to
taled "about $4000" so far, Ren
ner "said, but he emphasized that
was only an "educated guess."
If the drive goes over the goal
of $8000, it will be the first Win
tor Quarter Charity Drive to do
so in Stanford history. Renner
admitted the drive is a long way
from its goal, but said only one
past goal was as high.
"Since this is the last day and
we're making such a poor show
ing," the chairman said, "if ev
eryone would really make an ef
fort we might have a chance to
put it over the top for the first
time."
Solicitors to Tour
Four hundred solicitors will
tour living groups all day today
and containers are placed at stra
tegic campus spots.
In continuing his plea to the
campus, Renner said, "A lot of
people don't have very much
money. People who do have the
money should give as much as
they possibly can."
According to incomplete tabu
lations, Women's Row has donat
ed $1.50 a person, Roble $1.20,
Union $1.10 and Stern Hall 10
cents or, as Renner said, "maybe
seven cents."
Trophy Award
Men's Row figures are not yet
