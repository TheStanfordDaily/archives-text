# HERITAGE FUND DRIVE
## Student Committee to Solicit Gifts From Local Businessmen 
### 
Forty Stanford seniors will embark this week on their annual Heri
tage Fund drive among 60 selected local businessmen to provide lead
ership scholarships for undergraduates at the University.
Under Ihe chairmanship of Dick Bolton the students have set a
goal of $20,000. Each team, a man and a woman student, will call on

three business firms in the Palo
Alto-Mountain View-Menlo Park
area.
Each scholarship will bear the
name of the donor firm and each
winner of a leadership scholar
ship keeps in personal touch with
his or her donor. This personal
appeal is the main principle of
the program in which each busi
nessman sees concretely what, his
donation has acomplished by be
coming acquainted with the re
cipient of his gift.
Third Year
The drive, now in its third year
as a project of the senior class,
is Intended to provide scholar
ships for student leaders. Aca
demic success, character and fi
nancial need arc also considered,
1 but the leadership qualities of the
student as exhibited by him in his
high school career are the prime
basis for choice. The scholarships
are granted througlf the Univer-
I sity Scholarship Committee,
i Last night the Heritage Fund
Committee held its "kick-off des
sert" at the home of .lames Tri
olo, Associate General Secretary
and adviser to the committee.
Technique Demonstration
A demonstration was also put
I on by one team of solicitors. The
techniques used by this team
were analyzed and criticized by
both Triolo and guest speaker ;il
, the "dessert" Robert Pierce, exec
! utivc assistant to the Alumni As
j social ion president.
Chairman Bolton said later, "In
I addition to providing scholar
ships, the Heritage Fund pro
gram has an educational value in
that the members of the commit
tee receive a very thorough train
ing course covering the financial
structure, history and scholarship
program of the University, which
will give them, as alumni, an im
proved understanding of the Uni
versity's long-term needs and
plans."
