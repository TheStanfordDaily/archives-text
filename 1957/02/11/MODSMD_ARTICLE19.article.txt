# A 						Reasonable Goal
## 
### 
A DOLLAR PFR STUDENT. That was the goal eel
I >v Skip Renner, the head of Winter (Quarter
Charity Drive, at ilie beginning of last week.
111 is meant that Stanford's goal would he
SBOOO. Renner reported yesterday that the
week's activities had netted the drive not quite
1000, less than 50 eents a student.
1 he drive hag been extended and will be
closed tonight. We hope that by tonight
Renner will have realized his goal.
1 he one dollar asked for —the priee of ad
mission of one poor movie—would keep a
Korean war orphan in an orphanage in Korea
for (»ne week. It would keep a Pakistani stu
dent in school for a week. Two dollars will
buy a Red dross blanket for a flood victim.
All three charities involved in the drive —
Red (Iross, N\ orhl University Service and (.loin
nutnily (Ihest—are fi for ilie work ihey
have done thrc >jiit he country or the
woi Id.
fl remained for a campus visitor identified
a William f.ightfoot to show the importance
til the charities !o him hv handing the com
u ittee a travelers" check for $20.
I he attitude toward the diive by those on
• iinpn: on the other band, seems to lie one

of only amused interest. The various gimmicks
ihe I'enny .Mile, ihe I <»Iv Man (lontesl used
only to arouse interest, have done quite well.
Bui the real meat of the drive, the dorm-to
dorm solicitation, has turned out to be a
miserable failure. Most of ihe fault can be
laid to the dorms themselves. Stern Hall, the
University's largest men's dormitory, lias av
eraged 10 cents a man.
Some of the fault can be attributed to the
lack of solicitors. One potential solicitor's
question to Renner was, '"Will we get our pic
ture in the (,)uad?' Somehow this seems to
miss the main purpose of a charity drive.
If a student wishes, he can be apathetic
toward campus activities and the world iu gen
eral. But when it conies to helping one's fel
low man, just once a quarter, everyone should
consider it his duty to give.
And students would make a mistake to re
strict themselves to the dollar-apiece goal.
Some can't afford to give :it all. Those wliimmii
should dig deepei than just llicii week's heei
fund.
Ihe $8000 goal is the highest goal in the
history of Drives, but if everyone does his patt,
big or small, there is no reason win Stanford
thouhl not go wa\ over the mark.
