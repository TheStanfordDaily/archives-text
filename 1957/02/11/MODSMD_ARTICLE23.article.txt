floncern Willi Unimportant Issues
Editor, The Daily:
You .state in your Feb. 8 editorial 1 hat The Stanford Daily has
been given almost complete voice in its own editorial and news poli
cies and that the administration has exercised no control whatsoever.
Mr. Editor, why in the hell would any administration want to exer
rise any control over your paper a paper that seems to consider the
bickering over 18-year olds drinking and squabbling over the hours
that the girls should get home, the more important news items that
should be brought to the attention of this campus. As long as your
paper is going to consider this type of news as the more important
issues ol the day, assuredly, no administration is going to exercise
any control over your paper. In fact, I am sure that some school
administrations find it most satisfying if their school newspapers
concern themselves with the mediocre, In that way no one is both
ered or antagonized.
But what ol the other issues that have arisen on this campus
or might a fleet this institution of higher learning? Several weeks
ago a professor of this campus was recommended for deportation
by an investigating committee and I saw no news coverage of this
event in this paper, much less an editorial comment on the role of
investigating committees in regard to learning and Your
paper lost no time in joining ihe bandwagon to help the Hungarian
revolutionists. Did anyone on the staff ever bothei to find out just
exactly who these revolutionists were or what they actually stood
for ?
Mr. Editor, as long as you join bandwagons, ignore the obvious
problem of conformity in the University, wish to maintain military
programs on the campus, forget about professors before investigat
ing groupsâ€”as long as you do these and also give good coverage to
the 18 year old drinking problem or Ihe "what time should the girls
get home?" problem you should have no worry about the adminis
tration trying to exercise any control over your newspaper.
