# Post Office Plans To Ask for 5-Cent First Class Rate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (UP)
The Post Office Department has
served notice on Congress that it
almost certainly will ask the law
makers to raise the cost of mail
ing a first-class letter from three
to five cents.
Deputy Postmaster General
Maurice H. Stans recently told a
House Appropriations subcommil
tee the department must have the
rate hike or face a $1 billion-a
year deficit. His testimony was
made public today.
The request faces strong con
gressional opposition. Last year
the House approved the Adminis
tration's appeal for a one-cent in
crease in first-class mail, but the
bill died in the Senale.
ISudgrl Provides Itoost
President Eisenhower's careful
ly-balanccd budget for the fiscal
year starting July I provides for
a $654 million postal rate increase.
The budget calls for a $1.8 billion
surplus, but failure of Congress to
authorize the postal boost would
take a big chip out of it.
Stans told the subcommittee
that the Post Office Department's
1958 deficit would run to about
$651 million under present postal
rates. In addition, he said, the de
partment. is mapping a five-year
program of mechanical improve
ments and added facilities that
would raise it to $761 million.
Possible Increases
Stans said that, with the possi
bility of a pay increase for postal
employes and the "probability" of
a railroad rate increase, the deficit
will climb to somewhere between
$750 million and $1 billion annual
ly "in the very near future."
A s k rÂ» d what the department
planned to do, he replied, "Any
analysis we make of the figures
makes it very clear to us th;it we
cannot face up to this problem
without a five-cent rate on first
class mail."
Subcommittee chairman Vaugh
an Gary (D-Va.) said the subcom
mittee endorsed the increase.
