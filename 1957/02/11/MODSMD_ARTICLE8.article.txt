ALGIERS, Algeria, Feb. 10
(UP) Rebels bombed two jam
med football stadiums here today,
killing 11 French spectators and
wounding at least 45 other per
sons.
A number of others were in
jured in panicky attempts to flee.
The infuriated crowd in the
Ruisseau Municipal Stadium
turned on five Moslems and beat
them to death, raising the death
toll at the football fields to IG.
Another bombing at a theater
in isolated Ouenza in eastern Al
geria last night killed another
three persons and injured 13
more in an audience predomi
nantly French.
24-Hour Toll
The bombing toll for 24 hours,
including the five slain Moslems,
was 19 dead and at least 58
wounded.
Three bombs went off at the
stadiums, two in El Biar Stadium
and one at .Ruisseau Stadium.
One of the blasts at EI Biar oc
curred in a washroom and injured
none.
The other two bombs went off
in th'* stands. Shrapnel ripped
through the crowds. The explo
sions and the whizzing chunks of
metal sent the spectators milling
in panic for exits which quickly
jammed up.
Wounded Helped
Police said the casually 101 l
may be higher. Many of the
wounded were helped off to pri
vate clinics and to doctors' homes
in the area before police saw
them.
Five of the wounded were in
critical condition, police said.
Ambulances raced to the sta
diums, and loudspeakers broad
cast appeals to doctors in the
crowds to come forward to treat
the wounded.
