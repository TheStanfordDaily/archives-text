# Political Union President Calls Recall Petition Filed Against Him Outcome of Personal Grudge
## 
### Antic Johnson 
A recall petition to oust him
from the Political Union presi
dency is ihe result of a personal
grudge, Everett Kindig charged
yesterday.
He said the petition was signed
by 14 members of the Theta Chi
fraternity and four Independent
caucus members. Kindig named
Royall Brown as leader of the
group.
Brown refused to comment on
(he charge. He said the petition
was circulated because Kindig
was allowing his job as president

of the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans to interfere with his Po
litical Union post. Brown is also
a member of both groups.
Elected in May
Kindig was elected president of
the Republican group last May.
He said he became vice-president
of the Political Union after that,
and nothing was said about his
holding the two offices.
He assumed the Union presiden
cy at the first of this quarter
when Cliff Kimber, former presi
dent, quit school. At that time no
one protested his becoming presi
dent, Kindig said.
Brown disagreed, saying he had
tried to persuade Kindig to resign
from one of his offices, but Politi
cal Union bylaws state that the
vice -president automatically
moves up if (he president quits
for some reason. Thus, no offi
cial action could be taken, accord
ing to Brown.
Erskine's Statement
Lane Erskine, another Republi
can, who helped circulate the pe
tition, denied the matter was a
grudge and called it "a general
house cleaning." He said anyone
in that position would be recalled.
He said he felt the "interlocking
directorate" was against the best
interests of the Union.
K i Ib u r n MacMurraugh, who
drew up the petition, said an
amendment to prohibit the three
top officers in the Political Union
from holding offices in any parti
san organizations had also been
drawn up. This amendment will
be presented at the same time the
recall is voter! on, according lo
MacMurraugh.
He said the amendment was
worded so as not lo apply to pres
ent officers.
Kindig's Statement
Kindig said he was in favor of
I lie amendment. He explained that
the Area Young Republicans
would elect new officers at Ihe
end of this quarter.
Kindig backed up his grudge
charge by explaining, the s;imo
! situation in the Union existed dur
. ing Kimber's term of office and
! no ret -i!' move bdgan. He s;iid he
I and Kimber were joint presidents
of the Republican group. But he
said he didn't feel the recall
j would go through.
Ernie Hart/,, president of the
Stanford Area Young Democrats
and last year's Political Union
i president, said he felt the recall
"wouldn't serve any useful pur
| pose."
Ilart/.'s Statement
He commented that every Po
| litical Union president has been a
member at least of one of the two
| partisan groups.
i The recall is based on Section a3
I of the Political Union bylaws,
reading: "The Political Union
shall in no way be officially con
nected with any partisan political
organization and/or candidate for
j public office."
Brown estimated 40 per cent of

the Union members were behind
the recall move. He and Erskine
.said they were confident it would
be passed.
The Political Union Executive
Board will meet tomorrow after
noon to set a time and place for
the voting on the petition and
amendment. Ten class d'xys must
elapse between this executive
meeting and the actual vote. The
decision will be by a simple ma
jority of the Political Union mem
bers.

A recall petition to oust him
from the Political Union presi
dency is ihe result of a personal
grudge, Everett Kindig charged
yesterday.
He said the petition was signed
by 14 members of the Theta Chi
fraternity and four Independent
caucus members. Kindig named
Royall Brown as leader of the
group.
Brown refused to comment on
(he charge. He said the petition
was circulated because Kindig
was allowing his job as president

of the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans to interfere with his Po
litical Union post. Brown is also
a member of both groups.
Elected in May
Kindig was elected president of
the Republican group last May.
He said he became vice-president
of the Political Union after that,
and nothing was said about his
holding the two offices.
He assumed the Union presiden
cy at the first of this quarter
when Cliff Kimber, former presi
dent, quit school. At that time no
one protested his becoming presi
dent, Kindig said.
Brown disagreed, saying he had
tried to persuade Kindig to resign
from one of his offices, but Politi
cal Union bylaws state that the
vice -president automatically
moves up if (he president quits
for some reason. Thus, no offi
cial action could be taken, accord
ing to Brown.
Erskine's Statement
Lane Erskine, another Republi
can, who helped circulate the pe
tition, denied the matter was a
grudge and called it "a general
house cleaning." He said anyone
in that position would be recalled.
He said he felt the "interlocking
directorate" was against the best
interests of the Union.
K i Ib u r n MacMurraugh, who
drew up the petition, said an
amendment to prohibit the three
top officers in the Political Union
from holding offices in any parti
san organizations had also been
drawn up. This amendment will
be presented at the same time the
recall is voter! on, according lo
MacMurraugh.
He said the amendment was
worded so as not lo apply to pres
ent officers.
Kindig's Statement
Kindig said he was in favor of
I lie amendment. He explained that
the Area Young Republicans
would elect new officers at Ihe
end of this quarter.
Kindig backed up his grudge
charge by explaining, the s;imo
! situation in the Union existed dur
. ing Kimber's term of office and
! no ret -i!' move bdgan. He s;iid he
I and Kimber were joint presidents
