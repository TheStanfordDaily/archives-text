### 
WASHINGTON. Feb; 11 (UP)
â€”Gabriel Hauge, President Eisen
hower's chief economic adviser,
said today he does not believe the
President plans to impose wage
price controls "now or in the fore
seeable future."
He said he thinks Eisenhower is
trying to achieve both high pros
perity and "reasonably" stable
prices "without resorting to a
straitjacket of direct controls."
Hauge, in a generally optimis
tic report on the economy, said
the business outlook "is for a
good 1957, presumably better
than 1956." The basic outlook is
"sturdy," he said.
Appearing on the MBS radio
program "Reporters' Roundup,"
Hauge was asked about recent
statements by Eisenhower and
Commerce Secretary Sinclair
Weeks on the question of impos
ing wage-price controls as an
anti-inflationary step.
