# A 						Sputtering Experiment
## 
### 
An imaginative experiment was inaugurated
on the Stanford campus in 1953. This was tlie
Political Union. Its purpose was to promote
political discussions and programs on campus.
Il was a hold move by the StanYord Board
of Trustees to permit the Union political ac
tivity, as such was forbidden hy the University
founding grant. But the trustees were willing
to look the other way in order to promote an
activity which would help better the student
for the outside world.
li was carefully stated in the Political I nion
bylaws: "The Political Union shall in no way
he official Iv connected with partisan political
organization and/or candidate for public of
fice." !
The Political Union was supposed to lie a
place for students and guest speakers to present
their views; it was not supposed to lie a place
for professional political organizations to air
their squabbles.
1 he Political Union iu the past has shown
signs of living up to its potentialities. Since
i?-; inception it has sponsored such speakers as
Governor Goodwin Knight, Senator William
Knowland and Senator Hubert Humphrey.
But iu the past year it has become a farce,

a battleground for two factions of students.
This battle has now come to the front in the
form of a petition and threatens to tear apart
what is left of the organization.
What are the pro-kiudig, anti-kiudig forces
fighting over? They are fighting for leader
ship of an organization consisting of 14 regis
tered members. It is an organization which has
failed to sponsor one program all quarter.
I he caucus groups of the llnion are the only
ones with programs, and the Independent cau
cus is the only group that has consistently
sponsored speakers.
We contend that the Political I'nion still has
tremendous potentialities. II its leaders would
work toward organized provocative programs
for the campus instead of using the I nion to
carry on a grudge fight developed in an outside
organization, it would he ideal.
There are some good political minds in the
Political Union. They could give a valuable
contribution to the education of the student
body if they were to work together.
If the present squabble continues, however,
then the I niversitv experiment will have been
a failure and there would seem little use to
continue the organization.
