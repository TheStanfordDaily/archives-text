At Berkeley, Daily Californian editor Jim Lem
ert has attacked a proposed State Legislature
bill which would prohibit all state-supported in
stitutions from recognizing fraternities or sorori
ties which have discriminatory clauses in their
charters.
The bill's sponsor, Los Angeles Assemblyman
Edward E. Elliott, was quick to answer Lemert's
attack.
Lemert said Feb. 1 he was "in complete sym
pathy with the purpose ol this bill, but the pro
posal could result in nothing but a serious set
back to the process of integration in the state's
traternal organization."

He said the bill would result in "the erection
. . . ot an even more complete and ungovern
able structure of unwritten rules and practices."
In answering Lemert's editorial attack on Feb.
4, Elliott replied, "It they believe in democracy,
why would fraternities want to belong to their
national organization it its by laws included dis
criminatory i-lauses ?''
He said many fraternities and sororities could
drop oui ol their national organizations if they
obeyed Elliott's proposed law.

The same day Lemert published his anti-"anti
fraternal disci munition bill" editorial, lour linn
garian refugees arrived in Berkeley. Identified
only as Steven, 10; ("labor, 20; Peter, 22; and
(leorge,. 2 '~ the four escaped from Hungary dm
ing the November Decernbei massacres and wish
lo attend the University of California. They came
to Cal from Camp Kilmer, N.J.
While four Hungarian refugees are trying to
get a place to study, the University of Califor
nia's other 17,000 students have been, trying, ap
parently unsuccessfully, to get ;i place to play.
The athletic facilities provide plenty of places
for the varsity to practice but little room for "Joe
Average Student," according to Daily Californian
sportswriter Al Moss.
As for an answer to the problem, Moss said,
"The solution is simple. Build new facilities,
and stop tearing down, or up, the old ones."

Meanwhile, at Kansas State Teachers College,
the athletic department has ruled in favor of
"shorter" showers after gym classes because of
a water shortage in the Sunflower State.

At Berkeley, Daily Californian editor Jim Lem
ert has attacked a proposed State Legislature
bill which would prohibit all state-supported in
stitutions from recognizing fraternities or sorori
ties which have discriminatory clauses in their
charters.
The bill's sponsor, Los Angeles Assemblyman
Edward E. Elliott, was quick to answer Lemert's
attack.
Lemert said Feb. 1 he was "in complete sym
pathy with the purpose ol this bill, but the pro
posal could result in nothing but a serious set
back to the process of integration in the state's
traternal organization."

He said the bill would result in "the erection
. . . ot an even more complete and ungovern
able structure of unwritten rules and practices."
In answering Lemert's editorial attack on Feb.
4, Elliott replied, "It they believe in democracy,
why would fraternities want to belong to their
national organization it its by laws included dis
criminatory i-lauses ?''
He said many fraternities and sororities could
drop oui ol their national organizations if they
obeyed Elliott's proposed law.

The same day Lemert published his anti-"anti
fraternal disci munition bill" editorial, lour linn
garian refugees arrived in Berkeley. Identified
only as Steven, 10; ("labor, 20; Peter, 22; and
(leorge,. 2 '~ the four escaped from Hungary dm
ing the November Decernbei massacres and wish
lo attend the University of California. They came
to Cal from Camp Kilmer, N.J.
While four Hungarian refugees are trying to
get a place to study, the University of Califor
nia's other 17,000 students have been, trying, ap
parently unsuccessfully, to get ;i place to play.
The athletic facilities provide plenty of places
for the varsity to practice but little room for "Joe
Average Student," according to Daily Californian
sportswriter Al Moss.
As for an answer to the problem, Moss said,
"The solution is simple. Build new facilities,
and stop tearing down, or up, the old ones."

Meanwhile, at Kansas State Teachers College,
the athletic department has ruled in favor of

that the school would close because of lack of
water.
College newspaper editorials have been figur
ing in controversies during the past week at the
University of I'ansas and the University ol Cali

Members of the Kansan Board, governing body
of the University Daily Kansan, will meet this

cide whether student editors may take sides in
state and national politics.
The Kansan Board ruled Dec. 4 to let student
editors take sides in on- and off campus politics.
But the dean of the sehol of journalism, Burton
V. Marvin, disagreed, saying partisan editorials
would not be permitted because of previous stu
