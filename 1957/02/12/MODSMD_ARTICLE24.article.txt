## Graham Norton Says Students Here Have Provincial Outlook 
### Stan Gross Staff Editor 
Graham Norton, ASSU Foreign i
Scholar from London, who lias I
studied with students from all
parts of the world, felt he "must |
say the contrast between the stu
dents I have met |in Europe| and
the average Stanford student is j
startling."
"The only way one can began to j
understand this difference," Not \
ton said, "is to continually remind
oneself that the American concep
tion of a university if; something
radically different from the tradi
tional European one."
"The European student is very
much aware ol the world around
him and oJ Jhf* people about him.
He has a tremendous intellectual
curiosity, and a deep concern lor
the state of» the world as it* is.
This may be due partly to a more
intensive pre university educa
tion," he said "But I believe that
the social and cultural climate ol
his university is mainly respon
sible."
Political Science Major
Norton, a senior at Stanford, is
majoring in political science, lie
was student vice-president ol the
London School ol Economics and
was a prominent member of the
University Conservative Associa
tion. lie has been at Stanford for
six months.
"In order not to he thought a
moron, even the most boorish stu
dent attempts some interest in
things which do not immediately
concern him," Norton said. Thus,
student conversation and discus
sion is on a very high level; this
is encouraged by the authorities
who conceive university attend
ance as education for life, and not
merely for an education.
Therefore, a faint flavor of lib
eral education hangs around even
the holder of a degree, say, in en
gineering.
"Even though the standard in
Britain academically is on a high
er level than at Stanford, broadly
j speaking, a Stanford M.A. would
i be equal to an English 8.A.," he
' said.
"In spite of the fact that the
i work is haider, undergraduates
still find quite an amount of time
' to devote to cultural and intellec
j tual interests other than that of
I their major field of study. They
are particularly interested in
meeting people from other envi
ronments and other cultures,
finding pers on a 1 cohtact im
mensely rewarding, broadening
their experience and education.

"This attirude, in my experi
ence, is not shared by tin 1 average
Stanford, and 1 think American
undergraduate. Without wishing
to appear in any way offensive,'

ne said, "the Stanford student is
to display a somewhat pro
vincial and immature outlook.
"In doing this he shows a char
acteristic, J think, of American
society today. The phenomenal
generosity of America toward the
rest of the world is something
that cannot be denied. However,
to me, one of the greatest para
doxes of our time is that America,
made out of a mixture of so many
ethnic groups, seems psychologi
cally unable to understand or rec
ognize any point of view which
differs from its own.
"<iuilc IJnforgiveable"
"Such an attitude among uni
versity people, the prospective
leaders of their country, is, I
think, quite unforgiveabie; how
ever, I'm told that the 'Great
Awakening' comes when people
leave the university; but surely
the time is now.
"The average Stanford student
seems so wrapped up in his im
mediate private social life that
foreign students are forced to
seek the company of other people
from overseas. This is not just
my own experience," he said, "but
something which has been con
firmed by many other- people
from abroad, most of whom have
lived here -far longer than I
have."
When he returns to complete
his course at the London School
ol Economics, Norton hopes to
be awarded the B.S. degree in eco
nomics. lie would like to go into
the field of political commentary
on radio or television or weekly
journalism.
