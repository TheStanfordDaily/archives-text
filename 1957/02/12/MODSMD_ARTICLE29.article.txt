# Georgia Killer Slain at Dawn; Motive Sought
## 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ga., Feb.'ll UJPI
A prominent white man who
killed a Negro leader last year
was mysteriously slain early to
day and police searched for a pos j
sible motive of racial revenge.
Lucio Flowers, fSfS, was found at
about 7 a.m. fatally wounded in
the lobby of a theater, his .32 cal
iber pistol lying nearby. Police
said he was shot through the
head with a .45 caliber bullet.
Flowers, who owned a depart
ment store just across the street
from the theater, died about three
hours after he was taken to the
hospital.
Flowers last year fatally shot
Dr. T. 11. Brewer, Columbus NA
,ACP leader, but a jury ruled he
fired in "self defense." Police said
today that there was no indica
tion that the two shootings were
connected, but they nevertheless
investigated the possibility of ra
cial revenge.
Police said there were signs of
a struggle in the theater lobby
where Flowers was shot. They
said a handkerchief had been
stufi'ed in his mouth. Officers
ruled out a motive of robbery
since his billfold was found in his
pocket.
A patrolman on his way to
work found Flowers slumped
against a door at the theater. He
had been shot in Ihe head and
two other bullet holes were found
in the door.
