## 
### 
Assemblyman .1 oh n Busterud
yesterday said 18-year-olds have
proven ability to discuss political
issues intelligently, and, "whether
we like it or not," at I his age
many of Ihem have completed
I heir forma I education.
Busterud has introduced an
amendment making 18 the legal
voting age.
High school civics courses stim
ulate interest in government, he
said. Then, with a three-year lapse
between graduation and voting,
many lose interest. This may be
one reason why the 21 -23 age
group has the lowest percentage
of voters.
Busierud also mentioned Ihe
more practical aspect of the ques
tion. He said that, with the new
look in the Republican party,
more young voters than ever be
fore will tend to vole Republican.
Democrats are sponsoring a simi
lar amendment in this session, he
said.
Busierud said the water issue is
Ihe most important now before
the legislature. A $25,190,000 ap
propriation was secured at the
January session, but the big fighl
at the next session will center
around the provision now in the
constitution that the county of
origin has precedence in the use
of its water.
Busierud, a freshman assembly
man, is also sponsoring bills pro
viding for compulsory automobile
insurance, stricter control of nar
cotics cases and the creation of a
rapid transit area in the Bay re
gion.
Busterud spoke in Bowman
Alumni Ilouse before the Political
Union's Republican caucus.
In a special meeting preceding
the speech. Lane Erskine was
elected assistant chairman of the
Republican caucus.
