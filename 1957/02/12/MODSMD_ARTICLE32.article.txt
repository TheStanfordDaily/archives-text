MONDAY: Prof Pomfritt sprang quiz in English lit
this morning. If Shakespeare didn't, write Canterbury
Tales, I'm back in the steam laundry.... Lunch at the
house —turkey hash. Question: how can we have lurkey
hash when we never had turkey ?... Smoked a good,
natural Philip Morris after lunch. Yum, yum! . .. Played
bridge in the afternoon. When game was over, Mildred
Olliphant stabbed me several times with hatpin. Must
learn weak club bid.... Dinner at house —lamb hash.
Question: how can we have lamb hash when wo never
had lamb? ... Smoked a Philip Morris after dinner, Good
()! —no filter, no foolin'!... Chapter meeting at night.
Motion made to abolish capital punishment for pledges.
Motion defeated.... Smoked some more Philip Morri: <■;.
Natural! Dreamy!... And so to bed.
TUESDAY: Faculty tea. Spilled pot of oolong on
Dean of Women. She very snappish. Offered her a I'hilip
Morris. Still snappish. Offered skin graft. No help....
Dinner at Kozy Kampus Kafe — 14 hamburgers. i!ut no
dessert. Have to watch waistline.... And so to bed.
WEDNESDAY: Got our marks in English lit
Lucky for me Shakespeare wrote Canterbury Talcs! . ..
Date with Ralph Feldspar. Purely platonic. Ralph wanted
to talk about love trouble he's been having with Mady
Vanderklung. 1 said things were bound to improve. Ralph
said he hopes so because the last four times he called
on Mady she dumped vacuum cleaner bag on him. Smoked
Philip Morris. Yummm! Dinner at house—bread. That's
all; just bread.... And so to bed.
THURSDAY: Three packages from home — laundry,
cookies, records. So hungry 1 ate all three.... Quiz in
American history. If James K. Polk didn't invent cotton
gin, I'm in big trouble.. .. Had afternoon date with Erwin
Trull, pre-med. Nice boy but no loot. Took me to see
another appendectomy. Ho-hum!... But we had Philip
Morrises afterwards. Goody, goody, gumdrops! ... Din
ner at house. Big excitement — Vanessa Strength an
nounced her engagement. While girls flocked around to
congratulate Vanessa, I ate everybody's mackerel..,.
Then smoked a good, natural Philip Morris. Divoon! ...
And so to bed.

FRIDAY: Qot our marks in American history qui z.
Was dismayed to learn that James K. Polk did not invent
cotton gin. He wrote Canterbury Talcs. . . . Odd! . . .
Lunch at the house — bread hash. ... Philip Morris after
lunch. Grandy-dandy!... Spent afternoon > r ct t ing drcs i>d
for date tonight with Norman Twonkey. Norman is tall,
dark, loaded—a perfect doll! Only thing wrong is he
never tells girl where he is going to take her. So I put
on a bathing suit, on top of that an evening gown, and
on top of that a snowsuit. Thus 1 was ready for a splash
party, dance, or toboggan slide So what do you think
happened? He entered me in a steeplechase, that's what !
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY: Days of rest, play,
quiet, meditation, and — aaah! —Philip Morris!... And
so to bed. .. ,
