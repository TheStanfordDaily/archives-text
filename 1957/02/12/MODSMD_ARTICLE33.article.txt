While Stanford's new track couch Payton Jordan innovates with
his "barbecue" prizes for intrasquad meets, Oregon mentor Bill How
erman is also experimenting.
Bowerman may teach his long-distance men a technique that
amounts to "psychological warfare." The plan consists of running a
race by alternately sprinting 100 yards, jogging .">O, running 7~>, jog
ging 7.") and sprinting again. This is kept up for the entire race.
This style wears down an opponent psychologically as well as
physically. Kowernian says, "Kuiinirig tins way makes you feel
like someone's kicking you in the stomach."
Tiie idea, of course, is not entirely new. Uowerman and Oregon's
distance man Hill Dellinger imbibed it at the Olympic (James from
Hussia's Vladimir Kids. Kuts shocked the international sports world
with bis <print jog, stop-go style and Bowerman has-ever since been
toying with the idea of copying it.
lie divided his runners into two groups. Half have received train
ing in Kuts methods and the other half training in the standard,
■Scandinavian style. This has gone on for seven weeks.
During the seven weeks Oregon trainers have made frequent
scientific cheekv of the runners' condition, using pulse and metabo
lism Icsls. lint only aetual time trials will determine whether the
stop-go ball will prove better than the "steady, consistent" group
of runners.
Uowerman is anxiously awaiting the outcome.
At Lawrence, Kansas, last week, Sports Illustrated writer Jere
miah Tax committed virtual blasphemy when he blasted the Jay
hawks' 7-fool center Will Chamberlain in an interview with a Uni
versity Daily Kansan reporter.
Tax said, "The thing I sec wrong with the Iv( team is Cham
berlain, lie's not playing as well as lie is capable of playing. I saw
the lihn of life lowa State game that Kl lost. What impressed me
was that < hamberlain .just s'lood around most of the time and
didn't put out what he was able."
The sports writer admitted the other lour Jayhawkers "did a very
good job. 1 thought King | guard Maurice King| was terrific. He
stuck to Thompson | lowa State's All-Arneriean candidate Gary
Thompson | like flypaper."
Ceiling back lo Chamberlain, Tax turned amateur psychoanalyst
and said, "I think Chamberlain was under other pressure besides
just the pressure of the game, lie knows there are 17,000 pairs of
eyes on him, and he doesn't want to do anything lo atlracl any more
attention to himself."
Tax, who also watched a Kansas workout, said he thought Wilt
was a different Still iu practice. "In practice Thursday .. . the
SI writer said, "he did things I had never seen him do in a game
or on film."
Hut Tax thought Chamberlain would improve and said the bean
pole center "plays belter at home because he realizes that a lot of
Ihe fans are his friends."
Minutes after this Ground Hog Day interview, Chamberlain made
Tax cat his words by hauling in 24 rebounds, pouring through 19
points and causing four big Cyclones to foul out as Kansas gained
revenge on lowa Slate, 75-04.

In Seattle, Washington, Ihe University of Washington Daily has
made its annual "I'orecasl ol styles that will be popular around the
Pav this spring.
"No, I item for the men this year is that ever-popular ensem
ble a T shirt and white gym 1 liorts, . . . The T-shirt and slior
outfit is being worn with those ever popular white gym socks and
tennis shoes."
The Washington publication suggests "more diversified" styles
for "evening and intramural wear." Among the intramural features
