# Teaching Jobs Don't Interest E.E. Students
## SRI Questionnaire Finds Glamour Titles Appeal to Engineers 
### Baiba Students 
Engineering students show rel
atively little interest in making a
career of teaching and education
al activity. This fact among oth
ers was established by an exten
sive survey conducted by Stan
ford Research Institute on the
opinions and attitudes of electri
cal engineering graduates with
regard to employment opportuni
ties.
Copies of a questionnaire were
sent to the heads of the electrical
engineering department of each
college in the country offering en
gineering programs leading to a
degree.
Over 50 Per Cent Returned
A total of 3433 questionnaires
from 129 colleges were returned
to SRI during the period between
April 13 and July 13, 1956. It is
estimated that the number of
forms returned represented some
what over 50 per cent of all 1956
electrical engineering graduates.
The following conclusions have
been drawn from this study: Stu
dents have a great interest in the
so-called glamour words in engi
neering, such as activities related
to computers and data process
ing, military equipment electron
ics and electronics in general. In
terest in and esteem for engineer
ing in electric power utilities, oth
er utilities and transportation
companies appear to be at a dan
gerously low level.
Important Factors
Opportunities for personal de
velopment and advancement, an
interest in the work and geo
graphical location are among the
most important factors influenc
ing E.E. students' choice of work.
Although salary ranked rela
tively low as a major reason for
.job choice, it is more significant
than indicated directly. Not only
did students closely relate salary
to personal advancement but they
tended to rate industries in terms
of the salaries they offer.
A substantial number of stu
dents indicated their desire to
continue their education in gradu
ate schools either immediately or
in the future.
