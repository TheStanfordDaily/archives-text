WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 (UP)
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles marie an urgent new ap
peal to Israel today to comply
wilh a United Nations demand
that it withdraw its troops from
Egyptian territory without delay.
Dulles conferred with Israeli
Ambassador Abba Eban about I he
revived Arab-Israeli crisis which
had complicated administration
hopes for a Middle East settle
ment.
It was understood that Dulles
warned Ebban that Israel could
not obtain the security it sought
by continuing to refuse to recall
troops from the Gaza Strip and
the approaches to the Gulf of
Aqaba.
But Eban told newsmen after
ihe parley that Israel could not
obey the UN demand until it re
ceived "concrete and tangible
guarantees" against renewal of
Egyptian attacks on its territory
and shipping.
Meanwhile, a steady stream of
Congressmen arose in the House
and Senate to register opposition
to any UN move to impose eco
nomic sanctions on Israel.
Senator Styles Bridges (R-
N.H.), chairman of the Senate
GOP Policy Committee, said the
UN should not punish Israel
while refraining from penalizing
Russia and other nations which
had defied the UN in the past.
Similar protests were voiced by
Senators John J. Sparkman ID-
Ala.), Leverett Saltonstall iR-
Mass.), Thomas H. Kuchel (R-
Calif.) and Stuart Symington (D-
Mo.), among others.
Before meeting Eban, Dulles
conferred by telephone with Pres
ident Eisenhower who is vaca
tioning in Thomasville, Ga.
It was understood thai Dulles
assured Eban that if Israel com
-1 plied wilh the UN request and
withdrew its troops from Egyp
tian teritory, this country would
' hoip it obtain UN protection
against future Egyptian raids.
