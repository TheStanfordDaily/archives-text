## Secretary-General: New Mideast Conflict May Disturb World 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Feb.
11 (UP)- Secretary-General Dag
Hammarskjold advised the Gen
oral Assembly today that invok
ing United Nations sanctions
against Israel might introduce
now elements of conflict into the
Middle East crisis.
Authoritative sources said
Hammarskjold was not pronounc
ing himself for or against sanc
tions, which are demanded by the
Arab countries because of Israel's
refusal to evacuate Egyptian ter
ritory.
His written report to the As
sembly, these sources said, should
be read as a "look • before - you -
leap" message of caution to the
delegates to consider all the con
sequences before voting econom
ic, military or diplomatic disci
pline against Israel.
"(lolU'ctivc Measures"
"If, in some case," he said, "col
lective measures under the 'unit
ing for 1 peace' resolution were to
bo considered, these and other im
portant questions of principle
would require attention. This
may also be said of the effect of
such steps which, while support
ing efforts to achieve peaceful so
lution, may ... be introducing
new elements of conflict."
The 27 - nation Afro - Asian
group, under heavy pressure
from its Arab members to spon
sor a sanctions resolution, cau
cused this afternoon and appoint
ed a drafting committee to draw
up such a measure for- its consid
eration.
Israel repeatedly has refused to
withdraw its forces from the
Gaza and Aqaba strips.
(In London, Britain served no
tice that it would expect the UN
to insure that British ships had
safe passage through the Suez
Canal when it was reopened re
gardless of Israel's occupation of
Egyptian territory. Foreign Sec
retary Selwyn Lloyd told Parlia
ment that Egypt promised free
transit before the Anglo-French
cease-fire "and we assume it will
be kept and that the UN will see
to it that it is kept.")
Hammarskjold's report said
Egypt had given him a pledge to
abide by the 1949 armistice agree
ment, which bars "hostile or war
like acts" by any type of Israeli
or Egyptian forces.
