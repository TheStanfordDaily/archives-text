# Periodical Room Gets New Lights
## 
### 
New lighting is being installed
in the Library's periodical room
and will be completed in about a
month.
The fluorescent ceiling lighting,
which is being installed in place
of the former incandescent lights,
will produce a little more over-all
light than that in the main read
ing room.
The periodical room will be
painted sometime after the light
ing goes in.
