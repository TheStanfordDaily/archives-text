# Anemic Chappie Out Today; New Emphasis on Quality (?)
## 
### 
I lie < ha pa ml conies out with a new streamlined edition to
day—-that means Hthinner litis time and there is even less m if
than ever before. We guess they have switched to quality (?) from
quantity now.
J !)<• pundit , *)l the 4 alif >ruia sagebrush ;»rc offering 35 cents'
worth of S v (Totally Void of) parody thi.vtime with a few partisan
reviews thrown in.
I*in illy the editors have stopped ravaging the innocent young
maidens of Hie freshman class for the Old Boy's Queen and pre
sent senior Rev Glassford as their "Toast of the Town."
Also in this month's tissue thin issue is the cruelist of all cuts
a C hris Harlow, D, YVarbucks and P. Walker write on "Daily
Misquotes, Vol. 131." In contrast with the unbiased publicity gen
erously given by The Daily this erroneous double-cross looks like
the vilest Communist slander.
Other articles sure to be nominated for the Pulitzer Prize are
"Whiskey Snags Pink Nightsc" hv Abie Ghoul Van Barf and John
McKelfey and "Just Another Plain Old Saturday" by Frank Bea
quaert.
In all honesty it must be admitted that the < happie has won
Compact Magazine's Order of the Prime Rib for its Saturday Eve
ning Pyle, Lurk, Lie issues in 1054, '55 and respectively.
