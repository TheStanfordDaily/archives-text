!\LvV N ORK, Feb. I' 2 (UP) Dockworkers from Maine to Virginia
went on strike tonight upon expiration of an 80-day Taft-Hartley
"eooling-off" period which failed to produce an agreement between
the International Longshoremen's Association and North Atlantic
shippers.

bargaining session that its 4.1,000 i
members affected by the talks'
would not work without a con-1
traM.
Alexander Chopin, head of the)
New York Shipping Association, j
which represents the employers, I
said after the session: "We have!
the makings of a contract. The
gap between us has been consider
ably narrowed."
Offer Rejected
Bui the ILA negotiating com
mittee said it would be guided by
last week's "overwhelming 14-to-l
vote of our membership rejecting
the employers' last offer."
The union, whose 15,000 South
Atlantic and Gulf Coast members
reached an agreement during the
"cooling off" period, was free to
strike at 6:10 p.m. from Maine to
Virginia. But the full effect will
not be felt until tomorrow, since
only skeleton crews work at night
President Eisenhower received
a report from Labor Secretary
James P. Mitchell on negotiations
involved in the eastern strike of
the longshoremen.
Hagerty Optimistic
White House Press Secretary
James Hagerty said. too. that it
was "reasonable to expect that if
the parties continue discussion a
contract will be successfully nego
tiated for New York."
Hagerty said the federal gov
ernment planned no further steps
"at this time" in the dock strike.
In New York, the luxury liner
Independence eased into her berth
without the aid of tugs. The liner's
docking crew secured her, then
walked off, leaving the passengers
to handle their own luggage
The port of New York is already
reeling under the effects of a 12-
day walkout ol 1000 tugboat, har
bor craft and barge workers.
