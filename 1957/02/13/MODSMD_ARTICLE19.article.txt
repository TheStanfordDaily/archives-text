## Propose Six-Point 'Hands Off' Policy In Effort to Scuttle Mideast Doctrine 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Feb. 12 (UP)—The Soviet Union de
m Hided tonight that the United Nations take up the Eisenhower
Middle East doctrine and U.S. military policies as "acts of aggres
sion" threatening world peace.
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister V. V. Kuznetsov put forward the

demand in a letter to General As
sembly President Prince Wan
Wailhayaion of Thailand. Quick
discussion of the item, Kuznetsov
said, would "strengthen the ef
forts of member states of the
United Nations aimed at lessen
ing international tension."
Kuznetsov denounced the new
U.S. Middle East doctrine, the in
creased U.S. military budget for
1957-58, the expansion of Western
bases around the world, the sup
ply of atomic weapons to North
Atlantic Treaty Organization al
lies, the remilitarization of West
Germany and the appointment of
German General Hans Speidel as
NATO Central Europe ground
forces chief, as "acts of aggres
sion."
A US delegation spokesman
said of the Soviet demand: "It
sounds like more of the old propa
ganda we have been hearing all
along." The spokesman called it
a move which woulql not "get any
where" in the UN.
Surprise Shown
Other delegations leaving UN
headquarters for the day ex
pressed surprise at the Soviet an
nouncement but no deep concern.
Kuznetsov's action was an
nounced shortly after he called on
Secretary-General Dag Hammar
sk.jold. There was no comment
on l heir conversati<Tn.
Meanwhile in Moscow, Russia
proposed a six-point "hands off"
program for the Middle East to
try to scuttle the Eisenhower doc
trine.
Foreign Minister Dmitri T. She
pilov opened a major Soviet of
fensive against the doctrine in a
two - hour policy address before
the Supreme Soviet (parliament).
Laced With Charges
Hife six point program was
laced with charges that the Unit
ed States seeks "dictatorial" pow
ers in the Middle East I hat would
even turn Britain and France into
"senior vassals" of America. He
said the U.S. policy is aimed at
starting a "war of aggression at
the first opportunity."
Shepilov said Russia and the
Western Big Three should leave
the Middle East alone, offer it
economic aid, negotiate its peace
and stop arms shipments.
"By the so-called Eisenhower
doctrine," he charged, "the U.S.A.
intends to cover the area with a
network of atomic bases, flood it
with its troops, and at the first
opportunity start a war of ag
gression from the area."
Program Principles
His alternative program would
follow these principles:
® ' The maintenance of peace
in the Near and Middle East
through settling disputed ques
tions exclusively by peaceful
means, by negotiations."
♦ "Non-interference in the in
ternal affairs of the Near and
Middle East, respect of the sover
eignty and independence of these
countries."
• "Renounce any attempts to
include these countries in mili
tary blocs with the participation
of the great powers."
m "The liquidation of foreign
bases and the withdrawal of for
eign troops . .
* "Mutual renunciation of the
supply of arms to the countries
of the Near and Middle East."
° "Co-operation toward the
economic development of the
countries of the Near and Middle
East without making any politi
cal. military or other conditions
