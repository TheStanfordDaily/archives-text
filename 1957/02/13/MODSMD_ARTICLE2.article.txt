## 
### 
Mis. F. Donald Guthrie, direc
tor of the Women's Gym, foilod
what apparently was an attempt
rd robbery Monday morning, ac
cording to Police Chief Gordon
I )avis.
At 8:10 a.m. Monday, Mrs. Gu
thrie saw a man inside the gym
and tried to apprehend him. The
man ran through the front door
and into the parking lot with Mrs.
Guthrie in pursuit.
As Davis said, "She called to a
number of students to help her
chase him. She was willing to
take him on alone, but none of
thr> Stanford 'Braves' were will
ing to help."
Mrs. Guthrie described thr man
as about 25 years old, from 5-11
to 6 feet and clad in a blue sweat
er and tan slacks. He was neat
appearing, Mrs. Guthrie said.
Davis theorized the intruder
may have been the same man
who snatched a purse containing
$2',) in the Women's Gym several
weeks ago.
