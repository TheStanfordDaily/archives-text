# Senate Group Approves Ike's Mideast Plan
## democrats Jump Party To Back Economic Aid Suggestions by 17-11 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (UP) â€”
A joint Senate committee today
defeated a Democratic drive to
strip President Eisenhower's Mid
die East resolution of its contro
versial economic aid features.
r I he 17-to-ll vote by the com
bined Armed Services-Foreign Re
lations committees was a major
test for the "Eisenhower Doc
trine." The committee also de
feated two other attempts to
water down the proposal.
The Senate actions indicated
that the resolution will win com
mittee approval in substantially
its present form, probably tomor
row.
Critics' Fire
Critics of the proposals centered
their fire on the economic aid fea
ture, which they charged would
give Eisenhower a "blank check"
to spend $200 million in the Mid
dle East.
Chairman Theodore Francis
Green (D-R.1.) of the Foreign Re
lations Committee and Chairman
Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.) of th*
Armed Services voted with nine
other Democrats to knock out this
provision.
But four other Democrats jump
ed the party line to vote with 13
Republicans against the amend
ment. It was sponsored by Sen.
Harry F. Byrd (D-Va.).
Aid Not Eliminated
The Byrd amendment would
have eliminated all military aid
and economic assistance from the
resolution, leaving it similar to
the military declaration approved
by Congress during the Formosa
crisis in 1955.
Voting with Byrd, Green and
Russell for the motion were Dem
ocratic Sens. J. William Fulbright
(Ark.), Hubert H. Humphrey
(Minn.), Mike Mansfield (Mont
John C. Stennis (Miss.), Wayne 1
Morse (Ore.), Stuart Symington
(Mo.), Russell B. Long (La.) and
Sam J. Ervin Jr. (N.C.).
The four Democrats voting
against it were Sens. John Spark
man (Ala.), Estes Kefauver
(Tenn.), Henry Jackson (Wash >
and John F. Kennedy (Mass.'
Sens. Lyndon B. Johnson (Tex 1
and William Langer (R-N.D )
were absent and not represented
by proxies.
