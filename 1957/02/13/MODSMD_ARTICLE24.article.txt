# A 						Mockery

"( »ivf. ME YOUR TIRFD, your ]v;r , -yearning to
hi eathe free," it says on the pedestal under
the Statue of Liberty, hut the present immi
gration laws make a mockery of this appeal
to oppressed people- everywhere.
Representative Francis Walter, co-author of
the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, is one
of those who wishes to continue the mockery,
lie has criticized President Eisenhower for ad
mitting Hungarian refugees, on the grounds
that they are either Communists or- i( not. ; will
deprive Americans of jobs.
\\ hat Walter must realize is that if we want
to win the satellite countries over to the free
world, then we must show more than just
words.
Vi e stood helpless while brave people were
slaughtered by Russian guns and tanks.
We did the least we could when we admitted
21,500 refugees when other countries of the
free world wt r e admitting many more.
Walter says.he first 6200 admitted lo the
I nited States were Communists. Last month
only three "subversives'" were found in the first
group admitted, and 32 expert inspectors are
processing the refugees. Besides, circumstances
li.nl lorced them to he Communists in a Red
dominated country.
I he main difficulty goes beyond Walter.; it
lie- in our present immigration quota, which
almost excludes entirely peoples from eastern
Europe.
At present 154,000 immigrants may enter the
United States each year less than one seventh
of I per cent of the total population.
Ouota for the British Isles is 65,000 Half

of >t ii rarely used. Countries like Hungary,
Poi aid Rumania who are suffering under
Com: .unist oppression are hardly given any
spar .- aL all. It would take 99 years to allow
eve: vone from Italy who wanted to come to
the 1 niled States, if we stuck to the present
quota limit.
A more sensible distribution ie definitely in
order. The quota should take into account the
number requesting admission and should be
flexible so that. ; if one country does not use its
quota, anothei could make use of what is left
over.
Both the House and the Senate are investi
gating hills which would make the system
more flexible and would raise the limit to
250,000.
We also hope they change another law—the
main part ol the VleCarran immigration law
which allows the Attorney General or a mem
ber of his statt to deport a refugee for sub
versive activities or leanings, with little evi
dence of hearing. This provision certainly
makes one think of the Russian political exiles
to Siberia.
Ex Pieaidenf Truman was right when he told
Congress in 1 ( >52, "Ottr present quota system
is not only inadequate to meet present erner
gency needs:, it is also an obstacle to the de
velopment <»112 an enlightened ;md satisfactory
immigration policy f'oi the long-run future.
We hope that Congress and the President
do something about this deplorable situation
this year so we can become the warmhearted
nation that the inscription on the of
Liberty says we are.
