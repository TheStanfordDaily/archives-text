War-Path Again
Editor, The Daily:
The living conscience of our University—Mr.
Haig Bosmajian—ls on war-path once again,
warning us against vils of conformity
("Concern With Uvmr int Issues," Eeb 1 i,
1957). This time ! ... r. nr.w item on the list
of his grievanc :..,ti,tigatioii of Communis!
professors, and its effect on learning. This prob
lem, however", seems to be a minor one in com
parison to his recurring themes of "militarism"
on campus, and—above all—the Hungarian Revo
lution.
Somehow, this Hungarian fight for freedom

has been bothering Mr. Bosmajian ever since last
Oct. 23. He just can't understand why The Daily
"came out in favor of aiding and abetting a group
of persons who have attempted to overthrow the
established government through the use of force
and violence." ("Think Twice Over Hungary"
by H B, Nov. 15, 1956.) In effect it is beyond
Mi Bosmajian's understanding why The Daily
agreed with 40 some-odd countries within the UN
condemning Russian atrocities in Hungary
He seems to be very much against the Hun
garian freedom fighters who tried to win hide
pendence through force, and, quite interestingly,
in last Monday's letter lip is ill disposed also
toward The Daily for not commenting on a Com
munist-suspect px professor who is being inver.
tigated by a Senate group Meanwhile Mr. Bos
majian is piously implying that such an action
may endanger academic freedom This freedom
is being annihilated in Hungary and in other
Russian dominatpd states prpciseiy by that power
whose interest this ex-professoi has been serving
