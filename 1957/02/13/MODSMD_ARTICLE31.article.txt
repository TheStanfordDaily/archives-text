## Radio Club Sponsors Morse Code Class To Encourage New Licensed Members 
### Lynn Patchett 
"I've met people who have ex
pressed their desire to join the
Radio Club, and the only thing
holding them back is the Morse
code," sAys Ken Taylor, president
of the club. "With our new code
class, this goal can be reached."
The Stanford Amateur Radio
Club is organized for promoting
interest in amateur radio, trans
mitting and talking to other hams
all over the world. To encourage
all those interested in ham radio
to get a license, the clifb has pur
chased a Morse code machine,
which is being installed in the
basement of Crothers Memorial
With the new code machine,
students who wish to get licenses
will be able to hear the code being
transmitted and will gel used to
hearing it come in over earphones
or over the loudspeaker. The club
is planning a semi organized class
for interested students, while they
will be allowed to operate the ma
chine individually as well.
There are three kinds of li
censes novice, general and extra
class. As to the time it would take
to get a license, Taylor said: "The
novice license will probably lake
about one month, while the 13-
word license might take three to
four months. We have found that
the main stumbling block is the
Morse code. I would say that any
Stanford student could pass the
theory requirements lor getting

a license il he has his code under
control."
In connection with tin 1 new code
class, the club has set up an asso
ciate membership. The code ma
chine will be available to associate
members on payment of $1 dues
per quarter. When they become
full members, alter getting their
licenses, they will have use of all
club equipment. The only require
merit for associate membership is
ari interest in ham radio. For
membership, students may get in
touch with secretary-treasurer
Gary Deley at Toy on.
The Radio Club owns a 1000
watt transmitter, with the maxi
mum power allowed by the FCC,
which is capable of handling all
standard amateur band frequcn
cles. With this transmitter it is
no trouble contacting the Fast
Coast, and club members have
talked with South America, Fu
rope, Africa and the South Pa
cific. In fact, the members often
regret that they don't have the
language fluency to talk to these
countries, according to Taylor.
Besides the kilowatt transmit
ler, the Radio Club also owns
equipment for single side band op
oration. The antenna's location is
one of the most ideal in the area,
since it is placed on the side of a
hill behind the Ryan high-voltage
laboratory.
There are several other trans

millets owned by the club mem
hers individually. Most of the
members have mobile car sets.
The club plans !o buy more equip
inenl in the near future.
At present there are 20 active
members in the club and some in
terested visitors. Most of the
members are electrical engineers.
In fact, Taylor has observed that
approximately 20 per cent of the
FF department are ham opera
tors.
There are no women in the club
now, Iml there is no restriction on
their being members. According
to Noun Chapman, vice-president,
members may be as act we or in
active as they wish. Although
there is no listening post set up
at the transmitter, members may
use it 21 hours a day.
The club's trustee and faculty
adviser is Dr. O. (Â». Villard of the
Radio Propagation Lab. He has
been with the club since 1938.
