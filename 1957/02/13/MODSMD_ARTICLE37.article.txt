# What's it like to be AN IBM SALESMAN?
## 
### 
Selling fo management is perhaps the best training for management, and
it's the reason Gene McGrew joined IBM. Today, he possesses a
thorough practical Business Administration education, responsibility, ai
excellent income—all at age 27. Read about an unusual career.

You're Gene McGrew ,.. high school
footballer and class officer. You won a
scholarship and went, through Prince
ton in t he top third of your class . . .
managed varsity track.. .commanded
an artillery battery in Korea . . .
"When you put a lot of preparation in
fo your career," Gene McGrew feels,
"yon should expect a lot. of opportunity
in return"
Meets IBM representative
Out of the Army in 195.3, Gene mpt.
an IBM representative. It sounded
like opportunity. A few interviews
later. Gene was sure. Although sales
was only one of the many job3 he felt,
he could handle, this kind of selling —
(IBM machines are as much an idea
as a product,) —promised to occupy
every talent, he possessed. Betides,
he's learned that "no other form of
training produces so many top busi
ness managers

Then began a 13 months' training
program marked by merit salary in
creases. First—3 months' schooling
and observing operations in Pitts
burgh (Gene's hometown). Next—2
months' studying the applications of
I PM's eleetronic data processing ma
chines in business, science, govern
ment, and defense. Followed by 7
months' practical training in the field,
with customer contact. Followed by
IliM's famous course in selling meth
ods. Finally, assignment to a sales
territory near Pittsburgh, responsible
for about 14 companies and their ex
ecutives who used IBM equipment,
and a dozen or so more who were
logical prospects for it.

Mokes first sole
Gen o 's first sale. t<> a bank, required
thorough Gtudy; consultations; a writ
ten recommendation. The climax
came, Gene remembers, when he
submitted his analysis to the vice
president and received that, gentle
man's signature.

Gene's latest, sale was to a large
industrial corporation. He's now pre
paring this customer for the installa
tion of an IBM electronic system
designed to simplify financial pro
cedure; inventory and other systems
problems. At27,Genefindshimself top
man on an important account. He's
educator, salesman, administrator.
How would Gone define soiling?
"We feel the best, way to sell is to be
able to consult. The best way to con
sult. is to l<now something of value
your customer doesn't. IMM's 'some
thing of value' is profit through
automation."
Gono's thoughts on competition:
"The entire Office Machine Industry
feels the lead pencil is the biggest
competitor. You've no idea how many
time-consuming clerical jobs can be
mechanized, thus freeing people for
important, creative jobs. IBM's suc
cess in the field is due to service,
knowledge, 'know-how'."
Does Gone find his youth
a handicap?
"It's what, you know —not how old
you are—that counts. I deal with
executives twice my age on a basis of

equality, because they respect my
training and my business judgment."
Future wide open
"I'm getting married soon, and I was
amazed to realize how much security
IBM's growth (sales have doubled on
the average every five years since
1930) and benefits represent. But I
think my real security lies in the
chance to use my own ability fully
and freely. There are nearly 200
Branch Managerships, 15 District
Managerships and executive positions
in 5 other divisions ahead of me IBM
is introducing new machines, systems
and concepts so fast that, every Mon
day, we have a 'new idea' meeting
just to keep up."
IBM hopes this message will give
you some idea of what, it's like to be a
salesman at IBM. There are equal
opportunities for E.E.'s, I.PL's,
M.E.'s, physicists, mathematicians,
