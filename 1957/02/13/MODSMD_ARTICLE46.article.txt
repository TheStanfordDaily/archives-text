# Wagner, Indian Playmaker, Had 'Best Game' Against WSC
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Tf;i|) Warner may not be the
highest Scorer on the Stanford
basketball team, but 1 here's no
doubt that lie's the man who puts
the spark into the Tribe's scrap
py, ball-hawking play.
Last weekend, however, Wag
ner got into the scoring act in
addition to playing his usual top
flight floor game. The 5-11, 175-
pound guard looked sharp scor
ing 10 points Friday against
Washington State. Saturday", he
came back to pour in 111 points.
Wagner figures that the Satur
day game and his 14-point per
formance against California last
year at Berkeley are the two best
games he has played at Stanford.
All year long the Stanford cap
tain and three-year varsity man
has harassed opponents on de
fense, stealing the ball and break
ing up passes on numerous occa
sions. On offense he has set up
a good deal of Coach Howie hall
mar's plays and has sneaked in
for surprise lay-ups on more than
one occasion.
Wagner feels the Indians will
give UCLA a good pair of battles
in the coming weekend's series
at the Pan Pacific, but he hesi
tates to make any further predic
tion since he has not yet seen the
Bruins in action.
Of the PCC teams Stanford has
faced, Wagner rates Cal as the
best. lie looks for the Bears to
gain at least a split against Wash
ington and to go on to represent
the conference in the NCAA re
gional*. In non-conference action
lie rates Western Kentucky as the
Indians' top foe and places thein
about on a par with California.
As far as the bii>' men in I be

i PCC are concerned, Wagner was
I most impressed by Washington's
I Doug Smart. (Jabe Arillaga of
the Hears gets Wagner's nod as
the best back court man the In
dians have met this year.
Wagner is following one year
j behind his brother Ron, who also
played varsity basketball for the
I 1 ndians.
Both Wagners are members of
Delta Tail Delta fraternity. Hap,
however, lives off-campus with
j his wife.
Wagner's plans for next year
I are centered around three quar
ters of graduate work in mechani
cal engineering. He would also
like to play more basketball, pos
j sibly in one of the Peninsula city
I leagues. However, studies will
definitely get his first eonsidera
| t ion.
