# Quality One-Acts Show Caliber of Student Talent
## Plays Show Fine Acting, Writing, Directing; Leading Lady Taken Ill 
### 
lii three dislinctly different offerings, the Ram's Head Winter One
Ads proved last night that a high quality production can he written,
directed and performed using student talents alone.
Aside from an unfortunate illness which prevented Sue Fogle,
leading lady in "Nothing But Ihe Rain," from finishing the perform-

anee, all three plays came off
smoothly in polished, highly skill
ed presentations.
"Rain," which opened Ihe eve
ning, is steeped in the current Ac
tors' Studio vogue as popularized
on the screen primarily by James
Dean. It concerns a troubled
youth, played convincingly by Mi
ehael du Pont, and a girl, whose
love is the only barrier between
Ihe boy's sensitivity and insanity.
When he loses her to an older
man, he loses his mind also.
Actors Capture Style
Several of Ihe actors have cap
lured the style of acting appro
priate to such intense doings. Miss
Fogle, in particular, looking Eva
Marie Saint like, never overplays
and achieves a delicate blend of
gentle understanding and a de
termination for her own happi
ness.
Director Phillip Lowden has in
duced uniformly good perform
ances from Karen Opsahl, Lair
Parent, Carla Wood and Nancy
Rhodes, and Margaret Christen
sen's striking setting enhances I lie
mood of William O'Brien's play.
"The Loving Male"
"The Loving Male," an uproar
ious comedy directed by Glenn
Du√üose and written by Timothy
Welch, is a proverbial laugh riot.
Suffice lo say I hat much of Ihe
action takes place on a double bed,
and Ihe leading characters are an
American couple honeymooning
in Mexico.
David Whorf and Helen Guer
rant, as newlyweds Jack and 10,
are presented with a prize lot
being the most proficient love
makers ever- observed by Peeping
Toms Lair Parent and Jim Glea
son. This leads to marital doubts
as lo where Ihe other member of
the team got so much experience
and, more important, to some
clever comic situations. Shirley
Douglass, an eager-to-help Mexi
can maid, winds up on Ihe bed a I
intermittent intervals and gener
ally adds to Ihe fun.
"Roger Anderson"
A beautiful and perceptive piece
of writing by Terry Comito
emerges as engrossing theater in
"The Passing Away of Roger An
derson," the final play of the
group. An allegory with comic
touches, the message that a per
son may die in Ihe minds of those
around him without actually ex
piring physically is illustrated by
Roger, who has died as far - as his
mother, aunt and grandmother
are concerned. Yel he roams about
the stage listening to I hem dis
cuss his death.
Despairing that no one will no
tice him, he finally goes upstairs
and completes his death with a
self-inflicted rifle bullet. The la
dies, finding him dead, think he
must be someone else, and go on
talking about their beloved Roger.
Despite Ibis somewhat obscure
meaning, the acting is done in a
realistic style which gradually
clarifies and sharpens Comito's
ideas. Director Joe Regan has
created an enormous build lhat
piles conflict on emotion on his
trionies until the explosive climax
when all three women begin talk
ing frenetically themselves, oh
livious not only to Roger but to
everything.
Marie Brierley, Shirley Doug
lass and Nellie Norris are three
beautiful ladies who, having been
effectively unglamorized. turn in
superb performances. George
Ralph and Sam Reis are also et
feclive as the Reverend Carls and
Roger Anderson, respectively.
The Ram's Head Winter One
Acts will continue through Satur
day night at the Little Theatre.
