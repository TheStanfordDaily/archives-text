# EDITORIAL
## An Unshackled Press 
### 
An amendment came before i .egislature last night. It.-, ultimate
aim is doubtful, but its immediate provision > to make the
editor of The Daily appointed by tlie ; tii<lent bodv president
on approval of Legislature.
Lite Daily editorial board may nominate »!;«• people
to mil for editor, under this proposal, bill the president and
Legislature have the final choice; the staff has none. We be
lieve that this is wrong.
It will lead to domination of 'I he Daily by tire ASSU presi
dent. Ihe editor he picked might be weak ; be might be one
who would be in good standing with the president but would
be journalistically and administratively pooi
We contend that the staff, having worked with the candi
dates, having seen what each candidate did for the paper, would
be far more qualified to choose its own editor,
The Daily is a volunteer staff. Admittedly ii makes mis
takes. 't is only here to put out the best paper it can At least
the staff is entitled to the right to pick its own editor. Other
wise staff morale would sink to a low level.
We are also concerned with what precedent Hie amendment
could set. In the last 40 years no legislation has ever been
passed restricting The Daily in its freedom. The passage of this
piece of legislation could lead to the passage of more legislation,
maybe not this year, but in the future. This would ultimately
mean complete domination of The Daily by the president and
Legislature.
V. e challenge the way in which the amendment was drawn
up. Last week we encouraged members of Legislature to come
in and discuss The Daily il they had any suggestions or criti
cisms. Cooperation was the answer to our problems, we said.
Three hours before Legislature met, the Legislature liaison
committee put the proposed legislation on our desk. No advice
from The Daily had been sought. No forewarning had been
given.
We invite all members of Legislature or any other interested
persons to write letters pro or con on the proposed legislation.
X\ e will do our best to print all letters which we receive on
this issue, giving both the student body and its Legislature the
chance to express their aims and opinions.
We believe that this is not only a question concerning The
Stanford Daily but also the principle of freedom of the press.
It is up to the students and their Legislature to decide.
