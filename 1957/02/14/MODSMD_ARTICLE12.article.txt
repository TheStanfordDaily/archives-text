# Glover Discloses Suggestions For Fraternity House Plans
## 
### 
A possible plan to solve the housing problems of fraternities is
currently under consideration by the University, according to As
sistant to the President Frederic O. Glover, who addressed the Delta
Chi's and Eucalypto last night as part of the Stanford Today and
Tomorrow series.
Ten fraternity houses on campus are almost beyond repair. This

disintegration of houses has been
fostered by economic problems,
due to the houses charging an
insufficient amount for living ex
penses of members and due to
lack of sound financial planning
"If something is not done soon,
in time the fraternities will in
evitably have to accept many
more members and lose the ad
vantage of small-group living,"
stated Glover.
« Tax Ruling
In addition to the economic
problem of the houses themselves,
an Internal Revenue ruling stat
ing that all gifts to fraternities
are not tax exempt has handi
capped the donations of outside
gifts. (Under the new Internal
Revenue Bureau tax ruling, gifts
to fraternities would be tax ex
empt only if the University were
willing to accept ownership of the
fraternities.) With these gifts the
University could build units of
from three to four houses run by
fraternity men. with one central
kitchen. This operation would
serve about 200 men or less, de
pending on unit size.
Glover stressed that these plans
are iust being considered, they
haven't been submitted to the
president for approval "We want
to let fraternity men know what's
on our minds, and hope they'll
help us find a solution to the
house problem The long • range
forecast as it now stands
gloomy. This plan could be done
well if done properly," Glover
said.
Long Range Progrnni
The plan would be a 15-20 year
program. Glover added that
houses in good shape now would
ho encouraged to keep themselves
that way.
"No plans have been made to
raise tuition in 1957-58," said Glov
er. Regarding future enrollment.
Glover said next year's freshman
class will be cut to 11 BO some 100
men and 30 women less than the
class of '60. This is being done to
keep freshmen in Wilbur and to
relieve crowded conditions in the
women's dormitories.

The plan would be a 15-20 year
program. Glover added that
houses in good shape now would
ho encouraged to keep themselves
that way.
"No plans have been made to
raise tuition in 1957-58," said Glov
er. Regarding future enrollment.
Glover said next year's freshman
class will be cut to 11 BO some 100
men and 30 women less than the
class of '60. This is being done to
keep freshmen in Wilbur and to

On fraternity housing
A possible plan to solve the housing problems of fraternities is
currently under consideration by the University, according to As
sistant to the President Frederic O. Glover, who addressed the Delta
Chi's and Eucalypto last night as part of the Stanford Today and
Tomorrow series.
Ten fraternity houses on campus are almost beyond repair. This

disintegration of houses has been
fostered by economic problems,
due to the houses charging an
insufficient amount for living ex
penses of members and due to
lack of sound financial planning
"If something is not done soon,
in time the fraternities will in
evitably have to accept many
more members and lose the ad
vantage of small-group living,"
stated Glover.
« Tax Ruling
In addition to the economic
problem of the houses themselves,
an Internal Revenue ruling stat
ing that all gifts to fraternities
are not tax exempt has handi
capped the donations of outside
gifts. (Under the new Internal
Revenue Bureau tax ruling, gifts
to fraternities would be tax ex
empt only if the University were
willing to accept ownership of the
fraternities.) With these gifts the
University could build units of
from three to four houses run by
fraternity men. with one central
kitchen. This operation would
serve about 200 men or less, de
pending on unit size.
Glover stressed that these plans
are iust being considered, they
haven't been submitted to the
president for approval "We want
to let fraternity men know what's
on our minds, and hope they'll
help us find a solution to the
house problem The long • range
forecast as it now stands
gloomy. This plan could be done
well if done properly," Glover
said.
