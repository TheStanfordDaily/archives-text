### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 13 (UP)
— The combined Senate Armed
Forces Foreign Relations Com
mittee today approved a sharply,
modified form of President Eisen
hower's Middle East "doctrine"
The 20-8 vote sends the resolution
to the Senate floor.
Just before the final vote, the
commitee approved a last-minute
modification by Senator Hubert
H. Humphrey (D-Minn.) which
softened the language of the
President's original request The
committee previously had defeat
ed all major attempts to water
down the proposal.
The substitute, approved by a
vote of 15-13, would state that the
United States "is prepared to use
armed forces to assist" any Mid
dle East nations or group of na
tions threatened by Communism
,! if the President determines the
necessity thereof."
Request Approved
But it does not specifically give
the President the "authority" to
use such forces' as requested by
the administration. The House
already has approved the Presi
dent's request.
Despite the change, eight Dem
ocrats, including some of the Sen
ate's most influential members,
voted against the proposal on fi
nal passage. It was approved by
a combination of seven Demo
crats and 13 Republicans.
Adoption of the Humphrey pro
posal came as a surprise.
Return to House
If the full Senate upheld the
committee action, the proposal
would have to be returned to the
House for consideration of the
Senate changes. It could accept
the alterations or send the reso
lution to a conference committer
to thresh out differences.
The administration's original
proposal would state that the
President was "authorized to em
ploy the armed forces of the Unit
ed States as he deems necessary
to secure and protect the territo
rial integrity and political Inde
pendence of any [Middle Easf|
nation or group of nations re
questing such aid against ovei 1
armed aggression from §ny na
tion controlled by international
Communism."
