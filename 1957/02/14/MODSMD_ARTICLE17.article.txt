V " 3 I Not Serve Purpose
To the Editor:
Upon attending the Legislature meeting this
past evening I was much disturbed by both a
f.i'vo of legislation which was brought before
1 1 ...t body and by the tenor of the debate which
' .flowed soon after. The legislation was, in short,
I proposal (in bylaw form) to transfer the.selec
-11'..n of the editor of The Daily from the hands
of the Daily staff to the hands of the president
ci A '11. The limited discussion which followed
qiickh degenerated into a mere clash of person
ii Both tacts are unfortunate.
,'ader the terms of this new legislation, norni
' on o.i the Daily editor would still rest with
J ditoi ial Board and the Staff. From these
tees, however, the ASSU president would
'• t. with the approval of Legislature, the actual
I t. The president would be required to choose
i m - 1 minimum of three candidates, with the
—"~e a p r-ualified for the
*
r. ig was doubly unfortu
- t'-e kindness shown by President
H< 3 Freelen in allowing a question, which trig
t.'.'i't d the debate, and the kindness of the Legis
lature, which approved and allowed the discussion
t! t followed. The discussion should have re
ma i ied on the question at issue, ft did not.
The question at issue was the merit of such
ill ion as was proposed. Upon this question
i ii rt is bound to be a strong division in thn stu
.: body, the Legislature, and, 1 hope, among
! tacuity and staff of the University interested
t o values of any free society. These are high
■ aiding words, but at this point they must
ume a vitality for anyone who reads The Daily
or has any stake in our student government.
I I is very easy to condemn such proposed legis
lation as the tirst step in a set of gag rules to
muffle the press. This is not necessarily true,
but it very well could be. The situation auto
matically leads to the analogy of what would
happen should there be only one newspaper in
tlUnited States capable of criticizing the gov
« i nment, with its editor, appointed by the Presi
<Vnt, subject to the approval ot the Congress,
aehow, this is not very appealing.
I idoubtedly, Legislature is legally capable of
d aug such a thing as has been proposed. Tradi
' i illy, practically and morally, they are to be
-baptised and condemned. Undoubtedly, Legisla
te s members who support this measure feel
they are doing the Uni' . . Ity a service. Thev
are not.
The proposed ; incorporating this
'• 'elation will r • betoro the Bylaws Commit
t' " -t 4 o'clock next Wednesday. This meeting
i c oen to the public; all those who have any
1 'inion at all on the matter should attend, if it
pos ible. The recommendation of the commit
11l come bpfore the Legislature next Wednes
night. This meeting will be open also, and
tull discussion will be in order.
As a final note, let it be said that this legisla
tion did not follow the usual course of bylaw
amendment, through Publications Board. Most
changes to the Publications Board standing rules,
fa :orm of this legislation, are at least brought
bef"r? t'-r> 1 for appr- i\ this case it is
• ~*Mature lid no eel that all of
the pub ca he University, assembled to
pe!her, would approve or sponsor such an in
vasion of their traditional prerogatives.

LASSU and the Daily
Editor, The Daily:
This evening at G, T received a phone call in
forming mo that a measure or great interest to
those involved in student publications at Stanford
would be brought before LASSU. Upon attending
the regular meeting held at 7 o'clock, 1 found that
indeed a matter of importance was presented.
A bill was submitted for its first reading which
proposed to, starting at the beginning of the next
term, make the editor of The Daily subject to
appointment by the president of the Associated
Students from a list of three submitted by the
Daily staff.
Several important questions came to my mind
upon hearing this proposal:
(1) What good reason could there be for such
legislation? Provide closer co-operation?
(2) But why should there be such co-operation?
Would we have a better Daily as the result of
such co-operation?
(3) If such co-operation were desirable, why
weren't the available means to secure this used 9
I had always thought that the Publications Board,
a subsidiary organization of the ASSU, existed for
I his purpose.
(4) Why was the proposal presented so sud
denly lhal almost none of those interested in
Stanford publications knew about it in advance?
Does someone have a personal axe to grind?
Upon consideration of the questions which I
posed to myself, I would answer thai:
U) Probably the ASSU would like to have
more "co-operation" from The Daily co-opera
tion in the presentation of more news of the cam
pus iri a more thorough manner. This, indeed, is
desirable. But might not co-operation also involve
less criticism of the LASSU than has been forth
coming in the last few months? This, I feel,
would be undesirable.
(2) Does not Tlip Daily exist—although it is
granted that i( is a function of the ASSU to
serve the traditional purposes of reporting the
news AND TO CRITICIZE THE STATE OP
THINGS AS IT SEES FIT WITHIN THE LIMITS
OF TRUTH? Might not the former type of
cooperation be better secured in some other,
more friendly, manner while the latter type be
actually a prostitution of the functions of our
newspaper?
(3) It occurs to me that it was very wrong of
Ihe sponsors of this measure to present it to
LASSU without tirst consulting the Publications
Board, although they may have under legal
demand to do so. Such action has now caused ill
will which any form of new legislation will not
undo. Co-operation is more difficult to' secure
with a stick than with a carrot.
(41 After attending the meeting I finally con
cluded that this legislation was ill-considered and,
1 feel, serves the purpose of self-aggrandizement
for a very small leading clique of our student
government.
The nature in which the measure was presented
leave* a bad taste in my mouth. My opinion of
stu .overnment has fallen. Not only are the
avowe purposes of this measure more harmful
than beneficial, but it is absolutely incapable of
achieving its own doubtful goals.
