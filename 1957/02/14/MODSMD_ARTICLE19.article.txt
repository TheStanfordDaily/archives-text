# Enrollment Crisis to Face Colleges
## 
### Sherry Speer 
U.S. colleges, currently coping
with the biggest enrollments in
history, are bracing themselves
for the coming invasion of war
born students which could double
the number of college entrants in
10 years.
The Feb. 4 issue of Time, in a
special report based on surveys
conducted by Time correspond
ents at leading centers of higher
education throughout the U.S.,
says: "Never before have so
many Americans wanted to get
into college and never before
has the competition been so keen
. . . The number of high school
students who go on to college has
jumped from 15 per cent in 1940
to 40 per cent."

Even with the present record
enrollment of 3,250,000 students,
the 1800 U.S. colleges and univer
sities can still keep up with the
demand. The real crisis will come
with the expected influx of war
babies who are now reaching col
lege age, Time reports. By the
time the present crop ol first
graders is ready for college, says
Dean of Admissions Arthur Howe
Jr. of Yale, enrollments, may soar
to between 5,000,000 and 8,000,000
So far, only the big name col
leges, mostly in the East, have
really felt the first impact of the
great tidal wave.
Stanford's Director of Admis
sions Rixtord K. Snyder says that
although the number of applica
tions to Stanford increases signil
icantly each year, the University
will keep the number of under
graduates at its present level

which is approximately 4900. Sny
der says that <*it of every four
students who apply to Stanford,
one is accepted. This ratio may
seem stringent but compared to
Dartmouth, which must choose
72. r > out of 6000 applicants, the
problem here is relatively slight.
Actually, Time reports, the
problem is all too real right' now
for thousands of high school stu
dents. In their panic to get into
college, today's youngsters have
acquired the habit of applying to
as tnariy schools as possible. Be
cause of these multiple applica
tions, the favored schools are
haunted by "ghosts," students
who are accepted but go else
where. Stanford estimates that
35 per cent of rhose it accepts will
not show.
With more and more students
to choose from, the big name cam
puses are becoming more and
more selective. At Harvard the
number of students on the dean's
list has gone up from 27 per cent
before World War II to nearly
40 per cent.

The dean of admissions of a
famous Ivy League university
likes to give the old grads a joli.
"If you were to apply for your
alma mater today," he is quoted
as saying, "only 20 per rent of
you would get in."
The new wave of applications
has also had an el feet on publicly
supported institutions. Time says
that those that are required by
law or tradition to take in every
taxpayer's child with a high
school diploma within their states

have begun to wonder whether
they can expand rapidly enough
to maintain their open-door pol
icy. Some have already answered
no.
Since California has the most
elaborate junior-college system in
the country, the university is able
to require that applicants have a
B average in high school. But in
other states ■where junior colleges
are rare, many educators have be
gun to worry about what the tidal
wave of students will do to their
schools unless admission stand
ards go up.
Educators Worry
But, Time reports, some educa
tors have begun to worry wheth
er the emphasis on brains and
tests might go ton far. Many
state-supported schools still feel
they have a moral obligation to
give every taxpayer's child his
chance, even though lie may
flunk out. Says Admissions I>i
rector Robert Jackson ol Oberlin:
"You have tb leave the door open
for the Winston Churehills. It is
said of him that on the basis of
his school record he wouldn't he
admitted to any college today."
To Headmaster Lloyd M. Clark
of Pennsylvania's Kiskiminetas
Springs School, the big competi
tion for education is not a crisis
but a cause for rejoicing. The rise
in admission standards, he says,
has altered the atmosphere all
over the campus. In classrooms
the professors can insist on high
achievement levels and dismiss
the loafer . . . The time lias
come when the college student
must really produce. . . . How
the educators love this!"

Educators Worry
But, Time reports, some educa
tors have begun to worry wheth
er the emphasis on brains and
tests might go ton far. Many
state-supported schools still feel
they have a moral obligation to
give every taxpayer's child his
chance, even though lie may
flunk out. Says Admissions I>i
rector Robert Jackson ol Oberlin:
"You have tb leave the door open
for the Winston Churehills. It is
said of him that on the basis of
his school record he wouldn't he
admitted to any college today."
To Headmaster Lloyd M. Clark
of Pennsylvania's Kiskiminetas
Springs School, the big competi
tion for education is not a crisis
but a cause for rejoicing. The rise
in admission standards, he says,
has altered the atmosphere all
over the campus. In classrooms
the professors can insist on high
achievement levels and dismiss
the loafer . . . The time lias
come when the college student
must really produce. . . . How
the educators love this!"
U.S. colleges, currently coping
with the biggest enrollments in
history, are bracing themselves
for the coming invasion of war
born students which could double
the number of college entrants in
10 years.
The Feb. 4 issue of Time, in a
special report based on surveys
conducted by Time correspond
ents at leading centers of higher
education throughout the U.S.,
says: "Never before have so
many Americans wanted to get
into college and never before
has the competition been so keen
. . . The number of high school
students who go on to college has
jumped from 15 per cent in 1940
to 40 per cent."

Even with the present record
enrollment of 3,250,000 students,
the 1800 U.S. colleges and univer
sities can still keep up with the
demand. The real crisis will come
with the expected influx of war
babies who are now reaching col
lege age, Time reports. By the
time the present crop ol first
graders is ready for college, says
Dean of Admissions Arthur Howe
Jr. of Yale, enrollments, may soar
to between 5,000,000 and 8,000,000
So far, only the big name col
leges, mostly in the East, have
really felt the first impact of the
great tidal wave.
Stanford's Director of Admis
sions Rixtord K. Snyder says that
although the number of applica
tions to Stanford increases signil
icantly each year, the University
will keep the number of under
graduates at its present level

which is approximately 4900. Sny
der says that <*it of every four
students who apply to Stanford,
one is accepted. This ratio may
seem stringent but compared to
Dartmouth, which must choose
72. r > out of 6000 applicants, the
problem here is relatively slight.
Actually, Time reports, the
problem is all too real right' now
for thousands of high school stu
dents. In their panic to get into
college, today's youngsters have
acquired the habit of applying to
as tnariy schools as possible. Be
cause of these multiple applica
tions, the favored schools are
haunted by "ghosts," students
who are accepted but go else
where. Stanford estimates that
35 per cent of rhose it accepts will
not show.
With more and more students
to choose from, the big name cam
puses are becoming more and
more selective. At Harvard the
number of students on the dean's
list has gone up from 27 per cent
before World War II to nearly
40 per cent.

The new wave of applications
has also had an el feet on publicly

that those that are required by
law or tradition to take in every
taxpayer's child with a high
school diploma within their states

have begun to wonder whether

With more and more students
to choose from, the big name cam

The dean of admissions of a
famous Ivy League university
likes to give the old grads a joli.
"If you were to apply for your
alma mater today," he is quoted
as saying, "only 20 per rent of
you would get in."
The new wave of applications
has also had an el feet on publicly
supported institutions. Time says
that those that are required by
law or tradition to take in every
taxpayer's child with a high
school diploma within their states

have begun to wonder whether
they can expand rapidly enough
to maintain their open-door pol
icy. Some have already answered
no.
Since California has the most
elaborate junior-college system in
the country, the university is able
to require that applicants have a
B average in high school. But in
other states ■where junior colleges
are rare, many educators have be
gun to worry about what the tidal
wave of students will do to their
schools unless admission stand
ards go up.
Educators Worry
But, Time reports, some educa
tors have begun to worry wheth
er the emphasis on brains and
tests might go ton far. Many
state-supported schools still feel
they have a moral obligation to
give every taxpayer's child his
chance, even though lie may
flunk out. Says Admissions I>i
rector Robert Jackson ol Oberlin:
"You have tb leave the door open
for the Winston Churehills. It is
said of him that on the basis of
his school record he wouldn't he
admitted to any college today."
To Headmaster Lloyd M. Clark
of Pennsylvania's Kiskiminetas
Springs School, the big competi
tion for education is not a crisis
but a cause for rejoicing. The rise
in admission standards, he says,
has altered the atmosphere all
over the campus. In classrooms
the professors can insist on high
achievement levels and dismiss
the loafer . . . The time lias
come when the college student
must really produce. . . . How
the educators love this!"
U.S. colleges, currently coping
with the biggest enrollments in
history, are bracing themselves
for the coming invasion of war
born students which could double
the number of college entrants in
10 years.
The Feb. 4 issue of Time, in a
special report based on surveys
conducted by Time correspond
ents at leading centers of higher
education throughout the U.S.,
says: "Never before have so
many Americans wanted to get
into college and never before
has the competition been so keen
. . . The number of high school
students who go on to college has
jumped from 15 per cent in 1940
to 40 per cent."

Even with the present record
enrollment of 3,250,000 students,
the 1800 U.S. colleges and univer
sities can still keep up with the
demand. The real crisis will come
with the expected influx of war
babies who are now reaching col
lege age, Time reports. By the
time the present crop ol first
graders is ready for college, says
Dean of Admissions Arthur Howe
Jr. of Yale, enrollments, may soar
to between 5,000,000 and 8,000,000
So far, only the big name col
leges, mostly in the East, have
really felt the first impact of the
great tidal wave.
Stanford's Director of Admis
sions Rixtord K. Snyder says that
although the number of applica
tions to Stanford increases signil
icantly each year, the University
will keep the number of under
graduates at its present level

which is approximately 4900. Sny
der says that <*it of every four
students who apply to Stanford,
one is accepted. This ratio may
seem stringent but compared to
Dartmouth, which must choose
72. r > out of 6000 applicants, the
problem here is relatively slight.
Actually, Time reports, the
problem is all too real right' now
for thousands of high school stu
dents. In their panic to get into
college, today's youngsters have
acquired the habit of applying to
as tnariy schools as possible. Be
cause of these multiple applica
tions, the favored schools are
haunted by "ghosts," students
who are accepted but go else
where. Stanford estimates that
35 per cent of rhose it accepts will
not show.
