# Indians Wing to Southland Tomorrow; Battle Bruins in Crucial Series at Pan
## 
### Bob Payne 
UCLA's sixth - ranked Bruins,
jolted from the league top spot by
Washington last week will he ttry
ing to start a new winning streak
tomorrow night when they open
a two-game series with Stanford
in Los Angeles' Pan Pacific Audi
torium.
('oaeh Johnny VV o o d en ' s
charges had a 31 • game Pacific
Coast Conference victory string
broken last Saturday night when
the Huskies, paced by Doug
Smart's 31 points, romped to a
'(i) til win.
The loss was the first for the
Bruins in conference play since
they had been dumped by Stan
frail in the 1955 season opener.
The skein included the final II
Southern Division games of that
season, 10 straight last year in
the pCC's first round robin sched
ule and seven more Ibis season.
Beaten Once
The IJclans' only other loss this
season came at I he hands of t he
tough Brigham Young Cougars.
Currently, UCLA is 1(1-2 and holds
the nation's sixth spot in the
United Press ratings.
The lack ol individual stars at
Westwod this season makes the
Bruins a very tough team to pre
pare lor. Willie Naulls, Morris
Tall and Al Herring, who did (>2
per cent of the team's scoring and
54 per ceiil of (lie rebounding last
season, were lost through graMu
ation. Returning starters are
Dick (Skeeter) Banton and Con
rad Burke.
Burke, G-5, was called the
team's most improved player last
season and has moved into
Naulls' vacated pivot spot this
time around. Hen li< gc is, (>-G, and
.lim Ilalsten, (»-l, two top reserves
last season, have handled the for
wards. (Juards are Banton, out
standing both l his season and last
as a scorer and playmaker, and
sophomore Wall Torrence. Also
seeing considerable action in the
back court is another sophomore.
Fred ('rabl ree.
lOverybody Scores'
UCLA has averaged 70.N points
a game litis season but has nary
a man in I lie loop's leading scor
ers. Rogers lops I he club in team
scoring with 9N points and a 12.3
average, lie is followed bv Ilal
sten, 90; Banton, 89; Torrence,
84; Burke, (M, and Crabtree, 51.
Banton tops the club for the en
tire season v\ith 237 markers in
18 games.
Stanford's scoring punch is be
ing spread out more, too, as
shown in last week's series with
Washington Slate. The Saturday
game saw four Cards in double

figures as Hap Wagner and Carl
Isaacs played their finest and
highest-scoring ball of the season.
UCLA gained preseason wins
over such clubs as Nebraska,
Santa Clara, Brigham Young,
Missouri, St. Louis, Butler and
the Big Ten leader, Indiana. The
Bruins opened their league sea
son with a couple of narrow one
point victories over a Scrappy Ida
ho five. The first of those was a
double overtime thriller.
Last season the IJclans took a
pair of squeakers from Stanford.
They took the first game, 50-48,
and were forced into overtime be
fore taking the second, 81-72. In
that one Naulls picked up 37
points while Tall was getting 25
. . . which just about told the
story.


I.OADIOI) FOR itl{( IX —Kill iiond fires one of his trademark
jump shots over <he head of Al Herring in last year's I'avilion
series. Stanford lost a 50-48 thriller and faded in the second con
test after going into overtime, 81-72.
