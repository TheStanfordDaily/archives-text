# Stanford Glovers Host Broncs Tonight in Final Home Contest
## 
### 
Card boxers make their final
homo appearance this season to
night at S p.m. when they host
the Santa Clara Broncos in the
Pavilion. Admission is free to
Stanford students.
Highlight of the evening for
Indian fans should he the 175-
pound class featuring Bill Samp
son. A rough, aggressive fighter,
Sampson has scored two technical
knockouts thus far this season
against no setbacks.
In the first meet of the year
Sampson came (tut swinging at
the hell and didn't stop until he
was awarded a TKO over Cali
fornia's Don Nemir in 1:50 sec
onds of the first round. Against
Chico State Sampson was the only
Card boxer to win. He scored a
TKO in the second round.
Chuck Bonnet t, a fast improv
ing 156-pounder, won his opening
match, stopping Jim Vogt of Cal
in 27 seconds of the second round.
He was awarded a draw in his
bout at Chico State.
One of the most experienced
men on the squad is George Bat
cabe. in the 147-pound class. A
quick, hard-hitting opportunist,
Batcabe usually provides an in
teresting match.
Battling for Card team points
will be heavyweight Ty Miller,
Tom Ireland and Dave Staudt in
the 165-pound class and Im
pounder Greg Lawlor. Freshman
heavyweight Trev Grim will box
in the exhibition bout.
As usual, the Cards will lose
points via the forfeit route. To
night the Tribe will give away

two points, one each in the 125-
and 132-pound class. However, in
stead of starting with two strikes
against them, the Broncos are
going to be polite guests and give
back a point by forfeiting one of
the 147-pound bouts to Stanford.
Consequently the Cards will go
into tonight's match trailing by
one point. Each team gets one
point for' each bout won. A draw
counts as 'u point for each team.
