# Voltage Multiplier Designed by SRI
## 
### 
The Stanford Research Insti
tute's antenna systems laboratory
has designed and built a voltage
multiplier. Multipliers may be
employed to obtain high DC volt
ages under circumstances where
high currents are not required.
SRl's multiplier is utilized
largely for the simulation of high
voltages created on aircraft by
clouds, which are comprised of
microscopic ice crystals. The dis
charge of the high voltages from
the aircraft extremities causes ra
dio static in the receivers.
