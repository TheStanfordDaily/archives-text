# Young Democrats, Republicans Debate Ike's Foreign Policy
## GOP Speakers Claim International Morality Objective of Administration Programs 
### 
The question oJ the debate: "whether the Eisenhower administra
tion's foreign policy meets Hie needs ol the United States," was set
tler! several months ago by the American public, said Don Proudfoot,
Republican speaker at (lie debate last night between the Stanford
Area Young Democrats and Ihe Stanford Area Young Republicans.

Proudfoot said that the objec
tive of Iho foreign policy of the
United States whs to create a
world of international morality
and cited certain actions of the
Eisenhower administration such
as non-recognition of Communist
China, termination ol the fighting
in Korea, moral and economic
support m Hungary, and the ac
tion in Suez as directed toward
this goal.
Jim White, debater for the
Democrats, claimed that the Re
publicans had shown much incon
sistency in their attitudes before
and after the election. White cited
a statement, by President Eisen
hower on April 21, 1956, that
there was a steady decrease in the
likelihood of war in contrast to
the recent declaration by Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
that the present world situation
was serious and without the pass
ing of the Eisenhower Doctrine
the United States was likely to
become involved in war.
"False Presentation"
White charged that the Repub
licans won the election by a false
presentation of issues and gave
Dulles' statement two days before
the Suez ultimatum was issued,
that the United States' relations
with the Allies had never been
better, as an example of this.
White said that morality cannot
be the goal in foreign policy as
long as there is no universal mor
ality in the wild.
Mike Williamson, the second
Republican debater, admitted that
international morality did not ex
ist but stated that it is something
that must be strived for. He chal
lenged the Democrats to present
a better solution to the situations
which they criticized.
Williamson also insisted that
morality was the basic objective
of Eisenhower's foreign policy
and that aiding Spain with arms
did not violate this morality as
the U.S. has no light to interfere
with internal affair-; oi a country.
"Dulles In Disputes"
Dan Kremer, the second Demo
crat to speak, charged that Dul
les got embroiled in minor dis
putes that should have been han
died by ambassadors and thus
was not present to act in his ofli
eial capacity when a critical situ
ation arose. He called Dulles a
"one man foreign policy."
Kremer attacked the Eisenhow
or Doctrine on the grounds that
ii was concerned with a problem
that did iif>• exist in that it guard
ed the Middle East against an out
side armed attack which was im
probable and would be impotent
in combatting internal subversion
wherein the real danger lies. He
called the plan a doctrine "aimed
to pacify the people."
"It Strong Policy"
White later said that if the U.S.
had a strong global foreign pol
icy we would not need the Eisen
bower Dorlrine, which in reality
created a solution to an improb
able situation. The administration
is concerned with platitudes and
not with concrete programs, he
charged.
The debate was followed by a
lively discussion among the do
haters and the small audience,
during which refreshments were
served.

in combatting internal subversion
wherein the real danger lies. He
called the plan a doctrine "aimed
to pacify the people."
"It Strong Policy"
White later said that if the U.S.
had a strong global foreign pol
icy we would not need the Eisen
bower Dorlrine, which in reality
created a solution to an improb
able situation. The administration
is concerned with platitudes and
not with concrete programs, he
charged.
The debate was followed by a
lively discussion among the do
haters and the small audience,
during which refreshments were
served.
The question oJ the debate: "whether the Eisenhower administra
tion's foreign policy meets Hie needs ol the United States," was set
tler! several months ago by the American public, said Don Proudfoot,
Republican speaker at (lie debate last night between the Stanford
Area Young Democrats and Ihe Stanford Area Young Republicans.

Proudfoot said that the objec
tive of Iho foreign policy of the
United States whs to create a
world of international morality
and cited certain actions of the
Eisenhower administration such
as non-recognition of Communist
China, termination ol the fighting
in Korea, moral and economic
support m Hungary, and the ac
tion in Suez as directed toward
this goal.
Jim White, debater for the
Democrats, claimed that the Re
publicans had shown much incon
sistency in their attitudes before
and after the election. White cited
a statement, by President Eisen
hower on April 21, 1956, that
there was a steady decrease in the
likelihood of war in contrast to
the recent declaration by Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
that the present world situation
was serious and without the pass
ing of the Eisenhower Doctrine
the United States was likely to
become involved in war.
"False Presentation"
White charged that the Repub
licans won the election by a false
presentation of issues and gave
Dulles' statement two days before
the Suez ultimatum was issued,
that the United States' relations
with the Allies had never been
better, as an example of this.
White said that morality cannot
be the goal in foreign policy as
long as there is no universal mor
ality in the wild.
Mike Williamson, the second
Republican debater, admitted that
international morality did not ex
ist but stated that it is something
that must be strived for. He chal
lenged the Democrats to present
a better solution to the situations
which they criticized.
Williamson also insisted that
morality was the basic objective
of Eisenhower's foreign policy
and that aiding Spain with arms
did not violate this morality as
the U.S. has no light to interfere
with internal affair-; oi a country.
"Dulles In Disputes"
Dan Kremer, the second Demo
crat to speak, charged that Dul
les got embroiled in minor dis
putes that should have been han
died by ambassadors and thus
was not present to act in his ofli
eial capacity when a critical situ
ation arose. He called Dulles a
"one man foreign policy."
Kremer attacked the Eisenhow
or Doctrine on the grounds that
ii was concerned with a problem
that did iif>• exist in that it guard
ed the Middle East against an out
side armed attack which was im
probable and would be impotent
in combatting internal subversion
wherein the real danger lies. He
called the plan a doctrine "aimed
to pacify the people."
