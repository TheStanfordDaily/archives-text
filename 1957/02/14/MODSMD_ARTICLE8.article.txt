### 
Leßoy Carter, field organizer
of the Congress of Racial Equal
ity, last nighl described bow his
organization used a four point di
rect action plan instead of mere
legal procedures to end racial seg
regal ion in certain places.
Cartel - , from New York, was
sponsored in a public lecture in
Room Of) by the Stan 112 or d
branches of National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People and Fellowship of Recon
ciliation. Title of his speech was
"How We Have Ended Discrimi
nation."
"CORE was founded in 1012 at
the University of Chicago by stu
dents who were impressed by the
effective passive resistance meth
ods used by India's Gandhi," lie
said.
The Chicago student group was
determined to use the same meth
ods to end discrimination in off
campus places such as restau
rants and barber shops.
The Group linn
Carter said the group plan con
sisted of Ihe following steps:
• Determine if discrimination
existed.
• Negotiate with the establish
ment's owner.
• Use persuasion on Irequent
crs of the establishment.
• I lirect action.
"()l course, if Number 2 method
worked we didn't yo on with the
others," he explained.
He described Ihe first establish
ment - a restaurant in which
they tried their plan.' A mixed
group determined for sure thai
Negroes weren't getting served
Discussions and prayer ses
sions with the owner followed.
Picketing Ihe Place
After these failed, Step con
sisted of picketing the place and
distributing pamphlets, In the
final phase, the group went en
masse to Ihe restaurant and oecu
pied all the seals. Nobody would
order anything unless Ihe Ne
would also be server!
"After four weeks of having
the group go in and slay between
p.m and closing lime, Ihe owner
decided economic pressures were
too much," Carter said. "So he
changed his policy and made a
lot more money in the end by
doing so."
Later Ihese former students
s tart ed other CORE groups
j throughout ihe nation. Dining its
I early years CORE was subsidized
by Fellowship of Reconciliation,
I world-wide pacifist group.
I scs Direct Aclion
( arler said CORE uses direct
action, while NAACP confines it
self only to means.
"Much ol the resistance I'o in
legration is merely a fear of
change," the speaker said.
"When the once all-male Urii
| versify of Alabama admifled its
first women white women
j there was more resistance to that
change than there was when the
first Negro, Autherine Lucy, went
there. Almost every window in
I the white girls' dorm was broken
1 by rocks," he said.
