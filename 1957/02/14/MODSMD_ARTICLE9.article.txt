# LASSU Hears Change in Daily By-laws
## Proposal Would Give ASSU President Right Of Appointing Editor 
### Wally Simpson Associate Editor 
In a stormy session attended
last nigh! by members of The
Daily, The Chaparral, The Quad
and Sequoin magazine, ASSU
Legislature heard the first lead
ing of a proposed amendment to
the Publication Board's Standing
Rules.
The proposed amendment in its
oiiginal form would make the
Editor of The Daily an appointee
of the ASSU president from a list
of three nominated by the Edito
rial Board of The Daily. At pres
ent the Editor is elected by the
Daily staff.
Daily Editor Dave Scott. Man
aging Editor Ellen Spiegl and for
mer Editor Dick Meister present
ed The Daily's view of the pro
posed amendment These views
were discussed and countered by
three members of Legislature No
decision was made at this meet
ing in accordance with Legisla
ture rules.
According to the Daily spokes
men. the proposal would not
achieve any of the desired goals
for which it is intended
They argued that this legisla
tion had been prepared without
proper investigation and without
any advice from people who know
the workings of the organization
They contended that not one bit
of advice was sought from any
member of The Daily or of any
member of Publicatons Board.
These arguments were coun
tered by Legislature members
who contended that Legislature is
competent to write up such legis
lation. though some agreed that
there has not been the proper in
vestigation made on this pro
posal,
Even after Legislature ad
journed for the evening, individ
ual members caucused with visi
tors over this question Discus
sion became quite heated and at
one point ASSU President Bob
Freelen said, in reference to the
position of a college newspaper to
the rest of the campus, "A college
newspaper is a trade journal."
The Legislature By-laws Com
mittee announced that it would
hold an open meeting next Wed
nesday at 4:15 p.m. to discuss pos
sible changes to the proposed
amendment. The location of the
Vneeting has not been announced
yet.
Publications Board Chairman
Don Shoup pointed out to Legis
lature thai if this amendment is
passed in its present form it will
necessitate numerous other
changes in the By-laws
In other action last night Legis
lature approved Axe Society's
new constitution. Tt also voted
down a proposed By-law amend
ment to the effect that Honor
Code violations in the School of
Education not be referred to Judi
cial Council, but be settled by the
Education School Council.
