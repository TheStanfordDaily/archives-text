ALL STANFORD TOUR
1955
"One nf the greatest highlights of the trip lor me was the opportunity
to meet arid he with the Europeans. Most of the hotels in which we stayed
were those used by the natives themselves and not with American
tourists. By virtue of our own chartered bus we were able to route through
the side roads and the countryside where very few tours or American groups
traveler) We stayed and spent much of our time in the smaller communi
ties and towns as well as concentrating a great deal of time in the larger
oti« , We also had the opportunity to meet European students in situa
tion-. which were mutually enioyable and advantageous—such things as a
dartre at the University of London given by one of the men's houses there
and a fondue dinner with Swiss students in Zurich. Some of the people we
met that summer were also friends to contact if any of us were to return
to I 11rope again."
