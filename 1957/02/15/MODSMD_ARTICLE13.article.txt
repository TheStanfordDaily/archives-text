Describing the British, as trying!
"to cast old patter n s in new j
molds." Graham Norton explained i
"English Affairs" in his lIR cul- j
tural talk yesterday at Bowman !
Alumni House.
The combination of the Iradi i
tiouaJ and the new in the "useful I
and dignified" Bi itish < tonstitu
Hon, according to Norton, Bi itish
exchange student, will enable
Britain to "continue to play a
leading role in the world today."
The "efficiency" of Parliament
and the pageantry of the Queen
show these two qualities to Nor
ton.
A film illustrated the British
pageantry, and Norton gave ex
amples of the "useful" Parlia
ment.
Parliament's actions today build
what Norton foresees as "a new j
Britain." Prime Minister Harold j
Maemillan, described as a "man
of initiative," will institute some
new and different changes, Nor
ton thinks. A probable increase)
in atomic power under this new i
leader will make Britain "less de
pendent on the outside world for
fuels."
After the two world wars audi
the Sue/, action, though. "Britain '
can't act independently," Norton j
explained. The results of the Sue/ j
dispute, in which Anthony Eden !
thought the "Suez another Mu
nich and Nasser another Hitler," I
made the people "realize things!
j were different."
