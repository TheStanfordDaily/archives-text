### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 34 (UP)
—Senator Thomas C. Hennings
Jr. ID-Mo.) said tonight that "in
essence, the State Department is
engaging in censorship" by for
bidding U.S. newsmen to travel in
Communist China.
Hennings, chairman of the Sen
ate Constitutional Rights Sub
committee, made the statement in
a letter to Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles.
He said the subcommittee
hopes to get Dulles' "rather un
usual views" on the subject at
hearings scheduled late in the
current Congressional session.
Hennings said the subcommit
tee has been studying passport
policies and"the constitutional
aspects of the question of free
dom of information." He said
both are "directly involved" in
the question of passports for
newsmen to Red China.
He referred to reports that the
State Department is "threatening
punitive action" against William
Worthy, a correspondent for the
Baltimore Afro - American, and
against two representatives of
Look magazine who defied the
ban.
Hennings asked Dulles "what
punitive action you intend to
take, if any" against Worthy. The
senator commented that "powers
granted to the State Department
concerning the issuance of pass
ports, as you know, are limited
powers."
"Any capricious or arbitrary
exercise of those powers is a
threat to the security and free
dom of all our citizens," Hennings
said.
