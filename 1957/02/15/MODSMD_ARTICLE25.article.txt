Ed. Note: Tli? Daily has asked ASSU President Bob Freelen why in Ids opinion the amend
ment to the ASSU by-laws was proposed. Foil swing is his explanation.

The Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity is charged with the administration and
\.ith the conduct of student activities in the
best interests of all S* nf . Midents. The offi
cers and Legislator. 112 •*. a; iciation aie re
sponsible to all si. er..* for ihe conduct ol
these activities and for the annual expenditiue
of more than $118,000 of student money.
The Associated Students can in no way ehiik
its responsibilities. The Stanford Daily is a
government-supported monopoly. Ihe Associ
ated Students grants to The Daily $2.25 foi
each'and every student in ihe University. I his
amounts to more than >17,500 Of every Stan
ford student's tuition, $2.2H plot's aa his forccd
subscription.
Not only is The Daily financed through
student money; it is also the official publica
tion of the Associated Students (see masthead).
It is the only uniform news publication avail
able to the students in the Stanford community.
Thus, the information in The Daily assumes
unusual importance. It is the contention of the
publishers that their fundamental responsi
bility i3 to ensure to the student body its right
to obtain news about the University commu
nity. Ihe student body has a fundamental
light to know what is happening in the com
munity through the newspaper that the stu
dents themselves own.
It is in the best interests of the students of
Stanford University that the editorial policy
of The Daily be controlled exclusively by the

editor. I lie publisher* believe this is para
mount to llit- success of the students news*
p u per, Ihe Daily.
Tht- ASSU has no deMgn 011 the editorial
policy mi editorial prerogative of Ihe Daily.
However ihe growing number of complaints
legistered with the publishers about Ihe Daily
have made inaction impossible. Ihe proposed
change in the selection of the Daily editor is
designed for a twofold purpose: to leeognize
I lit Daih s responsibility 10 ihe students while
retaining the integrity of its editorial policy
The proposed change now before Legislature
leaves the power and the responsibility for the
nc " ? -r> of an editor entirely in the hands
of t> «ly stafl and the Editorial Board. The
ASSU president must choose from those nomi
nated, and the president s choice must then
receive the approval of the Legislature, the
elected representatives of all Stanford students.
Anyone who has any suggestion that will im
prove upon the one now before Legislature will
be very welcome. The purpose of the publisher
is only to better serve ihe students of Stanford.
Is it too much to ask that The Stanford Daily,
owned and published by the students of the
University and retaining, as it does, complete
control of its own editorial policy, accept the
small modicum ol direction by the representa
tives ol ilh owners —the students of Stanford

Tht- ASSU has no deMgn 011 the editorial

The proposed change now before Legislature
leaves the power and the responsibility for the

ASSU president must choose from those nomi

receive the approval of the Legislature, the
elected representatives of all Stanford students.
Anyone who has any suggestion that will im

be very welcome. The purpose of the publisher

Is it too much to ask that The Stanford Daily,
