Aii Open Letter
An Open Letter to ASSU Legislature
Members:
j ->vo reid with great interest the proposed
p • -on - Ptoard b'-'law change affecting the
e ?d|tor of The Stanford D^ily.
.1 -,1 an editor is a complicated and
trie ./ business, because far more than editorials
and policies are involved. Journalism is not the
simple setting down of words on paper, and any
reporter or any editor from any paper you wish
to choose will tell you that.
All persons are not born with an ability to
handle the field of journalism well or even the
ability to learn it satisfactorily. To acquire a
good knowledge of the field of journalism takes
training, and, moreover, it takes years of experi
ence within the field itself—years of experience
the man on Quad does not have.
The problems of the editor of The Daily or of
any other newspaper cannot be handled well by
someone whose opinions, fortunately—or maybe
unfortunately—happen to coincide with those of
his appointers. An editor faces problems which
the average student—elected campus representa
tive or not—does not understand, problems his
own staff does not understand and problems he
himself sometimes doesn't understand. Some
times his decision may not be the best. He may
even be pathetically wrong, but no one insists
that he must be agreed-with all of the time or
even part of the time. A good paper is not sup
posed to be a rubber stamp of just what you
happen to be thinking. You would not read it
if it was.
Do you, members of Legislature, think that you
can do a better, fairer job selecting an editor
for The Daily than mem' -s of the Daily staff
can? Past records that, no matter how
biased and unfair "<ju and a few of your con
temporaries thought, the Daily editor was, at that
time he was the best—and probably only—man
who could handle the job, in the opinion of those
who knew more about the operation of a paper
than you do.
Do you think that any editor can snatch, from
a staff of much less than 100, three people whose
qualifications for the job of editor—journalisti
cally, not personally—are equally good? If you
do, take a look at the trouble a student body of
8000 and more had in finding a student body
pres'dent las" rear and the year before that.
J I hink, becau. 1 " 1 "ou received a
sin 'es in the it itory that you
represent, you are competent enough and have
enough knowle 'ge to select a good editor for The
Stanford Daily? If that amendment passes, I
hope you do. I hope you are more than positive,
and I hope, even more, that you are absolutely
certain that the next student body president and
the next Legislature members are competent, too.
I don't think you can, and I don't think you
will select a good editor. If by some quirk of
fate you do, you won't like him. You'll have to
think up some way to get rid of him, because.a
good editor will not serve the functions you con
sider important. He won't let gratitude to you
change his opinions. He will say what he thinks
and do what he thinks right, regardless of you.
if he,doesn't like your actions or inactions, he
will say so and there will be nothing for you to
do but to get rid of him. After all, he would not
represent the opinion of the majority of the stu
dent body as represented by those they elected—
you. Soon there will be nothing left for you to
do but to appoint one of your own members to
run the paper, and there are times when that is
very hard.

Slav the Foul Dragon
Editor, The Daily:
It appears that a minor miracle has occurred
here on the Stanford campus. Our illustrious
Legislature has emerged from its long slumber
and taken notice of the things around it. For a
long time the members of the Legislature have
f0 warm t h e i r chairs each Wednes
t * a f 'join 7 student represen
. .w*e consistently used every artful

dodge in the book to stay away from anything
which might cause them the strenuous exertion
of thinking. They bemoan the apathetic attitude
of the student body while they remain completely
indifferent to any issue of student interest by
absorbing themselves in the more important mat
ters of by-law changes and approving organiza
tional constitutions.
Now, rather suddenly, Robert Freelen and
Company have become aware of the fact that
their great efforts on behalf of the student body
are being criticized. So it is that they arise to
slay the foul dragon who would slander the fair,
pure name of Legislature. However, they are go
ing about I heir mission in a characteristic way,
with little thought to any ideas but their own.
By seeking to control the Daily Editor, they are
trying to eliminate the main factor in the drive
against their apathy and inaction
The Legislature, such, is in a powerful posi
tion and it is a shame to see so many opportuni
ties lost because it is ridden with so many people j
of inaction. Instead of tabling and lorgetting j
every controversial issue which comes before it, i
the Legislature could be a liaison between stu-!
dent feelings and the faculty It should create
issues of student interest instead of killing them.
More or less, this is what The Daily has sought ;
to point out It is disappointing to see Legisla-j
ture react in this way; it is juvenile and unbe- j
coming of supposedly mature people. Evidently, i
the members of the Legislature have feelings
sensitive to criticism, even when it is justified.
This new amendment would not only make the
Daily Editor a parrot of the Legislature but also
provide its members with a wonder!ul chance to
change more by-laws, which they relish doing.
This amendment is a direct threat to very j
basis of lile on this campus, which is free and j
unrestricted thinking and expression. While all !
may not agree with The Daily on occasions, none
can deny the fad that it never hesitates to give
voice to controversial issues and allow student
expression. The Daily is now free from forced
opinions; let's keep H that way. Don't destroy
the last fortress of student interest on the cam
pus by making it the mouthpiece of an apathetic
and inefficient Legislature.

No Freedom Violated
Editor, The Daily:
I have studied both sides of the proposed 1
chn ■ the ASSU constitution as it pertains
to "i aily, and it seems to me that the change
is, under the circumstances, desirable and neces
sary. I feel that the publication has cut itself off
to a very great extent from the thinking of the
student body, and that the editorializing—at least
the port of the editorializing done on the editorial
page—is so equivocating that the whole paper
becomes a four page tempest in a teapot. The
value of a college news sheet is in its objective
reporting and in its ability to promote discussion i
by means of editorials which are clear and which !
present a case.
If The Daily can be made to realize that it has
a responsibility to gather the views of the stu
dents here at Stanford, to report them and to
analyze them, the paper would be vastly im
proved. And, as far as I can see, this amendment
proposes virtually the only way to do it Going
any further would be censorship. Doing less
would be nothing. The value of the new enact
ment is that it emphasizes The Daily's responsi
bility to the student body
As to the argument about freedom of the press,
1 cannot see how it applies here. Nothing pro
posed will authorize directly or indirectly that
the ASSU president do anything more than
appoint the editor. After that, as I understand it,
his part in the Daily policy is concluded. There
fore, I fail to -ree where freedom is being violated.
This is one of the first times this year when
the Legislature has shown some real backbone.
If it does not act next week as the students desire
it to, the fault will be with the student body for
not communicating its views to the Legislature.
I hope that the new amendment will be adopted
Robert C Guild
