Editor, The Daily:
Absolute freedom of the press is in conflict
with responsibility. No newspaper, except The
Daily, lias absolute freedom. Most papers must
please the leaders or they do not sell or the* ad
vertisers withdraw. However, a large portion
ot the funds supporting The Daily comes from
funds "taxed" from the students and autoniati
tally allotted to The Daily. Thus, The Daily is
in no way responsible to its readers, to the elect
ed representatives of the "taxpayers" or even
partially guided by necessity into the task il is
supposed to perform.
'Ihe job of The Daily is to inform the campus.
Granted, much world news is more important
than campus news However, we will learn of
world events lett out oi The Daily but may never
learn of campus news The Daily ignores There
fore, why does The Daily shirk what only it can
do and is supposed to do in order to cover again,
less expertly, the affairs of the world? This is

only possible because The Daily cannot be re j
quired to do the job it was established and is |
paid to do.
The proposed plan to pick the Daily editor may j
noi i>e ilie right one, bid it is not an extreme one.
Under it The Daily would still retain all the
power the Communist party has in countries it I
controls. The ASSIJ could choose among candi
dates nominated by The Daily just as subject
peoples gei to choose between Communist candi
dates.
Whatever decision is reached, The Daily should '
in some way be held to perform its appointed
function. Tire very loose check proposed on the
editor might be the answer financial independ I
price of ASSU would probably be the answer.
Financial independence o! ASSU would probably
be the wrong answer and would cause too harsh
a penalty for The Daily's transgressions. The
ASSIJ would suiter too under financial independ
ence. Whatever is done, I predict The Daily will
be expected to serve ihe students better.
