# MODEL UNITED NATIONS—By Jack Winkler
## Collective Defense Agreements 
### Jack Winkler 
The preparedness of the United
States to resist Communist ag
gression is largely based on the
collective defense agreements oi
NATO and SEATO. And in the
past weeks Secretary of State
Dulles has said that these organi
zations will be enlarged to handle
economic and social problems as
well
Yet these defensive compacts
are constantly criticized by the
nations of the Communist bloc as
being aggressive and, what is
more, outside the spirit and laws
of the United Nations,
The North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization was signed on April 4,
1949, by Belgium, Canada, Luxem
bourg, France, The Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, the United
States, Italy and Portugal,
The treaty said the Organiza
tion's purposes were:
« ".. . to settle any international
disputes in which they may be
involved by peaceful means in
such a manner that international
peace and security and justice are
not endangered
* ".. to contribute toward the
further development of peaceful
and friendly international rela
tions."
NATO proposed to accomplish
these aims by self-help and mu
tual aid, maintaining and develop
ing their individual and collective
capacities to resist armed attack.
It was in keeping with the spirit
of the UN, in that it hoped to keep
international relations peaceful
without resort to threats or torce
NATO was also in keeping with
the UN charter, which states in:
* Article 51—"Nothing in the
present charter shall impair the
inherent right oi individual or co)
lective self defense if an armed
attack occurs against a member
of the UN."
* Article 52—"Nothing in the
present charter precludes the ex
istence of regional arrangements
or agencies for dealing with such
matters relating to the mainte
nance of international peace and
security as are appropriate for ie
gional action... ."
Even before the treaty was sign
ed, Russia claimed the Organi/.a
tion was unlawful. On March 31,
1949, the U.S.SR. issued a state
ment which objected to NATO be
cause Russia was not included in
it. The statement said she was
the only one of the anti-Axis allies
who was not included, and there
fore the pact must be against her;
but the pact had no need to he
against her because she had no

intention of attacking any mem
ber of NATO.
The foreign ministers of the
NATO countries quickly compiled
a rebuttal lo the Russian claim,
saying that nothing in the treaty
suggests it is against any one
nation.
Another objection raised by the
Russians was that the pact was
not regional and was not set up
for tegional purposes, because ii
included countries In the Western
hemisphere. To this the NATO
ministers answered that nations
on both sides of the Atlantic have
natural community of interest
and democratic ideals.
As a third point, the Russian
statement complained that Italy
and Portugal are in NATO but
not in the UN. NATO answered
that the UN charter did not origi
nate the right ot self defense. The
right exists in international law
Thus the right of seit defense is
available to non-members of the
United Nations.
The U.S.S.R. said that Article
51 of the UN charter says nations
have the right to individual oi
collective self-defense il faced by
armed attack, but the NATO pow
ers were not. The NATO minis
ters had different opinions on the
danger of aggression.
Russia further objected that
Article 53 of the UN chartei states
that " . no enforcement action
shall be taken under regional ar
rangement or regional agencies
without the authorization of the
Security Council," whereas Arti
cle 5 of the NATO pact states that
armed forces will be used without
any authorization of the Security
Council
To this the ministers replied
that Article 5 of the NATO agree
ment states that the nation::; it
attacked may use armed force,
but shall report the matter im
mediately to the Security Council
and shall terminate all their ac
tions when the Security Council
"... has taken tlie measures nec
essary to restore and maintain in
ternational peacp and security."
Finally, liie Russian statement
said that, although she herself has
treaties with the people's democ
racies, these are bilateral and not
multilateral. The U.S.S.R. nulli
lied this argument when il initi
ated the .Warsaw Pact as a col
lective defense agreement among
its own satellites.
Thus NATO, being completely
within the spirit and the .structure
of the UN charter, is a firm and
moral basis for the United State:-.'

Thus NATO, being completely

of the UN charter, is a firm and
moral basis for the United State:-.'
international security.
The preparedness of the United
States to resist Communist ag
gression is largely based on the
collective defense agreements oi
NATO and SEATO. And in the
past weeks Secretary of State
Dulles has said that these organi
zations will be enlarged to handle
economic and social problems as
well
Yet these defensive compacts
are constantly criticized by the
nations of the Communist bloc as
being aggressive and, what is
more, outside the spirit and laws
of the United Nations,
The North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization was signed on April 4,
1949, by Belgium, Canada, Luxem
bourg, France, The Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, the United
States, Italy and Portugal,
The treaty said the Organiza
tion's purposes were:
« ".. . to settle any international
disputes in which they may be
involved by peaceful means in
such a manner that international
peace and security and justice are
not endangered
* ".. to contribute toward the
further development of peaceful
and friendly international rela
tions."
NATO proposed to accomplish
these aims by self-help and mu
tual aid, maintaining and develop
ing their individual and collective
capacities to resist armed attack.
It was in keeping with the spirit
of the UN, in that it hoped to keep
international relations peaceful
without resort to threats or torce
NATO was also in keeping with
the UN charter, which states in:
* Article 51—"Nothing in the
present charter shall impair the
inherent right oi individual or co)
lective self defense if an armed
attack occurs against a member
of the UN."
* Article 52—"Nothing in the
present charter precludes the ex
istence of regional arrangements
or agencies for dealing with such
matters relating to the mainte
nance of international peace and
security as are appropriate for ie
gional action... ."
Even before the treaty was sign
ed, Russia claimed the Organi/.a
tion was unlawful. On March 31,
1949, the U.S.SR. issued a state
ment which objected to NATO be
cause Russia was not included in
it. The statement said she was
the only one of the anti-Axis allies
who was not included, and there
fore the pact must be against her;
but the pact had no need to he
against her because she had no

intention of attacking any mem
ber of NATO.
The foreign ministers of the
NATO countries quickly compiled
a rebuttal lo the Russian claim,
saying that nothing in the treaty
suggests it is against any one
nation.
Another objection raised by the
Russians was that the pact was
not regional and was not set up
for tegional purposes, because ii
included countries In the Western
hemisphere. To this the NATO
ministers answered that nations
on both sides of the Atlantic have
natural community of interest
and democratic ideals.
As a third point, the Russian
statement complained that Italy
and Portugal are in NATO but
not in the UN. NATO answered
that the UN charter did not origi
nate the right ot self defense. The
right exists in international law
Thus the right of seit defense is
available to non-members of the
United Nations.
The U.S.S.R. said that Article
51 of the UN charter says nations
have the right to individual oi
collective self-defense il faced by
armed attack, but the NATO pow
ers were not. The NATO minis
ters had different opinions on the
danger of aggression.
Russia further objected that
Article 53 of the UN chartei states
that " . no enforcement action
shall be taken under regional ar
rangement or regional agencies
without the authorization of the
Security Council," whereas Arti
cle 5 of the NATO pact states that
armed forces will be used without
any authorization of the Security
Council
To this the ministers replied
that Article 5 of the NATO agree
ment states that the nation::; it
attacked may use armed force,
but shall report the matter im
mediately to the Security Council
and shall terminate all their ac
tions when the Security Council
"... has taken tlie measures nec
essary to restore and maintain in
ternational peacp and security."
Finally, liie Russian statement
said that, although she herself has
treaties with the people's democ
racies, these are bilateral and not
multilateral. The U.S.S.R. nulli
lied this argument when il initi
ated the .Warsaw Pact as a col
lective defense agreement among
its own satellites.

multilateral. The U.S.S.R. nulli
lied this argument when il initi
ated the .Warsaw Pact as a col
lective defense agreement among
its own satellites.
Thus NATO, being completely
within the spirit and the .structure
of the UN charter, is a firm and
moral basis for the United State:-.'
international security.
The preparedness of the United
States to resist Communist ag
gression is largely based on the
collective defense agreements oi
NATO and SEATO. And in the
past weeks Secretary of State
Dulles has said that these organi
zations will be enlarged to handle
economic and social problems as
well
Yet these defensive compacts
are constantly criticized by the
nations of the Communist bloc as
being aggressive and, what is
more, outside the spirit and laws
of the United Nations,
The North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization was signed on April 4,
1949, by Belgium, Canada, Luxem
bourg, France, The Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, the United
States, Italy and Portugal,
The treaty said the Organiza
tion's purposes were:
« ".. . to settle any international
disputes in which they may be
involved by peaceful means in
such a manner that international
peace and security and justice are
not endangered
* ".. to contribute toward the
further development of peaceful
and friendly international rela
tions."
NATO proposed to accomplish
these aims by self-help and mu
tual aid, maintaining and develop
ing their individual and collective
capacities to resist armed attack.
It was in keeping with the spirit
of the UN, in that it hoped to keep
international relations peaceful
without resort to threats or torce
NATO was also in keeping with
the UN charter, which states in:
* Article 51—"Nothing in the
present charter shall impair the
inherent right oi individual or co)
lective self defense if an armed
attack occurs against a member
of the UN."
* Article 52—"Nothing in the
present charter precludes the ex
istence of regional arrangements
or agencies for dealing with such
matters relating to the mainte
nance of international peace and
security as are appropriate for ie
gional action... ."
Even before the treaty was sign
ed, Russia claimed the Organi/.a
tion was unlawful. On March 31,
1949, the U.S.SR. issued a state
ment which objected to NATO be
cause Russia was not included in
it. The statement said she was
the only one of the anti-Axis allies
who was not included, and there
fore the pact must be against her;
but the pact had no need to he
against her because she had no

intention of attacking any mem
ber of NATO.
The foreign ministers of the
NATO countries quickly compiled
a rebuttal lo the Russian claim,
saying that nothing in the treaty
suggests it is against any one
nation.
Another objection raised by the
Russians was that the pact was
not regional and was not set up
for tegional purposes, because ii
included countries In the Western
hemisphere. To this the NATO
ministers answered that nations
on both sides of the Atlantic have
natural community of interest
and democratic ideals.
As a third point, the Russian
statement complained that Italy
and Portugal are in NATO but
not in the UN. NATO answered
that the UN charter did not origi
nate the right ot self defense. The
right exists in international law
Thus the right of seit defense is
available to non-members of the
United Nations.
The U.S.S.R. said that Article
51 of the UN charter says nations
have the right to individual oi
collective self-defense il faced by
armed attack, but the NATO pow
ers were not. The NATO minis
ters had different opinions on the
danger of aggression.
Russia further objected that
Article 53 of the UN chartei states
that " . no enforcement action
shall be taken under regional ar
rangement or regional agencies
without the authorization of the
Security Council," whereas Arti
cle 5 of the NATO pact states that
armed forces will be used without
any authorization of the Security
Council
To this the ministers replied
that Article 5 of the NATO agree
ment states that the nation::; it
attacked may use armed force,
but shall report the matter im
mediately to the Security Council
and shall terminate all their ac
tions when the Security Council
"... has taken tlie measures nec
essary to restore and maintain in
ternational peacp and security."
Finally, liie Russian statement
said that, although she herself has
treaties with the people's democ
racies, these are bilateral and not
multilateral. The U.S.S.R. nulli
