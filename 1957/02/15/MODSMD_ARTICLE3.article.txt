# Ike Satisfied With Senate's Mideast Plan

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (UP)
President Fisenhower and Senate
GOP Leafier William F. Knowland |
indicated tonight that the final
congressional version of Hie Ad
ministration's Middle Fast doc
trine will be "entirely satisfac
tory."
The statements were issued a
few hours after Senate Democrat
ic Leader Lyndon B. Johnson
threw his support behind a water
ed-down version of I ho plan to use
U.S. dollars and troops, if neces
sary, to keep Communism out of
the Mideast.
While the statements did not
say so flatly, they left the impres
sion that Fisenhower and Know
land, with Stale Department con
currenee, would accept the Demo
cratic subst.it ule.
The substitute omits specific
"authority" for the President to
commit troops to the Middle Fast.
Instead, it s-ud this country is
"prepared to use armed forces to
assist" any Mideast nation threat
cued by Communism if the Presi
dent "determines the necessity
thereof."
