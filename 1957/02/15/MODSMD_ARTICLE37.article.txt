# Cards Out to Tip Uclans In Southland Tilt Tonight
## Uclan Spuad Ranked Sixth in Nation, Has Dropped Two games This Year 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford will bo out to pull the biggest upset of the Pacific Coast
Conference cage season tonight when the Cards face defending cham
pion UCLA, losers of only two games and ranked sixth in the nation.
II would take a small miracle for the Tribe to still gain the NCAA
playoff berth, but it's not out of the question. It would mean, how-

ever, that the Indians must win
all of their remaining games, with
California losing four.
IJCLA's Bears have a tough ]
road ahead, though, as they must !
meet UCLA-conqueror Washing- !
ton and Southern California on
the road and the Bruins in Berke
ley.
Despite a rash "112 close games,
the PC'C season has been fairly
free of major upsets. Stanford's
70 63 win over Washington last
month stands as the biggest re- i
versa 1 of the season.
Fighting Odds
As the case has boon all season, |
the Cards will be trying to over
come the odds with fight and do
termination. Ben Rogers at (1-6 is
the biggest Bruin, but the starl
ing five averages nearly 6-4.
Unlike last season, the Bruins
have no one-two punch with which
to annihilate opponents. Last year
big Willie Naulls and little Morrie
Taft, first and ihiinl in conference
scoring, were usually enough to
out score PCC foes.
This year Coach Johnny Wood- I
eu has loned down the Bruin fast j
break. Every man on the squad j
now is a dangerous scoring threat.
Four Uruins average in double
figures, with Rogers' 12.3 being
the highest and Connie Burke's
8.0 the lowest of the starters.
IJelan Star
Dick Banton, who got plenty of
rave notices last season with his
sparkling playmaking and clutch
scoring, is generally rated as the
Uclans' top individual star. Ban
ton leads in scoring for the en
tire schedule, having tanked 237
points in 18 contests.
A remarkable thing about the
Bruins is the fact that guards
Banton and sophomore Walt Tor
rence, both 6 1, lead in rebounding
for the season.
Both have averagodÂ»seven re
bounds a game, with Rogers hav
ing an 8.0 rebound average for
the conference.
Efficient Reserves
Six foot sophomore guard Fred ,
Crab tree, who paced the club in!
their victory over the Hig Ten's
best, Indiana, tops an efficient
corps of reserves. Six-six center
Nolan Johnson and forwards Bill ;
Eblen and Roland Underbill have
also seen plenty of action.
Bill Bond, now only 91 points
away from the 1000-point career
mark, will again head the Stan
ford forces. The 6 I forward was
held to his season's two-game low,
27, by Washington Slate last week
and is now tied for fourth in the
loop scoring race.
While Bond was off, however,
Carl Isaacs and Hap Wagner were j
enjoying their greatest nights of j
the season Saturday. Isaacs lop
ped all scorers with 22 markers, |
while Wagner opened up for the [
first time this season and came i
through with 19 points.
Paul Neumann continued his
brilliant clutch play, and the fu
ture looks better and better every
week for the hustling Card sopho i
more. Last week, when the Cou- !
gars threatened to close the gap, ;
it was Paul's shooting and pass- i
ing which pulled the Indians out i
of the fire.
A double victory by the Bruins
would even the Stanford - UCLA I
series at 51 games each. Sirrco!
1916 UCLA has downed Stanford'
33 times while losing only nine!
games.
