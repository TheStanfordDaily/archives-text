# Indian Mentor Howie Dallmar Sets Example for Hoop Fans
## 
### Jack Rannells 
Composure at a basketball
game amidst hundreds of fans
and players in varying degrees
of involvement is not easy to
maintain.
Yet, what is more characteris
tic of Coach Howie Dallmar than
his detached calmness, even dur
ing crucial points of the tight con
tests the varsity has played this
season?
Dallmar, who may occasionally
shoot a quick volley of words at
assistant coaches George Lynn or
Dick Clegg or to an incoming or
outgoing player, spends the bal
ance of the game with chin in
hand in concentrated study of the
act ion.
Major Facet
Calmness, a major facet of the
varsity mentor's personality, fig
ures strongly in his philosophy of
basketball. This extends from his
actions on the bench to his coach
ing methods.
His repose on the bench is a
result of sympathy for the ref
eree's position and his desire not
to damage his team's cause.
"I feel sorry for the referees,"
Dallmar says. "They are doing Hie
best they can. When a coach
raises cain he is bound to affect
the officials." This influence is
indirect and the referees arc not
conscious of it.
Partisan Crowds
Howie believes loudly - partisan
home crowds—especially in small
gyms —also have a profound ef
fect. "The home coach should try
to calm the crowd," Dallmar savs,
"and he doesn't do this when he
is constantly jumping off the
bench."
Visiting coaches suffer most
from recurrent agitation, he be
lieves. "It's tough enough just
playing on an unfamiliar court."
It is interesting to note that
Dallmar's charges have a (> won,
4 lost record at home this season
and a 4 won, fi lost record on the

road, unusually high for away
games.
45-21 Record
This brings the former Indian
athlete's record to 4. r > won, 24 lost
since he returned to the Farm
from his head coaching job at
Pennsylvania three years ago.
Dallmar learned his fundamen
tals from Benny Neff at San
Francisco's Lowell High and Ev
erett Dean at Stanford. From the
teachings of these two and a stint
with (lie Philadelphia Warriors
after WW 11 he has developed his
coaching philosophy, consonant
with his personal composure.
He virtually neglects the fast
break offense, preferring to play
a control game because "we have
had smaller learns lhan the op
ponents.
"My philosophy is - when we
are able to get the ball to work
it in and rely on percentage shoot
ing." Stanford leads the P<'C with
a 12.. r > percentage from the floor.

Composure at a basketball
game amidst hundreds of fans
and players in varying degrees
of involvement is not easy to
maintain.
Yet, what is more characteris
tic of Coach Howie Dallmar than
his detached calmness, even dur
ing crucial points of the tight con
tests the varsity has played this
season?
Dallmar, who may occasionally
shoot a quick volley of words at
assistant coaches George Lynn or
Dick Clegg or to an incoming or
outgoing player, spends the bal
ance of the game with chin in
hand in concentrated study of the
act ion.
Major Facet
Calmness, a major facet of the
varsity mentor's personality, fig
ures strongly in his philosophy of
basketball. This extends from his
actions on the bench to his coach
ing methods.
His repose on the bench is a
result of sympathy for the ref
eree's position and his desire not
to damage his team's cause.
"I feel sorry for the referees,"
Dallmar says. "They are doing Hie
best they can. When a coach
raises cain he is bound to affect
the officials." This influence is
indirect and the referees arc not
conscious of it.
Partisan Crowds
Howie believes loudly - partisan
home crowds—especially in small
gyms —also have a profound ef
fect. "The home coach should try
to calm the crowd," Dallmar savs,
"and he doesn't do this when he
is constantly jumping off the
bench."
Visiting coaches suffer most
from recurrent agitation, he be
lieves. "It's tough enough just
playing on an unfamiliar court."
It is interesting to note that
Dallmar's charges have a (> won,
4 lost record at home this season
and a 4 won, fi lost record on the

road, unusually high for away
games.
