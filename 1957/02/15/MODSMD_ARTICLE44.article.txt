## Boxers Drop Santa Clara in 5-3 Victory Bonnett, Sampson Win First-Round TKO's; Cards Cop 5 of 6 Bouts 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
Although it was St. Valentine's
Day, the Stanford boxing team
wasn't passing out any heart
shaped cards last night as they
slugged their way i<> :i 5-3 team
Vietory over the Santa Clara Bron
cos before a small hill boisterous
Pavilion crowd.
Trailing 2 1 before the first
bout because of forfeits, Coach
Ray Lunny's Curds quickly even
ed the score as Greg Lawlor set
jhe pace by winning :i una-nimous
decision 112 r o m Rronco Ron Pa
checo.
Lawlor's victory was one of the
most crowd-pleasing of the night
to the partisan Stanlord crowd.
Pacheco was a wild, hard-hitting,
aggressive fighter. But Lawlor,
forced to back peddle at times
dining the first round, twice caus
ed Pacheco to slip to the canvas.
Conditioning
Showing less and less respect
for Pacheco's fists, Lawlor began
to wade in more during I he sec
ond round. The third stanza was
all Lawlor as conditioning . told
the tale. Pacheco was a very tired
Bronco when timekeeper Elwyn
Bugee sounded the final, bell.
Rapidly-improving Chuck Bon
net I retained his undefeated stat
us l>y stopping Tom Kelly in the
first round. Sizing up his oppo
nent before getting into the ring,
Bonneti fought a flawless, care
fully planned light.
It only took' !. r >tf-pound Bonnett
1 minute and N seconds to solve
his problem. A short right that
didn't appear to travel more than
inches caught Kelly square on
the jaw and it was all over,
in u Hurry
As usual, jugged Bill Sampson
seemed as though he was in a
hurry to get home. After care
fully stalking his opponent, John
Parker, Sampson began to move
in, and a looping left Knocked
Parker to the canvas.
The Bronco struggled to his feet
and Sampson continued where he
left off. After just a few blows,
however referee Vein By bee step
ped in and stopped the fight.
Sampson was awarded a technical
knockout in 1:2-1 of the first
round.
After Sampson's q u i c k TKO

win, Stanford was leading Santa
Clara, 4-3, and needed t lie heavy
weight match, the final bout of
the evening, to win the team score
and prevent a 4-4 tie.
Unanimous Decision
Card Ty Miller proved capable
of the task as ho outlasted Bronco
Tom Kinsey to win ;i unanimous
decision. Kinsey fought a charg
ing, aggressive fight, but was un
able lo score with any degree of
regularity.
Again conditioning was the key
factor in the win. Miller proved
the stronger of the two and con
tinued lo pile up points during the
second and third rounds. Between
mauling clinches Miller landed
straight blows to the head of Kin
sey to win the decision.
Stanford's only loss was in the
iGH-pound division. The Indians'
Torn Ireland lost a unanimous de
cision lo Art Croseltc. Ireland
loughl Ids taller opponent from
a crouched position, but seemed
unable to solve Crosette's left
handed style.
Although the Broncos forfeited
the 1-iT-pound class, they had a

promising freshman. Tony Dr-Bel-1
lis, who fought an exhibition,
match with Card veteran George I
Batcabe. Batcabe was just too ex- 1
perienced for Deßellis, however. !
i
and the match was slopped in the !
third round after 13 seconds.
Deßellis managed to get in a
few solid blows, but Balcabe was
landing three to ihe freshman's
one. During the second round De-
Bellis was bleeding from bis nose,
and at one point the match was
held up to replace his mouthpiece.
The scheduled exhibition heavy
weight match was cancelled, as
was the extra 1 (if) pound bout.
Judges for the evening were
Ray l-'lores and Mike O'Cara.
Vera By bee was the referee, and
Stanford intramural director Kl
wyn Bugee was the timekeeper.
