# What's it like to be
## AN IBM SALESMAN? 
### 
Selling to management is perhaps the best training for management, and
it's the reason Gene McGrew joined IBM. Today, he possesses o
thorough practical Business Administration education, responsibility, an
excellent income—all at age 27. Read about an unusual career.

You're Gene McGrew ... high school
footballer and class officcr. You won a
scholarship and went through Prince
ton in the top third of your clas3 . . .
managed varsity track.. .commanded
an artillery battery in Korea . . .
"When yon put a lot of preparation in
to your career," Gene MrGrew feels,
"you should expect a lot of opportunity
in return
Meets IBM representative
Out of the Army in 1053, Gene met
an IBM representative. It sounded
like opportunity. A few interviews
later, Gene was sure. Although sales
was only one of the many jobs he felt
he could handle, this kind of selling—
(IBM machines are as much an idea
as a product)—promised to occupy
every talent. he possessed. Besides,
he's learned that "no other form of
training produces so many top busi
ness managers."

Then began a 13 months' training
program marked by merit salary in
creases. First—3 months' schooling
and observing operations in Pitts
burgh (Gene's hometown). Next—2
months' studying the applications of
IBM's electronic data processing ma
chines in business, science, govern
ment, and defense. Followed by 7
months' practical training in the field,
with customer contact. Followed by
IBM's famous course in selling meth
ods. Finally, assignment to a sales
territory near Pittsburgh, responsible
for about 14 companies and their ex
ecutives who used IBM equipment,
and a dozen or so more who were
logical prospects for it.

Makes first sale
Gene's first sale, to a bank, required
thorough stufiy; consultations; a writ
ten recommendation. The climax
came, Gene remembers, when he
submitted his analysis to the vice
president and received that gentle
man's signature.

Gene's latest sale was to a large
industrial corporation. He's now pre
paring this customer for the installa
tion of an IBM electronic system
designed to simplify financial pro
cedure; inventory and other systems
problems. At 27, Gene finds himself top
man on an important account. He's
educator, salesman, administrator.
How would Gene define selling?
"We feel the best way to sell is to be
able to consult. The best way to con
sult is to know something of value
your customer doesn't. IBM's 'some
thing of value' is profit through
automation."
Gene's thoughts on competition:
"The entire Office Machine Industry
feels the lead pencil is the biggest
competitor. You've no idea how many
time-consuming clerical jobs can be
mechanized, thus freeing people for
important, creative jobs. IBM's suc
cess in the field is due to service,
knowledge, 'know-how'."
Does Gene find his youth
a handicap?
"It's what, you know —not how old
you are—that counts. I deal with
executives twice my age on a basis of

equality, because they respect my
training and my business judgment."
Future wide open
"I'm getting married soon, and I was
amazed to realize how much security
IBM's growth (3aleshave doubled on
the average every five years since
1930) and benefits represent. But I
think my real security lies in the
chance to use my own ability fully
and freely. There are nearly 200
Branch Managerships, 15 District
M anagersh ipa and executive positions
in 5 other divisions ahead of me. IBM
is introducing new machines, systems
and concepts so fast that, every Mon
day, we have a 'new idea' meeting
just to keep up."
IBM hopes this message will give
you some idea of what it's like to be a
salesman at IBM. There are equal
opportunities for E.E.'s, I.E.'s,
M.E.'s, physicists, mathematicians,
and Liberal Arts majors in IBM's
many divisions—Research, Product
Development, Manufacturing En-

gineering, Sales and Technical Serv
ice. Why not drop in a**' 1 ,; icuss IBM
with your Placement director? H®

when IBM will interview on your*

Gene's thoughts on competition:
"The entire Office Machine Industry

competitor. You've no idea how many
time-consuming clerical jobs can be
mechanized, thus freeing people for
important, creative jobs. IBM's suc
cess in the field is due to service,
knowledge, 'know-how'."
Does Gene find his youth
a handicap?
"It's what, you know —not how old
you are—that counts. I deal with
executives twice my age on a basis of

equality, because they respect my
training and my business judgment."
Future wide open
"I'm getting married soon, and I was
amazed to realize how much security
IBM's growth (3aleshave doubled on
the average every five years since

Selling to management is perhaps the best training for management, and
it's the reason Gene McGrew joined IBM. Today, he possesses o
thorough practical Business Administration education, responsibility, an
excellent income—all at age 27. Read about an unusual career.

You're Gene McGrew ... high school
footballer and class officcr. You won a
scholarship and went through Prince
ton in the top third of your clas3 . . .
managed varsity track.. .commanded
an artillery battery in Korea . . .
"When yon put a lot of preparation in

Meets IBM representative
Out of the Army in 1053, Gene met
an IBM representative. It sounded
like opportunity. A few interviews
later, Gene was sure. Although sales
was only one of the many jobs he felt
he could handle, this kind of selling—
(IBM machines are as much an idea
as a product)—promised to occupy
every talent. he possessed. Besides,
he's learned that "no other form of
training produces so many top busi
ness managers."

Then began a 13 months' training
program marked by merit salary in
creases. First—3 months' schooling
and observing operations in Pitts
burgh (Gene's hometown). Next—2
months' studying the applications of
IBM's electronic data processing ma
chines in business, science, govern
ment, and defense. Followed by 7
months' practical training in the field,
with customer contact. Followed by
IBM's famous course in selling meth
ods. Finally, assignment to a sales
territory near Pittsburgh, responsible
for about 14 companies and their ex
ecutives who used IBM equipment,
and a dozen or so more who were
logical prospects for it.

Makes first sale
Gene's first sale, to a bank, required
thorough stufiy; consultations; a writ
ten recommendation. The climax
came, Gene remembers, when he
submitted his analysis to the vice
president and received that gentle
man's signature.

Gene's latest sale was to a large
industrial corporation. He's now pre
paring this customer for the installa
tion of an IBM electronic system
designed to simplify financial pro
cedure; inventory and other systems
problems. At 27, Gene finds himself top
man on an important account. He's
educator, salesman, administrator.

excellent income—all at age 27. Read about an unusual career.

You're Gene McGrew ... high school
footballer and class officcr. You won a
scholarship and went through Prince
ton in the top third of your clas3 . . .
managed varsity track.. .commanded
an artillery battery in Korea . . .
"When yon put a lot of preparation in
to your career," Gene MrGrew feels,
"you should expect a lot of opportunity
in return
Meets IBM representative
Out of the Army in 1053, Gene met
an IBM representative. It sounded
like opportunity. A few interviews
later, Gene was sure. Although sales
was only one of the many jobs he felt
he could handle, this kind of selling—
(IBM machines are as much an idea
as a product)—promised to occupy
every talent. he possessed. Besides,
he's learned that "no other form of
training produces so many top busi
ness managers."

Then began a 13 months' training
program marked by merit salary in
creases. First—3 months' schooling
and observing operations in Pitts
burgh (Gene's hometown). Next—2
months' studying the applications of
IBM's electronic data processing ma
chines in business, science, govern
ment, and defense. Followed by 7
months' practical training in the field,
with customer contact. Followed by
IBM's famous course in selling meth
ods. Finally, assignment to a sales
territory near Pittsburgh, responsible
for about 14 companies and their ex
ecutives who used IBM equipment,
and a dozen or so more who were
logical prospects for it.

Makes first sale
Gene's first sale, to a bank, required
thorough stufiy; consultations; a writ
ten recommendation. The climax
came, Gene remembers, when he
submitted his analysis to the vice
president and received that gentle
man's signature.

Gene's latest sale was to a large
industrial corporation. He's now pre
paring this customer for the installa
tion of an IBM electronic system
designed to simplify financial pro
cedure; inventory and other systems
problems. At 27, Gene finds himself top
man on an important account. He's
educator, salesman, administrator.
How would Gene define selling?
"We feel the best way to sell is to be
able to consult. The best way to con
sult is to know something of value
your customer doesn't. IBM's 'some
thing of value' is profit through
automation."
Gene's thoughts on competition:
"The entire Office Machine Industry
feels the lead pencil is the biggest
competitor. You've no idea how many
time-consuming clerical jobs can be
mechanized, thus freeing people for
important, creative jobs. IBM's suc
cess in the field is due to service,
knowledge, 'know-how'."
Does Gene find his youth
a handicap?
"It's what, you know —not how old
you are—that counts. I deal with
executives twice my age on a basis of

equality, because they respect my
training and my business judgment."
Future wide open
"I'm getting married soon, and I was
amazed to realize how much security
IBM's growth (3aleshave doubled on
the average every five years since
1930) and benefits represent. But I
think my real security lies in the
chance to use my own ability fully
and freely. There are nearly 200
Branch Managerships, 15 District
M anagersh ipa and executive positions
in 5 other divisions ahead of me. IBM
is introducing new machines, systems
and concepts so fast that, every Mon
day, we have a 'new idea' meeting
just to keep up."
IBM hopes this message will give
you some idea of what it's like to be a
salesman at IBM. There are equal
