"One of the greatest highlights of line trip for mc was the opporlunily
to meet and be with the Europeans. Most of the hotels in winch we stayed
were those used by the natives themselves and not crowded with American
tourists. By virtue of our own chartered bus we were able to route through
the side roads and the countryside wtjere very few tours or American groups
traveled. We stayed and spent much of our time in the smaller communi
ties and towns as well as concentrating a great deal of time in the larger
cities. We also had the opportunity to meet European students in situa
tions which were mutually enjoyable and advantageous such things as a
dance at the University of London given by one of the men's houses there
and a fondue dinner with Swiss students in Zurich, bome of the people we
met that summer weie also friends to contact if any of us were to return
to Furope again."
