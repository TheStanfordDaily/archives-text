a conceit in Memorial Auditori
um. The program of wide variety
included works by composers of
the baroque through contempo
rary music periods. It was at
tended by a good-sized, apprecia
tive crowd.
The most noteworthy composi
tion of the afternoon was the
"Madrigal" by Leonard Ratner,
associate professor of music at
Stanford. The composer was pres
ent to listen to the first perform
ance of his work. The Stanford
Chorale did a skillful job on the
piece, written for a cappella choir.
The first selection of Ihe after
noon was from"The Ode for St.
Cecilia's Day" by Henry Purcell.
The commemoration was done in
four-part harmony with two cho
ruses broken by a brief interlude.
Fine Voice
Marilyn Poppino, soloist in the
second number, exhibited her fine
voice in Mozart's "ilegina Coeli,
Laetare," K. ins. The lilting
strains of the composition showed
the great amount of work put into
the concert.
"Song of Ihe Fates," Op. 89, by
Brahms, which was Ihe third se
lection, provided a broad contrast
to the preceding number. The
sensitive portrayal of the poem
by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
was a high point in the perform
ance.
Irving Fine's "Epilogue: Design
for October" began the second sec
lion of the concert, which was de
voted to choruses by contempo
rary American composers. The
three soloists in this selection
were Ronald Reitan, baritone;
Claudia Anreasen, soprano, and
Robert MacKinnon, tenor.
Chorale Presentation
After the ehorale's presentation
of the "Madrigal," the male sec
lion of the chorus presented Ran
dall Thompson's "Tarantella." The
Spanish flavor of the composition
lended to their exhilarating inter
pretation.
The entire chorus warmed into
a fine, sensitive presentation of
"The Promise of Living," from
A a r on Copland's "The Tender
Land." The brief composition was
very well done.
The final selection, "In Windsor
Forest" by Ralph Vaughan Wil
liams, provided a grand conclu
sion for Ihe performance. The
four sections presented were Ihe
conspiracy, Falstaff and the fai
ries, wedding chorus and epilogue.
Miss Poppino presented a viva
cious interpretation of the solo
part in the second section.
