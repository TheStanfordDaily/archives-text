Letter to Daily
Mitchell issued the following
statement in a letter to the editor
of fhe Daily:
"Perhaps it was foolish to leave
$580 worth of equipment lying
openly exposed in the lounge
where anyone could come in and
take it, but the people who put it
there were probably confident of
the equipment's safety due to
their faith in the Fundamental
Standard, a tradition to which
Stanford freshmen are very thor
oughly indoctrinated.
"It would be nice to think the
theft was committed by someone
who is not affiliated with Stan
ford and this is certainly possible,
but the chances are equally good
that a group of Stanford students
robbed francos as a practical
joke. If so, they went far beyond
the proportions of a practical
joke.
Fun Stan Violation
"fhis crime is a gross violation
of the Fundamental Standard,
since an entire living group is suf
fering for the thoughtless actions
of a few people."
If the stolen items are not re
covered, Mitchell said money for
replacement would come out of
the house social activity fund and
the pockets of francos men.
'I'he equipment included:

Letter to Daily
Mitchell issued the following
statement in a letter to the editor
of fhe Daily:
"Perhaps it was foolish to leave
$580 worth of equipment lying
openly exposed in the lounge
where anyone could come in and
take it, but the people who put it
there were probably confident of
the equipment's safety due to
their faith in the Fundamental
Standard, a tradition to which
Stanford freshmen are very thor
oughly indoctrinated.
"It would be nice to think the
theft was committed by someone
who is not affiliated with Stan
ford and this is certainly possible,
but the chances are equally good
that a group of Stanford students
robbed francos as a practical
joke. If so, they went far beyond
the proportions of a practical
joke.
Fun Stan Violation
"fhis crime is a gross violation
of the Fundamental Standard,
since an entire living group is suf
fering for the thoughtless actions
of a few people."
If the stolen items are not re
covered, Mitchell said money for
replacement would come out of
the house social activity fund and
the pockets of francos men.
