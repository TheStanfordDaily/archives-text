# Gambling Party Boxes Stolen From Trancos
## Theft Called Violation Of Freshman Faith in Fundamental Standard 
### 
Trancos, one of the eight houses
in Wilbur Hall, has been robbed
of $580 worth of gambling equip
ment, according to Bruce Mitchell,
Trancos freshman.
The equipment was rented in
San Francisco and used at an off
campus beer and gambling party
Trancos gave on Feb. 8. After the
party Trancos' party committee
stored the paraphernalia in the
house's lounge.
'Fhe equipment was to be re
turned by Feb. 11 to its owner,
Kimbel & Graham Co.
Everything Stolen
Mitchell said, "All of the gam
bling apparatus was stolen the
Sunday night before the day it
was to be returned, and no clue
was left as to the identity of the
thieves."
After the crime was discovered,
'Francos social chairman Jerry Ja
cobs reported it to Mrs. Ellene
Sumner, Wilbur Hall director;
Dean of Men William Craig, fran
cos sponsors and the Police De
partment.
Mitchell said Trancos men were
"not sure the equipment was stol
en by anyone at Stanford." But
ho said the gambling parapher
nalia was all in large, innocuous
looking gray boxes giving no in
dication of their contents.
This fact has led Trancos to
believe the robber probably is a
student, Mitchell said.
Letter to Daily
Mitchell issued the following
statement in a letter to the editor
of fhe Daily:
"Perhaps it was foolish to leave
$580 worth of equipment lying
openly exposed in the lounge
where anyone could come in and
take it, but the people who put it
there were probably confident of
the equipment's safety due to
their faith in the Fundamental
Standard, a tradition to which
Stanford freshmen are very thor
oughly indoctrinated.
"It would be nice to think the
theft was committed by someone
who is not affiliated with Stan
ford and this is certainly possible,
but the chances are equally good
that a group of Stanford students
robbed Trancos as a practical
joke. If so, they went far beyond
the proportions of a practical
joke.
Fun Stan Violation
"This crime is a gross violation
of the Fundamental Standard,
since an entire living group is suf
fering for the thoughtless actions
of a few people."
If the stolen items are not re
covered, Mitchell said money for
replacement would come out of
the house social activity fund and
the pockets of Trancos men.
'I'he equipment included:
• One roulette wheel.
• One roulette layout.
• Two blackjack layouts.
• Two craps layouts.
• Two chug-lug cages and lay
outs.
• Decks of cards and dice.
The beer and gambling party
that Trancos gave was held at the
Foothills Club in Sunnyvale, ac
cording to Jacobs. He said hopes
of solving the crime prevented
Trancos from releasing the story
earlier.
