# SU Basketball Band Scores Musical Triumph Over UCLA
## Band Forms Nearly Entire Rooting Section; Plays as Unit Instead of as Individuals 
### Bob Dolan 
The Stanford basketball band made l.he 800-mile round trip by bus
last weekend to "Smogville" Ufsupport the ill-fated Stanford basket
ball team. The expenses of the trip were shared by the Athletic De
partment and members of the band.
The band formed virtually the entire Stanford rooting section for

the two games. The small but
spirited group stopped cheering
only to play its songs. One spec
tator commented, "Those 30 men
make the UCLA hordes look
sick."
In the battle againsl Ihe Bruin
band, the Stanford group, coun
tering "Saints" with "The Money
Tree," was completely victorious.
There was no comparison be
tween the two groups.
"Stanford had the punch. It
was a swinging group. UCLA
sounded like a poor man's Law
rence Welk," commented L.A.
musician Mike Briggs. Band lead
er Bill Hudson was very happy
with the performance. "The guys
really came through," he said. "It
was a pleasure to lead them."
The band returned home last
night. After a night of rest they
will be practicing for this week's
games with SC. They will be
working up some new arrange
ments for those games.
The trip produced a unity in
the band which was apparent in
their playing. They were sound
ing more like a group instead of
a bunch of individuals.
