A\ u l DITORIAL WF." is a device used by news
paper editors to express an opinion without
u iug the personal "I." lu this particular edi
torial the "we Mands for something different.
"We*' means the staff of The Stanford Daily.
First, in journalistic style, we wish to tell
our readers who we are, what we do, how and
why we do it. We are f»f> students in the Uni
versity, members of ASM . We belong to all
undergraduate classes ami several graduate stu
dents are in our ranks. We work in the Daily
'hack anywhere between six and -10 hours a
week, depending on our individual job and
our beat.
Our woVk consists of covering beats, writing
stories, taking pictures, writing headlines, read
ing copy and proofs. Most of us do this on a
volunteer basis. We do it for several reasons.
We believe that a college paper should inform
students of what is happening on its campus
and in the world in which that college exists.
\\ e want to keep ourselves well informed. We
want to learn the techniques of newspaper
reporting.
The Dailv is owned and published by the
Associated. Students of Stanford University.
We receive funds from ASSU and from our
own advertising. W'e, too, are part of the ASSU.
We are directed by an editorial board com
posed of seniors, and occasionally juniors, who
have been promoted to the policy board. I he
rest of us hold different positions and are pro
moted according to the number ol hours and
quality of the work we do.
Admittedly, we make many errors. Some of
us ;ire just learning journalistic techniques.
()ccasioually we forget to write a story, or we
lose it. But we are trying to issue a newspaper

of wliirli the I niversitv, its populace and we
ourselves ran be proud.
i liis Wednesday evening a vote will lie taken
in the Legislature of 111«* ASSU on an amend
nient proposed las! week. I lie substance of
111 is amendment lo llie constitution's bylaws is
111 :i t the Dailv editor uill be appointed bv llie
president of tbe A SSI from a list of three
candidates presented by the editorial board.
We, the stall of The Stanford Daily, would
like to see this proposal defeated. First, we
feel that we who have worked together are
heat qualified to choose our leader. Second,
110 three candidates can he equally qualified
for the post as editor. W s e may sometimes make
mistakes in our choice, hut we do know who
is qualified and in what respect for the job, be
it technique, writing skill, staff relatione, pub
lic relations, or editorial policy. It would be
unfair to ask someone who is not familiar with
the situation to choose between three candi
dates, each of whom has ;i different comhina
tion of the necessary qualifications.
Another objection we have to tbe amend
ment concerns the actual selection of the editor
under this proposed plan. Would the outgoing
president, who is familiar with The Daily's
operations and staff, choose the editor and
then not be here to work with him? Or would
the newlv-elected president, who might be
unfamiliar with The Daily, choose the editor?
These, then, are our reasons for desiring the
defeat of the proposed amendment. We feel
we are qualified to choose our leader. We feel
that co-operation is far more likely lo exist
between The Daily and the ASSU if it is
voluntary rather than enforced by the editor's
obligation to the president of the ASSU. Co
operation cannot be legislated.

"We*' means the staff of The Stanford Daily.
First, in journalistic style, we wish to tell
our readers who we are, what we do, how and
why we do it. We are f»f> students in the Uni
versity, members of ASM . We belong to all
undergraduate classes ami several graduate stu
dents are in our ranks. We work in the Daily
'hack anywhere between six and -10 hours a
week, depending on our individual job and
our beat.
Our woVk consists of covering beats, writing
stories, taking pictures, writing headlines, read
ing copy and proofs. Most of us do this on a
volunteer basis. We do it for several reasons.
We believe that a college paper should inform
students of what is happening on its campus
and in the world in which that college exists.
\\ e want to keep ourselves well informed. We
want to learn the techniques of newspaper
reporting.
The Dailv is owned and published by the
Associated. Students of Stanford University.
We receive funds from ASSU and from our
own advertising. W'e, too, are part of the ASSU.
We are directed by an editorial board com
posed of seniors, and occasionally juniors, who
have been promoted to the policy board. I he
rest of us hold different positions and are pro
moted according to the number ol hours and
quality of the work we do.
Admittedly, we make many errors. Some of
us ;ire just learning journalistic techniques.
()ccasioually we forget to write a story, or we
lose it. But we are trying to issue a newspaper

of wliirli the I niversitv, its populace and we
ourselves ran be proud.
i liis Wednesday evening a vote will lie taken
in the Legislature of 111«* ASSU on an amend
nient proposed las! week. I lie substance of
111 is amendment lo llie constitution's bylaws is
111 :i t the Dailv editor uill be appointed bv llie
president of tbe A SSI from a list of three
candidates presented by the editorial board.
We, the stall of The Stanford Daily, would
like to see this proposal defeated. First, we
feel that we who have worked together are
heat qualified to choose our leader. Second,
110 three candidates can he equally qualified
for the post as editor. W s e may sometimes make
mistakes in our choice, hut we do know who
is qualified and in what respect for the job, be
it technique, writing skill, staff relatione, pub
lic relations, or editorial policy. It would be
unfair to ask someone who is not familiar with
the situation to choose between three candi
dates, each of whom has ;i different comhina
tion of the necessary qualifications.
Another objection we have to tbe amend
ment concerns the actual selection of the editor
under this proposed plan. Would the outgoing
president, who is familiar with The Daily's
operations and staff, choose the editor and
then not be here to work with him? Or would
the newlv-elected president, who might be
unfamiliar with The Daily, choose the editor?
These, then, are our reasons for desiring the
defeat of the proposed amendment. We feel
we are qualified to choose our leader. We feel
that co-operation is far more likely lo exist
between The Daily and the ASSU if it is
voluntary rather than enforced by the editor's
obligation to the president of the ASSU. Co
operation cannot be legislated.
