Inferior Campus Paper
Editor, The Daily:
AVhen I first arrived at Stanford last fall one
of ihe things that caught my attention was The
Daily. It seemed very inferior to the campus
papers I had read in the Midwest. The reporting
appeared to be rather shoddy and the news pol
icy was pot devoted to fulfilling the functions of
a campus paper. An inordinate amount of space
was given to national news, a practice which
resulted in a lack of adequate news concerning
Stanford directly. In brief, it was my opinion,
and still is, that The Daily is corrupted with poor
journalism attitude. I might add that the duty of
a campus paper is not to "create" issues; issues
arise of themselves and it is a paper's duty to
bi ing them to public attention.
Thus, the problem is how to bring about a bet
tor Daily. The concept of "freedom of the press"
is a basic one, but any reputable newspaperman
will tell you that this applies only to freedom
from special interests. A normal paper is sub
ject to the people through its circulation depart
ment. The Daily is not in this classification since
Stanford students pay for the paper with part
of their tuition. Thus pressure must be brought
to bear on The Daily by the Legislature, ihe rep
resentatives of the students. Perhaps the resolu
tion before the Legislature will make The Daily
aware of its responsibilities to 1he school It
should insure a bettei selection of an editor than
could be made by The Daily's tight mling clique
of people who have "grown too big for their
britches."
But much more needs to be done. The Journal
i; in Department should be censured for discour
aging journalism students to work on The Daily.
If qualified people do not take an active interest
in The Daily can we expect the paper to improve?
I am afraid the Legislature is going at the
problem in the wrong way. There seems to be
a preat amount of personal animosity on both
Fides. A climate of personal anger is not eondu
rive to biinging forth a wise solution. A study
1 ould be made of the problem of The Daily, and
this study should be exlensive The Journalism
Department should definitely be consulted Al

though journalism departments are notorious for
knowing little practical journalism, at least one
member of the department is well qualified in
this respect. One thing must be remembered.
This matter is extremely important and no snap
decisions should be made I hope the Legislature
will remember that

INo! Aeeoniplish Purpose
Edilor, The Daily:
Being father intimately connected with an al
lied field of communication—-college radio—I am
very interested in the outcome of the proposed
Publications Board by-law change regarding the
selection of the Daily editor. T am nol going to
discuss the issues involved in this proposed
change: world vs. campus news, ASSU-eontrolled
vs. independent editorial policy, and others. But,
I would like to point out the most obvious argu
ment against the proposed change it will not
accomplish the stated purposes of its authors.
On last Friday's editorial page Bob Freelen
stated that the purpose of the proposed by law
was "to recognize The Daily's responsibility to
the students. . . ." The Daily already recognizes
its responsibilities as it sees them, and ASS1J
selection ol the editor will not change thesn
views.
The proposed by-law is also designed 1o pro
mote cooperation between the ASSIJ and The
Daily. How irtueh%co operation will be promoted
by forcing the Daily staff to work with an editor
they may consider second-best, appointed by an
ASSU president who quite probably will not
know personally the candidates involved? It
would he just as logical to have the president of
the University select the ASSU president from
a list of three candidates selected by the students.
The proposed by-law is much more likely to pro
mote an open rebellion by The Daily or at least
a submissive bitterness toward ASSU. Surely the
members of LASSU can find a more effective
means of promoting cooperation than by impos
ing arbitrary controls.
It this by-law is adopted and enforced, Stanford
may look forward to a weaker student press, 3nd
a more disreputable student government
