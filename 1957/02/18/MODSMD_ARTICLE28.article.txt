Bolli Sides Have a (!ase
Editor, The Daily:
There's a real battle in the air, and people who
never read The Daily before perhaps are now
reading at least "Letters to the Editor." I'd like
to say one thing before the fight gets too thick
for reason: 1 think both sides have a case.
Mr. Guild (Feb. 15, Daily) says editorializing
is "so equivocating that the whole paper becomes
a four-page tempest in a teapot." These wise
words mean exactly nothing. The editorials have
said what they set out to say without being am
biguous or misleading. They have often been
directed to the task of stirring us out of our
apathetic daze. True, they have availed little
but the attempt was made, ami NOT equivocally.
Mr. Guild would like The Inuly to "gather the
views of the students here at Stanford, to report
thern and to analyze them." Hah! Those few stu
dents who have any views to express are already
working for The Daily, or are in some way put
ting their views into action, whether it be ol'fi
cial or committee responsibility. The. rest worm
their way through books to ape the views of the
masters with disdainful intellectuality or blow
beer bubbles at Rudy's. The point is this: The
Daily is handling student opinion with frequent
"What Do You Think?" columns, also runs fea
ture articles on opinion, the latest of which was
a gem of understatement by an English lad who
apparently thinks we know too little, boast too
much. Certainly Mr. Guild is capable of analyz
ing the contents ol an article which reports the
views of one Englishmati or does he need The
Daily to do it for him? Mr. Guild might try a
weekly letter to The Daily, fie might soon have
a job.
Mrs. Grenier and Messrs. Shoup, Fleisher and
Rolls have somewhat outnumbered Mr. Guild in
their pro-Daily arguments. They all seem lo
agree that true freedom of the press is of utmost
importance to a journal which will maintain stu
dent respect. Selecting even one man as editor
is a tough enough job; proposing three, especially
in a "dry" year, would be near the impossible.
There are better ways to deal with the problem.
As it is, The Daily is under-staffed. Maybe some
of the redhots so free with the criticism would
like to go to work with more action, less words.
Critical reporters are better than no reporters!
But these Daily-defenders are a little quick in
polishing off Legislature as a rotten apple. If
they voted iri the last elections, it's likely they
might even have put in some of the representa
tives sitting at those august Wednesday sessions.
Legislature is comprised of student representa
tives. The Daily cannot claim it's fighting City
Mail. It can, however, point out that an apa
thetic student body did not get out the vote.
Legislature, in all probability, does not represent
the entire student body. Perhaps not even half.
This is mostly the fault of the student body.
However, I personally feel The Daily has failed
to present a broad, complete and interesting view
of the studenls running in the elections. In any
event, if Legislature does not represent the ma
jority of the student body, then I do not feel it
has the right to pass on an action which will so
completely affect every student, for The Dailv
is at least widely distributed, if not widely read.
I believe the correct action to take, if any "vote"
must be taken, is to put Ihe issue up to a student
referendum. If others agree with me, I hope
they'll make their views known.
The Daily needs plenty of criticism, but CON
STRUCTIVE criticism. I understand Legislature
appointed a committee to investigate the Daily
operation. This committee may not have done a
thorough job—it's hard to say. But wouldn't
more co-operation ihrough helpful criticism by
Legislature be better lhan friction caused by
ihe policy soon to be voted on? Wouldn't sugges
tions'be better than enforcement? Students vol
unteer their services to The Daily. I'm sure
they'd like to work for a paper entirely irfde
pendent of outside influence.
My own criticism of The Daily is short and
sweet. 1 think The Daily depends loo much on
United Press releases, too little on its reporters'
ability to write about STANFORD.

Nothing (ionslriictive
Editor, The Daily:
Student government at Stanford has shown
once again that it can think of nothing construc
tive to do. Instead of working on real problems
which might take time, effort and good, clear
thinking i.e., the California liquor law all stu j
dent government can think of doing is proposing
an amendment concerning The Daily, and an
amendment is an easy thing to think up. Perhaps
too easy, as is evident from the lack of planning,
preparation and thought pul behind the amend
me nt.
It apparently never occurred to Ine Legislature
that such an amendment was a form of control
over Daily policy. Or did it? An editor, even
though one of those nominated by the staff itselt, j
would be obligated to the Legislature for his job.
And how could he be truly free in giving criticism
of our student government? Is our student gov
eminent so good that it is above criticism ■ If the :
Legislature wants better press relations, it cah
achieve them by doing something useful.
Surely, this amendment was ill-planned and
unwarranted. Daily members know their own
leaders better than the Legislature does. If the
Administration willingly puis no restrictions on j
our press, couldn't our Legislature see lit to fol
low such a fine example?

0«l<* lo Legislature
Editor, The Daily:
Since you'll probably be delyged with prose on
your latest hassle with our brave and true legis
la tors, the following is submitted to add a touch
of variety to your Letters to the Editor columns.
Ode to llie Saddle Shoe Sel
Oh to be a Legislator now thai spring is nigh us' 1
Oh to meet on Wednesday nights to voice my ;
views so pious.
Oil the power that I'd wield o'er all the publico j
tions;
Tf editors should speak their minds, I'd vote them |
forced vacations.
What means this "Freedom of llie Press"! If edi ;
torials vex us, ,
The editor we'll ostracize to the badland wastes
of Texas.
A timid soul we'd then install, who'd bow to our
dictations;
Then we'd be free for further Machiavellian
machinations.
With Legislative hands thus loosed, we'd set the
campus whirling,
And power we'd soon exercise o'er all including i
Sterling!
Oh, Legislators, gods of tin, don't you know thai !
'cause of ya,
We're doubled up with laughter tinged with
overtones of nausea.

Bolli Shies on Trial
Editor, The Daily:
The basis of every change is opposition.
Those who seek change oppose the existing
order; those who object to il oppose the new set
up of the things to come.
All issues are, then, viewed more in a partisan
spirit than on their respective merit. Pig issues 1
are brought into the picture to cloud the real
issues. Motives arc attributed which are of an ;
ulterior nature. Some opposition comes from
the suddenness of the change il sel f.
Changes are not inherently good or bad. A :
change becomes a necessity when circumstances
warrant. A change is welcome when aimed at |
good goals.
To avoid defeat of the changes for the better
ment of the things it seems necessary to prepare
the ground first. Let us make our aims explicit. |
Let us give a chance to their proper scrutiny.
Let us not talk about the phrases like the FREE- |
DOM OF THE PRESS. (I do not think anybody
is in serious disagreement with the blessings it
brought to our society.) Let us not attribute
moiives tr> take the disadvantage of small human
slips. Let us stop mud-slinging.
Instead we should give both The Daily and
the Legislature a fair chance to put their cases
before the bar of public opinion the students.
I suggest a period of two months.
The Daily and the Legislature are both on trial.
Will they rise to the occasion?
