# UCLA Hoopsters Smash Game Cards, 86-63, 79-61
## Bruins Open Up in Second Half in Each Battle On Offensive Blitzkrieg, Rock-Ribbed Defense 
### Bob Payne 
UCLA, nol needing any single
star to carry them through, show
ed why they are ranked No. 6 in
the nation Friday and Saturday
nights witli smashing 86-63 and
79 61 victories over a game but
out manned Stanford five in L,os
Angeles.
The Bruins' blitz-like fast break,
rock-ribbed defense, superior re
bound skill and powerful reserve
crew were just too much for the
Indians to handle. Both games
were decided in a matter of min
utes in the second halves, when
the Bruins literally ran away
from the determined Tribe.
The entire Uclan team played
top-calibre ball, with no one man
standing out. Six-six Ben Rogers
rammed in 22 points in the open
er for UCLA's highest one-man
show of the season.
Sophomore Walt Torrence was
brilliant both nights, defensively
and offensively, and Dick Ban ton
and Jim Halsten played consistent
ball. Substitute Fred Crabtree was
near-phenomenal on occasion, and
lanky Connie Burke supplied the
fuel to Bruin rallies in both
games.
Magic Mark
For Stanford, liill Bond drew
within only 48 points of the magic
1000 mark with 23 and 20-point
performances. All of the Cards
were the same hustlers they'd al
ways been . . . but, for the first
time this season, they looked out
manned.
The Indians fought in usual
style during the first half of the
opener 1 , doggedly catching up ev
ery time the Bruins threatened to
open a lead.
Four last ■ minute points gave
Stanford a 39-38 lead at intermis
sion. t Bond arched in one of his
Jong j u m p e is and sophomore
John Pflueger canned a shortie
for the lead just before the half
ended.
UCLA roared back at the out
set of the second period, however,
and the Cards were left in the
dust. After only five minutes, the
IJclans had a 54-44 lead and were
pulling away.
Almost complete domination of
hoth backboards hy Rogers and j
the 6-5 Burke turned the tide. I

■•Burke scored only nine points in
j the game, but popped in seven of
I them during this five-minute
I surge.
Near-Rout
With Rogers and Torrence per
forming in fine style, UCLA turn
|ed what had been a tight game
| into a near-rout. Sophomore Crab
, tree came on when Halsten fouled
out with nine minutes remaining,
land promptly delivered eight
straight Bruin points to Increase
the margin to an insurmountable
74-56.
Saturday's game star-ted off a
! little closer to form with the
Bruins holding a comfortable six
I to 10-point lead throughout most
of the first half. Bond and Carl
j Isaacs managed to keep ihe Cards
within range all the way, and half
-1 time favored UCLA, 39-33.
The second half had barely got
started before Stanford lost Cap
tain Hap Wagner on fouls, but the
Indians were on the warpath.
Strangely seeming to come to life
when the Bruins went into a full
floor press, the Tribe closed the
gap to 47-44 on two free throws
jby Bond, a jump shot hy Dick
Haga, a Bond jumper, two gift
I tosses from Paul Neumann and
another of Bond's specialties.
Within One Point
Isaacs and Haga teamed up on
a steal, something guards arc sup
posed to do, and Isaacs put in an
easy lay-in to pull Stanford within
one point at 47-46. A lay-in by
Rogers put the Bruins three
points up, but Isaacs dropped in
two free throws to make it 49-48.
But that, for all intents and
purposes, was as close as the
Cards came. Shortly to follow
was the Big Surge by the IJclans,
and it was almost entirely Crab
tree and Burke.
Burke's tip-in made it 51-48, but
the Indians pulled within a single
point again on a set by "Twig"
Warren. Banton's jumper started
the express rolling for UCLA sec
onds later and it was all over.
CrabtreP s c or e d six straight
points, answered only by a jump
er' from Bond, and Burke put in
two straight tip-ins, making it 63-
52. It was Friday night all over
I again.
