Numerous surprises jarred the West Coast basketball picture
yesterday as California hung onto its one-game lead over UCLA
and Washington in the late stages of the Pacific Coast Conference
race.
Underdog Washington State, fifth in the conference, suddenly
came out of the wilderness on Saturday to drop Southern Califor
nia, 70-64. while last-place Oregon pushed Washington into over
time before losing a 65-63 hair-raiser.
Pepperdine camc of age the same night by stunning College of
the Pacific, 76-71, to win its first California Basketball Association
game since entering the league last season. Up to then, the Waves
had lost 22 CBA tilts in a row.
Then there's the case of revitalized Fresno State which upset
first-place University of San Francisco, 56-51, to snap the once
mighty Dons' latest winning streak at seven.
That number didn't prove to be overly lucky for seventh-ranked
Seattle during the weekend, either. The Chieftains had to go all
out to put down Gonzaga, 88-76, in overtime on Friday. The teams
were to meet again last night.
