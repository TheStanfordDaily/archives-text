## Greatly Improved Braves Out-Rebound Frosh; Thompson Hits Winning Basket for Cleggmen 
### Steve Baffrey 
Dick Clegg's Stanford Papooses scored their 10th straight win i
Saturday by dropping George Lynn's Stanford Braves 55 54.
The win was the 13th of the season for the frosh who haven't lost i
a game since they dropped a 42-40 decision to the Berkeley frosh on
Jan. 8.
Saturday's triumph wasn't an easy one for a decidedly less effi-1

! cient Papoose squad which bat
tled a much improved Braves
1 team to the final seconds before
bagging the victory.
Control was one factor which
bothered the frosh team. Although
the frosh garnered their share of
rebounds, they were in trouble
trying to retain possession as they
moved the ball down the court
and were one point down at the
half. 30-29#
Braves Set Pace
Returning to the court for the
second stanza, the Papooses began
to rush the JV offense, but on the
whole the Braves set the second
half pace. The Braves pushed to
an eight-point 40-32 lead at the
3Va-minute mark and widened this
gap to 10 counters at seven min
! utes, 44-34.
It was JV rebounding ability
I that held the frosh down. The
! Bfaves grabbed a good percentage
, from the frosh boards and an ex
! ceptional one from their own.
Fast Breaks
Little John Stahler led a fast
! breaking frosh attack, which
[started with only four minutes to
'go, to bring his team within one
point of the JV's, 52-51. With only
90 seconds left in the game, Dick
Thompson dumped in a two-point
er to give the frosh a 55-54 lead.
After the Papooses froze the
ball for a minute, Stahler was
fouled by JV John Caple in an
attempt to get the ball for his
squad. Stahler's missed free throw
[ gave the Braves possession, and
only a brilliant rebound off the
JV boards by Chris Burford and
Mike Tipton saved the game for
Clegg's squad.

! cient Papoose squad which bat
tled a much improved Braves
1 team to the final seconds before
bagging the victory.
Control was one factor which

moved the ball down the court
and were one point down at the
half. 30-29#

gap to 10 counters at seven min
! utes, 44-34.
It was JV rebounding ability
I that held the frosh down. The
! Bfaves grabbed a good percentage
, from the frosh boards and an ex
! ceptional one from their own.
