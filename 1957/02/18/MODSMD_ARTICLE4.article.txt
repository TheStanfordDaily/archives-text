A constitutional challenge was
hurled last weekend by Senator
Wayne Morse of Oregon against
President Eisenhower's request
for power to commit troops to the
aid of Communist-threatened Mid
dle Eastern countries.
Speaking Friday night in San
Francisco at a meeting sponsored
by the Friends Legislative Com
mittee, Morse said'the President
has Ihe inherent constitutional
power to act in defense of Ameri
can rights, property and vital in

'('rests, hul only Congress can de
clare war or act "offensively" to
defend another country.
He cited the hypothetic instance
of the President acting, without
congressional check, lo commit
American troops to I he defense of
Iraqi territorial integrity if a
Communist â€¢ dominated S y r i a n
army attacked Iraq.
"I for one," he said, "would
never' want to read that I had
voted for a resolution granting
such arbitrary authority."
Ho attacked the pressure (hat
the White House has put on Con
gress to "act with urgency and
no delay" on the Mideast doctrine
when, as yet, no one has "testified
to ;iny foreseeable danger of So
viet military attack anywhere in
the Middle East."
Legislative Heat
"It is not fair," he said, "to the
American people to put legisla
tive heat on the representatives of
the American people."
The fiery Oregon senator also
warned against "government by
secrecy," by which, he said, 80 to
90 per cent of government infor
mation is wrongfully withheld
from the American people.
"The substantive political rights
of the American people can never
be more important than proce
dural protections," In? said. "Free
dom is never - safe in secrecy."
It is too bad, he said, that be
cause of secrecy restrictions the
American people cannot bo told
the reservations many senators
have expressed in committee hear
ings over the President's new doc
trine.
"liny" Support of Arabs
The senator also objected to this
country's attempts to "buy" sup
port of Arab leaders with outright
financial promises.
"I shall not vole one cent of
grant to Arab countries that have
oil to pay for it. I believe in the
good old capitalist principle of
mortgage a loan with oil as col
The President's proposal, he
said, touched only one issue in Ihr
Middle East. Asa more far reach
ing solution, he suggested the
United States secure a ''commit
menl before the fact" that the
Sue/, and Arab refugee dispute ho
submitted to international adjudi
cation and that both sides of the
Arab-Israeli dispute promise to

lay down arms and settle future
problems by judicial processes.
There must be no sanctions
against Israel alone, he said.
"Why pick on the weakest and
most democratic?"
Before going into his foreign
policy address, Morse spoke of
ideals and principles in politics.
Speaking to young people in par
ticular, he said: "The only prac
tice you will ever exercise in your
lifetime is an ideal put into prac
tice. When you compromise your
principle, you lose the principle."
