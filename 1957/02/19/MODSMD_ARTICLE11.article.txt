# Symphony To Perform This Evening
## Salgo Will Direct; Pieces From Three Centuries Featured 
### 
Music from three centuries will
be presented by the Stanford Uni
versity Symphony Orchestra to
night at 8 in Memorial Audito
rium. The 75-piece Symphony is
under the direction of Dr. Sandor
Salgo.
The seventeenth century will
be represented by "Concertino
No. 3" in A major. The work, by
the Italian composer Giovanni
Pergolesi, is for string orchestra
and contrasts solo strings against
the full orchestra.
Soloists will be Gloria Vial and
Peter Werdern, violins; Harold
Hill, cello, and Hazelle Thomas,
harpsichord. Pergolesi's compo
sition will open the concert.
"Symphonic Fantastique"
Hec to r Berlioz' "Symphonie
Fantastique" had its premiere in
1830. This early work in the ca
reer of this French composer ex
presses his ideas in orchestration,
which contrast the sound of col
ors of the many sections of the
expanded orchestra.
The theme behind "Symphonie
Fantastique" is based on the com
poser's love for the renowned
Shakespearean actress, Harriet
Smithson, whom he later married.
The present century will be rep
resented by the contemporary
American composer Roy Harris.
Hist "Symphony No. 3" is one of
the most successful of American
symphonies. In the season 1941 -
12 it was given 33 performances
by orchestras in this country
alone.
Expresses Creed
Harris has expressed his creed
in the following words: "I have
become increasingly convinced
that music is a fluid architecture
of sound and that all the elements
of music — melody, harmony,
counterpoint, dynamics, orches
tration —• must be co-ordinated
into a swift-moving form which
fulfills itself from the root idea
to its complete flowering in or
ganic ornamentation."
The Stanford Symphony is ap
pearing as part of the Tuesday
Evening Series. The concert is
open to the public free of charge.
