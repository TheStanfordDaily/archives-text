# National Guard Calls Army Order 'Kiss of Death'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (UP)
â€”The National Guard Associa
tion accused the Army today of
trying to give it the "kiss of
death" hy ordering all Guard re
cruits to take six months of basic
training.
Maj. Gen. Ellard A. Walsh. As
sociation president, said the
Guard would lose 50,000 men a
year if (he order went through.
This would start ii "down that
long trail of oblivion and ultimate
federalization," he said.
Walsh appealed to a House
Armed Services subcommittee to
prevent "our alleged friends in
the Pentagon" from imposing
"this unpopular program" on the
Guard.
"Hand-off" Charged
He said the Army had failed to
sell its own six-month reserve
training program to Ihr nation's
youths and now wanted il "foist
ed" upon the Guard. If thai hap
pens, he added, "then, in truth,
we shall have had the kiss of
death placed upon us."
Asked why there had been of
forts lo "downgrade" Ihe slate
controlled Guard, Walsh said,
"We don't know whether they ar c
jealous of us, or whether they are
bound and determined there is to
be no national defense force un
less l hey control il lock, stock and
barrel."
Walsh also renewed his feud
with Defense Secretary Charles
E. Wilson, who charged three
weeks ago that the Guard was a
"draft dodging business" during
Ihe Korean war.
Extremely Irirriniis
He branded the remark as "ex
tremely serious, slanderous and
irresponsible." lie said many
young men joined the Guard dur
ing the Korean fighting "with
full knowledge thai I hey were
rendering themselves liable for
active service at a moment's no
lice."
Wilson, who returned last night
from a Florida vacation, will be
recalled hv (he subcommittee lat
er this week to explain his slate
men! and Ihe now training order
scheduled to take effect April I
The crux of the issue is wheth
or Guard heeruits between 17 and
18' years old should be required
to spend six months on active
duty. The Guard does not oppose
such training for older recruits.
II contends that applying the
program to young men of pro
draft age would disrupt their odu
cation and discourage Guard en
iistments. It wants Ihe training
limited to II weeks in this age
bracket.
