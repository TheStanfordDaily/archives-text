# Israel Delays Middle East Talk With U.S.
## UN 						Still Hopes That Ben-Gurion May Pull Troops From Egypt 
### 
JERUSALEM, Israeli Sector,
Feb. 18 (UP) â€” Premier David
Ben-Gurion called home his am
bassador to Washington today
and postponed a major Middle
East policy statement pending
consultations with him on the Is
raeli-American impasse.
Ambassador Abba Eban was
scheduled to fly from New York
tomorrow for a personal report
on his negotiations with Secre
tary of State John Poster Dulles
over guarantees for free naviga
tion in the Gulf of Aqaba.
The Israeli cabinet held its sec
ond urgent meeting in as many
days to discuss the demands for
firmer guarantees than Dulles
has offered.
UN Postpones Showdown
(Meanwhile, in New York the
United Nations General Assembly
tonight postponed a showdown
session on the Middle East in the
hope that Israel might back down
on its refusal to pull its troops
out of Egyptian territory. The
session was delayed for at least
two days after Eban was called
home.)
Unofficial sources said Ben-Gu
rion stood alone in yesterday's
meeting in demanding that the
United States further clarify its
position since the "views of the
two governments are not greatly
divided.
Decision Upsets Plans
Ben-Gurion's decision to post
pone his policy speech upset ar
rangements to have the Knesset
(parliament) vote on his propos
als calling for freedom of naviga
tion in the Gulf of Aqaba before
Israeli forces withdraw from the
Sharm El Sheikh area located in
the southern Sinai Desert which
dominates the gulf.
Israel also has refused to re
move its troops from the Gaza
Strip. But the current dispute pri
marily is over the gulf occupa
tion.
Despite UN resolutions, Israel
has refused to get out until it is
assured that it will have free ac
cess through the gulf to the
southernmost Israeli port of Eliat
(Elath).
Sources said the Israeli cabinet
was as determined as ever in its
demands that the United States
or the UN grant firmer guaran
tees for the protection of Israeli
shipping before there can be any
withdrawal.
Suez Work Stops'
Meanwhile, in Egypt United Na
tions salvage work on one of the
two remaining obstacles in the
Suez Canal was canceled today.
Delays threatened to upset the
clearance timetable.
The clearance operation ap
peared to hinge on the question
of Israeli withdrawal from the
Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip.
Egyptian newspapers have hinted
strongly that Egypt would forbid
work to continue until Israeli
forces withdraw.
Salvage crews tackled the rela
tively minor wrecks still dotting
the waterway and the Suez and
Port Said harbors. But plans for
removing the freighter Abukeir
at the Suez terminus were called
off.
Sources said that unless work
begins at once, the canal will not
be opened to regular tanker traf
fic by the March 10 deadline.
In order to keep the crews busy
pending a go-ahead from the
Egyptian authorities to clear the
big wrecks, salvage chief U.S.
Maj. Gen. Raymond E. Wheeler
put the men to work on smaller
obstructions, including three
tugs, another freighter and a
crane.
