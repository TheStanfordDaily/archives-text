# ON OTHER CAMPUSES
## Who Put the Pants in ...? 
### Dave Canfield 
Bizarre crimes and their aftermaths made
news last week on the Pacific Coast's college
campuses.
At VVestwood, Calif., UCLA students are pon
dering the answer to the question of "Who put
the battered pair of pants on the student store
rack?"
As far as UCLA police can deduce, the question
can be answered this way:
The culprit crept into the student store and"
amidst the notoriously quiet and empty atmos
phere of the place during the semester's first
days, proceeded to disrobe himself of his trousers
in exchange for^ he newer pair.
As the UCLA Daily Bruin said, "How this act
went unnoticed by the patrons of the store is a
puzzle to al! concerned. Though Southern Cali
loinians are known to be a particularly blase
lot, it seems impossible thai an occurrence such
a : this could miss the eyes ol even the most
prying soul."
Textbook thefts are also on the upswing at the
Bruin institution. At neighboring Southern Cali
fornia no less than $1500 worth of items was
stolen from fraternity and sorqrity houses last
week.
Included were money, clothes, golf clubs, fur
niture and a hi-fi record player.

In Moscow, Ida., University of Idaho freshman
Paul D. Matovich pleaded not guilty to Iwo arson
counts in connection with the mid-October fatal
dormitory fires on campus.

A recent University of Washington Daily head
line read, "Mad Microfilm Maniac Louses Up Li
brarians." Director ol Libraries Harry C. Bauer
is wringing his hands over the student or stu
dents who place an "out of order" sign on his
microfilm machine whenever he leaves.
"Sometimes," Bauer gasped, "the student even
disconnects the machine." But a librarian's lot is
not an easy one and this is not all the mystery
that's plaguing the Washington library.
Another student habitually takes an armload
of books from the stacks to a cubby hole on a
special tier where he hides the books on a shelf
area unknown to other library users.
This act of hoarding, Bauer said, leaves the
shelves "mixed up and the staff is most confused
tracking down the missing volumes."
Also creating neuroses among University of
Washington librarians is some of the "advice"
students leave in the library's suggestion box.
One scholar dropped the following suggestion:
"What happened to 715.(>03 111789 (lchtion
tropical Aspects of the Bed Bug)? 1 used to be
able to place bets in it."
The librarian's replw posted like other replies
on the main bulletin board, went, "You must have
your libraries mixed up. We don't have a book
with that number, Webster doesn't admit to such
a word as 'ichtiontropical' and it's books we deal
in--not bookies."
But suggestions have not yet been made for
catching the mad microfilmer or the cubbyhole
stuffer.
