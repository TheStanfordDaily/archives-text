LASSU Members Speak
Editor, The Daily:
The action of the ASSU Legislature has elicited
two major reactions from The Daily. The first is
"1q=s of freedom of the press," and the second,
as overheard at the last Legislature meeting,
"We've worked on The Daily for four years and
now you're going to take it away from us."
These two statements illustrate the very crux of
the matter and have a close relationship to the
reasons why Legislature has proposed a change
in the Daily structure.
The natural response of The Daily, "you're go
ing to take it away from us," seems to be indica
tive of the present trend of thought at the Daily
Shack. How can the Legislature, representing
the Associated Students of Stanford University,
take away a publication belonging to those stu
dents? No one wants to rob himself, but to some
of the people on The Daily, it is a very clear case
of robbery. To feel this way is to admit owner
ship. Because of the power that a daily news
paper has of informing and molding public opin
ion, this feeling of ownership has grown and
become real to a very small group of students at
the Daily Shack. What is being forgotten by
these people is that the real owners of this news
paper are the Stanford students themselves. Ev
ery quarter, each student pays The Daily 75
cents. This means that 8000 students give The
Daily $6000 every quarter. There is no question
where ownership lies.
Here is why Legislature wants to firmly de
lineate where the authority lies in this student
publication. Bob Freelen, ASSU president, re
ceived a letter which said, in part, "I wish some
thing could be done to give the students a better
newspaper. I have tried from my end, but with
out much success. There must be something you,
as the publishers, can do." This letter was writ
ten by a Daily staff member. The letter went on
to say that The Daily received enough advertis
ing to publish a six-page newspaper every day,
making it possible to increase the news coverage
by 60 per cent. As it stands now, 200 column
inches of ads are canceled each week because of
lack of space. This amounts to $2200 for the
quarter. And because there isn't enough news
to print, 320 column inches of ads are used each
week to take up space that is normally used for
news. This may surprise those students who
haven't been able to get publicity for student ac
tivities in The Daily, and, also, the Palo Alto
merchants who couldn't get advertising space
because there wasn't any room. There is a man
power and typesetting capacity, however, al
though the Press says that the capacity can be
increased 200 column inches a day it The Daily
can consistently use it.
As for the other reaction of The Daily, that of
loss of freedom of the press; is freedom of the
press lost when it is returned to those who own
it? Moreover, we seriously question whether
there is true freedom of the press now. A news
paper can be as sarcastic and vitriolic as it wants
as long as it stays within the editorial column.
The other part of the paper is supposed to oe
straight, objective and unbiased reporting. In at
tacking controversial issues, The Daily has con
sistently gone outside the editorial column, under
the protection of a by-line, with sarcasm and
innuendo. For example, Bob Freelen has made
it clear to The Daily that he welcomes construc
tive criticism in order to spur the Legislature to
do better work, but when the articles became
biased and subjective he asked for space in The
Daily to present the other side of the picture.
What Legislature has done was never presented
to the students because his request for space was
flatly refused by the editor of the previous vol
ume of The Daily. We wonder if this is true free
*he nress. An editor of The Daily is not
.-"-eitative of the students in that he is
not elected by the students at large, yet he has
the final decision of printing, or not printing,
facts in a newspaper owned by the students of
Stanford.
The purpose of this legislation is not to shackle
the press or to dictate every printed word. The
purpose is to make The Daily a better newspaper
by making clear to the Stanford student that ft
is his newspaper and that he has the right to
alter any deficiencies in it. We hope that the
rction taken will impress future editors with the
moral responsibility that is theirs when they are
given the privilege of running a newspaper that

is dedicated to true journalistic objective report
ing and true freedom of I lie press.
Legislature is looking for the best way to show
this responsibility of the editor. The present by
law change may not be the best way. If you, the
Stanford student, know of a better method to
improve The Daily, you are invited to attend the
By-laws Committee meeting at 4:15 p.m. on Wed
nesday at Bowman Alumni House.

staff member was not written by a member
of tiie Daily editorial staff; it was written by
a member of the Daily business staff. Mem
bers of the business 1 staff have no voice in de
termining the Daily editorial policy.
It is true that ASSU President Bob Freelen
requested a special weekly column early last
autumn. This request was turned down on the
grounds that, as a matter of policy, no one off
the Daily staff may write editorials, columns
or stories plugging their particular organiza
tion or function, unless these columns are spe
cially requested. A special column ("From An
other Viewpoint") was requested from Freelen
last month and printed.
While refusing a column, we nevertheless
told Freelen that he could write an open letter
to the editor any time lie pleased, and that it
would be printed. We received no letter.
Uncontrolled Press Vila!
Editor, The Daily:
As members of the local chapter of Theta
Sigma Phi, national fraternity for women in
journalism, we want to add our voices in protest
against the proposed ASSU legislation re the
selection of the Daily editor.
â– We feel that a free and uncontrolled press is
a vital part of the system of checks and balances
in any democracy. Stanford is a small commu
nity, and The Daily its newspaper. Even though
the ASSU is the technical publisher of The Daily,
it is no better for the ASSU to control The Daily
than it is for any other government to control
its newspapers. LASSU should not pick the Daily
editor any more than the President of the United
States should choose the editor of the New York
Times or the Washington Post.
This legislation will result in nothing but ill
will between the ASSU and Stanford journalists.
Working on The Daily, for us journalism stu
dents, is strictly a campus service. We are not
obligated to either serve or support The Daily.
The Legislature seems to think rhey are more
capable, anyway.
The Daily is far from a perfect newspaper, but
we feel it has done as well and as honestly as it
can. However, we feel it is a newspaper and we
would hate to see il become an ASSU bulletin as
so many publications on other campuses are.
The cure for The Daily is the same cure the
ASSU needs- more students willing to partici
pate in campus activities.

Editorial I'ajjes Trivial
Editor, The Daily:
Most of the subjects dealt with on the Stanford
Daily editorial page are very trivial. Many more
1 hought-provoking and arousing subjects could
be dealt with although running the risk of public
criticism. As il is now, the editorials arouse nei
ther aclaim nor are they condemned. The read
ers are completely apathetic and why? Because
the subjects are trivial, and they deal wilh triv
ialities It seems as though the editor's hands are
tied behind his back
The paper offers a great opportunity to the
students for exchange of ideas and stimulus of
thought and full advantage should be taken of
this, but it is not being done right now. Could
this situation exist because the editor is clected
by the Daily staff rather than the whole student
body and thereby is not responsible directly to
his readers as he should be? This writer believes
that the student body electing the editor of The
Daily would give him the freedom he needs to
discuss the topics in which the students are in
teiested.
