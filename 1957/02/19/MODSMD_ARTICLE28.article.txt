Editor, The Daily:
Freshman Mike Datisman's letter of Monday,
Feb. 18, contains some inaccurate information.
The letter shows a lack of familiarity with the
subject ol journalism. His facts are incorrect;
the opinions which he forms from these facts
must necessarily l>e,at best inaccurate.
His observation that The Daily "seemed very
inferior to the campus papers i had read in the
Midwest" cannot be factually challenged. This is
his opinion.
However, those who are considered qualified
for such judgment, not through opinion, but by
empirical observation, see it differently. In na
tional competition The Daily has l>eeh awarder!
citations of merit excelled in the Midwest by Vnly
the University of Michigan Daily. The judges of
this competition were professional newsmen, edi
tors and managing editors of leading newspapers.
At that the Michigan Daily can claim no more
than a moral victory over The Daily. The high
est position on that paper to which a university
student can rise is managing editor. A faculty
member fills the editor's chair.
I challenge Datisman to chart the amount of
national news and local news in The Daily's
columns before claiming that "an inordinate
amount ol space was given to national news.
Having studied journalism for seven years, and
been in professional work for nearly as long, I
am at least equally qualified with frosh Datisman
to judge The Daily's "journalism attitude" which
he asserts is "poor." Looking at it from a jour
nalist's view the attitude is good, involving a
deep-seated feeling of responsibility to the reader,
and to principles of journalism so often neglected
by money-hungry commercial papers.
The most glaring error in the Datisman letter
concerns the journalism department. He says it
"should lie censured for discouraging journalism
students to work on The Daily. If qualified peo
pie do not take an active interest in The Daily
can we expect the paper to improve?" 1 speak

as a former Daily editor, a journalism major and
a graduate student in the department.
Datisman subscribes to an old myth. He says j
"journalism departments are notorious for- know- I
in# little practical journalism." Look at the rec
ords before making such a charge. Look at the !
number of publishers all over the nation who
have engaged the department to do studies for
their newspapers. Without exception, the jour i
nalisrn instructors have all had years of profes
sional experience a virtual pie-requisite for em
ployment in the department.
There are too few people who freely express I
their opinions, and writer Datisman has my sup- i
poil for speaking out. That's what makes ihe
world go round.
Rut even the most extreme subjective opinions
must be based on objective facts or they are best
left unsaid. Say all you please, Mr. Datisman, but !
at least glance at the facts first.

We do not think that The Daily should be run

Editor, The Daily:
Freshman Mike Datisman's letter of Monday,
Feb. 18, contains some inaccurate information.
The letter shows a lack of familiarity with the
subject ol journalism. His facts are incorrect;
the opinions which he forms from these facts
must necessarily l>e,at best inaccurate.
His observation that The Daily "seemed very
inferior to the campus papers i had read in the
Midwest" cannot be factually challenged. This is
his opinion.
However, those who are considered qualified
for such judgment, not through opinion, but by
empirical observation, see it differently. In na
tional competition The Daily has l>eeh awarder!
citations of merit excelled in the Midwest by Vnly
the University of Michigan Daily. The judges of
this competition were professional newsmen, edi
tors and managing editors of leading newspapers.
At that the Michigan Daily can claim no more
than a moral victory over The Daily. The high
est position on that paper to which a university
student can rise is managing editor. A faculty
member fills the editor's chair.
I challenge Datisman to chart the amount of
national news and local news in The Daily's
columns before claiming that "an inordinate
amount ol space was given to national news.
Having studied journalism for seven years, and
been in professional work for nearly as long, I
am at least equally qualified with frosh Datisman
to judge The Daily's "journalism attitude" which
he asserts is "poor." Looking at it from a jour
nalist's view the attitude is good, involving a
deep-seated feeling of responsibility to the reader,
and to principles of journalism so often neglected
by money-hungry commercial papers.
The most glaring error in the Datisman letter
concerns the journalism department. He says it
"should lie censured for discouraging journalism
students to work on The Daily. If qualified peo
pie do not take an active interest in The Daily
can we expect the paper to improve?" 1 speak

as a former Daily editor, a journalism major and
a graduate student in the department.
Datisman subscribes to an old myth. He says j
"journalism departments are notorious for- know- I
in# little practical journalism." Look at the rec
ords before making such a charge. Look at the !
number of publishers all over the nation who
have engaged the department to do studies for
their newspapers. Without exception, the jour i
nalisrn instructors have all had years of profes
sional experience a virtual pie-requisite for em
ployment in the department.
There are too few people who freely express I
their opinions, and writer Datisman has my sup- i
poil for speaking out. That's what makes ihe
world go round.
Rut even the most extreme subjective opinions
must be based on objective facts or they are best
left unsaid. Say all you please, Mr. Datisman, but !
