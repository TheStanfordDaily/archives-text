# BIRDS AND BEES LIKE IT, TOO
## Critic Praises SU Symphony As One of Country's Best 
### 
When Virgil Thompson, former
music critic lor the New York
Herald Tribune, heard the Stan
ford Symphony Orchestra pluy
several years ago, he commented
that it was one of the best colle
giate orchestras in the United
States.
The orchestra was reorganized
in 1949 and placed under the ba
ton of its present conductor, Dr.
Sandor Salgo. Only 10 of the 7f>
members are actually music ma
jors. The remaining 87 per cent
is composed of non-music majors,
graduate students, faculty and
faculty wives and friends living
in the area.
Salgo graduated from the Hoy
al Academy of Music in Budapest,
Hungary. Since he came to Stan
ford from Princeton University
eight years ago, he has not con

fined himself to directing Univer
sity music groups. He has been !
guest conductor of I he San Fran-;
cisco Symphony, Mexico City |
Symphony and the BBC and Halle |
orchestras in England. Tfe is reg- 1
ular conductor of the San Jose
and Marin Symphonies.
Most musical organizations fol
low convention and have ihe visi
tors to their rehearsals sit quietly
and listen to the music. Not Hie
orchestra. They even have uncon
ventional guests. First they had
an audience of ducks which were
roosting on the rafters. Another
time a swarm of bees stayed
throughout a rehearsal, and just j
the other day a squirrel paid j
them a long visit. They meet in |
Woodpecker Lodge, which ex j
plains all.
