TWO CAIN LIVE
AS CHEESILY AS ONE
Now in the final months of the school year, one thing
is certain: you#and your roommate are not speaking.
But it is not too late to patch things up. Examine the
rift calmly. Search your soul with patience. Perhaps
the fault is yours. Perhaps you are guilty of violating
some of the basic rules of roommate etiquette.
For instance, in decorating your room, have you
forced your preferences on your roommate without re
gard to his or her tastes? This is a common cause of
friction. Indeed, it once happened to me back in my fresh
man year when I was sharing a room with a boy named
Rimsky Sigafoos who covered every inch of our wall
with 850 pictures of James Dean.
"Rimsky," I said to him in gentle reproof, "please
don't think me unduly, but I hud hoped to put a picture
of my fiancee Mary Beth Thermidor on the wall."
Rimsky examined the picture of my fiancee Mary Beth
Thermidor. "You're kidding, of course," he said and
dropped the picture in the wastebasket.
Well, that got my dander up, and I was mad as a wet
hen till Rimsky gave me a Philip Morris Cigarette.
As we all know, there is nothing like a mild, natural,
Philip Morris. Treats a man right. No filter, no foolin'!
Anger melts and frowns become smiles with Philip
Morris, all seems right in the world, and no man's hand
is turned against you, nor yours against any man.
So, puffing a pacifying Philip Morris, I forgot all
about Rimsky's slight to Mary Beth Thermidor. In fact,
with her picture out of sight, I soon forgot all about
Mary Beth Thermidor, too, and one night at the Fresh
man Frolic, spying a round young coed over in a corner,
I came up to her and said with a fetching leer, "Excuse
me, miss. We don't know each other, but I would like
to rectify that sad omission." And she said, "Oh, you
horrid, horrid youth! I am your fiancee Mary Beth
Thermidor." With that she stomped furiously away, and
though. I tried to win her back with Philip Morrises, she
was beyond recall. I, utterly shattered, signed on as a
cabin boy with the Cunard Line and am today, aged 53,
the oldest cabin boy on the North Atlantic run.
But I digress. We were talking about roommate eti
quette. Let us turn now to the matter of share and share
alike. Have you shared everything equally? Drawer
space? Closet space? Study space? And here's one that
often causes trouble — hobby space.

When, for example, I roomed with Rimsky Sigafoos,
my bobby was stamp collecting. I did not take up much
room. All I needed was a small corner for my stamps,
my album, my magnifying glass, and my tongue. Rimsky,
on the other hand, was by hobby a cat burglar. Hardly
a night went by when he didn't burgle twenty or thirty
cats. You can imagine how crowded our little room used
to get! Many's the time I got so exasperated that it took
two or three rich, natural Philip Morrises to restore my
native sweetness. ©m,.* sh.>im#n. isr>7
