With a wistful note in his voice, University of Oregon cage coach
Steven Belko, pilot of tht* PCC's last-place club, told a recent lunch
eon group what kind of a team he would have if he could pick any
10 conference players.
Here are Belko's choices:
Bill Bond of Stanford, Doug Smart and Bruno Boin of Washing
ton, Larry Friend and Earl Robinson of California, Dave Gam bee of
Oregon State, Larry Beck of Washington State, Dick Banton of
UCLA, Danny Rogers of Southern California and Charlie Franklin
of Oregon.
Franklin and llenry Itoiiqiiillo both hail from tlx* streets of
I os Angeles and arc Known as the "Dead I'-nd Kids'" of the Oregon
Wcbloots.
In a recent interview with an Oregon Daily Emerald sports
writer, Franklin was asked if the 36 points he potted in the WSC
game represented ' any kind of personal record."
Ronquillo, known to his teammates as "Cisco," broke in, "Are
you crazy, man? My boy has been going places."
Ronquillo began recounting Franklin's quite remarkable records,
among which are the following:
• The high school scoring record in Los Angeles—a husky 64
points.
• High game totals of IS, 41 and 39 and 12 freshman scoring rec
ords while at Los Angeles Junior College, where he was named
Junior College All-American.
• Five attractive offers from the Harlem Globetrotters, the first
floating in when Franklin was t i high school sophomore at LA's
Manual Arts 1 ligh.
"Those 64 points. That was quite a game," Ronquillo continued.
"Ohai lie was just a junior playing forward, because Garnett Brown
is playing at center. Brown's playing for Loyola University now.
"This Krovvn, he makes f>X points in one game and sets the city
record lor Manual Arts. Next Jim Kaufman, who was the IJSC
captain before he was suspended this year, goes out and makes 59
tor Los Angeles High.
"A week later Brown graduates in mid season so Charlie moves
to center. His first game at center, he scores those (54 points and
brought i lie record back to Manual Arts."
Franklin, now fifth in PCC scoring, led Manual Arts to the league
championship over Roosevelt High, paced by Ronquillo. Now the
L.A. pair are roommates and Ronquillo carries his more talented
friend's books.
It's nearly spring cleaning time at southerly schools UCLA and
IJSC and time to throw out old coaches and bring in new aces from
local junior colleges.
Gone from the Trojan coaching ranks, though not exactly
thrown out, is hackficld football coach George Ceithaml. Ceithaml
is a multiple-offense man and new hoy-wonder head football coach
Don Clark is a T-formal ion hacker. Result: one less hackfiehl
coach.
As Daily Trojan columnist Garry Short reported, "He knew lie
was going to be replaced. Consequently, his retirement."
Anothei SC sports scribe, Joe Jares, said recently, "Track coach
Jess Mortensen was loading high jumper Charley Dumas through
registration last Friday."
How touching. . . . Dumas, the Olympic Games and world record
holder in the high jump, transferred between semesters from Comp
ton Junior College to ol' SC. Evidently the Trojans are going all out
to regain the conference track championship they lost last spring for
the first time in 2X years.
As for football, no less-Hian three All-American .If! players have
already transferred fo the Figueroa Street institution. Meanwhile,
•lares "reveals" I!)*>»» IJSC All American Jon Arnett is driving a
lfl"»7 Oldsniobilc.
At the University of North Carolina, basketball stars are flunking
out fastoi than coach Frank McGuire can import them from New
York City to Chapel Hill.
Since practice began Oct. lfj, no less than three top Tar Heel
hoopsters center* Lii 11 Hathaway and gifards Stan Groll and Harvey
Sal/, have flunked out.
Two others Rob Young and Frank Goodwin—were suspended
for disciplinary reasons. Yet Carolina keeps right on winning.
At Areata, California, llumbohlt State College students cele
brated (.round Hog l>uy eve by playing the third annual faculty
student basketball game—"a yearly guarantee of many a laugh for
students and many an aching back for profs."
Tabbed as the "Faculty Fakers," the pedagogical crew included
such standouts as Fancy Fred Telonicher, who, said the Humboldt
Lumberjack, "out rustled Bill Russell on the backboards last year
with the aid of a ladder and his trusty butterfly net."
News ol the re.sult of this contest has not yet arrived from Areata.
