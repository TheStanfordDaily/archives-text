# 'Basketball Player One Inch Tall?
## 
### 
SEATTLE. Feb. 18 (UP)â€”A
"basketball player" just one inch
tall may be the most valuable man
in next month's National Invita
tion Tournament in New York.
He can't shoot. lie's worthless
off the backboards, lie can't run,
drib b 1 e. fake, check, pass or
screen. And he won't score a sin
gle point.
But "Bobby, the basketball play
er," could be the guy who will
take his team all the way in the
annual Madison Square Garden
cage carnival.
"Bobby" is a tic clasp fashioned
in the image of a basketball play
er which John (Count i Castellani,
coach of the Seattle University
Chieftains, uses to anchor his col
orful ties.
"Bobby" only works a short
shift because, after each game,
Castellani gathers his team in the
dressing room, takes a look
around and begins unfastening his
tie.
Then he hands, it to the player
who, in his opinion, has "played
up to his full potential."
