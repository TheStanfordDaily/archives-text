# 'NEAR PROFESSIONAL'
## SU Symphony Orchestra Plays To Capacity Series Audience 
### Camilla Peterson 
The Stanford University Orchestra presented a near professional
performance to a capacity crowd in Memorial Auditorium last night.
The three works presented gave each section of the Symphony
ample opportunity to show its ability. The entire string portion of
the group proved to be exceedingly outstanding, the most obvious

being the violins. Only once dur
ing the entire concert did the first
and second vioiins seem to dis
agree on tempo. Within three
beats they were together again
and remained so the rest of the
evening.
Nol once during Ihe concert did
the Symphony appear to leave the
control of their distinguished con
duel or, Sandor Salgo.
The woodwinds surpassed them
selves throughout the evening. In
"Symphony No. 3" and "Sympho
nic Fantastique" the seldom
heard tones of the oboe sang
through. In the latter selection
the even less common English
horn, which has the same reedy
pastoral quality of the oboe only
a fifth lower in pitch and richer
and more somber, had a promi
nent solo. The deep-throated bas
soon was also heard. The mag
nificent performance of these mu
sicians can be appreciated even
more when the unpredictability of
the double reed is considered.
Mellow Tones
The mellow tones of the flutes
sifted through easily which
showed the delicate balance main
tained.
Soloists of the evening—Gloria
Vial and Peter Werdern, violins;
Harold Hill, cello, and Hazelle
Thomas, harpsichord—were out
standing.
The concert opened with the
18th century work "Concertino
No. 3" in A major by the Italian
composer Giovanni Pergolesi. The
work is the third of Pergolesi's
six concertini for- strings. The
more tranquil piece opened the
concert gradually and readied the
audience for the more dramatic
works to follow.
Symphony No. 3
"Symphony No. 3" by Roy Har
ris, contemporary American com
poser, was second on the pro
gram. The work in five continu
ous sections provided the oppor
tunity for the bass section of the
75 - piece orchestra to show its
ability for the first time. As the
bells of the instruments shifted
position the multicolored lights
from above were reflected and
added a certain charm to the mu
sic. The dramatic ending, cen
tered around the roll of Ihe tym
pani, proved a dramatic end to
the first half of the concert.
The audience, composed mostly
of non-students, was enthralled
with the magnificent perform
ance of Berlioz' "Symphonic Fan
tastique." Every section of the
Symphony "had its day." All
seemed lost in the beauty of the
work. The Symphony's portrayal
rivaled that of any professional
body The closing strains re
sounded throughout the hall, pro
viding an appropriate finis to the
concert.
