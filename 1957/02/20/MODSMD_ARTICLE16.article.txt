He went at once to the White
House to confer with Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles and
UN Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge, Jr., and to take personal
charge of the deadlocked nego

ed on the current crisis.
Letter to Dulles
Johnson made public a Feb. 11
letter to Dulles urging the Secre
tary to instruct the U.S. delega
tion to the UN to "oppose with all
its skill" any sanctions against
Israel. The policy committee ap
proved the letter, he said.
Dulles earlier told a news con

Thus far Eisenhower and Dul

plan for withdrawing her troops
from Egyptian territory.
To Send Ship
Dulles told reporters earlier
that the United States would send
a ship into the Gulf of Aqaba—
which Egypt has blocked Israel
from using—in an effort to give
the disputed area an international
character.
He said he did not anticipate
that the U.S. ship would have any
trouble getting through Egvp
tian-controlled Straits of Tiran, at
the mouth of the gulf. But h n
said he had no assurances that
an Israeli ship would be allowed
to pass and that the United States
could not guarantee passage to
other nations.
Meanwhile, Israel stood firm
against economic and diplomatic
pressure on its insistence for
broader security guarantees be
fore withdrawing its troops from
Egyptian soil.
Cancels Pact
Prussia has cancelled an $18
million oil-for-oranges trade pact
with Israel, on grounds of Israeli
"aggression" against Egypt.
High Israeli officials confirmed
that the "new proposals" which
Premier David Ben-Gurion hand
ed to U.S. Ambassador Edward
Lawson Monday night merely re
stated Israel's own suggestions
for breaking the Israeli-American
deadlock over guarantees.
