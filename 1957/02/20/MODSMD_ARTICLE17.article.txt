### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 19 (UP) â€”
Secretary of State .Tohn Foster
Dulles said today it would be
"premature" for the United States
to begin thinking about recogniz
ing Communist China.
Dulles said America must not
"forget too fast" that Red China
fought the United Nations and
the United States in Korea and
was largely responsible for near
ly 150,000 American casualties.
He made the statement at a
news conference when asked to
comment on a remark by Chair
man Theodore F. Green (D-R.1.)
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. Green said in a radio
broadeast yesterday that this
country should extend diplomatic
recognition to Red China "sooner
or later."
However, Green later explained
that he did not mean the United
States should recognize the Com
munist country "forthwith."
In addition, Green said he op
posed the State Department's ban
on entry of American newspaper
men into China.
When a reporter suggested that
Green had said this country might
recognize Red China "eventually,"
Dulles replied, "I suppose that
none of us are talking here in
terms of eternity."
