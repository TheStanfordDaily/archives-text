# Co-operation Without Legislation
## 
### 
The amendment that will make the Daily
editor appointive by the student body presi
dent comes up before Legislature tonight. Vi e
hope it will be voted on and defeated.
< hit of the amendment has come a new basis
of cooperation among The Daily, Legislature
and the campus. Legislature has realized that
I iu* Daily has its problems, that the editor's
ollice is always open to those who have com
plaints or suggestions. Il has realized thai,
with its short staff, The Daily is trying hard
lo eliminate mistakes.
Ihe Daily, aware of its responsibility and
obligation, has been reminded of the problems
of other campus organizations. V. c only wish
I his reminding could have been done through
mutual discussion rather than through an
amendment which was hastily drawn up.
To repeat, the ball has started lo roll toward
the desired cooperation. Members of Legisla
ture and leading campus organizations have
been in The Daily, discussing The Daily's and
other student organizations' problems. No
promises have been made, but understandings
have been reached. This has been cooperation
without legislation.
We believe that passage of ihe proposed
Publications Board Standing Rules amendment
or delaying il for a more watered-down version
would he wrong. A free preys that is coopera

live and responsible is perfectly possible with
out any amendment or pending amendment.
We sincerelv believe that a stall' is the most
qualified to piek its own editor after having
worked with ihe candidates from one to three
years. r J he president, regardless of how con
scientious he is, can't possibly know the quali
fications of the candidates as well as the stall'.
Some have said thai this won I mean control;
we say il will. Most student body presidents
are responsible; every mice in a while one is
uol. II such a president were to piek a poor
editor, then the staff who had uo voice in the
process would rightfully feel uo responsibility
toward the editor. II the stall picked a poor
editor, at least they would have a feeling of
responsibility toward the situation.
Aside from leading to control within itself,
we feel il could lead to more serious conse
quences. Il might lead to further restrictive
legislation concerning The Daily or other
campus organizations, for that matter.
Admittedly, as a monopoly publication of
the A SSI I we have a responsibility lo the com
munity we serve. But we believe a staff-picked
editor, in his present unique, untouched posi
tion, will live up to this responsibility.
Forced cooperation and responsibility have
never worked and we don't think they ever
will.
