Editor, The Daily:
At the risk of browbeating an issue on which
there has already been so much printed commen
tary that public interest may already be on the
wane, I would like to comment on a few of the
fundamental issues involved in the present LAS
SU-Daily squabble over the proposed procedural
change in the naming of the editor of The Daily.
I would first like to say that I think Mr. Freelen's
position justifying his proposal is essentially
sound. The ASSU does own, support and publish
The Daily. Of this there can be no doubt. The
LASSU is the body the students elect, no matter
how many of them actually exercise their right
to vote, to administer the business of the ASSU.
Of this there can also be no doubt. When The
Daily raises the issue of "freedom of the press"
in this context, they speak about freedom from
control by their owner and publisher. To expect
that kind of freedom is to be pathetically unreal
istic. I doubt if there is any newspaper in the
United States which is not controlled by and re
sponsible to its publisher. If the Daily staff
wants complete independence, let them publish
and finance their paper themselves. If they will
not or cannot do this, I suggest they accept in
principle the fact of their dependence upon the
ASSU.
Whether Freelen's specific proposal was justi
fied is of course another question. It is certainly
clear that in the past the ASSU has seen fit to
grant The Daily a vast degree of independence,
and hence, responsibility. As I have previously
stated, this has been independence to a degree far
vaster than that enjoyed by any commercial
newspaper, which does not enjoy such privileges
as a captive audience and a quarterly levy per
student. It is Freelen's opinion that The Daily
has, to some degree, abused this independence,
so that it is advisable to increase its sense of re
sponsibility to the ASSU in some way. I am not.
closely enough in touch with the situation which
led Freelen to this conclusion to be able to per
fectly evaluate it, but I do know that since I have
been at Stanford, I have seen The Daily do a good
many rather unwise things. It can certainly
never be said that it is afraid to put its foot in
its mouth, and if necessary, keep it there. I
have heard a good many justifiable complaints
us to its policies. I have known people and or
ganizations whom it has annoyed. 1 think it is
entirely possible, then, that Freelen is justified
in believing that some restrictive action is neces
sary.
In feeling thai some restrictive action is neces
sary, however, I think Freelen perhaps is guilty
of overestimating The Daily. By attempting to
bring it to bay, he perhaps joins the small mi
nority on campus which actually takes The Daily
at its word as to its own importance. Sometimes
when a man has a small dog yapping at his heels
ho is better off to ignore it rather than to give
il his attention by trying to reason with it, or
worse, by kicking it. The Daily has the right to
consider itself as important as it wants. It has
the right to fight for whatever degree of inde
pendence it desires.
The essence of democracy is that each interest
has the right to express its desires and attempt
to achieve them. However, because of these as
sertions of power and importance on the part, of
The Daily, coupled witii its occasional irrespon
sibility and inconsistency, its more-than-occasion
al one-sidedness and pettiness, and its obvious
fallibility, The Daily seems to have forfeited the
respect of the majority of the student body. In
coming freshmen are credulous, but by the time
a person has been here a year, lie has generally
learned to take The Daily with a rather sizable
grain of salt, and by his senior year he may have
gotten into the habit of reading it only for en
gagements, ads, intrcfmural basketball schedules
and for a chance to laugh at impassioned writers
of letters to the editors such as myself.
I think the attitude of The Daily could have
been directly responsible for this attitude, just as
the attitude of so-called "red hots" in student
government could have been responsible for dis
respect, apathy and George Ralph. In conclusion
I suggest that The Daily might find it wise to
adopt a little more humble and realistic attitude
toward its position on campus, that Mr. Freelen
might find it wise to take a little more time on
his proposal to curb The Daily, and perhaps come
up with a solution which will be a little more
practical and a little less inflammatory than ap

pointing the editor, if such a solution exists, and
that the readers of The Daily and of this article
continue not to worry too much about what
transpires upon these pages, but perhaps from
time to time give gentle and constructive criti
cism and opinion to the parties involved, such as
I sincerely hope that I have done. Such is the
privilege, and possibly the duty, of the con
stituent.

Many Honest Views
Editor, The Daily:
For the past week many Stanford students
have expressed their opinions (some pretty ve
hemently) on the proposed amendment to the
Publications Board Standing Rules concerning
the selection of the editor of The Stanford Daily.
With great interest I have read the sampling of
these opinions printed in the"Letters to the Edi
tor" column.
A great many honest views on both sides of
the question have been presented to the Stanford
student body along with some opinions which
have been very emotional and prejudiced. This
is to be expected when people feel so strongly
about an issue. Even articles like Mr. Denny's
"Ode to the Legislature" are, I think, placed in
their proper perspective by a student body which
is basically pretty fair minded. If I did* not be
lieve this, I certainly would not have run for the
Legislature. I do feel, however, that there have
been certain points of view very pertinent to this
subject which have not been presented as yet to
the Stanford student body. Some of these are
my own; some of them have been brought to me
by interested students.
First of all, the amendment will not enable the
Legislature to "control" The Stanford Daily any
more than the Legislature "controls" The Daily
now. Under the present by-laws I don't think
anyone has accused the Legislature of that.
Under the amendment the ASSU president would
appoint the editor from those nominated by The
Daily's own editorial board, but he can appoint
his choice only with the approval of Legislature.
The Legislature has the final say. As for the
removal of the Daily editor- from office, that can
be done with the approval of Legislature now
under the present by-laws. The Legislature has
"original power" over all ASSU organizations.
This power has to be somewhere, and the Cramers
of our ASSU constitution thought that the best
place would be Legislature. No one has thus far
accused the Legislature of misusing this great
power and betraying the confidence of its found
ers or the students whom it serves. There is rnV
reason to believe that the Legislature will misuse
this power in the future.
T know I would not sit idly by and let the ASSU
president appoint an editor who was not the first
choice of The Daily unless there were irrefutable
reasons for disqualifying him. I know the other
present members of the Legislature would not
be a rubber stamp either. Even if a legislator
were elected who did not have a strong sense of
student responsibility, he would certainly have
enough pride to prevent his being used as a tool
of the ASSU president. The present ASSU presi
dent would never try to force his will on the
Legislature; this 1 know from personal expe
rience.
Once the editor was appointed, he would be
just as free as he is now. The Legislature has not
removed Daily editors in Ihe past. I don't think
lhat anyone should think that suddenly it will
start now—it has the power to do so all the time.
Lastly, it is a part of the Legislature's job to
keep campus organizations on their toes and pro
mote interest in student affairs. It is the Legis
lature's right to criticize just as much as it is the
l ight of The Daily or any other interested party.
Whether this amendment is defeated or passed,
I think it has done a lot of good for the Stanford
student body.
It has certainly stimulated campus interest. It
has further put both The Daily and Legislature
on their toes. And finally, believe it or not, it
has led to more co-operation between The Daily
and the Legislature than has existed in many
years. This last thing in itself may be viewed
by old-timers as a minor miracle. Many of us
have talked to Dave Scott and others on the Daily
staff, who have been most helpful in explaining
their position. I think we might have reached a
solid basis for co-operation. I certainly hope so.

my own; some of them have been brought to me
by interested students.
First of all, the amendment will not enable the
Legislature to "control" The Stanford Daily any
more than the Legislature "controls" The Daily
now. Under the present by-laws I don't think
anyone has accused the Legislature of that.
Under the amendment the ASSU president would
appoint the editor from those nominated by The
Daily's own editorial board, but he can appoint
his choice only with the approval of Legislature.
The Legislature has the final say. As for the
removal of the Daily editor- from office, that can
be done with the approval of Legislature now
under the present by-laws. The Legislature has
"original power" over all ASSU organizations.
This power has to be somewhere, and the Cramers
of our ASSU constitution thought that the best
place would be Legislature. No one has thus far
accused the Legislature of misusing this great
power and betraying the confidence of its found
ers or the students whom it serves. There is rnV
reason to believe that the Legislature will misuse
this power in the future.
T know I would not sit idly by and let the ASSU
president appoint an editor who was not the first
choice of The Daily unless there were irrefutable
reasons for disqualifying him. I know the other
present members of the Legislature would not
be a rubber stamp either. Even if a legislator
were elected who did not have a strong sense of
student responsibility, he would certainly have
enough pride to prevent his being used as a tool
of the ASSU president. The present ASSU presi
dent would never try to force his will on the
Legislature; this 1 know from personal expe
rience.
Once the editor was appointed, he would be
just as free as he is now. The Legislature has not
removed Daily editors in Ihe past. I don't think
lhat anyone should think that suddenly it will
start now—it has the power to do so all the time.
Lastly, it is a part of the Legislature's job to
keep campus organizations on their toes and pro
mote interest in student affairs. It is the Legis
lature's right to criticize just as much as it is the
l ight of The Daily or any other interested party.
Whether this amendment is defeated or passed,
I think it has done a lot of good for the Stanford
student body.
It has certainly stimulated campus interest. It
has further put both The Daily and Legislature
on their toes. And finally, believe it or not, it
has led to more co-operation between The Daily
and the Legislature than has existed in many
years. This last thing in itself may be viewed
by old-timers as a minor miracle. Many of us
have talked to Dave Scott and others on the Daily
staff, who have been most helpful in explaining
their position. I think we might have reached a
solid basis for co-operation. I certainly hope so.

Editor, The Daily:
At the risk of browbeating an issue on which
there has already been so much printed commen
tary that public interest may already be on the
wane, I would like to comment on a few of the
fundamental issues involved in the present LAS
SU-Daily squabble over the proposed procedural
change in the naming of the editor of The Daily.
I would first like to say that I think Mr. Freelen's
position justifying his proposal is essentially
sound. The ASSU does own, support and publish
The Daily. Of this there can be no doubt. The
LASSU is the body the students elect, no matter
how many of them actually exercise their right
to vote, to administer the business of the ASSU.
Of this there can also be no doubt. When The
Daily raises the issue of "freedom of the press"
in this context, they speak about freedom from
control by their owner and publisher. To expect
that kind of freedom is to be pathetically unreal
istic. I doubt if there is any newspaper in the
United States which is not controlled by and re
sponsible to its publisher. If the Daily staff
wants complete independence, let them publish
and finance their paper themselves. If they will
not or cannot do this, I suggest they accept in
principle the fact of their dependence upon the
ASSU.
Whether Freelen's specific proposal was justi
fied is of course another question. It is certainly
clear that in the past the ASSU has seen fit to
grant The Daily a vast degree of independence,
and hence, responsibility. As I have previously
stated, this has been independence to a degree far
vaster than that enjoyed by any commercial
newspaper, which does not enjoy such privileges
as a captive audience and a quarterly levy per
student. It is Freelen's opinion that The Daily
has, to some degree, abused this independence,
so that it is advisable to increase its sense of re
sponsibility to the ASSU in some way. I am not.
closely enough in touch with the situation which
led Freelen to this conclusion to be able to per
fectly evaluate it, but I do know that since I have
been at Stanford, I have seen The Daily do a good
many rather unwise things. It can certainly
never be said that it is afraid to put its foot in
its mouth, and if necessary, keep it there. I
have heard a good many justifiable complaints
us to its policies. I have known people and or
ganizations whom it has annoyed. 1 think it is
entirely possible, then, that Freelen is justified
in believing that some restrictive action is neces
sary.
In feeling thai some restrictive action is neces
sary, however, I think Freelen perhaps is guilty
of overestimating The Daily. By attempting to
bring it to bay, he perhaps joins the small mi
nority on campus which actually takes The Daily
at its word as to its own importance. Sometimes
when a man has a small dog yapping at his heels
ho is better off to ignore it rather than to give
il his attention by trying to reason with it, or
worse, by kicking it. The Daily has the right to
consider itself as important as it wants. It has
the right to fight for whatever degree of inde
pendence it desires.
The essence of democracy is that each interest
has the right to express its desires and attempt
to achieve them. However, because of these as
sertions of power and importance on the part, of
The Daily, coupled witii its occasional irrespon
sibility and inconsistency, its more-than-occasion
al one-sidedness and pettiness, and its obvious
fallibility, The Daily seems to have forfeited the
respect of the majority of the student body. In
coming freshmen are credulous, but by the time
a person has been here a year, lie has generally
learned to take The Daily with a rather sizable
grain of salt, and by his senior year he may have
gotten into the habit of reading it only for en
gagements, ads, intrcfmural basketball schedules
and for a chance to laugh at impassioned writers
of letters to the editors such as myself.
I think the attitude of The Daily could have
been directly responsible for this attitude, just as
the attitude of so-called "red hots" in student
government could have been responsible for dis
respect, apathy and George Ralph. In conclusion
I suggest that The Daily might find it wise to
adopt a little more humble and realistic attitude
toward its position on campus, that Mr. Freelen
might find it wise to take a little more time on
his proposal to curb The Daily, and perhaps come
up with a solution which will be a little more
practical and a little less inflammatory than ap

pointing the editor, if such a solution exists, and
that the readers of The Daily and of this article
continue not to worry too much about what
transpires upon these pages, but perhaps from
time to time give gentle and constructive criti
cism and opinion to the parties involved, such as
I sincerely hope that I have done. Such is the
privilege, and possibly the duty, of the con
stituent.

Editor, The Daily:
For the past week many Stanford students
have expressed their opinions (some pretty ve
hemently) on the proposed amendment to the
Publications Board Standing Rules concerning
the selection of the editor of The Stanford Daily.
With great interest I have read the sampling of
these opinions printed in the"Letters to the Edi
tor" column.
A great many honest views on both sides of
the question have been presented to the Stanford
student body along with some opinions which
have been very emotional and prejudiced. This
is to be expected when people feel so strongly
about an issue. Even articles like Mr. Denny's
"Ode to the Legislature" are, I think, placed in
their proper perspective by a student body which
is basically pretty fair minded. If I did* not be
lieve this, I certainly would not have run for the
Legislature. I do feel, however, that there have
been certain points of view very pertinent to this

The essence of democracy is that each interest
has the right to express its desires and attempt
to achieve them. However, because of these as
sertions of power and importance on the part, of
The Daily, coupled witii its occasional irrespon
sibility and inconsistency, its more-than-occasion
al one-sidedness and pettiness, and its obvious
fallibility, The Daily seems to have forfeited the
respect of the majority of the student body. In
coming freshmen are credulous, but by the time
a person has been here a year, lie has generally

I think the attitude of The Daily could have
been directly responsible for this attitude, just as
the attitude of so-called "red hots" in student
government could have been responsible for dis
respect, apathy and George Ralph. In conclusion
I suggest that The Daily might find it wise to
adopt a little more humble and realistic attitude
toward its position on campus, that Mr. Freelen
might find it wise to take a little more time on
his proposal to curb The Daily, and perhaps come
up with a solution which will be a little more

Many Honest Views
Editor, The Daily:
For the past week many Stanford students
have expressed their opinions (some pretty ve
hemently) on the proposed amendment to the
Publications Board Standing Rules concerning
the selection of the editor of The Stanford Daily.
With great interest I have read the sampling of
these opinions printed in the"Letters to the Edi
tor" column.
A great many honest views on both sides of
the question have been presented to the Stanford
student body along with some opinions which
have been very emotional and prejudiced. This
is to be expected when people feel so strongly
about an issue. Even articles like Mr. Denny's
"Ode to the Legislature" are, I think, placed in
their proper perspective by a student body which
is basically pretty fair minded. If I did* not be
lieve this, I certainly would not have run for the
Legislature. I do feel, however, that there have
been certain points of view very pertinent to this
subject which have not been presented as yet to
the Stanford student body. Some of these are
my own; some of them have been brought to me
by interested students.
First of all, the amendment will not enable the
Legislature to "control" The Stanford Daily any
more than the Legislature "controls" The Daily
now. Under the present by-laws I don't think
anyone has accused the Legislature of that.
Under the amendment the ASSU president would
appoint the editor from those nominated by The
Daily's own editorial board, but he can appoint
his choice only with the approval of Legislature.
The Legislature has the final say. As for the
removal of the Daily editor- from office, that can
be done with the approval of Legislature now
under the present by-laws. The Legislature has
"original power" over all ASSU organizations.
This power has to be somewhere, and the Cramers
of our ASSU constitution thought that the best
place would be Legislature. No one has thus far
accused the Legislature of misusing this great
power and betraying the confidence of its found
ers or the students whom it serves. There is rnV
reason to believe that the Legislature will misuse
this power in the future.
T know I would not sit idly by and let the ASSU
president appoint an editor who was not the first
choice of The Daily unless there were irrefutable
reasons for disqualifying him. I know the other
present members of the Legislature would not
be a rubber stamp either. Even if a legislator
were elected who did not have a strong sense of
student responsibility, he would certainly have
enough pride to prevent his being used as a tool
of the ASSU president. The present ASSU presi
dent would never try to force his will on the
Legislature; this 1 know from personal expe
rience.
Once the editor was appointed, he would be
just as free as he is now. The Legislature has not
removed Daily editors in Ihe past. I don't think
lhat anyone should think that suddenly it will
start now—it has the power to do so all the time.
Lastly, it is a part of the Legislature's job to
keep campus organizations on their toes and pro
mote interest in student affairs. It is the Legis
lature's right to criticize just as much as it is the
l ight of The Daily or any other interested party.
Whether this amendment is defeated or passed,
I think it has done a lot of good for the Stanford
student body.
It has certainly stimulated campus interest. It
has further put both The Daily and Legislature
on their toes. And finally, believe it or not, it
has led to more co-operation between The Daily
and the Legislature than has existed in many
years. This last thing in itself may be viewed
by old-timers as a minor miracle. Many of us
have talked to Dave Scott and others on the Daily
staff, who have been most helpful in explaining
their position. I think we might have reached a
solid basis for co-operation. I certainly hope so.

Editor, The Daily:
At the risk of browbeating an issue on which
there has already been so much printed commen
tary that public interest may already be on the
wane, I would like to comment on a few of the
fundamental issues involved in the present LAS
SU-Daily squabble over the proposed procedural
change in the naming of the editor of The Daily.
I would first like to say that I think Mr. Freelen's
position justifying his proposal is essentially
sound. The ASSU does own, support and publish
The Daily. Of this there can be no doubt. The
LASSU is the body the students elect, no matter
how many of them actually exercise their right
to vote, to administer the business of the ASSU.
Of this there can also be no doubt. When The
Daily raises the issue of "freedom of the press"
in this context, they speak about freedom from
control by their owner and publisher. To expect
that kind of freedom is to be pathetically unreal
istic. I doubt if there is any newspaper in the
United States which is not controlled by and re
sponsible to its publisher. If the Daily staff
wants complete independence, let them publish
and finance their paper themselves. If they will
not or cannot do this, I suggest they accept in
principle the fact of their dependence upon the
ASSU.
Whether Freelen's specific proposal was justi
fied is of course another question. It is certainly
clear that in the past the ASSU has seen fit to
grant The Daily a vast degree of independence,
and hence, responsibility. As I have previously
stated, this has been independence to a degree far
vaster than that enjoyed by any commercial
newspaper, which does not enjoy such privileges
as a captive audience and a quarterly levy per
student. It is Freelen's opinion that The Daily
has, to some degree, abused this independence,
so that it is advisable to increase its sense of re
sponsibility to the ASSU in some way. I am not.
closely enough in touch with the situation which
led Freelen to this conclusion to be able to per
fectly evaluate it, but I do know that since I have
been at Stanford, I have seen The Daily do a good
many rather unwise things. It can certainly
never be said that it is afraid to put its foot in
its mouth, and if necessary, keep it there. I
have heard a good many justifiable complaints
us to its policies. I have known people and or
ganizations whom it has annoyed. 1 think it is
entirely possible, then, that Freelen is justified
in believing that some restrictive action is neces
sary.
In feeling thai some restrictive action is neces
sary, however, I think Freelen perhaps is guilty
of overestimating The Daily. By attempting to
bring it to bay, he perhaps joins the small mi
nority on campus which actually takes The Daily
at its word as to its own importance. Sometimes
when a man has a small dog yapping at his heels
ho is better off to ignore it rather than to give
il his attention by trying to reason with it, or
worse, by kicking it. The Daily has the right to
consider itself as important as it wants. It has
the right to fight for whatever degree of inde
pendence it desires.
The essence of democracy is that each interest
has the right to express its desires and attempt
to achieve them. However, because of these as
sertions of power and importance on the part, of
The Daily, coupled witii its occasional irrespon
sibility and inconsistency, its more-than-occasion
al one-sidedness and pettiness, and its obvious
fallibility, The Daily seems to have forfeited the
respect of the majority of the student body. In
coming freshmen are credulous, but by the time
a person has been here a year, lie has generally
learned to take The Daily with a rather sizable
grain of salt, and by his senior year he may have
gotten into the habit of reading it only for en
gagements, ads, intrcfmural basketball schedules
and for a chance to laugh at impassioned writers

wane, I would like to comment on a few of the
fundamental issues involved in the present LAS
SU-Daily squabble over the proposed procedural
change in the naming of the editor of The Daily.
I would first like to say that I think Mr. Freelen's
position justifying his proposal is essentially
sound. The ASSU does own, support and publish
The Daily. Of this there can be no doubt. The
LASSU is the body the students elect, no matter
how many of them actually exercise their right
to vote, to administer the business of the ASSU.
Of this there can also be no doubt. When The
Daily raises the issue of "freedom of the press"
in this context, they speak about freedom from
control by their owner and publisher. To expect
that kind of freedom is to be pathetically unreal
istic. I doubt if there is any newspaper in the
United States which is not controlled by and re
sponsible to its publisher. If the Daily staff
wants complete independence, let them publish
and finance their paper themselves. If they will
not or cannot do this, I suggest they accept in
principle the fact of their dependence upon the
ASSU.
Whether Freelen's specific proposal was justi
fied is of course another question. It is certainly
clear that in the past the ASSU has seen fit to
grant The Daily a vast degree of independence,
and hence, responsibility. As I have previously
stated, this has been independence to a degree far
vaster than that enjoyed by any commercial
newspaper, which does not enjoy such privileges
as a captive audience and a quarterly levy per
student. It is Freelen's opinion that The Daily
has, to some degree, abused this independence,
so that it is advisable to increase its sense of re
sponsibility to the ASSU in some way. I am not.
closely enough in touch with the situation which
led Freelen to this conclusion to be able to per
fectly evaluate it, but I do know that since I have
been at Stanford, I have seen The Daily do a good
many rather unwise things. It can certainly
never be said that it is afraid to put its foot in
its mouth, and if necessary, keep it there. I
have heard a good many justifiable complaints
us to its policies. I have known people and or
ganizations whom it has annoyed. 1 think it is
entirely possible, then, that Freelen is justified
in believing that some restrictive action is neces
sary.
In feeling thai some restrictive action is neces
sary, however, I think Freelen perhaps is guilty
of overestimating The Daily. By attempting to
bring it to bay, he perhaps joins the small mi
nority on campus which actually takes The Daily
at its word as to its own importance. Sometimes
when a man has a small dog yapping at his heels
ho is better off to ignore it rather than to give
il his attention by trying to reason with it, or
worse, by kicking it. The Daily has the right to
consider itself as important as it wants. It has
the right to fight for whatever degree of inde
pendence it desires.
The essence of democracy is that each interest
has the right to express its desires and attempt
to achieve them. However, because of these as
sertions of power and importance on the part, of
The Daily, coupled witii its occasional irrespon
sibility and inconsistency, its more-than-occasion
al one-sidedness and pettiness, and its obvious
fallibility, The Daily seems to have forfeited the
respect of the majority of the student body. In
coming freshmen are credulous, but by the time
a person has been here a year, lie has generally
learned to take The Daily with a rather sizable
grain of salt, and by his senior year he may have
gotten into the habit of reading it only for en
gagements, ads, intrcfmural basketball schedules
and for a chance to laugh at impassioned writers
of letters to the editors such as myself.
I think the attitude of The Daily could have
been directly responsible for this attitude, just as
the attitude of so-called "red hots" in student
government could have been responsible for dis
respect, apathy and George Ralph. In conclusion
I suggest that The Daily might find it wise to
adopt a little more humble and realistic attitude
toward its position on campus, that Mr. Freelen
might find it wise to take a little more time on
his proposal to curb The Daily, and perhaps come
up with a solution which will be a little more
practical and a little less inflammatory than ap

pointing the editor, if such a solution exists, and
that the readers of The Daily and of this article
continue not to worry too much about what
transpires upon these pages, but perhaps from
time to time give gentle and constructive criti
cism and opinion to the parties involved, such as
I sincerely hope that I have done. Such is the
privilege, and possibly the duty, of the con

Many Honest Views
Editor, The Daily:
For the past week many Stanford students
have expressed their opinions (some pretty ve
hemently) on the proposed amendment to the
Publications Board Standing Rules concerning
the selection of the editor of The Stanford Daily.
With great interest I have read the sampling of
these opinions printed in the"Letters to the Edi
tor" column.
A great many honest views on both sides of
the question have been presented to the Stanford
student body along with some opinions which
have been very emotional and prejudiced. This
is to be expected when people feel so strongly
about an issue. Even articles like Mr. Denny's
"Ode to the Legislature" are, I think, placed in
their proper perspective by a student body which
is basically pretty fair minded. If I did* not be
lieve this, I certainly would not have run for the
Legislature. I do feel, however, that there have
been certain points of view very pertinent to this
subject which have not been presented as yet to
the Stanford student body. Some of these are
my own; some of them have been brought to me
by interested students.
First of all, the amendment will not enable the
Legislature to "control" The Stanford Daily any
more than the Legislature "controls" The Daily
now. Under the present by-laws I don't think
anyone has accused the Legislature of that.
Under the amendment the ASSU president would
appoint the editor from those nominated by The
Daily's own editorial board, but he can appoint
his choice only with the approval of Legislature.
The Legislature has the final say. As for the
removal of the Daily editor- from office, that can
be done with the approval of Legislature now
under the present by-laws. The Legislature has
"original power" over all ASSU organizations.
This power has to be somewhere, and the Cramers
of our ASSU constitution thought that the best
place would be Legislature. No one has thus far
accused the Legislature of misusing this great
power and betraying the confidence of its found
ers or the students whom it serves. There is rnV
reason to believe that the Legislature will misuse
this power in the future.
T know I would not sit idly by and let the ASSU
president appoint an editor who was not the first
choice of The Daily unless there were irrefutable
reasons for disqualifying him. I know the other
present members of the Legislature would not
be a rubber stamp either. Even if a legislator
were elected who did not have a strong sense of
student responsibility, he would certainly have
enough pride to prevent his being used as a tool
of the ASSU president. The present ASSU presi
dent would never try to force his will on the
Legislature; this 1 know from personal expe
rience.
Once the editor was appointed, he would be
just as free as he is now. The Legislature has not
removed Daily editors in Ihe past. I don't think
lhat anyone should think that suddenly it will
start now—it has the power to do so all the time.
Lastly, it is a part of the Legislature's job to
keep campus organizations on their toes and pro
mote interest in student affairs. It is the Legis
lature's right to criticize just as much as it is the
l ight of The Daily or any other interested party.
Whether this amendment is defeated or passed,
I think it has done a lot of good for the Stanford
student body.
It has certainly stimulated campus interest. It
has further put both The Daily and Legislature
on their toes. And finally, believe it or not, it
has led to more co-operation between The Daily
and the Legislature than has existed in many
years. This last thing in itself may be viewed
by old-timers as a minor miracle. Many of us
have talked to Dave Scott and others on the Daily
staff, who have been most helpful in explaining
their position. I think we might have reached a
solid basis for co-operation. I certainly hope so.

more than the Legislature "controls" The Daily
now. Under the present by-laws I don't think
anyone has accused the Legislature of that.
Under the amendment the ASSU president would
appoint the editor from those nominated by The
Daily's own editorial board, but he can appoint
his choice only with the approval of Legislature.
The Legislature has the final say. As for the
removal of the Daily editor- from office, that can
be done with the approval of Legislature now
under the present by-laws. The Legislature has
"original power" over all ASSU organizations.
This power has to be somewhere, and the Cramers
of our ASSU constitution thought that the best
place would be Legislature. No one has thus far
accused the Legislature of misusing this great
power and betraying the confidence of its found
ers or the students whom it serves. There is rnV
reason to believe that the Legislature will misuse
this power in the future.
T know I would not sit idly by and let the ASSU
president appoint an editor who was not the first
choice of The Daily unless there were irrefutable
reasons for disqualifying him. I know the other
present members of the Legislature would not
be a rubber stamp either. Even if a legislator
were elected who did not have a strong sense of
student responsibility, he would certainly have
enough pride to prevent his being used as a tool
of the ASSU president. The present ASSU presi
dent would never try to force his will on the
Legislature; this 1 know from personal expe
rience.
Once the editor was appointed, he would be
just as free as he is now. The Legislature has not
removed Daily editors in Ihe past. I don't think
lhat anyone should think that suddenly it will
start now—it has the power to do so all the time.
Lastly, it is a part of the Legislature's job to
keep campus organizations on their toes and pro
mote interest in student affairs. It is the Legis
lature's right to criticize just as much as it is the
l ight of The Daily or any other interested party.
Whether this amendment is defeated or passed,
I think it has done a lot of good for the Stanford
student body.
It has certainly stimulated campus interest. It
has further put both The Daily and Legislature
on their toes. And finally, believe it or not, it
has led to more co-operation between The Daily
and the Legislature than has existed in many
years. This last thing in itself may be viewed
by old-timers as a minor miracle. Many of us
have talked to Dave Scott and others on the Daily
staff, who have been most helpful in explaining
their position. I think we might have reached a
solid basis for co-operation. I certainly hope so.

Small Yapping Bog
Editor, The Daily:
At the risk of browbeating an issue on which
there has already been so much printed commen
tary that public interest may already be on the
wane, I would like to comment on a few of the
fundamental issues involved in the present LAS
SU-Daily squabble over the proposed procedural
change in the naming of the editor of The Daily.
I would first like to say that I think Mr. Freelen's
position justifying his proposal is essentially
sound. The ASSU does own, support and publish
The Daily. Of this there can be no doubt. The
LASSU is the body the students elect, no matter
how many of them actually exercise their right
to vote, to administer the business of the ASSU.
Of this there can also be no doubt. When The
Daily raises the issue of "freedom of the press"
in this context, they speak about freedom from
control by their owner and publisher. To expect
that kind of freedom is to be pathetically unreal
istic. I doubt if there is any newspaper in the
United States which is not controlled by and re
sponsible to its publisher. If the Daily staff
wants complete independence, let them publish
and finance their paper themselves. If they will
not or cannot do this, I suggest they accept in
principle the fact of their dependence upon the
ASSU.
Whether Freelen's specific proposal was justi
fied is of course another question. It is certainly
clear that in the past the ASSU has seen fit to
grant The Daily a vast degree of independence,
and hence, responsibility. As I have previously
stated, this has been independence to a degree far
vaster than that enjoyed by any commercial
newspaper, which does not enjoy such privileges
as a captive audience and a quarterly levy per
student. It is Freelen's opinion that The Daily
has, to some degree, abused this independence,
so that it is advisable to increase its sense of re
sponsibility to the ASSU in some way. I am not.
closely enough in touch with the situation which
led Freelen to this conclusion to be able to per
fectly evaluate it, but I do know that since I have
been at Stanford, I have seen The Daily do a good
many rather unwise things. It can certainly
never be said that it is afraid to put its foot in
its mouth, and if necessary, keep it there. I
have heard a good many justifiable complaints
us to its policies. I have known people and or
ganizations whom it has annoyed. 1 think it is
entirely possible, then, that Freelen is justified
in believing that some restrictive action is neces
sary.
In feeling thai some restrictive action is neces
sary, however, I think Freelen perhaps is guilty
of overestimating The Daily. By attempting to
bring it to bay, he perhaps joins the small mi
nority on campus which actually takes The Daily
at its word as to its own importance. Sometimes
when a man has a small dog yapping at his heels
ho is better off to ignore it rather than to give
il his attention by trying to reason with it, or
worse, by kicking it. The Daily has the right to
consider itself as important as it wants. It has
the right to fight for whatever degree of inde
pendence it desires.
The essence of democracy is that each interest
has the right to express its desires and attempt
to achieve them. However, because of these as
sertions of power and importance on the part, of
The Daily, coupled witii its occasional irrespon
sibility and inconsistency, its more-than-occasion
al one-sidedness and pettiness, and its obvious
fallibility, The Daily seems to have forfeited the
respect of the majority of the student body. In
coming freshmen are credulous, but by the time
a person has been here a year, lie has generally
learned to take The Daily with a rather sizable
grain of salt, and by his senior year he may have
gotten into the habit of reading it only for en
gagements, ads, intrcfmural basketball schedules
and for a chance to laugh at impassioned writers
of letters to the editors such as myself.
I think the attitude of The Daily could have
been directly responsible for this attitude, just as
the attitude of so-called "red hots" in student
government could have been responsible for dis
respect, apathy and George Ralph. In conclusion
I suggest that The Daily might find it wise to
adopt a little more humble and realistic attitude
toward its position on campus, that Mr. Freelen
might find it wise to take a little more time on
his proposal to curb The Daily, and perhaps come
up with a solution which will be a little more
practical and a little less inflammatory than ap

pointing the editor, if such a solution exists, and
that the readers of The Daily and of this article
continue not to worry too much about what
transpires upon these pages, but perhaps from
time to time give gentle and constructive criti
cism and opinion to the parties involved, such as
I sincerely hope that I have done. Such is the
privilege, and possibly the duty, of the con
stituent.

Many Honest Views
Editor, The Daily:
For the past week many Stanford students
have expressed their opinions (some pretty ve
hemently) on the proposed amendment to the
Publications Board Standing Rules concerning
the selection of the editor of The Stanford Daily.
With great interest I have read the sampling of
these opinions printed in the"Letters to the Edi
tor" column.
A great many honest views on both sides of
the question have been presented to the Stanford
student body along with some opinions which
have been very emotional and prejudiced. This
is to be expected when people feel so strongly
about an issue. Even articles like Mr. Denny's
"Ode to the Legislature" are, I think, placed in
their proper perspective by a student body which
is basically pretty fair minded. If I did* not be
lieve this, I certainly would not have run for the
Legislature. I do feel, however, that there have
been certain points of view very pertinent to this
subject which have not been presented as yet to
the Stanford student body. Some of these are
my own; some of them have been brought to me
by interested students.
First of all, the amendment will not enable the
Legislature to "control" The Stanford Daily any
more than the Legislature "controls" The Daily
now. Under the present by-laws I don't think
anyone has accused the Legislature of that.
Under the amendment the ASSU president would

power and betraying the confidence of its found
ers or the students whom it serves. There is rnV
reason to believe that the Legislature will misuse
this power in the future.
T know I would not sit idly by and let the ASSU
president appoint an editor who was not the first
choice of The Daily unless there were irrefutable
reasons for disqualifying him. I know the other

be a rubber stamp either. Even if a legislator

student responsibility, he would certainly have
enough pride to prevent his being used as a tool
of the ASSU president. The present ASSU presi
dent would never try to force his will on the

just as free as he is now. The Legislature has not

lhat anyone should think that suddenly it will

by old-timers as a minor miracle. Many of us

their position. I think we might have reached a
solid basis for co-operation. I certainly hope so.
