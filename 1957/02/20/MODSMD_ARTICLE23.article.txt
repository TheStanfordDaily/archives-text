A Serious Suggestion
Editor, The Daily:
May I make this serious suggestion to counter
yesterday's offering?
Five years ago, editors were criticized for be
ing too provincial, for writing only of campus
events. And even then there were mutterings
from small groups which couldn't get their big
story in print. Now the editor is criticized for
being too worldly, for ignoring the events in
his own back yard.
both sides have merit. People who read only
The Daily and there are many want some
news of the "outside world," and it is a proper
service to give them such news. People who
read the San Francisco daily papers— ? and there
are many get more world news in greater depth
than The Daily could hope to give them. Thus,
they look lo The Daily only for local news, and
this is a service they have paid for and deserve.
There is, of course, a third element which de
serves consideration: the campus groups which
seek publicity for their activities through The
Daily, which, with their low or non-existent budg
ets, is really their only means of publicity. As
mentioned above, even when The Daily was al
most exclusively a "local" paper, the smaller
groups were squeezed off the pages. The squeeze
now, of course, is increased on all of them.
•
Apparenlly the proposers of this amendment
are trying to reconcile the conflicting views of
ihese three groups, each of which has a legiti
mate interest al stake. But merely allowing the
ASSU president lo appoint the editor will not do
the trick, for the editor still retains power to set
percentages of world versus local news.
This, really, 'is the issue: Wliat percentage of
world to local news will The Daily run? Clearly,
different editors have felt quite differently about
this question through the years. Often, of course,
their "policy" has been dictated by necessity: no
local stories or no reporters to write llrem, hence
Ihe resort to the news services.
Bui in the light of Ihe eternal criticism on this
point, might it not be wise once and for all lo
establish a general policy on this matter by
adopting a specific figure and incorporating il
into the Daily by-laws? II is suggested lhat your
staff set a minimum percentage of local news
in relation to total editorial matter, such per
centage to be determined on a monthly basis,
since clearly it would be impossible to hit the
minimum percentage on every issue.
Say the minimum average local coverage were
to be set at 70 per cent. Campus groups could be
assured that, during any month, they would have
a certain chance for coverage at least to that
extent—still subject to necessary priorities with
in the local news itself.
There is no lack of wisdom in establishing
long-range policy. And even when the motivating
force comes from without, one does not lose face
by acting wisely. Your staff is in a position to
put a long-standing issue at rest. May I suggest
that you would show both wisdom and laudable
initiative in establishing some policy like that set
forth above.

His Own Natural Way
Editor, The Daily:
1 am a little disturbed over the reeeni '...ir.sle
that has been going on between The Daily and
the Legislature over the editorial policies and
worth of our campus newspaper. I write this let
ter in hopes that I can perhaps help you end
this dispute.
Here at Wilbur Hall we have found The Daily
lo be a very necessary part of our college lives
and have no gripes as to ils worth or fine presen
tation. May 1 clarify our position?
Recently one of the Wilbur sponsors was given
a parakeet in a gilded cage as a present and this
fine bird has been adopted as a sort of dorm
pet. Each morning we rush out with avid en
thusiasm to get the morning edition and return
immediately lo present the editorial page to our
fine leathered friend. His reaction is unfalter
ingly marvelous. As he sits high on his perch
scanning the words of wisdom he never fails to
express his physical opinion. At this point the
gathered Wilburites cheer with glee at seeing
our little friend of wisdom showing in his own
natural way thai lie is in agreement with the vast
majority.
I think you can now see how we at Wilbur
can't help but applaud The Daily, for not only
does il keep one of our best friends on the path
of good health through its regularity of publica
tion, but just in the interest of the Health Depart
ment and good sanitation we find The Daily indis
pensable (or dispensable as the case may be). So
lo The Daily we sing loud and clear, "Keep up the
good work" as your efforts are being rewarded.
Thanks so much,

Inherent Right of Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
When legislators vote tonight whether the
editor of The Daily shall be freely chosen by
qualified staff members or hand picked by gov
ernmental authorities, I hope they realize lhat
they may be tampering with a basic tenet of de
mocracy freedom of the press. The term has
been bandied about a lot since last Thursday,
and seems to have lost some of its meaning.
How can a newspaper editor chosen by Legis
lature really be free lo criticize and interpret
editorially? After all, if he were dependent on
Legislature for his job, would he bile the hand

that fed him? It is hard to believe that the pro
ponents ol' this move are so naive as to believe
that this would really "improve" The Daily. Un
doubtedly it would mean more news and less
criticism of Legislature. But this is not the
function of a free newspaper. Whether The Daily
is now agreeable or critical, "good" or "bad," the
editor must not have to rely on any outside or
ganization for his authority and power.
As editor-in-chief of the Syracuse University
Daily last year, 1 was interested and impressed
by a statement of President Sterling's, printed
in Editor and Publisher, the newspaperman's
trade journal. In essence, he said freedom of Ihe
press is just as important for college newspapers
as for professional papers.
Now Legislature is trying to carve away the
foundations of that freedom. It would not be
hard for the president of Legislature to find out
which ol' the three candidates would be most
favorable to government- which one would do
and print what Legislature wanted him to. Look
ahead a lew years. Even if the motives behind
the present move are Simon-pure, who is to .say
that in a few years the individuals choosing the
editor will not name ihe one they know is most
favorable to them, regardless of his journalistic
talents or abilities.
How could anyone outside of the Daily staff it
self know the best-qualified person for editor?
The Daily is a self-perpetuating organization for
the simple reason that special training, skills and
talents are needed to carry on the functions of a
newspaper.
It is The Daily's inherent right as an American
newspaper to be free—free to follow the News
paper Code of Ethics, free from Ihe dictates of
Legislature, free to choose its own editor.
Those who don't like the present newspaper
can see the editor persona-lly, write a letter or
join the stall and work from the inside for a
change.

Dedicated to Dictating
Editor, The Daily:
.Re: the proposed action by the Legislature.
The Legislature has proposed a by-law change
that would make the Daily editor appointed by,
and responsible to, ihe Legislature. In so doing,
they are violating every traditional concept of
freedom of the press—namely that the press is
free from any governmental domination.
Article I of the U.S. Constitution and Article T
(Section 9) of Ihe California Constitution pro
hibit infringement of freedom of the press. Is it
too much to ask of the Legislature that they be
bound by common and fundamental principles of
any political democracy? It is to elucidate the
obvious to say that control of the press is one
of the first steps to tyranny—without a free
forum of expression, freedom of speech, con
science, etc., are but empty words.
It is not out of agreement with or approval of
The Daily's policies that this is written. But, if
I should disagree, I reserve the light 1o do so
and will not see it -given to any governing body.
The press is responsible 1o a democracy only
as to those issues which may affect national se
curity or a social code of decency. It is respon
sible to the individual for its statements and
policies, under civil libel laws. It is not, nor
should il be, responsible to a governmental body
for its editorial views or for its formats. The
press is an instrument of information for free
people, thai they may Ihink and judge freely—
not a vehicle for government propaganda.
In conclusion, I trust thai adherence lo demo
cratic principles will prevail over Ihe view of
a Legislature seemingly dedicated lo dictating
rather than governing.

Come Down to Earth
Editor, The Daily:
While agreeing that the ASSU president should
not have the power to appoint the Editor of The
Daily, we think that much of the current prob
lem is the fault of the Daily staff.
Agreeing with Mr. Datisman ("Letters"to the
Editor," Feb. 18), we feel that The Daily devoles
too much space and too many words on national
news. The day-to-day hard labors on the part of
ASSU officials and various committees are rarely
reported. We therefore suggest thai the editors
of The Daily "come down to earth" and stop plan
ning their future grandiose careers with the New
York Times.
Repeatedly chairmen of important committees
on campus have had to come to The Daily seek
ing publicity for their functions only to be arro
gantly turned away. The editors have not en
deared themselves lo campus officials with this
attitude and Ihe rise of this issue is, we feel, a
culmination to a series of events showing The
Daily's scornful disposition.
We suggest that instead of the current pro
posed change in the by-law, the by-law be written
so that the ASSU presidenl exercises partial con
trol over The Daily. It is hfgh lime The Daily
realized that the ASSU government, representing
ihe student body, is Ihe boss!
