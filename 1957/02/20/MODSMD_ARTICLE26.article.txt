# Clegg Predicts Frosh Victory In Cal Rematch
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
Revenge for an earlier 42-40
dumping will be in the minds of
Stanford's Papooses Friday night
when they tangle with the Cali
fornia frosh in a 6 p.m. prelim
nary at the Pavilion. The Pa
pooses were beaten Jan. 8 by a
pair of free throws in the last
four seconds.
Stanford coach Dick Clegg sees
victory for his local charges in
this weekend's rematch, how
ever. "Cal's defensive press beat
us last time,"*he notes, "but our
experience since that game will
make us ready.
"We will be up for the game,"
the frosh mentor added.
Scrimmage with Varsity
The frosh practiced yesterday
against defensive measures simi
lar to those used by the Berkeley
team. Today they are scheduled
to scrimmage with the varsity in
an effort to be well prepared for
Friday's visitors.
California freshmen this year
have posted a 5-6 season record,
which includes a 15-point loss to
San Jose J.C., a team the frosh
conquered by a 68-;16 margin early
in the year.
Academic problems have hurt
the Berkeley squad this year,
forcing two of the early-season
starters to cut their' season short.
Study problems have sidelined
for ward Terry Thomas and guard
Will McCullough.
Schneider Dangerous
Stanford eyes will be on fi-4
forward Earl Schneider, who
dumped in 14 counters against
the fro,sh in Berkeley. Six-two
guard Gerry Mann will also be
dangerous. He scored 13 points in
the 42-40 California win. Darrell
Imhoff, 0- 8 center, is another'
point of concentration for the
locals.
Little John Stabler has replaced
Dick Thompson in the Papoose
starting lineup at guard. The
other guard post will be filled by
Mike Tipton. Neal Brockmeyer
will be the frosh center, and Jerry
Thuesen and Chris Burford will
open at forwards.
