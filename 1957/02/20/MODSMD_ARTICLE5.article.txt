# SU May Take Action Against Trancos Party
## University Concerned About Beer-Drinking At Freshman Dance 
### 
The University may take disci
plinary action in connection with
the off - campus beer-gambling
party thrown Feb. 8 by Trancos
hduse of Wilbur Hall, according
to house spokesman Bruce Mit
chell.
In the aftermath of the party,
on Feb. 10 gambling equipment
worth $SXO was stolen. No clues
have since turned up, Mitchell
said.
Mitchell, freshman from West
ern Springs, 111,, said a keg of
beer was served at the party, but
he did not know where it had
come from."I don't know if they
| the Foothills Club, Sunnyvale,
where the party was held) sold it
to us or not. it was there when
we got there."
This aspect of the party is what
is causing concern among Uni
versity officials, Mitchell said.
Party Sanctioned
The party itself was sanctioned
because it had been registered
with the Associated Students. But
such parties aren't sanctioned
when beer is sold, Mitchell said,
unless all students attending are
over 21.
"These were freshmen," the
spokesman said, "and the Univer
sity is looking into it for disci
plinary action.
"They're doing plenty of yell
ing about it,"he added.
Money was not used at the
party to play gambling devices,
Mitchell said. He said each fresh
man attending the party paid $1
to cover the party cost.
Free Tickets
But the 104 free gambling tick
ets each man received were, not
worth any money, Mitchell said.
The equipment was rented from
Gimbeil-Graham Co., San Francis
co, and was due back Feb. 11, the
day after its theft.
A Stanford Police Department
official said yesterday the depart
ment was never notified of Ihc
theft, but Mitchell denied this.
"According to all the information
I have," he said, "they were noti
fied."
Mitchell wrote a letter to The
Daily Feb. 13 appealing for the
equipment's return. The letter
was written, he said, because he
felt there was a serious violation
of the Fundamental Standard in
the theft.
