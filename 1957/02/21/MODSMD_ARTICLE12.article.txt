# Now Women Want Frogs
## 
### 
Last night the Ruble spon
sors proved their theory that
people accept things without
question.
Though the idea was com
pletely radical, they told the
freshman girls that it was a
tradition tor Roble to have a
frog hunt at Lake Lagunita.
In spite of the rain a group
of 50 or 60 girls participated.
Corridor 2A won the hunt with
a total catch of 12 frogs; 3A
came in second with seven.
The sponsors want the girls
to know that they had a won
derful time and they hope that
an annual frog hunt will be
come a tradition at Roble.
