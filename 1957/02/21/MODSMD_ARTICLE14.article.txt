## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UP)
—Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland urged Presi
dent Eisenhower today to demand
sanctions against any nation de
fying the United Nations — not
just Israel — when the explosive
question comes before the UN to
morrow.
Knowland offered his plan at a
White House conference called by
Eisenhower just 24 hours before
the UN showdown. The UN takes
up tomorrow an Afro-Asian pro
posal to punish Israel for refusal
to withdraw its troops from
Egyptian territory.
Immediately after the White
House meeting, Eisenhower
scheduled a nationwide radio
television address (from 6 to 6:30
p.m., PST) to report to the people
on "the present situation" in the
Middle East.
No Decision Reached
Members of the 26-man Con
gressional delegation who attend
ed the conference with Eisenhow
er reported afterward that no de
cision was reached on the posi
tion to be taken by this nation
before the UN.
But Knowland's proposal, if ac
cepted by Eisenhower, would be
offered by the United States as a
substitute for the Afro-Asian res
olution. It called for sanctions
against any nation "large or
small" which rebuffs UN reso
lutions.
Knowland, a U.S. delegate to
the UN General Assembly, said
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles and Henry Cabot Lodge
Jr., U.S. ambassador to the UN,
asked for a copy of his proposal.
Beyond that he declined to say
what reaction it received.
Hungary Revolt
Knowland has opposed sanc
tions against Israel, especially in
view of the fact that no move has
been taken against Russia for ig
noring UN condemnation of its
intervention in the Hungarian re
volt.
Knowland said he the im
pression at Ihe White House
meeting that the administration
had not decided whether to vote
for the Afro - Asian resolution
against Israel. At the same time,
he voiced belief the United States
held the deciding vote.
Others present at the White
House, including Senators H. Al
exander Smith (R-N.J.) and Rich
ard B. Russell (D-Ga.), said they
believed the administration con
sidered some form of sanctions
against Israel inevitable.

believed the administration con
sidered some form of sanctions
against Israel inevitable.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UP)
—Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland urged Presi
dent Eisenhower today to demand
sanctions against any nation de
fying the United Nations — not
just Israel — when the explosive
question comes before the UN to
morrow.
Knowland offered his plan at a
White House conference called by
Eisenhower just 24 hours before
the UN showdown. The UN takes
up tomorrow an Afro-Asian pro
posal to punish Israel for refusal
to withdraw its troops from
Egyptian territory.
Immediately after the White
House meeting, Eisenhower
scheduled a nationwide radio
television address (from 6 to 6:30
p.m., PST) to report to the people
on "the present situation" in the
Middle East.
No Decision Reached
Members of the 26-man Con
gressional delegation who attend
ed the conference with Eisenhow
er reported afterward that no de
cision was reached on the posi
tion to be taken by this nation
before the UN.
But Knowland's proposal, if ac
cepted by Eisenhower, would be
offered by the United States as a
substitute for the Afro-Asian res
olution. It called for sanctions
against any nation "large or
small" which rebuffs UN reso
lutions.
Knowland, a U.S. delegate to
the UN General Assembly, said
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles and Henry Cabot Lodge
Jr., U.S. ambassador to the UN,
asked for a copy of his proposal.
Beyond that he declined to say
what reaction it received.
Hungary Revolt
Knowland has opposed sanc
tions against Israel, especially in
view of the fact that no move has
been taken against Russia for ig
noring UN condemnation of its
intervention in the Hungarian re
volt.
Knowland said he the im
pression at Ihe White House
meeting that the administration
had not decided whether to vote
for the Afro - Asian resolution
against Israel. At the same time,
he voiced belief the United States
held the deciding vote.
Others present at the White
House, including Senators H. Al
exander Smith (R-N.J.) and Rich
ard B. Russell (D-Ga.), said they
believed the administration con
sidered some form of sanctions
against Israel inevitable.
