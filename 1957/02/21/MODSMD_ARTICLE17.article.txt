# Revamping Needed
## 
### 
Part of the Political Union's trouble does
not lie in the organization itself; it lies in the
attitude .of the student body in general.
Professor Lawrence Ebb gave a talk three
weeks ago before the Political Union on his
proposed Constitutional Amendment. It was
well publicized in advance in The Daily. Eight
people attended. Four of them were Political
Union officers and one was a Daily reporter.
The main trouble seems to be a complete
indifference by the student body in general.
Other traditions and organizations have had
their troubles also. Big Game Bonfire and
Back to the Farm Week are both fading into
obscurity.
Apathy and conformity aren't the only rea
sons, although admittedly they contribute a
major part. It also is a changing and in some
ways maturing student body, one that demands
new values and new patterns in its activities.
The answer is either to try to persist in the
old traditions or to dissolve them altogether.
The solution is one of revamping and mod
ernizing.

The Political Union as it is now set up
obviously is not succeeding. A realistic solu
tion could be the dissolving of the Union as it
now stands and the bringing of the Stanford
Area \oung Republicans and the Sjtanford
Area Young Democrats onto the campus., under
an over-all Political Union-type setup.
The charity drives seem to be headed in the
same direction. Despite chairman Skip Ren
ner's persistent efforts, the Winter Quarter
Charity Drive netted not quite $4000. not even
50 cents a Stanford student.
Something must be done to shake the student
out of this apparent disinterest in the welfare
of other people in the world. Gimmicks were
tried; they failed. Maybe a more forceful
method of solicitation ia needed, with better
dorm-to-doi"m coverage.
Traditions and organizations are a good
thing for the campus. They should be perpetu
ated and perhaps extended. But-if they aren't
modernized for the new generation, then thev
are useless.
