India's Side of Controversy
Editor, The Daily:
Those who are internationally minded cannot
skip over the Chronicle (Feb. 5) and Life (Feb. 4
and 11) regarding the Kashmir issue. I wish to
make more comment upon the editorial as it is
found in Life of Feb. 11. I wish also that lIR
could arrange a talk on this international con
troversy.
It is indeed a great pity to observe the head
lines of the editorial and to learn that the action
has been branded as a defiance in par with latest
Hungarian and Egyptian moves. One has to re
member that the newly independent Asian coun
tries . . . sketch out their major policies in con
formity with their standing in both internal and
international spheres. . . .
The comment that ". . . India has created a
puppet constituent assembly in the part of Kash
mir it controls . . stands far from the fact
that India has neither created nor that it con
trols.
More interesting ... is the fact that the Kash
mir issue is coupled with the premier's candidacy
in the forthcoming election. , . .
If the spirit of any international organization
is to see that all men are provided with a decent
economic standard under a stabilized political
situation, there is no problem whatsoever regard
ing this issue. . . .
Ex-British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, af
ter a visit to Kashmir, said, ". . . it is my im
pression that the present regime (in Kashmir)
is successful. It is also thoroughly democratic
with local self-government all the way up from
the village. I think that Kashmir has definitely
opted for union with India."

Ali-Campus Drag Race
Editor, The Daily:
The problem of the restrictive speed laws on
campus versus the students with cars has be
come progresively worse. Stop signs have been
hacked down, a great many speeding citations
have been given out by the police, and many stu
dents are continually racing each other all over
the campus. If these drivers wei~e once or twice
legally allowed to speed, and to race each other,
the laws around the campus would be obeyed
much more willingly than they have been obeyed
I understand that the Frosh-Soph Jamboree
will not take place this year. It seems that all
the cars and bikes (motorcycles) could make up
a successful replacement for it some Sunday—
an all-campus drag race. If a nominal participa
tion fee were charged, the proceeds would be a
good source for charity. Two feasible locations
for the race are Escondido Road in front of Stern
and Wilbur Halls, 01* the road from Palm Drive
over to the entrance to the Con Home in back
of the Stanford Shopping Center.
Naturally, all side roads would have to be tem
porarily blocked off, but that is no problem
About all that would be necessary for the drag
would be a set of clocks, which can be rented, and
a public address system which the University
already has in stock. There would be only five
classes necessary stock, modified stock, sports,
bikes and hot. ,
The event would certainly be the first of its
kind on the campus, and I think the novelty of
it would prove it to be a success.

Ali-Campus Drag Race
Editor, The Daily:
The problem of the restrictive speed laws on
campus versus the students with cars has be
come progresively worse. Stop signs have been
hacked down, a great many speeding citations
have been given out by the police, and many stu
dents are continually racing each other all over
the campus. If these drivers wei~e once or twice
legally allowed to speed, and to race each other,
the laws around the campus would be obeyed
much more willingly than they have been obeyed
I understand that the Frosh-Soph Jamboree
will not take place this year. It seems that all
the cars and bikes (motorcycles) could make up
a successful replacement for it some Sunday—
an all-campus drag race. If a nominal participa
tion fee were charged, the proceeds would be a
good source for charity. Two feasible locations
for the race are Escondido Road in front of Stern
and Wilbur Halls, 01* the road from Palm Drive
over to the entrance to the Con Home in back
of the Stanford Shopping Center.
Naturally, all side roads would have to be tem
porarily blocked off, but that is no problem
About all that would be necessary for the drag
would be a set of clocks, which can be rented, and
a public address system which the University
already has in stock. There would be only five
classes necessary stock, modified stock, sports,
bikes and hot. ,
The event would certainly be the first of its
kind on the campus, and I think the novelty of
it would prove it to be a success.

Those who are internationally minded cannot
skip over the Chronicle (Feb. 5) and Life (Feb. 4

make more comment upon the editorial as it is

could arrange a talk on this international con
troversy.
It is indeed a great pity to observe the head
lines of the editorial and to learn that the action
has been branded as a defiance in par with latest
Hungarian and Egyptian moves. One has to re
