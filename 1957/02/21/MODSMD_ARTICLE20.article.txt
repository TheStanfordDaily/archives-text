# THE 						NATIONAL SCENE
## Are Labor Unions Too Strong? 
### Wally Simpson Jim Palmer 
A long time ago in American history manu
facturers discovered that mass production
brought about by standardization resulted in bet
ter commodities produced at cheaper costs.
Not nearly so long ago in American history
wage earners discovered that organization into
unions resulting in randardization of demands
for wages and conditions brought about better
wages at less costs in effort to the individual.
Jhe big£ei the manufacturer was, the better
off both he and the consume) were. The oiggi r
the union was, the octroi ot t the wage earner and
the consume! who There are definite benefits
in bigness, whether in business or m labor
The question arose,, however Would not big
ness ci business hurt the consumer through
danger of monopoly 7 And would not bigness of
labor organization hurt the laborer because ol
danger of deprivation ot his political and human
rights ?
The answei to the first question was found to
be definitely true, because there was no check
on business until organized labor served as one—
except for big government. But why should the
answer to the second be true?
At the present time there are in America a
number of unions that are corrupt in their poll
cies, dictatorial in their control over their mem
bers and abusive to the labor movement as a
whole
But it is no more necessary lor a union to be
corrupt or dictatorial than it is for a nation 01
the world to have a corrupt or dictatorial govern
ment A corrupt government comes into being
because the proper safeguards against it were
not put into effect.
The same thing applies to the corrupt union.
When it was organized, the proper safeguards
were not put into the constitution. But oply the
people can remove a corrupt government. Only
the can truly remove a corrupt situ
ation within a union.
Strangely enough, it is not bigness that creates
corruption. Corruption is found primarily in
small locals that are practically autonomous units
and are almost entirely without the control of
the national bodies.
Before the AFL and CIO joined forces, little
was done in'the labor field to clean up corrupt
unions and get rid of dictatorial gangster and
Communistic officials.
It took bigness to enable the unions to do this
clean-up job themselves. And they want to do it,
because, after all, the union is the membership
and the membership is the collective individual
who demands that fys rights be kept sacred.
Bigness will not hurt the rights of the indi
vidual worker. On the contrary, it will give him
more control over the official he elects to repre
sent him at the bargaining table
But it is the responsibility of the individual
worker to know enough about his union, to know
enough about what the officials of his union are
doing, to.be interested enough in the policies of
his union so that corruption has no chance to
start.

There is a danger to be faced !>y every Ameri
can worker today, 70 years alter Samue l Gompers
founded the ALL and big-time unionism gol its
start in the turmoil of riots and strikes.
The danger, strangely enough, is that the work
er for whose*rights the labor union was designed
to protect now faces the prospect <>i losing his
rights because ol labor's growth in power
The individual worker receives a material bene
fit horn the operation of union power tithe col
lective bargaining tables and in concerted force
lor wage demand:--.
There is no denying that unionism ha:; brought
the prosperity ol the vvorkci to the highest level
in history, .1 level which without unions 11 would
have been impossible to attain
But this is not to say that there is no point
beyond which unions cease to tie ol benefit and
instead become a chain around the neck <> 1 those
who compose the union
The merger ol the AF'L and CIO brought the
danger closer to becoming realized Now ovei
16 million Americans have submitted i<> the le;ui
ership of single chains ol command
Long betore passage of the Taft-Hartley Act,
the dangers of unlimited union strength were
readily apparent to (Jie workers themselves as
well as management.
While that aci was, and still is, admittedly
imperfect, it remains as the first recognition by
the Congress ol the approaching danger and the
first attempt to cope with it. There is no doubt
but that it the development ol union powers in
the past 2o years is continued, there will be neces
sitated more restrictive legislation along tin- lines
ol the Talt Hartley Ac!
The danger referred to, narrowly defined, is
this:
• Dictatorial strength in the union hierarchy
leads to-usurpation ol the 112 reedom ot members
in a wide range ol areas. These areas include
political as well us economic factors.
• The individual worker's freedom to choose
between submission to union authority and non
submission is eliminated. The result is a virtual
control over the job personnel ol the shop in a
"closed shop" situation.
• An overbalance ol bargaining power on Hie
part of the union wreaks havoc with the principle
of mediation, since by "power plays" (he union
could dictate any result ii desired, with there
suiting damage to the entire business structure.
Legislation is needed to limit the strength of
the union while still allowing it to maintain a
status sufficient to represent the working people
and to administer their common interests without
assuming the role of a leviathan.
Already the strength of labor has grown to the
point thai ii may be highly impossible for the
Congress to enact restrictive legislation of any
type. An excess of pressure, an excess of strength
is leading to a deplelion ol freedom and balance
necessary to the maintenance of a tree enterprise
economic system.
The time for doing something is at hand.

A long time ago in American history manu
facturers discovered that mass production
brought about by standardization resulted in bet
ter commodities produced at cheaper costs.
Not nearly so long ago in American history
wage earners discovered that organization into
unions resulting in randardization of demands
for wages and conditions brought about better
wages at less costs in effort to the individual.

off both he and the consume) were. The oiggi r
the union was, the octroi ot t the wage earner and
the consume! who There are definite benefits
in bigness, whether in business or m labor
The question arose,, however Would not big
ness ci business hurt the consumer through
danger of monopoly 7 And would not bigness of
labor organization hurt the laborer because ol
danger of deprivation ot his political and human
rights ?
The answei to the first question was found to
be definitely true, because there was no check
on business until organized labor served as one—
except for big government. But why should the
answer to the second be true?
At the present time there are in America a
number of unions that are corrupt in their poll
cies, dictatorial in their control over their mem
bers and abusive to the labor movement as a
whole
But it is no more necessary lor a union to be
corrupt or dictatorial than it is for a nation 01
the world to have a corrupt or dictatorial govern
ment A corrupt government comes into being
because the proper safeguards against it were
not put into effect.
The same thing applies to the corrupt union.
When it was organized, the proper safeguards
were not put into the constitution. But oply the
people can remove a corrupt government. Only
the can truly remove a corrupt situ
ation within a union.
Strangely enough, it is not bigness that creates
corruption. Corruption is found primarily in
small locals that are practically autonomous units
and are almost entirely without the control of
the national bodies.
Before the AFL and CIO joined forces, little
was done in'the labor field to clean up corrupt
unions and get rid of dictatorial gangster and
Communistic officials.
It took bigness to enable the unions to do this
clean-up job themselves. And they want to do it,
because, after all, the union is the membership
and the membership is the collective individual
who demands that fys rights be kept sacred.
Bigness will not hurt the rights of the indi
vidual worker. On the contrary, it will give him
more control over the official he elects to repre
sent him at the bargaining table
But it is the responsibility of the individual
worker to know enough about his union, to know
enough about what the officials of his union are
doing, to.be interested enough in the policies of
his union so that corruption has no chance to
start.

imperfect, it remains as the first recognition by

first attempt to cope with it. There is no doubt

Long betore passage of the Taft-Hartley Act,
the dangers of unlimited union strength were
readily apparent to (Jie workers themselves as
well as management.
While that aci was, and still is, admittedly
imperfect, it remains as the first recognition by
the Congress ol the approaching danger and the
first attempt to cope with it. There is no doubt
but that it the development ol union powers in
the past 2o years is continued, there will be neces
sitated more restrictive legislation along tin- lines

The danger referred to, narrowly defined, is
this:
• Dictatorial strength in the union hierarchy
leads to-usurpation ol the 112 reedom ot members
in a wide range ol areas. These areas include
political as well us economic factors.
• The individual worker's freedom to choose
between submission to union authority and non
submission is eliminated. The result is a virtual
control over the job personnel ol the shop in a
"closed shop" situation.
• An overbalance ol bargaining power on Hie
part of the union wreaks havoc with the principle
of mediation, since by "power plays" (he union
could dictate any result ii desired, with there
suiting damage to the entire business structure.
Legislation is needed to limit the strength of
the union while still allowing it to maintain a
status sufficient to represent the working people
and to administer their common interests without
assuming the role of a leviathan.
Already the strength of labor has grown to the
point thai ii may be highly impossible for the
Congress to enact restrictive legislation of any
type. An excess of pressure, an excess of strength
is leading to a deplelion ol freedom and balance
necessary to the maintenance of a tree enterprise

A long time ago in American history manu
facturers discovered that mass production
brought about by standardization resulted in bet
ter commodities produced at cheaper costs.
Not nearly so long ago in American history
wage earners discovered that organization into
unions resulting in randardization of demands
for wages and conditions brought about better
wages at less costs in effort to the individual.

off both he and the consume) were. The oiggi r
the union was, the octroi ot t the wage earner and
the consume! who There are definite benefits
in bigness, whether in business or m labor
The question arose,, however Would not big
ness ci business hurt the consumer through
danger of monopoly 7 And would not bigness of
labor organization hurt the laborer because ol
danger of deprivation ot his political and human
rights ?
The answei to the first question was found to
be definitely true, because there was no check
on business until organized labor served as one—
except for big government. But why should the
answer to the second be true?
At the present time there are in America a
number of unions that are corrupt in their poll
cies, dictatorial in their control over their mem
bers and abusive to the labor movement as a
whole
But it is no more necessary lor a union to be
corrupt or dictatorial than it is for a nation 01
the world to have a corrupt or dictatorial govern
ment A corrupt government comes into being
because the proper safeguards against it were
not put into effect.
The same thing applies to the corrupt union.
When it was organized, the proper safeguards
were not put into the constitution. But oply the
people can remove a corrupt government. Only
the can truly remove a corrupt situ
ation within a union.
Strangely enough, it is not bigness that creates
corruption. Corruption is found primarily in
small locals that are practically autonomous units
and are almost entirely without the control of
the national bodies.
Before the AFL and CIO joined forces, little
was done in'the labor field to clean up corrupt
unions and get rid of dictatorial gangster and
Communistic officials.
It took bigness to enable the unions to do this
clean-up job themselves. And they want to do it,
because, after all, the union is the membership
and the membership is the collective individual
who demands that fys rights be kept sacred.
Bigness will not hurt the rights of the indi
vidual worker. On the contrary, it will give him
more control over the official he elects to repre
sent him at the bargaining table
But it is the responsibility of the individual
worker to know enough about his union, to know
enough about what the officials of his union are
doing, to.be interested enough in the policies of
his union so that corruption has no chance to
start.
