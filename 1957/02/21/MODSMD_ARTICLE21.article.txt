# Flyers Financially Unable to Affiliate With University
## 
### 
Financial difficulties are keep
ing the Indian Flyers from being
affiliated with the University.
Stanford would like the club to
buy a liability insurance policy for |
$1 million in the name of ASSU |
and Stanford University.
The club already has a $300,000'
liability policy taken out in its
own name. According lo Presi-J
dent John Cardoza, Ihe $300 thai j
the additional insurance policy j
will cost is the only matter at
present that is holding back the
affiliation witli the University.
As an incorporated body, Ihe
flying club is liable for any suit
brought against it, hut it the clu,b
affiliates with the University i1 is
uncertain, according lo University
attorneys, whether or not I lie Uni
versity can be sued in conjunction
with a suit brought against Ihe
Indian Flyers. Because of this un !
certainty the University feels it
has no choice bul to ask for a
liability policy in its own name.
