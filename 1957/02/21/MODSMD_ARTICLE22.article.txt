# Student Employment Aid At Stanford for 30 Years
## University and Outside Jobs Tracked Down; Private Advice Instead of Impersonal Service 
### Steve Deck 
II all began with one woman
in the basement of the old Ad
ministration Building (the pres
ent Law School) some 30 years
ago who found jobs for senior
students about to embark upon
earning a living.
Placement activities since that
lime have grown into the com
bined Placement Service and Stu
dent Employment Service located
in Building 1, Inner Quad.
Organized formally in 1945 dur
ing President Donald B. Tresid
der's administration, the Service
investigates job possibilities in all
University departments except
law, medicine and nursing. Thus,
Stanford accomplishes in one cen
tralized operation what may take
as many as 17 different organiza
tions to do on other university
campuses.
Staff Acts as Liaison
Director of the Placement Serv
ice is Eugene William Dils. To
gether with II C. Beverstock,
associate director, and Mrs. Mary
Bockius, assistant director, the
Placement Service staff acts as
liaison between companies and
students.
Mrs. Barbara Cochran, assist
ant director and manager of stu
dent employment, helps students
find part-time and temporary jobs
for the time they are in school.
This service is important to the
student to gain experience at
working and in finding what
types of jobs interest him.
Activities Expanding
Placement S c r vi e e activities
have been steadily expanding
since its formal installation in
1945; and this growth parallels
I Ik* growth of counseling services
in universities throughout the na
tion.

Representatives from 438 com
panies interviewed students on
campus last year, and nearly 20,-
000 job possibilities were listed.
Student interest is echoed by the
fact that some 2400 students reg
istered last year for aid in plan
ning their futures. The registered
names are kept on active file dur
ing the placement year ending
Sept. 1, and then kept on inactive
file until death of the registrant.
Preliminary Interview
Ideally, students should regis
ter within two quarters of gradu
ation.
During registration the student
will have a preliminary interview
with an appropriate counselor, de
pending on his major. Director
Dils presides over school adminis
tration and college teaching in
terests; Beverstock handles busi
ness and technical fields, and Mrs.
Bockius takes care of education
and women's fields. In this way
the emphasis is placed on indi
vidual counseling and advice lath
er than an impersonal mechanical
listing of available jobs.
Interviews Arranged
Interviews with company repre
sentatives are then arranged. Stu
dents may also receive notice by
mail of special jobs from compa
nies which cannot send represent
alives to the campus. Finally, it
is up to the student to make the
decision.
The largest number of jobs of
feted appears to be in technical
fields because of the present me
chanical civilization and the em
phasis on defense in the United
S t a I es. However, non-technical
majors will find opportunities in
.business and industry for both
men and women. There is a so
vere shortage of teachers at all
levels.
