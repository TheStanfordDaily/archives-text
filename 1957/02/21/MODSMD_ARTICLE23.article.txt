# VOLUNTEER ASSOCIATION
## Cats in Trees, False Alarms Handled by Student Firemen 
### Dave Canfield 
One of America's first college
owned fire protection organiza
tions manned by students.
That was the distinction the
Stanford Fire Department enjoy
ed back in 1932 when University
officials decided to employ a num
ber of students to enable them to
help pay their way through col
lege during the depression.
Today a crew of 25 men—l 4 stu
dents. 10 full-time professional
fire fighters and Chief John Mar
ston -devote themselves 1o pro
tecting Stanford against fires.
Marston said students and full
time employees are divided into
two shifts "so half of them are
on all the time."
Student shifts run 21 hours long
on week ends and every other
night during the week. During
this time the student fireman is
constantly on call.
If the call comes during the
night, firemen pile out of heds,
pull on their pants and slide down
the slippery pole. Grabbing their
hats and coats, they are off with
a siren blast and a flash of red
light to what may be a serious
fire, eat in a tree, asphyxia victim,
false alarm, or, as happened sev
eral years ago, a man caught in
a 30-foot test shaft.
Tf the penetrating blast of the
horn on top of (lie firehouse
sounds during the day, firemen re
port from their classes either to
Ihe firehouse or to the scene of
the fire, whichever is more con
venient.
ICeinuneration
For their efforts student fire
fighters receive $25 a month in
addition to free laundry and their
rooms. Student quarters are the

second floor of the rod-and white
wood frame firehou.se.
Drills .ire held once a week to
teach students fire-figh'ting meth
ods and how to operate certain
pieces of equipment. All of this
keeps the student fireman riuHo
busy, but the firehou.se takes
pride in its high scholastic av
erage, powerful intramural foot
ball and basketball teams and
prize-winning floats as well.
As for requirements for stu
dent firemen, Marston said, "No. 1
is he has to be someone who
needs a job." Prospects apply to
the chief, who says "there are
always 25 or 30 on the waiting
list."
The Fire Department has the
enviable record of never having
allowed one person to be seriously
injured in a campus lire. No seri
ous fire lias ever occurred in the
academic area, Marston said, al
though some potentially danger
ous ones have flared up in the
residential part of the campus's
9UOO acres.
ICm iiia Spared
"And there has never been a
serious fire at Eneina Ilall," Mar
ston said with warranted pride.
"We haven't had a serious fra
ternity house fire since the w;ir,
when Ihe top of one of the fra
ternity houses burned off."
Still, one never can tell. As
Marston said, business varies.
"Last year, due to flood condi
tions, we got over 50 calls in 21
hours. This year we haven't had
enough water to fill LagUnita."
Marston commended Ihe stu
dents for their excellent co-opera
tion, saying that was one of the
main reasons for I lie Fire Depart
ment's outstanding record.
