### Steve Baffrey 
It's all over for the Stanford
frosh hoop squad after Saturday
night's game with San Francisco
city College. Currently standing
13-2 on the season, Ihe locals hope
to go into Saturday's tussle with
a Friday night win over Califor
nia's freshman team.
Sid Phelan's SFCG club plans !
to give the frosh a good battle in !
their final game of the season.
Currently tied wilh Modesto J.C.
for the Big Eight conference lead,
San Francisco has a season rec-j
ord of 17 wins and 6 losses. Their 1
conference mark is 9-1.
Tn its. last nine outings San j
Francisco has compiled a perfect j
record one of the factors respon-1
sible for its having been named
the top junior college team in
northern California. Papoose
coach Dick Clegg believes it will
be the best starting lineup his
team has faced this season.
Local opinion has labeled Iho
City team a good club with an ex- j
ceptional amount of ball control, i
The squad always works for a :
good shot and has completed a j
high percentage of their field goal j
attempts this season.

Rob Tealor, fi-1 forward and a
Cal frosh star last year, leads the
squad offensively. He is support
ed by A) Mock, a fi-2 guard, whose
contributions have been valuable
in many wins this year.

KZSU will broadcast both
frosh games this weekend start
ing at (i p.m.

Six-seven center Doug Nprth is
the team rebound leader and an
exceptionally dangerous man on
the boards. Ron McCormack, for
ward, and Jack Russel, guard,
complete the SFCC starting five.
Saturday's (5 p.m. preliminary is
the last chance Stanford Papoose
fans will have to see the frosh in
action, and an early arrival at the
Pavilion will be well worth any
one's while. .
