## 
### 
Stanford's gymnastic troupe
sees its first action of the season
Saturday when it treks to San
Jose State for a meet with the
Spartan squad.
Seeing their first competition
last Friciay in an intrasquad meet
where the "Blues" edged the
"Reds," 32-31, the Indian gym
nasts located their weak spots
and, according to coach Wes Ruff,
found that they need some more
concentrated work before enter
ing intercollegiate competition.
Sixteen men of the 28 on Ihe
roster will make the San Jose trip.
Doug Cox will compete as an
all-around man for the Indians;
Don Brown will compete on the
parallel bars, and Art Dauer will
enter the free exercise competi
tion.
Frank Christensen will demon
strate his talent on the trampo
line, Dale Beernink on the side
horse, Cree Pillsbury on the high
bar and Norm Pincock in the rope
climb.
Ruff said that SU's best man,
Brice Atkinson, will probably not
see action at all this season, since
he is working outside school.
