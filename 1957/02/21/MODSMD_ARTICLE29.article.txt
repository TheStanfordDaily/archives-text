# Bond After 1000th Point, 48 Shy of Magic Number
## 
### Bob Payne 
Forward Bill Bond, who shunts for his 1000 th point this weekend,
appears destined lo take his' place among Ihe ;ill lime greats of Stan
ford basketball.
Bill, a 6-1 senior, needs only IS points in his remaining four
games to break the 1000 mark. Only three Cards have ever attained
this goal: Ron Tornsic, Hank Luisetti and George Selleck. In con
ference play this season Bond has scored 212!) points in 12 contests
for a 19.1 average.
"This is something I've dreamed of since the second grade, when
I started playing," said Bond "Names likt* I lank Luisetti were al
ways kind of household word:: around our place. I always aimed for
this."
Bill had a fabulous high school career at St. Anthony's High in
Long Beach where he was named prep All American as a senior and
captained the Catholic high school All-American live, lie also gar
nered his share ol scoring records, as might be expected.
The long jump shot with which Bond has scored nearly all of his
lield goals this season is ilie outgrowth ol a two-hand jumper lie
developed as a 5-foot, 2 inch ninth grader. "I got ii Iroin watching
Al Sawyer, who played for UCLA in those days. Al the lime I
adopted the two hauder because ol my si/.o but I've since turned it
into a one-hander and now I do all my shooting one-handed."
In his tremendous three-year career on the Card varsity, Hill rates
the national champion University of San Francisco Dons as Ihe best
team he has ever faced. The Dons' great Bill Russell ranks as the
g real est defensive man Bond has been up against while UCLA's
Willie Naulls gets (he nod as an offensive man.
In the Pacific Coast Conference this season, Bill rates California
slightly ahead of UCLA "on their own floor," but adds lhat UCLA
might take the Bears on a neutral floor, lie calls Washington State's
Larry Beck, current loop scoring leader, Hie best man he's faced in
the conference this season. "He |Beck| didn't look too good against
us . . . but he is."
The Indians are 6-6 in PCC play at 1 his time, which is consider
ably better than the preseason dopesters had figured. "Our record
doesn't do justice to the team. This season's squad may have been
better lhan last, year's."
Bond sees better years ahead for Stanford cage fortunes, lie
cites the play of the team's Ihree sophomore stars, Paul Neumann,
John Pflueger and Dick Haga, and the rebounding of the current
freshman squad. "Rebounding has been jus! about all that has kept
some of our recent teams out of the NCAA playoffs. We've never
had rebounding like the freshmen are doing, particularly (Neal)
Brockmeyer, (Jerry) Thuesen and (Chris) Burford."
Bill is going to bypass any professional or AA U basketball and
hopes to enter Harvard Business School after a tour in Ihe service.
But he's already had a great career. This weekend he makes his
final appearance at the Pavilion, when flip Cards take on Southern
California. There's a strong possibility thai Bill Bond may achieve
that 1000 mark against the Trojans. Al any rate he's going to he a
pretty lough man to replace.
