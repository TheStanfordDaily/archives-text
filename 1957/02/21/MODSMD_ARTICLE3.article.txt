# EDITORIAL
## Worse Than Before 
### 
liiihi iias I'KOl'onmi a piece of legislation concerning
the removal ol tlie Daily editor more dangerous than the
defeated proposal concerning the editor's election.
It would put the initiative for removing the editor in
llie hands of a dangerously small portion of the student body,
.) per cent. At present this would mean only 100 students.
Admittedly, this 5 |>er eenl initiative now exists, but
under 1 1 if A SSI J constitution lor the recall of any A.SSU
elected or appointed officer, the question is then taken to
the student body for approval by two-thirds of those voting.
I nder the proposal 11.» students could remove the Daily
editor the 100 petition signers and 15 Legislature members.
This would he cheating the student body of its demo
cratic rights. Four hundred fifteen students could remove
au editor who mav very well be favored by the remaining
70J5. r » members of the student body.
\\ ill. a method of recall already in the constitution, it
is wrong for the Daily editor to be singled out lor special
removal piocedure. II the student'bodv wishes to remove
the editor, there is now adequate machinery at its disposal.
I his proposal would result in far more control than the
reeeully-defeated amendment. We visualize the dav when
the heads of a very few organizations hand together to
Ilm •alcn the editor with recall procedure unless their organi
zations gel what 11 icy consider adequate space and placement
in the paper.
Or il an editor should offend Legislature in an editorial,
it would he possible for a disgruntled member to circulate
a petition which could easily he signed by 100 students and
bring the \ote to Legislature, which, in its moment of anger,
could recall the editor.
llie Dailv editor should not have such a threat hanging
over his head every lime he writes an editorial or decides
upon the presentation of nevys for an organization. This
violates every concept o( a free and intelligent press.
The Daily is an ASSU publication—this we will not deny.
But the editor cannot feel responsible if this responsibility
is put in the form of a veiled threat constantly hanging over
his head.
Our only responsibility is to our readers, the Associated
Students. I his we feel deeply. We also feel a responsibility
lo print ''publicity' 1 when il is of interest and value to these
readers.
W lietbcr this "publicity"' is in the interest of the par
ticular campus organization submitting that "publicity" is
incidental. We should hope that the interest of the organi
zation and the reader coincide, but, if il does not, then it is
not our responsibility lo print that "publicity."
We have talked in llie past week ol cooperation without
legislation. Ibis proposal violates every concept of this
phi losophy.
We also question whether this new legislative proposal
is actually aimed al cooperation or is merely legislation for
the sake of legislation.
