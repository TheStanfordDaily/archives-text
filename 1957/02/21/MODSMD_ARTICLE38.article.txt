# IS LAG 'WELL-ROUNDED'?
## Sophomore Women's Housing Problem Concerns Committee 
### Eve Eunson 
How tit place Stanford women in campus housing units is a prob
lem that repeatedly appears on the agenda at the Associated Women
Students cabinet meetings.
During the past few weeks the Housing Committee, an auxiliary
of AWS, has looked into the problem again. Notice came to the
. committee that tilde is tnnw onn.

, * i/miiuiicu men nitre is .some con
cern over the fact that Lagunita
has turned into a predominantly
sophomore dormitory.
Joan Juckeland, Housing Com
mittee chairman, said the over
abundance of sophomores in La
gunita was caused by the change
in ratio of students in each class
allowed to live in a dormitory.
The change was voted on and
j passed by women students last
I year.
I
Those Worried
Those who arc worrier! about
ihe situation, Miss Juckeland
said, claim the sophomore women
I now in Lagunita are not being
I permitted I lie opportunity to gain
I a well-rounded dormitory atmos
phere . And consequently they do
j not have the desired broad back-
I ground of experiences.
The opposed feel the problem
i will be intensified when it comes
time to choose sponsors. They
claim a sponsor who has never
had the experience of upper-class
men living is not so well qualified
to lead freshmen as one who has.
On I lie other hand, the Housing
; Committee met with Lagunita
Excom- and was informed that
most sophomore girls who are
now living in Lagunita enjoy the
atmosphere of an all-sophomore
dorm. The sophomores feel that
it creates unity among I lie class
and affords an opportunity for
members of the same class to get
to know each other, Miss Jucke
land said.
Postpone Problem
The outcome of Housing Com
mittee's discussions was a deci
sion to put the problem off to a
later date.
Miss Juckeland said this joint
proposal to change the ratio was
almost certain to be defeated.
"Perhaps we can think of an
other solution instead," she said.
