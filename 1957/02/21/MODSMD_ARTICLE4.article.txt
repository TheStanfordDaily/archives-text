# Campus Officials Concerned About SU Grading System
## High Averages, Draft, Inadequate Housing Pose Problems; Stanford Losing Grad Students 
### 
"The question of grades is currently under discussion by Univer
sity officials who arc trying to find a grading system which would
he more equitable to students," said Dean of the Graduate School
William <\ Steerc last night to a large group of students gathered
at the Alpha Tau Omega house to hear another program of the Stan

ford Today and Tomorrow series.
"Due to the high number of
Stanford students who enter the
University with a straight "A"
record from high school, a grade
of "C" here is equivalent to high
er grades in many other schools.
For the benefit of the students we
would like to see professors give
higher grades." continued Steerc.
One factor prompting this dis
cussion of grade consideration is
the draft program regarding col
lege students, wherein men com
pete in grades with men from oth
er universities for the right to
finish school before going into the
service.

The question of grading was
raised in addition to many others
by ATO members and women
from Granada. When asked about
the amount of money available
for granting University scholar
ships and fellowships, Steerc,
chairman of the Financial
Awards Committee, said that the
number of Stanford students re
ceiving financial help from Ihe
University is pathetic.
There is not enough money
available for a substantial awards
program. Only 1.1 per cent of the
undergraduates and 10 per cent
of the graduates have financial
support from the University,

Another question receiving
much interest was one concerning
housing. "Row houses are going
In bo run as long as they are prof

small living group is a good thing
for a residence university.
Stanford is going to lose the
Village in eight years if it doesn't
deteriorate in the mean time.
Houses must be built on campus
for student living. The graduate
school is losing good students
simply because they haven't been
able to find adequate living facili
ties," continued Steere.
