# Eisenhower: United Nations 'Has No Choice'
## Body Must Pressure Israel if She Refuses To Withdraw Troops 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower declared to
night the United Nations "has no
choice" but to exert pressure on
Israel it it refused to withdraw
from Egyptian territory. Other
wise, he said, there "would be dis
aster for us all."
Reporting to the nation on the
"fateful" Middle East crisis, Eis
enhower said the United Nations
also should "deal firmly" with
Egypt if it failed to live up to its
international obligations after an
Israeli withdrawal.
For his part, Eisenhower said
he still hoped Israel would see
that "its best immediate and long
term interests" lie in complying
with UN demands for withdrawal
from the Gaza strip nnd territory
on the Gulf of Aqabn.
He said Israel should place its
trust - "in the resolutions of the
United Nations and in the declara
tion of the United States" that it
will support security guarantees
sought by Israel if it withdraws
its troops.
Would Remove "Block"
He said such action would re
move "a definite block to further
progress" in settling the overall
Middle East problem.
Meantime, Arab diplomats re
ported at UN headquarters in
New York that the President has
sent a new appeal to Israel to
withdraw its forces before sanc
tions are imposed on it. One Arab
diplomat pictured American lead
ers as being confident that Israel
would heed the appeal. U.S.
sources would not confirm the
report.
Eisenhower agreed there must
be "respect for the light of Israel
to national existence and internal
development." But he urged Israel
to withdraw its forces and clear
the way for "serious and creative
tasks" in the area by the UN.
In what amounted to a reply to
Senator William F. Knowland tR-
Calif.) and other criticism of sanc
tions, (he President said it was
wrong to ignore Israel's defiance
of the UN simply because resolu
tions condemning Russia for its
harsh actions in rebellious Hun
gary had not been carried out.
Deplores Rusk Reaction
Eisenhower said that no one
"deplores more than I the fact
that the Soviet Union ignores the
resolutions of the United Na
tions."
But he said there can be "no
equating of a nation like Israel
with that of the Soviet Union."
He said the Israelis, like Ameri
cans, "are imbued with a religious
faith and a sense of moral val
ues." He said such peoples are
expected to make "a contribution
to world order which unhappily
we cannot expect from a nation
controlled by atheistic despots."
