## 
### 
Wondering why you're absolute
ly swamped with extra time?
Well, stop wondering. The circu
lation division of the Stanford Li
brary has found the answer.
The annual survey of loan desk
transactions proves that one can
now get a book 1.07 minutes fast
er than one could in 1955 and .01
minute faster than in 1956. The
average time this year has been
i cut to 4.59 minutes.
Furthermore, it now takes les*
1 time not to get a book. In 195.'> it
I look 12.19 minutes, on the avpt
j ago. to go away empty-handed.
In 1956 this lime was cut to 8.90
and now stands at 8.02 minutes
The survey this year covered
the period of Feb. 4-8 and showed
an increase in transactions at
tempted ( 1278 as compared with
710 in 1955) and in percentage of
books delivered (52 per cent as
compared to 47..'i per cent).
If you're not the believing kind,
you can run your own survey this
week end. The Library will be
open from 8 a.m. lo 4:30 p.m. to
