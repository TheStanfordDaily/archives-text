# The
						Real Publishers

The claim has been advanced many times in
recent weeks that The Daily is a publication
of 'he ASSU and therefore has an obligation
to print what students want to have printed,
and that it lias an equal responsibility to re
spect the wishes of the Legislature and the
student body president as the head publishers.
Bv definition, a publisher is the business
head of a paper or at least represents the con
troll iug interest.
The Daily's expenses during the 1955-56 year
came to $65,000. $45,000, or 69.2 per cent, came
i from advertising: $5,000, or 7.7 per cent, came
directly from the University; $15,000, or only
23.1 per cent, came from the ASSU. The ASSU
at best is merely a minor stockholder in The
Daily.
in any organization, before a stockholder
makes a move to control he must consult the
other stockholders, which in this case would
be the University and the advertisers.
Most publishers have control over the finan
cial situation of their publications. The ASSU
does not. The bylaws state that the University
gives $3 a quarter out of each student's tuition
to the ASSU; 75 cents of this is given to The
Daily.
Tims the University gives the money to The
Daily through the ASSU. It is an automatic
process. The only way the financial setup can
be changed is through a bylaws change, and
any change in the amount of money would
have to be cleared through the University.

We also challenge the claim of publisher by
leaders of student government from sheer ex
perience and newspaper know-how. Publishers
of most papers have worked their way either
through the business or editorial staff of a
paper or bought the paper through their own
Volition and interest.
At Stanford, members of the Daily staff are
the only ones really qualified to judge the
paper or its editor, both from point of experi
ence and point of participation.
Under the proposed amendment change, 5
per cent of the student body plus a few mem
bers of Legislature could remove the Daily
editor. This amounts to a group who contribute
only 1.1 per cent of The Daily's income. We
do not believe such a small group should have
such great power over this publication.
As the representative group of a minority
of stockholders, we think that the Legislature
should be concerned with the cooperation be
tween it and The Daily, but we do not think
it has a moral right to pass any restrictive
legislation.
The student body by a two-thirds recall vote
may remove the Daily editor, according to the
constitution. We approve of this check.
Since the editor does serve only the ASSU,
his responsibility should be toward it, pub
lisher or not. The best way to trust him with
this responsibility is to leave him out of the
threats and control of a few small-interest
groups.
