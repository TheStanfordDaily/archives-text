Student Body Elect Editor
Editor, The Daily:
May I make the following suggestion? Elect the editor, subject
to the conditions that he have two years previous editorial staff work
with The Daily and the same recall checks us are placed on ASSU
officers, by general student vote.
We are told that Legislature wants
• A representative editor
• Student control over policy
• The best paper for the campus
while The Daily wants
• An experienced editor
• Free press
• The best paper for the campus
1 admit that election is not by vote of a large percentage of tho
students.
But the election of the editor is*not now by a large percentage of
the students.
1 admit that Legislature would not have tight rein over the editor.
Hut such rein ought nol to lie with government but with the true
owners, the students, who would have the.same control over their
paper as they have over- their government.
I admit that rival candidates might consider compromising some
of their ideas because of the necessity of election. But an honest
candidate would not do so and in a "dry" year there would l>e no
temptation to do so.
The editor thus selected would be free yet ultimately student
controlled, experienced yet representative, and would conceivably
produce the best paper for the campus.

No Sensitivity Shown
Editor, The Daily:
While your editorial last Thursday brought up the interesting
problem of student body indifference, it showed no sensitivity.
You linked apathy and conformity together as the major part of
student indifference, naming Big Game Bonfire and Back to the
Farm Week as notable manifestations of disappearing tradition. The
truth is that apathy and conformity in this case are not to be linked
together. The person interested only in establishing his own ego is
much less likely to conform than is the person who lives only qua
legislator, committee member, Big Came enthusiast or Charity Drive
chairman.
You seemed surprised that Charity Drive "gimmicks" didn't
"shake the student out of this apparent disinterest in the welfare
of other people in the world." This is an absurdity. The only shak
ing caused by the gimmicks was that of the people who collected
pennies in the rain, and interest was developed only in the welfare
of Dean Winbigler and the Ugly Man.
It seems that the larger number of students are misunderstood
by the student body leaders. And the reason? Despite a grading sys
tem that inflates the worth of being in the top 15 per cent regardless
of whether the material is assimilated or not, we at Stanford are in
telligent. We don't want to be in so many organizations and Big
Games that every minute and every thought and every action are
prescribed. We want to be convinced that our pennies are needed
for something we think is good; we don't care to be persuaded that
it's great fun to make a long line of them on the ground.

Withdrawal to Strengthen
Editor, The Daily:
We, the supporters of the petition and movement originally in
tended to strengthen the structure of the Stanford Political Union
Board, hereby declare that we withdraw our support from the recall
petition which affects the president of the Stanford Political Union.
In the light of developments which have occurred since the pres
entation of said petition, we have seen that because of the unfortu
nate misinterpretation of the petition by several high-ranking stu
dent body officers and by members of the student body, said petition
would not serve the best interests of the Political Union Board.
We feel that our petition was well-intended but has perhaps had
the completely unintended effect of not only weakening the Political
Union but also unfortunately giving the impression that an attempt
has been made to question the character of the incumbent president.
Considering the heavy responsibilities which Everett Kindig has
taken upon himself in assuming the presidency of both the Stanford
Political Union and the Stanford Area Young Republicans, we cer
tainly feel that he has executed the duties of the presidency of the
Stanford Political Union to tiie best of his ability.
An amendment has been sponsored by the Executive Board of
the Political Union which will eliminate all possibility of "interlock
ing directorates," and inasmuch as Everett Kindig has pledged his
complete support to the proposed amendment, we feel that its pas
sage will eliminate the necessity for petitionary action, and further
strengthen the organizational bonds within the Politk-al Union. This
amendment will have no effect upon the status of the present offi
cers, for this would be retroactive, but it is intended to promote the
stability and growth of the Political Union by stipulating that there
shall be no "interlocking directorates" between tiie Political Union
Executive Board and the leadership of any partisan political group.

Keep Daily in Present Form
Editor, The Daily:
We cast two votes for keeping The Daily in substantially its pres
ent form. Information concerning the adventures of Nasser and
the whereabouts of Pappy Waldorf is for us preferable to lineage
devoted to the petty squabbles of a student government and its
eternal committees. * •
As has been pointed out to us on The Daily's editorial page, we
have paid cold cash for our "subscription." We do not care to spend
more cold cash to outside newspapers for the news that interests
us, when both that news, as well as all pertinent news of the campus,
is already available to us.
