How many men on a rugby loam?
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic huu an answer by the time his
Indians annexed an N-0 victory over the Peninsula Ramblers Sat
urday afternoon that might have raised a few eyebrows.
The normal rugby side is 15 men. But by the time Stanford
finally broke a scoreless deadlock with two quick tallies 70 minutes
into the game, the Indians were operating with only 13 men.
The lure of three days on the slopes left Kmetovic with only
18 players suited up at game time.
In the ensuing play, marked by rugged scrum action on a
muddy, shower-swept field, Kmetovic's warriors were whittled
down in a vicious variation of "Ten Liltle Indians" until the game
was called after Stanford's 13th player, Doug Dick, suffered a
broken leg.
First, Dave Scholz, Bob Long and tk?rry Reinhart left the game
with relatively minor injuries and were sent to the showers by
Kmetovic. Then lock Gordy Roberts' leg snapped during loose
scrum action, reducing the Indian team to 1-1 men. Moments later
Ted Tanner hurt his shoulder, and then there were 13.
It was then, with two fewer players than the Ramblers, that
the Indians finally pot on the scoreboard.
With 10 minutes remaining to play, fullback Al Kirkland booted
a 25-yard penally kick. The first time the Indians got their hands
on the ball thereafter, second-five Rick McMillen took his own
pop-kick and rambled 35 yards for the game's only try. Doug Dick
converted.
The game was halted with three minutes remaining when wing
back Dick's leg was broken as he was tackled on the three-yard
line after- a brilliant 40-yard sprint.
The broken legs will keep both Dick and Roberts on the side
line for the remainder of the season.
The loss of Dick robs Stanford of its most experienced back
and its point kicker just as the tough part of the schedule begins.
The Indians meet the Olympic Club and California on the next
two weekends.
