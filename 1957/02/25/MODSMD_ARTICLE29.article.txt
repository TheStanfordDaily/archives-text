Led by guard Gerry Mann, a
somewhat refreshed Be r k e 1 e y

unable to connect from the field,
however, and also unable to break
through S t a n I or d's defensive
press.

ond half, pumping in seven of

Cal.'s 10 field goals for Die half.

Rams can easily be accounted for
at ihe free-throw line.
Unable to Connect

been a fairly close first period
CCSF managed to grab a 36-28

Papoose guard Tipton tied the
game three times in the second
half and even sent his squad into
a one-point, 50-49 lead with seven
minutes to go. This was Stan
ford's only lead of the half, how
ever, and ii was short-lived as
Ram Rich Russell regained the
lead for his squad in the follow
ing seconds with a 20-foot jump
shot.
