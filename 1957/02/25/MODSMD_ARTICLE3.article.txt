### Mary Etta Castello 
The Ballets Basques de Biarritz,
another of the programs present
ed by the ASSIJ Concert Series,
put on a delightful program based
on the folklore of the Basques
Saturday evening in Memorial Au
ditorium.
Among I Ik* best-received num
bers of the performance were the
instrumental numbers done on the
txistu. This is one of the most
famous Basque instruments.
Of ancient origin, it is a three
holed flute of surprisingly wide
range. The txistu player fingers
his instrument with his left hand,
simultaneously beating a small

barrel-drum suspended from hie
left arm.
The costumes of the players
showed a predominance of the red,
green and white of the French.
They augmented the dances and
helped the audience visualize Ihe
dances and songs.
I'as de Basques
The I'as de Basques, a group of
traditional Basque folk dances, in
eluded the Expath Dantza, Erre
hercntzia, Ustai Dantza and Sagar
Dantza, which were done by indi
vidual groups from the troupe.
The Suite Biskayenne, which
concluded the number, was a glor
ification of the chief of the war
riors who died in battle defending
the Basque country. The use of
long swords in this number pre
sented a spectacular finish.
Illunarrara (Twilight) was a
dance sequence in which several
| interesting associations between
I the Basque dance and classical
ballet were evident. The scene at
twilight at the village fountain
provided an excellent background
for the boy and the girl who danr
ed the main roles in this number.
The emotions of the fishing vil
lagers were portrayed in Honda
rean (Drama of the Seal as the
fishing boats were about to leave.
Several sailors stopped to danre.
fn the emotions of waving good
bye, Maile was torn by the de
parture of Koldobika, whom she
loved. Suddenly, as often hap
pens in the Bay of Biscay, the
wind rose and a storm broke.
The battered boats regained
port, but Koldobika had drowned.
His body, carried by his compan
ions, was brought to Maite. who
was crushed by her sorrow. As
was the custom, .mourning women
were assembled to invoke the soul
of the deceased, symbolically en
closed in a crystal urn which the
nearest neighbtfr raised toward
the sky.
Soul Takes Form
For a moment the soul of Kol
dobika took form and danced
around those who were dear to
him. But they took leave, every
thing faded out. and night fell on
the lit I le fishing port.
A group of Basque songs was
presented by a chorus which in
eluded Agur Mariz, Irentetan, Ma
ritxu and Bigarren Kale/Kale.
Xazpiak Bat, a group of songs
and dances from the Basque prov
inccs, vividly showed the folklore
I of the Basques. All these numbers

t worn Hone fo the accompaniment
, of'the txistn and barrel-drum.
The most colorful number was
| the finale. Lekeito showed I ho 1 ifo
in h little fishing villago whore
tho women went from door to
door in the early morning to wake
up the fishermen, who went to
their boats.
The village came to life, hihl the
ktroel cleaners began their duties
in preparing the square for the
festivities which followed the re
turn of the fishermen from the
sCa. During the evening everyone
danced for tho major and the dig
nitaries. Tho scene closed with
vigorous dancing on an Hevated
block in a spectacular climax.
