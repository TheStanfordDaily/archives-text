A modern play and a "literary
cabaret" will be presented in Ger
man here Wednesday and Thurs
day evenings by the German The
ater of Salt Lake City as part of
the group's West Coast tour. Ad
mission is free.
"Der Fischbccker Wandtep
pieh," a play that makes no use
of staging or costumes, and in
which illusion and reality are
fused simply by the resources of
the actors, will be given in Cub
berley Auditorium on Wednesday
at 8 p.m.
It was written by the modern
German poet Manfred Hausmann
for the millennial celebration of
the Fischbeck monastery and re
creates the legend of the monas
tery's founding. The only stage
property is a large tapestry
whose designs and pictures be
come a significant part of the
drama.
The cabaret night is a satirical
commentary on contemporary af
fairs, giving a subtle and humor
ous critique of politics, morals
and human problems. It will be
presented in the Women's Club
house on Thursday at 8.
The Germ a n Theater was
founded by professional actors
who emigrated from their coun
try following World War 11. It is
now supplemented by amateurs
from Salt Lake City. The current
tour has scheduled performances
from Los Angeles to Vancouver.
