# Axe Society, Offshoot of '21', Incorporates More Activities
## 
### 
Axe Society, an offshoot of the
"Immortal 21," is one of the sel
dom - defined campus organiza
tions. Its basic duty originally
was handling the Axe .receiving
it from and, more often .return
ing it to Cal. Since its organiza
tion, however, Axe Society has in
corporated many other activities.
This autumn, Axe Society
worked on alumni reunions dur
ing football season, serving
lunches, transporting alums to
games and generally helping in
planning these activities.
Axe Society was responsible
for selling and advertising life
memberships in the Alumni Asso
ciation.during its recent member
ship drive. They issued all-cam
pus telephone cards and will re
peat this service in May.
During the year they have es
tablished a message and transpor
tation service for visiting dignita
ries through the assistance of the
general secretary of the Univer
sity.
One of the more important
services of Axe Society concerns
students who are not yet at Stan
ford. Axe Society members meet
prospective freshmen who are
visiting the campus and escort
them, their parents and their
friends to the Admissions Office,
dean's office and Office of the
Registrar. This year they assisted
in the planning and running of
high school day.
For the second time, Axe So
ciety will publish its Activities

Handbook, which will be sent to
freshmen before they arrive at
Stanford. And, if Lake Lag ever
fills, they plan to put on a water
show with the junior class.
Axe Society is now carrying the
documents for the Model United
Nations Conference (known as
the Official Pouch) and will han
dle the annual Stanford Alumni
Conference in May.
Axe Society serves as a liaison
between the alumni and the cam
pus but they may be called on by
students or the University to per
form any service. In 1954, before
there was an election board, they
held the campus elections.
Every winter quarter, the inter
view committee of Axe Society
holds tryouts for new members
for its ever-broadening organiza
tion. They draw their members
from every class and living
group.
This year Axe Society inter
view committee, composed of
Chuck White, Glenn Bell and Sue
Rood, will hold interviews tomor
row and Wednesday. Sign -up
sheets will be posted in the ASSII
office Monday.
