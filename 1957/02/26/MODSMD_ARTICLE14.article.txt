SUNNYVALE, Feft. 25 (UP) â€”
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to
day confirmed tentative plans to
build an underground atomic test
ing facility near a Palo Alto resi
dential area, but said construction
would not begin for at least a
year.
'In Washington today the Atom
ic Energy Commission said it
planned to permit construction of
the facility, subject to full assur
ances that there would be no risk
to public health and safety.)
A Lockheed spokesman said the
firm's missile systems division
planned to build the so-called
"critical experiments facility" on
a 22-acre site leased from Stan
ford University. The plot is two
miles southeast of the University
and about 500 feet from the near
est residences.
However, Lockheed said the
plan had been shelved by the De
partment of Defense for at least
the rest of this year.
The company said the structure
would be a "leak-tight," quake
proof underground building oper
ated from a control room 40 feet
away.
Lockheed plans to use the fa
cility tor testing atomic reactor
fuel cores of various composition.
The chain reactions will he main
tained at or near zero power and
are expected to emit little radi
ation.
(University Business Manager
All Brandin said tonight he had
heard nothing of the proposed
testing facility. All building plans
have to be approved by the land
development office, he said.
(Brandin said it is possible the
plan may be in his office for con
sideration. He said he has been in
Los Angeles the past few days.)
