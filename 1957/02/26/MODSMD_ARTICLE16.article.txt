Four students from Israel gave an exhibition of their native music

Dressed in local costumes, the quartet presented examples of the

folk music and dances of the
many sects that make up the Is

these were not just antique cus
toms long fallen out of use, but
rather current traditions of the
modern Israel.
The four entertainers are first
generation Israelis who are now
studying at UCLA. They have
presented their pageant frequent
ly in the Los Angeles area and
were recently asked by the Na
tional Students Association to
make a tour of West Coast col
leges as part of a program to ac
quaint Americans with many oth
er cultures
Emanuel Gat', president of the
Israeli Associations on American
campuses, narrated the show as
Josef Zaphir and his wife Maya
danced, Jacob Shechter provided
music on his accordion and Maya
sang.
Varied Nationalities
Gat stressed the many different
nationalities that are present in
Israel after a tremendous immi
gration which more than doubled
the population of the country in
five years. Shechter played songs
representative of the Hebrew, Ye
menite and many Polish and Rus
sian peonies.
The highlight oi the program
was when Mrs Zaphir led the au
dience in two Israeli songs, she
singing the verses and the spec
tators joining in for teh chorus.
The program also included a
few duets by Mrs. Zaphir and
Shechter and a variety of dances
from the many sections of Israel
from Galilee to the Ncgev.
"Pressure Cooker"
In the course of his narration
between the musical exhibitions
Gat laid particular emphasis on
the modern developments in Is
rael. He told of the search for oil
and water in the Negev Desert
and that water was deemed more
valuable
He spoke of the overwhelming
problems facing farmers because
of deficient rainfall and the diffi
culty in irrigation. He noted the
sharp contrast between the new
and old sections of Jerusalem and
the "pressure cooker" (rather
| than melting pot) character of Is
rael.

developments yesterday afternoon in Cubberley Auditorium before

rather current traditions of the
modern Israel.
