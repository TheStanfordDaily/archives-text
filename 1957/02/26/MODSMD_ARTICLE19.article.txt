# Israel Parliament Backs Ben-Gurion's Demand
## Won't Withdraw Until Guarantees Are Satisfactory 
### 
JERUSALEM, Israel, Feb. 25
(UP)—The Israeli Knesset (par
liament) tonight overwhelmingly
approved Premier David Ben-Gu
rion's rejection of demands that
Israel withdraw its forces from
Egypt without guarantees.
The vote was 72 to 29.
The vote came after a day in
which Ben-Gurion held two ur
gent cabinet meetings and then
addressed parliament again.
In his speech today, the pre
mier said the threat of United Na
tions sanctions should not prevent
Israel from pursuing its "basic
demands" for guarantees before
withdrawing troops from the
Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba
area.
Hard to Boar
"On the other hand," he said,
"we must be aware that sanctions
would not be easy to bear."
He said Israel can on no ac
count allow the Egyptian army or
civil administration to return to
the Gaza Strip.
Referring to proposals made by
Canada's Lester Pearson. Ben-Gu
rion said that "there is one state
sincerely seeking a solution which
has suggested sending a UN in
vestigating committee to the
Gaza Strip to discuss terms for
its future.
"I do not know if such a com
mission will be sent," he said. "If
it comes, we cannot possibly close
the door on it."
Always Beady to Talk
He said Israel must always be
ready to talk with anyone honest
ly seeking a solution to the prob
lems of the Gaza Strip.
Ben-Gurion said Israel's clear
est guarantee to free passage in
the Gulf of Aqaba is the Israeli
navy.
"If our ships are attacked in
the gulf," he said, "we will reply "
Tonight's vote was on a coab
tion resolution endorsing the
stand Ben-Gui'ion outlined in a
speech to parliament last Thurs
day. Opposition resolutions were
overwhelmingly defeated.
In his speech today, Ben Gurion
stated Israel's basic conditions
for withdrawing from the Sharrn
el Sheik region of Egypt border
ing the gulf.
These, he said, were "stationing
United Nations troops along the
gulf coast until a settlement with
Egypt is reached, or there is
agreement between the coastal
states" on freedom of navigation.
Meanwhile, the following de
velopments broke over the tense
Middle East situation:
• LONDON — Britain an
nounces opposition to sanctions
against Israel, says United Na
tions must settle Gaza Strip and
Aqaba Gulf disputes.
• JERUSALEM — Israeli par
