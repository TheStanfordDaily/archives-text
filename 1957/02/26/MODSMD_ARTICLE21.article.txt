# Unconstitutional Amendment
## 
### 
The proposed legislative amendment concern
ing the recall of the Daily editor is not only
wrong in principle, it is unconstitutional.
The ASSU Constitution states in Article V,
Section 2: "Except as otherwise provided in
this Constitution, all elected or appointed offi
cers provided for in this Constitution may be
removed for a -stated cause at a special election
which may be called either by a two-thirds vote
of '.he Legislature or by petition of five per cent
of the members of this Association. Two-thirds
of the total votes cast shall he necessary for
removal."
The proposed bylaw would change the recall
process as set forth in the constitution. A bvlaw
by definition is a secondary law. When a funda
mental law exists, a secondary law mav 1101 take
precedence.
In this case the proposed bylaw would take
precedence over a procedure already set up in
the constitution, and therefore is unconstitu
tional and should be declared void on legal
grounds.
It may he argued by some that the Dailv

editor is not ail elective or appointed officer
provided for in the constitulion; we Kay he is.
The editor of The Daily is "elected or ap
pointed" in the full sense of the words. He
holds his office as an ex-officio member on ASSU
Cabinet and ASSI Legislature hv virtue of his
bona fide election by members of the Daily staff
and approval of such election by the ASSU!
I legislature.
The constitution in no other part but Article |
V, Section 2, provides for the removal of
the Daily editor. The provision giving power
to ASSU Legislature to "make, amend or re
peal bylaws is a provision for the purpose of
c reating secondary law, not for the purpose of
creating constitutional or fundamental law.
By a straight three-quarters vote Legislature
may now expel the Daily editor from Legis
lature, hut it cannot remove him from the office
of I )ai ly editor.
Therefore the proposed amendment has little
business even coming up before Legislature,
as it is contrary to the letter as well as the spirit
of the ASSI I constitution.
