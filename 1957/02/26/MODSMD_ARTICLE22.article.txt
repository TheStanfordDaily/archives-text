# Publicity or News?
## 
### 
Much of THE BASIS for Legislature's eurreni
attempts to exert a measure of control over
't he Daily may he attributed to dissatisfaction
With The Daily's local news coverage.
\V »■ have stated several times in recent weeks
that we must admit to defects in this area.
However, we wish to emphasize that The Daily
is not a publicity organ. Publicity is news once,
possibly twice —usually depending on the num
ber of people affected. The Daily is a news
paper, committed by ethics to print news.
Activities on campus are news. They are not
news for weeks before they occur. Our tiews
play is determined by importance to whom
and when it is important. National news often
takes precedence over campus news because it
is more newsworthy than a particular day's
campus activities.
Reporters are assigned beats. They bring the
results of their interviews to the managing
editor's desk. Once reported, they are recorded
and assigned at the time the activity is to occur.
Often people bring news to us. For this we
are extremely grateful. Our door is open from
8 a.m. to midnight. Anyone who has news and
has not been contacted for it is more than wel
come to come in and tell us.
If thus far in the information's path to news
errors occur, it is often the fault of the Daily
staff. We are students, not professional jour

nalists. Our time is volunteered because we
wish to learn the newspaper business. We can
not guarantee complete accuracy on our part -
too many of us are half-trained, foo many of us
are limited in time.
However, once the story is assigned to a re
porter ami written, still other factors must he
considered. One day there is little local news;
another day there may be twice as much news
as we can print. One day our ads may run
high; another day they may run low. One flay
a world crisis situation may arise; another day
the world news scene may be nil. In short, the
situation varies from day to day. We cannot
guarantee when news will run or where it will
be placed, because we cannot control the flow
of news —national or local.
I he daily decisions on what news will run !
where are left to the discretion of the night j
editor for the current issue. Night editors, too,
are vulnerable and able to make mistakes. But
they cannot learn good judgment without first
making some errors.
This, then, is a brief outline of the difficulties '•
we face in printing the news. And printing the !
news is our job. In an attempt to improve our,
work, we will hold a meeting Thursday night!
at 7:30 for all publicity chairmen and organi
zation presidents. It is hoped that such a meet
ing will improve the co-ordination and flow of
news to and from The Daily.

as we can print. One day our ads may run
high; another day they may run low. One flay
a world crisis situation may arise; another day
the world news scene may be nil. In short, the
situation varies from day to day. We cannot
guarantee when news will run or where it will
be placed, because we cannot control the flow
of news —national or local.
I he daily decisions on what news will run !
where are left to the discretion of the night j
editor for the current issue. Night editors, too,
are vulnerable and able to make mistakes. But
they cannot learn good judgment without first
making some errors.
This, then, is a brief outline of the difficulties '•
we face in printing the news. And printing the !
news is our job. In an attempt to improve our,
work, we will hold a meeting Thursday night!
at 7:30 for all publicity chairmen and organi
zation presidents. It is hoped that such a meet
ing will improve the co-ordination and flow of
news to and from The Daily.
Much of THE BASIS for Legislature's eurreni
attempts to exert a measure of control over
't he Daily may he attributed to dissatisfaction
With The Daily's local news coverage.
\V »■ have stated several times in recent weeks
that we must admit to defects in this area.
However, we wish to emphasize that The Daily
is not a publicity organ. Publicity is news once,
possibly twice —usually depending on the num
ber of people affected. The Daily is a news
paper, committed by ethics to print news.
Activities on campus are news. They are not
news for weeks before they occur. Our tiews
play is determined by importance to whom
and when it is important. National news often
takes precedence over campus news because it
is more newsworthy than a particular day's
campus activities.
Reporters are assigned beats. They bring the
results of their interviews to the managing
editor's desk. Once reported, they are recorded
and assigned at the time the activity is to occur.
Often people bring news to us. For this we
are extremely grateful. Our door is open from
8 a.m. to midnight. Anyone who has news and
has not been contacted for it is more than wel
come to come in and tell us.
If thus far in the information's path to news
errors occur, it is often the fault of the Daily
staff. We are students, not professional jour

nalists. Our time is volunteered because we
wish to learn the newspaper business. We can
not guarantee complete accuracy on our part -
too many of us are half-trained, foo many of us
are limited in time.
However, once the story is assigned to a re
porter ami written, still other factors must he
considered. One day there is little local news;
another day there may be twice as much news
as we can print. One day our ads may run
high; another day they may run low. One flay
a world crisis situation may arise; another day
the world news scene may be nil. In short, the
