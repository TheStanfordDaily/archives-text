## Daily Cal Comments on Press Squabbles 
### Dave Canfield 
Daily Californian Editor Jim Lemert recently
criticized the stand of The Stanford Daily in ihe
control-of-Daily-by-Legislature controversy.
Lemert, who worked tinder Daily Editor Dave
Scott when Scott was editor of the Chico High
School newspaper, said, "The mere approval of
the editor by the president or by the student leg
islature does not necessarily constitute an abridg
ment of freedom of the press. The possibility of
injury to the press arises, however, when a slate
of three choices is forced.
. . We wager that the Daily Californian is
as free as any newspaper can be. Yet the editor
ami all his staff are appointed by Executive
committee. But the Daily Californian and Publi
cations board first choose one <11 person for each
position. Things being as they are, the appoint
ments are seldom seriously questioned by Fix
com.
"If sentiment destines that the Daily is to be
toppled from its pinnacle of self-maintained re
sponsibility, 'tis better to gracefully lose a Jitlle,
very little, than to fight an unnecessary and pos
sibly mortal fight over press freedom.
"But if the Daily continues lo blast away on
an all-or-nothing basis, it could get nothing, and
that would be a tragedy."

Battles between student publications and ad
ministrations also raged at the University of Chi
cago and at the University of Washington.

The Chicago student newspaper, the Maroon,
was raided and the "gag" edition of the news
paper seized by campus police under university
administrative direction.
According to the Maroon, the administration
charged that the issue was "lewd and slander
ous." Daily Californian editor Lemert sided
against the publication side in this controversy
also.
As Lemert said, "Freedom in our society is
predicated on responsibility. Too often do editors
especially student editors damn, by waving
the alabaster banner of the fourth amendment,
those who would remind them of their responsi
bility."

At Washington, the campus humor magazine
Columns is under fire because of alleged "vul
garity" in the February issue. In recent battles
with the powers that be, though, Columns seems
to have won minor victories.
On successive days, Organizations Assembly,
a student governing body, gave Columns a vote
of confidence and Board of Control, another stu
dent governing body, tabled a motion to disband
the magazine.
However, Board of Control's verdict was not
quite so favorable. "The Publications Committee
does not believe the magazine can continue under
existing conditions," Committee chairman Bob
Harris said in his report to the Board. "We feel
Hiat we should create a substitute."
