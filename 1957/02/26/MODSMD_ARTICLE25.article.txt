Kick in the Backside
Editor, The Daily:
The current attempts of expansion on the part
ot the ASSU student Legislature have evoked
many responses from your readers. We were
disappointed, however, to see you and your sup
porters satisfied with merely defending The
Daily from encroachment by the student bu
reaucracy. Rapping the knuckles of this group
is not sufficient; a good kick in the backside is
more in order.
It appears that the Legislature's claims to the
l ight of being the campus conscience are based
on the absurd assumption that it actually repre
sents the interests of our student body, eight
thousand strong.
For many of us student government has been
a concept imposed on us since our earliest fresh
man days and which we are periodically brow
beaten to support. We did not come to Stanford
to be "represented" and we resent being the
tool whereby members of the Legislature can ex
pand their power and prestige. We can assure
you that studies, automobiles and women occupy
far more concern than any convulsion of student
government, a symbol of American democracy at
one of its lower ebbs.
It is argued that our student government
serves some important functions. Among them
we find it provides offices to which persons may
be elected and, in general, provides experience
for little bureaucrats learning how to become
big ones. As long as this can be afforded with
out hampering useful student organizations, we
have no objections.
Foremost among organizations useful to the
entire University is the staff of The Stanford
Daily. The least to which this group should be
entitled is the right to continue running the
paper and electing their officers as they see fit.
We have far more confidence in their judgment
derived from much hard work and experience

than in the whims and ambitions of a few indi
viduals who think they have already attained the
rank of Big Bureaucrat.
There is one authority to which all campus
organizations are already subject; it is not the
"students' representatives," but rather the Stan i
ford administration under whose guidance we 1
have been admitted to Stanford, assumedly for
the purpose of higher learning.

Appreciation Expressed
Editor, The Daily:
May I, through the columns of your Daily,
express my appreciation to all the students ami j
friends who were responsible for and those who ;
participated in the celebration of my thirtieth
anniversary in the ASSU office. (Please let us
forget tlie number of years thenceforth.)
1 was surprised that there should have been j
any more than a passing notice of the anniver
sary but when I saw the size and magnitude of
the celebration that the student body officers i
produced, 1 was nonplused. In fact, 1 still haven't
recovered my breath. You know, it isn't hard to
do something that you love doing and it would
amaze you how quickly thirty years can pass.
My thanks to Stanford for the privilege and
opportunity of working with students, who, in
my opinion, are unequaled anywhere. And my j
thanks to students, past and present, who have 1
made my years at Stanford such happy and mem- ;
orable ones. I shall read and reread your cards
and messages that fill my two scrapbooks many,
many times. Please remember, the ASSU office!
is the official "check-in" place whenever you are
back on a visit or just passing through alter
graduation.

Appreciation Expressed
Editor, The Daily:
May I, through the columns of your Daily,
express my appreciation to all the students ami j
friends who were responsible for and those who ;
participated in the celebration of my thirtieth
anniversary in the ASSU office. (Please let us
forget tlie number of years thenceforth.)
1 was surprised that there should have been j
any more than a passing notice of the anniver
sary but when I saw the size and magnitude of
the celebration that the student body officers i
produced, 1 was nonplused. In fact, 1 still haven't
recovered my breath. You know, it isn't hard to
do something that you love doing and it would
amaze you how quickly thirty years can pass.
My thanks to Stanford for the privilege and
opportunity of working with students, who, in
my opinion, are unequaled anywhere. And my j
thanks to students, past and present, who have 1
made my years at Stanford such happy and mem- ;
orable ones. I shall read and reread your cards
and messages that fill my two scrapbooks many,
many times. Please remember, the ASSU office!
is the official "check-in" place whenever you are
back on a visit or just passing through alter
graduation.

Kick in the Backside
Editor, The Daily:
The current attempts of expansion on the part
ot the ASSU student Legislature have evoked
many responses from your readers. We were
disappointed, however, to see you and your sup
porters satisfied with merely defending The
Daily from encroachment by the student bu
reaucracy. Rapping the knuckles of this group
is not sufficient; a good kick in the backside is
more in order.
It appears that the Legislature's claims to the
l ight of being the campus conscience are based
on the absurd assumption that it actually repre
sents the interests of our student body, eight
thousand strong.
For many of us student government has been
a concept imposed on us since our earliest fresh
man days and which we are periodically brow
beaten to support. We did not come to Stanford
to be "represented" and we resent being the
tool whereby members of the Legislature can ex
pand their power and prestige. We can assure
you that studies, automobiles and women occupy
far more concern than any convulsion of student
government, a symbol of American democracy at
one of its lower ebbs.
It is argued that our student government
serves some important functions. Among them
we find it provides offices to which persons may
be elected and, in general, provides experience
for little bureaucrats learning how to become
big ones. As long as this can be afforded with
out hampering useful student organizations, we
have no objections.
Foremost among organizations useful to the
entire University is the staff of The Stanford
Daily. The least to which this group should be
entitled is the right to continue running the
paper and electing their officers as they see fit.
We have far more confidence in their judgment
derived from much hard work and experience

than in the whims and ambitions of a few indi
viduals who think they have already attained the
rank of Big Bureaucrat.

organizations are already subject; it is not the
