# The
						Point After

They've turned out the lights in Heartbreak Hotel and perhaps
it's just as well.
But if they don't want the Pavilion pipes to freeze over theyVl
beiier not turn off the heat, for the Stanford basket ball team's final
home game was a mighty cold exit. They were outplayed, outhustled,
outguessed and most important of all they were outfought.
The last half (if Saturday's "contest" looked like a ridiculous mis
match between some hand-picked All American quintet and a high
school five. USC looked like an unbeatable team. It's not.
In season play the Trojans were 11-9 prior lo the Stanford series.
Last weekend USC split against lowly Washington State. After the
contests Coach Forrest Twogood said, "We played our he; t basket
ball of the season at Pullman."
In other PCC play the Trojans lost two close ones to Washington
and split with Oregon State. They dumped Idaho twice in Los Ange
les and one of the games was a squeaker.
This season the Cards faced more experienced teams better teams,
taller teams. In fact the Indians usually trailed their opponents in
every department that counts in basketball except one heart. They
won games they should have lost simply because they wouldn't quit.
And they lost many close heart breakers.
But the close ones that got away were heartbreaking losses only
because the Cards never gave up. Thy fought uphill against superior
odds on determination alone. And it was heartbreaking to see ihem
come so close and yet lose.
The Oregon State and Washington series were good examples.
In each series the Cards won a game because they refused to lie
down in the face of superior odds. In each series they suffered a
heartbreaking loss.
But the game that really christened Heartbreak Hotel was the
second Cal game. The Bears had experience, height, ability and a
15-point victory over Stanford. Cal should have won easily. Instead
they were forced into overtime.
The game was billed as a revenge affair. That was a misnomer.
Jt should have been labeled "Bank Night" or some other appropriate
give-away title.
The Cards gave Cal easy lay-ups, they threw the ball away, they
blew easy shots. And yet they almost pulled the biggest upset of the
season because they wouldn't quit.
Somehow they managed a two-point lead with just 10 seconds
remaining. Isaacs and Robinson stopped the clock with a jump ball
on Cal's end of the floor. A Card victory seemed certain.
But instead of sitting Wagner in the hoop and placing the other
three men on their foul line and forcing Cal into taking at least a
2<)-loot shot, ihe Indians played the jump ball as if they were trailing
by two points and needed the ball to win.
The rest is history. The Bears controlled the jump and Friend
raced down court for an easy lay-in that tied the game and set'up
Cal's overtime win.
Fvery Card fan on the Hotel register was heartbroken that night.
Yet every Card fan was proud of his team. They had been beaten
by a better team, but they hadn't been outfought. It was a heart
breaking loss.
On the other hand Saturday night's loss against SC was just plain
pathetic. And unless the Cards snap out of it little Idaho is going
to knock them down for the count.
Yes, they've turned th»- lights out in Heartbreak Hotel and per
haps it's just as well.

Danny Rogers turned in the finest two-game performance I've
seen this season. The 6-1 Trojan captain dunked 53 points over the
weekend and his dazzling floor play completely bewildered the Card
ilefen.se. L'ven when Stanford double-teamed him he was unstop
pable.

A Trojan press release issued last Thursday only goes to show
you That you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Since ii might be
good lor a morbid laugh I'll quote from it:
"(Danny) Kogers, suffering from a boil on bis leg, mid (Monte)
Gonzales, limping from an ankle sprain, migld not s«*e much ac
tion."
No, they didn't see much action. No more than a healthy Bob
Cousy and Bill Sharman would see for the Boston Celtics in a chnm
pionship playoff game.
