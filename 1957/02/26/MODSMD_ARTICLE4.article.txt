# Stanford Quad Hit for $300; No Clues Yet
## Cash Boxes, Checks Found in Road; Keys Used to Gain Entrance 
### 
The Quad orfice was broken
into Saturday night or Sunday
morning and robbed of $300 in
fash and checks, making the third
robbery of Quad property this
school year.
The money was in three cash
boxes locked in a drawer of a
filing cabinet. There was no evi
dence of forcible entry into either
the filing cabinet or the Quad of
fice itself, indicating that the bur
glar probably had keys.
Cash boxes and the checks were
found discarded yesterday by a
gardener from the Corporation
Yard on Willow Road near the
Convalescent Home. The Santa
Clara County sheriff's office has
taken over the case and has man
aged to get some fingerprints, but
as yet it has announced no sus
peets.
The Quad had no insurance cov
erage on the stolen money. Also
taken with the money were the
slips indicating payment for year
books, so the business staff is cur
rently checking back on orders
and payments received.
The two earlier robberies involv
ed camerasâ€”one robbery just two
weeks ago. The second camera
was not in operating condition
when it was stolen, and as yet no
evidence has turned up on the
thief.
Both of these items were cov
ered by insurance, and the Quad
has already received payment for
the first theft.
