That's what Alfred T!. Morris says
about the Hell System. "Ami that's the
way 1 like it," he adds. "Right now
I'm in a job 1 didn't think I'd have for
ten or fifteen years."
The job A1 thought was more than
a decade away is Plant Superintendent
for the Hutchinson district in Kansas
with Southwestern Bell. "You can sum
up my work by saying I'm responsible
for the installation and maintenance of
all telephone equipment in a large part
of central Kansas,"' A1 says. "In times
of emergency —a tornado, for instance—
1 have complete charge of maintaining
and restoring service."'
Here's how Al describes the steps that
led up to his present job: "I started out

in Bell's management training program
in 1951. This gave me an excellent
opportunity to learn about all jobs in
the company—not just the job I'd be
doing. The program was well organ
ized, and 1 got a lot out of it.
"My first assignment was to coordi
nate a dial conversion in La Crosse,
Kansas, a quarter-million-dollar opera
tion. My next assignments were in
Abilene and Lawrence, lloth carried in
creased responsibility.
"1 knew 1 was moving along pretty
fast—hut 1 was really surprised when
my present job came up. It bears out
what my wife and 1 thought when 1
joined Bell—there would be
chances fur advancement."
