# SALT LAKE CITY TROUPE
## German Literary Cabaret, Drama to Begin Tomorrow 
### 
"Der Fischbecker Wandtep
pich," a play by I he German poet
Manfred Bailsman, and a literary
cabaret will be presented by the
German Theater of Salt Lake
City tomorrow and Thursday un
der the auspices of the Germanic
and Romanic Languages Depart
ment.
The play, which will be given
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium, was written to com
memorate the millennium of the
founding of tlie Fischbeck moans-
I tery on the Weser River in north
ern Germany. II emerges from
! the contemplation by the actors
of the significance they see in
: certain pictures on a tapestry.
This theme weaves itself into the
play so that the end effect is one
of heightened intensity.
Since the play shows the actors
merely coming to a rehearsal, it
makes no use of staging or cos
tumes, and thus relies entirely on
the spoken word to convey its
meaning. Knowledge of the Ger
man language is essential for un
derstanding of the play.
The cabaret evening, which will

be given on Thursday at S p.m.
in the upper lounge of the Worn
en's Clubhouse, will be fashioned
after the literary cabarets whieh
flourish in the larger cities of Eu
rope, especially in Ger ma ny
where they reached a high degree
of cultivation in the twenties,
only to die under the hand of the
Nazi censor.
This presentation will be much
like the "Kommodchen" in Dus
seldorf, some of the numbers be
ing original texts from this caba
ret.
In general, cabarets address
themselves to a well-read, alert,
intellectual audience which would
appreciate a subtle critique of
contemporary life, ranging from
politics to customs. Since the pur
pose of the entertainment is to
entertain, humor plays a large
part in it.
The third play in their reper
toire, which will not be shown at
Stanford, is "Elektra," by Gerhart
Hauptman.
There will be no admission
charge for the play and the caba
ret.

in the upper lounge of the Worn
en's Clubhouse, will be fashioned
after the literary cabarets whieh
flourish in the larger cities of Eu
rope, especially in Ger ma ny
where they reached a high degree
of cultivation in the twenties,
only to die under the hand of the
Nazi censor.
This presentation will be much
like the "Kommodchen" in Dus
seldorf, some of the numbers be
ing original texts from this caba
ret.
In general, cabarets address
themselves to a well-read, alert,
intellectual audience which would
appreciate a subtle critique of
contemporary life, ranging from
politics to customs. Since the pur
pose of the entertainment is to
entertain, humor plays a large
part in it.
The third play in their reper
toire, which will not be shown at
Stanford, is "Elektra," by Gerhart
Hauptman.
There will be no admission
charge for the play and the caba
ret.
