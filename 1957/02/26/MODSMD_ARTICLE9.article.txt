President Wallace Sterling said
at a Los Angeles alumni confer
ence last weekend that because
of higher enrollment standards it's
becoming much harder to be a
Stanford freshman.
Two principal factors cause
these higher standards, he said.
They are the increasing number
of applicants and the demand for
quality as more students pursue
graduate work.
"What this country needs is
more of what Herbert Hoover has
called the 'uncommon man.' " he
said, "the man who becomes the
leader in thought and accomplish
ment."
