"I wish that I could personally discuss my summer in Europe in I 9!5j, led
by Mrs. |amcs T. Watkins, with everyone considering the advisability and
feasibility of such a trip. My experiences that summer have made this last
year that I have been abroad much more meaningful. Europe was familiar
when I returned; the Stanford tour scratched enough of the surface and
gave such an excellent over-all picture of Europe that it was easy to decide
to which country I wished to return; and, with the strangeness gone, travel
over here the second time is much more efficient and enjoyable."
