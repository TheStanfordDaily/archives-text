# Japan's Education Subject Of Tokyo Professor's Talk
## Old System Aimed at Obedience, Says Ukai; New Teaches initiative 
### 
The changing educational system in post-war Japan was discussed
in a weekly meeting sponsored by Jhe Keio Affiliation Committee
yesterday noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. Nobushige Ukai, visiting professor of law and political science
from Tokyo University, led the discussion.

Prewar education in Japan was
a highly centralized organization,
Ukai explained, with all methods,
textbooks and regulations issued
by the emperor. The result of
this system was one of extremely
high literacy, 90' to 99 per cent,
for the Japanese people. However,
"essentialism," the policy requir
ing all students to study English,
mathematics, Japanese and Chi
nese, was enforced.
lliffh Literacy
This accounted for the high
percentage of literacy, Ukai said,
but all this did was to teach stu
dents how lo read, giving them
no .judgment of their own. The
object was to enable the people
to understand the orders of the
emperor.
The former system of obliga
tion to the emperor and his bu
reaucrats is now being replaced
by loyalty to society and indi
viduals as a result of American
occupation. Instead of orders is
suing from a centralized govern
ment, the institutions themselves
will make their own policies.
"Social Studies"
The American "social studies"
program is being initiated in the
high schools. This course includes
history, geography .and ethics.
Dr. Ukai pointed out that "the
educational reform has succeeded
to a certain extent in fundamen
tal points, but it also poses some
problems that should be reme
died by the Japanese themselves.
"The problem today tends to be
one mainly of decentralization.
We are now giving them fthe
Japanese people] the fundamen
tals of democratic society," he
concluded.'
