# U.S. Plans To Ask UN Control in Middle-East
## Measure Omits Sanctions Against Israel; Clause to Carry Threat 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Feb. 26 (UP)—The United States plans
to call for United Nations control of the Gaza' and Aqaba strips to
morrow in a General Assembly resolution that omits any call for im
mediate sanctions against Israel, American sources said tonight.
U.S. Ambasador Henry Cabot Lodge hoped to put the measure

before the Assembly tomorrow
morning. Still to be worked out
was the sponsorship of the meas
ure, but informed sources said
India, Canada, Brazil and Colom
bia were expected to join the U.S.
in moving it before the 80-nation
Assembly.
Diplomats were working to
night on a clause which would
carry a threat of sanctions
against Israel if it refuses to get
its troops out of Egypt. But
qualified sources said the meas
ure would not carry a provision
for automatic sanctions but
would probably declare that the
Assembly would take up the issue
of disciplinary measures in event
of an Israel refusal.
Middle Way
American sources said the reso
lution will represent a "middle
way" between "utterly ineffi
cient" measures that have been
suggested and the stringent eco
nomic sanctions demanded by six
members of the Afro-Asian bloc.
Secretary - General Dag Ham
marskjold, in a new report to the
General Assembly released to
night, emphasized that there can
be no departure from the terms
of the 1949 armistice agreement
in settling the Israeli • Egyptian
impasse concerning the Gaza
Strip.
He reported that Israeli Ambas
sador Abba S. Eban, in conversa
tions with him Monday, had
raised the point that Israel will
not agree to "the direct or indi
rect return of Egypt to Gaza."
"Egypt, is given the right to
control the Gaza Strip by the ar
mistice agreement," Hammar
skjold replied. "This being bind
ing on the Secretariat, the Secre
tary • General's concentration has
been on arrangements to secure
peace and quiet in the area—al
ways on the assumption of the
Egyptian legal position."
Four-Point Plan
The American sources said the
U.S. resolution would follow the
lines of a four-point program for
breaking the Middle East dead
lock put before the Assembly—
but not in resolution form—by
Canadian Affairs Minis
ter Lester B. Pearson today. Pear
son proposed:
• A firm pledge by Israel and
Egypt scrupulously to observe all
terms of their 1949 armistice
agreement, which would outlaw
any form of aggressive or bellig
erent acts, among other things.
• Deployment of the UN emer
gency force on both sides of the
1949 armistice demarcation line.
• Dispatch of UNEF to the
Gulf of Aqaba to maintain quiet,
prevent conflict and provide a
guarantee against interference
with "innocent passage" for Isra
eli-bound shipping or the exercise
of belligerent rights in that stra
tegic waterway.
• Withdrawal of Israeli mili
tary and civilian administration
from the Gaza Strip—which be
longs neither to Israel nor Egypt
—with UNEF taking over and
Hammarskjold appointing a UN
commissioner to remain in the
Gaza Strip.
Egyptian sources here indicated
that President Gamal Abdel Nas
ser's government would accept
only the first point of the Pear
son plan: the insistence on scru
pulous observance of the armi
stice agreement which rules out
acts of belligerency.
