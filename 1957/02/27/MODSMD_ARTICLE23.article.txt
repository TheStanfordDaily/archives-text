# Two Amendments
## 
### 
Legislature tonight considers two changes in
the Publications Board standing rules. One
would lead to more cooperation and responsi
bility by The Daily; the other could lead to
domination of the Daily editor by a very small
group.
In its meeting two weeks ago Publications
Board proposed an amendment to its standing
rules which would bring complaints and criti
cisms regarding The Daily before it as a body.
The hoard then could make recommendations
to The Daily regarding these complaints.
The Daily is solidly behind this amendment;
(lie editor voted lor it when it was proposed.
hi the past, complaints and criticisms regard
in}/; The Daily coming to ASSU offices have
never reached the Daily editor. He has heard
that they do exist, but no details have ever
been given. Now, under the proposal, the Daily
editor, as a member of the Publications Board,
would hear the specific complaints'and would
have an opportunity to rectify the valid ones.
This is definitely in keeping with a spirit of
cooperation without enforced legislation.
The other amendment before the Legislature
tonight is a violation of this spirit.
This amendment would make it possible for
415 people—l.l per cent of The Daily's finan
cial contributors—to be able to remove the
editor of The Daily by a process of petition
of "> per cent of the student body and a three
quarters vote of Legislature.
We are afraid that this would lead to domi
nation of the Daily editor by a few organiza
tions on campus wanting bigger news play and

by an editorially harassed Legislature. The
feeling of freedom would be gone.
The amendment would also make ihe staff
election of the Daily editor subject to approval
of a majority of Legislature. At present Legis
lature has to approve the election process only.
The amendment would make the Legislature
able to disapprove the new editor by only a
simple ma jority, if they didn't like him person
ally. This is too much control.
We further believe the proposal is uncon
stitutional on the grounds that it runs contrary
to the removal process of any ASSU elective
or appointive officer which is set forth in
Article V, Section 2, of the constitution. It
states that a 112» per cent petition or a two-thirds
vote of Legislature phis a two-thirds vote of
the student body is necessary for removal.
It is fortunate that the problem regarding
Daily and Legislature has been gotten out into
the open and discussed. Both sides have real
ized that a free exchange of ideas rather than
silent hostility is the answer to the problem.
This has been accomplished; any legislation
would wreck all that has been done.
We of the Daily stall' have a primary obli
gation to put out the best paper we can. In the
past weeks we have been unable to do this
because we have been fighting for a principle
we believe in deeply the principle of freedom
to live up to our responsibility as we see fit.
We hope that the Publications Board pro
posal is passed, the recall legislation defeated,
and that The Daily be allowed to devote its
energies to the task of living up to its respon
sibility to its readers.

to the removal process of any ASSU elective
or appointive officer which is set forth in
Article V, Section 2, of the constitution. It
states that a 112» per cent petition or a two-thirds
vote of Legislature phis a two-thirds vote of
the student body is necessary for removal.
It is fortunate that the problem regarding
Daily and Legislature has been gotten out into
the open and discussed. Both sides have real
ized that a free exchange of ideas rather than
silent hostility is the answer to the problem.
This has been accomplished; any legislation
would wreck all that has been done.
We of the Daily stall' have a primary obli
gation to put out the best paper we can. In the
past weeks we have been unable to do this
because we have been fighting for a principle
we believe in deeply the principle of freedom
to live up to our responsibility as we see fit.
We hope that the Publications Board pro
posal is passed, the recall legislation defeated,
and that The Daily be allowed to devote its
energies to the task of living up to its respon
sibility to its readers.
Legislature tonight considers two changes in
the Publications Board standing rules. One
would lead to more cooperation and responsi
bility by The Daily; the other could lead to
domination of the Daily editor by a very small
group.
In its meeting two weeks ago Publications
Board proposed an amendment to its standing
rules which would bring complaints and criti
cisms regarding The Daily before it as a body.
The hoard then could make recommendations
to The Daily regarding these complaints.
The Daily is solidly behind this amendment;
(lie editor voted lor it when it was proposed.
hi the past, complaints and criticisms regard
in}/; The Daily coming to ASSU offices have
never reached the Daily editor. He has heard
that they do exist, but no details have ever
been given. Now, under the proposal, the Daily
editor, as a member of the Publications Board,
would hear the specific complaints'and would
have an opportunity to rectify the valid ones.
This is definitely in keeping with a spirit of
cooperation without enforced legislation.
The other amendment before the Legislature
tonight is a violation of this spirit.
This amendment would make it possible for
415 people—l.l per cent of The Daily's finan
cial contributors—to be able to remove the
editor of The Daily by a process of petition
of "> per cent of the student body and a three
quarters vote of Legislature.
We are afraid that this would lead to domi
nation of the Daily editor by a few organiza
tions on campus wanting bigger news play and

by an editorially harassed Legislature. The
feeling of freedom would be gone.
The amendment would also make ihe staff
election of the Daily editor subject to approval
of a majority of Legislature. At present Legis
lature has to approve the election process only.
The amendment would make the Legislature
able to disapprove the new editor by only a
simple ma jority, if they didn't like him person
ally. This is too much control.
We further believe the proposal is uncon
stitutional on the grounds that it runs contrary
to the removal process of any ASSU elective
or appointive officer which is set forth in
Article V, Section 2, of the constitution. It
states that a 112» per cent petition or a two-thirds
vote of Legislature phis a two-thirds vote of
