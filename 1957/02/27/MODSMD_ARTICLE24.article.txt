A Check on Student Government
To the Editor:
Your editorial concerning the controversy over
rcodom of the press" at Stanford was an insuf
ticient commentary on the situation. The edito
rial failed to consider the existing conditions on
that campus which make it imperative for the
Stanford Daily to remain independent. Having
just left Stanford I feel that 1 am in a position
to explain those conditions.
Slanford campus, contrary to what, exists at
Cal, is an actively conservative atmosphere. Po
litically, socially and economically, the emphasis
is upon stagnation. Progress is abhorred and
change is unheard of. Naturally the student gov
ernment is the leading representative of this at
titude. The only group on campus that is opposed
to»this view is the staff of the Daily which uses
every means in its power to inject, if not a liberal
note into campus life, at least an objective one.

The paper serves as a check on the government
hy calling student attention to any of the meas
ures passed or proposed which may be useless,
harmful or partisan. This has been the Daily's
function to date; a function which is deplored by
the government.
In carrying out this function the Stanford
Daily has prided itself upon having fulfilled all
the responsibilities that are connected with their
freedom. For over 41) years the staff, without
censorship, advice or administrative criticism,
has published its paper. Why then the present
objection.
The reasons for these objections can be found,
not in the principles of the legislature and the
press, but in the people wtio proposed and sup
ported the bill. The president of the ASStJ is a
figurehead today; student government is atcually
run by his appointed assistants. Among these
assistants are some whose reactionary views and
plans are extremely distasteful to the liberal or
impartial element on campus and whose desire
for power has caused them to attempt to strangle
their strongest, adversary.
The conflict between press and government at
Stanford is a strong factional one; control of the
Stanford Daily by the legislature will only result
in suppressing the only real voice that dissenting
students have there.
