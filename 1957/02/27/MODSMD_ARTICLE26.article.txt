## Chuck Reynolds Brings UN Experiences to MUN 
### Jack Winkler 
Chuck Reynolds, as secretary
general of the Mode] United Na
tions, faces all the problems of
administrator and co-ordinator of
ihe work of the 80 people and
nine departments which are work
ing toward the April conference.
The 21-year-old senior from Al
bany, Ore., brings an abundance
of interest and experience to his
job. He is currently a major in
the History Department and plans
to enter law or political science
graduate school as a prelude to
a career at the bar or in the gov
ernment foreign service.
Reynolds is a member of the
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity, and
after graduation this June he will
spend three years in the Air Force
as a pilot and second lieutenant.
Obvious Choice
He was the obvious choice for
secretary-general when, it was
learned that would be
host to the MUN and act as the
secretariat.
Last year he headed the Stan
ford delegation that represented
Israel in the MUN at Oregon
State. In his sophomore year he
served on the group that went to
the MUN at San Francisco State.
After he was named the direc
tor ol the- MUN, Reynolds was
selected to be an intern at the
United Nations and spent, last
summer in New York working
and learning at the real world
organization.
Public Information
Along with 55 other interns
from 35 countries he worked on
the staff of the Secretariat and
attended daily lectures by senior
UN officials on everything from
trusteeship administration to si
multaneous interpretation. His
particular branch was the Depart
ment of Public information and
his boss was William Bruce, who
was a professor of political sci
ence at Stanford around 1940.
He was the youngest of the in
terns, most of whom already had
the master's degree, and in the
course of his work spent an af
ternoon with Eleanor Roosevelt,
for whom he now has a profound
respect. *
He was also presented a certifi

cate of achievement by the real I
Secretary-General, Dag Hammar- i
skjold, whom he describes as a |
modest, unassuming man who by i
his very appearance shows he is
extremely dedicated to his work
and the hope of peace.
Working Knowledge
While in New York he roomed ■
with the top student from* the
Spanish Diplomatic School and 1
met the two Communist interns '
from Hungary and C/echoslova- 1
kia. After three months at the !
UN he left with a working knowl ;
edge of how a Secretariat is run. 1
Here his position is a full-time |
job, with office work every after i
noon cjf the week, weekend meet
ings, weekly conferences with
each of the department heads and |
the entire secretariat meeting ;
each Tuesday evening.
When the MUN meeting finally
does take place from April 10 to j
13 Reynolds will welcome all the !
delegates and give an annual re
port.

Chuck Reynolds, as secretary
general of the Mode] United Na
tions, faces all the problems of
administrator and co-ordinator of
ihe work of the 80 people and
nine departments which are work
ing toward the April conference.
The 21-year-old senior from Al
bany, Ore., brings an abundance
of interest and experience to his
job. He is currently a major in
the History Department and plans
to enter law or political science
graduate school as a prelude to
a career at the bar or in the gov
ernment foreign service.
Reynolds is a member of the
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity, and
after graduation this June he will
spend three years in the Air Force
as a pilot and second lieutenant.
Obvious Choice
He was the obvious choice for
secretary-general when, it was
learned that would be
host to the MUN and act as the
secretariat.
Last year he headed the Stan
ford delegation that represented
Israel in the MUN at Oregon
State. In his sophomore year he
served on the group that went to
the MUN at San Francisco State.
After he was named the direc
tor ol the- MUN, Reynolds was
selected to be an intern at the
United Nations and spent, last
summer in New York working
and learning at the real world
organization.
Public Information
Along with 55 other interns
from 35 countries he worked on
the staff of the Secretariat and
attended daily lectures by senior
UN officials on everything from
trusteeship administration to si
multaneous interpretation. His
particular branch was the Depart
ment of Public information and
his boss was William Bruce, who
was a professor of political sci
ence at Stanford around 1940.
He was the youngest of the in
terns, most of whom already had
the master's degree, and in the
course of his work spent an af
ternoon with Eleanor Roosevelt,
for whom he now has a profound
respect. *
He was also presented a certifi

cate of achievement by the real I
Secretary-General, Dag Hammar- i
skjold, whom he describes as a |
modest, unassuming man who by i
his very appearance shows he is
extremely dedicated to his work
and the hope of peace.
Working Knowledge
While in New York he roomed ■
with the top student from* the
Spanish Diplomatic School and 1
met the two Communist interns '
from Hungary and C/echoslova- 1
kia. After three months at the !
UN he left with a working knowl ;
edge of how a Secretariat is run. 1
Here his position is a full-time |
job, with office work every after i
noon cjf the week, weekend meet
ings, weekly conferences with
each of the department heads and |
the entire secretariat meeting ;
each Tuesday evening.
When the MUN meeting finally
does take place from April 10 to j
13 Reynolds will welcome all the !
delegates and give an annual re
port.
