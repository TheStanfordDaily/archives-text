# Health Service Says Weekend Injuries Light
## 
### 
Ski casualties among Stanford
students were light over the I<Â»ng
Washington's Birthday weekend,
according to Health Service of
ficials, but spring vacation will
find skiers heading for Uic slopes.
The Health Service reported
knowledge of "one or two" inju
ries tin 1 past weekend, but said
that heavy snows apparently kept
most skiers inside.
For those planning to don the
slats spring vacation the Health
Service has offered some sugges
tions.
Since many of the ski areas' ac
commodations are booked weeks
in advance, reservations should
be confirmed before planning an
overnight trip. Chains, ski rack,
antifreeze and insurance are ne
cessities for the car. Warm cloth
ing, equipment in good repair,
sun lotion, flashlight and flares
are among the recommended sup
plies.
Health Service officials said
that "although tlie Service does
not cover the care of injuries in
areas beyond 10 miles from the
Quad, they do willingly accept
the responsibility and cost of
treatment after the injured indi
vidual returns to the University
area."
Officials urge skiers to condi
tion themselves before going ski
ing. Do not overdo or try to keep
up with those who are in condi
tion, they say. Co-operation with
the ski patrol is an essential part
of skiing, and never ski alone, of
ficials caution.
