A freshman attending USC on a football scholarship was arrested
;U 3:20 a.m. last Tuesday on suspicion of armed robbery.
The student, Gordon Hjelmstrom, a former All-City football star
for Van Nuys High School, told Los Angeles police officers that he
was guilty of participating in live San Fernando Valley armed hold
ups. The crimes took place between July and December of last year.
Hjelmstrom, a 20;"J-pound guard who was described by his friends
as being "quiet . . . unobtrusive . . . never a troublemaker," con
fessed his participation in the hold-ups after detectives told him
they found two .45-caliber automatics in the bedroom of his Van
Nuys home.
In explaining the robberies, Hjelmstrom said, "I don't know
why I i>llll*'<t (lie crimes. ... I just think I wanted to art tough."
lljHmstrmn and his tluve compatriots netted about .Y liiOO from tlie
hold-ups.
The 18-year-old youth was considered to be an "outstanding"
Trojan football prospect.
While a USC gridder has been learning the burgling trade, .a
UCLA trackster Rafer Johnson is branching out in the field of
communication and journalism.
He has been appearing on iho KTLA TV program "Insomnia"
and is also a sports reporter for the UCLA Daily Bruin. One of the
world decathlon champion's recent assignments was to cover a
Golden Gloves boxing match won by Bruin footballer Esker Harris.
Johnson probably won't cover Harris' next fight, though. It's to be
«ti Chicago for the national heavyweight Gloves crown.
With such standhys as weight man Don Vick, miter Bobby Sea
man and Johnson bolstering a veteran team, the Uelans again ap
pear overloaded with track talent.
In an effort to wrest conference track laurels out of the Smog
laud for the first time in minny, minny years, Coaches Payton Jordan
of Stanford and Bill Bowerman of Oregon are utilizing new methods
of training distance men.
As Jordan said in a recent letter to the Daily sports desk, "Bower
man and I were together a great deal at the recent Olympics in
Melbourne, Australia, and we discussed these various training meth
ods at some length."
Jordan calls his training method "tempo running." This method
calls for the runner to alternately sprint and jog throughout the
distance race. A similar method was used successfully by Russia's
Vladimir Kuts in the Games.
Denying rumors Oregon's miler Jim Bailey, less than a year
ago good enough to run a four-minute mile, is "through" on ac
count of a foot injury, Oregon Daily Fineraid sports writer Phil
Knight said, "They say Jim Bailey is through. That'll be the day."
One group of athletes that is through -as far as this year's IRA
regatta is concerned is the University of Washington crew. Despite
nation-wide protests from crew experts, the International Rowing
Association has placed ihe Husky oarsmen on probation for two
years.
Washington crew enthusiasts find the ruling hard to take. The
Pacific ('oasi Conference recently lifted its bans from all sports
except football and the Seattle rowers .are admittedly guilty of no
rules infractions.
Even the Washington State Legislature is up in arms. By a 40-0
vote the solorts decided to urge national officials to reconsider the
unwarranted indictment against the Huskies.
Couch A! I.'lbrickson's rowers had been rated among the favor
ites to capture this year's regatta.
As the ••Both Barrels by Boyington" column in the University of
Washington Daily said, "Maybe the Huskies ought to set up their
own regatta and let. the IRA get along for good without the presence
ol the ever-tough, ever-amateur University eights."
Educated guesses have UCLA winning PCG championships this
year in two of the minor spring sports - tennis and golf. Davis Cup
pers Mike Green and Mike Franks and Pebble Beach finalist John
Cranston lead the Bruin netters. In golf 10 IJclan linksters bettered
>5() in the second qualifying practice round to portend a UCLA-Stan
lord duel for Ihe crown this spring.
In baseball, the California Intercollegiate Baseball Association
appears headed for another bumper year, with the first-place nod
possibly going to Stanford. But Cal has ace pitchers Gene Stang
and Doug Weiss back and USC is always tough.
< oncerning the nearer future, Coach Howie Dalhnar went way
out on a limb last week regarding this weekend's UCLA-California
cage clash for the title. He said, "You'll have to flip a coin to tell
the difference between California and UCLA."
