# By-Law Changes On LASSU Agenda
## 
### 
Two proposed by-law changes
pertaining to The Daily will be
up for the second reading and ac
tion tonight in ASSU Legisla
ture's regular weekly meeting.
One of these two proposals
was introduced by Publications
Board and has the support of the
Daily Editorial Board.
The second proposal was intro
duced last week by a member of
Legislature's By-laws Committer
following the defeat of t -i proposal
to have the ASSU president ap
point the editor of The Daily. The
Daily has gone on record offi
cially as opposed to the second
resolution.
In other action tonight Legisla
ture will hear the presentation of
Branner Hall's new constitution.
A commission to study the libra
ries will also be appointed to
night.
