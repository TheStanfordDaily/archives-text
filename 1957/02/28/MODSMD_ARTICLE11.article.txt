# LASSU Tables By-Law Change To Okay, Recall Daily Editor
## 1140 Students Sign Petitions Backing Daily Oppose Further Action Which Controls Daily Editor or His Policy 
### Frank Huntress Associate Editor 
More than 1100 students signed
petitions this week opposing "the
suggested amendment to the Pub
lications Board Standing Rules
providing for Legislature's ap
proval of the Daily editor and re
call of this editor by a three
fourths vote of Legislature on
petition of five per cent of the
student body."
These petitions were presented
to Legislature last night by Daily
Editor Dave Scott at their weekly
meeting held at the Bowman
Alumni House. Scott said more
names would be obtained on the
petitions before Legislature meet*
| ing next Wednesday.
The petitions also urged defeat
of the amendment which provides
for recall of the editor and strong
ly disapproved "in principle any
Legislature action which would
exercise control over the Daily
editor or The Daily's editorial pol
icy."
No Continent
No comment was made on the
petitions by Legislature mem
hers. Scott said the 1140 signa
tures on the petitions "was al
most as many votes as the win
ning ASSU presidential candidate
won hy last year." Rob Freelen
received 1177 votes in the final
last year.
About 2.") visitors were present
last night to see Legislature, on
recommendation of the by-laws
committee, table the amendment
providing for approval and recall
of the Daily editor.
In the afternoon, by laws com
mittee met at Bowman to discuss
the proposed amendment. Former
Managing Editor .Jim Palmer pre
sented his case supporting the un-
I constitutionality of the amend
ment. Palmer's argument relies
on the fact that the editor is "an
appointed or elected officer" un
der the ASSU constitution.
