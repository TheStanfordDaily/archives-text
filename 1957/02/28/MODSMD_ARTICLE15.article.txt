## Also Refers Branner Constitution To Committee; Passes Pub Board Rule 
### Wally Simpson Associate Editor 
The proposal pertaining to the recall of the Daily editor was
tabled last night by ASSU Legislature in a largely attended meeting.
When the proposal was brought up. Administrative Assistant Stev •
Tallent moved that the proposal be tabled so that a constitution:!!
question might be decided.
He said that, the By-laws Committee proposed the question be sub
mitted to the dean of the Law I

School or the head of the Political
Science Department or both. All
constitutional amendments must
be submitted to these two under
I the present constitution.
The tabling motion was passed
by an 11 to 3 vote.
In a move not listed on Legis
lature's advance agenda, Freelen
asked former student financial
manager George V. Denny III to
submit to Legislature a proposal
advocating an "impartial, unbias
ed critique" of the operation and
management of The Daily by a
member of the Journalism De
partment faculty. It was carried
by a 13-0 vote.
Publications Board
Legislature also considered the
bylaw submitted by Publications
Board. Law School representative
Dave Kirbach said he did not be
lieve Publications Board should
have the right to discuss what
goes into the editorial columns of
The Daily. Engineering School
representative John Cardoza
agreed with him.
Wilbur representative Pat Cur
ley proposed that the Quad, Cha
parral and Sequoia also be includ
ed in the amendment. After some
discussion between Publications
Board chairman Don Shoup and
ASSU president Bob Freelen, and
after a parliamentary opinion by
Tallent, the chair ruled that any
amendment not in spirit with a
proposal that comes through Pub
lications Board cannot be attach
ed to that proposal.
The proposal was passed by a
9 to-6 vote. A majority vote was
all that was required to pass be
cause it was submitted by Publi
cations Board. A three fourths
vote would be required otherwise.
"Tertiary" Law
Under Denny's resolution,
which has been characterized by
| Tallent as a "tertiary" law, lower (
in level than a bylaw, these cri
' tiques will be submitted to a com-j
mittee composed of the Daily edi-'
tor, the ASSU presodent and a
different faculty member of the ;
Journalism Department.
This committee would accept or
reject all such critiques, and all
accepted recommendations not in
conflict with existing bylaws "will
be established by The Daily as
operating policy."
Tallent. said later that " 'will'
is permissive in this case if for
; no other reason than it has to be." j
In other action. Legislature
i heard Election Commission chair
man Karen Peterson's report. It
also voted to send Branner Hall's
l new constitution back for a tech- :
nical change. This change would
I clarify just who is eligible to vote .
I for bylaw changes.

In a move not listed on Legis
lature's advance agenda, Freelen
asked former student financial
manager George V. Denny III to
submit to Legislature a proposal
advocating an "impartial, unbias
ed critique" of the operation and
management of The Daily by a
member of the Journalism De
partment faculty. It was carried
by a 13-0 vote.
Publications Board
Legislature also considered the
bylaw submitted by Publications
Board. Law School representative
Dave Kirbach said he did not be
lieve Publications Board should
have the right to discuss what
goes into the editorial columns of
The Daily. Engineering School
representative John Cardoza
agreed with him.
Wilbur representative Pat Cur
ley proposed that the Quad, Cha
parral and Sequoia also be includ
ed in the amendment. After some
discussion between Publications
Board chairman Don Shoup and
ASSU president Bob Freelen, and
after a parliamentary opinion by
Tallent, the chair ruled that any
amendment not in spirit with a
proposal that comes through Pub
lications Board cannot be attach
ed to that proposal.
The proposal was passed by a
9 to-6 vote. A majority vote was
all that was required to pass be
cause it was submitted by Publi
cations Board. A three fourths
vote would be required otherwise.
"Tertiary" Law
Under Denny's resolution,
which has been characterized by
| Tallent as a "tertiary" law, lower (
in level than a bylaw, these cri
' tiques will be submitted to a com-j
mittee composed of the Daily edi-'
tor, the ASSU presodent and a
different faculty member of the ;
Journalism Department.
This committee would accept or
reject all such critiques, and all
accepted recommendations not in
conflict with existing bylaws "will
be established by The Daily as
operating policy."
Tallent. said later that " 'will'
is permissive in this case if for
; no other reason than it has to be." j
In other action. Legislature
i heard Election Commission chair
man Karen Peterson's report. It
also voted to send Branner Hall's
l new constitution back for a tech- :
nical change. This change would
I clarify just who is eligible to vote .
I for bylaw changes.
The proposal pertaining to the recall of the Daily editor was
tabled last night by ASSU Legislature in a largely attended meeting.
When the proposal was brought up. Administrative Assistant Stev •
Tallent moved that the proposal be tabled so that a constitution:!!
question might be decided.
He said that, the By-laws Committee proposed the question be sub
mitted to the dean of the Law I

School or the head of the Political
Science Department or both. All
constitutional amendments must
be submitted to these two under
I the present constitution.
The tabling motion was passed
by an 11 to 3 vote.
