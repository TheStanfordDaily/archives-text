# Let's Call a Halt

### 
W E ARE SICK, of the whole tiling. Legislature
last night tabled one amendment pertaining to
recall of the Daily editor, passed one amend
ment proposed by Publications Hoard and
backed by The Daily, and passed a resolution
setting up a critical survey of The Daily.
We hoped that the recall amendment would
be defeated, and still hope so. We question
the constitutional validity of it. It is good that
qualified people in the political science depart
ment and the Law School will determine its
constitutionality.
The Publications Board amendment will
bring complaints and criticisms about The
Daily before the board. This was the only con
structive move made last night. The Daily now
has an opportunity to act. on valid criticisms
that develop concerning its policies.
The resolution setting up machinery for a
critical evaluation of The Daily runs contrary
to the Publications Board standing rules, be
cause the resolution also makes it mandatory
that The Daily accept suggestions resulting
from the evaluation. In the standing rules—■
which take precedence over resolutions passed
by majority vote —the Daily editor has com
plete control of . he Daily's editorial policy.
All the provisions in recent weeks concerning
The Daily have had legal or technical holes
mi them. \\ e wish that clear, operable pro

posals could have been advanced in caeh in
stance so that debate on principles instead of
bickering over minor points could have re
sulted. By all rights the Daily matter should
have been cleared up last night.
Vie suggest that more time and deliberation
go into legislation before it is drawn up. Many
problems can he cleared up by mature dis
cussion and cooperation rather than hasty and
ill-conceived legislation.
As far as the recall amendment is concerned,
we urge its defeat, if it is ruled constitutional.
In 48 hours I MO students petitioned that no
restrictive legislation concerning The Daily be
passed. This is a significant mandate, and we
believe that this mandate, plus the fact the
legislation is wrong in principle, meanA that
Legislature should defeat it.
Now enough has been said. Space in the
editorial columns of The Daily has been de
voted to the subject pro and con. We are tired
of a different piece of legislation concerning
The Daily being pealed off every week. We
believe the student body is also losing interest.
Let's call a complete halt and work toward
aiding the students a function with which
both The Daily and Legislature should be pri
marily concerned. Until next Wednesday we
on the Daily staff plan to devote all our efforts
to our only re.il task— putting out a good Daily.

last night tabled one amendment pertaining to
recall of the Daily editor, passed one amend
ment proposed by Publications Hoard and
backed by The Daily, and passed a resolution
setting up a critical survey of The Daily.
We hoped that the recall amendment would
be defeated, and still hope so. We question
the constitutional validity of it. It is good that
qualified people in the political science depart
ment and the Law School will determine its
constitutionality.
The Publications Board amendment will
bring complaints and criticisms about The
Daily before the board. This was the only con
structive move made last night. The Daily now
has an opportunity to act. on valid criticisms
that develop concerning its policies.
The resolution setting up machinery for a
critical evaluation of The Daily runs contrary
to the Publications Board standing rules, be
cause the resolution also makes it mandatory
that The Daily accept suggestions resulting
from the evaluation. In the standing rules—■
which take precedence over resolutions passed
by majority vote —the Daily editor has com
plete control of . he Daily's editorial policy.
All the provisions in recent weeks concerning
The Daily have had legal or technical holes
mi them. \\ e wish that clear, operable pro

posals could have been advanced in caeh in
stance so that debate on principles instead of
bickering over minor points could have re
sulted. By all rights the Daily matter should
have been cleared up last night.
Vie suggest that more time and deliberation
go into legislation before it is drawn up. Many
problems can he cleared up by mature dis
cussion and cooperation rather than hasty and
ill-conceived legislation.
As far as the recall amendment is concerned,
we urge its defeat, if it is ruled constitutional.
In 48 hours I MO students petitioned that no
restrictive legislation concerning The Daily be
passed. This is a significant mandate, and we
believe that this mandate, plus the fact the
legislation is wrong in principle, meanA that
Legislature should defeat it.
Now enough has been said. Space in the
editorial columns of The Daily has been de
voted to the subject pro and con. We are tired
of a different piece of legislation concerning
The Daily being pealed off every week. We
believe the student body is also losing interest.
Let's call a complete halt and work toward
aiding the students a function with which
both The Daily and Legislature should be pri
marily concerned. Until next Wednesday we
on the Daily staff plan to devote all our efforts
to our only re.il task— putting out a good Daily.
W E ARE SICK, of the whole tiling. Legislature
