Wall of Humanity
Editor, The Daily:
Admittedly, ballet dancers, often up floating
like birds in the breeze, afford occasionally the
audience an excellent view. However, it's often
interesting to see what's happening when the
dancers are on the floor. This was impossible
at Saturday night's performance of thp Ballets
Basques de Biarritz, thanks to the solid wall of
humanity squatting in the orchestra pit.
We on the main floor suspected that "the danc
ers did indeed have feet, but this was pure con
jecture.
Missing out on some parts of the show, the
main floor itself put on an excellent giraffe act.
But J am still not sure whether the legitimate
orformer was dancing around, on top of, or in
c small but significant object on the stage—a
glass of water, I later discovered.
No need to belabor the point. The performance
was excellent (I thought) but Die mechanics of
the presentation could have been improved. It is
hoped that in future similar performances, the
Concert Series people will resist temptation and
avoid overselling the intended capacity of Mem
Aud.

Prison Tactics
Editor, Thn Daily:
I'd like to enter a strong protest in print
against; the prison tactics of the Men's Rest
Home. An attempt to visit and cheer two friends
serving sentences there resulted in the frustra
tion of being informed by the nurse on duty that
iho Rest Home has no visiting hours, ever, for
anybody. The reason given was that "the doctors
want it to be a rest home in every sense of the
word," a condition which perhaps likens the some
less to a prison than to a tomb.
Keeping the Rest Home quiet makes sense—
but haven't the doctors gone overboard? Isn't it
possible for individuals to visit their roommates
without raising a cloud of dust and an atmos
phere of excitement?
Aren't thete hours when patients could be vis
ited briefly without their rest schedule being vio
lated? Surely a workable system for visiting
hours could be initiated. Perhaps having visitors
doesn't make one get well any faster (maybe it
does), but it can certainly do a lot to cheer up
the patient caught in a continuous web of nurses,
meals, pills and enemas.
Actually, men, you're better off in Sing-Sing.
At least there your friends can come say hello.

without raising a cloud of dust and an atmos
phere of excitement?
Aren't thete hours when patients could be vis
ited briefly without their rest schedule being vio
lated? Surely a workable system for visiting
hours could be initiated. Perhaps having visitors
doesn't make one get well any faster (maybe it
does), but it can certainly do a lot to cheer up
the patient caught in a continuous web of nurses,
meals, pills and enemas.
Actually, men, you're better off in Sing-Sing.
At least there your friends can come say hello.

Wall of Humanity
Editor, The Daily:
Admittedly, ballet dancers, often up floating
like birds in the breeze, afford occasionally the
audience an excellent view. However, it's often
interesting to see what's happening when the
dancers are on the floor. This was impossible
at Saturday night's performance of thp Ballets
Basques de Biarritz, thanks to the solid wall of
humanity squatting in the orchestra pit.
We on the main floor suspected that "the danc
ers did indeed have feet, but this was pure con
jecture.
Missing out on some parts of the show, the
main floor itself put on an excellent giraffe act.
But J am still not sure whether the legitimate
orformer was dancing around, on top of, or in
c small but significant object on the stage—a
glass of water, I later discovered.
No need to belabor the point. The performance
was excellent (I thought) but Die mechanics of
the presentation could have been improved. It is
hoped that in future similar performances, the
Concert Series people will resist temptation and
avoid overselling the intended capacity of Mem
Aud.

Prison Tactics
Editor, Thn Daily:
I'd like to enter a strong protest in print
against; the prison tactics of the Men's Rest
Home. An attempt to visit and cheer two friends
serving sentences there resulted in the frustra
tion of being informed by the nurse on duty that
iho Rest Home has no visiting hours, ever, for
anybody. The reason given was that "the doctors
want it to be a rest home in every sense of the
word," a condition which perhaps likens the some
less to a prison than to a tomb.
Keeping the Rest Home quiet makes sense—
but haven't the doctors gone overboard? Isn't it
possible for individuals to visit their roommates
without raising a cloud of dust and an atmos
phere of excitement?
