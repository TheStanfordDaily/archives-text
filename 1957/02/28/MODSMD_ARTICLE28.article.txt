### David Hamilton 
Dr. Eva Brarm, instructor in

sixth-century B.C. well in Greece.
The well, which was discovered

published in Hesperia, the journal
of the American School of Classi
cal Studies at Athens.

This institute, which has been!
carrying on excavations at Cor
inth for 25 years, annually invites
two professors to Greece to help
in uncovering new finds. Miss
Brann has gone to Greece several
limes to work at the "dig."
In Life magazine last fall there
was an article about recent dis
coveries in Greece. The article
described the restoration of the ;
Agora, an ancient market place.
