# Indians Journey to Moscow For Year's Final Cage Series
## Stanford Out to Even Conference Record at 8-8; Vandals Rugged Despite Dismal Won-Lost Mark 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford closes its 1937 basket
ball schedule tomorrow and Sat
urday nights when it tangles with
pesky Idaho in a PCC finale at
Moscow.
If season records are any indi
cation, Stanford should bo a slight
favorite over the Vandals. The
Tribe stands 10-14 on the season
and has run up a 6-8 mark in
PCC play, good for fifth place in
the standings.
Idaho, meanwhile, has found it
self imbedded in eighth place with
a dismal 3-11 mark. The won-lost
record actually does not give a
true picture of the two teams.
Narrow Losses
The Vandals, for example, lost
their two games to conference
powerhouse UCLA by a grand
total of two points. The second
of the one-point losses was an
overtime affair which the Bruins
were most fortunate to win.
Stanford, on the other hand,
was mercilessly clobbered by the
Bruins in a duo of second-half on
slaughts after the Indians had
field their own for the first 20
minutes of play.
Coach Howie Dallmar's squad
has had more than its share of
narrow losses. Four of the In
dians' eight PCC setbacks have
come by a total of 11 points, while
the Cards have turned the tables
by winning another pair of games
by a composite margin of just
nine digits.

Idaho's offense has been spark
ed during the past few games by
Gary Simmons. He missed much
of the early part of the season
and has gotten into only six
games, all recent encounters. He
is now hitting at better than 1G
points per game and has rolled
up the best free-throw percentage
in the conference.
Simmons has hit on 40 of 42
charity tosses for a mark of 95.2
per cent, nearly nine percentage
points higher than his nearest op
ponent.
Regular Scorers
Gary McEwen is the only other
Vandal with more than 10 points
per game. He has totaled 142
points in PCC play for a 10.1
average. Bill Wilson, Hal Dami
ano and VVhaylen Coleman are the
three remaining regular Idaho
scorers, with respective averages
of 8.7, 7.2 and 6.8 points per game.
As a team, the Vandals' princi
pal difficulty appears to be one
of shooting accuracy. They have
managed to hit on only 30.8 per
cent of their field goal attempts
for far and away the poorest
mark in the PCC.
Stanford is in just the reverse
situation, with its 41.5 per cent
floor mark good for the No. 1 spot
in PCC statistics. The Indians
also show better statistical aver
ages on both offensive and defen
sive play, although edging the
Idahoans by only a small margin
in both departments.
