# Lee Leonard Brightens Next Year's Outlook
## 
### Bob Payne 
Lee Leonard, 6-8 junior, has
been one of the pleasant surprises
of the Card varsity this season
and brightens the outlook for
next season.
Leonard saw his first starting
action of the season last Saturday
when he opened against Southern
California. He performed capably
under both backboards, in addi
tion to picking up some important
points.
Last season Leonard played at
Shasta Junior College, in his
home town of Redding. He played
frosh ball at Stanford two sea
sons ago.
Although he weighs only 187
pounds, Lee has held up well
against heftier opponents under
the boards this season because of
his excellent speed and spring.
He readily names Washington's
b'-7, 230-pound sophomore sensa
tion Doug Smart as the best man
he's been up against this season.
Lee's improvement was shown
from the start of the season, and
his excellent showing last Friday
night merited him a starting job
in Saturday's game. He scored
five points in the opener and six
in the second game, with his
quickness drawing a great many
fouls from his slower rivals, as it
lias all season.
Leonard will give next year's
starting five something Stanford
lias been without for many sea
sonsâ€”a big man. "With a few
breaks we could have done better
this season," said Lee in evalu
ating the past campaign. "We'll
do better next year."
