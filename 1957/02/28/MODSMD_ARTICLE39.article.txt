# Matmen Will Host Oregon in Finale
## 
### 
Stanford hosts probably its
toughest competition tomorrow at
8 p.m. in the final dual wrestling
match of the season.
Oregon will engage in mat ex
ercises with the Card wrestlers at
Encina in the last week of compe
tition before the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate matches next week.
Coach Wes Ruff expects the
Ducks to be very tough; and, to
add to SU's scoring difficulties,
the Indians will probably have to
forfeit two weight classes.
