FASTER, FASTER!
■ ick up your paper every morning and what do you
read? "Crisis in Higher Education." That's what you
read. "Enrollment Spiralling Upward — Desperate
Need for More Classrooms, More Teachers." But
classrooms, alas, do not spring up like mushrooms, nor
teachers like mayflies. So what must we do while we
build mure classrooms, train more teachers? We must
get better use out of the classrooms and teachers we now
have. That's what we must do.
This column, normally a vehicle of good-humored
foolery, of .joy that wrinkled care derides, of laughter
holding both his sides, will today forsake levity to ex
amine the crisis in higher education. My sponsors, the
makers of Philip Morris Cigarettes, as bonnie a bunch
of tycoons as you will see in a month of Sundays, have
given cheerful consent to this departure. Oh, splendid
chaps they are, the makers of Philip Morris! Oh, darlin*
types they are, fond of home, mother, porridge, the Con
stitution, and country fiddling! Twinkly and engaging
they are, jaunty and sociable, roguish and winsome, as
full of joy, as packed with pleasure, as brimming with
natural goodness, as loaded with felicity as the ciga
rettes they bring you in two convenient sizes — regular
in the handy snap-open pack, and new long-size in a
crushproof flip-top box — both available at moderate cost
from your favorite tobacconist. Light one now. Light
either end. No filter cigarette can make that statement.

Let us then, with the gracious connivance of the
makers of Philip Morris — Oh, splendid chaps! Oh, gra
cious connivers! — take up the terribly vexing question
of how we can turn out more graduates with campus
facilities as they now exist.
The answer can be given in one word: speedup! Speed
tip the educational process. Streamline courses. Elimi
nate frills. Sharpen. Shorten. Quicken.
Following is a list of courses with suggested methods
to speed up each one.
PHYSICS — Eliminate slow neutrons.
Psych Lab —Tilt the mazes downhill. The white
mice will run much faster.
Engineering — Make slide rules half as long.
Music Change all tempo to allegro. (A collateral
benefit to be gained from this suggestion is that once
you speed up waltz time, campus proms will all be over by
10 p.m. With students going home so early, romance will
languish and marriage counselors can be transferred
to the buildings and grounds department. Also, housing
now used for married students can be returned to the
school of animal husbandry.)
Algebra—lf "x" always equals 24, much time-con-
Burning computation can be eliminated.
Languages — Teach all language courses in English.
Dentistry-Skip baby teeth. They fall out anyhow.
Poetry — Amalgamate the classics. Like this:
flail to thee, blithe spirit
Shoot if yon muxt thin old gray head
Yon ain't no thin' hut a hound, dog
Smiling the, hoy fell dead,.
You see how simple it is? Perhaps you have some
speedup ideas of your own. If so, I'll thank you to keep
them to yourselves.
