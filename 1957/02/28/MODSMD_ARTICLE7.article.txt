# Teacher Choice Discussed by Ed School Dean
## 
### 
"The percentage of gifts re
ceived by Stanford in the past 21
years has increased by 31.5,
while the amount of endow
ments has decreased by 38.5 per
cent.," sod i.»oan of Education T.
•lames Quillen last night as he
addressed Alpha Sigma Epsilon
and Naranja at the fraternity
house.
In 1936, Stanford received
$372,954, compared with the 1957
amount of gifts totaling $10,674.-
000. Total budget of operating
expenses for 1930 was $3,007,322
compared with the $14,000,000 to
he spent this year. Of course, at
that time tuition was only $315,
while the student body totaled
4619 in contrast to Stanford's
present enrollment of 8287.
With the rise of enrollment,
University staff increased from
1256 to 2767. In past years pub
lication and research have tend
ed to outweigh actual teaching
in the selection of professors,
but now a balance between qual
ity teaching and outside work is
sought in the appointment, con
tinued appointment and promo
tion of faculty, according to
Quillen.
With the General Studies Uro
gram, an attempt is being made
to enable freshmen and sopho
mores to have more professors,
by declaring majors at the be
ginning of the freshman year.
