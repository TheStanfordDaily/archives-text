Founded in I 108
After being founded in 1498 by
decree of Emperor Maximilian I,
| the choir sang for the imperial
court until the empire collapsed
at the end of World War I. Since
I then it has been, supported by
private funds and by its own
j tours.
The choir was disbanded during
World War II \ hen the late Fa
j ther Josef Schnitt, rector of the
group, refused to allow the choir
| to be used for Nazi propaganda.
With the end of hostilities the
group was reorganized and re
turned to the U.S. in 1948.
So coveted are the positions in
the choir that when it was re
formed 7000 children applied for
I admission. Only 100 a year can
be accepted, however. They are
trained for two years, (hen di
vided up among the three sections
nl ihe choir which rotate between
world louring and singing at St.
Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.
Changing Voice Problem
The greatest problem of the
choir is changing voices. Each
year, sometimes even in the mid
dle (if a tour, a hoy's voiee may
suddenly crack and drop from a
heniiijllll soprano or alto to an
uncertain lenor or baritone
The moment this happens the
j boy's service with the choir is j
ended. "Stop singing the minute
the voice begins to break," said'
Murok. The organization cares for
I him from then on and sees
through his education.
Almost every Austrian or Ger
man musician of any importance
sang, composed, conducted or as j
instrumentalist performed with!
the Choir Boys. Schubert, Haydn,
! Beethoven, Mozart, Liszt and
Bruckner have all worked with
tliem. Schubert and Haydn were!
members of the choir themselves. '
The performance is being spoil-:
sored by the Institute of Interna
tional Relations to raise money
for the Free University of Berlin
and Keio University scholarships
which bring three scholars here j
each year.
