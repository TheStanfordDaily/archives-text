## Eban Confers With Dulles, Gives Advance Notice of Withdrawal Plans 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Feb. 28 (UP)—lsrael will announce to
morrow it will withdraw its forces behind the Palestine armistice
lines in conformity with the United Nations resolution of Fob. 2,
diplomatic sources said tonight.
Israel announced today it will be ready to give its decision on with-

drawal from Egyptian territory
to the United Nations General
Assembly tomorrow afternoon.
Meanwhile in Washington, Is
raeli Ambassador Abba Eban to
day informed the United States of
"the plans" under which Israel
would withdraw its forces from
Egyptian territory: He said they
will be laid before the United Na
tions tomorrow.
Eban said after a conference
with Secretary of State John Fos
ter Dulles that he had notified
Dulles of "our policies and our in
tentions.", He declined to say
whether Dulles was satisfied.
The Israeli envoy also refused
to disclose details of the with
drawal plan before it is laid for
mally before the UN General As
sembly tomorrow. Until then, he
said, he could make no "statement
of substance."
Terms Acceptable?
Asked whether he thought Is
rael's terms for withdrawal will
be acceptable to all United Na
tions members, Eban said:
"I think they will be greeted
with gratification by all who are
really concerned with peace, secu
rity and stability in the Middle
East."
Eban did say that France,
which had joined Israel and Brit
ain in the invasion of Egypt,
played "a very helpful" role in
breaking the troop withdrawal
deadlock.
However, in Jerusalem, cabinet
members said tonight Israel
would reject any compromise
withdrawal plan which would re
turn the Gaza Strip to Egyptian
control.
Marathon Discussions
Premier David Ben-Gurion and
his cabinet continued their mara
thon discussions. Today's meet
ing—the ninth in the past seven
days—was described as "fateful."
It came amid new reports of an
impending government crisis
stemming from opposition to
withdrawal from Gaza.
Deliberations of the cabinet
were kept secret. However, gov
ernment sources said there would
be no deal that would allow Egyp
tian forces to move back into
Gaza.
Shortly before Eban made his
statement, President Eisenhower
and French Premier Guy Mollet
issued a joint comunique express
ing their "common conviction"
that the Middle East crisis could
be solved by "peaceful means."
The ambassador said it was cor
rect to say there had been a
"breakthrough" in the long talks
on the problem. He said the
breakthrough occurred "not in
the last few hours," but during
the "sincere and earnest efforts"
made by United States and Israeli
officials even before that.
Constructive Role
Eban said he informed Dulles in
advance about the Israeli state
ment in the UN tomorrow "as a
courtesy" because the Secretary
had played a constructive role in
trying to solve the Israeli-Egyp
tian deadlock.
Eban's statement climaxed a
busy day of negotiations as Amer
ican and Israeli leaders put the
final touches on the troop with
drawal accord.
The Israeli embassy had been
in touch throughout the day with
the State Department and Eban
had conferred with Assistant Sec
retary of State Francis Wilcox.

cialist on UN affairs.

ing their "common conviction"
that the Middle East crisis could
be solved by "peaceful means."
The ambassador said it was cor
rect to say there had been a
"breakthrough" in the long talks
on the problem. He said the
breakthrough occurred "not in
the last few hours," but during
the "sincere and earnest efforts"
made by United States and Israeli
officials even before that.
Constructive Role
Eban said he informed Dulles in
advance about the Israeli state
ment in the UN tomorrow "as a
courtesy" because the Secretary
had played a constructive role in
trying to solve the Israeli-Egyp
tian deadlock.
Eban's statement climaxed a
busy day of negotiations as Amer
ican and Israeli leaders put the
final touches on the troop with
drawal accord.
The Israeli embassy had been
in touch throughout the day with
the State Department and Eban
had conferred with Assistant Sec
retary of State Francis Wilcox.
Wilcox is the department's spe
cialist on UN affairs.
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Feb. 28 (UP)—lsrael will announce to
morrow it will withdraw its forces behind the Palestine armistice
lines in conformity with the United Nations resolution of Fob. 2,
diplomatic sources said tonight.
Israel announced today it will be ready to give its decision on with-

drawal from Egyptian territory
to the United Nations General
Assembly tomorrow afternoon.
Meanwhile in Washington, Is
raeli Ambassador Abba Eban to
day informed the United States of
"the plans" under which Israel
would withdraw its forces from
Egyptian territory: He said they
will be laid before the United Na
tions tomorrow.
Eban said after a conference
with Secretary of State John Fos
ter Dulles that he had notified
Dulles of "our policies and our in
tentions.", He declined to say
whether Dulles was satisfied.
The Israeli envoy also refused
to disclose details of the with
drawal plan before it is laid for
mally before the UN General As
sembly tomorrow. Until then, he
said, he could make no "statement
of substance."
Terms Acceptable?
Asked whether he thought Is
rael's terms for withdrawal will
be acceptable to all United Na
tions members, Eban said:
"I think they will be greeted
with gratification by all who are
really concerned with peace, secu
rity and stability in the Middle
East."
Eban did say that France,
which had joined Israel and Brit
ain in the invasion of Egypt,
played "a very helpful" role in
breaking the troop withdrawal
deadlock.
However, in Jerusalem, cabinet
members said tonight Israel
would reject any compromise
withdrawal plan which would re
turn the Gaza Strip to Egyptian
control.
Marathon Discussions
Premier David Ben-Gurion and
his cabinet continued their mara
thon discussions. Today's meet
ing—the ninth in the past seven
days—was described as "fateful."
It came amid new reports of an
impending government crisis
stemming from opposition to
withdrawal from Gaza.
Deliberations of the cabinet
were kept secret. However, gov
ernment sources said there would
be no deal that would allow Egyp
tian forces to move back into
Gaza.
Shortly before Eban made his
statement, President Eisenhower
and French Premier Guy Mollet
issued a joint comunique express
ing their "common conviction"
that the Middle East crisis could
be solved by "peaceful means."
