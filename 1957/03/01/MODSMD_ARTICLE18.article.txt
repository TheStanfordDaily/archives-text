"The area of California north
of Sacramento contains "0 per
cent of California's water upp'v,
while the area below the state
capital has 77 per cent of the need
for water. This very simply sums
up California's water problem,"
said the assemblyman.
No Answer Reached

been sought and deliberated upon
by the legislature for some lime,
but no answer has been reached.
The northern and southern par's

reach a compromise.
Regarding the future of Cali
fornia's higher education system,
Weinberger said that "by 1972 the
enrollment in state schools wii!
be 93,000." The long-range prob
lem is how to meet the needs of
such an enrollment. Right now
the University of California is
going to have to stiffen admis
sion requirements, and standard
once admission is attained, added
the assemblyman.
Question Period
During the question period fol
lowing Weinberger's talk, the
question of the effects of Propo
sition 5 was raised. This propo
sition struck from the California
Constitution the part that food
must be served where alcoholic
beverages are sold. Weinberger
said he didn't believe this would
mean a return of the old-fashion
ed saloon, but would make possi
ble more uniform enforcement
and would better the food condi
tions.
