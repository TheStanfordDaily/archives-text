# Joe and Investigations
## 
### 
Thf; Salem witc.h hijntkr himself, Senator
Joseph R. McCarthv, is at il again. And the
shame of it is that the subject of his accusa
tions, Supreme Court Justice nominee \\ illiam
J. Brennan, backed down before him.
By an hour of grilling, McCarthy in a Senate
committee hearing, got Brennan to agree that
Communism is a conspiracy against the United
States and to deny that his remark that "there
are some practices in the contemporary Ameri
can scene which are reminiscent of Salem witch
hunts" pertained particularly to McCarthy's
investigation of Communism in the Army.
1 he event shows a disadvantage of our gov
ernmental system which requires a professional
man like Brennan to be grilled by a group of
narrow-minded senators.
We heartily commend President Eisenhow
er's policy of appointing only men of law and
judicial experience on the court, regardless of
their party affiliation.
We only wish the junior senator from Wis
consin would realize this, rather than looking
tor any so-called leftish leanings in Brennan,
merely because he isn't the conservative ap
pointment McCarthy would like him to be.
McCarthy said the former ,\ew Jersey Su
preme Court justice "lias a reputation o! con
ducting a back-fence sniping against anyone
who dares expose Communists/ 1
We hold that the real danger is the people
who back-snipe at anyone who expresses senti

meats contrary in so-called sacred majority. [
Bight-wing sentiments are just as dangerous j
as left-wing sentiments. Such hysteria plays!
right into the hands of the (loininunists.
Some investigating committees are good, i
Many facets of government need reorganizing
and revamping. There is corruption and, in
some cases, disloyalty in the national and state |
governments that a responsible probing could j
clean up.
Hut when the investigation gets down to the
point of mistreating a man because he ex-j
pressed dissatisfaction with a senator's meth
ods, then the investigating committee is hark
ing up the wrong tree.
McCarthy was not even a member of the;
committee, hut he was still given the privilege;
of cross-examining Brennan. \\ hen there is
inefficiency and confusion in the government, i
such tactics make the whole situation more
confused and more foul. \\ e only wish that
Brennan had had the courage to point that out
to the committee, and that other responsible
government leaders would point that out to all
investigating committees.
As long as the committees' main function is
to discourage disagreement with their policies
and to stomp on individualism and free speech, 1
while at the same time doing nothing con
structive, then there is no real use for them.
Besides, investigating just to he investigating ,
is just as bad as legislating just to be legislating. j
