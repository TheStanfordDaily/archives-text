Now Daily Neglecting Outside
Editor, The Daily:
The United Nations may sanction Israel any
day, or Dulles and Eban may reach a compro
mise that will satisfy the General Assembly. A
meeting in Cairo may have the most serious re
percussions for the United StatPs. An extremely
important Senate investigation of labor racket
eering is under way. Yet you choose to reiterate
at endless length your repetitious views on an
amendment before the Legislature. The Legis
lature and the public both know your views on
the subject, and you have given your readers
every chance to express theirs. Monday you ac

tually had two editorials, onp based on the false
assumption that the ASSU constitution, any more
than that of the United States, is inviolate and i
unchanging. I helieve that you have reached the
bottom of the argument barrel. I also believe
that you are forgetting your responsibility to
keep up with what is going on outside this Uni
versity, which is of far grpatpr import than what
is going on inside it.
One last note—perhaps it is a strange coinci
dence, but suddenly you present far more discus-1
sions of campus organizations, and actually ask
your readers to join with The Daily in its pursuit!
of news. I wonder why.
