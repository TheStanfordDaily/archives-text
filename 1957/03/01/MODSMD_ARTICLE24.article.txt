# Valuable Old Manuscripts Given to Libe
## 
### 
A facsimile edition of "one of
the world's most beautiful manu
scripts" has recently been added
to the Stanford Library.
An official of the British Mu
seum has called the Lindisfarne
Gospels "one dt the world's most
beautiful manuscripts and cer
tainly the most beautiful in the
British Museum."
When the announcement of the
forthcoming publication of the
facsimile edition of the Lindis
farne Gospels whs received, it was
not a question of whether or riot
they were going to purchase the
book—it was a "must" to have
but rather the question of where
they were going to get the $325
to pay for it that faced the li
brarians.
Through Generosity
It was at this time that Edgar
Kahn approached Terry Bender,
chief of the division of special
collections and keeper of rare
books, with the question "Is there
anything I can do for the Libra
ry?" It is through the generosity
of Kahn and B. F. Schlesinger
that the new edition is now in the
Bender Room of the Library.
The Gospels was written and
illuminated by Eadfrith, bishop of
Lindisfarne, from 698 to 721 A.D.
The work contains five pages
of abstract ornament, six of large
decorative initials, 16 arcades of
canon tables, many small initials
and four portraits of evangelists
derived from Italian Byzantine
sources.
The facsimile has 28 pages of
color reproductions. The other
'190 pages are reproduced in black
and-white photogravure.
"Most Impressive"
The distinct colors in the repro
duction show how well those in
the original have kept. The Gos
pels has been called the "most
impressive document of the fu
sion of Irish, Anglo-Saxon and
Mediterranean style achieved in
Northumbrian art of the period."
The original, which is housed
in the British Museum, was writ
ten on vellum the fine-grained
skin of a lamb, kid or calf pre
pared as a writing surface. This
material could be sown with a
fine thread, if it became torn.
Usually when someone writes
in a book, its value declines but
just the opposite happened with
the Gospels. Someone during thp
10th century wrote the Anglo-
Saxon translation between the
lines of the Latin text.
The work is important to Ihe
history of the art of palaeography
for two reasons. First, the Latin
text is very similar to that of the
Vulgate Gospels. Second, the An
glo-Saxon interlinear gloss — or
Old English, as it is often called
shows many features which serve
to demarcate later English from
its ancestors and other languages.
