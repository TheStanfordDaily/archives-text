# ‘Little Man on Campus’ Series Is Drawn by Stanford Graduate
## Bibler Portrays University Life In His Cartoons 
### Dave Canfield 
Dick Biblor, Stanford '52, start
ed cartooning at the age of 12 in
Elkhart, Kans., whore ho earned
himself quite a reputation by run
ning the wrong way in his first
football gamp.
In an interview by mail, the
creator of "Little Man on Cam
pus" said of his early years in
Kansas: "1 liked the cheer lead
ers. One liked me- before that
fateful day [Bibler's wrong-way
run]. But, as it turned out, I wan
equally good at other sports."
From Kansas, Biblor migrated
to Stanford, where one of his fa
vorite activities was "to sip cof
fee slowly and eye the coeds.
Most Stanford girls are beautiful
—so why not?
"In spite of what some of my
friends around Stanford may
say," Bibler quipped, "I studied
drawing and painting."
The cartoonist carries in a ny
vivid impressions of his Stanford
days. As be reflected: "I was
impressed by Clary Crosby's hairy
face and high-lop boots. And lie
didn't wear a holt. 1 don't wear
a belt any more which just
proves to mo that wealth and suc
cess can bo as common as I."
Professor Snarl'
Answering a rumor thai the
villain of "Little Man on Campus"
-Professor Snarf is based on a
real-life Farm pedagogue, Bibler
replied that every college campus
has a "Snarf."
Bibler should know for, aside
from Stanford, ho has also attend
ed Kansas University, Colorado
State, Kansas City Art Institute
and. as he .jested, "U. of H. K.
[Hard Knocks]."
What most impressed the car
toonist about Stanford wore the
philosophy books of Philosophy
Professor Jeffrey Smith "stacks
and stacks of dusty books lhat 1
believe ho has really read and
understands.
"My yes!" Bibler reminisced.
"I still look back to those days.
I'm sorry that I never got to see
the inside of the Stanford Kappa
Sig house. . . ."
"Little Man on Campus"
He felt that ho himself had boon
a "little man on campus," labeling
most of his college life as "quite
teeny-tiny. I knew, however, that
I had been 'made' when sorority
girls started speaking to mo [an
independent | before I had been
asked to 'pledge.'"
As for his post-collegiate days.
Bibler has sr rved four years in
the United States Air Force, is
married and lives, with his wife,
two daughters and a "calm son,"
in Areata, Calif.
lie keeps quite busy: "I'm try
ing to teach school, draw car
toons, love my wife, beat my kids
- and type this letter on my draw
ing-board lap. . . . Bibler Feature
Service is operated by a good
friend of mine my mother."
The feature service is only a
"sideline," Biblor said. Although
250 colleges use the feature, few
er than 50 are more than orico-a
wook issues and some schools buy
as few as five a year. Thus, half
of the output each year just a
little more than pays for itself.
"It is work extracting money
from my college friends," the car
toonist joked, "primarily because
the cartoons are so bad that some

of the college students would
think it would reflect on their TQ
to pay for them. Actually, though,
the cartoon 'mats' are pro! ty
cheap, and, oven if the newspaper
doesn't want to use them it*i the
paper, they make excellent hot
dish pads or Martini coasters."
About 100 sets of these mats
are produced a year for college
papers in almost every state as
well as Hawaii and Canada. "I
wish it were possible to do 300
per year," Biblor explained, "but
for the few [less than 10] who
could use that many it would
make it impossible to produce be
cause of the cost."
Cartooning has earned for the
ex-Stanfordite a '53 Pontiac and
a "four-room house with throe
kids and a new carport-laundry
room."
Bibler described the car as still
having a "malted milk stain on
the floor . . . coming through
Reno last year, 1 got excited at
seeing the car-hop- -tipped the
tray into the dash! Boy, was I
mad."
Of his house, the cartoonist
quipped: "I'm thinking of mov
ing my work to the laundry room
it's easier to work with, and my
wife says it might be an incentive
to 'clean up' some of my car toons.
"But 1 have good censors," Bib
lor admitted: "my"wife and my
mother — absolutely no sense of
humor!"
Future plans include leaching

: and drawing cartoons about., col
lege "hope to continue until the
college kiris have had their fill."
As a PS. lo his epistle, Bibler
added, "Don't show I his letter to
anyone at Stanford they'll ask
for my diploma back!"
