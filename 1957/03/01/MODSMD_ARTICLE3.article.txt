## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 28
<UP) The Pacific Coast Confer
ence opens u three-day meeting
here tomorrow to discuss two of
the most important issues facing
its athletes, grades and money.
Professor Emmet 1 Moore of
Washington State, president of
the conference, said the PCC
would try to solidify proposals
made at a January meeting and
perhaps draw up a code.
The PCC. at Ihe January meet
ing, adopted "in principle" an aca
demic requirement of substantial
ly a "C" average and also an in
crease in the rule which at pres
ent requires athletes to pass 21
semester or 36 quarter hours be
tween his seasoos of competition.
While proposing to toughen up
scholastic requirements Ihe PCC
may ease up rules on financial
aid.
The financial assistance pro
gram under consideration would
permit a student athlete to obtain
employment and other financial
aid up to the standard educational
costs on his campus. It also would
condition all unearned aid on
demonstrated need, and would
permit an athlete lo work fewer
hours during the season of his
sport.
Professor Moore said that in
event these items are completed
in time the conference might also
consider some subjects otherwise
scheduled for the regular spring
meeting.
