Three months of anxious moments and heartbreaks come to a
close tomorrow night when the Stanford basketball team plays its
last game of the 1956-57 season. It's been a disappointing year in
many respects, but probably the most disappointed were the experts,
who saw their prophecy of a last-place finish for the Cards shattered.
Among other things, this scrappy Stanford five knocked off a
powerful Washington club which holds victories over both California
tthe Bears' lone conference loss) and UCLA. The Fighting Indians
battled California all the way in to overtime, in fact had them beaten,
before dropping the biggest heart breaker of them all. They gamely
battled a steady UCLA twice before falling in the final minutes to
the Bruins' height and depth.
Bill Bond, who iv very likely to step into that 1000-niark circle
tonight, will be the most sorely missed of the five graduating sen
iors. Bill's jump shots have singed the nets of every Pacific ( oust
ConfeiMice pavilion in the past three years. In addition his hustle
and ball stealing have played important roles in all of the Card
Victories this 1 year.
Carl Isaacs and captain I lap Wagner, the other graduating
starters, are perfect examples of what hustle can. do. "Ike" was
the leagues shortest center, but he didn't let that faze him. Ilap
held the team together and set np many baskets for his teammates.
These men will he missed, but the future looks bright. Paul Neu
mann has lived up to fondest expectations and will be around for two
more years. Dick Haga, up against the same kind of odds Isaacs was
up against, is one of the conference's top shooters and rebounders
as a sophomore. A third soph, John Pflueger, has been a very valu
able "sixth man" and has shown plenty of scoring punch.
Next year's club may have a little of that precious height Stan
foul has needed for so long. Lee Leonard, 6-8, was a most pleasant
surprise and promises to develop even more before next season.
The Indian frosh club, the top yearling team in this area, can con
tribute men like 0-7 Jerry Thuesen, a dead-eye shot who topped the
Papooses in scoring; 0-8 Neal Broekmeyer; spring-legged Marion
Keyes, and Chris Burford, the 6-3 football end who was Ihe rebound
leader. "
In the opposite direction there are 6-2 Mike Tipton, 6-0 Rich
Thompson and 5-7 John Stabler, the Papoose sparkplugs. Dean
Prince, .1-9, ineligible this quarter, showed great promise with the
frosh at the first of the year and could be around to help next season.
And then there are Doug Warren, a varsity sophomore who has
been seeing more action in recent games, and John Arrillaga, mem
ber of last year's freshmen Who did not play this year. Arrillaga,
brother of California's star guard, Gabe, has looked good in intra
squad games and adds valuable height.
But next year is a long way off. Bond steps down alter taking
Ids place among Stanford's all-timers while Neumann has a good
start on his KMX) points. Tonight there is an unpredictable Idaho
team to worry about. It's been a tough, sad season, but those
experts who had the Cards iu the cellar were way off base.
California takes on UCLA tonight and tomoirow night in a pair
of games which should decide the PCC title.
Southern California's upset win over UCLA Tuesday night has
put Cal in Ihe favorites' role, but local opinion had the Bears rated
on lop, anyway.
Coach Pete Newell .s boys should be a worthy representative for
the PCC in NCAA competition. San Francisco, an early season victor
over the Bears, and St. Mary's, an early season victim of Stanford,
are battling for the California Intercollegiate Basketball loop crown
and the right to meet tlie Bears in the regional tourney at Corvallis.
Also in that fray will he Idaho State, a small school which is cur
rently ranked 15th in the country.
But Coast fans will never get to see a match between Cal and
the fourth-ranked Seattle Chieftains'. Seattle, aiming for national
headlines for its phenomenal sophomore, Klgin Baylor, has ac
cepted a bid to play in Madison Square Garden's National Invihit
tion tournament instead of the NCAA.

Three months of anxious moments and heartbreaks come to a

last game of the 1956-57 season. It's been a disappointing year in

powerful Washington club which holds victories over both California
tthe Bears' lone conference loss) and UCLA. The Fighting Indians
battled California all the way in to overtime, in fact had them beaten,
before dropping the biggest heart breaker of them all. They gamely
battled a steady UCLA twice before falling in the final minutes to
the Bruins' height and depth.

Three months of anxious moments and heartbreaks come to a
close tomorrow night when the Stanford basketball team plays its
last game of the 1956-57 season. It's been a disappointing year in
many respects, but probably the most disappointed were the experts,
who saw their prophecy of a last-place finish for the Cards shattered.
Among other things, this scrappy Stanford five knocked off a
powerful Washington club which holds victories over both California
tthe Bears' lone conference loss) and UCLA. The Fighting Indians
battled California all the way in to overtime, in fact had them beaten,
before dropping the biggest heart breaker of them all. They gamely
battled a steady UCLA twice before falling in the final minutes to
the Bruins' height and depth.
Bill Bond, who iv very likely to step into that 1000-niark circle
tonight, will be the most sorely missed of the five graduating sen
iors. Bill's jump shots have singed the nets of every Pacific ( oust
ConfeiMice pavilion in the past three years. In addition his hustle
and ball stealing have played important roles in all of the Card
Victories this 1 year.
Carl Isaacs and captain I lap Wagner, the other graduating
starters, are perfect examples of what hustle can. do. "Ike" was
the leagues shortest center, but he didn't let that faze him. Ilap
held the team together and set np many baskets for his teammates.
These men will he missed, but the future looks bright. Paul Neu
mann has lived up to fondest expectations and will be around for two
more years. Dick Haga, up against the same kind of odds Isaacs was
up against, is one of the conference's top shooters and rebounders
as a sophomore. A third soph, John Pflueger, has been a very valu
able "sixth man" and has shown plenty of scoring punch.
Next year's club may have a little of that precious height Stan
foul has needed for so long. Lee Leonard, 6-8, was a most pleasant
surprise and promises to develop even more before next season.
The Indian frosh club, the top yearling team in this area, can con
tribute men like 0-7 Jerry Thuesen, a dead-eye shot who topped the
Papooses in scoring; 0-8 Neal Broekmeyer; spring-legged Marion
Keyes, and Chris Burford, the 6-3 football end who was Ihe rebound
leader. "
In the opposite direction there are 6-2 Mike Tipton, 6-0 Rich
Thompson and 5-7 John Stabler, the Papoose sparkplugs. Dean
Prince, .1-9, ineligible this quarter, showed great promise with the
frosh at the first of the year and could be around to help next season.
And then there are Doug Warren, a varsity sophomore who has
been seeing more action in recent games, and John Arrillaga, mem
ber of last year's freshmen Who did not play this year. Arrillaga,
brother of California's star guard, Gabe, has looked good in intra
squad games and adds valuable height.
But next year is a long way off. Bond steps down alter taking
Ids place among Stanford's all-timers while Neumann has a good
start on his KMX) points. Tonight there is an unpredictable Idaho
team to worry about. It's been a tough, sad season, but those
experts who had the Cards iu the cellar were way off base.
California takes on UCLA tonight and tomoirow night in a pair
of games which should decide the PCC title.
Southern California's upset win over UCLA Tuesday night has
put Cal in Ihe favorites' role, but local opinion had the Bears rated
on lop, anyway.
Coach Pete Newell .s boys should be a worthy representative for
the PCC in NCAA competition. San Francisco, an early season victor
over the Bears, and St. Mary's, an early season victim of Stanford,
are battling for the California Intercollegiate Basketball loop crown
and the right to meet tlie Bears in the regional tourney at Corvallis.
Also in that fray will he Idaho State, a small school which is cur
rently ranked 15th in the country.
But Coast fans will never get to see a match between Cal and
the fourth-ranked Seattle Chieftains'. Seattle, aiming for national
headlines for its phenomenal sophomore, Klgin Baylor, has ac
cepted a bid to play in Madison Square Garden's National Invihit
tion tournament instead of the NCAA.
Kansas can have its Wilt Chamberlain and North Carolina its
l.ennie Rosen bin th. Baylor is my choice for the nation's outstand
ing collegiate eager.
