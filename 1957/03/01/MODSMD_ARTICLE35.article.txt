## Last Action for Trio of Starters; Record is 10-14 
### Dick Barnes 
Howie Dallmar's Stanford In
dians will try »to close out the
1956 -57 basic*'!hall season with a
j>aii of wins when they meet Ida
ho's Vandals in a two-game set
at Moscow tonight and tomorrow.
( higinally picked to occupy the
Pacific Coast Conference cellar,
the Cards have surprised the ex
perts all season long. With just
the two games remaining, the In
dians have a good grip on fifth
place as they sport a 6-8 PCC
record.
During the over-all season Stan
lord has won 10 while dropping
14. Dallmar's club dropped an
opener to San Jose State, then
nipped St. Mary's and Rice in a
pair of thrillers. The Tribe lost
lour of six on a holiday road trip
through the South, but looked im
pressive even in its losing efforts.
The Indians' remaining non
conference loss came at the hands
of Santa Clara in a game that
found Stanford at a low ebb after
they had lost an overtime battle
to Cal the previous night.
Three Stanford starters — Bill
Bond, Carl Isaacs and captain
Hap Wagner will be playing
their last games for the Indians.
Bond Leads Scorers
Bond has been the top point*
producer all through the season
and now finds himself on the
threshold of hitting the 1000-point
mark for his entire collegiate ca
reer. The (>-1 forward needs just
13 points to hit his goal, and
stands a good chance to make it
in tonight's game.
In conference play, Bond has
scored at a rate of 15.9 points per
game, the fifth best mark in the
PCC. He stands second in total
points with 26-1 and is second in
field goals with 97. Throughout
the entire season he has scored
an even 400 points.
Isaacs, although standing only
0-3, has held his own against some
of the biggest men on the West
Coast, lie was unable to play in
any pre-season games due to his
appearance in the Shrine football
game.
After quickly getting his bas
ketball legs into shape, Isaacs
came into the Washington game
and proceeded to lead the Indians
to a 70-()3 victory a game which
ranks as one of the biggest up
sets of the PCC season.
With that game Isaacs nailed
down the starting center berth
and has performed well ever
since. He has lipped his scoring
average to 10 points each game,
with a season total of 130 points.
Wagner Sparks Club
The job of leading the Stanford
floor game has been done all year
by 1 he scrappy Wagner. His con
slant harassing of opposing ball
handlers has given the Indians
many an opportunity to capitalize
on mistakes of l}ie other team.
Point-wise, Wagner has contrib
uted about eight a game. He has
been the Indians' most deadly
shooter from the free-throw line,
bucketing 49 of 00, or better than
81 per cent. Wagner's biggest of
fensive night was against Wash
ington State, when he broke loose
to score 1!) points, the high mark
of his collegiate career.
The remaining two spots in
Dallmar's starting lineup will be

manned by a pair of sophomores,
Paid Neumann and Dick Haga.
Before the season began, Neu
mann was rated as the best young
prospect Stanford had seen in
some time. After a full season
of play, there are no longer any
doubts that Neumann Is well on
the way to a brilliant basketball
career with the Indians.
Neumann appears to be playing
with iced water in his veins, never
becoming rattled and seemingly
never tiring. He has been hitting
for better than 12 points a game
and last Friday scored 24 against
USC. Neumann, of course, is fig
ured as one of the real keys to
Tribe teams of ihe next two years.
Stanford's leading rebounder
and another of its bright pros
pects for the next two years has
been Haga. He has pulled the
ball off the boards 88 times and
is helping the offense with an 8.5
average.
Sharing the forward duties with
Haga will he Lee Leonard, tallest

man on the Stanford team. Leon
ard has been bothered by a bad
ankle, so Dallmar may rest him
until Saturday's game.
Vandals Rugged
Although managing only a 3 11
record in PCC play this season,
the Vandals are a rugged team,
particularly in the friendly con
fines of their home gym. Included
in their II setbacks are a pair of
one-point losses to UCLA and sev
eral other narrow defeats.
Gary Simmons, who missed the
first eight PCC games with an
injury, is the leader of the Idaho
attack. His bctter-t han-16 - point
average has been helped greatly
by tremendous shooting at the
foul line. Simmons has tossed in
40 of 42 free throws to lead the
PCC.
Other starters for Ihe Vandals
are expected to be Gary McEwen,
Bill Wilson, Hal Damiano and
Whaylen Coleman, with Jerry
Jorgensen and Jim Branom also
set to see plenty of action.


TWO OF THK BEST —Bill Bond (10), Stanford scorer who
aims for his lOOOili point as an Indian tonight, drives m for a lay-in
in last year's Idaho game with the Vandals' ace performer, Gary
Simmons (6), in pursuit. This* pair lead their teams into action as
both clubs close the 1956-57 season.

for better than 12 points a game
and last Friday scored 24 against
USC. Neumann, of course, is fig
ured as one of the real keys to
Tribe teams of ihe next two years.
Stanford's leading rebounder
and another of its bright pros
pects for the next two years has
been Haga. He has pulled the
ball off the boards 88 times and
is helping the offense with an 8.5
average.
Sharing the forward duties with
Haga will he Lee Leonard, tallest

man on the Stanford team. Leon
ard has been bothered by a bad
ankle, so Dallmar may rest him
until Saturday's game.
Vandals Rugged
Although managing only a 3 11
record in PCC play this season,
the Vandals are a rugged team,
particularly in the friendly con
fines of their home gym. Included
in their II setbacks are a pair of
one-point losses to UCLA and sev
eral other narrow defeats.
Gary Simmons, who missed the
first eight PCC games with an
injury, is the leader of the Idaho
attack. His bctter-t han-16 - point
average has been helped greatly
by tremendous shooting at the
foul line. Simmons has tossed in
40 of 42 free throws to lead the
PCC.
Other starters for Ihe Vandals
are expected to be Gary McEwen,
Bill Wilson, Hal Damiano and
Whaylen Coleman, with Jerry
Jorgensen and Jim Branom also
set to see plenty of action.


TWO OF THK BEST —Bill Bond (10), Stanford scorer who
aims for his lOOOili point as an Indian tonight, drives m for a lay-in
in last year's Idaho game with the Vandals' ace performer, Gary
Simmons (6), in pursuit. This* pair lead their teams into action as
both clubs close the 1956-57 season.
Howie Dallmar's Stanford In
dians will try »to close out the
1956 -57 basic*'!hall season with a
j>aii of wins when they meet Ida
ho's Vandals in a two-game set
at Moscow tonight and tomorrow.
( higinally picked to occupy the
Pacific Coast Conference cellar,
the Cards have surprised the ex
perts all season long. With just
the two games remaining, the In
dians have a good grip on fifth
place as they sport a 6-8 PCC
record.
During the over-all season Stan
lord has won 10 while dropping
14. Dallmar's club dropped an
opener to San Jose State, then
nipped St. Mary's and Rice in a
pair of thrillers. The Tribe lost
lour of six on a holiday road trip
through the South, but looked im
pressive even in its losing efforts.
The Indians' remaining non
conference loss came at the hands
of Santa Clara in a game that
found Stanford at a low ebb after
they had lost an overtime battle
to Cal the previous night.
Three Stanford starters — Bill
Bond, Carl Isaacs and captain
Hap Wagner will be playing
their last games for the Indians.
Bond Leads Scorers
Bond has been the top point*
producer all through the season
and now finds himself on the
threshold of hitting the 1000-point
mark for his entire collegiate ca
reer. The (>-1 forward needs just
13 points to hit his goal, and
stands a good chance to make it
in tonight's game.
In conference play, Bond has
scored at a rate of 15.9 points per
game, the fifth best mark in the
PCC. He stands second in total
points with 26-1 and is second in
field goals with 97. Throughout
the entire season he has scored
an even 400 points.
Isaacs, although standing only
0-3, has held his own against some
of the biggest men on the West
Coast, lie was unable to play in
any pre-season games due to his
appearance in the Shrine football
game.
After quickly getting his bas
ketball legs into shape, Isaacs
came into the Washington game
and proceeded to lead the Indians
to a 70-()3 victory a game which
ranks as one of the biggest up
sets of the PCC season.
With that game Isaacs nailed
down the starting center berth
and has performed well ever
since. He has lipped his scoring
average to 10 points each game,
with a season total of 130 points.
Wagner Sparks Club
The job of leading the Stanford
floor game has been done all year
by 1 he scrappy Wagner. His con
slant harassing of opposing ball
handlers has given the Indians
many an opportunity to capitalize
on mistakes of l}ie other team.
Point-wise, Wagner has contrib
uted about eight a game. He has
been the Indians' most deadly
shooter from the free-throw line,
bucketing 49 of 00, or better than
81 per cent. Wagner's biggest of
fensive night was against Wash
ington State, when he broke loose
to score 1!) points, the high mark
of his collegiate career.
The remaining two spots in
Dallmar's starting lineup will be

manned by a pair of sophomores,
Paid Neumann and Dick Haga.
Before the season began, Neu
mann was rated as the best young
prospect Stanford had seen in
some time. After a full season
of play, there are no longer any
doubts that Neumann Is well on
the way to a brilliant basketball
career with the Indians.
Neumann appears to be playing
with iced water in his veins, never
becoming rattled and seemingly
never tiring. He has been hitting
for better than 12 points a game
and last Friday scored 24 against
USC. Neumann, of course, is fig

any pre-season games due to his
appearance in the Shrine football
game.
After quickly getting his bas
ketball legs into shape, Isaacs
came into the Washington game
and proceeded to lead the Indians
to a 70-()3 victory a game which
ranks as one of the biggest up
sets of the PCC season.
With that game Isaacs nailed
down the starting center berth
and has performed well ever
since. He has lipped his scoring
average to 10 points each game,
with a season total of 130 points.
Wagner Sparks Club
The job of leading the Stanford
floor game has been done all year
by 1 he scrappy Wagner. His con
slant harassing of opposing ball
handlers has given the Indians
many an opportunity to capitalize
on mistakes of l}ie other team.
Point-wise, Wagner has contrib
uted about eight a game. He has
been the Indians' most deadly
shooter from the free-throw line,
bucketing 49 of 00, or better than
81 per cent. Wagner's biggest of
fensive night was against Wash
ington State, when he broke loose
to score 1!) points, the high mark
of his collegiate career.
The remaining two spots in
Dallmar's starting lineup will be

manned by a pair of sophomores,
Paid Neumann and Dick Haga.
Before the season began, Neu
mann was rated as the best young
prospect Stanford had seen in
some time. After a full season
of play, there are no longer any
doubts that Neumann Is well on
the way to a brilliant basketball
career with the Indians.
Neumann appears to be playing
with iced water in his veins, never
becoming rattled and seemingly
never tiring. He has been hitting
for better than 12 points a game
and last Friday scored 24 against
USC. Neumann, of course, is fig
ured as one of the real keys to
Tribe teams of ihe next two years.
Stanford's leading rebounder
and another of its bright pros
pects for the next two years has
been Haga. He has pulled the
ball off the boards 88 times and
is helping the offense with an 8.5
average.
Sharing the forward duties with
Haga will he Lee Leonard, tallest

man on the Stanford team. Leon
ard has been bothered by a bad
ankle, so Dallmar may rest him
until Saturday's game.
Vandals Rugged
Although managing only a 3 11
record in PCC play this season,
the Vandals are a rugged team,
particularly in the friendly con
fines of their home gym. Included
in their II setbacks are a pair of
one-point losses to UCLA and sev
eral other narrow defeats.
Gary Simmons, who missed the
first eight PCC games with an
injury, is the leader of the Idaho
attack. His bctter-t han-16 - point
average has been helped greatly
by tremendous shooting at the
foul line. Simmons has tossed in
40 of 42 free throws to lead the
PCC.
Other starters for Ihe Vandals
are expected to be Gary McEwen,
Bill Wilson, Hal Damiano and
Whaylen Coleman, with Jerry
Jorgensen and Jim Branom also
set to see plenty of action.


TWO OF THK BEST —Bill Bond (10), Stanford scorer who
aims for his lOOOili point as an Indian tonight, drives m for a lay-in
in last year's Idaho game with the Vandals' ace performer, Gary
Simmons (6), in pursuit. This* pair lead their teams into action as
both clubs close the 1956-57 season.
Howie Dallmar's Stanford In
dians will try »to close out the
1956 -57 basic*'!hall season with a
j>aii of wins when they meet Ida
ho's Vandals in a two-game set
at Moscow tonight and tomorrow.
( higinally picked to occupy the
Pacific Coast Conference cellar,
the Cards have surprised the ex
perts all season long. With just
the two games remaining, the In
dians have a good grip on fifth
place as they sport a 6-8 PCC
record.
During the over-all season Stan
lord has won 10 while dropping
14. Dallmar's club dropped an
opener to San Jose State, then
nipped St. Mary's and Rice in a
pair of thrillers. The Tribe lost
lour of six on a holiday road trip
through the South, but looked im
pressive even in its losing efforts.
The Indians' remaining non
conference loss came at the hands
of Santa Clara in a game that
found Stanford at a low ebb after
they had lost an overtime battle
to Cal the previous night.
Three Stanford starters — Bill
Bond, Carl Isaacs and captain
Hap Wagner will be playing
their last games for the Indians.
Bond Leads Scorers
Bond has been the top point*
producer all through the season
and now finds himself on the
threshold of hitting the 1000-point
mark for his entire collegiate ca
reer. The (>-1 forward needs just
13 points to hit his goal, and
stands a good chance to make it
in tonight's game.
In conference play, Bond has
scored at a rate of 15.9 points per
game, the fifth best mark in the
PCC. He stands second in total
points with 26-1 and is second in
field goals with 97. Throughout
the entire season he has scored
an even 400 points.
Isaacs, although standing only
0-3, has held his own against some
of the biggest men on the West
Coast, lie was unable to play in
any pre-season games due to his
