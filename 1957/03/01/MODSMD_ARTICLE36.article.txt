George Selleck in all-time stand
ing.
Tomsic Tops
Rpn Tomsic, (he Olympic cage
star, is the greatest all-time Caul
scorer, having poured 1110 points
through the hoop in his career.
Hank Luisetti, who is called by
many the greatest basketball

Tomsic with the 1297 points he
scored in 1936-38 when he revolu
tionized the game with the one
hand shot.
Last season Selleck, recent win- i

those final points coming as he
calmly sank two free throws to
defeat California in overtime at
the Pavilion.
Bond will get there this week. |
