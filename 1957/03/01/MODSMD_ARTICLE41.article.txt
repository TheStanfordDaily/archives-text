## 
### 
Coach Dutch Fehring's varsity
baseball nine hopes to open th»*
1957 season tomorrow on the var
i sity field in a double-header with
I Cal Poly. But recent weal her con
ditions have made the outlook
anything but certain.
The Cards have had two games
slated so far this season and bolh
! were rained out. This week's
(game with San Jose Slate has
1 been rescheduled for next Mon
day and has forced Fehring to do
some fancy juggling with his
pitchers,
George Avery and Ed Verdur
men are expected to open on the
mound for Stanford in tomor
row's pair with Cal Poly. Both
tare slated for six - inning stints
when they will be relieved by
| Waly Miller and Dick Smith, re
: spectively. Miller is a transfer
| from Menlo JC.
Veterans Walt Payne and Dick
! Jones will go against the Spar-
I tans on Monday.
Fehring's starting lineup to
morrow is expected to be: lb, Hal
Messner; 2b, AI Shaw; 3b, Rudy
j Figueroa; ss, Steve Stewart; If,
: Rich DeFabio; ef, Bob Fleicher;
j rf, AI Spurgeon; c, Ralph Hold
ing.
The infield is expected to be
strongpoint of this year's club.
; Pigueroa and Holding won All-
Conference honors last season,
j Cal Poly is touted as having a
good ball club with Ed Malson an
outstanding pitcher. Owen Hand
tops the slugging corps that will
be .out to batter Card flingers.
The JV's, who have managed

to get in one game, a 3-2 win over
San Francisco City College, are
scheduled to meet Oakland JC
this afternoon on the freshman
field. Tomorrow the Braves take
on an always tough Santa Rosa
JC nine and Monday will be up
against Menlo.
All of Hie games, it I hey ever
take place, are slated for 1:30.
