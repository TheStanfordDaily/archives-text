# 2-Mile Atom Unit Planned By Stanford
## Multi-Billion-Electron Linear Accelerator In Speculative Stage 
### 
Plans arc now being formulated
to build a multi-billion electron
volt linear accelerator about two
miles long in the foothills, ac
cording tr> University Provost
Frederick K. Terman.
Project M, dubbed for the mam
moth multi-BEV accelerator, is
still in the "highly speculative"
stage, Terman said. No negotia
tions have yet been made with
the government.
An Atomic Energy Commission
official in Oakland said some dis
cussion has been held on the pos
sibility, but no further details
were provided.
10 BEV Class
The proposed linear accelerator
will probably be in the 10-BEV
class. The present accelerator on
campus is a 700 million-volt ma
chine, the largest of its kind in
the world.
Location of the accelerator will
be in the general area between
the golf course and a point south
of the quarry on Page Mill Road.
Project M will be housed below
ground and probably in two tun
nels, Terman said—one tunnel for
the accelerator and the other for
auxiliary equi pment.
The study will be completed this
summer, when reports will be
made to various government
agencies such as the AEC.
"Electron Bullets"
Terman salcf that about a half
dozen high-voltage machines foi
st udy of high-energy physics are
being considered around the Unit
ed States. Stanford's is the only
linear accelerator which will
shoot "electron bullets."
Project M is being formulated
by Stanford's high-energy physics
staff of professors Edward L.
Cm/ton. Wolfgang K. H. Panof
sky and Robert Hofstadter. Ginz
ton plans the construction, while
Panofsky and Hofstadter operate
the machine for experimental
purposes.
Interest in high-voltage physics
was spur re d last year when
American scientists visited Rus
sia and discovered the high in
terest there. Panofsky was among
the visitors.
