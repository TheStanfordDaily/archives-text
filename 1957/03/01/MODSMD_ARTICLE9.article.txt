# Canon Green's 4-Day Visit to Begin Sunday; Clergyman Drew 20,000 at Last Campus Visit

### Pete Grothe 
Canon Bryan Green, who begins
his four-day visit at Stanford on
Sunday, is one of the most ex
traordinary and unorthodox
figures on the contemporary re
ligious scene.
The world - renowned English

clergyman is not unorthodox in
his Christianity, as is evidenced
by the fact that Protestant and
Catholic chaplains urged their
various denominations to hear
Canon Green when he was here
in 1954. But if Canon Green is
orthodox in his Christianity, he
is piercingly unorthodox in bis
presentation of that Christianity.
Here are some examples:
Canon Green was once invited
to address the 25th anniversary
meeting of the Methodists' Sun
day Afternoon Club in Dudley,
England. Unlike most speakers
who begin their talks with state
ments like "It's an honor for me
to be here today," Canon Green
said: "First of all, I must say
that 1 thoroughly abominate Sun
day afternoon church meetings.
It seems to me that every good
Englishman should be taking a
nap after the Sunday noon meal
and not going to a stuffy church
meeting."
During a talk at a factory a
Communist, worker continued to
heckle Canon Green, who at first
tried to ignore him and then
found him unignorable.
The heckler shouted, "What are
you trying to do anyway—ram
religion down our throats?"
Canon Green paused a moment
and then answered, "Yes."

Canon Green, who is generally
regarded ;<s "the outstanding ora
tor- in the Anglican church" (Epis
copal and Church of England),
was giving a sermon in his parish
at Birmingham several months
.'go when a drunk started to climb
into the pulpit. Most ministers
would have been benumbed by
such an experience, but not Ca
non Green.
lie pointed his finger in the

drunk's face and saici: "Now, lis
ten here, my dear fellow, there's
only one of us who can do the
talking, and 1 am going to do it,
and you are going to sit down
and listen! Now, sit down and i
listen."
The drunk did.
Known for his fort brightness.
Canon Green once said from the
pulpit of a very wealthy Boston
church which he had learned was
hypocritical, "I think that. Christ
should hate to be in this church."
One of the most widely • told
stories about Canon Green con
cerns his meeting with Ihe League
of Atheists at Columbia Univer
sity. The rector of Birmingham
maintains: "1 much prefer talk
ing to atheists and agnostics. It's
no fun if everyone sits around
agreeing with each other."
Canon Green later had a num
ber of discussions with the presi
dent of the League of At heists,
and, explained Canon Green, "it
turned out that the president de
cided to become a Christian. Most
disconcerting to the League of
Atheists, you know—-they had to
get a new president."
Canon Green—who is booked
up through 1959—has spoken to
turn-away crowds all over the
world. The former Oxford Uni
versity chaplain spoke to crowds
totaling more than 20.000 in his
last five-day visit to Stanford.
