# SAE Lion Dies Valiantly
## 
### 
Going out valiantly, in full
white dress, Leo, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon's concrete linn, met a
violent death at the hands of un
known assassins at 3:17 a.m.
Friday.
The concrete beast was blown
to bits by pranksters who plant
ed a dynamite bomb between his
paws. The blast wakened 30
residents of the fraternity house
at 521 Lasuen St. but no one
was injured.
Small pieces of Leo were scat
tered over a 50-foot area but
most of him "just sort of fell
apart" in place.
The explosion shattered srven
windows in the post office
across the street and three in
the fraternity house. Police
Chief Gordon Davis said the fed

eral government may launch an
investigation, in view of the
damage to federal property.
Police don't know who planted
the bomb, but said two suspects
who were seen on the lawn
about 2:40 a.m. appeared to be
students.
Leo had served as the SAE's
"watch lion" for 10 years. His
strategic location in the front
lawn had made him a frequent
target for raiders armed with
various colors of paint.
Bruce Blake, house president,
said SAE men always had re
painted Leo white after a raid.
He was wearing a white coat
when he "met his death" Friday.
Two weeks ago, Blake said,
SAE barely thwarted an attempt
to demolish Leo by converting

him into a block of concrete.
Someone built a form around
Leo and filled it with concrete
during the night.
"Luckily," Blake said, "we
found out before the concrete
set."
Funeral services were held at
noon Friday in front of the SAE
house. Following a simple and
quiet service in the presence of
every SAE member and a few
guests, Leo was laid to rest
under a cypress tree beside the
big white house.
This memorial was posted:
"Leo the Lion, born March 5,
1892. died March 1, 1957—Blast
ed into Immortality." The birth
date, of course, was just a
guess.
The bereaved brothers request
that no flowers be sent. "Dona

tions of money or lions will be
accepted," house spokesmen said
in a letter to The Daily.
The fraternity house would
like to replace its concrete
guardian, according to Blake.
"Maybe we'll start a campaign
to get people to donate one to
us." he said.
A University spokesman, de
scribing the wreckage Friday,
explained that the explosive was
undoubtedly of a conventional
type. He declared, "This was not
a test of a new atom gun."
According to two widely dif
fering stories, the SAE's ac
quired Leo from either a bank
rupt "Hollywood-type" gas sta
tion in the East Bay or an or
nately decorated Peninsula
building which was torn down.

Bruce Blake, house president,
said SAE men always had re
painted Leo white after a raid.
He was wearing a white coat
when he "met his death" Friday.
Two weeks ago, Blake said,
SAE barely thwarted an attempt
to demolish Leo by converting

him into a block of concrete.
Someone built a form around
Leo and filled it with concrete
during the night.
"Luckily," Blake said, "we
found out before the concrete
set."
Funeral services were held at
noon Friday in front of the SAE
house. Following a simple and
quiet service in the presence of
every SAE member and a few
guests, Leo was laid to rest
under a cypress tree beside the
big white house.
This memorial was posted:
"Leo the Lion, born March 5,
1892. died March 1, 1957—Blast
ed into Immortality." The birth
date, of course, was just a
guess.
The bereaved brothers request
that no flowers be sent. "Dona

tions of money or lions will be
accepted," house spokesmen said
in a letter to The Daily.
The fraternity house would
like to replace its concrete
guardian, according to Blake.
"Maybe we'll start a campaign
to get people to donate one to
us." he said.
A University spokesman, de
scribing the wreckage Friday,
explained that the explosive was
undoubtedly of a conventional
type. He declared, "This was not
a test of a new atom gun."
According to two widely dif
fering stories, the SAE's ac
quired Leo from either a bank
rupt "Hollywood-type" gas sta
tion in the East Bay or an or
nately decorated Peninsula
building which was torn down.


Tin; REMAINS OF SAE'S LEO (CENTER INSET) VVEItE LAID TO REST AT SOLEMN RITES FRIDAY
Going out valiantly, in full
white dress, Leo, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon's concrete linn, met a
violent death at the hands of un
known assassins at 3:17 a.m.
Friday.
The concrete beast was blown
to bits by pranksters who plant
ed a dynamite bomb between his
paws. The blast wakened 30
residents of the fraternity house
at 521 Lasuen St. but no one
was injured.
Small pieces of Leo were scat
tered over a 50-foot area but
most of him "just sort of fell
apart" in place.
The explosion shattered srven
windows in the post office
across the street and three in
the fraternity house. Police
Chief Gordon Davis said the fed

eral government may launch an
investigation, in view of the
damage to federal property.
Police don't know who planted
the bomb, but said two suspects
who were seen on the lawn
about 2:40 a.m. appeared to be
students.
Leo had served as the SAE's
"watch lion" for 10 years. His
strategic location in the front
lawn had made him a frequent
target for raiders armed with
various colors of paint.
