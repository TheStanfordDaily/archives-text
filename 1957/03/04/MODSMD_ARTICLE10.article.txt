# Baroque Song Concert Given Here Sunday
## High Point of Program Work by Charpentier, Several Small Solos 
### Bob Christiansen 
Yesterday's chamber music con
cert in Cubberley Auditorium was
probably one of the most enjoy
able to be given all year. The
program of Baroque music was a
well-chosen representation of this
period.
The program started off on a
high level with the Symphonia
Sacra No. 3, "In te Domine spe
ravi," by Heinrich Schuetz, very
capably performed by Janis Wil
cox, contralto, Elizabeth Van
Vorst, violin, John Kolarik, trom
bone, and Putnam Aldrich, harp
sichord.
Miss Wilcox' voice was warm
and exceptionally suited to the
style. She excelled in a fine un
derstanding of the music and the
style, as well as in sheer vocal
skill. The instrumentalists per
formed very well together, and in
great complement to the singer.
Small Solos
Claudio Monteverdi's charming
madrigal, "Vago Augelletto," was
very capably performed by the
Stanford Chorale under the direc
tion of Harold Schmidt. Espe
cially outstanding in the numer
ous small solos in the work were
Roberta Grant, Janis Wilcox. Rob
ert MacKinnon, Ted Toews and
A 1 Reid.
The Concerto for Violin and
Orchestra in A minor of J. S.
Bach was played by Gloria Vial,
with members of the Stanford
Symphony under the capable di
rection of Sandor Salgo. Gloria
Vial played the concerto with a
fine command of her instrument.
Unfortunately in one or two small
places one had the feeling that
not quite enough rehearsal time
had been expended on the work.
However, these places were small
and far between. Most outstand
ing was the lovely second move
ment, beautifully played by Miss
Vial.
Program Highlight
Probably the highlight of the
program was "The Denial of St.
Peter" by Marc-Antoine Charpen
tier. The chorale showed up es
pecially well in the "Non te nega
mus" chorus. Also very well done
was the quartet sung by Roberta
Grant, Janis Wilcox, Richard
Storrs and Robert MacKinnon.
Providing some very fine solo
work were Richard Storrs, tenor,
as Peter, and Harold Schmidt,
tenor, as Jesus. Sandor Salgo
showed a fine insight into the
work in his excellent conducting.
Again at the harpsichord, Put
nam Aldrich did an outstanding
job. He was ably assisted by Cur
tis Givan, cellist. And especially
outstanding in the part of Histori
cus was Theodore Toews.
