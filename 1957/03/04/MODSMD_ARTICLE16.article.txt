# Quality in Candidates
## 
### 
Nominations or rc todai for A SSI i and class
officers. We, of course, hope for a larger turn
out than last year, when there was a record
low of 5] candidates for 27 offices. But a large
number of candidates is Useless unless they
have something constructive to offer the stu
dent body.
Greater competition would force a candidate
to come forth with a constructive program
rather than sliding into office, as many un
opposed candidates did last spring.
But we would rather see lens candidates run
if those who ran had well-thought-out plat
forms as to how they would make student gov
ernment a more useful body.
.Many people have said: "How do you expect
student government ever to improve with the
type of people who always run? All you <ret.
i- a hunch of supposed red-hots who actually
do nothing. 1 '
the answer to this complaint is, of course,
'hat if you don't like the type of person who
>ui)s, then run yourself.
.Student government at Stanford has not
lived up to its potentialities. It. could have
acted as a powerful voice in such problems as
*ti dent drinking, academics, relations with the

administration's policy; it has done none of
these things.
It could act as a moving force in developing
the lot of the individual student, representing
his interests in developing and practicing in
' dividualism on campus.
"We don't want an individualist as editor
of The Daily," said a member of Legislature
last Wednesday. As long as this attitude toward
individualism prevails, Legislature has fallen
fare short of its potentialities.
Under the new election setup, each candi
date will be given ample time to formulate a
constructive program. Nominations close Fri
day. \o campaigning will be allowed until the
first day of spring quarter registration.
This will give the candidate three weeks to
think seriously about what he can do with the
office he is running for and to come up with
some dynamic ideas. Campaigning in the first
week will give the candidate time, unhampered
by studies, to he able to present his ideas to
his constituents.
No matter how good the election procedure
is, nothing will come of it unless thoughtful,
qualified candidates take advantage of it.
It would be a great thing for Stanford if
thev did.
