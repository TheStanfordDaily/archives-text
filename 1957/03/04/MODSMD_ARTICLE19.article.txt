# INTERN SCHOLARSHIPS
## Public Affairs Foundation Teaches City Management 
### Rich Brown 
Want to learn how to be a city
manager? how to codify city or
dinances? how to deal with pub
lic problems such as alcoholism?
Coro Foundation, a nonprofit
public trust organized to promote
public affairs leadership and bet
ter government, each year teaches
! 12 college graduates by an actual
experience plan.
Coro, organized under Califor
j nia law, receives its income from
grants by individuals, corpora
tions, labor organizations and
; foundations. From these grants,
i each of the 12 "interns" is given
. a subsistence scholarship ranging
from $1500 to $2000.
Offers One-Year Course
The foundation offers a one
year course which lists from Sep
tember to June. It does not offer
a degree, although some universi
ties such as Stanford have count
ed work with Coro as satisfying j
part of the master's requirement.
Eligibility for Coro grants is
not determined by college major. |
, The only real requirements are
interest, leadership ability and
sound character.
Coro study areas are divided
into four main classifications: i
government, politics, business and
labor. Foundation headquarters
are in San Francisco, and it is in
Bay Area cities that Coro scholars
do their work.
Interns Assigned
Examples of government and
business organizations to which
interns are assigned are district j
attorneys' offices, public welfare
departments, U.S. Customs of
fices, Matson Lines, E. F. Hut ton
& Co. and KGO-TV. Interns also
visit labor councils and study var-!
ious locals in Bay Area labor'
: organizations.
"The object is not class lectures
but first-hand observation," said
j Katie Blickhahn, Coro in t e r n
i from UCLA, who is currently vis
| iting Stanford. "We learn by in
terviewing top-level men in these
) four areas—discussing their func
j tions, problems and some of the
i issues with which they are faced."
j She pointed out how Coro i
scholars actually worked with po-'
i litical candidates in the last elec- j
tion.
Public Service Projects
Interns are currently undertak-i
ing individual public service proj
ects such as studying annexation- j
incorporation, preparing procedu !
rai manuals and promoting new i
civic centers for various Bay Area !
communities.
Other studies made as a group'

included the alcoholism problem
in San Francisco and atoms-for
peace developments in the Bay
Area. In studying atomic devel
opment, researchers looked for
the industries using atoms, how
atoms were used for medicine,
and public opinion.
Most study assignments are
given to two people who work
together. In many cases the re
ports made by scholars receive
national attention.
Not for Specific Jobs
"Coro training is not designed
for specific jobs," Miss Blickhahn
note ft. "However, cont a c Is
through Coro assignments often
lead to job offers in any of the
four areas of study."
Preliminary interviews for 1957-
58 Coro interns will be held in
the Stanford Placement Service
April 4. Additional information
may be obtained now from the
Placement Service, Miss Blick
hahn (in Union hall) or from the
Coro Foundation, 821 Market
Street, San Francisco 3.

Public Service Projects
Interns are currently undertak-i
ing individual public service proj
ects such as studying annexation- j
incorporation, preparing procedu !
rai manuals and promoting new i
civic centers for various Bay Area !
communities.
Other studies made as a group'

included the alcoholism problem
in San Francisco and atoms-for
peace developments in the Bay
Area. In studying atomic devel
opment, researchers looked for
the industries using atoms, how
atoms were used for medicine,
and public opinion.
Most study assignments are
given to two people who work
together. In many cases the re
ports made by scholars receive
national attention.
Not for Specific Jobs
"Coro training is not designed
for specific jobs," Miss Blickhahn
note ft. "However, cont a c Is
through Coro assignments often
lead to job offers in any of the
four areas of study."
Preliminary interviews for 1957-
58 Coro interns will be held in
the Stanford Placement Service
April 4. Additional information
may be obtained now from the
Placement Service, Miss Blick
hahn (in Union hall) or from the
Coro Foundation, 821 Market

Want to learn how to be a city
manager? how to codify city or
dinances? how to deal with pub
lic problems such as alcoholism?
Coro Foundation, a nonprofit
public trust organized to promote
public affairs leadership and bet
ter government, each year teaches
! 12 college graduates by an actual
experience plan.
Coro, organized under Califor
j nia law, receives its income from
grants by individuals, corpora
tions, labor organizations and
; foundations. From these grants,
i each of the 12 "interns" is given
. a subsistence scholarship ranging
from $1500 to $2000.
Offers One-Year Course
The foundation offers a one
year course which lists from Sep
tember to June. It does not offer
a degree, although some universi
ties such as Stanford have count
ed work with Coro as satisfying j
part of the master's requirement.
Eligibility for Coro grants is
not determined by college major. |
, The only real requirements are
interest, leadership ability and
sound character.
Coro study areas are divided
into four main classifications: i
government, politics, business and
labor. Foundation headquarters
are in San Francisco, and it is in
Bay Area cities that Coro scholars
do their work.
Interns Assigned
Examples of government and
business organizations to which
interns are assigned are district j
attorneys' offices, public welfare
departments, U.S. Customs of
fices, Matson Lines, E. F. Hut ton
& Co. and KGO-TV. Interns also
visit labor councils and study var-!
ious locals in Bay Area labor'
: organizations.
"The object is not class lectures
but first-hand observation," said
j Katie Blickhahn, Coro in t e r n
i from UCLA, who is currently vis
| iting Stanford. "We learn by in
terviewing top-level men in these
) four areas—discussing their func
j tions, problems and some of the
i issues with which they are faced."
j She pointed out how Coro i
scholars actually worked with po-'
i litical candidates in the last elec- j
tion.
