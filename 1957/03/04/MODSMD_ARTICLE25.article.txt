# Indian Basketballers Conclude Season With Cliffhanger Split Against Vandals
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford's Indians concluded
their 1956-57 basketball slate in
much the same manner they had
played it all season by both win
ning and losing in a pair of close
games at Idaho over the week
end.
The Vandals outlasted the Tribe
to win Friday's opener, 60-57. In
the final game of the year Stan
lord came from behind to win a
71-63 decision.
Although his team lost the
game, Bill Bond carved his name
on the list of Stanford basketball

| greats b£ breaking the 1000-point
! barrier in the opening tilt and
; moving into third plate on the
! all-time Indian scoring list.
He hit on eight field goals and
three foul tosses to run his career
total to 1006 points, one more
than George Selleck scored in the
1953-55 seasons. Bond added sev
en more points in Saturday's con
gest to reach a final total of 1013
points for three years of varsity
! play.
Win on Foul Shots
Stanford's second-game victory
came via the .free-throw route.
Although Idaho connected on 25
field goals to the Indians' 18—a
difference of 14 points—Stanford
j collected 35 points on charity toss
es to the host's 13. Howie Dall-
I mar's club missed only 10 foul
! shots to accumulate a hot 78 per
; cent average.
Idaho gradually built up a six
point half-time lead in the Satur
day encounter, 40-34. Stanford
i then came onto the court after
the intermission and proceeded to
rack up eight straight points. The
game remained nip-arid-tuck, with
Idaho trailing just 57-55 with less
| than five minutes to go.
A six-point burst sent the Tribe
ahead, 61-55, and the Vandals nev
; er got closer than four points in
j the remaining few minutes.
Dick Haga and captain Hap
Wagner led the Indians' offensive
drive, scoring particularly well
from the free-throw line. Haga
finished with a game high of 20
points, although hitting only four
field goals. Wagner also scored
on four shots from the floor and
added 10 single-pointers for a lo
ta 1 of 18 points;
Carl Isaacs managed to get
eight points before fouling out,
while Bond got the aforemention
ed seven. John Pflueger, Paul
Neumann and Gary Van Galder
each bucketed six.
Friday's Game Similar
Friday's game was almost ex
actly like Saturday's, with the
exception that the teams were re
versed. In this case it was Stan
j ford which held a narrow half
time lead and saw it disappear in
a second-half comeback by Idaho.
The defeated Indians put in
more field goals than the Van
dals, but Idaho was given more
chances at the foul line and scor
ed nine more one-pointers than
Stanford.
Indian scoring was confined to
the five starters.
The week-end split enabled the
Cards to finish FCC play with a

79 record—just about seven vic
tories better than pre-season ex
perts figured them to do. Stan
ford also cinched at least a "tie
for fifth place and will gain un
disputed control of the position
if Oregon State loses either of
its last two games.
On the season as a whole. Dall
mar's club won 11 while losing 15.
Included were victories over
Washington, still a contender for
the FCC crown; Ilice, a power
house of tne Southwest, and St.
Mary's, the surprise team of the
California Basketball Association.
