# PCC Postpones Decision On Aid-to-Athlete Rules
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., March 3 (UP)â€”The Pacific Coast Confer
ence searched without success today for ihe average student at
each of its nine member schools and postponed any decision on
changes to its aid to athletes regulations.
A spokesman for the faculty representatives said it simply
boiled down to insufficient information at this time to adopt new
rules.
The faculty representatives adjourned their special three-day
meeting with the indication that it would be the regular spring
meeting which opens in Spokane May 19 before the knotty prob
lem is taken up by the representatives again.
* Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, spokesman for the group and representa
tive of the University of California, said that the big stumbling
block to reaching a decision on proposed changes at this meeting
was a lack of information specifically the.lack of information re
garding the cost of living for the average student at each ol the
nine schools.
"We are trying to come out with a plan that provides for each
athlete the same amount in terms of his cost of living at each
campus," Dr. Seaborg said.
He said frankly that the problem was more complicated and
complex than had been anticipated and thai r.o single school came
armed with all the data required as the representatives sat down
to thrash out 'the problem.
Although no official declaration was made, it appeared that the
conference was lined up solidly to support a proposal of varying
rates of aid at. the different schools, fluctuating between schools as
living costs differed.
This also posed another problem, Dr. Seaborg pointed out, of
whether the number of hours an athlete worked should vary at
different schools or whether his pay per hour should vary.
Dr. Seaborg said in his own opinion the figures available at
this meeting seemed to indicate that the amount ol aid an athlete
could receive could dip below $100 per month at some schools while
going over it at others.
