The Church of England clergy
man told an overflow congrega
tion at Mem Church yesterday
morning: "1 want to make it
quite clear that my lectures in

"This visit I'm going to speak
On Christianity as seen from the
inside. That is, I'm going to sug
gest what the hardships and de
mands of the real Christian life

my speeches will be aimed at
Christians, I am, of course, de

morning: "1 want to make it
quite clear that my lectures in
the church will be just that - lec
tures. They will not be services,
and so students need not put on
suits, and my Roman Catholic
brethren will feel free to come."
During Ihe effervescent clergy

1954, he began with the assump
tion that the listener didn't be
lieve in anything, and charted the
reasons why Christians subscribe
to the divinity of Christ.

"This visit I'm going to speak
On Christianity as seen from the

are. This Norman Vincent Peale
talk about the Christian life being
an easy and automatically happy
one is sheer nonsense. Although
my speeches will be aimed at
Christians, I am, of course, de
