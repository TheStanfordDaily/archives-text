## 
### Stan Gross Staff Editor 
VVi11 i;«111 <1. Craig, Dean of Men, last nitrht announced a now,
"long overdue" fundamental University policy on undergraduate
men's housing which plaees particular emphasis on a long-range
program for fraternities at Stanford.
"This policy endorses the fraternity idea and will serve to dispel
the uncertainty that has existed and presently does exist as to the
future of fraternities at Stanford," Craig said.
Craig spoke to an audience oi about 200 students in Memorial
Auditorium in a meeting which was called to inform fraternity men
of decisions marie recently by the Board of Trustees on a long-range
University housing policy- He whs introduced by lnterfraternity
Council president Spike Wilson, of Phi Kappa Psi.
Before reading the policy statement, drawn up by the Board of
Trustees, Craig reviewed the history of fraternities at Stanford,
praising them for the contributions they have made to university
life. Then he told how, "after a certain period in their life here, they
failed to rlo much, but rather drifted.
"The physical condition of many of the houses deteriorated
rapidly under casual care and superficial maintenance. But," he
said. "Ihe purposes for which they were originally designed began
to disappear and some became only a group in name."
In essence, the policy represents an attempt by the University
to integrate the fraternities more closely into an overall under-

graduate men's housing scheme, so as to improve not only the
fraternities but all housing for undergraduates on campus.
"The long-range policy of the University, as the ideal, is ulti
mately to house all undergraduate students men and women in
University facilities on the campus, except those who, because of
reasons of their own, are permitted by the University to live off
campus," the dean said.
Because the administration sees a need to house all undergradu
ates on campus and to improve the housing, scholarship and finan
cial condition of the fraternities, the policy offers the following
progra m:
• "High priority shall be given to housing on the campus all
undergraduate men not adequately housed. In this respect early
completion of Stern Hall is eminently desirable.
• "Additional new University housing shall be in Hie form of
multiple units served from a common kitchen. At least four units
of 50 | both of fraternity and independent) students each would be
necessary to function most successfully in this type of housing.
• "Any new or additional men's housing, including fraternity
houses, shall be undertaken within the above policy. New construc
tion for fraternity housing in the University-owned residence units
will be assigned through priority on a basis of program standards,
physical need and availability of gift funds for construction pur
poses.
"The University will continue to make loans for improvements
to individual fraternity houses when it is apparent that any fra
ternity house so concerned is sound, the fraternity can provide

accommodations acceptable to the University and can maintain the
house in good condition for a reasonable period."
According to a recent independent study made of the fraternities,
the dean said that 10 of them were found to be "sound."
It is planned that the University will allocate these new facilities
to both fraternity and non fraternity men.
"Implicit in this policy statement are the following principles,"
Craig said. Stressing the first, he said:
"Each fraternity is to maintain an internal organization suffi
ciently strong in leadership to plan, administer and control the aca
demic. social and financial programs of the group.
"Effective autumn quarter 1957, as a means of improving fra
ternity scholastic standards and to introduce a stronger academic
factor into pledging criteria, a grade point average of not less than
2.0 will be required for rushing, initiation and continued residence
in a fraternity." There was rustling in the audience
"Fraternity rushing will take place after May 1 of the freshman
year," he said. The audience again stirred visibly.
"The University is opposed to discriminatory racial and religious
clauses and practices and will work with students to eliminate them
at the earliest dale.
"Ilell weeks and hazing of any form shall be completely abol
ished," he said. "Physical abuse and degrading of character have
n<> place at Stanford." This statement was followed by mutterings
from the audience.
A recent Treasury Department ruling requires that the Univer
sity own the buildings made possible by any gifts donated to it The

ruling outlines the conditions under which gifts to Stanford for
construction of fraternity houses would be deductible for federal
tax purposes. The policy will be to treat all fraternities and inde
pendent groups alike as they are affected by that ruling.
"A re-definition of the place of fraternities in higher education
and their role at Stanford is urgently needed," Craig said. "This
policy statement expresses confidence in the small group-livinf, con*
cept at Stanford, particularly the fraternity. The administration
asks your cooperation in working with us to establish a climate of
opinion favorable to the future success of this program.
. . We have purposely left much to be worked out in coopera
tive discussions between University officials and fraternity offi
cers." he said. "We are confident that this statement is a firm
foundation for a healthy fraternity system, and invite your sincere
cooperation in building upon it the necessary superstructure."
Wilson said: "The system is financially unstable and unable to
support itself in any long-range program. If the ideals of fraternity
living and the benefits of small-group living are to be preserver!,
we have to at least get the basic demand of financing them, not to
mention attempting to develop them. Consequently, I endorse the
measure."
Questions were entertained from the floor after the speech, and
a heated discussion ensued. An excited fraternity man asked ihe
dean if rushing was eventually to be moved up to the sophomore
year. Craig told him lie thought it would.
Other questions ranged in subject from location of the proposed
four-unit structures to financing the program.
