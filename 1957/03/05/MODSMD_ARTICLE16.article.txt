# A 						Constructive Policy
## 
### 
A MUCH NEEDED University policy toward fra
terni'ies was announced last night by Dean of
Men William C. Craig.
It will serve to keep the fraternities up with
the changing times and, in some cases, save
tlieni from inevitable extinction.
Many of the objections to the program will
be emotional, to the effect that fraternities as
wc know them—a way of life, so to speak—are
being extinguished. This is true, but fraterni
ties as we know them are dying of their own
accord, and this plan is tlie only way to keep
small-group living alive at Stanford.
Ten out of the 24 fraternities are in close
to condemned condition. Many of the houses
are losing money. The close-knit feeling that
» aternities used to have has been lost by many
houses. In many groups it has been fashionable
lor the seniors to move out of the houses,
leaving the sophomores and the juniors to
wrestle with the program of keeping the houses
on a steady basis.
Because of the poor living percentages and
Jack of prestige of the fraternities, grades of
the I louses have sloughed off, and Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard violations have
gone up. A definite problem all around existed,
and the University has done something
about it.
The small units of SO apiece, half of which
are paid by University endowment funds, will
give decent housing to many groups which
face almost an emergency.

The requirement of a "C" average to stay
in a house may seem discriminatory in nature,
but is a badly needed corrective measure to
bring the fraternities up to the academic stand
ard of the rest of the University.
The abolition of Hell Week and hazing is
unfortunate only in that it wasn't done before.
Such practices have no place at Stanford—or
any other college, for that matter.
Moving the time to May I is a needed step
toward moving the time to the sophomore
year, where it should be. We only hope the
ridiculous no-contact rule will also be abol
ished, or at least modified.
Racial or discriminatory clauses are bad,
and the policy of working with the fraternities
toward the abolition of these clauses is a badly
needed move.
Much will l>e said that fraternity men had
no voice in this plan. It is true, they have had
very little. The Interfraternity Council has
done nothing about the problem.
The fraternities, set in their own ways, could
never get together on a constructive program.
The only answer is an authority to set a re
sponsible, organized program free from mass
control.
Our only hope, now that the over-all policy
has been set, is that through a joint committee
concept the fraternities be given a voice in
this positive policy change.
Otherwise this is the best thing that has
ever happened to Stanford fraternities.

Moving the time to May I is a needed step
toward moving the time to the sophomore
year, where it should be. We only hope the
ridiculous no-contact rule will also be abol
ished, or at least modified.
Racial or discriminatory clauses are bad,
and the policy of working with the fraternities
toward the abolition of these clauses is a badly
needed move.
Much will l>e said that fraternity men had
no voice in this plan. It is true, they have had
very little. The Interfraternity Council has
done nothing about the problem.
The fraternities, set in their own ways, could
never get together on a constructive program.
The only answer is an authority to set a re
sponsible, organized program free from mass
control.
Our only hope, now that the over-all policy
has been set, is that through a joint committee
concept the fraternities be given a voice in
this positive policy change.
Otherwise this is the best thing that has
ever happened to Stanford fraternities.
A MUCH NEEDED University policy toward fra
terni'ies was announced last night by Dean of
Men William C. Craig.
It will serve to keep the fraternities up with
the changing times and, in some cases, save
tlieni from inevitable extinction.
Many of the objections to the program will
be emotional, to the effect that fraternities as
wc know them—a way of life, so to speak—are
being extinguished. This is true, but fraterni
ties as we know them are dying of their own
accord, and this plan is tlie only way to keep
small-group living alive at Stanford.
Ten out of the 24 fraternities are in close
to condemned condition. Many of the houses
are losing money. The close-knit feeling that
» aternities used to have has been lost by many
houses. In many groups it has been fashionable
lor the seniors to move out of the houses,
leaving the sophomores and the juniors to
wrestle with the program of keeping the houses
on a steady basis.
Because of the poor living percentages and
Jack of prestige of the fraternities, grades of
the I louses have sloughed off, and Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard violations have
gone up. A definite problem all around existed,
and the University has done something
about it.
The small units of SO apiece, half of which
are paid by University endowment funds, will
give decent housing to many groups which
face almost an emergency.

The requirement of a "C" average to stay
in a house may seem discriminatory in nature,
but is a badly needed corrective measure to
bring the fraternities up to the academic stand
ard of the rest of the University.
The abolition of Hell Week and hazing is
unfortunate only in that it wasn't done before.
Such practices have no place at Stanford—or
any other college, for that matter.
