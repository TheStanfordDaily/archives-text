# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Dave Canfield
## Fraternities Make News in Other Colleges 
### 
Fraternities, a big issue at Stanford this week,
are also making news at other colleges through
out the Middle West and West.
lnterfraternity Council at the University of
Southern California has suspended the Phi Upsi
lon fraternity for nonpayment of dues. Reason
for Phi Upsilon's reneging on its obligation, ac
cording to house representative Dick O'Melveny,
was IFC's "laxness in making public the annual
audit report as stipulated in the constitution."
But, as IPC counselor Larry Courtney said, the
suspension of Phi Upsilon won't hurt that frater
nity any anyway. "The suspension," Courtney
said, "prohibits access to IFC records and prac
tically nothing else."
Courtney admitted that USC's lnterfraternity
Council is "terribly weak" and that "no one in
the administration is proud of the IFC."

To strengthen the IFC at the University of Ore
gon is the purpose of a proposal recently intro
duced at Eugene. The recommendation would
revise the IFC standing court handling punish
ments so that fraternity men would be handing
out punishments to fraternity men.
In other action, the Oregon IFC recommended
social probation for Phi Delta Theta and Alpha
Tan Omega for vandalism by fraternities after
house elections. IFC noted Dean of Men Ray
Hawk's statement that this was the first time in
seven years he'd heard of throwing beer bottles
through sorority windows. »
At the same meeting, the IFC heard Phi Delta I
Theta president Brian Booth announce his frater- 1
nity had voted to abolish all traditional drinking 112
in the house.

At Evanston, 111., Northwestern University is
considering the issue of fraternity religious dis
crimination. The University's IFC, having set up
a committee to investigate discriminatory prac
tices by fraternites, recently tabled a committee
motion to ban collecting and distributing reli
gious information.
Controversy at Northwestern also concerns
hazing. IFC has heard a motion to "alleviate
present discrepancies" between council and uni
versity hazing rules by incorporating ihe enroll
ment oath into fraternity rules.
But a council member admitted that incorpo
ration of the oath "would be complete hypocrisy."
Meanwhile, in the Northwestern administra
tion, Dean of Men Joseph Boyd said, 'The uni
versity is upset about certain things that it feels
are harming the fraternity system."
He did not elaborate.
Dean of Students James McLeod indirectly
stepped into the question when he said religious
questions on the NW admission blank are not
used for discriminatory purposes. McLeod said
said the religious question would stay on the
blank since "a person's religion is part of his
personality."

for Phi Upsilon's reneging on its obligation, ac
cording to house representative Dick O'Melveny,
was IFC's "laxness in making public the annual
audit report as stipulated in the constitution."
But, as IPC counselor Larry Courtney said, the
suspension of Phi Upsilon won't hurt that frater
nity any anyway. "The suspension," Courtney
said, "prohibits access to IFC records and prac

Courtney admitted that USC's lnterfraternity

At Evanston, 111., Northwestern University is
considering the issue of fraternity religious dis
crimination. The University's IFC, having set up
a committee to investigate discriminatory prac

motion to ban collecting and distributing reli

Controversy at Northwestern also concerns
hazing. IFC has heard a motion to "alleviate
present discrepancies" between council and uni
versity hazing rules by incorporating ihe enroll
ment oath into fraternity rules.
But a council member admitted that incorpo
ration of the oath "would be complete hypocrisy."
Meanwhile, in the Northwestern administra

versity is upset about certain things that it feels
are harming the fraternity system."
He did not elaborate.
Dean of Students James McLeod indirectly
stepped into the question when he said religious
questions on the NW admission blank are not

said the religious question would stay on the
blank since "a person's religion is part of his
