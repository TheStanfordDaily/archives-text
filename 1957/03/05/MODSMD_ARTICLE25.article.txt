Although not every Stanford student has the time and ability to
participate in intercollegiate athletics, there is an athletic program
on campus to care for the "recreation and release" of students and
also give the opportunity to "learn and develop athletic skills."
These are the purposes of Stanford's extensive intramural sports
program. Activities within the program provide keen competition,
exercise and skills which are unobtainable in any other part of the
physical education facilities.
Stanford students themselves broaden and improve the intra
mural program by their continuing cooperation and interest.
These students are the ones to decide which sports will occupy
the calendar during any one quarter. Student interest in the
program has been responsible (of many additions and improve
ments.
Intramural sports are not activities for a small number of stu
dents. Over <1000 Stanfordites registered in the program last year.
Excluding those who participated in more than one sport, between
2500 and 3000 students took an active part in intramurals.
Over 12 sports are covered in the program. Touch football and
volleyball top the list for autumn quarter, while wrestling and basket
ball occupy the winter session spotlight. Spring quarter intramurals
include Softball, handball, and track and field events.
Also included in the intramural program are table tennis, horse
shoes, golf, boxing and swimming in autumn, and volleyball, tennis
and handball for spring quarter.
Organization and direction of the Stanford intramural pro
gram is the job of Director Elwyu Kugge. Although (his posi
tion approaches being a full-time job in itself, Kugge also doubles
as a fencing and tennis instructor. His student assistant is .lack
lloagland.
Many problems arise in the organizing of the program, but Bugge
lists that of administrative work first. This becomes more and more
a problem as more students participate in the program, but it is one
which he is glad to see arise in this connection.
While the organization of the individual teams is left to the groups
which they will represent, the placement of these teams in leagues
is one of Bugge's projects. Though an easy-sounding pastime, it
requires a great deal of work.
Intramural leagues must be balanced with respect to experience
and abilities. The program's rules must lie applied to the establishing
of these leagues so that no team will have an unfair competitive
advantage. Also to be considered is the University no-contact rule
when it is in force during the autumn quarter.
Still other problems are centered around the scheduling of
games. Considerable attention must be given to times whep
teams will be able to play without hardships. The forfeit of any
one game by a team deprives not only its opposition of the fun
of playing, but also two other teams wlui could as well have
been scheduled.
Prior to taking over the intramural post in 1950, Bugge was head
tennis coach. During the years he held this position he coached
Indian netmen through many successful seasons.
Bugge's other position in the Physical Education Department is
that of fencing instructor. lie learned the fencing art while a student
here at Stanford and now teaches elementary courses during autumn
and spring quarters and advanced courses throughout the year.
>luch of the success of the intramural program is due to the
active interest of Director Bugge. Further success is due to
student participation and interest. It is a program of which all
who are concerned can be proud.
