## Churchman To Continue Lectures At Tuesday Series 
### Pete Grothe 
Canon Bryan Green launched |
his series on Christian disciple-1
ship in ilie Memorial Church last
night by listing throe of the nine
marks of the Christian life.
The Rector of Birmingham will
continue his lectures on "Being a
Christian What Does It Mean?"
;it 7:30 tonight in the Tuesday
Evening Series presentation. He
will also speak on Christian mar
riage ;it 4:1.1 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The first mark of Ihe Christian
life, said Canon Green, is that it
is a life of certainty. "We are
certain of the encounter when we
have it. We look at the cross and
we say, 'If God is like that, if
God's love is that kind of love,
then I am sure He will hold me.
I am deeply, permanently sure of
Christ's grip on me.
Second Mark
"The second mark is thai a
Christian's life is a life of tension.
It is not necessarily a happy, .joy
ous life as some pseudo-psycho
logical preachers would have it.
If I have a real Christian experi
ence, 1 must he concerned about
society, for I must share in God's
concern.
"The third mark of the Chris
tian life is a daily communion
with God! For example, when you
marry your wife, you just can't
Id her go after the first encoun
ter. One must talk to her a bit.
And so it is with God -we can't
just have a first encounter with
God *' lf l then let Him go. We
must meet with Him daily."
Accent Worth Hearing
Canon Green, before opening
his Christian marriage lecture
yesterday, said, "I apologize for
not using this microphone, but
my English accent is worth hear
inu. and these American micro
phones always distort it."
He emphasized that in America
there is 100 much of an emphasis
on the physical side of marriage:
"1 once read a preface to a book
on marriage in which the author
stated that the mental and spii i
lual side of marriage were much
more important than the sexual
side. I thought that this was a
most admirable point of view, and
then I discovered thai out of .'{SO
paces in the book, 200 were on
sex."
< lii-istian Marriage
Canon Green described Ihe
Christian marriage as being "a
full, satisfactory marriage he
tween two Christians who bring
into.their marriage all that being
a Christian means."
At one point he quipped, "When
I was younger, I once heard a
preacher speak of Ihe 'Christian
kiss.' Really, it seemed quite dull
to me. I much preferred Ihe oth
er sort."
Canon Green stressed what a
boon children are to marriage:
"In the shared responsibility of
parenthood there is a deepening
of the love relationship that gave
the child birlh."
