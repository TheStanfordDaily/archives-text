The demand for engineers—experienced or graduate

You will be promised many things (including the
moon with a fence/around it), and for a young man
just getting started these things are pretty hard
to resist. /
So, again, let,'s be frank. We at Farnsworth won't
promise moon. (Although we are working
, on some ideas that may eventually get you there
end back.)'We are an old, young organization. Old,
in the sense of being pioneers in the field of elec
tronics./tOur technical director, Dr. Philo Farnsv/orth
invented electronic television.) Young, by being the
newest division of the world-wide International Tele
phone and Telegraph Corporation, devoting our ef
forts exclusively to research, development and pro
duction of military and industrial electronics, arid
/atomic energy.
/ All of which makes Farnsworth big enough for sta
/ Lility and technical perspective, yet small enough
