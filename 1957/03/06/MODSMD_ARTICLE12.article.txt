Canon Bryan Green, the hurri
cane from England, winds up his
packed schedule of lectures, dis
cussions and personal consulta
tions today as he delivers his
main lecture on "Being a Chris
tian—What It Means" at 7:30 p.m.
in Memorial Church and his talk
on Christian marriages ai 4:13
p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
Canon Green also will speak on
the topic "How to Use the Bible"
today at a luncheon sponsored by
*:he YWCA. Students must regis
ter before 11 o'clock at the YWCA
office in the Women's Clubhouse
for the talk.
Canon Green told a large Tues
day Series audience at. Memorial
Auditorium last night that "the
Christian life is no easy life of
happiness. Any man who takes
Christ seriously is bound to suf
fer. The willingness to say 'no'
to self is the measure of one's
Christianity and of one's love for
God."
"Allegiance with Christ"
"We must make the sell-denial
that goes with an allegiance with
Christ. In other words, it often
costs to get up and take a Chris
tian stand today.
"Two, there is the self-denial
of caring. If we love God, it natu
rally follows that we love men.
Persons matter. But to love peo
ple is a costly thing, because we
have to see what's really wrong
with them."
Canon Green's third self-denktl
was that of limitation. "We must
be willing to limit ourselves m
certain situations. The best pxam
pie I know is Albert Schweitzer.
He has astounding abilities in t
number of fields, and yet he ha ,
in a sense, limited himself by giv
ing himself up to a life of Chris
tian charity by living in til'"
depths of Africa setting up medi
cal care for the natives.
"Self-Denial of Alteration"
"The self-denial of alteration in
volves the willingness to allot
prejudices and fixed ideas Ther<"-
must be a willingness to be freed
by Christ.
"The final sell - denial is thai
of responsibility. Unfortunately,
there is a false modesty U it
holds too many Christians back
There must be an acceptance ol
leadership."
Canon Green listed for over
flow audience in Cubberley yes
terday six tests which allow one
to tell if one is in love. He once
remarked:
The six criteria are:
• "How long have you known
each other? I might say that it
is utter rubbish to think there i <
such a thing as love at first sight.
• "In what circumstances have
you known each other? You
know, it's easy to be at your best
when you're having fun.
• "What social background an '
interests do you have in common"
The moment you really love, you
let down all your defenses—which
means that you can be utterly
hurt.
• "What do you miss when
you're away from each ot ler?
• "Do you share com m on
ideals?
• "Do you trust each other
fully?
Canon Green, who is booked up
through 1959, enplanes for Eng
land tonight.
