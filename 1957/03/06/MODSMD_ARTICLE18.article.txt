# Sequoia Mandate
## 
### 
v in < the first issi:k of Sequoia magazine
was published in January of 1956. a Daily edi
torial expressed the hope "that future issues
will he the result of a mandate from a Stanford
community that desires to read a literarv
magazine/'
Today the fourth issue of Sequoia is being
sold on campus. It is encouraging to see that
the hopes of a year ago have so far been real
ized and surpassed.
In its short history Sequoia has made a name
for itself as a high-quality literary magazine.
It. Mall and readers alike may be proud of it.
i ear 1 ? of unsuccessful attempts at publishing
such a magazine made the originators of this
publication aware of the pitfalls involved, both
in getting appropriate material and in selling
the magazine. Yet last year's editor l.inda

Lovelace ami facultv adviser Dr. \\ iITroÂ«I H.
Stone wem ahead with their work and actual
ized a long-discussed plan.
Tlii s year Dr. Stone and editor Don Slionp
have continued to stress Â«] nality in the maga
zine, and student response has heen heartening.
Over 1000 copies of Sequoia were sold last fall.
After thi.s issue Dr. Stone will retire as official
adviser to Sequoia. Otis I'ease of the History
Department will he the new adviser, and Flea
nor Ogden will take over as editor. We re
iterate the hope that future issues will he the
result of a mandate from the Stanford com
munity which wants a literary magazine. Fur
ther, we hope that all future advisers, editors
and staff members will continue, to strive Inl
and achieve the quality that has thus far heen
so well maintained.
