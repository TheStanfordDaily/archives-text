A Demoralizing No
Editor, The Daily:
How much power should students of a Univer
sity be allowed in governing themselves? Should
the students be able to decide themselves on is
sues which concern them? Should they be al
lowed to influence adminstrative policy?
The answer, as far as Stanford is concerned,
c-arne very bluntly when Dean jCraig publicly an
nounced the "New Fraternity Policy." It was a
demoralizing no.
The "new policy" is a direct slap in the face to
the integrity of a sell-governing community.
Granted, some of the aspects of the plan, such
as new building, may be helpful. Yet the admin
istiation dictates to the fraternities the following
"new polices."
° Rushing will now take place May 1.
A "C" average will have to be maintained to
ru. c ;h, be initiated, live in house.
a Initiation will be abolished.
These are issues which predominantly concern
the fraternites. The big question is: Does the
adminstration have the right to put these into
efi'cct without consulting the fraternities? This
is a question which should concern not only fra
ternity men but the whole student body. Some
may ihink it unimportant, but if these plans go
into effect what is the use of any attempt at stu
dent government. If the adminstration can step
in at any time and dictate to the students, without
at least their approval, on matters which directly
concern them, then there is no sense in attempt
ing to continue self-government at Stanford.

False Promises
Editor, The Daily:
Last night, at the meeting in Mem Aud, some
one asked Dean Craig what the University would
do lo help the fraternities fill up their 50-man
dorms. His answer was, "The University will
help them find members." Even if the f.raterni-,
ties would consent to such a ridiculous plan I
wonder if the University realizes the full extent
of this problem. If they do are they just making
false promises?
Each house will have to pledge at least 30 men
each year in order lo keep their dorm full of jun
iors and seniors because ol the inevitable trans
ferring, depledging, etc. If each of the 24 houses
has to do this a little simple multiplication shows
1 hi't 720 men would have to be pledged each year
by the fraternities. This is about 320 more than
went through rushing this year and if it were
applied to this year's junior class only 104 men
:n the class would not be fraternity pledges.
The eating clubs need more than this remain
ing number if they are going to operate at their
present level. Remembering that there will only
be juniors and seniors in the clubs and that they
each need about 35 members, the clubs will need
to pledge at least. 120 juniors each year. This all

means thai if the fraternities and the eating
clubs are to remain every junior and senior will
have to be a member of either one or the other
type organization. This will eliminate the inde
pendent classification for upper classmen. An
other alternative is to have just eating clubs and
'independents. This appears to be what the Uni
versity wants because even if a fraternity is ca
pable of building a new house they will not let
the fraternity build. If this is what the Univer
sity wants why don't they just come out and
say it or are they afraid they will offend the
fraternity grads' pocketbooks?

Moral Obligation
Editor, The Daily:
The frequency of acts of mischievous vandal
ism in and around the campus has made it an
intellectual and moral obligation for me to regis
ter vehement protest. I refer, of course, to the
thievery on the Row and debacles in San Fran
cisco by small groups of amoral men and las
civious, cheap women who sully the name of Le
land Stanford Junior University. Such events as
the destruction of interior furnishings of one fra
ternity by another; interfraternity drinking or
gies in which impressionable young minds are
stifled and warped by Demon Rum; lewd and
obscene motion pictures being shown, in which
liquor- and tobacco-benumbed students seek vi
carious gratification of the flesh, and most re
cently, the destroying of the SAE lion by the
apparently dope - crazed, homicidally intendent
mad bomber, are all examples of my stand.
We must hope that the state of moral turpitude
evinced by an all-, to-large segment of the student
body will be dealt with by the agencies best
equipped to stamp out its affliction—the parents
of the students, the campus community and the
community church groups.
In connection with the last, I feel that compul
sory church attendance might be a stopper-dam
to stem the overflow of evilness and smut. Con
valescent Home hours could he gfven to those lax
in attendance while those showing promise of
spirtual and moral growth could be given schol
arship credits, free passes to the Sunday flicks,
etc.
However, even an idealistic boy of my tender
years realizes that, at this stage, the debauchery
could scarcely be oppressed by rational methods
aimed at the intelligent but slightly delinquent
student. This is mass pathological behavior
which can only be stopped by efficient, thorough
law enforcement. The offenders should be ar
rested, imprisoned and shown the light of truth.
If this fails, harsher disciplines should be used;
love of their fellow man and an all encompassing
morality should be presented to them in such a
way that the vile sinners could scarcely afford
not to accept it as their own. This accomplished,
a gill of upright character could walk the streets
in safety.
