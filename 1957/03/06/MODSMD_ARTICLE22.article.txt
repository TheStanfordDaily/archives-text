## Sequoia Maintains Standards In Winter Quarter Edition 
### Camille Petersen 
The editors of Sequoia have shown their desire to print «>n)y
"good" material tjy their selection of articles appearing in this quar
ter's edition.
J. D. Salinger's "Seventy-eight Bananas" by William Wiegand, Se
quoia article contest winner, is the featured work. In the article Wie-

gand points to Salinger's achieve-;
ments of reviving "the dormant
art of dialect in American fic
tion," and places him on the same
plane as Mark Twain. Even if the
leader fails to agree with his con-j
elusions, In 4 will find himself'
pleased with the author's sincere!
attempt to justify his opinion.

Wiegand cites passages from,
Salinger's works to aid him in,
making his views clear to his
reader. Early in the article the
reader meets the "bananafish,"
and he wifl find it beneficial in
understanding the remainder of
the work by immediately securing
a definite understanding of what
is generally meant by the term.
* Letter to Editor
The Letter to the Editor by Al-1
fred de Grazia, associate profes
sor of political science at Stan
lord, expresses objections to
views put forth by Dean Philip
Rhinelander in his article entitled ;
"On General Education" in last;
quarter's publication.
In addressing himself to what
he terms the two species Rhine
lander created, the "teaching ani
mal and the research animal, who
struggle in silent fury for control •
of the university and its stu
dents," De Grazia offers some
challenging questions. Regard- j
less of one's liking for Rhinedan-1
ler and other educators who share
his views, one cannot help but see >
certain weaknesses in his article!
when examining it beside that of'
De Grazia.
Poems by Richard Elman, Mau-|
rice Montgomery and Moore Mo
ran add a variety to the maga-j
zine. Pete Grot he's "A Debate
with Gerhard Eisler" supplies the!
international touch.
Fiction Works
"An Agreement" by Luis Harss ;
and"The Window Decorator" by 1
Joanne Hardy constitute the fic
tion works. Both withhold their
full impact until the closing para
graphs when they let the reader |
see the focal issue of the work.
The most disappointing article
in the publication is "Through the
Looking Glass." Though it has;
some small point to make, it;
seems as if the space could have
been used to better advantage.
The one thing lacking in this ;
quarter's issue is a sufficient j
amount of art.
