# Thinclads Open Season With 'Odd Events' Meet Saturday
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Six months of intensive prepa
ration will get ils first real lest
Saturday when the Stanford track
team hosts San Jose Stale, the
Olympic Club and the Santa Clara
Youth Center in an "odd-events"
meet here at 1:30 p.m.
Since the Indians' new head
roach, Payton Jordan, and his as
sistant, Floyd Strain, greeted
track candidates in late Septem
ber, workouts and intra • squad
.meets have been proceeding at a
breath-taking pace.
From a record original turnout
of approximately 150, Jordan and
Strain have trimmed the varsity
squad down to a workable num
ber of about 3.1 and the freshman
team to about 20 men.
So-called experts looked at the
Stanford material early in the
year and predicted a dismal sea
son ahead for the Tribe. But since
the early days of autumn quarter,
.Jordan and Strain have carefully
built a team which promises to
challenge, some of the West
Coast's perennial spike powers.
Shorter Distances
Saturday's initial test will be at
distances shortened from the nor
mal and will employ a unique
scoring system. Events to be run
are the 75-, ISO- and 352-yard
dashes; 660, 1320 and 1 - mile
runs; 70 yard high hurdles and
160 low hurdles.
The six standard field events
high .jump, broad jump, pole
vault, javelin, shot put and dis
cus will all be contested, but in
a manner different from usual.
A qualifying mark has been es
tablished in each of these events,
and each man to better that mark
on one of his free tries will score
one point, for his team. Each
school will be limited to three
points per field event.
The team with the best overall
record in each running event will
get three points, with two points
awarded to Ihe second team and
one to the third.

Stanford's busiest man figures I
to be Frank Herrmann who will i
compete in the broad jump, 75 1
and 180. "l\vo years ago Herr- j
mann wafe PCC broad jump cjiam- j
pion while just a sophomore; last i
year he placed second to UCLA's '
Rafer Johnson in that event.
Tn five intra-squad meets this
year Herrmann's best mark was
23-2%; however, he has improved :
in each outing. Herrmann sup-|
prised all by sprinting the 100 in |
9.9 on a soggy track four weeks :
ago and appears ready to come ,
into his own as a sprinter this
spring.
Iron Man
Iron man of the distance crew
will be senior Ralph Love. He is
slated to run in the 1320 and six
lap races. Love's 9:50.7 two-mile
effort back in the middle of Jan
uary proved he had lost none of
his zip from the cross-country
season. That race established him
as an integral part of the Indian j
long-distance forces.
Other Tribesmen who will prob- j
ably go in more than one event
are Chuck Cobb in the hurdles, [
Leonard Bates in the 75 and the !
low hurdles, Jim Easter in the |
sprints, Chuck Ince in the 180 and !
352, Phil Fehlen in the high hur
dles and high jump and Archie
Schmitt and Ray Williamson in
the weights.


IJIVAND-OVER — Senior Phil Feblen jumped (MS twice during
Couch Jordan's pre season intra-souad meets. He is expected to
annex a first in Saturday's high jump competition and will also
go alter points in the high hurdles.
