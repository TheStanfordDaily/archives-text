# Finnish Professor Impressed By Examples of U.S. Democracy
## Public Hearings of Congressional Committees, Supreme Court Seen as 'Very Good Institution' 
### Barbara Bachman 
"The thing (hat impressed me 1
most |about the United States|
was the very good example of de
mocracy displayed in President !
Eisenhower's press conferences |
when the newsmen were allowed!
to ask him all kinds of things and
he answered openly and thor
oughly."
This was the observation ex
pressed by Dr. Paavo K. Kastari,
professor of constitutional law.
University of Helsinki, Finland,
during his Friday visit to Hoover
Institute and Library. Kastari is
currently touring the IJ ni ted
States to study our legal systems,
particularly those concerning con
stitutional civil rights.
Public Hearings
"Another thing that impressed
me was the public hearings of
Congressional committees and
the Supreme Court; especially
the fact that Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles was interro
gated from morning till night. I !
think it's a very good institution
indeed."
He explained that he thinks
Finland and the United States
have the best civil rights pro
grams in the world. However, he
hopes to improve his country's
government on this issue through
detailed studies and comparisons.
Finland Is Cohesive
"Essentially the Finnish na
tion is very cohesive," the profes-!
sor said. He illustrated this by
explaining that out of a total pop
ulation of 4,200,000, "over 96 per ;
cent of the People belong to the
Lutheran Church." There are a
few in the Greek Orthodox
Church, "some hundred Roman
Catholics and .Jews, and a very
few don't belong to any church."
Racially, also, the Finns main- 1
tain a very definite unity. There !
are no Negroes in the country, j
unless they are visiting in enter- j
tainmeht capacities. The only ex
ception to the unity, he said, is
that 8 per cent of the people are
Swedish.
"The Swedish," he continued,
"have a big influence in business
arul industry. Big business is
mostly in their hands and they I

are wealthy people. They are
much more influential in econom
ic life than their numerical popu
lation would seem to indicate."
"Currently Finland is under
going a very serious economic
crisis, he pointed out. "Prices and
wages have climbed one after the
other. Living costs have gone up
so much we are not able to send
products abroad."
One reason for the present dif
ficulties could be the existence of
six national political parties. Last
week, before the recent govern
ment upheaval, their parliament
had the following representation:
Social Democrats, 25 per cent;
Agrarians, 25 per cent; Commu
nists, 20 per cent; Conservatives,
15 per cent; Swedish, 8 per cent,
and Progressives, about (> per
cent.
