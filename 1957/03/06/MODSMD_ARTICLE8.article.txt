### 
Lake Lagunita may still fill up because of the February rains.
According to the grouchy campus weather man, Stanford had
.'L79 inches of rain for the month, but the season's total of 8.19
inches is still way below normal for the date.
The unpredictable weather as usual, did not please everyone.
Those from Los Angeles commented on how bad it was, "it rained
18 out of 28 days."
Those from Eureka commented that the weather was so nice,
"it only was cloudy 20 days in February." Fven skiers complained
for the rains were rain and not snow during the month.
February weather was the essence of contrast. It was beach
weather on Feb. 15, when the temperature soared to a high of 75
1 degrees. On Ihe other hand, it was skiing weather when the low
for the month was a cold 29 degrees. *
For those who do not have a good almanac, the long-range
weather forecast for March: above normal amounts of rain and a
1 per cent chance of snow. (Don't laugh; it snowed 3.5 inches on
j Lclanrl Stanford's farm in 1882.)
