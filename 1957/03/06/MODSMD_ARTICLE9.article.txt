# Year-Long Study Results In New Fraternity Policy
## Shows Many Houses Are Beyond Repair, in Bad Financial Status 
### 
The new administration policy toward fraternities is Ihe result of
a lengthy study of the physical, academic and citizenship aspects of
fraternities.
Dean of Men William G. Craig, who supervised the study, an
nounced the new policy before 250 people in Cubberley Auditorium

Monday night.
Craig made the following com
ments yesterday about the three
sides to I he study:
• The physical side of the study
indicates that 10 fraternity houses
"are in such bad shape that it
probably would be a bad financial
venture to put any money into
them." 'I'his finding has led the
administration to plan on eventu
ally moving all fraternities into
dormitory-like units.
• The academic side of the
study indicates that since 1948
"there hasn't been any year when
the all-fraternity average has ap
proached the all-men's and all
women's averages.
"Grades tend to go down their
first quarter in the house." Craig
said in comparing pledges' grades
to non-fraternity men's academic
achievement. From taking fre
quency distributions of an equal
sampling of non-fraternity fresh
men and pledged freshmen last
year, the administration found
I hat lliose who pledged fraterni
ties hart lower College Board
scores and lower first - quarter
grades than those who did not
pledge.
The dean of men added, "Al
though this runs inconsistent, in
general fraternities account for
about 40 per cent of those on the
deficiency lists" (lists taken at
the end of each quarter that in
clude all minus students).
This percentage is remarkably
high. Craig commented, since
only 957 about 20 per cent -of
the University's 5300 undergradu
ate students belong to fraterni
ties. Such figures help to explain
why the administration has made
a 2.0 grade average a requisite
for rushing, initiation.and frater
nity membership.
• The third side of the study
related to citizenship of students
belonging to fraternities. "What
we did there was to go back eight
years and check all Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code viola
tions." Craig said, "and fraternity
men account for 72 per cent of
these cases."
The fraternity tradition at Stan
ford dates hack to 1891. The first
Farm Greek - letter organizations
Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma
Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Chi.
Sigma Nu and Zola Psi came to
the campus within three months
after- the first enrollment in that
yea r.
The original ruling body of the
faternities was Hie Intel-fraternity
Hoar d of Control, from which has
evolved the present Interfrater
nit.v Council.
Paddles Outlawed
The Board of Control took one
of its most nositive actions in
1940. That action was the out
lawing of the use of paddles dur
ing the initiation period, which
had been substituted earlier for
Hell Week.
World War II came in the next
year and disrupted the fraternity
system to a tremendous degree.
During the final three years of
the war there was no fraternity
activity at all, but in 'he fall of
194(5 all 24 houses reopened.
When the reopening of frater
nities was announced in April,
1910, President Donald Tresidder
issued the following statement:
Tresidder's Statement
. . There are advantages in
small living units which encour
age development of group respon
sibility, good citizenship and in
timate friendship. ... It is out
earnest hope that in the years
ahead the fraternities, in coopera
tion with the faculty and the ad
ministration, will make an out
standing contribution to student
life at Stanford."

"there hasn't been any year when

"Grades tend to go down their

said in comparing pledges' grades
to non-fraternity men's academic
achievement. From taking fre
quency distributions of an equal

year, the administration found
I hat lliose who pledged fraterni

scores and lower first - quarter
grades than those who did not
pledge.
The dean of men added, "Al
though this runs inconsistent, in
general fraternities account for
about 40 per cent of those on the
deficiency lists" (lists taken at
the end of each quarter that in
clude all minus students).
This percentage is remarkably
high. Craig commented, since
only 957 about 20 per cent -of
the University's 5300 undergradu
ate students belong to fraterni
ties. Such figures help to explain
why the administration has made
a 2.0 grade average a requisite
for rushing, initiation.and frater
nity membership.
• The third side of the study
related to citizenship of students
belonging to fraternities. "What
we did there was to go back eight
years and check all Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code viola

these cases."
