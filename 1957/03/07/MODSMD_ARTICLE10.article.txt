# Presses Silent as Daily Protests LASSU Action
## Freelen's Vote Passes Amendment; Wilbur Delegate Votes by Proxy 
### Wally Simpson Associate Editor 
By a 12 4 vote ASSU Legislature last night approved a much
amended and re-amended by-law which indirectly caused a walk-cut
of the staff of The Daily.
The Daily staff had voted a week ago lasi Sunday that it wouid
walk out in the event any restrictive legislation were to be passed

by Legislature. In a special meet
ing following the Legislature
meeting the staff voted to go
along with its former decision by
an overwhelming majority.
When Legislature first took a i
vote on the controversial issue j
which would give Legislature the I
power to disapprove the editor of j
The Daily, the result was 10 to 4 !
with ASSU President Bob Freelen I
not voting.
A Proxy Vote
Before the result was officially
announced, Wilbur representative
Dick Grillo announced that he had
a proxy vote which he wanted to
cast for the other Wilbur repre
sentative who was absent, Pat
Curley. According to Grillo, Cur
ley wanted to vote for the amend
ment if it were changed to the
form voted"on.
Daily Editor Dave Scott pro
tested the admission of the proxy
vote, but an opinion by Adminis
trative Assistant Steve Tallent
Which became the ruling of Free
len said the proxy vote was ad
missible. This made the unoffi
cial vote 11-4 in favor of it. This
was still not the three-fourths
vote needed to pass the by-law
change.
Freelen Votes
At this point Freelen turned the
gavel over to Student Financial
Manager Bill Mathewson and an
nounced that he intended to vote
since it was a contested issue. He
voted in the affirmative, making
the final vote 12-4. Freelen then
announced the by-law change as
official.
Later last night in an interview
over radio station KZSU Freelen
announced that there were no
protests to the ruling that the
proxy vote was admissible. Scott
said that he had protested the rul
ing but was not heard.
Scott also announced that The
Daily protests the admissibility of
a proxy vote after the official
vote had already been taken. Tal
lent said later that as far as he
knew no point of order had been
made.
Daily Petition
During the discussion of the is
sue Scott had brought up the fact
that more than 1100 students had
signed a petition stating they
were in complete disfavor of Leg
islature doing any legislating on
The Daily. In his radio interview
Freelen said, "I think the state
ment of the petition was too gen- j
eral." This, he explained, was;
why Legislature members had
not considered the petitions be
fore making their decisions.
Freelen also said he was com
! pletely surprised by the Daily
staff's decision to walk out "I
have my doubts it will be exe
cuted. I question prudence and
its legality."
No ASSU Plans
When asked if the ASSU plan
ned to step into the operation of
The Daily, Freelen said, "By no
means do plan to step into The
: Daily. The move caught me com
! pletely by surprise."
, Scott said in his interview over
i KZSU that the staff of The Daily
had voted to walk out and that
they do not intend to return until
adverse legislation is re
scinded
Sequoia Editor Don Shoup,
speaking in an unofficial ca
parity, said that "a strike is a
right of a people who think their
rights have violated But
other means are open."
He referred to the right of any
student or any group to go to the
-tudent body in a general referen
dum. A five per cent petition of
the student body is needed to
have the question placed on a
, referendum.
