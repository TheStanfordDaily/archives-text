With Disgust . . .
Editor, The Daily:
This Issue of The Daily marks the end of an
era; the shutting off of the only organized voice
of independence which has ever existed at Stan
ford University.
For Those unfamiliar with student government
here, Legislature's stated motive for its decision
to lake unto itself the right of approving the
editor of The Stanford Daily—cooperation may
seem a valid one.
But for those initiated into the inane operations
of this play-at-government, the real motive stands
out clearly. Simply, the Legislature—or, rather,
certain members of the body wanted control.
Now they have it.
The Daily, before last, night, could claim an
almost unique place in the collegiate newspaper
field. Here was one of the few such papers which
was not in the control of the "red-hots"; which
spoke with a voice independent of the sickening
immaturity of the usual student government
"red-hot."
Now -the "red-hots" can pattern The Daily
along their own lines, "in the best interests" of
the ASSU, whom they pretend to represent, and
"in the best interests" of the University, which
they do represent.
Whether The Daily is published in the best
interest;, of the grooving and inquiring minds it
reaches is immaterial to them. They would have
the paper a trade journal, publishing Their own
petty efforts and adding to the glorious Stanford
spirit. The individual be damned. Press freedom
be damned. Principles be damned.
_ There are some who say this piece of restric
tive legislation does not mean control; that The
Daily can still be free to print what it believes
the real students want, not what the small pres
sure groups want. Those who hold this belief
are wrong.
For if the Daily editor becomes responsible to
the ASSU legislature his conduct will then have
to conform to their desires. And from past con
duct I firmly believe that what the ASSU Legis
lature wants, and what the campus wants—and
must have if we are to escape the smug adoration
of the status quo that pervades Stanford—are
not one and the same.
Legislatui said they wanted cooperation. They
lied. They wanted control. They were given
cooperation—much more than 1 would have given
them, considering their true motives and under
handed methods—and they refused it. Instead
they continued legislating, until they had what
they really wanted control
As a former editor of The Daily, I strongly
endorse The Daily's action of walking out. It was
the only possible move. It was the only remain
ing way to protest the action of a body of student,
government "red-hots" who have so far shown
that all they want is to control The Daily; who
have said, "Wo want to keep the editor on his
toes" (and off theirs?), and, "We don't want an
individualist as editor."
The Daily, as such, ceased to exist the minute
legislature passed its restrictive legislation. It
was transformed from an independent, vibrant
newspaper with a I. lory of 61 years into a trade
journal to be published by. and for, the "icd
hots."
That is why the Daily staff walked out. They
no longer had a newspaper with which to work.
All that was left was a trade journal.
The Legislature is welcome to it. And, for
what it's worth, they are welcome to my un
qualified condemnation and disgust.

A Strike for' Principle
Editor, The Daily:
For three frustrating weeks The Daily fought
for a principle only to see it ludicrously violated
at last night's Legislature meeting.
The principle- (hat of a free, independent and
vital press was not supported by The Daily for
reasons of personal or professional pride. It was
backed by the sincere feeling that Stanford stu
dents deserve more than a "trade journal" of the
ASSU a propaganda sheet for the empty shell
of what was once a student government.
The "trade journal" approach is not idle specu
lation. This is what ASSU President Bob Kreelen
has said The Daily should be.
The Daily staff walked out because it could no
longer stand the appalling hypocrisy that perme
ated the air- of Legislature's maneuverings and
counter-maneuverings.
It walked out because it felt that The Daily
would no longer be a newspaper in any true sense
of the word, should it be brought under the pro
tective wing of a student government organ.
It walked out; because it felt, the students be
lieved in this principle also. It drew this conclu
sion at least in part from the more than 1200
petition signatures that were gathered in a 36-
hour period.
Many will ask if the legislation is sufficiently
serious to merit a protest strike. True, it was
compromise legislation, but that does not make
it any more palatable.
Should Legislature feel distaste for a newly
elected editor, all it has to do is to cast him out
by a simple majority vote the vote of 10 persons.
Legislature then turns the matter back to the
Daily staff to choose an editor it does not want,
an editor it may feel reluctant to work under.
Selection of an editor and this may indeed
evolve into that must not be a political matter.
No interest group and certainly it must be
said that Legislature is an interest group—has
any ethical right to toss out: a duly chosen editor
of a newspaper. This would be indirect political
control, but political control nevertheless.
As The Daily has said, only the Daily staff
knows the true merits of an editorial candidate
how he writes, how he works with the staff, how
he thinks, how he administers.
Should Legislature decide to turn an editor
down, it would be on the grounds that he "prob
ably" will not act "in the best interests of the
students."
How, I cannot help wondering, is legislature
to be blessed with this infinite wisdom? What
qualifications does it have to judge the merits
or demerits ol a prospective editor?
Actually, this is beside the point. The basic
factor here is that Legislature must not be al
lowed to silence, or intimidate, the one organ of
criticism existing on campus. A news sheet
shaped in its image would present no challenge
to the mind ot the Stanford student; it would be
an insult to his intelligence.
If one real criticism can be made of The Daily,
it is that it does not criticize enough. Prevalent
student attitudes and actions should be chal
lenged continually.
Intimidation is obviously not the answer. An
editor must answer only his own conscience and
the collective consciences of his readers.
He must l)e responsible in the highest sense
of the word responsible to the students and re
sponsible to his sense of obligation to publish a
forthright, challenging, thoughtful and independ
ent newspaper. •

said that Legislature is an interest group—has
any ethical right to toss out: a duly chosen editor
of a newspaper. This would be indirect political
control, but political control nevertheless.
As The Daily has said, only the Daily staff
knows the true merits of an editorial candidate
how he writes, how he works with the staff, how
he thinks, how he administers.
Should Legislature decide to turn an editor
down, it would be on the grounds that he "prob
ably" will not act "in the best interests of the
students."
How, I cannot help wondering, is legislature
to be blessed with this infinite wisdom? What
qualifications does it have to judge the merits
or demerits ol a prospective editor?
Actually, this is beside the point. The basic
factor here is that Legislature must not be al
lowed to silence, or intimidate, the one organ of
criticism existing on campus. A news sheet
shaped in its image would present no challenge
to the mind ot the Stanford student; it would be
an insult to his intelligence.
If one real criticism can be made of The Daily,
it is that it does not criticize enough. Prevalent
student attitudes and actions should be chal
lenged continually.
Intimidation is obviously not the answer. An
editor must answer only his own conscience and
the collective consciences of his readers.
He must l)e responsible in the highest sense
of the word responsible to the students and re
sponsible to his sense of obligation to publish a
forthright, challenging, thoughtful and independ
ent newspaper. •

Editor, The Daily:
This Issue of The Daily marks the end of an
era; the shutting off of the only organized voice
of independence which has ever existed at Stan
ford University.
For Those unfamiliar with student government
here, Legislature's stated motive for its decision
to lake unto itself the right of approving the
editor of The Stanford Daily—cooperation may
seem a valid one.
But for those initiated into the inane operations
of this play-at-government, the real motive stands
out clearly. Simply, the Legislature—or, rather,
certain members of the body wanted control.
Now they have it.
The Daily, before last, night, could claim an
almost unique place in the collegiate newspaper
field. Here was one of the few such papers which
was not in the control of the "red-hots"; which
spoke with a voice independent of the sickening
immaturity of the usual student government
"red-hot."
Now -the "red-hots" can pattern The Daily
along their own lines, "in the best interests" of
the ASSU, whom they pretend to represent, and
"in the best interests" of the University, which
they do represent.
Whether The Daily is published in the best
interest;, of the grooving and inquiring minds it
reaches is immaterial to them. They would have
the paper a trade journal, publishing Their own
petty efforts and adding to the glorious Stanford
spirit. The individual be damned. Press freedom
be damned. Principles be damned.
_ There are some who say this piece of restric
tive legislation does not mean control; that The
Daily can still be free to print what it believes
the real students want, not what the small pres
sure groups want. Those who hold this belief
are wrong.
For if the Daily editor becomes responsible to
the ASSU legislature his conduct will then have
to conform to their desires. And from past con
duct I firmly believe that what the ASSU Legis
lature wants, and what the campus wants—and
must have if we are to escape the smug adoration
of the status quo that pervades Stanford—are
not one and the same.
Legislatui said they wanted cooperation. They
lied. They wanted control. They were given
cooperation—much more than 1 would have given
them, considering their true motives and under
handed methods—and they refused it. Instead
they continued legislating, until they had what
they really wanted control
As a former editor of The Daily, I strongly
endorse The Daily's action of walking out. It was
the only possible move. It was the only remain
ing way to protest the action of a body of student,
government "red-hots" who have so far shown
that all they want is to control The Daily; who
have said, "Wo want to keep the editor on his
toes" (and off theirs?), and, "We don't want an
individualist as editor."
The Daily, as such, ceased to exist the minute
legislature passed its restrictive legislation. It
was transformed from an independent, vibrant
newspaper with a I. lory of 61 years into a trade
journal to be published by. and for, the "icd
hots."
That is why the Daily staff walked out. They
no longer had a newspaper with which to work.
All that was left was a trade journal.
The Legislature is welcome to it. And, for
what it's worth, they are welcome to my un
qualified condemnation and disgust.

A Strike for' Principle
Editor, The Daily:
For three frustrating weeks The Daily fought
for a principle only to see it ludicrously violated
at last night's Legislature meeting.
The principle- (hat of a free, independent and
vital press was not supported by The Daily for
reasons of personal or professional pride. It was
backed by the sincere feeling that Stanford stu
dents deserve more than a "trade journal" of the
ASSU a propaganda sheet for the empty shell
of what was once a student government.
The "trade journal" approach is not idle specu
lation. This is what ASSU President Bob Kreelen
has said The Daily should be.
The Daily staff walked out because it could no
longer stand the appalling hypocrisy that perme
ated the air- of Legislature's maneuverings and
counter-maneuverings.
It walked out because it felt that The Daily
would no longer be a newspaper in any true sense
of the word, should it be brought under the pro
tective wing of a student government organ.
It walked out; because it felt, the students be
lieved in this principle also. It drew this conclu
sion at least in part from the more than 1200
petition signatures that were gathered in a 36-
hour period.
Many will ask if the legislation is sufficiently
serious to merit a protest strike. True, it was
compromise legislation, but that does not make
it any more palatable.
Should Legislature feel distaste for a newly
elected editor, all it has to do is to cast him out
by a simple majority vote the vote of 10 persons.
Legislature then turns the matter back to the
Daily staff to choose an editor it does not want,
an editor it may feel reluctant to work under.
Selection of an editor and this may indeed
evolve into that must not be a political matter.
No interest group and certainly it must be

vital press was not supported by The Daily for
reasons of personal or professional pride. It was
backed by the sincere feeling that Stanford stu
dents deserve more than a "trade journal" of the
ASSU a propaganda sheet for the empty shell
of what was once a student government.
The "trade journal" approach is not idle specu
lation. This is what ASSU President Bob Kreelen
has said The Daily should be.
The Daily staff walked out because it could no
longer stand the appalling hypocrisy that perme
ated the air- of Legislature's maneuverings and
counter-maneuverings.
It walked out because it felt that The Daily
would no longer be a newspaper in any true sense
of the word, should it be brought under the pro
tective wing of a student government organ.
It walked out; because it felt, the students be
lieved in this principle also. It drew this conclu
sion at least in part from the more than 1200
petition signatures that were gathered in a 36-
hour period.
Many will ask if the legislation is sufficiently
serious to merit a protest strike. True, it was
compromise legislation, but that does not make
it any more palatable.
Should Legislature feel distaste for a newly
elected editor, all it has to do is to cast him out
by a simple majority vote the vote of 10 persons.
Legislature then turns the matter back to the
Daily staff to choose an editor it does not want,
an editor it may feel reluctant to work under.
Selection of an editor and this may indeed
evolve into that must not be a political matter.
No interest group and certainly it must be
said that Legislature is an interest group—has
any ethical right to toss out: a duly chosen editor
of a newspaper. This would be indirect political
control, but political control nevertheless.
As The Daily has said, only the Daily staff
knows the true merits of an editorial candidate
how he writes, how he works with the staff, how
he thinks, how he administers.
Should Legislature decide to turn an editor
down, it would be on the grounds that he "prob
ably" will not act "in the best interests of the
students."
How, I cannot help wondering, is legislature
to be blessed with this infinite wisdom? What
qualifications does it have to judge the merits
or demerits ol a prospective editor?
Actually, this is beside the point. The basic
factor here is that Legislature must not be al
lowed to silence, or intimidate, the one organ of
criticism existing on campus. A news sheet
shaped in its image would present no challenge
to the mind ot the Stanford student; it would be
an insult to his intelligence.
If one real criticism can be made of The Daily,
it is that it does not criticize enough. Prevalent
student attitudes and actions should be chal
lenged continually.
Intimidation is obviously not the answer. An
editor must answer only his own conscience and
the collective consciences of his readers.
He must l)e responsible in the highest sense
of the word responsible to the students and re
sponsible to his sense of obligation to publish a
forthright, challenging, thoughtful and independ
ent newspaper. •

Editor, The Daily:
This Issue of The Daily marks the end of an
era; the shutting off of the only organized voice
of independence which has ever existed at Stan
ford University.
For Those unfamiliar with student government
here, Legislature's stated motive for its decision
to lake unto itself the right of approving the
editor of The Stanford Daily—cooperation may
seem a valid one.
But for those initiated into the inane operations
of this play-at-government, the real motive stands
out clearly. Simply, the Legislature—or, rather,
certain members of the body wanted control.
Now they have it.
The Daily, before last, night, could claim an
almost unique place in the collegiate newspaper
field. Here was one of the few such papers which
was not in the control of the "red-hots"; which
spoke with a voice independent of the sickening
immaturity of the usual student government
"red-hot."
Now -the "red-hots" can pattern The Daily
along their own lines, "in the best interests" of
the ASSU, whom they pretend to represent, and
"in the best interests" of the University, which
they do represent.
Whether The Daily is published in the best
interest;, of the grooving and inquiring minds it
reaches is immaterial to them. They would have
the paper a trade journal, publishing Their own
petty efforts and adding to the glorious Stanford
spirit. The individual be damned. Press freedom
be damned. Principles be damned.
_ There are some who say this piece of restric
tive legislation does not mean control; that The
Daily can still be free to print what it believes
the real students want, not what the small pres
sure groups want. Those who hold this belief
are wrong.
For if the Daily editor becomes responsible to
the ASSU legislature his conduct will then have
to conform to their desires. And from past con
duct I firmly believe that what the ASSU Legis
lature wants, and what the campus wants—and
must have if we are to escape the smug adoration
of the status quo that pervades Stanford—are
not one and the same.
Legislatui said they wanted cooperation. They
lied. They wanted control. They were given
cooperation—much more than 1 would have given
them, considering their true motives and under
handed methods—and they refused it. Instead
they continued legislating, until they had what
they really wanted control
As a former editor of The Daily, I strongly
endorse The Daily's action of walking out. It was
the only possible move. It was the only remain
ing way to protest the action of a body of student,
government "red-hots" who have so far shown
that all they want is to control The Daily; who
have said, "Wo want to keep the editor on his
toes" (and off theirs?), and, "We don't want an
individualist as editor."
The Daily, as such, ceased to exist the minute
legislature passed its restrictive legislation. It
was transformed from an independent, vibrant
newspaper with a I. lory of 61 years into a trade
journal to be published by. and for, the "icd
hots."
That is why the Daily staff walked out. They
no longer had a newspaper with which to work.
All that was left was a trade journal.
The Legislature is welcome to it. And, for
what it's worth, they are welcome to my un
qualified condemnation and disgust.

Legislatui said they wanted cooperation. They
lied. They wanted control. They were given
cooperation—much more than 1 would have given
them, considering their true motives and under
handed methods—and they refused it. Instead
they continued legislating, until they had what
they really wanted control
As a former editor of The Daily, I strongly
endorse The Daily's action of walking out. It was
the only possible move. It was the only remain
ing way to protest the action of a body of student,
government "red-hots" who have so far shown
that all they want is to control The Daily; who
have said, "Wo want to keep the editor on his
toes" (and off theirs?), and, "We don't want an
individualist as editor."
The Daily, as such, ceased to exist the minute
legislature passed its restrictive legislation. It
was transformed from an independent, vibrant
newspaper with a I. lory of 61 years into a trade
journal to be published by. and for, the "icd
hots."
That is why the Daily staff walked out. They
no longer had a newspaper with which to work.
All that was left was a trade journal.
The Legislature is welcome to it. And, for
what it's worth, they are welcome to my un
qualified condemnation and disgust.

A Strike for' Principle
Editor, The Daily:
For three frustrating weeks The Daily fought
for a principle only to see it ludicrously violated
at last night's Legislature meeting.
The principle- (hat of a free, independent and
vital press was not supported by The Daily for
reasons of personal or professional pride. It was
backed by the sincere feeling that Stanford stu
dents deserve more than a "trade journal" of the
ASSU a propaganda sheet for the empty shell
of what was once a student government.
The "trade journal" approach is not idle specu
lation. This is what ASSU President Bob Kreelen
has said The Daily should be.
The Daily staff walked out because it could no
longer stand the appalling hypocrisy that perme
ated the air- of Legislature's maneuverings and
counter-maneuverings.
It walked out because it felt that The Daily
would no longer be a newspaper in any true sense
of the word, should it be brought under the pro
tective wing of a student government organ.
It walked out; because it felt, the students be
lieved in this principle also. It drew this conclu
sion at least in part from the more than 1200
petition signatures that were gathered in a 36-
hour period.
Many will ask if the legislation is sufficiently
serious to merit a protest strike. True, it was
compromise legislation, but that does not make
it any more palatable.
Should Legislature feel distaste for a newly
elected editor, all it has to do is to cast him out
by a simple majority vote the vote of 10 persons.
Legislature then turns the matter back to the
Daily staff to choose an editor it does not want,
an editor it may feel reluctant to work under.
Selection of an editor and this may indeed
evolve into that must not be a political matter.
No interest group and certainly it must be
said that Legislature is an interest group—has
any ethical right to toss out: a duly chosen editor
of a newspaper. This would be indirect political
control, but political control nevertheless.
As The Daily has said, only the Daily staff
knows the true merits of an editorial candidate
how he writes, how he works with the staff, how
he thinks, how he administers.
Should Legislature decide to turn an editor
down, it would be on the grounds that he "prob
ably" will not act "in the best interests of the
students."
How, I cannot help wondering, is legislature
to be blessed with this infinite wisdom? What
qualifications does it have to judge the merits
or demerits ol a prospective editor?
Actually, this is beside the point. The basic
factor here is that Legislature must not be al
lowed to silence, or intimidate, the one organ of
criticism existing on campus. A news sheet
shaped in its image would present no challenge
to the mind ot the Stanford student; it would be
an insult to his intelligence.
If one real criticism can be made of The Daily,
it is that it does not criticize enough. Prevalent
student attitudes and actions should be chal
lenged continually.
Intimidation is obviously not the answer. An
editor must answer only his own conscience and
the collective consciences of his readers.
He must l)e responsible in the highest sense
of the word responsible to the students and re
sponsible to his sense of obligation to publish a
forthright, challenging, thoughtful and independ
ent newspaper. •

With Disgust . . .
Editor, The Daily:
This Issue of The Daily marks the end of an
era; the shutting off of the only organized voice
of independence which has ever existed at Stan
ford University.
For Those unfamiliar with student government
here, Legislature's stated motive for its decision
to lake unto itself the right of approving the
editor of The Stanford Daily—cooperation may
seem a valid one.
But for those initiated into the inane operations
of this play-at-government, the real motive stands
out clearly. Simply, the Legislature—or, rather,
certain members of the body wanted control.
Now they have it.
The Daily, before last, night, could claim an
almost unique place in the collegiate newspaper
field. Here was one of the few such papers which
was not in the control of the "red-hots"; which
spoke with a voice independent of the sickening
immaturity of the usual student government
"red-hot."
Now -the "red-hots" can pattern The Daily
along their own lines, "in the best interests" of
the ASSU, whom they pretend to represent, and
"in the best interests" of the University, which
they do represent.
Whether The Daily is published in the best
interest;, of the grooving and inquiring minds it
reaches is immaterial to them. They would have
the paper a trade journal, publishing Their own
petty efforts and adding to the glorious Stanford
spirit. The individual be damned. Press freedom
be damned. Principles be damned.
_ There are some who say this piece of restric
tive legislation does not mean control; that The
Daily can still be free to print what it believes
the real students want, not what the small pres
sure groups want. Those who hold this belief
are wrong.
For if the Daily editor becomes responsible to
the ASSU legislature his conduct will then have
to conform to their desires. And from past con
duct I firmly believe that what the ASSU Legis
lature wants, and what the campus wants—and
must have if we are to escape the smug adoration
of the status quo that pervades Stanford—are
not one and the same.
Legislatui said they wanted cooperation. They
lied. They wanted control. They were given
cooperation—much more than 1 would have given
them, considering their true motives and under
handed methods—and they refused it. Instead
they continued legislating, until they had what
they really wanted control

ing way to protest the action of a body of student,
government "red-hots" who have so far shown
