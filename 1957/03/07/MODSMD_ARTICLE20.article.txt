Stanford funs who feel the Indian bandsmen have outplayed the
hands of both Southern Cal anu IJt'LA and thus compensated for the
Indian basketmen's losses to those two aggregations have another
think coming.
That is the opinion of one David C. Henley, sports writer and
self-styled music critic for the SC Daily Trojan. Henley said, "Al
though Stanford's musical group was almost twice the size of its
southern counterpart, this writer heard many avid Indian rooters
state, 'We certainly wish we had a band as good as SC's.' "
This writer grants that SC certainly outplayed the Stanford Band
whe/i ii came to loudness. Perhaps the shakiriess of the Card quint
that weekend in dropping two games could be attributed to shattered
eardrums.
Alter ail the IiSC band, for Bond, Wagner, Isaacs, Neumann
ami llaga, was a new experience. Rogers, Sterkel, Dye, Pugh and
(ioir/.ales of SC at least were used to hearing the Figueroa Street
eardrum splitters and undoubtedly bad their mental earmuffs* on.
In answer to Henley's proud statements about the noble SC band,
all this writer can say is that il' the southern group of "musicians"
attempted to sing, they would be known as hog callers. But since
the Trojan trumpeters are would-be bandsmen, 1 don't know quite
what derogatory thing to call them.
Henley should have confined is journalistic exploits to extolling
the virtues of Coach Forrest Twogood's basketballers. There, at
least, SC has some talking points. But even the cage Trojans would
he nothing without a spindly-legged will-of-the-wisp guard named
Danny Rogers.
lingers needs 38 points, minus what he scores Tuesday night, in
his remaining games (against Cal this weekend) to replace Bill
S harm an (now burning up the pro league* as the greatest single
season scorer in SC history.
The Trojan captain has swished IDS points, plus Tuesday's
game, so far. Ahead of him stands Sliarman's record of 446 tallies.
Only Sharman, 1950; Roy Irvin, 19&4, and Rogers have ever
< blinked in more than 100 points a season for the Figueroa Street
eager*.
Rogers has already broken three records this yearâ€” most free
1 brows attempted in one game, 18; most free throws made in one
game, 16, and most free throws attempted in one season, 202.
Trojan Coach Forrest Twogood believes in utilizing California's
excellent junior college system to recruit his ace teams.
Four of live starters this year are junior college transfers. Monte
Con/ales, dribbling maniac of a guard, is from College of the Se
quoias; liig Jim Sterkel and Rogers, Fullerton Junior College, and
l J hil Dye, Valley Junior College.
And on the basis of double wins over Cal and UCLA and their
late-season surge, the Trojans would be the logical choice to repre
sent the league in the national tournament.
Meanwhile, in the Daily Trojan office, Henley is not the only
sportswriter to be gloating these days. Said writer Joe .lares:
"Listening to tlie Stanford-SC games last weekend on the radio
was a pleasant experience. The two victories, and the almost sure
wins in baseball and track, should give the Trojans ample revenge
for the football defeat."
