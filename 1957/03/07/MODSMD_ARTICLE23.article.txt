# Fresno State, Olympic Stars In Saturday's Track Meet
## Agostini, Robinson Head Bulldog Attack, Other Olympic Stars Entered 
### Dick Barnes 
Fresno State and its outstand
ing sprint - hurdle duo of Mike
Agostini and Ancel Robinson
have been added to the field for
Saturday's odd-event track and
field meet on Angell Field at 1:30.
Stanford, San Jose State, the
Olympic Club and the Santa Clara
Youth Center are the other en
t rants.
Agostini and two other competi
tors from the 1956 Olympic
Games will headline the entries.
Running for Trinidad, Agostini
placed fourth in the 20(1- and sixth
in the 100-meter dashes.
Agostini also won two world
record races last season. March
17, he broke the 220-yard dash
mark with a 20.1 effort, only to
see it again cracked three months
later by Dave Sime. Early in
June, Agostini tied the world
mark of 9.3 in the 100.
Other Olympians
The other Olympians, both
members of the U.S. team, are
George Mattos and Herm Wilson.
Mattos surprised the experts
when he vaulted 11-IOVi to make
the U.S. team. In the Olympics,
he could negotiate only 14-314,
but captured fourth place.
While Mattos represents the
Olympic Club, Wilson will be
competing for the SCYC. He has
leaped 6-9 1 , and placed ninth in
the Melbourne spectacle.
Olympians are by no means the
only outstanding men who will
be in the meet. Robinson, the
Fresno hurdler, sped to, 14.1 and
22.5 clockings last spring, with
the latter clocking ranking sec
ond in the world for 1956.
SCYC Star
In addition to Agostini, the
sprints will feature the SCYC's
Dick Brown. While a San Jose
high schooler in 1956, Brown
raced the century and furlong in
9.6 and 21.0, both marks being
among the best; U.S. prep efforts
of last, season.
Of interest to local fans will be
the appearand 1 of Keith Browns
berger, former Stanford sprinter,
who will be wearing the colors of
the Winged-O.
Another pair of Olympic Club
bers, Leo Long and John Bugge,
are expected to dominate the jav
elin. Long's effort of 246-2 was
fifth best in the U.S.A. last year,
with Bugge's 239-7 1 u good for
ninth spoj.
Strong in 1320
San Jose is entering a well bal
anced trio in the 1320 and should
score heavily in that event. Wes
Bond, cross-country star from the
fall, as registered a 4:21.0 clock
ing for the mile, with Fred Green

and Mike Yeager just one second
behind.
A former Occidental College J
runner, Ed Shinn, tops entries in j
the 352. Shinn ripped through a
47.4 quarter-mile last year, at
full two seconds better than any j
other man in the race. Although j
the 352-yard distance appears un- I
usual, il is a standard workout i
race because of the fact that by j
adding 11 seconds to a man's time j
for that distance, his theoretical
time for the full 440 can be accu
rately determined.
Stanford Change
One change has been made by
Coach Payton Jordan in the In
dian entries. He has inserted Don
Chesarek into the 660 in place of
the injured Ernie Cunliffe.
Although Cunliffe's injury ap
pears to bo nothing more than a
slight tendon or muscle strain,
Jordan noted that the season is
.still young and that there is no
point in taking a chance on a
more serious injury being in
curred.

t rants.
Agostini and two other competi
tors from the 1956 Olympic
Games will headline the entries.
Running for Trinidad, Agostini
placed fourth in the 20(1- and sixth
in the 100-meter dashes.
Agostini also won two world
record races last season. March
17, he broke the 220-yard dash
mark with a 20.1 effort, only to
see it again cracked three months
later by Dave Sime. Early in
June, Agostini tied the world
mark of 9.3 in the 100.
Other Olympians
The other Olympians, both
members of the U.S. team, are
George Mattos and Herm Wilson.
Mattos surprised the experts
when he vaulted 11-IOVi to make
the U.S. team. In the Olympics,
he could negotiate only 14-314,
but captured fourth place.
While Mattos represents the
Olympic Club, Wilson will be
competing for the SCYC. He has
leaped 6-9 1 , and placed ninth in
the Melbourne spectacle.
Olympians are by no means the
only outstanding men who will
be in the meet. Robinson, the
Fresno hurdler, sped to, 14.1 and
22.5 clockings last spring, with
the latter clocking ranking sec
ond in the world for 1956.
SCYC Star
In addition to Agostini, the
sprints will feature the SCYC's
Dick Brown. While a San Jose
high schooler in 1956, Brown
raced the century and furlong in
9.6 and 21.0, both marks being
among the best; U.S. prep efforts
of last, season.
Of interest to local fans will be
the appearand 1 of Keith Browns
berger, former Stanford sprinter,
who will be wearing the colors of
the Winged-O.
Another pair of Olympic Club
bers, Leo Long and John Bugge,
are expected to dominate the jav
elin. Long's effort of 246-2 was
fifth best in the U.S.A. last year,
with Bugge's 239-7 1 u good for
ninth spoj.
Strong in 1320
San Jose is entering a well bal
anced trio in the 1320 and should
score heavily in that event. Wes
Bond, cross-country star from the
fall, as registered a 4:21.0 clock
ing for the mile, with Fred Green

and Mike Yeager just one second
behind.
A former Occidental College J
runner, Ed Shinn, tops entries in j
the 352. Shinn ripped through a
47.4 quarter-mile last year, at
full two seconds better than any j
other man in the race. Although j
the 352-yard distance appears un- I
usual, il is a standard workout i
race because of the fact that by j
adding 11 seconds to a man's time j
for that distance, his theoretical
time for the full 440 can be accu
rately determined.
Stanford Change
One change has been made by
Coach Payton Jordan in the In
dian entries. He has inserted Don
Chesarek into the 660 in place of
the injured Ernie Cunliffe.
Although Cunliffe's injury ap
pears to bo nothing more than a
slight tendon or muscle strain,
Jordan noted that the season is
.still young and that there is no
point in taking a chance on a
more serious injury being in
curred.
Fresno State and its outstand
ing sprint - hurdle duo of Mike
Agostini and Ancel Robinson
have been added to the field for
Saturday's odd-event track and
field meet on Angell Field at 1:30.
