## The 						Last Straw 
### 
Wi m u uin«.
I.egislature has tried lo force coopenilion
down our throat*. We've taken ;dl llic abuse
wc could {Mid we're siclv of il. T|»e whole
stall is walking out and will not return until
tlie present legislation is rescinded.
We I iave said "cooperation without legis
lation. We presented signatures ol appro;.i
malclv 12<>l) people asking lor no legislation
concerning I lie l)aily. I hey were ignored,
lliev were even laughed at h\ llie student
hotly presidenl, who got less voles last spring
than were in the petitions.
I'roiu the beginning of the present volume
Legislature has thrown one lactic allot ,»n
other at The Daily. Three days alter the be
ginning of this volume, there was an ev ent i\ e
session ol Legislature in which the I >;» i I y
editor was grilled for the major mi--laki-s
which have occurred in the last few years
o( I lie I)aily.
Alter receiving assurances from the siudcnl
Immlv presidenl and the administrative assist
ant to llie presidenl t! i ;• | cooperation without
legislation could he worked lor, w<- ,-aw nulli
in*: hut control measures come up.
llie ameudincnj thai passed last nighj was
""the loot m the door that the adlniuisl raliv e
assistant to the president so completely dis

counted. Ihe liaison 01 investigation com
mittee had yet to hie its refiort. II this legis
lation is allowed, we see. nothing hut the be
ginning o| the end for llie Stanford Daily.
I he Daily is in a uni'pie position; we don I
want lo lose that position. If Legislature
wauls a I M ii I1 ill hoard, then I hey can have il.
I here will he no leeliug of freedom for an
a soeiate editor il he feels his election must
he approved hv Legislature.
I lie originator ol the amendment explained
il 111 is wa\ : "We want lo show The Daily
where ii- responsibility lies." We contend
our responsibility lies toward the student
cominunitv, not toward a narrow group bent
on allv kind ol legislation,
\\ e fjuestion the manner in which the legis
lation was passed—two votes from one repre
f-.enJafive, and vole hy the student body presi-
I»: • - i«• all y we arc complclclv disgusted with
I .eejslat ure s attitude. I hey had done noth
ing all veai until ihey decided that Ihe
Daily wasu • making every organization on
• Miilpus happy and il was time to knock it
down a couple of notches.
\\ r .ire walking out foi an ideal— an ideal
nl i free, enlightened, critical Stanford Daily
wiiji no legislative shackles on it
