## 
### 
University officials last night I
discussed the new fraternity pol
icy with the Interfraternity Alum '
ni Conference, the organization
composed of the 21 house-owning
corporations.
About 100 men, including a
large sprinkling of undergraduate
fraternity members, gathered in
Bowman Alumni House.
Assistant to the President Ken
neth Cuthbertson displayed a map
showing where the first of the
four-unit fraternity living groups;
would be located. Sites are behind
the Knoll and the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house.
In 20 Years
"Eventually, say in 20 years, we
plan to build these units in part
I of the area now occupied by fra !
I lernities and Women's Row," he
said.
William (I. Craig, Dean of Men,
stressed the economic motives tie
hind the new policy and said thai 1
many of the smaller details, such
as architecture of new units, still
have to be worked out.
Assistant Business M a n a g e i
| Dwight B. Adams explained that
, the idea of four units sharing a
| common kitchen was baser I on the
fact that 200 persons results in
i the maximum of economy for
! preparing food.
Tax Free
Under the new system the Uni
versity would eventually own all
fraternity buildings. An alumnus
I wishing to donate to one could
i give money, tax free, to the Uni
: versity with "preference," not
"stipulation," that it go to a cer
tain house.
i If an alumnus gave directly to
| a house he would have to pay a i
large federal lax.
