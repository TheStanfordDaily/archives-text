# Sterling Says University Seeks Solution to Grading Problems
## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling, commenting on Stanford's giadmg sys
tem last night said, ' ft the student body is upgraded on competition
shouldn't something happen to distribution of grades 7 In a sense,
Stanford's grading is penalizing students who apply for admission
to a good professional school "
This was the second time the University's grading system was


mentioned in the Stanford Today
and Tomorrow Series of 1957.
Sterling stressed that grading is
a matter of deep concern, and
added that the University is work
ing toward a solution.
Another topic brought up at
the ST&T meeting held at the
Delta Upsilon house was that of
the proposed building of the medical school and the new hospital.
Bring School Closer
Due to the fact that the future
of medical education is linked
with 'he progression and develop
ment of medical science it was
fcl< by 'he University that a bet
ter team could be formed by
bringing the school closer to the
other sciences
"The doctor of the future needs
to be not only a competent scien-
tist and skilled craftsman, but a
more broadly educated man. How
can a school produce a doctor of
tomorrow unless he is in an edu-
cational atmosphere?" said Ster-
ling.
''The solution may rest in bring-
ing the school itself closer to the
University. Thus, it is being built
on campus."
First Stage Goal
Thirteen million dollars has
now been realized toward the first
stage goal of $22,500,000 for the
school and hospital, tentatively to
open in 1959
Following Sterling's brief intro-
diuction of Stanford's plans and
policies for the present and fu-
ture, he answered questions from
the floor.
The president's talk was one of
four given last night at the final
program in the ST&T series.
Steve Halsted acted as moderator
for Sterling.
