— far exceeds Ihe supply/And, from now on in, you
are going to be sought after more than a triple threat
halfback for next year's varsity.
You will be promised many things (including the
moon with a fence/around it), and for a young man
just getting started these things are pretty hard
to resist.
So, again, let's be frank. We at Farnsworlh won't

/ just one of the herd.
/ We earnestly invite you to hear the whole fascinating
/ Farnsworth story. We're pretty certain it will moke
