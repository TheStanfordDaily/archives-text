Because of the nature of the Legislature meeting last Wednesday
night, a further and full report upon it is necessary. A report upon
the action taken after the meeting and upon the alternatives open to
both sides of the issue is also necessary.
In action other than Hie passage of the Daily proposal, Legislature

approved the contracts of two
Concert Series artists for next
year, appropriated funds for both
the hostel and foreign students'
vacations, and passed the Branner
constitution.
The appropriation of $300 for
foreign student vacations was
marie because the Legislature felt
I hat the present budget of .$1" per
student to cover all expenses was
too small to allow them any free
dom to travel.
Daily Standing Rules
The passage of the Daily stand
ing rules amendment was a con
fused affair marked by many
amendments to the original pro
posal, two of which were passed
and affected the final wording of
the proposal.
The first amendment lo the
proposal was one adding a pro
vision for the election of a new
editor, should the Legislature fail
to approve the editor presented
to it.
The second amendment which
passed struck out two sentences
of the proposal dealing with the
power of recall of the editor by a
petition of 5 per cent of the .stu
dent body and a three - fourths
vote of Legislature.
Final Proposal
The proposal, as finally passed,
reads as follows: "The editor as
elected bv The Daily shall be ap
proved by a majority vote of the
AS.Xtr Legislature. In thp event :
of disapproval by Legislature an
other election shall be held within
seven days, with the old editor re
maining in office until the new
editor has been elected and ap
proved." No other provisions are
included in the amendment.
Voting on the proposal, when it
finally reached the floor in its
final form, was confused by a
number of technicalities involving
the right of a member to cast a

proxy vote for another member."
At this point the position of the
Daily staff was not clear. A ques
tion was asked from the floor re
garding what action The Daily
planner! i.o take. No answer was
given, and a ma jority of the Daily
staff present walked out.
After the adjournment of Lee
islature it was discovered that
the Daily staff planned a walkout
beginning with today's issue and
ending only when the amendment
had been rescinded. Members of
Legislature met with members of
the Daily staff, but succeeded
only in arranging a meeting to
be held this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
The Daily would not agree to hold
up its walkout until further nego
tiation liarl proved Iha4 no agree
ment could be reached.
The position of those members
of Legislature directly concerned
with the walkout appears to he as
follows: that a walkout of the
Daily staff was a perfectly legal
thing, but that such a walkout
should not have begun until ne
gotiation had shown that no other
means of action were available or
possible.
Contract Obligations
This position appears to be es
tablished on the grounds that The
Daily has contract obligations
with its advertisers which neces
sitate publication if at all possi
ble; that The Daily is constitu
tionally committed to publication
five days a week, with certain ex
ceptions for dead and finals
weeks; that no matter what ac
tion was taken by Legislature.
In light of 'he Daily staff ac
lion, three other means of redress
arc possible. The fir.st is a pett
tion for referendum by 5 per cent
of the student body (a measure
now in progress, after the walk
out has occurred); the second is
a proposal to Publications Board
to repeal the amendment, and the
third is a direct proposal by a
member of Legislature to effect
the same ends.
Forceful Action
Rut the Daily position appears
to be as follows: that only a force
ful course of action would lead
Legislature to repeal the amend
ment; that no action presented to
Legislature without this walkout
to dramatize it would stand a
chance of being successful, and
that the process of referendum
was too slow and cumbersome.
The reasons behind the amend
ment, and the opposition of the
Daily staff toward it, have been
debated and discussed for the last
four weeks. In that time a num
ber of proposals have been ad
vanced and passed or defeated,
according to their merits, by vote
of Legislature. The issue now at
stake appears to be whether any
legislation of any nature affect
ing The Daily should be passed
by Legislature. The Daily does
not feel that any should; the Leg
islature felt some was necessary
and passed it last Wednesday.

elected bv The Daily shall be ap
proved by a majority vote of the
AS.Xtr Legislature. In thp event :
of disapproval by Legislature an
other election shall be held within
seven days, with the old editor re
maining in office until the new
editor has been elected and ap
proved." No other provisions are
included in the amendment.
Voting on the proposal, when it
finally reached the floor in its
final form, was confused by a
number of technicalities involving
the right of a member to cast a

proxy vote for another member."
At this point the position of the
Daily staff was not clear. A ques
tion was asked from the floor re
garding what action The Daily
planner! i.o take. No answer was
given, and a ma jority of the Daily
staff present walked out.
After the adjournment of Lee
islature it was discovered that
the Daily staff planned a walkout
beginning with today's issue and
ending only when the amendment
had been rescinded. Members of
Legislature met with members of
the Daily staff, but succeeded
only in arranging a meeting to
be held this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
The Daily would not agree to hold
up its walkout until further nego
tiation liarl proved Iha4 no agree
ment could be reached.
The position of those members
of Legislature directly concerned
with the walkout appears to he as
follows: that a walkout of the
Daily staff was a perfectly legal
thing, but that such a walkout
should not have begun until ne
gotiation had shown that no other
means of action were available or
possible.
Contract Obligations
This position appears to be es
tablished on the grounds that The
Daily has contract obligations
with its advertisers which neces
sitate publication if at all possi
ble; that The Daily is constitu
tionally committed to publication
five days a week, with certain ex
ceptions for dead and finals
weeks; that no matter what ac
tion was taken by Legislature.
In light of 'he Daily staff ac
lion, three other means of redress
arc possible. The fir.st is a pett
tion for referendum by 5 per cent
of the student body (a measure
now in progress, after the walk
out has occurred); the second is
a proposal to Publications Board
to repeal the amendment, and the
third is a direct proposal by a
member of Legislature to effect
the same ends.
Forceful Action
Rut the Daily position appears
to be as follows: that only a force
ful course of action would lead
Legislature to repeal the amend
ment; that no action presented to
Legislature without this walkout
to dramatize it would stand a
chance of being successful, and
that the process of referendum
was too slow and cumbersome.
The reasons behind the amend
ment, and the opposition of the
Daily staff toward it, have been
debated and discussed for the last
four weeks. In that time a num
ber of proposals have been ad
vanced and passed or defeated,
according to their merits, by vote
of Legislature. The issue now at
stake appears to be whether any
legislation of any nature affect
ing The Daily should be passed
by Legislature. The Daily does
not feel that any should; the Leg
islature felt some was necessary
and passed it last Wednesday.

Because of the nature of the Legislature meeting last Wednesday
night, a further and full report upon it is necessary. A report upon
the action taken after the meeting and upon the alternatives open to
both sides of the issue is also necessary.
In action other than Hie passage of the Daily proposal, Legislature

approved the contracts of two
Concert Series artists for next
year, appropriated funds for both
the hostel and foreign students'
vacations, and passed the Branner
constitution.
The appropriation of $300 for
foreign student vacations was
marie because the Legislature felt
I hat the present budget of .$1" per
student to cover all expenses was
too small to allow them any free
dom to travel.
Daily Standing Rules
The passage of the Daily stand
ing rules amendment was a con
fused affair marked by many
amendments to the original pro
posal, two of which were passed
and affected the final wording of
the proposal.
The first amendment lo the
proposal was one adding a pro
vision for the election of a new
editor, should the Legislature fail
to approve the editor presented
to it.
The second amendment which
passed struck out two sentences
of the proposal dealing with the
power of recall of the editor by a
petition of 5 per cent of the .stu
dent body and a three - fourths
vote of Legislature.
Final Proposal
The proposal, as finally passed,
reads as follows: "The editor as

should not have begun until ne
gotiation had shown that no other
means of action were available or
possible.
Contract Obligations
This position appears to be es
tablished on the grounds that The
Daily has contract obligations
with its advertisers which neces
sitate publication if at all possi
ble; that The Daily is constitu
tionally committed to publication
five days a week, with certain ex
ceptions for dead and finals
weeks; that no matter what ac
tion was taken by Legislature.
In light of 'he Daily staff ac
lion, three other means of redress
arc possible. The fir.st is a pett
tion for referendum by 5 per cent
of the student body (a measure
now in progress, after the walk
out has occurred); the second is
a proposal to Publications Board
to repeal the amendment, and the
third is a direct proposal by a
member of Legislature to effect
the same ends.
Forceful Action
Rut the Daily position appears
to be as follows: that only a force
ful course of action would lead
Legislature to repeal the amend
ment; that no action presented to
Legislature without this walkout
to dramatize it would stand a
chance of being successful, and
that the process of referendum
was too slow and cumbersome.
The reasons behind the amend
ment, and the opposition of the
Daily staff toward it, have been
debated and discussed for the last
four weeks. In that time a num
ber of proposals have been ad
vanced and passed or defeated,
according to their merits, by vote
of Legislature. The issue now at
stake appears to be whether any
legislation of any nature affect
ing The Daily should be passed
by Legislature. The Daily does
not feel that any should; the Leg
islature felt some was necessary
and passed it last Wednesday.


DESPONDENT DAILY EDITOR WATCHES—Dave Scott, Daily
editor (Hiirfl from left) looks on as affirmative vote is cast against
his principles by (left to right) John Cardoza, Bruce lliiichliffc,

Because of the nature of the Legislature meeting last Wednesday
night, a further and full report upon it is necessary. A report upon
the action taken after the meeting and upon the alternatives open to
both sides of the issue is also necessary.
In action other than Hie passage of the Daily proposal, Legislature

approved the contracts of two
Concert Series artists for next
year, appropriated funds for both
the hostel and foreign students'
vacations, and passed the Branner
constitution.
The appropriation of $300 for
foreign student vacations was
marie because the Legislature felt
I hat the present budget of .$1" per
student to cover all expenses was
too small to allow them any free
dom to travel.
Daily Standing Rules
The passage of the Daily stand
ing rules amendment was a con
fused affair marked by many
amendments to the original pro
posal, two of which were passed
and affected the final wording of
the proposal.
The first amendment lo the
proposal was one adding a pro
vision for the election of a new
editor, should the Legislature fail
to approve the editor presented
to it.
The second amendment which
passed struck out two sentences
of the proposal dealing with the
power of recall of the editor by a
petition of 5 per cent of the .stu
dent body and a three - fourths
vote of Legislature.
Final Proposal
The proposal, as finally passed,
reads as follows: "The editor as
elected bv The Daily shall be ap
proved by a majority vote of the
AS.Xtr Legislature. In thp event :
of disapproval by Legislature an
other election shall be held within
seven days, with the old editor re
maining in office until the new
editor has been elected and ap
proved." No other provisions are
included in the amendment.
Voting on the proposal, when it
finally reached the floor in its
final form, was confused by a
number of technicalities involving
the right of a member to cast a

proxy vote for another member."
At this point the position of the
Daily staff was not clear. A ques
tion was asked from the floor re
garding what action The Daily
planner! i.o take. No answer was
given, and a ma jority of the Daily
staff present walked out.
After the adjournment of Lee
islature it was discovered that
the Daily staff planned a walkout
beginning with today's issue and
ending only when the amendment
had been rescinded. Members of
Legislature met with members of
the Daily staff, but succeeded
only in arranging a meeting to
be held this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
The Daily would not agree to hold
up its walkout until further nego
tiation liarl proved Iha4 no agree
ment could be reached.
The position of those members
of Legislature directly concerned
with the walkout appears to he as
follows: that a walkout of the
Daily staff was a perfectly legal
thing, but that such a walkout
should not have begun until ne
gotiation had shown that no other
means of action were available or
possible.
