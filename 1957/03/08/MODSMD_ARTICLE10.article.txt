# IFC Suspends Phi Gamma Delta From Social Life
## 
### 
The five-man judicial council of
the Interfraternity Coune 1 hand
ed down stiff penalties to the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity yester
day. The house is on social sus
pension for the rest of the 1956-
57 academic year.
A particular case involving two
men in the house was turn?;! over
to Men's Council.
The Fijis have been on proba
tion for the first part of this year
for borrowing a slide projector
without permission and th?n for
getting to return it. They have
since been involved ir such
pranks as squirting a fire extin
guisher in someone's face and
lighting a barrel of kerosene in
the vacant lot across from their
house.
The judicial council suspended
a measure to place the hov -
under social suspension for the
1957-58 year. If this measui"? were
put into effect, it would prevent,
the Fijis from participating in
rushing.
This action by the judicial
council is subject to review by the
University administration.
