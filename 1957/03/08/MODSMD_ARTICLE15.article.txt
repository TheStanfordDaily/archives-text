Accomplishment ?
The Editor:
Now you, the members of Legislature, really
have cooperation. You have forced the Daily
staff out and yourselves in. But what has been
accomplished?
The Daily staff has hied, since the beginning
of this volume, to publish a paper that pleases
mosil of the student organizations, all demanding
.'.pace on page ]. The staff have had to spend a
great, deal of their time running to Legislature
meetings or "liaison" committees, or circulating
petitions because the staff honestly felt their
rights were in danger.
The ASSIJ offic! 's have all protested thai they
only wanted "cooperation" and "responsibility"
from The Daily, S. .era! officials have actually
admitted that they never seriously thought any
of their;; proposals would be passed by Legisla
ture In other words, the legislative measures
were onjjy meant to intimidate the Daily staff
and iovofi cooperation?
Admittedly, the staff walkout was not too wise.
Certain Advertising contracts demanded, in effect,
ihat a Daily be published on Friday. For this
reason, and this reason alone, the ASSIJ had an
obligation to publish today.
But why did Legislature not show such en
thusiasm before? Why did the ASSIJ officials
call for cooperation again arid again without ever
sitting down with Ihe Daily staff to work out
their mutual problems? If Ihe Associated Stu
dents really wanted cooperation, why didn't they
at least: attempt to cooperate?
Putting out a paper today only proves one
thingâ€”wldch this campus probably already
knows- -that with sufficient effort anyone could
put out The Daily ONCE. Would Freelen, Shoup,
Mathewsori, Tallent and others like this responsi
bility five times a week? If so, then the present
Daily staff would probably let them.
I am not speaking as a member of the Daily
staff. In fact, I have had reasonably little to do
with the whole controversy this quarter. Yet I
can't.help feeling that this whole tempest could
be easily quieted. The Daily staff want to put
out a' paper that accurately reflects campus life
and that, pleases the campus readers. The Legis
lature wants a Daily that cooperates and, conse
quently, gives substantial publicity to student,
functions. Such aims are not incompatible. If
Legislature could abandon its policy of coopera
tion through legislation, and if the Daily staff
could swallow its pride and return to the Shack
where they belong, the campus would benefit
greatly.

Slu-Faculty Plan
Editor of The Daily:
Student-Faculty Commission announced to The
Daily early in February, with little result, that
the replies from a campus-wide letter and ques
tionnaire to the faculty had been tabulated. We
are now happy to be able 1o get the news to the
student body. These letters were sent out at the
beginning of the quarter to measure the faculty
interest in participating in such a program. Five
hundred of the questionnaires were returned,
many of which had extensive comments, the
nature of which indicated that the faculty is
extremely enthusiastic about and eager to par
ticipate in any type of entertainment at which
they could meet students on a personal level.
They do not feel that "just another lecture" is
beneficial in furthering student-faculty relations,
but that conversation with a small group of in
terested students is of value lo all concerned.
It is because of this desire expressed by Ihe
faculty for being entertained by small groups
that the fund for student-faculty entertainment
was set up so that as few as three students can
entertain a member of the faculty for a meal or
after-dinner coffee in a University residence. The
student need only to submit the bill to the dean's
office through the residence director. This new
concept in student-faculty entertainment is not
to replace such events as the "lunch plan," but
merely to supplement them. The faculty has now
shown their interest; it's up to the students.

Daily Temper Tantrum
The Editor:
The Daily staf lost any right it ever had to
respect last night v en it ran screaming away
from ils problems, instead of standing up to
them. Dave Scott and his evidently subservient
crew decided, like all spoiled children, to throw
a temper tantrum and see if the mean old Legis
lature wouldn't renege. Well, I hope devoutly
that the Legislature stays exactly where it is.
Every man who voted in favor of the amendment
particularly Dick Griilo, who was willing lo
take the responsibility for two votes is to be
congratulated for his recognition that the legis
lature cannot simply let things go by it.
The siaff of The Daily, under the editorial
board, failed on Its responsibility to it* advei
tisers and Its readers. Moreover, it made it as
difficult as possible to continue publishing the
paper by acts of minor sabotage.
This edition proves that the oaper will be pub
lished, regardless of the old staff. I hope they

decide to come back before a new staff is re
cruited; but, it they don't, I see no reason why
ihey should be allowed to manage it.
The business staff should be congratulated for
staying with the paper.

From Oilier (lampuses
The Editor:
When the Daily staff walked out, they fired
the shot heard 'round the Daily Shack and almost
up to the end of the block.
Thai shot has caused international repercus
sions from campuses as far off as Menlo Park.
Rioting in sympathy with the martyred staff
members appeared inevitable to Ihe faculty at
Oak Knoll Elementary School as lour students
rose to walk out of Miss Frigate's third-grade
class three minutes before recess. It turned out
to be a false alarm, however. A hasty check by
school officials revealed ihai two of the students
had to go to Ihe bathroom and the other two were
unidentified Stanford students who thought they
were in a Journalism 109 lecture. There were no
ill effects of the panic, fortunately, except for tlie
fact that the mothers ol the two children who
had to go to the bathroom were calling for an
investigation of the school cafeteria. The princi
pal, wiping his brow, was quoted as saying:
"Nothing of this gravity has occurred since the
school board voted to ban coeducational lava
tories."
On Ihe campus at the iowa State Prison Farm
similar uprisings were being staged. One con
vict, Hiram "Greasy-Head" Goosick, walked out.
of his cell, shooting three guards en route. When
a Daily reporter asked his reason, he slated that
"the warden was not living up to his policy of
cooperation without legislation." Caryl Chess
man agreed in a 3!3-page brief". Goosick claimed
that every man had a right, according to Mrs.
Stanford's will, to 60 years of freedom. He prom
ised to return on his 00th birthday.
Elsewhere, students were not remaining idle
over this vital issue. Daily reporters covering a
riot at the University of Kenya learned that ii
was caused by a popular belief that Dick Meister
was God. Meister has offered no denial.
At Columbia University, Daily reporters con
tacted Charles Van Doren for his opinion on the
matter. His comment was, "I don't know.any
thing about it."
U.S. Steel dropped two points.
The President's basal metabolism gained two.
The University of Chicago dropped football.
The University of Alabama announced that
Autherine Lucy's grades were not what they
should be.
In the excitement, Charles Goren led away
from a king.
The University of Georgia announced plans to
purchase Little Richard and Fats Domino. They
hope to trade Ihe former to Georgia Tech for
Ralph Bunche and an unnamed amount of cash.
Eleanor Roosevelt could not be reached for
comment. 1

One Man's Opinion
To the Editor:
Last night, as a member of Legislature. 1 voted
against the proposed amendment, since I felt it
might lead to continued friction with The Daily
and destroy any positive cooperation that has
been achieved in the last month. However, 1
don't think the Daily staff had any right to strike.
The paper has a responsibility to give so much
space to the advertisers per day, subject to breach
of contract; and, by walking out, The Daily has
shown its contempt for this responsibility, it the
staff felt their responsibility to freedom of the
press was stronger, they should have proceeded
through legal channels*, start a referendum peti
tliey are afraid of student opinion. A baby crip::
tion and pul it up to the students' vole unless
if his rattle is taken away, but, as an adult, re
sponsible editorial staff, 1 think they would want
to fight this issue with their powerful "voice ~i
tree press" Instead of striking.
