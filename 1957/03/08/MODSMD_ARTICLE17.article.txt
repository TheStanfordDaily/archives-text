action in walking out?
Troy Barbee, Alpha Tan Ome
ga, *59 "l ihink it was possibly
the best tiling that could »have
happened. 1 will be interested to
see how this staff rectifies the
policies lu which I hey were op
posed. '*
Diane Peek, Miilo, '5H "Actu
ally I think that ii is a good idea
because I don't think that any
group oil campus should have
control over the campus newspa
per. Under the circumstances 1
think it's a good move to have the
Legislature take over the respon
sibility of putting out the paper."
Bill Lawrence, AkL, 'flfl —"May-
be we can find out what's happen
ing here now."
<arni Eichelbergei*, t.uttob-
House, '57 - "I think we should
abolish The Daily entirely as well
as all reading matter, all tests ami
all papers."

"I'm for The Daily 100 per cent.
The Legislature has overstepped
its authority. We have a bunch ot
tin keys running Ibis school."
Kay Sprinkcl, rag, 'fit) "Both
sides are wrong. The LASSU is
trying to control Thfc Daily. The
Daily does not realize its position
on campus, thinking itself an in
dependent body, unconcerned
with, student needs. The Daily
staff acted like five-year olds in
their walking out."
l)on Rohan, Off< aniplis, \ r >!)
"I think that, under the circum
stances it was ihc wisest thing to
do. The Daily staff should not
touch the paper again until the
Legislature rescinds its ridiculous
legislation."
Ron Bondoc, '59, Quad "1
think that the Daily staff's walk
ing out was a breach of responst
bility because iheir acceptance of
their position was an implicit ac
ceptance of whatever restrictions
the official organs of our student
government deem fit to impose."
(iail Kii'kmau, IVli.rlo, '58 "1
think it's unfortunate thai the
Legislature had to put shackles
on The Daily; however, the Daily
staff has a responsibility to the
campus to put out the paper.
They have subscribers and adver
tising obligations which have to
be satisfied. The Legislature is
the representative body of the
campus and it is only right, that
they accept this responsibility
during the interim period."
Kandull Wilde, Outliers Memo,
morial <irad, Engineering "1
think lhe LASSU is out of its
head. The whole thing is ridicu
lous. The petition of The Daily
was ignored."
Tony .Meier, Phi kappa Psl, '57
"If the Legislature feels that
the Daily editor is not in all fair
ness representing the University
as a whole in the paper then cer
tainly he should be replaced. A
lot of Daily information lias been
either biased or incorrect."
