It's a scientific fact that girls reach emotional ma
turity earlier than boys. For this reason freshman girls
decline to make romantic alliances with freshman boys.
Thus, the freshman boys are left dateless, and many's
the night the entire freshman dorm sobs itself to sleep.
An equally damp situation exists among upper-class
girls. With upperclassmen being snapped up by freshman
girls, the poor upper-class girls are reduced to dreary,
manless evenings of Scrabble and home permanents.
There is a solution for this morbid situation — a very
simple solution. Why don't the two great have-not groups
find solace with one another?
True, there is something of an age differential, but
that need not matter. Take the case of Albert Payson
Sigafoos and Eustacia Vye.
Albert Payson, a freshman in sand and gravel at
Vanderbill. University, was walking across one
day, weeping softly in his loneliness. Blinded by tears,
he stumbled upon the supine form of Eustacia Vye, a
senior in wicker and raffia, who was collapsed in a
wretched heap 011 the turf.

"Why don't, you watch where you're going, you
squirt ?" said Eustacia peevishly.
"I'm sorry, lady," said Albert Payson and started to
move on. Hut suddenly he stopped, struck by an inspira
tion. "Lady," lie said, "you're miserable because you can't
get a date. So am I. So why don't we date each other?"
"Surely you jest!" cried Eustacia, looking with scorn
upon his youthful head and body.
"Oh, I know I'm younger than you are," said Albert
Payson, "bill that doesn't mean we can't find many splen
did things to do together."
"Like what?" asked Kustacia.
"Well," said Albert Payson, "we could get a third and
play some one-o-cat."
"Bah!" said Eustacia, grinding her teeth.
"All right then," said Albert Payson, "we could go
down lo the pond and skip some stones and maybe catch
a few frogs."
"Ugh!" said Eustacia, shuddering her entire length.
"How about some run-sheep-run?" he suggested.
"You are callow, green, and immature," said Eustacia#
"and i will thank you to absent yourself at once!"
Sighing, Albert Payson lit a cigarette and started
away.
"Stay!" cried Eustacia.
"Was that," she asked, "a Philip Morris you just lit?"
"What else?" said Albert Payson.
"Then you are not immature!" she cried, clasping
him to her clavicle. "For to smoke Philip Morris is tin?
very essence of wisdom, incontrovertible proof that you
know rich, natural pleasure from pale, poor substitutes!
Albert Payson, I am yours!"
And today they are married and run one of the biggest
wicker and rallia establishments inJßlue Earth, Minnesota.

It's a scientific fact that girls reach emotional ma
turity earlier than boys. For this reason freshman girls
decline to make romantic alliances with freshman boys.
Thus, the freshman boys are left dateless, and many's
the night the entire freshman dorm sobs itself to sleep.
An equally damp situation exists among upper-class
girls. With upperclassmen being snapped up by freshman
girls, the poor upper-class girls are reduced to dreary,
manless evenings of Scrabble and home permanents.
There is a solution for this morbid situation — a very
simple solution. Why don't the two great have-not groups
find solace with one another?
True, there is something of an age differential, but
that need not matter. Take the case of Albert Payson
Sigafoos and Eustacia Vye.
Albert Payson, a freshman in sand and gravel at
Vanderbill. University, was walking across one
day, weeping softly in his loneliness. Blinded by tears,
he stumbled upon the supine form of Eustacia Vye, a
senior in wicker and raffia, who was collapsed in a
wretched heap 011 the turf.

"Why don't, you watch where you're going, you
squirt ?" said Eustacia peevishly.
"I'm sorry, lady," said Albert Payson and started to
move on. Hut suddenly he stopped, struck by an inspira
tion. "Lady," lie said, "you're miserable because you can't
get a date. So am I. So why don't we date each other?"
"Surely you jest!" cried Eustacia, looking with scorn
upon his youthful head and body.
"Oh, I know I'm younger than you are," said Albert
Payson, "bill that doesn't mean we can't find many splen
did things to do together."
"Like what?" asked Kustacia.
"Well," said Albert Payson, "we could get a third and
play some one-o-cat."
"Bah!" said Eustacia, grinding her teeth.
"All right then," said Albert Payson, "we could go
down lo the pond and skip some stones and maybe catch
a few frogs."
"Ugh!" said Eustacia, shuddering her entire length.
"How about some run-sheep-run?" he suggested.
"You are callow, green, and immature," said Eustacia#
"and i will thank you to absent yourself at once!"
Sighing, Albert Payson lit a cigarette and started
away.
"Stay!" cried Eustacia.
"Was that," she asked, "a Philip Morris you just lit?"
"What else?" said Albert Payson.
"Then you are not immature!" she cried, clasping
him to her clavicle. "For to smoke Philip Morris is tin?
very essence of wisdom, incontrovertible proof that you
know rich, natural pleasure from pale, poor substitutes!
Albert Payson, I am yours!"
And today they are married and run one of the biggest
wicker and rallia establishments inJßlue Earth, Minnesota.
