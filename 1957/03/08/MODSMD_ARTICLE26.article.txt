"Hully gee," said Frank, the
, crippled newsboy, as he leaned his
i crutch against the faded clap
board wall of the Daily shack yes
i terday afternoon. "1 wunner if
Mr. Freelen will put the sheet on
the street tomorrow."
And as little Frank mused over
where his next beer was coming
from, a little knot of ex-Daily
! staffers huddled 'round the fire
I hydrant in the cool winter's
I breeze and muttered "scab labor"
as LASSU-ers, old Daily hacks,
j student volunteers and members
j of the idiot fringe paraded in and
out of the back door of the shack
and reams of copy flowed out to i
the men at the linotype machines.!
it looked as if little Frank j
wouldn't need to apply for com-;
pensation as the sun set slowly)
in the west and the little knot of I
has-beens buttoned up their over
coats and took another hitch in
their belts.
The LASSiJ Publishing Com-1
pany hear d the cry of put up or I
shut up and decided to put up and I
put out a paper. As Sam Reis, j
prominent sport on Quad, quip j
j ped this afternoon, the whole
j scene resembled a litllc boys'
! marble game, with the kids who
had picked up and gone home
.sneaking around to see whether
the other kids could get along
without them.
It looked as it tliey could.
