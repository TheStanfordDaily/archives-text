# Indian Ruggers Favored To Trip Cal in Big Game
## Both Teams Are Underfeated; Five Indians on Injury List 
### 
Wily old C'ul Boar will find himself in Hie unique role of under
dog when he ambles down to have it out with Pele Kmetovio's Indian
ruggers at 2 p.m. tomorrow on the rugby field.
The Bears, who are seldom beaten by anyone on the rugby field,
have not been headed by Stanford in the rugby "Big Game" since

1953. Then Dorsey Atkinson had
1o boot a 40-yard penalty kick late |
in the game to pull out a 17-10 |
victory.
Since that game Miles Hudson's !
crew from across the Bay has la-1
ken six straight victories.
This season both the Bears and I
the Indians have gone undefeated. I
Cal, however, was held to a score-1
less tie last weekend by the Uni-I
versity of British Columbia-—a I
team they had beaten 8-0 two I
days earlier.
The Indians' role as slight
favorites stems from com para- j
tive scores. Stanford clobbered
the Olympic Club, JifJ-0 in the
San Franciscans' initial game
of the season. Cal took a 12-3
victory over the club two weeks i
later. Last week Kmetovic's In
dians handled Hie VViiiged-0 for
another easy victory (27-11) de
spite (lie loss of key players l'or
the game.
Injuries have eliminated five I
first opening game starters Ted
Tanner, Bob Long,, Gordy Rob
erts, Gordy Young and Doug Dick
from tomorrow's game.
So many other Indians have I
been shelved with injuries that
Kmetovie was forced to cancel the
.IV game, scheduled to follow the;
varsity encounter.
Despite these injuries the In
dians have continued to pile up
decisive margins in their games,
scoring S<l points to the opposi
tion's 11. Newcomer Rick McMil
len. heady Jack Taylor and Ed j
A vary and ever-elusive A 1 Napo
leon have taken over where Dick
and Young left off. Scrum half
Dave Scholz will return to action
after two weeks on the sidelines
with a leg injury.
Fullback Al Kirkland, on as
suming Dick's kicking chores last j
week, made three of six conver-1
sions and added a 25-yard penalty :
kick for 9 points.
Ip front, the remaining big

men —Paul Wiggin, Vince Jones
and Dick Hall —and speedy Bol»
IVterson will be facing their
tirst real test of the season. The
Cal scrum is not expected to
wear down under their grinding*
attack quite as readily as the
older semi-pros.
Art Harlow and Ned A vary,
two of the starters in tomorrow's
game? were first-string socer play
ers this season. According to
Coach Kmetoviv, Harlow's drib
bling experience in soccer has
aided his rugby play.
On March 30 the Indians will
play their final home game
against MIT in the Stadium at
2 p.m. There will be a similar ad
mission charge for that game.

Wily old C'ul Boar will find himself in Hie unique role of under
dog when he ambles down to have it out with Pele Kmetovio's Indian
ruggers at 2 p.m. tomorrow on the rugby field.
The Bears, who are seldom beaten by anyone on the rugby field,
have not been headed by Stanford in the rugby "Big Game" since

1953. Then Dorsey Atkinson had
1o boot a 40-yard penalty kick late |
in the game to pull out a 17-10 |
victory.
Since that game Miles Hudson's !
crew from across the Bay has la-1
ken six straight victories.
This season both the Bears and I
the Indians have gone undefeated. I
Cal, however, was held to a score-1
less tie last weekend by the Uni-I
versity of British Columbia-—a I
team they had beaten 8-0 two I
days earlier.
The Indians' role as slight
favorites stems from com para- j
tive scores. Stanford clobbered
the Olympic Club, JifJ-0 in the
San Franciscans' initial game
of the season. Cal took a 12-3
victory over the club two weeks i
later. Last week Kmetovic's In
dians handled Hie VViiiged-0 for
another easy victory (27-11) de
spite (lie loss of key players l'or
the game.
Injuries have eliminated five I
first opening game starters Ted
Tanner, Bob Long,, Gordy Rob
erts, Gordy Young and Doug Dick
from tomorrow's game.
So many other Indians have I
been shelved with injuries that
Kmetovie was forced to cancel the
.IV game, scheduled to follow the;
varsity encounter.
Despite these injuries the In
dians have continued to pile up
decisive margins in their games,
scoring S<l points to the opposi
tion's 11. Newcomer Rick McMil
len. heady Jack Taylor and Ed j
A vary and ever-elusive A 1 Napo
leon have taken over where Dick
and Young left off. Scrum half
Dave Scholz will return to action
after two weeks on the sidelines
with a leg injury.
Fullback Al Kirkland, on as
suming Dick's kicking chores last j
week, made three of six conver-1
sions and added a 25-yard penalty :
kick for 9 points.
Ip front, the remaining big

men —Paul Wiggin, Vince Jones
and Dick Hall —and speedy Bol»
IVterson will be facing their
tirst real test of the season. The
Cal scrum is not expected to
wear down under their grinding*
attack quite as readily as the
older semi-pros.
Art Harlow and Ned A vary,
two of the starters in tomorrow's
game? were first-string socer play
ers this season. According to
Coach Kmetoviv, Harlow's drib
bling experience in soccer has
aided his rugby play.
