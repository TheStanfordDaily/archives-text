## 
### 
Striking in the first stanza, the San ,!ose State Spartans scored a 1
lone tally, which proved to be enough to top Stanford's varsity. Be
hind the handcuff pitching of ace Tuck Halsey, San Jose held the
hit-shy Indians runless while the Spartans tallied two more unneces
sary insurance runs in the second inning.

Centerfielder Boh Fletcher
proved to he one of the bright
est lights in the Indian season
opener. Fletcher smacked three
consecutive singles off Halsey
in the fourth, sixth and eighth
innings. Indian hope came in
the sixth inning after one of
Fletcher's singles when Bob
IKvight reached first on an er
.for With runners on first and
second, however, a double play
quickly ended . Ilie potential
rally.
Fireman Wall Payne proved t<>
lie tin? other Indian bright light
by allowing only one hit and
striking out seven in his three-in
ning relief stints,
llalsey effectively stilled the
Stanford batsmen and walked
only one man. Last year llal
sey also turned in. a sterling
performance in beating the In
dians 1 .
A crowd of about 200 spectators
was on hand. This afternoon Stan
ford will probably send Ed Ver
durmcn against Pepperdine o I
Los Angeles in a game at Sunken
1 diamond. (lame time is .'1:1 f>.
