"In tomorrow's memorial exer
cises will be expressed, in the
words of the various great speak
ers but far more strongly in the
silent presence of the whole as
sembled student body, that deep
feeling of reverence and gratitude
for the man whose beneficence
made possible the existence of
the University."
So stated an editorial in the
Daily Palo Alto of March 8, 1894,
the day before the first Founders'
Day in University history was
held in old Encina Gymnasium.
Since that Friday morning in
1894, Founders' Day has been cel
ebrated either on the birthday of
Leland Stanford or on the Sun
day nearest to it. Only the 1905
observance was cancelled because
of Mrs. Stanford's death. Senator
Stanford had died in 1893.
70 Years Later
The 1894 service, held exactly
70 years after the birth of Senator
Stanford, had a former U.S. Pres
ident as one of the speakers.
"From all directions groups of
students turned their faces to
ward the scene of the morning's
exercises, and sometime before 10
o'clock Encina Gymnasium was
filled to its utmost seating ca
pacity," the Daily noted. N
"About 1050 were present, fully
a third of whom were women," it
added.
A platform was erected at one
end of the gym, which stood at
the northwest corner of Galvez
and Escondido, and behind the
temporary stage was a life-size
portrait of Leland Jr. and a small
er one of the senator. Three
Afnerican flags were draped over
head.
Mrs. Stanford Applauded
Mrs. Stanford, who received
prolonged applause when she en
tered, sat in the front section with
the faculty.
Speakers were ex • President
Benjamin Harrison, who had ar
rived the previous Monday to be
gin a series of lectures on consti
tutional law, and Horace Davis,
member of the Stanford Board of
Trustees and former University
of California president.
SU President David Starr Jor
dan served as master of ceremo
nies, and music was provided by
the glee club, a string quartet
and a vocal soloist.
A third speaker, Bishop Joseph
Ke a n e of Catholic University,
Washington. D.C., was unable to
attend at the last minute, so Pro
fessor Augustus Murray read ex
tracts from speeches recently de
livered in Congress at memorial
exercises in honor of Stanford.
Harrison Speech
Harrison in his speech empha
sized how Stanford, unlike many
of his time, made use of his
wealth to help others.
Among the items mentioned by
Murray was an occasion on which
Stanford, after being paid $12,500
for a colt, promptly sent checks
for $6,250 to two homes for friend
less children.
At the top of the program was
printed an idea which had occur
red to Stanford in 1884 just after
losing his only son: "The children
of California shall be my chil
dren."
In founding the University he
had "adopted" many children of
California, and Dr. Jordan at that
first Founders' Day
noted. "We recognize now that
the children of California are in
deed his children "
"In tomorrow's memorial exer
cises will be expressed, in the

livered in Congress at memorial
exercises in honor of Stanford.
Harrison Speech
Harrison in his speech empha
sized how Stanford, unlike many
of his time, made use of his
wealth to help others.
Among the items mentioned by
Murray was an occasion on which
Stanford, after being paid $12,500
for a colt, promptly sent checks
for $6,250 to two homes for friend
less children.
At the top of the program was
printed an idea which had occur
red to Stanford in 1884 just after
losing his only son: "The children
of California shall be my chil
dren."
In founding the University he
had "adopted" many children of
California, and Dr. Jordan at that
first Founders' Day
noted. "We recognize now that
the children of California are in
deed his children "
"In tomorrow's memorial exer
cises will be expressed, in the
words of the various great speak
ers but far more strongly in the
silent presence of the whole as
sembled student body, that deep
feeling of reverence and gratitude
for the man whose beneficence
made possible the existence of
the University."
So stated an editorial in the
Daily Palo Alto of March 8, 1894,
the day before the first Founders'
Day in University history was
held in old Encina Gymnasium.
Since that Friday morning in
1894, Founders' Day has been cel
ebrated either on the birthday of
Leland Stanford or on the Sun
day nearest to it. Only the 1905
observance was cancelled because
of Mrs. Stanford's death. Senator
Stanford had died in 1893.

70 years after the birth of Senator
Stanford, had a former U.S. Pres
ident as one of the speakers.
"From all directions groups of
students turned their faces to
ward the scene of the morning's
exercises, and sometime before 10
o'clock Encina Gymnasium was
filled to its utmost seating ca
pacity," the Daily noted. N
"About 1050 were present, fully
a third of whom were women," it
added.
A platform was erected at one
end of the gym, which stood at
the northwest corner of Galvez
and Escondido, and behind the
temporary stage was a life-size
portrait of Leland Jr. and a small
er one of the senator. Three
Afnerican flags were draped over
head.
