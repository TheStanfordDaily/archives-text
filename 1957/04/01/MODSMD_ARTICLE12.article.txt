### 
TEHRAN, Iran. March 31 —
(UP i—-Iranian camel patrols to
day found the partially disrobed
hody of pretty American house
wife Mrs. Anita Carroll torn with
knife and bullet wounds and
dumped in a desolate mountain ra
vine by her bandit kidnapers.
Apparently the 35-year-old wom
an from Issaquah. Wash., had
been dead all the while thousands
of Iranian gendarmerie (federal
police) and trackers had been
searching for her in the wilder
ness of Baluchistan. The body
was decomposed.
Initial examination showed she
had been stabbed and then shot
by the semibarbarous bandits who
killed her husband and another
American and two Iranians in an
ambush near Iranshahr last Sun
day and then fled toward the Pak
istan border with her as a captive.
