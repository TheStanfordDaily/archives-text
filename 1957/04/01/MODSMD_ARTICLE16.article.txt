ARTICLE 111, SECTION" 4,
Sub-section D, Paragraph 11

Disapproval by Legislature an
other election shall be held

Editor remaining in office until
the new Editor has been elected
and approved.
Legislature also gave its ap
proval to the return of the regu
lar Daily staff by a vote of 10
to 3.
Resignations
In other action the same night
Legislature heard the reading of
a letter of resignation turned in
by Bruce Hinchcliffe, Stern repre
sentative. Freelen did n»t an
nounce the appointment of a suc
cessor.
Steve Tallent also announced
his resignation as parliamenta
rian for Legislature. He recom
mended that a member of the
faculty be appointed to that posi
tion. When asked if this meant
the termination of his position as
administrative assistant a <;o, Tal
lent said it did not.
Freshman Bob Guild was given
the go-ahead by Legislature to
run for the office of Off- \ampus
Men's representative to legisla
ture. According to Tallen . it was
a matter for Legislature o inter
pret whether under the ASSU
Constitution a freshman who
gives assurances that he will be
living off campus in his n *xt year
may be allowed to run for office.
He was cleared by a 9 ti 6 vote.
