# "Who—Me?"
## Senate Investigation Aids Labor 
### 
The Senate labor rackets committee, headed
by Senator John MeClellan of Arkansas, has
uncovered in one union the nemesis that con*
tiuually threatens all labor groups—control by
or tie-ins with organized crime.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters
has a membership >{ nearly one and one-lialf
million. But T, ot. until the disclosures by the
Senate committt t did the average member
know about the corruption that exists in the
upper echelons of his union. And even though
some knew, few cared as long as they had a job
or had money in their pockets.
The encouraging aspect of these investiga
tions into the misuse of labor union funds is
that organized labor is completely behind the
investigation. But there is a good reason
for this.
These investigations have been conducted on
a high level with a clearly recognized goal of
helping unions in a constructive way. In other
words, the aim has not been io make unions
per se appear in unfavorable public light. The
skillful maneuvering by committee counsel
Robert Kennedy has focused the nation's
disgust against the unscrupulous leaders and
tlieir methods not against the principles of
unionism.
It is a tribute to the MeClellan committee
that it is accomplishing its objective without
'sorting to indiscriminate attacks which some

congressional committees have been known
to do.
But not only does the Senate labor rackets
committee deserve a bouquet; the ruling hier
archy of labor, the Executive Council of the
A PI,-CIO, also deserves one. It is fully ap
parent now that the recent merger of the two
labor groups has served to strengthen not only
the principles of unionism, but also labor's
determination to rid itself of undesirable
elements.
This struggle within the AFL-CIO is a diffi
cult one. It is not easy for a group to purge
itself when operating under democratic proc
esses. The AFI.-CIO Executive Council would
not have been able to raise enough support to
oust Teamster president Dave Beck as an AFL
CIO officer without the Senate hearing results.
11, as a result of these hearings, such an
upheavel is created in the Teamsters union
that it becomes reorganized with far more safe
guards lor the membership, then organized
labor will have proved its responsibility to the
membership. And, in the final analysis, this
is its paramount responsibility.
Let Congress and labor continue to work
together to rid the labor movement of un
desirable elements and abuses to the responsi
bilities ol the officials. Our country ami our
economy demand a strong labor force. May
the joint efforts of Congress and the AFL-CIO
make that a democratically-run force also.

parent now that the recent merger of the two
labor groups has served to strengthen not only
the principles of unionism, but also labor's
determination to rid itself of undesirable
elements.
This struggle within the AFL-CIO is a diffi
cult one. It is not easy for a group to purge
itself when operating under democratic proc
esses. The AFI.-CIO Executive Council would
not have been able to raise enough support to
oust Teamster president Dave Beck as an AFL
CIO officer without the Senate hearing results.
11, as a result of these hearings, such an
upheavel is created in the Teamsters union
that it becomes reorganized with far more safe
guards lor the membership, then organized
labor will have proved its responsibility to the
membership. And, in the final analysis, this
is its paramount responsibility.
Let Congress and labor continue to work
together to rid the labor movement of un
desirable elements and abuses to the responsi
bilities ol the officials. Our country ami our
economy demand a strong labor force. May
the joint efforts of Congress and the AFL-CIO
make that a democratically-run force also.

The Senate labor rackets committee, headed
by Senator John MeClellan of Arkansas, has
uncovered in one union the nemesis that con*
tiuually threatens all labor groups—control by
or tie-ins with organized crime.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters
has a membership >{ nearly one and one-lialf
million. But T, ot. until the disclosures by the
Senate committt t did the average member
know about the corruption that exists in the
upper echelons of his union. And even though
some knew, few cared as long as they had a job
or had money in their pockets.
The encouraging aspect of these investiga
tions into the misuse of labor union funds is
that organized labor is completely behind the
investigation. But there is a good reason
for this.
These investigations have been conducted on
a high level with a clearly recognized goal of
helping unions in a constructive way. In other
words, the aim has not been io make unions
per se appear in unfavorable public light. The
skillful maneuvering by committee counsel
Robert Kennedy has focused the nation's
disgust against the unscrupulous leaders and
tlieir methods not against the principles of
unionism.
It is a tribute to the MeClellan committee
that it is accomplishing its objective without
'sorting to indiscriminate attacks which some

congressional committees have been known
to do.
But not only does the Senate labor rackets
committee deserve a bouquet; the ruling hier
archy of labor, the Executive Council of the
A PI,-CIO, also deserves one. It is fully ap
parent now that the recent merger of the two
labor groups has served to strengthen not only
the principles of unionism, but also labor's
