# Why We're Back
## 
### 
The D ui .Y is being published by the regular
staff today.
I egislature lias not rescinded it* legislation,
a>* we wished, but the issue will now be placed
bef ore the student body in the primary election
April 11 and 12.
During the week end before Dead Week
petitions were circulated that the hv-law call
ing for Legislature's approval of the Daily
editor be put to the student body in a ref
erendum vote.
ihive per cent of the student body, or a little
over 400, signatures were needed. Almost 900
were procured. Now that it is up to the general
student body, and out of Legislature's hands,
we are returning to publish The Daily and
present the issue to our readers.
We will o .ve all sides a chance to speak and
will print as many to the editor" as
possible on the subject.
earnestly hope the student body will
support our beliefs, and repeal the legislation.
We are opposed to the by-law because we be
lieve that the power to approve constitutes the
power to control. And control in this form is
particularly objectionable.
Under the old arrangement Legislature could
approve only the election process regarding

the staff's selection of the Daily editor. Under
the new law Legislature, by a simple majority,
could disapprove the editor, and the staff would
be forced to select another editor from a list
of less qualified candidates.
We don t believe an associate editor would
feel free to criticize Legislature or other lead
ing campus organizations in editorials if he
knew he would have to he approved by Legis
lature.
''This will keep the editor on bis toes â€” it will
show him where his responsibility lies," said
the originator of the proposal. With this atti
tude the legislation would not be a mere rubber
stamp, as many of its backers claim; it would
mean a dangerous form of control.
We believe The Daily has shown its good
faith by supporting the Publications Board
amendment to bring complaints regard iug Tl le
Daily before that hoard.
We object to the way in which Legislature
passed the by-law, ignoring our pleas of co
operation without legislation, and laughing at
petitions signed by 1200 members of the stu
dent body.
We believe we can have a responsible and
enlightened college preps without legislative
shackles on it.
