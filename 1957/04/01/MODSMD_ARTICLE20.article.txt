# THIS WEEK ON QUAD
## Beer, Beach and Scholarly Pursuits 
### Dick Frey 
Now that the silly season is over and sanity
has heen restored, it's time to greet spring quar
ter, that gay, mad lime of beer and beach. Ah,
but there are also the more scholarly pursuits
and activities as this week's calendar shows.
Today is the day when lines of people stretch
from one end of Quad to the other and then some.
Evei-so-friendly tellers in the Pavilion will cele
brate the collecting of the green. That's right, it's
dear old Registration Day.
The sophomore class will help to soothe Reg
Day frustrations by sponsoring tonight's
Dance at the Pavilion. Music will be provided by
Bill Reynolds.

And where are the deep, profound, scholarly ac
tivities promised? Thursday the intellectual
crew awakens with a profound 4 p.m. Mathemat
ics Colloquium in Room 65. Dr. Hans Lewy of
Cal will lecture on "An Example of a Smooth
Lineal- Differential Equation Without a Solu
tion." Pretty smooth, all right, if there's no
solution. But why bother oneself if there is no

solution? Who cares? Oh, well, it's a real schol
arly title for a lecture, anyway.
Hot competition will tie furnished by the 4 p.m.
Physics Department Colloquium. Dr. Sidney D.
Drell will discuss "On Parity" in Room .'172. Mys
teriously brief lecture title, isn't it?

More culture on Friday. "Oeometrieal Optics
and Its Relation to Various Fields of Mathemat
ics and Physics" is the 3:15 Mathematics Depart
ment Colloquium topic in Room KM at Sequoia.
Dr. Max Herzberger will be the speaker. Sounds
wi i-i-i-i Id!

Saturday afternoon another round of baseball
will commence on the Sunken Diamond's green
turf. Santa Clara is the opponent and game time
is 2:30.
The weekend should also be a delightful time
to amble over to the Museum to see some of the
astounding exhibits offered for the benefit of
pop-eyed tourists. Currently astonishing Museum
visitors is the collection of Chinese snuff bottles.
The collection of 300 bottles is from the 17th to
the 19th centuries. Many are carved from semi
precious stones. There are a number of glass
bottles which arc painted on the inside and if you
look real close you can even see little footprints
on the bottom. The display is in the main lobby
of the Museum and will remain until May.
