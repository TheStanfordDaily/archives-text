Stanford's track team over
whelmingly dominated two trlan-
I gulal' spring vacation track meets
I and, in the words of Coach Pay-
I ton Jordan, is improving with ev
ery outing. '
Jordan, in his first year as In
: dian track boss after a fabulously
: successful career at Occidental
i College, seems to be working mir
' acles with the Big Red thinelads,
'as one Stanford man after anoth
er has turned in the best effort
j of his career. Phil Fehlen set a
t new school high jump mark of
0 8 1 -; March 23.
In a meet Saturday, the Cards
amassed SI * •* points, as against
, San Jose's CO and Santa Clara
Youth Center's 14U. Discus
thrower Fred Peters, Tiurdler
Chuck Cobb and broad jumper
Frank Herrmann all achieved all
time bests for themselves.
Won't Go in Hooks
Peters "flipped" the platter 170
ft. 7 in., the second greatest discus
feat ever made at Stanford. Cobb
ran the best 220 low hurdles time
in Farm history—23.l. But the
mark won't go down in (he record
books since the junior stick man
was running behind a helpful
wind.
Another best • of • career mark
was turned in in the broad jump
: as Frank Herrmann leaped 21 ft.
5 in. This bettered even the leap
I Herrmann achieved in winning
the Pacific Coast Conf e r en c e

| championship two years ago
j (However, Rafer Johnson of 11C
! LA has done 25-5%.)
Improvement was also shown
in the middle distance events. Bob
j Hyde clicked off a 49.1 quarter
! mile and in the 880, Don Chesa
| rek, Joe Woolletts and Don Rich
j ard.son finished 1-2-3.
Chesa rek nipped Woolletts by a
l()th of a second—l:ss.2 to 1:55.3
and Richardson was not far
back at 1:56 flat.

j danmen slaughtered the powerful

; on his first two leaps, then edged
over the bar on his third try as
I Stadium spectators howled.
