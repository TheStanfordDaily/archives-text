# 1000 CIRCULATION
## Hispanic Seminar's Report Is Valuable in Latin Affairs Field 
### David Hamilton 
The Hispanic American Report. a monthly reporl of current events
in Latin America. Spain and Portugal, has achieved a world wide
reputation as a most responsible publication in this field. In addition
to many readers in the United States, Great Britain and Canada, its
1000 circulation extends to Sweden, Spain, Iraq, India, Japan, Aus-

tralia and many other places.
This uni q u e magazine- the
only one on campus that appears
monthly, 12 issues a year - is the
work of the Hispanic World Af
fairs Seminar. The 23 or 1 so stu
dents who make up this group
are constantly clipping articles
from major newspapers, maga
zines and other sourecs and filing
them in pigeonholes bv countries.
There is a special room in the
main library, room 333. where all
this information is collected.
Although this room is not open
io the public, special arrange
ments can be made to visit it for
those interested. This material
will be invaluable for writing his
tory from 1919 on.
( orrespondence
In addition to the clippings, the
Report receives information from
official and private correspond
ents in the countries themselves,
graduates of Stanford in South
America and news commentators.
The advisory board of the Re
port consists of men from many
different departments political
science, biology, mineral science
but all these men must have lived
in Latin America at some time.
The magazine is used as a text
in history seminars all over the
world. Even an editor in Rio do
Janeiro once wrote a complimen
tary editorial about it.
Closely related to the Report,
whose subscription costs $1 a
year, is the Hispanic American
Studies Department. This depart
ment. which offers M.A.. B.A. and
Ph.D. degrees, is organ i /. e d
through the Humanities Depart
ment. Most oi its graduates go
into business, government work,
newspaper work, government cul
tural agencies, or teaching.
Assistant Editor
One of the assistant editors of
the Report is Luis Enrique Oso
rio. Soiior Osorio, currently lec
turing at Stanford, arrived here
in a Jeep just before winter quar -
ter began. He came to the United
Slates from Colombia with his
wife and four children, partly for
political reasons. He is the author
of several plays.
Professor Milton noted there is
a very live, intellectual atmos
phere among people working on
lire Report. He said it is the heart
of the Hispanic American pro
gram on campus.
