# Mexico Will Offer Summer Lecture Series
## Program Offered in Co-operation With SU; Tours Also Scheduled 
### 
In older to bring to life the
study of Latin America, a sum
mer session open to Stanford stu
dents will be held in Mexico City
from July 1 to Aug. 9 under tbo
direction of Ronald Hilton, direc
tor of Hispanic American Studies.
The lectures will be given at Mex
ico City College, overlooking the
capital of Mexico.
Mexico Tours
The program will not tie a sum
mer school in the usual sense of
Ihe word, for classes will alter
nate with visits to Mexican insti
tutions to study the country's po
litical, social, economic and cul
tural organization first-hand.
For example, a lecture on the
organization of the Mexican Con
gress will be followed by a trip to
see the Congress in action. The
head of the committee which is
working out the organization of
these excursions is William Tay
lor. president of General Electric
of Mexico. Since he has lived in
Mexico for many years, "he prob
ably knows the country better
than any other American," said
I lilton.
First-lland Learning
The program will provide the
means for students who are work
ing on the Hispanic American Re
port to learn about Latin America
firsthand. There are. of course,
differences between the republics
of South America, but they have
enough in common, when con
trasted with the United States, to
make the study of Mexico very
useful for someone who is pri
marily interested in, say, Argen
tina, Hilton said.
Professor Hilton hopes that the
program will attract majors in
engineering, law and education as
well as those who are mainly in
terested in Hispanic American
Studies. There will be two pro
grams one in Spanish for those
who can speak the language mod
erately well and one in English
for those who do not speak
Spanish.
Offers' Nine Units
The program is accredited, and
people interested in this aspect of
the program can gel up to nine
units for the five weeks. Natural
ly. people taking il for credit will
be required to participate regu
larly in the activities.
Tuition is $90 and room and
hoard will also be about $90; total
expenses will be about $200. This
figure for room and board is for
accommodations with Spanish
speaking families. Students are
free to live in a luxury hotel. Ilil
ton said, but the rates will tie
somewhat higher. Transportation
by plane is $120 round trip from
Tijuana to Mexico '"jiy,

This summer session, organized
in cooperation with the Foreign
Policy Association and the Associ
ation of International Relations

the government and the olher or
ganizations of a Latin American
country that make it tick, Hilton
said.
