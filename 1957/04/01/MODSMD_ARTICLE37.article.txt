"Wo teach what is best lor each
grade."
That was the response to ques
tions ahoul the problems of plan
ning a curriculum for a non-de
nominational Sunday school, such
as the one which is conducted by
Memorial Church,
Dr. It. M. Minto, University
chaplain, and Charles Meredith,
superintendent of the church
school, explained that the course
of study is selected from mate
rials offered by many denomina
tions. They added that most
churches do not teach strict doc
trinal material in the lower
grades anyway.
Memorial Church Sunday
school began 10 years ago with a
small group of the children of fac
ulty members and graduate stu
dents, meeting in the church ves
try. In the past decade enroll
ment has increased to more than

100, and they now meet in the
School ot Education, which co
operates in conducting the school.
Meredith is a graduate student
in the School of Education and
his appointment as director of
the church school is a joint deci
sion by the School oI Education
and Memorial Church. In co-op
eration with the School of Educa
tion the members ol the teaching
staff may receive credit for their
work by enrolling in Education
course 111 or 198.
The superintendent said that
most of the 10 sophomore and
freshman students who now com
pose the staff are teaching be
cause they enjoy the work. Eight
of them began teaching fall quar
ter, at which time credit was not
offered.
Average attendance at the
school is 80 youngsters, ranging
from kindergarten to junior high
school age. Study in tin 1 various

age groups varies, hut spring em
phasis in all groups will be upon
mission fields. Meredith said the
different classes are planning
projects in connection with the
study of home and national mis
sions. As one of these projects,
he said the fourth grade hoys and
girls will be raising funds to send
Bibles to foreign missions.
Meredith meets with his teach
ers weekly to discuss teaching
methods and problems, and to in
crease the scriptural background
necessary for the lessons.
He said that interest in the
school is high as shown on recent
rainy Sundays when the attend
ance has maintained its regular
level.
