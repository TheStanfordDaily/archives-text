# Sterling Criticizes Emphasis On Students' Social Adjustment
## Tells Women Deans' and Counselors' Meeting 'Education's Main Goal Is to Train the Mind' 
### 
President Wallace Sterling Saturday eritieized elementary schools
awl universities for emphasizing social adjustment of students more
than academic training.
Speaking before a convention of the National Association of
Women Deans and Counselors in the Fairmont Hotel. San Francisco.

Sterling said. "Training the mind
is the central purpose of educa
tion."
"1 am not one to minimize the
value of social adjustment or the
extra-curricular activities of col
leges." Sterling said, "but I don't
champion or admire the tinkering
with standards of academic per
formance done by universities for
the reeruiting and fielding of a
winning football team."
He told the convention that uni
versities eannot train the minds
of their students properly "by as
suming the primary purpose of
education is social adjustment or
by assuming a varsity letter is
the equivalent of a sound aca
demic grade."
In early school grades emphasis
placed on social adjustment has
led to the theory that "a child can
be told he is failing only at the
risk of damaging his psyche," he
added.
