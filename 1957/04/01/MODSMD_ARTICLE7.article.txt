# Senator Hints Prosecution of Teamster Boss
## Labor's Mitchell Says Administration Favors More Union Legislation 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 31 —
HIP) Chairman John L. McClel
lan (D-Ark.) of the Senate labor
rackets commit tee today raised
the possibility of federal or state
criminal prosecutions of teamster
boss Dave Beck.
Sen. Irving M. Ives (R-N.Y.),
committee vice-chairman and the
ranking Republican, also said that
there is "plenty of room" to war
rant a prosecution of Beck and
labor consultant Nathan W. Shef
ferman on charges of violating
the Taft-Hartley law.
McClellan revealed that the
committee has more evidence
against Beck than was presented
in last week's hectic two-day hear
ing in which Beck refused to an
swer corruption charges on the
grounds of possible self-incrimi
nation.
McClellan said it is "presently
anticipated" that Beck will be re
called for further questioning be
fore the committee concludes its
investigation.
Federal Laws Involved
He was asked on the NBC telo
vision program "Meet the Press"
if the committee had enough evi
dence to warrant a criminal prose
cution of Beck on McClellan's
charge last week that Beck's ac
tivities amounted to "nothing less
than theft."
McClellan replied that the fi
nancial reports of the Teamsters
union do not reflect the $325,000
in loans allegedly given to Beck.
Either the reports are "fraudu
lent," he said, or else Beck took
the money "without authority or
consent."
McClellan agreed with question
ers that some federal laws may
be involved in Beck's activities.
He mentioned the income tax
laws, contempt of Congress and
"using the mails to defraud."
lISegHl Collusion
He emphasized that he has not
yet made up his mind whether
Beck could be prosecuted for con
tempt of Congress on grounds lie
used the Fifth Amendment im
properly at times during his ap
pearance on the witness stand.
Both McClellan and Ives prom
ised that the committee will pre
sent evidence to show illegal col
lusion between management and
corrupt union leaders.
Labor Secretary James Mitchell
said oti the ABC television pro
gram "Press Conference" that
Beck's activities were "reprehen
sible." He said the Administra
tion favors legislation to tighten
up the laws requiring labor un
ions to file financial reports.
Something to Hide
McClellan termed Beck's ap
pearance before the committee as
"the most despicable performance
I have ever witnessed." He said
a union leader's use of the Fifth
Amendment "arouses very deep
suspicions" about his activities.
Mitchell agreed that Beck's ref
uge behind the amendment indi
cated to him that Beck, "in ef
fect. is admitting he has some
thing to hide."
Mitchell said Administration
supported proposals for requiring
a closer supervision of union pen
sion and welfare funds would help
prevent abuses such as has been
brought out in the Teamsters
case.
Accusers Won't <fudg'"
McClellan said he hoped to see
Congress enact legislation to pro
tect the rank-and-file union mem
bers and the public, to force all
unions to hold democratic elec
tions and to protect union funds
against diversion by union lead
ers.
Meanwhile, in Seattle, Beck
said, "I certainly will not allow
those that accuse me to be the
ones that shall judge me."
Beck refused to flatly identify
his fellow labor leaders as the
target of his statement, but he
left little doubt as to his meaning.
"I am not going beyond my
statement at this time," he said.
"I will not be tried by people who
cannot suspend their judgment
until all the evidence is in."
