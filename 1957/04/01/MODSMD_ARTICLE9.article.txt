# EARTHQUAKE CASUALTY
## Chemistry Building Damaged; Class Schedules Are Changed 
### 
No classes will be held in the Chemistry Building this week. Uni
versity officials announced yesterday. The strong earthquake of
March 22 seriously damaged the building, making it unsafe to enter.
It will be closed for repairs until Monday, April 8, they said.
A. H. Binder ol the Buildings and Land Department estimated the

damage at about $12,000. Deep
cracks in the building's founda
tion were discovered March 23,
the day after the earthquake, as
well as broken windows and
cracks in the walls.
No one in the building was in
jured when the temblor struck,
though Lawrence R. Davies, 58,
caretaker, was shaken up when
he fell against the wall in room
No. 118.
"I was standing on a chair
reaching to change a hght when
all of a sudden the whole room
shook. 1 lost my balance," he
said.
Class Changes
All classes scheduled lo bp held
in the Chemistry Building during
spring quarter will bp held in
other buildings or cancelled this
week only, according to George S.
Parques, executive head of the
Chemistry Department.
Lecture classes will meet as fol
lows:
Chemistry 3 and 4, General
Chemistry, room 200R;
Chemistry LI4, Quantitative An
alysis, room pe4B;
Chemistry 125, Organic Chem
istry, room e76.
All other lecture classes sched
uled in the Chemistry Building
will be cancelled this week and
will commence Monday, April 8,
on regular schedule.
Lab Schedule
Chemistry laboratories will
meet as follows:
Chemistry 3, all labs, room IA,
same times;
Chemistry 115, all labs, room
e74, same times;
Chemistry 122, room 316, same
time;
Chemistry 121, room e5B, same
time.
All other chemistry laboratories
will be cancelled this week and
will commence on regular sched
ule Monday, April 8.
Reliable sources say it is often
a good practice to read every news
story completely. This is especial

cause the last line is a reminder
to all Chem students that today
is April Fool's Day.
