You know it ... we know H ... so let's b$ {rank
about it. « /
The demand for engineers—experienced or graduate
—far exceeds the supply/And, from now on in, you
are going to be sought after more than a triple threat
halfback for next year's varsity.
You will be promised many thing* (including the
moon with a fence/around it), and for a young man
just getting started these things are pretty bard
to resist. /
So, again, lei's be frank. We at Farnsworth won't
promise you/the moon. (Although we are working
on some ideas that may eventually get you there
and back.) We are an old, young organization. Old,
in the sense of being pioneers in the field of elec
tronics./fOur technical director, Dr. Philo Farnsworth
invented electronic television.) Young, by being the
newest division of the world-wide International Tele
phone and Telegraph Corporation, devoting our ef
forts exclusively to research, development and pro
duction of military and industrial electronics, and
/atomic energy.
/ All of which mokes Farnsworth big enough for tta
/ bility and technical perspective, yet small enough
/ for mobility, flexibility and recognition of the in
/ dividual. Here you will be associated with ond
/ encouraged by a team of eminent scientists and
/ engineers with many "firsts" to their credit in the
/ field of electronics. Here you will be heard ... «ot
/ just one of the herd.
/ We earnestly invite you to hear the whole fascinating
/ Farnsworth story. We're pretty certain it will make
ij/ the decision for yow future easier.
