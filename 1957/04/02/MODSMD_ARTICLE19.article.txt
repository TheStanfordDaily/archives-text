# Toward Better Government

Rkvxner vmj W ilbur freshmen will get a
rhai.ee to meet candidates for ASSU president
and vice-president and head yell leader tonight
a. well as candidates for the sophomore class
offices.
V* e hope that ihe residents of these dormi
tories and all the other living groups on campus
will avail themselves of the opportunity to
meet ihe candidates and to hear and evaluate
their platforms this week.
'Ihe turnout of only 55 candidates in last
spring's election was extremely apathetic. Hut
the student body as a whole did little to interest
itself in the candidates that were running. Sixty
was the most that attended the talks at one
time. At two of the dormitories there wen
more candidates than audience.
After such a turnout both in the candidate
and audience categories, we can't see how a
student really has much of a right to complain
about the quality of this year's student govern
ment. This year there are 92 candidates for
ASSU, class and \\ RA offices. We hope the
audiences will increase accordingly.
!l an inq 'overnent in student government is

wished, we urge students not only to attend the ;
candidate's speeches in their dormitories, hut
to listen carefully to what they have to say. Be j
sure they have a constructive program, one
which includes ideas to improve the present j
governmental setup and ideas for new areas of:
student government exploration.
Ask them questions after the meetings. See
if they are really interested in a student gov
ernment which will represent the interests of
the students and at the same time maintain an
enlightened and constructive atmosphere.
\\ e helieve that one of the failures of student
government this year, that of not representing â€¢
its constituents, has been due to the lack of j
interest by the constituents iu what their repre
sentatives are doing. Here is a chance for the 1
potential constituents to pick the kind of repre- !
sentation they want.
If turnouts to hear the candidates are as
poor as last year, then we can say with a great
deal of truth the student body would have no !
right to expect the intelligent kind of student I
government it could have at a campus the !
caliber of Stanford.
