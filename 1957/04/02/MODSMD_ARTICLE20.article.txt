# ON OTHER CAMPUSESâ€”By Dave Canfield
## Coast College Papers Back Daily Action 
### 
When the Daily staff made its protest walk
out on March (>, it may not have fired "the shot
heard round the world" as "letterto-the-editor"
writer Mark Hammer suggested.
But the staff certainly fired a shot heard
throughout Pacific Coast college newspaper of
fices.
I 'liior Jim Lemert of the Daily Californian
continued his opposition to The Daily's stand.
But other college iitorial writers backed the
:' iff's efforts to fight Legislature's attempt to
g<.un the pow<" approve or disapprove each
new editoi'.
In an editorial entitled "Hail Pancho Villa!"
the Uj iversity of San Francisco paper, the San
Francisco Foghorn, issued this biting criticism
of LASSU and glowing pat-on the hack to The
Daily;
' The Stanford Legislature has never shown us
much. They fumbled around at the beginning of
the year with the beer-at-nineteen issue, but
failed to take a positive stand on their own
problem child. Now wc find they are attempting
to turn The Stanford Daily into a trade journal
publish what they wish and have lixed up a
dandy piece of legislation to control it."
Oi the Daily Californian's critique of The
Daily'? stand, the Foghorn said, "The Daily Cali
ba nian, which has an editor selection set up
something like that trying to be shackled onto
the freedom of thj Stanford press, . . . actually
bi<? tsk-tsked The Stanford Daily for its heroic
stand, apparently conscious of the 'need' to de
fend its own system.!'

Writer Dale McKean of flie Washington Staff
College Daily Evergreen had similar views:
' When people sH up principles for themselves
they take pride in following thorn," McKean said.
"They will not roll over and play dead when
someone tries to change them. That is the way
the students on the Stanford Daily staff felt and
they rose as a solid mass in opposition of a
principle which was being tampered with by the
student legislature.
"As I see it they were perfectly right to stand
up for their principle- a principle of a 'free, en
lightened, critical Stanford Daily with no legis
lative shackles on it.' "
Perhaps the most penetrating analysis of The
Daily-Legislature controversy carne from the pen
of Bob' Wohl, writing in the UCLA Daily Bruin.
WhiJe conceding that "the attempts at Stan
ford and UCLA to control the student newspaper
perhaps ... is a good thing," Wohl classified
LASSIJ's action as an illustration of how the
present generation is a "silent generation."
"When student legislatures and student bodies
stait complaining that they want a newspaper'
that represents the whole student body and not
just a minority," Wohl said, "what they are
really saying is that ihey want a silent paper, a
paper that represents everybody by representing i
nobody.
"This is what happened at Stanford; this is'
what happened at UCLA; and this is something!
that is happening in one form or another!
throughout the country," Wohl said.
