Mighty oaks . . .
A case iii point is tMe Leland
Stanford Junior Museum. As fin
ished in 1906, the museum hart
the greatest floor space 290,000
square feci -of any private mu
seum in the world. Hut tfie seed
of this edifice is a small wooden
case, ahout two feet wide and
three feet high.
Within this case are several
bird nests, some eggs, rocks arid
shells.
The origin of this case lies In
the active mind of a small boy
who died in Europe at the age of
k;.
Leland Stanford Jr. began col
lecting interesting objects around
home while very young; but later,
when he and his mother, Jane La
throp Stanford, began their ex
tensive travels in Europe, he con
ceived the idea of acquiring some
thing from each city visited.
Nob Ilill Kesiileiice
In the Stanford's Nob Ilill resi
dence two entire rooms were en
larged and set aside for Iceland's
collect ions.
Leland himself had the idea of
someday building his own mu
seum, but it was not until after
his death in 188-1 thai his grief
stricken parents projected their
plans for a I niversi'ty in his mern
ory.
Mrs. Stanford carried out the
museum idea and made il her
hobby, arranging Leland's collec
tions in their original setting and
preserving the main exhibit case
as it was arranged by Leland him
self.
For an i 1-year old boy Leland
showed a keen appreciation for
objects of artistic and historic
value.
Exceptional (Quality
President Sterling commented
that the quality of the collections
was exceptional. Dr. David Starr
Jordan, first president of Stan
ford University, mentioned in his
writings, "While most boys of his
age and social position were
spending their pocket money on
trivial even if innocent amuse
merits, his chief joy was to pick
up treasures for his projected
museum."
Begun in 1891 and completed in
1902, the main museum building
itself was designed by (J. W. Per
cy and patterned after the muse
um at Athens which Leland hoped
to reproduce.
It is the first building in the
world on which the Ransome
process was used. This process is
the now familiar one of reinforc
ing concrete with twisted steel
rods. There is no wood in the
building and Percy once made the
statement that after the buildings
of the quadrangle have crumbled
the Museum will stand unaffected
by time.
Wall to Wail
Leland's collections, filling one
great room from wall to wall and
covering the walls to the ceiling,
include many of his toys and per
sonal works of art which were
added by Mrs. Stanford.
Several samples of artistic wood
carvings made when he was 9 or
10 years old and animals of the
Hay Area, supposedly shot and

mounted by Leland himself, are
exhibited. He also made several
large and intricate models of sail
ing vessels, which are now very
valuable. One is on Joan to the
Maritime Museum in San Fran
cisco.
Alliens Statuettes
Leland while in Athens was
given several early Greek statu
ettes by Von Nieman, the noted
archeologist.
His toys include a working
steam engine model, a pair of
white leather boxing gloves, a
jmodel train and his bicycle.
One entire case is devoted to
relics from the German siege of
Paris.
Miscellaneous objects include a
mummy's hand and foot, a mum
mified alligator, Florentine mo
saic and a check signed by < Jeorge
Washington.

I Leland devoted a large section :
| of his collections to armor and l
i weapons of medieval periods.
Concern for Dog"
Museum authorities recently
uncovered a letter written by l.e ,
land to his uncle, then manager
i of the Stanford estate, which
shows the concern he felt for lit
tie things even in the midst of his
European travels and with the
promise of an inheritance of some
$50 million. The letter, mailed in
Europe, asked his uncle to oil his
armor and be sure that his dog
and horse were being fed and
cared for.

lords' personal effects, including
