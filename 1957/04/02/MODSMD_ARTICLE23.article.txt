' A group of car pushing vandals tried in vain to jinx North Caro
lina's NCAA champion basketball team last month.
The old Buick automobile of Pete Brennan, first-string NC guard,
had heen parked in front of the Monogram Club on the Chapel llill
campus for more than 10 months as a good-luck charm for the Tar
Heel basketball team.
It remained there until just before Hie NCAA tourney began. At
thai time pranksters pushed the car from its parked position,
smeared red paint over the fenders, hood, windows and trunk and
hacked it over a curb in front of Chapel Hill's Forest Theater. *
Owner Brcmiuii remarked that he thought the vandals hud
wasted their time, adding, "I think il will just bring us even more
hick."
As later events proved, he was sooooo right.
Jon Arnell, I JSC's All-American halfback, "may dunk his toot
sies," according to the Southern California Daily Trojan. The tootsy
dunking would be in wet cement SC has its own (Jrauman's Chi
nese Theater arrangement, namely 21 athlete footprint blocks lo
cated across from the campus' Founders' Hall.
The university is making anxious but tentative plans to move
the blocks to University Avenue where they can be more of a cam
pus landmark. Five new footsy-prints would be added those of
recenily named Ail-Americans Frank Clifford, I'at C'annamela and
Arnell, Athletic Director Willis (). Hunter and ex-"Thundering Herd"
grid c.onch Howard Jones.
A rne It's older brother Itob will be out for spring football prac
tice at SC tins' year.
Hob, who trails his younger brother in school because of army
service right after graduating from high school, is probably not so
great a prospect as Jon. As Big Brother says, "When I was out
for gymnastics at Manual |L.A.'s Manual Arts High School|, I
would work nil week perfecting some trick. Then I'd come home,
teach it to Jon and in three tries he'd have it better than I."
Marty Feldman, 34-y£ar-old recently appointed foothill line coach
at San Jose State, is a Stanford graduate. Feldman, an All-Pacific
Coast Conference guard for the 1017 Indian gridmen and a member!
ol ihe Cards' all-time rugby team, also served as Stanford's assistant
freshman coach in 194 Hand junior varsity line coach in 1952.
In ihe words of Daily Trojan sports writer Bob Speck, "II could
be that SC's track and field era, tlie most fabulous in collegiate
history, is coming to an end." • • • I
Speck, in his column "Spee-U-Lation," compares Coast Jess
Morten sen on Figueroa Street with (ieneral (Jeorge Custer at the
Hat tie of the Little Big Horn.
"The fact remains," Speck declares, "ihat Custer, too, had a bunch
of fighters and it got him nowhere. He didn't have the manpower
and he came to a dismal end. SC may also find itself in the same
position, being overcome by Bruins, and maybe other enemies before
this summer comes to an end."
The "Speculator" refers to the ineligibility of seven Trojan aces, !
among them sprinter Dick Dorsey and Olympic high jump champion j
Charlie Dumas, and to the "easy going manner" of Coach Morten
sen.
"He's babied his squad long enough," Speck says of Mortensen.
"This might be a good method but not when people begin taking i
advantage of it."
Still, it will be hard to beat viith performers as two-miler Max
Truex and javelin throwers Bob Voiles and l)oug Maijala. Voiles
considers Maijala bis stillest competition for the I'CC crown.
"Stanford has some good boys, but Doug is the one to beat," '<
Voiles has said. And the javelin outlook for next year brightens too. !
As sportswriter Tom Braly says, "Rumor has it that SC has the
lop JO javelin thrower in -the nation signed, sealed and delivered for
nexi year's track team."
How much do you suppose he signed for?
Down at UCLA, probably the strongest college tennis team in
the country is, as Daily Californinn tennis writer Frank Ingan head
lines, "All Dressed Up Bui No Place to (Jo."
Although ineligible for NCAA competition this year, the Bruiriv
can unofficially stand as No. I in the nation with Davis Cuppers
Mike Franks and Mike Oreen, ex-National Junior Champ John
l.escb as well as outstanding if relatively unheralded performers
John Cranston and Franklin Johnston all hack from last year's
squad. And the IBruins were good enough to win the NCAA
tournament.
Ingan, in his series on PCC tennis prospects, rates Stanford's I
team balance as second only to UCLA's. The Indians could finish
second in the PCC', he reports.
"Stanford," Ingian says, "can'l touch UCLA but their depth will
force SC to do their best."
Of Card first man Jack Douglas, rated by many as a potential
conference champ, Ingan says, "Footballer Jackie Douglas . . . could 1
be a much belter netrnan if he spent more lime at the game, but he ;
is too much of a quarterback for that.
"While in high school Douglas and UCLA's Mike Franks had
some of the greatest schoolboy duels in tennis history. Hut the
lack of year-round practice will probably see him a bit behind
Franks this year."
The intramural basketball championship at the Univeristy of
Washington was won this year by a team known as ihe Hillyard
Burglars. Five of the nine squad members hailed from the Hillyard
district in Spokane.
They called themselves the Burglars because, as team member
Pete Curran put it, "Ilillyard is sort of a rough district."
