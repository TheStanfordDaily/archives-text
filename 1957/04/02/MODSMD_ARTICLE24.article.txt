SARATOGA. Fin., April I
(IJP) Ted Williams of the Bos
ton Red Sox boiled over today at
former President Harry Truman,
the late Senator Robert A. Taft
and "gutless politicians" who al
lowed prominent athletes to be
called back into service during
the Korean War.
He denied he tried to pull
strings to get out of returning to
the Marine Corps during the Ko
rean War. Ted referred to "gut
less politicians" and said he had
lost his respect for Senator Taft
because the late senator wouldn't
do anything for an unidentified
friend of his.
Williams angrily walked away
from reporters during a brief
workout in the rain and said, "I
don't want to talk about it any
more."
