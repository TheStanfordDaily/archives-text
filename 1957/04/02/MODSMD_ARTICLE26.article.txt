John Kelly and Bob Besse, plus
improvement by many of iho oth
er- loam mem hois, enabled t lie
Stanford Papooses to register a
pair of" track and field victories
over the spring vacation.
Last Saturday, tin 4 frosli ran
their season record to 2-0 by out
scoring Harlriell JC, Kast Contra
Costa JC, San Jose frosh and
Monterey JC. Stanford tallied
73\<i points to -17 1 - for runner-up
Hartnell. 23, the Papooses
had opened their schedule with a
lopsided win over College of Se
quoias, Reedley JC and Coalinga
JC.
Kelly paced the Indians to
their most recent victory as he
won the 100, 220 lows and broad
jump. Kelly's 24.4 in the low
sticks represented his best effort
of ihe season in that event, and
his 1(1.2 century equaled his pre
vious best mark. A jump of
22-3'j was good enough to win
the broad jump.
Three Score Year's Best Marks
Chuck McKenney, Jim Back
strand and Royal Moore turned
in their best marks of the year,
although Moore was forced to
compete unattached because of ;i
technical delay concerning eligi
bility forms. McKenney reversed
last week's setback by Hesse in,
the 440, winning in 50.6.
Backstrand also gained re
venge on Besse, throwing the
javelin 194-5 to 194-0 lor his team
mate. Moore hit the 16-6 marker
in the shot put, more than a foot
better than any previous put.
Bob Monzingo and Roger Heck
each won a distance event in Sat
urday's meet as Monzingo took
the mile in 4:25.6 and Beck
romped home the winner in a
10:34.6 two-mile. Beck was also
second in the mile.
In the 880, Dick Lassen low
ered his time to 1:58.5, but lost
hy a yard to Bud Nelson of San
Jose. Lassen ran 1:56.6 last year
at Mesa, Ari/.., High. Another
Stanford track victory came in
the mile relay as John Patterson,
Lassen, McKenney and Besse
and Besse combined for a 3:27.(J
clocking. Bosse's 50.3 anchor lap
was the best of the Jour legs.
Busy Besse
Tom Lagerquist was the only
other frosh winner in the field
events with a discus throw of
127-3. Although good enough to
win, the mark represented al
most a 13-foot drop from his
first-place mark of March 23.
In the season opener, Besse
topped the scorers with firsts in
the 440 and javelin, a second in
the 220 and a leg on the winning
relay team. His quarter-mile
time was 50.8, while his 194-0 in
the javelin established a personal
season high.

were both double winner's for the
Papooses, taking top horrors in
the sprints and distances respec
tively.
