# Society Uses Contribution As Criterion
## Cap and Gown Honors Initiative, Provides Awards to Members 
### Helen Dewar 
The contribution of a woman to
the society about her has been
the focal point of Cap and Gown
for more than 50 years.
Started in 1905 as an honorary
society for women leaders at
Stanford, Cap and Gown has,
through its history, emphasized
more than its mere function of
giving honorary recognition to a
small number of women students.
Each year the group sponsors
an ASSU Foreign Scholar, as well
as supplying a scholarship for a
domestic student.
One of its first projects, begun
soon after the group's founding,
was the financing and building of
a clubhouse where women stu
dents could meet on campus. Over
a long period of years, Cap and
Gown members and alumnae
worked to provide funds for the
eventual construction of the
Women's Clubhouse.
Projects
Funds for Cap and Gown proj
ects are raised through the yearly
sale of Stanford pictorial calen
dars. Actives sell calendars on
campus throughout the year, usu-!
ally with an all-out push during |
autumn quarter, and alumnae
work actively outside the Univer
sity to push sales. Sales to date,
this year amount to $2700, with !
$800 coming from the campus and j
$1900 from alumnae sales.
New members are welcomed
into Cap and Gown by a ritual
known as "tapping." Old Cap and
Gown members donned in black
graduation robes parade through
dormitory dining rooms at dinner
time "tapping" new members into
the group.
This year Cap and Gown re
vised its academic selection cri
teria and tapping procedure. Un
der the new provisions, grade
point minimum necessary for con
sideration was raised from 2.6 to
2.8 to fall more in line with the
current University grade average.
Tupping Procedure
The tapping procedure was also |
modified. In the past, the group
usually tapped twice a year. This !
year's members felt they could l
devote more time to service proj-1
ects iind other worthwhile activi
ties if they only tapped once a i
year, so under the new rules tap
ping will be done only in spring j
quarter. Juniors and seniors % may
be tapped.
The ceremony itself was also
modified. Following a long discus
sion over whether the ceremony
should be eliminated entirely, the
group decided to continue the tap
ping ceremony Iput to tap simul
taneously in dormitories with
more than one new member to
eliminate an otherwise long and
d rawn -out p roced u re.
Selection is made on the basis
of leadership, scholarship and
service to the University.
Criteria for final selection, ac
cording to Cap and Gown Presi
dent Shan Currie, are not abso
lute, but flexible and relative. In
general they are creativity and
initiative, contribution to the Uni
versity, personal integrity and
maturity of judgment, willing
ness to assume more than aver
age responsibility, demonstration
of fairness and sensitivity in
roles of leadership and mainte
nance of an over-all perspective.
Purpose
The purpose of Cap and Gown,
according to Miss Currie, is "ini
tially to give recognition to Stan
ford women for outstanding lead
ership and service while main
taining academic standards.
Cap and Gown also gives to these
women an opportunity to share
ideas and interests."
"Cap and Gown," she said,'
"should not be an end in itself,
but an opportunity to share expe
riences and discuss problems in
volving the campus, especially
those of concer nto seniors."
Cap and Gown is now consider
ing broadening its "Service proj
ects to include orientation ' pro
grams for students who want to
do graduate work. This program
which may begin spring quarter
or next autumn will include in
formation and discussions about
the merits and demerits of vari
ous graduate schools in this
country and abroad, Miss Currie
said.
