# MUN Plans To Entertain Delegations
## 550 Students to Attend Dance, Concert, Tea During Busy Schedule 
### 
Kay Hamilton, head of the Pro
tocol and Liaison Committee of
the Model United Nations, has
planned a busy social schedule
for the 550 delegates, and Gen
eral Services chief Stu Pollack is
wrapping up the final details on
eating and housing arrange
ments as the MUN enters the
last week before the April 10-13
conference.
Miss Hamilton has arranged
for the visitors to register next
Wednesday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
in the lounges of the Soto and
Trancos houses of Wilbur Hall.
There they will be given their
official credentials, maps of Stan
ford, mpal tickets, information
about their meetings and a
schedule of events.
Tea at Toyon
Wednesday afternoon all dele
gates are invited to a tea given
in the Toyon lounge. On Thurs
day night a dance is planned in
the Women's Gym for all the
visitors.
On Friday evening at 8, a con
cert featuring the Men's Glee
Club will be presented in Cub
berley Auditorium for the con
ference delegates.
After the Saturday General As
sembly meeting and the official
close of the MUN meeting a ban
quet will be held at the Hawaiian
Gardens in San Jose as an infor
mal send-off before the delegates
journey home.
Pollack has arranged living ac
commodations for the 550 visi
tors at over 35 motels and hotels
from San Jose to San Francisco.
Each delegate was notified of his
motel and he made his own ar
rangements and payment.
Current Problem
The current problem concerns
transportation for the 150 dele
gates who are not bringing their
own cars and who will have to
be picked up each morning be
fore 8 o'clock and brought to
Stanford for the day's events. All
interested drivers may contact
Pollack any afternoon at the
MUN office in the lIR shack.
Pollack also needs people with
people with access to trucks to
transport tables and chairs for
the delegates' meetings and
meals from various locations on
campus to the committee rooms
and Bowman Alumni House. In
terested people may see Mark
Zimmerman in Stern Hall.
The representatives will be giv
en box lunches each day and will
eat in the garden behind Bowman
Alumni House;. The delegates
will supply their own breakfasts.
The conference will cost each vis
itor $36 plus motel fees, and ap
proximately $13 of this will go
for food.
Tomorrow the series on MUN
will report on the problems and
accomplishments of the Confer
ence Services Department and its
head Steve Breyer.
