# Tornado Twists Deadly Swath Through Dallas
## 8 Known Dead, Over 100 Injured; Oklahoma Hit 
### 
DALLAS, Tex., April 2 (UP)
A tornado twisted a leisurely but
deadly path through miles of
Dallas today, killing or injuring
more than 123 persons.
At least eight were reported
dead. Seven of these were re
ported dead on arrival at Park
land (city - county) Hospital, in
one of the worst hit sections of
the city. Another person was re
ported dead in Methodist Hospi
tal, in the Oak Cliff section of
Dallas.
Dr. Ozro W. Wood, medical di
rector of the civil defense organo
zation, said 100 persons were
treated at Parkland for injuries.
Methodist Hospital reported
treating 15.
Tornado Moving
Before all the Injured were
taken out of the wreckage in
Dallas, the Weafher Bureau
warned that a tornado is moving
"toward Denton; warn all com
munities in that area."
Denton is about 35 miles north
of Dallas. Tornadoes hit towns
and communities on all sides of
Dallas, but Dallas was the worst
hit.
The twisters also swept across
wide sections of Oklahoma, and
all of that state except its pan
handle was under tornado alert.
A late count showed four dead
in three separate sections of Ok
lahoma. At least 21 had been in
jured in that state.
Topples Antenna
A twister knocked over the an
tenna tower of television station
KVSO at Ardmore, Okla., putting
the station off the air. The same
twister blew a truck off U.S.
Highway 77, killing the driver.
Two women died in a twister at
Durant, Okla.
The Oklahoma City Weather
Bureau reported more than a
dozen twisters sighted over an
area extended from the Kansas
border southward.
One of the worst hit sections
was a row of three- and four-unit
apartment houses near Parkland
Hospital. Fathers, returning
home from work, found their
homes demolished and their fam
ilis missing. Some became hys
terical.
Rips Off Roof
The tornado first hit the Oak
Cliff section of Dallas. Witnesses
there told of it ripping one roof
off, sailing up into the air, and
then hitting another roof.
Willie Weaver, a Negro attend
ant at a filling station, apparent
ly was the only person killed in
Oak Cliff. The twister blew down
a shed under which he was greas
ing a car.
Damage got worse as the twist
er reached northwest Dallas,
where it apparently stayed on
the ground for six or seven miles
before whirling off into the sky.
