band, believed to be the killers of
U.S.. aid officials Kevin Carroll
and Brewster Wilson and Car
roll's pretty wife, Anita.
Iranian forces caught up with
the outlaws and battled them near
the Pakistan border yesterday,
the officials said.
Preliminary reports from the
skirmish scene said the dead in
cluded the brother-in-law of ban
dit chief Dad Shah and two other
members of his band. One Iran

found in a ravine not far from the
spot where she was kidnaped by
outlaws who shot and killed the
two American men on the spot a
week ago Sunday.

University, to form a new govern
ment Thursday morning.
