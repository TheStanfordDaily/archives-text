# Frddlen's Support of By-Law
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Tlie Daily lias asked ASSIJ
President Bob Freelen to give his views on the
recently passed by-law giving l Legislature the
power to approve tbe result of the eleetion of
the Daily editor. Following is his statement.
I HE POWER 'Io approve is the power lo con
trol is nonsense. I'over to control The Daily
was granted to the Legislature by the students
under the current constitution, which specifi
cally provides LASSU with the duty of enact
ing all by-laws and with the right to create or
dissolve any subsidiary groups, lender such
sweeping powers the following piece of, legis
lation can hardly he considered as controlling:
'"The editor as elected by The Daily shall he
approved by a majority vote of the ASSIJ
Legislature. In the event of disapproval by
Legislature another election shall be held
within seven (lavs, with the old editor remain
ing in office until the new editor has been
elected and approved."
J his legislation merely establishes a flow of
authority from LASSU to the Daily editor. It
iimpl\ clarities that 1 he Daily's right to pub
lish originates with the elected representatives
ot the student body. Nothing more was in
tended or can be implied.
If LASSU wished to control The Daily it
could have seized the publication when the
stall walked out .March b, or by a majority vote
LASSU could have prevented the staff from
returning. Instead, a small group of LASSU

members directed numerous volunteers in a
successful ellorl lo fulfill flip Daily's obliga
tions to publish the March Bth edition. Fur
thermore, the volunteer staff took no advantage
of its unique position.
I he Daily, as the only effective means of
informing the campus, has proven it can defend
itself. Hence, I maintain that the Legislature
and the measure at hand should he given an
opportunity to prove their merits. The Daily
should be used as an instrument of self-defense
only after LASSU and/or the current legisla
tion are proved to tender an imminent danger
lo Ihe Daily's freedoms.
Rights and freedoms are not universal. This
issue was precipitated only because The Daily
was guilty of abusive exercise of its rights.
If the student body rescinds the legislation,
to whom will I lie Daily answer for its actions
in the future? Since it does not have sub
scribers, the answer is ob\ iously no one. There
lore, the issue is not whether the particular
legislation in question is good or bad, but
whether current organizational structure is de
sirable. In other words, LASSU shall have full
legislative authority over The Daily while it
is an ASSU publication, or The Daily shall be
placed on a subscription basis.
I will be very happy to discuss the problems
involved vvith interested living groups or indi
\ idual student.'-.

LASSU could have prevented the staff from
returning. Instead, a small group of LASSU

members directed numerous volunteers in a
successful ellorl lo fulfill flip Daily's obliga
tions to publish the March Bth edition. Fur
thermore, the volunteer staff took no advantage
of its unique position.
I he Daily, as the only effective means of
informing the campus, has proven it can defend
itself. Hence, I maintain that the Legislature
and the measure at hand should he given an
opportunity to prove their merits. The Daily
should be used as an instrument of self-defense
only after LASSU and/or the current legisla
tion are proved to tender an imminent danger
lo Ihe Daily's freedoms.
Rights and freedoms are not universal. This
issue was precipitated only because The Daily
was guilty of abusive exercise of its rights.
If the student body rescinds the legislation,
to whom will I lie Daily answer for its actions
in the future? Since it does not have sub
scribers, the answer is ob\ iously no one. There
lore, the issue is not whether the particular
legislation in question is good or bad, but
whether current organizational structure is de
sirable. In other words, LASSU shall have full
legislative authority over The Daily while it
is an ASSU publication, or The Daily shall be
placed on a subscription basis.

involved vvith interested living groups or indi

I HE POWER 'Io approve is the power lo con

ing all by-laws and with the right to create or
dissolve any subsidiary groups, lender such
sweeping powers the following piece of, legis
lation can hardly he considered as controlling:
'"The editor as elected by The Daily shall he
approved by a majority vote of the ASSIJ
Legislature. In the event of disapproval by
Legislature another election shall be held
within seven (lavs, with the old editor remain

elected and approved."

authority from LASSU to the Daily editor. It
