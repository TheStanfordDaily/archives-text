# $80 Thousand Allocation Made For New Telephone Exchange
## 
### 
The University administration
has allocated $80,001) lor the con
struction and equipping Â»>l a tele
phone exchange building on the
campus, a University spokesman
announced yeslei day.
The present exchange has been
badly overcrowded for several
years and cannot be expanded at
its present location in an aca
demic building, according to tini
versity planners.
The new structure ol concrete
block walls and red tile rool will
be located on Panama Street in ;i
corner of the service area of the
mechanical and electrical engi
neering laboratories.
Construction is scheduled io
begin early this summer and
completion is set for January
1958.
The new facility will enable
several economies. Its more cen
tral location will minimize the
"mileage" rates charged by the
phone company. Several small
switchboards and numerous "out
side" lines in campus offices will
be eliminated.
The new structure will contain
2050 square feel of floor space,
compared to about 500 square
feet, in the present installation.
Two-thirds of the new space will
be below ground, housing tele
phone equipment. Switchboards
for five operators will be on the
ground floor, along with a lounge

opening onto a small lerrace en
closed by a garden-type wall.
The first phase of the work
will cover all phones in academic
and administrative offices. There
will be 080 stations on the new
hoard, compared to 425 presently
available.
Eventually, possibly during the
summer of 1958, the dormitory
switchboards can h< * incorporated
into the main exchange. At that
time a system using a telephone
in each dormitory room could be
adapted to eliminate present in
tercom systems in each hall.
Working drawings for the new
telephone exchange building are
now being prepared by the archi
tectural firm of Spencer & Am
brose, the University spokesmen
said.
