Kdi tor's Note: ki< hard L. Balch, predecessor to William Craig
as Stanford's lleun of Men, is presently Director of Athletics at
« MIT. I'rior to the arrival of MlT's rughy team for games with Bay
Area teams last week (Stanford 18 —.MIT 9) this column requested
Vlr. Balch to write a comparison of MlT's "unique" athletic pro
gram and the Stanford program. Following are excerpts from
Mr. Balch's interesting letter of March 12.
"A comparison of the two schools is not fair. MIT has been, for
approximately the same number of years as Stanford, a purely tech
nological institution. Stanford, on the other hand, started with broad
academic purpose.
"The novelty |of MlT's athletic program | exists in the form of
an interest in athletic students, not student athletes. This I find
no different than Stanford. MIT chose through eircustances imposed
by the very nature of the curriculum to support a program in ath
letics designed to provide competition for those seeking intercolle
giate participation.
"This particular interest does not and will not supplant the in
terest in intramurals or the physical education class program which
is required for one year and must be completed before admission to
junior standing.
"MIT fields teams in all intercollegiate sports except football.
This is different from Stanford only in types of sports represented.
"The intramural program takes in the same general group of
activities represented at Stanford with the possible exception of
ice hockey. Land limitations and climate have not been a deterrent
to the intramural program and interest runs high.
"Out of a student body of 3600 undergraduates at MIT about
2500 take part in the intramural program. In the 18 intercollegiate
sports there are 900 participants. This particular picture of partici
pation is, as I recall, little different at Stanford.
"My job at MIT has been to tie the athletic program to the overall
concern of the Institute for the education of the 'whole man' or
better, the broad-gauged engineer or scientist. Such an effort has
been put forth at Stanford for some time but on occasion a bit ca
mouflaged by the intercollegiate program.
"Working with a staff of 26 teachers concerned with the prob
lems of coaching has demanded much of my time. We are charged
with knowing each student — his limitations and abilities; develop
ing, through training and friendly counsel, the potential of each in
dividual; and teaching a physical activity which can bo enjoyed in
college as well as in later life.
"We consider the carry-over sports to be those available in
many communities after graduation . . . tennis, swimming, sail
ing, golf, badminton, skating, etc. This again is comparable to the
Stanford program.
"The rugby team you will see on the West Coast is the result
of pure student initiative. Undergraduates, graduates, and a few
younger faculty have provided the interest.
"This is a team of rather spontaneous origin that has had more
than average success. It presents what I feel is an example of vol
untary excellence in amateur athletics.
"As a Westerner in the East I find comparisons onerous. There
are advantages to each area, both in regard to climate and education.
There is only one thing of which I am sure. The sooner the physical
education program is admitted to full partnership in the process
of education the sooner problems of subsidization and the temptation
therein will be eliminated.
"The one advantage at MIT, I might observe at this point, is
the fact the cost of facilities and staff for athletics has- been ac
cepted as a part of the total budget without income from gate
receipts. To be specific, there are no gate receipts. All events are
open to the public. This in itself provides sport for sport's sake
without catering to the entertainment dollar.
"For several years I have felt that the importance of athletics in
American education surpasses the value associated with the Satur
day afternoon catharsis provided for students, faculty, alumni and
the general public during the autumn quarter. As a devotee of foot
ball, it is difficult at best to criticize the game, but it has reached
proportions detrimental to the reason for being of institutions of
higher education.
"My hope is that Stanford will continue to follow President Ster
ling's hopes in making the extra-class life of the students a part of
the accepted pattern at Stanford. With the caliber of coaches teach
ing in the Physical Education and Athletic Department there is little
reason in my mind why Stanford can't set the pattern for the major
universities of the country with the integration of the extra-class
room life and a superior classroom experience.
"Rather than deans of men working with the negative problems
or a college community, I have found coaches' teaching to he a very
friendly and helpful means of providing counsel and guidance in
academic and personal problems."
Richard L. Balch
