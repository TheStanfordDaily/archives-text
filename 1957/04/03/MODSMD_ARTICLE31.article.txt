# Indian Track Squad to Meet Tough Fresno State Saturday
## Agostoni, Robinson Among World's Finest; First of Five Rugged Dual Meets for Cards 
### Dick Barnes 
Payton Jordan's Stanf o !• d
trackmen begin a string of live
dual meets Saturday when they
tangle with the rugged .Fresno
State Bulldogs in Fresno.
After opening the season with
a pair of victories in triangular
competition against Bay Area
squads, the Indians find them
selves face to face with a sched
ule which lists consecutive meets
against the Bulldogs, Southern
California, UCLA, Occidental and
California. All live of these
schools are boasting top teams
this spring, and are combining to
give Stanford what is possibly
the nation's toughest dual meet
slate.
Mike Agostini and Ancel Rob
inson are the big one-two punch
of the Fresno team, but are by
no means the only men with good
marks. The Bulldogs are also
strong from the 880 up, and will
probably score especially heavily
in the pole vault.
Agostini Holds Marks
Agostini is best known for his
two world - record feats in the
sprints and for his performances
in the 1956 Olympic Games. A
native of Trinidad, he placed
fourth in the 200-meter dash and
sixth in the 100-meter sprint at
Melbourne.
Last spring, Agostini startled
the spike world by racing to a
20.1 clocking in a meet at Bakers
field to erase Mel Pat ton's seven
year - old record of 20.2. Five
months later, Agostini sped the
100 yards in 9.3 to tie the exist
ing world's record.
Thus far this season, Agostini
has best marks of 9.5 and 20.5,
but could well better these times
Saturday with the combined ad
vantages of steadily improving
weather and running on the
lightning-fast Fresno track.
Robinson will get plenty of
competition from the Indians'
Chuck Cobb and Eernie Nelson in
the hurdles, but must be rated
'the definite favorite on the basis
of his past performances.
The Fresno barrier specialist is
particularly sharp in the 220
lows. His 22.5 effort of last
spring ranked second in the
world in 195(5, being topped only
by Dave Sime's new world stand
ard of 22.2.
12th in World
In the high sticKs, he has a ca
reer best of 14.1 a mark which
was good enough to rank 12th in
the world last year. This is three
tenths lower than the top times
of 14.4 for Cobb and Nelson.
Fd Den bow heads the Fresno
distance crew with a mile clock
ing of 4:12, and can also carve
out a good two-mile. Art Wilcox,
who generally doubles with the
880 and mile, has notched bests
of 1:53 and <1:15. In addition, the
Bulldogs have two other milers
who are well under 4:20.
Ait Pederson and John Brodt
are Ihe pair of vaulters who fig
ure to collect a flock of points for
Fresno. Fach lias cleared 14-4,
far better than any Stanford man
has done.

I Pederson and Marv Anderson
will probably good for at least
I the iwo runner-up spots in the
discus, and will give ihe Indians'
I Fred Peters plenty of compeli-
I tion. Anderson has flung the plat
| tor 156 feet, with Pederson only
| a foot behind.
In the shot put, Ted Sano could
upset Stanford's Ray Williamson
if the Indian weight-man is any
I less than at his best. Sano has
; thrown the iron ball 48-5, an ef
' fort which would have been good
i enough to beat Williamson last
Saturday. Williamson, however,
hit 51-BVk the previous week.
Fresno's chief weak spots ap
! pear to be in the 440, high jump,
I javelin and broad jump. Their
j best quarter-mile time is 49.8)
which the Tribe's Don (phesarek,
Chuck I nee and Bob Hyde have
all bettered in one of the first
two Stanford meets.
In the three field events, the
Bulldogs have best marks of 6-1,
185 and 20-1 respectively, all
three distances being under the
| top marks by Jordan's outfit,
j Still, the home field advantage
could help the Fresnans get up
| into good challenging position.

competition against Bay Area
squads, the Indians find them
selves face to face with a sched
ule which lists consecutive meets
against the Bulldogs, Southern
California, UCLA, Occidental and
California. All live of these
schools are boasting top teams
this spring, and are combining to
give Stanford what is possibly
the nation's toughest dual meet
slate.
Mike Agostini and Ancel Rob
inson are the big one-two punch
of the Fresno team, but are by
no means the only men with good
marks. The Bulldogs are also
strong from the 880 up, and will
probably score especially heavily
in the pole vault.
Agostini Holds Marks
Agostini is best known for his
two world - record feats in the
sprints and for his performances
in the 1956 Olympic Games. A
native of Trinidad, he placed
fourth in the 200-meter dash and
sixth in the 100-meter sprint at
Melbourne.
Last spring, Agostini startled
the spike world by racing to a
20.1 clocking in a meet at Bakers
field to erase Mel Pat ton's seven
year - old record of 20.2. Five
months later, Agostini sped the
100 yards in 9.3 to tie the exist
ing world's record.
Thus far this season, Agostini
has best marks of 9.5 and 20.5,
but could well better these times
Saturday with the combined ad
vantages of steadily improving
weather and running on the
lightning-fast Fresno track.
Robinson will get plenty of
competition from the Indians'
Chuck Cobb and Eernie Nelson in
the hurdles, but must be rated
'the definite favorite on the basis
of his past performances.
The Fresno barrier specialist is
particularly sharp in the 220
lows. His 22.5 effort of last
spring ranked second in the
world in 195(5, being topped only
by Dave Sime's new world stand
ard of 22.2.
12th in World
In the high sticKs, he has a ca
reer best of 14.1 a mark which
was good enough to rank 12th in
the world last year. This is three
tenths lower than the top times
of 14.4 for Cobb and Nelson.
Fd Den bow heads the Fresno
distance crew with a mile clock
ing of 4:12, and can also carve
out a good two-mile. Art Wilcox,
who generally doubles with the
880 and mile, has notched bests
of 1:53 and <1:15. In addition, the
Bulldogs have two other milers
who are well under 4:20.
Ait Pederson and John Brodt
are Ihe pair of vaulters who fig
ure to collect a flock of points for
Fresno. Fach lias cleared 14-4,
far better than any Stanford man
has done.

will probably good for at least
I the iwo runner-up spots in the
discus, and will give ihe Indians'
I Fred Peters plenty of compeli-

| a foot behind.
In the shot put, Ted Sano could
upset Stanford's Ray Williamson
if the Indian weight-man is any
I less than at his best. Sano has
; thrown the iron ball 48-5, an ef
' fort which would have been good
i enough to beat Williamson last
Saturday. Williamson, however,
hit 51-BVk the previous week.

Mike Agostini and Ancel Rob
inson are the big one-two punch
of the Fresno team, but are by
no means the only men with good
marks. The Bulldogs are also
strong from the 880 up, and will
probably score especially heavily
in the pole vault.
Agostini Holds Marks
Agostini is best known for his
two world - record feats in the
sprints and for his performances
in the 1956 Olympic Games. A
native of Trinidad, he placed
fourth in the 200-meter dash and
sixth in the 100-meter sprint at
Melbourne.
Last spring, Agostini startled
the spike world by racing to a
20.1 clocking in a meet at Bakers
field to erase Mel Pat ton's seven
year - old record of 20.2. Five
months later, Agostini sped the
100 yards in 9.3 to tie the exist
ing world's record.
Thus far this season, Agostini
has best marks of 9.5 and 20.5,
but could well better these times
Saturday with the combined ad
vantages of steadily improving
weather and running on the
lightning-fast Fresno track.
Robinson will get plenty of
competition from the Indians'
Chuck Cobb and Eernie Nelson in
the hurdles, but must be rated
'the definite favorite on the basis
of his past performances.
The Fresno barrier specialist is
particularly sharp in the 220
lows. His 22.5 effort of last
spring ranked second in the
world in 195(5, being topped only
by Dave Sime's new world stand
ard of 22.2.
12th in World
In the high sticKs, he has a ca
reer best of 14.1 a mark which
was good enough to rank 12th in
the world last year. This is three
tenths lower than the top times
of 14.4 for Cobb and Nelson.
Fd Den bow heads the Fresno
distance crew with a mile clock
ing of 4:12, and can also carve
out a good two-mile. Art Wilcox,
who generally doubles with the
880 and mile, has notched bests
of 1:53 and <1:15. In addition, the
Bulldogs have two other milers
who are well under 4:20.
Ait Pederson and John Brodt
are Ihe pair of vaulters who fig
ure to collect a flock of points for
Fresno. Fach lias cleared 14-4,
far better than any Stanford man
has done.

I Pederson and Marv Anderson
will probably good for at least
I the iwo runner-up spots in the
discus, and will give ihe Indians'
I Fred Peters plenty of compeli-
I tion. Anderson has flung the plat
| tor 156 feet, with Pederson only
| a foot behind.
In the shot put, Ted Sano could
upset Stanford's Ray Williamson
if the Indian weight-man is any
I less than at his best. Sano has
; thrown the iron ball 48-5, an ef
' fort which would have been good
i enough to beat Williamson last
Saturday. Williamson, however,
hit 51-BVk the previous week.
Fresno's chief weak spots ap
! pear to be in the 440, high jump,
I javelin and broad jump. Their
j best quarter-mile time is 49.8)
which the Tribe's Don (phesarek,
Chuck I nee and Bob Hyde have
all bettered in one of the first
two Stanford meets.
In the three field events, the
Bulldogs have best marks of 6-1,
185 and 20-1 respectively, all
three distances being under the
| top marks by Jordan's outfit,
j Still, the home field advantage
could help the Fresnans get up
| into good challenging position.
Payton Jordan's Stanf o !• d
trackmen begin a string of live
dual meets Saturday when they
tangle with the rugged .Fresno
State Bulldogs in Fresno.
After opening the season with
a pair of victories in triangular
competition against Bay Area
squads, the Indians find them
selves face to face with a sched
ule which lists consecutive meets
against the Bulldogs, Southern
California, UCLA, Occidental and
California. All live of these
schools are boasting top teams
this spring, and are combining to
give Stanford what is possibly
the nation's toughest dual meet
slate.
