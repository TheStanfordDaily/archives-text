# Old Quarry Source for Quad Stone
## Levi Goodrich, Early California Architect, Furnished Sandstone 
### Dave Canfield 
If Stanford University has, as
has been said, the most beautiful
college architecture in the world,
then some of the credit must go
to Levi Goodrich, the owner of a
Santa Clara County sandstone
quarry from 1870 to 1887.
From this quarry, once acclaim
ed as "the most valuable deposit
of building stone in the world,"
has come the sandstone for the
front walls and cornices of the
impressive Stanford Quadrangle.
Goodrich, a renowned architect
who was a descendant of Charle
magne, migrated to Santa Clara
County from Stockbridge, Mass.,
in 1849. In Stockbridge he had
earned fame when only 19 years
old by designing the first bay
window ever built in America.
After traveling around Cape
Morn from New York on the ves
sel Loo Choo, Goodrich crossed
the San Francisco Bay in a small
sailing craft. It took three days
to navigate the bay in 1849, and
Goodrich was a weary man when
ho finally arrived at his destina
tion San Jose.
Architectural Masterpieces
He proceeded to make a name
for himself as the foremost arch
itect in California. Among his
architectural masterpieces were
the Santa Clara County Court
house and Santa Clara County
Jail.
Fortune continued to favor
Goodrich in 1870 when he discov
ered valuable sandstone deposits
situated eight miles south of San
Jose off Alma d en Road. He
bought the land and founded
Goodrich's Freestone Quarry.
As the book "Pen Pictures from
Ihe Garden of the World" said,
"These quarries are composed of
a peculiar sandstone which has
become famous among architects
for the- evenness of its texture
and the rich beauty of its color."
"Historical Atlas of Santa
Clara County" added, "This stone
is probably the most beautiful in
the world for building purposes."
Further enhancing the value of
Ihe stone are its fireproof quali
lies and its resistance to the buf
fetings of weather and time.
Among the buildings construct
ed out of sandstone from Good
rich's quarry were the Masonic
Temple in Oakland, the Children's
Playhouse in Golden Gate Park,
the Lick Observatory and the San
Jose City Hall.
Most Famous Use
Goodrich, however, did not live
to see his quarry's sandstone put
to its most famous useâ€”the build
ing of Stanford University. The
famous architect and quarry own
er died on April 2, 1887.
At that time plans were just
beginning to be laid for the new
university. Leland Stanford told
a reporter from the old San Fran
cisco Call on April 16, 1887, that
"since my return I have set a
body of men Jn search of the
proper kinds of stone to be used
in the foundations and walls of
the buildings."
The foundations were eventu
ally built of a kind of basaltic
rock found on Stanford's farm,
while the walls and cornices were
shaped out of sandstone from
Goodrich's Freestone Quarry,
then run by Jacob Pfeiffer.
In 1901, four years before his
death, Pfeiffer changed its name
to Greystone Quarry.
Today only scars on a hillside
remain of the source of piuch of
Stanford University's beauty. Ten
descendants of Jacob Pfeiffer
raise whiteface Hereford cattle
along the banks of Alamito Creek
where their ancestor once quar
ried some of the world's finest
sandstone.
