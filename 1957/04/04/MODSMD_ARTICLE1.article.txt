# New Storms Strike South; Score Killed
## Winds Rip Gulf Area, Threaten More States; Snow Covers Rockies 
### United Press 
New tornadoes swirled
through the South Wednesday in
a deadly chain reaction of cork
screw winds and paralyzing
snows.
The United Press counted a to
tal of 21 persons dead and more
than 800 injured in the tornadoes
which ripped Texas and Okla
homa and the snows which blan
keted Rocky Mountain States
Tuesday and Wednesday.
The twisters accounted for 10
deaths, 10 of them in the devas
tated areas in and near Dallas.
Five persons died in the Western
snows.
More Tornadoes
More tornadoes hit Wednesday
in the Fort Worth-Dallas area,
Arkansas and Louisiana. The
U.S. Weather Bureau warned
more twisters might strike in a
total of 11 statesâ€”Arkansas, Mis
souri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennes
see, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama,
Mississippi, Indiana and Ohio.
The tornado threat would
drive northeastward across a
vast area from Texas to Ohio,
forecasters said. Meanwhile,
snow drove rapidly across the
Midwest, dumping five inches on
Moline, 111., and three inches on
Fort Wayne, Ind.
Violent ('lash
A U.S. Weather Bureau spokes
man said the tornadoes and wind
storms were being triggered by
the violent clash between unsea
sonably warm temperatures, hit
ting the 80's in Tennessee, and
wintry air driving out of the
north and northwest. Similarly,
the clash between the hot and
cold air, plus moist air draining
up from the Gulf of Mexico, con
tributed to the heavy, wet snows,
he said.
Wednesday's first batch of
twister's lacked the lethal power
of the great black funnel which
churned through Dallas Tuesday
night.
