said today it would drastically
curtail mail service, effective
Saturday, unless Congress appro
priated an extra $47 million to
carry it until the end of the fiscal
year on July 1.
A House Appropriations sub
committee promptly denied most
of the funds, voting to give (he
agency only $17 million. Subcom
mittee Chairman J. Vaughan
Gary (D-Va.) said it was up to
the Post Office to decide how far
to curtail service.
Postmaster General Arthur E.
Summerfield told the subcommit
tee at a closed-door session he
would have to end all carrier de
liveries on Saturday, close all
post offices on Saturdays and re
duce mail deliveries in business
districts to one a day.
Rural Mail
Subcommittee members said
Summerfield also declare! he
would have to discontinue rural
mail deliveries on Saturday.
The Post Office declined elabo
ration on Summerfield's closed
door testimony. The National
Association of Letter Carriers
termed the cutback a catastrophe
and summoned top union offi
cials to an emergency meeting
.Representative Gary said after
the subcommittee meeting that it
was up to the Post Office De
partment whether it could get
along for the rest of this fiscal
year on the $17 million voted by
the group.
"What Economies"
"They will have to determine
what economies they will have
to make," Gary said. "We don't
run the Post Office."

on grounds Summerfield's de
partment failed to comply with a
law requiring it to apportion its
funds equally over all four quar
ters of the year.
He said the $30 million shoi t
age resulted from the fact the
department took funds from the
fourth quarter and spent them
during the third quarter of the
year.
Summerfield told the subcom
mittee, according to members,
that he had to spend money fast
er than authorized by law be
cause of increased use of the
mails, plus the necessity of es
tablishing new delivery routes to
accommodate expanding commu
nities.
