# Education and Business
## 
### 
A principle basic to the American scheme of
life is education for all. Our public school
system is designed to meet the basic needs of
all citizens. Our colleges and universities, both
public and private, are designed to extend the
privilege of further education to those who are
capable—and willing.
Another principle basic to the American
scheme of life is business unencumbered by
any more than necessary regulations. Although
it has become a laughable platitude through
over-use, the phrase "rugged individualism"
lias applied to American businesses since the
day our Constitution was established. Indi
vidual initiative, either in the small "home
town store or the diversified stock-holding
manufacturers, is still very much a part of the
American business scene.
How these two principles of ample educa
tion and comparatively free business can and
should interact is being demonstrated on the
Stanford campus. The student in tlie lecture
hall or laboratory today may be a salesman,
technician, professional man, or scientist to
morrow. Business needs these trained men for

its own perpetuation. Ami business is now
enabling the capable ami willing to learn,
while at the same lime ensuring its own future.
Five major aircraft manufacturers have re
cently pledged $105,000 for support of the new
Division of Aeronautical Engineering a! Stan
ford. Convair, Douglas, Hughes, Lockheed and
North American have donated to the fund,
which will help pay salaries, purchase new
equipment and facilities, and furnish fellow
ships for graduate students. The division will
commence operations in the l ( ). r >7 r>P» academic
year.
In addition to a distinguished faculty headed
by Nicholas J. HofV, currently of the Brooklyn
Polytechnic Institute, the department will re
reive further aid from the aircraft industry
with courses instructed by skill members from
the Ames Laboratory and Miller Helicopters.
As details of the plans continue to unfold,
we feel that both the companies involved and
the University are to be congratulated on their
recognition of the mutual dependence of busi
ness and education ami on their actions toward
aiding one another.
