Gifts and pledges totaling $105,-
000 have been received from five
major aircraft manufacturers for
support of the new Division of

ate students In the division. The
division will come into operation
with the start of the academic
year 1957-58.
Research in the new division
will be principally in highspeed
gas adynamics, boundary layer
theory, thermal effects on air
craft structures, stress analysis of
lightweight structures, and auto
malic control.
One of the nation's leading au
thorities on aircraft structures,
Nicholas J. Huff, is coming to
Stanford from Brooklyn Polytech
nic Institute to head the division.
Walter G. Vincenti, Stanford
honor graduate and an outstand
ing research scientist at the Ames
Aeronautical Laboratory at Mof
fett Field, became professor in
the field of aerodynamics in Jan
uary, and Dr. Daniel Bershader,
