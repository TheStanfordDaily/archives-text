u 1 HE CAREFUL YOUNG \IF.\" The Nation labeled
today's college youth in a recent article. The
article points to the fact that today's college
youth are not coming to college for knowledge,
or to think, hut just because college enhances
one s social prestige, or chances of getting a job.
Perhaps the greatest truth revealed in the
article was the fact that there is no enthusiasm
or individualism among today's college youth.
Conformity is worshiped; individualism is
completely frowned upon.
And, as Wallace Stegner points out, this situ
ation exists at Stanford as much as any other
college.
At Stanford, one of the leading educational
institutions in the country, a student is still
able to hit across the top of his courses, get
the facts for the examination, and still not
really delve into the meat of the subject mat
ter, the thought of the course.

Hon* al Stanford I !i<* unusual, the departing
frorn-t he-ma jorily-or-crowr] feeling, is treated
with amazement and apprehension.
But what is more important is that this feel
ins is on all leading campuses in the nation.
If this listlessuess is prevalent here, then there
is little hope lor dynamic leaders of tomorrow,
for it is from these campuses supposedly that
onr leading politicians, thinkers and teachers
will arise.
Stegner's plea ol "My Cod, feel something!
Cet excited about something, plunge, go boom,
look alive! i* ;i real challenge to today's youth.
Carefulness and mature reflection before taking
rash moves is a good thing, hut when prac
ticed to a degree that carefulness becomes a
thing within itself and discourages any real
original thought or enthusiasm, then it is
dangerous.
And we agree with the 16 professors in The
Nation that this danger is very real today.
