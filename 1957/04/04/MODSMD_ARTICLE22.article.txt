Nation magazine conducted a
symposium on today's under
graduate. Contributors includ
ed Iti educators from as many
American colleges and univer
sities. (English professor Wal
lace Sterner wrote on Stan
ford.) Following is a synopsis
of (lie discussion liy Nation cor
respondent Dick Meister, for
mer Daily editor.

Dad's generation was "lost";
ours has been tagged "silent." On
inspection by 1(! American teach
ers, however, ihe present genera
tion seems neither "lost" nor "si
lent." It is merely "careful."
The caution of today's under
graduate was best described, per
haps, by Stanford's Wallace Steg
ner, who said:
"Sometimes a professor is bait
ed into protest by the rows and
circles of their closed, watchful,
apparently apathetic faces, and
says in effect, 'My God, FEEL
something! Get enthusiastic about
something, plunge, go boom, look
alive!'
"The response may vary: anger
(controlled) at the professorial
intrusion, embarrassment at the
crude expression of a violent feel
ing, or perhaps sarcastic com
ments on the delightful results of
enthusiasm under Hitler, or the
fine product of commitment to
Marx or any of the other causes
and shibboleths of their parents'
time."
The "Goalkeeper"
Stegner compared the student
to a "goalkeeper" who, while he
may not "score," is certain not
to be scored upon. While some
times inclined to disparage this
attitude as "dull, faint • hearted
and unproductive," Stegner is "re
minded that it is also self-reliant
and sane."
Stanford is hardly unique. Sim
ilar reports came from the 15
other .institutions represented in
the survey. Carlos Baker, Prince
ton, surmised that this must be
the "Age of Consolidation."
"They are too busy reading and
thinking about older thinkers and
writers," he said, "to pay exten
sive heed to the newest ones."
But how many heed any think
ers at all?
"Quiet Enervation"
From Queens College, in New
York, Stanley Kunitz noted that
"the mass of college students lead
lives of quiet enervation. . . . Most
students do not come to college
in pursuit of the true, the beauti
ful, or the good; they come he
cause a degree increases earning
power and enhances social pres
tige. . . .
"The influx of a new student
population in part barely literate,
in the main holding no concepts
of value distinguishable from
those of our society at large, has
resulted in a serious deterioration
of the intellectual climate."

Yale's Charles A. Fenton noted
that "the present campus indif
ference to either politics or re
form or rebellion is monumental."
"Company Men"
He concluded: "This is a tal
ented undergraduate generation,
industrious and attractive and a
pleasure to teach, but most of
them are company men. And why
not? Who can blame them? They
have been signed up almost since
birth, after all, in what Neibuhr
has described as 'a paradise of do
mestic security and growing jus
tice suspended in a hell of inter
national insecurity.' "
Professor J. A. Bryant, Jr., of
the University of The South (Se
wanee) claimed that the presen
tation of values to undergraduates
"is too often accommodated to
please healthy, good-natured ado
lescents of all ages and to con
firm what most citizens of Go
pher Prairie have always believed
that American ingenuity can
make all things easy and painless
and that standardized commodi
ties, including standardized food
for the mind, are proof of flour
ishing democracy in the land."
The social critics, then, have
lost their audience. They no long
er can influence, if they even try.
Depression—War
"The Depression and the War
made him (the student) look
away from himself," the Univer
sity of Michigan's Allan Seager
contended. "College has ceased to
be a brightly-lighted stage where
he discovers who he is. It is rath
er a processing chamber, where,
with touching submissiveness, he
accepts the remarks of lecturers
and the hard sentences of text
books as directives that will lead
him to a job."
Tnr cause of this? There "are
at least three," according to Karl
Shapiro at the University of Ne
braska. He lists them as:
"Loss of political idealism, the
contemporaneity of cultural val
ues, and prosperity. . . .
"Chamber of Commerce moral
ity is flourishing as never before;
th° caricatures of Sinclair Lewis
are today's cabinet ministers; and
who was the King who appointed
Prime Minister Eisenhower? Was
it not 1 lemy K. Luce?"
"Quiet as Mice"
Today's students are not smug,
he said; they are only "indiffer
ent. . . . Their minds are as quiet
as mice."
Charles Shapiro, Wayne State
University (Detroit), said: "The
world of enthusiastic ideas, with
its questioning vigor which should
be the first gift of the college to
the student, has been stolen away.
It is small wonder- that our good,
often brilliant, students live pep
less Jives of cynicism and toler
ance."
However, it may be "all for the
good," he commented. For "in a
machine age, with automation al
most here, individualism might
make the training of so many

students a bit difricult. But I
can't help feeling, as do many of
my colleagues, that we are doom
ing too many wonderful young
sters to four years of stagna
tion."
"Would-Be Radical"
From Columbia University,
Richard Chase observed that the
"would-be radical" is not common
on campus, but that such a stu
dent is becoming "acutely aware
of the hostility of our contempo
rary conformist culture to any
signs of genuine rebellion. He is
painfully aware, too, of the scat
tered, disunified quality of his
feelings and ideas. But sometimes
he is so bold as to think that a
revitalized American culture de
pends on him. I think he is right."
Chase's evaluation appears to
be the clearest picture of today's
undergraduates — the "c a r e 112 u 1
young men." The evaluation is
sound, for if students are to arise
from the 20-year sleep of compla
cency they must throw off the
wet blanket of caution and heed
Stegner's exhortation to "get en
thusiastic about something,
plunge, go boom, look alive!"
In short, they must act. If they
can.
