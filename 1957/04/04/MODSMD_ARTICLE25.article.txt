### Dick Barnes 
Norman Lloyd, ace distance
star from Canada, has been de
clared eligible for freshman
track competition this year at
Stanford, it was revealed yester
day by head track coach Payton
Jordan.
Lloyd will run the mile and
two-mile for Floyd Strain's frosh
team in Saturday's meet against
West Contra Costa JC and City
College of San Francisco. Since
he has been unable to follow a
rigorous workout schedule the
past few weeks, Lloyd is expect
ed to run primarily for condi
tioning rather than for outstand
ing times.
While the frosh are hosting
ihe two JC teams in the Stanford
Stadium, the varsity will be meet
ing Fresno State 4 on Fresno's
speedy Radcliffe Stadium track.
Jordan named his traveling
squad yesterday, and it included
four men who will be seeing duty
in three events each. Sophomore
middle distance man Don Chesa
rek was nominated for Ihe 440
and 880, and will also run a leg
on the Indians' mile relay quar
-1 et.
Preps for KC
Chesarek is being given Ihe ex
tra work in an effort to bring him
up to top form for next week's
Southern California titanic. Jor
dan hopes his young star can
open with a 48.5 quarter and re
turn with a 1:52 half-mile.
Chuck Cobb and Bernie Nelson
will each be going in the same
three events high hurdles, low
hurdles and high jump. Although
Nelson has won the FCC high
stick title the past two years,
Cobb has been able to nip his
teammate in both of I heir meet
ings ihis season, with his top
time a sterling H I. Nelson has
hit 14.5.
In the low barriers, Cobb has
also been hot. Last week against
San Jose, he bettered the Stan
lord school record with a 23.1
clocking. The mark will not
count, however, because of a six
mile-per hour aiding wind.
I'leasant Surprise
Frank Herrmann, the fourth
iron-man of the meet, will run in
both sprints in addition to com
peting in his best event, the
broad jump. Herrmann has been
a pleasant surprise in Ihe dashes,
hitting the finish in 9.8 and 20.9
against San Jose last week.
In the broad jump last week,
Herrmann soared out to the 24-5

mark as he continued to show
great week â€¢ to - week improve
ment. After being bothered by a
bad leg last year, he appears to
be back in the form which en
abled him to win the PCC title
his sophomore year.
Maury Graves, last year's soph
omore distance sensation but a
little behind schedule this year,
will tackle both the mile and two
mile. Graves turned in a 4:17.8
clocking two weeks ago, losing to
the Olympic Club's Lowis Zel
lers by a foot. Then last week,
he lost by a narrow margin to
surprising Wes Bond of San Jose
State.
Far Above Best
Graves' time of 9:29.9 was
over 20 seconds higher than his
all-time best, but he is expected
to soon approach last year's ef
fort. Doubling up in the weight
events will be Archie Schmidt
and Ray Williamson, both of
whom will be in the shot put and
discus.
Jordan has set up two teams
to go in the mile relay. The first
quartet will consist of quarter
milers Chesarek and Bob Hyde,
half - miler Joe Woolett and
sprinter Chuck Ince.
The second combine will be
made up of sprinters Jim Easter
and Ben Anixter, hurdler Bob
Newman and quarter-miler Bill
Carls.
