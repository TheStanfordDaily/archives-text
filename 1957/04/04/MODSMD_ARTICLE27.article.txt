## 
### Steve Baffrey 
Stanford freshman baseball
uniforms come oul of mothballs
1 his weekend as Dick Clegg's Pa
pooses open their 1957 season.
The frosh are scheduled to meet
James Lick High School from
San Jose tomorrow at 3:15 p.m.
and the San Jose State frosh Sat
urday at 9:30.
Clegg reports that 29 men are
currently out for baseball, and
that he hopes to be able to use
most, or all, of these over ihe
weekend.
This year's squad looks to be
exceptionally strong on the
mound. Clegg also feels that de
fensive play will be no problem.
Hitting presently looks like the
weak spot, but even this may im
prove in time.
Pitching assignments for the
weekend's games have been an
nounced. The local mentor plans
to start right-hander Warren Nel
son against Lick. Also set to
work in the Lick tussle is Dick
Williams, the team's "best all
around" player, who will play in
the outfield when not on the
mound.
Two right-handers will face
San Jose on Saturday. Maurice
Le Blanc will open the game, and
Steve Watson, who comes to the
frosh with an exceptional high
school record, will finish.
Both games will be played on
the Sunken Diamond, and admis
sion is free.
