In acting as guards at the com
mittee and General Assembly
meetings, ROTC students will ex
clude all unaccredited delegates,

The MUN schedule now calls

Trusteeship Council. All these
correspond directly to the real
UN organizations.
In January, Sheri Newman and
.fill White of the Conference Serv
ices department sent out agenda
items for all the committees and
councils lo the member delega
tions. Every MUN member is on
each of the committees, and each
of them will have 100 lo 120 mem
bers at the MUN meetings.
Agenda Items
The agenda items to be discuss
ed include such problems as the
Suez, Hungary and others, like
lite nationality of married women
and the problem of West Irian
(New Guinea). Each committee
has three or four problems to
discuss.
The delegations have submitted
resolutions on each of (he prob
lems. These were received and
codified in February by the Con
ference Services department. The
staff then chose the Ihree or four
best resolutions on each problem
and officially listed them for dis
cussion.
In the meantime, Craig Barnes,
head of the Conference Depart
ment procedural officers, and oth
er Stanford students selected for
positions as chairmen, vice-chair
men and secretaries of the com
mittees had been training at week
ly classes in the University's
Speech and Drama Department.

For this course they received one
unit and studied the procedure for
conducting UN meetings.
MUN has also arranged a sys
tem for submitting amendments
in committee meetings. During
the discussion on a resolution a
delegate may write out an amend
ment. He will then give it to a
duplication officer and pay a 25-
cent fee.
The amendment will then he
codified and sent to the duplica
tion center. There it will be sten
ciled and a copy will be given to
each delegate in the committee.
The entire process should take

the time the delegate presents his
amendment on the floor each per
son in the room will have a writ
ten copy before him. .

Ihe most colorful rvcnl of the
entile session. Flags of SO na
tions will he brought onto the
stage of Memorial Auditorium by
a military detachment in full uni
form at the opening meeting next
Wednesday night. Only the new
Ghana of the 81 nations being
represented at MIJN will not have
a flag.
In acting as guards at the com
mittee and General Assembly
meetings, ROTC students will ex
clude all unaccredited delegates,
pass out amendments and keep
order.
Battles Expeeted
This last promises excitement
with expected battles between the
Rgypt and Israel delegations, an
attempted seating of Communist
China and a squabble between
rebel and Communist government
representation of Hungary by the
delegates from College of Puget
Sound.
The MUN schedule now calls
for a General Assembly meeting
Wednesday night, committee
meetings from 8 a.m. to noon and
2to p.m. Thursday and Friday,
and a final General Assembly
meeting Saturday.
The four committees are the
Political and Security, the Eco
nomic and Finance, the Social,
Cultural and Humanitarian, and
the Ad Hoc Political. There are
also the Security Council, the Ec
onomic and Social Council and the
Trusteeship Council. All these
correspond directly to the real
UN organizations.
In January, Sheri Newman and
.fill White of the Conference Serv
ices department sent out agenda
items for all the committees and
councils lo the member delega
tions. Every MUN member is on
each of the committees, and each
of them will have 100 lo 120 mem
bers at the MUN meetings.
Agenda Items
The agenda items to be discuss
ed include such problems as the
Suez, Hungary and others, like
lite nationality of married women
and the problem of West Irian
(New Guinea). Each committee
has three or four problems to
discuss.
The delegations have submitted
resolutions on each of (he prob
lems. These were received and
codified in February by the Con
ference Services department. The
staff then chose the Ihree or four
best resolutions on each problem
and officially listed them for dis
cussion.
In the meantime, Craig Barnes,
head of the Conference Depart
ment procedural officers, and oth
er Stanford students selected for
positions as chairmen, vice-chair
men and secretaries of the com
mittees had been training at week
ly classes in the University's
Speech and Drama Department.

For this course they received one
unit and studied the procedure for
conducting UN meetings.
MUN has also arranged a sys
tem for submitting amendments
in committee meetings. During
the discussion on a resolution a
delegate may write out an amend
ment. He will then give it to a
duplication officer and pay a 25-
cent fee.
The amendment will then he
codified and sent to the duplica
tion center. There it will be sten
ciled and a copy will be given to
each delegate in the committee.
The entire process should take
less than 45 minutes, so that by
the time the delegate presents his
amendment on the floor each per
son in the room will have a writ
ten copy before him. .


END OF AN ORDEAL—The Model United Na
tions Conference Services group met yesterday

for the sessions to begin April 10.
