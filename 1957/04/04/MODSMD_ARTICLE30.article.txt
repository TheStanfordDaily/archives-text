## 
### Dave Canfield 
Outstanding play by the three
doubles teams sparked Stanford's
net men as they rolled handily
over Modesto JC yesterday on
the varsity courts, 7-2.
"All of the doubles teams did
well." reflected Coach Bob Ren
ker. The three Stanford duos lost
a total of only 11 games in six
sets as they set the visitors down
with ease.
First doubles team of Jack
Douglas-Dave Nelson crushed Gil
Rodriguez and Ed Panui, 6-2, 6-2.
In second doubles, the Indians'
Gil White and Brooks Rawlins
lost little time in their 6-0, 6-2
massacre of Eduardo Guzman
and John LeMet.
Dick Gould and Bob Bowden
followed suit as they slaughtered
Marvin Pees and Fred Jones in
a 6-2, 6-3 walk-away.
Douglas Breezes
Jack Douglas again proved his
domination of fellow Northern
California tennis players as he
loafed past Rodriguez, 6-2, 6-4, in
the top singles match.
Fourth singles ace White
crushed LeMet by 6-1, 6-3, with
fifth man Lowell Carruth bowl
ing over Pees, 6-4, 6-4. In sixth
singles Bob Prince lost only one
game in racing to a 6-0, 6-1 warm
up win over Jones.
Stanford's only defeats came
at the hands of Modesto's top two
singles stars, Guzman and Pa
nui. Guzman, playing second sin
gles rather than his usual top
spot, upset Rawlins in a hard
fought 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 duel.
Panui won another three-setter
from Nelson, 7-9, 6-4, 6-4.
The netmen enplane at 5:30
p.m. today for Los Angeles and
two big matches with USC Fri
day and UCLA Saturday. The
Bruins and Trojans finished first
and second respectively in the
nation last year. This year, both
teams, especially the Uclans, are
expected to be even stronger.
Stanford placed third in last
year's NCAA. Although having
lost NCAA runner-up Jack Frost
through graduation, the racket
eers have been helped by the un
expectedly good performances of

sophomores Nelson, Rawlins.
Carn.ith and Gould and, as Hon
ker says, "We have a chance
against them because we have
good doubles teams.
Meet ITK<l T K< First
"We play USC first, which is
good because we'll know a little
better what our chances arc after
we play them."
USC is sparked by 1956 NCAA
titleholder Alexander Olmedo of
Peru. Though ineligible for 1 lie
NCAA this year, Olmedo can
boast of a victory over mythical
world champion Lew Hoad of
Australia.
Leading UCLA are Davis Cup
pers Mike Green and Mike
Franks and former National
Boys Champion John Lesch.
