Friendship, technique and ad
venture highlighted the mountain
climbing 112 i I m "Starlight and
Storm," given last night in Cub
berley Auditorium by Gaston Re
bufl'at.
Climbing is joy to Rebuffat. He
is happy when he is a guide.
"When I start climbing again, the
reason for climbing is at once
clear to me or one of the reasons
to struggle on for nothing else
but satisfaction," lie said.
"Here the significance of the
struggle is to strip men so as
better to bring them together. To
get her we have sweated on the
moraines and shivered in the bi
vouac . . . known apprehension,
uncertainly and fear; but of what
importance is all I hat ?
New Discoveries
"For it was only up there that
we discovered m a ny things of
which we had previously known
nothing: a joy that was new to us,
happiness that was doubled be
cause it was shared, a wordless
friendship which was no mere su
perficial impulse."
The movie was beautifully
filmed in color. Rebuffat was sad
that the photographer was never
able 1o get in his own movies,
for he was an essential part of
the production and had to climb
the mountains also.
The movie was divided into two
sections. The first was devoted
to technique like Tyrolean tra
verse (changing one's position
from the top of one pinnacle to
the top of another pinnacle via
a rope between the I wot.
Six ('lassie Climbs
The second half showed the ac
tual climbing of the six classic
north faces in the Alps. They
were the last routes to be climbed
because of their steepness and
snow. For example the Cima
Grande has been described as
"the upper half is vertical and
the lower- half is overhanging."
A rock dropped from 1600 feet
up the mountain will land at
least 70 feel away from the base
of the mountain. Steep.
The north face of the Eiger
was also climbed in the movie.
This was no snap. Many Ger
mans and Austrians died in the
1930s attempting it for the moth
er country. This mountain has a
reputation, "The Eiger without
bad weather is not the Eiger."
A turn-away crowd witnessed
this award-winning, and deserv
edly so, film. Rebuffat met after
the lecture and autographed
books and talked with interested
persons. John Hariin, president
of the Stanford Alpine Club,
which sponsored the film and
lecture, introduced Rebuffat.

which we had previously known
nothing: a joy that was new to us,
happiness that was doubled be
cause it was shared, a wordless
friendship which was no mere su
perficial impulse."
The movie was beautifully
filmed in color. Rebuffat was sad
that the photographer was never
able 1o get in his own movies,
for he was an essential part of
the production and had to climb
the mountains also.
The movie was divided into two
sections. The first was devoted
to technique like Tyrolean tra
verse (changing one's position
from the top of one pinnacle to
the top of another pinnacle via
a rope between the I wot.
Six ('lassie Climbs
The second half showed the ac
tual climbing of the six classic
north faces in the Alps. They
were the last routes to be climbed
because of their steepness and
snow. For example the Cima
Grande has been described as
"the upper half is vertical and
the lower- half is overhanging."
A rock dropped from 1600 feet
up the mountain will land at
least 70 feel away from the base
of the mountain. Steep.
The north face of the Eiger
was also climbed in the movie.
This was no snap. Many Ger
mans and Austrians died in the
1930s attempting it for the moth
er country. This mountain has a
reputation, "The Eiger without
bad weather is not the Eiger."
A turn-away crowd witnessed
this award-winning, and deserv
edly so, film. Rebuffat met after
the lecture and autographed
books and talked with interested
persons. John Hariin, president
of the Stanford Alpine Club,
which sponsored the film and
lecture, introduced Rebuffat.
Friendship, technique and ad
venture highlighted the mountain
climbing 112 i I m "Starlight and
Storm," given last night in Cub
berley Auditorium by Gaston Re
bufl'at.
Climbing is joy to Rebuffat. He
is happy when he is a guide.
"When I start climbing again, the
reason for climbing is at once
clear to me or one of the reasons
to struggle on for nothing else
but satisfaction," lie said.
"Here the significance of the
struggle is to strip men so as
better to bring them together. To
get her we have sweated on the
moraines and shivered in the bi
vouac . . . known apprehension,
uncertainly and fear; but of what
importance is all I hat ?
