# Ike Denies He Will Give Up Duties to Nixon
## President's Proposed Disability Amendment Precipitates Rumors 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 3 <IJP>
President Eisenhower said today
a report that lie might turn over
his duties to Vice President Rich
ard M. Nixon when world condi
tions permitted was "dip worst
rot that I havp heard."
Some reports along this line
cropped up alter tho White House
asked Congress to approve a con
stitutional amendment which
would permit the Cabinet to de
tei mine when a President was un
able to carry out his duties. The
Vice-President would take over
until the President was well.
Eisenhower, obviously nettled
by this interpretation of his pro
posed amendment, told a news
conference "I cannot imagine
where these stories came from."
No Reason
He said that when his doctors
reported he was physically able
to undertake a second term he
told the American people "it was
my intent and purpose to carry it
honestly and do it that way."
Ho said he knew of "no reason
why any speculative writer should
at least doubt my basic integrity
and honesty."
Told that some lawmakers, such
as Speaker Sarn Rayburn, had
criticized the disability proposal,
the President said that "all we
sent to Congress was a sugges
tion of how something might be
done."
The plan would authorize a
President to let the Vice-President
temporarily perform his duties if
he frit he was unable to handle
them. In event a President could
not or would not make this de
termination, the Cabinet could
do so.
Cabinet Loyalty
At a hearing this week some
members of a House Judiciary
subcommittee suggested that a
Cabinet's loyalty to the President
would prevent it from acting ob
jectively. Others said the amend
ment might enable the Cabinet
and the Vice-President to "gang
up" on a President.
In considering the problem, Mr.
Eisenhower said, "we ran into the
feeling that the people of the
United States would resent very
bitterly any effort or any oppor
tunity for anyone antagonistic to
the President just to give him the
old heave-ho on a political basis
and get rid of him."
He. said Cabinet members were
"presumably friends of the Presi
dent" and that "we assume we are
dealing with honest people; we
are not dealing with people who
are jockeying against each other
to seize power."
