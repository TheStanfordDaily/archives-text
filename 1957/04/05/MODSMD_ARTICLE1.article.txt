## Request Stanford Reconsider Stand Against Clauses 
### 
The National Association for
the Advancement of Colored Peo
ple recently asked Stanford to re
consider its decision not to include
mandatory ant i - discrimination
clauses in its property contracts.
President Wallace Sterling an
nounced after a Board of Trustees
meeting on March 21, in which
the trustees denied a petition to
that effect, that the trustees
would not condone any discrimi
nation, hut they did not think it
necessary to include the clauses.
Lester Bailev, field secretary
for the NAACP, on March 27 ask
ed the trustees to reconsider their
action.
NAAt'P Petition
I)i the petition, dated March 18,
the Palo Alto Branch of NAACP
asked the trustees to "cause to be
inserted mandatory anti-discrimi
nation clauses in all contracts
wherein University property is
. . . conveyed to private interests
for the purpose of developing
housing ... on campus;
"That such clauses shall specifi
cally prohibit any and all lessees
. . . from discriminating on the
account of race, color, religion or
national origin. . . ."
Sterling announced that, after
considering the request, the trus
tees "reaffirmed in that respect
the policy under which it has
leased its lands for some years
for residential and other use.
"No Discrimination"
"There are no discriminatory
clauses in leases made by the
University with developers of
University properties for residen
tial or other use, nor do such dis
criminatory clauses exist in any
leases or subleases of University
properties. The University would
not condone any attempt to use
any such discriminatory clauses,
but at the same time sees neither
reason nor necessity for insertion
of the requested clauses.
"It is worthy of repetition that
the University has always receiv
ed into its midst qualified stu
dents, faculty and staff of all
races, religions and national ori
gins."
"Missed the Boat"
Norman C. Howard, legal ad
viser of the Palo Alto Branch,
NAACP, said that "Dr. Sterling
missed the boat. . . . We are not
denying that Stanford is always
open to all qualified students, but
we don't know what a private de
veloper will do."
A University spokesman March
27 said that as far as the staff was
concerned, the issue was closed.
He said the request had been
thoroughly considered, and the
decision not to include the clauses
was final.
The West Coast regional presi
dent of NAACP announced yes
terday that a discussion on "Why
Anti-Bias Clauses in Stanford
Land Leases?" will be held Mon
day evening at 8 at 1305 Middle
field Road, Palo Alto.
