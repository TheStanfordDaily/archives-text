# Sloan Scholars Feted at Dinner In Menlo Park
## 
### 
The 19 students attending Stan
ford on Sloan scholarships were
entertained at a dinner last night
at Menlo Country Club, at which
the administrator of the scholar
ships and University officials
were present.
Administrator of the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation scholarships is
Joseph Allen of New York city.
The Sloan Foundation was
started in 1934 by the then chair
man of the General Motors board
of directors. It is a private philan
thropic trust similar to the Car
negie and Ford foundations.
Although the Sloan Foundation
is interested primarily in support
ing medical research, it annually
makes grants to some 20 U.S. col
leges to be awarded as stipend
scholarships to individuals.
Basic Policy
"The basic policy of the founda
tion is to support individuals rath
er than projects," Allen noted.
"We feel it is an investment in
the future."
Sloan scholarships, based on
need rather than a student's ma
jor, are given only to men. Each
college decides how much to give
the students, and the scholarships
range from $200 to $2000 a year.
