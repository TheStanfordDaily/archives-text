# Winter Rains Put Water Level Up; Temperature 75
## 
### 
Spring quarter at Lake Lagu
nita opened with a flurry of ac
tivity yesterday as the first crowd
of students since the lake was
officially opened by the ASSU
swarmed down to the dock and
boathouse.
The official opening day was
one of the most beautiful in the
history of the lake. The tempera
ture during most of the day stood
at about 75 degrees, with an
agreeably warm sun shining
down on the backs of the stu
dents who rushed to get rid of a
bit of their winter quarter pallor.
The level of the water was as
high yesterday as it was at its
highest point last year, according
to lifeguard Vernon Lovejoy.
There was a question earlier this
year whether the accidental open
ing of a drainage gate had caused
the water to be lower than would
provide good swimming.
Boathouse Open
The boathouse was open even
on the first day, and lifeguards
said there were at least seven
boats, either rowboats or canoes,
on the lake at almost any one
time. A new addition to the lake's
fleet seemed to be a number of
rubber rafts.
Opening day saw no lessening
from previous years of the num
ber of playful casualties, planned
or unplanned, among the equip
ment or occupants of the lake
borne flotilla. Upset canoes were
at their usual premium, but the
more steady rowboats were not
as susceptible to sabotage.
One of the swimmers said that
the weeds growing from the lake
bed were no particular bother and
that the water was warm, clear
and smooth, except for what dam
age was done to the placid surface
by the occasional warm, gentle
breezes which provided the only
change from the generally calm
day.
Hours 1 to 6
The lake and boathouse will bo
open for the rest of the quarter
from 1 to 6 p.m. weekdays "and
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays
and Sundays.
All fraternities, eating clubs
and living groups with boats in
the boathouse are requested to
submit group membership lists to
the boathouse if-they plan to use
their boats.
Lifeguard Lovejoy cautioned
students to pay pai*ticular atten
tion to the boathouse regulations
and not to swim outside the rafts
or when there is no lifeguard on
duty.
There are now four floats on
the lake, all within easy swim
ming distance of the dock and
beaches.
Lifeguards said there was no
problem yesterday from high
school students, who usually pre
sent the only disciplinary problem
with which the lifeguards are con
fronted.
