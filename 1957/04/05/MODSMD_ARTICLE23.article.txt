# Stanford and Discrimination
## 
### 
Racial discrimination is a problem which is
not unique to the South. It exists in some
form or another throughout the country, and
Stanford has not been, without some of these
racial problems.
The Palo Alto-Stanford Branch of the Na
tional Association for the Advancement of
( olored People has been petitioning the Stan
ford Board of Trustees to include anti-discrimi
nation clauses in the contracts it is drawing up
to lease land to private developers.
The contract would forbid discrimination
policies either in the leasing of land or in
hiring of labor for the developments. We agree
with the reasons behind this re<fuest, but, like
the Stanford Board of Trustees, think it is
slightly unnecessary.
Stanford's recent attitude toward discrimi
nation has been highly commendatory. Even
the NAACP admits that racial and religious
barriers play little part in Stanford's admit
ting of students.
The University administration, as well as the
Board of Trustees, has pursued its racial and
religious policies to the point where it has
turned down scholarships that have racial or
religious qualifications. Although such anti
discrimination clauses are in Mrs. Stanford's
founding grant, the University could have cir
cumvented them if it wished.
The racial situation again came to a head
last fall when it was publicized that many
fraternities on campus had racial discrimina

tion clauses in regard to their pledging prac
tices.
But it turned out that these clauses were
national organization orders and in many rases
were being ignored hy local chapters. Most of
the local houses seem to he doing a competent
job in removing these clauses.
When Dean of Men William (Iraig announc
ed the new fraternity plan last month, he said
that, "the University is opposed to discrimina
tory racial and religious clauses and practices
and will work with students to eliminate them
at the earliest date." We predict that by the
time the University fraternity building pro
gram is finished, all discriminatory practices
will have ceased.
Still the INI AA( IP has a point. Discrimina
tion in housing in many communities surround
ing Stanford has been the rule rather than the
exception.
However, all phases of the housing develop
ment program have been and will continue to
be checked hy the University, and we doubt if
any such practices as are feared by the TNAAdP
will occur.
The NAACP has issued a challenge to Stan
ford in that it will be setting au example for
future similar housing developments in the
area and elsewhere, and it must live up to this
responsibility.
If Stanford's recent anti-discrimination pol
icy is carried on, then the NAACP has little
to worry about, and the Stanford Hills develop
ment will be the fine example it should be.
