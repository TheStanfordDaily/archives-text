Proposal Nothing New
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested in reading in the press the
recent accounts of the proposed "cluster" type
fraternity housing as suggested by University
officials recently.
This proposal is nothing new. In 1927, when
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur was president of Stan
ford University, the Stanford Alumni Interfra
ternity Conference, composed of alumni repre
sentatives from all Stanford fraternities, was
presented with the so-called "dormitory plan" of
fraternity housing. Sketches were drawn by John
Branner, an architect, and considerable discus
sion ensued.
The arrangement, as I recall, consisted of a
central kitchen and recreation room, with each
fraternity having its own dining and living quar
ters, laid out in quadrangle form, for four fra
ternities.
After considerable discussion by both sides,
the program was shelved for lack of funds to
carry it out, coupled with stiff opposition from
the alumni of the various fraternities.
Thirty years later, it is again presented to
fraternity men of Stanford University.

Shackles of Conformity
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to your editorial on "The Careful
Generation," it might be appropriate to examine
some of the reasons why conformity exists on
the Stanford Campus. As Dick Meister has
pointed out, some of the causes are symptomatic
of our generation as a whole. Some, however,
are characteristic of the Stanford educational
philosophy and as such warrant close scrutiny.
Probably the most important problem is the
lack of extracurricular (or, more specifically,
extra-lectural) intellectual stimulation. As long
as a premium is placed by the faculty on an os
motic absorption of specific course material,
and as long as the length and scope of assign
ments and student competition are manipulated
to this end, it seems quite unreasonable to expect
intellectual individuality and enthusiasm. There
is a profound difference between "knowledge for
knowledge's sake" and knowledge as the key
to further understanding.
Certainly the critics of our generation are not
urging that we be intellectual Don Quixotes.
Rather they are pointing out the need for fac
ulty and students alike to be quixotic enough to
break the shackles of conformity.
