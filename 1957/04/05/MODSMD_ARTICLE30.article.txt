# Indians--Broncos Meet In Home-and-Home Series
## Santa Clara, Winless in CIBA Play, Hosts SU Swatters in San Jose Today 
### 
Stanford's baseball Indians return to the conference wars this
weekend with a pair of games against the improved Santa Clara
Broncos. This afternoon's game is slated for 3 in San Jose Munici
pal Stadium while the clubs will clash tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. on
the Sunken Diamond.
Santa Clara will be shooting for its first 1957 victory in the

California Intercollegiate Base
ball Association. The Broncos
are the only winless team in the
loop, having dropped their open
ers to defending champion South
ern California. In pre - season
play Santa Clara holds victories
over San Jose State, a team
which has downed Stanford twice
this season.
Third baseman Mike Shea and
first sacker Tim Gdode head the
Broncos at the plate, both being
rated "top hitters." The club
boasts a sharp fielding infield,
Shea again being a standout.
Payne and Verdurmen
Card Coach Dutch Fehring has
named right handers Walt Payne
and Bd Verdurmen as the pitch
ers to oppose Santa Clara. Payne
lias a 1-2 record on the season
while Verdurmen stands at 1-1.
The Bronco starters are un
named but. southpaw Jack llig
gins is a probable choice. Last
season the Indians defeated Hig
gins, on Ihe strength of Hal
Messner's home run.
The biggest question In the
Card camp ;it the moment is
"Who's at short?" Regular Steve
Stewart is still recovering from
a muscle pull and is a doubtful
starter. Sophomore Wayne Mar
ion, who has filjed in very ca
pably for Stewart, is suffering
lrom an injured thumb and may
not see action. Behind them is
Bob Flanders, who may be side
lined by a boil.
Figueroa to Short.
If none of the regular short
stops can st:iH, Fehring plans to
move Rudy Figueroa to short
with junior' Bob Dwight stepping
in at third.
Figueroa and center fielder
Bob Fletcher have been the top
Stanford hitters to date. Marion
has also done a good job at the
plate in recent games, picking up
two singles against Southern Cal
ifornia last Friday and another
pair against Sacramento State on
Tuesday.
The CiBA seems headed for
one of its finest seasons as, af
ter just one week of play, no
team is unbeaten. USC stands on
top with a 4-1 mark, followed by
California and UCLA, 1-1. Fehr
ing looks for a "real close" race
and tabs California as the loop's
strongest.
