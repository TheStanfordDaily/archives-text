# Freshmen Set to Host CCSF, W. Contra Costa at Angell Field
## 
### 
Floyd Strain's Stanford frosh trackmen aim for their third
straight win of the year when they host City College of San Fran
cisco and West Contra Costa JC tomorrow at Angell Field. Meet
time has been moved up from 10:30 to 10 a.m.
The Papooses' two big scprers, John Kelly and Bob Besse, are once

again expected to pace the attack,
with Norman Pease, Bob Monzin
go and newcomer Norman Lloyd
also looked to for good perform
ances.
Much of the interest will be
centered about Lloyd, a transfer
from England who has clicked off
a 1:52.6 half-mile and 4:15 mile.
Strain has entered him in the mile
and the two-mile tomorrow with
ihe idea of providing a good work
out for Lloyd, who is not yet in
peak condition.
Kelly will be going in "only"
three events tomorrow, after hav
ing tried as many as five in recent
meets. His 23 - foot - plus broad
jumps in the winter conditioning
meets make him the favorite in
that event. Kelly has also hit 24.4
in the lows and 10.2 in the 100.
Pease is the big Stanford hope
in both sprints, with season bests
of ?» x and 22.1. Up will be backed
in both races by Hesse, another
of tin' frosh team's all-around per
formers. Besse will also be re
newing his duel with teammate
Jim Backstrand in the javelin.
Two weeks ago Besse threw I*ll
feet to whip Backstrand. Then
last week the standings were re
versed as Backstrand threw the
spear MM 5 while Besse again hit
104.
Tom Lagerquist, co-captain of
the Irosh team along with Besse,
will be out to get back near the
140 foot mark in the discus after
slipping to 127-3 last week. In the
remaining weight event, the shot
put, Royal Moore looks like the
best bet for Slanford.
Running with Lloyd in the two
distance events will be Monzingo,
the prep ace from San Diego Hoo
ver. He ran a crisp 4:25.0 mile
last week, but could get only a
fourth in the 880.
Another record may fall in Ihe
pole vault, with John Stahler aim
ing at Bob Mathias' standard of
13%. Two weeks ago Stahler
cleared the bar at 13 and then
missed by the narrowest of mar
gins at 33-3.
Strain will unveil a pair of late
comers from the basketball squad
in the high jump. Paul Gillespie
and Marion Keyes hope to fill the
bill, thus plugging one of the real
weak spots in the frosh team.

that event. Kelly has also hit 24.4
in the lows and 10.2 in the 100.
Pease is the big Stanford hope
in both sprints, with season bests
of ?» x and 22.1. Up will be backed
in both races by Hesse, another
of tin' frosh team's all-around per
formers. Besse will also be re
newing his duel with teammate
Jim Backstrand in the javelin.
Two weeks ago Besse threw I*ll
feet to whip Backstrand. Then
last week the standings were re
versed as Backstrand threw the
spear MM 5 while Besse again hit
104.
Tom Lagerquist, co-captain of
the Irosh team along with Besse,
will be out to get back near the
140 foot mark in the discus after
slipping to 127-3 last week. In the
remaining weight event, the shot
put, Royal Moore looks like the
best bet for Slanford.
Running with Lloyd in the two
distance events will be Monzingo,
the prep ace from San Diego Hoo
ver. He ran a crisp 4:25.0 mile
last week, but could get only a
fourth in the 880.
Another record may fall in Ihe
pole vault, with John Stahler aim
ing at Bob Mathias' standard of
13%. Two weeks ago Stahler
cleared the bar at 13 and then
missed by the narrowest of mar
gins at 33-3.
Strain will unveil a pair of late
comers from the basketball squad
in the high jump. Paul Gillespie
and Marion Keyes hope to fill the
bill, thus plugging one of the real
weak spots in the frosh team.

straight win of the year when they host City College of San Fran
cisco and West Contra Costa JC tomorrow at Angell Field. Meet
time has been moved up from 10:30 to 10 a.m.
The Papooses' two big scprers, John Kelly and Bob Besse, are once

again expected to pace the attack,
with Norman Pease, Bob Monzin
go and newcomer Norman Lloyd
also looked to for good perform
ances.
Much of the interest will be
centered about Lloyd, a transfer
from England who has clicked off
a 1:52.6 half-mile and 4:15 mile.
Strain has entered him in the mile
and the two-mile tomorrow with
ihe idea of providing a good work
out for Lloyd, who is not yet in
peak condition.
Kelly will be going in "only"
three events tomorrow, after hav
ing tried as many as five in recent
meets. His 23 - foot - plus broad
jumps in the winter conditioning
