# Ruggers Meet UCLA To Start Big Week
## 
### 
"Omaha! Omaha! Omaha!"
The cry which rang out repeatedly across the rugby field during
four days of intensive practice week indicated two things: Stan
ford's rugby team is composed primarily of football players; and
the rugby team meets UCLA tomorrowâ€”unfortunately, in the
southland.
For Pete Kmetovic's undefeated and untried charges, however,
it will be just the first of three games in an eight-day period. They
will finish their 1957 schedule next week with the two "Big Games"
with California.
UCLA's ruggers added their own insult to last fall's 14-13 injury
when they snubbed the Cards earlier in the season, deciding they
could not stay for a Monday game after tasting defeat at the hands
of California on Saturday.
Since that Cal defeat, however, the Bruins have not been headed
and now sport a 6-2-1 record.
Led by the goal kicking of John Dowse and the running of Bob
Bergdahl and Chuck Hollaway, Ihey ran up impressive 24-0 and 35-3
victories over Yale last week.
Stanford is undefeated in five games against minor Bay Area
competition, but faces the season's toughest competition in its clos
ing games. Still logy from the three-week layoff during finals, they
managed an 18-9 victory over MIT Saturday.
Whether they are up to their earlier rating as top team on the
coast remains to be seen. Lost for the season is break Bob Peterson,
but the return of wingback Gordy Young will be some compensation.
Stanford's JV's will meet St. Mary's on the rugby field at 2 p.m.
tomorrow.
