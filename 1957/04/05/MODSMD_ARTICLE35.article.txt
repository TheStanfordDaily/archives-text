# Netmen Open Conference Play In L.A. Against Troy, Bruins
## SC's Olmedo Rated Top Collegiate Player; UCLA Ineligible to Defend '56 NCAA Title 
### 
Stan ford's varsity tennis tram
will open its Pacific Coast Con
ference season today at 1 p.m.
when Coach Bob Renker's net
men battle highly regarded I JSC
in Los Angeles.
Tomorrow will see ihe Indians
facing even more highly rated
UCLA in a 1 p.m. engagement in
Westwood.
The Cards will take the court
in both matches as decided un
derdogs. Few tennis fans would
give ihe Renkermen more than a
slim chance aaginst the Bruins,
who were first in the nation last
year, and this year are reported
to be even better.
But team depth, in which the
Indians are much improved over
their 1956 NCAA third - place
team, should make the Southern
Cal tangle a close one.
Neither Eligible
Neither UCLA nor USC is eli
gible for NCAA competition in
any sport this year because of
PCC rule infractions.
Thus Alexander Olmedo, the
S Trojans' Peruvian powerhouse,
cannot defend his NCAA singles
j title. But Olmedo is, if anything,
better than he was last June
when he bowled over Stanford's
Jack Frost for the national
crown.
The muscular junior terrorized
America's top players on last
I summer's grass court circuit and

closed 1 fitÂ» season in a spectacular
w;iy by upselting mythical world
champfon Lew Hoad.
This season Olmedo has proved
such wins were not flukes.' In
Southern California college tour
naments he has consistently top
pled both of UCLA's aces, Mike
Green and Mike Franks.
Davis Cuppers
C.reen and Franks traveled to
Australia last fall wilh the Unit
ed States Davis Cup team.
Rounding out the Bruins' star
studded array of seasoned tennis
players are John Lesch, former
National Boys Singles champion,
and John Cranston, former Na
tional Boys Doubles champion
(with Stanford's Bob Bowden).
Stanford's main hope in the
two outings is Jack Douglas, this
year's Northern California Inter
collegiates winner. Douglas twice
carried Franks to three sets last
year and is expected to continue
his bitter series of battles with
the Uclan first man tomorrow.
Douglas and Franks have been
staging epic tennis struggles
since their high school days when
the South e r n California pair
were battling for the national
junior championship.
