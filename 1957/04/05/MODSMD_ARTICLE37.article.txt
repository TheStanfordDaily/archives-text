# Stanford Thinclads Meet Fresno State Tomorrow
## Bulldogs' Radeliffe Stadium Stage For SU's Toughest Opposition to Date 
### Dick Barnes 
The young season's toughest
opposition is expected to greet
Stanford tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
when Pay ton Jordan's Indians
i u/i into rugged Fresno State on
the Bulldogs' Radcliffe Stadium
track.
Co - captains Frank Herrmann
and Phil Fehlen will lead the
rapidly - improving Tribe as it
goes for its third straight victory
of the season. Tomorrow's en
counter opens a five-week slate
of dual meets for Stanford which
includes headline rs against
Southern California, UCLA, Oc
cidental and California.
The Indians go into the meet
as slight favorites due to their
apparently better balance and
slightly superior depth. Fresno
boasts two of the world's finest
performers- Mike Agostini and
Ancel .Robinson — but after Ibis
pair, Ihe Bulldogs take a bit of
a drop before hitting another res
ervoir of talent. These men
should, nevertheless, give Stan
ford a good battle.
Record Holder
Agostini, currently the co-hold
er of the world's record in the
100 and former record-holder in
the 220, is expected to have little
trouble winning the sprints,' but
the Indians will be in strong con
tention for the place points.
The day's best races will prob
ably lie the two hurdles duels.
Robinson was number two in the
world last year in the lows, and
has already hit 14.1 in Ihe highs
this season. Stanford's Chuck
Cobb and Bernie Nelson will be
hot after Robinson in both
events.
Cobb ripped off a 23.1 low
sticks effort last week, and has
clocked 14.4 in the highs. Nel
son will be strongest in the 42-
inch hurdles, where he has twice
won the PCC title and has
notched a 14.5 this spring.
Trouble til Mile
Stanford could be in trouble in
the mile run. Ed Denbow of the
Bulldogs has already run 4:12
and improved steadily through
out his college career. Maury
Graves is the big Stanford hope
in the mile but is almost six sec
onds below Denbow.
Fehlen will be out 1o up his
new school record in the high
jump. Two weeks ago against
the Olympic Club and Santa
Clara YC, the lanky senior leaped
6-BVa to establish the new stand
ard. In the process, he beat Vern

Wilson, Herm Wyatt and Ernie i
Shelton, three of the world's best j
high jumpers.
The quarter-mile could see Jor- ,
dan's squad picking dp valuable
points if Don Chesarek. Bob
Hyde and Bill Carls perform up
to their capabilities. Chesarek
will be doubling in the 440 and
880, but is out to break 48.5 in
the shorter race.
Peters Favored
Fred Peters stands head and I
shoulders above anyone else in
the discus with his outstanding
toss of 170-2. On a basis of his
consistent improvement, Peters
should take this event.
Fresno looks hot in the pole
vault, where they have two men
over 14-4 compared to the In
dians' mest of 12-6 by Bob Cast
Another of Jordan's rapid im
provers, Herrmann, will be after
a new personal high in the broad
jump. He soared 24-5 last week
and could team with Kent Han
sen and Chuck Peterson to give
the Indians a big scoring edge in
this event.
Bob Van Luchene, a transfer
from Mt. San Antonio, will get
his first chance to run for the
Tribe when he goes in the two
mile. Graves and Warren Wood
will also be in the eight-lap grind
for the Indians.

Fehlen will be out 1o up his
new school record in the high
jump. Two weeks ago against
the Olympic Club and Santa
Clara YC, the lanky senior leaped
6-BVa to establish the new stand
ard. In the process, he beat Vern

Wilson, Herm Wyatt and Ernie i
Shelton, three of the world's best j
high jumpers.
The quarter-mile could see Jor- ,
dan's squad picking dp valuable
points if Don Chesarek. Bob
Hyde and Bill Carls perform up
to their capabilities. Chesarek
will be doubling in the 440 and
880, but is out to break 48.5 in
the shorter race.
Peters Favored
Fred Peters stands head and I
shoulders above anyone else in
the discus with his outstanding
toss of 170-2. On a basis of his
consistent improvement, Peters
should take this event.
Fresno looks hot in the pole
vault, where they have two men
over 14-4 compared to the In
dians' mest of 12-6 by Bob Cast
Another of Jordan's rapid im
provers, Herrmann, will be after
a new personal high in the broad
jump. He soared 24-5 last week
and could team with Kent Han
sen and Chuck Peterson to give
the Indians a big scoring edge in
this event.
Bob Van Luchene, a transfer
from Mt. San Antonio, will get
his first chance to run for the
Tribe when he goes in the two
mile. Graves and Warren Wood
will also be in the eight-lap grind
for the Indians.
The young season's toughest
opposition is expected to greet
Stanford tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
when Pay ton Jordan's Indians
i u/i into rugged Fresno State on
the Bulldogs' Radcliffe Stadium
track.
Co - captains Frank Herrmann
and Phil Fehlen will lead the
rapidly - improving Tribe as it
goes for its third straight victory
of the season. Tomorrow's en
counter opens a five-week slate
of dual meets for Stanford which
includes headline rs against
Southern California, UCLA, Oc
cidental and California.
The Indians go into the meet
as slight favorites due to their
apparently better balance and
slightly superior depth. Fresno
boasts two of the world's finest
performers- Mike Agostini and
Ancel .Robinson — but after Ibis
pair, Ihe Bulldogs take a bit of
a drop before hitting another res
ervoir of talent. These men
should, nevertheless, give Stan
ford a good battle.
Record Holder
Agostini, currently the co-hold
er of the world's record in the
100 and former record-holder in
the 220, is expected to have little
trouble winning the sprints,' but
the Indians will be in strong con
tention for the place points.
The day's best races will prob
ably lie the two hurdles duels.
Robinson was number two in the
world last year in the lows, and
has already hit 14.1 in Ihe highs
this season. Stanford's Chuck
Cobb and Bernie Nelson will be
hot after Robinson in both
events.
Cobb ripped off a 23.1 low
sticks effort last week, and has
clocked 14.4 in the highs. Nel
son will be strongest in the 42-
inch hurdles, where he has twice
won the PCC title and has
notched a 14.5 this spring.
Trouble til Mile
Stanford could be in trouble in
the mile run. Ed Denbow of the
Bulldogs has already run 4:12
and improved steadily through
out his college career. Maury
Graves is the big Stanford hope
in the mile but is almost six sec
onds below Denbow.
