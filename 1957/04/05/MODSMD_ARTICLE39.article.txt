# DURING SPRING RECESS
## Yarborough Organizes New College Housing Association 
### 
Dr. John M. Yarborough, who
serves the University as director
of residences and Stanford Vil
lage as well as coordinator of
conventions, put on another hat
recently by organizing a state as
sociation of college housing di
rectors.
Joining Yarborough in launch
ing the new organization were
Miss Christine Rieker, director
of Stanford dining halls, and H.
Don Watts, director of residence,
California State Polytechnic Col
lege.
The new California Association
of College and University Hous
ing Offices came into being in
Stanford's new Florence Moore
Hall during spring vacation. Rep
resentatives of 18 schools attend
ed the organizing convention.
One Action
One of the first actions taken
by CACUHO was to elect Yar
borough as president. Purpose of
the state group is to discuss
problems of mutual interest.
"California has unique situa
lions not found in most other
states," Yarborough noted. "For
instance, our climate causes a
need for a different type of dor
mitory construction from lhat in
the East or North."
Among other problems pecu
liar to California are the rapidly
growing population and the cost
of labor, which is higher than in
many less populated areas.
A national organization of
housing directors, started in 1950,
has Ihe same name as the state
group, minus I Ik? word "Calif or
nia." The national group, of
course, considers situations com
mon to dormitories on any cam
pus.
OismssioM Topics
"The national organization will
talk about such things as how to
solve the problem of tape that
takes paint off the wall, outside
lighting, domestic help, as well
as the more serious problems
such as financing, construction
cost and other problems," Yar
borough said.
The state association is affili
ated with but is not part of the
national group. That is, member
ship in one group does not auto-'
matically carry into the other.
CACUHO membership is open
to housing directors from any
college — two- or four-year —>
which operates dormitories.
Among the 18 charter members
are included dormitory directors
from private and state colleges
and branches of the University of
California.
Stanford's Yarborough is a
graduate of Texas A&M and he
received his master's and E.D.
degrees from Stanford. For his
doctoral work he specialized in
personnel and guidance.
Headed Personnel Service
Starting with Stanford in 1950
as head of the Student Personnel
Service, Yarborough became di
rector of the Village in 1953 and
director of all residences in 1955.
His son, John Jr., is currently
a junior at Stanford, majoring
in electrical engineering.
The housing director noted
that most of his knowledge of
running residences comes from
practical experience. "Most of
those things that go to make a
successful dormitory program
you must learn for yourself," he
said. "You just don't find them
in books."

Headed Personnel Service
Starting with Stanford in 1950
as head of the Student Personnel
Service, Yarborough became di
rector of the Village in 1953 and
director of all residences in 1955.
His son, John Jr., is currently
a junior at Stanford, majoring
in electrical engineering.
The housing director noted
that most of his knowledge of
running residences comes from
practical experience. "Most of
those things that go to make a
successful dormitory program
you must learn for yourself," he
said. "You just don't find them
in books."

Dr. John M. Yarborough, who
serves the University as director
of residences and Stanford Vil
lage as well as coordinator of
conventions, put on another hat

of Stanford dining halls, and H.
Don Watts, director of residence,
California State Polytechnic Col
lege.
The new California Association
of College and University Hous
ing Offices came into being in
Stanford's new Florence Moore
Hall during spring vacation. Rep
resentatives of 18 schools attend
ed the organizing convention.
One Action
One of the first actions taken
by CACUHO was to elect Yar
borough as president. Purpose of
the state group is to discuss
problems of mutual interest.
"California has unique situa
lions not found in most other
states," Yarborough noted. "For
instance, our climate causes a
need for a different type of dor
mitory construction from lhat in
the East or North."
Among other problems pecu
liar to California are the rapidly
growing population and the cost
of labor, which is higher than in
many less populated areas.
