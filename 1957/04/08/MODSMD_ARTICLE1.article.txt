### 
WASHINGTON, April 7 (UP)
- The attorney for Teamster
President Dave Beck said today
th;il former Republican Chair
man Leonard W. Hall solicited
Beck's support for President Ei
senhower in the 1956 Presidential
campaign.
Hall promptly recalled that the
statement by the Beck attorney,
Arthur Condon, "just isn't so."
Labor Secretary .James P. Mitch
ell, who said just a week ago that
Beck's support of Eisenhower
was "unsolicited," also stuck to
his original statement.
Condon said he went to see
Hall last Oct. 1 on a matter af
fecting the trucking industry.
He said Hall asked him then to
see if Beck would come out pub
licly in support of Eisenhower as
we did in 1952.
Condon, who is associated with
Beck in a trucking industry la
hoi management committee, said
he complied with Hall's request
and took up the matter with
Beck. Beck subsequently en
dorsed the President.
'Must Isn't So"
Informed of Condon's state
ment on the CBS television pro
gram, "Face the Nation," Hall
said at his home in Glen Cove,
N.Y., that "it just isn't so, that's
all."
"The only time I remember
seeing Mr. Condon was when he
asked to see me on a matter con
cerning the trucking industry,"
Hall said. "I don't recollect any
thing in the discussion concern
ing the campaign."
"But in answer to his state
ment, it just isn't so, that's all,"
Hall added. "All we talked about
was a meeting in Washington
concerning the trucking indus
try." Hall emphasized that he
was speaking of the same Oct. 1
meeting to which Condon re
ferred.
The United Press tried to con
tact Condon at the television stu
dio to obtain his reaction to
Hall's denial. But he sent word
through a studio official that he
did not wish to comment further
on the matter.
General Counsel
Condon is general counsel for
the trucking industry labor-man
agement committee of which
Beck is a member. He also served
as Beck's attorney and sat by his
side when Beck recently refused,
oh grounds of possible self-in
crimination, to testify before the
Senate Labor Rackets Commit
tee.
The attorney flatly contradict
ed Mitchells' statement last Sun
day that Beck's support of the
President was "unsolicited."
He said "common sense" would
dictate that Mitchell's statement
was "incorrect." He said he is
confident that "every Republican
candidate, wanted the support of
the Teamsters."

asked to see me on a matter con
cerning the trucking industry,"
Hall said. "I don't recollect any
thing in the discussion concern

"But in answer to his state
ment, it just isn't so, that's all,"
