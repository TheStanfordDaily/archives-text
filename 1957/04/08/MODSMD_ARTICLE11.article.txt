# Stanford Nicks Fresno, 70-61, In Track Meet
## Chesarek Blazes 46.8 Anchor -Leg to Stop Agostini, Clinch Win 
### Dick Barnes 
Don Chesarek blazed an unof
ficial 46.8 mile relay leg to hold
off Fresno State's Mike Agostini
and give Stanford a 70-61 track
and field victory over the Bull
dogs Saturday at Fresno's Rad
cliffe Stadium.
Superior depth won the meet
for Payton Jordan's team as the
Indians were outseored in first
places, but picked up the lion's
share of the seconds and thirds.
Entering the relay, however,
Stanford led by only four points
and needed to take the closing
event to win the meet. Bill Carls
led off for the Tribe and came
through with a two-foot lead, al
though forced to run on the out
side lane for 220 yards.
Bob Hyde opened up an eight
yard lead by the end of his sec
ond leg, and Joe Woollett wid
ened the gap by an additional 12
yarjls. Then Chesarek took over
and never let Agostini get close
as Stanford finished in 3:18.1.

Although Fresno's Jack Wilcox
won the 880, Woollett was a bat
tling second in 1:53.5, almost two
seconds faster than he has ever
run before. Chesarek could get
only third in this race as he fell
too far behind in the early going.
