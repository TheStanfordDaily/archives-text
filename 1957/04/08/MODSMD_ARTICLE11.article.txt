# Stanford Nicks Fresno, 70-61, In Track Meet
## Chesarek Blazes 46.8 Anchor -Leg to Stop Agostini, Clinch Win 
### Dick Barnes 
Don Chesarek blazed an unof
ficial 46.8 mile relay leg to hold
off Fresno State's Mike Agostini
and give Stanford a 70-61 track
and field victory over the Bull
dogs Saturday at Fresno's Rad
cliffe Stadium.
Superior depth won the meet
for Payton Jordan's team as the
Indians were outseored in first
places, but picked up the lion's
share of the seconds and thirds.
Entering the relay, however,
Stanford led by only four points
and needed to take the closing
event to win the meet. Bill Carls
led off for the Tribe and came
through with a two-foot lead, al
though forced to run on the out
side lane for 220 yards.
Bob Hyde opened up an eight
yard lead by the end of his sec
ond leg, and Joe Woollett wid
ened the gap by an additional 12
yarjls. Then Chesarek took over
and never let Agostini get close
as Stanford finished in 3:18.1.
Best-Ever Marks
Chesarek, Woollett, F rank
Herrmann, Kent Hansen, Hank
Roldari, Doug Martin, Leonard
Bates, and Bill Carls all regis
tered their best-ever marks in in
dividual events to help the In
dians to their victory.
Chesarek bettered his personal
record by over a full second as
he won the 440 in 47.7. Carls,
who ran second in the same race,
notched 49.2 in showing more
than a second's improvement
over his past two races. Hyde
also looked sharp as he ran a
close third in 49.3.
Although Fresno's Jack Wilcox
won the 880, Woollett was a bat
tling second in 1:53.5, almost two
seconds faster than he has ever
run before. Chesarek could get
only third in this race as he fell
too far behind in the early going.
Herrmann had two broad
jumps over his previous all-time
best, the first measuring 24-7%,
ihe second and winning leap
breaking the sand at 24-S'l.
These marks become even more
impressive when Ihe poor pit
conditions ;it Radcliffe are taken
into consideration. Hansen's 23-9
for second place also represented
a great improvement.
Javelin thrower Roldan got
better as the competition contin
ued, and finally won his event
with an excellent throw of 220-4.
Ii was in the field events where
Stanford actually won the meet
as Ihe Indians collected 35 points
1o only l!) for Fresno, and gained
five'of the six first places.

missed the 170 fool mark 'in win
ning Ihe discus wilh a heave of

Martin almost nipped Maury

he crossed Ihe finish in 4:21.4.

Cobb. Robinson, among ihe na
lion's finest slickrnen, won both
bailies in clockings of 14.1 and
22.7, Iho latter the fastest in tin*
United States this year.
Cobb was caught in 14.4 for'
the highs and 23.4 for the lows.
Bales, who sneaked in for third
in Ihe lows, had a career best of
23. H in Ibis race. Mike Agostini
and Terry Randell helped Fresno
in ihe sprints as Herrmann could
get only a pair of thirds. In the
100, Agostini had a wind-blown
0.4, but his 20.'1 in the 220 was
legitimate. >
Itreak Jinx
The victory ran the Indians'
season mark to 3-0, and enabled
Ihem to break a jinx of several
length during which the
Tribe' had never won a meet
which hinged on the relay.

spirit and determination the

a meet of this type, and looks for

meets against Southern Califor

Bob Hyde opened up an eight

Itreak Jinx
The victory ran the Indians'
season mark to 3-0, and enabled
Ihem to break a jinx of several
length during which the
Tribe' had never won a meet
which hinged on the relay.
Jordan was elated with the
spirit and determination the
squad showed in finally winning
a meet of this type, and looks for
Ihe Indians to make good show

meets against Southern Califor

Don Chesarek blazed an unof
ficial 46.8 mile relay leg to hold
off Fresno State's Mike Agostini
and give Stanford a 70-61 track
and field victory over the Bull
dogs Saturday at Fresno's Rad
cliffe Stadium.
Superior depth won the meet
for Payton Jordan's team as the
Indians were outseored in first
places, but picked up the lion's
share of the seconds and thirds.
Entering the relay, however,
Stanford led by only four points
and needed to take the closing
event to win the meet. Bill Carls
led off for the Tribe and came
through with a two-foot lead, al
though forced to run on the out
side lane for 220 yards.
Bob Hyde opened up an eight
yard lead by the end of his sec
ond leg, and Joe Woollett wid
ened the gap by an additional 12
yarjls. Then Chesarek took over
and never let Agostini get close
as Stanford finished in 3:18.1.

Chesarek, Woollett, F rank
Herrmann, Kent Hansen, Hank
Roldari, Doug Martin, Leonard
Bates, and Bill Carls all regis
tered their best-ever marks in in
dividual events to help the In
dians to their victory.
Chesarek bettered his personal
record by over a full second as
he won the 440 in 47.7. Carls,
who ran second in the same race,
notched 49.2 in showing more
than a second's improvement
over his past two races. Hyde
also looked sharp as he ran a
close third in 49.3.
Although Fresno's Jack Wilcox
won the 880, Woollett was a bat
tling second in 1:53.5, almost two
seconds faster than he has ever
run before. Chesarek could get
only third in this race as he fell
too far behind in the early going.
Herrmann had two broad
jumps over his previous all-time
best, the first measuring 24-7%,
ihe second and winning leap
breaking the sand at 24-S'l.
These marks become even more
impressive when Ihe poor pit
conditions ;it Radcliffe are taken
into consideration. Hansen's 23-9
for second place also represented
a great improvement.
Javelin thrower Roldan got
better as the competition contin
ued, and finally won his event
with an excellent throw of 220-4.
