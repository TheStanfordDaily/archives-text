Anti-Discrimination Clauses

Editor, The Daily:
1 was disturbed to read in Friday's Daily that
the Board of Trustees had decided not to include
mandatory anti - discrimination clauses in con
tacts leasing University lands to private de
velopers. According to the Daily article, the only
reasons for this action were that previous con
Tiacts have not included such clauses and that
' ueh clauses were not necessary to prevent dis
ci imination.
Although it is nice to he consistent, the Uni
versity should not Jet the precedents of previous
len-mg contracts bind them in future actions,
it improvements in these contracts can he made,
hey ■ hould be made regardless of past decisions.
The Daily editorial stated that lands leased by
the University will be "checked" for discrimina
tory practices. However, without clauses in the
1< i- e.'- prohibiting discrimination, what good will
"i heeking" do? The University will be powerless
to enforce any type of anti-discrimination policy
because the private developers will not have
broken any contract.
So, if there is r to be no discrimination on lands
owned but leased by I his University, anti-discrimi
nation clauses in the leasing contracts are defi
nitely necessary. Is it possible that this Univer
■ ity headed by practical men, has no intention
ol attempting to enforce an anti-discrimination
policy on its leased properties? Such a policy, if
enforced and supported by mandatory anti-dis
crimination clauses in the contracts with devel
oper would drastically reduce the financial value
ol these contracts. The University needs money.
The statement of the NAACP that "Stanford
i always open to all qualified students" was in
teresting. 1 have heard people wonder why there
were not more Negro students on campus. Some
of these people have suggested that the few
;\Y moos which they have seen on campus were
admitted in order to present an aura of non
discrimination, and that the feelings of the many
.Stanford students from the South might tend to
restrict the number of Negro admittances. Others
have suggested that Negroes are admitted only
if they are outstanding athletes in addition to
being good students. Stanford's "recent com
mendatory attitude toward discrimination" is not
evident enough to quiet many skeptics.

Assurance of Responsibility

Editor, The Daily:
As author of the amendment concerning the
approval the Daily editor, I feel that I should
be able to answer questions concerning the action
laken by the Legislature. One of the first ques
tions that is asked is this: Why did the Legis
lature feel some action must be taken? Since
r ! he Daily has not taken the time to interview
members of Legislature concerning this question,
J will answer it here. The answer is simple
tuilorit complaint. The Daily DOES belong to
fvieh and every Stanford student; yet some people
on campus, including the Daily editorial staff,
are not aware of this. Therefore the students
have a right to complain, and it is ihe duty of
the Legislature to take some action when the
Indents ask that something be done.
The next question usually asked is: Who com
pl lined, and what are their complaints? For
obvious reasons this question has not been fully
answered by the official source of Stanford news
on this campus. In a previous letter I answered
this question the first official and most impor
tant complaint came from the Daily business
; tatf. They told Legislature that $200 worth of
advertising was rejected weekly because the edi
tor al staff said there wasn't enough news to
print a six-page newspaper every day. The busi
ness staff was not satisfied with this answer,
bei, ause many organizations on this campus have
"t en refused news-column space in the newspaper
tor one reason or another. Among these organi
' tiions that complained was Ham's Head, which
finally was'forced to budget extra money to ad
vertise their productions because of a lack of
publicity in the student newspaper. The Ski Club,
with over 200 members, could not even get their
meetings publicized in The Daily. Student-Fac
ulty Committee and also students have com
plained about incorrect reporting, biased report
ing outside the editorial columns, etc. I feel, per
onally, that if dissatisfaction arises among the
Daily staff, and the staff cannot solve its own
problems, then it is time for Legislature to act
in the best interests of the students.
The Daily has .said that this is a plot by 22
students—the ASSU Legislature—to gain "con
trol" (whatever they mean by this wordi of The
Daily. This is not true and the accusation is
either intentional to confuse the issue or is based
on ignorance. If it is based on ignorance, then
the blame lies equally on the Legislature and
The Daily. The Daily is at fault for not doing its
duty to report the true facts as a good newspaper
hould. To see how biased and one-sided ihe
i porting has been, it is only necessary to re-read
most of the issues of last quarter. Legislature

erred in its method of presentation of the first
amendment to APPOINT (not to be confused
with approve) the Daily editor. The Daily was
not consulted, as it should have been, and as a
result tempers flared and The Daily cried "Rob
bery!" fearing a plot to take "their" Daily away
from them. This is partly Legislature's fault, but
it acted wisely by DEFEATING the amendment,
while The Daily never recovered and has been
yelling "Robbery!" ever since.
The third and important question is: Why the
present amendment, and what good will it do?
Although the first amendment was defeated, the
student complaints still existed, and ignoring the
complaints would have been a dereliction of Leg
islature's duty to the students. 1 felt that an
amendment to the Publications Board standing
rules was needed because, although the present
volume might take upon itsell to correct its mis
takes, what assurance would the students have
tiiat this misunderstanding of who owns the
paper |would notj arise again?
To provide for the future, 1 proposed the pres
ent amendment. I don't want to control The
Daily, nor want Legislature to do so. All I want
is the assurance of a newspaper that will satisfy
the readers and the owners, a newspaper that
believes in honest reporting of ALL the facts.
As I have said before, this amendment will show
future editors that they are responsible to the
students for a good newspaper. Legislature does
not want to control The Daily, because, if it did,
if would not have defeated the proposal to ap
point the Daily editor, and it would have removed
the Daily editor Hong ago under Article 111, Sec
tion 2 of the constitution, which gives it the power
to do so. So this amendment creates no new
power; it only says that if future editors continue
to ignore student complaints, then Ihe students
will exercise the light they have always had—to
have an editor that feels some moral responsi
bility to the students.
If you feel that ihe amendment will make The
Daily worse than before, then you should vote
YP3S 1o repeal the amendment. If you feel, as I
do, that it will help make a better newspaper,
then you will vote NO. If you are undecided,
I think that the right thing to do is to give the
amendment a chance to prove its worth. By
voting not to repeal this amendment you are
putting it on trial because you are under no
obligation not to ask for its repeal in the future.

We Must Tread Lightly

To the Daily Editor, Wallace Stegner and His
Fifteen Colleagues:
I would like to speak on behalf of the careful
generation and try to point out some of the rea
sons for our characteristic outlooks and biases.
As a member of this generation, I am, by defi
nition, a "company man" attending college "be
cause a degree increases earning power and en
hances social prestige." Also, since my feelings
have not so far been "treated with amazement
and apprehension" they must therefore be close
to those of the "majority or crowd." In short,
I am merely typical.
Being typical is, however, no sin, and why
should it not be as desired as being ruggedly
individual? To choose to be one or the other is
purely a subjective choice. Our parents and their
peers had to contend with the depression, where
rugged individualism was likely to pay off in a
meal or a decent bed or some desirable monetary
reward. Today, however, rugged individualism,
instead ol being rewarded, is more likely labeled
as neurotic and lands one in a mental institution.
Is a "Chamber of Commerce morality," consid
ered in this light, necessarily evil and unproduc
tive?
You should, instead, be pleased that we are
careful— which is a far cry from being mentally
inert with minds "quiet as mice." Our genera
tion may possibly help to pull thejworld from its
muddle of tensions. Far from being submissive
and indifterent, we are waiting- filled with emo
tion, a thousand ideas crossing our minds to see
what kind of world (i 1 any) our parents and their
peers will leave us to deal with
When our elders pass on their control and
knowledge ol the powers for world destruction,
we shall be even moie careful and cautious. If
we are not, then possibly the rest of the world
will "go boom" along with us. Small wonder we
haven't an ounce of political idealism within us.
We first want an experimentally successful work
ing model of political organization, then we may
again lilt our eyes to the true, the good and the
beautiful.
Mr. Stegner, we feel deeply and are enthusi
astic, but'in a quiet and growing way. Much as
a physicist handles carefully and respectfully
radioactive isotopes, do we have to handle ihe
future. You have given us ihe situation, and we
cannot condemn. We MUST tread lightly and
pray to Clod we are successful.
