# 1863 LOCOMOTIVE
## 'Governor Stanford' Engine First to Cross Sierra Nevada 
### Dick Frey 
One of the most eye-catching
exhibits at the Stanford Museum
is a brightly painted locomotive
bearing the name "Governor
Stanford" and the initials of the
Central Pacific Railroad.
The "Governor S t a n 112 or d ''
played a colorful part in the
early days of California railroad
ing, on the Central Pacific. The
locomotive was built in the shops
of Richard Norris and Sons of
Philadelphia and Lancaster, Pa.
It was hauled around Cape Horn
in the hold of the ship Herald of
the Morning which arrived in
San Francisco Aug. 19, 18(53.
The dismantled yet cumber
some locomotive was transferred
from the Herald of the Morning
to the schooner Artful Dodger
for the trip to Sacramento where
the railroad began. The Artful
Dodger arrived in Sacramento
on Oct. 7 with its valuable cargo.
The troublesome unloading proc
ess began again, and this time
the "Governor Stanford" was al
most lost in the river. Finally all
the parts were safely ashore and
Central Pacific mechanics began
the task of assembling the loco
motive.
Not tlie First
The Central Pacific project
was not the first railroad started
in California. The first line was
the Sacramento Valley Railroad
which joined Sacramento and
Folsom in February, 1856.
The plan for building a rail
road across the Sierras was origi
nated by Theodore Judah, an en
gineer who conducted numerous
surveys for his proposed railroad
long before he had any financial
backing for it. Judah finally at
tracted the attention of four fair
ly well-to-do storekeepers named
Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins,
Collis P. Huntington and Leland
Stanford. As a result of their de
cision to back the project, these
men eventually became million
aires and were known as "The
Big Four."
Construction work started on
Jan. 8, 18(53, in Sacramento at
the river levee. Notables made
speeches and Stanford energeti
cally lifted the first shovelful of
earth into a wagon, a feat which
caused a Sacramento reporter to
comment that Stanford's "mus
cles were in the right place."
.Ir>-Giin Salute
By the time the "Governor
Stanford" had been assembled,
the railroad had been constructed
nearly to Roseville, a distance of
18 miles. A 35-gun salute her
aided the "Governor Stanford's"
trial run ot) Nov. 9, 18(53, and
two days later the locomotive
waj â–  teamed up foi its first trip
along the line. Sacramento rele
brated again and city and state
dignitaries turned out lor the
big event. Sacramento newspa
pers reported that the locomotive
"went at far as 17th Street with
the Governor, chief engineer, and
business men as 'volunteer' pas
sengers."
The "Governor S t a n 112 or d "
pulled the first freight traffic
over the road the following year
and the Sacramento Union for
March 2(5, 1864, said that "the lo
comotive 'Governor Stanford' ar
rived at dusk last evening with
three carloads of granite, about
thirty tons, taken from Brig
ham's quarries on the line of the
acitic Railroad. ' Passenger serv
Pacific Railroad." Passenger
service to Roseville was started
a month later .Additional loco
motives and cars began to arrive
by ship from the East.
The "Governor Stanford" was
the first locomotive to cross the
Sierras when that part of the
line was completed.
On May 10, 1869, Stanford
drove the Last Spike at Promon
tory, Utah, to link the Central
Pacific with tin- Union Pacific

which had begun building west
ward from Omaha in l
lCngine "Retired"
After lengthy service on Ihe
line where ihe "Governor Stan
ford" operated between Sacra
merito and Ogden, railroad offi
cials decided in 1893 to scrap the
locomotive. However, Mrs. Stan
ford secured the locomotive for
exhibition at the Stanford Mu
seum. It was displayed at the
Midwinter Fair in San Francisco
in the same year before being
moved to Palo Alto.
After the fair the "Governor
Stanford" reached its apparent
final location in a wooden shed
constructed for it behind the Mu
seum. However, the shied was
abandoned in 1916 when the loco
motive was moved into the Mu
seum. A large hole was cut
through the brick and cement
wall of the building to effect the
move, and the "Governor Stan
ford" was jacked up and run into
position.
