### 
John Stahler's new Stanford frosh track record of 13-8 in the
pole vault and a record-shuttering performance in the mile relay
paced Coach Floyd Strain's Papooses to an easy win over City
College of San Francisco and West Contra Costa JC Saturday
morning on Angell Field.
The Indians tallied 95 points to 63 for CCSF and four for West
Contra Costa.
Stahler, the best vaulter at Stanford, frosh or varsity, com
pletely obliterated the school freshman record of 13- '•». set in 1950
by decathlon star Bob Mathias. Stahler had just missed the record
two weeks ago when he soared 13-0.
Norman Pease, Dick Lassen, Chuck McKenney and Bob Besse
combined their talents to register a 3:22.3 clocking in the mile
relay, seven-tenths better than the old frosh record of 3:23.0, es
tablished in 1951.

won the broad jump at 22-7, and ran second in the 100, 120 high
hurdles and 220 low hurdles. Pease's winning times for the 100
and 220 were 10.2 and 22.5, with both races run into a heavy
wind which hampered runners throughout the meet.
Besse nipped Jim Backstrand in the javelin at 1.89-6 to take a
2-1 lead over his teammate in the spear battle they have waged the
past three weeks. Royal Moor turned in the only other field event

place as they won the 440, 880 and mile respectively. McKenney
