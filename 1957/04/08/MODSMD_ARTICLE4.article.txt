arrangements and has charge of
the physical facilities of the
court. Tom Tweedy and Pat Kit
tier, Stanford law students, have

ICJ.
The seven cases to be tried be
fore the ICJ are:
• United Kingdom v. Hungary
on genocide.

ing Somaliland.
• Colombia v. Peru on the
right of asylum.
• United Kingdom v. Iran on

Each party in a trial will have
30 minutes for his initial argu

agreement of both parties. The
.judges will be free to question
the speakers at any lime.
The judges will render their
opinions at the time of the cases
but the majority and minority
opinions will not be written until
after the close of the ICJ and
they will,be read at the General
Assembly meeting Saturday.
