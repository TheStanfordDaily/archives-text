# 'TRAMPS AND PLAYBOYS'
## Grad Student Tells of Tour Of Europe in VW for $709.32 
### 
Graduate student Bernhard von Nicolai yesterday told of his 1955
summer when he and two University of Toledo companions "were
tramps and playboys" across Europe. Von Nicolai spoke in an Insti
tute of International Relations talk in Bowman Alumni House.
Tramping 842 miles of their 22,142-mile trip, the three friends

became split personalities â€”at
times living like gypsies," at
other times, like "princes," Von
Nicolai said. Their average ex
penses were "about $709.32."
"If you talk to people who've
gone over there you'll usually
find they've paid over $1000,"
said Von Nicolai, who is original
ly from Hamburg, Germany.
Expense Tips
Then the graduate gave a few
tips on how others may dupli
cate his inexpensive trip.
First of all, the trio saved
about 50 per cent on their air
line tickets by purchasing them
through the Co-operative Bureau
of Teachers, New York City,
which ostensibly is only for
teachers but actually accommo
dates others as well.
Travel in Europe was by a
three-year-old second-hand Volks
wagen. The three comrades
bought their car for $710 in Ham
burg and, on leaving Europe, re
sold it for just $90 less.
As for places to sleep, Von Ni
colai commented, "The best thing
to do is stay away from places
frequented by tourists."
He and his Iwo friends did this
by staying in YMCA's, youth
hostels, cheap hotels and beaches.
Merry-Go-Round
Weather didn't plague the
three Americans in their moonlit
nights on European beaches,
with the exception of one night.
On that occasion rain drove
them from their French Riviera
beach to the shelter of a nearby
merry-go-round.
Unfortunately, the trio over
slept the next morning and
awakened to find "people step
ping around us" and "kids look
ing at us."
Von Nicolai urged travelers to
visit the homes of their foreign
student friends. "It helps in in
ternational relations," ho said.
He also remarked that it was
cheap.
