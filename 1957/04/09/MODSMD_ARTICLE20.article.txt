# Russ Nuclear Test Marks Proposal For Disarmament
## 
### 
LONDON, April 8 (UP)—The
United States proposed a new
step toward world disarmament
today. Almost simultaneously it
was disclosed that Russia has
exploded another nuclear test
weapon.
U.S. Delegate Harold Stassen,
addressing representatives of the
Soviet Union, Britain, France and
Canada at the four-week-old dis
armament talks in London, pro
posed a conditional program that
would mothball a total of 25 per
cent of the conventional, non
nuclear arms of the major pow
ers under United Nations super
vision.
The condition was that the five
powers at the conference first
agree to put 10 per cent of their
conventional arms in "disarma
ment depots" under UN guard
and trim their military manpow
er to 2V2 million men apiece for
Russia and the U.S. and 750,000
each for Britain and France. If
successful, the program would
then be expanded to include an
other 15 per cent of non-nuclear
weapons.
Soviet Delegate Valerian Zorin
welcomed the proposal and said
Russia would study it carefully.
While the meeting was in prog
ress, both the U.S. and Britain
revealed that the Russians ex
ploded another nuclear weapon
on April 6—its second such test
blast in three days.
The apparently intensive So
viet test series bore out Iron Cur
tain dispatches that the Soviet
Union, while demanding nuclear
test bans, was speeding up its
own atomic and hydrogen weap
ons programs.
