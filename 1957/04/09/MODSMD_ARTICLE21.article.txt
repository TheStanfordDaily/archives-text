# Dulles Urges Over 4 Billion In Foreign Aid
## Asks for Loans, Not Grants, as Economic Aid for Coming Year 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 8 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles urged Congress today to
put foreign aid on a long-haul
basis by transferring direct mili
tary assistance to the defense
budget and setting up a loan pro
gram for economic aid.
Dulles, who testified before a
special Senate Foreign Aid Com
mittee, also made a vigorous de
fense of President Eisenhower's
new $4,400,000,000 aid program.
Committee members have said
the program will face "real
trouble" unless Eisenhower takes
a strong stand against economy
cuts.
Long-Term Program
Dulles refused to pred'r* '-'V-,.-
the overall aid nm
ha^ed
believe it's end'e:s lie oa'd ,
proposals would give the t
gram a "long-term" characc
and end the present "scandalous
ly inefficient way of doing
things."
He said so-called "defense sup
port" funds — indirect military
aid—should be authorized on a
continuing basis, with Congress
putting up the money each year
just as it does for other continu
ing programs.
He said the proposed revolving
fund for economic assistance
"might come to reach $750 mil
lion a year." He conceded the
Treasury would have to replen
ish the fund each year but said
"it may be self-sustaining in the
long run."
The Secretary made clear he
was not suggesting that the
changes be adopted in the com
ing fiscal year. Thus, they would
not affect the program which the
President is expected to submit
to Congress later this month.
Knowland Unconvinced
Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland (Calif.) told
reporters he felt Congress "has
shown a • favorable attitude to
ward getting the aid program on
a loan rather than a grant basis."
But he said he still favored cut
ting about one billion dollars
from next year's program.
