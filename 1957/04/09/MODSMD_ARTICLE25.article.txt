All Election Philosophy
Editor, The Daily:
The coming ASSU election has already brought
forth the usual crop of campaign posters, pathetic
in their attempts at marginal originality. I wel
' < me these posters, for they make interesting
reading in otherwise idle moments. I anticipate
another phenomenon, however, which I find more
annoying. This is a certain attitude which is
sometimes expressed by candidates, but more
often by authors of editorials in student publi
cations. It is the tendency to regard voting in
these elections as being, in some sense, a duty,
ft is assumed by those who are connected with
tud-nt government that a student who has voted
i by virtue of that act, a more intelligent and
alert student than one who has ignored the polls.
is suggested that, besides having demonstrated
h' sense of responsibility toward the general
welfare, the voting student is even keeping the
campus safe for democracy and upholding tradi
tions of representative government, American
life and God knows what else.
Actually this obligatory nature of voting is
entirely mythical. We are told that student gov
ernment performs tasks necessary for various
student-functions. But this does not imply that
it is important to everyone on campus just who
carries out these tasks. We do not care which
Kinitors clean the rooms of the inner quad, but
or ?ome strange reason we are expected to care
who performs the myriad little jobs which pre
sumably occupy the time of the elected officials.
We are expected to vote as if the outcome of the
cl?ction would matter to us after the victors had

assumed office, when in fact it is impossible to
detect a difference between the reign of one set
of officials and that of their successors. This
uniformity was not even upset after the flam
boyant campaign of a couple of years ago; the
subseqeunt regime was exactly like the others
as far as the man in the arcade was concerned.
This uniformity demonstrates the invalidity of
the analogy which is sometimes made between
student government and national government.
There is a similarity in form, but not in function;
hence there is not an analogous obligation to
participate in elections. I am aware that there
have been campuses and that there have been
times where and when there have been important
issues which concerned all students. But Stan
ford is not such a campus and this spring is not
such a time. I sympathize with those candidates
who have tried desperately to find issues which
would appear significant. But ihey are fighting
a hopeless battle; their swords are waving brave
ly in the empty air.
When the cry of "Apathy!" is thrown about,
as I suppose it must be, it should not be assumed
that apathy is cancerous growth which spreads
insidiously to affect everything. 'What is called
apathy is often simply a refusal to generate a
false interest false because it is not justified by
the actual situation. Last week one of the class
newspapers carried an editorial trying to get out
the vote. I would like to see an end to this sheep's
attitude toward elections this feeling of obliga
tion to produce a false response.
But there is one group on campus which is
legitimately concerned with the outcome of the
elections. This is the group of candidates, who
take a natural interest in having congenial com
patriots join them in victory. Let these people
who have a genuine desire to vote—vote. But
don't attempt to persuade everyone else that they
should also have this desire.

Editor, The Daily:
The coming ASSU election has already brought
forth the usual crop of campaign posters, pathetic
in their attempts at marginal originality. I wel
' < me these posters, for they make interesting
reading in otherwise idle moments. I anticipate
another phenomenon, however, which I find more
annoying. This is a certain attitude which is
sometimes expressed by candidates, but more
often by authors of editorials in student publi
cations. It is the tendency to regard voting in
these elections as being, in some sense, a duty,
ft is assumed by those who are connected with
tud-nt government that a student who has voted
i by virtue of that act, a more intelligent and
alert student than one who has ignored the polls.
is suggested that, besides having demonstrated
h' sense of responsibility toward the general
welfare, the voting student is even keeping the
campus safe for democracy and upholding tradi
tions of representative government, American
life and God knows what else.
Actually this obligatory nature of voting is
entirely mythical. We are told that student gov
ernment performs tasks necessary for various
student-functions. But this does not imply that
it is important to everyone on campus just who
carries out these tasks. We do not care which
Kinitors clean the rooms of the inner quad, but
or ?ome strange reason we are expected to care
who performs the myriad little jobs which pre
sumably occupy the time of the elected officials.
We are expected to vote as if the outcome of the
cl?ction would matter to us after the victors had

assumed office, when in fact it is impossible to
detect a difference between the reign of one set
of officials and that of their successors. This
uniformity was not even upset after the flam
boyant campaign of a couple of years ago; the
subseqeunt regime was exactly like the others
as far as the man in the arcade was concerned.
This uniformity demonstrates the invalidity of
the analogy which is sometimes made between
student government and national government.
There is a similarity in form, but not in function;
hence there is not an analogous obligation to
participate in elections. I am aware that there
have been campuses and that there have been
times where and when there have been important
issues which concerned all students. But Stan
ford is not such a campus and this spring is not
such a time. I sympathize with those candidates
who have tried desperately to find issues which
would appear significant. But ihey are fighting
a hopeless battle; their swords are waving brave
ly in the empty air.
When the cry of "Apathy!" is thrown about,
as I suppose it must be, it should not be assumed
that apathy is cancerous growth which spreads
insidiously to affect everything. 'What is called
apathy is often simply a refusal to generate a
false interest false because it is not justified by
the actual situation. Last week one of the class
newspapers carried an editorial trying to get out
the vote. I would like to see an end to this sheep's
attitude toward elections this feeling of obliga
tion to produce a false response.
But there is one group on campus which is
legitimately concerned with the outcome of the
elections. This is the group of candidates, who
take a natural interest in having congenial com
patriots join them in victory. Let these people
who have a genuine desire to vote—vote. But
don't attempt to persuade everyone else that they
should also have this desire.
