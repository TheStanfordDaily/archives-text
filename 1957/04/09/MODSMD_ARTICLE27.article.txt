# ON OTHER CAMPUSES
## Cal Presidents Give Cow a Bad Time 
### Dave Canfield 
Spring ignited the nation's college campuses
with bursts of bizarre enthusiasm last week as
activities ranged from cow milking contests and
exposes of shingle mills to assiduous cheating.
In a publicity stunt to advertise the Cal Aggie
picnic day this Saturday, California student body
president Jim Kidder and Davis prexy John
Hardie staged a cow milking contest last week
at the Berkeley campus's Sather Gate.
As the Daily California!! put it, "With buckets
in place Kidder and Hardie each grasped two
handles.
"Success arrived slowly. The two presidents,
it seems, had not had time for much practice
prior to the contest. The looks they received
from the cow could attest to the fact.
". . . Kidder, on the point of exhaustion, was
revived by the sudden appearance of the Straw
Hat band.
"To the Tune of 'Palms of Victory' the milk
began to flow."
The winner of the contest? Hardie of Davis
by a landslide—3.2 to 1.3 pounds of milk.

ert G. Wells is aiding in a crackdown on "Com
monwealth University," a Los Angeles office
that dispenses fake bachelors', masters' and
Ph.D. degrees—for a price.
Wells, former Daily Trojan city editor and
now telegraph editor of the Long Beach Inde
pendent-Press Telegram, bought a $200 Ph.D.
degree from "Commonwealth U" last January.
With his "Ph.D." as exhibit A and the fact that

he has not yet received his A.B. from Southern
Cal as exhibit B, Wells is co-operating with
Deputy Attorney General Jim Loubel to break
up the single mill.
11 charges are proved against "Commonwealth
U," its owner would be guilty of felony and
could receive imprisonment or a $1000 to $3000
fine, or both.
Wells, in evaluating the unscrupulousness of
the establishment, said a quack with a phony
diploma could treat people with anything from
mental disorders to cancer.
He will testify in Sacramento soon for a pro
posed bill certifying psychologists. This bill
would, he said, eliminate quackery.

In a study of dishonesty in school, a recent
nation-wide survey reported lhat 40 per cent or

apology or sense of wrong-doing.
At least one college journalist made no at

"This is news?" asked Dakota Student col
umnist Chuck Sakariassen at the University of

Sakariassen has no apology for cheating: ". . .

"This is news?" asked Dakota Student col
umnist Chuck Sakariassen at the University of
North Dakota. "I thought it was a known, ac
cepted fact!"
Sakariassen has no apology for cheating: ". . .
I sure wouldn't feel guilty glancing at the next
guy's paper to find out who Henry VIII's third
concubine from the left was if i! meant the
difference between a B or a C."
Sakariassen concluded by saying he would go
along with W. C. Fields, who said, "Whatever's
worth having is worth cheating for."
Spring ignited the nation's college campuses
with bursts of bizarre enthusiasm last week as
activities ranged from cow milking contests and
exposes of shingle mills to assiduous cheating.
In a publicity stunt to advertise the Cal Aggie
picnic day this Saturday, California student body
president Jim Kidder and Davis prexy John
Hardie staged a cow milking contest last week
at the Berkeley campus's Sather Gate.
As the Daily California!! put it, "With buckets
in place Kidder and Hardie each grasped two
handles.
"Success arrived slowly. The two presidents,
it seems, had not had time for much practice
prior to the contest. The looks they received
from the cow could attest to the fact.
". . . Kidder, on the point of exhaustion, was
revived by the sudden appearance of the Straw
Hat band.
"To the Tune of 'Palms of Victory' the milk
began to flow."
The winner of the contest? Hardie of Davis
by a landslide—3.2 to 1.3 pounds of milk.

University of Southern California student Rob
ert G. Wells is aiding in a crackdown on "Com
monwealth University," a Los Angeles office
that dispenses fake bachelors', masters' and
Ph.D. degrees—for a price.
Wells, former Daily Trojan city editor and
now telegraph editor of the Long Beach Inde
pendent-Press Telegram, bought a $200 Ph.D.
degree from "Commonwealth U" last January.
With his "Ph.D." as exhibit A and the fact that

he has not yet received his A.B. from Southern
Cal as exhibit B, Wells is co-operating with
Deputy Attorney General Jim Loubel to break
up the single mill.
11 charges are proved against "Commonwealth
U," its owner would be guilty of felony and
could receive imprisonment or a $1000 to $3000
fine, or both.
Wells, in evaluating the unscrupulousness of
the establishment, said a quack with a phony
diploma could treat people with anything from
mental disorders to cancer.
He will testify in Sacramento soon for a pro
posed bill certifying psychologists. This bill
would, he said, eliminate quackery.
