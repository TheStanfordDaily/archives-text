# FACULTY, STUDENT GROUPS
## Chief Tells Why SU Police Differ From Municipal Force 
### Dave Canfield 
"We've got two groups of people here—a faculty group and a
student group. Each thinks the other has the advantage."
That was how Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis expressed one
of the problems that make the University's police force different
from that of a municipal law enforcement agency.

Not only do students and fac
ulty each think the other group
has more space in which to park
its cars, Davis said, but traffic
violators have less respect for a
ticket issued by the Stanford po
lice than they would for one
handed out by the Palo Alto po
lice.
"As Much Congestion"
"Why they think it's different
I don't know," Davis said. "We
have just as much traffic conges
tion here, and maybe more, than
they have in many municipal
communities." Davis has been
on the force for 27 years.
Traffic is indeed the Police De
partment's big problem and it
keeps 12 officers, three Cars and
two motorcycles in action seven
days a week, 24 hours a day,
Davis said.
Each officer works a five-day
week and the office, in the Cor
poration Yard, is open from 8
a.m. 1o 5 p.m., Monday through
Saturday. At least one radio
equipped car is patrolling the
campus at all times.
To C all on Sunday
To call the police on Sundays
or at night, Davis said students
may phone the Palo Alto Police
Department, which will contact
Stanford's officer on duty.
"We have a continuous radio
communication between our offi
cers and the transmitter for this
district, which is in Palo Alto,"
Davis said.
The chief, who has held his
post since 1941, said the Stanford
Police Department itself does not
have a radio transmitter. Rules
of the Federal Communications
Commission require a transmit
ter to bo operated seven days a
week, 24 hours a day, and the
University police department is
not large enough to warrant hir
ing a full-time operator.
Enforced Since 1928
Campus law was enforced by
highway patrolmen until 1928,
Davis said. The authority under
which the University in 1928
hired its first uniformed police
man is section 603 of the Califor
nia Vehicle Code, which gives
any educational institution the
power to set up "anything
thought necessary for the safety
of its students."
Davis said student safety has
been well maintained over 1 the
years. The only campus murder
the chief could remember oc
curred in 1933 when a University
employee was charged with kill
ing his wife.
Students Otherwise Co-operate
As well as refraining from
blowing each other's brains out,
students have otherwise co-opcr
ated well with the Police Depart
ment, Davis said.
"We find," he remarked, "that
the students, if they're wrong,
are usually willing to accept the
penalties and let it go at that."
Probably the only students
who give Davis trouble are "peo
ple wanting to drive their cars
for just two or three blocks, just
as, in my youth, I wanted to ride
my bike that far."

are usually willing to accept the
penalties and let it go at that."
Probably the only students
who give Davis trouble are "peo
ple wanting to drive their cars
for just two or three blocks, just
as, in my youth, I wanted to ride
my bike that far."
"We've got two groups of people here—a faculty group and a
student group. Each thinks the other has the advantage."
That was how Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis expressed one
of the problems that make the University's police force different
from that of a municipal law enforcement agency.

Not only do students and fac
ulty each think the other group
has more space in which to park
its cars, Davis said, but traffic
violators have less respect for a
ticket issued by the Stanford po
lice than they would for one
handed out by the Palo Alto po
lice.
"As Much Congestion"
"Why they think it's different
I don't know," Davis said. "We
have just as much traffic conges
tion here, and maybe more, than
they have in many municipal
communities." Davis has been
on the force for 27 years.
Traffic is indeed the Police De
partment's big problem and it
keeps 12 officers, three Cars and
two motorcycles in action seven
days a week, 24 hours a day,
Davis said.
Each officer works a five-day
week and the office, in the Cor
poration Yard, is open from 8
a.m. 1o 5 p.m., Monday through
Saturday. At least one radio
equipped car is patrolling the
campus at all times.
To C all on Sunday
To call the police on Sundays
or at night, Davis said students
may phone the Palo Alto Police
Department, which will contact
Stanford's officer on duty.
"We have a continuous radio
communication between our offi
cers and the transmitter for this
district, which is in Palo Alto,"
Davis said.
The chief, who has held his
post since 1941, said the Stanford
Police Department itself does not
have a radio transmitter. Rules
of the Federal Communications
Commission require a transmit
ter to bo operated seven days a
week, 24 hours a day, and the
University police department is
not large enough to warrant hir
ing a full-time operator.
Enforced Since 1928
Campus law was enforced by
highway patrolmen until 1928,
Davis said. The authority under
which the University in 1928
hired its first uniformed police
man is section 603 of the Califor
nia Vehicle Code, which gives
any educational institution the
power to set up "anything
thought necessary for the safety
of its students."
Davis said student safety has
been well maintained over 1 the
years. The only campus murder
the chief could remember oc
curred in 1933 when a University
employee was charged with kill
ing his wife.
Students Otherwise Co-operate
As well as refraining from
blowing each other's brains out,
students have otherwise co-opcr
ated well with the Police Depart
ment, Davis said.
"We find," he remarked, "that
the students, if they're wrong,
are usually willing to accept the
penalties and let it go at that."
Probably the only students
