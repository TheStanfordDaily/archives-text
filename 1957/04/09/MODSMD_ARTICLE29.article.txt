# Construction Starts on New Lab Building
## Completion of 2 New Electronics Structures Expected by Autumn 
### 
Construction is beginning this
month on another 20,000 square
feet of laboratory space for Stan
ford's mushrooming Science
Quad.
Bids have been requested for
two structures: a .$120,000 addi
tion to the Gilfillan Wing of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratory,
and a new $236,000 Applied Elec
tronics Laboratory.
Completion of both is expected
next autumn. The architects are
Spencer and Ambrose of San
Franciscb.
8500 Square Feet
The Gilfillan addition will con
tain about 8500 square feet. Like
the existing wing built in 1955, it
will be financed by gifts from
Gilfillan Brothers Inc., of Los
Angeles.
The Applied Electronics Labo
ratory will be located between
the Electronics and Geophysics
laboratories. Containing over 12,-
000 square feet, it will be used
primarily for government - spon
sored research. Its cost will be
repaid from proceeds of research
contracts.
The new structures will vastly
relieve overcrowded conditions
caused by a steadily expanding
research program in electronics.
It will also release space needed
for expansion of work in Aero
nautical Engineering.
Future I'luns
Since construction of the first
Science Quad building in 1948,
seven buildings with over 140,000
square feet of space have been
created there. University plan
ners foresee an eventual expan
sion to 14 buildings containing a
total of 420,000 square feet.
Cur rent construction will
match the present buff-colored
concrete structures of the Sci
ence Quad. A landscaped court
yard is planned between the new
and the existing electronics la bo
ratories.
