With spring football practice impending, Los Angeles sports writ
er.; are again directing their verbal bazookas, cannons, machineguns,
German lugers, zip guns and water pistols toward "Halo" Alto.
This water pistol barrage came recently from the pen of Daily
1 1 • 'an columnist Joe Jares\ who dug 60-odd years back in history
or his ammunition:
"Everyone knows, of course, that Stanford University is a pure
.-hool: West Point-type honor code, no off-the-cuff aid to athletes
•nd that soi l of commendable activity.
"Well, I found out in Dr. Cutter's California Governmen [sic]
(lass Ihe other day a fact, that maybe everyone doesn't know. That
Stanford was founded by a shady railroad magante. It seems that
I iikl Stanford, Huntington Crocker and Top of the Mark Hop
kins controlled I Ik* Southern Pacific Railroad, which in turn coil
trolled California politics in a manner not at all commendable.
"Leland must not have heard about the honor code because my
textbook hints that he gave some off-the-cuff aid to some assembly
men. But Stanford U's holy reputation will remain inlaet . . ."
As well as Leland Stanford, other figures came in for journal
ists chastisement during the past word-filled week. This vociferous
bla . against track coaches was delivered by Maxwell Stiles, veteran
Lo.- Angeles Mirror News track writer:
"This column is in favor of rounding up all the college and club
lack coaches, together wilh their publicity men and equipment
nanagers, and putting them aboard a slow raft to China with a
ne way wind behind them."
Stiles' rage was caused hy the fact that track uniforms do not
have numbers on them.
(.'al Has Bowden and King; Cards Have Hope and Jordan; But
he South Has Ihe Power."
This was the way Daily Californian writer Bob Steiner has sized
|j the Pacific Coast Conference track picture. Steiner said even
"oach Payton Jordan's savvy could not compensate for Stanford's
/eakness in the sprints and mile run, among other events.
Southern California pole vaulter Ron Morris served notice re
ently that he will probably vault away with his event in Saturday's
it;",lium SC-SU meet. Morris cleared ihe bar at 10-'/o for a new
chool record.
A Trojan freshman —Doug Davis —recently shattered the na
tional frosh shot put record with a heave of 56-2. Davis broke the
old mark by more than two feet.
Elsewhere on the record-shattering scene, UCLA's two-miler Bob
Vaman broke school and meet records recently against Santa Bar
ara and Cal Poly with a time of 9:11.2. In the same meet, basket
aP star Walt Torrence came within a hair of the school mark of
8-1 in the high jump.
Santa Clara's freshman baseball team, which the Papooses battle
'riday on the Freshman Diamond, has a strong group of hitters and
ecently blasted the San Jose State yearlings, 14-4. Pitching is also
trong, with strike-out artists Mike Higgins and Dick Creighton
•lazing them in.
While the freshman diamond men are up against the young
hones, Ihe varsity golfers will face their toughest test of the season.
)n the Stanford golf course at 1 p.m. Saturday, the linksters go
gainst Southern Cal.
The Trojans are undefeated in six matches this year and are
led hy Bob McCallister, Boh Howe, Bud Bradley, Ron Pawlecyk,
Frank Stuhhs and Keith Lopp. It is not yet known whether avid
Troy golf fans Jon Arnett and Danny Rogers will travel north
for the match. . . .
Also in for a tough fight in the upcoming action-packed weekend
it. Coach Bob Renker's varsity tennis players, who meet Cal Satur
lay in Berkeley.
Though comparative scores favor ihe Indians, the Bears boast a
pirited improving nucleus for strength in Lorin Dennison, Don
Mmley, Gulden Lloyd and Don Stensaas. Stensaas, who has a build
ike Bill Tilden and a serve that could be fierce, has yet to reach his
»eak.
Other Becks than Dave are in hot water up in Washington, ac
•ou.'ing to Tom Tiede of the WSC Daily Evergreen. WSC's ex-great
.airy Beck dipped his tootsies into hot H,O recently when it was
ear ned he and two other Westside Ford AAU cage members were
nit of districts. The trio's ineligibility caused the Ford five to for
eit a game in the National AAU tourney. But the rules committee
net again, decided Beck was eligible, though his two buddies
veren't, and the game was replayed.
With Leaping Larry hitting 27 points, Westside beat its foe fa
c; .i from Cedar Rapids, Iowa) by 13 tallies.
