# Thinclads Prep For SC Titanic Slated Saturday
## Gilbert Is SC Key; Sprints, Sticks May Play Important Role 
### Dick Barnes 
Editor's note: This is the first
of a three-part article analyz
ing the various events in Satur- !
day's Stanford - Southern Cali- I
fornia track meet in Stanford
Stadium. Today, sprints and
hurdles. Tomorrow, middle dis
tance and long distance. Tlmrs- 1
day, field events.
Stanford's principal weakness
in running events, according loj
most observers, is in the sprints.
Just how well Pay ton .Jordan's
men can keep Southern California
from capitalizing on this supposed
weak spot is almost sure to he
key as to whether or not the In-1
dians can upset the men from
Troy in their titanic battle Satur-!
day afternoon.
The big question mark in the i
dashes appears to be the eondi-!
tion of Larry Gilbert, the No. 1 ;
USC sprint er. Last weekend
against Occidental, Gilbert could
get only third place in a race won
in exactly 10. Then in the 220
Gilbert failed to place.
There's no doubt that he has
abilityâ€”he has run 9.8 and 20.81
already this season. Neither of I
these tim 3 is exceptional, but j
they are as good or better than j
anything Stanford has done this i
year.
Herrmann Tops
No. 1 man for ihe Tribe in both
dashes broad-jumper Fra n k
Herrmann. He, like Gilbert, has
a 9.8 to his credit; but it must be |
added that Herrmann had the ad-:
vantage of an eight-mile-per-hour |
tail wind. He has also recorded I
a 20.9 with the wind.
Another Indian who ran 20.9 in
the same race is Chuck Ince. A
third man. Jim Easter, is almost i
up with Herrmann and Ince on a
basis of his 21.0.
With these three men in the 220.
Stanford hopes look good for at
least a second and a third. USC
has no one of top caliber to back !
up Gilbert, ihe best available be-1
ing C. R. Roberts and Carl Peter- I
son, each of whom has run 22.0.
Back in the 100, the fight for
Ihe third-place point behind Gil
bert and Herrmann will be tight
among the remaining four run
ners. Roberts and Peterson are
again the two Trojan hopes on a
basis of their 10.1 and 10.2, re
spectively. Coach Jordan proba
bly will go with Ren Anixter. 10.0,
and Leonard Bates. 10.2.
A big opportunity for Stanford
to pick up valuable points will
come in both hurdle races. And
the key to the Tribe's fortunes
lies first of all in the hands of
Chuck Cobb and then also in the
hands of Bernie Nelson, Hob New
man and Bates.
Lawson Favored
Things will probably be tight
est in the 120 highs. USC's Bob
Lawson has the best time of ihe
entrants, 14.3, but Cobb is the
most consistent of the lot with
his string of 14.1'5. Nelson could
also beat out Lawson as lie did
last year in winning the PCC title.
Nelson's best this year is 14.5.
The second, and probably only
other, USC entrant is Hank Ket
als, a 14.G runner. Stanford's
Newman will he tin* fifth man in
the race, and, while his best is
ir>.l, the highs are always unpre
dictable enough that he could get
up for a third.
Cobb, only a junior, must rank
as the logical favorile in the lows.
He has the best mark of the lot
23.1 and has looked sharp all
year. Lawson may he close, but
will be pressed hard by Bates,
Jordan's rapidly improving bar
rier man.
As regards the sprint and hur
dles. then, the big questions are:
What sort of condition is Larry
Gilbert In? Can Chuck Cobb score
a double for Stanford? Of almost
equal importance are the proh
lems of how the seconds and the
thirds places that win meet:-
Hie going to be distributed.
