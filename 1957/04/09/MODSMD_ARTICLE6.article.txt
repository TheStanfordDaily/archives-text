### 
KELON, Israel, April 8 (UP) —
Israel tonight agreed to a United
Nations proposal for a 42 - mile
barbed wire fence as protection
along the Gaza Strip border.
Egypt was reported equally will
ing.
United Nations Emergency
Force Commander Maj. Gen. E.
L. M. Burns of Canada urged the
erection of the barricade during
a 40-minute meeting with Israeli
Acting Chief of Staff Brigadier
Meir Amit at this Mediterranean
coastal town north of the 30-mile
long strip.
Burns said he had discussed
with the Egyptians the possibil
ity of a fence that would follow
the hills and curves of the bor
der and"I believe they'll agree."
Accepts Immediately
Israel accepted the idea imme
diately. Amit said he also
thought Egypt would agree to
the fence.
Both Israel and Egypt have ac
cused each other of new raids
across the border.
(Israel told the UN in New
York today there have been 19
Arab border violations since
March 13.
(The Egyptian administration
in Gaza accused Israeli patrols of
border raids on Saturday and
aagin today in which two Arab
farmers were kidnaped.
$80 Thousand Cost
UN officials estimated the
fence would cost $80 thousand
with "labor, materials and mon
ey to be supplied by the old
firm"—meaning the United Na
tions.
The fence was the only appar
ent area of agreement between
Israel and Egypt.
Today, as the Suez Canal was
cleared of its final obstructions,
Israeli officials reiterated their
announced determination to send
a test ship into the waterway on
the assumption that any attempt
to stop it would be considered an
"act of war."
