# Israel Demands Right of Passage As Canal Opens
## 
### 
CAIRO, ApriJ 8 (UP) â€” The
Suez Canal was cleared of its last
obstruction today.
Egypt, swinging into a full de
fense alert, was preparing to re
open the waterway to large ship
ping for the first time in five
months on its own terms. Israel
renewed demands that it be
granted right of passage, regard
less of the Egyptian boycott.
Unconfirmed reports swept
Cairo that reservists soon would
be called up. Air raid drills were
held during the weekend at Cai
ro, Alexandria and Suez Canal
towns.
"Act of War"
(In Jerusalem, officials again
vowed that Israel would sail a
ship through the canal in defi
ance of Egypt's boycott. The
Egyptian weekly newspaper Akh
bar Elyom was quoted in Jerusa
lem as saying "Any Israel ship
attempting the Tiran (Gulf of
Aqaba) or Suez passage will be
destroyed on the spot. Israel of
ficials have said such action
would be considered an "act of
war.")
The arrival of the American oil
tanker Kern Hills at the Israeli
port of Eilat at the end of the
Gulf of Aqaba with 16,500 tons of
oil for Israel stirred Arab anger.
U.S. Charges Made
Ihe weekly French - language
Cairo paper La Bourse Egyp
tienne said the United States
government had knowledge of
the oil shipment, "thus engaging
in policies whose consequences
can be easily predicted."
However, sources said there
was no indication Egypt was
planning to demand withdrawal
of United Nations occupation
troops from Sharm El Sheikh,
the coastal defense region of the
mouth of thn gulf which Egypt
used prior to the Israeli invasion
of last October to bottle up the
gulf.
Emphasis in Cairo was on the
canal. Egypt has failed to pub
lish the final details of its plan
for operating thp canal, but there
was no doubt final terms would
be Egypt's alone.
