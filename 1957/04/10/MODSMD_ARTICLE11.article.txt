## 
### 
Interfraternity Council unani
mously passed a resolution Mon
day night that Stanford frater
nities "neither endorse nor - con
done" racial restrictions on fra
ternity membership.
The statement reads: "The fra
ternities of Stanford University

nither endorse nor condone reli
gious or racial restrictions placed
upon membership, aird each Stan
ford chapter, having such restric
tions, will do its utmost to re
move them from its charter of
membership in the national fra
ternity. Such discriminatory re
strictions are contrary to the
ideals of the University, the fra
ternity system and the fraternity
men at Stanford."
Of the 24 fraternities at Stan
ford. this statement will affect
only 13, those which still have
restrictive clauses in the national
fraternity membership charters.
Spoke Wilson, Phi Psi, presi
dent of IFC, gave two reasons
for the action.
"First," he said, "this is some
thing official that will help the
individual house at Stanford
stand up to its national frater
nity if the national attempts to
interfere with its pledging."
"Second," he said, "it brings
the fraternities in line officially
with the University policy on
discrimination."
"Although we have been in
agreement unofficially with the
University policy, this officially

puts us in concordance with it,"
Wilson said.
In the past when one house
chose to pledge in disregard of
its national clause, it had to stand
alone. "But now," he said, it will
have the backing of all the
houses at Stanford."
