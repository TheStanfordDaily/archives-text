# SU, Cal Ruggers Clash Here Today For Mythical Title
## 
### 
Editor's note: The Stanford
rugby team is undefeated. This
afternoon, in their final home
appearance, they go against a
strong California team. Experts
have talihcd this year's team as
one of the greatest, if not the
greatest, rugby teams in Stan
ford history. The team deserves
appreciation. No reward could
be more satisfying than student
body support.
California and Stanford meet
on tho Indian rugby field at 4
p.m. today to determine the un
official California rugby cham
pionship. The Indians have not
beaten Cal since 1953.
Actually, if amounts to much
more (or less) than that. It's Cal
and Stanford. It's the "Big Game"
of rugby.
The records of both teams are
good. Stanford has won six and
remains undefeated. California
lias a fi-2-l mark. Their respec
tive successes against top-flight
eastern competition indicate that
the winner of today's contest may
be the best collegiate rugby team
in the nation.

Until last weekend California
was a self proclaimed contender
for an unofficial national chain
pi o us hi p. Impressive victories
over UCLA, the Olympic Club,
MIT. Yale and Hie University ol
British Columbia supported their
belief.
Bui last Saturday I lie Bears re
turned from the Northwest lick
ing wounds suffered in a double
defeat at the hands of the Cana
dians, 9-3 and 16-3.
California's squad includes a
strong group of rugby veterans.
Headlincr for the Bears is Pat
Vincent, a New Zealand All Black
star, who plays scrum half for
Coach Miles Hudson's squad.
< ommon Opponents
The two clubs have played sev
era I common opponents, although
analysis by comparative scores is
relatively useless because of vary
ing degrees of development when
these teams were met.
Stanford's most recent victory
wast last Saturday's 11-6 triumph
over UCLA. Cal beat UCLA, 14-0,
in Berkeley. California beat the
Olympic Club, 12-3, while the In
dians clobbered them twice, 25 0
and 27-11.
Kmetovic's Indians opened the
season with potentially the best
squad in many seasons. Injuries
depleted the squad early in the
going, and then final examina
tions and the quarter break re
tarded development oven further.
After struggling to beat a me
diocre MIT club, 18-9, two weeks
ago, ihey indicated that they were
back in form with Saturday's win
over UCLA.
The Indian scrum has been mas
ter of every game, especially in
the second half. However, backs
A 1 Kirkl'and, Jack Taylor and Rick
McMillen have been equally im
portant.
Kirkland's punting'from the
fullback position has kept oppo
nenls continually at bay, and,
more important, lie has ably taken
over the goal-kicking chores aban
doned by injured l)rtug Dick.

Bui last Saturday I lie Bears re
turned from the Northwest lick
ing wounds suffered in a double
defeat at the hands of the Cana
dians, 9-3 and 16-3.
California's squad includes a
strong group of rugby veterans.
Headlincr for the Bears is Pat
Vincent, a New Zealand All Black
star, who plays scrum half for
Coach Miles Hudson's squad.

The two clubs have played sev
era I common opponents, although
analysis by comparative scores is
relatively useless because of vary
ing degrees of development when
these teams were met.
Stanford's most recent victory
wast last Saturday's 11-6 triumph
over UCLA. Cal beat UCLA, 14-0,
in Berkeley. California beat the
Olympic Club, 12-3, while the In
dians clobbered them twice, 25 0
and 27-11.
Kmetovic's Indians opened the
season with potentially the best
squad in many seasons. Injuries
depleted the squad early in the
going, and then final examina
tions and the quarter break re
tarded development oven further.
After struggling to beat a me
diocre MIT club, 18-9, two weeks
ago, ihey indicated that they were
back in form with Saturday's win
over UCLA.
The Indian scrum has been mas
ter of every game, especially in
the second half. However, backs
A 1 Kirkl'and, Jack Taylor and Rick
McMillen have been equally im
portant.
Kirkland's punting'from the
fullback position has kept oppo
nenls continually at bay, and,
more important, lie has ably taken
over the goal-kicking chores aban
doned by injured l)rtug Dick.
Editor's note: The Stanford
rugby team is undefeated. This
afternoon, in their final home
appearance, they go against a
strong California team. Experts
have talihcd this year's team as
one of the greatest, if not the
greatest, rugby teams in Stan
ford history. The team deserves
appreciation. No reward could
be more satisfying than student
body support.
California and Stanford meet
on tho Indian rugby field at 4
p.m. today to determine the un
official California rugby cham
pionship. The Indians have not
beaten Cal since 1953.
Actually, if amounts to much
more (or less) than that. It's Cal
and Stanford. It's the "Big Game"
of rugby.
The records of both teams are
good. Stanford has won six and
remains undefeated. California
lias a fi-2-l mark. Their respec
tive successes against top-flight
eastern competition indicate that
the winner of today's contest may
be the best collegiate rugby team
in the nation.
