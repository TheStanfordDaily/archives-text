Concern
"-'.'tor. The Daily:
response to the letter by Herbert Enderton,
> woul 1 like to point out why the elections
Id be the concern of every student. The
dicial Council is a part of the ASSU govern
ni which could have a direct bearing on any
'orient. The innocent as well as the guilty often
■ ■ -ar before the council; therefore it is impor
nt that each student take an active part in
ru mining which candidates will be elected
> this council.
it should be obvious that the obligatory nature
voting is not mythical and it is important to
everyone on campus just who carries out these
t ks. There are 11 men seeking the three posi
tions on Men's Council and six women seeking
the three positions on Women's Council to be
determined by this election. Students should
* cali/e their part in ASSU elections and have a
Miuine interest in the outcome.

Editor, The Daily:
This letter was submitted to the ASSU by laws

committee and was, so for ns we know, ignored
It has been brought to our attention that
election of a Florence Moore Legislature repre
sentative in April as provided in the ASSU
by-laws and constitution would limit the choice
to the junior class because the senior class
women are required to enter house drawing .'it
the end of the'sophomore year.
Since the Women's Housing Policy as estab
lished in spring 1956 provides for three classes
to live in all women's dormitories except Roble
and Branner, and
Since the composition of the dormitories will
not he established until May,
I would like to suggest that the By-laws
Committee take this matter under considera
tion before Ihe ASSU election April II and 12,
and
Further to suggest 1 hat all legislative repre
sentatives be elected by Hie living areas early
in fall quarter.
