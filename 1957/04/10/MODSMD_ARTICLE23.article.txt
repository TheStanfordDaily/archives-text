# ON MUN AGENDA
## Indian-South African Friction Caused by Natives at Natal 
### 
Between 1860 and 1911 a number of persons from districts in
India (then under British control) were sent to Natal, South Africa,
to work in the construction of railroads, (lie mining of coal and on
the plantations of the European population. In 19!<; the descendants
ol' these Indians numbered 285,260.

According to the State Information Office of the Union of Soulh

Africa, "tiiey (the Indians] took
occupation of the properties Hiey
had bought projecting their ori
ental way of life into the midst
of the western atmosphere of I be
countries into which they had
moved. ... It is not to l>e won
dered at that this caused friction
between the two groups of the
population."
An act was passed by the Euro
pean white-dominated government
of the Union of South Africa eon
trolling and restricting land trans
actions between South Africans of
.European and of Indian origin
and limiting the social and politi
cal equality of the Indian mi
nority.
Indians who had bought homes
in certain residential sections of
South African cities were refused
permission to occupy them.
In June 194(1 the government of
India asked the General Assembly
of the United Nations to place the
discrimination- of South Africa
against the Indians on its agenda.
India charged that the South
A fr i ea n act violated previous
agreements between the two coun
tries involved, as well as the fun
damental human rights, and free
doms expressed in the charter of
the United Nations.
The Union of South Africa de
nied the right of the United Na
tions to interfere in the matter
because such interference would
violate a UN article regarding the
rights of domestic jurisdiction.
At present, after many UN at
attempts to settle the matter, the
Union of South Africa refuses to
recognize Indian equality in its
state.
During a debate in the Ad Hoc
Political Committee in December
19.55, India's representative ex
pressed his regret over the ab
sence of the Union representative
and stressed that Ihe Union of
South Africa was the last country
hi the world where racial equality
had not been accepted "in prin
ciple."
The international problem of
Asian and African peoples and
that of the intolerance and dis
crimination against non-whites
will be considered by MUN.
