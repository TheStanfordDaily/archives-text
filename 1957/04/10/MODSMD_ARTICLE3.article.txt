# University Choir Main Attraction Of S.F. Symphony
## 
### 
The Stanford University Choir
was the main attraction in an
otherwise average performance by
the Sin Francisco Symphony in
Memorial Auditorium last night.
Start ol the concert was delayed
until the arrival of a substitute
flutes! for t hf evening. /Phe regu
lar member of the Symphony be
came ill earlier in the day, and
the radio program the substitute
participated in did not permit him
to leave San Francisco until 7:30
p.m.
"Flos Campi," presented by the
choir and approximately 30 mem
hers of the Symphony, was the
best selection of the evening. Solo
viola Ferenc Molnar gave an ad
mirable performance. The sopra
no section succeeded in keeping
their highest notes, which are at
times hard to control, on pitch and
tree from the harsh tone so easily
obtained.
Only a moderate applause greet
ed the final strains of most of the
works. Though Lobos' "The Ori
gin of the River Amazon" was
well done, the audience, as usual
composed mainly of non-students,
did not care lor the work. The
work is based on the modern style
consisting of harmonic principles
that deviate from the old excepted
type.
Wagner's beautiful Prelude and
Isolde's Love-Death, from "Tris
tan and Isolde," seemed to lose
much oJ its ( harm because of the i
overworking it received. In this
work, as in nearly all the others,
the sections showed their mastery
of the physical music, but seemed
to lack something in the way of
interpretation.
