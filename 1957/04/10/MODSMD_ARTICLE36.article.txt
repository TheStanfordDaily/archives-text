# The
						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
No doubt about it, Saturday's track and field titanic between
Stanford and their rivals to the south is likely to be one of the best
battles ever waged in the ancient series, which dates back to 1908.
One thing which is not just likely, but is dead certain, is that the
1957 edition of the Indian-Trojan spike rivalry will be staged in a
manner not seen at Stanford in a long time at least, and probably
never before.
When Payton Jordan came to Stanford from Occidental, he
brought more than a technical knowledge of track and field. He
brought plenty of ideas as to how a meet should be staged and how
lo make sure the spectators know just what is happening at every
spot on the field.
The most noticeablc change will probably be the new uniforms
sported by the Indian squad. Gone is the diagonal stripe across
the shirt front, with an "S" overlaying it. Instead, the Tribe will
sport white tops- with the word "STANFORD" in block letters hori
zontally across the front.
identification will be far easier, since each man will have his
name lettered across the shirt backs. Then, just in case spectators
can't see the name on the back, all runners will have numbers on
their shirt fronts'corresponding to numbers in the official program.
In lield event compelilion, the practice will be continued whereby
a large placard bearing the name of a contestant is displayed each
lime il is that particular man's turn to jump or throw.
Before each event begins, a special introduction of competitors
ceremony will be held in front of the grandstand, in much the same
style as was so elfectively used at the 1956 Olympic Trials.
Another novel identification device will be introduced by Jor
dan in the running events. It will consist of a wire stretching
across the finish line at a height several feet alxive the runners'
heads. From this wire will he hung large placards with the num
ber of the particular lane over which they are hung. In this man
ner, the spectator some distance from the finish line can slill tell
who wins a race by seeing which runner flashes under the laftc
card first, and can identify the runner by noting who was in that
particular lane.
Fvery race with the exception of the 220-yard low. hurdles is
going to finish at one identical spot in Saturday's meet. This in
cludes the 220-yard dash, which will be run around one curve as is
done at the Olympics. The 440 and 880 will be run around two and
loui t ui ns respectively, in place of one and three as is sonhetimes
done.
Also in keeping with the Olympic style, all races will be restricted
to six entrants, three from each school. This should serve to elimi
nate the needless jostling and interference which often accompanies
a large field, particularly in the distances.
As a final aid to spectator enjoyment and understanding of the
meet, the official program will contain not only first and last
names and numbers of all competitor's, but will list the year's best
mark by each man.
I'-ven if there were no innovations on the production side of the
meet, it would still be a renewal of the bitterest dual meet rivalry
in ih United States. And to make Saturday's meet even more
climactical, it could mark the first time Stanford has ever lost its
lead in overall victories. Presently, the Tribe'leads 26-25, but must
win or surrender its advantage.
Peculiarly enough, the series has been a story of two tremendous
winning streaks one by each team. When the series first began,
and for a long time afterward, it seemed as though USC would
never win. The Tribe started things off with a 104-18 slaughter of
Troy, and didn't even have a close squeeze until the 11th meet of
the series, when Stanford won by five points.
Gradually the Trojans got stronger, and although Stanford
kept on winning, the meets kept getting closer. Finally, in 1926,
USC stopped the Indian win streak at 22 by scraping out a 67'/ 2 -
63'/i victory. The Tribe retorted by winning the next three meets,
but then came the sign of things to come as Southern Cal took
three in a row. Dink Templeton's 1933 team got in one last gasp
victory, 67-64, but lost the second meet of that season to Troy by
14 points and the die was cast.
Stanford has not beaten USC since that meet of early 1933. The
closest ihey came was in 1948, but even then, the nation's number
one track power prevailed by 11 points, 71-60. Two years before, in
1916, the Indians were humiliated, 108-23. Scores of the last three
years haven't been quite that bad, but they've been bad.
In some respects, it's a bleak picture. But the important thing
is that this year's team of Payton Jordan is not worrying about
relatively ancient history. They're not interested in last year's
results or even last week's. They're interested in Saturday's per- .
formanees, and they're going into the meet with the idea that Sat
urday's performances are going to be winning ones. Jordan says
that "USC will have to catch us if they want to win."
The so-called experts say USC will catch Stanford; a local track
team says they won't. No doubt about it, this battle is one which
will provide fans with an exciting day at ihe Stadium.
