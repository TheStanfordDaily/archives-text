# Troy Tabbed for 3 Firsts In Middle, Long Distances
## 
### 
Editor's Note: This is the second a.'iieie in IJirk Barnes' three
part series analyzing the various events in the Stanford-Southern
California track and field meet Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
Today, the middle distances, relay and long distance. Tomorrow,
field events.
A big shaje of the responsibility for getting Stanford into posi- 1
tion to engineer an upset win over USC Saturday is falling on the
shoulders of Don Chesarek, the sophomore middle distance sensation '
who has been a real bulwark of Payton Jordan's surprising team.
Chesarek assumed the logical favorite's role for the critical 440-

yard race when he blazed to a
17.7 clocking lasl Saturday al
PYosno's lladcliffe Stadium.
Thf'it- s no doubt that hell face
pi' nty of rugged competition
from whatever Hireo men Jess

Trojans. Fastest of the bevy of

I held out for tho 880 in place of
trying the difficult double. Cock
burn has toured the quarter in
I 48.5, but was beaten last week
! aaginst Occidental.
Fight for Third
If Chesarek and Cockburn both
run, and finish 1-2 as past per
formances indicate they should,
there will yet remain a terrific
| battle for third, or for second if
: C'ockburn skips the quarter.
Bob Ilyde will definitely be in
the battle for Stanford, along
| with cither Chuck I nee or Bill
Carls. Ince, at '18.8, was the In
j dians' best quarter - miler last
! year.
Morten sen will probably
choose his remaining entrants
from among Ramon Lope/, Jim
Brooks and Bob I-larmen, or
could use all Ihree.
Shifting the scene to the half
mile, Torh Aivlerson of the Tro
jans 'looms. as the most likely
winner He pared his time down
| to 1:51.7 against Oxy, and has
shown a great deal of improve
! ment all year.
Problem of Choosing
Mortensen faces another prob
; lem of where to place his men,
I since three of his five top 880
j men are also hot in other events.
Cockburn could go 440, 880 or
| both.
Joe VVoollett and Chesarek,
j who'll bo out for a double, are the
prime Stanford hopes, with Don
Richardson a shade back. VVool
lett came home in 1:53.5 against.
Fresno, while Chesarek ran
1:55.2 several weeks ago. Rich
ardson has clocked 1:56.0.
The tv/o relay teams will, of
course, be made up of the middle
distance men. Jordan will prob
! ably go with Hyde, Carls or Ince,
Woollelt and Chesarek, who an
chore;! in 46.8 against Mike
j'Agostini last week. The team as
I a whole has run 3:18.1.
USC is just one-tenth behind
| the Indians, with an official top
mark of 3:18.2, but in last week's
race they were disqualified for
interference.
Tribe in Trouble
In the two long-distance races,
the mile and two-mile, Stanford
! will probably be in trouble. The
Trojans have two of the nation's
: finest runners in Max Truex and
Sid Wing, and seem assured of
first places in both events.
Truex showed he is ready for
Stanford by breaking the U.S.
Collegiate record in the two-mile
| with a fine mark of 8:55.0 last
week. Truex could conceivably
double in the two races, since he
has run the mile in 4:18.7 this
j year, better than any Stanford
| man.
j Probably, however, he will
stick to only the two-mile, leav
ing Wing, Bob Shankland and ei
ther Ray Hale or McLeod to bat

Craves is also the Stanford
' 'andnrd-bcarer in the Iwo-mile.
iNot only will he have Truex to
light, hut will also be hard
pressed to beat Mai Robertson, a
I'i'ojan who has run 0:07.9 and
who was a cross-country star last

Tribe in Trouble
In the two long-distance races,
the mile and two-mile, Stanford
! will probably be in trouble. The
Trojans have two of the nation's

Sid Wing, and seem assured of
first places in both events.
Truex showed he is ready for
Stanford by breaking the U.S.
Collegiate record in the two-mile

week. Truex could conceivably
double in the two races, since he
has run the mile in 4:18.7 this
j year, better than any Stanford

A big shaje of the responsibility for getting Stanford into posi- 1
