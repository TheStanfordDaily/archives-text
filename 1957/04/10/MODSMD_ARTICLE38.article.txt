# Cards Master Halsey, Win 7-1 Over Spartans
## 
### 
Tuck Halsey's pitching mastery
over the Stanford Indians was un
ceremoniously ended yesterday
when the Tribe pounded out 11
hits and a 7-1 victory over San
Jose State on Sunken Diamond.
The big right-hander, who had
shut out the Cards in - the s< ison's
opener, was touched for- all of
Stanford's hits before being re
lieved by A 1 Mclntyre in the
eighth. The win was the Indians'
first in three games with the
Spartans this year.
While the hitters were having
a big day at the plate, the veteran
Card infield sparkled with five
double plays. Shortstop Steve
Stewart and first baseman Hal
Messner were in on twin
killings, while second sacker Al
Shaw took part in four.
Bob Fletcher paced the club in
hitting with two singles and a
double in four trips. Rudy Figue
roa, Al Shaw, Parker Olsen and
Rich DeFabio all had two hits,
with Shaw and Olsen smashing
tremendous triples off the left
field bank.
Doubles by Fletcher and Shaw
knotted the score in the bottom
of the first and sent the Cards
winging. Another was added in
the third on an error, and Olsen's
single and 112 o u r singles in the
fourth brought across two runs
and wrapped it up.
Southpaw Bob Leopold, a trans
fer from Stockton College, threw
the first three innings for 1 the
Cards, showing a fine fast ball.
He was relieved by Ed Verdur
men, who receives credit for the
victory.
