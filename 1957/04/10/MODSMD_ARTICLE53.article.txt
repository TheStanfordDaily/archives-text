# Ed Gearhart asks:
## What does Du Pont mean by "on-the-job" training? 
### 
Denton Harris answers:

Tiaiding is pretty much full Iitno at
l)u Pont, Rd. I he main objective is
I" train mm lo reach their full capa
bilities as soon as possible. So we give
llir new man responsibility the flay
lie arrives, and increase it as oppor
tunities are available and he's ready
for untie responsibility.
I li.it s the basic,guiding policy. Itut
Du Pont lias many departments. And
training lias many facets.
In some plants, the college graduate
being trained for supervision is moved

through all area:* of the production
eyde. In others, where the technical
phases arc more involved, he may
spend time in a laboratory or devel
opment group before moving on lo
production.
It works the same way in sales. The
graduate may first learn the labora
tory side of the products lie's going to
sell. ()r he may start right out on
learning selling techniques. That all
depends on the products and markets
involved.

Tlir same on-the-job principle ap
plies lo new men in specialized fields
of research, development or design ...
including daily contacts with super
vision. frequent lectures, discussions
and conferences. Periodic changcs in
assignment, loo.
li s carefully planned, individualized
training, bl. We'vn found it's the
most effective way lo broaden a man
quickly. I)u Pont is a growing organ*
izalion. And men with leadership po
tential are always in demand.

Ponton B. Harris joined l)u Pout's F.ngi
n««iing Research Laboratory in June,
after completing work for an M.S.
in civil engineering at the University of
Massachusetts. He's currently working
on an unusual project —a broad study of
the philosophy of design. The objective
is to learn more about people's design
preferences, ami the trends behind new
concepts in industrial design. This new
