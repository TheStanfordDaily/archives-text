# Students To Decide Candidates' Fate With Ballots
## 
### 
Balloting for the two-day ASSU primary election starts al 8:30
this morning at Engineering Corner. The polls will remain open
today until 3:30 p.m. and will be open tomorrow from 8:30 a.m.
to 1:30 p.m.
One office was dropped yesterday from the list of offices. Elec
tion Chairman Karen Peterson announced that because of unfore
seen difficulties graduate engineers will be unable to elect a repre
sentative to Legislature in the primaries. The election will be post
poned until the finals, April 18 and 19.
Miss Peterson also clarified another question. Fifth-year engi
neering students will not be allowed to vote for senior class of
ficers.
No ballots will br counted, and therefore no trends or results
will be announced until polls close tomorrow.
The Daily referendum issue will appear on the same ballot as
ASSU officer candidates. Ballots for other offices will be on sepa
rate pads.

Ballot boxes will be labeled as to which ballot goes in which box.
"it is absolutely necessary that students put all ballots given
to them in the boxes, whether they vote or not," Miss Peterson
said. Last year an election had to be re-run because enough ballots
were lost to have changed a race.
There will be no active campaigning either Thursday or Friday.
