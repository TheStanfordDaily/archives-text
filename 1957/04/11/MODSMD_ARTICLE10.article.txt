# Keynoter Tsiang Prophesies Continued Impotence of UN
## Chinese UN Delegation Chief Urges Care in Far Eastern Situation 
### 
Dr. Tsiang Ting-fu prophesied the continued impotency of the
United Nations against the Soviet Union and stressed the importance
of the battle for the admission of Communist China as a determining
factor in the fight for freedom in Southeast Asia in his keynote
speech at the opening General Assembly meeting of the Model Unit-

ed Nations last night.
"Unless we watch develop
ments very carefully," he said,
"the whole Far East may be
drawn into the Soviet orbit. The
battle around the question of ad
mission is a battle not only for
mainland China but also for
Southeast Asia.
"UN admission would enhance
the prestige of the Communists
among the Chinese, both at home
and abroad (13,000,000 scattered
in Southeast Asia), and to that
extent, make the liberation of
mainland China that much more
difficult.
Cause of Freedom
"If the free world should yield
country by country, region by re
gion. the cause of freedom will
be lost."
Tsiang stressed the relation
ship between UN policy in regard
to China and intellectual opinions
which have prevailed in the Unit
ed States.
From 1945 to 1949, he said,
American thinkers, including
President Harry Truman and
General George Marshall, held
that the Chinese Communists
were "agrarian reformers" rath
er than true Stalinists. This led
to-the American suggestion that
China form a coalition govern
ment with Communists included.
L«'d to Apathy
This mistaken attitude led to
apathy in the United Nations to
ward the plight of China. "The
imposition of a Communist re
gime on China through Soviet
Russian subversion and aggres
sion failed even to call forth
strong resolutions of condemna
tion by the United Nations."
Since the Chinese Communists
have condemned Tito and the
Hungarian revolt, American
thinkers have a new theory of
"two Chinas," Communist and
Nationalist, both enjoying UN
membership.
Tsiang Answers
To this Tsiang answered, "The
Chinese people have not accepted
Communism. At any moment re
volts against the Communist re
gime might develop on the main
land. It will be the duty of my
government to rush to the sup
port of our brethren.
"The battle for freedom in Asia
must be fought on the mainland
of China. My fellow countrymen
will do the fighting. Let the Unit
ed Nations not hamper us. Let
the liberals of the United States
not hamper us."

Dr. Tsiang Ting-fu prophesied the continued impotency of the
United Nations against the Soviet Union and stressed the importance
of the battle for the admission of Communist China as a determining
factor in the fight for freedom in Southeast Asia in his keynote
speech at the opening General Assembly meeting of the Model Unit-

ed Nations last night.
"Unless we watch develop
ments very carefully," he said,
"the whole Far East may be
drawn into the Soviet orbit. The
battle around the question of ad
mission is a battle not only for
mainland China but also for
Southeast Asia.
"UN admission would enhance
the prestige of the Communists
among the Chinese, both at home
and abroad (13,000,000 scattered
in Southeast Asia), and to that
extent, make the liberation of
mainland China that much more
difficult.
Cause of Freedom
"If the free world should yield
country by country, region by re
gion. the cause of freedom will
be lost."
Tsiang stressed the relation
ship between UN policy in regard
to China and intellectual opinions
which have prevailed in the Unit
ed States.
From 1945 to 1949, he said,
American thinkers, including
President Harry Truman and
General George Marshall, held
that the Chinese Communists
were "agrarian reformers" rath
er than true Stalinists. This led
to-the American suggestion that
China form a coalition govern
ment with Communists included.

apathy in the United Nations to
