## 
### Anne Johnson 
Cuba challenged the Hunga
rian delegation's right to repre
sent Hungary at last night's first
plenary meeting of the Model
United Nations.
The session's acting president
Herbert Hymans from the Stan
ford Institute of Internatioanl
Relations ruled that Hungary
would remain seated provisional
ly until tomorrow morning. At
that time the Credentials Com
mittee will meet to consider the
question.
Highlighting the colorful, con
troversial session was the admit
tance of Ghana as the 81st mem
ber of the Model United Nations,
The vote was 63 nations for ad
mittance with Nicaragua abstain
ing. Michael Asafo • Boakye, a
Stanford student and citizen of
Ghana, spoke for his country.
The United States proposed
that a study group be established
to consider the feasibility ot in
ternationalizing all waterways.
The delegate from the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republic.
(University of California) called
for the admittance of the Peo
ple's Republic of China to the
Model United Nations. He said
the present Nationalist Chinese
delegation "represented no one."
The U.S. delegate, Irv Stolberg
from Oregon State College, also
said his country would accept the
Special United Nations Fund for
Economi C Development and
I would support it on a limited
basis. This completely reverses
the previous United States stand.
Cuba's challenge of Hungary
came during voting on a motion
I to elect 34 nations to the creden
tials committee. Cuba, represent
j ed by delegates from the Califor
nia Institute of Technology, said
this Hungarian delegation repre
! sented a puppet regime set up by
! Russian arms. Hungary (Central
Washington College of Fduca
tion) immediately rose in pro
test, saying Cuba had no right to
I raise this question.
When the agenda for this sev
i enth session was brought up for
I approval, the Union of South Af-
I rica appealed for two minutes to
| speak. The delegate (from San
i Jose State) said her delegation
would not participate in any dis
cussion of questions concerning
South Africa.
France, represented by St. Ma
ry's College, then said it would
abstain from voting on the agen
da because il included the ques
j tion of Algeria. The agenda was
finally passed.
Pageanlry entered Memorial
Auditorium when members of
! Stanford's ROTC units carried
flags of 59 nations to ihe stage.
The MUN secretariat had tried
! unsuccessfully all day to get
j flags for all the nations. As the
flags were arranged around ihe
j stage, a huge mobile of the UN
insignia was lowered into place
as a backdrop. Hymans then
called for a moment of medita
-1 ion.
