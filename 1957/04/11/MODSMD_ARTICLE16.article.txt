# Issues Facing MUN
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The issues with which Model United Nations is
dealing are not theoretical academic problems. They are the iden
t id issues with which its parent organization in New York is
" i appling.
The following is- the first in a series of summary articles on
Ml N issues.

Cyprus
I.ast month in the United Na
tions the question of Cyprus was
niict' more swept under the car-
M't, putting a damper on Greece's
lung-standing efforts to bring it
to tne General Assembly agenda.
The final resolution, proposed
by India's V. K. Krishna Menon,
c lied for negotiations "in accord
with the principles ... of the
United Nations charter." The
(solution was unanimously ac
cepted as a compromise in an
;uc which was of primary con
' rn to three nations.
Greece has pressed the United
"Nations for a number of years to
i'! ynize "self - determination"
ft i Cyprus, which in effect will
n an union with Greece.
Turkey, representing about 18
ptv cent of the population of Cy
; us. has charged that Greece's
e interest in Cyprus is "terri
l il aggrandizement" and fears
Gteek domination.
Great Britain has practically
Mimed the arguments advanced
y both Greece and Turkey. The
L itish government has main
' ined from the very beginning
;at Cyprus is a vital military
...so for protection of their oil
crests in the Middle East.
Hie British government of the
Crown Colony exiled the Cypri
i- religious and political leader
Aichbishop Myriarthefs Maka
s in order to create a "fertile
' cuum" for the rise of moderate
C .v>riot leaders. Then they began
a wholesale military crackdown
• n terrorists.
In December the British Colo
nial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd
of to red Cyprus a constitution and
parliament. Under the proposed
constitution, 24 out of the 30
eat in the elected legislature
wfiuld be occupied by Greek Cyp
iots. But the British Governor
. old maintain "reserve powers"
which would give him a veto over
legislation.
So far, the UN has asked only
for negotiation on the question
of pf 112 determination for Cyprus.
Algeria
Two resolutions aimed at se
curing peace in independent-mind
< Algeria will be considered in
■ Thursday and Friday sessions
of the Ad Hoc Political Commit

tee. These resolutions are pro
posed by Hungary (Central Wash
ington College of Education) and
Rumania (Olympic College).
Algeria, a formerly free coun
try conquered by the French in
1834, is now an integral part of
Fran c e. Theoretically it is in
equality with its conquerors,
maintaining citizenship for all Al
gerians and the right to vote at
age 21. Algeria, however, claims
her treatment has been far from
that of equality and that she is
completely at France's mercy.
At present, Algerian national
ists and French military forces
are waging all-out wars to effect
the interests of each. The situa
tion has continually worsened
since war broke out in 1954, and
France has finally agreed to allow
the question to be included on the
agenda of the General Assembly
in the 1957 session.
Speculation, therefore, has been
aroused concerning her consent
to allow the question to be includ
ed on this year's agenda. The two
resolutions concern: (1) that a
cease-fire be called in Algeria and
a UN police force be called in to
maintain peace, and (2) that Al
geria be accorded her right to
sel determination.
SUNFED
The purpose of the proposed
Special United Nations Fund for
Econ o m i c-Development (SUN
FED) is to raise the standard of
living in underdeveloped coun
tries. It attempts to accomplish
this by having advanced countries
contribute public funds which can
be channeled through the Interna
tional Bank into the program.
A draft resolution calling for a
committee to investigate the pos
sibilities of such a program was
sponsored last year by 32 coun
tries from Asia, Africa, Latin
America and western Europe. The
committee is to report its findings
to the General Assembly this
year.
The program, as mapped out,
calls for an initial capital of $250
million. The United States, United
Kingdom, Australia, Canada and
New Zealand object to the pres
ent program, feeling unable to
assume the responsibility of sup
i plying the entire capital.
