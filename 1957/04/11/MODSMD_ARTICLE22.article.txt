"We hope for a liberation of the
Chinese mainland from the Com
munist regime, ami if the people
revolt against their rulers like
the Hungarians tried to do we
won't just make sptvches; we will
help them revolt."
These were I lie words of Dr.
Tsiang Tlng-fu, head delegate of
Nationalist China to the United
Nations and keynote speaker ai
last night's opening session of the
Model United Nations (leneral As
sembly.
Tsiang answered questions at
a press conference yesterday aft
ernoon in Hoover Library.
Dislike Collectivism
"The Chinese farmers on the
mainland dislike collectivism," he
said. "They like their own indi
vidual little farms, and, since the
Communists have taken over, the
farmers have lost interest. This
is causing economic troubles for
the Communist government."
One thing he said with certain
ty was that "my delegation will
never be in the same international
organization with Communist
China."
A conference like this MUN
gathering has great value, Tsiang
said, in that it gives students a
more concrete picture of the
workings of the UN. "The ex
change of ideas among students
from different universities is also
valuable."
One of the 30-odd reporters at

the conference coipmented that
John Foster Dulles had said the!
United States would defend cer
tain Nationalist islands, and later |
repudiated these statements. !
"What are your ideas on this
matter?" the reporter asked.
"I do nol wish to comment," I
Tsiang replied.
By coincidence, one of the re
porters is a native Chinese who
had heard Tsiang report on the
UN while he was in Taiwan (For
mosa). I-wen Hsiaso, now attend
ing Eastern Washington College
of Education, at Cheney, Wash.,
asked Tsiang in Chinese when he I
was last in Formosa.
(ireat Progress
"Three weeks ago," Tsiang re-1
plied. "I noticed great progress
when I went back. Now only 50 i
per cent depend on agriculture for i
a living, and GO per cent have!
electric power."
Tsiang said all county and city
governments are now on an elec
tive basis.
"At first everyone was so en
thusiastic about,elections that 85
per cent of the eligible voters
turned out," he said. "Now that
enthusiasm has died down and
only 70 per cent turn out."

China, in 1H9.~>. Hp received the
Ph.D. degree from Columbia in
1923 and served as a professor at
