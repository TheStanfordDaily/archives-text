Volunteer crew eoa( h Lou Lindsey has "high" hopes for his var
sity eight plus coxswain which opens its season this Saturday morn

ICuudy .Jones und Ihey would total 50 feet 2 inches.
And il Lindsey took a notion he could enter a varsity shell whose
height would total . r >l feet 5 inches without coxswain, made up en
tirely of .sophomores and juniors. Although there are no records to
verify it, Lindsey believes that if this shell were entered in inter
collegiate rowing it would he the tallest ever to compete in the
United States and probably the world.

Coaches Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain's track teams turned
in several outstanding performances over the first of many sport
packed weekends lined up this spring for Card athletes.

Last Saturday morning John Stabler got things rolling by setting
a new freshman pole vault record of 13-8, completely shattering
Hob Mathias' old record of 13-%. It; appears that for the first time
since anyone can remember the varsity will have a vaulter consist
ently capable of holding his own in college competition.
In fact, Stabler only needs to add six inches to his 13-8 in
either this or his remaining three seasons to break the Stanford
pole vault record of 1.4-1% set by Hill Miller way back in l!)32.
Not to be outdone by Stabler, Norman Pease, Dick Lassen,
Chuck McKenney and Hob Besse literally ran away from their
competition to set a new frosh record of 3:22.3 in the mile relay.
Although the relay and vaulting records were the highlights of
1he meet, the most important thing that happened, to this column's
way of thinking, was Bob Monzingo's heartbreaking loss in the
two-mile.
Monzingo is one of many promising distance runners Jordan
will have to work with in the next few years. Despite starting 15
seconds behind his outclassed opponents in the mile in order to
make a closer race, Monzingo romped home in ease on Angell
Field's wind-swept track in a creditable 4:25.1 time.
And after leading City College of San Francisco's Fddie Chevez
for seven laps in the two-mile, Monzingo seemed to be headed for
his second victory of the day as he increased his stride and speed
on the back stretch of the gun lap.
Coming off the turn into a strong home-stretch head wind, Mon
zingo was still running hard and commanded a 10-yard lead. Only
t he anxiety in the voices of the partisan Stanford spectators warned
Monzingo that Chevez had broken into a sprint and was rapidly
closing the gap.
Repeatedly looking back at his pursuer, Monzingo was nipped
at the tape by the flying Chevez. After running two miles it is
rough 1o lose by inches after leading all but the last foot. It is even
rougher to lo$;e such a race twice.
Monzingo lof.'t the race first, or rather if was lost for him, when
no reliable source was present on the final turn to warn Monzingo
about < hevez' position. This is not only the opinion of this column,
but also timekeeper and unofficial track coach emeritus Garnet
Young.
Secondly, and in the final analysis, it was Monzingo who lost the
race lor himself by breaking the golden rule of track: NEVER
LOOK BACK.
Jusl as there are 1wo reasons why Monzingo lost the two-mile
t.ice, i hero are two reasons why his loss was the most important
thing that happened in the meet.
In the first place Monzingo learned a valuable lesson from the
greatest of all teachers —experience. And the price was cheap:
second place instead of first in a rather unimportant meet, the
1 esiilt of which was already decided.
'I he second reason why Monzingo's loss was important is that
it should have taught the team that track is a TEAM sport All
loo ofl en races arc lost because of insufficient team support
I'Vw track and field men will deny that the Ivvo-mile is one of
sport's most grueling races. It takes it even rougher when a
man has to double with the mile.

race i>, just as important as any other event.
Although the freshman team will probably never have to relv
on a Iwormlo victory by Monzingo to win any of their meets, things

Last Saturday morning John Stabler got things rolling by setting
a new freshman pole vault record of 13-8, completely shattering
Hob Mathias' old record of 13-%. It; appears that for the first time
since anyone can remember the varsity will have a vaulter consist
ently capable of holding his own in college competition.
In fact, Stabler only needs to add six inches to his 13-8 in
either this or his remaining three seasons to break the Stanford
pole vault record of 1.4-1% set by Hill Miller way back in l!)32.
Not to be outdone by Stabler, Norman Pease, Dick Lassen,
Chuck McKenney and Hob Besse literally ran away from their
competition to set a new frosh record of 3:22.3 in the mile relay.
Although the relay and vaulting records were the highlights of
1he meet, the most important thing that happened, to this column's
way of thinking, was Bob Monzingo's heartbreaking loss in the
two-mile.
Monzingo is one of many promising distance runners Jordan
will have to work with in the next few years. Despite starting 15
seconds behind his outclassed opponents in the mile in order to
make a closer race, Monzingo romped home in ease on Angell
Field's wind-swept track in a creditable 4:25.1 time.
And after leading City College of San Francisco's Fddie Chevez
for seven laps in the two-mile, Monzingo seemed to be headed for
his second victory of the day as he increased his stride and speed
on the back stretch of the gun lap.
Coming off the turn into a strong home-stretch head wind, Mon
zingo was still running hard and commanded a 10-yard lead. Only
t he anxiety in the voices of the partisan Stanford spectators warned
Monzingo that Chevez had broken into a sprint and was rapidly
closing the gap.
Repeatedly looking back at his pursuer, Monzingo was nipped
at the tape by the flying Chevez. After running two miles it is
rough 1o lose by inches after leading all but the last foot. It is even
rougher to lo$;e such a race twice.
Monzingo lof.'t the race first, or rather if was lost for him, when
no reliable source was present on the final turn to warn Monzingo
about < hevez' position. This is not only the opinion of this column,
but also timekeeper and unofficial track coach emeritus Garnet
Young.
Secondly, and in the final analysis, it was Monzingo who lost the
race lor himself by breaking the golden rule of track: NEVER
LOOK BACK.
Jusl as there are 1wo reasons why Monzingo lost the two-mile
t.ice, i hero are two reasons why his loss was the most important
thing that happened in the meet.
In the first place Monzingo learned a valuable lesson from the
greatest of all teachers —experience. And the price was cheap:
second place instead of first in a rather unimportant meet, the
1 esiilt of which was already decided.
'I he second reason why Monzingo's loss was important is that

I'Vw track and field men will deny that the Ivvo-mile is one of
