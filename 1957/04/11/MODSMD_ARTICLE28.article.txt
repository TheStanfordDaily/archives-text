# Bear Ruggers Do It Again... Top Cards, 11-3
## 
### 
California reigns supreme at
least until Stanford is rematched
with them Saturday in Berkeley.
Bear wingback Bob B ro ok s
scooted 70 yards with but 10 min
utes remaining in yesterday's eon
test on the Stanford rugby field
to salt away an 11-3 victory for
Cal Bear his eighth straight
since 1U53.
Brooks, a veteran Cal rugger
just returned from Army service,
was a thorn in Pete Kmetovic's
Indians' side all afternoon with
his cutting, driving runs.
But real credit for the victory
must go to the California scrum,
which left no doubt throughout
the game as to.which team was
superior.
Actually, the throng of Stan
ford rooters which attended the
contest was treated to an out
standing first half by the Indians.
Repeatedly backed against their
goal line by a strong wind which
blew their own punts back in their
faces, Kmetovic's crew trailed by
only 6-3 at the intermission.
£al wingback Max Hale made a
25-yard penalty kick from a wide
angle to open scoring. The Bears
shortly jumped to a 6-0 lead when
break Mike White rambled 15
yards for a -try.
Stanford scored its only points
of the game when fullback A 1
Kirkland curved a 35-yard penalty
kick between the goal posts, de
spite a brisk facing wind.
The second half, with the In
dians noted for their late-game
play, and enjoying the wind at
their backs, promised to be more
enjoyable.
Such was not the case.
Although a good share of the
half was spent in Cal territory,
the Indians never mounted a gen
uine threat. The large, aggressive
Bear scrum smothered every scor
ing thrust.
With the score still 6-3 and Stan
ford victory still very much in
sight, Brooks took a toss-out from
a loose scrum, headed for the
sidelines, cut back into the middle
through several would-be tacklers
—and the game was gone. Trut
ner converted to end scoring.
Saturday Stanford travels to
Berkeley for their final game of
the season. The varsity (6-1) will
meet the Bear varsity (7-2-1) at
2 p.m. and a JV contest will fol
low.

The second half, with the In
dians noted for their late-game
play, and enjoying the wind at
their backs, promised to be more
enjoyable.
Such was not the case.
Although a good share of the
half was spent in Cal territory,
the Indians never mounted a gen
uine threat. The large, aggressive
Bear scrum smothered every scor
ing thrust.
With the score still 6-3 and Stan
ford victory still very much in
sight, Brooks took a toss-out from
a loose scrum, headed for the
sidelines, cut back into the middle
through several would-be tacklers
—and the game was gone. Trut
ner converted to end scoring.
Saturday Stanford travels to
Berkeley for their final game of
the season. The varsity (6-1) will
meet the Bear varsity (7-2-1) at
2 p.m. and a JV contest will fol
low.
California reigns supreme at
least until Stanford is rematched
with them Saturday in Berkeley.
Bear wingback Bob B ro ok s
scooted 70 yards with but 10 min
utes remaining in yesterday's eon
test on the Stanford rugby field
to salt away an 11-3 victory for
Cal Bear his eighth straight
since 1U53.
Brooks, a veteran Cal rugger
just returned from Army service,
was a thorn in Pete Kmetovic's
Indians' side all afternoon with
his cutting, driving runs.
But real credit for the victory
must go to the California scrum,
which left no doubt throughout
the game as to.which team was
superior.
Actually, the throng of Stan
ford rooters which attended the
contest was treated to an out
standing first half by the Indians.
Repeatedly backed against their
goal line by a strong wind which
blew their own punts back in their
faces, Kmetovic's crew trailed by
only 6-3 at the intermission.
£al wingback Max Hale made a
25-yard penalty kick from a wide
angle to open scoring. The Bears
shortly jumped to a 6-0 lead when
break Mike White rambled 15
yards for a -try.
Stanford scored its only points
of the game when fullback A 1
Kirkland curved a 35-yard penalty
kick between the goal posts, de
spite a brisk facing wind.
