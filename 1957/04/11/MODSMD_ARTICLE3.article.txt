## A 						Vital Selection 
### 
loimy and tomorrow Hie Stanford student body will go to
tin* polls to pick ASSU, ('lass and WRA officers. Tliey will
make their choice of student body president from an un
precedented of eight candidates; we hope the turnout
of voters uill match the large turnout of candidates that has
marked this election year.
But the student body will also be making a choice as
important as their choice of candidates. I hey will be deciding
whether to repeal the recently-passed hit of legislation con
cerning control of the process of elei-tiiiji the Daily editor.
We strongly urge a YKS vote for repeal of that legislation.
The legislation would make the stall s election of the
editor subject to the approval of Legislature. A mere II
members of Legislature could disapprove the staff's choice
and force tliein to pick a new editor. This is an undesirable
type <>l control. An associate editor would not feel free to
criticize the Legislature—an important part of his dut\ to
Dail\ readers- knowing his election as editor would have to
he approved by that Legislature.
We admit that Ihe Daily has a responsibility—but not
to a 20-member body. Its responsibility is to its {{000 readers
in the campus area which it gerves. We do not think The
Daily has ever abused or will ever abuse this responsibility.
I he Daily has shown its good faith in showing that it is
willing to take criticism by its support of the Publications
Board amendment, which would bring any complaints re
garding The l)ail\ before Publications Board, of which the
Daily editor is a member.
We also object lo the wa\ in which the legislation was
passed, without any attempt of talking over the existing prob
lems with Ihe Daily beforehand. Petitions signed by 1200
students asking that the legislation not be passed were totally
ignored.
Legislation is not and never will be the road to coopera
tion. I'or a continued free Daily, ami a Daily responsible lo
its 15000 student readers, vole Y KS on the referendum.
