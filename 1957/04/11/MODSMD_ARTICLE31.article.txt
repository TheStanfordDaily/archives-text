# Weights May Tip Scales In Saturday's USC Meet
##

Editor's Note: This is the
final article in Dick Barnes*
three part series analyzing tin*
various.' events in Saturday's
S(anford - Southern California
track and field meet in Stan
lord Stadium. Today, the field
events.
Two field events, the high
jump and broad jump, may well
turn out to be Stanford's strong
est events in Saturday's struggle
with Southern California, while
the pole vault appears to be the
Tribe's weakest spot.
In the javelin, the big question j
will be whether or not Hank Rol
dan's consistency can win for j
Stanford, or whether USC's Bob j
Voiles will snap out of his slump i
to get off one of his long, but in- j
frequent, throws.
Roldan has been one of many ,
steady improvers under the tute
lage of Payton Jordan. He has
bettered his season's best mark
in every meet this year, progress
ing from 211-6 through 214-5 and
on to a career high of 220-4 last
week at Fresno.
Voiles has done nearly the op
posite. A month ago in Austin,
Texas, he looked like a world
beater when he bested the USC
school decord with a prodigious
effort of 235-7. But since then,
Voiles has tailed off considerably.
In last week's narrow win over
Occidental, he could throw only
210-7%.
The discus boils down to a
three-way fight among Rink Bab
ka and Jack Egan of the Trojans
and Fred Peters of the Tribe. All
three are within seven feet of
each other, with Babka currently
tops at 174-1. Peters' 170-7 is
just three feet one inch ahead of
Egan.
Ray Williamson, Archie
Schmitt and Chris Plain will be
Ihe three Stanford entrants in
the shot put. Plain is the most
indefinite factor in the shot, since
it is not yet known how well he
can put following his recent lay
off due to a back injury.
Plain has hit 53-3 with the 16-
pound ball, only five inches short
of Dick Bronson's top mark; and

it is Bronson who is the big man
for Troy. Ray Martin, at 53-2 Ms,
will probably l>e right. on the
heels of his teammate, and Carl
Self (51-% ) won't be much far
ther back.
Co-captains Frank Herrmann
and Phil Fehlen will pace the In
dians in their two strong events.
Herrmann is coming closer to the
25-foot mark in every meet, and
is broad-jumping over a foot bel
ter than anyone USC has. Last
week, he bettered his best all
time mark twice, with jumps of
24-7 Ms and 24-B>4.
Not far behind is Kent Hansen,
who also registered his top effort
in the not-so-good Fresno pit. His
23-9 and Chuck Peterson's 23-7
give Jordan's team a fine oppor
tunity to shut out USC.
All-around performer Bob Law
son is the best jumper on the
USC team with a mark of 23-8.
Lawson, however, will probably
be entered in about four other
events and may not be too rested
for the broad jump. C. R. Rob
erts, at 23-3%, appears to be the
only olher Trojan with much of
a chance to move into the scoring
column.
Fehlen is, probably as solid a
favorite as any other entrant in
the meet. He has jumped 6-8 ] />
and hasn't been below 6-6 in any
meet this season. He'll be jump
ing in the same pit where he set
a new school record three weeks
ago, and there isn't anyone on
the Trojan team who seems ca
pable of pressing him.
The question, then, is whether
or not Ron Bondoc and Bernie
Nelson can complete a sweep of
the event for Stanford. Bondoc
has leaped 6-3% in two of the
year's three meets, while Nelson
did 6-1 Vat last week.
Jess Mortensen's Trojans are
strong in the pole vault, and the
Indians are not. Ron Morris, who
has been over 15 feet twice in his
career, is almost a sure winner
Not too far behind him is Jerry
Hren, a 14-footer. The third Tro
jan is Ernie Bullard, a 13-2 man
this year did 14-1 last sea
son.

the event for Stanford. Bondoc
has leaped 6-3% in two of the
year's three meets, while Nelson
did 6-1 Vat last week.
Jess Mortensen's Trojans are
strong in the pole vault, and the

Editor's Note: This is the
final article in Dick Barnes*
three part series analyzing tin*
various.' events in Saturday's
S(anford - Southern California
track and field meet in Stan
lord Stadium. Today, the field
events.
Two field events, the high
jump and broad jump, may well
turn out to be Stanford's strong
est events in Saturday's struggle
with Southern California, while
the pole vault appears to be the
Tribe's weakest spot.
In the javelin, the big question j
will be whether or not Hank Rol
dan's consistency can win for j
Stanford, or whether USC's Bob j
Voiles will snap out of his slump i
to get off one of his long, but in- j
frequent, throws.
Roldan has been one of many ,
steady improvers under the tute
lage of Payton Jordan. He has
bettered his season's best mark
in every meet this year, progress
ing from 211-6 through 214-5 and
on to a career high of 220-4 last
week at Fresno.
Voiles has done nearly the op
posite. A month ago in Austin,
Texas, he looked like a world
beater when he bested the USC
school decord with a prodigious
effort of 235-7. But since then,
Voiles has tailed off considerably.
In last week's narrow win over
Occidental, he could throw only
210-7%.
The discus boils down to a
three-way fight among Rink Bab
ka and Jack Egan of the Trojans
and Fred Peters of the Tribe. All
three are within seven feet of
each other, with Babka currently
tops at 174-1. Peters' 170-7 is
just three feet one inch ahead of
Egan.
Ray Williamson, Archie
Schmitt and Chris Plain will be
Ihe three Stanford entrants in
the shot put. Plain is the most
indefinite factor in the shot, since
it is not yet known how well he
can put following his recent lay
off due to a back injury.
Plain has hit 53-3 with the 16-
pound ball, only five inches short
of Dick Bronson's top mark; and

it is Bronson who is the big man
for Troy. Ray Martin, at 53-2 Ms,
will probably l>e right. on the
heels of his teammate, and Carl
Self (51-% ) won't be much far
ther back.
Co-captains Frank Herrmann
and Phil Fehlen will pace the In
dians in their two strong events.
Herrmann is coming closer to the
25-foot mark in every meet, and
is broad-jumping over a foot bel
ter than anyone USC has. Last
week, he bettered his best all
time mark twice, with jumps of
24-7 Ms and 24-B>4.
Not far behind is Kent Hansen,
who also registered his top effort
in the not-so-good Fresno pit. His
23-9 and Chuck Peterson's 23-7
give Jordan's team a fine oppor
tunity to shut out USC.
All-around performer Bob Law
son is the best jumper on the
USC team with a mark of 23-8.
Lawson, however, will probably
be entered in about four other
events and may not be too rested
for the broad jump. C. R. Rob
erts, at 23-3%, appears to be the
only olher Trojan with much of
a chance to move into the scoring
column.
Fehlen is, probably as solid a
favorite as any other entrant in
the meet. He has jumped 6-8 ] />
and hasn't been below 6-6 in any
meet this season. He'll be jump
ing in the same pit where he set
a new school record three weeks
ago, and there isn't anyone on
the Trojan team who seems ca
pable of pressing him.
The question, then, is whether
or not Ron Bondoc and Bernie

a chance to move into the scoring
column.
Fehlen is, probably as solid a
favorite as any other entrant in
the meet. He has jumped 6-8 ] />
and hasn't been below 6-6 in any
meet this season. He'll be jump
ing in the same pit where he set
a new school record three weeks
ago, and there isn't anyone on
the Trojan team who seems ca
pable of pressing him.
The question, then, is whether
or not Ron Bondoc and Bernie
Nelson can complete a sweep of
the event for Stanford. Bondoc
has leaped 6-3% in two of the
year's three meets, while Nelson
did 6-1 Vat last week.
Jess Mortensen's Trojans are
strong in the pole vault, and the
Indians are not. Ron Morris, who
has been over 15 feet twice in his
career, is almost a sure winner
Not too far behind him is Jerry
Hren, a 14-footer. The third Tro
jan is Ernie Bullard, a 13-2 man
this year did 14-1 last sea
son.
Editor's Note: This is the
final article in Dick Barnes*
three part series analyzing tin*
various.' events in Saturday's
S(anford - Southern California
track and field meet in Stan
lord Stadium. Today, the field
events.
Two field events, the high
jump and broad jump, may well
turn out to be Stanford's strong
est events in Saturday's struggle
with Southern California, while
the pole vault appears to be the
Tribe's weakest spot.
In the javelin, the big question j
will be whether or not Hank Rol
dan's consistency can win for j
Stanford, or whether USC's Bob j
Voiles will snap out of his slump i
to get off one of his long, but in- j
frequent, throws.
Roldan has been one of many ,
steady improvers under the tute
lage of Payton Jordan. He has
bettered his season's best mark
in every meet this year, progress
ing from 211-6 through 214-5 and
on to a career high of 220-4 last
week at Fresno.
Voiles has done nearly the op
posite. A month ago in Austin,
Texas, he looked like a world
beater when he bested the USC
school decord with a prodigious
effort of 235-7. But since then,
Voiles has tailed off considerably.
In last week's narrow win over
Occidental, he could throw only
210-7%.
The discus boils down to a
three-way fight among Rink Bab
ka and Jack Egan of the Trojans
and Fred Peters of the Tribe. All
three are within seven feet of
each other, with Babka currently
tops at 174-1. Peters' 170-7 is
just three feet one inch ahead of
Egan.
Ray Williamson, Archie
Schmitt and Chris Plain will be
Ihe three Stanford entrants in
the shot put. Plain is the most
indefinite factor in the shot, since
it is not yet known how well he
can put following his recent lay
off due to a back injury.
Plain has hit 53-3 with the 16-
pound ball, only five inches short
of Dick Bronson's top mark; and

it is Bronson who is the big man
for Troy. Ray Martin, at 53-2 Ms,
will probably l>e right. on the
heels of his teammate, and Carl
Self (51-% ) won't be much far
ther back.
Co-captains Frank Herrmann
and Phil Fehlen will pace the In
dians in their two strong events.
Herrmann is coming closer to the
25-foot mark in every meet, and
is broad-jumping over a foot bel
ter than anyone USC has. Last
week, he bettered his best all
time mark twice, with jumps of
24-7 Ms and 24-B>4.
Not far behind is Kent Hansen,
who also registered his top effort
in the not-so-good Fresno pit. His
23-9 and Chuck Peterson's 23-7
give Jordan's team a fine oppor
tunity to shut out USC.
All-around performer Bob Law
son is the best jumper on the
USC team with a mark of 23-8.
Lawson, however, will probably
be entered in about four other
events and may not be too rested
for the broad jump. C. R. Rob
erts, at 23-3%, appears to be the
only olher Trojan with much of
a chance to move into the scoring
column.
Fehlen is, probably as solid a
favorite as any other entrant in
the meet. He has jumped 6-8 ] />
and hasn't been below 6-6 in any
