# THOSE WERE THE DAYS
## Tuition Pays Less Than Half University Bills as Costs Rise 
### Rich Brown 
"Residents of California may attend the Leland Stanford Junior
University free of charge, while tuition is $10 for those from outside
the state."
This item appeared in a 1905 book describing the Golden State.
Leland Stanford, in holding the idea that "the children of Califor-

nia shall be my children," founded
the University with the hope that
"his children" would never have
to pay tuition.
But conditions gradually chang
ed until today the endowment is
able to provide only 24 per cent of
the amount needed to run the
University.
Tuition Not Enough
Even though tuition is present
ly $250 per quarter, that amount
is less than half that is needed to
operate the growing institution —
45 per cent. Gifts make up the
balance—3l per cent.
If 18 millionaires could be per
suaded to hand over their for
tunes, Stanford would be able to
operate for one year without ob
taining any other sources of rev
enue.
The University itself lias the
$18 million a year budget. If one
were to include the expenses for
stich related functions as the
Medical School hospitals and ath
letics, the grand total would be
about $27 million annually.
Add Government Funds
Those figures exclude the funds
furbished by the federal govern
ment for research projects, such
as the linear accelerator. If one
were to count government aid as
University income, tuition would
amount to only 30 per cent of the
revenue.
Dormitories and dining halls
are also considered separate from
University expenses, since fees for
their use are paid separately from
tuition.
Where does the $250 per quar
ter go, once it passes over the
counter in the Pavilion on regis
tration day?
Parceling' Out
First, it is mixed in with'the
money from gilts and endowment.
Once this is done, the parceling
out process begins. The largest
chunk—6o per cent —goes to in
struction and faculty research.
That is, about $150 of Ihe tui
tion goes to pay professors' sal
aries and for miscellaneous items
such as instruction and research
equipment and phone bills.
Taking the next biggest bite is
plant operation, which digests 25
per cent of the tuition dollars. The
remainder is divided between
scholarships, 8 per cent, and the
Library, 7 per cent.
The percentage allotted to schol
arships has doubled in the past
decade, while plant operation was
reduced from 30 to 25 per cent.
Library spending increased by 1
per cent.

operate the growing institution —
45 per cent. Gifts make up the
balance—3l per cent.
If 18 millionaires could be per
suaded to hand over their for
tunes, Stanford would be able to
operate for one year without ob
taining any other sources of rev
enue.
The University itself lias the
$18 million a year budget. If one
were to include the expenses for
stich related functions as the
Medical School hospitals and ath
letics, the grand total would be
about $27 million annually.
Add Government Funds
Those figures exclude the funds
furbished by the federal govern
ment for research projects, such
as the linear accelerator. If one
were to count government aid as
University income, tuition would
amount to only 30 per cent of the
revenue.
Dormitories and dining halls
are also considered separate from
University expenses, since fees for
their use are paid separately from
tuition.

Parceling' Out
First, it is mixed in with'the
money from gilts and endowment.
Once this is done, the parceling
out process begins. The largest
chunk—6o per cent —goes to in
struction and faculty research.
That is, about $150 of Ihe tui
tion goes to pay professors' sal
aries and for miscellaneous items
such as instruction and research
equipment and phone bills.
Taking the next biggest bite is
plant operation, which digests 25
per cent of the tuition dollars. The
remainder is divided between
scholarships, 8 per cent, and the
Library, 7 per cent.
The percentage allotted to schol
arships has doubled in the past
decade, while plant operation was
reduced from 30 to 25 per cent.
Library spending increased by 1
per cent.

the University with the hope that
