# SU Position Precarious In 1896 Suit
## Students Cheer When Mrs. Stanford Wins $15 Million Lawsuit 
### Helen Guerrant 
Classes were dismissed by the
fire alarm, and students ran on
Quad cheering and singing "Hail,
Stanford, Hail!" Bombs were ex
ploded, and the post office was
painted a deep red—on March 2,
1896.
This celebration was not with
out cause. The future of Stan
ford University was at stake be
cause of a $15,000,000 suit brought
against Mrs. Stanford by the fed
eral government.
Thirty years before, Governor
Stanford had accepted a govern
ment loan for the construction of
the Central & Southern Pacific
Railway, of which he was presi
dent. After he died the govern
ment sued for one-fourth of the
combined principal and interest of
the loan.
Threat of Closing
If Mrs. Stanford lost, the Uni
versity would be forced to close.
According to California law, how
ever, such a suit could not be filed
more than three years after the
loan was negotiated; so few peo
ple were worried at the beginning.
When the case was taken to the
Circuit Court, Mrs. Stanford won
a unanimous victory, but techni
cal aspects allowed it to be car
ried to the Circuit Court of Ap
peals.
A prolonged delay and the news
that points of legality were on
the government's side caused
growing consternation. Finally
the news of another unanimous
decision in favor of Mrs. Stanford
arrived—and pandemonium reign
ed on campus.
To Supreme Court
Still the case had to be carried
to the United States Supreme
Court, where again a delay caused
uneasiness even among those who
had been most confident. For
months the decision was held in
abeyance, while Stanford's future
balanced precariously.
Finally, almost two years after
the suit was filed, a Palo Alto bus
driver brought in news of the vic
tory, and the celebration that fol
lowed made the first one seem
like nothing. Students took Presi
dent David Starr Jordan at his
word when he said they could "rio
anything but tear down the build
ings and paint the professors."

If Mrs. Stanford lost, the Uni
versity would be forced to close.
According to California law, how
ever, such a suit could not be filed
more than three years after the
loan was negotiated; so few peo
ple were worried at the beginning.
When the case was taken to the
Circuit Court, Mrs. Stanford won
a unanimous victory, but techni
cal aspects allowed it to be car
ried to the Circuit Court of Ap
peals.
A prolonged delay and the news
that points of legality were on
the government's side caused
growing consternation. Finally
the news of another unanimous
decision in favor of Mrs. Stanford
arrived—and pandemonium reign
ed on campus.
To Supreme Court
Still the case had to be carried
to the United States Supreme
Court, where again a delay caused
uneasiness even among those who
had been most confident. For
months the decision was held in
abeyance, while Stanford's future
balanced precariously.
Finally, almost two years after
the suit was filed, a Palo Alto bus
driver brought in news of the vic
tory, and the celebration that fol
lowed made the first one seem
like nothing. Students took Presi
dent David Starr Jordan at his
word when he said they could "rio
anything but tear down the build
ings and paint the professors."
