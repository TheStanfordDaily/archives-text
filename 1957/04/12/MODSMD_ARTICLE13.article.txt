# Jordan Stages Walkout Over National Control
## Delegation Bases Action on Present Political Struggle 
### Anne Johnson Eve Eunson 
Jordan walked out of the Model
United Nations' Political and Se
curity Committee yesterday after
noon.
The Jordan representatives said
they left because they were un
certain which government is in
control in Jordan. Their action
was based on the struggle be
tween the King and the Prime
Minister which was actually go
ing on in Jordan yesterday.
The action came at the start of
the afternoon session when Lylo
McCullough, Portland State Col
lege student, requested three min
utes' time to explain his delega
tion's position.
The Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics used its veto three
times yesterday to kill MUN Se
curity Council resolutions.
Australian Resolution
The council spent the entire
morning debating Australia's res
olution to establish a directorate
to government administration of
the Suez Canal. Under its provi
sion, profits would go to Egypt
once the former Suez Canal Com
pany had been compensated. Aft
er three and a half hours of de
bate, the council voted. Ten of
the 11 countries were for the reso
lution, but Vic Hebert. USR
delegate from University of Cali
fornia, rose to announce that his
country vetoed the resolution
During the afternoon re
the U.S.S.R. vetoed a resolution
which censored Egypt for not giv
ing Israel "free and innocent" pas
sage through the Suez Canal and
which urged Egypt not to exercise
discrimination to certain nations
in the future.
Hebert again exercised his coun
try's right when he vetoed a reso
lution to set up a UN commission
to administer the Gaza strip.
Reversing the tables, the other
10 members of the council vetoed
a U.S.S.R. resolution to stop all
further consideration of questions
concerning Hungary.
Long Delay
After a long, long delay in get
ting started, the MUN Political
and Security Committee consid
ered and turned down five disar
mament proposals.
It passed two resolutions dur
ing the day. One would curtail
atomic tests in the Pacific insofar
as they threaten the lives of ci
vilians. No negative votes were
cast, but there were 15 absten

unanimously affirmed that geno
cide is a crime under international
law and asked that the Ad Hoc
committee recommend that I In*
