# UW Will Host Next Year's MUN Session
## 
### 
Model United Nations delega
tion chairmen yesterday selected
the University of Washington as
the host school for the 1958 ses
sion of the MUN.
"The support, of the student
body, university and community
behind MUN is probably greater
than at any other school," stated
Joe Schiebel, first vice-president
of the Associated Students of the
University of Washington.
"Washington has more than
adeqaute facilities for the meet
ing," continued Schiebel. "Com
mittee looms, eating facilities,
newspaper, library and. TV can
all be reached within Iwo minutes
from the center of campus."
Low-Cost Housing
From 2000 to 3000 delegates can
lie housed at the low cost of $15,
added another member of the
"Observing" delegation, a group
of four students (separate from
the school's Egyptian delegation)
who came to (he MUN to "see
that the University of Washing
lon was selected as host school."
All living facilities are only 10
minutes from campus.
For more than a year Univer
sity of Washington students have
been planning how they would
handle a MUN meeting. "Our sin
cere wish is that we can do as
fine a job as Stanford this year
and Oregon State last year," said
a spokesman for the group as he
thanked the Executive Committee
for Ills school's selection.
Compete for Honor
Both the University of Wash
ington and Washington Slate cam
paigned at this year's MUN ses
sion for the honor of being host
school next year. Displays were
posted throughout the campus ad
vertising the good aspects of each.
Following the election of the
1058 host, the Executive Commit
tee discussed a new system of se
lecting host schools for future
MUN sessions.
It was suggested that they
adopt a rotation program which
would divide the West into three
sections, with each furnishing a
host school once every three
years. In this way schools will
have the opportunity to prepare
for the assembly for two years,
instead of one.
A formal motion to eflect an
addition to the charter will be
made at this morning's Executive
Committee meeting.
