Latrine Sweepers
Editor, The Daily:
This Tuesday's Daily carried a letter by Her
bi-ri Mnderton which was captioned "Air Election
Philo -phy." 1 felt it was an interesting, if dis
turbing, letter- to read, touching as it did on an
Ue ill great pertinence to all students. I eagerly
.-waited Wednesday's Daily and.the spirited re
piic . that were sure to come, but, alas! Wednes
. v br ought only one letter —and that but: a refu-
I tin,i of only one application of one point in
i iii i or former student officials who object to
.vli . Rnderton's philosophy. Are there no candi
dates or former student officials who object to
I ing relegated to the rank of latrine sweepers?
'I l i. would seem rather 1 surprising. Such apathy!!
112 confess that my interest in student govern
rrient is rather limited, and 1 have often felt that
the ; reotest merit of campus politics lay in that
it performs the same function for "red hots" that
J'.'ew York's boys' clubs perform for potential
juvenile delinquents—it keeps them off the
t!ee'ts. Yet I do feel strongly about the issue of
voting and all its implications.
Admittedly we do not have the strongest of all
indent governments, nor are the issues of great
<• t importance, nor are the candidates for office
always of true leadership calibre. But this is
ecriainly no excuse for failing to select, or to
attempt to select, the best of what is available.
An election is never more or less than that. Mr.
Enderton says that "it should not be assumed
that apathy is a cancerous growth which spreads
ins'diously to affect everything." But what is the
continued acceptance of an ever degenerating
mediocrity if it is not an insidious, cancerous
growth that will eventually destroy what good
there is in student government and force out the
t a well qualified and genuinely interested peo
ple that still remain?
Mr. Enderton's prime complaint seems to be
P at ihere is a great deal of pressure by those
who desire to vote to inspire the apathetic (that.
those who staunchly refuse to generate a
• false interest") to vote. He seems to feel that
T who vote do so because of some "responsi
bil to.ward the general welfare" or because it
m; hes them a "more intelligent and alert stu
dents." Not at all. I must admit that I am a
rather selfish person; the "general welfare" is
important to me only insofar as I am included
in the "general." But since I have placed myself
■ 'i 'he society sub-group that is Stanford, 1 feel
,• i. • -nally obligated to make my position here
pleasant and beneficial as possible.
I would rather have good people looking out
(• I my.interests no matter' how weak the govern
ment and its effect on me. Quite often the ridicu
' us cavil that marks a campaign here causes me
f< el anything but more "intelligent and alert"
Iter having voted. However, I find it far more
atisfying to have acted to better my personal
.it the general welfare than to have allowed it
to degenerate even further through inaction. Nor
en I help but ieel irritated by those people whose
tudious inaction not only permits but causes it
to degenerate, and who justify their position by
rationalizations as gross and ridiculous as some
• the Campaign signs and speeches that periodi
cally rriar otherwise useful paper-.

On Being Careful
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps Mr. Connell ("Letters to the Editor,"
April 8) is correct in some of his comments
directed against "going boom," mere enthusiasm
■ 'bout just anything, and pure individualism for
ii own sake. Indeed, there is much to be said
for being "careful" in a world where interna
tional tensions are so high and dangers so great.
Yet 1 cannot help but feel that Mr. Connell was
dealing only with one interpretation of "careful."
A student can be careful in several ways. He
i an pause to think about the consequences of his
a< tions before making a choice, investigating ihe
Mei natives with care; this is commendable, for
furnishes a firmer and more reasonable basis
for action. Or a student can be so cautious, so
'.ireful, that he is afraid to act at all; afraid,
1 ' i haps, even to think critically for fear he might
b wrong or criticized. He can be careful to ihe
p. lint of becoming generally apathetic about
present-day problems, giving them only cursory
consideration without taking the time or trouble
to acquire adequate background material, taking
no positive action; in effect, withdrawing and
accepting, leaving the responsibility for domestic
nd international problems to others.
I am afraid that tire kind of carefulness which
i- generally present on our college campuses
toda> is not the kind which furnishes the basis

for firmer and more reasonable action, but for
no action and little creative thought.
No doubt the student of today can quite honest
ly say that he is enthusiastic "in a quiet and
growing way," and that he and his fellows are
"filled with emotion, a thousand ideas crossing
our minds" but about what is he enthusiastic?
What does he think about? How deep are his
thoughts? What background has he used for his
thoughts? Does he have more than inadequately
founded opinions on vital contemporary issues?
How well has hp prepared and investigated?
And when the American student says that "we
are waiting"—waiting for the time "when our
elders pass on their control and knowledge of
the powers for world destruction," waiting "to
*ee what kind of a world [if any] our parents
and their peers will leave us to deal with" just
what does he mean? Does he really believe in the
myth that suddenly the older generation passes
on its power to the younger generation? That
the younger generation does not already have a
stake in world affairs and some means of in
direct control (if only through ideas), and that
they do not now possess the '"knowledge of the
powers for world destruction" and need not he
thinking and doing something now?
The modern student may talk about the errors
of his parents' generation; he may feel his own
could do better. But if he were really careful,
would he not be spending more time in the
libraries doing research, more time in discussion
groups and idea sessions trying to assess the
causes of our domestic and world problems? If
he were really concerned, would he not be spend
ing more time trying to find new ways of solving
these problems, more time considering the impli
cations of present world changes, more time tell
ing other people that they ought to be concerned
and doing something too, rather than merely
waiting for someone else-to worry, to think and
to act?
If students loday were really careful, really
concerned, I am convinced they would be doing
and thinking more about the world and less about
their own prestige and their own fun. They
would not trust their parents' generation to leave
them a world; nor would they trust their own
to come into fuller power without an adequate
preparation which included some experience in
thinking and doing in terms of contemporary
problems. A few students may be really con
cerned and active, but only a few. The others
may be interested and concerned, but they do
not express it.
Carefulnes (of the kind Mr. Connell quite cor
rectly says can be of benefit to thp world) must
also include thinking things and doing things
which American students on Ihe whole are not
now thinking and doing. A commendable care
fulness demands more than waiting and hoping.
It involves a dynamic expression of interested
ness in the world. A student might at least be
actively and constructively careful, rather than
merely apathetically and neutrally so.

Aii Exp] anation
Editor, The Daily, and Judy Wharton:
The ASSU By-Laws Committee extends its
apology to Judy Wharton for not acknowledging
her letter written Feb. 2(5 to the committee.
Due to the intervention of spring vacation, the
committee has had only three working weeks to
consider this request. The letter was not ignored,
yet it could not be rushed through before the
present elections because the suggestion that all
Legislature representatives be elected by the
living areas early in fall quarter constitutes a
major change to Article 111 of the constitution.
An amendment to the constitution must, by Ar
ticle IX of the constitution, be submitted to Ihe
student body for final adoption.
Rather than amend the constitution in order
to meet this request by Florence Moore, an alter
native solution suggested by Maryce Brightman.
Women's How representative, is being considered
by the By-Laws Committee. This proposal sug
gests amending the Associated Women Students
standing rules so that exception will lie made to
the Florence Moore elected representative so that
she will not have to draw and will be able to
remain with her living group. Whether or not
the AWS will accept this proposal is another
question.
We hope this letter explains what is being done.
For many reasons, it was not possible to resolve
this request for election changes before the
spring elections.
