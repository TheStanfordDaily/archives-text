### Sallyanne Durr 
You're sitting in you r room
studying when the building begins
to shake. Books tumble from the
shelves; the plaster cracks. You
hesitate, blink and dash out in a
frenzy part of the panicked mob
congregating in the hall. There
is no order following the big
quake- -only complete chaos.
This chaos which usually fol
lows any catastrophe, man-made
or natural, can be averted by hav
ing someone in charge of restor
ing order, someone with whom
you would have to cooperate.
Stanford has a group to take
charge in the event of such ca
tastrophes the Disaster Commit

nation-wide Civil Defense pro

natural disasters as well as the
sudden explosion of war and air
