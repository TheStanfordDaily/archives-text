Evidence that smoking may in
crease the blood supply to the
eye was one of Ihe findings of a
group of Stanford Medical School
! ophthalmologists.
Stanford Department of Oph
j thalmology professors Dr. Je
| rome W. Bet t man and Dr. Victor
I Fellow and research assistant Dr.
Peter Chao drew this conclusion
from their continuing studies un
j dor a Public Health grant on fac
tors influencing the blood volume
I in the choroid and retina of the
| eye.
Their findings, although chief
ly based on laboratory animals,
I tend to*refute the common mis
| conception that smoking causes a
(constriction of the blood vessels
; of the eye and brain.
Another side discovery of this
I laboratory study revealed that
use of so-called filter cigarettes
made no appreciable difference in
blood supply to the choroid.
