# Stanford Med School Finds Secret Of Virus Infection in Metallic ‘Glue’
## 
### 
A metallic "glue" probably
holds the secret of virus infec
tion, new research at Stanford
Medical Schwol shows.
Traces of iron, copper, calcium
and magnesium have been dis
covered in tobacco mosaic virus
by Stanford biochemists. More
over, the iron and magnesium
are concentrated in the venom
ous nucleic acid core of the virus,
rather than in its protein shell.
Other investigators already

liave shown that virus' ability to
cause disease, including some
cancer, lies in its deadly core.
The work was reported in the
current (April .>i issue of Science
magazine by Professor Hubert S.
Loring of Stanford and a gradu
ate student assistant, Richard S.
Waritz. Support for the research
came trom the American Cancer
Society and the National Heart
Institute, U.S. Public Health
Service.
