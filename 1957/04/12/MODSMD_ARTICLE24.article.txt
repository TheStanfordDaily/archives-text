# S.F. Symphony Announces Change
## 
### 
The San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra management announces
a program change for today and
tomorrow because of an illness
forcing the cancellation of Hruno
Walter's appearance.
Knrique Jorda will conduct an
all performance of or
chestral excerpts from"The
of the Nihelungs" and the over
ture to "Tannhauser."
Tickets for the all-Wagner pro
grams are on sale at the Opera-
Symphony box office.
