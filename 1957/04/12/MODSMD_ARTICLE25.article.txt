# The 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
It's a good thing for Stanford that metropolitan track writers
aren't always right when it comes to picking the winner of a meet,
because an informal poll of four Southland and two Bay Area scribes
reveals a 5-0 vote in favor of USC winning Saturday's biggie with
Payton Jordan's Indians in Stanford Stadium. The Chronicle's Dar
rell Wilson didn't pick a winner either way, but at least said that a
Stanford victory, while improbable, wasn't impossible.
As might be expected, all four Los Angeles area writers- pre
dict a fair-sized victory for the Trojans. Charles Curtis of the Los
Angeles Times issued the most dire prediction for Stanford follow
ers when he write that "It seems likely the Trojans will score
upwards of 85 points, possibly more than 90."
Curtis says that Trojan coach Jess Mortensen wasn't going to
take any chances on having a close call as he did last week against
Occidental (USC won, Vfs) and planned to double his men
where possible in an attempt to score as many points as possible
against the Tribe.
This means that Max Truex and Sid Wing may both go in the
mile, with Truex doubling in the two-mile and Wing returning to
run the 880. If Mortensen does follow through with this plan, then
USC will score at least 20 of 27 possible points in the 880, mile and
two-mile, according to Curtis.
Harley Trnkhani of the Los Angeres Mirror-News and Rube
Samuelsen ot the Pasadena Star-News don't vee as one-sided a
meet as does Curtis. Tinkham dopes it 78-53 for the Trojans,
while Samuelsen has it 79-52.
Tinkham also expects Mortensen to double his distance aces, and
figures USC will outscore the Indians 25-2 in the three long races.
He has a qualification, however—"Stanford could make it close if
Maury Graves suddenly comes to life."
Stanford could also make it close if it can disprove Tinkham's
statement that "The Farm is fresh out of Sprinters." If Frank Herr
mann, Chuck Ince, Jim Easter, Leonard Bates, and Ben Anixter can
come through in the 100 and 220, Jordan's men would be in good
position. Even Southlander Tinkham admits that "Stanford could
win the meet by taking advantage of Troy's weakness in the dashes."
Samuelsen concedes six first places to Stanford—the 100, 440,
both hurdles, high jump and broad jump, and adds that they could
well take the relay. From this he concludes that "in the matter
of first places, the meet will be a wingding."
It's interesting that Samuelsen gives Stanford the 100, especially
after I inkham has just said Jordan doesn't have any sprinters.
Maybe, then, the Indians aren't so bad off after all and will be able
to take advantage of the USC sprint weaknesses.
Max Stiles, also of the Mirror-News and' considered one of the
world's foremost spike authorities, expects the Trojans to win by
about 77-54. Stiles expects Herrmann to win three events—broad
jump and BOTH SPRINTS. Things are looking up!
Stiles gives Bob Lawson a chance to win both hurdle races, but
all the Stanford dope sheets give these two races to Chuck Cobb.
He adds that Mortensen "expects Tom Anderson to win the 440."
This is at odds with the general consensus that Don Chesarek should
win. With these differences of .opinion among our friends to the
south, it would probably be possible to combine their selections into
a dope sheet that would give the Indians the victory.
The San Francisco Examiner's Don Selby expects "USC depth
to carry the day teamwise, but with the Indians making a better
showing than they have in years-." Selby writes that the critical
question is whether or not Chesarek can take the 440 and then
come back to crack into the point column in the half-mile.
, Selby adds that ' Regardless of whether' Stanford wins the meet
3 ve been impressed with the way Payton Jordan has the Indians
putting out more than they realized they had. I think he'll put Stan
ford back on the track and field map."
The consensus of the writers is that the discus and javelin will
both be fine field event battles. These are two of the critical events
for the Indians, with Fred Peters after first in the discus and Hank
Roldan gunning for a javelin victory.
Selby thinks Fred Peters will upset USC's Rink Babka in the
discus, but Curtis says that Babka's 174-11, if repeated will be
pretty tough for anyone to beat. Stiles looks for Babka to hit 180
leet. Nobody came up with a concrete prediction in the javelin
except to say that it would be tight among Roldan and the South
ern Cal duo ot Bob Voiles and Doug Maijala.
Personally, I think the. Indians can win. There's a good chance
if K W f g °/JT n to i he mile retey-at least my dope sheet
has it 63-b3 before that concluding event. Nearly every event is
critical, and there are a very small number of "sure things." Stan
ford will have to break up USC's strength in the 880 and will need
wins by Peters and Roldan. a
Jordan's men must score big in the hich iumn hrnpd i„mn
hurdles to offset USC power in the pole vault, mile and' two-mile
Its a mixed-up picture but the Indians are right in the middle of it
If they are to win, the Tribe will need plenty of support—not onlv
from each other, but from a large delegation of rooters, barren
Wilson probably summed the spectator situation up best when he
wrote that "Payton Jordan will have the Indians insnired for ,
efforts o their lives. If enough Stanford rooterf are on hand to giw
support, the cause will be aided greatly."
