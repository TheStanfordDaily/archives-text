# Diamond-Men Tangle With USC; Hope to Better 2-3 CIBA Mark
## 
### Bob Payne 
Dutch Fehring's heavy - hitting
varsity nine will be attempting to
get back into Ihe title chase and
al the same time sidetrack the
rampaging Southern California
Trojans in a pair of tilts this
weekend in Los Angeles.
Coach Rod Derleaux' defending
champions broke fast this season
and currently head the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion with a 6-1 record. The Tro
jans topped Stanford, 6-3, in the
rainsoaked season's opener and
the Cards now sport a 2-3 mark.
Payne to Start
Fehring has named right-hand
er Walt Payne as the starter for
this afternoon's game. The' Card
ace currently has a 2-2 record and
was impressive in downing Santa
Clara, 5-3, last Friday in his last
start.
Bob Leopold, the new left-hand
ed transfer from Stockton Col
lege, will be on the hill tomorrow.
Leopold pitched three innings of
Tuesday's San Jose State game,
showing a fine fast ball.
Dedeaux has a wealth of fine

pitchers to call on, headed by Ed
Isherwood, all - conference selec
tion last season. Other veteran
moundsmen are Jerry Parker
and Tony DeCarbo while there
are a number of fine sophomore
hurlers on the Trojan staff.
Potent Attacks
Despite the loss of a number
of the league's best hitters
through graduation, the Trojans
still have a potent batting at
tack. Outfielders Uill Olson and
Mike Hoeck have been the top
sluggers.
Hitting has been anything but
the weakness of the Tribe in re
cent games, but timely hitting
has presented the problem. In
last Saturday's game against
Santa Clara the Cards banged
out 12 safeties but could score
only three runs. Things were
considerably better Tuesday
against San Jose, with seven runs
on 14 hits, but there were still 13
Indians stranded on the bases.
The Cards have received a big
boost at the plate with the addi
tion of big Parker Olsen, a long
blasting outfielder from San Die
go JC. Olsen maintained his .500
mark with a single and a triple
in Tuesday's game and has been
installed in the cleanup slot by
Fehring after only three varsity
games.
Center fielder Bob Fletcher
boosted his average to an even
.400 with his 3-for-4 show against.
San Jose. Rudy Figueroa and Al
Shaw also fattened their marks
in the Spartan game, Figueroa
now boasting a .362 average and
Shaw a .340 mark.

pitchers to call on, headed by Ed
Isherwood, all - conference selec
tion last season. Other veteran
moundsmen are Jerry Parker
and Tony DeCarbo while there

Potent Attacks
Despite the loss of a number
of the league's best hitters
through graduation, the Trojans
still have a potent batting at
tack. Outfielders Uill Olson and
Mike Hoeck have been the top
sluggers.
Hitting has been anything but
the weakness of the Tribe in re
cent games, but timely hitting
has presented the problem. In
last Saturday's game against
Santa Clara the Cards banged
out 12 safeties but could score
only three runs. Things were
considerably better Tuesday
against San Jose, with seven runs
on 14 hits, but there were still 13
Indians stranded on the bases.
The Cards have received a big
boost at the plate with the addi
tion of big Parker Olsen, a long
blasting outfielder from San Die
go JC. Olsen maintained his .500
mark with a single and a triple
in Tuesday's game and has been
installed in the cleanup slot by
Fehring after only three varsity
games.
Center fielder Bob Fletcher
boosted his average to an even
.400 with his 3-for-4 show against.

Shaw also fattened their marks
in the Spartan game, Figueroa
now boasting a .362 average and
Shaw a .340 mark.

the Cards now sport a 2-3 mark.
Payne to Start
Fehring has named right-hand
er Walt Payne as the starter for
this afternoon's game. The' Card
ace currently has a 2-2 record and

Clara, 5-3, last Friday in his last
start.
