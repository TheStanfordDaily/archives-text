Bob Clark, last year's only soph
letterman, will row at the No. 4
position. A pair of juniors up
from last year's JV team, Will
Stinson and John Reichmann, will
row at the No. 7 and No. 2 posi
tions. Sophs Roald Engebreth and
Dick Draeger will round out the
lineup at the No. 6 and No. 5

The outlook for the team is
good this year. Lindsey notes that
"we have more power and depth
this year than I have ever seen
at Stanford."
With four new men in the shell,
Lindsey is anxious to see how the
new men will stand up under the
pressure of varsity competition.
USC is certain to supply this pres
sure, especially after they opened
their season last week with a
clean sweep over UCLA. The Tro
