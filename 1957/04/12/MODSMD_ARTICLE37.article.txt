THE PULSE-POUNDING SAGA OF
DE WITT CLINTON, AMERICAN
Let us today tifrn our eager young minds to the in
spiring story of De Witt Clinton, one of the greatest
figures in American history and — unaccountably — one
of the most neglected.

De Witt Clinton (sometimes called Aaron Burr) first
made himself known to fame in 1756 when Governor
William Penn commissioned him to survey the forests of
the Western Reserve. (One is inclined to wonder what in
the world Governor Penn could have been thinking of,
for De Witt Clinton was eighteen months old at the time.)
However, the little chap did remarkably well. He surveyed
as far west as Spokane, teaching phonetic English to
more than twelve million Indians along the way, and then,
tired but happy, he became Johnny Appleseed.
Later, he became a keelboat and sailed home to enter
politics. He tried to join the Greenback Party, but his
back wasn't green enough, so he joined the Whigs.
He was offered the Whig nomination for the presi
dency, but declined with the celebrated statement: "If
nominated I will not run; if elected I will not serve."
But the Whigs only nudged each other and said, "That
old fox, he's just playing hard to get." So they nominated
him anyhow, and sure enough he did not run, but he was
elected anyhow, and sure enough he did not serve. In
fact, he was elected to a second term, which he also did
not serve. However, only a few top Whigs knew there
was nobody in the White House. The rest of the country
thought that the President was confined to his room with
a wrenched knee. For a while people sent "Get Well"
cards, but soon everyone forgot and turned their atten
tion to important matters like opening the west, inventing
the buffalo, and the Black Tom Explosion.
After two terms as President, De Witt Clinton
entered Yale and took up smoking. He tried several
brands of cigarettes until he found the one brand that
pleased him in every particular—Philip Morris, of corris!
(You knew I was going to say that, didn't you? Well,
of course you did, especially if you are a Philip Morris
smoker, for if you are, you know what a sweetheart of a
smoke Philip Morris is — how full of rich, natural flavor,
how natural and mellow, how long size and regular. And
if you are not a Philip Morris smoker, you've got a treat
coming. Light one soon. Light either end.)
Upon graduation from Yale, De Witt Clinton became
commissioner of baseball and smoked and loved Philip
Morris Cigarettes for the rest of his long and distin
guished life, and when at last he was called to his reward,
his friend Old Hickory (Daniel Webster) stood up in the
Senate and said, "How sad that De Witt Clinton must
now be forever separated from his beloved Philip Morris!"
"Nay!" cried Pitt, the Elder (Henry Clay), bounding
to his feet. "We need not separate I)e Witt Clinton and
Philip Morris. I know how to keep them together always!"
And, sure enough, if you will look at the blue federal
tax stamp on your pack of Philip Morris, guess whose
picture you'll see. De Witt Clinton's! That's whose!
