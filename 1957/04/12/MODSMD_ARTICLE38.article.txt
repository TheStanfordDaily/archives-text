# Issues Facing Model UN
## 
### 
Genocide—killing of a group of
human beings will be discussed
in the International Court of Jus
tice and in the form of two reso
lutions before I he Security Coun
cil and the Social, Cultural and
Humanitarian and Ad Hoc Politi
cal committees in ihc Model Unit
ed Nations meetings.
The resolutions ask that geno
cide, being a crime under inter
national law, be investigated and
consequently punished in refer
ence to the Hungarian situation.
Unanimously adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948, the
Convention on Genocide declares
a crime any acts aimed at destroy
ing "a national, ethnical, racial or
religious group, as such," wheth
er in time of war or peace. People
guilty of genocide shall be tried
by the countries in which the ;fct
occurs or by international tribu
nals. The convention came into
force in 1951 and will be effective
for 10 years, and thereafter for
five-year periods in countries
which continue to adhere to it.
The United Kingdom delegation
at the Model United Nations here
(UCLA i has submitted a resolu
tion to be considered by both the
Security Council and the Ad Hoc-
Political Committee. It condemns
the U.S.S.R. for "barbaric action"
in Hungary and seeks formation
of a committee to investigate and
report the facts, as pertaining to
a violation of the Genocide Con
vention.
The other resolution, before the
Social, Cultural and Humanitari
an Committee, was proposed by
the Royal Kingdom of Laos and
Cambodia (Clark Junior College).
It asks that a committee be ap
pointed to "ascertain if the trials
of the Hungarian rebels are being
conducted according to the United
Nations charter. . . ."
Suez
The problem of the Suez Canal
will play a large part in the Model
United Nations committee and
council meetings today.
The story of Suez has been a

trail of unsuccessful negotiations.
The Canal Users' Association fail
ed to produce any solution to
President Nasser's nationalization
of the canal.
After the UN Security Council
debate failed lo provide any basis
for negotiation, representatives of
Egypt, 1-Vance and Britain met in
Secretary-General Dag llammar
skjold's office and worked out the
six principles on which they
agreed to negotiate. Only.the
method of "insulating" the canal
remained lo be worked out.
England and France suggested
the method proposed by the Lon
don conference. Egypt, backed by
Russia's veto in the Security
Council, refused.
Then on Oct. 29 Israel invaded
Egypt, and Britain and France
backed her up. A General Assem
bly vote of the United Nations
called on Ihe parties to stop hos
tilities. It then created the UN
Emergency Force, which moved
into the Suez on Nov. 15.
Since then the problem has been
one of truce violation claims by
both Egypt and Israel and Israel's
demands for freedom of passage
for its ships in the Gulf of Aqaba.
Kashmir
The state of Kashmir has been
a major dispute in the United
Nations since 1948.
When India received its free
dom from Great Britain, Pakistan
was created as an independent
state to the north of India. Kash
mir, which has a Hindu ruler
friendly to India and a Moslem
population friendly 1o Pakistan,
was given the right to choose
which country it wanted to join.
The country first united with
Pakistan, and then its ruler de
cided to have it become a part of
India. On Jan. 1, 19<18, India com
plained to the United Nations Se
curity Council that Pakistan was
conducting border raids on Kash
mir.
The council established a UN
commission to investigate.
On April 2 the Security Council
ordered all foreigners to with
draw from Kashmir, and drew up

plans to hold an election to deter
mine which country the Kash
miri inhabitants wanted to join.
India and Pakistan could not
agree on tlie withdrawal of troops
or how to conduct the election; so
plajis couldn't be carried through.
Similar resolutions calling for
a vote by the Kashmiri people
were passed by the Security Coun
cil in 1950 and 1951.
The Security Council voted 10-0,
with the Soviet Union abstaining,
to call for an open election in
Kashmir. India protested against
the vote and then went ahead
will] plans to annex.
The next move expected by Pak
istan is to ask some country to
support a resolution calling for
the United Nalions to move into
Kashmir.
Human liiglils
In 1947 the Commission on Hu
man Rights begaji to draw up an
international bill of rights which
was to include a declaration of
general principles, a covenant to
define specific rights and the
measures of implementation.
The Declarat ion of Human
Rights was adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly in
1948. Six years later the commis
sion finished drawing up the two
covenants: the covenant on civil
and political rights, and the cove
nant on economic, social and cul
tural rights. .
The two covenants epitomize
every aspect of the individual and
his society. They include the in
dividual's right to work under
good conditions and fair wages
and the right to join trade unions;
the right to education; the right
to life, 1o freedom from torture
and slavery, to liberty and secu
rity for the individual; and other
basic rights. Most important, the
family and not the state is recog
nized as the natural and funda
mental group unit of the society.
Opposition to the covenants oc
curs because of differing legal
systems, .social philosophies, cul
tural traditions and economic con
cepts.
All nations except the United
States and the abstaining nations
of ihe Union of South Africa have
voted acceptance of the proposed
preamble.
Russia and her Soviet bloc have
voted in favor of the preamble
and Article I of the covenant, in
opposition to the United States.
The Model United Nations, like
that of the authentic United Na
tions, will attempt to define, cod
ify and organize into documents
of international responsibility the
rights of the covenants.
Trusteeship
Jordan has proposed a resolu
tion to the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly which, if passed,
would bring all non-independent
territories under the UN trustee
ship program. This would include
such areas as Morocco, West New
Guinea and Cyprus, which are
presently administered outside of
UN jurisdiction..
The resolution is supported by
the Arab-Asian bloc in line with
their anti-colonial stand.
Colonial powers such as France
and the Netherlands are opposing
the resolution. They argue that
under their governance these non
independent areas are raising the
standards of living and are ad
vancing as quickly as is possible.
This question will come before
MUN Trusteeship Council in
Bowman Alumni House.

Human liiglils
In 1947 the Commission on Hu
man Rights begaji to draw up an
international bill of rights which
was to include a declaration of
general principles, a covenant to
define specific rights and the
measures of implementation.
The Declarat ion of Human
Rights was adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly in
1948. Six years later the commis
sion finished drawing up the two
covenants: the covenant on civil
and political rights, and the cove
nant on economic, social and cul
tural rights. .
The two covenants epitomize
every aspect of the individual and
his society. They include the in
dividual's right to work under
good conditions and fair wages
and the right to join trade unions;
the right to education; the right
to life, 1o freedom from torture
and slavery, to liberty and secu
rity for the individual; and other
basic rights. Most important, the
family and not the state is recog
nized as the natural and funda
mental group unit of the society.
Opposition to the covenants oc
curs because of differing legal
systems, .social philosophies, cul
tural traditions and economic con
cepts.
All nations except the United
States and the abstaining nations
of ihe Union of South Africa have
voted acceptance of the proposed
preamble.
Russia and her Soviet bloc have
voted in favor of the preamble
and Article I of the covenant, in
opposition to the United States.
The Model United Nations, like
that of the authentic United Na
tions, will attempt to define, cod
ify and organize into documents
of international responsibility the
rights of the covenants.
Trusteeship
Jordan has proposed a resolu
tion to the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly which, if passed,
would bring all non-independent
territories under the UN trustee
ship program. This would include
such areas as Morocco, West New
Guinea and Cyprus, which are
presently administered outside of
UN jurisdiction..
The resolution is supported by
the Arab-Asian bloc in line with
their anti-colonial stand.
Colonial powers such as France
and the Netherlands are opposing
the resolution. They argue that
under their governance these non
independent areas are raising the
standards of living and are ad
vancing as quickly as is possible.
This question will come before
MUN Trusteeship Council in
Bowman Alumni House.
Genocide—killing of a group of
human beings will be discussed
in the International Court of Jus
tice and in the form of two reso
lutions before I he Security Coun
cil and the Social, Cultural and
Humanitarian and Ad Hoc Politi
cal committees in ihc Model Unit
ed Nations meetings.
The resolutions ask that geno
cide, being a crime under inter
national law, be investigated and
consequently punished in refer
ence to the Hungarian situation.
Unanimously adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948, the
Convention on Genocide declares
a crime any acts aimed at destroy
ing "a national, ethnical, racial or
religious group, as such," wheth
er in time of war or peace. People
guilty of genocide shall be tried
by the countries in which the ;fct
occurs or by international tribu
nals. The convention came into
force in 1951 and will be effective
for 10 years, and thereafter for
five-year periods in countries
which continue to adhere to it.
The United Kingdom delegation
at the Model United Nations here
(UCLA i has submitted a resolu
tion to be considered by both the
Security Council and the Ad Hoc-
Political Committee. It condemns
the U.S.S.R. for "barbaric action"
in Hungary and seeks formation
of a committee to investigate and
report the facts, as pertaining to
a violation of the Genocide Con
vention.
The other resolution, before the
Social, Cultural and Humanitari
an Committee, was proposed by
the Royal Kingdom of Laos and
Cambodia (Clark Junior College).
It asks that a committee be ap
pointed to "ascertain if the trials
of the Hungarian rebels are being
conducted according to the United
Nations charter. . . ."
Suez
The problem of the Suez Canal
will play a large part in the Model
United Nations committee and
council meetings today.
The story of Suez has been a

trail of unsuccessful negotiations.
The Canal Users' Association fail
ed to produce any solution to
President Nasser's nationalization
of the canal.
After the UN Security Council
debate failed lo provide any basis
for negotiation, representatives of
Egypt, 1-Vance and Britain met in
Secretary-General Dag llammar
skjold's office and worked out the
six principles on which they
agreed to negotiate. Only.the
method of "insulating" the canal
remained lo be worked out.
England and France suggested
the method proposed by the Lon
don conference. Egypt, backed by
Russia's veto in the Security
Council, refused.
Then on Oct. 29 Israel invaded
Egypt, and Britain and France
backed her up. A General Assem
bly vote of the United Nations
called on Ihe parties to stop hos
tilities. It then created the UN
Emergency Force, which moved
into the Suez on Nov. 15.
Since then the problem has been
one of truce violation claims by
both Egypt and Israel and Israel's
demands for freedom of passage
for its ships in the Gulf of Aqaba.
Kashmir
The state of Kashmir has been
a major dispute in the United

was created as an independent

mir, which has a Hindu ruler
friendly to India and a Moslem
population friendly 1o Pakistan,
was given the right to choose
which country it wanted to join.
The country first united with
Pakistan, and then its ruler de
cided to have it become a part of
India. On Jan. 1, 19<18, India com
plained to the United Nations Se
curity Council that Pakistan was
conducting border raids on Kash
mir.
The council established a UN
commission to investigate.
On April 2 the Security Council
ordered all foreigners to with
draw from Kashmir, and drew up

plans to hold an election to deter
mine which country the Kash
miri inhabitants wanted to join.
India and Pakistan could not
agree on tlie withdrawal of troops
or how to conduct the election; so
plajis couldn't be carried through.
Similar resolutions calling for
a vote by the Kashmiri people

the Royal Kingdom of Laos and
Cambodia (Clark Junior College).
It asks that a committee be ap
pointed to "ascertain if the trials
of the Hungarian rebels are being
conducted according to the United

Suez
The problem of the Suez Canal
will play a large part in the Model
United Nations committee and
council meetings today.
The story of Suez has been a

trail of unsuccessful negotiations.
The Canal Users' Association fail
ed to produce any solution to
President Nasser's nationalization
of the canal.
After the UN Security Council
debate failed lo provide any basis
for negotiation, representatives of
Egypt, 1-Vance and Britain met in
Secretary-General Dag llammar
skjold's office and worked out the
six principles on which they
agreed to negotiate. Only.the
method of "insulating" the canal
remained lo be worked out.
England and France suggested
the method proposed by the Lon
don conference. Egypt, backed by
Russia's veto in the Security
Council, refused.
Then on Oct. 29 Israel invaded
Egypt, and Britain and France
backed her up. A General Assem
bly vote of the United Nations
called on Ihe parties to stop hos
tilities. It then created the UN
Emergency Force, which moved
into the Suez on Nov. 15.
Since then the problem has been
one of truce violation claims by
both Egypt and Israel and Israel's
demands for freedom of passage
for its ships in the Gulf of Aqaba.
Kashmir
The state of Kashmir has been
a major dispute in the United
Nations since 1948.
When India received its free
dom from Great Britain, Pakistan
was created as an independent
state to the north of India. Kash
mir, which has a Hindu ruler
friendly to India and a Moslem
population friendly 1o Pakistan,
was given the right to choose
which country it wanted to join.
The country first united with
Pakistan, and then its ruler de
cided to have it become a part of
India. On Jan. 1, 19<18, India com
plained to the United Nations Se
curity Council that Pakistan was
conducting border raids on Kash
mir.
The council established a UN
commission to investigate.
On April 2 the Security Council
ordered all foreigners to with
draw from Kashmir, and drew up

plans to hold an election to deter
mine which country the Kash
miri inhabitants wanted to join.
India and Pakistan could not
agree on tlie withdrawal of troops
or how to conduct the election; so
plajis couldn't be carried through.
Similar resolutions calling for
a vote by the Kashmiri people
were passed by the Security Coun
cil in 1950 and 1951.
The Security Council voted 10-0,
with the Soviet Union abstaining,
to call for an open election in
Kashmir. India protested against
the vote and then went ahead
will] plans to annex.
The next move expected by Pak
istan is to ask some country to
support a resolution calling for
the United Nalions to move into
Kashmir.
Human liiglils
In 1947 the Commission on Hu
man Rights begaji to draw up an
international bill of rights which
was to include a declaration of
general principles, a covenant to
define specific rights and the
measures of implementation.
The Declarat ion of Human
Rights was adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly in
1948. Six years later the commis
sion finished drawing up the two
covenants: the covenant on civil
and political rights, and the cove
nant on economic, social and cul
tural rights. .
The two covenants epitomize
every aspect of the individual and
his society. They include the in
dividual's right to work under
good conditions and fair wages
and the right to join trade unions;
the right to education; the right
to life, 1o freedom from torture
and slavery, to liberty and secu
rity for the individual; and other
basic rights. Most important, the
family and not the state is recog
nized as the natural and funda
mental group unit of the society.
Opposition to the covenants oc
curs because of differing legal
systems, .social philosophies, cul
tural traditions and economic con
cepts.
All nations except the United
States and the abstaining nations
of ihe Union of South Africa have
voted acceptance of the proposed
preamble.
Russia and her Soviet bloc have
voted in favor of the preamble
and Article I of the covenant, in
opposition to the United States.
The Model United Nations, like
that of the authentic United Na

ify and organize into documents
of international responsibility the
rights of the covenants.
Trusteeship
Jordan has proposed a resolu
tion to the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly which, if passed,
would bring all non-independent
territories under the UN trustee
ship program. This would include
such areas as Morocco, West New
Guinea and Cyprus, which are
presently administered outside of
UN jurisdiction..
The resolution is supported by
the Arab-Asian bloc in line with
their anti-colonial stand.
Colonial powers such as France
and the Netherlands are opposing
the resolution. They argue that
under their governance these non
independent areas are raising the
standards of living and are ad
vancing as quickly as is possible.
This question will come before
MUN Trusteeship Council in
Bowman Alumni House.
Genocide—killing of a group of
human beings will be discussed
in the International Court of Jus
tice and in the form of two reso
lutions before I he Security Coun
cil and the Social, Cultural and
Humanitarian and Ad Hoc Politi
cal committees in ihc Model Unit
ed Nations meetings.
The resolutions ask that geno
cide, being a crime under inter
national law, be investigated and
consequently punished in refer
ence to the Hungarian situation.
Unanimously adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948, the
Convention on Genocide declares
a crime any acts aimed at destroy
ing "a national, ethnical, racial or
religious group, as such," wheth
er in time of war or peace. People
guilty of genocide shall be tried
by the countries in which the ;fct
occurs or by international tribu
nals. The convention came into
force in 1951 and will be effective
for 10 years, and thereafter for
five-year periods in countries
which continue to adhere to it.
The United Kingdom delegation
at the Model United Nations here
(UCLA i has submitted a resolu

Security Council and the Ad Hoc-
Political Committee. It condemns
the U.S.S.R. for "barbaric action"
in Hungary and seeks formation
of a committee to investigate and
report the facts, as pertaining to
a violation of the Genocide Con

The other resolution, before the
Social, Cultural and Humanitari

tural traditions and economic con
cepts.
All nations except the United
States and the abstaining nations
of ihe Union of South Africa have
voted acceptance of the proposed
preamble.
Russia and her Soviet bloc have
voted in favor of the preamble
and Article I of the covenant, in
opposition to the United States.
The Model United Nations, like
that of the authentic United Na
tions, will attempt to define, cod
ify and organize into documents
of international responsibility the
rights of the covenants.
Trusteeship
Jordan has proposed a resolu
tion to the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly which, if passed,
would bring all non-independent
territories under the UN trustee
ship program. This would include
such areas as Morocco, West New
Guinea and Cyprus, which are
presently administered outside of
UN jurisdiction..
The resolution is supported by
the Arab-Asian bloc in line with
their anti-colonial stand.
Colonial powers such as France
and the Netherlands are opposing
the resolution. They argue that
under their governance these non
independent areas are raising the
standards of living and are ad
vancing as quickly as is possible.
This question will come before
MUN Trusteeship Council in
Bowman Alumni House.
Genocide—killing of a group of
human beings will be discussed
in the International Court of Jus
tice and in the form of two reso
lutions before I he Security Coun
cil and the Social, Cultural and
Humanitarian and Ad Hoc Politi
cal committees in ihc Model Unit
ed Nations meetings.
The resolutions ask that geno
cide, being a crime under inter
national law, be investigated and
consequently punished in refer
ence to the Hungarian situation.
Unanimously adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948, the
Convention on Genocide declares
a crime any acts aimed at destroy
ing "a national, ethnical, racial or
religious group, as such," wheth
er in time of war or peace. People
guilty of genocide shall be tried
by the countries in which the ;fct
occurs or by international tribu
nals. The convention came into
force in 1951 and will be effective
for 10 years, and thereafter for
five-year periods in countries
which continue to adhere to it.
The United Kingdom delegation
at the Model United Nations here
(UCLA i has submitted a resolu
tion to be considered by both the
Security Council and the Ad Hoc-
Political Committee. It condemns
the U.S.S.R. for "barbaric action"
in Hungary and seeks formation
of a committee to investigate and
report the facts, as pertaining to
a violation of the Genocide Con
vention.
The other resolution, before the
Social, Cultural and Humanitari
an Committee, was proposed by
the Royal Kingdom of Laos and
Cambodia (Clark Junior College).
It asks that a committee be ap
pointed to "ascertain if the trials
of the Hungarian rebels are being
conducted according to the United
Nations charter. . . ."
Suez
The problem of the Suez Canal
will play a large part in the Model
United Nations committee and
council meetings today.
The story of Suez has been a

trail of unsuccessful negotiations.
The Canal Users' Association fail
ed to produce any solution to
President Nasser's nationalization
of the canal.
After the UN Security Council
debate failed lo provide any basis
for negotiation, representatives of
Egypt, 1-Vance and Britain met in
Secretary-General Dag llammar
skjold's office and worked out the
six principles on which they
agreed to negotiate. Only.the
method of "insulating" the canal
remained lo be worked out.
England and France suggested
the method proposed by the Lon
don conference. Egypt, backed by
Russia's veto in the Security
Council, refused.
Then on Oct. 29 Israel invaded
Egypt, and Britain and France
backed her up. A General Assem
bly vote of the United Nations
called on Ihe parties to stop hos
tilities. It then created the UN
Emergency Force, which moved
into the Suez on Nov. 15.
Since then the problem has been
one of truce violation claims by
both Egypt and Israel and Israel's
demands for freedom of passage
for its ships in the Gulf of Aqaba.
Kashmir
The state of Kashmir has been
a major dispute in the United
Nations since 1948.
When India received its free
dom from Great Britain, Pakistan
was created as an independent
state to the north of India. Kash
mir, which has a Hindu ruler
friendly to India and a Moslem
population friendly 1o Pakistan,
was given the right to choose
which country it wanted to join.
The country first united with
Pakistan, and then its ruler de
cided to have it become a part of
India. On Jan. 1, 19<18, India com
plained to the United Nations Se
curity Council that Pakistan was
conducting border raids on Kash
mir.
The council established a UN
commission to investigate.
On April 2 the Security Council
ordered all foreigners to with
draw from Kashmir, and drew up

plans to hold an election to deter
mine which country the Kash
miri inhabitants wanted to join.
India and Pakistan could not
agree on tlie withdrawal of troops
or how to conduct the election; so
plajis couldn't be carried through.
Similar resolutions calling for
a vote by the Kashmiri people
were passed by the Security Coun
cil in 1950 and 1951.
The Security Council voted 10-0,
with the Soviet Union abstaining,
to call for an open election in
Kashmir. India protested against
the vote and then went ahead
will] plans to annex.
The next move expected by Pak
istan is to ask some country to
support a resolution calling for
the United Nalions to move into
Kashmir.
Human liiglils
In 1947 the Commission on Hu
man Rights begaji to draw up an
international bill of rights which
was to include a declaration of
general principles, a covenant to
define specific rights and the
measures of implementation.
The Declarat ion of Human
Rights was adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly in
1948. Six years later the commis
sion finished drawing up the two
covenants: the covenant on civil
and political rights, and the cove
nant on economic, social and cul
tural rights. .
The two covenants epitomize
every aspect of the individual and
his society. They include the in
dividual's right to work under
good conditions and fair wages
and the right to join trade unions;
the right to education; the right
to life, 1o freedom from torture
and slavery, to liberty and secu
rity for the individual; and other
basic rights. Most important, the
family and not the state is recog
nized as the natural and funda
mental group unit of the society.
Opposition to the covenants oc
curs because of differing legal
systems, .social philosophies, cul
tural traditions and economic con
cepts.
All nations except the United
States and the abstaining nations
of ihe Union of South Africa have
