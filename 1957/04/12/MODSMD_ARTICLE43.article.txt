## 
### 
In the Ihirrl ease tried before the MUN International Court of
Just ire yesterday, the Unit ed Kingdom asked the court to rule that
the arlions of Janos Kadar, Perene Muennirk and Gyorgy Marosan
in putting down rebellion in Hungary are genocidal in nature.
Counsel for the United Kingdom explained that his country felt

there is nothing wrong with I ey
ing to put down rebellion, but
that there are two different ways
of doing it -genocidal and by a
civilized means.
A court decision in favor of the
j Ulifted Kingdom's charges would,
according to tin' counsel, prove
these three men are guilty of
genocide and would brand iliem
as such before I he world.
Counsel for Hungary said il
was unfortunate so many people
had been shot in Hungary, but
that the actions were not genoci
dal because they did not involve
racial, ethnical or religious dis
crimination.
The court's decision will be
given today at 1 p.m., before Ihe
day's proceedings begin.
Today's schdule of cases will
include the Anglo-Iranian oil case,
Poland vs. U.S. advisory opinion,
Israel vs. Egypt and Colombia vs.
Peru, if there is time.
Netherlands, in the first case
tried yesterday, requested an ad
visory opinion as to what consti
tutes air spaci 1 . The court ruled
that the decision is up to the In
ternational Civil Aeronautics Or
ganizalion, and referred the ease
to it.
