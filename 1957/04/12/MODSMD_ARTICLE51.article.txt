# INFORMED PUBLIC OPINION
## UN 						Education Director: MUN Way to Appreciate Problems 
### 
The most valuable experience
students can gain from the Model
United Nations is "a beginning
appreciation of the kinds of prob
lems the United Nations has to
face and the knowledge that they
can be aired in a world forum,"
according to Dr. William Bruce,
i hlef of the UN Education Sec
tion.
Following a discussion with fac
u I I y members yesterday after
noon on the problems involved
with a model Unite I Nations, Dr.
Bruee commented that such a
model group does the same thing
which his office is attempting to
do that is "to create a basis for
an informed public opinion."
Answers a Need
The Education Section of the
UN answers a deed which was
created by a mandate from the
General Assembly calling on I'lie
member governments to intro
duce a program info thCr schools
to inform students about the
.structure and function of the UN.
One of the most important
things students need to realize
about the UN, Dr. Bruee explain
ed, is thai it only airs problems
and make ; recommendations.
There is no force or control in
volved. But 1 his expression of a
consensus of opinions of nations
is the most valuable aspect of
the UN.
"Either we must have ihe UN
or something better, or face a con
stant threat," said Dr. Bruee.
At S.F. Conference
An assistant professor of politi
cal science at Stanford from 1935
to 19-12, Dr. Bruce helped to or
ganize the original San Francisco
conference of the United Nations.
He has been affiliated with Ihe
UN since its inception.
Dr. Bruce pointed out Ihat
there are probably thousands of
Model UN's in the United States

today, mostly on the secondary
school level. In addition, the Uni
versity of Geneva in Lausanne,
Switzerland, is noted for its mod
el group and several Model Unit
ed Nations are being organized in
India and Pakistan.
Two suggestions he offered for
improvement of future MUN con
ferences involved organization.
The agendas, he said, need to be
simplified to eliminate procedural
resolutions, and there is a definite
need for a headquarter?: a home
for the group.
If meeting places were around
a central location, he said, pro
codural problems could be ironed
oir by the delegate.; outside II;:-
meetings, in informal discussions
.just like the real I IN.
