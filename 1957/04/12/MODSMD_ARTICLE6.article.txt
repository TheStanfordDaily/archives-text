# Spikers After 1st Win Over USC Since '33
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Hard workouts of the past week
are over, and there remains only
the waiting before Stanford and
Southern California square off
tomorrow at 1:30 in Stanford Sta
dium. The track meet is expected
could bring the Indians their first
victory over the Trojans since
1933.
Strange as it may seem, Stan
ford leads in the over-all series,
with 20 victories to USC's 25. The
Tribe won the first 22 in a row,
and then the teams split in the
next six meets. USC has now won
21 in succession.
Indians Primed
Pay ton Jordan has been prim

1956 U.S. Olympic team, will go
in both the mile and two-mile.
It will be the job of the Indian
milers to do their best to wear
down Truex in the shorter race in
order to have him at less than
peak efficiency for the longer
grind. Truex is not noted for his
ability to double successfully, and
could be strongly pressed by the
Indians' Maury Graves if lie is
forced to go all out in the mile.
Wing will also have to be press
ed by the Indians in the mile if
he is to be shui out in the hall
mile. Wing seems a likely win
nor in the mile and will he doing
his best to win it in as slow a
time as possible.
