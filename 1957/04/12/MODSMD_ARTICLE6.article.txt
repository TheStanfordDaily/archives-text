# Spikers After 1st Win Over USC Since '33
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Hard workouts of the past week
are over, and there remains only
the waiting before Stanford and
Southern California square off
tomorrow at 1:30 in Stanford Sta
dium. The track meet is expected
could bring the Indians their first
victory over the Trojans since
1933.
Strange as it may seem, Stan
ford leads in the over-all series,
with 20 victories to USC's 25. The
Tribe won the first 22 in a row,
and then the teams split in the
next six meets. USC has now won
21 in succession.
Indians Primed
Pay ton Jordan has been prim
ing his Indians all week, and in
fact all season, for this meet. He
isn't picking a winner, but says
that "we never go into a meet
thinking we can't win."
USC's close squeak against Oc
cidental last week may have jolted
Jess Mortensen into thinking his
team could lose to Jordan's scrap
py Tribe. Whether this is the
reason or not, Mortensen has sud
denly decided to double with his
distance men and switch his 410
and 880 runners.
Double Duty
Sid Wing and Max Truex, Iwo
of the nation's finest long-distance
men, are propping for double
duty. Truex, a member of the
1956 U.S. Olympic team, will go
in both the mile and two-mile.
It will be the job of the Indian
milers to do their best to wear
down Truex in the shorter race in
order to have him at less than
peak efficiency for the longer
grind. Truex is not noted for his
ability to double successfully, and
could be strongly pressed by the
Indians' Maury Graves if lie is
forced to go all out in the mile.
Wing will also have to be press
ed by the Indians in the mile if
he is to be shui out in the hall
mile. Wing seems a likely win
nor in the mile and will he doing
his best to win it in as slow a
time as possible.
Tom Anderson is also the sub
ject of Mortensen brain-storming.
Regularly an 880 man, he now
seems certain to go in the 440 and
is doubtful for the half-mile. He
is being switched to the one-lap
per to give Stanford's Don Ches
arek a battle, and Mortensen is
confident his man can win.
Murray Cockburn, the leading
USC 440 man, may be switched
to the 880 in another of what
Mortensen hopes will be winning
moves. There is also the possi
bility that Cockburn will double,
but this does not seem too likely.
No Big Switches
Jordan isn't worrying about a
lot of last-minute switches of his
Indians, so the team alignment
will remain pretty much the same
as it has been most of the season.
Excluding relay duty, Stanford
will probably have seven men
doubling and two tripling. The
latter pair are co-captain Frank
Herrmann and PCC hurdle champ
Bernie Nelson.
Herrmann will be entered in
both sprints and the broad .jump
and stands a good chance to take
first place in all three events.
Nelson will go in both hurdle
races and will try to help the
Tribe to a sweep in the high jump.
Best Hurdler
Another entrant in both hurdles
is Chuck Cobb, a junior and the
top Stanford hurdler this season.
Leonard Bates will go in the lows
and the 100.
Probably the day's most diffi
cult double at any rate the long
est will be done by Maury
Graves as he runs in both the
mile and the two-mile.
Don Chesarek and Chuck Ince
will both run the 440, with Ches
arek also moving up to the 880
and Ince down to the 220. Ray
Williamson and Archie Schmitt
will each throw the discus and
put the shot.

are over, and there remains only
the waiting before Stanford and
Southern California square off
tomorrow at 1:30 in Stanford Sta
dium. The track meet is expected
could bring the Indians their first
victory over the Trojans since
1933.
Strange as it may seem, Stan
ford leads in the over-all series,
with 20 victories to USC's 25. The
Tribe won the first 22 in a row,
and then the teams split in the
next six meets. USC has now won
21 in succession.
Indians Primed
Pay ton Jordan has been prim
ing his Indians all week, and in
fact all season, for this meet. He
isn't picking a winner, but says
that "we never go into a meet
thinking we can't win."
USC's close squeak against Oc
cidental last week may have jolted
Jess Mortensen into thinking his
team could lose to Jordan's scrap
py Tribe. Whether this is the
reason or not, Mortensen has sud
denly decided to double with his
distance men and switch his 410
and 880 runners.
Double Duty
Sid Wing and Max Truex, Iwo
of the nation's finest long-distance
men, are propping for double
duty. Truex, a member of the
1956 U.S. Olympic team, will go
in both the mile and two-mile.
It will be the job of the Indian
milers to do their best to wear
down Truex in the shorter race in
order to have him at less than
peak efficiency for the longer
grind. Truex is not noted for his
ability to double successfully, and
could be strongly pressed by the
Indians' Maury Graves if lie is
forced to go all out in the mile.
Wing will also have to be press
ed by the Indians in the mile if
he is to be shui out in the hall
mile. Wing seems a likely win
nor in the mile and will he doing
his best to win it in as slow a
time as possible.
Tom Anderson is also the sub
ject of Mortensen brain-storming.
Regularly an 880 man, he now
seems certain to go in the 440 and
is doubtful for the half-mile. He
is being switched to the one-lap
per to give Stanford's Don Ches
arek a battle, and Mortensen is
confident his man can win.
Murray Cockburn, the leading
USC 440 man, may be switched
to the 880 in another of what
Mortensen hopes will be winning
moves. There is also the possi
bility that Cockburn will double,
but this does not seem too likely.
No Big Switches
Jordan isn't worrying about a
lot of last-minute switches of his
Indians, so the team alignment
will remain pretty much the same
as it has been most of the season.
Excluding relay duty, Stanford
will probably have seven men
doubling and two tripling. The
latter pair are co-captain Frank
Herrmann and PCC hurdle champ
Bernie Nelson.
Herrmann will be entered in
both sprints and the broad .jump
and stands a good chance to take
first place in all three events.
Nelson will go in both hurdle
races and will try to help the
Tribe to a sweep in the high jump.
Best Hurdler
Another entrant in both hurdles
is Chuck Cobb, a junior and the
top Stanford hurdler this season.
Leonard Bates will go in the lows
and the 100.
Probably the day's most diffi
cult double at any rate the long
est will be done by Maury
Graves as he runs in both the
mile and the two-mile.
Don Chesarek and Chuck Ince
will both run the 440, with Ches
arek also moving up to the 880
and Ince down to the 220. Ray
Williamson and Archie Schmitt
will each throw the discus and
put the shot.
