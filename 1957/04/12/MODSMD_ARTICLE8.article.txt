### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 11 (UP)—Demonstrations erupted in
tense Jordan today in protest against young King Hussein's dis
missal of leftist Premier Suleiman Nabulsi. The pro-Western
king's police were reported rounding up all known Communists to
prevent any .flare-up that could topple his thrown.
A three-way tug of *war—involving Syria, Saudi Arabia and
Iraq—was threatening to tear the little Middle East nation apart
with Israel poised to grab half the country in event other Arab
states try to partition Hussein's troubled kingdom.
But Western diplomats and Israeli sources doubted the present
crisis would degenerate to the point of open warfare.
Thousands of Palstinian Arabs demonstrated today in the
streets of Nablus, the chief Jordanian town west of the Jordan
River, where pro-Egyptian sentiment is strongest.
Schools and shops closed while the demonstrators marched
through the streets calling for reinstatement of Nabulsi, fired yes
terday by the king after months of tension over his government's
leftist alignment and extreme pro-Egyptian views.
The demonstrators carried anti-Western and pro-Nabulsi ban
ners but no serious incidents were reported.
At the same time, the 22-year-old king called on former Foreign
Minister Hussein Khalidi to form a new government to replace
the six-month-old Nabulsi regime.
Khalidi immediately began talks with political leaders but diplo
matic circles in Amman doubted he would succeed in forming a
cabinet.
A report from the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem said Khalidi
declined to form a cabinet after failing to get support. Three of
Nabulsi's coalition partners the Socialists, the Baath Socialists
and the National Front—had decided in a meeting to boycott the
proposed new cabinet.
