# Special General Assembly Session Called Tomorrow
## U.S. Proposal on Internationalization Of Waterways to Be Topic for Debate 
### 
An "extraordinary session" of Model United Nations General As
sembly will be held tomorrow afternoon about 4 in Memorial Audi
toiium to discuss the United States proposal on the internationaliza
tion of waterways.
"This meeting will be limited to one and one-half hours late to

morrow afternoon and, unlike the
regular General Assembly, will
be opened to debate from the
floor," said Secretary - General
Chuck Reynolds at the conclu
sion of yesterday's activities.
At an executive meeting the
motion was made to have the res
olution proposed by the U.S. in
troduced by the Secretary-Gen
eral.
Briefly, the resolution suggests
that a commission composed of
representatives from Australia,
Iceland, Cambodia, Lebanon,
Luxembourg, Mexico and Peru,
to be known as the Commission
of International Waterways, be
formed to make a study of the
feasibility of internationalizing
waterways.
Reason for Resolution
The resolution was suggested
because of recent technological
advances which have made an in
creasing volume of continuous
trade among all nations of the
world a necessity.
The U.S. delegation, from Ore
gon State, believes waterways
universally accepted as having
international character are a ne
cessity to continued unimpaired
passage of ships of all nations.
The committee would pay spe
cial attention to the economic and
administrative effects of such in
ternationalization. It would sub
mit a report to the Secretariat
one month previous to the next
session of MUN and the topic of
internationalization of waterways
would be on the agenda for the
session.
U.S. Stand
The U.S. delegation is not go
ing on record as favoring interna
tionalization of the Panama Ca
nal. It wants U) initiate a study.
Concerning MUN as a whole,
Reynolds said, "I have been very
pleased with (he tone of satisfac
tion which the delegates express
with I lie way the many meetings
have been progressing. From my
observations of two of the meet
ings, the majority of delegates
have studied the Issues until they
are now able to speak with au
thority in representing their na
tion.
"I am only disappointed in that
more Stanford students have not
taken advantage of this oppor
tunity to study world affairs first
hand.
"An officer of the Brifish Con
sulate remarked this morning
that the level of debate in the Se
curity Council was very close to
that in the UN. I would like to
emphasize once again that all
meetings tomorrow and Saturday
are open to the public."
