# Indians Gun for Track Upset in Titanic with USC
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford and Southern Califor
nia will meet in the 52nd renewal
of the nation's greatest track and
field dual meet series today at
1:30 p.m. in Stanford Stadium be
fore an expected crowd of more
than 10,000.
Payton Jordan will send a Stan
ford team into the meet which is
given its best chance in years to
beat the Trojans. Not since an
early-season engagement back in
1933 have the Indians defeated
USC.
Jess Mortensen's Trojans rank
as the favorite this afternoon, but
the experts concede that if Stan
ford can break through in certain
key events, it can stop USC. If
Stanford wins, it will mark the
Trojans' first loss since May 12,
1915 when they were beaten by
Cal Tech.
Indians' Streak
Stanford brings a streak of its
own into (he meet: the Indians
have not yet lost under the tute
lage of Jordan. Since he came to
the Farm this year the Tribe has
beaten the Olympic Club, San
Jose Stale, Santa Clara Youth
Center and, most recently of all,
Fresno State.
Almost every evepf in today's
meet will be crucial, with an un

expected showing by some Indian
or Trojan possibly swinging the
meet to one school or the other.
The half-mile is perhaps just a
bit more questionable an event
than any other. Stanford's Joe
Woollett has tho best time of any
of the probable starters, but USC's
Wes McLeod, Murray Cockburn
and Sid Wing are all right in
there.
Chesarek a Contender
Don Chesarek, the sophomore
ace of the Indians, will also be up
with the leaders. Probably the
key factor in determining the re
sults of this race will be tho abil
ity of Chesarek and Wing to re
cover quickly after running ear
lier races.
Chesarek will undoubtedly be
pushed to an all-out effort in the
quarter by Tom Anderson of USC,
and Wing won't able to take it
too easy if he expects to win the
mile.
If Stanford is to win the meet,
they wil! have to pile up points
in both hurdles races. Jordan is
banking on Chuck Cobb and Ber
nie Nelson to run 1 2 in Iho 120
highs, and looks for at least a 1 -3
finish by Cobb and Leonard Bates
in the lows.
Cobb, Nelson Consistent
USC's Bob Lawsoji actually has

the best high hurdle time of any
of the entrants, but Cobb and Nel
son are far more consistent than
the Trojans' all-around perform
er. Lawson is also the big USC
threat in the lows, but will hirn-

Tlie weather man says yes.
Sain McDonald says no.
Alarmed by yesterday's re
ports of rain whicli could wash
out today's track meet, Coach
I'ay ton Jordan decided to check
with the legendary McDonald,
now-retired chief of the Farm's
ground - keeping activities and
greatest Indian sports fan of
them ail.
After looking up at the
mountains behind Stanford for
a few minutes, Sam turned to
Jordan and reassuringly ob
served that "It rained some
where up there today, but I
think we're all right for tomor
row down here."

self be hard pressed by the rapid
ly improving Bates.
Another of the many question
marks hangs over the head of
Larry Gilbert, the only Trojan
sprinter of any note. If he were
in top shape, Gilbert would be the

favorite in both the 100 and 220.
Possible Upsets
But Gilbert is not in top shape;
how effective he will be is pres
ently unknown. The upshot of
this situation is that Stanford's
Frank Herrmann may be able to
score al least one and possibly
two wins for the Tribe in the
sprints. His best chance is in the
220. an event where Gilbert al
most completely broke down last
week against Occidental.
In the 140, Stanford will need
a win by Chesarek. His battle
with Anderson, regularly a half
miler, will be one of the meet's
best races, as will the fight for
third among Bob Harmon of USC
and Chuck Ince and Bob Hyde of
the Indians. Chesarek has the
best time of the six entrants, but
Anderson is an unknown quantity
in the shorter race.
Distance Troubles
Stanford will have a rugged
time cracking into the expected
Trojan domination of the mile and
the two-mile. Maury Graves, who
starrer! as a soph last year, is the
chief Indian contender in both
races.
Wing will be the pro-race favo
rite in the mile, with USC's di
minutive Max Truex the best bet
to take the runner-up position.

Graves could move up to surprise
the two USC men if they attempt
to hold back for their later races
in the meet.
Truex' later race will be the
two-mile, an event in which he is
national collegiate record holder.
Together with Mai Robertson, he
helps to give Mortensen the best
pair of two-milers to ever per
form in collegiate circles.
Look lor Sweeps
Two of the six field events have
been virtually conceded to the
Tribe, with USC a strong favorite
to sweep a third. Co-captains
Herrmann and Phil Fehlen are
expected to capture the broad
jump and high jump respective
ly, but the Indians will need more
than just first places in these
events.
Ron Bondoc and Nelson will be
after the high jump sweep, while
Kent Hansen and Chuck Peterson
hope to go 2-3 behind Herrmann
in the broad jump. Ron Morris,
a 15-foot lea per. is the prohibitive
choice in the pole vault, with his
teammates Jerry Hren and Ernie
Bullard expected to complete the
sweep.
Crucial Weights
The crucial field events are the


CO CAPTAINS HERRMANN (LEFT) AM) FEIILEN, AM) < OAC II JORDAN
discus and javelin, with the shot
put not far behind. Fred Peters
will be involved in a titanic dis
cus battle with USC's Rink Babka
and Jack Egan, and can supply
live points the Tribe desperately
needs.
In the javelin, Hank Roldan
will be fighting another pair of
long - throwing TrVrjans â€” Boh
Voiles and Doug Maijala. Stan
lord's Kirk Nieland will also be
high in the competition, making
for a good four-way fight for
points.
I'lain Questionable
The condition of Chris Plain
may affect the shot put results
in much the same way Gilbert's
status affects the sprints. The
burly Tribesman has been out of
action with a back injury, but
appears ready for a top effort.
At any rate, he and Ray William
son should give USC's Dick Bron
son and Ray Martin all the com
petition they can take.
There is an excellent chance
that the meet will go down to the
final event, the mile relay. If this
is Ihe case, then it is anybody's
meet. Stanford has run one-tenth
of one second faster than USC in
the relay, but in an event such
as this, past performances mean
little or nothing. If the meet does
come down to the final event, it
will probably be decided on a
basis of which team has the
freshest runners available and
which I earn wants to win most.
New Innovations
Noi only will fans be treated to
the finest in competition, they
will benefit from several new in
novations designed to help with
their understanding and enjoy
ment of Ihe meet.
Among other things, the meet
will feature individual introduc
tions of the ,six participants in
each event, special devjees de
signed to help the spectators gain
:i better view of the finish of each
ra(V, and the first appearance of
the Stanfbrd team in its new uni
forms featuring each man's name
and number.
