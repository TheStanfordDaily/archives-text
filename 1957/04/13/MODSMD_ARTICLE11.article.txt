# ICJ Rules Crushing of Revolt In Hungary Is Not Genocidal
## 
### 
Model United Nations International Court of Justice yesterday
ruled that the actions of Janos Kadar, Perene Muennick and Gyorgy
Marosan in putting down rebellion in Hungary are not genocidal in
nature.
Counsels for the United Kingdom and Hungary had delivered
their arguments Thursday hut the decision was delayed until yes
terday.
The ICJ argued that the excesses shown in suppressing the Hun
arian revolution were not with the intent to abolish races. Genocide
is defined as the killing of a group of human beings.
In the Israel vs. Egypt case, the ICJ said Egypt was not justified
in closing the Suez Canal to Israeli ships. The belligerency existing
between the two nations since 1948 was not enough to abrogate the
Treaty of Constantinople (1888) provision calling for freedom of
passage, the IC.J ruled.
Counsel for Israel said the canal is international in origin, intent
and use. Only if Israel threatens the security of the canal does
Egypt have the right to initiate "unilateral action" against if, the
counsel said.
Counsel for Egypt said, "We have preserved freedom of naviga
tion of the canal by not taking the chance of letting a belligerent
nation pass through it. When the security and defense of Egypt is
threatened, 1 lie security and defense of the canal is."
In the Anglo-Iranian oil case, ICJ decided it was not within its
jurisdiction to "inquire into" the affair. ICJ also declined to render
an advisory opinion on Poland vs. U.S. on the grounds that it con
cerned a matter of national law and not international law.
