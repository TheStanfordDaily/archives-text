# ECOSOC Meeting Punctuated by UK Protest Walkout
## 
### 
United Kingdom walked out of
Economic and Social Council yes
terday afternoon following pas
sage of the Greek resolution to
set up a commission to prepare a
plebiscite for Cyprus.
The resolution provided for a
commission composed of repre
sentatives of Greece, Turkey,
Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots
and the United Kingdom.
The major reason advanced by
the United Kingdom for the walk
out was that this resolution
would cause open debate in the
MUN which might lead to more
rioting on Cyprus. They main
tained that the U.K., Turkey and
Greece would have to come to
agreement before entering dis
cussion and that a commission
should be formed outside the
MUN.
In other action yesterday, the
Council declared itself not com
petent to discuss any matter per
taining to Algeria. Later in the
session when the Republic of In
donesia moved to reconsider the
matter of Algeria, the motion
failed to get a necessary two
thirds vote and was dropped.
The Council passed four other
resolutions which will be submit
ted to the General Assembly to
day. The resolutions involved set
ting up a permanent commission
for arbitration, establishment of
SUNFED, currency convertibility
and a resolution which had been
formerly submitted to the Trus
teeship Council.
