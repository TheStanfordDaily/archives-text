# FOUR YEARS IN U.S.
## Syrian Journalist Expresses Hope for MUN in Syria 
### 
Newsman from Syria and ob
server of the Model United Na
tions Said Darkazanli hopes to
create an MUN inside of Syria.
"It would be hard to allow a
country to represent Israel, how
ever, because Israel is not recog
nized by the Arab states," Darka
zanli said.
Syria mistrusts the West be
cause of the creation of Israel.
The Israeli people are outsiders
from Europe, and there is no jus
tification for Israel to stay, he
said.
"My country," said Darkazanli,
"fears invasion from all sides—
Turkey, Iraq and mainly Israel.
The Egyptian invasion has
proved this fear justifiable. Syr
ia is even apprehensive that Brit
ain and France may invade Syria
as a mass colonial plot."
Darkazanli, who is affiliated
with the El-Tarbiesh in Aleppo,
Syria, and the Damascus News,
entered the United States four
years ago and has not been back
since.
After explaining Syria's con
stant fear of invasion, Darkazanli
said this same threat of war is
probably the cause of the intense
high school and college participa
tion in government activities.
"Public opinion is mostly ex
pressed by college and high
school students. They have a
great deal of influence, enough to
actually form policy decisions,"
Darkazanli said.
"The students there are under
the pressure of the problem and
they have to take an active role.
"For you here in the U.S., you

can take a passive role. You can
study the problem from all an
gles and then slowly get a solu
tion."
American papers often report
mob demonstrations in Syria, but
they are not really mobs. They
are students. The students, he
said, can force the government to
do anything.
When asked about Commu
nism in Syria, Darkazanli said
the party had been illegal until
1954. Until then Syria had faith
in the West because they believed
the West would not return as a
colonial power in the Middle
East. However, when Israel was
armed the balance of power in
the Middle East was upset.
"There will not be peace in the
Middle East as long as there is
the refugee problem and as long
as Israel still wants to expand,"
Darkazanli said. "So far, the U.S.
has not been able to offer an ef
fective plan for the Middle East."
However, he seemed to think
that the Communists have little
ideological strength in Syria. And
Darkazanli did not'know the ex
tent of arms which his country
had purchased from Russia.

The Egyptian invasion has
proved this fear justifiable. Syr
ia is even apprehensive that Brit
ain and France may invade Syria
as a mass colonial plot."
Darkazanli, who is affiliated
with the El-Tarbiesh in Aleppo,
Syria, and the Damascus News,
entered the United States four
years ago and has not been back
since.
After explaining Syria's con
stant fear of invasion, Darkazanli
said this same threat of war is
probably the cause of the intense
high school and college participa
tion in government activities.
"Public opinion is mostly ex
pressed by college and high
school students. They have a
great deal of influence, enough to
actually form policy decisions,"
Darkazanli said.
"The students there are under
the pressure of the problem and
they have to take an active role.
"For you here in the U.S., you

can take a passive role. You can
study the problem from all an
gles and then slowly get a solu
tion."
American papers often report
mob demonstrations in Syria, but
they are not really mobs. They
are students. The students, he
said, can force the government to
do anything.
When asked about Commu
nism in Syria, Darkazanli said
the party had been illegal until
1954. Until then Syria had faith
in the West because they believed
the West would not return as a
colonial power in the Middle
East. However, when Israel was
armed the balance of power in
the Middle East was upset.
"There will not be peace in the
Middle East as long as there is
the refugee problem and as long
as Israel still wants to expand,"
Darkazanli said. "So far, the U.S.
has not been able to offer an ef
fective plan for the Middle East."
However, he seemed to think
that the Communists have little
ideological strength in Syria. And
Darkazanli did not'know the ex
tent of arms which his country
had purchased from Russia.
Newsman from Syria and ob
server of the Model United Na
tions Said Darkazanli hopes to
create an MUN inside of Syria.
"It would be hard to allow a
country to represent Israel, how
ever, because Israel is not recog
nized by the Arab states," Darka
zanli said.
Syria mistrusts the West be
cause of the creation of Israel.
The Israeli people are outsiders
from Europe, and there is no jus
tification for Israel to stay, he
said.
"My country," said Darkazanli,
"fears invasion from all sides—
Turkey, Iraq and mainly Israel.
