ADVICE ON ADVISORS
Recently I made an extensive tour of American cam
puses, interviewing students and selling mechanical dogs,
and one of the most frequent Complaints 1 heard from
undergraduates was, "My faculty advisor doesn't really
care about me."
Everywhere I went I heard this same cry. (Indeed,
at one university I found 15,000 students jammed in the
field house chanting it a cappella.) But I am bound to
say, dear friends, that you are wrong. Your faculty
advisor does care about you. The trouble is, he doesn't
know you. And no wonder! How do you expect him to
know you when you see him once or so a semester?
Get to be friends with your faculty advisor—like, for
example, Alpine R. Sigafoos, a sophomore in timothy and
silage at Texas A. & M.
Alpine R. Sigafoos appeared one night in the living
quarters of his faculty advisor (whose name, by a curious
coincidence, was also Alpine R. Sigafoos). .
"Good evening, sir," said Student Sigafoos. "I am
come so that you may get to know me better and thus
help me solve the vexing problems that trouble me."

"And what are those three packages you are carry
ing?" asked Advisor Sigafoos.
"This," said Student Sigafoos, holding up the first of
the three packages, "is a carton of Philip Morris Ciga
rettes, which come in long size or regular, and without
which I never stir. It is, sir, a smoke beyond compare—
full of fresh, natural, unfiltered flavor that delights the
taste, salves the soul, and turns the whole world into
one long vista of peace and greenery. Try one, sir."
"Thank you," said Advisor Sigafoos, lighting a Philip
Morris Cigarette. He puffed appreciatively for an hour
or two and then said, "And what is in the other packages
you are Carrying?"
"I am rather a complex fellow," said Student
Sigafoos, "and I don't expect that you will get to know
me in a hurry. So," he said, holding up his second pack
age, "I have brought my bed-roll."
"I see," said Advisor Sigafoos, not entirely pleased.
"And what is this third package?"
"Well sir, I know that occasionally you will be busy
with other matters and will therefore be unable to spend
time with me. So I have brought along my gin rummy
partner, Walter M. Handzlik."
In the next two years Advisor Sigafoos, living cheek
by-jowl with Student Sigafoos, got to know all of the
lad's personality traits, his hopes, his fears, his drives,
his quirks, his aspirations. At the end of that time,
armed with true understanding, Advisor Sigafoos con
cluded that Student Sigafoos's basic trouble was that ho
was not really college material.
So Advisor Sigafoos got Student Sigafoos a job with
the North Star Hockey Puck Corporation where today he
is head of the puck-packing department and a happy man.
Advisor Sigafoos is happy too. He has time again to
pursue his studies of Trichobatrach us robust us, the hairy
frog. At night he plays gin rummy with Walter M.
Handzlik.
