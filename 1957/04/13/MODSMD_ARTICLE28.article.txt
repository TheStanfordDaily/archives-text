# Card Crew Opens Season Against USC
## Indian Oarsmen Race at Redwood YH This Morning 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
Stanford's semi - orphan crew
opens its season this morning at
the Redwood City Yacht Harbor
with great expectations that
months of practice will pay off
in victory over USC. (See adjoin
ing map for directions to the race
site.)
Three races are on tap in to
day's rowing regatta . The num
ber two varsity shells from each
school get things "rowing" at
10:30 followed by the freshman
race at 11. The number' one var
sity shells are scheduled to start
at 11:30.
All three races will be rowed
over a 2000 - meter course (the
standard Olympic distance), or
approximately 1!4 miles. Specta
tors can view about the last
three-quarters mile of the regatta
from the finish line.
A launch equipped with a radio
will trail each race and give the
spectators a complete account of
all three regattas from start to
finish. A loudspeaker system is
set up at the finish line to handle
the broadcasts.
Last Saturday USC scored a
clean sweep over the UCLA oars
men. With one wiir under their
belt the Trojans have fired up
herpes of upsetting the Indians.
Last year SC won the number
two varsity race but dropped the
varsity and frosh regattas.
Southern Cal is a newcomer to
the sport, however, and has never
beaten the Indian' varsity since
coach Bob Hillen started crew al
Troy iir 1919. Although the Cards
are favored, the Trojans are dan
gerously hungry.
The Cards' volunteer coach,
likeable Lou Lindsey, ran true to
form by sticking to the optimistic

pattern adopted by Far m coaches
irr other sports. "You never- know
how good you are until you've
had some competition," Lindsey
explained, "but we've got a tall,
strong crew composed of deter
mined, hard-wor king oarsmen.
"We've looked good in practice
and it's just possible this could
be the best crew in Stanford's
history. The shells stroked a
three-mile trial course Wednes
day at a slightly reduced rate and
looked very good.
"I started the second varsity
boat one length ahead of Ihe
number-one shell, and it only fin
ished three - fourths length be
hind, indicating good depth. In
fact, 1 his year's third boat is bel
ter than last year's second."

Stanford's semi - orphan crew
opens its season this morning at
the Redwood City Yacht Harbor
with great expectations that
months of practice will pay off
in victory over USC. (See adjoin
ing map for directions to the race
site.)
Three races are on tap in to
day's rowing regatta . The num
ber two varsity shells from each
school get things "rowing" at
10:30 followed by the freshman
race at 11. The number' one var
sity shells are scheduled to start
at 11:30.
All three races will be rowed
over a 2000 - meter course (the
standard Olympic distance), or
approximately 1!4 miles. Specta
tors can view about the last
three-quarters mile of the regatta
from the finish line.
A launch equipped with a radio
will trail each race and give the
spectators a complete account of
all three regattas from start to
finish. A loudspeaker system is
set up at the finish line to handle
the broadcasts.
Last Saturday USC scored a
clean sweep over the UCLA oars
men. With one wiir under their
belt the Trojans have fired up
herpes of upsetting the Indians.
Last year SC won the number
two varsity race but dropped the
varsity and frosh regattas.
Southern Cal is a newcomer to
the sport, however, and has never
beaten the Indian' varsity since
coach Bob Hillen started crew al
Troy iir 1919. Although the Cards
are favored, the Trojans are dan
gerously hungry.
The Cards' volunteer coach,
likeable Lou Lindsey, ran true to
form by sticking to the optimistic

pattern adopted by Far m coaches
irr other sports. "You never- know
how good you are until you've
had some competition," Lindsey
explained, "but we've got a tall,
strong crew composed of deter
mined, hard-wor king oarsmen.
"We've looked good in practice
and it's just possible this could
be the best crew in Stanford's
history. The shells stroked a
three-mile trial course Wednes
day at a slightly reduced rate and
looked very good.
"I started the second varsity
boat one length ahead of Ihe
number-one shell, and it only fin
ished three - fourths length be
hind, indicating good depth. In
fact, 1 his year's third boat is bel
