Vivid colors and practically ev
ery fnodern convenience will
greet music students on arrival
for the first classes in the new
$736,292 Florence H. Dinkelspiel
Memorial Music Center, the low
er floor of which will be ready
for occupancy on April 15.
In designing tht? building, the
Music Department concentrated
on solving the problems of best
arrangements for teaching and
for making the new edifice as
pleasant to work in as possible.
Stanford now has what the
New York Times has called the*
"theater of tomorrow" in the
form of the Florence H. Dinkel
spiel Memorial Auditorium. The
ceiling of the auditorium gives
the appearance of being tiered.
With this arrangement, there will
be an even distribution of sound
throughout the auditorium. One
must see the ceiling to under
stand and appreciate it.
"Theater of Future"
The shape of the auditorium is
also a featured part of this "the
ater of the future." It is not so
much something new as it is re
discovered. The earliest produc
tions were done in the circle
round which developed into the
Elizabethan type theater with
the stage projected out into the
audience; more modern theaters
have taken on a rectangular
shape. Now the advantages of
the circle round and Elizabethan
type stage are beginning to be
utilized once again.
The new wide stage, a 50-foot
opening, is projected out into the
audience, and may extend even
more by covering the orchestra
pit which is designed to hold 100
musicians. The projected stage
will make it possible for young
voices to be heard throughout the
auditorium without strain. Since
there are no proscenium col
umns, the view will not be ob
structed in any of the four sec
tions into which the 15 rows of
seats are divided. Lighting con
trols and recording rooms are lo
cated on either side of the stage
out of the view of the audience.
No Drop Scenery
The ceiling of the stage is low
so that no drop scenery can he
used. All scenery will be brought
in on wagons. This feature will
cut the cost of presentation by
eliminating the massive drops
and will therefore allow more
programs to be produced on less
money. Lighting will be used
more to create effects in these
productions.
The basic color in the 750-ca
pacity auditorium is maroon. The
seats will vary slightly in color
to produce an animated effect
when empty for the benefit of
students rehearsing. The stage
itself will be more of a mulberry
color.
A balcony for the lights is in
the back of the auditorium, and
provisions have been made for
the addition of a pipe organ if it
is desired. There are no balcony
seats.
Offices for Dr. Sandor Salgo
and Dr. Harold Schmidt and a
kitchenette are also located on
the ground floor. Dressing and
wardrobe rooms are on the sec
ond floor with the main audito
rium.
Practice Rooms
For the students who must
spend hours 'in the practice
rooms, which are on the first
floor, colorful and comfortable
surroundings have been supplied.
Students will no longer have to
ask for practice room one, two or
three, hut instead for the rose
room, the turquoise room or, for
a more subdued setting, the beige
room. The Ml practice rooms and
chamber music room are done in
these alternating colors. Also the
students will find new pianos
awaiting them in the triangular
shaped practice rooms.
The formal dedication of the
building will be May 23, the open
ing of the spring opera,
"The Ballad of Baby Doe." The
building will not be open to the
public until Ibis date.
