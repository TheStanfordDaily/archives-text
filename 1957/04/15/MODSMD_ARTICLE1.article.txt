# Tracksters Wage Closest Fight In 10 Years, Still Lose to USC
## Herrmann Scores 15 Points for SU Thinclads; Distance-Run Sweeps Spark 72-59 Trojan Win 
### Dick Barnes 
Despite putting up its strongest resistance in 10 years, Stanford
fell to (he superior depth of Southern California's tracksters, 72-59,
Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
The almost 10,000 fans in attendance acclaimed the meet as one
of the best competitive battles ever seen at Stanford, and by far the

best-run meet ever held here.
Co - captain Frank Herr mann
did his best to load Payton Jor
dan's fired-up team to victory,
but his three first places couldn't
offset Trojan domination of the
880, mile and two-mile, nor could
they make up for Stanford rever
sals in the high hurdles, discus
and shot put.
Herrmann grabbed the first of
I his three wins by broad-jumping
24-10'•> for the best mark of his
life and the leading outdoor mark
in the U.S. this year. Minutes la
ter, he shot to the front and held
on to take the 100 in 10.0, with
Leonard Bates a surprising sec
ond for Stanford.
Herrmann Comes Back
In the 220, Herrmann was run
ning third with .'10 yards to go
when he suddenly came oven and
then leaned into the tape inches
ahead of USC's Bruce Kitchen.
The win made him the first In
dian ever to win three undisputed
firsts against USC.
Stanford picked up eight first
places to seven for- the Trojans,
but got just four of the 14. sec
ond places. The scoring was one
sided in many events, with Jess
Mortensen's Trojans sweeping
four events and t he Indians going
9-0 in two.
Chuck Cobb and Don Chesarek
each broke the tape first in two
events, with Phil Fehlen account
ing for the remaining victory. It
wasn't Cobb's fault that Stanford
didn't score as heavily in the
highs as was expected.
He won the event in a best-ever
time of 14.3, but Trojans moved
in for second and third to lose
only one point where they had
been expected to lose seven.
Leads All Way
In the lows, Cobb led all the
way and posted a clocking of
23-4. Chesarek's win in the 440
came despite the fact that he was
completely boxed in for more
than a quarter of the race.
The Indian sophomore found
himself behind at the 220 mark,
and when the runners broke
from their lanes he was trapped
with no place to go. He remained
in the box until the pack swung
off the last turn.
Then, with the advantage of a
long straightaway, he pulled past
Troy's Tom Anderson to win by a
foot.
Chesarek also anchored the re
lay team to victory in the meet's
closing event. Stanford led al
most all the way, but never by
much.
Bill Carls led off with a 49.6
leg and handed off to Bob Hyde,
who toured the oval in 49.0. Jim
Easter, normally a sprinter, then
took over and held Stanford's
lead with a 50.0 effort. Chesarek
brought the Indians home in
front with a good closing lap of
47.4.
Fehlen led a high jump sweep
as he cleared 6-7'4. Ron Bondoe
jumped the highest of his life,
6-4Ms, to grab second and Bernie
Nelson also established a person
al high as he cleared 6-3'/ 2 .
27-0 Distance Sweep
Sid Wing and Max Truex paced
USC to its 27-0 sweep of the three
long races of the program and es
tablished three new meet records
in doing it. Wing won the mile in
4:09.2, second-best outdoor mark
of the season, and then returned
to run away with the 880 in
1:51.2.
Truex, running like a little put
| put machine and seemingly never
tiring, coasted home second in
| the mile and then hid from the
rest of the field as he won the
two-mile in 9:06.0.
Stanford wasn't expected to

points on seconds and thirds.
Hank .Roldan fell victim lo one
long throw by IISC's Bob Voiles

ually improved throughout the
competition until he finally stuck

throw all afternoon, reared back
and hurled the spear 237-10 for a
new meet record and the victory.
