## Two Stanford Students Hurt in Gang Attack on Stern Beach Party Friday 
### 
A group of Stanford students
from Stern Hall attending a par
ty Friday night at San Gregorio
Beach wore attacked by a gang
of 15 knife - wielding youths,
bringing injuries to two students.
Veil Dean Keiser received a i
skull fracture and a possible con- j

cussion when he was knocked
down, kicked and beaten with a
2x4-inch board. He was admitted
to Palo Alto Alto Hospital Friday
night. Dr. Ben Moore said his
condition was improving and that
he may be out of the hospital in
one or two week,s.
Tom Frost received a black eye
when he was also knocked down
and beaten. He was treated in
the hospital and was released.
15 Couples
Fifteen couples attended the
party, which was given by Wing
Five of Stern Hall. About 15 oth
ers congregated at the other end
of the beach. Around 9:30 p.m.
they asked for fireworks and the
students gave them some. About.
20 minutes later all 15 came to
the Stanford bonfire and tried to
start a fight.
Frost said they put a knife in
his stomach and threatened him.
They milled around and started
to hit the Stanford men and wom
en. Some of the youths had
knives, brass knuckles and bro
ken bottles.
Relish Jar
During this melee, Reiser was
beaten up and most of the others
were hit. The women were hit
by a gallon relish jar, mustard
jar and salad dressing jar thrown
by the apparent ringleader, "Big
Don."
Because of the women's
screams and the men's refusal to
start a fight, everyone followed
the screamed suggestion "Let's
gel out of here!"
Fveryone left, except that dur
ing the light Keiser lost his keys,
so he and two others had to flag
a car down in order to get to
Palo Alio.
Car Mistaken
Louis R. Marks, 1.9, of Palo
Alio, mistook the car driven by
Paul Farias, 18, and Steven Hud
son, 10, of San Leandro for a
Stanford car, and kicked in the
windshield. He broke three ribs
when he fell from the moving
car.
During the weekend 10 sus
pects, including Marks, were
picked up. On Sunday about 10
of the Stanford students went to
the San Mateo County Jail and
identified nine of the attackers,

including the alleged leader, "Big
Don" Rutherdale Jr.
They are all being held on in
vestigation for assault with a
deadly weapon. According to the
San Mateo County Sheriff's Of
fice three or four will probably
be arraigned on that charge.
