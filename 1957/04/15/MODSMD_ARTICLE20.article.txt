# Hussein, Army Take Control Over Jordan
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 14
(UP)—Young King Hussein took
over complete control of Jordan
behind loyal army units today
and deported the two top leit
wing political and military lead
ers in sudden moves that erupted
into a bitter armed battle.
At least 13 soldiers were re
ported killed in a sharp clash be
tween military supporters of the
king and army elements loyal to
the leftist commander -in - chief,
Maj. Gen, Ali Ahu Nuwar.
Fighting: at Zarka
The fighting occurred at Zarka,
in an area in which Syrian troops
are stationed. Zarka is midway
between the Syrian border and
the Jordan capital of Amman,
where loyal Arab Legionnaires
and Bedouins were protecting the
king with tanks.
Bedouin troops sealed off Zarka
and demanded the surrender of
Jordanian troops loyal to Nuwar.
Fighting broke out. Further fire
fights were reported later in the
day. But by mid-afternoon, the
town was quiet.
It appeared that the military
elements supporting the king had
the upper hand.
Huge Crowds
Hussein arrested Nuwar and
deported him to Syria. He also
seized ousted Premier Suleiman
Nabulsi, a pro • Soviet and pro
Syrian left-wing leader. Nabulsi
also was reported en route to
Syria.
However, huge crowds demon
strated tonight in the Jordanian
sector of Jerusalem, Nablus and
Ramallah, shouting, "Down with
the king!"
