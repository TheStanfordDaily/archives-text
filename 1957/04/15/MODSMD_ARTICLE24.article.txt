# A 						Significant Election
## 
### 
By a significant 500-vote margin, the Stanford
student body last Thursday struck from the
books the recently-passed Publications Board
by-law which would have made the Daily edi
tor's election approvable by Legislature.
The Daily wishes to thank all those who
gave it this vote of confidence.
We will continue to strive to be an informed,
stimulating and responsible paper, without any
unikeeded shackles unfairly imposed upon it.
\\ e hope that the election result will bring
about an era of cooperation and criticism with
out legislation among Legislature, The Daily
and its 8000 campus readers.
And now we of The Daily can devote our
full energies to the task we are supposed to
do—putting out the best campus paper that
our time and abilities will permit us.
But other significant things occurred in the
election. Nearly 3000 voted—over 1000 more
than voted in last spring's election. .Still, with
8000 students enrolled at Stanford, this total—
which represents 35 per cent of the student
body is meager indeed.

Elections for student body president will be
held again today and tomorrow. With such a
large turnout of candidates for the highest
office in student government, any turnout less
than 50 per ccnt is disgraceful.
The reason for the rerunning of the presi
dential election is curious indeed. There were
only 2986 ballot stubs: 3020 voted for student
body president. As all the deposited ballots
appeared legitimate, only one conclusion can
be drawn —foul play somewhere iu procuring
or making extra ballots.
For a few interested students to completely
muddle a carefully planned election of this
magnitude is unfortunate. The 550 MUN dele
gates must have had quite an interesting im
pression of Stanford when they read of the
election in Saturday's Daily.
We nevertheless wish to give Karen Peterson
and her Election Commission a vote of confi
dence for their excellent job on a fantastically
difficult election—and urge the student body
to give them a similar vote of confidence by
casting their ballots today or tomorrow.

body president. As all the deposited ballots
appeared legitimate, only one conclusion can
be drawn —foul play somewhere iu procuring
or making extra ballots.
For a few interested students to completely
muddle a carefully planned election of this
magnitude is unfortunate. The 550 MUN dele
gates must have had quite an interesting im
pression of Stanford when they read of the
election in Saturday's Daily.
We nevertheless wish to give Karen Peterson
and her Election Commission a vote of confi
dence for their excellent job on a fantastically
difficult election—and urge the student body
to give them a similar vote of confidence by
casting their ballots today or tomorrow.
