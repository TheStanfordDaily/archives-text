Uncommitted Generation
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter to the editor (The Daily, Monday,
April 8) Michael Connell wrote in defense of
this "careful" generation.
Mr. Connell's generation, as he paints it, is not
much possessed of boldness or great ambition.
It is, he affirms, "waiting." It is waiting for
the elder generation to turn the affairs of the
world over to it; waiting for a proven plan of
political organization to be developed and pre
sented.
But waiting, no matter how filled with emo
tion, and ideas-crossing-minds, is still a passive
state. When, I should like to know, Mr. Connell,
do you imagine that living, and the struggles in
volved in that activity, begin? At twenty-one?
With the A.B. degree? With marriage?
Just how long will you wait? Indeed, for
what? Surely you do not believe that if you do
not care to lift your own eyes to the "true, the
good and the beautiful," someone else will care,
and lift your eyes for you? Or that someone else
will provide that "experimentally successful"
model of political organization for you? Or that
on some appointed (lay, an amorphous band (if
"elders" will hand you the world which they
"control," and let you dabble with it from there
onward?
Yet these are the things your words have said,
and clearly implied.
One of Mr. Connell's major justifications for
the "care" and "caution" of this generation in
capacitated by opportunism, and a passivity born
of fear, is what he feels to be a great need for
ihose first-named qualities in solving world prob
lems. "Our generation," he says, "may possibly
help 1o pull the world from its muddle of ten
sions."
The world's "muddle of tensions" is something
more than an undergraduate poker party, or the
subject of a sophomoric intellectual discussion.
The conflict is mortal, and it (and peace) will
never be won by timidity, OR by waiting, OR
by treading lightly with a pious prayer for suc
cess in a venture as yet not undertaken, and ap

proached with reluctance.
Certainly care and caution will play a part
in the winning of the conflict, and the peace, if
it can be won; but they will be effective only in
the disciplined hands of those who have commit
ted themselves to the struggle of living in gen
eral, and the conflict in particular. When "care"
and "caution" are employed as excuses for not
acting, for not struggling or involving oneself
with life, they remain excuses.
The difficulty with Mr. Connell's generation of
"careful" people is lhat it is a generation un
committed to life and the responsibilities of
modern existence. And in so far as it is uncom
mitted, it is irresponsible. Such people are nei
ther able nor willing to accept the problems that
face the world, and to pretend that they are is
Ihe sheerest self-deception.
It is all very well that Mr. Connell should seek
to have us understand the generation of which
he claims to be typical (after all, we, 100, are
a part of it, are at times filled with similar feel
ings), but it is quite another thing to ask—as I
think he does for our forgivness and approval.

The Model United Nations Secretariat would
like to take this occasion to thank the staff of
The Stanford Daily for the really great cover
age it did on the MUN Conference.
It is only once in a great while that Stanford
is privileged to host this greatest of all inter
collegiate student conferences in the United
States.
Your excellent coverage has proven your abil
ity as a staff to put forth lhat extra effort re
quired of all groups at certain times. That you
did is to your credit and very definitely to the
credit of the Stanford student body. There was
no end of favorable comments from the delegates
of the various colleges that attended.
Be assured that the prestige of Stanford has
been considerably raised by your contributions,
together with those of other organizations.

In his letter to the editor (The Daily, Monday,
April 8) Michael Connell wrote in defense of
this "careful" generation.
Mr. Connell's generation, as he paints it, is not
much possessed of boldness or great ambition.
It is, he affirms, "waiting." It is waiting for
the elder generation to turn the affairs of the
world over to it; waiting for a proven plan of
political organization to be developed and pre
sented.
But waiting, no matter how filled with emo
tion, and ideas-crossing-minds, is still a passive
state. When, I should like to know, Mr. Connell,
do you imagine that living, and the struggles in
volved in that activity, begin? At twenty-one?
With the A.B. degree? With marriage?
Just how long will you wait? Indeed, for
what? Surely you do not believe that if you do
not care to lift your own eyes to the "true, the
good and the beautiful," someone else will care,
and lift your eyes for you? Or that someone else
will provide that "experimentally successful"
model of political organization for you? Or that
on some appointed (lay, an amorphous band (if
"elders" will hand you the world which they
"control," and let you dabble with it from there
onward?
Yet these are the things your words have said,
and clearly implied.
One of Mr. Connell's major justifications for
the "care" and "caution" of this generation in
capacitated by opportunism, and a passivity born
of fear, is what he feels to be a great need for
ihose first-named qualities in solving world prob
lems. "Our generation," he says, "may possibly
help 1o pull the world from its muddle of ten
sions."
The world's "muddle of tensions" is something
more than an undergraduate poker party, or the
subject of a sophomoric intellectual discussion.
The conflict is mortal, and it (and peace) will
never be won by timidity, OR by waiting, OR
by treading lightly with a pious prayer for suc
cess in a venture as yet not undertaken, and ap

proached with reluctance.
Certainly care and caution will play a part
in the winning of the conflict, and the peace, if
it can be won; but they will be effective only in
the disciplined hands of those who have commit
ted themselves to the struggle of living in gen
eral, and the conflict in particular. When "care"
and "caution" are employed as excuses for not
acting, for not struggling or involving oneself
with life, they remain excuses.
The difficulty with Mr. Connell's generation of
"careful" people is lhat it is a generation un
committed to life and the responsibilities of
modern existence. And in so far as it is uncom
mitted, it is irresponsible. Such people are nei
ther able nor willing to accept the problems that
face the world, and to pretend that they are is
Ihe sheerest self-deception.
It is all very well that Mr. Connell should seek
to have us understand the generation of which
he claims to be typical (after all, we, 100, are
a part of it, are at times filled with similar feel
ings), but it is quite another thing to ask—as I
think he does for our forgivness and approval.

proached with reluctance.
Certainly care and caution will play a part
in the winning of the conflict, and the peace, if
it can be won; but they will be effective only in
the disciplined hands of those who have commit
ted themselves to the struggle of living in gen
eral, and the conflict in particular. When "care"
and "caution" are employed as excuses for not
acting, for not struggling or involving oneself
with life, they remain excuses.
The difficulty with Mr. Connell's generation of
"careful" people is lhat it is a generation un
committed to life and the responsibilities of
modern existence. And in so far as it is uncom
mitted, it is irresponsible. Such people are nei
ther able nor willing to accept the problems that
face the world, and to pretend that they are is
Ihe sheerest self-deception.
It is all very well that Mr. Connell should seek
to have us understand the generation of which
he claims to be typical (after all, we, 100, are
a part of it, are at times filled with similar feel
ings), but it is quite another thing to ask—as I
think he does for our forgivness and approval.
