# THIS WEEK ON QUAD-By Dick Frey
## Elections, Colloquia and Easter Eggs 
### 
A wide range of activities is on schedule for
this week—various colloquia, flicks, a concert,
the Chappie, baseball and ASSTI primary elec
tions (continued), to name a few. In addition
to all this, it's Easter week.
Today's headliner is the 4:15 p.m. Department
of Biological Sciences Seminar in Room 430. Dr.
Quentin M. Gieman will talk on "Cultivation and
Metabolism of Entamoeba Histolytica" sounds
like a must for all the liver fluke fans.
ASSU primaries will continue today and to
morrow. Finals will be held next week instead
of this one as previously scheduled.

Tomorrow is one of those peaceful days the
Tuesday Evening Series will present a flick
called "Our Mister Sun," ;t TV science film. It'll
be at Mem And al 7:.'5<).

The Wednesday Matinee will show a kinescope
of the television peiTornuwice ~r the Stanford
Players* excellent presentation of "Twelfth
Night." Starting time is <1:15 at the Mem And
Little Theater.
Competing "culture" will be provided by the
Chaparral, which crashes the newsstands this
week with its annual magazine parody. This
time it's "Hodilay," and readers will doubtlessly
be enchanted by something like a lour of beau
tiful submarine Alviso or the sunny fields of

West Milpitas and the incredible leaning tower
of A g news.

Santa Clara will meet the Stanford basehallers
at 3:15 Thursday afternoon at the Sunken Dia
mond.
At 7:30 p.m. the Film Series at Cubberley has
a mysteriously titled movie, "The Golem." Ac
cording i<> the dictionary, a golem is a Franken
stein-type monster; an automaton; or a plain old
blockhead. Probably the only frightening tiling
about the picture is the year it was issued: 1920.

Gulch Camp. This week's hostel will consider
"Christian Ethics and Everyday Living." Sign
ups must be completed at the ASSU office by

The Sunday night flicks were scheduled to
gel into the Easter mood with the ancient com
edy "The Egg and 1" with Fred Mac Murray,

some unknown reason were changed to "Red
Garter" with Rosey Clooney and Jack Carson.
The usual stimulating two cartoons will accom
