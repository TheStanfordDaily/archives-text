# SEASON OPENER
## Crew Swamps USC in No. 2, Varsity, Freshman Regattas 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
Stanford's crew opened its season in winning style by swamping
USC in all three regattas Saturday morning at ih<* Redwood City
Yacht Harbor before an estimated 5000 spectators" who lined the
course.
Coach Lou Lindsay's No. 1 varsity shell kept intact its record of

never losing to a Trojan eight by
edging ahead of the SC boat at
the half-way mark. The Cards
were still pulling away when
they crossed the finish line a
length and one-half ahead of the
USC shell.
Coxswain Randy Jones started
with a slow 27-stroke count and
never exceeded 32 to cover the
2000-meter course in 6:05. USC
varied its stroke between 32 and
38 but the faster stroke wasn't
enough to compensate for the
power of the smooth-stroking In
dian eight. USC's time was 6:11.
Frosli Race Close
The closest race of the morn
ing was the freshman regatta
which the Papoose shell won by
half a length in 6:26. The SC
frosh pulled away at the start
and at one time commanded a
1%-length lead.
However, coached by Phil Wa
ters, the youthful Indians gradu
ally began to catch the Trojans
at the halfway point, never vary
ing their stroke more than 32 or
less than 31. With one-quarter
mile to go. the Papooses slowly
pulled away.
No. 2 Race Not
The No. 2 varsity boats got
things going with the first race
of the day. It: was strictly no
contest as the polished Cards
leaped ahead at Ihe start and
loafed lo an easy 2%-length vic
tory in 6:16.
The Stanford crew's next out
ing is against California, Satur
day, May 4, in the Oakland Es
tuary.
