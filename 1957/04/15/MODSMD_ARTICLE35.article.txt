# Leopold Throws No-Hit Game at USC To Give Cards Split in Baseball Series
## 
### Bob Payne 
Bob Leopold, Card southpaw
transfer from Stockton College,
made his first conference start a
historic one Saturday as he fired
a no-hit, no-run 4-0 victory over
Southern California to enable
Stanford to gain a split in the
weekend series.
The fast-balling sophomore had
seen only three innnings of action
in Card flannels before Saturday's
start. lie walked nine Trojans,
but had them baffled as only one
ball was hit out of the infield.
Leopold's "no-no-" performance

was the first ever thrown on SC's
Bovard Field. In addition, it was
Stanford's first nine-inning, no
hit, no-run affair-. Last season Ed
Verdurmen whitewashed Pepper
dine in a seven-inning game.
Friday Punimeling
Friday SC had pummeled three
Card hurlers for 14 hits and an
11-1 victory. That win was the
Trojans' seventh in eight games,
but the Saturday loss knocked
them from ihe top spot in the
CIBA.
Trojan errors opened the gates
in Saturday's game, as all Stan
ford's runs came unearned.
Ralph Holding celebrated his
return to the starting lineup by
leading the Indians at ihe plate
with a double and two singles.
Third baseman Rudy Figueroa
also picked up three hits, all sin
gles, while Leopold helped his
own cause with a pair l of one
basers.
Out of Trouble
The Cards, who had picked up
five double plays against San Jose
State last Tuesday, made four in
Saturday's game to keep Leopold
out of serious trouble.
Leopold could have been called
coach Dutch Fehring's answer to
SC's Dale Ziegler, a sophomore
lefty who had handcuffed the
Cards in Friday's game. Ziegler
set Stanford down on only five
hits and struck out 10. In addi
tion, he belted a home run.
The Trojans jumped on starter
Walt Payne for three runs in the
first and added three more in the

second when George Avery came
on in relief. The Cards picked up
their only run in the eighth when
Steve Stewart singled home Par
ker Olsen.
