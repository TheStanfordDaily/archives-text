# Asian Newspaper Editor Proclaims MUN 'Stimulating'
## 
### Art Islas 
Irfan Husain, associate editor
of the newspaper Asian Student,
expressed his feelings on the
Model United Nations comment
ing that "it is always stimulat
ing to find out how the younger
people view the problems of the
United Nations."
Husain, who has lived in the
United States for two years, is
originally from Pakistan. The
weekly Asian Student, with head
quarters in San Francisco, is pub
lished for the sole purpose of
keeping the 15,000 Asian students
in this country informed about
what is happening in their own
countries, according to Husain.
The newspaper presents a cap
sule summary of educational and
cultural aspects in Asian news
written primarily for Asian stu
dents.
Husain, praising MIJN as a
wo n d e r 1 u 1 organization, com
mented on the fact that he had
not seen as many Asian students
among the various delegations as
he had wished.
He also fell that a special com
mittee should have discussed to
a greater extent problems on the
revision of the UN Charter.
