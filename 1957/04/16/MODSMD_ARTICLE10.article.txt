president and Stern and off-cam
pus representatives.
This is about 50 less than voted
on the first day of the primaries
last week.
Elections chairman Karen Pe
terson said the situation may pro
duce quite different results from
those of the first, invalidated
ASSU presidential primaries.
Today is the second and last
day that re-run primary ballots,
may be cast.
The poll at Engineering Corner
will open at 8:30 a.m. and close
at 1:30 p.m.
34 Extra Ballots
Primaries for ASSU president
were originally held last Thurs
day and Friday, together with
other ASSU and class offices. But
the results of the one major office
election were invalidated when 34
extra ballots turned up in the
ballot boxes and could not be ac
counted for by ballot stubs.
Stern arrd off-campus primaries
for representative to Legislature
were postponed until this week
when it was found Thursday that
those ballots had been misprinted.
In an effort to avoid the seem
ing lax vote in the re-run pri
maries, 3000 "Vole Today" cards
were being handed out to stu
dents yesterday and today.
Women's Council
Last week's primary results for
the Women's Council positions
have been changed. The three
girls who won out in the prima
ries—Myrna Kelly, Sally Randall
and Phyllis Turner—have been
accepted for the three vacant po
sitions on the council. They will
not have to run in the finals, as
was mistakenly reported in The
Daily yesterday.
Counting of ballots will begin
in room 260-B in the basement of
Engineering Corner as soon as
the poll closes today, according to
Miss Peterson. She said results
will probably be posted on the
portable blackboard in front of
Engineering Corner by 4 p.m.
Legislature is scheduled to meet
at 7:30 p.m. this evening to ac
cept the results.
