# House Shouts Approval Of 41 Million for P.O.
## Deliveries May Be Restored by This Weekend 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 15 (UP)
The House today shouted its
approval of a $41 million emer
gency fund to enable the Post
Office Department to restore sus
pended mail service, possibly by
this weekend.
The voice vote capped lout
hours of sometimes bitter debate
in which Democrats and Itepub
licans quarreled as to whether the
Republican Administration or the
Democ; die Congress was respon
sible for the postal cutbacks.
The supplemental money hill
now goes to the Senate, where
rush action was expected. Bai
ring unforeseen delays, this would
enable President Eisenhower to
sign it into law before tho week
end and pave the way for restora
tion of full mail service.
A spokesman for Postmaster
General Arthur Summerfield, who
ordered the cutback in service,
would have no further comment
until the bill became law.
Normalcy Hoped For
But Representative Gor d on
Canfield (R-N.J.), chief Adminis
tration spokesman on postal mat
ters in the House, said "I truly
believe" that all the suspended
postal services would be restored
to normal once Congress com
pletes action on the bill.
In ordering the cutbacks into
effect last Saturday, Summerfield
had insisted he needed $47 million
to keep the postal service going
full blast for the rest of the cur
rent fiscal year, which ends on
June 30.
However, House members of
both parties said they believed he
could get by with the $41 million,
which was included in a bill carry
ing $48,990,000 for six government
agencies.
The Senate Appropriations Com
mittee promptly called a closed
door session for 11:30 a.m. tomor
row to consider the measure.
There was a possibility it would
be brought to a Senate vote later
in the day, if Senate leaders could
obtain the required unanimous
consent.
Democrats Angered
Mail deliveries and post office
window service were suspended
last Saturday, and additional cut
backs took effect today a fact
which angered Summerfield's
Democratic critics.
Democratic leader John W. Me-
Cormack (Mass.) said Summer
field showed a "contemptuous at
titude" toward Congress when he
failed to rescind his curtailment
order after the House Appropria
tions Committee voted to grant
him the $41 million last Friday.
GOP leader Joseph W. Martin
Jr. (Mass.) replied that Congress
was to blame. He said "we had a
month to pass the money hill in
the House and failed to do so."
The measure was passed while
many congressmen were attend
ing the opening major league hall
game at Griffith Stadium.
