# Jordan Gets New Compromise Government; Nabulsi Included
## King Hussein Says No Change in Basic Policy— Still Allied With Leaders of Neutral Arab Block 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan, April 15 (UP)—Hussein Khalidi, an independent
moderate and supporter of pro-Western King Hussein, today formed
a new compromise government that included ousted pro-Soviet Pre
mier Suleiman Nabulsi as foreign minister.
Khalidi kept for himself the vital post of defense minister as well

as premier. Nabulsi, who doub
led as his own foreign minister
during his administration, thus
keeps one of the key posts. He
also will serve as minister of
communications.
The new cabinet list included
all independents except for Na
bulsi, the head of the leftist Na
tional Socialist party.
King Hussein, in a meeting
with political leaders, said there
would be no change in Jordan's
basic policy. He said he would
abdicate if the time ever came
when he could no longer "offer
any service to the Arab nation.
Country's Good
"You all know that I am not
looking forward to a stay as
king and I am not looking for
ward to a stay here (in Amman)
if either is against the good of
the country," the young monarch
said.
Sources said the inclusion of
Nabulsi showed a "political com
promise" had been achieved in
an attempt to end the crisis trig
gered when Hussein deposed Na
bulsi last Wednesday.
But the situation remained
tense.
The premier designate declined
to explain his policies toward
Communism, but said he is a
servant of the king, an avowed
anti-Communist.
Denies Arrest
Nevertheless, the Jordan posi
tion still would be allied with the
neutral Arab block leaders, Syria
and Egypt.
A government spokesman de
nied reports members of the Na
bulsi cabinet had been arrested
yesterday during the king's ef
forts to crush "vile attempts" by
subversives to take over the
army.
Censorship except for military
matters was lifted and air trans
portation, stopped on Saturday,
was resumed this morning.
