### 
SACRAMENTO, April .15 (UP)
â€” A so-called "fair employment
practices" bill to prevent employ
ers or unions from refusing jobs
because of race, creed or color
was passed 61-15 by the Assem
bly today.
The measure was sent to the
Senate. It was authored by As
semblyman Augustus F. Maw
kins (D-Los Angeles), one of two
Negroes in the lower house of
the legislature.
Hawkins said 15 states now
have FEPC legislation on the
books and that the law has oper
ated so effectively "there has
not been one effort to repeal it,
there has not been one walkout
or strike and no evidence of har
assment of any employer or that
it led to social tensions."
Hawkins said the bill would
create a commission which could
go to court and compel employ
ers or unions to end discrimina
tion. But he said no criminal ac
tion could be taken until the com
mission had exhausted all other
means education, conciliation
and full hearings.
