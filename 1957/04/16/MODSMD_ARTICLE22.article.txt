Friday's attack on Stanford students by 1!»
knife-wielding youths points lo the growing
problem of juvenile delinquency and the fact
1 11it 1 tliere seems to he no satisfactory solution
lo the problem.
Ten of the 15 have been identified by their
Stanford victims; thev all have past records as
perennial trouble-makers. If past practices are
followed, their punishment will either he a
light jail sentence or, more likely, a suspended
sentence releasing them to further acts like
that committed last Friday.
The answer, of course, lies earlier in the
game, when the youth has committed his lirst
offense. Il presents a dilemma, of course. If
you let the youth go with just a warning, he
will think he was smart, that he got away with
it, and will probably pull a worse crime the
-econd time.
On the other band, if he is given a Ii«xl 11 jail

sentence, the youth may be mixed with more
hardened criminals and perhaps become em
bittered, again encouraging him to pull a worse
crime the second time.
The ideal answer, of course, is to go to the
root of the problem and find out what the
causes are parents, poor living conditions, or
pressure from other members of a gang?
However, when a gang of juveniles has
reached the proportions of the recent one, it
is our opinion that the book should he thrown
at them in order to show them that the law will
stand lor no such actions of assault.
It is especially important lo punish the
leader of such a gang. Quite often a whole
teen-age mob is led lo its action by the mis
guided leadership of one person.
If such gangs as last Friday's are not pun
ished immediately, their further actions might
be more serious than just malicious assault.
