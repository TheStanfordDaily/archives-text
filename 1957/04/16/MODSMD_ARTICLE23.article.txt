# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Dave Canfield
## Investigations, Chinese Frogs Make Headlines 
### 
Investigations into segregation, taxation and
Communism made news last week in colleges
from the University of Kansas to UCLA.
UCLA's Department of Education Dean-elect
Howard E. Wilson was charged with left-wing
connections in recent letters received by Los
Angeles newspapers and the university. Charges
said Wilson was a Red sympathizer during his
association with UNESCO and the Carnegie En
dowment for International Peace.
Wilson answered the charges in a press con
ference, saying, "I am not a Communist, have
never been a Communist sympathizer and am >
completely devoted to the principles of democ
racy."
He added he had been cleared in 1047 by the
U.S. government's security agencies.
UCLA's Chancellor Allen commented, "The ap
pointment of Dr. Wilson was made after a two
year search for the best possible man to head
one of our most important professional schools.
He was recommended by a faculty committee
and approved by myself after I had personally
called or written 10 of my own personal friends,
all presidents of leading universities."
"All recommendations were highly enthusias-
I ic," Allen concluded.

University of California's YMCA and YWCA
groups are actively opposing Assembly subver
sive tax bill 1526, according to the Daily Cali
fornian.
The two organizations sent delegates to state
Legislature committee meetings last Thursday
to oppose the bill, which would deny present tax
exemption privileges to any organization which
allowed a person or group on the Attorney Cen
eral's subversive list to use its facilities.

Roger Muldavin of the YMCA said the bill
"would have put a terrific financial burden on
us, since we would have been limited in many of
our activities."
He said AB 1526 was a virtual repeat of AB 1
1215 which was earlier defeated in the state Leg
islature.

At Lawrence, Kansas, the Daily Kansan re
cently reported 10 students and two faculty
members spent spring vacation touring the Deep
South to study segregation.
The group talked to students, faculty and ad
ministrators of five Negro colleges and universi
ties; ministers, journalists, white educators and
"the man in the street" during the nine-day tour.
The Rev. Ernest Klein, university pastor for
Baptist students, said the Kansas group got these
three general impressions:
• The Southern Negro is speaking out against
"Ihe traditional subordination of the race."
• "Where there is violence ... it is probably
the work ol the 'red-necks' or lower-class whites i
but it is often eondoned and encouraged by pub
lic officials and leading citizens."
• There are many hopeful signs.
The tour spanned 10 states and 2750 miles.

But an even longer trip will be made next
month by a frog named Won Long Hop. Accord
ing to an article in the San Jose State College
Spartan Daily, officials of the Civil Air Trans
port are planning "to fly Nationalist China's
prize frog across the Pacific to compete in the
May 18 Angels Camp Jumping Frog .Jubilee.
Won Long Hop was picked out of dozens of
frogs that competed in qualifications at Tainan
in Southern Formosa, where the island's best
frogs are raised.

Howard E. Wilson was charged with left-wing
connections in recent letters received by Los
Angeles newspapers and the university. Charges
said Wilson was a Red sympathizer during his
association with UNESCO and the Carnegie En
dowment for International Peace.
Wilson answered the charges in a press con
ference, saying, "I am not a Communist, have
never been a Communist sympathizer and am >
completely devoted to the principles of democ
racy."
He added he had been cleared in 1047 by the
U.S. government's security agencies.
UCLA's Chancellor Allen commented, "The ap
pointment of Dr. Wilson was made after a two
year search for the best possible man to head
one of our most important professional schools.
He was recommended by a faculty committee
and approved by myself after I had personally
called or written 10 of my own personal friends,
all presidents of leading universities."
"All recommendations were highly enthusias-
I ic," Allen concluded.

University of California's YMCA and YWCA
groups are actively opposing Assembly subver
sive tax bill 1526, according to the Daily Cali
fornian.
The two organizations sent delegates to state
Legislature committee meetings last Thursday
to oppose the bill, which would deny present tax
exemption privileges to any organization which
allowed a person or group on the Attorney Cen
eral's subversive list to use its facilities.

Roger Muldavin of the YMCA said the bill
"would have put a terrific financial burden on
us, since we would have been limited in many of
our activities."
He said AB 1526 was a virtual repeat of AB 1
1215 which was earlier defeated in the state Leg
islature.

At Lawrence, Kansas, the Daily Kansan re
cently reported 10 students and two faculty
members spent spring vacation touring the Deep
South to study segregation.
The group talked to students, faculty and ad
ministrators of five Negro colleges and universi
ties; ministers, journalists, white educators and
"the man in the street" during the nine-day tour.
The Rev. Ernest Klein, university pastor for
Baptist students, said the Kansas group got these
three general impressions:
• The Southern Negro is speaking out against
"Ihe traditional subordination of the race."
• "Where there is violence ... it is probably
the work ol the 'red-necks' or lower-class whites i
but it is often eondoned and encouraged by pub
lic officials and leading citizens."
• There are many hopeful signs.
The tour spanned 10 states and 2750 miles.
