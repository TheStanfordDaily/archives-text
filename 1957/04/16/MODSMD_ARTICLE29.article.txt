## 
### 
Mrs. Syedah F. Sadeque, senior
lecturer in Arabic and Islamic
| studies at Dacca University in
| Dacca, East Pakistan, visited the
I Stanford campus yesterday morn
ing to gain an insight into Ameri
can universities.
Under the auspices of Hoover
Institute. Mrs. Sadeque toured
the campus for several hours, see
ing 112 or m e r President Herbert
Hoover's office, the library and
Memorial Church.
j In an interview with The Daily,
â–  she explained that by far the ma
j jority of schools in Pakistan are
privately owned, though regulat
ed by a government inspector of
schools.
A Pakistanian university is dis
tinguished from a college in that
only the B.A. degree may be ob
| tained from a college, Mrs. Sa
! deque said. Students interested in
the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees enter
the university after attending pri
mary, high and intermediary
schools.
Islamic studies are an integral
part of every student's education,
Mrs. Sadeque said, since 85 per
cent of the Pakistan population
are Moslems. Her other teaching
field deals mainly with the his-!
lory of Arabic, Egyptian and

Spanish peoples of the Middle
Ages.
The position of women in edu
cation is far different from lhat
in America, she said. Coeducation
is not practiced till after the ninth
or 10t.h grade. Even then many

women are not allowed to attend I
colleges and universities.
In Daccu University there are'
3000 students, only 200 of whom !
are women. There are only two
all-girl schools in Pakistan.
Mrs. Sadeque, who obtained the
Ph.D. degree from London Uni- i
versity, is currently president of
the Federation of University
Women'of East Pakistan. In this
position she attended an interna
tional conference of university
women in Paris last year. She re
ceived one of two grants made
available for this conference by
the Asia Foundation, a private
organization.
Mrs. Sadeque arrived in the
United States in March and has
seen San Antonio, Grand Canyon,
Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
She was especially enthused about
Disneyland and explained that she
"saw more adults than children."
