# Grant From Mrs. Louis Stern Estate to Aid Completion of Final Stern Hall Additions
## 
### 
A gift of half a million dollars
was given to Stanford by the
estate of Mrs. Louis Stern to
build the last two wings in Stern
Hall, President Wallace Sterling
announced yesterday.
The new wings, housing 191
men, will bring the total capacity

of Stern to (>2B. The project,
which includes a single-story
building with separate lounge
and dining facilities for each resi
dence pavilion, besides the new
three-story wings, will cost about
$1 million. The University will
share the eosU equally with the
Stern estate.
Since the present construction
market is favorable to such a
project, the working drawings
are being rushed to completion,
according to Stanford director of
planning Eldridge T. Spencer.
Construction will be under way
by the middle of this summer,
and the hall is scheduled to be
opened by autumn 1958.
"The desirability of the final
addition is heightened by the suc
cess of Lucie Stern Hall in the
total Stanford housing program,"
I)r. Sterling declared. "When the
first units of the residence were
occupied in 1949, a new standard
in men's housing was set. With
its carefully planned rooms,
lounges, dining facilities and
courts, Lucie Stern Hall attests
to Stanford's desire that educa
tion should go beyond the class
room and should be a part of
Stanford living also."
The $500,000 just received
brings the total of gifts received
by Stanford from the Stern es
tate to $1,631,000.
According to plans being
drawn up by Spencer & Ambrose,
the designers of the new wings,
all but 10 of the student rooms
will be doubles, providing a bed,
desk, wardrobe and built-in facil
ities for each occupant. The sep
arate single - story building will
house lounges, dining rooms and
a cafeteria. The kitchen facili
ties are already built.
The lounges will contain libra
ries, which will be stocked by the
University's main library, and
study facilities. Smaller lounges
will be located on pavilion

floor. Rooms for recreation, typ
ing, luggage storage and a self
service laundry will be provided
in the basement. An apartment
for a faculty resident adviser and
his family will be located on the
ground floor of one of the pavil
ions.


COST ONE MILLIONâ€”The addition of the last
two wings of Stern will be made possible by a
gift of $500,000 received from the estate of the
late Mrs. LuVie Stern. The other half-million
dollars' will be provided by the University. This
sketch by the architects, Spencer & Ambrose,

shows the proposed new wings in the fore
ground, with Hoover Tower in the rear. The
gift will make possible the completion of the
eight wings, as originally planned, to accommo
date 191 men, bringing Stern's total capacity to
628 undergrads.
