### Dave Canfield 
Quote from University of Southern California sports writer
Chuck Signor in the Daily Trojan of last Thursday:
"This weekend's baseball games against Stanford shouldn't give
the Trojans much of a workout." i
With this Trojan beginning, the rest of this column will be care
fully devoted to omitting news of SC. For the Daily Trojan sports
writers < perhaps feeling their thoughts are very precious and should
be kept to themselves) are mad at this EXCHANGE columnist for
pirating their material.
As their ace writer Joe .Fares recently declared in print, "Fel
low Daily Trojan sports writers rejoice. We have made the big
time. We now have a column in the Stanford Daily. Of course
the byline is 'by Dave Canfield,' but the material is ours. We
should feel proud because not many writers edge out the United
Press stories and ads in the Stanford Daily.
"So-called Sports Writer Canfield has made liberal use of mate
rial from Bob Speck's column, one of Tom Braly's track stories and
my interview with Bob Arnett (the latter without any credit what
soever).
"But, on second thought, leaving my name out was the right
thing. Who would want it in that rag?"
Jares has perhaps a valid complaint, so with that, the column
shifts to Mishahawka, Ind., and, passing briefly over Mishahawka
without comment, turns to Seattle, Wash., to begin a study of no-hit
baseball games.
Topped off by Indian moundsnian Bob Leopold's brilliant no
bitter Saturday against the CIBA champion USC Trojans, last
week seems to have been no-hit week at Pacific Coast Conference
colleges. In Seattle, George Kritsonis twirled a "no-no" diamond
effort last Monday against Seattle Pacific College, a red-hot team
whom the Huskies bopped, 18-0.
But Kritsonis' performance pales somewhat when compared with
the feats of ehuckers in the University of Oregon intramural Softball
league.
In last week's action, two Duck intramuralers Ihrew no-hitters
and a third twice pitched eight innings of hit less ball. Chucking no
hitters were Gary Fee <>112 the McClure Hall team and Jerry Laing,
who came within one walk of a perfect game for the Phi Delta
Theta 10.
The most frustrated man of the hour was probably Duane An
karberg, Theta Chi hurler, who came within two outs of a no-hitter
la.';t Monday and one out of a "no-no" tilt last Thursday.
The 1957 University of California quarterback corps, already
strong enough with ace gridder .loe Kapp and possibly also Joe
Confcstabile and C;us Gianulias back, received another boost re
cently when basketlmller Gahe Arrillaga decided to turn out for
spring practice.
As the Daily California!! said, it will be Arrillaga's first fling at
college football alter "four years of the casaba sport."
"This is odd in itself, but it's his ambidexterity that is somewhat
ey.i inordinary.
"A natural left-hander, Gabe can throw a football half the length
of ilie field wilh his left hand, hut he also can throw it about as
far wilh his light hand.
"II has been quite a while since Gabe was a hotshot QB at
Moriiiiigside High, but a player who can throw with reasonable
accuracy with either band running pass-run-option plays from
the split-T should be a welcome addition to any squad."
In Lawrence, Kans., the University Daily Kansan reported Will
Chamberlain "may" receive "competition from a four-year-old." The
paper said that Richard Spohn, four-year-old nephew of KIJ soph
Marcia Opperman, told his aunt he was coming to the university to
visit her soon.
Purpose of the trip is to talk to Wilt the Stilt.
"1 want to talk to him and ask him what he eats to prow so big,"
Richard said.

In last week's action, two Duck intramuralers Ihrew no-hitters
and a third twice pitched eight innings of hit less ball. Chucking no
hitters were Gary Fee <>112 the McClure Hall team and Jerry Laing,
who came within one walk of a perfect game for the Phi Delta
Theta 10.
The most frustrated man of the hour was probably Duane An
karberg, Theta Chi hurler, who came within two outs of a no-hitter
la.';t Monday and one out of a "no-no" tilt last Thursday.
The 1957 University of California quarterback corps, already
strong enough with ace gridder .loe Kapp and possibly also Joe
Confcstabile and C;us Gianulias back, received another boost re
cently when basketlmller Gahe Arrillaga decided to turn out for
spring practice.
As the Daily California!! said, it will be Arrillaga's first fling at
college football alter "four years of the casaba sport."
"This is odd in itself, but it's his ambidexterity that is somewhat
ey.i inordinary.
"A natural left-hander, Gabe can throw a football half the length
of ilie field wilh his left hand, hut he also can throw it about as
far wilh his light hand.
"II has been quite a while since Gabe was a hotshot QB at
Moriiiiigside High, but a player who can throw with reasonable
accuracy with either band running pass-run-option plays from
the split-T should be a welcome addition to any squad."
In Lawrence, Kans., the University Daily Kansan reported Will
Chamberlain "may" receive "competition from a four-year-old." The
paper said that Richard Spohn, four-year-old nephew of KIJ soph
Marcia Opperman, told his aunt he was coming to the university to
visit her soon.
Purpose of the trip is to talk to Wilt the Stilt.
"1 want to talk to him and ask him what he eats to prow so big,"
Richard said.

"This weekend's baseball games against Stanford shouldn't give
the Trojans much of a workout." i
With this Trojan beginning, the rest of this column will be care
fully devoted to omitting news of SC. For the Daily Trojan sports
writers < perhaps feeling their thoughts are very precious and should
be kept to themselves) are mad at this EXCHANGE columnist for
pirating their material.
As their ace writer Joe .Fares recently declared in print, "Fel
low Daily Trojan sports writers rejoice. We have made the big
time. We now have a column in the Stanford Daily. Of course
the byline is 'by Dave Canfield,' but the material is ours. We
should feel proud because not many writers edge out the United
Press stories and ads in the Stanford Daily.
"So-called Sports Writer Canfield has made liberal use of mate
rial from Bob Speck's column, one of Tom Braly's track stories and
my interview with Bob Arnett (the latter without any credit what

thing. Who would want it in that rag?"
