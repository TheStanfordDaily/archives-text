# Freshman Thinclads Meet Mt. San Antonio in Stadium
## Face Season's Stiffest Competition At 3:30 Today; Javelin Is Key to Win 
### Dirk Barnes 
Stanford's frosh trackmen will face their strongest opposition of
the year today at 3:30 in Stanford Stadium when they tangle wilh
Mt. San Antonio College, acclaimed by many as the most powerful
track team in junior college history.
The meet's best competition may be in the distance events, with

the Papooses' Bob Monzingo op
posing Mt. SAC's Ron Larrieu.
In last year's California prep
championships, Larrieu won the
mile in 4:20.1 to edge Monzingo
by six-tenths of one second. This
year Larrieu has already broken
the national JC two-mile record
with a 9:25.3 effort.
Mt. SAC's Jerry White, nation
al prep record holder in the 440,
will be the favorite over Stan
ford's Chuck McKenney and Bob
Besse. White ran 46.7 last year
at Corcoran under the coaching
of Floyd Strain, now the SU
frosh mentor.
A sweep in the javelin may
well be the key to a Stanford vic
tory. Besse's 198-0 throw of Sat
urday ranks as one of the na
tion's best frosh marks, with Jim
Backstrand's 194-0 not far behind.
Kelly in Broad -Jump
John Kelly, who has narrowly
missed the frosh broad jump
mark on several occasions, will
battle the Mounties' Jim Naza
roff, another 23-foot jumper.
In the sprints, it will be the
Papooses' Norm Pease (9.8,
22.0) against Mt. SAC's Bob Er
ickson (9.9, 21.7) and Dave
Schick (9.9, 21.9).
Another close event should be
the pole vault, where the Moun
lies have Duane Allen at 13-7.
Stanford counters with John
Stabler, the frosh record-holder
at 13-8.
Ml. SAC is weakest in the hur
dles. Unfortunately, the frosh
are also weak in these events.
Only low-stick man John Kelly
has turned in impressive times
this spring, and even he will be
pressed by Allen.
Possibly Relay Record
The Papoose mile relay team,
which recently set a new Univer
sity standard of 3:21.9, may be
forced to a better time to head
the Mounties. Mt. SAC has run
the baton event in 3:20.0.
The shot and discus should
also be close, with Stanford need
ing to score well If they are to
win. Mt. SAC must be conceded
the high jump, with A 1 Morris'
0-5Va leap being superior to Stan
ford performances.
Mt. SAC's overall team
strength can best be seen by an
examination of their meet scores,
which show seven wins in seven
starts and over 100 points scored
by the Mounties in six of them.
They topped the UCLA frosh,
104 j/,-26 1 a.

urday ranks as one of the na
tion's best frosh marks, with Jim
Backstrand's 194-0 not far behind.
Kelly in Broad -Jump
John Kelly, who has narrowly
missed the frosh broad jump
mark on several occasions, will
battle the Mounties' Jim Naza
roff, another 23-foot jumper.
In the sprints, it will be the
Papooses' Norm Pease (9.8,
22.0) against Mt. SAC's Bob Er
ickson (9.9, 21.7) and Dave
Schick (9.9, 21.9).
Another close event should be
the pole vault, where the Moun
lies have Duane Allen at 13-7.
Stanford counters with John
Stabler, the frosh record-holder
at 13-8.
Ml. SAC is weakest in the hur
dles. Unfortunately, the frosh
are also weak in these events.
Only low-stick man John Kelly
has turned in impressive times
this spring, and even he will be
pressed by Allen.
Possibly Relay Record
The Papoose mile relay team,
which recently set a new Univer
sity standard of 3:21.9, may be
forced to a better time to head
the Mounties. Mt. SAC has run
the baton event in 3:20.0.
The shot and discus should
also be close, with Stanford need
ing to score well If they are to
win. Mt. SAC must be conceded
the high jump, with A 1 Morris'
0-5Va leap being superior to Stan
ford performances.
Mt. SAC's overall team
strength can best be seen by an
examination of their meet scores,
which show seven wins in seven
starts and over 100 points scored
by the Mounties in six of them.
They topped the UCLA frosh,
104 j/,-26 1 a.
Stanford's frosh trackmen will face their strongest opposition of
the year today at 3:30 in Stanford Stadium when they tangle wilh
Mt. San Antonio College, acclaimed by many as the most powerful
track team in junior college history.
The meet's best competition may be in the distance events, with

the Papooses' Bob Monzingo op
posing Mt. SAC's Ron Larrieu.
In last year's California prep
championships, Larrieu won the
mile in 4:20.1 to edge Monzingo
by six-tenths of one second. This
year Larrieu has already broken
the national JC two-mile record
with a 9:25.3 effort.
Mt. SAC's Jerry White, nation
al prep record holder in the 440,
will be the favorite over Stan
ford's Chuck McKenney and Bob
Besse. White ran 46.7 last year
at Corcoran under the coaching
of Floyd Strain, now the SU
frosh mentor.
A sweep in the javelin may
well be the key to a Stanford vic
tory. Besse's 198-0 throw of Sat
urday ranks as one of the na
tion's best frosh marks, with Jim
Backstrand's 194-0 not far behind.
