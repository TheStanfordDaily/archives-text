# Indians Sink Cal Mermen In Last Event
## 
### 
Lowell Johnson scored a double
sprint victory to lead Stanford to
its 33d straight dual-meet swim
ming win over California Satur
day, 48-38.
The Papoose mermen, compet
ing for the third straight day,
took the freshman meet by the
same score and in the process
turned in the outstanding time of
the day 4:02.3 in the medley
relay.
Actually, the varsity meet went
down to the final 400 relay, which
Johnson anchored, before the vic
tory was in hand.
Johnson turned in an excep
tional 22.f) in the 50-yard free
style and followed with a 52.0
100. In both races he topped Cal's
ace, Ron Volmer.
Only other individual winner
for the Indians, and also a double
winner, was Tom Burton, who
stroked to a 2:12.5) 220 victory
and a 4:56.1 440.
Freshmen Jack Howell, Tim
Timken, Bill Fuller and Tom Pe
tersen combined to swim the
medley even! in what coach Toiri
Haynie believes may be an NCAA
freshman record. Their 4:02.3
clocking bested Cal's winning
time in the varsity meet by a lull
second.
