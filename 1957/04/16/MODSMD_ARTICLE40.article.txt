# Sigma Chi's Retain Basketball Crown, 55-43
## 
### Bob Payne 
Sigma Chi won its second
straight intramural basketball ti
tle last night by going ahead early
in the second quarter and staying
there for a 55-43 victory over the
Betas.
A hustling, alert Sigma Chi de
fense and poor passing on the
part of the Betas played a major
role in the final outcome. Jack
Taylor sparked ihe champs
through a 33-point second half,
scoring 11 points and turning in
a bang-up floor game.
Roeh Conklin. Eric Protiva and
Paul Perko almost completely
dominated the backboards for
Sigma Chi, and the Betas seldom
were able to take more than one
shot before losing possession.

r The Betas took a 10-8 lead at
the end,of the first quarter, with
Chuck Shea and Dick Jones doing
all of the scoring. The champs,
putting together a great team ef
fort, moved out to a 22-17 lead at
i the halfway mark.
All seven Sigma Chi's hit the
| scoring column in the big 20-point
i third period which just about sew-
J ed up the game. The Betas didn't
; hit a field goal until the closing
seconds of the period and could
never get back in the game.
Shea led the evening's scorers
with 16 points. Taylor and sharp
shooting Ben Heirs paced the win
ners with 12 apiece.
