# Anti-Polio Serum Is Still Available At Health Service
## 
### 
In spite of a nationwide short
age, the Stanford Health Service
has a large stock of polio serum.
Shots are available at the Health
Service every Wednesday and
Thursday afternoon from 1 to 4.
Those who have not had any
shots should get the first two in
the series before summer when
the incidence of polio increases.
The first two shots give a signifi
cant degree of immunity. Those
who started the series last au
tumn should get their final shot
this quarter.
The shots cost $1.25 each.
Those under 21 must bring a per
mission sheet signed by their
parents when they have their
first shot.
Immunizations for overseas
travel are being given every
Tuesday from 1 to 4. Students
are urged to start their series of
shots now to avoid the last-min
ute rush.
