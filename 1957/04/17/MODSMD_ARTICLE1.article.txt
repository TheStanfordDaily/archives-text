# P.O. Returns To 'Normal' Mail Service
## Some Changes Remain Even After Congress' 'Overwhelming Vote' 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP)
—Postmaster General Arthur E.
Summerfield restored '/nearly
normal" mail services tonight af
ter President Eisenhower signed
an emergency money bill rushed
through Congress a few hours
earlier.
Summerfield kept on the books
some of the minor parts of the
drastic curtailment that began
last Saturday. But he canceled
the major cutbacks which had
suspended mail deliveries and
post office window service on
Saturdays.
The postal chief acted immedi
ately after Eisenhower had af
fixed his signature to a $41 mil
lion supplementary appropria
tions bill on which Congress com
pleted action earlier today.
The measure provided all but
$6 million of the extra funds
Summerfield said he needed to
keep the postal service going full
blast for the rest of the fiscal
year.
Summerfield "Gratified"
Summerfield said in a state
ment he was "gratified" at the
"overwhelming vote" of Congress
giving the department emer
gency funds to carry it through
the rest of this year.
Summerfield said that mail
service will be back on a nearly
normal basis within 24 hours.
But Summerfield noted that
the measure whipped through the
House and Senate today gave him
only $41 million of the $47 mil
lion he originally sought.
"Difficult Job"
"It can be readily seen that the
department is still faced with a
difficult job to maintain service
within the funds available for
the balance of this fiscal year,"
he said.
Mail service will be normal
with two exceptions. Post office
windows will be operated on an
BV2 - hour schedule Mondays
through Fridays. They had been
open somewhat longer prior to
the cutback ordered by Summer
field last Saturday.
In addition, there will be only
two daily mail deliveries in all
downtown business sections Mon
days through Fridays and one on
Saturday. Previously there had
been as many as three and four
deliveries in some areas.
