# Honeywell, Messinger Qualify For Finals in Re-Run Primary
## McCoy, West Follow Next in Election Returns 
### 
Re-run primary returns for
ASSU president last night boost
ed Wally Honeywell and James
Messinger to the finals by wide
margins.
Finals will be next Monday and
Tuesday.
Out of the 1885 student ballots
~ast, Honneywell pulled 611 and
Messinger 528. Their closest con
tenders were Bowen "Buzz" Mc-
Coy with 320 votes and Kirk
West with 172. No other candi
date got more than 100 votes.
In the Stern and off - campus
Legislature representative pri
maries, also run this week, can
didates qualifying for the finals
were: for Stern representative,
Bob Hershberger with 104 votes
and Charles Haworth with 55;
for off - campus representative,
Tom Thiringer with 49 and David
Long with 45.
The 1885 ballots cast in the re
run ASSU presidential primaries
are 1101 fewer than cast in last
week's invalidated election. On
Thursday and Friday 2986 stu
dents balloted in the primaries.
Reason for Let-down
The "let-down" was more a re
sult of yesterday's balloting than
Monday's. Only about 580 ballots
were cast yesterday, and over
1300 were cast Monday. In last
week's primaries 1404 students
voted the first day.
The light balloting yesterday
came in spite of the fact that 1300
"Vote Today" cards were passed
out by Elections Commission on
Monday and Tuesday.
At its regular weekly meeting
last night, Legislature unani
mously approved the results of
Monday and Tuesday's primaries.
After last week's primaries the
ASSU presidential race results
had to be thrown out because 34
more votes turned up in the bal
lot boxes than could be accounted
for by ballot stubS.
Finals for all ASSU, class and
Men's Council offices will be held
next Monday and Tuesday.
Campaigning Rules'
Candidates are allowed to cam
paign throughout this week. But
they cannot exceed their expense
limit of $20 for the three major
ASSU offices and $10 for every
other office. Every candidate in
the finals must turn in a second
expense account to Karen Peter
son, Elections Commission chair
man, by 5 p.m. Sunday.
Official returns for this week's
primaries not listed above are:
For ASSU president: Bill Duke,
91; James Dunlap, 27; Philip
Hammer, 47; John Jordan, 41.
For Stern representative: Rolf
Hahne, 17; Charles Pilgrim, 36.
For off-campus representative:
William Gale, 18; Robert C. Guild,
9.

Re-run primary returns for
ASSU president last night boost
ed Wally Honeywell and James
Messinger to the finals by wide
margins.
Finals will be next Monday and
Tuesday.
Out of the 1885 student ballots
~ast, Honneywell pulled 611 and
Messinger 528. Their closest con
tenders were Bowen "Buzz" Mc-
Coy with 320 votes and Kirk
West with 172. No other candi
date got more than 100 votes.
In the Stern and off - campus
Legislature representative pri
maries, also run this week, can
didates qualifying for the finals
were: for Stern representative,
Bob Hershberger with 104 votes
and Charles Haworth with 55;
for off - campus representative,
Tom Thiringer with 49 and David
Long with 45.
The 1885 ballots cast in the re
run ASSU presidential primaries
are 1101 fewer than cast in last
week's invalidated election. On
Thursday and Friday 2986 stu
dents balloted in the primaries.
Reason for Let-down
The "let-down" was more a re
sult of yesterday's balloting than
Monday's. Only about 580 ballots
were cast yesterday, and over
1300 were cast Monday. In last
week's primaries 1404 students
voted the first day.
The light balloting yesterday
came in spite of the fact that 1300
"Vote Today" cards were passed
out by Elections Commission on
Monday and Tuesday.
At its regular weekly meeting
last night, Legislature unani
mously approved the results of
Monday and Tuesday's primaries.
After last week's primaries the
ASSU presidential race results
had to be thrown out because 34
more votes turned up in the bal
lot boxes than could be accounted
for by ballot stubS.
Finals for all ASSU, class and
Men's Council offices will be held
next Monday and Tuesday.
Campaigning Rules'
Candidates are allowed to cam
paign throughout this week. But
they cannot exceed their expense
limit of $20 for the three major
ASSU offices and $10 for every
other office. Every candidate in
the finals must turn in a second
expense account to Karen Peter
son, Elections Commission chair
man, by 5 p.m. Sunday.
Official returns for this week's
primaries not listed above are:
For ASSU president: Bill Duke,
91; James Dunlap, 27; Philip
Hammer, 47; John Jordan, 41.
For Stern representative: Rolf
Hahne, 17; Charles Pilgrim, 36.
For off-campus representative:
William Gale, 18; Robert C. Guild,
9.
