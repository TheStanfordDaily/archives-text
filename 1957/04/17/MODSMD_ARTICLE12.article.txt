## 
### 
GALVESTON, Tex., April 16
(UP) —The executive board of
the 1.325,000-member Internation
al Brotherhood of Teamsters de
cided today to spurn a summons
before an AFL-CIO investigating
comittee on charges of domina
tion by corrupt influences.
At the same time, the board

asked Dave Beck, 62 - year - old
president of the brotherhood, and
George Meany, president of the
AFL-CIO, to appoint committees
to discuss Beck's suspension
from the Executive Council of
the parent union.
The AFL-CIO executive board
suspended Beck after he took ref
uge 117 times in the Fifth
Amendment while a Senate com
mittee was questioning him
about union affairs, and mainly
about what happened to $320,000
from the union treasury.
"Taking: the Rap"
Beck was quoted last night as
saying in Galveston that if he
talked he "might blow the lid off"
and that he was "taking the rap
for a lot of fine people."
Senator Karl Mundt (R-S.D.)
said in Little Rock, Ark., today
that when he gets back to Wash
ington, he is going to ask that
Beck be given a chance to "put
up or shut up."
Mundt is a member of the Sen
ate subcommittee investigating
labor racketeering.
"I don't intend to let any man
who invokes the Fifth Amend
ment smear the entire Senate
without just cause," Mundt said.
Closed Meeting
The executive board's decisions
were in the form of two resolu
tions adopted at a special, closed
meeting in Galveston. As the
meeting broke up, Beck com
plained he had been misquoted
about "blowing the lid off" in
Washington.
He was asked about Mundt's
statement, and said, "I was mis

quoted. I didn't say anything like
that."
When he was reminded that
the New York Times had printed
it as a quotation, he said, "I do
not form the policy or write the
stories of the New York Times.
I could not blow the lid off the
Senate and I wouldn't if I could."

"Taking: the Rap"
Beck was quoted last night as
saying in Galveston that if he
talked he "might blow the lid off"
and that he was "taking the rap
for a lot of fine people."
Senator Karl Mundt (R-S.D.)
said in Little Rock, Ark., today
that when he gets back to Wash
ington, he is going to ask that
Beck be given a chance to "put
up or shut up."
Mundt is a member of the Sen
ate subcommittee investigating
labor racketeering.
"I don't intend to let any man
who invokes the Fifth Amend
ment smear the entire Senate
without just cause," Mundt said.
Closed Meeting
The executive board's decisions
were in the form of two resolu
tions adopted at a special, closed
meeting in Galveston. As the
meeting broke up, Beck com
plained he had been misquoted
about "blowing the lid off" in
Washington.
He was asked about Mundt's
statement, and said, "I was mis

quoted. I didn't say anything like
that."
When he was reminded that
the New York Times had printed
it as a quotation, he said, "I do
not form the policy or write the
stories of the New York Times.
I could not blow the lid off the
Senate and I wouldn't if I could."
GALVESTON, Tex., April 16
(UP) —The executive board of
the 1.325,000-member Internation
al Brotherhood of Teamsters de
cided today to spurn a summons
before an AFL-CIO investigating
comittee on charges of domina
tion by corrupt influences.
At the same time, the board

asked Dave Beck, 62 - year - old
president of the brotherhood, and
George Meany, president of the
AFL-CIO, to appoint committees
to discuss Beck's suspension
from the Executive Council of
the parent union.
The AFL-CIO executive board
suspended Beck after he took ref
uge 117 times in the Fifth
Amendment while a Senate com
mittee was questioning him
about union affairs, and mainly
about what happened to $320,000
from the union treasury.
