MOSCOW, April 16 (UP)â€”So
viet Defense Minister Georgi Zhu
kov today warned the West in
general and thie United States in
particular that they "blindly over
estimate" their own strength and
"under rate" the potential power
of Russia and her allies.
He said the West has only "im
aginary" atomic and aerial supe
riority.
The defense minister, in a state
ment released on his arrival home
from establishing a pact for "tem
porary" stationing of Soviet
troops in Romania, threatened
massive nuclear retaliation

"Let everyone trying to unleash
a new war know that we, with all
our passion, bravery and gallan
try, will defend our socialist camp
as a united whole," he said.

Soviet doctrine that any attack on
one member of the Communist

tack on all -a doctrine similar to
thai i>f the Western NATO alli
