### 
WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP)
â€”The Air Force, beset by a series
of technical problems, now ex
pects to have its first atom-pow
ered combat plane in six or seven
years, it was learned today.
After a series of stops, starts
and stretch-outs, the Air Force
has set up a firm schedule for the
plane which was said to have
pleased members of the Senate-
House Atomic Energy Committee.
Air Force Secretary Donald A.
Quarles has been describing the
new schedule in a series of closed
door appearances before congres
sional committees.
Specific Date Given
While his testimony has not
been publicly disclosed, Quarles
was reported to have given to
members of the House - Senate
Atomic Energy Committee the
specific date by which the Air
Force expects to have a prototype
plane flying.
It was learned elsewhere that
military officials expect to have
an actual atomic-powered combat
plane in the air by 1963 or 1964.
Chairman Richard B. Russell
(D-Ga.) of the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee recently talked
of restoring several hundred mil
lion dollars to the Air Force budg
et for atomic plane development.
No "Dollar Problem"
Quarles has said the Air Force
at one point wanted more than
$600 million for the project in its
new budget. But he said it now
considers the more than $200 mil
lion it is asking as adequate.
He said the former speed-up
program would have cost $t bil
lion to $3 billion by the time
atomic planes were available in
operational numbers.
