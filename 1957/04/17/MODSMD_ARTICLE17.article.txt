# On Budget Cutting
## 
### 
TfiF. ANNOUNCEMENT came yesterday tlial the
House has approved a 26 per rent out in the
U.S. Information Agency budget. Construction
will be delayed on the $23 million veterans
hospital to be built on Stanford land. The
reason—budget-cutting Congress is at it again.
According to Congressman Charles Gubser,
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee could
restore the funds again. We hope lliey do.
The places where Congress has been wielding
the scissors lately have been rather distressing,
to say the least. Congress yesterday, fortunate
ly, rectified one of its budget-cutting areas by
giving Postmaster General Arthur Sumnierfield
$41 million badly needed for operation of the
Post Office Department for the rest of the cur
rent fiscal year. We sincerely hope that this
country will not he treated to another spectacle
of being deprived of Saturday mail.

Such items as those for national
defense seem to he relatively free from the
congressional axe. Our growing tremendous
stock of hydrogen bombs will attest to that.
We are not against maintaining a strong
national defense, but we are against the prin
ciple of letting most of the funds toward this
expenditure go untouched while items such as
economic and technical aid overseas and badly
needed health and educational facilities at
home, are cut to the bare minimum.
An over-all evaluation of our whole spend
ing philosophy is needed. Admitting that high
taxes and high spending are here to stay, we
should take a more careful check of where the
taxpayers' money is being channeled, rather
than cutting a million here and a million there
off perhaps vitally needed programs at home
and abroad.
