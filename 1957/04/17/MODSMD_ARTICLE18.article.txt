Housing ami Representation
Editor, The Daily:
This letter is in answer to the letter written
by the ASSU By-Laws Committee, April 12, in
regard to the election of the Moore Hall Legis
lature representative, I do not feel that this let
ter is the place to discuss the poor conduct of
certain members of the Legislature who found it
convenient to interrupt the last business meeting
of AWS to announce their proposed change, and
who felt impelled to okay the printing of the
letter of the 12th without first discussing the
problem with the organization involved. Their
disregard for the purposes, policies and person
nel of other campus organizations is apparent
and need not be dwelt upon. Therefore, the fol
lowing portion of this letter is directed to the
question brought forth by the Legislature.
According to the AWS Housing Regulations
as they now stand, all girls are required to draw
for housing at the end of their freshman and
sophomore years. The ASSU Legislature has
requested that this be changed to allow a sopho
more from Florence Moore Hall, if she is elected
representative to the Legislature for the follow
ing year, to remain in Moore Hall and not be re
quired to draw with the rest of her class.
Since only one exception to the Housing Reg
ulations was being requested, the Legislature
did not seem to feel that this would affect the
present housing system in any major way or
that AWS would have any real reason for oppos
ing this change. However, I feel that those who
proposed such a change have overlooked several
important factors which would make such a
change very undesirable.
In the first place, the Housing Regulations
now in effect were established by the women
students last year as Ihe best system by which
to satisfy the housing desires of all the women.
By allowing the exception of the Moore Hall
representative, and in all fairness a similar ex
ception to the women living on the Row and in
Union, we would be setting a precedent of allow
ing exceptions in subsequent issues which may
arise and would thereby destroy the policy set up
by the women.
Secondly, I was told that this change was be
ing requested because Legislature felt that the
sophomore class was being disenfranchised on
Legislature and, therefore, in student govern
ment. I wonder if the Legislature has stopped
to consider the present freshman class which in
essence is entirely disenfranchised each year as
they move to areas whose representatives have
been elected the previous spring. Also, if Lagu
nita is changed to an all-sophomore dorm, a mat
ter which is under serious discussion at the pres
ent time, what happens to the 355 girls now
living in Lagunita as sophomores who will not
be allowed to return there and, therefore, will
have no representative on next year's Legisla
ture elected by them. It seems to me that 355
women should not be allowed to remain with no
representative elected by them when at the end
of the year they are dispersed throughout the
rest of the areas.
Thirdly, I believe that the Legislature as set
up is composed of area representatives and not
class representatives. Because this is true, I feel
that the people living in a certain area during a
given year should be allowed to elect the person
who is to represent the area during that year.
In other words, I feel that the area representa
tive should be elected in the autumn by those
people he or she will represent and not by those
who lived in the area the preceding year, one
half of whom are not in attendance at Stanford
during the time the representative serves on
Legislature. If this were done, all classes would
have a chance to be represented and all the stu
dents living in the area would have a voice in
who represented them. In the past, Roble, Bran
ner and Wilbur Hall freshman representatives
have had to be elected in the autumn and if Lagu
nita is made into an all-sophomore dorm their
election will also have to be held in the autumn.
If these areas can successfully elect their repre
sentatives in the autumn, why can't all areas
elect in the autumn as well?
T firmly feel that if the present Legislature
gives this question adequate thought they will
find that a change in the present Housing Regu
lations will actually solve none 1 of their represen
tation problems and will only give certain sopho
mores who are elected representatives an advan
tage over their classmates as far as housing is
concerned, and may even encourage certain soph
omores who desire to remain in their present
area to run for Legislature representative for
the sole purpose of not having to draw at the
end of the year.
I do not feel that a question like this should

be decided in favor of one method purely because
it is easier to change a standing rule of AWS
than to change an ASSU By-Law.

Thanks from Secretary-General
Letter to the student body concerning the Model
United Nations:
In my opinion, the events of last week put a
real strain on the tradition-worn idea that apa
thetic best describes student activities at .Stan
ford. The 550 student delegates who participated
in the Model United Nations told the Secretariat
staff that the Seventh Session was obviously an
all-out effort by the student body to give them
four days they could profit from and enjoy. They
commented that their personal reception in din
ing halls, fraternities and eating clubs was
friendly, that the Stanford procedural officers
were helpful and sharp, and that they were
amazed by the hundreds of people who made up
the total organization.
Personally, I've had fun working with the
Model UN. The 12 members of the Secretariat
staff took on a job that called for meetings every
week of this year, some unusual reliability and
a lot of co-operation. The success of our four
day session and the fact that they can still say
it was fun are the measure of their ability. My
personal thanks to Judy Wharton, Sandy Bull,
Randy Freeman, Stu Pollak, Steve Breyer, Bill
Crookston, Kay Hamilton, Wally Simpson, Ka
ren Erickson, Phyllis Turner, Craig Barnes and
Micki Pike.
The Model UN grew out of the lIR seven
years ago and was a part of its activity this
year. Herb Hymans and his staff all assisted the
MUN. We asked for, and got, manpower and
brains from every sort of student organization
on campus. Eating clubs and fraternities shoved
their own members into the kitchen to make
room for feeding delegates. A Phi O moved
chairs and tables and Axe Society ushered. We
commended The Daily on Monday for full co
operation and the extra work MUN required.
Ram's Head designed and staged our sessions in
Mem Aud. And the Law School provided many
lawyers-to-be for an International Court.
I don't know how much of the excellent ROTC
performance as honor guard and security guard
was prior drill training and how much was en
thusiasm for the MUN, but both must have been
there. A second special note of appreciation is
due the Stanford Men's Glee Club for giving an
other of their polished concerts, although the
majority of delegates seemed to find other things
to do that night.
Bob Freelen, Bill Mathewson and Steve Tallent
each devoted a good amount of time to the
"MUN cause," and cut down our problems with
their co-operation. Space limitation will allow
only mention of faculty and administration mem
bers who assisted the Secretariat. They are Mrs.
Knowles, Mrs. Michaud, Mr. Glover, Dr. Yarbor
ounrh, Mr. Allen. Mr. Cuthbertson and Dr. Roth
well. Dr. Watkins gave us the answers to
protocol and arrangement problems, and Mr.
Steele led the procedural officers' training class.
These individuals gave uS the co-opcration we
got from the administration.
Dr. Tsiang accepted our invitation to speak to
the Model United Nations at the late date of just
six days before we heard him in Memorial Audi
torium. He explained as he opened his address
that he applauded such activity as our model
sessions because in such is the cure to ignorance
of other peoples which has often led to disaster
on an international scale. I am greatly satisfied
with the generous support of the student body
in our project, and hereby convey the apprecia
tion of the Secretariat staff.

Model UN Seventh Session
IFC Resolution 'Hogwash'
Editor, The Daily:
The recent IFC resolution condemning racial
restrictions is pure hogwash and merely intended
to get favorable publicity for an unfavorable
situation. This stand does'little more than say,
"We are againsl sin."
The best way to attack the problem is to insure
t'.iat each house with restrictive clauses is ac
tively working to eliminate them. The best way
to insure this is to grant a two-year probationary
period and then kick them off campus if Ihey
have not made any progress in that time.
Restrictive clauses can be, are, and have been
eliminated from national charters by active
groups of college chapters working to eliminate
them.
