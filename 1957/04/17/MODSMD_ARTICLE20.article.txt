# 61 Lands Help WHO Combat Human Misery
## 
### 
Sixty - one countries of the
world decided in 1946 that the
best way to combat the diseases
and misery of humanity was
through combined efforts and
the result was the World Health
Organization.
The constitution of the organi
zation, adopted on July 22, ]94G,
defines health as "... a state of
complete physical, mental and
social well-being and not merely
the absence of disease or infirm
ity."
Members of WITO declare,
"The enjoyment of the highest
attainable standard of health is
one of the fundamental rights of
every human being without dis
tinction of race, religion, political
belief and economic or social con
ditions. The health of all peoples
is fundamental to the attainment
of peace and security and de
pends upon the fullest co-opera
tion of individuals and States."
Accepting the WHO principles,
measures are being taken by the
members to improve the social
and economic standards of coun
tries all over the world.
Control of syphilis in Bosnia,
now a part of Yugoslavia, is an
example of the work done by
WHO. Historical evidence shows
that syphilis was introduced into
Bosnia by the? Ottoman armies.
