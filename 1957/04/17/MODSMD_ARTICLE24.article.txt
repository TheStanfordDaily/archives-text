# Cards Drop Aztecs, 7-5; Stop Ninth-Inning Rally
## 
### 
Choking off a big threat in the ninth inning, the Stanford Indians
defeated a tough .San Diego State nine, 7-5, yesterday in a drizzle
on the Sunken Diamond.
Starting pitcher Ed Verdurmen ran into control trouble in the
ninth and gave up two runs before reliefer Dick Jones came on to

call a halt to proceedings. Jones
got one batter on a ground ball,
allowing a third run to score, and
caught Jim Richardson looking at
a third strike to end the game.
Otherwise it was a fine per
formance for Verdurmen. The
veteran right-hander was tagged
for two runs and two hits in the
first inning, but coasted through
the middle seven giving up no
runs and only three hits.
Figneroa Singles
Stanford got one of the early
runs back in its half of the first
frame. Bob Fletcher walked, ad
vanced to second on a passed ball
and scored on Rudy Figueroa's
single.
The Cards brought three more
across in the second. A 1 Shaw,
Rich DeFabio, Ralph Holding and
Verdurmen had singles during the
frame, with Holding coming home
on Wayne Marion's squeeze play.
Stanford wrapped it up in the
fourth with singles from Marion
and Shaw and a pair of Aztec
errors.
lOleven llits
Bob Lusky went all the way for
the Aztecs, giving up 11 hits to
the healthy hitting Cards. Shaw,
DeFabio and Holding, each with
two .singles, paced Dutch Fehr
ing's varsity club at the plate. All
of Stanford's hits were one-basers.
