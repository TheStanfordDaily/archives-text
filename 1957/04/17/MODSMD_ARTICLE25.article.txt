# Papooses Seeking Sixth Straight Win In Menlo JC Tilt
## 
### 
When the Stanford Papooses
take the field against the Menlo
Junior College Braves this after
noon they will be seeking their
sixth straight win. The Papooses
have yet to lose this season.
"However," voices frosh mentor
Dick Clegg, "it may be our tough
est game." Menlo's 1957 squad
has been tagged "good," with bal
anced hitting and some exception
al pitching. Much of the visitors'
power comes from the bat of left
handed outfielder Ron Falk.
Slugging outfielder-pitcher Dick
Williams will lead the frosh on
the mound. Williams picked up
his one win last Saturday with
a 4-3 score over Roosevelt High
School. Mo Le√ülanc will stand by
to relieve.
Left-fielder Juan Serralles may
be out of action today. Ho in
jured his foot last week. If Ser
ralles is unable to play, Clegg will
move Ron Perkocha over from
right field and put A 1 Pitkanen in
right.
Earlier this season the junior
varsity squeezed by Menlo, 9-8.
In another tussle between these
two teams, the'weatherman called
it quits with a 2-2 tie unresolved.
Menlo coach Joe Wheustroff
will throw one of two right-hand
ers against the frosh; both have
proved valuable assets to his club.
Either Hal Morrison or Joe Pol
hamus will start for the visitors.
Clegg's starting lineup and bat
ting order will be: Kober, 2b;
Tiederman, 3b; Burk, ss; Serral
les (?), If; Williams, p; Hendry,
lb; Perkocka, rf; Winter, o; and
Cole, of.
