## Indians Face Tough Bruins On Saturday 
### 
The second of three consecutive
dual meets against schools from
the Los Angeles area faces Stan
ford Saturday when the Indians
meet the UCLA Bruins in a track
and field encounter at Westwood.
Both teams will be attempting to
rebound from setbacks suffered
last weekend at the hands of pow
erful ooponents.
Stanford put up one of its best
showings in recent years, but still
lost to Southern California, 72-59.
The Bruins entered their meet
against Occidental as substantial
favorites, but came off on the
short end of a 74 'ft-56% score.
Beating UCLA will be no small
task, with the Bruins boasting sev
eral key members of the 1956
squad which won the Coast Con
ference championship and then
took first place in the NCAA
meet.
Distance Ace
Headlining tin* returnees from
that team is Bobby Seaman, the
Bruins' senior (list an c e ace.
Against Oxy, Seaman ran the
mile in 4:05.6, fastest outdoor time
in the nation this spring.
Rafer Johnson, one of the great
est all-around athletes in spike
history, will probably still not be
in peak condition for the Indians.
Johnson underwent a knee opera
tion from Which he has not yet
fully recovered.
Normally an outstanding sprin
ter and hurdler, he has been un
able to hurdle at all or sprint at
top speed because of the injury.
Johnson has also been forced to
lay out of broad jump competi
tion, so will probably compete in
only the shot-put, javelin and dis
cus instead of his usual six to
eight events.
Fine Man
In Don Vick the Bruins have
one of the nation's finest weight
men. Last year he was second in
NCAA discus competition and fin
ished foitrth in the shot-put.
More Bruin injury problems
center about sprinter Dave James.
He has run 9.8 and 21.6 this year,
but has been bothered by a sore
leg. Then last week he got hit in
his good leg with a discus and
failed to run well against Oxy.
Russ Ellis furnishes coach Duck
Drake with plenty of strength
anywhere from the 220 to 880.
Ellis' best race) 1 is the 440, where
he has run as fast as 46.6. This
season he has yet to crack 48.0,
but could do it. under the pressure
of a tight race with the Indians'
speedy Don Chesarek.

men. Last year he was second in
NCAA discus competition and fin
ished foitrth in the shot-put.
More Bruin injury problems
center about sprinter Dave James.
He has run 9.8 and 21.6 this year,
but has been bothered by a sore
leg. Then last week he got hit in
his good leg with a discus and
failed to run well against Oxy.
Russ Ellis furnishes coach Duck
Drake with plenty of strength
anywhere from the 220 to 880.
Ellis' best race) 1 is the 440, where
he has run as fast as 46.6. This
season he has yet to crack 48.0,
but could do it. under the pressure
of a tight race with the Indians'
speedy Don Chesarek.
The second of three consecutive
dual meets against schools from
the Los Angeles area faces Stan
ford Saturday when the Indians
meet the UCLA Bruins in a track
and field encounter at Westwood.
Both teams will be attempting to
rebound from setbacks suffered
last weekend at the hands of pow
erful ooponents.
Stanford put up one of its best
showings in recent years, but still
lost to Southern California, 72-59.
The Bruins entered their meet
against Occidental as substantial
favorites, but came off on the
short end of a 74 'ft-56% score.
Beating UCLA will be no small
task, with the Bruins boasting sev
eral key members of the 1956
squad which won the Coast Con
ference championship and then
took first place in the NCAA
meet.
Distance Ace
Headlining tin* returnees from
that team is Bobby Seaman, the
Bruins' senior (list an c e ace.
Against Oxy, Seaman ran the
mile in 4:05.6, fastest outdoor time
in the nation this spring.
Rafer Johnson, one of the great
est all-around athletes in spike
history, will probably still not be
in peak condition for the Indians.
Johnson underwent a knee opera
tion from Which he has not yet
fully recovered.
Normally an outstanding sprin
ter and hurdler, he has been un
able to hurdle at all or sprint at
top speed because of the injury.
Johnson has also been forced to
lay out of broad jump competi
tion, so will probably compete in
only the shot-put, javelin and dis
cus instead of his usual six to
eight events.
Fine Man
In Don Vick the Bruins have
one of the nation's finest weight
men. Last year he was second in
