# U.S. WOMEN LUCKY'
## Japan's Former First Lady Meets Sterling, Tours SU 
### Barbara Bachman 
Madame Aso, former "first lady" of Japan, arrived on the Stan
ford campus yesterday afternoon to meet President Wallace Ster
ling, tour Memorial Church and meet with Mrs. Inez Richardson,
Executive Assistant and Research Associate of Hoover Institute and

Library.
The charming, petite daughter

3f former Prime Minister Shigeru
Yoshida expressed her enthusi
asm over the beauty and facili
ties of Stanford and explained
that women in American colleges
and universities are much luckier
than Japanese w,omen.
This, she said, comes from the
immense population in Japan and
the shortage of "white - collar"
jobs. She said men are reluctant
to hire women in any type of job,
and their prejudice is understand
ably based on extremely alarming
facts.
Education a "Fad"
Education among the Japanese
has seen a growing trend for the
past few years and has now be
come a "fad;" a "craze" of which
"every Tom, Dick and Harry"
takes advantage, she said.
Farmers and carpenters are tak
ing their children from their for
merly hereditary occupations, en
rolling them in state - supported
schools and expecting them to
enter high-paying, socially supe
rior positions, she continued.
Speaking in perfect, fluent Eng
lish, Madame Aso explained that
men have a difficult time acquir
ing decent jobs, and that women
in business are making the prob
lem even more serious.
Commenting on the influence of
the American Occupation on edu
cation, she pointed out several
basic problems with which the
majority of Japanese were dissat
isfied.
Newly-Learned Freedom
The American has given the
Japanese student freedom, liberty
and equality, she said, but. has
failed to inform him of the re
sponsibility accompanying this
newly-learned freedom. This has
resulted in the unfortunate situa
tion of a carefree, unconscientious
youth, inadequately prepared to
assume future responsibilities.
Other problems resulting from
the occupation lie in the fields of
religion and textbooks. Formerly
the state religion of Shinto was
taught in all schools and courses.
Now the Americans have integrat
ed their ideal of church-state sepa
ration in Japanese education,
causing ;t great deal of resent
ment and antagonism, she pointed
out.
Legends and myths pertaining
to history have been deleted from
the American-edited and authored
textbooks, depriving ihe young
people of the age-old tradition of
mythical history, of wlwch the
Japanese are so proud, she said.
