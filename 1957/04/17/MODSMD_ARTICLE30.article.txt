# Larrieu Smashes JC Record As Mounties Crush Freshmen
## 
### 
Ron Larrieu won two events
and cracked the national JC rec
ord in the two-mile to lead Mt.
San Antonio College to a tight
73 :, .;-57'i; victory over the Stanford
frosh yesterday in Stanford Sta
dium.
Larrieu won the day's opening
event, the mile, in the good time
of 4:18.6 and then returned to
crack his own two-mile record by
more than two seconds as he ran
9:23.1.
Stanford's distance ace Bob
Monzingo was a close second in
the mile, crossing the finish in
4:20.3, the best time of his career.
Kelly Wins- Two
John Kelly won two events for
the frosh. He first won the broad
jump with a leap of 23-1% and
then sped over 220-yard low hur
dles in 24.4.
Half-miler Dick Lassen record
ed his best mark of the year as
he out kicked Mt. SAC's Bruce
Knapp in a tight finish.
Jim Backstrand and Tom La
gerquist helped the Indian cause
with field event victories. Back
strand upset teammate Bob Besse

with a javelin throw of 194-4, j
while Lagerquist won a close vie- j
tory in the discus.
Pease Atones
Sprinter Norm Pease atoned for
his defeat in the 100 by running
off with the 220 in a season's best
effort of 21.7. The other Papoose
victory was contributed by John
Stahler, who won the pole vault
at a height of 13-0.
The day's closing event, the
mile relay, was close all the way,
with Mt. SAC's Jerry White out
kicking Pease for the tape. White
had earlier won the 440 in 47.9.
He ran for Papoose coach Floyd
Strain last year at Corcoran High,
where he set a new national prep
record of 40.7.
The defeat dropped the frosh
season record to 3-2, but gave
them the distinction of having
done far better against the potenl
I Mt. SAC team than has any other
frosh squad. The Mounties rolled
up 88 points against USC's Tro
babes and ran wild to score 104
against the UCLA frosh.
