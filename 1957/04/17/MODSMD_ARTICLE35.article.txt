# ASSU Officers Explain Jobs To 'Conscientious' Candidates
## Student Body Candidates 'Very Interested' In Office, But Not in Policy of Administration 
### John Lane 
Campus elections are affecting the student body in various ways,
but what is happening among the members of the present adminis
tration during these election days?
This year's number of candidates for ASSU and class offices
is far greater than last year's, and the lack of apathy toward

student elections which this seems
to indicate is expressed in the
effort to which the candidates are
going to find out about their pos
sible new jobs.
The present members of the
student government are still go
ing about their duties, with no
outward anxiety about the elec
tions. However, along with their
regular jobs, they perform the
function of answering questions
about the jobs which the now of
ficers may undertake.
Candidates this year seem to be
taking a conscientious interest in
finding out what they might do
next year in the governmental
field.
Visit Office
Many presidential candidates
have talked recently with Bob
Freelen, the present ASSU presi
dent. Freelen said recently that
so far he had talked to "five or
six" of the candidates about the
duties the job entails, as well as
about suggestions for campaign
tactics.
Freelen said he and the other
members of Legislature are re
maining neutral toward the candi
dates, and that he particularly is
"giving the same advice to every
one." Naturally, he would see
more often the people he knows
personally, but said he is giving
no extra help to anyone.
Vice-president Sue Coshow said
one or two of the vice-presidential
candidates had spoken to her;
however, these did not seem as
interested as the candidates for
president in speaking to the in
cumbent officers.
Talk to Freelen
The ASSU office itself has been
visited often in the past few
weeks, particularly by candidates
for class business managers. Mrs.
Elizabeth Stone, Legislature sec
retary, said class office candidates
are "very interested this year" in
all the affairs of the ASSU office,
studying particularly the finan
cial accounts of the class organi
zations.
The University administration
itself has not had many visits by
candidates, although Dean of Men
William Craig said before prima
ries last week that he had been
visited by two hopeful officers,
and that a few had gone to see
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler.
