# AS INTERN
## Stanfordite Meets UN Sec.-General 
### Dave Canfield 
Meeting UN Secretary-General
Dag Hammarskjold and Mrs. El
eanor Roosevelt and getting a
mild case of food poisoning at an
ambassador's party highlighted
Chuck Reynolds' internship to the
United Nations last summer.
Reynolds, secretary . general of
the recent Model United Nations
here, served as an intern in the
Education Section of the UN for
eight weeks last summer.
Of Hammarskjold, whom the
senior classics major met at the
interns' "graduation" program,
Reynolds said, "I was very much
impressed with the modesty of
the man and with his intense de
votion to his job."
Mrs. Roosevelt invited Reyn
olds' intern group to her summer
home north of New York city for
a Saturday visit.
Speaking Skill
"At that particular time," the
Stanford intern recalled, "I was
amazed by her speaking ability.
I admire her continuing interest,
especially in the social problems
of the United Nations."
Another "highlight" was the
party and buffet dinner which the
Indonesian ambassador in New
York threw for the UN interns
and which, as Reynolds said, "un
fortunately resulted in about 20
interns being affected by a mild
case of food poisoning.
"Fortunately, I was affectedâ€”
but not in the usual way. I should
say that the food poisoning was
entirely unintentional and unfor
tunate," he added, "considering
the fine hospitality of the ambas
sador."
Each intern, Reynolds said, is
assigned to a particular depart
ment of the United Nations to do
either specific UN work or his
own individual study.
40 Lectures
"During the eight weeks of the
pro g r a m," he remarked, "we
heard a total of 40 lectures given
by senior secretariat officials,
which touched on every part of
the work of the UN Secretariat
staff."
To qualify for an internship,
Reynolds said, an applicant must
have advanced academic standing,
be concerned with the policies of
his country and be in a leadership
position in an organization direct
ly connected with the UN.
Selection is made by a group of
secretariat officials entitled the
Intern Selection Board, which at
tempts to secure a wide variety
of nationals.
$380 Stipends
Interns receive $380 stipends,
covering living expenses. Provid
ing this money are U.S. university
scholarships, U N international
grants and the applicants them
selves.
Those admitted to the program
at their own expense are classi
fied as "auditor-libres," which,
said Reynolds, "means you hear
for free.
"But," he said, "you don't."
All interns begin their stay in
New York in the International
House, Reynolds said.
"However, many of the interns,
including myself, found apart
ments around the city after a
short time."
In conclusion, Reynolds said he
felt "loss of sleep and 10 pounds"
were the only disadvantages to
his UN stay. He said his experi
ence had helped prepare him for
a future career in either law or
political science.
