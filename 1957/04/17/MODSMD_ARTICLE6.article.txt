# Sun's Energy Will Be Used For Food, Heat

### Barbara Hicks 
The Sun Age will be the richest
period of mankind, prophesied Fa
ther Time in the partially ani
mated film "Our Mr. Sun" last,
night at the Tuesday Evening Lec
ture Series in Memorial Audito
rium.
Father Time and Mr. Sun join
ed with Dr. Frank Baxter, Uni
versity of Southern California
English professor, and film stars
Eddie Albert and Lionel Barry
more to present the story of the
sun.
Solar Battery
Among current progress toward
the Sun Age is the solar battery,
according to the film. The power
from the boron and silicon bat
tery, from phosphorous products
such as wallpaper which retains
the sunlight for night use, and
from the use of glass will replace
the rapidly dwindling supplies of
fuel.
In 1850, men were using 400
horsepower - hours of fuel, com
pared with 10,000 in 1950 and a
predicted 20,000 in 1075. Scien
tists said in the film that energy
from the sun will have to be used
if men are to survive.
Food supplies form another
problem. Common food plants use
only enough sun energy to pro
duce two tons of food an acre,
while the sun transmits energy to
produce 20 tons an acre. Chlo
rella, a plant which will utilize
more of the sun's energy, is the
subject of current experiments.
In Five Minnies
Energy from the sun is equal
to four billion hydrogen bombs
exploding every second. In lerms
of dollars, in five minutes the sun
produces enough kilowatt power
to pay the national debt.
Discussion of sun spots, corona,
solar particles and ancient wor
ship of the sun which is 93 mil
lion miles from the earth and
equal to the weight of 330,000
earths was also included in the
show.
The film was preceded by re
marks by Albert Baez, visiting
professor of physics.
