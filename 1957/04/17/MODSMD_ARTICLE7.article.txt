### 
AMMAN, April 16 (UP)—King

allegiance from 200 Bedouin
chieftains and moved swiftly on
other military and diplomatic
fronts to consolidate his victory
over pro-Egyptian and leftist ele
ments in his government.
But high Jordanian sources in
Cairo predicted that Jordan faced
more trouble. They said the new
moderate cabinet formed yester
-lay would not last long, even
•hough the left-wing parties prob
ably would support it.
Hussein was reported pressing
anew for another summit, confer
ence with the leaders of Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Syria to

(In Beirut, Lebanon, informed

rael planned an attack. The
sources said this was a Soviet
move to thwart Hussein and keep
pro - Soviet Premier Nabulsi in
power.)
The Bedouin tribal chiefs, who
have 30,000 armed men behind
them, rallied to Hussein in his
palace overlooking Amman.
