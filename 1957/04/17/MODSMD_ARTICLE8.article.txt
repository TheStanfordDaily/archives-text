# Suez Negotiations May Be Brought Before UN Again

### 
WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP)
—The United States, Britain and
France probably will ask the
United Nations Security Council
within a day or so to consider the
stalemated Suez Canal negotia
tions with Egypt.
The development was reported
by diplomatic officials after the
State Department refused to say
whether a final decision had been
made. Department Press Officer
Lincoln White said he did not
want "to comment, 'yes or no.' "
The United States is continuing
its Cairo negotiations with Egypt
on Suez Canal operating proce
dures. But Egypt was said to
have made no real concessions
and apparently was insisting on
operating the canal on its own
terms.
The U.S.-Egyptian talks started
March 31. Since then, according
to informants, Egyptian Presi
dent Gamal Abdel Nasser has re
fused to budge on several key
points which the United States
sought to clear up. They are:
• Egyptian agreement on a
plan for co-operation between
Egypt and canal users on opera
tion and management of the
canal.
• Incorporation in the operat
ing agreement of the six princi
ples laid down by the Security
Council Oct. 13 for canal opera
tions. Among other things, they
called for non-discriminatory use
of the canal.
• Some injection of interna
tional flavor into the Egyptian
proposal. The United States
wants to have the Egyptian docu
ment filed under the United Na
tions charter. Egypt argues this
would give Israel a voice in the
treaty.
