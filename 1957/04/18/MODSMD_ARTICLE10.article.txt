# SU, Local Heads Oppose Freeway In Meet Today
## 
### 
Stanford officials will meet to
day with administrators of three
mid - Peninsula cities to oppose
the proposed Junipero Serra
Freeway route which is slated to
pass through Los Altos. The
meeting will be held at the office
of Alf Brandin, Stanford's busi
ness manager.
Los Altos City Clerk-Adminis
trator John M. R. Hope arranged
the "hush-hush" meeting, invit
ing the city manager of Menlo
Park and the city clerk of Ather
ton as well as the Stanford offi
cials. The press would not be
welcome, he said.
The State Division of High
ways has proposed two routes
for the freeway, one of which
would pass through the east and
one through the west of Los Al
tos. Los Altos' officials advocate
pushing the route farther west
so that it would go through Los
Altos Ilills.
