# Ike Pledges U.S. Support For Jordan if Attacked
## IN JORDAN Hussein Vows to Fight Enemies 'Until Death' 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan, April 17 (UP>—King Hussein, speaking to his
people for the first time since his victory over leftist forces, vowed
today to struggle "until I die" against the "real enemies" dividing
his Arab nation.
The 23-year-old monarch, in a policy statement, lashed out at the

"imperialists" and Israel. He
said Jordan "accepts the Arab
national policy which is not in
fluenced by any other govern
ment."
"I swear I will struggle for you
until I die and I will adopt the
way of liberated Arab countries,"
Hussein told his subjects.
"I am against those who are
the real enemies of our nation,
those who receive principles from
outside and have no loyalty to
our land," the king added.
Spirited Attack
Sources said the king's spirited
attack on imperialism did not ap
ply to the proposed Eisenhower
Doctrine mission to Jordan of
U.S. Presidential Envoy James P.
Richards.
(In Washington today, Presi
dent Eisenhower told a news con
ference the United States could
go to Jordan's assistance if it be
comes a victim of aggression by
Israel or by the Communists. He
said this could be done either
through the Eisenhower Doctrine
resolution or the Big Three reso
lution of 1950 aimed at any Mid
dle East aggression.)
Eisenhower Doctrine
The Eisenhower Doctrine was
a key issue in last week's Jordan
ian upheaval which followed the
king's ouster of leftist Premier
Suleiman Nabulsi. Nabulsi was
reported strongly opposed to
Richards' visit here to discuss
the doctrine.
Late today, U.S. Ambassador
Lester DeWitt Mallory called on
new moderate Premier Hossein
Khalidi and on Nabulsi, who was
taken into the new cabinet as
foreign minister in a compromise
move.
It was understood the confer
ence concerned the proposed visit
of Richards. A source close to
the royal palace said Richards is
likely to be invited to Jordan dur
ing his current Middle East tour.
