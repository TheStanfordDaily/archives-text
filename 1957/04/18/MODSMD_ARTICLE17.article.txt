# Will Intervene If Communists, Israel Attack
## Power to Intervene Given by Big Three Pact, Ike Doctrine 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 17 (UP)
—President Eisenhower said to
day the would go to
the aid of Jordan if the little Mid
est nation was attacked by Is
rael or by the Communists.
He said this nation could inter
vene under a 1950 Big Three
agreement in the event of an Is
raeli-Jordan dispute, or invoke
the Eisenhower Middle East;
"Doctrine" if Jordan was at
tacked by the Reds. The doctrine
authorizes use *of U.S. troops it
necessary.
Eisenhower also told his news
conference that the United States
may have to go before the United
Nations Security Council to re
port on Suez Canal negotiations
with Egypt. But he said, "We
have not completely given up
hope on those conversations."
News Conference
The Middle East developments
highlighted the news conference
at which the President, in a gen
erally jovial mood, laughed off
criticism by his older brother,
Edgar, and defended Postmaster-
General Arthur E. Summerfield's
mail service cuts.
Eisenhower, obviously geared
for the question, started smiling
as soon as a reporter opened the
meeting by asking about Edgar's
blast yesterday at the big Eisen
hower budget and "liberal" ad
ministration.
"Edgar has been criticizing me
since I was five years old," he
shot back without hesitation. He
was still smiling. There was no
further reference to Edgar, who
was an invited guest at a White
House stag dinner later.
Embarrassing Question
The President also sidestepped
the only other possibly embar
rassing question at the half-hour
news conference. Asked about a
statement by GOP Senator Wil
liam E. Jenner (Ind.) that he ex
pected Eisenhower support for
re-election, the chief executive
said the issue had been raised a
little early since the Indiana pri
mary had not yet been held.
The President was dead serious
in his discussion of the Jordan
situation, but gave no indication
that he thought any aggression
was imminent.
There have been reports that
Israel might attempt to reclaim
territory which Jordan seized
during the height of the Middle
East, troubles. Syria and Iraq
also have been said to have terri
torial ambitions, which might be
pushed during Jordan's present
internal troubles.

Eisenhower, obviously geared
for the question, started smiling
as soon as a reporter opened the
meeting by asking about Edgar's
blast yesterday at the big Eisen
hower budget and "liberal" ad

"Edgar has been criticizing me
since I was five years old," he
shot back without hesitation. He
was still smiling. There was no
further reference to Edgar, who
was an invited guest at a White
House stag dinner later.
Embarrassing Question
The President also sidestepped
the only other possibly embar

news conference. Asked about a
