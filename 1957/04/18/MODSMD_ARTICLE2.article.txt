## Aldous Huxley Ends Visit at Stanford After 3 Days of Informal Discussions 
### Dick Meister 
Aldous Huxley ended a three
flay visit to Stanford yesterday,
but not before he had graced the
campus with a good bit of his
complex yet simple philosophy.
Huxley, one of the greatest of
contemporary writers, spoke at a
series of informal question-and
answer sessions in the main li
brary early this week. He also
spoke-to a contemporary religion
class.
"We must apply the Golden
Rule to the inanimate world as
well as to that of the animate,"
Huxley said. "We have no right
to bully nature; we should collab
orate and understand it.
"We're all in the same boat
with rabbits and squirrels- we all
have to get on. Too many are
living as parasites; they aren't
giving anything to the world."
Huxley, who believes that an
intellectual's responsibility to so
ciety is "to do his work as well

as possible," practices his preach
ings.
He has published a dozen novels
(the first "Chrome Yellow," 1922;
the latest "The Genius and the
Goddess," 1955), although he con
siders himself more of an essayist
than a novelist. Huxley claimed
to have "trouble" with narrative
and plot.
"Besides," he said, "I have the
wrong shape for a novelist." He's
tall and slim. "One thinks of
novelists as being big and hefty
like Dumas and Tolstoy. Of course
there's Robert Louis Stevenson,
but then he had, he said, little
brownies to tell him those won
derful stories he wrote."
Huxley's other work is volumi
nous and includes many essays,
poems and short stories, two bio
graphical works, dramas, play
adaptations. He edited the letters
of his lifelong friend D. H. Law
rence and wrote the movie sce
narios for "Pride and Prejudice"
and "Jane Eyre."
He is almost blind, but consid
ers the onset of eye trouble as
"the most important single event"
iti his life. The trouble, he said,
"forced mf to live very largely on
my own inner resources."
Huxley's latest work is a play
based on his novel "After Many
a Summer," a satire on southern

California, where he has lived
since the late 1930'5.
His advice to young writers?
"Read a great deal. Imitate a bit.
Write constantly. Translate from
a foreign language.
"Go on writing and throwing
away, and writing and throwing
away; that's about all one can
do," he said.
As a very young man, he said
the main influences on him were
the great French writers as well
as the comedy of Charles Dickens.
He looks on art "as primarily
communication. It is to make
things more lucid over wider
areas. But the concern of some
of the modern novelists seems to
be to make things more obscure
in narrower areas."
Huxley said he began writing,
"as most do," to convey the idea
of his own experience of life. "I
had no special hobbyhorse to ride
at that time," he said.
His writing methods are sim
ple. He reads books and sees peo
ple. He writes — and revises —
about two pages a day, working
only in the morning.
"I'm curious about a great
many things — too curious," he
said. His interests do range wide
ly. He has done essays on paci
fism and is known for his works
on mysticism. Huxley has done
much work with mescalin and ly
sergic acid, drugs which induce
"the intensely rich vision ot the
world" which he said all great
artists have seen.
lie considers "Time Must I lave
a Stop," written in 1941, his best
novel.
Huxley, who wrote "Brave New
World" as a reaction to the "over
optimistic" view of man put forth
by H. G. Wells, doesn't believe in
automat ic progress.
"It's not enough to just im
prove technology," he said. "We
must attack our problems on all
fronts . . . seek out improved
morals, improved intellect, great
er happiness."
