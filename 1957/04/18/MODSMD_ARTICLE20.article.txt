# AWS Housing Problem
## 
### 
Last yk.au the women students of Stanford
voted to change the ratio of seniors to juniors
and sophomores who would be placed in the
various houses around campus. In so doing
they set up a conflict in the long-held ideology
that after freshman year il is preferable to
have a mixture of classes.
The new ratio, which made two-thirds of
each house open to seniors with the remaining
vacancies in the house open to juniors and
sophomores at a 2-to-l ratio, allowed every
senior woman to live in the house of her first,
second or third choice and most junior women
to be placed in one of their first choices.
This left Lagunita, the most, unpreferred
housing area, packed with sophomores.
The result was that the sophomore women
who live in Lagunita discovered that they like
an all-sophomore dorm. They like it because
it promotes class unity and better cooperation
and attitude in the dorm as a whole.
The women who live in Lagunita 4 this year
are ready to move on to new living areas. How
ever, the success of Lag as an all-sophomore
dorm has made it the most preferred dorm
among those w ho will be sophomores next year.

The number of freshman women wanting to
live in Lag next year is approached only by
those who have indicated Florence Moore as
their first choice. The number of sophomores
desiring the How is definitely losing ground.*
So, everyone is happy. Gloomy Lagunita has
found friends among the sophomore women of
this year and next year and probably years to
come. It is no longer a dreaded dorm, but
rather a living area where the freshmen from
Brainier and Roble get to know each other,
reaffirm old friendships, consolidate class spirit
and then become upperelasswomen.
There seems to be no problem—but there is.
The old ideology, cherished by some as a Stan
ford policy, of preferring the mixture of classes
in living areas is gone.
Solving the problem would involve another
ratio change, a change that would force junior
and senior women who do not want to live in
Lag to do so and keep the sophomores from
having their first choice.
On April 29 in house meetings there will be
a vote to see how many women prefer to
uphol'd the ideology and how many prefer to
make as many women as possible happy.

that after freshman year il is preferable to
have a mixture of classes.
The new ratio, which made two-thirds of
each house open to seniors with the remaining
vacancies in the house open to juniors and
sophomores at a 2-to-l ratio, allowed every
senior woman to live in the house of her first,
second or third choice and most junior women
to be placed in one of their first choices.
This left Lagunita, the most, unpreferred
housing area, packed with sophomores.
The result was that the sophomore women
who live in Lagunita discovered that they like
an all-sophomore dorm. They like it because
it promotes class unity and better cooperation
and attitude in the dorm as a whole.
The women who live in Lagunita 4 this year
are ready to move on to new living areas. How
ever, the success of Lag as an all-sophomore
dorm has made it the most preferred dorm
among those w ho will be sophomores next year.

The number of freshman women wanting to
live in Lag next year is approached only by
those who have indicated Florence Moore as
their first choice. The number of sophomores
desiring the How is definitely losing ground.*
So, everyone is happy. Gloomy Lagunita has
found friends among the sophomore women of
this year and next year and probably years to
come. It is no longer a dreaded dorm, but
rather a living area where the freshmen from
Brainier and Roble get to know each other,
reaffirm old friendships, consolidate class spirit
and then become upperelasswomen.
There seems to be no problem—but there is.
The old ideology, cherished by some as a Stan
ford policy, of preferring the mixture of classes
in living areas is gone.
Solving the problem would involve another
ratio change, a change that would force junior
and senior women who do not want to live in
Lag to do so and keep the sophomores from
having their first choice.
On April 29 in house meetings there will be
a vote to see how many women prefer to
uphol'd the ideology and how many prefer to
make as many women as possible happy.
Last yk.au the women students of Stanford
voted to change the ratio of seniors to juniors
and sophomores who would be placed in the
various houses around campus. In so doing
they set up a conflict in the long-held ideology
that after freshman year il is preferable to
have a mixture of classes.
