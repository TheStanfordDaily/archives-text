Best MUN Attended
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the Seventh Session Model
United Nations Secretariat I would like to take
this opportunity to thank the Stanford student
body for participating in what I consider to be
a very worthwhile activity. The French delega
tion, which had had more experience with MUN's
than any other of our guests, commented that
this was the best MUN they had attended in
the last four years.
Acknowledgment and congratulations should
go to the crews who pre-planned the eating, hous
ing and transportation for the delegates, the
groups that made the direction signs, posters
and banners, those who arranged the library
and atomic reactor displays and tho students
who kept the accounts straight and supplies
available. Those of you who registered the dele
gates, provided them with information through
out the four days and extended your hospitality
at the tea, dance and banquet made our guests
feel more than welcome.
One delegate said ho could not even motion to
one of his delegation in tho General Assembly
without having a messenger or security guard at
his shoulder ready to deliver a message. This
lype of performance was seen throughout the
meetings. A thank you is definitely in order for
the DPI secretaries and press room crew who
took notes in committee and had them ready for
news releases each noon and night, and to the
procedural officers and their staff who guided
ihe debate in committees and councils. Perhaps
the backbone of this conference were the crews
who moved the chairs, tables and supplies from
room to room, and the duplications staff who
were finally able to reproduce 600 copies of an
amendment or resolution in 15 minutes.

Keio Not Imperial
Editor, The Daily:
I hope some people who know that Japan is no
more an imperial nation might have doubted
about the comment on Keio University, which
appeared in The Stanford Daily April 16. We
have no universities called imperial after the
war. Besides, Keio is a private school, and we
all members of Keio school are proud of her be
ing private. The reason why Stanford is exchang
ing students with Keio lies also in this point.
Keio traces its origin to the little school that
Yukichi Fukuzawa, the founder, opened in Tokyo
in 1858, which makes it the oldest institution of
education in Japan. No other private school of
old Japan had permanency, because it dissolved
when its master died, and none of the govern
ment schools was able to survive the upheaval of
ihe Restoration. In 1868, the year of the Meiji
Restoration which ended feudalism in Japan, the
school was named Keio-gijuku according to the
name of the era.
By the time Commodore Perry came 1o urge
the Japanese government lo open Ihe country,
Fukuzawa was old enough to see Hie significance
of the event. He brought back first-hand know!
edge of the Western civilization from America
and Europe.
In 1890, Harvard University sent three profes
sors and with their co-operation the first private
university in Japan was opened. The liberal
ideals of Fukuzawa kept himself from becoming
the dictator of the institution, and when he died
in 1901, the school was able to continue its
growth under the direction of his able followers
proving in practice the liberalism and corporate
system which he had taught. One Stanford stu
dent who read the Autobiography of Fukuzawa
and was impressed by the spirt of Fukuzawa
started correspondence with the students of Keio
University five years ago.
