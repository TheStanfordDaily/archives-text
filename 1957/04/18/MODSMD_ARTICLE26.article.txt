## 
### 
Barring competition from the
weather man, the Stanford frosh
tracksters will meet a team of
prep all-stars from the Peninsula
Athletic League today at 3:30
p.m. on Angell Field.
The program will be changed
slightly because of the differences
in collegiate and prep events. The
two-mile and the javelin will be
dropped, while the low hurdles
race will be shortened from 220
to ISO yards. In addition, high
hurdles will run over 39-ineh hur
dles in place of the customary 42-
inch barriers.
On the whole, the high schoolers
should furnish nothing more than
a good workout for the frosh.
Only in the high jump, where the
Papooses are woefully weak, may
the preps score heavily.
The best race will probably be
the 440, with Stanford's Chuck
McKenney and Bob Besse battling
a pair of 50.0 high schoolers. The
mile could also be fairly close,
with the all-stars boasting a duo
of sub-J:3O runners. Stanford will
counter with Hob Monzingo.
