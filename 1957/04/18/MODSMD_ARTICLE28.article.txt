Exclamations of amazement are still being heard about the way
in which Payton Jordan and his crew of assistants and officials con
ducted last Saturday's Stanford-Southern California track meet. The
consensus was that Stanford had never seen as well-staged a meet,
and the hope was that the trend would continue. Significantly
enough, almost everyone who was at the meet said'he would be on
hand early for the April 27 meet with Occidental.
Jordan said that Ed Pierce, the public address announcer who
did such an excellent job of keeping the spectators informed, will
• again be brought up from Los Angeles? for tin* Occidental meet.
Jordan added that several suggestions have been made to him
which will serve to keep fans even better informed. Principal
among these is the idea that distance markers in the shot put, broad
jump, javelin and discus be painted contrasting colors for each team,
instead of all the markers being red. If no hitches develop in the
plans, this change will be made for the Oxy meet, in addition to all
the new features which were introduced against the Trojans.
Before the Indians can worry about Occidental, however, they
will have to think about Saturday's fight with UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Bruins are defending PCC and NCAA champs, and are strong
again this year. UCLA can be beaten, however, as Occidental demon
strated in convincing fashion last weekend by walking on with a
74 decision.
Ducky Drake's Bruins claim they never would have lost had not
Russ Ellis fallen in the 440 after a collision with Pat Logan of Oxy
and wound up with no points instead of the five he was almost sure
to get.
As far as the Stanford meet is concerned, track events may
bear close resemblance to those in the Indian-USC meet. Bob Sea
man lias run far faster than any miler the Indians have, and could
go for a double in the half-mile if he isn't pressed in the four
lapper.
UCLA isn't as deep in the long races as was USC, so there is
virtually no chance that Stanford could get shut out 27-0 in Ihe
distance events as they were against Troy.
In the sprints, UCLA is about as weak us Southern Cal. Rafer
Johnson and I)ave James, the two best Bruin dashmen, are both on
the casualty list and aren't expected to be at full effectiveness
against the Indians, if they even run at all.
As it looks now, the expected 440 duel between the Tribe's Don
Chesarek and UCLA's Russ Ellis won't be coming off. Jordan wants
Chesarek to prove to himself that he can turn a fast SBO, and so
plans to limit his sophomore ace to just the one race, plus, of course,
anchor duty in the mile relay.
Stanford's shot and discus men will have their first experience
of the year in performing on a concrete ring. This Westwood inno
vation is only one of many experiments in recent years designed to
improve field event performances. Time was when all field events
except the javelin were contested on dirt surfaces. Now competitors
compete on a variety of things, including dirt, asphalt, concrete and
grass.
UCLA was by far Ihe most recent of the three PCC Southern
Division opponents to begin appearing on Stanford's regular track
schedule. The two schools have met only since 1934. The Tribe's
series with USC dates back.to 1908, while the Indians' have been
meeting Cal ever since 1893.
Of the 20 meetings between the Bruins and Cards, 13 of the deci
sions have gone to Stanford, the remaining seven to UCLA. The
Tribe started fast, winning their first eight encounters with the
Bruins. Since World War 11, UCLA has won six meets to five for
Stanford.
The last time the Tribe won was in 1954, when it squeaked out a
67 1 /L>-63M> victory. In 1955, UCLA won the meet, 69-62, as they took
the closing relay event. In that race, Ellis, then a sophomore, came
around the final turn to nip the Indians' Walt Garrett at the wire.
Despite its relatively short existence, the Indian-Bruin series
has developed a good list of meet records. Some of them are good
enough to be completely beyond the reach of this year's teams,
while others will be in definite danger.
Three Stanford field event men stand good chances of cracking
meet standards —discus thrower Fred Peters, javelin man Hank Rol
dan and high jumper Phil Fehlen. Peters and Fehlen have bettered
the meet marks of lee-lO 1 and 6-5%, While Roldan is only a short
distance behind the javelin standard of 225-7V2. If Frank Herrmann
continues his excellent improvement in the broad jump, he could
threaten the record of 25-4%.

the meet marks of lee-lO 1 and 6-5%, While Roldan is only a short
distance behind the javelin standard of 225-7V2. If Frank Herrmann
continues his excellent improvement in the broad jump, he could

Exclamations of amazement are still being heard about the way
in which Payton Jordan and his crew of assistants and officials con
ducted last Saturday's Stanford-Southern California track meet. The
consensus was that Stanford had never seen as well-staged a meet,
and the hope was that the trend would continue. Significantly
enough, almost everyone who was at the meet said'he would be on
hand early for the April 27 meet with Occidental.
Jordan said that Ed Pierce, the public address announcer who
did such an excellent job of keeping the spectators informed, will
• again be brought up from Los Angeles? for tin* Occidental meet.
Jordan added that several suggestions have been made to him
which will serve to keep fans even better informed. Principal
among these is the idea that distance markers in the shot put, broad
jump, javelin and discus be painted contrasting colors for each team,
instead of all the markers being red. If no hitches develop in the
plans, this change will be made for the Oxy meet, in addition to all
the new features which were introduced against the Trojans.
Before the Indians can worry about Occidental, however, they
will have to think about Saturday's fight with UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Bruins are defending PCC and NCAA champs, and are strong
again this year. UCLA can be beaten, however, as Occidental demon
strated in convincing fashion last weekend by walking on with a
74 decision.
Ducky Drake's Bruins claim they never would have lost had not
Russ Ellis fallen in the 440 after a collision with Pat Logan of Oxy
and wound up with no points instead of the five he was almost sure
to get.
As far as the Stanford meet is concerned, track events may
bear close resemblance to those in the Indian-USC meet. Bob Sea
man lias run far faster than any miler the Indians have, and could
go for a double in the half-mile if he isn't pressed in the four
lapper.
UCLA isn't as deep in the long races as was USC, so there is
virtually no chance that Stanford could get shut out 27-0 in Ihe
distance events as they were against Troy.
In the sprints, UCLA is about as weak us Southern Cal. Rafer
Johnson and I)ave James, the two best Bruin dashmen, are both on
the casualty list and aren't expected to be at full effectiveness
against the Indians, if they even run at all.
As it looks now, the expected 440 duel between the Tribe's Don
Chesarek and UCLA's Russ Ellis won't be coming off. Jordan wants
Chesarek to prove to himself that he can turn a fast SBO, and so
plans to limit his sophomore ace to just the one race, plus, of course,
anchor duty in the mile relay.
Stanford's shot and discus men will have their first experience
of the year in performing on a concrete ring. This Westwood inno
vation is only one of many experiments in recent years designed to
improve field event performances. Time was when all field events
except the javelin were contested on dirt surfaces. Now competitors
compete on a variety of things, including dirt, asphalt, concrete and
grass.
UCLA was by far Ihe most recent of the three PCC Southern
Division opponents to begin appearing on Stanford's regular track
schedule. The two schools have met only since 1934. The Tribe's
series with USC dates back.to 1908, while the Indians' have been
meeting Cal ever since 1893.
Of the 20 meetings between the Bruins and Cards, 13 of the deci
sions have gone to Stanford, the remaining seven to UCLA. The
Tribe started fast, winning their first eight encounters with the
Bruins. Since World War 11, UCLA has won six meets to five for
Stanford.
The last time the Tribe won was in 1954, when it squeaked out a
67 1 /L>-63M> victory. In 1955, UCLA won the meet, 69-62, as they took
the closing relay event. In that race, Ellis, then a sophomore, came
around the final turn to nip the Indians' Walt Garrett at the wire.
Despite its relatively short existence, the Indian-Bruin series
has developed a good list of meet records. Some of them are good
enough to be completely beyond the reach of this year's teams,
while others will be in definite danger.
Three Stanford field event men stand good chances of cracking
meet standards —discus thrower Fred Peters, javelin man Hank Rol

has developed a good list of meet records. Some of them are good
enough to be completely beyond the reach of this year's teams,
while others will be in definite danger.
Three Stanford field event men stand good chances of cracking
meet standards —discus thrower Fred Peters, javelin man Hank Rol
dan and high jumper Phil Fehlen. Peters and Fehlen have bettered
the meet marks of lee-lO 1 and 6-5%, While Roldan is only a short
distance behind the javelin standard of 225-7V2. If Frank Herrmann
continues his excellent improvement in the broad jump, he could
threaten the record of 25-4%.

Exclamations of amazement are still being heard about the way
in which Payton Jordan and his crew of assistants and officials con
ducted last Saturday's Stanford-Southern California track meet. The
consensus was that Stanford had never seen as well-staged a meet,
and the hope was that the trend would continue. Significantly
enough, almost everyone who was at the meet said'he would be on
hand early for the April 27 meet with Occidental.
Jordan said that Ed Pierce, the public address announcer who
did such an excellent job of keeping the spectators informed, will
• again be brought up from Los Angeles? for tin* Occidental meet.
Jordan added that several suggestions have been made to him
which will serve to keep fans even better informed. Principal
among these is the idea that distance markers in the shot put, broad
jump, javelin and discus be painted contrasting colors for each team,
instead of all the markers being red. If no hitches develop in the
plans, this change will be made for the Oxy meet, in addition to all
the new features which were introduced against the Trojans.
Before the Indians can worry about Occidental, however, they
will have to think about Saturday's fight with UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Bruins are defending PCC and NCAA champs, and are strong
again this year. UCLA can be beaten, however, as Occidental demon
strated in convincing fashion last weekend by walking on with a
74 decision.
Ducky Drake's Bruins claim they never would have lost had not
Russ Ellis fallen in the 440 after a collision with Pat Logan of Oxy
and wound up with no points instead of the five he was almost sure
to get.
As far as the Stanford meet is concerned, track events may
bear close resemblance to those in the Indian-USC meet. Bob Sea
man lias run far faster than any miler the Indians have, and could
go for a double in the half-mile if he isn't pressed in the four
lapper.
UCLA isn't as deep in the long races as was USC, so there is
virtually no chance that Stanford could get shut out 27-0 in Ihe
distance events as they were against Troy.
In the sprints, UCLA is about as weak us Southern Cal. Rafer
Johnson and I)ave James, the two best Bruin dashmen, are both on
the casualty list and aren't expected to be at full effectiveness
against the Indians, if they even run at all.
As it looks now, the expected 440 duel between the Tribe's Don
Chesarek and UCLA's Russ Ellis won't be coming off. Jordan wants
Chesarek to prove to himself that he can turn a fast SBO, and so
plans to limit his sophomore ace to just the one race, plus, of course,
anchor duty in the mile relay.
Stanford's shot and discus men will have their first experience
of the year in performing on a concrete ring. This Westwood inno
vation is only one of many experiments in recent years designed to
improve field event performances. Time was when all field events
except the javelin were contested on dirt surfaces. Now competitors
compete on a variety of things, including dirt, asphalt, concrete and
grass.
UCLA was by far Ihe most recent of the three PCC Southern
Division opponents to begin appearing on Stanford's regular track
schedule. The two schools have met only since 1934. The Tribe's
series with USC dates back.to 1908, while the Indians' have been
meeting Cal ever since 1893.
Of the 20 meetings between the Bruins and Cards, 13 of the deci
sions have gone to Stanford, the remaining seven to UCLA. The
Tribe started fast, winning their first eight encounters with the
Bruins. Since World War 11, UCLA has won six meets to five for
Stanford.
The last time the Tribe won was in 1954, when it squeaked out a
67 1 /L>-63M> victory. In 1955, UCLA won the meet, 69-62, as they took
the closing relay event. In that race, Ellis, then a sophomore, came
around the final turn to nip the Indians' Walt Garrett at the wire.
