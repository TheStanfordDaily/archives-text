# Indians to Host Bruin, Trojan Racket Squads
## 
### Dave Canfield 
The first-, second- and third
place teams in the 1956 NCAA
tennis tournament will battle it
out at Stanford tomorrow and
Saturday in a pair of dual battles.
At 1 p.m. tomorrow UCLA, the
1956 NCAA champions, will en
gage Stanford, which placed third
in last year's nationals. USC, sec
ond nationally, arrives Saturday
for a 1 p.m. clash with the under
dog Indians. All matches will be
on the varsity courts.
The Card netmen will be out
for- revenge. Two weeks ago in
Los Angeles coach Bob Renker's
racketeers lost to the Trojans,
8-1, and the Bruins, 9-0, on suc
cessive days.
UCLA, use: Stars
Precipitating those routs were
such stars as 1956 NCAA singles
champ Alex Olmedo, 1957 Pebble
Beach finalist Ed Atkinson and
Mexican Davis Cup player Yves
LeMaitre, all of USC, and UCLA's
U.S. Davis Cuppers Mike Franks
and Mike Green, ex-national boys'
champion John Lesch and ex-na
tional boys' doubles titleholder
John Cranston.
Besides their king-pins, both
Southern squads have depth, and
it is in this respect that they rule
as prohibitive favorites over Stan
ford. The Indians have aces of
their own in singles players Jack
Douglas and Brooks Rawlins and
doubles teams Dave Nelson and
Douglas and Gil White and Raw
lins.
But Douglas, despite his over
whelming win in this year's Nor
thern California Intercollegiates,
must rank as a serious underdog,
both In his matches against SC
No. 1 man Olmedo and UCLA
No. 1 man Franks.
Upset Unlikely
Rawlins, too/ is conceded little
chance of upsetting either the
Trojans' Atkinson or the Bruins'
Green in second singles. Rawlins
was runner-up to Douglas in this
year's Northern California Inter
collegiates, which Stanford won.
Perhaps the Indians' only out
side hope of scoring an upset lies
in doubles. With Norcal winners
Rawlins-White, runners-up Doug
las-Nelson and third team Lowell
Carruth and Bob Bow d en all
strong, the Cards could topple
USC, which is comparatively weak
in the tandem matches.
The Trojans lost all three dou
bles matches last Saturday in fall
ing to UCLA, 6-3. Against Stan
ford last Monday, Troy's only loss
came in second doubles, where
Douglas - Nelson bested Gordon
Davis and Greg Grant.

Precipitating those routs were
such stars as 1956 NCAA singles
champ Alex Olmedo, 1957 Pebble
Beach finalist Ed Atkinson and
Mexican Davis Cup player Yves
LeMaitre, all of USC, and UCLA's
U.S. Davis Cuppers Mike Franks
and Mike Green, ex-national boys'
champion John Lesch and ex-na
tional boys' doubles titleholder
John Cranston.
Besides their king-pins, both
Southern squads have depth, and
it is in this respect that they rule
as prohibitive favorites over Stan
ford. The Indians have aces of
their own in singles players Jack
Douglas and Brooks Rawlins and
doubles teams Dave Nelson and
Douglas and Gil White and Raw
lins.
But Douglas, despite his over
whelming win in this year's Nor
thern California Intercollegiates,
must rank as a serious underdog,
both In his matches against SC
No. 1 man Olmedo and UCLA
No. 1 man Franks.
Upset Unlikely
Rawlins, too/ is conceded little
chance of upsetting either the
Trojans' Atkinson or the Bruins'
Green in second singles. Rawlins
was runner-up to Douglas in this
year's Northern California Inter
collegiates, which Stanford won.
Perhaps the Indians' only out
side hope of scoring an upset lies
in doubles. With Norcal winners
Rawlins-White, runners-up Doug
las-Nelson and third team Lowell
Carruth and Bob Bow d en all
strong, the Cards could topple
USC, which is comparatively weak
in the tandem matches.
The Trojans lost all three dou
bles matches last Saturday in fall
ing to UCLA, 6-3. Against Stan
ford last Monday, Troy's only loss
came in second doubles, where
Douglas - Nelson bested Gordon
Davis and Greg Grant.
The first-, second- and third
place teams in the 1956 NCAA
tennis tournament will battle it
out at Stanford tomorrow and
Saturday in a pair of dual battles.
At 1 p.m. tomorrow UCLA, the
1956 NCAA champions, will en
gage Stanford, which placed third
in last year's nationals. USC, sec
ond nationally, arrives Saturday
for a 1 p.m. clash with the under
dog Indians. All matches will be
on the varsity courts.
The Card netmen will be out
for- revenge. Two weeks ago in
Los Angeles coach Bob Renker's
racketeers lost to the Trojans,
8-1, and the Bruins, 9-0, on suc
cessive days.
