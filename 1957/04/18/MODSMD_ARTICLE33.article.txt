### Bob Payne 
Veteran right-hander Walt
Payne seeks his second victory of
the season over Santa Clara when
Stanford returns to CIBA action
against the Broncos this after
noon at 3:15 on the Sunken Dia- j

5-3, in a five-hitter two weeks ago.,
His conference mark currently:
stands at one win and two losses, i
Zip Keitges, a right hander who
pitched the Broncos to a 4-3 vie-!
Tory in the second game of that
series, is expected to oppose
Payne. Keitges was touched for
nine hits, but was tough in the
clutch and allowed only two runs.
Stewart Doubtful
Veteran card shortstop Steve'
Stewart is again on the doubtful
list with his leg injury. He may
be replaced in the starting lineup
this afternoon by sophomore
Wayne Marion.
Ralph Holding, all - conference
catcher last season, appears to
have regained his batting eye and
is giving the hitting attack a
boost. Holding had a double and
two singles against Southern Cal
ifornia last Saturday and picked
up two more singles in Tuesday's
win over San Diego State. Behind
Holding is sophomore Art Von
Wronski, one of the club's top
run-producers.
Shaw Hitting .520
Tribe second baseman A 1 Shaw
has continued to hit the ball at a
lusty pace and has moved into
the loop's second spot in hitting,
with a .520 mark. Stewart is also
among the leaders, boasting a .389
average.
Santa Clara's hitting attack is
led by left fielder Jim O'Rourke,
who banged out five hits, includ
ing two doubles and a triple, in
the first Stanford series. Monday
O'Rourke had four hits, one a
home run, in a wild victory over
San Diego.
