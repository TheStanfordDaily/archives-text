# U.S. Accepts Plan Proposed by Russ For Disarmament

LONDON, April 17 (UP) The
United States today a ec e p t e d
Russia's offer for a partial "open
skies" disarmament plan in Eu
rope on condition that Ihe Rus
sians widen the area to be in
spected.
Russia rejected President Ei
senhower's full "open skies" plan
in «1955 and last November pro
posed that international safety
patrols fly over a partial zone
stretching 500 miles on each side
of the Iron Curtain.
U.S. Delegate Harold E. Stas
sen told the five - power United
Nations Disarmament Confer
ence today that it would be ac
ceptable on condition that the
zone was widened beyond the 500-
mile range, which barely reaches
Russia, and that the Russians
agree that this first open zone
merely would be a beginning area
which must be expanded progres
sively.
Eisenhower's first proposal at
the 1955 Geneva summit confer
ence called for both the United
States and Russia to open all
their air space to the other's ob
servation planes. It was intended
b) be a safeguard against any
surprise attack while disarma
ment was in progress.
Since then, the United States
decided to press for "first step"
disarmament — smaller moves
which are possible in present cir
cumstances. Stassen's proposal
today was the latest along that
line.
The five nations taking part in
the talks are the United States,
Britain, France, Canada and Rus
sia.
