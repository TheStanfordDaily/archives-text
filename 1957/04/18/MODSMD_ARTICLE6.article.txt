# AWS Housing Rule Vote Set For April 29
## Proposal to Make Lag All-Soph Dorm Will Be Considered 
### 
A proposal to make Lagunita
an all-sophomore women's dorm
will head the discussion schedule
Monday night at women's house
meetings. A vote on the plans
will be taken April 29.
This suggestion was presented
at AWS Board meeting last Mon
day. Other proposals were as fol
lows :
• Change the ratio from two
thirds of each house seniors with
remaining vacancies in a house
going to juniors and sophomores
at a 2:1 ratio, as at present, to a
ratio of 3:2:1 or 2:1:1 ratio of
seniors to juniors to sophomores.
• Let the system run as is to
watch developments.
AWS Housing Committee dis
cussion brought out that there
would be no mixture of classes if
Lagunita were made an all-soph
omore dorm. Sponsor choosing
would be limited as upper divi
sion women would not know
sophomores, and women other
than sophomores who want sin
gle rooms would have to live in
Moore or Union.
Lagunita Excom discussion fa
vored making Lagunita an all
sophomore dorm. Results of their
talks stated that the spirit of La
gunita is greater in all sopho
more casas than in those with
mixed classes. Freshman and
sophomore dorms are not com
parable, according to the Excom
report. Sophomores have to do
for themselves what the fresh
man sponsors did during the pre
vious year. The small number of
upperclassmen in Lagunita pre
sent a problem for activities
which are geared to sophomores.
Housing Committee members
favoring the proposal have sug
gested that the sponsor problem
be solved by having a representa
tive from Lagunita who is not
trying out for sponsoring on the
S p on so r Choosing Committee.
This would give Lag women an
equal opportunity to be sponsors.
