# Big 1906 Rock Cost Stanford $2 Million Roll

Many chemistry students learn
ed that it was only April Fool's
Day when The Daily reported the
Chemistry Building damaged by
earthquake recently.
But 51 years ago today—April
18, 1906- such a report was no
joke. The Chemistry Building,
then six years old, lost part of its
ornate facade in the greatest
earthquake ever known to man
in California.
That edifice received only minor
damage compared to other por
tions of the University. In 47 sec
onds, beginning at 5:13 a.m., $2
million damage was done to the
Stanford campus. Miraculously,
only two lives were lost.
Two Killed
Killed were an Encina student
caught under a toppling chimney
and a University electrician who
ran back into the powerhouse to
shut off the electricity, only to be
buried in tons of bricks as the
smokestack snapped off like a
whip.
Memorial Church lost its 80-
foot Romanesque clock tower,
Memorial Arch became a pile of
rubble and the nearly completed
gymnasium and library were jig
gled beyond repair.
Predicts
The temblor was not without its
amusing incidents. Dr. David
Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, had predicted that an
other hard quake would come
about 11 that morning. A Chinese
cook queried, "Why he no telly us
about the first one?"
One Encina man sat patiently
through the jarring and rocking,
but when a water tank burst,
flooding his room, he yelled, "Ti
dal wave!" and ran.
Classes were suspended for Ihe
rest of the semester. The Univer
sity lost no time in getting back
on its feel. Tt reopened on Aug.
23 on schedule—and on Sept. 15
the members of the class of 1006
received thrir diplomas at a
slightly belated graduation cere
mony.
