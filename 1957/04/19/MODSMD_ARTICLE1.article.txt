# Consul Tells New British Budget Plan
## IIR Speaker Defends Cut; Says Britain Not Scrapping Its Defense 
### Dave Canfield 
Sir Robert Hadow, British con
sul general, yesterday told an au
dience of about 70 that his coun
try is not "scrapping" its defense
or "going down on its knees" to
Russia.
In an Institute of International
Relations Consul Talk in Bowman
Alumni House, Sir Robert said
Britain's recent cutback in de
fense spending was necessitated
by a budget which was "more
than we could afford."
He said Russia can "see victory
on the horizon without the appall
ing cost of nuclear warfare." The
U.S.S.R., Hadow commented, is
hoping for the "economic ruina
tion" of the free world.
British Economy
Hadow pointed out the follow
ing strengths in the British econ
omy:
• In 1956 fixed investment rose
by 8 per cent, the highest rise in
British history. "Private enter
prise has done that," Hadow said.
• The shortage of industrial
capital is being alleviated by the
$1 billion which British people
saved last year.
• Exports and gold reserves
also increased.
• Unlike 1955, the 1956 fiscal
year was marked by a surplus—
of $588 million. The consul gen
eral said this surplus came "in
spite of Suez."
AdmFts Weaknesses
Along with the strengths are
weaknesses, the speaker admitted.
He said "the cost of labor has
gone up faster than the additional
production resulting from labor."
Even with high labor wages,
Hadow said the total 1956 govern
mental budget of $14Vz billion
represented more than the British
taxpayer could afford. Taxes in
Britain are higher than in the
United States, ho said.
He also commented that the
British resent being forced to pay
back their war debts, in view of
the fact that during World War II
"we stopped Germany for two
years." "You can't expect our
people to swallow that with any
thing except a sad smile," Hadow
said.
