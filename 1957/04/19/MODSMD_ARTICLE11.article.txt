# Reds Show Willingness To Discuss 'Open Skies'
## 
### 
LONDON, April 18 (UP)—Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Va
lerian Zorin indicated today Russia might be willing to meet the
United States part way in negotiating a new "open skies" plan to
prevent surprise attack.
Harold E. Stassen, U.S. delegate to the five-power United Na
tions disarmament conference here, yesterday proposed a partial
"open skies" plan instead of the full measure proposed in 1955 by
President Eisenhower. He hinged agreement to any new "first
step" plan to the amount of territory Russia was willing to open
to international observation planes.
Eisenhower's original plan called for the United States and
Russia to open all territory to aerial observation by the other.
Questioned at a news conference today about Stassen's latest
proposal, Zorin declared, "The zones of control must be settled by
negotiation."
He went into further detail in a speech to the London Foreign
Association.
"I would like in particular to stress that, meeting the desires
of the U.S. government, the Soviet government has considered it
possible to agree to the carrying out of aerial photography in that
zone of Europe where are stationed the main armed forces of the
member states of NATO and of the member states of the | pro-
Soviet J Warsaw Pact."
