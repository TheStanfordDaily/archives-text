### 
WASHINGTON, April 18 (UP)
—The Senate Rackets Committee
called on the Justice Department
today to consider perjury prose
cution of Teamster Union wit
nesses who testified on labor vio
lence in Scranton, Pa.
It also asked the Department to
find out why a federal grand jury
failed to indict a contractor for
offering bribes which the jurors
decided two union officials had
accepted.
The action came as the commit
tee recessed hearings at which it
heard testimony of dynamiting,
"stink bomb" throwing, extortion
and other forms of "goon squad"
violence that surged over the
Scranton area.
Conflicting testimony prompted
committee chairman John L. Mc-
Clellan (D-Ark.) to comment that
"it is pretty obvious someone has
committed perjury." He asked
the Justice Department to study
the transcript with an eye to pos
sible prosecutions.
The committee asked the de
partment to look into the grand
jury's failure to indict the con
tractor for allegedly offering the
bribes. McClellan said "the man
who paid the money is just as
guilty as the man who received
it."
