# Stanford Scientists to Aid 'Smoke-Puff Experiment; Dr. Villard, Rich on Staff
## Rocket to Release Chemical Gas Into Air 70 Miles Above Desert 
### 
Scientists will shoot a rocket 70 miles above the New Mexico
desert next July to form an artificial cloud in an experiment aimed
at increasing the number of channels for longdistance radio com
munication.
Dubbed "Operation Smoke-Puff," the project will be a joint effort

involving scientists of Stanford's
Radio Propagation Laboratory,
radio amateurs throughout the
Southwest and northern Mexico,
and the Air Force.
The rocket will be fired from
Holloman Air Development Cen
ter, near Alamogordo, N.M., and
when it reaches a height of 70
miles it will release a cloud of
chemical gas. This gas, scientists
said, will become ionized, or elec
trically active, and form an arti
ficial ceiling in the upper atmos
phere.
Bouncing Signals
When the gas is released, pre
viously-alerted radio amateurs
within a 700-mile radius of the
launching site will attempt to con
tact each other by "bouncing"
short-wave radio signals off the
man-made cloud.
At the same time, Stanford sci
entists manning radar equipment
inside the test area will chart the
shape and movement of the cloud.
According to Stanford scientists,
the rocket techniques could be the
answer to the present shortage of
channels for long-distance com
munication.
They explained that long - dis
tance radio has always depended
upon the limited reflective power
of the upper atmosphere. Artifi
cial ionization might prove more
powerful than natural ceilings
and will be capable of reflecting
a wider range of radio frequen
cies, scientists commented.
Analyzed Here
All observations will be coordi
nated and analyzed at Stanford.
Results will be reported to a di
rectorate group under Dr. Murray
Zelikoff. Dr. O. G. Villard and
Richard S. Rich, a graduate stu
dent, will be responsible for co
ordinating, collecting and analyz
ing the information at Stanford.
The idea originated at the geo
physics research directorate of
the Air Force Cambridge Re
search Center, at Bedford, Mass.
Plans for the joint test were
worked out in cooperation with
Stanford and are described by
professor Villard in the May issue
of QST, official journal of the
Ameriacn Radio Relay League.

ter, near Alamogordo, N.M., and
when it reaches a height of 70
miles it will release a cloud of
chemical gas. This gas, scientists
said, will become ionized, or elec
trically active, and form an arti
ficial ceiling in the upper atmos
phere.
Bouncing Signals
When the gas is released, pre
viously-alerted radio amateurs
within a 700-mile radius of the
launching site will attempt to con
tact each other by "bouncing"
short-wave radio signals off the
man-made cloud.
At the same time, Stanford sci
entists manning radar equipment
inside the test area will chart the
shape and movement of the cloud.
According to Stanford scientists,
the rocket techniques could be the
answer to the present shortage of
channels for long-distance com
munication.
They explained that long - dis
tance radio has always depended
upon the limited reflective power
of the upper atmosphere. Artifi
cial ionization might prove more
powerful than natural ceilings
and will be capable of reflecting
a wider range of radio frequen
cies, scientists commented.
Analyzed Here
All observations will be coordi
nated and analyzed at Stanford.
Results will be reported to a di
rectorate group under Dr. Murray
Zelikoff. Dr. O. G. Villard and
Richard S. Rich, a graduate stu
dent, will be responsible for co
ordinating, collecting and analyz
ing the information at Stanford.
The idea originated at the geo
physics research directorate of
the Air Force Cambridge Re
search Center, at Bedford, Mass.
Plans for the joint test were
worked out in cooperation with
Stanford and are described by
professor Villard in the May issue
of QST, official journal of the
Ameriacn Radio Relay League.
Scientists will shoot a rocket 70 miles above the New Mexico
desert next July to form an artificial cloud in an experiment aimed
at increasing the number of channels for longdistance radio com
munication.
Dubbed "Operation Smoke-Puff," the project will be a joint effort

involving scientists of Stanford's
Radio Propagation Laboratory,
radio amateurs throughout the
Southwest and northern Mexico,
and the Air Force.
The rocket will be fired from
Holloman Air Development Cen
ter, near Alamogordo, N.M., and
when it reaches a height of 70
miles it will release a cloud of
chemical gas. This gas, scientists
said, will become ionized, or elec
trically active, and form an arti
ficial ceiling in the upper atmos
phere.
