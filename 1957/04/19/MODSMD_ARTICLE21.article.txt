# Ike Okays New Budget Slash; Tax Cut Seen
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 18 (UP)
President Eisenhower gave
Congress a go - ahead today to
slash $1,342,000,000 from his now
appropriations requests. Speaker
Sam Rayburn promptly predicted
that Congress would vote to cut
taxes Jan. 1.
The President warned, how
ever, that his proposal probably
would result in an actual cut of
only about $650,000,000 in next
year's record peacetime budget
of $71,800,000,000 since some of
the money involved was not
scheduled to be spent until fu
ture years.
But Rayburn forecast that Con
gress would press ahead with tax
cuts anyway, either late this ses
sion or early next year. He gave
no further details.
Eisenhower made quite clear
that he opposes tax reductions
now although he gave no indica
tion whether he would veto a tax
cut bill. He did say he still hoped
for "a reasonable tax cut for ev
ery taxpayer" eventually.
He also warned that some of
the cutbacks he proposed would
"have to be restored later" which
means they would not be a net
savings over the long haul. And
he described as illusory some of
the budget cuts already ordered
by the House.
Eisenhower said the economy
minded House members appar
ently were thinking in terms of a
"multi-billion-dollar" saving. He
ruled this out on grounds that it
could be accomplished "only at
the expense of the national safe
ty" which accounts for 63 per
cent of next year's budget.
"X most solemnly advise the
House that in these times a cut
of any appreciable magnitude in
current expenditures for national
security would endanger our
country and the peace of the
world," he said.
