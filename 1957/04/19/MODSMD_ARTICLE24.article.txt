# Integrity or Survival?

I,AST WEFK the New Yorker magazine printed
a cartoon showing a massive collection of arma
ments iu a vast cave with a Russian official
saying, '"Well, ire*re ready for open-sky in
spect ion."
The cartoonist's barb is humorous, until its
implications are considered. In 195!) President
Kisenhower presented ;in international full
open-skies program designed to be a safeguard
against surprise attack in the process of uni
versal disarmament. Russia refused lo consider
his plan.
hi November of 1956 Russia made ;i counter
proposal. In effect, the U.S.S.R. advocated
limited open skies with an international safety
patrol authorized to inspect a "partial" zone
stretching aOO miles on each side of the Iron
< urtain.
In London this week a five-power United
Nations Disarmament Conference is meeting
to discuss the possibilities of world-wide dis
armament. Russia., Britain, France, Canada and
the United Slates are attending.
U.S. delegate Harold Stassen told the group
yesterday thai Russia's November plan would
be acceptable if the partial zone were widened
to include parts of Russia herself and if the
Russians would agree that this open zone would
l»e only the beginning of a gradually expand
ing area.
In short, the I nitrd Stales will accept air
observation during a disarmament period in
return for partial ;• ir observation of Russia if

Russia agrees lo gradually expand her "open"
area.
In theory, the plan sounds like a small step
toward a regulated world disarmament pro
gram. with munitions kept to a minimum for
defense, lint why is Russia willing to do it
only gradually?
Here is the heart of the <\ave cartoon. Will
open-skies observations prove that disarma
ment is in process, or will it only mean that
Russia will organize a clever camouflage or
underground system lor manufacturing her
armaments? Will she cease her operations,
or merely gradually move them out of sight?
It is unfair, however, lo accuse Russia of
planning to disregard a covenant to which she
has not yet agreed, 112 or Britain, France, Canada
and the United Stales could also have an offi
cial in a cave claim false "■preparedness"" for
open-sky inspection.
The conflict, then, for all countries involved,
is national integrity versus national perpetua
tion. If all countries ahide by any agreements
they make, integrity and future are assured;
if all countries disregard such a covenant, only
cold-blooded annihilation of all will result. If
some countries abide by their agreement while
others do not, infamous victory will go down
in history over honest naivete.
International honest\ is at stake. Interna
tional survival is also at stake. To the gentle
men meeting in London we would s;iy we must
have our integrity and we must have our 112 uture
as well. (Consider wisely before von |>ul either
or both in danger.

his plan.
hi November of 1956 Russia made ;i counter
proposal. In effect, the U.S.S.R. advocated
limited open skies with an international safety
patrol authorized to inspect a "partial" zone
stretching aOO miles on each side of the Iron
< urtain.
In London this week a five-power United
Nations Disarmament Conference is meeting
to discuss the possibilities of world-wide dis
armament. Russia., Britain, France, Canada and
the United Slates are attending.
U.S. delegate Harold Stassen told the group
yesterday thai Russia's November plan would
be acceptable if the partial zone were widened
to include parts of Russia herself and if the
Russians would agree that this open zone would
l»e only the beginning of a gradually expand
ing area.
In short, the I nitrd Stales will accept air
observation during a disarmament period in
return for partial ;• ir observation of Russia if

Russia agrees lo gradually expand her "open"
area.
In theory, the plan sounds like a small step
toward a regulated world disarmament pro
gram. with munitions kept to a minimum for
defense, lint why is Russia willing to do it
only gradually?
Here is the heart of the <\ave cartoon. Will
open-skies observations prove that disarma
ment is in process, or will it only mean that
Russia will organize a clever camouflage or
underground system lor manufacturing her
armaments? Will she cease her operations,
or merely gradually move them out of sight?
It is unfair, however, lo accuse Russia of
planning to disregard a covenant to which she
has not yet agreed, 112 or Britain, France, Canada
and the United Stales could also have an offi
cial in a cave claim false "■preparedness"" for
open-sky inspection.
The conflict, then, for all countries involved,
is national integrity versus national perpetua
tion. If all countries ahide by any agreements
they make, integrity and future are assured;
if all countries disregard such a covenant, only
cold-blooded annihilation of all will result. If
some countries abide by their agreement while
others do not, infamous victory will go down
in history over honest naivete.
International honest\ is at stake. Interna
tional survival is also at stake. To the gentle
men meeting in London we would s;iy we must
have our integrity and we must have our 112 uture
as well. (Consider wisely before von |>ul either
