l hanks From lIR President
Editor, The Daily:
Speaking in a dual capacity as a student and
as president ol I lie Institute of International Re
lations I should like to express my apprecia
tion to Chuck Reynolds, Secretary-General of
Ihe seventh annual Model United Nations, the
Ml .M Secretariat., and all individuals and organi
zations who worked so diligently to make of the
Vlodel UN al Stanford the immense success it.
was.
The.").">() students and faculty advisers who
<ame from all over the Western United States to
Stanford participated in an MUN which gave
them both an insight into international relations
and an opportunity to enjoy Ihemselves while
gaining this insight. They will all bring back to
their campuses and communities the report that
Stanford University offered them an excellent
MUN session. Stanford's reputation has been
further enhanced as a result of the MUN.
f'or those Stanford students (and there were
all too few, unfortunately) who were spectators
at the General Assembly sessions, committee
sessions and council sessions, there was an op
portunity to see something of what the real UN
faces in its task of maintaining world peace. For
those Stanford students who participated in
MUN as committee chairmen, justices of the In
t< rnational Court and in other capacities ranging
from rapporteurs to messengers there was an
opportunity to gain the knowledge of what their
actual counterparts in the real UN have to do.

The whole MUN presented Stanford students'the
opportunity of gaining ;i hotter understanding of
international affairs.
Having seen the long hours of work, worry and
planning which every member of the Stanford
MUN staff contributed toward the final success
of the project, I am in a position to say thai from
the beginning I was absolutely certain that the
MUN would be an unqualified success. It was.
Stanford University owes all those who made it
that success a debt of gratitude. I, for one, thank
every person connected in whatever way with
the MUN at Stanford for a job superbly done.

Stanford participated in an MUN which gave
them both an insight into international relations
and an opportunity to enjoy Ihemselves while
gaining this insight. They will all bring back to
their campuses and communities the report that
Stanford University offered them an excellent
MUN session. Stanford's reputation has been
further enhanced as a result of the MUN.
f'or those Stanford students (and there were
all too few, unfortunately) who were spectators
at the General Assembly sessions, committee
sessions and council sessions, there was an op
portunity to see something of what the real UN
faces in its task of maintaining world peace. For
those Stanford students who participated in
MUN as committee chairmen, justices of the In
t< rnational Court and in other capacities ranging
from rapporteurs to messengers there was an
opportunity to gain the knowledge of what their
actual counterparts in the real UN have to do.

The whole MUN presented Stanford students'the
opportunity of gaining ;i hotter understanding of
international affairs.
Having seen the long hours of work, worry and
planning which every member of the Stanford
MUN staff contributed toward the final success
of the project, I am in a position to say thai from
the beginning I was absolutely certain that the
MUN would be an unqualified success. It was.
Stanford University owes all those who made it
that success a debt of gratitude. I, for one, thank
every person connected in whatever way with
the MUN at Stanford for a job superbly done.
