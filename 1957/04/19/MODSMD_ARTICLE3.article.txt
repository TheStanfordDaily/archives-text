## Denmark Journalism School Emphasizes Practical Work 
### Barbara Bachman 
No examinations, only three months of schooling and all expenses
paid are the "fate" of a journalism student in Denmark.
Dr. Erik Reske-Nielscn, from Aarhus University in Jutland, Den
mark, is head of the only school of journalism in the country. He
explained that practical experience is the emphasis for journalistic

training rather than classroom in
struction. All students work at
least two years in a professional
newspaper before entering the
university, he explained.
The employing newspaper then
gives the prospective students a
leave of absence and pays thoir
room, board and tuition while
they undergo an intensive three
month study at Aarhus Univer
sity.
Itcquirod Courses
Required courses in c 1 u d e a
broad liberal arts program, his
tory, politics, economics, statis
tics, psychology and specialized
journalism and communications
courses. On completion of the
300-hour curriculum, students are
then free and qualified to return
to their newspapers and resume
work.
Unlike most specialized sub
jects, no degrees are available for
these students, and their compe
tency and qualifications are de
termined almost solely by their
actual experience.
Commenting on the status of
Danish newspapers, he said "the
press is absolutely free," and no
papers except the official govern
ment periodical are owned by the
state.

15 seconds, I said 'Yes' and here
I am."

turer in contemporary history at
Aarhus University.
No examinations, only three months of schooling and all expenses
paid are the "fate" of a journalism student in Denmark.
Dr. Erik Reske-Nielscn, from Aarhus University in Jutland, Den
mark, is head of the only school of journalism in the country. He
explained that practical experience is the emphasis for journalistic

training rather than classroom in
struction. All students work at
least two years in a professional
newspaper before entering the
university, he explained.
The employing newspaper then
gives the prospective students a
leave of absence and pays thoir
room, board and tuition while
they undergo an intensive three
month study at Aarhus Univer
sity.
Itcquirod Courses
Required courses in c 1 u d e a
broad liberal arts program, his
tory, politics, economics, statis
tics, psychology and specialized
journalism and communications
courses. On completion of the
300-hour curriculum, students are
then free and qualified to return
to their newspapers and resume
work.
Unlike most specialized sub
jects, no degrees are available for
these students, and their compe
tency and qualifications are de
termined almost solely by their
actual experience.
Commenting on the status of
Danish newspapers, he said "the
press is absolutely free," and no
papers except the official govern
ment periodical are owned by the
state.
First Visit
Reske-Nielsen is currently visit
ing the United States for the first
time under the foreign leaders'
program of the International Edu
cational Service of the U.S. De
partment of State.
He explained that one day he
received a long-distance telephone
call from the U.S. embassy in Co
penhagen asking him if he'd be
interested in traveling in the Unit
ed States for three months, all
expenses paid.
"After contemplating for about
15 seconds, I said 'Yes' and here
I am."
While in the United States,
Reske-Nielsen has been particu
larly interested in the interna
tional relations and journalism
programs offered in American
universities. He is also a lec
turer in contemporary history at
Aarhus University.
