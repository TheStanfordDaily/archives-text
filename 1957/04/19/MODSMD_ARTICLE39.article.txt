# Card Thinclads Go South to Test Bruin Strength
## Jordan's Aces Again Shooting For Big Upset 
### Dick Barnes 
A pair of strong and evenly
matched track teams Stanford
and UCLA will meet Saturday
afternoon on the Bruins' West
wood oval. The meet is rated a
toss-up, with a number of events
which could go either way.
Payton Jordan's Stanford team
will be attempting to rebound
from its narrow loss to USC last
weekend, while UCLA wants to
prove its loss lo Occidental was
merely a strange combination of
bad breaks and not a true test of
ihe Bruins' strength.
Frank Herrmann and Chuck
Cobb, who scored 2.1 of Stan
ford's 59 points against the Tro
jans, are again the key men for
the Tribe. Herrmanti is a pro
hibitive favorite in the broad
jump and a narrow choice in the
100. He could pull a triple if he
can beat UCLA's Russ Ellis in the
220.
Cobb Seeks Double
Cobb looks good for another
double victory in Iho hurdles. His

strongest competition from the
Bruins will be offered by Ken
Thompson, a sophomore ace.
| Stanford's Bernie Nelson should
I be close in the highs.
Best field event battle of the
clay may be the high jump. Phil
Fehlen, at (J-BV>, boasts the best
mark of any of the entrants. UC
LA will counter with Nick Dyer,
last year's NCAA co-champ, and
Walt Torrence, another sopho
more sensation.
Two of Jordan's men, Don Che
sarek and Maury Graves, will
I each'go in only one individual

( event this week in place of doub
ling as they did against USC.
Chesurek Meets Seaman
Chesarek will have the job of
| battling UCLA's Bob Seaman in
! the 880, after Graves has had a
I crack at the Bruin distance star
in the mile. Seaman looms as the
favorite in both races, but will
be pressed, especially in the
shorter event.
UCLA's chances in the meet
could lake either a big rise or a
huge dip, depending on the con
ditions of David James and Rafer
Johnson. James is the best Bruin
sprinter, but has been bothered
with trouble in one leg and then
got hit in the other leg by a dis
cus last week.
Johnson, who would normally
go in six or seven events, has not
fully recovered from a knee op
eration he underwent after the
Olympics. As it looks now, John
son will compete in only the
three weight events.
Weights Important
Indian chances hinge a great
deal upon their fortunes in these
weight contests. Fred Peters has
consistently outthrown Don Vick
all year, but the Bruin ace is apt
to snap out of his slump at any
time as he did last year.
Hank Roldan should have no
trouble in the javelin, but the big
battle will be for second between
Johnson and the Tribe's Kirk
Nieland. Stanford needs the ex
tra two points here but Nieland
will have to go all out if the In
dians are to got them.
Herrman, Kent Hansen and
Chuck Peterson will be out to
sweep the broad jump as ihey
did against Troy. Strongest com
petition will come from Dick
Knaub, last year's PCC champ
bul a disappointment this season.
If Ihe meet comes down to the
relay, Stanford will be a definite
long-shot. UCLA has run almost
two seconds faster this year, and
has Ellis, who ran 46.6 two years
ago, running anchor for them.

Frank Herrmann and Chuck
Cobb, who scored 2.1 of Stan
ford's 59 points against the Tro
jans, are again the key men for
the Tribe. Herrmanti is a pro
hibitive favorite in the broad
jump and a narrow choice in the
100. He could pull a triple if he
can beat UCLA's Russ Ellis in the
220.
Cobb Seeks Double
Cobb looks good for another
double victory in Iho hurdles. His

strongest competition from the
Bruins will be offered by Ken
Thompson, a sophomore ace.
| Stanford's Bernie Nelson should
I be close in the highs.
Best field event battle of the
clay may be the high jump. Phil
Fehlen, at (J-BV>, boasts the best
mark of any of the entrants. UC
LA will counter with Nick Dyer,
last year's NCAA co-champ, and
Walt Torrence, another sopho
more sensation.
Two of Jordan's men, Don Che
sarek and Maury Graves, will
I each'go in only one individual

( event this week in place of doub
ling as they did against USC.
Chesurek Meets Seaman
Chesarek will have the job of
| battling UCLA's Bob Seaman in
! the 880, after Graves has had a
I crack at the Bruin distance star
in the mile. Seaman looms as the
favorite in both races, but will
be pressed, especially in the
shorter event.
UCLA's chances in the meet
could lake either a big rise or a
huge dip, depending on the con
ditions of David James and Rafer
Johnson. James is the best Bruin
sprinter, but has been bothered
with trouble in one leg and then
got hit in the other leg by a dis
cus last week.
Johnson, who would normally
go in six or seven events, has not
fully recovered from a knee op
eration he underwent after the
Olympics. As it looks now, John
son will compete in only the
three weight events.
Weights Important
Indian chances hinge a great
deal upon their fortunes in these
weight contests. Fred Peters has
consistently outthrown Don Vick
all year, but the Bruin ace is apt
to snap out of his slump at any
time as he did last year.
Hank Roldan should have no
trouble in the javelin, but the big
battle will be for second between
Johnson and the Tribe's Kirk
Nieland. Stanford needs the ex
tra two points here but Nieland
will have to go all out if the In
dians are to got them.
Herrman, Kent Hansen and
Chuck Peterson will be out to
sweep the broad jump as ihey
did against Troy. Strongest com
petition will come from Dick
Knaub, last year's PCC champ
bul a disappointment this season.
If Ihe meet comes down to the
relay, Stanford will be a definite
long-shot. UCLA has run almost
two seconds faster this year, and
has Ellis, who ran 46.6 two years
ago, running anchor for them.
A pair of strong and evenly
matched track teams Stanford
and UCLA will meet Saturday
afternoon on the Bruins' West

will be attempting to rebound
