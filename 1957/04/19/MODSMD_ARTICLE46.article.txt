## 
### 
Lanky Dan Gaffney hurled aj
masterful three-hitter here yes
terday afternoon to give Santa i
Clara a 2-0 victory over Stanford.
Tomorrow coach I Hitch Fehr
ing's Tribe travels to Berkeley to
face the league-leading California
Bears.
Rich DeFabio was the only In
dian to have much luck against
Gaffney, picking up a double and
a single. The other Stanford blow
was a looping double by shortstop
Steve Stewart.
Runs Unearned
The Broncos picked up their
two runs, both unearned, in the
fifth inning, thanks to a wild
pitch and a passed ball.
Eddie Allen opened by working
Walt Payne for a base on balls.
Gaffney followed by belting a
long double to deep center field,
sending Allen to third.
With Tim Goode at the plate,
Payne bounced one past catcher
Ralph Holding, allowing Allen to
score. After Goode had walked,
Gaffney scored when Holding let
another pitch get through him fori
a passed ball.
Payne found himself in more i
trouble in the sixth when the!
Broncos loaded the bases, with no j
outs. The veteran right hander |
got out of this one beautifully,
however, as Bill Hutcheson forced
the lead runner at the plate and
George Soetje grounded into a
double play.
Bear Attack Strong
Coach George Wolfman's league
leading Bears will host UCLA to-1
day and meet the Cards tomor-;
row.
. Cal boasts a powerful hitting
attack, with sophomore second
baseman Roger Gregg topping
the CIBA with a fantastic .625
mark. Some indication of the
Bears' strength is shown in that
Earl Robinson, their leading hit -

tor last season in addition to be
ing all-conference, is not even in
the starting lineup this year.
Other sluggers in the Cal attack
are shortstop Ron Gaggero, first
baseman Warren Lavorel and
right fielder Boh Puccinelli, called
the "best hitter."

pitched the third no-hit game in
