# Powerful UCLA, USC Net Squads Will Meet Cards
## 
### 
Today at 1 p.m. Stanford's ten
nis team will host a UCLA club;
that has six out of seven men j
hack from last year's NCAA I
champions.
Since they are ineligible for the
nationals this year, the Bruins
are seemingly trying harder than
ever to make routs out of dual
meets such as this afternoon's
match. Already this season coach
J. D. Morgan's whizzes have serv
ed and smashed their way to 9-0
wins over both Cal and Stanford
and a 6-3 victory over USC.
Tomorrow on the same varsity
courts the Indians will take on
USC, which cut down coach Rob
Renker's racqueteers on April 5,
8-1.
Back from UCLA's 1956 nation
al champions are Mike Franks,
Mike Green, John Lesch, John
Cranston, Franklin Johnston and
Captain Dwight Makoff. All are
juniors except seniors Johnston
and Makotf.
Franks and Green were PCC
doubles titleholders last year and
both reached the semi-finals in the
NCAA showdown.
USC and Stanford, second and
third, respectively, in national col
legiate competition last year, have
suffered stiff losses through grad
uation, but have strengthened
their ranks with talented new
comers.
