# "What's it like to be A PHYSICIST AT IBM?"

"I was tremendously impressed," says
Nick, "by my first plant tour. When
you go through the facilities—meet
the men and get an idea of the prob
lems they handle—you can't help but
become interested. Add the friendly,
informal work atmosphere, and you
know right oil the bat these people
have a story to tell."
Nick came to IBM in 1951 with a
B.S. in physics. He started as a Tech
nical Engineer—in Test Equipment
Engineering—working on an analog
bombing system. When that project
moved from the Endicott to the
Poughkeepsie plant, Nick followed it,
becoming first an Associate Engineer,
then a Project Engineer. As the lat-

Five years ago, college senior Nick Hemmer asked himself this question.
Today, as Administrative Assistant to the Quality Control manager, Nick
reviews his experience at IBM and gives some pointers that may be helpful
to you in taking the first, most important step in your career as a physicist.

tion of alloys ... or of the properties
of metals, such as the resistivity of
germanium. Then, there are the im
portant 'analysis of failure' and
reliability studies, in which you seek
to determine, for example, the 'life

tration and concentricity of colloidal
solutions?" "Present a job in terms
of actual problems," believes Nick,
"and you'll get the man's interest—
for it's his career and his future that
have top priority."
How about further study?
Nick has taken full advantage of
IBM's extensive educational facilities
to get ahead at IBM. He took at least
one course each semester on subjects
within his immediate work area
courses on digital and analog com
puters and on their components such
as cores and transistors. He found
time to take management courses as
well. "If you want opportunity for
study," Nick says, "IBM will provide
all you want."

ter, he worked on IBM's first transis
torized electronic computer—the 608.
By November, '55, Nick was head
ing up Quality Engineering in the
Quality Control Division of the
Poughkeepsie plant. Recently pro
moted to Administrative Assistant to
the Quality Control manager, Nick
now concerns himself with the funda
mental operations and policies of this
450-man division. Quality Control is
responsible for the performance of
IBM's vast array of business ma
chines—from simple sorters and
punches to the "electronic brains."
What an IBM physicist does
"The problems of Quality Control
in this business are endless," Nick
reports, "and fascinating to the phys
icist. There's process control—of the
manufacture of components such as
transistors and cores ... of the con
tents of a gas ... of the concentricity
of an etch solution ... of the difTrac

expectancy' of a device, the mean
time between failures, or perhaps
which step in a process has the great
est effect on the equipment involved.
You may be asked to control the
deposit of glass on X-ray tubes to
avoid spill-over, or microscopic spot
ting. Or you may be dealing with
arc-suppression, or gaseous electron
ics, the grass roots of instrumentation;
or in the estimation of tolerances, or

Asked about opportunities for ad
vancement at IBM, Nick says,"The
situation could hardly be better in
that respect. With sales doubling
every five years on the average, pro
motion is almost inevitable."

IBM hopes that this message will help to
give you some idea of what it's like to be
a physicist at IBM. There are equal op
portunities for E.E.'s, M.E.'s, mathema
ticians and Liberal Arts majors in IBM's
many divisions—Research, Manufactur
ing Engineering, Sales and Technical
Services. Why not drop in and discuss
IBM with your Placement Director? He
can supply our latest brochure and tell
you when IBM will next interview on
your campus. Meanwhile, our Manager
of Engineering Recruitment, Mr. R. A.
Whitehorne, will be happy to answer your
questions. Just write him at IBM, Room

in correlation coefficients—that is,
in physically sound numbers."
Nick has been instrumental in
encouraging many college physics
majors to come to IBM. "I find
they're interested in questions like
these," he says: "How would you go
about determining the 'life' of elec
trons in transition from the valence
to the conduction band?" Or, in the
manufacture of magnetic inks, "How
can the grain size of the iron content
be controlled ... or its viscosity regu
lated over wide temperature ranges?
How would you control the concen-
