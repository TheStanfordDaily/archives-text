# Drive Provides Friends, Funds for Con Home
## 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Stanford's first Con Home was
located in what now houses the
Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.
Begun in 1917 by University
Chaplain Dr. D. Charles Gardner
as the Campus Auxiliary to Stan
ford Clinics, the Convalescent
Home is a private institution
which accepts children from four
to 12 years old, of any race,
creed or color, convalescing from
such non-communicable diseases
as rheumatic fever, polio and
malnutrition.
When the home first began,
children were brought from San
p-rancisco to the campus for a
week or two in the summer. In
1919 the home received the house
and grounds of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford plus an endowment of
$100,000 from Mrs. Henry Crock
er, Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Mrs. Charles
B. Lathrop, Mrs. Herbert Hoover
and Selah Chamberlain.
Additions Made
Four years later McLaughlin,
the boys' bed unit, was added,
made possible by a gift of $40,-
000. In 1929 a $40,000 auxiliary
unit was built, which accommo
dates 80 children. Finally the ad
ministration building was com
pleted four years ago.
The "Con Home" is the only
charity hospital in the U.S. which
is located on a college campus.
It is supported entirely by trust
funds, drives sponsored by jun
ior auxiliaries and the Stanford
student body during the annual
"Con Home Week" drive.
Medical care is donated to the
children by a staff of Palo Alto
pediatricians under the supervi
sion of Dr. H. Faber, but many
children have their own doctors
attend them. Dental care is giv
en by a visiting children's dental
specialist.
Classroom Instruction
In addition to medical care, the
children receive regular class
room instruction from kindergar
ten through the sixth grade. The
educational program is under the
joint supervision of the San
Francisco State Department and
the Palo Alto Board of Education
and is partially supported by
state funds.
Each child is provided with rec
reation according to his physical
abilities. This is integrated with
the home's occupational therapy
program.
Playground facilities are pro
vided. Music appreciation and
dancing lessons furnish a chance
for talent outlets. A scouting
program—including Cub Scouts,
Brownies and Boy and Girl
Scouts—is also functioning.

McDONALD VISITS CON HOME —Sam McDonald visited the
Stanford Convalescent Home last week along with members of
tlie Con Home Drives Committee and Public Relations Board.
They held an organization meeting for Con Home Week and visited
with children in the Con Home.
Stanford's first Con Home was
located in what now houses the
Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.
Begun in 1917 by University
Chaplain Dr. D. Charles Gardner
as the Campus Auxiliary to Stan
ford Clinics, the Convalescent
Home is a private institution
which accepts children from four
to 12 years old, of any race,
creed or color, convalescing from
such non-communicable diseases
as rheumatic fever, polio and
malnutrition.
When the home first began,
children were brought from San
p-rancisco to the campus for a
week or two in the summer. In
1919 the home received the house
and grounds of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford plus an endowment of
$100,000 from Mrs. Henry Crock
er, Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Mrs. Charles
B. Lathrop, Mrs. Herbert Hoover
and Selah Chamberlain.
Additions Made
Four years later McLaughlin,
the boys' bed unit, was added,
made possible by a gift of $40,-
000. In 1929 a $40,000 auxiliary
unit was built, which accommo
dates 80 children. Finally the ad
ministration building was com
pleted four years ago.
The "Con Home" is the only
charity hospital in the U.S. which
is located on a college campus.
It is supported entirely by trust
funds, drives sponsored by jun
ior auxiliaries and the Stanford
student body during the annual
"Con Home Week" drive.
Medical care is donated to the
children by a staff of Palo Alto
pediatricians under the supervi
sion of Dr. H. Faber, but many
children have their own doctors
attend them. Dental care is giv
en by a visiting children's dental
specialist.
Classroom Instruction
In addition to medical care, the
children receive regular class
room instruction from kindergar
ten through the sixth grade. The
educational program is under the
joint supervision of the San
Francisco State Department and
the Palo Alto Board of Education
and is partially supported by
state funds.
Each child is provided with rec
reation according to his physical
abilities. This is integrated with
the home's occupational therapy
program.
Playground facilities are pro
vided. Music appreciation and
dancing lessons furnish a chance
for talent outlets. A scouting
