# Gina Bachauer Gets Standing Ovation for Brilliant Concert
## Greek Pianist's Performance Demonstrates Technical Competence, Depth of Feeling 
### Dick Lee 
Gina Bachauer, famous Greek pianist, played to a receptive audi
ence Saturday evening at Memorial Hall in the final concert of the
ASSU Concert Series season. The concert patrons demanded four
encores and many curtain calls before ending the evening with a
prolonged standing ovationâ€”a rare occurrence at Stanford concerts.
Scheduled originally as a substitute for the late Walter Gieseking,
Madame Bachauer deserves immense praise as a great concert artist.
She demonstrated throughout her program an amazing virtuosity
and brilliance. Her technical com- r

petence, moreover, was support
ed by a great depth of feeling and
understanding toward the works
she presented.
This combination of artistry
and virtuosity enabled Madame
Baehauer to perform "Pictures at
an Exhibition" by Moussorgsky,
considered a tour de force for
piano, in a way that illustrated
ihe vast range of expression and
dynamics possible from the
piano.
Ravel Uneconomical
The Ravel version of this work,
for full orchestra, seems totally
uneconomical compared with the
original piano score when played
by such an amazing artist.
The Bach-Tausig "Toccata and
Fugue in D minor" and the three
Scarlatti sonatas .which opened
Saturday's program, most ade
quately indicated Madame Ba
chauer's artistic understanding.
All four works were crisp and ar
ticulate with well-controlled dy
namic contrasts appropriate to
Baroque works.
< hopin Disappointing
The "Sonata in B minor" by
Chopin was disappointing. Willi
the exception of the exciting fi
nale, the sonata as played mean
dered through sections some
times beautiful hut mostly bor
ing.

The other encores three Scot
tish fiances by Chopin and two
preludes by Scriabin only
served further to convince the
Stanford audience that they were
hearing a superb pianist.
