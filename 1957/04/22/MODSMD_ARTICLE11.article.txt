# Honeywell, Messinger Present Platforms

### 
Keillor's Nole: The Daily is re
printing in condensed form the
stands which the two ASSU pres
idential candidates have taken on
(he nine major issues facing the
student body:
(!aii<li<lacy Reasons
Honeywell: If student politics
were running along smoothly on
a high plane, or if I felt I hat it
were irrevocably to sputter along
on a low level, I am certain I
would not he a candidate today.
I have discovered as junior class
president that a positive attitude
and program can put student
government back in its proper
perspective.
Messinger: My candidacy for
the ASSU presidency was stimu
lated by the apparent need for
some sort of a revitalizing pro
gram in student government and
student affairs.
Participation in ASSU
Honeywell: I believe a positive
trend could be established by: (a)
encouraging officers to select ap
pointees who are leaders, not
merely workers, (b> engaging
personally in a campaign to in
duce prominent students to run
for office.
Messinger: The key to sus
tained participation and interest
is to create a governmental or
ganization characterized by effi-

Henry and c o m p e t c nc y and
whose aim is directed toward
student oriented interests.
A SSI I and Adininis-
I ration
Honeywell: Despite apparent
administrative ultimatums, I he
lieve that no irreconcilable con
flict exists. It is up to us to ex
press our position and show evi
dence of an ability to intelligently
manage our own affairs.
Messinger: Student govern
ment as it reflects student opin
ion should exist as a working
pa finer in determining policy af
fecting the students; and surely
this is the feeling of the adminis
tration.
Aradcmir Karilitirs
Honeywell: The present bal
ance between academic and non
academic activities is essentially
a healthy one. An essential part
of the academic phase of govern
ment is often overlooked, e.g.,
Foreign Scholarship, ItR, Honor
Code and Speech Activities.
Messinger: Surely since the
primary aim of this University is
an academic one, student govern
ment should in every way co-op
erate with the administration as
well ;is do everything in its pow
er to maintain high academic
standards.

I in proving I'acilifirs
Honeywell: Bookstore proce
dure is a matter ot particular
concern. A recent attempt to del
egate student rebates to the Tres
idder Union has been marked by
inadequate investigation. 1 would
make a thorough examination of
the problem.
Messinger: In such things as
the Union, Library, Bookstore,
etc., student government should
tirsl seek to locate specific areas
where improvement programs
might he initiated, and then
should actively seek to fulfill this
program.
< haters
Honeywell: Proposals of
sweeping constitutional changes
have done little to modify the pat
tern of student government. The
time invested in a thorough study
of such proposals could more pro
ductively have been directed into
other channels.
Messinger: I have not studied
the constitution closely enough to !
feel competent to make a state
ment as to possible changes in its ,
structure.
Administrative Assistant
Honeywell: This role is valu
able in that it relieves the execu
tive of many administrative de-1
tails, but a lack of diplomacy in i
past officers has led to criticism I

of the function of the office itself.
Messinger: The role of admin
istrative assistant to the presi
dent should be just what the title
implies he should he an assist
ant helping to relieve some of the
"busy-work" which accumulates;
he should definitely not be a pol
icy maker, and he should definite
ly not be a leading influence in
the Legislature.
Students
Honeywell: It is unreasonable
and impractical to expect any in
dividual to seek out and express
student opinions; he thinks and
acts as he finds appropriate.
Messinger: The primary aim
of student government should be
to represent the students and to
help create a University satisfac
tory to the needs and interests
of the student body.
Wiv Daily
Honeywell: Since a critical
Daily is vital to the proper func
tioning of student government, it
is necessary that the government
impose no control, either direct
or approbative, over The Daily.
Messinger: Student govern
ment should seek to stimulate
through co-operation and sugges
tion not through legislation
improvement of The Daily, or
any student organization for that
matter, as the need for that im
provement arises.

encouraging officers to select ap

of the student body.
Wiv Daily
Honeywell: Since a critical
Daily is vital to the proper func
tioning of student government, it
is necessary that the government
impose no control, either direct
or approbative, over The Daily.
Messinger: Student govern
ment should seek to stimulate
through co-operation and sugges
tion not through legislation
improvement of The Daily, or
any student organization for that
matter, as the need for that im
provement arises.
Keillor's Nole: The Daily is re
printing in condensed form the
stands which the two ASSU pres
idential candidates have taken on
(he nine major issues facing the
student body:
(!aii<li<lacy Reasons
Honeywell: If student politics
were running along smoothly on
a high plane, or if I felt I hat it
were irrevocably to sputter along
on a low level, I am certain I
would not he a candidate today.
I have discovered as junior class
president that a positive attitude
and program can put student
government back in its proper
perspective.
Messinger: My candidacy for
the ASSU presidency was stimu
lated by the apparent need for
some sort of a revitalizing pro
gram in student government and
student affairs.
Participation in ASSU
Honeywell: I believe a positive
trend could be established by: (a)
encouraging officers to select ap
pointees who are leaders, not
merely workers, (b> engaging
personally in a campaign to in
duce prominent students to run
for office.
Messinger: The key to sus
tained participation and interest
is to create a governmental or
ganization characterized by effi-

Henry and c o m p e t c nc y and
whose aim is directed toward
student oriented interests.
A SSI I and Adininis-
I ration
Honeywell: Despite apparent
administrative ultimatums, I he
lieve that no irreconcilable con
flict exists. It is up to us to ex
press our position and show evi
dence of an ability to intelligently
manage our own affairs.
Messinger: Student govern
ment as it reflects student opin
ion should exist as a working
pa finer in determining policy af
fecting the students; and surely
this is the feeling of the adminis
tration.
Aradcmir Karilitirs
Honeywell: The present bal
ance between academic and non
academic activities is essentially
a healthy one. An essential part
of the academic phase of govern
ment is often overlooked, e.g.,
Foreign Scholarship, ItR, Honor
Code and Speech Activities.
Messinger: Surely since the
primary aim of this University is
an academic one, student govern
ment should in every way co-op
erate with the administration as
well ;is do everything in its pow
er to maintain high academic
standards.

I in proving I'acilifirs
Honeywell: Bookstore proce
dure is a matter ot particular
concern. A recent attempt to del
egate student rebates to the Tres
idder Union has been marked by
inadequate investigation. 1 would
make a thorough examination of
the problem.
Messinger: In such things as
the Union, Library, Bookstore,
etc., student government should
tirsl seek to locate specific areas
where improvement programs
might he initiated, and then
should actively seek to fulfill this
program.
< haters
Honeywell: Proposals of
sweeping constitutional changes
have done little to modify the pat
tern of student government. The
time invested in a thorough study
of such proposals could more pro
ductively have been directed into
other channels.
Messinger: I have not studied
the constitution closely enough to !
feel competent to make a state
ment as to possible changes in its ,
structure.
Administrative Assistant
Honeywell: This role is valu
able in that it relieves the execu
tive of many administrative de-1
tails, but a lack of diplomacy in i
past officers has led to criticism I

of the function of the office itself.
Messinger: The role of admin
istrative assistant to the presi
dent should be just what the title
implies he should he an assist
ant helping to relieve some of the
"busy-work" which accumulates;
he should definitely not be a pol
icy maker, and he should definite
ly not be a leading influence in
the Legislature.
Students
Honeywell: It is unreasonable
and impractical to expect any in
dividual to seek out and express
student opinions; he thinks and
acts as he finds appropriate.
Messinger: The primary aim
of student government should be
to represent the students and to
help create a University satisfac
tory to the needs and interests
of the student body.
