For all new joining members
(as well as old members) a ticket
will be issued, or life membership
card serves as admission, to the
Annual Stanford Conference, to
be held May 18.
A series of talks will be given
by Deans P. H. Rhinelander and
H. D. Winbigler as well as Lloyd
Dinklespiel, chairman of the
Board of Trustees, on the subject
of long-range Stanford plans.
Tonight in living groups stu
dents will hear plans for the
Alumni Associaiton membership
drive.
Members of Axe Society will
distribute the new Alumni Asso
ciation telephone directories.
The theme for the membership
drive will be "Join the 88 Club,"
signifying the new $8 down and
eight years to pay life member
ship. Members pay $8 down, $9
the second year, and so on for
eight years (adding $1 more each
year to accelerate the payments),
until the $100 life membership fee
is paid up.
During this time and immedi
ately after the down payment,
new members begin to receive all
privileges of Alumni Association
membership, including the award
winning Stanford Review, telling
the "inside story" of all campus
events.
Other Advantages
Other advantages of joining in
elude advance reservation for
football tickets, discounts for
Camp Fallen Leaf (operated for
the alumni and friends), plus a
saving of $15 if a life membership
is purchased, or a down payment
is made, before graduation.
Robert Pierce, assistant to the
president of the Alumni Associa
tion, urged all students to take
advantage now of the 88 Club be
fore graduation, when the price
goes up. The phone card contains
all campus numbers, information
on the 88 Club and a counter
check with a return postcard to
facilitate joining and mailing.
Pierce suggested that the card
serves as an able hint to the folks
at home for a lifelong graduation
present. Bill Crookston, president
of Axe Society, remarked on the
simplicity of the counter check
and postcard combination as well
as the usefulness of the phone
numbers, ready for wallet or
purse.
