Ton\Y Tin: FRFSTIMKN ou the Daily staff are
{Milling out the newspaper. The entire pro
duction of the paper is in tlieir hands. Every
\ear I! i<- freshmen on The Daily are given one
edition which is entirely their own. We be
lieve this practice will build a better staff for
the future of The Stanford Daily.
Il is the opinion of the entire editorial board
of Ihe Dailv I hat this year's freshman class is

the most promising ever to serve on the paper.
We have no doubt that today's paper shows
this talent.
The Daily has a problem of being short
stalled. If future freshman staffers are like
this year's, then the outlook for a future reallv
great Daily is bright indeed.
