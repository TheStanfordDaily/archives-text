Allocation of funds from cam
pus drives falls under the super

which is seeking new members
this week.
Sign-up lists are posted at the
ASSU office beginning today, and
interviews will begin tomorrow
from 2 to 5:30 p.m. at the Wom

according to Nancy Williams,
this year's committee chairman.
All undergraduates and grad
uates are eligible to apply for the
committee, and Miss Williams
said persons interested in acting
as chairmen for drives are urged
to try out.
Drives Committee is in charge
of fall and winter quarter fund
raising. Members also decide how
to allocate the money raised in
the drives.
Miss Williams explained that
this year was the first year the
committee had sponsored one
main drive instead of several.
Some $3000 was raised in the
drive winter quarter and was di
vided among the Community
Chest, Red Cross and World tlni
versity Service. Skip Renner was
chairman of the drive.
A floating fund is maintained
by the committee to take care of
smaller charities which seek do
nations. Miss Williams said that
committee members discuss the
various applications for assist
ance and decide which ones to
send aid.
Members of the committee are
chosen to represent different liv
ing areas.
