						Crack at Apathy

Till IIWI, ASSU Kt.FCTIONS which lake place
place todav and tomorrow will be the most
important that have taken "place in the last
few vears. I he recent Daily controversy has
Iconght the activities of Legislature and the
A'SSU as a whole more prominently before the
eyes of most students.
\\ hat appears to be the start of a new in
terest in student government has been shown
this spring in the largest turnout of candidates
and the largest primary voting within memory.
\inety-two people ran for office and almost
.'lOOO voted iu the initial primary. If these
figures mean anything, students seem to he
more concerned now with who represents them.
I his trend i< the first step toward ridding
Stanford of the indifference with which it is
charged. If this movement is to continue, and
we are finalK to shake off the famed "apathy,"
then the best men and women must be elected
today and tomorrow. They must be students
who will have the confidence of the student
bod\ and who will restore student government
to tin' place of respect it deserves.
Tiny can only have the confidence of the
student body if tliev are elected by nil of it.
I or all the enlarged turnout of voters iu the
primary, only per cent of the 8000 Stanford
students cast ballots. This is a horribly small
percentage. It only looks good because pre
vious elections have been worse.
\\ hen next year's government starts acting,
there will be criticism of it no matter how
good a job it does. But students who scream

and tirade against actions of a president and
Legislature they did not even bother to help
select are pitiful members of our community
and don I deserve tlie freedom of speech tliev
misuse.
Ihe stands taken by the two presidential
candidates, W ally Honeywell and Jim IVlessin
ger, on nine major issues appear on the front
page of this paper. Each student should ex
amine the ideas these two men represent and
1 hen make his or her choice. A student's "voice"
in the government should be used now, in the
election, not next quarter in fruitless criticism.
I lie candidates themselves have shown great
enthusiasm so far, and if this enthusiasm car
ries over into next quarter, Stanford may have
its most active ASSU Legislature in years. The
issues of I lie new Tresidder Memorial Union,
the eh ange in Bookstore management, what to
do ill. rebates, fraternity policy, abolition of
the Cabinet, and studies of ASSU organizations
will certainly come before Legislature.
I he question of confidence in officers is one
that seems lar removed from most students.
Hul confidence in the head yell leader is very
obvious. Cheering sections should respect him
and be ready to follow him enthusiastically.
I here must be no more early leaving, half
hearted response and childish card-lbrowing.
The entire student body must elect a yell leader
whom they will follow willingly.
A SSI I president, representatives and head
yell leader must be selected by every student
in what looks like the year that Stanford "in
difference" can finally be licked.
