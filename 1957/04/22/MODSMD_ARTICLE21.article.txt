I?nssian Prejudice
Editor, Tho Daily:
In your April 19 notorial, reference is made
to a cartoon from tho Now Yorkor magazine.
Tho cartoon shows somo military mon, without,
insignia or any other national identification, in
vpeeling their underground installations. There
is no evidence in the cartoon as to what, nation
ality these military men are, yet in your editorial
you identify them as Russian. How so? What
li e of n>a"nning did you use to conclude that
they wore Russians and not, perhaps, French,
l nglish, German, Dutch fir Swedes?
Is the tribal self adoration and mental eon
mi li i thai pi 'gii's your papei such that youx'

staff even sees Russians lurking in cartoons in
Ihe American magazines for no logical reasons?
I realize that the fear of Communism has caused
us to accept executive orders setting up loyalty
tests, tft accept military programs on the Ameri
can campus, to accept investigations of profes
sors and texts, to accept Eastland-type commit
tees, to accept blacklisting and to accept other
anti-intellectual aspects of a soeiety; but to have
this fear, coupled with the self-adoration, causes
you to sop Rods in cartoons, where Ihore are no
Reds, one can only conclude that the society that
produces such thinking and reasoning is in a sad
'â€¢ate of affairs. Further coverage of this sub
ject ran bo found in ihi week's "Non Grata."
