# One Quick Wink

### Jack Winkler 
If you sit outside the Cellar tong enough and
drink enough cups of coffee, you may get to
know a friend of mine. Actually he isn't around
there too much, but when he does show up you
can't help noticing him, because he's the only
one-legged blackbird now in the hand-out line at
Stanford.
One day, I was sitting on that bench by the
trash can, a very popular spot for the local birds,

and was dishing out the daily
unemployment benefit of
glazed doughnut crumbs to the
sparrows and blackbirds and
dogs and cats and ants and
grad students that hang
around there.
I was down to the last few
bits when I happened to look
up to that ledge in front of the
ASSU offices and I saw this
one-legged blackbird standing
there completely alone. He

didn't seem to be looking my way, but if there's
one thing I've learned about birds, it is that
they're always looking, even when they have
their tail feathers sticking up at you.
Now, naturally, I felt sorry for this bird, bo
cause it's tough enough to fight for your daily
bread and cup cakes if you have two legs, but
if you'll stuck with only one, you're not going
to get anything unless some guy rings you one
right around the beak with a doughnut. And
how many Stanford students throw away whole
doughnuts, much less that accurately?
I became intrigued by this bird, looking down
like a king on the rabble below struggling for its
daily pittance. The ordinary birds £brt of sprint
for a crumb, pick it up on the run, then gulp it
down before anyone else can take it from them.
They must really have indigestion problems.
This hand-to-cement-to-mouth feeding system is
n't the most leisurely. The sparrows are really
much quicker than the blackbirds, but they're
afraid of getting kicked in the shuffle or being
hit by falling crumbs.
Actually, latest psychological studies show
that these birds prefer ham and cheese sand
wiches, but if you haven't got the money for that
kind of handout they won't mind doughnuts. But
be sure not to dump down too large a crumb be
cause there is nothing that scares birds away

quicker than some big doughnut meteorite fly
ing down at them.
But getting back to my one-legged friend I
call him Gimp now. I tried all kinds of food to
get him to come down to me, but he would only
leave that ledge when all the other birds were
away. Finally I found that his weakness was
deep dish apple pie. Well, to make a long story
short, we've gotten to be great pals, Gimp and I.
It's a question of mutual need. I feed him deep
dish apple pie, and that solves his food problem.
Then I tell him my girls problem. Of course, he
doesn't solve them, but then can any girl prob
lem be solved?
Actually he has made suggestions at times and
he's told me a few things about ihe natural
rights of birds, about the great Declaration of
Dependence and their inalienable rights to life,
liberty and doughnuts. He's got lots of inside
information and tips. For instance, if you want
to get fi'iendly with a chick—you don't see too
many of that kind of bird around the Cellar of
course—feed it applesauce cup cakes.
Actually, he said he isn't a regular blackbird
at_all, but a Brewer's blackbird. I asked him if
that wasn't illegal in California, what with the
age limit and all, but he showed me his ID, so
I guess he's older than he looks. I'm not much
at telling blackbirds' ages anyhow.
He said it is lonely being a one-legged black
bird because he's an outcast and hungry at times.
It's made all the worse because his nest is up
in the corner of one of the ASSU offices, and
there isn't much food for thought or anything
else up there. He wanted me to keep this quiet
because he hasn't been too popular with the last
five or six ASSU presidents and is afraid he
might be evicted. I said he didn't have to worry,
because we reporters hadn't built up to good a
record on that score either.
Anyhow, we get together for a little talk every
morning around 10:30. He is usually perched on
the awning over the counter wailing for me.
If you'd like to meet him sometime and talk over
your girl problems, I'm sure I could arrange an
interview. He's pretty good on boy problems
too, because he's had some experience with ihe
women. How do you think he lost that leg?
But that's another story. Of course, you'd have
to have a personality interview; lie's pretty
choosy about his acquaintances. Oh, and be sure
to bring along some of that deep dish apple pie.

short, we've gotten to be great pals, Gimp and I.
It's a question of mutual need. I feed him deep
dish apple pie, and that solves his food problem.
Then I tell him my girls problem. Of course, he
doesn't solve them, but then can any girl prob
lem be solved?
Actually he has made suggestions at times and
he's told me a few things about ihe natural
rights of birds, about the great Declaration of
Dependence and their inalienable rights to life,
liberty and doughnuts. He's got lots of inside
information and tips. For instance, if you want
to get fi'iendly with a chick—you don't see too
many of that kind of bird around the Cellar of
course—feed it applesauce cup cakes.
Actually, he said he isn't a regular blackbird
at_all, but a Brewer's blackbird. I asked him if
that wasn't illegal in California, what with the
age limit and all, but he showed me his ID, so
I guess he's older than he looks. I'm not much
at telling blackbirds' ages anyhow.
He said it is lonely being a one-legged black
bird because he's an outcast and hungry at times.
It's made all the worse because his nest is up
in the corner of one of the ASSU offices, and
there isn't much food for thought or anything
else up there. He wanted me to keep this quiet
because he hasn't been too popular with the last
five or six ASSU presidents and is afraid he
might be evicted. I said he didn't have to worry,
because we reporters hadn't built up to good a
record on that score either.
Anyhow, we get together for a little talk every
morning around 10:30. He is usually perched on
the awning over the counter wailing for me.
If you'd like to meet him sometime and talk over
your girl problems, I'm sure I could arrange an
interview. He's pretty good on boy problems
too, because he's had some experience with ihe
women. How do you think he lost that leg?
But that's another story. Of course, you'd have
to have a personality interview; lie's pretty
choosy about his acquaintances. Oh, and be sure
to bring along some of that deep dish apple pie.

If you sit outside the Cellar tong enough and
drink enough cups of coffee, you may get to
know a friend of mine. Actually he isn't around
there too much, but when he does show up you
can't help noticing him, because he's the only
one-legged blackbird now in the hand-out line at
Stanford.
One day, I was sitting on that bench by the
trash can, a very popular spot for the local birds,

and was dishing out the daily
unemployment benefit of
glazed doughnut crumbs to the
sparrows and blackbirds and
dogs and cats and ants and
grad students that hang
around there.
I was down to the last few
bits when I happened to look
up to that ledge in front of the
ASSU offices and I saw this
one-legged blackbird standing
there completely alone. He

didn't seem to be looking my way, but if there's
one thing I've learned about birds, it is that
they're always looking, even when they have
their tail feathers sticking up at you.
Now, naturally, I felt sorry for this bird, bo
cause it's tough enough to fight for your daily
bread and cup cakes if you have two legs, but
if you'll stuck with only one, you're not going
to get anything unless some guy rings you one
right around the beak with a doughnut. And
how many Stanford students throw away whole
doughnuts, much less that accurately?
I became intrigued by this bird, looking down
like a king on the rabble below struggling for its
daily pittance. The ordinary birds £brt of sprint
for a crumb, pick it up on the run, then gulp it
down before anyone else can take it from them.
They must really have indigestion problems.
This hand-to-cement-to-mouth feeding system is
n't the most leisurely. The sparrows are really
much quicker than the blackbirds, but they're
afraid of getting kicked in the shuffle or being
hit by falling crumbs.
Actually, latest psychological studies show
that these birds prefer ham and cheese sand
wiches, but if you haven't got the money for that
kind of handout they won't mind doughnuts. But
be sure not to dump down too large a crumb be
cause there is nothing that scares birds away

quicker than some big doughnut meteorite fly
ing down at them.
But getting back to my one-legged friend I
call him Gimp now. I tried all kinds of food to
get him to come down to me, but he would only
leave that ledge when all the other birds were
away. Finally I found that his weakness was
deep dish apple pie. Well, to make a long story

there too much, but when he does show up you
can't help noticing him, because he's the only
one-legged blackbird now in the hand-out line at
Stanford.
One day, I was sitting on that bench by the
trash can, a very popular spot for the local birds,

and was dishing out the daily
unemployment benefit of
glazed doughnut crumbs to the
sparrows and blackbirds and
dogs and cats and ants and
grad students that hang
around there.
I was down to the last few
bits when I happened to look
up to that ledge in front of the
ASSU offices and I saw this
one-legged blackbird standing
there completely alone. He

didn't seem to be looking my way, but if there's
one thing I've learned about birds, it is that
they're always looking, even when they have
their tail feathers sticking up at you.
Now, naturally, I felt sorry for this bird, bo
cause it's tough enough to fight for your daily
bread and cup cakes if you have two legs, but
if you'll stuck with only one, you're not going
to get anything unless some guy rings you one
right around the beak with a doughnut. And
how many Stanford students throw away whole
doughnuts, much less that accurately?
I became intrigued by this bird, looking down
like a king on the rabble below struggling for its
daily pittance. The ordinary birds £brt of sprint
for a crumb, pick it up on the run, then gulp it
down before anyone else can take it from them.
They must really have indigestion problems.
This hand-to-cement-to-mouth feeding system is
n't the most leisurely. The sparrows are really
much quicker than the blackbirds, but they're
afraid of getting kicked in the shuffle or being
hit by falling crumbs.
Actually, latest psychological studies show
that these birds prefer ham and cheese sand
wiches, but if you haven't got the money for that
kind of handout they won't mind doughnuts. But
be sure not to dump down too large a crumb be
cause there is nothing that scares birds away

quicker than some big doughnut meteorite fly
ing down at them.
But getting back to my one-legged friend I
call him Gimp now. I tried all kinds of food to
get him to come down to me, but he would only
leave that ledge when all the other birds were
away. Finally I found that his weakness was
deep dish apple pie. Well, to make a long story
short, we've gotten to be great pals, Gimp and I.
It's a question of mutual need. I feed him deep
dish apple pie, and that solves his food problem.
Then I tell him my girls problem. Of course, he
doesn't solve them, but then can any girl prob
lem be solved?
Actually he has made suggestions at times and
he's told me a few things about ihe natural
rights of birds, about the great Declaration of
Dependence and their inalienable rights to life,
liberty and doughnuts. He's got lots of inside
information and tips. For instance, if you want
to get fi'iendly with a chick—you don't see too
many of that kind of bird around the Cellar of
course—feed it applesauce cup cakes.
Actually, he said he isn't a regular blackbird
at_all, but a Brewer's blackbird. I asked him if
that wasn't illegal in California, what with the
age limit and all, but he showed me his ID, so
I guess he's older than he looks. I'm not much
at telling blackbirds' ages anyhow.
He said it is lonely being a one-legged black
bird because he's an outcast and hungry at times.
It's made all the worse because his nest is up
in the corner of one of the ASSU offices, and
there isn't much food for thought or anything
else up there. He wanted me to keep this quiet
because he hasn't been too popular with the last
five or six ASSU presidents and is afraid he
might be evicted. I said he didn't have to worry,
because we reporters hadn't built up to good a
record on that score either.
Anyhow, we get together for a little talk every
morning around 10:30. He is usually perched on
the awning over the counter wailing for me.
If you'd like to meet him sometime and talk over
your girl problems, I'm sure I could arrange an
interview. He's pretty good on boy problems
too, because he's had some experience with ihe
women. How do you think he lost that leg?
But that's another story. Of course, you'd have
to have a personality interview; lie's pretty
choosy about his acquaintances. Oh, and be sure
to bring along some of that deep dish apple pie.
