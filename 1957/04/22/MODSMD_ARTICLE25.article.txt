# Leopold Five-Hits Bears; Cards Roll to 10-1 Victory
## Stanford Lefty Notches Second Win; Olsen, Shaw Homer to Pace Indians 
### Bob Payne 
"Humbled" is the best word to
describe what happened to Cali
fornia's hitherto mighty baseball
team Saturday as Stanford and
big Bob Leopold throttled the
Bears, 10-1. at Berkeley.
Leopold, who had thrown a no
hit lor against Southern California
a week earlier in his first CIBA
start, baffled the slugging Bears
by scattering five hits. lie struck
out four and walked only one,
showing none of the wildness
which is supposed to be charac
teristic of «left handers.
Tribe Bats Explode
While Leopold had complete
control of the situation when Cal
was at bat, the Cards blasted out
12 hits, including three doubles
and home runs by Parker Olsen
and A 1 Shaw. The Bears' ace,
Doug Weiss, gave up 10 of Ihe
hits and eight of the runs before
being relieved in Ihe ninth inning
by Charlie Berker.
Stanford drew first' blood in
the third inning with a pair of
unearned runs. Joel Newkirk was;
hit by a pitched ball, and Leopold!
followed with a'single.
Newkirk advanced to third and
Leopold to second on a wild throw
from the outfield, and after Shaw
had walked, Newkirk scored on
a boot by Cal second baseman
Roger CJregg. Leopold later scored
on a wild pitch by Weiss.
Outburst in Fourth
The game was wrapped up in
the fourth. Parker Olsen gave in
dication of the fireworks to come
when he promptly clobbered
first pitch of the frame
over the left field wall. Steve
Stewart then picked up an infield
single, Ralph Molding beat out a
bunt and Newkirk advanced them
on a sacrifice.
Stewart scored on Leopold's
sacrifice fly, and Holding came
home when Bobby Fletcher- slash
ed a double down the left field
line. Shaw capped off festivities
by belting the second round-trip
]>( r of the inning, scoring Fletcher
ahead of him.
Bear I Uprising
The Bears had their big upris
ing in the fifth when they scored
a r un on Leopold's lone walk and
an error.
Every Indian regular picked up
at least one safety, with Olsen,
Newkirk and Rudy Figueroa get
ling two. Fletcher, Figueroa and
Newkirk had doubles.
Cal entered the game with the
idea <• 112 "getting back" at Leopold
for matriculating at Stanford.
When the big southpaw left Stock
ton College the Bears figured he
would come to Berkeley.

But Leopold chose the Farm,
arrd now, after two conference
starts, he owns a no-hit, no-run
victory over USC and a very big
and easy win over California.
The Bears were bounced into
second place in the CIBA Friday
when UCLA's sophomore star,
Kirk Wilson, stopped them, 7-0.
This hoisted USC back into the
lead it had lost against Leopold.
This coming weekend Leopold
and Wilson may face each other
as the Cards travel to Los Angeles
for two games with the Bruins.
Tomorrow they warm up by tak
ing on College of Pacific on the
Sunken Diamond.

"Humbled" is the best word to
describe what happened to Cali
fornia's hitherto mighty baseball
team Saturday as Stanford and
big Bob Leopold throttled the
Bears, 10-1. at Berkeley.
Leopold, who had thrown a no
hit lor against Southern California
a week earlier in his first CIBA
start, baffled the slugging Bears
by scattering five hits. lie struck
out four and walked only one,
showing none of the wildness
which is supposed to be charac
teristic of «left handers.
Tribe Bats Explode
While Leopold had complete
control of the situation when Cal
was at bat, the Cards blasted out
12 hits, including three doubles
and home runs by Parker Olsen
and A 1 Shaw. The Bears' ace,
Doug Weiss, gave up 10 of Ihe
hits and eight of the runs before
being relieved in Ihe ninth inning
by Charlie Berker.
Stanford drew first' blood in
the third inning with a pair of
unearned runs. Joel Newkirk was;
hit by a pitched ball, and Leopold!
followed with a'single.
Newkirk advanced to third and
Leopold to second on a wild throw
from the outfield, and after Shaw
had walked, Newkirk scored on
a boot by Cal second baseman
Roger CJregg. Leopold later scored
on a wild pitch by Weiss.
Outburst in Fourth
The game was wrapped up in
the fourth. Parker Olsen gave in
dication of the fireworks to come
when he promptly clobbered
first pitch of the frame
over the left field wall. Steve
Stewart then picked up an infield
single, Ralph Molding beat out a
bunt and Newkirk advanced them
on a sacrifice.
Stewart scored on Leopold's
sacrifice fly, and Holding came
home when Bobby Fletcher- slash
ed a double down the left field
line. Shaw capped off festivities
by belting the second round-trip
]>( r of the inning, scoring Fletcher
ahead of him.
Bear I Uprising
The Bears had their big upris
ing in the fifth when they scored
a r un on Leopold's lone walk and
an error.
Every Indian regular picked up
at least one safety, with Olsen,
Newkirk and Rudy Figueroa get
ling two. Fletcher, Figueroa and
Newkirk had doubles.
Cal entered the game with the
idea <• 112 "getting back" at Leopold
for matriculating at Stanford.
When the big southpaw left Stock
ton College the Bears figured he
would come to Berkeley.

But Leopold chose the Farm,
arrd now, after two conference
starts, he owns a no-hit, no-run
victory over USC and a very big
and easy win over California.
The Bears were bounced into
second place in the CIBA Friday
when UCLA's sophomore star,
Kirk Wilson, stopped them, 7-0.
This hoisted USC back into the
lead it had lost against Leopold.
This coming weekend Leopold
and Wilson may face each other
as the Cards travel to Los Angeles
for two games with the Bruins.
Tomorrow they warm up by tak
ing on College of Pacific on the
Sunken Diamond.

"Humbled" is the best word to
describe what happened to Cali
fornia's hitherto mighty baseball
team Saturday as Stanford and
big Bob Leopold throttled the
Bears, 10-1. at Berkeley.
Leopold, who had thrown a no
hit lor against Southern California
a week earlier in his first CIBA
start, baffled the slugging Bears
by scattering five hits. lie struck
out four and walked only one,
showing none of the wildness
which is supposed to be charac
teristic of «left handers.
Tribe Bats Explode
While Leopold had complete
control of the situation when Cal
was at bat, the Cards blasted out
12 hits, including three doubles
and home runs by Parker Olsen
and A 1 Shaw. The Bears' ace,
Doug Weiss, gave up 10 of Ihe
hits and eight of the runs before
being relieved in Ihe ninth inning
by Charlie Berker.
Stanford drew first' blood in
the third inning with a pair of
unearned runs. Joel Newkirk was;
hit by a pitched ball, and Leopold!
followed with a'single.
Newkirk advanced to third and
Leopold to second on a wild throw
from the outfield, and after Shaw
had walked, Newkirk scored on
a boot by Cal second baseman
Roger CJregg. Leopold later scored
on a wild pitch by Weiss.
Outburst in Fourth
The game was wrapped up in
the fourth. Parker Olsen gave in
dication of the fireworks to come
when he promptly clobbered
first pitch of the frame
over the left field wall. Steve
Stewart then picked up an infield
single, Ralph Molding beat out a
bunt and Newkirk advanced them
on a sacrifice.
Stewart scored on Leopold's
sacrifice fly, and Holding came
home when Bobby Fletcher- slash
ed a double down the left field
line. Shaw capped off festivities
by belting the second round-trip
]>( r of the inning, scoring Fletcher
ahead of him.
