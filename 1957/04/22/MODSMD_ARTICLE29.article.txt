## 
### Steve Baffrey 
Stroking with a smooth and
constant 30, the Stanford crew
dammed the Oregon State Beav
ers in a 2000-meter race Saturday
in Redwood City Harbor. The
local freshman team dropped a
close race to the visiting OSC
l'rosh.
Good blade work and smooth
stroking were the key factors in
the Stanford win. The Beavers
had trouble trying to check the
Card varsity, and varied their
stroke from 32 to 34 in an attempt
to overtake them.
Varsity time for the race was
6:29.0, 10 seconds and two lengths
ahead of OSC's 6:39.0. The win
ran the Indians' season mark to
2-0, the earlier win coming at the
expense of USC.
