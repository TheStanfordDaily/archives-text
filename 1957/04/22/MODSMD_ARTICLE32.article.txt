## 
### 
The elements being willing,
Payton Jordan's Stanford track
team will meet IJC'LA today at
3:30 p.m. on the Bruins' West
wood oval.' The Indians' got an
extra-long Easter weekend lay
over in Los Angeles when rain
washed out the meet Saturday
afternoon.
What will happen if today's
engagement is also washed out
is not yet certain. What is cer
tain is that Stanford will he
hack home for Saturday's meet
against Occidental in Stanford
Stadium. This battle against a
team ranked as among the na
tion's strongest will be the last
home appearance of the Indian
spikers.
