# Presses Roll on Campus History As Quad Staff Completes Book
## May 25 Delivery Set for 1957 Book; Smead, Roemer to Hold Top Positions on '58 Edition 
### Barbara Hicks 
When 20,000 pounds of Stanford history arrives on campus at 9:30
a.m. May 25, 60 Quad staff members will eagerly survey the finished
product of many hours of labor.
The 1957 Quad is scheduled for distribution to students May 27 at
the Pavilion, Gary Willcuts, editor, said. He reported that 3800 Quads

have been ordered, and he antici
pates a sell-out.
Meanwhile the staff will begin
work on the 1958 issue. Mike
Roemer will head the staff as edi
tor, and Frank Smead will be
business manager. Roemer
moves up from copy editor, and
Smead was office manager this
year. They will select next year's
junior editors this spring.
As S t a n 112 or d students open
their lithographed resumes of the
1956-57 year, they will find 448
pages using more color than ever
before. The use of a pebbly-sur
faced paper instead of the glossy
page has sharpened the color
photos, Willcuts said. A red fab
ric cover binds the volume, and
the editor commented that the
1956 Quad could be placed inside
this cover.
To Salt Lake City
The cover is printed in Los An
geles, Willcuts said, and then
shipped to Salt Lake City. Utah,
where the pages are processed.
Problems of long-distance print
ing have been overcome by close
co-operation between the publish
ers, the Wheelwright Lithograph
Company, and the staff. Repre
sentatives of the company make
regular calls here, and the editor
goes to Salt Lake City, as guest
of the company, twice a year- to
check the progress. Wheelwright
sends both copy and page proofs
for checking names and faces.
Swallowed Quad
A spring beginning for the
yearbook is similar to the begin
ning of the 1906 Quad, but dif
ferent circumstances prevailed.
That year, the year of the big
earthquake, the editors were
working toward an April 20 dead
line. Two days the dead
line, the quake rocked the Penin
sula, "swallowing the Quad as
well as most of San Francisco,"
according to the preface of the
1906 book.
When the rubble was cleared
away, junior class members, then
sponsors of the yearbook, were
determined to have the presses
roll, and assessed themselves $2
each to finance the project. The
editors apologized for having an
incomplete book, but they were
faced with great obstacles.
Old Quads had few pictures,
but the present publication has a
photography staff which includes
eight photographers and five
darkroom workers. Trying a new
method this year, the staff used
35-mm. film for most pictures.
Head photographer Edwin Porter
explained that they could take
more pictures at the same cost,
thus having more scenes from
which to.choose for the book.
Student Photography
All photography except por
traits is student done. Keith
Cole's Studio does the portrait
work. This year a different pose
will be selected from the por
traits each time a person appears
in the book.
Junior editors who were re
sponsible for the inside of the
book this year were Anne Bal
lard, portraits: Gordon Packard,
sports; Bill Swenning, candids;
Sally Smead, mugs; and Dean
Forbes, darkroom manager. Man
aging editor, who assists the edi
tor in keeping records of prog
ress, was Peggy Knittle.
$40,000 Budget
Funds from organization pages
make up 15 per cent of the total
budget of $40,000. Advertising
sales bring in another 7 per cent,
and sales the remaining 78 per
cent. Ken Rose heads the busi
ness staff with four assistants.
Some 20 pages are devoted to ad
vertising.

the Pavilion, Gary Willcuts, editor, said. He reported that 3800 Quads

have been ordered, and he antici
pates a sell-out.
Meanwhile the staff will begin
work on the 1958 issue. Mike
Roemer will head the staff as edi
tor, and Frank Smead will be
business manager. Roemer
moves up from copy editor, and
Smead was office manager this
year. They will select next year's
junior editors this spring.
As S t a n 112 or d students open
their lithographed resumes of the
1956-57 year, they will find 448
pages using more color than ever
before. The use of a pebbly-sur
faced paper instead of the glossy
page has sharpened the color
photos, Willcuts said. A red fab
ric cover binds the volume, and
the editor commented that the
1956 Quad could be placed inside
this cover.
To Salt Lake City
The cover is printed in Los An
geles, Willcuts said, and then
shipped to Salt Lake City. Utah,
where the pages are processed.
Problems of long-distance print
ing have been overcome by close
co-operation between the publish
ers, the Wheelwright Lithograph
Company, and the staff. Repre
sentatives of the company make
regular calls here, and the editor
goes to Salt Lake City, as guest
of the company, twice a year- to
check the progress. Wheelwright
sends both copy and page proofs
for checking names and faces.
Swallowed Quad
A spring beginning for the
yearbook is similar to the begin
ning of the 1906 Quad, but dif
ferent circumstances prevailed.
That year, the year of the big
earthquake, the editors were
working toward an April 20 dead
line. Two days the dead
line, the quake rocked the Penin
sula, "swallowing the Quad as
well as most of San Francisco,"
according to the preface of the
1906 book.
When the rubble was cleared
away, junior class members, then
sponsors of the yearbook, were
determined to have the presses
roll, and assessed themselves $2
each to finance the project. The
editors apologized for having an
incomplete book, but they were
faced with great obstacles.
Old Quads had few pictures,
but the present publication has a
photography staff which includes
eight photographers and five
darkroom workers. Trying a new
method this year, the staff used
35-mm. film for most pictures.
Head photographer Edwin Porter
explained that they could take
more pictures at the same cost,
thus having more scenes from
which to.choose for the book.
Student Photography
All photography except por
traits is student done. Keith
Cole's Studio does the portrait
work. This year a different pose
will be selected from the por
traits each time a person appears
in the book.
Junior editors who were re
sponsible for the inside of the
book this year were Anne Bal
lard, portraits: Gordon Packard,
sports; Bill Swenning, candids;
Sally Smead, mugs; and Dean
Forbes, darkroom manager. Man
aging editor, who assists the edi
tor in keeping records of prog
ress, was Peggy Knittle.
$40,000 Budget
Funds from organization pages
make up 15 per cent of the total
budget of $40,000. Advertising
sales bring in another 7 per cent,
and sales the remaining 78 per
cent. Ken Rose heads the busi
ness staff with four assistants.
Some 20 pages are devoted to ad
vertising.
When 20,000 pounds of Stanford history arrives on campus at 9:30
a.m. May 25, 60 Quad staff members will eagerly survey the finished
product of many hours of labor.
The 1957 Quad is scheduled for distribution to students May 27 at
the Pavilion, Gary Willcuts, editor, said. He reported that 3800 Quads

have been ordered, and he antici
