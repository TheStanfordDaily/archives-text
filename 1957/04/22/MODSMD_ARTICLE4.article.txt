# Beck Probe Is Justified By Reuther
## Leader Claims Union Constitutionally Right In Indicting Teamster 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 21 (UP)
AFL-CIO vice-president Walter
Iteuther said today the AFLCIO
has "very sound and firm consti
tutional grounds" for bringing
corruption charges against team
ster president Dave Beck and the
big Teamsters Union itself.
Rout her, who is also president
of the United Auto Workers, re
jected Beck's argument that the
AFLCIO Executive Council does
not have the authority to suspend
him and to order both him and his
union to stand trial before the
parent union's Ethical Practices
Committee.
Reuther said the council acted
in accordance with the procedures
laid down by the AFL-CIO consti
tution.
Rackets Committee
Beck and other union officials
recently were the targets of cor
ruption charges made by witness
es before the Senate Labor Rack
ets Committee.
The AFL-CIO Executive Coun
cil subsequently ordered teamster
officials to appear before the Eth
ical Practices Committee May 6
and answer the accusation that
the union is under corrupt domi
nation.
Beck Unfit
Reuther, an old foe of Beck's,
said the teamster president's tele
vision admission that he borrowed
some $300,000 of teamster funds
for personal use "makes him unfit
to hold a position of leadership in
the labor movement."
"The AFL-CIO will not compro
mise with corruption," he said.
Reuther said the AFL-CIO
ought to give the "decent ele
ments" in the Teamsters Union a
chance to clean up their union.
If that failed, he said, then the
parent organization should expel
the entire union.
He said that, in such an eventu
ality, the AFL-CIO should organ
ize a rival union to embrace non
corrupt rank and file members of
the teamsters.
