HOW MUCH FS THAT DOGFISH
IN THE WINDOW?
Dear Mom and Dad (writes Zelda May Nirdlinger, soph).
You have been asking me to account for all the money
I spend. There follows a day by day summary of recent
expenditures. Don't forget, you asked for it.
MONDAY:
$2.78 — telegram to the Secretary of the Army, offering
to go instead of Elvis.
$0.26 — pack of Philip Morris, my favorite, and yours,
if you know a good thing when you taste one!
$0.50 — sorority fine for oversleeping and missing my
first hour class twelve days in a row.

$2.95 — I bought a rooster named Ralph to wake me in
the morning'. (Can't sleep with an alarm clock
ticking all night.)
TUESDAY:
$0.50 — sorority fine for not cleaning my plate at dinner.
(I just couldn't! Dinner was Ralph.)
$0.50 — sorority fine for dating undesirable boy. (Rod
erigo is not undesirable! Some people say he is
"fast" and a "devil" but I say he is just insecure.
Why else would he go steady with eight girls?)
$0.2(5 —pack of Philip Morris. What joy! What zest!
WEDNESDAY:
$557.38 — a motorcycle for Roderigo. (He is giving up all
his other girls for me, but they are so widely
scattered that he needs a fast convcyance to go
around and tell them all goodbye.)
$0.20 — pack of Philip Morris. (Have you tried them
yet? If not, you've got a big treat coming. Light
one soon. Light cither end.)
THURSDAY:
$0.50 — sorority fine for staying too long in the shower.
(Gee whiz, a girl gets mighty dirty polishing a
motorcycle!)
$0.52 - two packs of Philip Morris —one for Roderigo.
(Dear Roderigo!)
FRIDAY:
$0.20 — pack of Philip Morris —a happy smoke for a
happy day. Yesterday Roderigo broke with the
last of his girls, and today he is mine, all mine!
$8.57 — new dogfish for zoology. (I was* dissecting a
dogfish in zoology when I happened to look out the
window and see Roderigo riding by with Mary
Ann Reasley on his buddy seat. I got so upset I
threw the dogfish at them.)
SATURDAY:
$2.50 — a carton of Philip Morris, one pack for me, the
rest for Roderigo. (I was foolish to be angry about
Mary Ann. Roderigo explained that she meant
nothing to him—just helping him with English lit.
Similarly, Grace Krovney is helping him with
Spanish, Betsy Pike with econ, Mazda Notkin with
psych, Lola Tweet with phys ed, etc. The least he
can do is give them all Philip Morrises.)
Well, mom and dad, you can see how expensive college is.
Send money.... Love and kisses, Zelda May
