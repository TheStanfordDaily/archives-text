# Kerensky Says Not All Accept Soviet Ideology
## 
### 
Alexander Kerensky made one
of his infrequent public appear
ances Friday in Cubberley before
professor W. S. Vucinich's Euro
pean history class.
Kerensky, head of the second
provisional government following
the February Russian revolution,
is on campus writing an analysis
of the Russian provisional gov
ernment in cooperation with Hoo
ver War Memorial Library.
In response to the question
"Could you have kept your pro
visional government in power by
withdrawing from World War I?"
he said that such a move would
have resulted in the complete dis
integration of the army and left
Russia defenseless; civil war
would have been sure to follow.
He went on: "What these peo
ple [the Communists] have done
is against the right of every man
to be free . . . this they have de
stroyed, and, I ask you, for what
aim?
"You young people here, you
can't understand what it means
to be free . . . you have always
been free. For it is like trying to
imagine living without air."
Even in Russia today, continued
Kerensky, there are those who do
not accept the aims of the Com
munists.
He said, "In people your age,
or a little older, there is this feel
ing that arose because of the
second [world] war . . ." The
Communists, he said ironically,
had to inspire the people with pa
triotic fervor If) win the war, and
this was causing people to think
for themselves.
Last year students at one uni
versity had a meeting attended by
thousands at which questions
were asked that had never been
asked before, Kerensky concluded.
