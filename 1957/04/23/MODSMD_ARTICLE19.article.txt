# Toward Improving Food
## 
### 
Tiirougiioi:t America Sunday evening, men,
women and children sat down iri happy spirits
to feasts prepared lor the joyous Kaster
holiday.
I hal is, everywhere except in Stern Hall.
Already notorious for the great amount of
ill-prepared, scarcely palatable dishes served
to Stern residents, Stern Dining Hull had what
must be construed only as "audacity" to serve
a meal that could not even measure up to prior
standards of Sunday evening meals. And last
Sunday was Easter.
The main dish consisted of the thinnest pos
ihle slice of ham, two small lumps of sweet
potatoes and four asparagus tips. It was pre
ceded by an innocuous-locking fruit salad of
extremely small dimensions and was followed
bv a small piece of cake—artfully decorated,
wv must admit, with two gumdrops repre
senting eggs.
Stern food is not consistently bad food.
Dielcticallx speaking, it is probably of good
caliber. Hut the quality of both food and
preparation leaves much to he desired.
\ esterday's lunch, for instance, included chili
con carne with beans. The beans were there,
as was also a small amount of carne. But the
cook had apparently forgotten to put in the
chili powder because, unless our taste buds
have been ruined bv the Stern food, we must
I tily to the fad that the chili con carne was
void of chili.
But to «. r o (in further in this vein about the
state of a (fairs with respect to Stern Hall food
would be pointless indeed. Stern Dining Hall
i not the only offender it's just the worst.

The problem definitely exists in other Univer
sity dining halls.
Many complaints have been'made to the
directors of individual dining halls. These
complaints have usually been received cour
teously by the directors, who have earnestly
tried to correct most of the glaring deficiencies.
But, more often, complainers have been re
ferred to others—to the offices of the deans,
or to the head dining hall director, Uhristine
Bicker.
Very few students like to go to the adminis
tration with problems such as these. They feel
they have a gripe- hot the administration is,
they think, concerned with the problems of
the mind, not the stomach, and they hate to
take these problems to the administration.
We believe the problem of food in the Uni
versity dining halls stems from a very great
lack of pressure put on those responsible for
the quality, quantity and variety of foods pre
pared for student consumption. We believe
that an organized student pressure group —an
official voice of the student body, preferably—
should he utilized as machinery whereby stu
dents may voice their gripes to the responsible
administrative agency.
We sincerely hope that ASSU Legislature
will look into the problem of adequate ma
chinery for students' complaints in this area.
We realize that Legislature is not the legitimate
area for a student investigation. But if the
moral voice of the student body can be brought
to hear on the administration, they, in turn,
will be more apt to institute their own investi
gations and attempt to solve the problems of
poor Universiu food.

But to «. r o (in further in this vein about the
state of a (fairs with respect to Stern Hall food
would be pointless indeed. Stern Dining Hall
i not the only offender it's just the worst.

The problem definitely exists in other Univer
sity dining halls.
Many complaints have been'made to the
directors of individual dining halls. These
complaints have usually been received cour
teously by the directors, who have earnestly
tried to correct most of the glaring deficiencies.
But, more often, complainers have been re
ferred to others—to the offices of the deans,
or to the head dining hall director, Uhristine
Bicker.
Very few students like to go to the adminis
tration with problems such as these. They feel
they have a gripe- hot the administration is,
they think, concerned with the problems of
the mind, not the stomach, and they hate to
take these problems to the administration.
We believe the problem of food in the Uni
versity dining halls stems from a very great
lack of pressure put on those responsible for
the quality, quantity and variety of foods pre
pared for student consumption. We believe
that an organized student pressure group —an
official voice of the student body, preferably—
should he utilized as machinery whereby stu
dents may voice their gripes to the responsible
administrative agency.
We sincerely hope that ASSU Legislature
will look into the problem of adequate ma
chinery for students' complaints in this area.
We realize that Legislature is not the legitimate
area for a student investigation. But if the
moral voice of the student body can be brought
to hear on the administration, they, in turn,
will be more apt to institute their own investi
gations and attempt to solve the problems of
poor Universiu food.
Tiirougiioi:t America Sunday evening, men,
women and children sat down iri happy spirits
to feasts prepared lor the joyous Kaster
holiday.
I hal is, everywhere except in Stern Hall.
Already notorious for the great amount of
ill-prepared, scarcely palatable dishes served
to Stern residents, Stern Dining Hull had what
must be construed only as "audacity" to serve
a meal that could not even measure up to prior
standards of Sunday evening meals. And last
Sunday was Easter.
The main dish consisted of the thinnest pos
ihle slice of ham, two small lumps of sweet
potatoes and four asparagus tips. It was pre
ceded by an innocuous-locking fruit salad of
extremely small dimensions and was followed
bv a small piece of cake—artfully decorated,
wv must admit, with two gumdrops repre
senting eggs.
Stern food is not consistently bad food.
Dielcticallx speaking, it is probably of good
caliber. Hut the quality of both food and
preparation leaves much to he desired.
\ esterday's lunch, for instance, included chili
con carne with beans. The beans were there,
as was also a small amount of carne. But the
cook had apparently forgotten to put in the
chili powder because, unless our taste buds
have been ruined bv the Stern food, we must
I tily to the fad that the chili con carne was
void of chili.
