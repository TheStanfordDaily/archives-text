NEW YORK, April 22 (UP) -
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles warned.Russia (belay that
threats against America's allies
"will not disintegrate the free
world" or permit it to become
weak and divided.
In his first major policy address
since the British-Frcnch-Israeli

invasion of Egypt, Dulles said "in
firmities within" the free world
alliance posed a greater danger
than "assaults from without."
But he said that "happily" the
free world's collective defense sys
tem had "a high degree of volun
tary cooperation and agreement,"
and that, although I he defense ar
rangements were not ideal, the re
lationship among free nations was
predominantly one of good will
and trust. Arid, he added, the
arrangements would continue.
Clash Unnecessary
Dulles rejected the idea that the
free world and international Com
munism ultimately must clash in
an all-out war. But, he said, "we
must also exert ourselves to the
full to prevent it."
Dulles' speech at the Associated
Press annual lunch held in con
nection with the annual Ameri
can "Newspaper Publishers Asso
ciation meeting was billed by I he
White House as a major foreign
policy pronouncement and was
written in close cooperation with
President Eisenhower. It was the
secretary's first major speech
since last Oct. 27.
Dulles said the purpose of his
speech, which was carried to the
nation by radio and television,
was to outline for "both friend
and foe" the basic foreign policy
concepts by which the United
States charted its course."
Captive Nations
These principles, he said, in
clude firm opposition to violent
aggression, freedom for captive
nations, help to new nations, dedi
cation to the United Nations char
ter and to the cause of peace,
justice and liberty.
He criticized "some who, in a
zeal to economize, would slash
that part of our [national] budget
which is often miscalled 'foreign
aid'—as though it did not aid us."
"That would not be economy
but extravagance," he said.
"If the forces and facilities
which others provide were sub
tracted from the common defense,
(he United States defense budget

would have to tie expanded vastly
from what il now is."
Dulles said the United States
now has collective defense trea
ties with 42 nations, "and the area
of common defense may now be
enlarged pursuant to the recent
Middle East resolution"—the Eis
enhower Doctrine.
