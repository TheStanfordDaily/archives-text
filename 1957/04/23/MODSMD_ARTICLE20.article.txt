## Housing Suggestions 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
If Hi' 1 majority of freshmen want to live in
J .a"unit;i next year and I ho majority of girls who
draw into Moore enjoy or can put up with a
double room, why must Mie system he fixed so
Ihat a minority of us are unhappy? I looked
forward as a freshman to meeting and living
with more upper classmbn. As a sophomore in
i igunita last year I wasn't disappointed; I made
many ejose friends, especially in the present sen
ior class. Several of these friends I would have
met. in other connections since they are in or
ionizations which I belong to, but I would never
have seen enough of them to call them close
friends.
' 'erhaps Union could be ihe refuge of people
who want a mixture of all classes and/or single
rooms, if we could be assured lhaf sooner or
Inter, this year or the next, freshmen would take
over the space there. Or, barring this possibility,
i erhaps two or three Row houses could model
themselves on the old Union units. By this, I
don't refer to the dining room arrangements, but
to tho fact that several of the union units had a
tradition of being full of studious, interesting

people, and were so because Ihe houses 1 hem
selves had few rules and little group pressure
designed to make people participate in house
activities.
Perhaps I have the wrong impression of life
in a Row house. If so, perhaps they could adver
tise the fact that people like my friends and
myself would enjoy living there.
