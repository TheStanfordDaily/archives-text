Editor, The Daily:
In reply to the article in the paper Friday from
the girls at Paloma in regard to the Delt sere
nade, we of Mirlo House, which is located even
nearer to "the house across the street from Pa
loma," feel that any comment you petty females
have 1o make about harmless fraternity fun is
not even valid or worthy of print. We have
found "the house across the street" a very pleas
ant and entertaining neighbor. We hope in the
future you can find construc
tive to do than sit in your liltle glass dorm and
throw barbs.
