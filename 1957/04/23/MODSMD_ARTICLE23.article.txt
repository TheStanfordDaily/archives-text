# ON OTHER CAMPUSES-By Dave Canfield
## Zany Newspaper Writers in Oilier Colleges 
### 
Do you think The Daily's writers are a bunch
of psychos? Do you choke into your orange
juice over every Daily article you read?
Well, choke again, for certain writers on other
campuses are even zanier. If you doubt that,
witness the following items:
Wilting in the Furman College Hornet, Jerry
Davis has proposed the founding of a "Charley
Wilson fan club."
Davis recently called the Secretary of Defense
"brutally frank" and "therefore one of the finest
things to happen to politics on a national level
in a long time. His color, his candor, his ability
to say the wrong things at the wrong time . . .
make him one of the most interesting people in
the world."
Davis goes on to blast persons who complain
privately all the time but publicly will never say
what they really think.

Writing of a smaller-scale political scene was
University of Washington Daily columnist Guy
Farmer, who said, "You too can bo ASUW
prexy."
"The Daily," said Farmer, "has invented a
wild new party game. It's called 'Running for
Office'."
Farmer, in his exhaustive study, has told UW
hopefuls not, only what 1o promise students to
get elected but what promises to carry out if
elected.
"Lot the sky be the limit," ho said of the can
didate's platform. "Come out for a pub in the
HUB [the equivalent of the Stanford Union | and
for multiple marriage. Support Nasser and Ted

dy Nalder and Wostbrook Peg lor. Make a name
for yourself.
"If you take our helpful hints and are elected,"
Farmer added, "do us a favor turn the •econd
and third floors of the 11LJH into a gymnasium
Oil yes, and please decorate it with rod tape.
There's a surplus on hand."

Residents of Stern llall, Stanford Village and
other campus "resorts," cheer up! Dorms are
bad all over, according to a recent Dakota Stu
dent feature article, which said in part:
"You say your room is cold, hut the radiator
pounds all night anyway? You say your bed's
too short and your feet hang out the end and
you're a freshman rooming with a G.I. who
gazes at you like a hungry cat near* Ihe middle
of the month and you're thinking of taking a
course in psychology because his torrid tales
have caused insomnia?
"Don't tool bad, dad, things could bo worse.
You could bo living in the ugsom, but happy
hovel . . . Princeton Hall."
'1 he article went on to say that this University
of North Dakota dormitory includes such lea
lures as a long, dark hallway that "gives one the
feeling of being part of a Hitchcock production,"
food that necessitates eating an occasional meal
out—at. the "Grand Forks (N. Dak.) Mission,"
and "veterans fighting over discarded cigarets."
The Princeton Hall tableau, Dakota Student
added, also spotlights such scenes as "a hodge
podge of excitement when the word is passed
'Sgt. Bilko is on' " and "students standing over
a worn-out cigaret machine 'working their way
through college'."
