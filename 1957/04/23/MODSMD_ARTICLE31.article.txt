With thousands of brawny athletes trudging through spring foot
ball practice in the nation's colleges, the honor of incurring the first
injury of the 1957 season goes to a woman.
In the Greek Week women's football competition at the Univer
sity of Oregon, Miss Carrie Heilbronner suffered a broken ankle and
wound up in the campus infirmary.
Northern schools are predicted to have powerful 1957 squads.
Oregon has back virtually its entire backfield of 1956, which was
rated as one of the fastest c«i the coast. Returning are lettermen
Jack Crablree, Jim Shariley, Jack Morris and Leroy Phelps.
And in Seattle, new Washington coach Jim Owens has in Al
Ferguson the probable successor to John Brodie as the best signal
caller in the West. Owens, in an interview with the University of
Washington Daily, has said, "We're going to stress defense on this
team. Not to the point where it will take the place of offense, but
we are going to work on it."
However, Owens is lacking depth on an otherwise fine team, hav
inj', an average of only one experienced player at each position.
Meanwhile, in Westwood, the Daily Bruin reported recently:
"It was an over-confident Bruin cricket team which took the
field against Pasadena last Sunday [April 14]. The UCLA eleven,
Unshed with last week's success over Sail Diego, had a similar fate
planned for their Pasadena neighbours [sic]."
However, cricket fans all over America will be glad to learn the
Bruins preserved the honor of U.S. colleges with a late upsurge that
lied the match.
As for major league baseball, Tom Chapman, assistant sports edi
lor of the University of Oregon Daily Emerald, offers these predic
tions for pennant race:
"May Las Vegas, Nevada, acquires the franchise of the Chicago
Cubs, paying $28 million and 296 slot machines.
"June —. . . Mickey Mantle hits his fourth home run of the
season, and N.Y. writers claim he is hoping for more singles and
a higher batting average Inly—Sal Maglie is banished from
baseball for throwing a spit ball at Warren Giles.
". . . September —The National League goes down to the final
day with Brooklyn heating Cincinnati for the title lackie
Itobinson, behind his desk at a candy-bar company, says, "Th*
Braves blew it with too many parties, but they'll he tough next
year.' The Yanks win the American League by 47 games. . . .
". . . Larsen hurls a perfect game . . . then goes home to tend
bar. ... As an after climax, the Dodgers beat the Yanks four
straight in the Series, with two of the tilts played in Corvallis,
but hot in Gill Coliseum."
Here's our vote to Chapman for making the predictions we'd most
like to see come true.
When UCLA upset California in baseball last weekend, it was
the Bruins' first win in eight games. The seventh straight loss
came last Wednesday to "powerful" Long Beach State College, 9-8.
However, the Uclan has one talented pitcher in Kirk Wilson, whose
earned run average is- almost as good as his punting average was
last fall.
Stanford plays Wilson and Co. this weekend in a Friday-Saturday
double in Los Angeles.
In the Occidental track meet here Saturday, the Indians will be
facing some of the nation's top tracksters, among whom are 4:12.1
miler Ty Hadley, 9.8 century man Rudy Alston and Bon Gutowski.
USC meet April 6 saw Gutowski set a new NCAA record with a
vault of 15-4. The Trojans won, 70-^-65
The Senate may be the upper house politically but in the upcom
ing basketball game between the University of Santa Clara Senate
and House of Representatives, the lower house should be Ihe upper
one athletically. It seems that several of the proxies in the House
arc varsity eagers.
How about a Daily-Legislature baseball game . . . ?
