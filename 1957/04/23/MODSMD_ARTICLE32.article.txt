# Papooses After Fourth Spike Win Of Season Today
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh trackmen aim
tfÂ» gel back on the winning trail
this afternoon at 3:30 in Stanford
Sl;idium when they meet San
Jose JC and Menlo College in a
triangular meet.
Floyd Strain's elub opened its
season with three straight victo
ries, bill then dropped two in a
row to Modesto JC and Mt. San
Antonio College.
The Papooses should have little
trouble winning today, however,
since neither Mo/ilo nor San Jose
has compiled anything resem
bling an outstanding rccord.
Strain said he will probably
limit Bobby Monzingo to just the
mile instead of doubling him in
Ihe mile and two-mile. Another
possible change might see Dick
Lassen running the 440. Else
where. the Papooses will go with
generally the same entry list they
have used all season.
The meet will be Stanford's
first of two this week. Saturday,
Ihe Papooses will host Oakland
JC and Stockton JC, a pair of
moderately strong Northern Cali
fornia teams.
Both of this week's meets will
be used in part as a preparation
for May 4's Little Big Meet with
California. That battle will be
waged concurrently with the var
sity meet at Berkeley.
