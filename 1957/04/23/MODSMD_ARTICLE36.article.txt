# Bruins Humble Indian Trackmen
## Seaman, Johnson, Ellis Lead UCLA To Easy Victory 
### Dick Barnes 
UCLA came through in practi
cally every event arnl Stanford
fell down in most as the Bruins
cruised to an easy 84-46 Ms rout
of the Indians in what had been
tabbed as a down-tot he-wire meet.
The event was held yesterday at
West wood after being postponed
by rain Saturday.
Bob Seaman, Russ Ellis and
Rafer Johnson led the Bruins'
devastating attack in the running
events as UCLA won every flat
race except the two-mile.
Only in the eight-lapper did
Stanford have anything to brag
about. There Maury Graves won
in 9:15.4, his best time of the year
and a new Stanford school record.
Hand-'n'-Hand
Seaman had a hand in three
victories for Ducky Drake's thin
clads. He won the 880 in meet
record time of 1:52.4, ran a leg
on the winning relay team and
had a share in a triple dead-heat
for first in the mile.
In that race three Bruins—Sea
man, his brother John and Dick
Rodrigtiez — held hands as they
loafed across the finish in the
mediocre time of 4:19.9.
Ellis ran to narrow victories in
both the 220 and 440. In the short
er race he held off Stanford's
Frank Herrmann in the closing
stride. Both runners posted times
of 21.7.
Slow Quarter
Ellis' triumph in the 440 was in
the slow time of 49.4, but was still
two-tenths faster than the Tribe's
Don Chesarek ran in taking
second.
Herrmann lost the 100 in much
the same fashion as he lost the
furlong. In the century Johnson
showed definite signs of tiring at
the end, but still held on for a
narrow win in 10.0. Herrmann
was clocked in Ihe same time.
Only in the broad jump could
Herrmann win for the Tribe; he
leaped 24-1. UCLA's Dick Knaub
broke up an expected Stanford
sweep as he grabbed second.
Cobh Hits Hurdles
Another Stanford favorite who
did not win was hurdler Chuck
Cobb. He hit several barriers in
the 120 highs as UCLA's Ken
Thompson sped to victory in 14.5.
Cobb returned to win the lows
in 23.4.
A double winner in the field
events for Ihe Bruins was weight
man Don Vick. He upset Fred
Peters in the discus and Ihen led
a 1-2-3 sweep in Ihe shot-put for
UCLA.
Hank Roldan came through to
win the javelin for the Tribe at
222-8, but Stanford could get no
other places in the event. UCLA
also placed one-two in the pole
vault.
The final come-through for Ihe
Uclans was in the high jump,
where sophomore Walt Torrence
tied the Indians' Phil Fehlen
at 6-7.
