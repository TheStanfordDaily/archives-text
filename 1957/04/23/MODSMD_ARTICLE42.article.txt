# 'DEAR WALLY'
## Omnipresent Warren Wonka Turns Up in Sterling's Files 
### Rich Brown 
A decade ago Kilroy was everywhere.
Since 1948, however, a new character—Warren G. Wonka—has
made his appearance everywhere from a royal reception for a king
and queen in Athens, Greece, to an auto accident at Klamath Falls,
Ore.
The mythical Stanfod personality's latest visit (or at least his

latest discovered visit) was to the
home of none other than Presi
dent J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Recently Stanford's chief exec
utive was sorting through some
of his papers when he came upon
one with a date of May 26, 1951.
The return address read, "222
Divine, Hadacol, Mississippi."
Trying to recall when he had
read the letter, Sterling glanced
a second time and read the con
tents:
"Dear Wally:
"Just wanted to prove it could
still be done. We were careful
not to harm or disturb anything
(better watch those diplomas).
Enclosed find one used paint
brush. We missed you in church.
"Reverently yours,
"Warren G. Wonka"
Mystery Remains
Whether the famous Watson
ville Traveler, as he is also
known, made a personal appear
ance in Sterling's house or just
slipped (he letter among Ster
ling's papers somewhere else will
probably always remain a mys
tery.
The used paint brush, inciden
tally, was not found.
Wonka was born full-grown in
a 1948 Chaparral as a bra sales
man. The name caught on as a
Chappie monicker whenever a
false name was needed, and was
soon adopted by the campus for
the same purpose.
One of the most famous Wonka
incidents occurred in May, 1952,
when Estes Kefauver was tour
ing California in hopes of secur
ing the Democratic Presidential
nomination. A Farm student con
tributed to the campaign fund in
Wonka's name.
Estes Grateful
Some time later, a letter ad
dressed to Warren G. Wonka Jr.,
Toyon Hall, and signed "Estes
Kefauver," thanked Mr. Wonka:
"1 just wanted to tell you how
much I appreciate all you are do
ing for me out there. I surely
did enjoy my visit and I'll be in
California again very soon. I
hope to see you and thank you
personally for your assistance."
A Chappie staff member, us
ing Wonka's name, once filled out
a blue card for a Western Civ
class and took the mid-term and
final. All went well until the Uni
versity couldn't find a transcript
on which to record the "B minus"
grade.
As early as 1918 Wonka had
registered for the draft, and in
1950 only the sharp eyes of a
proofreader kept Warren's name
off the commencement program.
Wonka "narrowly escaped seri
ous injury," the Associated Press
reported Oct. 26, 1951, "in an auto
accident near Klamath Falls,
Ore."

Seems that a car with six Stan
ford Band members, going to the
University of Washington game,

When police took the names of
those in the accident, one student
didn't want to worry his parents,
so guess whose name he gave.
Since that one student listed
his home town as Watsonville,
Calif., the Watsonville Register-
Pajaronian ran the story on page
one.
In Greece, the Athens News
Ihree years ago ran a list of
VlP's attending a royal party. At
the bottom of the list, which in
cluded ambassadors and military
brass, was—Mr. Warren G. Won
ka.
Wonka has been a write-in can
didate' at many ASSU elections
and has been included among the
Immortal 21 who recaptured the
Stanford Axe in 1930. He even
wrote a letter which was pub
lished to the editor of Collier's
Magazine.
All that is needed now is a Mrs.
Wonka. Perhaps one of these
days she will turn up at a tea
given by Mrs. Sterling!

The return address read, "222
Divine, Hadacol, Mississippi."
Trying to recall when he had
read the letter, Sterling glanced
a second time and read the con
tents:
"Dear Wally:
"Just wanted to prove it could
still be done. We were careful
not to harm or disturb anything
(better watch those diplomas).
Enclosed find one used paint
brush. We missed you in church.
"Reverently yours,
"Warren G. Wonka"
Mystery Remains
Whether the famous Watson
ville Traveler, as he is also
known, made a personal appear
ance in Sterling's house or just
slipped (he letter among Ster
ling's papers somewhere else will
probably always remain a mys
tery.
The used paint brush, inciden
tally, was not found.
Wonka was born full-grown in
a 1948 Chaparral as a bra sales
man. The name caught on as a
Chappie monicker whenever a
false name was needed, and was
soon adopted by the campus for
the same purpose.
One of the most famous Wonka
incidents occurred in May, 1952,
when Estes Kefauver was tour
ing California in hopes of secur
ing the Democratic Presidential
nomination. A Farm student con
tributed to the campaign fund in
Wonka's name.
Estes Grateful
Some time later, a letter ad
dressed to Warren G. Wonka Jr.,
Toyon Hall, and signed "Estes
Kefauver," thanked Mr. Wonka:
"1 just wanted to tell you how
much I appreciate all you are do
ing for me out there. I surely
did enjoy my visit and I'll be in
California again very soon. I
hope to see you and thank you
personally for your assistance."
A Chappie staff member, us
ing Wonka's name, once filled out
a blue card for a Western Civ
class and took the mid-term and
final. All went well until the Uni
versity couldn't find a transcript
on which to record the "B minus"
grade.
As early as 1918 Wonka had
registered for the draft, and in
1950 only the sharp eyes of a
proofreader kept Warren's name
off the commencement program.
Wonka "narrowly escaped seri
ous injury," the Associated Press
reported Oct. 26, 1951, "in an auto
accident near Klamath Falls,
Ore."
Off Embankment
Seems that a car with six Stan
ford Band members, going to the
University of Washington game,
s k idd e d off an embankment.
When police took the names of
those in the accident, one student
didn't want to worry his parents,
so guess whose name he gave.
Since that one student listed
his home town as Watsonville,
Calif., the Watsonville Register-
Pajaronian ran the story on page
one.
In Greece, the Athens News
Ihree years ago ran a list of
VlP's attending a royal party. At
the bottom of the list, which in
cluded ambassadors and military
brass, was—Mr. Warren G. Won
ka.
Wonka has been a write-in can
didate' at many ASSU elections
and has been included among the
Immortal 21 who recaptured the
Stanford Axe in 1930. He even
wrote a letter which was pub
lished to the editor of Collier's
Magazine.
All that is needed now is a Mrs.
Wonka. Perhaps one of these
days she will turn up at a tea
given by Mrs. Sterling!
