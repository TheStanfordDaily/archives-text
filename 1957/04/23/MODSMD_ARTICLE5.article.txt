BEIRUT. Lebanon, April 22
(UP) The Jordanian crisis'
worsened today under rising in
ternal dissension and increased
outside pressure from Syria and
Egypt. A new showdown be
tween King Hussein and leftists
appeared imminent.
Leftists meeiing in Ihe west

dismissal of the present moder
ate government and reinstate
ment of the ousted left-wing re
gime. They also demanded rejec
tion of the Eisenhower Doctrine.
Demonstrations described as
peaceful occured in both Nabuls
and Jerusalem.
Confers by Phone
King Hussein conferred by
phone with his ally, King Saud
of Saudi Arabia, for an hour as
the situation became more dan
gerous.
Strict censorship hid details of
the struggle between the 22-year
old king who favors the West
and opposing Palestinian ele
ments who are pro-Soviet and de
mand allegiance to the anti-West
ern policies of Egypt and Syria.
The Egyptian semi-official Mid
east News Agency (M.E.N.A.) re
ported troops from Iraq, which
supports Hussein, had rolled into
the country and taken up posi
tions at Hafraq, 45 miles north
east of Hussein's capital at Am
man. Matraq is near the Syrian
border. Iraq formally denied the
report. ,
Predicts Fall
The Syrian press predicted the
moderate Jordanian government
of Premier Hussein Khali d i
would fall within 48 hours.
M.E.N.A. said that "informed
sources expect a highly impor
tant new stage in the internal
battle in Jordan within 24 hours."
Both the news agency and the
Cairo press reported a series of
anti - Western and pro - Egyptian
demonstrations in Jordan yester
day.
