between Bulganin and the then
Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden
on the eve of the Anglo-French

cles" in London advocated armed
intervention in Egypt.
The first letter from Bulganin
was dated Sept? It. It dealt with

of the Suez Canal.
Bulganin s a i d he understood
"certain circles" in Britain were
urging armed intervention in
Egypt. "Bui the Soviet govern
ment cannot stand aside over this
question," he added. "We wish to
warn you in a friendly way as to
the dangers which may follow if
the necessary prudence is not
shown.
"Should this happen, all Ihe
Arab people will arise in the sa
cred struggle against the foreign
invasion," Bulganin said in his
initial letter.
"This means that the material
loss, particularly to Britain and
France—and for that matter to
the whole of Europe—would as

Near and Middle East would be
come disrupted."

Egypt nor Algeria can be subju
gated," the letter said.
Contains Errors
Eden replied to this letter on
Sept. 16 by saying, "Your letter
seems to be based on a complete
misunderstanding of the position
of the government and even to
contain certain errors of fact.
"For example," the Prime Min
ister wrote, "you speak of an of
ficial declaration of the readiness
of Britain and France, on the pre
text of defending their interests,
to lead their forces on to Egyp
tian territory and infringe Egyp
tian territorial integrity, but no
such official declarations have
been made.
"On the contrary, the govern
ment have publicly stated that
their aim is to seek a peaceful
solution. They have followed the
course enjoined by Article 33 of
the charter of the United Nations
to seek first of all solution by
negotiation, enquiry, mitigation,
conciliation. The facts bear this
out."
