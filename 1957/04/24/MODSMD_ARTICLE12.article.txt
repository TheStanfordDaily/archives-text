"Arrived today two loads of sand, one king," noted Thomas E.
Fraser in 1881 in his Lick Observatory'Diary. He Was referring to
the king of the Sandwich Islands who visited the Lick Observatory
during its construction and was the first to look through the 12-inch
lens which had just been installed.
The Lick Observatory Diary is a two-volume hand-written log of

the building of the Observatory.
It was written by Fraser who
was superintendent of the con
struction until the Observatory
came under the auspices of the
University of California in 1888.
The story of the Observatory
was related by Dr. Charles D.
Shane, Observatory director, to
the Tuesday Series' audience in
Memorial Auditorium last night.
Dr. Shane was previously a
professor of astronomy at (he
University of California and as
sistant director of the University
radiation laboratory during the
second World War.
He remarked that the Diary,
recovered a few years ago in the
Observatory basement, presents
a very human picture of the prob
lems encountered in what was
then the world's largest astro
nomical venture and most exten
sive mountain project.
The Mount Hamilton site of the
O b s e r v a I o r y was chosen by
James Lick with the assistance
of Fraser, who was then em
ployed at Lick's San* Jose estate.
The entire project was financed
by a $71)0,000 trust fund set up
by Lick before his death in 1870
and administered by Captain It.

Although I,ir|< had no previous
acquaintance with astronomy, lie
conceived the idea of building an
observatory to house the most
powerful telescope known. It
was in tie called the James Lick
Astronomical Observatory of
C'alifoi ni.i I Jniversity.
On Jan. 3, 1888, the first slat
was observed through the 3(i inch
telescope at Mount Hamilton.
And on June 1 of (hat year the
Observatory became the property
of the Regents of the University
of California.
Since then, the Observatory
has expanded and 10 people now
live at the Mount Hamilton site.
A new 120 inch telescope is now
under construction and is exceed
ed in size only by the 200-inch
mirror at Mount l'alomar.

The Mount Hamilton site of the

James Lick with the assistance
of Fraser, who was then em

The entire project was financed

Although I,ir|< had no previous
acquaintance with astronomy, lie
conceived the idea of building an
observatory to house the most
powerful telescope known. It
was in tie called the James Lick
Astronomical Observatory of
C'alifoi ni.i I Jniversity.
On Jan. 3, 1888, the first slat
was observed through the 3(i inch
telescope at Mount Hamilton.
And on June 1 of (hat year the
Observatory became the property
of the Regents of the University
of California.
Since then, the Observatory
has expanded and 10 people now
live at the Mount Hamilton site.
A new 120 inch telescope is now
under construction and is exceed
ed in size only by the 200-inch
mirror at Mount l'alomar.

"Arrived today two loads of sand, one king," noted Thomas E.
Fraser in 1881 in his Lick Observatory'Diary. He Was referring to
the king of the Sandwich Islands who visited the Lick Observatory
during its construction and was the first to look through the 12-inch
lens which had just been installed.
The Lick Observatory Diary is a two-volume hand-written log of

the building of the Observatory.
It was written by Fraser who
was superintendent of the con
struction until the Observatory
came under the auspices of the
University of California in 1888.
The story of the Observatory
was related by Dr. Charles D.
Shane, Observatory director, to
the Tuesday Series' audience in
Memorial Auditorium last night.
Dr. Shane was previously a
professor of astronomy at (he
University of California and as
sistant director of the University
radiation laboratory during the
second World War.
He remarked that the Diary,
recovered a few years ago in the
Observatory basement, presents
a very human picture of the prob
lems encountered in what was
then the world's largest astro
nomical venture and most exten
sive mountain project.
