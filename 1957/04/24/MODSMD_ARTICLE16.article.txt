# U.S. Newsmen To Be Allowed In Red China
## 
### 
WASHINGTON April 23 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster-
Dulles said today he is willing for
a "strictly limited" number of
newsmen to go to Red China, but
that no workable proposal has
been offered.
Dulles, retreating somewhat
from his earlier adamant posi
tion, told a news conference that
the State Department feels such
a "selective experiment" could be
made "consistently with our gen
eral policy."
But he said the department still
is not willing to permit Americans
generally to travel in Red China
so long as Chinese Communists
hold Americans as "political hos
tages."
"The question," he said, "is
whether we can have a passport
policy which will permit respon
sible news gathering and at the
same time not permit, a general
influx of Americans into Commu
nist China."
He said he and Undersecretary
of State Christian A. Herter had
given "careful study" to the prob
lem and that the department
"would be glad" to have the pub
lic get firsthand information
about China from correspondents
Dulles said the department had
exchanged views with newspaper
executives on a proposal for ";i
strictly limited number of respon
sible correspondents" to go to
China "on behalf of the news
community as a whole."
"But so far," he said, "no pro
posal has been made to us which
would meet the news-gathering
objective and not lead to a gen
eral breakdown of the restrictions
deemed important in the national
interest."
