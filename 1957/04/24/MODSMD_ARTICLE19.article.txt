# Action Needed
## 
### 
i stfhday President Eisenhower announced
from his Georgia headquarters that the Ad
ministration is supporting legislation to curb
misuse of union funds. We hope that govern
ment of the union itself will step into a field
where some form of eontrol is vitally needed.
The spectacle of Dave Reck grossly misusing
health and welfare funds and then hiding
behind the fifth amendment is a situation
which undoubtedly sickens the average rank
and-file union member.
Beck made the statement to the press that
the whole Senate investigation is inconsequen
tial and that six months from now all the
e'l'ects w k!I have completely blown over. We
hope the federal government will not let this
blow over.

Any time that labor officials can make liberal
use of the union's treasury without any prior
restrictions set on it, then that organization
ilsell should move toward a revamping.
In the case of the Teamsters Union, their
executive board refused to go along with the
AFI.-ClO's order for revamping. If the union
itsell won t do anything, then it is time for the
reorganization to be forced by an outside gov
ernmental authority something it has tried
to do without success since 1954.
We only hope that Ihe executive board of
the Teamsters Union will help themselves to
reconsider their action and cooperate more
fully with the Senate and rid themselves of
Heck and his squad of bodyguards.
