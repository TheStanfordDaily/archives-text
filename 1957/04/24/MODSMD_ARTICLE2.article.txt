# Homecoming, '57 Big Game Will Merge
## 
### 
A plan calling for the merger
of Homecoming and Big (lame
Week has been adopted by the
Cardinals.
"The plan has been adopted be
cause Cardinals feel that a con
centration of efforts on one good
event rather than two mediocre
events will be more beneficial
and will promote more campus
enthusiasm," said Bud McLellan,
president.
The new "Big Game Week"
will be as follows:
Wednesday
Button Day
Thursday
Burn the Bear Day
Bon fire
House decorations judging
: Open houses on the How
Friday
"Homecoming Day"
' Alumni Luncheon at Bowman
Rally in San Francisco and tradi
tional alumni parties
Saturday
Optional open houses al living
groups
Decoration of houses will take
the place of (he Homecoming pa
rade. The Cardinals feel the pa
rade takes too much time, effort
and money. Indications are that
campus opinion is adverse to a
float parade and prefers house
decorations, added McLellan.
House decorations should en
able living groups to save money
and to cut flown on time and ef
fort expended. In addition, more
I people will have the opportunity
I to see and enjoy house decora-
I lions. Eating clubs will also he
able to have decorations.
Elimination of the parade will
' give the freshman class a chance
to concentrate efforts on the bon
| fire construction rather than di
i viding Its efforts between the
float parade and bonfire.
