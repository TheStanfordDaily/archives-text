Thiilv Amendment Originator
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to Jack Winkler for writing
one of the first editorials to come from The
Daily in over a year with a positive attitude to
ward student government. The negative attitude
taken by Volumes 129 and 130 seems to be on its
way out and with it, 1 hope, the lack of faith in
the students' elected representatives. As Dave
Scott said in his editorial, "If future freshman
staffers are like this year's, Ihen the outlook for
a tilt m e really great Daily is bright indeed."
And 1 mij- T ht add that the freshmen can also
make student government look bright indeed. A
positive, clear thinking attitude is needed to over
come tho apathy toward student government
lhat is generated by a small minority on this
campus.
Contrary to what most people believe, T think
the majority of undergraduates on this campus
are interested in selecting their representatives
to the Legislature. The statitistics should be re
evaluated. First of all there are 2800 graduate
students on this campus. They have served their
undergraduate lime and are now pursuing their
interests in law, business, engineering, etc., for
the furtherance of their future careers. It is un
realistic to expect that many of them would be
interested in undergraduate student elections, al
though there is an exception with the Business
School when 119 Biz students voted in the pri
maries. This leaves about 5000 undergraduates,
and in the last election about 3000 of them voted,
or about 00 per cent. It may be desirable to have
a 100 per cent turnout but the point is that in an
election of this sort. GO per cent, I think, is quite
good. I wonder if other large campuses in the
neighborhood of 5000 do ihis well.
I hope next year's Legislature will take upon
itself to continue the work on the Tresidder Me
rnorial Union, revisions to the Constitution con
cerning Legislature representatives, Publications
Board Standing Rules revisions, the Bookstore
management proposal, etc., that is now being
worked on by the present Legislature. If. the
next Legislature tries to continue the job that
he present Legislature is doing and is given the
backing of the student body as a whole, including
tho student newspaper, then I think that next
year will be the year, as quoted from Jack
Winkler's editorial, "that Stanford 'indifference'
can finally be licked."

Stern Hashers Reply
Editor, Tho Daily: <.
We, the hashers of Stern Hall, wish to pro
test the so-called editorial which appeared yester
day. For such an article to have appeared as an
editorial seems to he a gross abuse of your edi
torial space. Half of the article was devoted to
griping over Easter dinner and Monday's lunch;
we were almost in tears to Ihink how this poor
soul must have suffered, just trying to get nour
ished. Such an article as this one could only he
classed as among the worse personal bellyaches
you print as letters. An editorial should be used
to express a mature, critical opinion on a topic of
world-wide, or at least campus-wide, interest; it
should not be a sounding board for a member of
your staff who is dissatisfied that Stern Hall
food does not quite measure up to mother's homo
cooking.
And why should it? We're all big boys now,
and we have to eat our meals with 570 diners at
Stern Hall. Mr. Griper, how can you expect food
prepared on such a mass scale to be like food
prepared for three or four? You should reflect
on the quite obvious fact that mass production
of food is not, and cannot, result in the same
quality as food given more personal attention.
You should also reflect on the fact that you gel
greater quantity and a greater variety of food
here, food that would more likely be served at
a restaurant than at home. If the rest of the
campus won't be bored by descriptions of the
meals: Do you always have soup for lunch at
home? Do you always have hot cereal for break
fast in the morning? Do you always have pie or
ice cream or cake for dessert? How often do you
eat. hot lunches at home? Does a trained dieti
cian prepare your meals at home? You may also
reflect on the fact that up till this year you have
never had a dining hall director here so willing
to listen to your problems, moreover, to go out
of her way to help you plan refreshments for
your social events.
As for the quality of the food here, we heartily
disagree with the chronic, homesick bellyachcrs.
We must not be such plutocrats as they are, for
we think the food here is pretty damn good.
