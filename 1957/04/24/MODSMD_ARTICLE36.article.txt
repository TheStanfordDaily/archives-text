# Kelly jumps in Easy Frosh Victory
## Cracks 20-Year-OKI Record as Papooses Go Over 100 Points 
### 
Stanford's freshman track team
hit its high-point mark of the sea
son yesterday on Angell Field,
rolling over San Jose JC and Men
lo College by a score of 104' ft to
46% to 10.
John Kelly was the outstanding
performer 1 of the meet as he final
ly got his long-sought Stanford
freshman record in the broad
jump.
Kelly was reddy to get the rec
ord yesterday, and it didn't take
him long to do it. On his first
jump he landed at the 23-BVa»mark
and the new standard was his.
The former record of 23-s'a was
set by Ray Brown in 1937. It was
the second oldest mark in the
frosli record book. Kelly took a
second leap of 23-3 1 and then
called it a day at the broad-jump
pit.
3 Double Victors
Kelly became one of three dou
ble winners in the meet when he
captured the 220 low hurdles in
25.2. The stiff wind which blew
across the track throughout the
meet slowed Kelly greatly, as it
did all the other runners.
Distance man Roger Beck was
the other double winner for the
Papooses. He won both the mile
and the two-mile.
Floyd Strain's club may be
without the services of pole-vault
er John Stahler for a time. He
won the pole vault at 12-6 and was
attempting to go still higher when
he strained a muscle in a thigh.
Out Indefinitely
Stahler immediately went under
the care of trainer Connie Jarvis,
and it is not yet known just how
long he will be out of action.
Norm Pease came back from a
second in the 100 to win the 220
in a wind-hindered 23.0. Bob Besse
captured the 440 in 51.0, and Dick
Lassen ni[«>ied teammate John
Patterson to take the half-mile in
1:59.6.
Jim Backstrand was the only
other undisputed field event win
ner for the Papooses as he threw
the javelin 195-2. Paul Gillespie
deadlocked with two San Jose
men at 5-11 in the high jump.
