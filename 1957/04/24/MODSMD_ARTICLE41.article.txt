# Track Team Faces Occidental Saturday in Stadium Contest
## Oxy Runks as Favorite on Win Over UCLA; Tigers Strong in Mile, Pole Vault, High Jump 
### Dick Barnes 
Hoping to shake the effects of Monday's debacle at the hands of
UCLA, the Stanford track team will host rugged Occidental College!
Saturday at 1:30 p.m. on the Stanford Stadium oval.
On the basis of Oxy's 18-point beating of UCLA and the Bruins' 1
38-point rout of Stanford, the southern team must rank as a I

heavy favorite to win.
Occidental, like Stanford, is
strong in some events but thin in
others. In the mile, for example,
the Tigers lravtj three runners
who have bettered 4:13. But in
the high hurdles, the best they
have is a 15.4 man.
Possible World Record
Probably the most attention
will be centered about Oxy's
great pole-vaulter, Bob Gutowski.
He is one of the greatest vaulters
of all time, and is conceded Ihe
best chance of any man now ac
tive to break Cornelius Warmer
dam's world record of 15-7%.
Gutowski has narrowly missed
the mark on several occasions
tlris season, each time ticking off
the bar when it was set at 15-9.
With the Stanford runway and
pit considered one of the best in
the West, Gutowski is being
given an excellent chance of
cracking the world mark Satur
day. Having vaulted here before,
he has had an opportunity to get
used to the tricky winds which
baffle some first-time competi
tors. »
Gutowski has twice cracked the
NCAA record this season. He
first cleared 13-4, and then hit
15-5 against UCLA. He should
also score in the broad jump,
since he has leaped just one
fourth inch short of 24 feet this
year.
Strongest Event
The Tigers' strongest event is
the mile. If Oxy coach Chuck
Coker chooses to load up in this
race, he should have no trouble
sweeping the Indians.
Ty Hadley leads this star-stud
ded group with a year's best
mark of 4:11.3, turned in last
week against Fresno State. He is
closely followed by Dave Reis
bord and Larry Wray, both at
4:12.3. The "slow" man of the
group is Todd White, who is in
the 4:l4's.
Stanford's victory hopes lie in
scoring heavily in the events
where the Tigers are hurting.
Oxy's best shot putter has thrown
just 47-11, and tire best they have
in the discus is 145-4 Ms.
Javelin Points
Payton Jordan's team should
also pick up al least a first and
possibly runner-up points in Ihe
javelin, where no Tiger has bet
tered 201-0.
But Occidental has men who
are just a shade behind some of
the'lndians' favorites, and could
turn the meet into a roul if they
upset the Tribesmen.
Dennis Bambauer, at 48,3, will
be pressing Stanford's Don Chc
sarek all the way in the 440. Bill
Reay 1:54.1) will be doing the
same to Joe Woollett in the 880.
In Ihe field events, Frank Herr
mann will have to be itr top form
to beat Gutowski. Phil Fehlen
must watch out for Dick Haddon,
Oxy's 6-5% high jumper.

tlris season, each time ticking off
the bar when it was set at 15-9.
With the Stanford runway and
pit considered one of the best in
the West, Gutowski is being
given an excellent chance of
cracking the world mark Satur
day. Having vaulted here before,
he has had an opportunity to get
used to the tricky winds which
baffle some first-time competi
tors. »
Gutowski has twice cracked the
NCAA record this season. He
first cleared 13-4, and then hit
15-5 against UCLA. He should
also score in the broad jump,
since he has leaped just one
fourth inch short of 24 feet this
year.
Strongest Event
The Tigers' strongest event is
the mile. If Oxy coach Chuck
Coker chooses to load up in this
race, he should have no trouble
sweeping the Indians.
Ty Hadley leads this star-stud
ded group with a year's best
mark of 4:11.3, turned in last
week against Fresno State. He is
closely followed by Dave Reis
bord and Larry Wray, both at
4:12.3. The "slow" man of the
group is Todd White, who is in
the 4:l4's.
Stanford's victory hopes lie in
scoring heavily in the events
where the Tigers are hurting.
Oxy's best shot putter has thrown
just 47-11, and tire best they have
in the discus is 145-4 Ms.
Javelin Points
Payton Jordan's team should
also pick up al least a first and
possibly runner-up points in Ihe
javelin, where no Tiger has bet
tered 201-0.
But Occidental has men who
are just a shade behind some of
the'lndians' favorites, and could
turn the meet into a roul if they
upset the Tribesmen.
Dennis Bambauer, at 48,3, will
be pressing Stanford's Don Chc
sarek all the way in the 440. Bill
Reay 1:54.1) will be doing the
same to Joe Woollett in the 880.
In Ihe field events, Frank Herr
mann will have to be itr top form
to beat Gutowski. Phil Fehlen
must watch out for Dick Haddon,
Oxy's 6-5% high jumper.
Hoping to shake the effects of Monday's debacle at the hands of
UCLA, the Stanford track team will host rugged Occidental College!
Saturday at 1:30 p.m. on the Stanford Stadium oval.
On the basis of Oxy's 18-point beating of UCLA and the Bruins' 1
38-point rout of Stanford, the southern team must rank as a I

heavy favorite to win.
Occidental, like Stanford, is
strong in some events but thin in
others. In the mile, for example,
the Tigers lravtj three runners
who have bettered 4:13. But in
the high hurdles, the best they
have is a 15.4 man.
Possible World Record
Probably the most attention
will be centered about Oxy's
great pole-vaulter, Bob Gutowski.
He is one of the greatest vaulters
of all time, and is conceded Ihe
best chance of any man now ac
tive to break Cornelius Warmer
dam's world record of 15-7%.
Gutowski has narrowly missed
the mark on several occasions
