# Farm Water Shortage Is Foreseen
## Searsville-Felt Lakes, Domestic Well System Will Not Be Sufficient 
### Neale Creamer 
Water comes out of your show
er, the golf eourse gets watered,
Lake Lag fills up. But this is not
all that there is to the Stanford
water system.
Back in 1887 Senator Stanford
recognized the need for an abun
dant water supply. lie, the Spring
Valley Water Company and the
Manzanita Water Company built
Searsville Lake on the Stanford
farm. But, alas, it drew water
from the lake in a manner that
produced the greatest possible
amount of smell in a given vol
ume of water. For this and other
similar reasons, the water proved
unfit for domestic use. A well
was dug on campus and people
had to come to it with buckets
and pitchers. However, the Sears
ville water was still used for
baths. Again this proved unsatis
factory.
Since 1901, therefore, we have
had two water systems: Sears
ville-Fell Lakes irrigation and the
domestic well system.
One Million Gallons
The irrigation system, oddly
enough, is used to water the golf
course, lawns and fields around
campus. Fell Lake above campus
was added later to provide addi
tional water storage. The cam
pus uses over one million gallons
of irrigation water per day. Sera
phim F. Posl, assistant business
manager, warns that all taps out
side the buildings marked with
yellow paint are for irrigation
and not drinking. It is similar to
water from Lake Lagunita, and
a fish as well as miscellaneous
dirt may come out of the faucet.
All Stanford drinking, bath and
general domestic water comes
from four wells on campus*
Three are located between the
Convalescent Home and the Stan
ford golf course and a new one
was sunk last year' near the ath
letic fields. One of these wells
was drilled in 1924, and still pro
duces 600 gallons of water a min
ute. The wells produce enough
water for the whole campus,
which uses about 5% million gal
lons of water a day.
The distinctive taste of the wa
ter is caused by chlorination.
About a day and a half's supply
of water is stored in a reservoir
across the street from President
Sterling's residence. Thus the
campus is supplied by gravity
feed, except for certain houses
above the reservoir. They have
two alternatives: one, to carry
water to their houses as in the
"good old days; and the other, to
install a pressure system of their
own, which is by far the more
popular method.
Future Water
The most serious problem is
where we will get our water in
the future. The water table has
been going down. Fifty years
ago there were artesian wells
gushing water all over campus.
With another dry winter like the
past one, according to Carl Maier,
assistant superintendent of build
ings and grounds, the water table
may drop even lower. This drop
could cause the wells to go dry,
or result in salt water wells as
happened last year.
In an emergency, two things
could be done. Excess water con
sumption could be reduced. Ac
cording to Mr. Maier, this could
be done simply by putting meters
on water use. If students had to
pay for the water, Maier said,
they would not stay in the shower
for such a long time, or leave the
water running.
Or, it is possible to get water
from the Ileteh I-Ictchy Aqueduct,
which runs above campus and
serves San Francisco; but the
price would be prohibitive. It
would cost from two to three

times as much as the present: 15
cents per 1000 gallons for the well
water. Maier thinks it would be
possible to drill the Stanford wells
deeper than their present 400 to
700-foot depth and si ill get drink
ing water cheaper than San Fran
cisco.
Lake Lag had little to do with
either water system. The lake
was originally built to act as a
reservoir, but now is used for
recreational purposes only.
