# Bulganin Says Russia Will Discuss Eden Plan
## Soviet Premier Suggests Gradual Abolishment of Military Power 
### 
LONDON, ApfiI 23 (UP) Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin said
in a diplomatic note released today that Russia is ready "to resume
discussion of the "Eden plan" for a demilitarized zone stretching
across Europe on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
The Soviet premier said the Soviet Union is prepared to resume

discussion of the Eden plan he
cause it has become increasingly
difficult "to abolish the military
alignments of powers and replace
them by a system of collective se
curity in Europe."
V. M. Molotov, former Soviet
foreign minister, rejected the
Eden plan shortly after its an
nouncement in 1954, although it
has since formed the basis of
many discussions in meetings of
the UN Disarmament Commis
sion.
Bulganin's reference to the
Eden plan came at the end of a
long letter calling on Macmillan
to help promote Anglo - Soviet
friendship.
"It is evidently difficult imme
diately to abolish the military
alignments of powers and replace
them by a system of collective se
curity in Europe," he said.
"One should, in the interests of
Great Britain and the U.S.S.R.
and of European security as a
whole therefore try to come to
terms on temporary transitional
measures which would gradually
lead to this goal.
"The Soviet government pro
ceeds from the assumption that
in this connection its correspond
ing proposals would also be dis
cussed, such as the proposal on a
/one of aerial survey in Europe."
Harold Stassen, U.S. delegate t<>
the five-power UN Disarmament
Conference in London, proposed
last Wednesday a partial open
skies plan instead of the full
measure proposed in 1955 by
President Eisenhower and reject
ed by Soviet leaders.
