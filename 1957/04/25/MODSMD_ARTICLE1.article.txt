# Suez Canal Operational Plan Given
## Egypt's Plan Still Bars Israeli Ships From Vital Waterway 
### 
CAIRO, April 24 (UP)—Egypt
revealed today its long • awaited
plan for operation of the Suez
Canal. The terms made crystal
clear Egypt's determination to
maintain complete control over
the vital waterway.
Israel shipping will continue to
be barred.
The government of President
Gamal Abdel Nasser published
the plan even while the United
States moved to put the Suez
question before the United Na
tions Security Council.
Ships of many nations are
transiting the canal under
Egypt's terms. The first U.S.
flag vessel since the waterway
was blocked last November
steamed into the canal this morn
ing. The first British flag ship
went through last week.
Egyptian Plan
The terms of the Egyptian plan
indicated some minor concessions
to the Western viewpoint but no
major changes in the draft mem
orandum Cairo distributed to a
number of governments some
weeks ago.
The plan made no mention of
the six principles laid down by
the UN Security Council last Oc
tober to insure the waterway was
"insulated" from politics.
Egypt will collect all tolls, but
agreed to take disputes over dues
and operations to arbitration.
(U.S. State Department offi
cials would not comment on the
Egyptian plan pending receipt of
a copy. In London, British offi
cials likewise refused to comment
but indicated the government still
stood by its advice to British
shippers to avoid the canal. The
United States had advised Ameri
can shippers using the canal to
pay tolls to Egypt under protest.
American Request
(At the United Nations, Ameri
can officials today requested a
meeting of the Security Council
to report on the negotiations with
Egypt. It was expected the meet
ing would be called for Friday.)
As predicted during the weeks
of negotiations between Ameri
can Ambassador Raymond Hare
and Egyptian officials, the Unit
ed States apparently failed to win
any major changes. But the ne
gotiations resulted in a number
of minor revisions. These includ
ed agreement by Egypt:
• To arbitrate any increase in
tolls beyond one per cent yearly
and complaints about discrimina
tion or violation of the code gov
erning operation of the canal.
• To take disputes over larger
questions governed by the 1888
Suez Canal Convention to the In
ternational Court and accept the
tribunal's ruling.

As predicted during the weeks
of negotiations between Ameri
can Ambassador Raymond Hare
and Egyptian officials, the Unit
ed States apparently failed to win
any major changes. But the ne
gotiations resulted in a number
of minor revisions. These includ
ed agreement by Egypt:
• To arbitrate any increase in
tolls beyond one per cent yearly
and complaints about discrimina
tion or violation of the code gov
erning operation of the canal.
• To take disputes over larger
questions governed by the 1888
Suez Canal Convention to the In
ternational Court and accept the
tribunal's ruling.
CAIRO, April 24 (UP)—Egypt
revealed today its long • awaited
plan for operation of the Suez
Canal. The terms made crystal
clear Egypt's determination to
maintain complete control over
the vital waterway.
Israel shipping will continue to
be barred.
The government of President
Gamal Abdel Nasser published
the plan even while the United
States moved to put the Suez
question before the United Na
tions Security Council.
Ships of many nations are
transiting the canal under
Egypt's terms. The first U.S.
flag vessel since the waterway
was blocked last November
steamed into the canal this morn
ing. The first British flag ship
went through last week.
Egyptian Plan
The terms of the Egyptian plan
indicated some minor concessions
to the Western viewpoint but no
major changes in the draft mem
orandum Cairo distributed to a
number of governments some
weeks ago.
The plan made no mention of
the six principles laid down by
the UN Security Council last Oc
tober to insure the waterway was
"insulated" from politics.
Egypt will collect all tolls, but
agreed to take disputes over dues
and operations to arbitration.
(U.S. State Department offi
cials would not comment on the
Egyptian plan pending receipt of
a copy. In London, British offi
cials likewise refused to comment
but indicated the government still
stood by its advice to British
shippers to avoid the canal. The
United States had advised Ameri
can shippers using the canal to
pay tolls to Egypt under protest.
American Request
(At the United Nations, Ameri
can officials today requested a
meeting of the Security Council
to report on the negotiations with
Egypt. It was expected the meet
ing would be called for Friday.)
