# Chappie Delayed—Out Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Chaparral which was scheduled to he sold
yesterday will he sold on Quad tomorrow. Tile
magazine was held up because pictures of two
Stanford athletes appeared in ads, which would
have made them ineligible for collegiate sports,

although they wore not paid tor posing. The ads
appeared on opposite pages ('49 and 50) and, aw
shown above, were removed from the magazine
yesterday. The 40-eent issue is a parody on
Holiday magazine renamed "Hodilay."
