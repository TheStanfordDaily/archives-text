# Professor Calls American Scene Artists Objective
## But Says They Are Nostalgic; Uses Slides to Trace Evolution 
### 
American Scene artists viewed their subjects objectively but with
;i corresponding nostalgic fondness, Daniel M. Mendelowitz, profes
sor of art and education here, said yesterday afternoon in the second
of four Committee of Art-sponsored lectures.
Mendelowitz traced the evolution of the American Scene art with

slides and comments.
The lecturer explained that (he
American Scene artists differed
from two other groups of artists:
those interested in style, composi
tion and organization, who were
known as the experimentalists;
and social realists who concen
trated on promoting social equal
ity and social problems.
Typical American Scene art
was neither dramatized, senti
mentalized nor moralized.
Scientific Climate
Mendelowitz said that, the trait
of objectivity appears early in
American art history. He attrib
uted this to the "climate of scien
tific objectivity" which developed.
The balance between the la
ments of nature and idealism es
tablishes the characteristics of
the artists, the lecturer declared.
American Scene and American
Scene realists keep the idealistic
expressions out of their work.
The speaker divided American
| Scene artists into two categories:
i the gifted cosmopolitans such as
I West, Whistler, Sargent and Aus
; tin, and the individualists such as
j Hopper and Albright. He pointed
1 out that even the individualistic
artists are aware of contempo
rary movements in art.
Rediscovering Artists
The 18th and 19th century ar-
J lists are being rediscovered, Men
delowitz said. He noted that for
a time artists were ashamed of
the earlier traditions of art, but
now are finding great value in
| the early paintings.
In the slides which aceompa
1 niod his lecture, Mendelowitz
[ pointed out the use of texture in
I the paintings. He added that land-
I scape scenes usually include a
h u m a n component, but that
many landscapes were based on i
a sense of pride in the country
| and featured grandiose scenes of i
I country life.
Mendelowitz said that the ar
tists were sometimes influenced
by the impressionists, and some
works showed the influence of
: the French cublstic painters.

Rediscovering Artists
The 18th and 19th century ar-
J lists are being rediscovered, Men
delowitz said. He noted that for
a time artists were ashamed of
the earlier traditions of art, but
now are finding great value in
| the early paintings.
In the slides which aceompa
1 niod his lecture, Mendelowitz
[ pointed out the use of texture in
I the paintings. He added that land-
I scape scenes usually include a
h u m a n component, but that
many landscapes were based on i
a sense of pride in the country
| and featured grandiose scenes of i
I country life.
Mendelowitz said that the ar
tists were sometimes influenced
by the impressionists, and some
works showed the influence of
: the French cublstic painters.
American Scene artists viewed their subjects objectively but with
;i corresponding nostalgic fondness, Daniel M. Mendelowitz, profes
sor of art and education here, said yesterday afternoon in the second
of four Committee of Art-sponsored lectures.
Mendelowitz traced the evolution of the American Scene art with

slides and comments.
The lecturer explained that (he
American Scene artists differed
from two other groups of artists:
those interested in style, composi
tion and organization, who were
known as the experimentalists;
and social realists who concen
trated on promoting social equal
ity and social problems.
Typical American Scene art
was neither dramatized, senti
mentalized nor moralized.
Scientific Climate
Mendelowitz said that, the trait
of objectivity appears early in
American art history. He attrib
uted this to the "climate of scien
tific objectivity" which developed.
The balance between the la
ments of nature and idealism es
tablishes the characteristics of
the artists, the lecturer declared.
American Scene and American
Scene realists keep the idealistic
expressions out of their work.
The speaker divided American
| Scene artists into two categories:
i the gifted cosmopolitans such as
I West, Whistler, Sargent and Aus
; tin, and the individualists such as
j Hopper and Albright. He pointed
1 out that even the individualistic
artists are aware of contempo
rary movements in art.
