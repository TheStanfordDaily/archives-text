# Stonethrowing Mobs Demand Removal of Jordan's Khalidi
## Hussein Backs Up Premier, Calls Reds Responsible 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan, April 24 (UP)
I â€”Anti-American, stone-throwing
! mobs demanded the overthrow of
| pro-Western Premier H us s e in
' Khalidi today. But Khalidi stood
| firm, backed by King Hussein,
! who blamed international Com
munism for attempts to "break
up this country."
It was the first time the young
king had openly pinned the blame
on Communism for his country':-;
current troubles.
The 22-year-old king warned he
would take "all measures" includ
ing martial law, if necessary, to
save his country. The monarch
said he may move to end the
crisis in the next 24 hours.
In an interview with a group of
Western correspondents, Hussein
declared he was backed by his
army, his parties and his people
in the struggle against left-wing
forces.
"We Can Handle It"
"I think we can handle this situ
ation ourselves," the king added.
Left-wing mobs surged through
the streets of Amman and all I he
main Jordanian cities today shout
ing against the Khalidi govern
ment and the Eisenhower Dor
trine.
Shops were shuttered and pub
lic transportation halted in a gen
eral strike called by the leftixi
forces hostile to the king and the
government.
In Amman helmeted police and
troops in full battle dress repulsed
attempts by mobs to march on
the government building and the
main post office. The demons! ra
tors were egged on by shouting,
screaming agitators.
12 Persons Injured
A dozen persons were injured
in rock-throwing incidents in Am
man, but loyal troops and police
kept the situation under control
in the capital. Elsewhere condi
tions were obscured by a com
munications blackout.
But it again appeared to be a
stand-off between the government
and left-wing nationalist, forces,
after a tension-packed day which
also saw riots swirl through Nab
lus, Ramallah, Jericho and the
Jordanian sector of Jerusalem.
Full censorship was reimposed
shortly after midday. Army
guards patrolled the area around
the U.S. and other foreign embas
sies. The American embassy alert
ed its personnel to be ready for
evacuation in the event dangerous
fighting broke out.
Radio Reports
(The Syrian Damascus radio re
ported that the Jordanian army
had closed the Syria-Jordan boi
der to traffic in both directions
Unconfirmed reports reaching Tel
Aviv said Iraqi troops were ap
proaching the border to take con
trol of the frontier in the name
of King Hussein.
(Sources in Israel also reported
that Iraq had delivered an ulti
matium to Egypt and Syria warn
ing it would use force if King
Hussein's regime were over
thrown. The Iraqi warning was
delivered in Cairo and Damascus
by Iraq's ambassadors, sources
said.)
