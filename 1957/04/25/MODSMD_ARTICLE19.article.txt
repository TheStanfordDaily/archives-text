# To Satisfy the Student
## 
### 
A\ OVERWHELMING NUMBER of students have
compluined about the food they receive in
lb. ir dormitory dining halls. Their complaints
range from dislikes of certain foods to dislikes
of the way the food is prepared and the general
atmosphere iu which it is served.
If the complaining student would like to
help the situation, he must consider whether
his grievance is one of individual taste or
whether it is something that can he corrected
l»\ the dining hall staff. The dining hall direc
tors have lold The Daily they will welcome
uny specific suggestions offered to improve the
quality of their service.
100 often a student who gets a poor cut of
meat —or thinks he has u poor cut of meat —
instead of going to the food line to get u better
portion, will sit und eompluin to his fellow
diners that the whole dining hull set-up is
worse than anything he can imagine.
I his type of complaint is fruitless for many
reasons. First, it does not begin to correct the
ill complained of. Second, il creates ill-will
among others at the table, disturbing them so
that they do not feel like eating. Third, the
dining hall stall will never know what it is
that is bothering the student.

Po this student, we earnestly suggest I hut lie
p;et himself up out of his seut and usk for
unother portion. If he is not satisfied this
time, <lin i 11 hall directors have asked that he
see them, at some time other than meal time,
and the problem can h<> ironed out then.
The suggestion sought after is the one which
attempts to improve the service. It is admitted
that the individual s desire for rare meat, for
example, cannot always he satisfied; hilt if he
cun suggest, for instance, that there he a choice
of fruit juice in a hall where there is no choice,
the stall may he aide to accommodate him. If
they cannot make the change he suggests, they
will he glad to explain why.
It must he remembered that, the sole raison
d'etre of the dining halls is to satisfy the stu
dent. He pays an average of $2.06 a day for
meals. He is entitled to satisfaction.
It is true that complaints are sometimes
channeled by the dining hall director to other
sources. But il the student makes a construc
tive suggestion to the dining hull director first,
she will feel obligated to seriously consider the
suggestion and will undoubtedly do her best
to put il into use if she considers it wise und
feusihie.
