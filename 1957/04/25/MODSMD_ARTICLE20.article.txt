### 
John I*ostkr Di i.t.f.s came up with another
answer in regard to the newsmen-to-Bed-China
issue tlie oilier day. He said that now lie is
willing lo let ;i "strictly limiterl" number of
newsmen go to Red < liina. But, so as not to
commit himsell in the future, lie qualified this
allowance lis sa\ing lliat no workable proposal
lias yet been worked out.
Mr. Dulles envisions an arrangement where
;i pool of newspapermen selected In the State
Department would go lo China "on behalf of
the news eommuuity as a whole." We hold
that anything short of letting all interested
new-men into Bed China is a violation of "the
people's right lo know,'' of an unrestrained
press.
1 he much-traveled Seeretarv of State has
reasoned that to let newsmen in would lead
to ;i general influx of Americans into Conimu
liist China, and that this should not be allowed
because ol the American political hostages

there and the fact that it might lead to more
pressure for recognition of Bed China.
\\ e can t see how letting or not letting jour
nalists into China would influence the Ameri
can hostage situation.
At present Bed China is one of the biggest
question myrks in the world. The main reason
is sheer ignorance of what is going on within
her borders. Letting informed and responsible
newsmen into China would do much to clear
up the mystery and keep the United States
informed of ;i nation of 550 million people.
Considering the fact that tin* Bed govern
ment has been the actual government of China
since 1949, we think recognition is inevitable
and the only course of action to take.
I lie ever-vacillating Dulles should quit giv
ing a different answer every week on the issue,
and aid the "news - gathering objective" he
claims lie is so concerned with by lifting the
barriers barring American journalists.
