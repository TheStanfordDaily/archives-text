Dining Hall Survey
Editor, The Daily:
It's long past limn for a constructive analysis
of dormitory food. Someone who screams, "The
food stinks," isn't helping the dietician improve
it.
A survey is being prepared on which diners
may rate the food for two weeks as "good," "ac
ceptable" or "poor" (and,why!). Any Stern diner
may participate especially those who are most
dissatisfied.

The dining hall staff has agreed to use the
results of this survey; i.e., a universally disliked
dish may be dropped and replaced by a favorite
or a new one.
This controversy may belong within the walls
of Stern, but. we believe those fraternity men
who may soon be eating from a "common kitch
en" will be interested in whether student desires
can be mot in University-controlled fiining facili
ties.
