# Present Mail Delivery Result Of 66 Years of Development
## Office Grows From 1891 Railroad Platform To a Proposed $150,000 Building in 1955 
### Dick Frey 
Mail delivery to Stanford stu
dents wag quite a job back in the
days when the University consist
ed of the Quad and a few build
ings.
In 1891 Palo Alto was only a
railroad platform between Menlo
Park and Mayfield (now South
Palo Alto). Mail was unloaded at
Menlo Park, since all the fastest
trains stopped there to accommo
date the large country estates in
the area. Mail for Stanford was
addressed to Menlo Park and was
brought by wagon to the campus.
Twice a day the mail wagon
delivered mail and express matter.
Student mail clerks were appoint
ed at Encina and old Roble (now
Sequoia) halls. These clerks sort
ed the mail on long tables in the
hall lobbies, while eager students
crowded around to watch for their
mail. Faculty, University employ
ees and students not residing in
dormitories picked up their mail
at the Registrar's office.
New Post Office
This procedure continued for
two years until a crude wooden
building was erected at the rear
of the area now occupied by Me
morial Church. Mail was first
brought from Palo Alto to ihe
new University post office in the
spring of 1893.
In September of the same year
Stanford mail could be addressed
directly to the campus for the
first time.
The wooden building was a fa
vorite gathering place for stu
dents; it was also the building
which was painted red by stu
dents in 1896 when the famous
Stanford lawsuit was decided in
favor of the University. (David
Starr Jordan said in his biography
that the paint job was never men
tioned in the local papers because
the defacing of government prop
erty.was involved).
Old Shack Replaced
A new $6500 post office built
by the University replaced the old
wooden shack in the autumn of
1900 and still serves Stanford to
day. These new "luxurious ac
commodations," as they were de
scribed, received mail for 1239

students plus faculty members
and University employees.
The old wooden building served
as a store where books, drugs and
candy were sold at various inter
vals until the building disappeared
in the destruction created by the
1906 earthquake.
By 1924 Stanford's population
had grown to 4000. and in the
summer of that year the post of
fice was remodeled and an exten
sion was added at the rear to in
crease working space and box ca
pacity.
Mounting Registration
Alice Hays in her history of the
post office in the January 1925
Stanford Illustrated Review said:
"Mounting registration m akes
corresponding demands upon the
post office . . . and it is fortunate
that the future building plans of
the University include a new post
office building which . . . will
probably be placed across the
street and on a much larger site."
However, the proposed new build
ing never became a reality.
Mail posted at the University
post office was postmarked "Stan
ford University" until Aug. 2<>,
1947, when the postmark was
changed to "Stanford."
The reason for the change in
official designation was reported
in The Stanford Daily as follows:
"The change was requested by the
Administration to avoid the mis
representation existing through
the use of the present address by
private individuals and concerns
for business purposes."
$150,000 Office
In 1955 the University announc
ed plans for a new $150,000 post
office building, twice the size of
the present one and to be located
across the street nexi to Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house. An unin
habited residence on the site was
razed shortly after the announce
ment.
Today the Stanford post office
serves as an independent branch
of the Palo Alto post office, and
mail is brought directly to the
campus rather than through the
main office. More than 9000 let
ters, 50 sacks of packages and
hundreds of periodicals are re
ceived daily.

1947, when the postmark was

The reason for the change in
official designation was reported

"The change was requested by the

$150,000 Office
In 1955 the University announc
ed plans for a new $150,000 post
office building, twice the size of
the present one and to be located
across the street nexi to Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house. An unin
habited residence on the site was
razed shortly after the announce
ment.
Today the Stanford post office
serves as an independent branch
of the Palo Alto post office, and
mail is brought directly to the
campus rather than through the
main office. More than 9000 let
ters, 50 sacks of packages and
hundreds of periodicals are re
ceived daily.


STANFORD POST OFFICE HAS OCCUPIED THIS BUILDING SINCE 1900
Mail delivery to Stanford stu
dents wag quite a job back in the
days when the University consist
ed of the Quad and a few build
ings.
In 1891 Palo Alto was only a
railroad platform between Menlo
Park and Mayfield (now South
Palo Alto). Mail was unloaded at
Menlo Park, since all the fastest
trains stopped there to accommo
date the large country estates in
the area. Mail for Stanford was
addressed to Menlo Park and was
brought by wagon to the campus.
Twice a day the mail wagon
delivered mail and express matter.
Student mail clerks were appoint
ed at Encina and old Roble (now
Sequoia) halls. These clerks sort
ed the mail on long tables in the
hall lobbies, while eager students
crowded around to watch for their
mail. Faculty, University employ
ees and students not residing in
dormitories picked up their mail
at the Registrar's office.
New Post Office
This procedure continued for
two years until a crude wooden
building was erected at the rear
of the area now occupied by Me
morial Church. Mail was first
brought from Palo Alto to ihe
new University post office in the
spring of 1893.
In September of the same year
Stanford mail could be addressed
directly to the campus for the
first time.
The wooden building was a fa
vorite gathering place for stu
dents; it was also the building
which was painted red by stu
dents in 1896 when the famous
Stanford lawsuit was decided in
favor of the University. (David
Starr Jordan said in his biography
that the paint job was never men
tioned in the local papers because
the defacing of government prop
erty.was involved).
Old Shack Replaced
A new $6500 post office built
by the University replaced the old
wooden shack in the autumn of
1900 and still serves Stanford to
day. These new "luxurious ac
commodations," as they were de
scribed, received mail for 1239

students plus faculty members
and University employees.
The old wooden building served
as a store where books, drugs and
candy were sold at various inter
vals until the building disappeared
in the destruction created by the
1906 earthquake.
By 1924 Stanford's population
had grown to 4000. and in the
summer of that year the post of
fice was remodeled and an exten
sion was added at the rear to in
crease working space and box ca
pacity.
Mounting Registration
Alice Hays in her history of the
post office in the January 1925
Stanford Illustrated Review said:
"Mounting registration m akes
corresponding demands upon the
post office . . . and it is fortunate
that the future building plans of
the University include a new post
office building which . . . will
probably be placed across the
street and on a much larger site."
However, the proposed new build
ing never became a reality.

vals until the building disappeared
in the destruction created by the
1906 earthquake.
By 1924 Stanford's population
had grown to 4000. and in the
summer of that year the post of
fice was remodeled and an exten
sion was added at the rear to in
crease working space and box ca
pacity.
Mounting Registration
Alice Hays in her history of the
post office in the January 1925
Stanford Illustrated Review said:
"Mounting registration m akes
corresponding demands upon the
post office . . . and it is fortunate
that the future building plans of
the University include a new post
office building which . . . will
probably be placed across the
street and on a much larger site."
However, the proposed new build
ing never became a reality.
Mail posted at the University
post office was postmarked "Stan
ford University" until Aug. 2<>,
1947, when the postmark was
changed to "Stanford."
The reason for the change in
official designation was reported
in The Stanford Daily as follows:
"The change was requested by the
Administration to avoid the mis
representation existing through
the use of the present address by
private individuals and concerns
for business purposes."
$150,000 Office
In 1955 the University announc
ed plans for a new $150,000 post
office building, twice the size of
the present one and to be located
across the street nexi to Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house. An unin
habited residence on the site was
razed shortly after the announce
ment.
Today the Stanford post office
serves as an independent branch
of the Palo Alto post office, and
mail is brought directly to the
campus rather than through the
main office. More than 9000 let
ters, 50 sacks of packages and
hundreds of periodicals are re
ceived daily.


STANFORD POST OFFICE HAS OCCUPIED THIS BUILDING SINCE 1900
