Stanford's crew the team which has to work to help pay its
•equipment arid transportation expenses is sponsoring a program to
morrow in Mem Aud to help buy new shells and pay the varsity's
way to the IRA regatta in Syracuse.
Knoll Garner, renowned modern jazz pianist, will be the high
light of (Ik* 4:15 show. If you're a jit/./ fan, you'll get more than
your money's worth from hearing Garner; if you're a sports fan,
you'll know your money's going to a really worthwhile cause;
if you're both, well, then you have no excuse for not attending.
The crew hopes to have a full house at Mem Aud tomorrow, so
be sure to be on hand early for an entertaining show.
The word from down south is that Occidental is looking forward
to a real picnic on the remains of the Stanford track team this
Saturday in Stanford Stadium. Oxy was looking on while the Tribe
was getting murdered by UCLA, and now has it all figured out as
to how they can score 90 points or over.
Chock Coker's Tigers have thc\jdca that I hey will sweep the
100, 220 and 440 from the Indians.' There's no doubt that they're
strong in the quarter, with Dennis Bamhaucr (4<S 3), John Zetz
man (IS I) and Pat Logan (48.5). Hut, on the other hand, Stan
lord does have a man named Don Chesarek who has run 47.7 this
season.
Oxy has a good sprinter, 100. Rudy Alston is unbeaten this year,
and has turned in clockings of 9.8 and 21.5. They have supporting
strength, also, in the persons of Stu Thomason <9.9i, Mike Quint
(10.0) and Bambauer (21.4). But Payton Jordan has Frank Herr
mann entered for the Tribe in both of these races, and he has run
9.fl and 20.9. Chesarek and Herrmann just don't appear to bo the
type who are going to be swept.
The Tigers also have a shot putter, Dave Goodenough, who thinks
he's good enough to win his event. He's put the 16-pound ball some
48 feet six inches this year, only about three feel less tharr the In
dians' Ray Williamson and Chris Plain.
Probably the event in which the Tigers have the most right to
claim victory is the pole vault. The principal question centered
around the vault is not sv> much whether or not Bob Gutowski will
win as whether or not he will break the world's record.
Gutowski has been flirting with Cornelius Warmerdam's mark
of 15-7% for almost a year, and has been coming closer almost every
meet. The Oxy ace has set a 1957 deadline to make the world mark
his.
He says he picked up a lot of little pointers on recent European
tours and at the Olympics in Melbourne. But probably most impor
tant of all, Gutowski has attained a casual approach to his vaulting
in place of his previous tenseness. He now likes to play tennis the*
flay before a meet to take his mind off the upcoming competition.
Record-holder Warmerdam has predicted that Gutowski will
break his mark this year, lie says that Gutowski "has the speed,
the strength and the ideal build for vaulting. He also has good
spring. I couldn't broad jump over 21 feet, hut he's gone (lose to
24." Rube Saniuelsen of the Pasadena Star-News says Gutowski
will have one of his best chances for 16 -feet when Oxy invades 1
Stanford, because "the Indians' pit is regarded as one of the best
in the country." Conditions being right, Stanford Stadium may
well he the scene of the breaking of one of trackc'om's oldest world
records.
Oxy may lie nice and confident (maybe OVER-confiden*) for Sat
urday's meet, but Stanford isn't exactly planning to take things
lying down. Jordan's men are plenty burned up about their miser
able showing against UCLA. There were a few, like Maury Graves,
who looked good, but on a whole the team was lousy, and it knows it.
Besides just losing, the Indians didn't like having to listen to
some of the cracks the Oxy team was making from the stands, nor
to some of the things the Bruin fans and team members were saying
during the course of the meet.
Stanford means to get back at their tormentors. Since if won't
lie meeting UCLA again until the PCC meet in May, this means
that Oxy must bear the hrimt of the Indians' revenge in the inline
diale future —Saturday, for example.
Actually, Ihe Stanford cause isn't as hopeless as it may seem
from just a quick look at comparative scores against UCLA. Oxy
is plenty weak in all three weight events. Stanford should take the
discus, javelin and shot put all by 8-1 scores.
Of course the Tigers must he conceded a sweep in the mile ami
a raft of points in the XXO, but then the Indians should come back
with 1-2 finishes in both hurdles races. Oxy will probably also
sweep the pole vault, hut shouldn't get better than three points in
either the high jump or broad jump.
The keys to the meet are probably Ihe sprints and 440. If Chesa- I
rek wins the quarter and Herrmann gets second in the two dashes, |
as both should, Stanford will be in good shape. As it looks from j
here, the meet may come down to the relay. In this event, there's !
no telling what will happen. But one thing's for sure the Indians |
are plenty mad and ready to go after the Tigers.

Stanford means to get back at their tormentors. Since if won't
lie meeting UCLA again until the PCC meet in May, this means
that Oxy must bear the hrimt of the Indians' revenge in the inline
diale future —Saturday, for example.
Actually, Ihe Stanford cause isn't as hopeless as it may seem
from just a quick look at comparative scores against UCLA. Oxy
is plenty weak in all three weight events. Stanford should take the
discus, javelin and shot put all by 8-1 scores.
Of course the Tigers must he conceded a sweep in the mile ami
a raft of points in the XXO, but then the Indians should come back
with 1-2 finishes in both hurdles races. Oxy will probably also
sweep the pole vault, hut shouldn't get better than three points in
either the high jump or broad jump.
The keys to the meet are probably Ihe sprints and 440. If Chesa- I
rek wins the quarter and Herrmann gets second in the two dashes, |
as both should, Stanford will be in good shape. As it looks from j
here, the meet may come down to the relay. In this event, there's !
no telling what will happen. But one thing's for sure the Indians |
are plenty mad and ready to go after the Tigers.
Stanford's crew the team which has to work to help pay its
•equipment arid transportation expenses is sponsoring a program to
morrow in Mem Aud to help buy new shells and pay the varsity's
way to the IRA regatta in Syracuse.
Knoll Garner, renowned modern jazz pianist, will be the high
light of (Ik* 4:15 show. If you're a jit/./ fan, you'll get more than

The word from down south is that Occidental is looking forward
to a real picnic on the remains of the Stanford track team this
Saturday in Stanford Stadium. Oxy was looking on while the Tribe
was getting murdered by UCLA, and now has it all figured out as
to how they can score 90 points or over.
Chock Coker's Tigers have thc\jdca that I hey will sweep the
100, 220 and 440 from the Indians.' There's no doubt that they're
strong in the quarter, with Dennis Bamhaucr (4<S 3), John Zetz
man (IS I) and Pat Logan (48.5). Hut, on the other hand, Stan
lord does have a man named Don Chesarek who has run 47.7 this
season.
Oxy has a good sprinter, 100. Rudy Alston is unbeaten this year,
and has turned in clockings of 9.8 and 21.5. They have supporting
strength, also, in the persons of Stu Thomason <9.9i, Mike Quint
(10.0) and Bambauer (21.4). But Payton Jordan has Frank Herr
mann entered for the Tribe in both of these races, and he has run
9.fl and 20.9. Chesarek and Herrmann just don't appear to bo the
type who are going to be swept.
The Tigers also have a shot putter, Dave Goodenough, who thinks
he's good enough to win his event. He's put the 16-pound ball some
48 feet six inches this year, only about three feel less tharr the In
dians' Ray Williamson and Chris Plain.
Probably the event in which the Tigers have the most right to
claim victory is the pole vault. The principal question centered
around the vault is not sv> much whether or not Bob Gutowski will
win as whether or not he will break the world's record.
Gutowski has been flirting with Cornelius Warmerdam's mark
of 15-7% for almost a year, and has been coming closer almost every
meet. The Oxy ace has set a 1957 deadline to make the world mark
his.
He says he picked up a lot of little pointers on recent European
tours and at the Olympics in Melbourne. But probably most impor
tant of all, Gutowski has attained a casual approach to his vaulting
in place of his previous tenseness. He now likes to play tennis the*
flay before a meet to take his mind off the upcoming competition.
Record-holder Warmerdam has predicted that Gutowski will
break his mark this year, lie says that Gutowski "has the speed,
the strength and the ideal build for vaulting. He also has good
spring. I couldn't broad jump over 21 feet, hut he's gone (lose to
24." Rube Saniuelsen of the Pasadena Star-News says Gutowski
will have one of his best chances for 16 -feet when Oxy invades 1
Stanford, because "the Indians' pit is regarded as one of the best
in the country." Conditions being right, Stanford Stadium may
well he the scene of the breaking of one of trackc'om's oldest world
records.
Oxy may lie nice and confident (maybe OVER-confiden*) for Sat
urday's meet, but Stanford isn't exactly planning to take things
lying down. Jordan's men are plenty burned up about their miser
able showing against UCLA. There were a few, like Maury Graves,
who looked good, but on a whole the team was lousy, and it knows it.
Besides just losing, the Indians didn't like having to listen to
some of the cracks the Oxy team was making from the stands, nor
to some of the things the Bruin fans and team members were saying
during the course of the meet.

in place of his previous tenseness. He now likes to play tennis the*
flay before a meet to take his mind off the upcoming competition.
Record-holder Warmerdam has predicted that Gutowski will
break his mark this year, lie says that Gutowski "has the speed,
the strength and the ideal build for vaulting. He also has good
spring. I couldn't broad jump over 21 feet, hut he's gone (lose to
24." Rube Saniuelsen of the Pasadena Star-News says Gutowski
will have one of his best chances for 16 -feet when Oxy invades 1
Stanford, because "the Indians' pit is regarded as one of the best
in the country." Conditions being right, Stanford Stadium may
well he the scene of the breaking of one of trackc'om's oldest world
records.
Oxy may lie nice and confident (maybe OVER-confiden*) for Sat
urday's meet, but Stanford isn't exactly planning to take things
lying down. Jordan's men are plenty burned up about their miser
able showing against UCLA. There were a few, like Maury Graves,
who looked good, but on a whole the team was lousy, and it knows it.
Besides just losing, the Indians didn't like having to listen to
some of the cracks the Oxy team was making from the stands, nor
to some of the things the Bruin fans and team members were saying
during the course of the meet.
Stanford means to get back at their tormentors. Since if won't
lie meeting UCLA again until the PCC meet in May, this means
that Oxy must bear the hrimt of the Indians' revenge in the inline
diale future —Saturday, for example.
Actually, Ihe Stanford cause isn't as hopeless as it may seem
from just a quick look at comparative scores against UCLA. Oxy
is plenty weak in all three weight events. Stanford should take the
discus, javelin and shot put all by 8-1 scores.
Of course the Tigers must he conceded a sweep in the mile ami
a raft of points in the XXO, but then the Indians should come back
with 1-2 finishes in both hurdles races. Oxy will probably also
sweep the pole vault, hut shouldn't get better than three points in
either the high jump or broad jump.
The keys to the meet are probably Ihe sprints and 440. If Chesa- I
rek wins the quarter and Herrmann gets second in the two dashes, |
as both should, Stanford will be in good shape. As it looks from j
here, the meet may come down to the relay. In this event, there's !
no telling what will happen. But one thing's for sure the Indians |
are plenty mad and ready to go after the Tigers.
Stanford's crew the team which has to work to help pay its
•equipment arid transportation expenses is sponsoring a program to
morrow in Mem Aud to help buy new shells and pay the varsity's
way to the IRA regatta in Syracuse.
Knoll Garner, renowned modern jazz pianist, will be the high
light of (Ik* 4:15 show. If you're a jit/./ fan, you'll get more than
your money's worth from hearing Garner; if you're a sports fan,
you'll know your money's going to a really worthwhile cause;
if you're both, well, then you have no excuse for not attending.
The crew hopes to have a full house at Mem Aud tomorrow, so
be sure to be on hand early for an entertaining show.
The word from down south is that Occidental is looking forward
to a real picnic on the remains of the Stanford track team this
Saturday in Stanford Stadium. Oxy was looking on while the Tribe
was getting murdered by UCLA, and now has it all figured out as
to how they can score 90 points or over.
Chock Coker's Tigers have thc\jdca that I hey will sweep the
100, 220 and 440 from the Indians.' There's no doubt that they're
strong in the quarter, with Dennis Bamhaucr (4<S 3), John Zetz
man (IS I) and Pat Logan (48.5). Hut, on the other hand, Stan
lord does have a man named Don Chesarek who has run 47.7 this
season.
Oxy has a good sprinter, 100. Rudy Alston is unbeaten this year,
and has turned in clockings of 9.8 and 21.5. They have supporting
strength, also, in the persons of Stu Thomason <9.9i, Mike Quint
(10.0) and Bambauer (21.4). But Payton Jordan has Frank Herr
mann entered for the Tribe in both of these races, and he has run
9.fl and 20.9. Chesarek and Herrmann just don't appear to bo the
type who are going to be swept.
The Tigers also have a shot putter, Dave Goodenough, who thinks
he's good enough to win his event. He's put the 16-pound ball some
48 feet six inches this year, only about three feel less tharr the In
dians' Ray Williamson and Chris Plain.
Probably the event in which the Tigers have the most right to
claim victory is the pole vault. The principal question centered
around the vault is not sv> much whether or not Bob Gutowski will
win as whether or not he will break the world's record.
Gutowski has been flirting with Cornelius Warmerdam's mark
of 15-7% for almost a year, and has been coming closer almost every
meet. The Oxy ace has set a 1957 deadline to make the world mark
his.
He says he picked up a lot of little pointers on recent European
tours and at the Olympics in Melbourne. But probably most impor
tant of all, Gutowski has attained a casual approach to his vaulting
in place of his previous tenseness. He now likes to play tennis the*
