# Justice Attorney Resigns Charging 'Clique Control'
## Quits Anti-Trust Following Row Over Major Oil Company Case 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 24 (UP)â€”Horace L. Flurry, a top-ranking
Justice Department attorney, today charged that "clique control"
in the department's anti-trust division forced him to resign.
Flurry, who had been with the anti-trust division 15 years, said
he quit after a row with his superiors over the department's han-

filing of a federal grand jury in
vestigation of possible anti-trust
violations by major oil companies.
He submitted a six-page letter
of resignation to Attorney Gen
eral Herbert Brownell, Jr., April
16. In it he charged that the gov
ernment gave "the impression" it
was on a "fishing expedition"
when it brought the case before
the grand jury.
"Gesture" Too I,ate
Flurry told the United Press
that two hours before quitting
time Friday, his last day at the
department, Assistant Attorney
General Victor Hansen called him
"to discuss the matter." But Flur
ry said the "gesture" came too
late.
His resignation was accepted by
Hansen in a letter to Flurry dated
today. Hansen told Flurry his de
cision was "regrettable" in view
of his long years of service, but
that he had no other choice but
to accept it.
In 1952 Flurry was placed in
charge of an investigation of pos
sible price fixing and other anti
trust violations by oil companies.
He laid the groundwork for the
inquiry and headed a seven-man
team of lawyers when the grand
jury investigation began in Alex
andria, Va., March 4.
"Superiors Interfered"
Flurry said he was removed
from the assignment a week later
after he wrote a memo to his su
perior. Worthy Rowley, chief of
the trial section. He said his su
periors constantly interfered with
his handling of the case, after he
had been assured he was in
charge.
When he requested a transfer
on April 1 to the transportation
division, Flurry said Rowley
warned him in writing that his
"professional performance is re
garded as unsatisfactory." Flurry
i said he decided t hen to resign,
I "with no regrets."
