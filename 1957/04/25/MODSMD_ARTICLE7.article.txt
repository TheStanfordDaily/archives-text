# Bookstore Report To Be Presented By ASSU Group
## 
### 
The ASSU Bookstore committee
report should be presented to the
store's hoard of directors at the
end of this week or the first of
next, according to ASSU presi
dent Robert Freelen.
The Bookstore committee was
conceived fall quarter in order to
study the possibility of bringing
the Bookstore under control of
the University administration.
Purpose of this would be to use
the store's profits as a source of
revenue for the construction fund
of the proposed Tresldder Memo
rial Union and other student pur
poses. Freelen said student re
bates would not be affected by
the change.
At present, the Bookstore is a
corporation chartered by the state
of California and governed b.v a
board of directors, meeting once a
month, and a board of governors,
which meets once a year "to ap
prove the actions of the board of
directors," Freelen said.
As a corporation, net profits
after rebates are distributed to
students are taxable under fed
eral law. One of the purposes of
the merger would be to make the
profits not subject to taxation.
Federal taxes last year amounted
to about SIS.(XM).
