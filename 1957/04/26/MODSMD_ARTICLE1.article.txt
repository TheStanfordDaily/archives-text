# Oxy Trackmen Here Tomorrow
## 
### Dick Barnes 
"I don't care if they double,
triple or run the coach; we'll still
beat 'em," exclaimed Payton Jor
dan, referring to tomorrow's dual
track and field meet between his
Stanford Indians and the Occi
dental Tigers at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Jordan added, "I'm sick and
tired of the things we've had to
take from those guys. I sincerely
believe we're going to win, and
the team knows darn well we're
going to win. I don't have a pes
ismistic bone in my body."
Stanford Mad
Stanford is mad—plenty mad —
about their poor showing against
UCLA last Monday, and the In
dians are out to make up for that
performance in a meet tomorrow
which could be the year's best.
A crowd of over 10,000 is ex
pected, including more than 600
fans from Occidental.

Both teams have great depth
and strength in some events but
are weak in others, making sev
eral sweeps likely. If this is the
case, then probably the three
short races—loo, 220 and 440—
will be the day's key events.

Admission to tlie Stanford-
Occidental track meet will be
free to Stanford students with
student-body cards.

Jordan will send Stanford co
captain Frank Herrmann out af
ter Oxy's Rudy Alston in the two
dashes. Alston is undefeated this
season, but hasn't met any really
top-flight competition. A victory
by Herrmann in either race
would give the Tribe an extra
point cushion to balance against
Oxy's strength in the 880, mile
and pole vault.
Don Chesarek and the Tiger

trio of Dennis Bambauer, John
Zetzman and Pat Logan figure to
stage a battle royal in the quar
ter-mile. But if Chesarek runs as
he did against USC's Tom Ander
son two weeks ago, he should
come home in front.
Probably the greatest field
event interest will be centered
about Bob Gutowski's assault on
the world's pole vault record.
He's given an excellent chance to
crack Cornelius Warmerdam's
15-7% standard, which he has
narrowly missed several times
this season.
The Indians will have to score
heavily in the remaining five
field events if they are to whip
Chuck Coker's Occidental crew.
The Tigers are weak in the three
weight events and could be held
to three points in them.
Favored in Discus
Fred Peters is a heavy favorite
to win the discus for the Indians

since he has thrown 25 feet far
ther than any Oxy flinger. In
the javelin it's almost the same
story, with Hank Roldan far
ahead of all competitors.
The shot put is the most un
predictable of the weights. Ray
Williamson and Chris Plain of
the Tribe both have far better
marks than Dave Goodenough of
the Tigers, but the Oxy man is
considered to be throwing far be
low his potential this year. Still,
the nod must be given to William
son and Plain to go 1-2 for the
Indians.
Stanford looks good for six
points in each of the jumping
events.
Herrmann has gone nearly a
foot farther than Gutowski, the
best Oxy broad jumper. Fehlen
ranks nearly three inches above
the Tigers' Dick Haddon in the
high jump. And Haddon has a

reputation for falling apart in
big meets.
Kent Hansen and Ron Bondoc
will be out to get valuable upset
seconds for the Indians in the
broad jump and high jump.
Shot l'ut Sweep
Kirk N ie 1a n d and Archie
Schmitt are Jordan's hopes for
the runner-up spots in the javelin
and discus. Schmitt could also
move in for a Stanford sweep in
the shot put.
Chuck Cobb stands head and
shoulders above anyone else in
either hurdle race. Monday
against UCLA, he finished back
in third place after clobbering
several hurdles, but he isn't about
to let it happen again. Bernie
Nelson in the highs and Leonard
Bates in the lows are Stanford's
best bets for runner-up honors
in the stick races.
Nelson, however, has the slight


CO-CAPTAIN PHIL FEHLEN SETS SC HOOL MARK IN HIGH JUMP
ly better chance to get his second.
Hates must best Oxy's Stu Thorn
ason, a fairly good low - barrier
man. Back in Ihe highs, Stanford
could go 1-2-3 if Bob Newman can
out race Oxy's Walt Williamson.
Two-Mile Duel
Best long race of the day may
bp the two-mile duel between
Maury Graves of Stanford and
John Kerr of Occidental. Graves
snapped out of his flu-caused
slump Monday with a sparkling
9:15.4 performance against UC
LA. Kerr, too, had his best race
against the Bruins, when he ran
9: 19.4.
Jordan is juggling his distance
forces a bit, moving Doug Martin
up to the two-mile and bringing
Bob Van Luchene down to the
mile. Don Richardson will also
be added to the mile field, with
Graves sitting out the shorter
race. Richardson has previously
run only the 880.
Occidental's two strongest run
ning events are the half-mile and
mile. In the latter race, they look
almost certain to take all three
places. Larry Wray has the best
lime of the Oxy crew, 4:10.8, but
Ty Hadley, 4:11.3, will be favored
to win.
Four-Minute Mile
Coker has said that Hadley will
be Ihe first American to run un
der four minutes for the mile,
hut he still has a long way to go.
Either Dave Reisbord or Tod
White, both only a few seconds
behind Wray and Hadley, will
run in spot for Oxy.
Reisbord is the choice in the
880, with Hadley likely to be close
behind. Stanford's Joe Woollett
will be in the thick of the fight
also, along with either Wray or
Bill Reay of the Tigers.
If Ihe meet goes down to the
relay, Oxy will hold a slight edge.
Their quartet of Bob Nini, Lo
gan, Zetzman and Bambauer has
run 3:13.5, two and one-half sec
onds better than Ihe Indian team
of Hill Carls, Bob Hyde, Jim Eas
ter and Chesarek. Tomorrow,
however, Jordan expects to use
Woollen in place of Easter.
Record Smash
A whole flock of meet records
are in danger of being smashed.
Men entered in the meet have
already this season equaled or
surpassed marks in the 220, 440,
880, mile, Iwo-mile, high hurdles,
low hurdles, javelin, high jump,
pole vault, broad jump, discus
and mile relay.
Only the 100-yard dash stand
ard (9.7) and the shot put rec
ord (54-10% ) appear beyond
reach of tomorrow's competitors.
Stanford and Occidental first
met in 1914, with the Indians win
ning 97-16. The series wasn't re
newed until 1951, but the teams
have met every year since then.
Stanford won in 1952 and 1953.
Occidental has won the remain
ing four meets. Closest battle was
in 1955, when the Tigers won, 66-
65.
Not only will tomorrow's com
petition be of the highest caliber,
but the meet will once again be
conducted in spectator - pleasing
fashion.
All of the innovations used in
Ihe USC-Stanford meet, including
numbers worn by all runners,
field event name placards and a
common finish line for all races,
will be seen again tomorrow.
Ed Pierce, the announcer who
did such an excellent job of keep
ing fans informed at the USC
meet, will be imported from Los
Angeles to handle the public ad
dress system.
Admission will be free for
Stanford students.

in 1955, when the Tigers won, 66-
65.
Not only will tomorrow's com
petition be of the highest caliber,
but the meet will once again be
conducted in spectator - pleasing
fashion.
All of the innovations used in
Ihe USC-Stanford meet, including
numbers worn by all runners,
field event name placards and a
common finish line for all races,
will be seen again tomorrow.
Ed Pierce, the announcer who
did such an excellent job of keep
ing fans informed at the USC
meet, will be imported from Los
Angeles to handle the public ad
dress system.
Admission will be free for
Stanford students.
"I don't care if they double,
triple or run the coach; we'll still
beat 'em," exclaimed Payton Jor
dan, referring to tomorrow's dual
track and field meet between his
Stanford Indians and the Occi
dental Tigers at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Jordan added, "I'm sick and
tired of the things we've had to
take from those guys. I sincerely
believe we're going to win, and
the team knows darn well we're
going to win. I don't have a pes
ismistic bone in my body."
Stanford Mad
Stanford is mad—plenty mad —
about their poor showing against
UCLA last Monday, and the In
dians are out to make up for that
performance in a meet tomorrow
which could be the year's best.
A crowd of over 10,000 is ex
pected, including more than 600
fans from Occidental.

Both teams have great depth
and strength in some events but
are weak in others, making sev
eral sweeps likely. If this is the
case, then probably the three
short races—loo, 220 and 440—
will be the day's key events.

Admission to tlie Stanford-
Occidental track meet will be
free to Stanford students with
student-body cards.

Jordan will send Stanford co
captain Frank Herrmann out af
ter Oxy's Rudy Alston in the two
dashes. Alston is undefeated this
season, but hasn't met any really
top-flight competition. A victory
by Herrmann in either race
would give the Tribe an extra
point cushion to balance against
Oxy's strength in the 880, mile
and pole vault.
Don Chesarek and the Tiger

trio of Dennis Bambauer, John
Zetzman and Pat Logan figure to
stage a battle royal in the quar
ter-mile. But if Chesarek runs as
he did against USC's Tom Ander
son two weeks ago, he should
come home in front.
Probably the greatest field
event interest will be centered
about Bob Gutowski's assault on
the world's pole vault record.
He's given an excellent chance to
crack Cornelius Warmerdam's
15-7% standard, which he has
narrowly missed several times
this season.
The Indians will have to score
heavily in the remaining five
field events if they are to whip
Chuck Coker's Occidental crew.
The Tigers are weak in the three
weight events and could be held
to three points in them.
Favored in Discus
Fred Peters is a heavy favorite
to win the discus for the Indians

since he has thrown 25 feet far
ther than any Oxy flinger. In
the javelin it's almost the same
story, with Hank Roldan far
ahead of all competitors.
The shot put is the most un
predictable of the weights. Ray
Williamson and Chris Plain of
the Tribe both have far better
marks than Dave Goodenough of
the Tigers, but the Oxy man is
considered to be throwing far be
low his potential this year. Still,
the nod must be given to William
son and Plain to go 1-2 for the
Indians.
Stanford looks good for six
points in each of the jumping
events.
Herrmann has gone nearly a
foot farther than Gutowski, the
best Oxy broad jumper. Fehlen
ranks nearly three inches above
the Tigers' Dick Haddon in the
high jump. And Haddon has a

reputation for falling apart in
big meets.
Kent Hansen and Ron Bondoc
will be out to get valuable upset
seconds for the Indians in the
broad jump and high jump.
Shot l'ut Sweep
Kirk N ie 1a n d and Archie
Schmitt are Jordan's hopes for
the runner-up spots in the javelin
and discus. Schmitt could also
move in for a Stanford sweep in
the shot put.
Chuck Cobb stands head and
shoulders above anyone else in
either hurdle race. Monday
against UCLA, he finished back
in third place after clobbering
several hurdles, but he isn't about
to let it happen again. Bernie
Nelson in the highs and Leonard
Bates in the lows are Stanford's
best bets for runner-up honors
in the stick races.
Nelson, however, has the slight


CO-CAPTAIN PHIL FEHLEN SETS SC HOOL MARK IN HIGH JUMP
ly better chance to get his second.
Hates must best Oxy's Stu Thorn
ason, a fairly good low - barrier
man. Back in Ihe highs, Stanford
could go 1-2-3 if Bob Newman can
out race Oxy's Walt Williamson.
Two-Mile Duel
Best long race of the day may
bp the two-mile duel between
Maury Graves of Stanford and
John Kerr of Occidental. Graves
snapped out of his flu-caused
slump Monday with a sparkling
9:15.4 performance against UC
LA. Kerr, too, had his best race
against the Bruins, when he ran
9: 19.4.
Jordan is juggling his distance
forces a bit, moving Doug Martin
up to the two-mile and bringing
Bob Van Luchene down to the
mile. Don Richardson will also
be added to the mile field, with
Graves sitting out the shorter
race. Richardson has previously
run only the 880.
Occidental's two strongest run
ning events are the half-mile and
mile. In the latter race, they look
almost certain to take all three
places. Larry Wray has the best
lime of the Oxy crew, 4:10.8, but
Ty Hadley, 4:11.3, will be favored
to win.
Four-Minute Mile
Coker has said that Hadley will
be Ihe first American to run un
der four minutes for the mile,
hut he still has a long way to go.
Either Dave Reisbord or Tod
White, both only a few seconds
behind Wray and Hadley, will
run in spot for Oxy.
Reisbord is the choice in the
880, with Hadley likely to be close
behind. Stanford's Joe Woollett
will be in the thick of the fight
also, along with either Wray or
Bill Reay of the Tigers.
If Ihe meet goes down to the
relay, Oxy will hold a slight edge.
Their quartet of Bob Nini, Lo
gan, Zetzman and Bambauer has
run 3:13.5, two and one-half sec
onds better than Ihe Indian team
of Hill Carls, Bob Hyde, Jim Eas
ter and Chesarek. Tomorrow,
however, Jordan expects to use
Woollen in place of Easter.
Record Smash
A whole flock of meet records
are in danger of being smashed.
Men entered in the meet have
already this season equaled or
surpassed marks in the 220, 440,
880, mile, Iwo-mile, high hurdles,
low hurdles, javelin, high jump,
pole vault, broad jump, discus
and mile relay.
Only the 100-yard dash stand
ard (9.7) and the shot put rec
ord (54-10% ) appear beyond
reach of tomorrow's competitors.
Stanford and Occidental first
met in 1914, with the Indians win
ning 97-16. The series wasn't re
newed until 1951, but the teams
have met every year since then.
Stanford won in 1952 and 1953.
Occidental has won the remain

880, mile, Iwo-mile, high hurdles,
low hurdles, javelin, high jump,
pole vault, broad jump, discus
and mile relay.
Only the 100-yard dash stand
ard (9.7) and the shot put rec
ord (54-10% ) appear beyond
reach of tomorrow's competitors.
Stanford and Occidental first
met in 1914, with the Indians win
ning 97-16. The series wasn't re
newed until 1951, but the teams
have met every year since then.
Stanford won in 1952 and 1953.
Occidental has won the remain
ing four meets. Closest battle was
in 1955, when the Tigers won, 66-
65.
Not only will tomorrow's com
petition be of the highest caliber,
but the meet will once again be
conducted in spectator - pleasing
fashion.
All of the innovations used in
Ihe USC-Stanford meet, including
numbers worn by all runners,
field event name placards and a

"I don't care if they double,
triple or run the coach; we'll still
beat 'em," exclaimed Payton Jor
dan, referring to tomorrow's dual
track and field meet between his
Stanford Indians and the Occi
dental Tigers at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Jordan added, "I'm sick and
tired of the things we've had to
take from those guys. I sincerely

the team knows darn well we're
going to win. I don't have a pes

Stanford Mad
Stanford is mad—plenty mad —
about their poor showing against
UCLA last Monday, and the In
dians are out to make up for that
performance in a meet tomorrow
which could be the year's best.
A crowd of over 10,000 is ex
pected, including more than 600
fans from Occidental.

Both teams have great depth
and strength in some events but
are weak in others, making sev
eral sweeps likely. If this is the
case, then probably the three
short races—loo, 220 and 440—
will be the day's key events.

Admission to tlie Stanford-
Occidental track meet will be
free to Stanford students with
student-body cards.

Jordan will send Stanford co
captain Frank Herrmann out af
ter Oxy's Rudy Alston in the two
dashes. Alston is undefeated this
season, but hasn't met any really
top-flight competition. A victory
by Herrmann in either race
would give the Tribe an extra
point cushion to balance against
Oxy's strength in the 880, mile
and pole vault.
Don Chesarek and the Tiger

trio of Dennis Bambauer, John
Zetzman and Pat Logan figure to
stage a battle royal in the quar
ter-mile. But if Chesarek runs as
he did against USC's Tom Ander
son two weeks ago, he should
come home in front.
Probably the greatest field
event interest will be centered
about Bob Gutowski's assault on
the world's pole vault record.
He's given an excellent chance to
crack Cornelius Warmerdam's
15-7% standard, which he has
narrowly missed several times
this season.
The Indians will have to score
heavily in the remaining five
field events if they are to whip
Chuck Coker's Occidental crew.
The Tigers are weak in the three
weight events and could be held
to three points in them.
Favored in Discus
Fred Peters is a heavy favorite
to win the discus for the Indians

since he has thrown 25 feet far
ther than any Oxy flinger. In
the javelin it's almost the same
story, with Hank Roldan far
ahead of all competitors.
The shot put is the most un
predictable of the weights. Ray
Williamson and Chris Plain of
the Tribe both have far better
marks than Dave Goodenough of
the Tigers, but the Oxy man is
considered to be throwing far be
low his potential this year. Still,
the nod must be given to William
son and Plain to go 1-2 for the
Indians.
Stanford looks good for six
points in each of the jumping
events.
Herrmann has gone nearly a
foot farther than Gutowski, the
best Oxy broad jumper. Fehlen
ranks nearly three inches above
the Tigers' Dick Haddon in the
high jump. And Haddon has a

reputation for falling apart in
big meets.
Kent Hansen and Ron Bondoc
will be out to get valuable upset
seconds for the Indians in the
broad jump and high jump.
Shot l'ut Sweep
Kirk N ie 1a n d and Archie
Schmitt are Jordan's hopes for
the runner-up spots in the javelin
and discus. Schmitt could also
move in for a Stanford sweep in
the shot put.
Chuck Cobb stands head and
shoulders above anyone else in
either hurdle race. Monday
against UCLA, he finished back
in third place after clobbering
several hurdles, but he isn't about
to let it happen again. Bernie
Nelson in the highs and Leonard
Bates in the lows are Stanford's
best bets for runner-up honors
in the stick races.
Nelson, however, has the slight


CO-CAPTAIN PHIL FEHLEN SETS SC HOOL MARK IN HIGH JUMP
ly better chance to get his second.
Hates must best Oxy's Stu Thorn
ason, a fairly good low - barrier
man. Back in Ihe highs, Stanford
could go 1-2-3 if Bob Newman can
out race Oxy's Walt Williamson.
Two-Mile Duel
Best long race of the day may
bp the two-mile duel between
Maury Graves of Stanford and
John Kerr of Occidental. Graves
snapped out of his flu-caused
slump Monday with a sparkling
9:15.4 performance against UC
LA. Kerr, too, had his best race
against the Bruins, when he ran
9: 19.4.
Jordan is juggling his distance
forces a bit, moving Doug Martin
up to the two-mile and bringing
Bob Van Luchene down to the
mile. Don Richardson will also
be added to the mile field, with
Graves sitting out the shorter
race. Richardson has previously
run only the 880.
Occidental's two strongest run
ning events are the half-mile and
mile. In the latter race, they look
almost certain to take all three
places. Larry Wray has the best
lime of the Oxy crew, 4:10.8, but
Ty Hadley, 4:11.3, will be favored
to win.
Four-Minute Mile
Coker has said that Hadley will
be Ihe first American to run un
der four minutes for the mile,
hut he still has a long way to go.
Either Dave Reisbord or Tod
White, both only a few seconds
behind Wray and Hadley, will
run in spot for Oxy.
Reisbord is the choice in the
880, with Hadley likely to be close
behind. Stanford's Joe Woollett
will be in the thick of the fight
also, along with either Wray or
Bill Reay of the Tigers.
If Ihe meet goes down to the
relay, Oxy will hold a slight edge.
Their quartet of Bob Nini, Lo
gan, Zetzman and Bambauer has
run 3:13.5, two and one-half sec
onds better than Ihe Indian team
of Hill Carls, Bob Hyde, Jim Eas
ter and Chesarek. Tomorrow,
however, Jordan expects to use
Woollen in place of Easter.
Record Smash
A whole flock of meet records
are in danger of being smashed.
Men entered in the meet have
already this season equaled or
surpassed marks in the 220, 440,
880, mile, Iwo-mile, high hurdles,

also, along with either Wray or
Bill Reay of the Tigers.
If Ihe meet goes down to the
relay, Oxy will hold a slight edge.
Their quartet of Bob Nini, Lo

run 3:13.5, two and one-half sec
onds better than Ihe Indian team
of Hill Carls, Bob Hyde, Jim Eas

however, Jordan expects to use
Woollen in place of Easter.
Record Smash
A whole flock of meet records
are in danger of being smashed.
Men entered in the meet have
already this season equaled or
surpassed marks in the 220, 440,
880, mile, Iwo-mile, high hurdles,
low hurdles, javelin, high jump,
pole vault, broad jump, discus
and mile relay.
Only the 100-yard dash stand
ard (9.7) and the shot put rec
ord (54-10% ) appear beyond
reach of tomorrow's competitors.
Stanford and Occidental first
met in 1914, with the Indians win
ning 97-16. The series wasn't re
newed until 1951, but the teams
have met every year since then.
Stanford won in 1952 and 1953.
Occidental has won the remain
ing four meets. Closest battle was
in 1955, when the Tigers won, 66-
65.
Not only will tomorrow's com
petition be of the highest caliber,
but the meet will once again be
conducted in spectator - pleasing
fashion.
All of the innovations used in
Ihe USC-Stanford meet, including
numbers worn by all runners,
field event name placards and a
common finish line for all races,
will be seen again tomorrow.
Ed Pierce, the announcer who
did such an excellent job of keep
ing fans informed at the USC
meet, will be imported from Los
Angeles to handle the public ad
dress system.
Admission will be free for
Stanford students.
"I don't care if they double,
triple or run the coach; we'll still
beat 'em," exclaimed Payton Jor
dan, referring to tomorrow's dual
track and field meet between his
Stanford Indians and the Occi
dental Tigers at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Jordan added, "I'm sick and
tired of the things we've had to
take from those guys. I sincerely
believe we're going to win, and
the team knows darn well we're
going to win. I don't have a pes
ismistic bone in my body."
Stanford Mad
Stanford is mad—plenty mad —
about their poor showing against
UCLA last Monday, and the In
dians are out to make up for that
performance in a meet tomorrow
which could be the year's best.
A crowd of over 10,000 is ex
pected, including more than 600
fans from Occidental.

Both teams have great depth
and strength in some events but
are weak in others, making sev
eral sweeps likely. If this is the
case, then probably the three
short races—loo, 220 and 440—
will be the day's key events.

Admission to tlie Stanford-
Occidental track meet will be
free to Stanford students with
student-body cards.

Jordan will send Stanford co
captain Frank Herrmann out af
ter Oxy's Rudy Alston in the two
dashes. Alston is undefeated this
season, but hasn't met any really
top-flight competition. A victory
by Herrmann in either race
would give the Tribe an extra
point cushion to balance against
Oxy's strength in the 880, mile
and pole vault.
Don Chesarek and the Tiger

trio of Dennis Bambauer, John
Zetzman and Pat Logan figure to
stage a battle royal in the quar
ter-mile. But if Chesarek runs as
he did against USC's Tom Ander
son two weeks ago, he should
come home in front.
Probably the greatest field
event interest will be centered
about Bob Gutowski's assault on
the world's pole vault record.
He's given an excellent chance to
crack Cornelius Warmerdam's
15-7% standard, which he has
narrowly missed several times
this season.
The Indians will have to score
heavily in the remaining five
field events if they are to whip
Chuck Coker's Occidental crew.
The Tigers are weak in the three
weight events and could be held
to three points in them.
Favored in Discus
Fred Peters is a heavy favorite
to win the discus for the Indians

since he has thrown 25 feet far
ther than any Oxy flinger. In
the javelin it's almost the same
story, with Hank Roldan far
ahead of all competitors.
The shot put is the most un
predictable of the weights. Ray
Williamson and Chris Plain of
the Tribe both have far better
marks than Dave Goodenough of
the Tigers, but the Oxy man is
considered to be throwing far be
low his potential this year. Still,
the nod must be given to William
son and Plain to go 1-2 for the
Indians.
Stanford looks good for six
points in each of the jumping
events.
Herrmann has gone nearly a
foot farther than Gutowski, the
best Oxy broad jumper. Fehlen
ranks nearly three inches above
the Tigers' Dick Haddon in the
high jump. And Haddon has a

reputation for falling apart in
big meets.
Kent Hansen and Ron Bondoc
will be out to get valuable upset
seconds for the Indians in the
broad jump and high jump.
Shot l'ut Sweep
Kirk N ie 1a n d and Archie
Schmitt are Jordan's hopes for
the runner-up spots in the javelin
and discus. Schmitt could also
move in for a Stanford sweep in
the shot put.
Chuck Cobb stands head and
shoulders above anyone else in
either hurdle race. Monday
against UCLA, he finished back
in third place after clobbering
several hurdles, but he isn't about
to let it happen again. Bernie
Nelson in the highs and Leonard
Bates in the lows are Stanford's
best bets for runner-up honors
in the stick races.
Nelson, however, has the slight


CO-CAPTAIN PHIL FEHLEN SETS SC HOOL MARK IN HIGH JUMP
ly better chance to get his second.
Hates must best Oxy's Stu Thorn
ason, a fairly good low - barrier
man. Back in Ihe highs, Stanford
could go 1-2-3 if Bob Newman can
out race Oxy's Walt Williamson.
Two-Mile Duel
Best long race of the day may
bp the two-mile duel between
Maury Graves of Stanford and
John Kerr of Occidental. Graves
snapped out of his flu-caused
slump Monday with a sparkling
9:15.4 performance against UC
LA. Kerr, too, had his best race
against the Bruins, when he ran
9: 19.4.
Jordan is juggling his distance
forces a bit, moving Doug Martin
up to the two-mile and bringing
Bob Van Luchene down to the
mile. Don Richardson will also
be added to the mile field, with
Graves sitting out the shorter
race. Richardson has previously
run only the 880.
Occidental's two strongest run
ning events are the half-mile and
mile. In the latter race, they look
almost certain to take all three
places. Larry Wray has the best
lime of the Oxy crew, 4:10.8, but
Ty Hadley, 4:11.3, will be favored
to win.
Four-Minute Mile
Coker has said that Hadley will
be Ihe first American to run un
der four minutes for the mile,
hut he still has a long way to go.
Either Dave Reisbord or Tod
White, both only a few seconds
behind Wray and Hadley, will
run in spot for Oxy.
Reisbord is the choice in the
880, with Hadley likely to be close
behind. Stanford's Joe Woollett
will be in the thick of the fight
also, along with either Wray or
Bill Reay of the Tigers.
If Ihe meet goes down to the
relay, Oxy will hold a slight edge.
Their quartet of Bob Nini, Lo
gan, Zetzman and Bambauer has
run 3:13.5, two and one-half sec

almost certain to take all three
places. Larry Wray has the best
lime of the Oxy crew, 4:10.8, but
Ty Hadley, 4:11.3, will be favored
to win.
Four-Minute Mile
Coker has said that Hadley will
be Ihe first American to run un
der four minutes for the mile,
hut he still has a long way to go.
Either Dave Reisbord or Tod
White, both only a few seconds
behind Wray and Hadley, will
run in spot for Oxy.
Reisbord is the choice in the
880, with Hadley likely to be close
behind. Stanford's Joe Woollett
will be in the thick of the fight
also, along with either Wray or
Bill Reay of the Tigers.
If Ihe meet goes down to the
relay, Oxy will hold a slight edge.
Their quartet of Bob Nini, Lo
gan, Zetzman and Bambauer has
run 3:13.5, two and one-half sec
onds better than Ihe Indian team
of Hill Carls, Bob Hyde, Jim Eas
ter and Chesarek. Tomorrow,
however, Jordan expects to use
Woollen in place of Easter.
Record Smash
A whole flock of meet records
are in danger of being smashed.
Men entered in the meet have
already this season equaled or
surpassed marks in the 220, 440,
880, mile, Iwo-mile, high hurdles,
low hurdles, javelin, high jump,
pole vault, broad jump, discus
and mile relay.
Only the 100-yard dash stand
ard (9.7) and the shot put rec
ord (54-10% ) appear beyond
reach of tomorrow's competitors.
Stanford and Occidental first
met in 1914, with the Indians win
ning 97-16. The series wasn't re
newed until 1951, but the teams
have met every year since then.
Stanford won in 1952 and 1953.
Occidental has won the remain
ing four meets. Closest battle was
in 1955, when the Tigers won, 66-
65.
Not only will tomorrow's com
petition be of the highest caliber,
but the meet will once again be
conducted in spectator - pleasing
fashion.
All of the innovations used in
Ihe USC-Stanford meet, including
numbers worn by all runners,
field event name placards and a
common finish line for all races,
will be seen again tomorrow.
Ed Pierce, the announcer who
did such an excellent job of keep
ing fans informed at the USC
meet, will be imported from Los
Angeles to handle the public ad
dress system.
Admission will be free for
Stanford students.
