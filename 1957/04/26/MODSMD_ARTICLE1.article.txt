# Oxy Trackmen Here Tomorrow

### Dick Barnes 
"I don't care if they double,
triple or run the coach; we'll still
beat 'em," exclaimed Payton Jor
dan, referring to tomorrow's dual
track and field meet between his
Stanford Indians and the Occi
dental Tigers at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Jordan added, "I'm sick and
tired of the things we've had to
take from those guys. I sincerely
believe we're going to win, and
the team knows darn well we're
going to win. I don't have a pes
ismistic bone in my body."
Stanford Mad
Stanford is mad—plenty mad —
about their poor showing against
UCLA last Monday, and the In
dians are out to make up for that
performance in a meet tomorrow
which could be the year's best.
A crowd of over 10,000 is ex
pected, including more than 600
fans from Occidental.

Both teams have great depth
and strength in some events but
are weak in others, making sev
eral sweeps likely. If this is the
case, then probably the three
short races—loo, 220 and 440—
will be the day's key events.

Admission to tlie Stanford-
Occidental track meet will be
free to Stanford students with
student-body cards.

Jordan will send Stanford co
captain Frank Herrmann out af
ter Oxy's Rudy Alston in the two
dashes. Alston is undefeated this
season, but hasn't met any really
top-flight competition. A victory
by Herrmann in either race
would give the Tribe an extra
point cushion to balance against
Oxy's strength in the 880, mile
and pole vault.
Don Chesarek and the Tiger

trio of Dennis Bambauer, John
Zetzman and Pat Logan figure to
stage a battle royal in the quar
ter-mile. But if Chesarek runs as
he did against USC's Tom Ander
son two weeks ago, he should
come home in front.
Probably the greatest field
event interest will be centered
about Bob Gutowski's assault on
the world's pole vault record.
He's given an excellent chance to
crack Cornelius Warmerdam's
15-7% standard, which he has
narrowly missed several times
this season.
The Indians will have to score
heavily in the remaining five
field events if they are to whip
Chuck Coker's Occidental crew.
The Tigers are weak in the three
weight events and could be held
to three points in them.
Favored in Discus
Fred Peters is a heavy favorite
to win the discus for the Indians

since he has thrown 25 feet far
ther than any Oxy flinger. In
the javelin it's almost the same
story, with Hank Roldan far
ahead of all competitors.
The shot put is the most un
predictable of the weights. Ray
Williamson and Chris Plain of
the Tribe both have far better
marks than Dave Goodenough of
the Tigers, but the Oxy man is
considered to be throwing far be
low his potential this year. Still,
the nod must be given to William
son and Plain to go 1-2 for the
Indians.
Stanford looks good for six
points in each of the jumping
events.
Herrmann has gone nearly a
foot farther than Gutowski, the
best Oxy broad jumper. Fehlen
ranks nearly three inches above
the Tigers' Dick Haddon in the
high jump. And Haddon has a

reputation for falling apart in
big meets.
Kent Hansen and Ron Bondoc
will be out to get valuable upset
seconds for the Indians in the
broad jump and high jump.
Shot l'ut Sweep
Kirk N ie 1a n d and Archie
Schmitt are Jordan's hopes for
the runner-up spots in the javelin
and discus. Schmitt could also
move in for a Stanford sweep in
the shot put.
Chuck Cobb stands head and
shoulders above anyone else in
either hurdle race. Monday
against UCLA, he finished back
in third place after clobbering
several hurdles, but he isn't about
to let it happen again. Bernie
Nelson in the highs and Leonard
Bates in the lows are Stanford's
best bets for runner-up honors
in the stick races.
Nelson, however, has the slight
