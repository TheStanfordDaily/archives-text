# Reinhardt Talk Tells Changes In Psychiatry
## 
### 
Psychoanalysis has moved in
three stages from "scientism" to
"subjectivity" to "an integrated
personalized synthesis," German
professor Kurt Reinhardt said
yesterday.
Reinhardt spoke before 110 per
sons closely squeezed into the
lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse. The speech was spon
sored by the Philological Associ
ation.
He said the "scientism" of Ad
ler, Freud and others regarded
man as a "product of his drives,"
while the "subjectivity of existen
tialists such as Sartre" saw him
as a "product of free choice."
Neither is correct, Reinhardt said,
but the truth lies somewhere in
between — the "personalized syn
thesis."
"A Good Example"
A good example of the person
alized synthesis is psychosomatic
medicine, Reinhardt said. He
commented that psychoanalysis
must have a "solid substructure
in biology and a spiritual super
structure" and that psychosomat
ic medicine meets these two re
quirements.
Psychoanalysis aims at curing
neuroses, Reinhardt said. He
based his description of neuroses
mainly on that given by Caruso
and Hume, who regarded it as the
"negation of wholeness and the
overemphasis on the partial world
view."
The neurotic, according to Rein
hardt, makes an "absolute attach
ment to relative values . . . which
exposes the person to extreme
terror and excessive compulsion."
"They're Not Equad"
He said psychological salvation
must not be regarded as the equal
of religious salvation. This error
would in itself be "absolutization
of relative values."
Caruso deplored the fact that
"classical psychotherapy is not
conscious of the fact that the
neurotic can be of great value,"
Reinhardt said.
Reinhardt said neurotics such as
Faust, Augustine, Pascal and
Kierkegaard had reached great
ness. tie also mentioned Don Juan
as an example of a "melancholic
aesthete."
"The disease of a guilty con
science is by no means confined
to the neurotic," Reinhardt said.
He called it the "greatest disease
of modern civilization."

He said the "scientism" of Ad
ler, Freud and others regarded
man as a "product of his drives,"
while the "subjectivity of existen
tialists such as Sartre" saw him
as a "product of free choice."
Neither is correct, Reinhardt said,
but the truth lies somewhere in
between — the "personalized syn
thesis."
"A Good Example"
A good example of the person
alized synthesis is psychosomatic
medicine, Reinhardt said. He
commented that psychoanalysis
must have a "solid substructure
in biology and a spiritual super
structure" and that psychosomat
ic medicine meets these two re
quirements.
Psychoanalysis aims at curing
neuroses, Reinhardt said. He
based his description of neuroses
mainly on that given by Caruso
and Hume, who regarded it as the
"negation of wholeness and the
overemphasis on the partial world
view."
The neurotic, according to Rein
hardt, makes an "absolute attach
ment to relative values . . . which
exposes the person to extreme
terror and excessive compulsion."
"They're Not Equad"
He said psychological salvation
must not be regarded as the equal
of religious salvation. This error
would in itself be "absolutization
of relative values."
Caruso deplored the fact that
"classical psychotherapy is not
conscious of the fact that the
neurotic can be of great value,"
Reinhardt said.
Reinhardt said neurotics such as
Faust, Augustine, Pascal and
Kierkegaard had reached great
ness. tie also mentioned Don Juan
as an example of a "melancholic
aesthete."
"The disease of a guilty con
science is by no means confined
to the neurotic," Reinhardt said.
He called it the "greatest disease
of modern civilization."
