# Ads Cost Chappie Late Distribution

The Chaparral is finally outâ€”
but the expected "giant 60-page
issue" has been cut to a mere 58.
The belated sale of this sterling
Western humor magazine is due
to the fact that two athletes would
have been ineligible for sports if
their pictures had appeared in the
little jewel.
They had posed for ad pictures
which featured the sports they
participate in, making them liable
to PCC penalty for making money
from their amateur sport.
Fortunately the ads were "back
to back," and a volunteer crew
worked all night snipping the of
fending pages from all the maga
zines.
