# U.S. Orders 6th Fleet To East Mediterranean
## International Communism' Threat In Jordan May Test Ike's Doctrine 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 25 (UP)—The United States declared today
that Jordan was threatened by "international Communism" and or
dered the powerful U.S. Sixth Fleet into the eastern Mediterranean
near the troubled Arab nation.
The moves were regarded as a possible prelude to the first test of
T?:« 1 r\ i...* ii

the Eisenhower Doctrine, under
which America would aid any
Middle East nation beset by Com
munism.
The State Department said the
pro-Western government of King
Hussein had not requested U.S.
help. It noted that the congres
sional resolution authorizing such
action stipulates that the help
must be requested.
Department press officer Lin
coln White did not link the fleet
movement with the Jordanian sit
uation. But there seemed no doubt
the developments were related.
U.S. Aid to Jordan?
Although the sudden movement
under secret orders was described
as precautionary, it was clear that
the United States was preparing
for the possibility that U.S. aid
might be sought by Jordan.
The Communist world was put
on notice by a series of implied
warnings, including:
• A joint statement by Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles last
night that they "regard the inde
pendence and integrity of Jordan
as vital" to U.S. interest.
• White's statement today that
Jordan's "independence and integ
rity" were being threatened by
international Communism.
• The fact that the "independ
ance and integrity" phrase was
taken directly from the Mideast
resolution authorizing U.S. mili
tary and economic help when
Communism threatened that area.
Hussein's Appeal Lacking
Thus all the elements for the
first application of the doctrine
apparently were present except
an appeal from King Hussein for
assistance. Hussein said yester
day he believed "we can handle
the situation ourselves."
Besides the carrier Forrestal,
with its far-ranging planes, the
Sixth Fleet includes the carrier
Lake Champlain, the battleship
Wisconsin, heavy cruisers Salem
and Des Moines, 18 destroyers,
two submarines, two attack trans
ports, one high-speed transport,
two landing ships dock and two
LST's. It also has a reinforced
battalion of Marines numbering
about 1800.
White told reporters the Eisen
hower-Dulles statement "repre
sented a reminder to the world"
that the United States had a vital
interest in the Middle East.

WASHINGTON, April 25 (UP)—The United States declared today
that Jordan was threatened by "international Communism" and or
dered the powerful U.S. Sixth Fleet into the eastern Mediterranean
near the troubled Arab nation.
The moves were regarded as a possible prelude to the first test of
T?:« 1 r\ i...* ii

the Eisenhower Doctrine, under
which America would aid any
Middle East nation beset by Com
munism.
The State Department said the
pro-Western government of King
Hussein had not requested U.S.
help. It noted that the congres
sional resolution authorizing such
action stipulates that the help
must be requested.
Department press officer Lin
coln White did not link the fleet
movement with the Jordanian sit
uation. But there seemed no doubt
the developments were related.
U.S. Aid to Jordan?
Although the sudden movement
under secret orders was described
as precautionary, it was clear that
the United States was preparing
for the possibility that U.S. aid
might be sought by Jordan.
The Communist world was put
on notice by a series of implied
warnings, including:
• A joint statement by Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles last
night that they "regard the inde
pendence and integrity of Jordan
as vital" to U.S. interest.
• White's statement today that
Jordan's "independence and integ
rity" were being threatened by
international Communism.
• The fact that the "independ
ance and integrity" phrase was
taken directly from the Mideast
resolution authorizing U.S. mili
tary and economic help when
Communism threatened that area.
Hussein's Appeal Lacking
Thus all the elements for the
first application of the doctrine
apparently were present except
an appeal from King Hussein for
assistance. Hussein said yester
day he believed "we can handle
the situation ourselves."
Besides the carrier Forrestal,
with its far-ranging planes, the
Sixth Fleet includes the carrier
Lake Champlain, the battleship
Wisconsin, heavy cruisers Salem
and Des Moines, 18 destroyers,
two submarines, two attack trans
ports, one high-speed transport,
two landing ships dock and two
LST's. It also has a reinforced
battalion of Marines numbering
about 1800.
White told reporters the Eisen
hower-Dulles statement "repre
sented a reminder to the world"
that the United States had a vital
interest in the Middle East.
