# Caste Institution Dying Out, Says Indian Journalist
## 
### 
In India the question of "casW?
comes in only when we begin to
think of social life," G. T. Madk
holkar, Indian newspaperman, ex
plained.
Two aspects of the Hindu faith
exist, he continued. One is philo
sophical and the other social.
Caste has no place in the philo
sophical-spiritual sphere, but il
tends to come to the fore in social
life, he said.
Madkholkar visited the Stan
ford campus yesterday under the
auspices of the committee on lead
ers and specialists of the Ameri
can Council on Education. He is
chief editor of the Tarun Bharat,
a daily newspaper in Nagpur.
India's constitution of 1947 rec
ognizes no caste, creed or color.
"It recognizes the equality of man.
justice, fair play to all and good
will toward the world in general,"
Madkholkar said.
The caste "system" has been
dying out for the last 500 years,
he said, "and it has almost faded
out now."
To illustrate this change, Madk
holkar cited several instances of
high government positions which
are now held by Hindus of the
lowest caste, the untouchables.
In other Indian affairs, the
newsman explained that India's
"death rate is lowering almost
every year." This he ascribed to
increased technological and finan
cial resources.
Indian women are as "free and
equal" as those in the United
States, he said.
Forty per cent are highly edu
cated, he said, and "every state
ministry has a woman minister."
In the Central State Cabinet
there are two lady ministers."
The governor of the state of Ben
gal is a woman, he added.
