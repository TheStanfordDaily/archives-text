Tor six years the Stanford Bookstore lias been
;i corpora lion completely separate from any
University control or administration.
It is true that it is a non-profit corporation,
giv tng its profits to the student in the form of
rebates. Last year $103,000 in rebates was paid.
But an additional $35,000 was set aside toward
a new Bookstore, and $15,000 of this had to he
paid in the form of a corporate business tax.
\ esterday a request was introduced to the
Bookstore board of directors to dissolve them
selves as a separate corporation and put them
selves under general University control. Ac
cording to Dave kirhach, Legislature Book
store Committee chairman, such an action
Mould almost certainly make the Bookstore
non-taxable, resulting in a saving of $15,000.
It strikes us as rather strange that a book
store patronized almost entirely by students
should be so completely separate from any
student opinion formulating its policy. The 30-
member Bookstore board of governors has the
student body president and financial manager
as members, it is true.
But the hoard of governors meets only once
;i year —and then to approve the actions of the
board of directors, six men who administer all
the Bookstore business. And the hoard of gov
ernors is not sent any reports of the actions
of the directors. Approval is merely rubber
si ;i nip.
We think that ASSU president Bob Freelen's
previous proposal lo have a student si I in on

meetings of the present board of directors is a
sound one. Students are the primary customers
of the Bookstore and are sharers in its profits;
they should have a voice or at least be able to
observe its operations.
With the planning of the new Bookslore be
ginning, we certainly believe the student should
have a chance to express himself about bis
needs and desires.
There are plenty of things wrong with the
Bookstore that are not only due to the in
adequate plant. The directors, in all honesty,
may not be aware of these inadequacies; a stu
dent representative could keep them up on
these.
The board of governors should be made more
aware of the actions of the board of directors.
We heartily support the recommendation that
minutes of I lie directors' meetings be sent to
all governors, and that the voice of students on
the hoard of governors he increased to more
than the existing two members.
However, we think llie best long-run in
terests of the students would be served if the
directors would dissolve the corporation as it
exists and go under University control. The
same directors could run the same Bookstore,
and $15,000 toward a new Union or Bookstore
and more st11«1 <nI voice in their own Bookstore
would result.
The Bookstore directors would be acting in

student body president and financial manager
as members, it is true.
But the hoard of governors meets only once
;i year —and then to approve the actions of the
board of directors, six men who administer all
the Bookstore business. And the hoard of gov

We think that ASSU president Bob Freelen's
previous proposal lo have a student si I in on

meetings of the present board of directors is a
sound one. Students are the primary customers
of the Bookstore and are sharers in its profits;
they should have a voice or at least be able to
observe its operations.
With the planning of the new Bookslore be
ginning, we certainly believe the student should
have a chance to express himself about bis
needs and desires.
There are plenty of things wrong with the
Bookstore that are not only due to the in
adequate plant. The directors, in all honesty,
may not be aware of these inadequacies; a stu
dent representative could keep them up on
these.
The board of governors should be made more
aware of the actions of the board of directors.
We heartily support the recommendation that
minutes of I lie directors' meetings be sent to
all governors, and that the voice of students on
the hoard of governors he increased to more
than the existing two members.
However, we think llie best long-run in
terests of the students would be served if the
directors would dissolve the corporation as it
exists and go under University control. The
same directors could run the same Bookstore,
and $15,000 toward a new Union or Bookstore
and more st11«1 <nI voice in their own Bookstore

Tor six years the Stanford Bookstore lias been

University control or administration.
It is true that it is a non-profit corporation,
giv tng its profits to the student in the form of
rebates. Last year $103,000 in rebates was paid.
But an additional $35,000 was set aside toward
a new Bookstore, and $15,000 of this had to he
paid in the form of a corporate business tax.

Bookstore board of directors to dissolve them

non-taxable, resulting in a saving of $15,000.
It strikes us as rather strange that a book
store patronized almost entirely by students
should be so completely separate from any
student opinion formulating its policy. The 30-
