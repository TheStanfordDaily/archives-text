# ASSU Committee to Submit Report On University Control of Bookstore; $15,000 Tax Saving Under New Plan
## Parks Says Old Plan 'Satisfactory'; Student Rep Compromise Suggested 
### 
Whether to incorporate the Stanford Bookstore under University
administration is coming under heavy discussion by both the ASSU
officers and the present Bookstore Board of Directors.
The ASSU Bookstore committee, formed to study the problem of
University control, is expected to submit its report to the Bookstore
Board of Directors today. ,

Professor George Parks, presi
dent of the Bookstore's Board of
Directors, said yesterday that the
present system of administering
the Bookstore is "satisfactory,"
and that putting the Bookstore
under University control would
put too big a strain on the admin
istration.
He said that the main function
of the faculty and administration
of a university is to provide for
the education of the students, not
to provide services for them.
University Will Pay Part
Parks added that in order to en
able construction of a new book
store, the profits, after rebates
have been distributed, must be
used to pay for equipping the
new facility, as the University
will only provide funds for a cer
tain amount of the construction.
The rest must be paid out of
Bookstore profits.
The opposing side of the ques
tion has been stated by ASSU
President Robert Freelen.
Freelen said he has wanted to
discuss this issue at a meeting
of the Board of Directors, but
that until now the Bookstore has
been "giving us the run-around."
There are no student representa
tives on the Board of Directors,
although two ASSU officers at
lend the yearly meeting of the
Board of Governors.
ASSU Side
Freelen stated the ASSU side
is as follows: Since the profits
after rebates are now subject to
taxation, University control
would mean that the $15,000 that
now goes for annual taxes would
remain as part of the net profit.
Net profits before taxation at
present amount to about $40,000
yearly.
Freelen stated that the present
rebate system would definitely
not be affected if the Bookstore
were to come under University
control.
A suggested compromise would
enable students to have a voice in
Bookstore policy by placing a stu
dent representative on the Board
of Directors.
The University has intimated
that it would he glad to assimi
late the Bookstore in order to re

tain the entire $40,000 profit for
University use.
One of Freelen's main points
has been that these profits, par
ticularly those that now go for
taxes, should be used both in the
construction of a new store and
in that of the proposed Tresidder
Memorial Union, as well as for
other student purposes.
The proposal for annexation
was brought up by Freelen at the
December meeting of the Board
of Governors. Parks 'said that his
impression of Freelen at the
meeting was that "Bob is very
prolific with his ideas." He said
that he was "amused" by an ob
servation of another member of
the Board that "that young man
will know more in 20 years."

The University has intimated
that it would he glad to assimi
late the Bookstore in order to re

tain the entire $40,000 profit for
University use.
One of Freelen's main points
has been that these profits, par
ticularly those that now go for
taxes, should be used both in the
construction of a new store and
in that of the proposed Tresidder
Memorial Union, as well as for
other student purposes.
The proposal for annexation
was brought up by Freelen at the
December meeting of the Board
of Governors. Parks 'said that his
impression of Freelen at the
meeting was that "Bob is very
prolific with his ideas." He said
that he was "amused" by an ob
servation of another member of
the Board that "that young man
will know more in 20 years."

Whether to incorporate the Stanford Bookstore under University
administration is coming under heavy discussion by both the ASSU
officers and the present Bookstore Board of Directors.
The ASSU Bookstore committee, formed to study the problem of
University control, is expected to submit its report to the Bookstore
Board of Directors today. ,

Professor George Parks, presi
dent of the Bookstore's Board of
Directors, said yesterday that the
present system of administering
the Bookstore is "satisfactory,"
and that putting the Bookstore
under University control would
put too big a strain on the admin
istration.
He said that the main function
of the faculty and administration
of a university is to provide for
the education of the students, not
to provide services for them.
University Will Pay Part
Parks added that in order to en
able construction of a new book
store, the profits, after rebates
have been distributed, must be
used to pay for equipping the
new facility, as the University
will only provide funds for a cer
tain amount of the construction.
The rest must be paid out of
Bookstore profits.
The opposing side of the ques
tion has been stated by ASSU
President Robert Freelen.
Freelen said he has wanted to
discuss this issue at a meeting
of the Board of Directors, but
that until now the Bookstore has
been "giving us the run-around."
There are no student representa
tives on the Board of Directors,
although two ASSU officers at
lend the yearly meeting of the
Board of Governors.
ASSU Side
Freelen stated the ASSU side
is as follows: Since the profits
after rebates are now subject to
taxation, University control
would mean that the $15,000 that
now goes for annual taxes would
remain as part of the net profit.
Net profits before taxation at
present amount to about $40,000
yearly.
Freelen stated that the present
rebate system would definitely
not be affected if the Bookstore
were to come under University
control.
A suggested compromise would
enable students to have a voice in
Bookstore policy by placing a stu
dent representative on the Board
of Directors.
The University has intimated
