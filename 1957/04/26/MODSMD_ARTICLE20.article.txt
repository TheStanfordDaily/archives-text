Mothers* C.luhs
Editor, The Daily:
We have read with interest, the recent Daily
editorial on Stern food and Ihe letter from the
Stern hashers. We cat. in Stern, and we do not
care for Ihe food served here; the complaints
against it seem justified to us.
We do feel, however, that the staff here is
making an effort, however minimal, to improve
Ihe situation. But the staff is simply not in full
control of the situation, and some concern must
be elicited higher in the administration before
much can be accomplished.
The administration fears parents, particularly
if those parents are irate and are organized, as
is the Mothers' Club of Portland which has for
mally protested Ihe dining conditions in Stern.
This protest has not gone unnoticed by the ad
ministration, and if those who live in Stern really
want better food they would do well to suggest,
to their parents, particularly to their mothers,
that this subject be brought up in other Mothers'
Clubs. If the Mothers' Clubs, say, of Seattle,
Sacramento and Los Angeles should follow the
lead of the Mothers' Club of Portland a great
deal more would be accomplished than has re
sulted from the disorganized complaining that
has been going on for some time to no avail.

British Consul
Editor, The Daily:
Owing, no doubt, to the need for compression,
Mr. Canfield's excellent report on my talk to the
International Relations Club quoted me as say
ing that "Ihe British resent being forced to pay
back their war debts." This is not correct as
Britain both acknowledges and has hitherto re
paid her debts on due date.
What I said was that Britain could not but
view with a sad smile the recent proposal before
Congress to return all enemy property or invest
ments confiscated by America; in view of the
fact that our debts were the result of having
held the pass alone for two years, with the help
of our gallant friends of the Commonwealth.
As your readers will know until Pearl Harbor
Britain paid, on the barrel head, for all she
bought in America; lost much of it in torpedoed
ships; and had to sell $5% billion of British in
vestments in America in order so to do. We
therefore had to arrange the 1946 loan in order
to start our industries and repair our bombed
schools, hospitals and one-third of our houses
with materials bought in America with this
money.
