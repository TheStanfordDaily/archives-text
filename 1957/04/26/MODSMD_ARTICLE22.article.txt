### Leo Krulitz 
"Jewish Religion" was the sub
ject of a talk by Rabbi Meyer
Heller of Temple Emanu-El, San
Francisco, at the Religious Dis
cuss i on Luncheon yesterday.
Many questions were answered
concerning the Jewish faith and
ideas.
Rabbi Heller, explaining that
the question most frequently ask
ed concerns the Jewish attitude
toward Jesus, opened his talk by
presenting the Jewish position on
the subject.
He said, quoting from an ar
ticle in Look: "Jews accept Jesus
as a fellow Jew . . . but we don't
and can't accept him as Messiah.
War to Cease
"We Jews have believed for
over 3,000 years that when the
days of the Messiah come, war
will cease, poverty will cease . . .
good will toward men will exist
everywhere in the world. Obvi
ously, neither Jesus nor any other
person has thus far been able to
usher in such an age."
Rabbi Heller explained: "Re
formed Jews do not believe a Mes
siah will come. They believe men
will work together to obtain a
Messianic era.
Jewish Clan
"Jews tend to be so clannish,"
he said, "partly because they are
excluded and partly because they
feel more comfortable with other
Jews. You look for people with
whom you have something in
common."
In explaining the Jewish feeling
toward the Christian Christmas
and Easter, Rabbi Heller said,
"Both are religious, sacred days
for the Christian and therefore
should be observed by Christians."
He went on to explain the diffi
culties these celebrations present

to the Jewish people, especially
with regard to their children.
Heller also emphasized Ihe im
portance the Jewish people place
on their own calendar and reli
gious festivals. "One rabbi sug
gested," he said, "that our calen
dar is our catechism." He de
scribed some of the Jewish festi
vals and explained that the Jewish
Sabbath, which begins Friday eve
ning and ends Saturday, is also
considered a definite, sacred day
to be observed.
In explaining the Jewish policy
of refraining from seeking con
verts, Rabbi Heller said, "Most
Jews oppose missionizing because
we believe all people who follow
their own faith have a share in
the world to come."
Worship Service
In response to a question from
the group, Rabbi Heller described
the Jewish service of worship. He
said: "Our services are much
more formal than the Protestant
services. There isn't as much
original prayer in them—which is
our loss. Jews depend upon the
written, formal prayer."
In presenting the Jewish idea
on the immortality of the soul,
he explained that the Jewish peo
ple are divided into two groups
of thought, the traditionalists and
the liberals. He said: "The Jew
ish faith contains the traditionals,
who believe in immortality of Ihe
soul; they believe immortality is
given through good works. The
liberal Jew puts the emphasis on
jchis world; they gain immortality
""through their children and are
remembered for their good
works."
Rabbi Heller also visited Dr.
Alexander Miller's Contemporary
Religious Thought Seminar.

He said, quoting from an ar
ticle in Look: "Jews accept Jesus
as a fellow Jew . . . but we don't
and can't accept him as Messiah.
War to Cease
"We Jews have believed for
over 3,000 years that when the
days of the Messiah come, war
will cease, poverty will cease . . .
good will toward men will exist
everywhere in the world. Obvi
ously, neither Jesus nor any other
person has thus far been able to
usher in such an age."
Rabbi Heller explained: "Re
formed Jews do not believe a Mes
siah will come. They believe men
will work together to obtain a
Messianic era.
Jewish Clan
"Jews tend to be so clannish,"
he said, "partly because they are
excluded and partly because they
feel more comfortable with other
Jews. You look for people with
whom you have something in
common."
In explaining the Jewish feeling
toward the Christian Christmas
and Easter, Rabbi Heller said,
"Both are religious, sacred days
for the Christian and therefore
should be observed by Christians."
He went on to explain the diffi
culties these celebrations present

to the Jewish people, especially
with regard to their children.
Heller also emphasized Ihe im
portance the Jewish people place
on their own calendar and reli
gious festivals. "One rabbi sug
gested," he said, "that our calen
dar is our catechism." He de
scribed some of the Jewish festi
vals and explained that the Jewish
Sabbath, which begins Friday eve
ning and ends Saturday, is also
considered a definite, sacred day
to be observed.
In explaining the Jewish policy
of refraining from seeking con
verts, Rabbi Heller said, "Most
Jews oppose missionizing because
we believe all people who follow
their own faith have a share in
the world to come."
Worship Service
In response to a question from
the group, Rabbi Heller described
the Jewish service of worship. He
said: "Our services are much
more formal than the Protestant
services. There isn't as much
original prayer in them—which is
our loss. Jews depend upon the
written, formal prayer."
In presenting the Jewish idea
on the immortality of the soul,
he explained that the Jewish peo
ple are divided into two groups
of thought, the traditionalists and
the liberals. He said: "The Jew
ish faith contains the traditionals,
who believe in immortality of Ihe
soul; they believe immortality is
given through good works. The
liberal Jew puts the emphasis on
jchis world; they gain immortality
""through their children and are
remembered for their good
works."
Rabbi Heller also visited Dr.
Alexander Miller's Contemporary
Religious Thought Seminar.
"Jewish Religion" was the sub
ject of a talk by Rabbi Meyer
Heller of Temple Emanu-El, San
Francisco, at the Religious Dis
cuss i on Luncheon yesterday.

Rabbi Heller, explaining that
