## 
### 
Stanford's freshman trackstersi
wind up their home schedule to
morrow when Ihey host Oakland
and Stockton junior colleges in a
triangular meet beginning at 10
a.m. on Angeil Field.
Floyd Strain's team has com
piled an excellent 4-2 record this
year, losing only to Mt. San An
tonio and Modesto, the two most
powerful j un i or college track
teams in California. The Pa
pooses' final regular meet will be
held a week from tomorrow at
California.
Highlight of tomorrow morn
ing's meet will be the attempt by
the Papooses to lower their school
mile relay record to under 3:20.
The team has already cracked the
mai'k twice this year, the most re
cent being a 3:2i.9 effort.
John Kelly, normally a broad
jumper, low hurdler and 100-yard
dash man, will lead off for the
Papooses. He has run the 440
only once this year and was clock
ed in 50.6. Running second will be
i Chuck McKenney. the team's No.
2 quarter-miler.
The third leg is scheduled to be
run by Bob Besse, Strain's combi
nation javelin thrower and quar
ter-miler. Besse ran 18.9 as a high
school senior and has consistently
been under 50 seconds this season.

Anchoring Ihe team will be Dick
Lassen, the Papooses' 1:55.4 half
miler.
Kelly will also take a crack at
improving his recently-established
j frosh broad jump record of 23-8 , ,4.
j He broke the old mark of 23-5 V2
last Tuesday, after flirting with it
throughout the season.
Distance star Bobby Mon/ingo,
just recovering from a heavy cold,
will probably be limited to the
mile. He turned in his best mark
of the season last week, touring
the four laps in 4:20.3 .
Norman Pease is the Tribe's
big threat in both sprint races,
j He has raced to clocking of 9.8
| and 21.7 this year.
Out of action in tomorrow's |
■ meet will be John Stahler, the
j regular Papoose pole-vaulter. He
strained a thigh muscle in Tues
day's meet and looks doubtful for
the Cal meet. Stahler cleared 13-8
earlier this year to break the for
mer Stanford freshman record.
