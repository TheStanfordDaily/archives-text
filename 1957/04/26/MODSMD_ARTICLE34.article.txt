# Stanford Nine Faces UCLA Twice in South
## 
### 
Stanford's surging baseball club, |
sparked by the strong left arm of j
Bob Leopold and timely hitting,
heads south for two crucial games 1
with UCLA over the weekend.
Despite their 4-5 win-loss rec
ord, the Indians suddenly find
themselves in a challenging posi
tion for the lead in the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion, first rung in the ladder for
the- NCAA championships.
Southern California and UCLA
are ineligible for an NCAA play
off berth, leaving only California,
Santa Clara and the Cards to bat
tle it out among themselves. Vic
tories and losses against the Tro
jans and Bruins, however, count
in the CIBA standings.
USC is currently leading the
standings with a 7-2 mark, fol
lowed by California with 5-3.
UCLA appears to be out of the
running with a 2-6 record, and
Santa Clara is not much better
wilh only two wins agaipst four
losses. Both of the latter wins,
however, were against Stanford.
Cal Fading
California, billed as the pre-sea
son team lo beat, has been fading
rapidly of late. Last weekend they
took it on the chin twice, first
from UCLA and then from Stan
ford.
In the first of four baseball
"Big Games" the Bears got what
they asked for—Bob Leopold. Cal
ifornia thought they had the big
left-hander in Iheir fold, but he
tur ned up on Ihe Farm instead.
In his first start this season for
the Tribe, Leopold showed why he
was so sought after by pitching a
no-hit, no-run affair against hard- .
hitting USC.
Showing no signs of fear, the
Bears asked for - Leopold. Card
coach Dutch Fehrrng obliged. So
did Leopold. lie defied baseball
tradition by tossing a five-hitter
at the bewildered Cal nine.
Brilliant Pitching
Apparently encouraged by bril-l
lianl pitching of Iheir new sopho
more star, Ihe Card baiters got irr
on the act. Parker Olson led the
Indians in Iheir big inning by
blasting a round-lripper, and be-
I'ore ihe inning was over Al Shaw
duplicated Olson's feat and the
Tribe chased across five big runs,
it was more than enough as the
Cards and Leopold won wilh ease,
10-1.
The Indians have played UCLA
twice this season. Both games
were played during spring vaca
tion. The Bruins took Ihe first
contest with ease, 11-2; Stanford 1
copped Ihe shortened nightcap, i
5-0.
Not So Strong
As a team the Bruins aren't
nearly so strong as Stanford.
However, in pitcher Kirk Wilson j
they have a man to match Leo-j
pold. He has an earned run av- \
erage of less than one per game j
and was the winning" pitcher in |
both of the Uclans' two victories
in CIBA play.
Leopold's earned run average
reads like a typesetter's mistake—
.000. However, he has pitched two j
less games than Wilson, and the j
latter's two losses were 1-0 and j
3-0 heart breakers.
These two are slated to start i
against each other in what should
be one of ihe greatest pitching
duels in CIBA play. Fehring will
probably start Walt Payne in Ihe
other contest, with Ed Verdurmen
standing close by in both games.

with UCLA over the weekend.
Despite their 4-5 win-loss rec
ord, the Indians suddenly find
themselves in a challenging posi
tion for the lead in the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion, first rung in the ladder for
the- NCAA championships.
Southern California and UCLA
are ineligible for an NCAA play
off berth, leaving only California,
Santa Clara and the Cards to bat
tle it out among themselves. Vic
tories and losses against the Tro
jans and Bruins, however, count
in the CIBA standings.
USC is currently leading the
standings with a 7-2 mark, fol
lowed by California with 5-3.
UCLA appears to be out of the
running with a 2-6 record, and
Santa Clara is not much better
wilh only two wins agaipst four
losses. Both of the latter wins,
however, were against Stanford.
Cal Fading
California, billed as the pre-sea
son team lo beat, has been fading
rapidly of late. Last weekend they
took it on the chin twice, first
from UCLA and then from Stan
ford.
In the first of four baseball
"Big Games" the Bears got what
they asked for—Bob Leopold. Cal
ifornia thought they had the big
left-hander in Iheir fold, but he
tur ned up on Ihe Farm instead.
In his first start this season for
the Tribe, Leopold showed why he
was so sought after by pitching a
no-hit, no-run affair against hard- .
hitting USC.
Showing no signs of fear, the
Bears asked for - Leopold. Card
coach Dutch Fehrrng obliged. So
did Leopold. lie defied baseball
tradition by tossing a five-hitter
at the bewildered Cal nine.
Brilliant Pitching
Apparently encouraged by bril-l
lianl pitching of Iheir new sopho
more star, Ihe Card baiters got irr
on the act. Parker Olson led the
Indians in Iheir big inning by
blasting a round-lripper, and be-
I'ore ihe inning was over Al Shaw
duplicated Olson's feat and the
Tribe chased across five big runs,
it was more than enough as the
Cards and Leopold won wilh ease,
10-1.
The Indians have played UCLA
twice this season. Both games
were played during spring vaca
tion. The Bruins took Ihe first
contest with ease, 11-2; Stanford 1
copped Ihe shortened nightcap, i
5-0.
Not So Strong
As a team the Bruins aren't
nearly so strong as Stanford.
However, in pitcher Kirk Wilson j
they have a man to match Leo-j
pold. He has an earned run av- \
erage of less than one per game j
and was the winning" pitcher in |
both of the Uclans' two victories
in CIBA play.
Leopold's earned run average
reads like a typesetter's mistake—
.000. However, he has pitched two j
less games than Wilson, and the j
latter's two losses were 1-0 and j
3-0 heart breakers.
These two are slated to start i
against each other in what should
be one of ihe greatest pitching
duels in CIBA play. Fehring will
probably start Walt Payne in Ihe
other contest, with Ed Verdurmen
standing close by in both games.
