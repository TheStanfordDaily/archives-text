individual competitor, however, in
Don Rosenthal, and they have a
perennially strong corps of divers.'
Real Competitor
Rosenthal is a freestyler who
has turned in top-notch times
from 50 to 440 yards. Haynie calls
Rosenthal a competitor in the
strictest sense of the word—he j
looks for the toughest competi
tion and will swim in those events.
Thus, it is likely that Rosenthal
will tangle wilh Lowell Johnson
in the 100 and Bob Burton in the i
220. He has turned in excellent j
times of 51.5 and 2:10 in these
events.
Johnson was clocked at 52 flat'
in winning the century against 1
California two weeks ago, but he j
has had faster times.
Burton swam the furlong in i
2:12.9 against Cal, but is likewise |
capable of better marks.
Bob Kahn will have to face the j
Bruin divers alone.
