# WHO Grantee, Psychiatrist Visits Campus
## Dr. Ehrhardt to Study Psych Department, Help Graduate Student 
### 
Traveling on a grant from the
World Health Organization
(WHO) of (he United Nations, a
German psychiatrist and neurolo
gist arrived on the campus yes
terday morning.
Dr. Helmut Ehrhardt, execu
tive of the German Psychiatric
Association, is visiting the United
States to study institutions and
problems of mental hygiene with
reference to social problems.
His Stanford visit is two-fold,
however. He is studying the Psy
chology Department's education
al and research facilities as well
as supplying information for an
education student's doctoral dis
sertation.
Stanford student Charles A. A.
Zwingmann recently wrote to Dr.
Ehrhardt, requesting information
for his dissertation entitled "Nos
talgia."
This country, Dr. Ehrhardt ob
served, is far better equipped and
advanced in social work than is
Germany. The care for the men
tally ill, as well as post-hospital
treatment, is more extensive, he
said.
In Germany, however, there is
the more desirable closer team
work between the psychiatry and
neurology workers, he explained.
This close affiliation has better
long - range results in hospitals
and schools, but the specialties
should be separated for matters
of research, he said.
Germany needs more social
workers, he observed, but "we
don't have enough money for this
work." A basic problem exists
among the people concerning a
prejudice against the mentally
ill.
