# Women to Vote On Social Rule Amendments
## Late Leave, Bonus, Sign-out Procedure Changes Suggested 
### 
Women's Social Regulations
Committee has proposed a list of
changes to the present system of
lafe leaves, bonus and sign-out
procedure which will be presented
Monday night in some house
meetings.
Under (lie new system if it is
passed by a three-fourths major
ity of women students sopho
mores, juniors and seniors will
have all 2:3o's. And the junior
quota will be changed from 55
sign-outs to an unlimited number.
The bonus, under the proposed
plan, will be discontinued. The
reasoning behind this, according
to the Social Regulations Commit
tee, is that the bonus is presently
being misused.
Bonus Misused
Research shows that as many
lock-out minutes are being incur
red now as before the bonus was
ever instituted. And the bonus is
most often used with 1:30 sign
outs, which, except for freshmen,
will no longer be in existence.
The committee has also propos
ed to include a line on Ihe late
leave slip for the expected time
of return.
In cases when a woman is de
tained longer than her indicated
expected time of return, she
would be required to call in and
extend her sign-out.
I,ate Minutes
Coming in a few minutes after
the expected time of return would
not be considered late minutes
unless, of course, it is after 2:30.
The system proposes to leave
the first-quarter freshman late
leave quota as it is. Second* and
third-quarter freshmen will be al
lot ted an additional five late
leaves over the present 30.
Four late leaves will be given
to the freshmen to he used only
Wednesday through Saturday of
Thanksgiving vacation. These are
in addition to the 25 quota.
A straw vote on these proposed
changes will probably be taken a
week from Monday in house meet
ings. If there is an indication of
approval, the proposal will be
placed on an official ballot.
