# Wild Duck' Is 'Successful'; To Play 2 Weeks
## O'Brien Capable; Others Rank From Still to Superb 
### Helen Guerrant 
The curtain came down last
night on the second very success
ful performance of "The Wild
Duck," presented by the Stanford
Players. Henrik Ibsen's tragedy
was played with sensitivity and
intelligence under the able direc
tion of Dr. Robert Loper.
Starring in the play is David
O'Brien, who portrays the part of
H jalmar Ekdal, a Norwegian pho
tographer who is happy in a pro
tected world built by the people
around him. O'Brien is very capa
ble in the role, though not com
pletely convincing. T here are
times when we realize he is an
actor upon a stage.
Gregor Werle, played by Philip
Angeloff, is a friend struggling
with himself, unable to decide
whet her he should tear apart
Hjalmar's comfortable world of
unawareness. Angeloff is stiff at
times, but able to play the in
tensity which the part demands.
"Gina" Superbly Acted
Gina, Hjalmar's wife, is superb
ly acted by Ann Pine. She seems
perfectly natural and earthy, re
strained but. sparkling. Patricia
Crawford as Hedvig, Gina's 14-
year-old daughter, is a little too
sweet but otherwise very good in
her part.
Old Ekdal, Hjalmar's father, is
a challenging role done very well
by Jerry Crawford. He is truly an
old man, with mellowed voice and
a distinct personality.
Haakon Werle, Gregor's father,
who is guilty of a crime for which
Old Ekdal was punished, is por
trayed by Philip Schultz. He lacks
maturity necessary for the part.
Celia Crawford as his fiancee,
Mrs. Sorby, is excellent. She is
completely composed and speaks
slowly, savoring her lines. Dr.
Relling is skillfully played by
Robert McFarland.
Others in C ast
Included in the rest of the cast
are Robert Lehrer, Melvin Kitay,
Stanton Throneberry, Michael du
Pont, Herbert Propper, Robert
Bonner, Peter Kump, John Adams
Jr., Richard Martin, Philip Tilden
and Walter Brown.
The settings, designed by Wil
liam Allison, are exceptionally
well done.
"The Wild Duck" will play to
night. and tomorrow and next
week from Wednesday through
Saturday nights. The price is $1
Wednesday and Thursday and
$1.50 Friday and Saturday. Tick
ets may be bought at the box of
fice. The curtain rises at 8:15.
