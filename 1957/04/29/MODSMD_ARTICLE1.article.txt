# 800 STAGE RIOTS AT BRANNER, ROBLE
## Truher in Hospital as Result Of Fall From Trancos Three Freshman Dared to Jump From Top Floor; Unintentional 'Slip' Earns Him $10 Wager 
### 
Jack Truher, freshman, slipped and fell from a window on the
third floor of Trancos House of Wilbur Hall Friday at 7 p.m.
The accident was the result of a $10 bet made between Truher and
several freshmen who dared him to jump from the window. Accord
ing to Truher, "I never intended to jump and was only going along

with the horseplay."
"I balanced myself on the win
dow ledge and scared them by
pretending to be falling. One of
the sponsors kept telling me I
would fall, but I kept telling him
I'd had experience on high places.
Then I really did slip, and, so I
wouldn't hit the pavement direct
ly below the ledge, I gave myself
a good push," Truher explained.
He landed on the soft dirt directly
adjacent to the concrete sidewalk.
Astounded freshmen rushed to
the aid of their classmate. Tru
her in the meantime had gotten
up and walked around saying, "1
did it!" Several students drove
him to the Palo Alto Hospital.
He will remain in the hospital
for a,week, having suffered com
pression of a vertebra. He will
wear a cast for at least two
months, according to his brother
who was visiting him yesterday.
Recuperating from his daring
feat, Truher laughingly stated,
"Only a fool would jump from
that window."
Unintentionally, though, he
won the bet.
