# Gutowski Breaks World Mark In Pole Vault by Soaring 15-8¼
## Oxy Overruns Spikers, 72-59, on Team Depth; Stanford Takes Eight Firsts, Sets Six Records 
### Dick Barnes 
Bob Gutowski erased 15 years of pole vaulters' frustration as he
(soared 15 feet 8M inches Saturday in Stanford Stadium to break
Cornelius Warmerdam's world record.
The Occidental College senior cracked the mark of 15-7% which
Warmerdam had established in 1942 at Modesto, Calif. It was the

second oldest mark in the books,
exceeded only by Jesse Owens'
broad jump record—set in 1935—
and had stood virtually unchal
lenged for most of those 15 years.
Gutowski's historic effort and
excellent team depth led Oxy to a
72-59 victory over Stanford in a
point battle which was somewhat
overshadowed by the new world's
record.
Gutowski did not miss on any
of his attempts Saturday until
after he had broken Warmerdam's
mark. He successively cleared
13-6, 14-0, 14-4, 15-0, 15-4 Vz and
15-BV4. On his record leap he clear
ed tlie bar with nearly four inches
to spare, leaving no doubt what
soever that the new mark was his.
A few minutes later Gutowski
attempted to clear 16 feet. On his
first try the pole whipped the
wrong way and he could get no
height. His other two attempts
also failed to come close.
After the meet Gutowski voiced
confidence he could clear 16 feet
sometime soon. He added that he
expects to continue vaulting for
at least an additional nine years.
It was ironic that Gutowski
should accomplish his feat against
a Payton Jordan - coached team.
For the past three years Gutowski
had been under Jordan's tutelage
at Occidental before Jordan mov
ed to Stanford this year. In those
three years Gutowski improved
from a 12-3 high schooler to his
15-5 of last year.
Jordan said that seeing Gutow
ski break the world's record was
"one of the biggest thrills of my
life." Of the meet Jordan remark
ed that it was a meeting of two
teams equally fired up and both
wanting to win 100 per cent, but
that Oxy was the better team j
that day.
In first places Stanford outscor
t*d the Tigers, 8-7. But Occidental!
took more seconds and thirds than
did the Indians, giving them their
fjxial 13-point edge.
Six Meet Records
Six of Stanford's eight winners
broke meet records, with hurdler
Chuck Cobb cracking a pair of
standards. Cobb sped to a highl
it ick victory in 14.4 to erase Ger
ry Wood's 1954 mark by one-tenth
second. In the lows Cobb's 23.5
wt.s two-tenths second better than
Ihe mark held jointly by himself
;ind Bob Mathias.
Frank Herrmann turned in the
best hroad jump of his career and
line of the best in the nation as
lie leaped 25- !4. Herrmann also
lia.d a tremendous effort of 25-8,
Ik r crow-hopped by about two
inches. His winning mark was a
new meet record.
Maury Graves ran his best race
4 the year from both a competi
tive and stop-watch standpoint as
he won the two-mile in 9:14.7 for
:i not her meet mark.
] raves led for seven and one
half laps, with Oxy's John Kerr 1
one step behind. Near Ihe end of
every lap Kerr tried to pass
Craves, but the Indian junior al
ways held him off. Then with
220 yards to go, Kerr finally mov
ed into the lead and widened it
s.'\'htly at the 180-yard mark.
Finishing Kick
But Graves suddenly put on a
tremendous kick, overhauled Kerr
and went on to win by about 15
yards.
Ficld-eventers Hank Roldan,
Fred Peters, Phil Fehlen and Ray
V'lliamson turned in Stanford's
lour remaining victories, with the
first two men cracking meet rec
ords and Fehlen tying one.
Roldan reared hack and threw
his javelin 227-4V2 for the best
mark of his career and third best
in the nation this year. Peters
:i' v o established a new personal
best when he hurled the discus
172-8. He fouled on a throw of
better than 177 feet.
Fehlen was not his usual self
in the high jump, but still jumped
well enough to win at 6-5 Mr. Wil
liamson led a Stanford sweep in
th° shot-put, winning the event at
51-3%.
