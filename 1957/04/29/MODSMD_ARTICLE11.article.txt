# Gutowski Breaks World Mark In Pole Vault by Soaring 15-8¼
## Oxy Overruns Spikers, 72-59, on Team Depth; Stanford Takes Eight Firsts, Sets Six Records 
### Dick Barnes 
Bob Gutowski erased 15 years of pole vaulters' frustration as he
(soared 15 feet 8M inches Saturday in Stanford Stadium to break
Cornelius Warmerdam's world record.
The Occidental College senior cracked the mark of 15-7% which
Warmerdam had established in 1942 at Modesto, Calif. It was the

second oldest mark in the books,
exceeded only by Jesse Owens'
broad jump record—set in 1935—
and had stood virtually unchal
lenged for most of those 15 years.
Gutowski's historic effort and
excellent team depth led Oxy to a
72-59 victory over Stanford in a
point battle which was somewhat
overshadowed by the new world's
record.
Gutowski did not miss on any
of his attempts Saturday until
after he had broken Warmerdam's
mark. He successively cleared
13-6, 14-0, 14-4, 15-0, 15-4 Vz and
15-BV4. On his record leap he clear
ed tlie bar with nearly four inches
to spare, leaving no doubt what
soever that the new mark was his.
A few minutes later Gutowski
attempted to clear 16 feet. On his
first try the pole whipped the
wrong way and he could get no
height. His other two attempts
also failed to come close.
After the meet Gutowski voiced
confidence he could clear 16 feet
sometime soon. He added that he
expects to continue vaulting for
at least an additional nine years.
It was ironic that Gutowski
should accomplish his feat against
a Payton Jordan - coached team.
For the past three years Gutowski
had been under Jordan's tutelage
at Occidental before Jordan mov
ed to Stanford this year. In those
three years Gutowski improved
from a 12-3 high schooler to his
15-5 of last year.
Jordan said that seeing Gutow
ski break the world's record was
"one of the biggest thrills of my
life." Of the meet Jordan remark
ed that it was a meeting of two
teams equally fired up and both
wanting to win 100 per cent, but
