# Conformity to Be Hostel Topic This Weekend
## 
### 
The hostel program begins the
second half of its schedule this
weekend as Professor Robert
Horn of political science and As
sociate Professor Herbert Packer
accompany the group of up to 20
students for a discussion of "Con
formity in Thought—The Individ
ual or the Crowd."
Now that spring weather is
really here the opportunities pre
sented by the hostels for outdoor
recreation — swimming, trips to
the ocean, volleyball, softball, hik
ing—are almost as inviting as the
discussions themselves, says Pete
Swan, Hostel chairman.
Swan says that this weekend's
topic has come up on most of the
previous hostels for discussion
along with the regular topic.
Given a whole weekend alone,
he says that the topic will prob
ably expand to include: conform
ity as seen in American thought
as a whole; the tendency for an
individual to let: the crowd set
even his goals and values; the
role possible for the autonomous
man; and conformity as seen on
the Stanford campus.
Signups for the final three
hostels of the quarter begin to
day in the ASSU office. The $5
fee includes meals, lodging, use
of recreation facilities and insur
ance.
