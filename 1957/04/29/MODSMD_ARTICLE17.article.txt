# Wilbur Frosh Lead Raids After Branner Peep Show; Dorms Report No Damage
## Riots Last Less Than One Hour As Chief Davis, Sponsors Quiet Mob 
### Stan Gross Associate Editor 
Eight hundred freshmen-led students rioted and raided Branner
and Roble halls last night. Although no damage was reported, the
raiders vented their Western Civ midterm and hot-weather tensions
on the two freshman women's dorms with shouts and laughter.
The rioting is reported to have begun at about 10 p.m. when a

Branner woman lowered the
shade of her room and, with the
light on and her silhouette show
ing clearly through the window,
began to disrobe.
The crowd did not take long to
gather around Branner, but
shouted threats of a panty raid
failed to materialize, because the
men were unable to get inside.
Lights Go Out
At about 10:30 someone broke
into the Wilbur Hall circuit
breaker box and pulled the mas
ter light switch, turning off all
the lights in the dorm for a num
ber of minutes.
After repeated cheers and coun
ter-cheers from Branner women,
the mob moved by foot, car and
any available means to attack
Roble Hall. The tumult aroused
residents from other living
groups in the vicinity, and all
converged on Roble.
Throughout the riot Wilbur
sponsors tried to control the mob.
Police Chief Gordon Davis ap
peared on the Roble scene and
after remonstrating succeeded in
quieting them to some extent.
Phil Berry, a Wilbur sponsor
mounted the garage behind Ro
ble and attempted to quiet the
mob, telling the freshmen below
him that the first 20 who might
get inside would be expelled from
school.
"Hail, Caesar!"
The crowd responded with
cheers of "Hail, Caesar!" and
continued milling about the court
yard.
Some freshmen threw fire
crackers against the women's
dorms, and the women answered
by showering their assailants
with water bombs. No one was
reported hurt, and no damage
was recorded but that done to the
circuit breaker at Wilbur and a
ripped screen at Roble.
By 11 p.m. the raiders began
to disperse. Some threatened to
visit their wrath on Florence
Moore Hall and Lagunita Court,
but most returned to their dorms.
Mrs. Ellene Summer, Director
of Wilbur, said the demonstration
showed a lack of self-discipline
and was a childish reaction to
the heat of the day. The ther
mometer had hit 92 degrees
earlier in the day, making it the
hottest day of the year at Stan
ford.

ing clearly through the window,
began to disrobe.
The crowd did not take long to
gather around Branner, but
shouted threats of a panty raid
failed to materialize, because the
men were unable to get inside.
Lights Go Out
At about 10:30 someone broke
into the Wilbur Hall circuit
breaker box and pulled the mas
ter light switch, turning off all
the lights in the dorm for a num
ber of minutes.
After repeated cheers and coun
ter-cheers from Branner women,
the mob moved by foot, car and
any available means to attack
Roble Hall. The tumult aroused
residents from other living
groups in the vicinity, and all
converged on Roble.
Throughout the riot Wilbur
sponsors tried to control the mob.
Police Chief Gordon Davis ap
peared on the Roble scene and
after remonstrating succeeded in
quieting them to some extent.
Phil Berry, a Wilbur sponsor
mounted the garage behind Ro
ble and attempted to quiet the
mob, telling the freshmen below
him that the first 20 who might
get inside would be expelled from
school.
"Hail, Caesar!"
The crowd responded with
cheers of "Hail, Caesar!" and
continued milling about the court
yard.
Some freshmen threw fire
crackers against the women's
dorms, and the women answered
by showering their assailants
with water bombs. No one was
reported hurt, and no damage
was recorded but that done to the
circuit breaker at Wilbur and a
ripped screen at Roble.
By 11 p.m. the raiders began
to disperse. Some threatened to
visit their wrath on Florence
Moore Hall and Lagunita Court,
but most returned to their dorms.
Mrs. Ellene Summer, Director
of Wilbur, said the demonstration
showed a lack of self-discipline
and was a childish reaction to
the heat of the day. The ther
mometer had hit 92 degrees
earlier in the day, making it the
hottest day of the year at Stan
ford.
Eight hundred freshmen-led students rioted and raided Branner
and Roble halls last night. Although no damage was reported, the
raiders vented their Western Civ midterm and hot-weather tensions
on the two freshman women's dorms with shouts and laughter.
The rioting is reported to have begun at about 10 p.m. when a

Branner woman lowered the
shade of her room and, with the
light on and her silhouette show
ing clearly through the window,
began to disrobe.
