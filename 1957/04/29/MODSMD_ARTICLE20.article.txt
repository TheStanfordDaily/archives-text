# Other Than Football

A SPORTS PROGRAM at a university should give
all types of athletes a chance to develop and
demonstrate their skill.
All too many universities throw the complete
sports emphasis on football. "The rest of the
sports are fine," they say, "hut football is the
sport that draws the moucy. So let's put all
our coaching skill and brains into developing
superb gridiron teams, and let the rest of the
sports find their own way."
I Hiially with the end of football season and
always with the end of basketball season, in
terest wanes in sports. Fortunately at Stanford
this problem is becoming less and less a real
worry.
The hiring of track coach Payton Jordan is
an example of a desire to build a well-rounded
athletic program.
"Tin sick and tired of the things we've had
to take from those guys,'" sa : .d Jordan last week
of !iis coming track meet with Occidental Col
lege. "I sincerely believe .we're going to win,
and the team knows darn'well we're going to
win. I don't have a pessimistic bone in my
body." 1
It is true that Stanford's track team dropped
its meet to ()xy, but the point is that the Chuck
Fay lor type of enthusiasm and optimism is not
just confined to football. Since Jordan took

over the reigns of the team, track team mem
bt *rs have had a feeling that people really cared
what they did, and coiiM'ipicntly their perform
ances have been more spirited. We hope the
crowds attending meets grow beyond the 5000
who attended last Saturday's event.
I he swimming team, under the guidance of
Tom Haynie, has won 25 consecutive dual PCC
meets, a record uncqualcd anywhere on the
coast. And Haynie s teams keep winning year
after year.
But the University still has a long way to go
before it gives minor sports the support they
deserve. Last week the Stanford crew spon
sored a jazz concert to raise money so they
could compete in the national championships
in New York.
It is definitely wrong that competitors repre
senting the University, and ones who practice
as much as the crew, should have to earn any
of their money at all. The University would do
well to aid a crew which Ikim gotten practically
nothing in return for all the work tliey have
pill out.
Unless a university gives the boxer, the swim
mer, or the wrestler the same opportunities
and coaching thai are given the football star,
the claim of having a re;il ;ithlctic department
is hollow indeed.
