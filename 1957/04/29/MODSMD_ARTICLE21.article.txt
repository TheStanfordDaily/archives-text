# They Only Laughed

\ F.KL KriSF.R, the 20-year-old Stanford junior
who was beaten by young hoodlums at an
April 12 beach party, will probably not suffer
any aftereffects, according lo the latest hospital
reports.
But Kciser, who suffered a concussion and a
skull fracture, came very close to suffering
permanent brain damage as the result of a
blood clot.
Donald Hawkins, the gang member who
allegedly kicked Keiser into unconsciousness,
only laughed about the incident when he was
brought up for the hearing preceding the trial,
which will be held next week. The rest of the
ringleaders smiled and winked at their friends
in court, even when positively identified by
their Stanford victims as the assailants.

Such a callous attitude can only be due to
two things. Killier the youths have 110 common
sense and decency or they feel reasonably sure
they will got off with a light sentence. We are
afraid it is the latter.
The ringleader and a few of his cohorts who
participated in most of the beatings should
have the stillest possible penalties thrown
against them.
For the first few offenses teen-agers should
have a chance to rehabilitate. Hut all those
coming to trial have police records, and to
allow them to remain practically untouched
would be a danger to society, encouraging them
to greater crimes in the future.
W hen such contempt and callousness are
shown for the law, then the time has arrived
for a harsh penalty.
