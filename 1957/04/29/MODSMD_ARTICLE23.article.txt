Food a Bargain
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate engineering student I find, with
many others in my category, little of interest in
many campus issues. The subject of food, how
ever, is a notable exception. The current hue
and cry over University food prompts me to ask
whether the complainers have any basis for com
parison other than their own mothers' cooking;
also whether they realize the bargain they are
getting for their (or more likely, their parents')
dollar. ♦
My mother is a good cook too, and in my preju
diced way I consider her second to none. I have,
however, eaten food from a few other sources,
such as:
• Duke University, Durham, N.C.—four years.
• Good and bad restaurants in 31 states, as a
truck driver—three months.
• Oil company mess halls—Dutch West Indies
and Venezuela—three years.
• U.S. Army mess halls—two years.
In my opinion, Stanford University puts out

better food than any of Ihe above establishments.
The price charged is lower than that of any
of the above except (4). Admittedly, T do not
eat at Stern Hall, but at Encina. However, I
understand that although Stern has received the
brunt of the grilling, the remainder of the Uni
versity eating facilities have not been excluded
from it. Because of this, I would like it known
that there is at least one student here who likes
the food and has no complaints about it!
Now, the latest hit of nonsense is an appeal
for pressure from the mothers' clubs to improve
dining conditions. Such an appeal seems to run
counter to one of ihe major purposes of a uni
versity, i.e., that of providing an environment
where a student may begin to mature a bit, and
became less dependent upon his mother to grat
ify his every whiro. If this purpose does not get
accomplished in the university, there will be a
few rude jolts awaiting certain individuals short
ly after they leave the shelter of these "hallowed
halls."
