### Leo Krulitz 
Would you like to make better
use of the time you spend eating?
The Lunch Groups sponsored by
the Stanford YVVCA help you do
this by providing friendly, group
discussions and informative
guest speakers on public affairs
and religion at luncheons Tues
days and Thursdays.
These discussions, started five
years ago, have become an impor
tant part of the YWCA program
at Stanford. Between 30 and 100
students usually attend the lunch
eons each week.
The agenda for the Public Af
fairs Luncheons on Tuesday calls
for lunch, a brief talk on some
pertinent topic and lots of discus
sion. Carolyn Leys, a Stanford
senior and membe'r of the "Y"
Cabinel, organizes the program
and introduces ihe speakers.
She describes the value of the
Tuesday luncheon to Stanford
students in this way: "The Tues
day lunch group concerns itself
with 'public affairs,' which can
mean anything from jazz to poli
tics, from teen-age gang warfare
to Russian nuclear physics.
"With wide variety of opinions
and national backgrounds repre
sented, the discussions give stu
dents a chance to see how their
ideas stack up against others, and
to do some really creative think
ing. When we invite a guest
speaker, he usually spends the
hour answering questions spon

taneously, rather than making a
formal speech."
Thursday the subject is reli
gion. Miriam Brattain, director
of the Stanford "Y," explains the
need for such a group in this
way: "Students ask, 'How can we
find out what the different
churches believe?' 'What do pro
fessors in fields other than reli
gion really think and feel about
religion?' The Thursday Reli
gious Discussion group gives stu
dents a chance to suggest names
of those whose views they would
like to hear."
Striving for a variety of views
and opinions, the Public Affairs
group has heard a Socialist, Nick
Simon, speak in defense of the
Socialist Labor party; Alfred, de
Grazia of the Stanford Political
Science Department discuss the
farm problem during the recent
campaign: Wolfgang Panofsky, a
nuclear physicist, describe a trip

lie took to Russia last summer;
and the Berlin Scholars, among
others.
The Religious Discussion group
is under the direction of Dr. Alex
ander Miller of the Stanford Hu
manities Department. He says in
describing the value of the Thurs
day group, "The interests of the
Christian faith are best served
by free discussion of it."
Guest speakers have included
President Sterling who spoke on
his own religious beliefs, Canon
Bryan Green who discussed the
problem of Fundamentalism, Dr.
Spiegelberg of the Asiatic and
Slavic .Studies Department.

She describes the value of the
Tuesday luncheon to Stanford
students in this way: "The Tues
day lunch group concerns itself
with 'public affairs,' which can
mean anything from jazz to poli
tics, from teen-age gang warfare
to Russian nuclear physics.
"With wide variety of opinions
and national backgrounds repre
sented, the discussions give stu
dents a chance to see how their
ideas stack up against others, and
to do some really creative think
ing. When we invite a guest
speaker, he usually spends the
hour answering questions spon

taneously, rather than making a
formal speech."
Thursday the subject is reli
gion. Miriam Brattain, director
of the Stanford "Y," explains the
need for such a group in this
way: "Students ask, 'How can we
find out what the different

gion really think and feel about
religion?' The Thursday Reli
gious Discussion group gives stu
dents a chance to suggest names
of those whose views they would
like to hear."
Striving for a variety of views
and opinions, the Public Affairs
group has heard a Socialist, Nick
Simon, speak in defense of the
Socialist Labor party; Alfred, de
Grazia of the Stanford Political
Science Department discuss the
farm problem during the recent
