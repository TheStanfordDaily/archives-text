# SU Nine Splits UCLA Series; Leopold Preserves 000 ERA
## 
### Bob Payne 
The odds were reversed on the
Stanford varsity nine last week
end when Ihe Cards split a two
game CIBA diamond series with
UCLA, winning the first game,
0-3, but dropping the second, 1-0.
Boh Leopold, ace Indian south
paw, suffered his first loss of the
season in ihe second game on an
unearned r un. Friday, Parker Ol
son's three-run homer had been
enough to down UCLA's fine soph
omore righthander Kirk Wilson.
Many observers had expected a
split in the series, but Wilson and
Leopold were tabbed as the ones
to pick up the wins.
Instead the Bruins' Earl Ford
ham turned in ihe finest pitching
show of the series and his own
career by blanking the Cards on
three hits.
ERA —.000
Fordham struck out four and
walked none while Leopold was
yielding five singles. The Stan
ford ace has yet to give up an
earned run.
Olsen broke up a 3-3 tie in the
top of the eighth of the first game
by powering a tremendous 400-
foot drive over the head of Bruin
center fielder Ernie Rodriquez,
scoring A1 Shaw and Jerry Mor
gan ahead of him. It was the big
oipfielder's" second homer of the
season.
Earlier Olsen had singled home
Stanford's only other earned run.
Walt Payne was the starter and
winner for the Tribe. He pitched
eight and one-third innings, allow
ing only six hits and two earned
runs, before George Avery came
on in the ninth to quell a Bruin
uprising.
Saturday's game saw one of the
finest pitching duels of the sea
son. The Uclans wrapped it up
in the bottom of the first inning
when Bill Mills singled and scored
on an error.
Bit Too Stingy
From then on, Fordham and
Leopold pitched brilliant ball, but
the Bruin senior was just a little
bit too stingy and Stanford could
never tie it up.
Shortstop Steve Stewart, pinch'
hitter Wayne Marion and Leopold
picked up the three lonely safeties
for the Cards.
Stanford's CIBA record now
stands at 5-6 with only five game. 1 -
remaining on the slate. Califor
nia, the Indians' biggest rival foi
the NCAA playoff berth, is 7-3
Tomorrow the Cards travel tc
Santa Clara to meet the last-placf
Broncos, and on Saturday go tc
Berkeley for the first of three re
maining crucials with the Golder
Bears.
The Braves won their fifth
straight , Saturday, beating Sar

Jose JC. 4-3, as Joel Mogy stole
home with the winning 1 un in the
seventh inning.

The odds were reversed on the
Stanford varsity nine last week
end when Ihe Cards split a two
game CIBA diamond series with
UCLA, winning the first game,
0-3, but dropping the second, 1-0.
Boh Leopold, ace Indian south
paw, suffered his first loss of the
season in ihe second game on an
unearned r un. Friday, Parker Ol
son's three-run homer had been
enough to down UCLA's fine soph
omore righthander Kirk Wilson.
Many observers had expected a
split in the series, but Wilson and
Leopold were tabbed as the ones
to pick up the wins.
Instead the Bruins' Earl Ford
ham turned in ihe finest pitching
show of the series and his own
career by blanking the Cards on
three hits.
ERA —.000
Fordham struck out four and
walked none while Leopold was
yielding five singles. The Stan
ford ace has yet to give up an
earned run.
Olsen broke up a 3-3 tie in the
top of the eighth of the first game
by powering a tremendous 400-
foot drive over the head of Bruin
center fielder Ernie Rodriquez,
scoring A1 Shaw and Jerry Mor
gan ahead of him. It was the big
oipfielder's" second homer of the
season.
Earlier Olsen had singled home
Stanford's only other earned run.
Walt Payne was the starter and
winner for the Tribe. He pitched
eight and one-third innings, allow
ing only six hits and two earned
runs, before George Avery came
on in the ninth to quell a Bruin
uprising.
Saturday's game saw one of the
finest pitching duels of the sea
son. The Uclans wrapped it up
in the bottom of the first inning
when Bill Mills singled and scored
on an error.
Bit Too Stingy
From then on, Fordham and
Leopold pitched brilliant ball, but
the Bruin senior was just a little
bit too stingy and Stanford could
never tie it up.
Shortstop Steve Stewart, pinch'
hitter Wayne Marion and Leopold
picked up the three lonely safeties
for the Cards.
