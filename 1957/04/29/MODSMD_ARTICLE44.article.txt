# Nelson Riddle Plays for Junior Prom
## Popular Record Artist Noted for Hit Arrangements 
### Sherry Speer 
Nelson Riddle, one of the prom
inent recorders in the popular
music industry, will be playing
for the Junior Prom at the Fair
mont Hotel in San Francisco this
Friday night. Riddle's popularity,
won as the result of 25 years of
study and hard work, is testi
mony of the fact that success just
doesn't happen overnight.
Riddle was eight years old
when his dad, a New Jersey
farmer, brought home a very
used piano. Lessons promptly be
gan for Nelson, who like any
youngster would much rather
have been out playing baseball
with the rest of the gang.
He showed some aptitude for
the piano and began to appreciate
music. In his teens he started to
make up his own arrangements
of the popular tunes of the day.
In high school he switched from
the piano to the trombone, his
father's favorite instrument.
At the age of 19, only two years
out of high school. Riddle joined
the traveling Jerry Wald Orches
tra, playing the trombone. Later
he joined the newly organized
band of Charlie Spivak. Charlie
let him try out his own arrange
ments in addition to playing his

trombone. The musicians in the
band liked and easily played Rid
dle's arrangements.
With the reputation of a trom
bone player and an arranger,
Riddle sold himself to Tommy
Dorsey, with whom he remained
until he went into the Army a
year later.
Riddle returned to California
after his discharge from the
Army. With the aid of the GI
Bill he went to school to learn
everything he could about com
posing and arranging. He also
took lessons with Mario Castel

nuovo-Tedesco and studied con
ducting with Victor Bay.
The schooling gave him the
confidence he needed to take a
staff arranging job with NBC.
But after three years with the
company, due to the rise of TV
and the simultaneous decline of
radio budgets, Riddle had to look
for another job. He worked for
artists, record companies and
other arrangers on a free-lance
basis until late 1950. Then his
first real break came.
He wrote an arrangement for
Nat "King" Cole. The tune was
"Mona Lisa." The record was a
gigantic success and both Cole
and Capitol Records signed Rid
dle for more of the same. It was
the beginning of a warm friend
ship between the "King" and Rid
dle.
In 1952, Capitol assigned him to
conduct and arrange several
tunes for Ella Mae Morse. After
the session was over, Nelson felt
something was lacking in one of
the tunes, "Blacksmith Blues." It
lacked identification with the
hardworking blacksmith. He de
cided to improvise an anvil beat.
He hit a metal drum part against
a glass ash tray and the effect
was achieved. "Blacksmith
Blues," with its easily distin
guishable and happy beat, went
on to sell over 2,000,000 records.
One year later, Frank Sinatra
was signed by Capitol Records.
It was the first rung on the amaz
ing comeback for Sinatra. Capi
tol assigned Riddle to arrange
and conduct for the new Sinatra
records, "World on a String" and
"From Here to Eternity." The
latter tune was from the picture

Sinatra had just completed and
one year later won an Academy
Award for him. The two records
were successful. Sinatra was re
established as a hitmaker. Nel- 1
son's duties with Sinatra have
since overlapped into motion pic
tures and television.
Late in 1955, Nelson's mana
ger, Carlos Castel, returned from
a vacation in Mexico with a re
cording he had discovered there.
Nelson was to record the tune to |
back up ".Robin Hood," an exploi- j
tat ion number Riddle was record-1
ing to cash in on the success of :
the TV show.
But Robin Hood never emerged
from the forest and the other side
of the record stole the show. "Lis
bon Antigua" turned into a na
tional hit.

NELSON RIDDLE
Plays for Prom
Nelson Riddle, one of the prom
inent recorders in the popular
music industry, will be playing
for the Junior Prom at the Fair
mont Hotel in San Francisco this
Friday night. Riddle's popularity,
won as the result of 25 years of
study and hard work, is testi
mony of the fact that success just
doesn't happen overnight.
Riddle was eight years old
when his dad, a New Jersey
farmer, brought home a very
used piano. Lessons promptly be
gan for Nelson, who like any
youngster would much rather
have been out playing baseball
with the rest of the gang.
He showed some aptitude for
the piano and began to appreciate
music. In his teens he started to
make up his own arrangements
of the popular tunes of the day.
In high school he switched from
the piano to the trombone, his
father's favorite instrument.
At the age of 19, only two years
out of high school. Riddle joined
the traveling Jerry Wald Orches
tra, playing the trombone. Later
he joined the newly organized
band of Charlie Spivak. Charlie
let him try out his own arrange
ments in addition to playing his

trombone. The musicians in the
band liked and easily played Rid
dle's arrangements.
With the reputation of a trom
bone player and an arranger,
Riddle sold himself to Tommy
Dorsey, with whom he remained
until he went into the Army a
year later.
Riddle returned to California
after his discharge from the
Army. With the aid of the GI
Bill he went to school to learn
everything he could about com
posing and arranging. He also
took lessons with Mario Castel

nuovo-Tedesco and studied con
ducting with Victor Bay.
The schooling gave him the
confidence he needed to take a
staff arranging job with NBC.
But after three years with the
company, due to the rise of TV
and the simultaneous decline of
radio budgets, Riddle had to look
for another job. He worked for
artists, record companies and
other arrangers on a free-lance
basis until late 1950. Then his
first real break came.
He wrote an arrangement for
Nat "King" Cole. The tune was
"Mona Lisa." The record was a
gigantic success and both Cole
and Capitol Records signed Rid
dle for more of the same. It was
the beginning of a warm friend
ship between the "King" and Rid
dle.
In 1952, Capitol assigned him to
conduct and arrange several
tunes for Ella Mae Morse. After
the session was over, Nelson felt
something was lacking in one of
the tunes, "Blacksmith Blues." It
lacked identification with the
hardworking blacksmith. He de
cided to improvise an anvil beat.
He hit a metal drum part against
a glass ash tray and the effect
was achieved. "Blacksmith
Blues," with its easily distin
guishable and happy beat, went
on to sell over 2,000,000 records.
One year later, Frank Sinatra
was signed by Capitol Records.
It was the first rung on the amaz
ing comeback for Sinatra. Capi
tol assigned Riddle to arrange
and conduct for the new Sinatra
records, "World on a String" and
"From Here to Eternity." The
latter tune was from the picture

Sinatra had just completed and
one year later won an Academy
Award for him. The two records
were successful. Sinatra was re
established as a hitmaker. Nel- 1

a glass ash tray and the effect
was achieved. "Blacksmith
Blues," with its easily distin
guishable and happy beat, went
on to sell over 2,000,000 records.
One year later, Frank Sinatra
was signed by Capitol Records.
It was the first rung on the amaz
ing comeback for Sinatra. Capi
tol assigned Riddle to arrange
and conduct for the new Sinatra
records, "World on a String" and
"From Here to Eternity." The
latter tune was from the picture

Sinatra had just completed and
one year later won an Academy
Award for him. The two records
were successful. Sinatra was re
established as a hitmaker. Nel- 1
son's duties with Sinatra have
since overlapped into motion pic
tures and television.
Late in 1955, Nelson's mana
ger, Carlos Castel, returned from
a vacation in Mexico with a re
cording he had discovered there.
Nelson was to record the tune to |
back up ".Robin Hood," an exploi- j
tat ion number Riddle was record-1
ing to cash in on the success of :
the TV show.
But Robin Hood never emerged
from the forest and the other side
of the record stole the show. "Lis
bon Antigua" turned into a na
tional hit.
