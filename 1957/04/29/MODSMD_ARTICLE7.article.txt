WARM WEATHER FRIENDS—After exciting
themselves and freshman women in Branner
Hall, a spirited mol» of students moved swiftly
to Roble Hall. A few firecrackers and water

bombs were exchanged, but no injuries were
reported and only minor damage occurred as
the lights went out at Wilbur and a screen was
ripped at Roble. —Daily Photo by Neale Creamer
