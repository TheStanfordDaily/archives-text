# Eyes on Jordan
## 
### 
THE WORLD is focusing its worried eyes on a
small, almost totally desert state in the Middle
East, Jordan.
The scene of recent political upheavals,
Jordan assumes its present importance not he
cause it occupies a strategic geographical posi
tion, or controls a strategic resource, but be
cause this kingdom of Bedouins has a good
chance of being the test site for the Eisenhower
I toctrine.
< onununism has proven lo be a definite
menace in the Middle East. Observers need
onlv note ils strength in Syria and its influence
with the government in Egypt. These two lat
ter ■ mentioned nations are two points of a
triangle, of which Saudi Arabia is the third,
thai encloses not onl\ Jordan but Israel as well.
And Israel is the normal hot spot of the Near
East.
Fortunately for the Western nations, and
especial!) for Jordan, the three apexes of the
triangle are not in agreement on the advisa
bility of letting leftist influences control Jordan.
Long fearful of (lommunism, King Sand of
Saudi Arabia has deserted his bosom com
panion el the "destroy Israel period. President
Nasser, and has hitched his slpr together with
King Eeisal's of Iraq in a direction that de
lights the Western world.
This breach of relations between members
of the Arab world points up the long suspected
fact that there is onl\ one issue capable of

creating solidarity among !lio Arab states —
"Destroy Israel. *
Fiui of great significance in litis Jordanian
crisis is I lie I act lliat the vaunted and feared
leadership of .Nasser lias failed to materialize.
The Egyptian president has tried hard to aet
as spokesman for the whole Arah world. And
in this respect the West may have heen unduly
respectful of Nasser's power, (lertainly, much
of the wind has heen taken out of Nasser's
sails because of the unwillingness of Saudi
Arabia and iia<| lo follow the advice and pre
cepts of Nasser.
According lo the latest reports from Jordan,
the situation seems quiet and there is reason
to believe that it will resolve itself as the
Western nations hope.
It is doubtful if the I nited States will be
called upon lo assist by armed intervention at
the request of Jordan's King Hussein. It would
not be at all expedient in these limes of ex
treme nationalistic feelings for Hussein not
really a popular king lo enli>l aid from the
United States unless it were absolutely neces
sary.
Hut if the situation do<*s become worse, we
can he sure that Eisenhower and I tulles will
not miss this opportunity lo regain face after
having been forced to knuckle down to the
demands of Nasser over the Sue/, ( anal op
erations.
I he presence of the Sixth Elect just off the
coast of Syria is a sure indication that we mean
business. Even Nasser can see that.
