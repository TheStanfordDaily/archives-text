# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Dave Canfield
## Spring Antics Not Confined to Wilbur Frosh 
### 
The tendency to regard American universities
as "institutions of higher education" was dimin
ished last week by stories drifting in from other
folloge campuses.
From David C. Henley's pen in the University
of Southern California Daily Trojan comes a
critique of the soft life led by Stanford women.
Stanford women don't have to worry about be
ing accepted by sororities because there are no
sororities here, he wrote.
He added that they have no anxiety about
dates because there are "at least 10" unattached
men to every woman student. And here comes
the clincher they don't have to study, said Hen
ley, because the University's Honor Code permits
students to take their examinations any place
they please —even in bed.

In a newly decorated and newlv carpeted soro
rity house at Purdue University, Indiana, women
awoke one morning to find a bull ruining their
new living room. The fraternity men responsible
were immediately dismissed from school.
* * *
Harvard Square was ablaze several weeks ago
when the Harvard University Crimson office was
set on fire. Cambridge, Mass., fire inspectors
have turned up no clues, except that it appeared
to be the job of some "angry reader."
* * *
At the University of Texas, an unidentified
student has claimed he's all for large lecture
classes. Having been assigned to a folding chair

at the very back of (bo lecture hall, he folded it
up at the start of this semester and carted it
off no empty seat for the roll checker to see.
#
A similar student wrote to the "Dear Maxine"
column in the Oregon Daily Emerald, saying, "I
have been a student here at the U of O for two
terms and have never attended a class. . . . But,
Maxine, my problem is that every time I go
through registration and get to Hip place where
you pay they always take away the card with
the location of classes on it."
"Maxine' admitted this problem floored her
and advised her frantic reader to consult "Ann
Landers."

"To bee or not 1o bee" was Ihe problem of stu
dents at UCLA last Wednesday. As the UCLA
Daily Bruin wrote, "Thousands of angry yellow
bees took over the Royce Hall Library quad yes
terday morning, leaving a trail of fleeing stu
dents in their wake. . . .
"Two possible reasons have been given for the
sneak attack. The bees are either swarming or
have had their hive destroyed, according 1o a
swell-headed spectator allegedly on his way to
the Med Center for treatment."
Last Friday was ;i day of days for students
at that Los Angeles institution variously known
as USC', Troy and Jon-Arnett Land. Friday was
Troy Disneyland Day ;it Walt Disney's amuse
ment park, whore throngs of eager s'c students
had the thrills of their lives for half price.

At the University of Texas, an unidentified
student has claimed he's all for large lecture
classes. Having been assigned to a folding chair

at the very back of (bo lecture hall, he folded it
up at the start of this semester and carted it
off no empty seat for the roll checker to see.

A similar student wrote to the "Dear Maxine"
column in the Oregon Daily Emerald, saying, "I
have been a student here at the U of O for two
terms and have never attended a class. . . . But,
Maxine, my problem is that every time I go
through registration and get to Hip place where
you pay they always take away the card with
the location of classes on it."
"Maxine' admitted this problem floored her
and advised her frantic reader to consult "Ann
Landers."

"To bee or not 1o bee" was Ihe problem of stu
dents at UCLA last Wednesday. As the UCLA
Daily Bruin wrote, "Thousands of angry yellow
bees took over the Royce Hall Library quad yes
terday morning, leaving a trail of fleeing stu
dents in their wake. . . .
"Two possible reasons have been given for the
sneak attack. The bees are either swarming or
have had their hive destroyed, according 1o a
swell-headed spectator allegedly on his way to
the Med Center for treatment."
Last Friday was ;i day of days for students
at that Los Angeles institution variously known
as USC', Troy and Jon-Arnett Land. Friday was
Troy Disneyland Day ;it Walt Disney's amuse
ment park, whore throngs of eager s'c students
had the thrills of their lives for half price.
The tendency to regard American universities
as "institutions of higher education" was dimin
ished last week by stories drifting in from other
folloge campuses.
From David C. Henley's pen in the University
of Southern California Daily Trojan comes a
critique of the soft life led by Stanford women.
Stanford women don't have to worry about be
ing accepted by sororities because there are no
sororities here, he wrote.
He added that they have no anxiety about
dates because there are "at least 10" unattached
men to every woman student. And here comes
the clincher they don't have to study, said Hen
ley, because the University's Honor Code permits
students to take their examinations any place
they please —even in bed.
