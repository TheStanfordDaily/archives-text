## 1207 Subscribers Get Daily With Help of PO, SP Railway 
### Dave Canfield 
"Send The Daily Home."
Operating under this laudable
slogan, The Daily's circulation
staff floods the mails with 1207
copies of Stanford's "only morn
ing newspaper" each weekday.
Thp 1207 subscribers include
one each living in the West In
dies, Italy, Mexico, the Philip
pines and Germany; two live in
Switzerland and three in Canada.
Distribution of The Daily to
such "faraway places" and to
nearer spots as well begins in
the early morning of each day of
publication when circulation staff
member Bill Jacobson runs the
papers through the addresso
graph machine and wraps them.
Addressograpli Machine
In Ihe addressograph machine,
ink runs through a stencil card to
print an address on each paper.
Then the papers are bundled ac
cording to a system worked out
recently by the Palo Alio Post
Office.
Under this system, if more
Ihan five papers go to any one
general area, those papers are
tied together and put on one m;iil
train. For example, all subscrib
ers in the Great Northwest re
ceive their papers via Southern
Pacific's m;iil train No. 2b.
11 any state or city includes
more than five Daily subscribers,

it also receives a separate bundle.
Though only a small town of few
er than 10,000 people, Highland
Park, 111., boasts more than five
persons who take The Daily and
gets a separate mailing bundle.
87 Kiimlies
In -nil. the circulation staff
makes 87 bundles, including 20
for greater Los Angeles alone.
Deadline for getting papers to
the Stanford Post Office is 2:30
p.m. on the day of publication.
For papers destined for any
where within the United States
or its territories, The Daily pays
a bulk rate of 1 V- cents a pound
or 's-cent apiece, whichever is
more expensive.
Campus Deliveries
Mail trains en route for most
areas leave Palo Alto at 3:15 and
(5:30 p.m. and all papers are on
their way to their destinations by
9 p.m. on tiie publication date.
The Daily also delivers 7600
copies every weekday to 70 stra
tegic campus spots, with Bill Gar
net t handling the paper - boy
chores in his car.
If Garnett is sick, his fraternity
brothers at the Alpha Delta Phi
house pitch in to help him out.
Hence, the paper always goes
through and and generally the
only campus spot where a read
er can't obtain a current copy is
in the Daily shack itself.
