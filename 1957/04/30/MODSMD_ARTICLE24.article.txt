"GOOD GRIEF STANFORD CLINCHES
CONFERENCE TENNIS TITLE FOR UCLA"
This headline appeared last Friday in the Daily California!! over
a story which read, "An alternate number six man on the Stanford
lennis team clinched the conference title for UCLA, in the PCC divi
sion of the O.jai Valley tennis tournament yesterday.
"Stanford's Stafford Carson upset USC's number two man, Ed
Atkinson, 8-(j, 6-3, to dash all Trojan hopes for the team title."
Congratulations, Stafford. The "Benchwarmer" is glatl to see
enterprising Stanford roughs forging ahead. Only one thing
wrong, though—despite the Cal paper's starring account, Carson
plays for UCLA.
University of Washington is shooting for its 20th Northern Divi
sion tennis title this spring. The Huskies also boast a string of 70
straight dual meet wins.
And this skein does not stand to be broken soon. As graduate
student and coach Glenn Linden says, "It's the strongest squad
we have had since the 1.952 team of Bill Quillian, Ray Albano and
Don Flye."

Stanford's sophomore speedballer Bob Leopold is the third pitch
er in CIBA history to pitch a no-hit no-run baseball game, according
to research done by Garry Short in the USC Daily Trojan.
The first no-hitter came in 1937 when SC's Joe Gonzales blanked
Stanford, 8-0, and in the second no-hitter in 1954 the Trojans also
figured.
In that "no-no'' lilt, Santa Clara's Bob Lanbacher defeated SC,
30.
Cornelius Warmerdam, whose world pole vault record of 15-7%
was broken by Bob Gutowski Saturday, is said by the UCLA Daily
Bruin to have cleared 13* feet at the age of 40. According to the Daily
Bruin, Coach Ducky Drake feels Uclan pole vaulter George Roubanis,
though ineligible this quarter for transfer reasons, will be pressing
the world record soon.

Elsewhere in the PCC, football—spring style, that is—is king.
In a USC grid practice last Thursday, Charles C. Stewart, an elderly
member of the Trojan Club, suffered a broken leg when, as DT
writer Chuck Signor said, "four husky footballers swept, across the
sidelines and into him on an end sweep."
Stewart had this comment, "I've been an ardent Trojan rooter
for years but this is the hardest hitting team of them all."
Of teams eligible for the Rose Bowl namely, California, Oregon,
Washington and Stanford—there appears to'be no real standout, as
writers from the other three schools have tacitly admitted.
Our uneducated guess is Washington. If the Huskies don't have
their whole I earn in the hospital after their first three games next
fall —Colorado, Minnesota and Ohio State —the UW eleven could
be rough.
A new coach—Jim Owens—and a veteran team—with 19 letter
men could well have Seattleites sniffing roses on New Year's Day,
1958.
While-only 5-5 on the season this last autumn, the Huskies are
loaded, especially in ihe backfield. UW Daily writer Eldon Coroch
said the northern team "has got a lot of good horses . . . and there
are a lot of touchdowns stored in those powerful legs."
Coroch has a point. Runners like Luther Carr, Mike McCluskey,
Jim Jones and Dick Payseno are hard to stop and passes like those
of Al Ferguson are difficult to thwart. Such men are going to score,
even behind a so-so line. .
And (lie Husky forward crew, bulwarked by IMO pounder Dick
Day, is not so-so.

When Stanford's golfers downed the UCLA Bruins, 18-9, on .Sat
urday, April 20, the Indian linksmen played what Daily Bruin sports
writer Judd Swarzman called "the best golf of any college team in
Ihe country this year."
