# Trackmen to Close Dual Meet Season Against Cal at Berkeley
## Saturday Marks 62nd Running of Big Meet; Stanford Rated Slight Favorite Over Bears 
### 
Stanford has its final dual meet
of the 1957 track and field season
Saturday when the Indians face
California in the Big Meet at
Berkeley. The rivalry is the Stan
ford trackmen's oldest and also
one of the closest.
Stanford and Cal have met ev
ery year since 1893 with the ex
ception of 1944-45, when the In
dians didn't field a team, and 1906.
The Cards have won 32 of Ihe
battles, 28 have gone to Califor
nia. and in 1922 the teams fought
to a 65'/a-65Ms tie.
It took the Tribe a long time
to get started, however. The Bears
won the first meet—or field day,
as it was called Ihen—by a lop
sided 91-35 score.
In 1894 Stanford showed prog
ress, picking up 36 points to just
90 for California. The Daily Palo
Alto—the Stanford Daily of those
days dryly observed it would be
just 27 more years until Ihe In
dians got a lie, if they kept im
proving at the rate of a point a
year.
It didn't take 27 years for Stan
ford to stop losing, but it did take
them into the next century. In
1903 E. W. Moulton, in his second
year as head coach, directed the
Stanfords to a narrow 63Mt-58%
victory.
The teams split about even until
1913, when the Indians started a

string of seven straight wins with
a spine-tingling 61'/-, victory, j
This meet was won by the Tribe
on a re-run race—an unheard-of
"thing today.
When Ihe 220-yard dash had
been run, judges disagreed as to
whether Fui Wood of Cal or Paul
McKee of Stanford should be
placed second. After an hour of i
argument, during which the rest
of the meet was run off, the
judges decided to have a rematch
between McKee and Wo o d for
second.
Why Ihe Cal judges agreed to
run the race over was never quite
figured out, since the Bears would
have won the meet if McKee and
Wood had been given a dead heat.
But the race was run over, McKee
won by a yard, and the Indians
won the mpet by two-fifths point.
Stanford's longest winning
streak in the series came during
the 1924-34 period, when Dink
Tempi e t on's teams won 11
straight. Included in that string
was the 1931 victory by the lop
sided score of 101%-29|<», the most
one-sided meet of the rivalry and
the only time either team has
I scored over 100 points.
Saturday Stanford will again be
i favored, but only by the thinnest
I of margins. And, judging by past
1 Big Meets, form means little.

victory.
The teams split about even until
1913, when the Indians started a

string of seven straight wins with
a spine-tingling 61'/-, victory, j
This meet was won by the Tribe
on a re-run race—an unheard-of
"thing today.
When Ihe 220-yard dash had
been run, judges disagreed as to
whether Fui Wood of Cal or Paul
McKee of Stanford should be
placed second. After an hour of i
argument, during which the rest
of the meet was run off, the
judges decided to have a rematch
between McKee and Wo o d for
second.
Why Ihe Cal judges agreed to
run the race over was never quite
figured out, since the Bears would
have won the meet if McKee and
Wood had been given a dead heat.
But the race was run over, McKee
won by a yard, and the Indians
won the mpet by two-fifths point.
Stanford's longest winning
streak in the series came during
the 1924-34 period, when Dink
Tempi e t on's teams won 11
straight. Included in that string
was the 1931 victory by the lop
sided score of 101%-29|<», the most
one-sided meet of the rivalry and
the only time either team has
I scored over 100 points.
Saturday Stanford will again be
i favored, but only by the thinnest
I of margins. And, judging by past
1 Big Meets, form means little.
Stanford has its final dual meet
of the 1957 track and field season
Saturday when the Indians face
California in the Big Meet at
Berkeley. The rivalry is the Stan
ford trackmen's oldest and also
one of the closest.
Stanford and Cal have met ev
ery year since 1893 with the ex
ception of 1944-45, when the In
dians didn't field a team, and 1906.
The Cards have won 32 of Ihe
battles, 28 have gone to Califor
nia. and in 1922 the teams fought
to a 65'/a-65Ms tie.
It took the Tribe a long time
to get started, however. The Bears
won the first meet—or field day,
as it was called Ihen—by a lop
sided 91-35 score.
In 1894 Stanford showed prog
ress, picking up 36 points to just
90 for California. The Daily Palo
Alto—the Stanford Daily of those
days dryly observed it would be
just 27 more years until Ihe In
dians got a lie, if they kept im
proving at the rate of a point a
year.
It didn't take 27 years for Stan
ford to stop losing, but it did take
them into the next century. In
1903 E. W. Moulton, in his second
year as head coach, directed the
Stanfords to a narrow 63Mt-58%
victory.
