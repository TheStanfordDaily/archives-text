# More Than 90 Out for Spring Football Drills
## 
### 
More than 90 football candi
dates turned out for spring prac
tice yesterday afternoon, under
the hot sun. .
Coach Chuck Taylor and his |
staff put the '57 potential fall
gladiators through a light work
out that consisted of running a i
number of plays to familiarize the
players with the Card system. |
Contact was held to a minimum
at the line of scrimmage.
The candidates we r e broken |
down into groups. The two that
received the most attention were
composed of the most promising
returning veterans. One was quar
ter backed by Jack Douglas and |
Ihe other by Jack Taylor.
Buck fields
In the ba'ckfield wilh Douglas
were halfbacks A 1 Napoleon and
Jeri McMillin; his fullback was
Jim Byrer. Taylor's halfbacks
were Chuck Shea and A 1 Har
rington; Lou Valli was at the full
back slot.
Dick Stein and Ben Robinson
were at Ihe ends for Douglas. His
guards were Don Manoukian and
Meigs Jones, and the tackles were
John Kidd and Ty Polieh. Russ
Steele was at center.
Taylor's line had Joel Freis and
Gary Van Galder at ends. The
guard spots were manned by Noel
Robinson and John Clark; i t the
tackle posts were Troy
and Eric Protiva. Roch Conklin j
was at ihe pivot spot.
Notables Missing
Notably missing among the
squad were All-American signal
caller John Brodie and Ail-Ameri
can tackle Paul Wiggin. Other
missing starters were end Carl
Isaacs, guard Donn Carswell, cen
ter Bob Long and halfbacks Gordy
Young and Paul Camera. All
seven are seniors and have used
up their eligibility.
Also missing was hard-running
halfback Doug Dick, fastest man i
on last year's team. He broke a !
leg playing rugby and probably
will pass up competition this fall.
Those Extra Points
The Indians compiled a disap-1
pointing 4-fi record last fall. Three '
of the losses, however, were via ;
the extra-point route. This fall's
schedule appears somewhat easier
this spring than did the '56 lineup
last April.
Gone are the always rough Big
Ten States, Michigan and Ohio. In
their place are Northwestern and
Rice. The Wildcat game will be
played at home, and the South
west contest with the Owls will be
at Houston.
What appears to be another
break is the insertion of Oregon
between the UCLA and USC
games. Last year Ihe Cards met
the two on successive Saturdays.

John Kidd and Ty Polieh. Russ
Steele was at center.
Taylor's line had Joel Freis and
Gary Van Galder at ends. The
guard spots were manned by Noel
Robinson and John Clark; i t the
tackle posts were Troy
and Eric Protiva. Roch Conklin j
was at ihe pivot spot.
Notables Missing
Notably missing among the
squad were All-American signal
caller John Brodie and Ail-Ameri
can tackle Paul Wiggin. Other
missing starters were end Carl
Isaacs, guard Donn Carswell, cen
ter Bob Long and halfbacks Gordy
Young and Paul Camera. All
seven are seniors and have used
up their eligibility.
Also missing was hard-running
halfback Doug Dick, fastest man i
on last year's team. He broke a !
leg playing rugby and probably
will pass up competition this fall.
Those Extra Points
The Indians compiled a disap-1
pointing 4-fi record last fall. Three '
of the losses, however, were via ;
the extra-point route. This fall's
schedule appears somewhat easier
this spring than did the '56 lineup
last April.
Gone are the always rough Big
Ten States, Michigan and Ohio. In
their place are Northwestern and
Rice. The Wildcat game will be
played at home, and the South
west contest with the Owls will be
at Houston.
What appears to be another
break is the insertion of Oregon
between the UCLA and USC
games. Last year Ihe Cards met
the two on successive Saturdays.
More than 90 football candi
dates turned out for spring prac
tice yesterday afternoon, under
the hot sun. .
