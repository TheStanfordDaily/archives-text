# India, Pakistan Representatives Observe America, Institutions
## Visitors See S.U. as Part of United States Tour; Aim to Inform People About U.S., World Affairs 
### Barbara Bachman 
To inform the people about
United States and world affairs
and to expose false Russian prop
aganda are the chief goals of the
United States Information Serv
ice (USIS), according to two
Asian USIS representatives.
Jayawant D. Dalvi from India
and Syed Jalaluddin Alvi from
Pakistan visited the campus Fri
day as part of their observation
of America, its citizens and insti
tutions.
Employed by the government
of the United States, Dalvi and
Alvi are working in their respec
tive agencies to inform their
countrymen of U.S. policies,
views, positions and especially of
aid and services given them by
this country.
"Best Friends"
"Pakistan is one of the best
friends of the United States in
Asia," Alvi said. The USIS has
explained through all channels of
mass communication the help the
U.S. is giving that country. "The
people are very well informed,"
he continued.
"There's a lot of interest in the
American Negro problem," Dalvi
said, in commenting on U.S. in
ternal affairs. "It is similar to
our problem of untouchables," he
continued. "I don't think we'll
have such ;i problem (as you are
having i, because our constitution
guarantees equal rights to all of
its people.
"Moreover the conflict between
the federal and state govern
ments in your country doesn't ex
ist in India. Anyone seen posting
or enforcing a notice or sign de
manding untouchable segrega
tion is immediately arrested arrd
put in jail," lie explained.

Untouchables still are reluctant
to enter temples or "high class
hotels and restaurants" because
of their former prohibition, but
this situation is gradually lessen
ing.
Because we have no outward
means of identifying and distin
guishing untouchables from high
class Hindus, as you do in skin
color, our problem of abolishing
segregation is even less serious,
he explained.
Communist countries spend
more money on propaganda than
the United States, the USIS men
said. The main point of attack in
Communist literature is the capi
talist economic system.
The mainstay of capitalism is
competition, and this inevitably
leads to war, the Communist
propaganda says. U.S. govern
ment is only a tool of capitalism,
and thus the exploitation of small
groups is caused by economic,
not political conditions.
Communist Influence
Communist influence is strong
er in India than Pakistan, the
newsmen said. One whole Indian
state is Communist controlled.
And by hiring the poor people in
Pakistan, Communists are gain
ing a stronger foothold there, too,
they continued.
USIS agencies are established
in all countries where American
embassies are located. This in
cludes nearly all peoples of the
world, excepting Red China, they
said.
"We feel we reach our people
100 per cent," Dalvi and Alvi said,
in commenting on the effective
ness of their projects. Libraries,
press releases, films, exhibits and
phonograph records are available
to everyone, they said.

U.S. is giving that country. "The
people are very well informed,"

"There's a lot of interest in the
American Negro problem," Dalvi
said, in commenting on U.S. in
ternal affairs. "It is similar to
our problem of untouchables," he
continued. "I don't think we'll
have such ;i problem (as you are
having i, because our constitution
guarantees equal rights to all of
its people.
"Moreover the conflict between
the federal and state govern
ments in your country doesn't ex
ist in India. Anyone seen posting
or enforcing a notice or sign de
manding untouchable segrega
tion is immediately arrested arrd
put in jail," lie explained.

Untouchables still are reluctant
to enter temples or "high class
hotels and restaurants" because
of their former prohibition, but
this situation is gradually lessen
ing.
Because we have no outward
means of identifying and distin
guishing untouchables from high
class Hindus, as you do in skin
color, our problem of abolishing
segregation is even less serious,
he explained.
Communist countries spend
more money on propaganda than
the United States, the USIS men
said. The main point of attack in
Communist literature is the capi
talist economic system.
The mainstay of capitalism is
competition, and this inevitably
leads to war, the Communist
propaganda says. U.S. govern
ment is only a tool of capitalism,
and thus the exploitation of small
groups is caused by economic,
not political conditions.
Communist Influence
Communist influence is strong
er in India than Pakistan, the
newsmen said. One whole Indian
state is Communist controlled.
And by hiring the poor people in
Pakistan, Communists are gain
ing a stronger foothold there, too,
they continued.
USIS agencies are established
in all countries where American
embassies are located. This in
cludes nearly all peoples of the
world, excepting Red China, they
said.
"We feel we reach our people
100 per cent," Dalvi and Alvi said,
in commenting on the effective
ness of their projects. Libraries,
press releases, films, exhibits and
phonograph records are available
to everyone, they said.
To inform the people about
United States and world affairs
and to expose false Russian prop
