# Atom Smasher Successful in Cancer Check
## Stanford Med Students Say That Two-thirds Of Patients Aided 
### 
Gratifying results In the treat
ment of deep cancer with a "baby
atom smasher" were reported
yesterday by two Stanford Medi
cal School radiologists to the Cal
ifornia Medical Association held
in Los Angeles.
The report was the first dis- j
closure of cancer therapy results
with Ihe school's six-million-volt
linear accelerator since it began I
operating in January, 1956, and
was made by Dr. Malcolm A. Bag
shaw and Dr. Henry S. Kaplan.
The report stated that two
thirds, or 48 of 74 patients, re
sponded to treatment and all
traces of malignancy disap
peared. Treatment failed to help
21 other persons and in five other
cases the malignancy disappeared
but cancer already had spread to
other parts of the body.
"Apparent Control"
The Stanford radiologists said
that although cancer had been i
erased in the "apparent control" j
cases, a new tumor growth could j
begin at any time. They cau- i
tioned that it would be five to 10
years before use of the word
"cure" could be considered in dis
cussions of the disease.
The small atom smasher used ,
in the treatment is a scaled-down I
version of one used in regular nu- |
clear research. It provides high
energy to deliver X - rays at a 1
deeper level than conventional
machines and penetrates bone, 1
fat and other tissues with equal
ease.
Variety of Tumors
The report stated that the
treatment had been used on a
wide variety of tumors, including
those of the throat, lung, pros
tate, kidney, bladder, bone and
brain. The tumors that vanished
ranged from football-size to tiny
retinoblastomas of the eye.
Inside a six • foot - long copper
lube, Ihe medical accelerator
speeds electrons to almost Ihe ve
locily of light. Emerging from
(he luhr, the electron beam is con
verted to X-rays by passing it j
through discs of gold and brass.
A lead shutter adjusts the beam j
to ;i mere pinpoint or spreads it
out as required for therapy.
Experimental Tests
Experimental tests of ;i higher
energy accelerator, the 70-million
volt Mark IV, have been going on
for some time on the Stanford
campus. The radiologists plan to
use the Mark IV's electron beam
without converting it to X-rays, !
hoping to treat deep tumors that
overlie vital structures which
might be damaged by X radiation.

Experimental Tests
Experimental tests of ;i higher
energy accelerator, the 70-million
volt Mark IV, have been going on
for some time on the Stanford
campus. The radiologists plan to
use the Mark IV's electron beam
without converting it to X-rays, !
hoping to treat deep tumors that
overlie vital structures which
might be damaged by X radiation.
Gratifying results In the treat
ment of deep cancer with a "baby
atom smasher" were reported
yesterday by two Stanford Medi
cal School radiologists to the Cal
ifornia Medical Association held
in Los Angeles.
The report was the first dis- j
closure of cancer therapy results
with Ihe school's six-million-volt
linear accelerator since it began I
operating in January, 1956, and
was made by Dr. Malcolm A. Bag
shaw and Dr. Henry S. Kaplan.
The report stated that two
thirds, or 48 of 74 patients, re
sponded to treatment and all
traces of malignancy disap
peared. Treatment failed to help
21 other persons and in five other
cases the malignancy disappeared
but cancer already had spread to
other parts of the body.
"Apparent Control"
The Stanford radiologists said
that although cancer had been i
erased in the "apparent control" j
cases, a new tumor growth could j
begin at any time. They cau- i
tioned that it would be five to 10
years before use of the word
"cure" could be considered in dis
cussions of the disease.
The small atom smasher used ,
in the treatment is a scaled-down I
version of one used in regular nu- |
clear research. It provides high
energy to deliver X - rays at a 1
deeper level than conventional
machines and penetrates bone, 1
fat and other tissues with equal
ease.
Variety of Tumors
The report stated that the
treatment had been used on a
wide variety of tumors, including
those of the throat, lung, pros
tate, kidney, bladder, bone and
brain. The tumors that vanished
ranged from football-size to tiny
retinoblastomas of the eye.
