### Barbara Hicks 
The world's oldest art, dancing, was featured on the stage of Me
morial Auditorium in last night's Tuesday Evening Series, as an
appreciative audience viewed dance excerpts from Slavic festivals.
Anatol Joukowski, assisted by his wife, Yania Wassilieva, directed
dancers from Chang's International Folk Dancers and the San Fran-

Cisco Dance Guild in the perform
ance of five groups of dances.
Mrs. Miriam Lidster, assistant
professor of women's physical ed
ucation, described the scenes.
Dance as Hobby
The 29 dancers who appeared
on the stage all dance as a hobby.
Most of the embroidery work on
the colorful costumes worn in the
performance of the intricate
steps is done by the dancers.
The director is the former mas
ter of ballet and choreography
for the State Theater of Yugo
slavia, in Belgrade, and his wife
was prima ballerina of the com
pany. They have worked in the
area the past four year.
Impressive backgrounds de
signed by E. Orlovsky and V. Je
drinsky added color to the scenes,
the first in the market of a town
of Fergana in Uzbekistan, a coun
try bordering on Persia. Hand
movements characterized the
Doyra Harvest Dance, which was
done by 10 women to a rhythmic
drum beat. A lively Saber Dance
followed.
Enthusiastically Received
The precision of Bulgarian
dances was enthusiastically re
ceived by the audience. Mrs. Lid
ster explained that the most char
acteristic Bulgarian dance was
the Horo, which might be done
on any festive occasion.
The third and fourth scenes
were in Cephalonia Island, neat-
Turkey, and in Serbia, respec
tively, and dances were gay,
based either on ritual or secular
themes. The Serbian section was
highlighted by a candlelight scene
as soldiers went off to war. •


WORLD'S OLDEST ART —Excerpts from Slavic festivals were
performed on the Memorial Auditorium stage last night by '49
dancers. In this scene —the first of five —dancers from (Jiang's
International Folk Dance group and the San Francisco Dance
Guild depict the IJoyra Harvest Dance by hand movements' done

The world's oldest art, dancing, was featured on the stage of Me
morial Auditorium in last night's Tuesday Evening Series, as an
appreciative audience viewed dance excerpts from Slavic festivals.
Anatol Joukowski, assisted by his wife, Yania Wassilieva, directed
dancers from Chang's International Folk Dancers and the San Fran-

Cisco Dance Guild in the perform
ance of five groups of dances.
Mrs. Miriam Lidster, assistant
professor of women's physical ed
ucation, described the scenes.
Dance as Hobby
The 29 dancers who appeared
on the stage all dance as a hobby.
Most of the embroidery work on
the colorful costumes worn in the
performance of the intricate
steps is done by the dancers.
The director is the former mas
ter of ballet and choreography
for the State Theater of Yugo
slavia, in Belgrade, and his wife
was prima ballerina of the com
pany. They have worked in the
area the past four year.
Impressive backgrounds de
signed by E. Orlovsky and V. Je
drinsky added color to the scenes,
the first in the market of a town
of Fergana in Uzbekistan, a coun
try bordering on Persia. Hand
movements characterized the
Doyra Harvest Dance, which was
done by 10 women to a rhythmic
drum beat. A lively Saber Dance
followed.
