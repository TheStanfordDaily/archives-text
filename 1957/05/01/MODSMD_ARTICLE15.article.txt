# U.S. Charges Russian Influence In Efforts to Overthrow Hussein
## Jordan Rejects Russ Charge; Accepts $10 Million in U.S. Aid Hussein Says 'No Basis' for Russia's Saying United States Interfered in Jordanian Affairs 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP)—The United States accused Russia
today of backing (he recent effort to overthrow the pro-Western
government of King Hussein in Jordan.
The S(ate Department made the accusation in replying to Soviet
charges that the United States was promoting "outright foreign

interference" in Middle Eastern
affairs.
Department Press Officer Lin
coln White said, "There has in
deed been foreign intervention"
in Jordan—"the intervention of
international Communism."
In the U.S. view, he added, in
ternational Communism means
the "agents" of the Soviet Union.
He said the Soviet Union is the
"fountainhead" of the movement
and "there is no question but who
calls the tune."
Hussein Rejects Charges
At a news conference in Am
man, King Hussein also rejected
the Soviet charges that the Unit
ed States was interfering in Jor
dan's internal affairs.
"This statement has no basis
whatsoever," Hussein said. "Ev
erything that took place in Jor
dan was our own internal affair."
The king also indicated that
Jordan would accept the Ameri
can offer of $10 million in eco
nomic aid provided no strings
were attached.
White said the State Depart
ment understood the aid offer
was accepted yesterday after
noon. Asked whether the money
could be spent for arms, he re
ferred to a previous statement
that it was for economic develop
ment and maintenance of political
stability.
Considerable Latitude
The statement indicated that
Jordan would have considerable
latitude in deciding how to use
the money. Hussein said his gov
ernment would ask the United
States for "whatever arms we
need as long as no conditions are
attached."
The Sixth Fleet made a light
ning dash into the eastern Medi
terranean after the emergency
developed in Jordan. Its ships,
planes, guns and men were
stretched along the Levantine
coast as a precautionary meas
ure.
It appeared, however, that Hus
sein's strong moves to curb left
ist elements which threatened his
regime had been successful.
Asked about reports that Hussein
felt he had passed the crisis,
White said the king was better
able to judge the situation than
the State Department.
The U.S. fleet movement and
aid offer apparently were what
the Soviet foreign ministry and
Moscow newspapers had in mind
in accusing the United States of
"foreign interference."

could be spent for arms, he re
ferred to a previous statement
that it was for economic develop
ment and maintenance of political
stability.
Considerable Latitude
The statement indicated that
Jordan would have considerable
latitude in deciding how to use
the money. Hussein said his gov
ernment would ask the United
States for "whatever arms we
need as long as no conditions are
attached."
The Sixth Fleet made a light
ning dash into the eastern Medi
terranean after the emergency
developed in Jordan. Its ships,
planes, guns and men were
stretched along the Levantine
coast as a precautionary meas
ure.
It appeared, however, that Hus
sein's strong moves to curb left
ist elements which threatened his
regime had been successful.
Asked about reports that Hussein
felt he had passed the crisis,
White said the king was better
able to judge the situation than
the State Department.
The U.S. fleet movement and
aid offer apparently were what
the Soviet foreign ministry and
Moscow newspapers had in mind
in accusing the United States of
"foreign interference."
