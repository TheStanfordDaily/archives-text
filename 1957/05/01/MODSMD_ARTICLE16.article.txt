# Noted Biochemist Pleads for Halt Of H-Bomb Tests
## 
### 
CHICAGO, April 30 (UP) â€”
Famed biochemist Linus Pauling
has predicted that H-bomb tests
planned by the British govern
ment would cause the death of at
least 1,000 persons from leukemia.
Pauling, in a general plea for
the halting of hydrogen weapons
tests last night, also predicted a
continuing of the British tests, set
for Christmas Island in the Pa
cific, would result in the birth of
200,000 feeble-minded children in
the next generation.
Pauling told the Chicago sec
tion of the American Chemical
Society the percentage of children
involved might not be a large one,
"but from a humanitarian stand
point it is a very large number."
The Nobel prize winner, holder
of honorary degrees from 13 uni
versities and the presidential Med
al of Merit for services to the
United States, said he believes hu
manity "could not survive" total
hydrogen war and still remain
human.
Ho fold United Press he "dis
agreed" with the contention that
continuing the H-bomb tests
would stave off war.
"On the contrary, unless we
have world control of hydrogen
weapons, I fear more countries
than just the United States. Rus
sia and Great Britain will get
them," he said.
He asked what could result
from possession by Lgypt of hy
drogen bombs "and what if some
of the other Middle East coun
tries like Israel, Syria or Jordan
had them, too?"
