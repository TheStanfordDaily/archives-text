### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 30
(UP) â€” One thousand U.S. ma
rines came ashore here today on
a 12-hour liberty to "show the
flag" and demonstrate that the
United States could put troops
into crisis - plagued Jordan in a
matter of days.
on the edge of the
Jordanian cauldron, welcomed
the visit as proof that the "United
States is serious and determined"
in opposing Communist penetra
tion of the Near East, and in en
deavoring to roll it back.
"Our Only Hope"
Lebanese Foreign Minister
Charles Malik told the United
Press that "one can only hope
that this determination will per
sist and will bear fruit in the near
future."
The marines were from the
U.S. Sixth Fleet, which made a
lightning dash into the troubled
Middle East when the Jordan
crisis erupted. Vice-Adm. Charles
R. Brown, fleet commander, said
the shore leave order came "from
higher up."
Lebanon is separated from
troubled Jordan by portions of
Syria and Israel. They are only
35 miles apart at the closest
point.
"Flash Order"
Brown said that when he re
ceived a "flash order" to speed to
the Middle East the Sixth Fleet
was scattered at about a dozen
different Mediterranean ports.
Most of the ships, he said, were
in France and Italy with one
tanker in Barcelona.
The commander would not de
tail the reason for the "flash or
der."
"I am a sailor who just takes
orders, and I was told to come
down here and see what was go
ing on," he said.
Then, with a grin, he added:
"Maybe it's fire prevention
week."
