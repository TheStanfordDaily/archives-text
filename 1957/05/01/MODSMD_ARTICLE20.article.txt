# Improving Social Regulations
## 
### 
An IMPROVEMENT has been proposed in the
present women's social regulations and demerit
system.
The changes in the women's rules which
have been presented for consideration are an
improvement because they are a constructive
attempt to iron out an accumulation of com
plaints made by the women students and be
cause they are the result of much time and
energy on the part of Women's Council and
the Social Regulations Committee.
They are further an improvement because
they help to eliminate many of the petty tech
nicalities which exist under the present system.
The new system is simpler, it is more reason
able and it should he more meaningful.
When the present system was set up, it too
had meaning. However, during the past eight
years additions, subtractions, alterations and
interpret#.!ions have turned it into an imprac
tical concept.

The present system, because it tends to an
tagonize many of tlie women under it, lends
itself to misuse and intentional and uninten
tional cheating.
The new system doesn't pretend to be air
tight against cheating. However, due to the
fact that it is simpler, that the penalties are
made to fit the acts and that the sign-out slip
is more directly connected with the Fundamen
tal Standard and the Honor ('ode, it does aim
at being less antagonistic and more practical.
Currently tlie proposed changes are only
under consideration. They are open to sugges
tions. Now is the time lo let Women's Council
or the Social Regulations Committee know if
they have included an objeetional clause or
forgotten an important point.
In a few weeks it will he time lo vote.' That
is the time lo decide whether you really believe
in the new system. It is a good system, hut the
women students must believe in it before it
can truly he upheld.
