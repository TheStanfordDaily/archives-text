Nadir of Campus Pisgraee
Editor, The Daily:
Without a doubt. Sunday evening's riot at
Branner and Roble Halls marks the nadir of cam
pus disgrace. There have been numerous in
stances of childish, immature behavior this year
(such as the desecration of the Post Office build
ing), but none so disgusting as this most recent
occurrence.
The complete disrespect for authority demon
strated by the violent, angry mob is indeed
frightening to contemplate. Now is clearly the
time to curb this attitude of recklessness here at
Stanford—once and for all. Therefore I strongly
suggest the following:
• Swift and sure punishment for all those in
volved, particularly:
The indiscreet Branner resident whose ex
bitionism incited the violence.
The freshman boys who disrupted the
electricity and exploded firecrackers.
• The installation of shutters on the outside
windows of the girls' residences.
• The placement of bars on the upper story
windows of Wilbur Hall (as a safety
measure).
It is indeed unfortunate lhat such measures
are necessary. But, in the final analysis, a uni
versity's mission is higher education—spiritual

as well as mental. Prompt action MUST be taken
to fortify the Fundamental Standard and the
ideals of Christian ethics and morals set forth
therein.
Let's all work together for a better, finer Stan
ford.

Abundant Assorted Residue
Editor, The Daily:
Pursuant to the Stern dining facility, may we
interject that we abhor the food, yet eat. it to
keep something between skin and bone from
gluttonous vacation to vacation. However, we
might add some specific observations on Ihe serv
ice: Besides the abundant assorted residue found
on eating utensils, the shocks of hair (assorted
hues) scrambled in the maize, the bugs crawling
on the salad leaves, we might bring to your at
tention the worm catacombs tunneled in ihc arti
choke, the short nail resting in 1ho apple pic, the
Kleenex in the vanilla pudding and the piece de
resistance, the Band-Aid in the turkey stuffing.
This, of course, does not detract from the qual
ity of our food!
We remain H>y ihe grace of God),
