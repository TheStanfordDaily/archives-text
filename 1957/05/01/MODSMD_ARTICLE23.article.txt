# 12 DEMERITS
## Women Discuss Proposed Social Regulation Changes 
### Anne Johnson 
Women may accumulate 12 demerits before being suspended from
school, under the proposed changes in women's social regulations.
These changes are being discussed in the women's house meetings
this week and next.
Under the new system, one demerit would be given for a late re-

turn of 30 minutes, an accumula
tion of five lockouts which total
30 minutes or less, any guest vio
lation, a male guest in the resi
dence after closing hours and late
leaves in excess of the quota.
After a woman accumulated
nine demerits, she would he
asked to appear before Women's
Council. At 12 demerits the Coun
cil would have the power to rec
ommend suspension based on in
tent to deceive and willful disre
gard of social regulations.
At present a woman may be
suspended after she has received
live demerits. However, she may
often receive only a third of a
demerit, termed an offense, or an
eighth of a demerit, a technical,
for an infraction of the social reg
ulations. This complicated sys
tem would he abolished under the
new plan.
Senior and junior women
would receive unlimited 2:30 a.m.
late leaves under the proposed
system. This is in contrast to
the present, quota which allots
unlimited l:3o's and 20 2:3o's to
seniors and 40 l:3o's and 15 2:3o's
to juniors.
All 2:3o's
The proposed change would
keep the sophomore late leave
limit at 40 but would make them
all 2:3o's instead of the present
-30 I:3o's and 10 2:3o's.
The quota for first - quarter
freshman women would remain
the same at 20 l:3o's and five
2:3o's. Second- and third-quarter
freshman women would be given
29 l:3o's and six 2:3o's instead of
ihe present 24 I:3o's and six
2:3o's.
Under the proposal freshman
women would get four extra 1:30
a.m. late leaves (usable as over
night leaves) to use during
Thanksgiving vacation.
Women's Council is still unde
cided whether or not the 15-min
ute bonus should be discontinued.
Under the present bonus plan, a
woman may be late three times
during the quarter and not re
ceive any demerit points if the
total number of minutes late
doesn't add up to more than 15
minutes.
As this is a complete change of
the women's social regulations,
the plan must be voted on as a
whole, according to Women's
Council. Council members have
requested women to turn in al
ternatives to any parts. Sugges
tions may be taken to the Coun
cil office or to the Associated
Women Students office.
Expected Return
If the plan goes into effect, late
leave slips will carry a line "on
which to put the time of the ex
pected return. This would be op
tional, according to Judy Leh
man. Women's Council chairman.
Guest violations would not be
appealable under the new regula
tions. If an unattended male is
found in a residence after closing
hours, the violation would be in
curred by the woman responsible
for locking up the kev area. If
he is with a woman, *she would
receive the demerit.
The new ruling would permit
women to sign out from the dor
mitory after closing, hours. How
ever. women would not be able to
phone in to sign out after closing
hours.
Penalties for failure to sign out
or extending a late leave to an
overnight after closing hours
would range from one to four de
merits depending on Ihe situa
tion, according to Women's Coun
cil.
