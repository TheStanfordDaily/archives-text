## 
### Leo Krulitz 
"The revolutionary government
of Bolivia considers the universi
ties there an enemy," Professor
Claudio Alvarez-Tostado told the
YWCA Public Affairs Luncheon
Group yesterday.
He went on to describe his ex
periences in Bolivia last year as
an exchange professor for Ihe
State Department.
Professor Alvarez-Tostado said,
"The government there is com
pletely authoritarian; there is no
freedom of any kind.
"The university, as a well-knit
organization, offers opposition to
this kind of government. The
strike is Ihe threat the students
hold over the government."
Five-Week Strike
In the six months he was there,
one major strike al the Univer
sity in La Paz, where he taught,
lasted five weeks. He said, "One
of these strikes stops education
from kindergarten on up."
If a university strikes, he ex :
plained, the secondary and pri
mary students and teachers
strike in sympathy for the uni
versity.
"The University at La Paz is a
14-story, modern structure," he
said, "with a few flaws." He de
scribed one flaw as no water in
the chemistry department, which
is on the ninth floor, because
there isn't enough water pres
sure.
He said, "The students have ac
tivities, but there isn't organized
competition in sports."
Large "Turnover"
He explained the students go
to classes only when they want
and only need to pass the exami
nations to receive credit. He said,
"I started rfty general chemistry
class with 40 students and fin
ished with 40, but only five were
students who had started origi
nally."
The reason for too many uni
versities and not enough funds to
run them properly ho explained
in tTiis way: "Every town has to
have its church, town square and
university. At La Paz only two
graduated the semester i was
there, and that's the largest uni
versity in Bolivia."
Professor Alvarez-Tostado, de
scribing* the resources of the
country, said, "Bolivia has every
thing— oil, gold, lead, excellent
farm land and hydroelectric pow
er potential—but they haven't de
veloped them. As an example, for
three months we didn't have elec
tric power between 6 a.m. and 6
p.m. every day, and you can't buy
a drop of fresh milk anywhere."

thing— oil, gold, lead, excellent
farm land and hydroelectric pow
er potential—but they haven't de
veloped them. As an example, for
three months we didn't have elec
tric power between 6 a.m. and 6
p.m. every day, and you can't buy
a drop of fresh milk anywhere."
"The revolutionary government
of Bolivia considers the universi
ties there an enemy," Professor
Claudio Alvarez-Tostado told the
YWCA Public Affairs Luncheon
Group yesterday.
He went on to describe his ex
periences in Bolivia last year as
an exchange professor for Ihe
State Department.
Professor Alvarez-Tostado said,
"The government there is com
pletely authoritarian; there is no
freedom of any kind.
"The university, as a well-knit
organization, offers opposition to
this kind of government. The
strike is Ihe threat the students
hold over the government."
Five-Week Strike
In the six months he was there,
one major strike al the Univer
sity in La Paz, where he taught,
lasted five weeks. He said, "One
of these strikes stops education
from kindergarten on up."
If a university strikes, he ex :
plained, the secondary and pri
mary students and teachers
strike in sympathy for the uni
versity.
"The University at La Paz is a
14-story, modern structure," he
said, "with a few flaws." He de
scribed one flaw as no water in
the chemistry department, which
is on the ninth floor, because
there isn't enough water pres
sure.
He said, "The students have ac
tivities, but there isn't organized
competition in sports."
Large "Turnover"
He explained the students go
to classes only when they want
and only need to pass the exami
nations to receive credit. He said,
"I started rfty general chemistry
class with 40 students and fin
ished with 40, but only five were
students who had started origi
nally."
The reason for too many uni
versities and not enough funds to
run them properly ho explained
in tTiis way: "Every town has to
have its church, town square and
university. At La Paz only two
graduated the semester i was
there, and that's the largest uni
versity in Bolivia."
Professor Alvarez-Tostado, de
scribing* the resources of the
country, said, "Bolivia has every
thing— oil, gold, lead, excellent
farm land and hydroelectric pow
er potential—but they haven't de
veloped them. As an example, for

tric power between 6 a.m. and 6
