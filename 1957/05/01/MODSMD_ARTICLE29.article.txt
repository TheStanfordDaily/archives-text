# Payne Shuts Out Bronco Nine, 4-0
## Brilliant 3-Hitter Wins for Cards; Olsen, Newkirk Blast Home Runs 
### 
Brilliant three-hit pitching by Walt Payne and two home runs by
Parker Olsen and Joel Newkirk enabled coach Dutch Fehring's In
dian nine to shut out the Santa Clara Broncos 4 0 in a CIBA game
played yesterday afternoon at San Jose Municipal Stadium.
Until the sixth inning it was strictly a pitchers' duel. Payne had

given up a hit in the second and j
another in the fifth. Bronco
pitcher Bob Gaffney had allowed
only one Card hit.
Stanford second baseman All
Shaw finally got to Gaffney in
the sixth inning, however, when
he blasted a two-base hit off the
left center field wall. Outfielder
Rich DeFabio sacrificed Shaw to !
third and the second sacker i
scored on a squeeze bunt by third j
baseman Rudy Figueroa.
Olsen Ihen blasted his home'
run over ihe left field wall 350 I
feet aawy. In Ihe seventh in- 1
ning leadoff bat tor Joel New
kirk duplicated Olsen's feat by
sending another home run over
Ihe same spot in the left field.
Stanford closed out the day's
scoring in the eighth when Figue- |
roa singled and then stole sec
ond. He tallied ori Olsen's single
to center field.
By shutting out the Broncos
the Cards continued their stingy
earned-run pace in CI HA play. In
tin 1 last six conference games
Ihoy have allowed only two
earned runs,
Fehring described Payne' s
pitching against the Broncos as
the best effort in the right-hand
er's career at Stanford. Fehring
pointed out that the three hits off
Payne were all yielded in differ
ent innings and that the one man
he walked came after two were
out in the ninth.
On the hitting side Olsen con
tinued to supply the power in the
Card batting order with his home
run and a single driving in two
of the Indians' four runs. Figue
roa and Newkirk drove in the
other two runs.
The win leveled the Cards' CI
BA record at 6-6. This Saturday
they travel to Berkeley for a
game with the Cal eßars, their
only contenders for the confer
ence's NCAA play-off berth be
cause league leafier USC is ineli
gible.
The Bears are currently in sec
ond place, two games ahead of
Stanford with a 7-3 won-lost rec
ord. However. California has I
three games yet to play with j
Stanford, one with Santa Clara i
and two against powerful USC.
