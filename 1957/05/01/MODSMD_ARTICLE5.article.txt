## 
### 
Men's Council passed recom
mendations on an Honor Code

quiz and three Fundamental
Standard violations last night.
A student who had his physics
test on Thursday asked for some

one who had already had the test.
He implied that he had already
taken the test.
Men's Council, sitting with the

to the dean that the student re

ceived five Corporation Yard
hours.
Four Stanford men were com
ing home from a party with an
(empty) beer keg. Finding them
selves in Palo Alto far from a
washroom, two of them proceed
ed to relieve themselves on some
one's lawn.
The owner of the property then
discharged a .22-caliber pistol on
the ground to scare off the of
fending students. The man did
not press trespassing charges to
the police, but three of the four
men were found guilty of Funda
mental Standard violations and
given five Corporation Yard

night toward solving the problem
of 21 pieces of furniture, worth
more than $800, that have dis
