# Russia Offers Aerial Inspection of Siberia If U.S. Will Open Skies Above West, Alaska
## 
### 
LONDON, April 30 (UP)—Rus
sia offered today to open the skies
over Siberia if the American gov
ernment will permit aerial inspec
tion of the western two-thirds of
the continental United States—
from St. Louis to the Pacific coast
—and all of Alaska.
The United States is believed
almost certain to reject the pro
posal. It would leave cloaked frorh

international inspection teams
western Russia, where major So
viet war plants and military bases
are concentrated.
Deputy Foreign Minister Vale
rian Zorin, just returned from
consultations in Moscow, submit
ted the proposal at today's meet
ing of the five-power UN Disarm
ament Commission. The new 15-
page Soviet disarmament blue
print gave formal but limited ac
ceptance of the "open skies" pro
posal made by President Eisen
hower two years ago.
But, except for the detailed
proposition on open skies, the So
viet plan was similar to that sub
mitted to the subcommission a
year ago by Andrei Gromyko, now
Soviet Foreign Minister.
"Moral" Ban on Weapons
It included demands for an im
mediate end to all nuclear tests
and a "moral" ban on use of nu
clear weapons; reductions of the
conventional armed forces of the
major powers and Communist
China; cutbacks in conventional
military budgets, and liquidation
of military bases in foreign ter
ritories.
U.S. delegate Harold Stassen re
fused to comment on the Soviet
"open skies" proposal until he had
studied the plan.
But Jules Moch, France's dele
gate, was blunt in his denounce
ment.
"They offer to show us the ice
and snow of Siberia," he said. "In
return, the greater part of the
United States would be opened
up."
"Vast Zone"
Zorin proposed to open the skies
to international aerial inspection
over "a vast zone, not only in
Europe but also in the Far East,
including the territory of eastern
Siberia and the maritime terri
tories, Kamchatka and Sakhalin."

In return, the Soviet delegate
called on the Urtited States to
open "Alaska and the west of the
United States with an aggregate
area of 7,063,000 square kilome
ters [2,726,318 square miles]."
Such an area would encompass
all of the United States west of
the Mississippi River. The U.S.
presently maintains nuclear and
guided missile proving grounds in
the southwestern states.
The Soviet open zone would be
slightly larger than that of the
United States. Zorin put it at 7,-
129,000 square kilometers (2,751,-
794 square miles).
