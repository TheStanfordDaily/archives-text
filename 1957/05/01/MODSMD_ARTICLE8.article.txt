# Several Nuclear Blasts in Nevada Planned by AEC
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP)
The Atomic Energy Commis
sion plans to touch off at least
two nuclear explosions this year
from anchored balloons floating
high over the Nevada desert, it
was disclosed today.
These aerial blasts will be
among the nine shots that news
men will be permitted to watch
during the new test series start
ing next month. The others will
be made from steel towers.
The AFJC said the two balloon
shots and one of the tower explo
sions will have a force greater
than 20,000 tons of TNT. They
will be more powerful than the
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima
in August 1915. It was equivalent
to 15,000 tons of TNT.
Although the three larger weap
ons will be city-wreckers by World
War II standards, the AEC said
all the explosions this year "will
be low-yield detonations of fission
devices."
The balloons will be anchored
by cables to control their height j
and keep them from drifting out
of the test area.
