VIDEOT'S DELIGHT
The academic world has made its first tentative steps
into television. A few lectures, a few seminars, but may
I respectfully suggest that the academic world has not
yet learned the full potential of television?
Why don't the colleges use television's vast capacity
to dramatize, to amuse, to unshackle the imagination?
Like, for example, this:
Announcer: Howdy, folks. Well, it's time again for
that lovable, laughable pair, Emmett Twonkey Magruder,
Ph.D., and Felicia May Crimscott, M.A., in that rollick
ing, roistering fun show, American History 101.... And
here they are, the team that took the "hiss" out of
"history"—Emmett Twonkey Magruder and Felicia May
Crimscott! JL
Dr. Mac,ruder: Howdy, folks. A funny thing hap
pened to me on the way to my doctorate. A mendicant
approached me and said, "Excusc me, sir, will you give
me 25 cents for a sandwich?" I replied, "Perhaps I will,
my good man. Let me see the sandwich."
Miss Crimscott: Oh, how droll, Dr. Magruder! How
piquant! How jc ne mis quoi! ... But enough of badi
nage. Let us get on with our rollicking, roistering fun
show, American History 101.
Dr. Magruder: Today we will dramatize the taut and
tingling story of John Smith and Pocahontas. I will play
Captain Smith and Miss Crimscott will play Pocahontas.
Announcer: Rut first a message from our sponsor.
... Folks, have you tried a Philip Morris lately? Have you
treated yourself to that good natural tobacco — zestful
yet mild, hearty yet gentle, rich yet dulcet? Hmmm?
Have you?.. .If not, light a Philip Morris soon. Light
cither end.... And now to our grim and gripping story.
Picture, if you will, a still summer night. An Indian
maid stands by a moonlit brook. Suddenly she hears a
footstep behind her. She turns...
Miss Crimscott: Oh! John Smith! You-um startlc
um me-um!
Dr. Magruder: Hello, Pocahontas. What arc you
doing down by the brook?
Miss Crimscott: Just washing out a few scalps. But
what-um you-um want-um?
Dr. Magruder: I came to see the Chief.
Miss Crimscott: You-um can't-um. Chief is leaving
i'or Chicago.
Dr. Magruder: On what track?
Announcer: And speaking of tracks, stay on the
right track with Philip Morris — the track that heads
straight for .smoking pleasure, for fun, for frolic, for
sweet content.... And now back to those two cool cats,
Twonkey Magruder and Felicia May Crimscott.
Dr. Magruder: Well, folks, that's all for today. See
you next week, same time, same station.
Miss Crimscott: Stay tuned now for "William Cullen
Bryant: Girl Intern."
Announcer: And remember, folks,each end of Philip
Morris is ignitable. It's just good, rich, natural tobacco,
any way you light it!
