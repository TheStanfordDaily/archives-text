# Kirkwood Advocates Increase In Tidelands Oil Royalty Rates
## Senatorial Candidate Says Tidelands Funds Should Be Allocated to Capital Improvements 
### Helen Guerrant 
Robert C. Kirkwood, state controller and candidate for the Republi
can nomination lor U.S. Senator from California, spoke here last
night about the work he has done on the Lands Commission, mak
ing suggestions for future control and use of oil.
Kirkwood criticized the present Shell-Cunningham Act which he

said does not provide for suffi
cient royalties from the tidelands
oil areas. At present the royalty
rale is 12'/•> per cent whereas he
would advocate a return of more
than 16 Vs per cent.
Since the Suez crisis there has
been much pressure upon the
state to develop all resources be
cause of the rise in oil prices. To
do this, he said, a law should be
passed so that the state of Cali
fornia would receive a much
higher royalty rate, though he
did not suggest either a fixed
rate or a fixed sliding scale of
royalties. Kirkwood also pro
posed a change in the law where
by a delay in the leases may be
prevented so that lands may be
opened up more rapidly.
Capital Improvements
Concerning the use of the tide
lands funds, Kirkwood agreed
with Governor Knight that the
money should be used for capital
improvements such as water de
velopment like the Oroville Dam
and Feather River projects. At
present the government is using
this reserve as an addition to tax
funds spent for school support
and old-age pensions. Kirkwood
criticized this depletion of "rainy
day" funds as being unsound.
Kirkwood also made a proposal
for less centralization in the slate
government. He suggested some
reorganization in the government
structure wilh a checks and bal
ance system which would bring
about such a change.
Shift in Functions
Specifically, he recommended
a shift in functions from the Al
coholic Beverage Control to the
Board of Equalization as well as
a change which would provide for
two more independent officers in
the fiscal operations of the gov
ernment. These men, Kirkwood
stated, should be directly respon
sible to the people.
Kirkwood listed his qualifica
tions for the Senate office. He
told of the positions he has held
as state Assemblyman elected
from Santa Clara County in 1946,
present chairman of the Fran
chise Tax Board and member of
the Board of Equalization as well
as his position as state controller
since 1954.

been much pressure upon the
state to develop all resources be
cause of the rise in oil prices. To
do this, he said, a law should be
passed so that the state of Cali
fornia would receive a much
higher royalty rate, though he
did not suggest either a fixed
rate or a fixed sliding scale of
royalties. Kirkwood also pro
posed a change in the law where
by a delay in the leases may be
prevented so that lands may be
opened up more rapidly.
Capital Improvements
Concerning the use of the tide
lands funds, Kirkwood agreed
with Governor Knight that the
money should be used for capital
improvements such as water de
velopment like the Oroville Dam
and Feather River projects. At
present the government is using
this reserve as an addition to tax
funds spent for school support
and old-age pensions. Kirkwood
criticized this depletion of "rainy
day" funds as being unsound.
Kirkwood also made a proposal
for less centralization in the slate
government. He suggested some
reorganization in the government
structure wilh a checks and bal
ance system which would bring
about such a change.
Shift in Functions
Specifically, he recommended
a shift in functions from the Al
coholic Beverage Control to the
Board of Equalization as well as
a change which would provide for
two more independent officers in
the fiscal operations of the gov
ernment. These men, Kirkwood
stated, should be directly respon
sible to the people.
Kirkwood listed his qualifica
tions for the Senate office. He
told of the positions he has held
as state Assemblyman elected
from Santa Clara County in 1946,
present chairman of the Fran
chise Tax Board and member of
the Board of Equalization as well
as his position as state controller
since 1954.

night about the work he has done on the Lands Commission, mak
ing suggestions for future control and use of oil.
Kirkwood criticized the present Shell-Cunningham Act which he

said does not provide for suffi

oil areas. At present the royalty
rale is 12'/•> per cent whereas he
would advocate a return of more
than 16 Vs per cent.
Since the Suez crisis there has
been much pressure upon the
state to develop all resources be
cause of the rise in oil prices. To
