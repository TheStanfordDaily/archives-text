NEW YORK, May 1 (UP) â€”
Atomic Energy Commissioner
Thomas E. Murray said today the
"umbrella" of the H-bomb has pro
tected the free world from sudden
destruction.
But, he added, the United States
must turn to smaller nuclear
weapons "if we are to avoid the
risk of slow defeat."
Writing in the May (i issue of
Life magazine, Murray said the
multi-megaton H-bomb would be a
weapon of "terrible 'efficiency'"
in an all-out war. He said, how
ever, it would not be effective in
halting "creeping Communist
domination" and minor aggres
sions, such as Russian repression
of t he Hungarian revolt.
For that reason, he said, there
was an urgent demand for "a new
policy of emphasis on small nu
clear weapons."
Murray said the "Sovirt leaders
are capable of primitive logic"
and realize that any nuclear "war
of survival" would result in the
survival of no one.
"The Communist revolution
clearly wishes to put an end lo
the history of imperialist-reaction
ary-bourgeois capitalism," ho said.
"But it does not wish to put an
end to all history and therefore
to the Communist revolution it
self."
