## New Amendment Provides Needed Aid for Publications 
### Stan Gross, Associate Editor 
ASSU Legislature last night approved an amended amendment to
Publications Board Standing Rules to the effect that each member
publication will give money to a special improvement fund set up by
Publications Board.
Each member is to give 25 per cent of its improvement and build-

ing fund to the Publications
Board improvement fund. That
fund will be used to help publica
tions which are not solvent, or
new or special publications, to
meet their obligations. The grant
ing of the funds would have to be
approved by Legislature and Pub
lications Board.

Row representative, said the mat
ter is very confusing at present.

have the elections, women's busi
ness seems to be confusing."
