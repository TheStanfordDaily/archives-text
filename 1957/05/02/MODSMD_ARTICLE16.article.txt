# Critics Level Sharpest Attack on Ike's Budget, Term It 'Irresponsible'
## President Gives No Indication of Cutting; May Appeal to Public 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 1 (UP)—Congressional critics today leveled
their sharpest attack yet on President Eisenhower's budget. But the
President showed no signs of backing down and indicated he would
carry the fight to the public.
Veteran Democratic Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia set the

tenor for the new assault by
branding tHe budget"the most ir
responsible" in 25 years. He also
called for replacement of Budget
Chief Percival F. Brundage by "a
man dedicated to cutting the
budget."
The suggestion got a cold re
ception at the White House. Press
Secretary James C. Hagerty,
asked if Eisenhower was "per
fectly happy" with Brundage, re
plied "Sure." He said brusquely
that Brundage still "is budget di
rector as far as I know." Brun
dage had no comment.
Considers Speech
The White House said earlier
that the chief executive was con
sidering a nationwide radio-tele
vision speech to win public back
ing in his fight to head off what
he considers dangerous budget
cuts, particularly in his embat
tled foreign aid program.
Eisenhower followed up this
disclosure by telling a group of
women visitors that his $4,400,-
000,000 aid program—chief target
of the Congressional economizers
—was a "vital engine" needed to
keep the ship of state on a
"steady course" toward world
peace.
Byrd, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee and a leader
in the budget-cutting drive, criti
cized Brundage in a speech to the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He
said the budget is "unduly and
unnecessarily wasteful and Brun
dage prepared it."
"Very Helpful"
He added that it would be "very
helpful" if the President next
year had a new budget chief
pledged to "economy instead of
finding new ways to spend mon
ey." Byrd also proposed an $8
billion spending cut coupled with
a $6 billion tax slash as soon as
possible.
Meanwhile, Senate Democratic
Leader Lyndon B. ohnson (Tex.)
touched off a flurry of Senate de
bate by accusing the administra
tion of "talking out of both sides
of its mouth" on the budget issue.
Johnson said the President first
indicated sympathy with aides fa
voring a smaller budget but later
concluded that "big cuts could not
be found." Now, he said, admin
istration leaders are asking the
Senate to restore House cuts.
"Meat-ax" Cuts
Senator Leverett Saltonstall
(R-Mass.) promptly warned
against "meat-ax" budget cuts.
But he noted that the President
had suggested budget savings of
$1,800,000,000 and said he thought
the cuts might safely run as deep
as $2,500,000,000 to $3,000,000,000.
Senator John Sherman Cooper
(R-Ky.) said he was not referring
to Johnson's statement but that
the budget issue was "being used
to attack the aims of the Eisen
hower administration." He said
the President took office with the
aim of balancing the budget and
had done so.
In a related development, At
torney General Herbert Brownell
Jr. urged the Senate to restore
$2,500,000 which the House cut
from his department's $234,665,-
000 budget. He said it cost the
taxpayers less to operate the de
partment now than it did five
years ago.

000 budget. He said it cost the
taxpayers less to operate the de

years ago.
WASHINGTON, May 1 (UP)—Congressional critics today leveled
their sharpest attack yet on President Eisenhower's budget. But the
President showed no signs of backing down and indicated he would
carry the fight to the public.
Veteran Democratic Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia set the

tenor for the new assault by
branding tHe budget"the most ir
responsible" in 25 years. He also
called for replacement of Budget
Chief Percival F. Brundage by "a
man dedicated to cutting the
budget."
The suggestion got a cold re
ception at the White House. Press
Secretary James C. Hagerty,
asked if Eisenhower was "per
fectly happy" with Brundage, re
plied "Sure." He said brusquely
that Brundage still "is budget di
rector as far as I know." Brun
dage had no comment.
Considers Speech
The White House said earlier
that the chief executive was con
sidering a nationwide radio-tele
vision speech to win public back
ing in his fight to head off what
he considers dangerous budget
cuts, particularly in his embat
tled foreign aid program.
Eisenhower followed up this
disclosure by telling a group of
women visitors that his $4,400,-
000,000 aid program—chief target
of the Congressional economizers
—was a "vital engine" needed to
keep the ship of state on a
"steady course" toward world
peace.
Byrd, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee and a leader
in the budget-cutting drive, criti
cized Brundage in a speech to the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He
said the budget is "unduly and
unnecessarily wasteful and Brun
dage prepared it."
"Very Helpful"
He added that it would be "very
helpful" if the President next
year had a new budget chief
pledged to "economy instead of
finding new ways to spend mon
ey." Byrd also proposed an $8
billion spending cut coupled with
a $6 billion tax slash as soon as
possible.
Meanwhile, Senate Democratic
Leader Lyndon B. ohnson (Tex.)
touched off a flurry of Senate de
bate by accusing the administra
tion of "talking out of both sides
of its mouth" on the budget issue.
Johnson said the President first
indicated sympathy with aides fa
voring a smaller budget but later
concluded that "big cuts could not
be found." Now, he said, admin
istration leaders are asking the
Senate to restore House cuts.
"Meat-ax" Cuts
Senator Leverett Saltonstall
(R-Mass.) promptly warned
against "meat-ax" budget cuts.
But he noted that the President
had suggested budget savings of
$1,800,000,000 and said he thought
the cuts might safely run as deep
as $2,500,000,000 to $3,000,000,000.
Senator John Sherman Cooper
(R-Ky.) said he was not referring
to Johnson's statement but that
the budget issue was "being used
to attack the aims of the Eisen
hower administration." He said
the President took office with the
aim of balancing the budget and
had done so.
In a related development, At
torney General Herbert Brownell
Jr. urged the Senate to restore
$2,500,000 which the House cut
from his department's $234,665,-
000 budget. He said it cost the
taxpayers less to operate the de
partment now than it did five
years ago.
