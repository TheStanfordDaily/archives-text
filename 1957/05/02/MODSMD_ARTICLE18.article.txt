Zhukov was the principal speak

blamed the United States for cur

"Imperialist circles, headed by
the U.S.A. . . . are doing every
thing to isolate the Arab coun
tries from each other and to break
their will in their struggle for in
dependence," Zhukov said.
"The decision of the U.S. gov

on the territories of other coun
tries and its refusal to accept our
proposals for the prohibition of
the [nuclear] tests and the liqui
dation of atomic weapons bring
nearer the danger of atomic war."

No Pictures
Although the only new item on
display was a lightly-armored ar
tillery tractor, foreign photogra
phers were forbidden for the first
time in years to take pictures of
the parade.
A Soviet plainclothesman confis
cated pictures taken by two West
ern newsmen—Whitman Bassow
of United Press and Dan Schoor
of the Columbia Broadcasting Sys
tem. Foreign tourists, however,
were allowed to snap at will.
Marching with Russia's mobile
weapons were thousands of para
troopers and artillerymen. There
also were non-uniformed groups
—glider pilots, athletes and work
ers, all carrying banners and tro
phies.
Blames U.S.
Zhukov was the principal speak
er at the May Day ceremony. He
blamed the United States for cur
rent troubles in the Middle East
and elsewhere in the world.
"Imperialist circles, headed by
the U.S.A. . . . are doing every
thing to isolate the Arab coun
tries from each other and to break
their will in their struggle for in
dependence," Zhukov said.
"The decision of the U.S. gov
ernment to station atomic units
on the territories of other coun
tries and its refusal to accept our
proposals for the prohibition of
the [nuclear] tests and the liqui
dation of atomic weapons bring
nearer the danger of atomic war."
