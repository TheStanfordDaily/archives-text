# Political Union Revamping
## 
### 
Fot R Yt.ARR A<»o the Political Union, through
the efl'orls of students, faculty and administra
tion. was established on the Stanford campus.
Today the Political Union is hovering near ex
tinction. To allow such an organization to
disintegrate represents defeat and disgrace lo
a progressive university.
Students and administration alike are pro
gressive in working together to raise academic
standards, improve housing facilities and create
an atmosphere of a relaxed hut extensive edu
cational institution, it is time students and
administration alike become progressive in the
specialized sphere of political education and
activity.
Since its inception the Political Union lias
faced several types of problems —internal or
ganization, availability of speakers, participa
tion, administrative approval. Organization
allv, the Itepuhlicari, Democratic and Inde
pendent caucuses stand in danger of becoming
tools of national political organizations.
Il is understandable that tlie administration
does not choose lo see Stanford become the
scene of violent partisan politics, directed by
national powers outside the University. To
avoid this the Political Union will have lo find
a way to include partisan politics on a local,
internal basis only.
A-> agreed between the University and the
students when the Political Union was formed,
it is to be always an educational activity. Get
ting speakers to the University is difficult be
cause of regional isolation 112 rom active political
areas. Political Union must find a way to get
high-caliber speakers to the campus in order
to justify its existence and to attract the interest
of the students.
Participation in the Union has varied—soar
ing in election years, ebbing in between elec
tions. The Union must present a program of
student participation which will appeal to a
wider group of students.
Lite administration has retained the right
to approve or disapprove individuals suggested
as speakers under the auspices of the Political
Union. Unless it changes its policy, this prob
lem alone can terminate the useful life of the
Political Union. University disapproval of na

tional partisan politics operating on tlx* campus
is reasonable. Hut, using the political prohibi
tion clause in Mrs. Stanford's founding grant
lor its reason, tin* administration lias refused
l<» allow controversial figures 1 o speak on the
campus.
The administration is approving the presence
of lesser politicians while disapproving the
presence of figures of more renown or repute.
For a progressive university to adhere to a pos
sibly mediocre hut snrelv safe type of political
education over a probably excellent hut pos
sibly controversial type of political education
exhibits inconsistency and fearful timidity.
At present there are numerous proposals and
counter-proposals for the reorganization of the
I'nlitical Union being discussed bv, students
ami the administralion. If lhe\ are to succeed,
the aim of tiie reorganized Political Union
must be political education by partisan partici
pation on a purely campus level combined with
political education through a well-organized
program for national partisan political speak
ers, regardless of their notorietv or repute.
Anything short of this aim is evading a neces
sary area of student education.
I low is this aim to be realized? Unfortu
nately, several of the revamping proposals have
come I com students outside the I'olitical I Jnion.
Only students who have had experience with
the group can appreciate its needs and activate
its purposes. I'olitical Union members and
officers must present a proposal worthy of tin*
original purposes of the I nion.
Furthermore, the administration would be
wise to review its policy and actions concern
ing the Political I nion. 11, 100, has had expe
rience with the organization. It cannot expect
the Union to maintain a purely educational
standard while at the same time il is rejecting
what is perhaps the Union's best means of
accomplishing that education.
These are the problems. For the good of the
University—its reputation as a thorough insti
tution of education and its intellectual honesty
in learning—the Political Union and the ad
ministration would both do well to reconsider
their aims and to revitalize tin' Union on a
practical, stimulating, honest basis.
