# Bargaining for Lives
## 
### 
Russia's df.lf.gate to the five-power United
Nations Disarmament Commission in London
has presented an "open skies" proposal for
aerial inspection of Siberia in return for aerial
inspection of Alaska and the United States
west of the Mississippi.
At the same time, one of America's most
famous biochemists, Dr. Linns Pauling, pre
dicted the death by leukemia of at least 1000
persons as a result of the H-bomb tests planned
by the British government on Christmas Island
in the Pacific.
Russia's proposal is but one of a series of
proposals and counter-proposals submitted to
I lie Disarmament Commission by first one
power and then another. It may not be the
best proposal. In fact, it is probably a bad one.
II is not for us, the uninformed, to judge its
merits.
lint it has one feature that calls for special
study. The area of Russia opened to UN aerial
inspection would be that very area in which
Moscow conducts most, if not all, of its nuclear
tests.
Pauling's statement is one that the United
States cannot afford to ignore. This is not just
fanciful theorizing. This is certain knowledge
from a highly respected scientist who knows,
better than any politician could ever know,
the danger from radiation.
We Americans have a deep-seated distrust

of any, and indeed all, proposals submitted by
Russia. And we have, a right to distrust them,
lor we have been burned too often by taking
their word in good faith.
Rut if, iu fact, there is a good chance to
decrease, il not halt entirely, nuclear tests
throughout the world, then let us be careful
in our consideration of this proposal before
we answer it.
As long as the world powers, including the
United States, continue to strive, via arms and
nuclear weapons build-ups, for that little bit
of extra bargaining power, then all efforts
toward preventing war are doomed to failure
as they always have been in the past. It is a
vicious cycle, unfortunately.
If. as Pauling says, we are to remain human,
we cannot afford to undergo a "hydrogen" war.
We admit that the thought of acquiring leu
kemia through radiation frightens us. Death
by leukemia is not a pleasant one.
We applaud America's disarmament ambas
sador Harold Stassen's decision to study llie
plan thorough Iv before commenting on it.
However unfair the proposal may have seemed
on the surface and there is no doubt that the
plan is unfair in many respects —it was very
unwise for the I rench delegate, Jules Modi,
to denounce it so abruptly.
Let those who sit around the conference
table remember they are bargaining for our
lives—not for nationalistic honor.

has presented an "open skies" proposal for
aerial inspection of Siberia in return for aerial
inspection of Alaska and the United States
west of the Mississippi.
At the same time, one of America's most
famous biochemists, Dr. Linns Pauling, pre
dicted the death by leukemia of at least 1000
persons as a result of the H-bomb tests planned
by the British government on Christmas Island
in the Pacific.
Russia's proposal is but one of a series of
proposals and counter-proposals submitted to
I lie Disarmament Commission by first one
power and then another. It may not be the
best proposal. In fact, it is probably a bad one.
II is not for us, the uninformed, to judge its
merits.
lint it has one feature that calls for special
study. The area of Russia opened to UN aerial
inspection would be that very area in which
Moscow conducts most, if not all, of its nuclear
tests.
Pauling's statement is one that the United
States cannot afford to ignore. This is not just
fanciful theorizing. This is certain knowledge
from a highly respected scientist who knows,
better than any politician could ever know,
the danger from radiation.
We Americans have a deep-seated distrust

of any, and indeed all, proposals submitted by
Russia. And we have, a right to distrust them,
lor we have been burned too often by taking
their word in good faith.
Rut if, iu fact, there is a good chance to
decrease, il not halt entirely, nuclear tests
throughout the world, then let us be careful
in our consideration of this proposal before
we answer it.
As long as the world powers, including the
United States, continue to strive, via arms and
nuclear weapons build-ups, for that little bit
of extra bargaining power, then all efforts
toward preventing war are doomed to failure
as they always have been in the past. It is a
vicious cycle, unfortunately.
If. as Pauling says, we are to remain human,
we cannot afford to undergo a "hydrogen" war.
We admit that the thought of acquiring leu
kemia through radiation frightens us. Death
by leukemia is not a pleasant one.
We applaud America's disarmament ambas
sador Harold Stassen's decision to study llie
plan thorough Iv before commenting on it.
However unfair the proposal may have seemed
on the surface and there is no doubt that the
plan is unfair in many respects —it was very
unwise for the I rench delegate, Jules Modi,
to denounce it so abruptly.
Let those who sit around the conference
table remember they are bargaining for our
lives—not for nationalistic honor.
