the Same Joker
Editor, The Daily:
In the past I have refrained from writing let
ters to the editor because of a somewhat apa
thetic view toward most of the letters discussed.
However, an article written by one "Dick Lewis"
and published in this section on May 1, 1957, has
particularly touched me. This interest is a result
of: (1) having used the same name as this other
joker for many years, and (2) having a strong
disagreement with the view expressed.
May I first identify myself as Dick Lewis, alias
Richard A. Lewis, alias Louie Erown, alias Mr.
Bev Brown, etc.
Now as far as the points of issue, I would like
to go on record as not disapproving of the "riot
ous action" of last weekend. In fact, I felt quite
sorry to have missed the affair. The "riot"

clearly illustrated Iho inappropriate use of terms
such as "cautious," "dormant" and "apathetic"
in describing the student body as a group. It
apparently was one of ihe best attended student
functions of the year. The opportunity in this
University for students to use anything other
than their eyes and ears is sufficiently limited
to require ihem to improvise other more strenu
ous activities.
In any case, the incident as reported resulted
in no damage of any consequence, and, I would
assume, gave considerable enjoyment If) ihe par
ticipants.
In regard to the suggested remedies as a cure
all to curb "recklessness," I feel no comment
is necessary.
So, "let us all work together for a better, finer
Stanford," by having more ol such successful
student activities.
