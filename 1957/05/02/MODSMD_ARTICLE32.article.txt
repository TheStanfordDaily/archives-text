# The 						Finish Line

### Dirk Barnes 
That hectic time of the track season is here again the weekend
when Stanford meets California in the Big Meet. The Indians and
Bears might have great teams, they might have bad teams, but no
matter what the year's past scores have been, form jumps out the
window the day of the Big Meet.
Saturday, (here won't be much to choose between Brutus Ham
ilton's Hears and Payton Jordan's Indians. Both squads have some
outstanding performers, but also have weaknesses which have cost
tlieni meets at the hands of I'SC ami U< LA.
These strengths and weaknesses of the two schools mesh togeth
er in a way so as to give Stanford the field event edge and Cal the
pre-meet nod in the running events.
Bob Rubin, the ASUC sports publicity director, has drawn up an
interesting set of dope sheets for Saturday's battle in Berkeley.
Rubin's first is, in his words, "opium scented in Stanford's favor."
The opium really reeks, too, as Rubin gives Stanford every break
and a total of 98 points to just 33 for the Bears.
This flight of the imagination finds the Indians winning 11 of
15 events, and taking at least the first two places in nine of them.
The only Cal men who could win amidst the opium smoke are
Don Bowden and Leuinon King, middle-distance and sprint special
ists respectively.
Just so Cal fans won't Ihink he's prejudiced for the Cards, Rubin
also dreamed up a prognostication which is "opium scented in Cali
fornia's favor." Here, the Bears come up with every conceivable
break to roll up 91 points to the Tribe's 40.
Cal is given the nod in 10 events, and is seen as going 1-2 in six
of them. Hurdler Chuck Cobb and field men Hank Roldan, Fred
Peters and Frank Herrmann are the only Stanford winners, although
Mike Franchetti is given a tie in the pole vault.
Ituhin, of course, made up the lopsided dope-sheets for amuse
ment purposes only—at least that's what the man says. For the
more objective fans, he concocted a tentative list of results which
puts Stanford on top by the more modest score of 70-61. This is
about in line with what all the alleged experts are predicting as
the final score.
In this dope-sheet of Rubin's, Stanford wins in nine events, Cal
taking the remaining six. Indian winners listed are Don Chesarek,
440; Cobb, highs and lows; Roldan, javelin; Fehlen, high jump; Herr
mann, broad jump; Peters, discus; Franchetti, pole vault; and the
mile relay team.
From here, it looks as though Franchetti and Chesarek are the
two who are most likely lo be upset, although each has the. best
mark of any of the entrants in his particular event.
Stanford's best chances to upset Itubin's California winners will
he in the shot put and two-mile, where he has selected Paul Magis
tretti and Bob House.
Magistretti has a best mark in the shot of 52-7%. This is better
than the Tribes' Ray Williamson or Chris Plain have done in any
meet this season, but the two Indians are not far behind. Plain in
particular has looked sharp in practice this week.
The meet's best tactical race will probably be the two-mile run,
with House and Stanford's Maury Graves matching strides and wits.
House must be given the favorite's role on the basis of his recent
9:03.9, but Craves cannot he discounted.
As it looks now, House will be running the one-mile in addition
to the longer race, while Graves- will sit out the four-lapper. Thus,
the Indians' star will have the benefit of being more rested for the
long grind.
Against Occidental, Craves ran a Iremendous tactical race, hold
ing off Oxy's John Kerr for seven and one-half laps, lost the lead
briefly, but then put on a long kick to whip his rival by If) yards
in the time of 9:14.7.
Willi Graves and House expected to lie fighting each other all
the way, there is a better-thanfair possibility thai the winner will
have lo run under nine minutes. In any case, the winner will as
■ iime the role of chief challenger against USC's little machine, Max
Truex, in the May IS PCC championships.
The varsity battle isn't going to be the only close point fight
Saturday. In a meet running alternately with the main attraction,
the Stanford frosli will be tangling with the California freslnnen.
Frosh field events are slated to begin ;it 12:20- one hour and ten
minutes before varsity field men swing into action. The first frosh
running event, the mile, will be off at 1:50. From then on, frosh
and varsity races will alternate with the exception of the two-mile,
where runners from all four teams will run in the same race.
Top races in the frosh meet appear to be the 880 ami the mile
relay. Cal boasts 1950 California prep champ Jerry Siebert in the
two-lapper. Siebert ran 1:53.8 in high school, second-fastest clock
ing for a prepvter in U.S. history. Stanford will counter with
Dick Lassen (1:55.4) and John Patterson (1:56,0).
The relay will feature Stanford's record-breaking 3:18.8 team
against a California quartet which has run 3:20.8. Frosh coach
Floyd Strain will probably send Chuck McKenney, Norm Pease, Las
sen and Bob Besse out for a Papoose victory.
