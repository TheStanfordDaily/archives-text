# Bears' Olympic Stars Bowden, King to Face Indians Saturday
## 
### 
When Stanford and California
tangle in the 62d annual Big Meet
Saturday at Berkeley, the Indian
spikers will be facing two of the
best runners in the world in the
persons of Leamon King and Don
Bowden.
King has been slowly rounding
into shape this year, hoping to
hit his peak during the ehampion
ship and invitational meets of
May and June. He is expected to
give Abilene Christian's Bobby
Morrow a tremendous battle for
the title of world's fastest human.
The feeling of many experts is
that King ran the fastest any per
son has ever run when he sped
his third leg of the 400-meter relay
in the Olympics. He was unoffi
cially timed in 9.2 for his lO
meter (110-yard) leg.
King's best times this season
are only 9.7 and 21.5, but he ap
pears ready to break down into
the lower time range. His best
clockings last season were world
record-equaling 9.3 in the 100 and
a wind-aided 20.6 in the 220.
Bowden is the choice of many
to become the first American to
run the mile in four minutes or

under. Bowden, like King, ran in
the Olympics. He was hampered
by a month-long illness, however,
and failed to reach the 1500-meter
finals.
This year the Berkeley junior
has concentrated on the half mile
and has recorded a top time of
1:19.7. The feeling is that Bowden
could have run in the 1:48 range
against USC last weekend had he
not eased up in the last 100 yards
when he had cinched the race.
