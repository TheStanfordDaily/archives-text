Look for Third
Stanford will ho gunning for
its third consecutive win over the
Bear oarsmen. Two years ago,
the Tribe rowed to a 2V£-length
victory, and increased Iheir mar
gin to V/> lengths last year. The |
two victories were the first for
Stanford since 1917 in the annual
Cal Stanford regatta. The Indians
have also topped Cal in the past
two IRA regattas in Syracuse,
New York.
Both squads have yet to taste
defeat this season. Coach Lou
Lindsey's Stanford team has
coasted to victories over South
ern California and Oregon State j
in earlier races this year, while j
Cal has bea'ten USC twice and I
UCLA once.
To Face Huskies
The winner of the Big Race j
will have the honor of battling it
out with Washington for the un- I
official Pacific Coast Champion
ship. Stanford will meet the Hus
kies May 25 at Redwood City,
while Cal faccs the perennial
West Coast power May 18 in Se- j
attle.
The Indian freshmen will be
out to revenge the loss the class
of '59 suffered at the hands of the
Bearcubs last year. Frosh men
tor Phil Waters has his boats set
to go against, the Cal yearlings
now, and looks for a victory.


HOPES TO REPEAT —Parker Olsen, Stanford's slugging sopho
more lelt-fielder, will be banked upon to help the Tribe's batting
at lack when t hey meet California Saturday. Last time the two
teams met, Olsen blasted a home run to touch off a five-run fourth
inning as the Indians won, 10-1.
