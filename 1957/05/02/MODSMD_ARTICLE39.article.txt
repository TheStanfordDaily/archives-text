## 
### 
Sprained thumbs and stormy
weather tailed to stop Stanford's
spirited tennis players yesterday
as they sallied out and outslugged
San Jose Slate, 6-3.
With No. 1 and No. 2 men Jack
Douglas and Brooks Rawlins
nursing sprained thumbs and the
clouds threatening to burst at any
minute, the Indians nevertheless
scored their second win of the
year over the Spartan net men.
Both Douglas, who is also out
for spring football, and Rawlins
will play in the "Big Match" here
Saturday with California.
In yesterday's varsity courts
action, Dave Nelson, Gil White
and Bob Bowden, playing one,
two, three, ripped off easy
straight set wins.
Though needing three sots to
pull it out, fourth singles man A 1
Galalway also came through, as
did doubles teams Lowell Car
ruth-White and Dick Gould-Bow
den.
Suffering losses were No. 5
man Gould, No. 6 man Craig Ely
and third doubles duo Ely-Galla
way. SJS's ace singles player
Warren Half hill was not able to
play for the Spartans.
Coach Bob Renker expressed
the fear that Douglas and Raw
lins might be under par for the
Cal match due to lack of prac
tice.
