# SU Women Decide No Housing Policy Change This Year
## 
### 
No change will be made this
year in the women's housing ra
tio policy.
In a vote which was taken last
Monday night in house meeting
the women students voted 651 to
let the present system run as is
and to watch developments. Five
hundred twelve votes wore cast
to make Lagunita an all-sopho
more dorm, and 209 for the pro
posed ratio change.
Voting Results
The result of the voting and
the information gathered by the
AWS Housing Committee con
cerning the workings of the pres
ent policy will be compiled and
sent to the administration in the
form of a recommendation of pol
iey.
Virginia Uhler, AWS president,
said that since the ratio will re
main the same, it will be up to
the freshman women who have
indicated that they would like to
live in Lagunita to draw for that
dorm.
In Discussion
AWS Housing Committee dis
cussion brought out that if Lagu
nita he made an all-sophomore
dormitory there would be no mix
ture of classes, sponsor choosing
would be limited as upper divi
sion women would not know
sophomores, and women other
than sophomores who want sin
gle rooms would have to live in
Moore or Union.
