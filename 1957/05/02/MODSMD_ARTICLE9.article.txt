WASHINGTON, May 1 (UP)
— Senate Democratic Leader
Lyndon B. Johnson (Tex.) com- „
plained today that cabinet
members rent new Cadillacs
from General Motors Corpora
tion at $500 a year while Con
gressional limousines are trad
ed in for new ones at a higher
annual cost.
Deploring the lack of Con
gressional "influence" wit h
General Motors, Johnson com
mented that Congress could "ef
fect a substantial saving" if it
could make a similar deal.
Senator Styles Bridges (R-
N.H.) agreed that he'd "like to
get in on that down here."
