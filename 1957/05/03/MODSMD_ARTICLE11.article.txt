# Cards Hope for Repeat Victory Over Bear Nine
## 
### 
With star hurler Bob Leopold
on the mound, Stanford's soaring
baseball team will battle Califor
nia at Berkeley tomorrow, hop
ing to take a giant stride toward
the NCAA play-offs.
Game time is 3:30 p.m. on Ed
wards Field.
Leopold has yet to give up an
earned run in three complete
games, one of which was against
this same Cal team.
The two teams are the only
contenders for the right to repre
sent the CIBA in the NCAA tour
ney because league - leading
Southern California is ineligible.
Cal's diamondmen are now in
second place, two games ahead
of Stanford with a 7-3 won-lost
record. The Indians stand even
at 6-6. However, California has
three games yet to play with
Stanford, one with Santa Clara
and two against powerful USC.
In First Game
And in the Bears' first game
against the Indians, two weeks
ago, they fell to Leopold, 10-1.
Tomorrow Leopold will be facing
the same pitcher he soundly
whipped last timeâ€”Cal ace Doug
Weiss, who boasts a 7-3 won-lost
record.
However, if Weiss shows the
fireballing form he used in quell-

KZSU, 880 on the dial, will
broadcast tomorrow's baseball
game.

ing Santa Clara last week, 4-1, he
will be giving Leopold the duel
of his life.
And since their cataclysmic loss
to the Stanfords, Cal has picked
up its hitting. Twenty-five run
ners have stormed across the
plate for the Bears in the last
three games.
The Berkeleyites boast four
hitters in the CIBA's top 11 bai
ters, with second baseman and
lead-off hitter Roger Gregg pac
ing the pack with a blazing .439/
He is followed among Cal bats
men by centerfielder Rernie Kel
ly (.394), catcher Charley
Thompson (.333) and third sack
er Ron Gaggero (.3171.
Bolstering such slugging ef
forts has been the recent return
to form of first baseman Warren
Lavorel. Lavorel was the Cal big
home-run gun last year but this
year has hit a midseason slump.
The big lefty snapped out of it
in the Santa Clara tilt, winning
the game with a ninth-inning
double.
The Bear lineup has been fur
ther strengthened by the inser
tion of slick-fielding and hard-hit
ting Earl Robinson at shortstop.
Robinson, also a basketball star,
was the Boars' top batter last
spring.
Hilling Corps
In the Stanford hitting corps,
shortstop Steve Stewart is slap
ping the spheroid to the tune of
a solid .344 figure, good for sev
enth in the CIBA.
A 1 Shaw, the Indians' hard-hit
ting second sacker, is in 11th
place with a mark of .308.
Shaw and left fielder Parker
Olsen hit for the distance against
the Bears last time and Olsen,
third baseman Rudy Figueroa
and Joel Newkirk each got two
hits.
JV's Frosli
Cal's junior varsity will host
Ihe Stanford Braves at 10 a.m. to
morrow on Edwards Field, while
the powerful Cal frosh, boasting
a 12-1 record, will meet the In
dian yearlings at 10 a.m. at Bush
rod Park in Oakland.
The Papooses have compiled an
8-1 record thus far. Dick Williams
will start on the mound for Coach
Dick Clegg's crew. Williams, im
itating his varsity brother Leo
pold, has hurled 22 innings with
out allowing an earned run
The master 112 rosh pitcher
warmed up for his task with four
innings of one - hit baseball on
Wednesday as the frosh were
whipping Jefferson High School,
4-1.
