# Berlin Protocol Officer Klein Talks on German Problems
## Dr. Klein Expresses Confidence of Eventual Reunification, Continued Harmony With West 
### 
Dr. Walter Klein, Chief Protocol Officer of Foreign Relations for
the governing mayor of Berlin, spoke on "German Reunification"
yesterday afternoon as part of the lIR Consul Talks program. Dr.
Klein is visiting the U.S. by special invitation of the State Depart
ment.
Dr. Klein told an interested audience that the German people were

confident of eventual reunifica
tion; he was certain that at least
90 per cent of the people in East
ern Germany would vote against
continuance of the satellite gov
ernment set up by the Soviet.
The majority of the German
population has understood that
rearmament is necessary to pro
mote reunification, Dr. Klein
went on to say. At the end of
this year, Germany will have an
army of 120,000 men.
Pointing out flaws in the "Rus
sian thesis," Dr. Klein empha
sized that East Berlin youth, ma
ture and interested in political af
fairs, remain unconvinced that
Russia is as strong as she would
like the world to believe she is.
"Berlin would like to be the
49th star in the American flag,"
smiled Dr. Klein. "The more the
German people are willing to go
along with the West without con
cessions, the more the Russians
will be impressed."
