# Ike's Vacations
## 
### 
President Eisenhower hit hard at his critics
a couple of days ago, coming out strongly for
the foreign aid items in his budget and at
tacking the isolationism of many of his critics.
We applaud the fact that the President
seemed to he taking the offensive. But amidst
all this controversy we noticed another fact—
the President was well rested for taking his
offensive, having just returned from a 13-day
vacation in Augusta, Georgia.
Ever since his inauguration Mr. Eisenhower
seems to have spent the majority of his time
at vacation spots, going to vacation spots or
coming back from them.
We, like anybody else, think the President
must preserve his health or he will be 110 good
1o the country at all. But when more than
one third of his time is spent 011 golfing or
ocean cruises, then it presents some cause for
concern.
During his election campaign President Eis
enhower quite frankly admitted to the Ameri
can people that his health was not as good as
it formerly had been. He said lie would have
to take it easy during his next four years, but
that if be watched himself, his doctors had told
him, he was physically capable of carrying on
the duties of the presidency.

On his very inauguration day the President
caught a cold watching the parade, and it look
Augusta to shake it. We count
five weeks of vacation since the beginning of
his second term. Even considering the over
burdening duties demanded of the President
of the United States, it seems to us that to
claim 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as the Presi
dent's home address is getting to be somewhat
of a farce.
ith John Foster Dulles continuing his globe
hopping, this leaves a decided absence of
leadership in Washington. It is true that under
modern communication methods Ike can keep
in close touch with his advisers no matter where
he is, hut the spectacle of a lack of «a strong
hand in Washington does immeasurable harm
to the strength and effectiveness of the presi
dency.
It is our hope that in the remaining years of
his term Ike's political advisers will not allow
him to leave the capital every time he gets
tired and wants to get away from it all.
We still have faith in Eisenhower's leader
ship ability, which he has exhibited 011 occa
sion. It would be best for the country, and for
the political future of the Administration, if
he stayed in Washington and used this ability
as it should be used.

him, he was physically capable of carrying on
the duties of the presidency.

On his very inauguration day the President
caught a cold watching the parade, and it look
Augusta to shake it. We count
five weeks of vacation since the beginning of
his second term. Even considering the over
burdening duties demanded of the President
of the United States, it seems to us that to
claim 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as the Presi
dent's home address is getting to be somewhat
of a farce.
ith John Foster Dulles continuing his globe
hopping, this leaves a decided absence of
leadership in Washington. It is true that under
modern communication methods Ike can keep
in close touch with his advisers no matter where
he is, hut the spectacle of a lack of «a strong
hand in Washington does immeasurable harm
to the strength and effectiveness of the presi

It is our hope that in the remaining years of
his term Ike's political advisers will not allow
him to leave the capital every time he gets

We still have faith in Eisenhower's leader
ship ability, which he has exhibited 011 occa

he stayed in Washington and used this ability
as it should be used.
President Eisenhower hit hard at his critics
a couple of days ago, coming out strongly for
the foreign aid items in his budget and at
tacking the isolationism of many of his critics.
We applaud the fact that the President
seemed to he taking the offensive. But amidst
all this controversy we noticed another fact—
the President was well rested for taking his
offensive, having just returned from a 13-day
vacation in Augusta, Georgia.
Ever since his inauguration Mr. Eisenhower
seems to have spent the majority of his time
at vacation spots, going to vacation spots or
coming back from them.
We, like anybody else, think the President
must preserve his health or he will be 110 good
1o the country at all. But when more than
one third of his time is spent 011 golfing or
ocean cruises, then it presents some cause for
concern.
During his election campaign President Eis
enhower quite frankly admitted to the Ameri
can people that his health was not as good as
it formerly had been. He said lie would have
to take it easy during his next four years, but
that if be watched himself, his doctors had told
him, he was physically capable of carrying on
the duties of the presidency.
