Editor, The Daily:
Concerning the article that appeared yesterday*
reporting the speech of Mr. Ivirkwood, Controller
of the State of California, the article misstates
the position of Mr. Kirkwood on the recent for
mation of the Alcoholic Board of Control. He
said that to involve a tax collecting agency such
as the Board of Equalization in the enforcement
of the laws controlling the sale of alcoholic bev
erages is not logical. Expanding upon this stand,
he said that he approved the control of alcoholic
sales by the Alcoholic Board of Control.
Two years ago Mr. Kirkwood, as a member of
Ihe Board of Equalization, voled to urge the Leg
islature to remove Ihe control of alcoholic sales
from the jurisdiction of the Board of Equaliza
tion. The Legislature followed this recommenda
tion by forming the Alcoholic Board of Control
and charging it with the enforcement of the
laws concerning alcohol.

For the past few years the Medical School has

attempted to arrange a golf match with the Law
School faculty. Three times we have appeared
on the links with fond hopes of competing
against our fellow faculty members of the Law
School only on each occasion to be met by a
composite group of bankers, engineers, business
men and even out-and-out. ringers. Last year we
were met by the U.S. Army—clear-eyed, honest
appearing men with trim bodies and nerves of
steel, men who made us proud that they were
the representatives of our country, but who ob
viously bore no resemblance to lawyers.
For three years we Iried legal and lawful
means to insure an honest match and now,
finally having learned that justice is a principle
unknown to the law, we are appealing to the
power of the press to arrange an equilable and
just golf match between the Law School and ihe
Medical School.
The scientists and scholars making up Ihe fac
ulty of the Medical School are prepared to field
a representative team on Thursday afternoon,
the 23rd day of May, 1957. We hope there are
enough physically fit lawyers to oppose us.

School only on each occasion to be met by a
composite group of bankers, engineers, business
men and even out-and-out. ringers. Last year we
were met by the U.S. Army—clear-eyed, honest
appearing men with trim bodies and nerves of
steel, men who made us proud that they were
the representatives of our country, but who ob
viously bore no resemblance to lawyers.
For three years we Iried legal and lawful
means to insure an honest match and now,
finally having learned that justice is a principle
unknown to the law, we are appealing to the
power of the press to arrange an equilable and
just golf match between the Law School and ihe
Medical School.
The scientists and scholars making up Ihe fac
ulty of the Medical School are prepared to field
a representative team on Thursday afternoon,
the 23rd day of May, 1957. We hope there are
enough physically fit lawyers to oppose us.

Kirkwood Correction
Editor, The Daily:
Concerning the article that appeared yesterday*
reporting the speech of Mr. Ivirkwood, Controller
of the State of California, the article misstates
the position of Mr. Kirkwood on the recent for
mation of the Alcoholic Board of Control. He
said that to involve a tax collecting agency such
as the Board of Equalization in the enforcement
of the laws controlling the sale of alcoholic bev
erages is not logical. Expanding upon this stand,
he said that he approved the control of alcoholic
sales by the Alcoholic Board of Control.
Two years ago Mr. Kirkwood, as a member of
Ihe Board of Equalization, voled to urge the Leg
islature to remove Ihe control of alcoholic sales
from the jurisdiction of the Board of Equaliza
tion. The Legislature followed this recommenda
tion by forming the Alcoholic Board of Control
and charging it with the enforcement of the
laws concerning alcohol.

Editor, The Daily:
For the past few years the Medical School has

attempted to arrange a golf match with the Law
School faculty. Three times we have appeared
on the links with fond hopes of competing
against our fellow faculty members of the Law
School only on each occasion to be met by a
composite group of bankers, engineers, business
men and even out-and-out. ringers. Last year we
were met by the U.S. Army—clear-eyed, honest
appearing men with trim bodies and nerves of
steel, men who made us proud that they were
the representatives of our country, but who ob
viously bore no resemblance to lawyers.
For three years we Iried legal and lawful
means to insure an honest match and now,
finally having learned that justice is a principle
