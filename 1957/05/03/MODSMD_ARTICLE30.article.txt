# Swimmers to Host Trojans; 25-Game Skein Endangered
## 
### Jack Rannells 
Southern California's swim
mers—last to tumble Stanford in
PCC dual meet competition way
back in May, 1950--will give the
Indians' 25-game winning streak
its sternest test when they invade
Encina Pool tomorrow at 2:30
p.m.
The real drama of the meet
lies in the fact that the two teams
will be fairly evenly matched
USC's squad is notably strong
in the freestyle events with 1956
PCC 220-yard champion Jim Ste
venson and 1500-meter champion
Ron Severa heading the cast.
Fair Bet
Coach Tom Haynie's ace, Low
ell Johnson, is a fair bet to win
the 50-yard freestyle as he has
almost a full second advantage
over SC's Deutsch and Shaffer.
However, his exceptional 51.1
lime in the century against UC
LA last, week does not offer such
clear-cut advantage over Steven
son, who was clocked in 52.5
against Cal Poly Friday but has
done 50.7.
Stevenson swam the 220-yard
event in 2:11.0 against Poly,
In last week's meets Stanford's
Mahoney won the 440 in 4:53.9
while Severa, followed by Ibbet
son, won in 4:57.2.
SC in Breast-stroke
The Trojans' only other known
strength lies in the breaststroke
where Farnaday was clocked in
2:30.2 last Friday. His time is
matched by the Indians' Hynes
and Collins.
Miller and Black in the butter
fly and Mehl and Grunt in the
backstroke hold slight time edges
over the Trojans' Grounds and
Allen.
An admission fee of 50 cents
will be charged Stanford students
for tomorrow's meet. Adults will
be charged $1, while high school
students will be admitted for 60
cents.
