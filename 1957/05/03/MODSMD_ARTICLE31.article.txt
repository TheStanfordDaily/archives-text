# Netmen to Battle Improving California Squad; Dennison-Douglas Singles Tilt Seen as Thriller
## 
### Dave Canfield 
In their last and "biggest" PCC j
dual meet of the season, Coach
Boh Renker's highly rated tennis
players will host an improving
California team tomorrow at 1
p.m. on the varsity courts.
A capacity crowd is expected
for the match, which will be pre
ceded by a freshman encounter at
10 a.m.
Stanford is favored to repeat

its 7-2 early-season victory hut
I Cal could give the Indians a tus- 1
Isle, especially in first and second j
i singles and second doubles.
No. 1 man Jack Douglas
crushed Cal's Lorin Dennison, |
6-4, 6-0, in the year's first match, [
but Dennison has improved since
then and Douglas has been miss
ing practice lately because of
spring football.
Douglas, however, has been
; playing the greatest tennis of his j
life this spring, with wins over
Mike Green, Mike Franks and;
Alex Olmedo and the Northern |
California Intercollegiate crown j
to his credit. He also was runner
up in the recent Pacific Coast)
Conference meet.
Dennison, a 27-year-old netman !
| who did not take up the game
j until after graduating from high
school, is ranked as one of the
greatest "naturals" in tennis his
tory.
Over the Easter weekend, the!
smooth-stroking Bear ace carried
the top collegiate racketman in !
the country Alex Olmedo- to
three sets.
In second singles, California
has veteran Don Fimley, an im
proving player who sat out all of
last season. Pimley is rated as i
just slightly inferior to Dennison. I
Me carried Indian second man !
Brooks Rawlins to three sets in I
Ihe first encounter and Rawlins

is nursing a recently sprained
thumb.
Stanford netmen Dave Nelson,
Gil White, Lowell Carruth and
Bob Bowden expected to
sweep the remaining singles
matches, but a battle royal may
ensue in second doubles.
Dennison and partner Larry
Axtell function here and walked
all over White-Rawlins the first
time out.
First doubles could also be
close with Pimley and heavy hit
ter Don Stensaas opposing Doug
las-Nelson.
The Indians might be upset,
but it's the "Big Match" and
Coach Renker predicts, "We
should win."

Douglas, however, has been
; playing the greatest tennis of his j
life this spring, with wins over
Mike Green, Mike Franks and;
Alex Olmedo and the Northern |
California Intercollegiate crown j
to his credit. He also was runner
up in the recent Pacific Coast)
Conference meet.
Dennison, a 27-year-old netman !
| who did not take up the game
j until after graduating from high
school, is ranked as one of the
greatest "naturals" in tennis his
tory.
Over the Easter weekend, the!
smooth-stroking Bear ace carried
the top collegiate racketman in !
the country Alex Olmedo- to
three sets.
In second singles, California
has veteran Don Fimley, an im
proving player who sat out all of
last season. Pimley is rated as i
just slightly inferior to Dennison. I
Me carried Indian second man !
Brooks Rawlins to three sets in I
Ihe first encounter and Rawlins

is nursing a recently sprained
thumb.
Stanford netmen Dave Nelson,
Gil White, Lowell Carruth and
Bob Bowden expected to
sweep the remaining singles
matches, but a battle royal may
ensue in second doubles.
Dennison and partner Larry
Axtell function here and walked
all over White-Rawlins the first
time out.
First doubles could also be
close with Pimley and heavy hit
ter Don Stensaas opposing Doug
las-Nelson.
The Indians might be upset,
but it's the "Big Match" and
Coach Renker predicts, "We
should win."
In their last and "biggest" PCC j
dual meet of the season, Coach
Boh Renker's highly rated tennis
players will host an improving
California team tomorrow at 1
p.m. on the varsity courts.
A capacity crowd is expected
for the match, which will be pre
ceded by a freshman encounter at
10 a.m.
Stanford is favored to repeat

its 7-2 early-season victory hut
I Cal could give the Indians a tus- 1
Isle, especially in first and second j
i singles and second doubles.
No. 1 man Jack Douglas
crushed Cal's Lorin Dennison, |
6-4, 6-0, in the year's first match, [
but Dennison has improved since
then and Douglas has been miss
ing practice lately because of
spring football.
