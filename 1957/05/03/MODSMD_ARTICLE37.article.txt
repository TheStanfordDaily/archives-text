# SUMMER RESIDENCE
## Convalescent Home Situated In Senator Stanford's House 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Once a stately house in which famous personalities from through
out the world were entertained, the Stanford residence is now the
home of 80 convalescing children.
Leland Stanford, Sacramento storekeeper turned railroader, gov
ernor, U.S. senator and University founder, purchased his "summer

house" in 1876.
Immediately following the pur
chase of the house and land near-
San Franeisquito Creek, the Stari
fords had two wings added to
the main house.
The three-story frame building
was simply decorated, according
to the standards of the day.
Entering through Iho main hall
of the original cottage, the visitor
observed two small parlors fur
nished in French Provincial, with
gold and rose predominating.
Formal Meals
From the dining room the
guest entered the library, contain
ing woodwork of superb Spanish
cedar. Following formal evening
meals Senator Stanford took his
male guests into a small smoking
room.
The beautiful grounds of the
Stanford residence had a natural
park - like effect. The Chinese
head gardener developed in box
hedge the forms of several ani
mals. The lawns and winding
roads were swept daily, "almost
dusted," commented one of the
Stanfords' frequent visitors.
Senator Stanford lived in this
home until his death in 1893. Mrs.
Stanford continued residence un
til her death in 1905. The follow
ing year most of the old residence
toppled in the famous San Fran
cisco earthquake.
Partially Rebuilt
It was partially rebuilt and oc
cupied until 1919. Two years be
fore this, Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
then University chaplain, had ini
tiated a summer program on the
campus for convalescing chil
dren. The children were housed
at the Phi Sigma Kappa house
until school began in the fall.
In 1919 Timothy Hopkins,
member of the Board of Trust
tees, suggested to the board that
they give 27 acres of land and
the house to the "Campus Auxil
iary to Stanford Clinics," as the
Con Home was called. The board
gave the land and the old resi
dence on a $1 per year lease and
made Dr. Gardner the first presi
dent of the Board of Directors.
" Run-abouts"
Twelve "run-abouts" (children
who had recovered enough to be
out of bed) lived in the house,
which - was now open all year
round. In 1923 a gift of $40,000
from Mrs. Henry Crocker made
possible the building of the Mc-
Laughlin Bed Unit. Also in this
year a school was begun on the
old back porch of the residence.
From then on the Home mush
roomed. In 1928-29 a $50,000 aux
iliary was built, accommodating
80 children. As the children were
moved out of the house, the first
floor of the unit was converted
into administration offices and
meeting rooms for auxiliaries.
The second and third floors be
came the living quarters of the
staff.
Following the completion of
the administration building in
1953, the first floor is being user!
for physical, speech and occupa
tional therapy.

From then on the Home mush
roomed. In 1928-29 a $50,000 aux
iliary was built, accommodating
80 children. As the children were
moved out of the house, the first
floor of the unit was converted
into administration offices and
meeting rooms for auxiliaries.
The second and third floors be
came the living quarters of the
staff.
Following the completion of
the administration building in
1953, the first floor is being user!
for physical, speech and occupa
tional therapy.
Once a stately house in which famous personalities from through
out the world were entertained, the Stanford residence is now the
home of 80 convalescing children.
Leland Stanford, Sacramento storekeeper turned railroader, gov
ernor, U.S. senator and University founder, purchased his "summer

house" in 1876.
Immediately following the pur
chase of the house and land near-
San Franeisquito Creek, the Stari
fords had two wings added to
the main house.
The three-story frame building
was simply decorated, according
to the standards of the day.
Entering through Iho main hall
of the original cottage, the visitor
observed two small parlors fur
nished in French Provincial, with
gold and rose predominating.
Formal Meals
From the dining room the
guest entered the library, contain
ing woodwork of superb Spanish
cedar. Following formal evening
meals Senator Stanford took his
male guests into a small smoking
room.
The beautiful grounds of the
Stanford residence had a natural
park - like effect. The Chinese
head gardener developed in box
hedge the forms of several ani
mals. The lawns and winding
roads were swept daily, "almost
dusted," commented one of the
Stanfords' frequent visitors.
Senator Stanford lived in this
home until his death in 1893. Mrs.
Stanford continued residence un
til her death in 1905. The follow
ing year most of the old residence
toppled in the famous San Fran
cisco earthquake.
Partially Rebuilt
It was partially rebuilt and oc
cupied until 1919. Two years be
fore this, Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
then University chaplain, had ini
tiated a summer program on the
campus for convalescing chil
dren. The children were housed
at the Phi Sigma Kappa house
until school began in the fall.
In 1919 Timothy Hopkins,
member of the Board of Trust
tees, suggested to the board that
they give 27 acres of land and
the house to the "Campus Auxil
iary to Stanford Clinics," as the
Con Home was called. The board
gave the land and the old resi
dence on a $1 per year lease and
made Dr. Gardner the first presi
dent of the Board of Directors.
" Run-abouts"
Twelve "run-abouts" (children
who had recovered enough to be
out of bed) lived in the house,
which - was now open all year
round. In 1923 a gift of $40,000
from Mrs. Henry Crocker made
possible the building of the Mc-
Laughlin Bed Unit. Also in this
year a school was begun on the
old back porch of the residence.
