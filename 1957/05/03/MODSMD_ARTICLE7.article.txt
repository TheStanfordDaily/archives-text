# Liver Ailment Kills Senator In Washington
## Ends 11-Year Career Highlighted by Claims Of Communism in U.S. 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 2 (UP) —
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wis.)
died today at the age of 47. He
succumbed at Bethesda Naval
Hospital at 6:02 p.m. (EDT).
The hospital announced that the
senator, who was admitted Sun
day, died of "acute hepatitic fail
ure," a failure of the functions of
the liver. McCarthy's wife, Jean,
was present at his bedside when
he succumbed.
The last rites of the Roman
Catholic church were administer
ed to McCarthy about 5 p.m. by
Comdr. Gabriel J. Naughten, Cath
olic chaplain at the hospital.
A hospital spokesman said Mc-
Carthy took a turn for the worse
sometime between 4 and 5 p.m.—
"he was slipping." At about 5:30
p.m. (EDT), the spokesman said,
"it became obvious that he could
not be saved."
There was no immediate infor
mation whether an autopsy would
be performed.
Mrs*. McCarthy There
Aside from Mrs. McCarthy, the
only persons present at the death
bed were members of the staff of
the Medical Service.
The spokesman said he was not
able to say immediately whether
McCarthy was conscious to the
end.
McCarthy had been in serious
condition throughout the five days
of his hospitalization. He had suf
fered from various ailments at
times over the past few years.
McCarthy's second term in the
Senate was due to expire next
year. The death of the GOP sena
tor from the predominantly Re
publican state of Wisconsin pre
sumably would cause nb change
in the present Senate lineup of 40
Democrats and 47 Republicans.
Elected to Senate
McCarthy was elected to the
Senate in 1946, but his tumultuous
career as a national and contro
versial figure did not start until
Feb. 9, 1950, when he delivered
his famed Communists-in-govern
ment speech at Wheeling, W. Va.
He charged then that there were
205 "card-carrying" Communists
employed in the State Depart
ment. He later reduced the figure
to 57, but the echoes of his speech
boiled up into a national contro
versy which spanned several
years.
Few people were neutral about
the junior senator from Wiscon
sin. His name was a household
word as he blasted away at. for
mer President Truman and Secre
tary of State Dean Acheson and
continued his feud with the execu
tive branch of the government aft
er President Eisenhower entered
the White House.

News of McCarthy's death
reached the Capitol after most
lawmakers had gone home for the
day. However, all Capitol flags
were lowered to half-staff.
Acheson, one of McCarthy's
chief targets, said he had "no
comment at all." He quoted a
Latin phrase which he translated,
"Say nothing about the dead un
less it is good."
