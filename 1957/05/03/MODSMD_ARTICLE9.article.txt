# Track Team, Baseball Squads To Battle California Tomorrow
## Bitter Struggle Expected in 62nd Big Track Meet 
### Dick Barnes 
It's the Big Meet!
Stanford and California, two of
the nation's oldest track foes,
clash in the 62nd renewal of their
bitter rivalry tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. on the Edwards Stadium oval
in Berkeley.
Tradition is old and deep-seated
at Big Meet time, and the past
record usually means little. To
morrow's battle is expected to be
no exception to this rule, with a
close point fight expected.
Neither Cal nor Stanford has
compiled an impressive won-lost
mark in dual meet competition
this season, but both squads have
had their share of good perform
ances.
Payton,Jordan, at the midway
point in his first year at the helm
of the Tribe spikers, will be seek
ing to direct his team to their 33rd
victory over California in a series
which dates back to 1893. The In
dians will also be after their third
straight win over Brutus Hamil
ton's Bears.
Unpredictable Events
If Stanford is to win tomor
row's climactic meet, it must do
especially well in the events which
are rated almost toss-ups. Most
unpredictable among these are
two field events—the pole vault
and the shot-put.
Mike Franchetti is the key man
in Indian pole-vault fortunes. He
has cleared the modest height of
13-0 this season, but goes into the
Big Meet with the best mark of
any entrant.
But Franchetti isn't the only
Stanford hope. In addition to the
other regular vaulters, Bob Gast
and Dick Hughes, Jordan is going
to enter javelin thrower Kirk Nie
land. He hasn't vaulted since high
school, but was a better-than-av
erage performer while a prep.
California expects to counter
with George Goad and Bill Neu
feld—the latter, like Nieland, a
javelin thrower. Neither man has
hit 13-0 yet this year, but the field

as a whole is enough bunched to
the point where any of the com
petitors could win.
Plain Is Question
Burly Chris Plain is the ques
tion mark who hovers above the
shot-put picture. He was hurt
earlier this year- and hasn't put
well in any of the last three meets.
But Plain has looked good in the
workouts this week, hitting the
53-foot mark, which he reached
before being injured.
If Plain and Ray Williamson, a
51-foot-plus performer, can ap
proach their best marks, they will
put up a good fight against Gal's
52-foot duo of Paul Magistretti
and Proverb Jacobs.
Hurdler Chuck Cobb is one of
the meet's three likely double
winners. Cobb, a consistently good
stickman all season, ranks far
above any other Cal man and has
continually demonstrated that he
is the best of Stanford's hurdlers.
Cobb also has a fair chance at
both of the meet hurdle records.
He has run just one-tenth slower
than the highs mark of 14.2 and
has bettered the lows standard of
23.2 by one-tenth, running with a
slightly aiding wind.
The other probable double win
ners are both Cal men Don Bow
den and Loiimon King. Bowden is
expected to double in the mile
and the XBO and may also anchor
the relay team. He should easily
crack the XBO standard of 1:52.3
and also stands a good chance to


BALL GAME — Bob Leopold, pictured above, is the starting
pitcher in Saturday's game at Edwards Field at Berkeley. In three
complete games lie has not allowed a single earned run. Stanford
has a record of six wins and six los-ses in CIBA play, and Cal has
a record of seven wins and three losses. Time for the game is
3:30 p.m.
better the mile record of 4:11.5.
King ranks as one of the world's
fastest dashmen and should have
no trouble winning the 100 and
220. The meet mark of 9.. r > in the
century will also ho in danger if
King goes all-out.
Stanford's chief hopes to win
flat races are Maury Graves and
Don Chesarek. The former will be
pitted against Cal's Bob House,
the nation's second fastest collegi
ate two-miler. Since House is also
expected to .run the he may
not be completely fresh for the
longer run.
G rave s has been improving j
greatly the past two meets, drop ;
ping his time to 9:14.7. No matter :
whether it is Graves or House
who wins, the victor should finish '
well under Graves' meet record
of 9:21.5.
Rugged Battle
Chesarek will face a rugged bat- j
lie in the 440 from Cal's Art Stew- ;
art and Stuart Gould. Gould, how- j
ever-, may not he in top shape for
the race because of recent illness.
Stanford's trio of Chuck Ince, Bob !
Hyde and Bill Carls will all be in
the fight for Ihird wilLi Stewart
and\ could move up further if
Gould falters.
Stanford's busiest performer
will be, as usual, co-captain Frank
Herrmann. He will be a heavy
favorite in Ihe broad 'jump and j
will be in the fight for runner-up j
honors in both sprints.
Herrmann continued his excel
lent improvement in the jumping I
event against Oxy when he broke i
ihe 25-foot mark by % inch. Herr
mann also had a narrow foul at!
25-8, so may be ready to challenge j
the 26-foot barrier. Well within I
his range is the meet record of.
25-2 Mj.
Other Favorites
The other three Indian field i
event favorites — Hank Roldan,
Phil Fehlen and Fred Peters—all i
are within reach of meet records j
in addition to meet victories.
Roldan is only about two feet j
behind the javelin mark of 229-BVi
and could hit that distance if he
continues his week-to-week im
provement. Peters has already
thrown the discus eight feet far
ther than-lhe Big Meet standard!
of 164-5%.
Co-captain Fehlen, the choice in ;
the high jump, holds the meet i
mark of 6-7 set last year. This J
year he has already gone 6-8%, j
second best in Ihe nation's col-1
legiate ranks.

Herrmann continued his excel
lent improvement in the jumping I
event against Oxy when he broke i
ihe 25-foot mark by % inch. Herr
mann also had a narrow foul at!
25-8, so may be ready to challenge j
the 26-foot barrier. Well within I
his range is the meet record of.
25-2 Mj.
Other Favorites
The other three Indian field i
event favorites — Hank Roldan,
Phil Fehlen and Fred Peters—all i
are within reach of meet records j
in addition to meet victories.
Roldan is only about two feet j
behind the javelin mark of 229-BVi
and could hit that distance if he
continues his week-to-week im
provement. Peters has already
thrown the discus eight feet far
ther than-lhe Big Meet standard!
of 164-5%.
Co-captain Fehlen, the choice in ;
the high jump, holds the meet i
mark of 6-7 set last year. This J
year he has already gone 6-8%, j
second best in Ihe nation's col-1
legiate ranks.
It's the Big Meet!
Stanford and California, two of
the nation's oldest track foes,
clash in the 62nd renewal of their
bitter rivalry tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. on the Edwards Stadium oval
in Berkeley.
Tradition is old and deep-seated
at Big Meet time, and the past
record usually means little. To
morrow's battle is expected to be
no exception to this rule, with a
close point fight expected.
Neither Cal nor Stanford has
compiled an impressive won-lost
mark in dual meet competition
this season, but both squads have
had their share of good perform
ances.
Payton,Jordan, at the midway
point in his first year at the helm
of the Tribe spikers, will be seek
ing to direct his team to their 33rd
victory over California in a series
which dates back to 1893. The In
dians will also be after their third
straight win over Brutus Hamil
ton's Bears.
Unpredictable Events
If Stanford is to win tomor
row's climactic meet, it must do
especially well in the events which
are rated almost toss-ups. Most
unpredictable among these are
two field events—the pole vault
and the shot-put.
Mike Franchetti is the key man
in Indian pole-vault fortunes. He
has cleared the modest height of
13-0 this season, but goes into the
Big Meet with the best mark of
any entrant.
But Franchetti isn't the only
Stanford hope. In addition to the
other regular vaulters, Bob Gast
and Dick Hughes, Jordan is going
to enter javelin thrower Kirk Nie
land. He hasn't vaulted since high
school, but was a better-than-av
erage performer while a prep.
California expects to counter
with George Goad and Bill Neu
feld—the latter, like Nieland, a
javelin thrower. Neither man has
hit 13-0 yet this year, but the field

as a whole is enough bunched to
the point where any of the com
petitors could win.
Plain Is Question
Burly Chris Plain is the ques
tion mark who hovers above the
shot-put picture. He was hurt
earlier this year- and hasn't put
well in any of the last three meets.
But Plain has looked good in the
workouts this week, hitting the
53-foot mark, which he reached
before being injured.
If Plain and Ray Williamson, a
51-foot-plus performer, can ap
proach their best marks, they will
put up a good fight against Gal's
52-foot duo of Paul Magistretti
and Proverb Jacobs.
Hurdler Chuck Cobb is one of
the meet's three likely double
winners. Cobb, a consistently good
stickman all season, ranks far
above any other Cal man and has
continually demonstrated that he
is the best of Stanford's hurdlers.
Cobb also has a fair chance at
both of the meet hurdle records.
He has run just one-tenth slower
than the highs mark of 14.2 and
has bettered the lows standard of
23.2 by one-tenth, running with a
slightly aiding wind.
The other probable double win
ners are both Cal men Don Bow
den and Loiimon King. Bowden is
expected to double in the mile
and the XBO and may also anchor
the relay team. He should easily
crack the XBO standard of 1:52.3
and also stands a good chance to


BALL GAME — Bob Leopold, pictured above, is the starting
pitcher in Saturday's game at Edwards Field at Berkeley. In three
complete games lie has not allowed a single earned run. Stanford
has a record of six wins and six los-ses in CIBA play, and Cal has
a record of seven wins and three losses. Time for the game is
3:30 p.m.
better the mile record of 4:11.5.
King ranks as one of the world's
fastest dashmen and should have
no trouble winning the 100 and
220. The meet mark of 9.. r > in the
century will also ho in danger if
King goes all-out.
Stanford's chief hopes to win
flat races are Maury Graves and
Don Chesarek. The former will be
pitted against Cal's Bob House,
the nation's second fastest collegi
ate two-miler. Since House is also
expected to .run the he may
not be completely fresh for the
longer run.
G rave s has been improving j
greatly the past two meets, drop ;
ping his time to 9:14.7. No matter :
whether it is Graves or House
who wins, the victor should finish '
well under Graves' meet record
of 9:21.5.
Rugged Battle
Chesarek will face a rugged bat- j
lie in the 440 from Cal's Art Stew- ;
art and Stuart Gould. Gould, how- j
ever-, may not he in top shape for
the race because of recent illness.
Stanford's trio of Chuck Ince, Bob !
Hyde and Bill Carls will all be in
the fight for Ihird wilLi Stewart
and\ could move up further if
Gould falters.
Stanford's busiest performer
will be, as usual, co-captain Frank
Herrmann. He will be a heavy
favorite in Ihe broad 'jump and j
will be in the fight for runner-up j
honors in both sprints.
Herrmann continued his excel
lent improvement in the jumping I

ate two-miler. Since House is also
expected to .run the he may
not be completely fresh for the
longer run.
G rave s has been improving j
greatly the past two meets, drop ;
ping his time to 9:14.7. No matter :
whether it is Graves or House
who wins, the victor should finish '
well under Graves' meet record
of 9:21.5.
Rugged Battle
Chesarek will face a rugged bat- j
lie in the 440 from Cal's Art Stew- ;
art and Stuart Gould. Gould, how- j
ever-, may not he in top shape for
the race because of recent illness.
Stanford's trio of Chuck Ince, Bob !
Hyde and Bill Carls will all be in
the fight for Ihird wilLi Stewart
and\ could move up further if
Gould falters.
Stanford's busiest performer
will be, as usual, co-captain Frank
Herrmann. He will be a heavy
favorite in Ihe broad 'jump and j
will be in the fight for runner-up j
honors in both sprints.
Herrmann continued his excel
lent improvement in the jumping I
event against Oxy when he broke i
ihe 25-foot mark by % inch. Herr
mann also had a narrow foul at!
25-8, so may be ready to challenge j
the 26-foot barrier. Well within I
his range is the meet record of.
25-2 Mj.
Other Favorites
The other three Indian field i
event favorites — Hank Roldan,
Phil Fehlen and Fred Peters—all i
are within reach of meet records j
in addition to meet victories.
Roldan is only about two feet j
behind the javelin mark of 229-BVi
and could hit that distance if he
continues his week-to-week im
provement. Peters has already
thrown the discus eight feet far
ther than-lhe Big Meet standard!
of 164-5%.
Co-captain Fehlen, the choice in ;
the high jump, holds the meet i
mark of 6-7 set last year. This J
year he has already gone 6-8%, j
second best in Ihe nation's col-1
legiate ranks.
It's the Big Meet!
Stanford and California, two of
the nation's oldest track foes,
clash in the 62nd renewal of their
bitter rivalry tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. on the Edwards Stadium oval
in Berkeley.
Tradition is old and deep-seated
at Big Meet time, and the past
record usually means little. To
morrow's battle is expected to be
no exception to this rule, with a
close point fight expected.
Neither Cal nor Stanford has
compiled an impressive won-lost
mark in dual meet competition
this season, but both squads have
had their share of good perform
ances.
Payton,Jordan, at the midway
point in his first year at the helm
of the Tribe spikers, will be seek
ing to direct his team to their 33rd
victory over California in a series
which dates back to 1893. The In
dians will also be after their third
straight win over Brutus Hamil
ton's Bears.
Unpredictable Events
If Stanford is to win tomor
row's climactic meet, it must do
especially well in the events which
are rated almost toss-ups. Most
unpredictable among these are
two field events—the pole vault
and the shot-put.
Mike Franchetti is the key man
in Indian pole-vault fortunes. He
has cleared the modest height of
13-0 this season, but goes into the
Big Meet with the best mark of
any entrant.
But Franchetti isn't the only
Stanford hope. In addition to the
other regular vaulters, Bob Gast
and Dick Hughes, Jordan is going
to enter javelin thrower Kirk Nie
land. He hasn't vaulted since high
school, but was a better-than-av
erage performer while a prep.
California expects to counter
with George Goad and Bill Neu
feld—the latter, like Nieland, a
javelin thrower. Neither man has
hit 13-0 yet this year, but the field

as a whole is enough bunched to
the point where any of the com
petitors could win.
Plain Is Question
Burly Chris Plain is the ques
tion mark who hovers above the
shot-put picture. He was hurt
earlier this year- and hasn't put
well in any of the last three meets.
But Plain has looked good in the
workouts this week, hitting the
53-foot mark, which he reached
before being injured.
If Plain and Ray Williamson, a
51-foot-plus performer, can ap
proach their best marks, they will
put up a good fight against Gal's
52-foot duo of Paul Magistretti
and Proverb Jacobs.
Hurdler Chuck Cobb is one of
the meet's three likely double
winners. Cobb, a consistently good
stickman all season, ranks far
above any other Cal man and has
continually demonstrated that he
is the best of Stanford's hurdlers.
Cobb also has a fair chance at
both of the meet hurdle records.
He has run just one-tenth slower
than the highs mark of 14.2 and
has bettered the lows standard of
23.2 by one-tenth, running with a
slightly aiding wind.
The other probable double win
ners are both Cal men Don Bow
den and Loiimon King. Bowden is
expected to double in the mile
and the XBO and may also anchor
the relay team. He should easily
crack the XBO standard of 1:52.3
and also stands a good chance to


BALL GAME — Bob Leopold, pictured above, is the starting
pitcher in Saturday's game at Edwards Field at Berkeley. In three
complete games lie has not allowed a single earned run. Stanford
has a record of six wins and six los-ses in CIBA play, and Cal has
a record of seven wins and three losses. Time for the game is
3:30 p.m.

King ranks as one of the world's
fastest dashmen and should have
no trouble winning the 100 and
220. The meet mark of 9.. r > in the
century will also ho in danger if
King goes all-out.
Stanford's chief hopes to win
flat races are Maury Graves and
Don Chesarek. The former will be
pitted against Cal's Bob House,
the nation's second fastest collegi

den and Loiimon King. Bowden is
expected to double in the mile
and the XBO and may also anchor
the relay team. He should easily
crack the XBO standard of 1:52.3
and also stands a good chance to


BALL GAME — Bob Leopold, pictured above, is the starting
pitcher in Saturday's game at Edwards Field at Berkeley. In three
complete games lie has not allowed a single earned run. Stanford
has a record of six wins and six los-ses in CIBA play, and Cal has
a record of seven wins and three losses. Time for the game is
3:30 p.m.
better the mile record of 4:11.5.
King ranks as one of the world's
fastest dashmen and should have
no trouble winning the 100 and
220. The meet mark of 9.. r > in the
century will also ho in danger if
King goes all-out.
Stanford's chief hopes to win
flat races are Maury Graves and
Don Chesarek. The former will be
pitted against Cal's Bob House,
the nation's second fastest collegi
ate two-miler. Since House is also
expected to .run the he may
not be completely fresh for the
longer run.
G rave s has been improving j
greatly the past two meets, drop ;
ping his time to 9:14.7. No matter :
whether it is Graves or House
who wins, the victor should finish '
well under Graves' meet record
of 9:21.5.
Rugged Battle
Chesarek will face a rugged bat- j
lie in the 440 from Cal's Art Stew- ;
art and Stuart Gould. Gould, how- j
ever-, may not he in top shape for
the race because of recent illness.
Stanford's trio of Chuck Ince, Bob !
Hyde and Bill Carls will all be in
the fight for Ihird wilLi Stewart
and\ could move up further if
Gould falters.
Stanford's busiest performer
will be, as usual, co-captain Frank
Herrmann. He will be a heavy
favorite in Ihe broad 'jump and j
will be in the fight for runner-up j
honors in both sprints.
Herrmann continued his excel
lent improvement in the jumping I
event against Oxy when he broke i
ihe 25-foot mark by % inch. Herr
mann also had a narrow foul at!
25-8, so may be ready to challenge j
the 26-foot barrier. Well within I
his range is the meet record of.
25-2 Mj.
Other Favorites
The other three Indian field i
event favorites — Hank Roldan,
Phil Fehlen and Fred Peters—all i
are within reach of meet records j
in addition to meet victories.
Roldan is only about two feet j
behind the javelin mark of 229-BVi
and could hit that distance if he
continues his week-to-week im
provement. Peters has already
thrown the discus eight feet far
ther than-lhe Big Meet standard!
of 164-5%.
Co-captain Fehlen, the choice in ;
the high jump, holds the meet i
mark of 6-7 set last year. This J
year he has already gone 6-8%, j
second best in Ihe nation's col-1
legiate ranks.
It's the Big Meet!
Stanford and California, two of
the nation's oldest track foes,
clash in the 62nd renewal of their
bitter rivalry tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. on the Edwards Stadium oval
in Berkeley.
Tradition is old and deep-seated
at Big Meet time, and the past
record usually means little. To
morrow's battle is expected to be
no exception to this rule, with a
close point fight expected.
Neither Cal nor Stanford has
compiled an impressive won-lost
mark in dual meet competition
this season, but both squads have
had their share of good perform
ances.
Payton,Jordan, at the midway
point in his first year at the helm
of the Tribe spikers, will be seek
ing to direct his team to their 33rd
victory over California in a series
which dates back to 1893. The In
dians will also be after their third
straight win over Brutus Hamil
ton's Bears.
Unpredictable Events
If Stanford is to win tomor
row's climactic meet, it must do
especially well in the events which
are rated almost toss-ups. Most
unpredictable among these are
two field events—the pole vault
and the shot-put.
Mike Franchetti is the key man
in Indian pole-vault fortunes. He
has cleared the modest height of
13-0 this season, but goes into the
Big Meet with the best mark of
any entrant.
But Franchetti isn't the only
Stanford hope. In addition to the
other regular vaulters, Bob Gast
and Dick Hughes, Jordan is going
to enter javelin thrower Kirk Nie
land. He hasn't vaulted since high
school, but was a better-than-av
erage performer while a prep.
California expects to counter
with George Goad and Bill Neu
feld—the latter, like Nieland, a
javelin thrower. Neither man has
hit 13-0 yet this year, but the field

as a whole is enough bunched to
the point where any of the com
petitors could win.
Plain Is Question
Burly Chris Plain is the ques
tion mark who hovers above the
shot-put picture. He was hurt
earlier this year- and hasn't put
well in any of the last three meets.
But Plain has looked good in the
workouts this week, hitting the
53-foot mark, which he reached
before being injured.
If Plain and Ray Williamson, a
51-foot-plus performer, can ap
proach their best marks, they will
put up a good fight against Gal's
52-foot duo of Paul Magistretti
and Proverb Jacobs.
Hurdler Chuck Cobb is one of
the meet's three likely double
winners. Cobb, a consistently good
stickman all season, ranks far
above any other Cal man and has
continually demonstrated that he
is the best of Stanford's hurdlers.
Cobb also has a fair chance at
both of the meet hurdle records.
He has run just one-tenth slower
than the highs mark of 14.2 and
has bettered the lows standard of
23.2 by one-tenth, running with a
slightly aiding wind.
The other probable double win
ners are both Cal men Don Bow
den and Loiimon King. Bowden is
expected to double in the mile
and the XBO and may also anchor
the relay team. He should easily
crack the XBO standard of 1:52.3
and also stands a good chance to
