ROMAN ROMP
OUR LAWLES^LANGUAGE*
The laws that govern plural word 9
I think are strictly for the birds.
If goose in plural comes out geese
Why are not two of moose then meese?
If two of mouse comes out as mice
Should not the plural house be hice?
If we say he, and his, and him
Then why not she, and shis, and shim?
No wonder kids flunk out of schools
. . . English doesn't follow rules! fl")
MORAL: The singularly plural pleasures
of Chesterfield King make a man
