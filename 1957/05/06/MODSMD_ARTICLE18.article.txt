There can be little doubt that the McCarthy
treatment of Communist suspects never as
sumed the dimensions of the Communist treat
ment of non-Communists, either in method or in
substance. The Communist propaganda ground
out by various party machines throughout the
world duiing the Stalinist bid for Russian global
domination dubbed every non-Communist a "re
actionary," an "enemy of the people," a "traitor
to the country" or a "stooge of the foreign im
perialists."
Each of these categories of people deserved
the severest of penalties which the "people"
could be capable of inflicting upon them; it was
right to launch underground campaigns of ha
tred against them, 1o make them wretched and
miserable in every possible way, to butcher
them and to throw them to the hounds. To
achieve these objectives, it was right to set up
well-organized and well-disciplined conspiracies.
The result was that in many under-developed
countries, where 80 per cent of the people were
illiterate and gullible, the power of established
governments weakened and the Communist un
derworld became the controller and director of
street mobs.
It was impossible to deal in a purely demo
cratic way with this extremely abnormal situ
ation in which thousands of Communists, mas
querading as sympathizers with the established
order, sneaked their way into every walk of
public life, including state service, with the in
tent of sabotaging the administration. Even the
Tndian and Pakistani governments were forced
to put thousands of persons in detention without
a trial, because these suspected Communists
could be allowed all citizenship privileges only
at an incalculable risk to national security.
1 am not endeavoring to prove that McCarthy
was right, but only that the Senate-White House
reaction to his "extremism" of approach to the
Communist problem took into account only the
American situation while whatever happened
in this country could not be prevented from hav
ing repercussions abroad, as the United States
had assumed the leadership of the free world.
The Communists succeeded in convincing the
illiterate and gullible publics of Asia that what
was wrong in America was wrong elsewhere too,
regardless of the differences in social structure,
degrees of administrative competence, percent
ages of illiteracy, economic discontent, etc. They
also succeeded in' provirtg their hitherto un
proved thesis that the White House-Senate de
nunciation of McCarthy was a much-awaited
inevitable symptom of the failure of the "capi
talist" system, and that what had happened to
McCarthy could happen to Trumans, Achesons
and Eisenhowers, as the process of the "capital
ist self-disillusionment" grew. The basic Ameri
can mistake in the McCarthy affair was the
participation of the diplomatic and information
staff abroad in the anti-McCarthy campaign, de

spite their lack of understanding of the nature
of the societies in which they were operating.
I have no hesitation in saying that the reason
why 90 per cent of the people in my own town
readily agreed to the assertion that the execution
of the Rosenbergs was a "judicial murder" was
that the "self-accusing" American propaganda
on the McCarthy issue had paved the ground
for it.
I do not that McCarthy could have been
right in whatever he did—at least in his conflict

with the army he was obviously wrong—yet,
perhaps, lie rightly felt thai'the reasons for his
denunciation by the administration were far
deeper than the lattcr's professed protection of
individual rights, although this profession, in
iriy opinion, was not altogether unfounded. When
I was his guest in November, 1955, McCarthy
told ine that most of the executive "arrogance"
against him took its hue from the perennial
issue of American politics, the question of the
separation of powers. "It was inherent in the
nature of life Presidency," he said, "to resist
such Senate probes."
Never before did any Senate investigator ever
launch so direct an assault upon the handling of
national affairs by the executive branch, and this
could not fail to influence the attitude of the vic
tims of the assault, even if the assault was mis
conceived or misdirected.
I hold no brief for whatever McCarthy did,
but I could never get rid of the impression that
his sins of omission and commission were ex
aggerated by his critics. lie was depicted in
Asian countries as an advocate of "American
imperialism," which obviously he was not, and
as an opponent of all economic aid to foreign
countries, which too he never was. On more
than one occasion he told me that what he
wanted was only that instead of wasting money
on governments like Tito's, more attention
should bo paid to strengthening countries friend
ly to the free world.
I am sure history will not judge McCarthy
the way he was judged in Ihe heat of the
moment on various occasions in his short but
eventful career as an anti-Communist investi
gator.
