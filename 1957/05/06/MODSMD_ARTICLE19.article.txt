Editor, The Daily:
The fact that the President of the United
States spends "more than one-third of his time
on golfing or ocean cruising" certainly does
"present some cause for concern." But in your
editorial, "Ike's Vacations," you fail to mention
one point.
In the American governmental structure it is
customary that the President, be the social as
well as the political chief of state. His duties
while he is in Washington include not only lead
ing the government, but also such things as
throwing dinner parties for members of Con
gress, greeting plenipotentiaries, "saying a few
words" at innumerable functions, and seeing an
endless horde of "important" people. True, the
Vice-President can take over some of this load,
but there is no substitute for the President him

self. Recently, for example, King Sand came to
Washington. Who had to show him the town?
Why, nobody would "do" but the President.
It is true that Mr. Eisenhower spends a great
amount of time away from Washington, but it
just could be true also that the chief reason for
this is not a mania for the Georgia climate, but
Ihe fact that he is forced to get away from the
White House in order to rpl some work done.
Perhaps the British have the light idea. Un
der their system the Queen'takes care of the
social and theatrical obligations, leaving the
Prime Minister free to carry on the business of
heading the government. Instead of separating
the dulies in this way, we combine the two anri
do our best to kill the President. This is not to
propose having a "Queen of the United States,"
but it does suggest that il is our present system
which is responsible for' forcing the President
to flee periodically from Washington.
