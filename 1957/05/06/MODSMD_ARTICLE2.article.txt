# Stanford Baseball Team Tops Cal on Squeeze Play
## Shaw Bunts In Fletcher for Victory; Win Leaves Card CIBA Mark at 7-6 
### Bob Payne 
Second baseman AI Shaw squeezed home center fielder Bobby
Fletcher with the winning run in the top of the eighth inning Sat
urdey to give Hie Card diamondmen an important 2-1 victory over
California in a CIBA game at Berkeley.
The Tribe's record now stands at 7-6 with one game against

league • leading Southern Califor
nia and two against Cal, all this
week, remaining on the schedule.
The Bears currently have a 7-4
mark and must face USC twice.
The Trojans are ineligible for
NCAA competition, leaving the
berth open to the Cards or the
Bears.
Leopold's Mastery
Lefty Bob Leopold was again
the master of the situation as he
fanned seven and walked none in
scattering seven hits. If it is any
consolation for the Bears, they
did succeed in becoming the first
team to score an earned run off
the big sophomore in four con
ference outings.
Stanford broke a 1-1 deadlock
in the top of the eighth inning
with an electrifying squeeze bunt.
Fletcher had slashed a triple down
the left-field line to set the stage
tor coach Dutch Fehring's strate
gic move.
Then Shaw laid down the bunt,
and the speedy Fletcher scooted
home with the winner.
Cal opened scoring in its half
of the first when right fielder Bob
Puecinelli singled and scored on
catcher Charley Thompson's dou
ble.
The Cards evened the count in
the fourth by following suit. Right
fielder Rich DeFabio singled, and
third baseman Rudy Figueroa
belted a double to score him.
Cards Threaten Again
Stanford threatened again in
the sixth. With two out and Shaw j
on second, the Bears' ace, Doug
Weiss, gave an intentional pass
to Figueroa. Weiss then threw
to the Cards' slugging left fielder, j
Parker Olsen, who smashed a tre
mendous drive to deep center
field.
The Bears' Bernie Kelly was j
waiting in the distant reaches of
the park, and it was just a matter'
of a few backward steps to pull l
down the drive.
The Tribe will warm up for its
big week with a game tomorrow
against University of San Fran-
Cisco in Seals Stadium. Friday
the Trojans come to the Farm for
a single game, and Saturday it
will be the Bears and the Cards
in a double header on the Sunken
I )iamond.
