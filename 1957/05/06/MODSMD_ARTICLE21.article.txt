much - awaited mystery movie, "The Claw,"
which is produced and directed by students, will

on the program will be "The 1957 Olyympies,"
narrated by track coach Payton Jordan. The
flicks will be repeated Wednesday and Friday
evenings, same time and place.
One of the old standbys as far as thrilling
weekly activities goes is the 4 p.m. School of
Mineral Sciences Journal Club, which features
"Paleozoic Crinoid Reefs," a lecture by Dr. J. W.
Harbaugh in Room 320. All cavemen cordially

The big Con Home activity for Wednesday will
be the Strawberry Brunch in Union Court at 10
a.m. So gorge yourself-for charity.
Another old standby comes Wednesday after
noon at 4:15 in the action-packed seminar in
chemical engineering and applied chemistry. In
Room 20, Chemistry Building, Economics Pro

fessor Theodore J. Kreps will speak on "An
Economist Takes a Second Look at the Sulfuric
Acid Industry."
Come one, come jill, fans—this industry is cer
tainly worth a second look!

Thursday's charitable Con Home functions in
clude car-washing, working, playing tournament
finals and, best of all, getting asked for money
(both on and off campus).
But students will still have time to take in
the controversial physics department colloquium
at 4 p.m. in Room 372. At that time, Physics
Professor W. K. H. Panofsky will gracefully
lean on his lectern and begin a powerfully de
livered oration on "Experiments Concerning the
Conservation Laws in Weak Interactions."
Guests will be admitted free on presentation
of I.D.'s (interaction doctorals).
Few fans may be on the Sunken Diamond for
Friday's 3:15 p.m. .baseball crucial with USC.
Reason: the baseball bugs may all be mobbing
the Main Library's Bender Room for a lecture
by Lawrence Clark Powell, UCLA librarian, on
"Through the Burning Glass."
Time is 4 p.m. and the public is invited to
come and learn how to use their magnifying
glasses to torture ants.
Con Home Week will end on Friday with King
and Queen crowning at Mangini's Barn and
awarding of other assorted prizes.

In the Sunday night flick, at 7:30 in Mem Aud,
Frederic March and Gloria Graham will don
form-fit tights for "Man on a Tightrope."
