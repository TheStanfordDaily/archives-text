# Cal Surprises Frosh Spikers After Injuries
## 
### 
Bob Besse and Jim Backstrand
both broke the 200-foot barrier in
the javelin but their efforts could
not overcome a pair of pulled
muscles as the Stanford frosh
trackmen were upset, by Califor
nia Saturday, 69%-61%.
Besse cracked the meet record
of 200-3% as he hurled the spear
201 9. Backstrand was right be
hind with a flip of 200-V2. The
twin marks boosted the pair to
the forefront of frosh spearmen
in the United States.
Stanford lost the meet when
sprinter Norman Pease and Besse
each pulled muscles while run
ning. Pease came up lame at the
finish of the 100 after winning in
10.1. Besse suffered his injury in
the first 100 yards of the 440 and
failed to place.
As a result of the muscle pulls,
Pease couldn't run in the 220 and
the Tribe was shut out. Neither
lie nor Besse could compete in the
relay, so Cal coasted to victory in
the meet's deciding event.
All told, the injuries cost the
Papooses a probable total of at
least 13 pointsâ€”more than enough
to have won the meet.
John Kelly was high-point man
in the losing cause as he won the
broad jump and ran second in
both the low hurdles and the 100.
Bob M on z in go contributed 10
points to the Stanford cause with
double triumphs in the mile and
the two-mile.
Other Stanford victories came
from Royal Moore in the shot-put,
Tom Lagerquist in the discus,
Dean Smith in the lows and Paul
Gillespie, Marion Keyes and Nor
man Pincock. all of whom tied for
first in the high jump.
