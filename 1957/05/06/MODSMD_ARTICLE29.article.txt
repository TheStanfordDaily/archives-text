# Netmen in Most Decisive Win Over Cal Since May 28,1949
## Stanford Drops Only Three Sets in 8-1 Victory; Freshman Netters Overpower Bearcubs, 6-3 
### Dave Canfield 
Scoring their most decisive win over California since May 28, 1949,
when they won, 9-0, Bob Renker's highly inspired tennis players
wiped out the Bears here Saturday, 8-1.
The Indians dropped only three sets during the nine matches as
they left little doubt about the the outcome. To annex their one win

the Cal racquetmen had to load
the deck and throw their second
best player — bullet-serving Don
Pimley—against Dave Nelson in
fourth singles.
Pimley barely squeezed out a
6-4, 2-6, 8-6 victory in the day's
most exciting match.
Stanford's Jack Douglas, in first
singles, was not extended by
Lorin Dennison as the Santa Mon
ica star mercilessly pounded Ihe
Cal player's backhand for an easy
6-3, 6-3 win.
Rawlins Is Hdt -
Brooks Rawlins also showed top
form in second singles. Playing
veteran Bear racqueteer Larry
Axtell, Rawlins was in the driv
er's seat all the way as his bril
liant passing shots and unerring
placements carried him to a well
deserved 6-2, 6-3 triumph.
In third singles, Gil White sped
to a 4-1 lead in the opening set
and toppled Gulden Lloyd, 6-3, 3-3,
default.
Lowell Carruth was hard press
ed all the way by Charles Raymer
in fifth singles as the Fresno soph
omore squeezed out a 6-4, 10-8
win under the near-90-degree sun.
Bob Bowden ran away with the
sixth singles match, slaughtering
lanky Clay Bradley in a 6-3, 6-2
rout.
Never Belter
In first doubles, Douglas and
Nelson were never better as they
made Pimley-Dennison, both fine
players, look like a couple of dubs
in their 6-3, 6-2 victory. The score
was tied at 1.-1, 2-2 arid 3-3 in the
initial set.
Second doubles was no contest
either. Rawlins-White of Stanford
chopped down Bradley-Axtell in
two quick sets, 6-3, 6-4. Playing
their first intercollegiate tennis
match together, Stanford's third
doubles team of Dick Gould and
Ed. West started and finished
strong to hammer out a difficult
6-1, 6-8, 6-1 win over Raymer
Jackson.
In the preliminary, Stanford's
freshmen topped the Bearcub net
men, 6-3.
