## 
### Anne Johnson 
A political reporter for the As
sociated Press of Pakistan said
last week that the Kashmir prob
lem was a matter of life or death
for Pakistan. Safdar Ali Qureshi
visited Stanford's campus as
part of a nationwide leadership
exchange tour.
He said the Pakistani people
are so excited and worried over
recent developments in Kashmir
that some can see no other way
out than war.
Kashmir is the strip of land
between Pakistan and India
which India claims and has ta
ken steps to annex. Pakistan
wants the country's future to be
decided legally by a plebiscite,
according to Qureshi. He
stressed the fact that his country
does not want to take over Kash
mir but simply wants an inde
pendent friendly government set
up in the state.
Rivers from Kashmir
Qureshi explained that most of
Pakistan's rivers flow from
Kashmir, and India has started
to divert their flow. This has
made us run short of food and
has forced us to take loans, he
said.
He said his country was quite
happy about the interest in the
problem shown by the United
States. The U.S. has announced
in the United Nations that it fa
vors a plebiscite in Kashmir.
The newspaperman proudly
commented that Pakistan has
raised its literacy 10 per cent
since the country gained its inde
pendence in 1947.
Thirty per cent of the popula

tion are now literate. Pakistan
suffers from the lack of schools
and teachers, Qureshi said. "Our
plea is give us more schools,
more teachers."
However, Pakistan's standards
of living are much better than
neighboring countries, he said.
Communism is almost a dead
issue in Pakistan, according to
Qureshi. The Communist party
has been banned for some time
and only a few "progressives"
remain, he commented.
Against Communism
"Our country has been very
consistent in its policy against
Communism," Qureshi said.
His news agency, the Associat
ed Press of Pakistan, serves 40
newspapers in Pakistan. Qure
shi has been studying all aspects
of the American way of life
while on his tour. He said, how
ever, he had also taken time to
acquaint himself with the proc
esses and plants of U.S. news
papers.
