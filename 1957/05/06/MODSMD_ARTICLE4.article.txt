# Bears Upset Indians, 72-59, In Track Meet
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Come-through performances by
half the Stanford track team could
not offsel lackluster showings by
the other half and seasonal bests
by a host of Berkeley Bears as
California downed the Indians, 72-
59, in the 62nd annual Big Meet
Saturday at Berkeley.
Miko Franchetti, Chuck Cobb,
Frank Herrmann, Fred Peters,
Hank Roldan and Phil Fehlen all
scored victories for the Tribe. But
they couldn't stem the tide of Cal

His winning high-hurdle clocking

hitting a career best of 23.7.
Herrmann displayed all the
leadership a co-captain is suppos

jump, took second in the 100 and
ran I bird in I he 220.
His best performance was in the
100, where he gained two yards
on CaJ's Hank Olguin in the last
10 yards to rapture the place po
sition in 0.8, his hesl official time
of the year. Herrmann's 220 clock-
