# Bears Upset Indians, 72-59, In Track Meet
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Come-through performances by
half the Stanford track team could
not offsel lackluster showings by
the other half and seasonal bests
by a host of Berkeley Bears as
California downed the Indians, 72-
59, in the 62nd annual Big Meet
Saturday at Berkeley.
Miko Franchetti, Chuck Cobb,
Frank Herrmann, Fred Peters,
Hank Roldan and Phil Fehlen all
scored victories for the Tribe. But
they couldn't stem the tide of Cal
men who got firsts where they
were supposed to get seconds, and
seconds where they were flue to
get thirds.
Franchetti came up with his all
time best: performance as he won
the pole vault at 13-4. Pole-vault
ers are supposed to be over six
feet tall, to have lots of spring
and to be fast. Franchetti instead
is quite short and has little natu
ral vaulting ability.
But he ciid more with what he
has than do many vaulters of na
tional ranking and nearly negoti
ated 13-8 in his continuing string
of ever-improving performances.
Only Double Winner
Cobb was 1 he only double win
ner of the day for Stanford as he
took first in both hurdle races.
His winning high-hurdle clocking
was a slow 1 1.7, but he came back
to capture the lows in a fairly
good 23.4. Len Bates was a sur
prising second in the latter race,
hitting a career best of 23.7.
Herrmann displayed all the
leadership a co-captain is suppos
ed to have as lie won the broad
jump, took second in the 100 and
ran I bird in I he 220.
His best performance was in the
100, where he gained two yards
on CaJ's Hank Olguin in the last
10 yards to rapture the place po
sition in 0.8, his hesl official time
of the year. Herrmann's 220 clock-
ing of 21.5 was also his best show
ing in several meets.
Peters and Roldan each showed
their usual consistency in the
throwing events, Peters was the
Jone meet record-breaker for Stan
ford, flipping the discus 170-8—
over eight feet better than the
18-year-old meet mark.
Miserable Facilities
Holdan, although hampered by
miserable javelin-throwing facili
ties. nevertheless won the event
at 224-11.
In the high jump Fehlen beat
out the sore-ankled Dick Dailey
of California, clearing 6-7. Ron
Bondoc, who was expected to take
second or third for Stanford, was
bothered by a headache and was
withdrawn from the event.
Art Stewart led the come
throughs for California. He took
uj) the slack when teammate Stu
art Gould was scratched from the
440 due to illness, and handily
whipped Don Chesarek in a good
47.8. Stewart returned to take a
surprise second in the 220 with a
sharp 21.3.
Cal's two double winners, as ex
pected, were Don Bowden and
Leamon King, and both looked
impressive in collecting their 10
points.
Easy Win
Bowden breezed to an easy win
in the mile as he hit the tape in
4:09.9.
lie returned shortly after to
take a wire-to-wire victory in the
XBO. I lis 1:50.0 effort, coupled with
Ihe earlier mile win, put him in
the record books with the second
fastest double ever accomplished
in track history.
King loafed to a 9.7 100-yard
dash victory in the meet's third
event, then returned to sprint the
220 in 20.9, his best-ever non-wind
clocking.
Their dual and triangular sen
son now over, the Indians next
prepare for Saturday's Fresno Re
lays. The PCC championships will
be held May 17-I.S at Eugene, Ore.

Come-through performances by
half the Stanford track team could
not offsel lackluster showings by
the other half and seasonal bests
by a host of Berkeley Bears as
California downed the Indians, 72-
59, in the 62nd annual Big Meet
Saturday at Berkeley.
Miko Franchetti, Chuck Cobb,
Frank Herrmann, Fred Peters,
Hank Roldan and Phil Fehlen all
scored victories for the Tribe. But
they couldn't stem the tide of Cal
men who got firsts where they
were supposed to get seconds, and
seconds where they were flue to
get thirds.
Franchetti came up with his all
time best: performance as he won
the pole vault at 13-4. Pole-vault
ers are supposed to be over six
feet tall, to have lots of spring
and to be fast. Franchetti instead
is quite short and has little natu
ral vaulting ability.
But he ciid more with what he
has than do many vaulters of na
tional ranking and nearly negoti
ated 13-8 in his continuing string
of ever-improving performances.
Only Double Winner
Cobb was 1 he only double win
ner of the day for Stanford as he
took first in both hurdle races.
His winning high-hurdle clocking
was a slow 1 1.7, but he came back
to capture the lows in a fairly
good 23.4. Len Bates was a sur
prising second in the latter race,
hitting a career best of 23.7.
Herrmann displayed all the
leadership a co-captain is suppos
ed to have as lie won the broad
jump, took second in the 100 and
ran I bird in I he 220.
His best performance was in the
100, where he gained two yards
on CaJ's Hank Olguin in the last
10 yards to rapture the place po
sition in 0.8, his hesl official time
of the year. Herrmann's 220 clock-
ing of 21.5 was also his best show
ing in several meets.
Peters and Roldan each showed
their usual consistency in the
throwing events, Peters was the
Jone meet record-breaker for Stan
ford, flipping the discus 170-8—
over eight feet better than the
18-year-old meet mark.
Miserable Facilities
Holdan, although hampered by
miserable javelin-throwing facili
ties. nevertheless won the event
at 224-11.
In the high jump Fehlen beat
out the sore-ankled Dick Dailey
of California, clearing 6-7. Ron
Bondoc, who was expected to take
second or third for Stanford, was
bothered by a headache and was
withdrawn from the event.
Art Stewart led the come
throughs for California. He took
uj) the slack when teammate Stu
art Gould was scratched from the
440 due to illness, and handily
whipped Don Chesarek in a good
47.8. Stewart returned to take a
surprise second in the 220 with a
sharp 21.3.
Cal's two double winners, as ex
pected, were Don Bowden and
Leamon King, and both looked
impressive in collecting their 10
points.
Easy Win
Bowden breezed to an easy win
in the mile as he hit the tape in
4:09.9.
lie returned shortly after to
take a wire-to-wire victory in the
XBO. I lis 1:50.0 effort, coupled with
Ihe earlier mile win, put him in
the record books with the second
fastest double ever accomplished
in track history.

men who got firsts where they
were supposed to get seconds, and
seconds where they were flue to
get thirds.
Franchetti came up with his all
time best: performance as he won
the pole vault at 13-4. Pole-vault
ers are supposed to be over six
feet tall, to have lots of spring
and to be fast. Franchetti instead
is quite short and has little natu
ral vaulting ability.
But he ciid more with what he
has than do many vaulters of na
tional ranking and nearly negoti
ated 13-8 in his continuing string
of ever-improving performances.
Only Double Winner
Cobb was 1 he only double win
ner of the day for Stanford as he
took first in both hurdle races.
His winning high-hurdle clocking
was a slow 1 1.7, but he came back
to capture the lows in a fairly
good 23.4. Len Bates was a sur
prising second in the latter race,
hitting a career best of 23.7.
Herrmann displayed all the
leadership a co-captain is suppos
ed to have as lie won the broad
jump, took second in the 100 and
ran I bird in I he 220.
His best performance was in the
100, where he gained two yards
on CaJ's Hank Olguin in the last
10 yards to rapture the place po
sition in 0.8, his hesl official time
of the year. Herrmann's 220 clock-
ing of 21.5 was also his best show
ing in several meets.
Peters and Roldan each showed
their usual consistency in the
throwing events, Peters was the
Jone meet record-breaker for Stan
ford, flipping the discus 170-8—
over eight feet better than the
18-year-old meet mark.
Miserable Facilities
Holdan, although hampered by
miserable javelin-throwing facili
ties. nevertheless won the event
at 224-11.
In the high jump Fehlen beat
out the sore-ankled Dick Dailey
of California, clearing 6-7. Ron
Bondoc, who was expected to take
second or third for Stanford, was
bothered by a headache and was
withdrawn from the event.
Art Stewart led the come
throughs for California. He took
uj) the slack when teammate Stu
art Gould was scratched from the
440 due to illness, and handily
whipped Don Chesarek in a good
47.8. Stewart returned to take a
surprise second in the 220 with a
sharp 21.3.
Cal's two double winners, as ex
pected, were Don Bowden and
Leamon King, and both looked
impressive in collecting their 10
points.
Easy Win
Bowden breezed to an easy win
in the mile as he hit the tape in
4:09.9.
lie returned shortly after to
take a wire-to-wire victory in the
XBO. I lis 1:50.0 effort, coupled with
Ihe earlier mile win, put him in
the record books with the second
fastest double ever accomplished
in track history.
King loafed to a 9.7 100-yard
dash victory in the meet's third
event, then returned to sprint the
220 in 20.9, his best-ever non-wind
clocking.
Their dual and triangular sen

Come-through performances by
half the Stanford track team could
not offsel lackluster showings by
the other half and seasonal bests
by a host of Berkeley Bears as
California downed the Indians, 72-
59, in the 62nd annual Big Meet
Saturday at Berkeley.
Miko Franchetti, Chuck Cobb,
Frank Herrmann, Fred Peters,
Hank Roldan and Phil Fehlen all
scored victories for the Tribe. But
they couldn't stem the tide of Cal
men who got firsts where they
were supposed to get seconds, and
seconds where they were flue to
get thirds.
Franchetti came up with his all
time best: performance as he won
the pole vault at 13-4. Pole-vault
ers are supposed to be over six
feet tall, to have lots of spring
and to be fast. Franchetti instead
is quite short and has little natu
ral vaulting ability.
But he ciid more with what he
has than do many vaulters of na
tional ranking and nearly negoti
ated 13-8 in his continuing string
of ever-improving performances.
Only Double Winner
Cobb was 1 he only double win
ner of the day for Stanford as he
took first in both hurdle races.
His winning high-hurdle clocking
was a slow 1 1.7, but he came back
to capture the lows in a fairly
good 23.4. Len Bates was a sur
prising second in the latter race,
hitting a career best of 23.7.
Herrmann displayed all the
leadership a co-captain is suppos
ed to have as lie won the broad
jump, took second in the 100 and
ran I bird in I he 220.
His best performance was in the
100, where he gained two yards
on CaJ's Hank Olguin in the last
10 yards to rapture the place po
sition in 0.8, his hesl official time
of the year. Herrmann's 220 clock-
ing of 21.5 was also his best show
ing in several meets.
Peters and Roldan each showed
their usual consistency in the
throwing events, Peters was the
Jone meet record-breaker for Stan
ford, flipping the discus 170-8—
over eight feet better than the
18-year-old meet mark.
Miserable Facilities
Holdan, although hampered by
miserable javelin-throwing facili
ties. nevertheless won the event
at 224-11.
In the high jump Fehlen beat
out the sore-ankled Dick Dailey
of California, clearing 6-7. Ron
Bondoc, who was expected to take
second or third for Stanford, was
bothered by a headache and was
withdrawn from the event.
Art Stewart led the come
throughs for California. He took
uj) the slack when teammate Stu
art Gould was scratched from the
440 due to illness, and handily
whipped Don Chesarek in a good
47.8. Stewart returned to take a
surprise second in the 220 with a
sharp 21.3.
Cal's two double winners, as ex
pected, were Don Bowden and
Leamon King, and both looked
impressive in collecting their 10
points.
Easy Win
Bowden breezed to an easy win
in the mile as he hit the tape in
4:09.9.
lie returned shortly after to
take a wire-to-wire victory in the
XBO. I lis 1:50.0 effort, coupled with
Ihe earlier mile win, put him in
the record books with the second
fastest double ever accomplished
in track history.
King loafed to a 9.7 100-yard
dash victory in the meet's third
event, then returned to sprint the
220 in 20.9, his best-ever non-wind
clocking.
Their dual and triangular sen
son now over, the Indians next
prepare for Saturday's Fresno Re
lays. The PCC championships will
be held May 17-I.S at Eugene, Ore.
