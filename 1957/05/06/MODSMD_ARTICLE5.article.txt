# Hectic Crew Race Ends in SU Victory, Not Drowning
## 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
After fighting their way
through two near - swampings,
S t a n f o r d's varsity oarsmen
emerged to power to a 2%-length
victory over California to defeat
the Bears for the third straight
year in what will undoubtedly
go down in crew annals as the
most hectic "Big Row" in his
tory.
During the No. 2 varsity race
a fire broke out in one of the
drydocks on the Alameda side of
the Oakland Estuary. The Coast
Guard and fireboats went to the
scene, leaving the race site un
protected from the normal Sat
urday afternoon traffic, consist
ing of tugs, sailboats and water
skiers towed by speedboats.
Once things quieted down, ref
eree Dean Witter started the

race. Stanford got under way
with a fast 38 stroke; Cal used
35. After the start, both shells
settled dawn to a steady 33
count.
Things went fairly smooth for
the first half-mile. Neither shell
could gain an advantage of more
than a few feet as the lead
changed hands repeatedly.
But at the half-mile mark, a
pleasure craft cut through the
course, sending heavy swells to
ward the fragile shells. Witter
warned both boats, but he could
do little more.
The swell hit the Cal shell
first and appeared to completely
stop its forward progress for - a
brief moment. The Cards rode
out the swell "fairly well," and
when the spray had cleared, the
Indians were a full length ahead
of the Bears.

Stanford continued using a
low 29-stroke while Cal recov
ered with a 30-stroke. At about
the end of the first mile the
Cards added a s-troke and the
Bears dropped back to 29.
The Cal strategy seemed to be
working, for the Bear shell grad
ually began to close the gap to
within a half-length of the Stan
ford boat.
When the shells reached the
halfway point in the race one
of the fireboat,s left the dock
fire, crossed in front of the boats
and headed down the Oakland
side of the estuary, sending tre
in en d o us swells' toward the
shells.
California coach Ky Ebright
screamed at the fireboat to stop,
but they didn't cut their engines
until it was too late.
Again Witter warned the

shells, and again Cal caught it
first. Bear frosh coach Jim Lem
mon, watching from shore, said:
"Both boats seemed to disappear.
I really didn't expect either of
them to come through it."
Moments after it hit the Cal
shell, the "tidal wave" reached
the Indians. Water broke clear
over the heads of coxswain Ran
dy Jones, bow Ron Rose and
No. 2 man John Reichmann.
"Considerable water poured
into the shell," said Roald Enge
breth, who was in the No. 4 posi
tion. "First we went way up
and then down the other side of
the swell. It was at least five
feet high and by far the biggest
swell I've ever seen while row
ing. We came within inches of
sinking."
After the race was over, Nate

Topol, oarsman in the No. 3 slot
for Stanford, swore that the
shell buckled at the No. 4 posi
tion (the middle of the boat).
Laden with water, both shells
struggled toward the finish line,
still l'/a miles away. The Cards
gradually pulled away, using a
higher 31- to 33-stroke the re
mainder of the race. Cal con
tinued to use a slow 29- to 31-
stroke, finishing 2\'-i lengths be
hind the Indians.
The Cards' winning time was
an understandably slow 16:05
over the hazardous three - mile
course. Cal finished 10 seconds
later.
Aside from the varsity race,
however, the Big Row was all
Cal. They won the freshman
and the No. 2 varsity shell races,
held prior to the regatta between

the two schools' No. 1 shells.
California's freshman eight
showed remarkable power by
rowing away from the Papooses
for a 7'4-length victory. The
Bear Cubs' time was 10:11 over
the two-mile course, compared
with 10:41 for the Card frosh.
Stanford's No. 2 varsity boat
lost by three lengths to their
Bear opponents. Both shells,
however, turned in better times
over the three-mile course than
did the No. 1 varsity boats. The
winning Cal time was 15:39;
Stanford finished in 15:52.
Friday afternoon Stanford's
No. 2 frosh boat and the No. .'i
varsity shell also lost to their
Bear counterparts. The second
frosh boat trailed by 5 1 - lengths.
The third varsity shell lost by
2Va lengths.

within a half-length of the Stan
ford boat.
When the shells reached the
halfway point in the race one
of the fireboat,s left the dock
fire, crossed in front of the boats
and headed down the Oakland
side of the estuary, sending tre
in en d o us swells' toward the
shells.
California coach Ky Ebright
screamed at the fireboat to stop,
but they didn't cut their engines
until it was too late.
Again Witter warned the

shells, and again Cal caught it
first. Bear frosh coach Jim Lem
mon, watching from shore, said:
"Both boats seemed to disappear.
I really didn't expect either of
them to come through it."
Moments after it hit the Cal
shell, the "tidal wave" reached
the Indians. Water broke clear
over the heads of coxswain Ran
dy Jones, bow Ron Rose and
No. 2 man John Reichmann.
"Considerable water poured
into the shell," said Roald Enge
breth, who was in the No. 4 posi
tion. "First we went way up
and then down the other side of
the swell. It was at least five
feet high and by far the biggest
swell I've ever seen while row
ing. We came within inches of
sinking."
After the race was over, Nate

Topol, oarsman in the No. 3 slot
for Stanford, swore that the
shell buckled at the No. 4 posi
tion (the middle of the boat).
Laden with water, both shells
struggled toward the finish line,
still l'/a miles away. The Cards
gradually pulled away, using a
higher 31- to 33-stroke the re
mainder of the race. Cal con
tinued to use a slow 29- to 31-
stroke, finishing 2\'-i lengths be
hind the Indians.
The Cards' winning time was
an understandably slow 16:05
over the hazardous three - mile
course. Cal finished 10 seconds
later.
Aside from the varsity race,
however, the Big Row was all
Cal. They won the freshman
and the No. 2 varsity shell races,
held prior to the regatta between

the two schools' No. 1 shells.
California's freshman eight
showed remarkable power by
rowing away from the Papooses
for a 7'4-length victory. The
Bear Cubs' time was 10:11 over
the two-mile course, compared
with 10:41 for the Card frosh.
Stanford's No. 2 varsity boat
lost by three lengths to their
Bear opponents. Both shells,
however, turned in better times
over the three-mile course than
did the No. 1 varsity boats. The
winning Cal time was 15:39;
Stanford finished in 15:52.
Friday afternoon Stanford's
No. 2 frosh boat and the No. .'i
varsity shell also lost to their
Bear counterparts. The second
frosh boat trailed by 5 1 - lengths.
The third varsity shell lost by
2Va lengths.
After fighting their way
through two near - swampings,
S t a n f o r d's varsity oarsmen
emerged to power to a 2%-length
victory over California to defeat
the Bears for the third straight
year in what will undoubtedly
go down in crew annals as the
most hectic "Big Row" in his
tory.
During the No. 2 varsity race
a fire broke out in one of the
drydocks on the Alameda side of
the Oakland Estuary. The Coast
Guard and fireboats went to the
scene, leaving the race site un
protected from the normal Sat
urday afternoon traffic, consist
ing of tugs, sailboats and water
skiers towed by speedboats.
Once things quieted down, ref
eree Dean Witter started the

race. Stanford got under way
with a fast 38 stroke; Cal used
35. After the start, both shells
settled dawn to a steady 33
count.
Things went fairly smooth for
the first half-mile. Neither shell
could gain an advantage of more
than a few feet as the lead
changed hands repeatedly.
But at the half-mile mark, a
pleasure craft cut through the
course, sending heavy swells to
ward the fragile shells. Witter
warned both boats, but he could
do little more.
The swell hit the Cal shell
first and appeared to completely
stop its forward progress for - a
brief moment. The Cards rode
out the swell "fairly well," and
when the spray had cleared, the
Indians were a full length ahead
of the Bears.

Stanford continued using a
low 29-stroke while Cal recov
ered with a 30-stroke. At about
the end of the first mile the
Cards added a s-troke and the
Bears dropped back to 29.

over the hazardous three - mile
course. Cal finished 10 seconds
later.
Aside from the varsity race,
however, the Big Row was all
Cal. They won the freshman
and the No. 2 varsity shell races,
held prior to the regatta between

the two schools' No. 1 shells.
California's freshman eight
showed remarkable power by
rowing away from the Papooses
for a 7'4-length victory. The
Bear Cubs' time was 10:11 over
the two-mile course, compared
with 10:41 for the Card frosh.
Stanford's No. 2 varsity boat
lost by three lengths to their
Bear opponents. Both shells,
however, turned in better times
over the three-mile course than
did the No. 1 varsity boats. The
winning Cal time was 15:39;
Stanford finished in 15:52.
Friday afternoon Stanford's
No. 2 frosh boat and the No. .'i
varsity shell also lost to their
Bear counterparts. The second
frosh boat trailed by 5 1 - lengths.
The third varsity shell lost by
2Va lengths.
After fighting their way
through two near - swampings,
S t a n f o r d's varsity oarsmen
emerged to power to a 2%-length
victory over California to defeat
the Bears for the third straight
year in what will undoubtedly
go down in crew annals as the
most hectic "Big Row" in his
tory.
During the No. 2 varsity race
a fire broke out in one of the
drydocks on the Alameda side of
the Oakland Estuary. The Coast
Guard and fireboats went to the
scene, leaving the race site un
protected from the normal Sat
urday afternoon traffic, consist
ing of tugs, sailboats and water
skiers towed by speedboats.
Once things quieted down, ref
eree Dean Witter started the

race. Stanford got under way
with a fast 38 stroke; Cal used
35. After the start, both shells
settled dawn to a steady 33
count.
Things went fairly smooth for
the first half-mile. Neither shell
could gain an advantage of more
than a few feet as the lead
changed hands repeatedly.
But at the half-mile mark, a
pleasure craft cut through the
course, sending heavy swells to
ward the fragile shells. Witter
warned both boats, but he could
do little more.
The swell hit the Cal shell
first and appeared to completely
stop its forward progress for - a
brief moment. The Cards rode
out the swell "fairly well," and
when the spray had cleared, the
Indians were a full length ahead
of the Bears.

Stanford continued using a
low 29-stroke while Cal recov
ered with a 30-stroke. At about
the end of the first mile the
Cards added a s-troke and the
Bears dropped back to 29.
The Cal strategy seemed to be
working, for the Bear shell grad
ually began to close the gap to
within a half-length of the Stan
ford boat.
When the shells reached the
halfway point in the race one
of the fireboat,s left the dock
fire, crossed in front of the boats
and headed down the Oakland
side of the estuary, sending tre
in en d o us swells' toward the
shells.
California coach Ky Ebright
screamed at the fireboat to stop,
but they didn't cut their engines
until it was too late.
Again Witter warned the

shells, and again Cal caught it
first. Bear frosh coach Jim Lem
mon, watching from shore, said:
"Both boats seemed to disappear.
I really didn't expect either of
them to come through it."
Moments after it hit the Cal
shell, the "tidal wave" reached
the Indians. Water broke clear
over the heads of coxswain Ran
dy Jones, bow Ron Rose and
No. 2 man John Reichmann.
"Considerable water poured
into the shell," said Roald Enge
breth, who was in the No. 4 posi
tion. "First we went way up
and then down the other side of
the swell. It was at least five
feet high and by far the biggest
swell I've ever seen while row
ing. We came within inches of
sinking."
After the race was over, Nate

Topol, oarsman in the No. 3 slot
for Stanford, swore that the
shell buckled at the No. 4 posi
tion (the middle of the boat).
Laden with water, both shells
struggled toward the finish line,
still l'/a miles away. The Cards
gradually pulled away, using a
higher 31- to 33-stroke the re
mainder of the race. Cal con
tinued to use a slow 29- to 31-
stroke, finishing 2\'-i lengths be
hind the Indians.
