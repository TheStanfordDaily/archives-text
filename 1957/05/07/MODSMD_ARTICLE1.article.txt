# Russian Ex-Premier Does Research in Hoover Libe
## Kerensky Uses SU Books in Writing Of Russia's Provisional Government 
### Bruce Smith 
The story of Alexander Kerensky is to a great extent the story of
the Russian Provisional Government. He gained worldwide fame as
premier of the Provisional Government and vanished from the pages
of history when it fell.
Kerensky came to Stanford because he wanted to write a book

on the revolution "for the young
people of Russia that they might
know truth some day."
He was a member of the first
cabinet formed to run the Pro
visional Government after the
downfall of the Czar; and he was
a member of all the many cabi
nets that followed, becoming pre
mier in July, IT>l7, and holding
that post, until the Bolshevik
revolution in November.
And when he fell from power
the only democratic regime Rus
sia has ever known went with
him.
"People lose control of them
selves in a revolution," he said
sadly. "Emotions run too high."
Stirs Audience
Even at 76 Kerensky has the
power to stir an audience. One
can only guess what an orator
he must have been 40 years ago.
He is a flaming idealist who still
feels deeply and intensely for the
people of Russia.
Kerensky was born in the
town of Simbirsk, on the Volga
River. His father was an educa
tor, and was later made head of
all education in Russian Turkes
tan. It is interesting to note that
Lenin's father was then head of
elementary education in Turkes
tan.
Kerensky studied law at what
is now the University of Lenin
grad. It was here, he said, that
he absorbed his liberal ideals.
College students of his day were
very liberal and politically ac
tive.
Elected to Duma
He was elected to the Duma,
which was a representative as
sembly with limited powers, as
a member of the Toilers' Group,
a peasant party closely allied
with the Social Revolutionaries
who eventually became domi
nant. From the Duma he went
to the Provisional Government.
After the Bolsheviks took over
he was involved for a while in
the Russian Civil War.
Hoover Library, he said, has
documents and information on
the Russian revolution that are
"unique outside of Russia."
At the request of the Library,
however, Kerensky agreed to
postpone his own book and write
instead a comprehensive work on
the rise and fall of the Provision
al Government, for publication
in 1958. Then, he hopes, he can
resume work on his own book.
