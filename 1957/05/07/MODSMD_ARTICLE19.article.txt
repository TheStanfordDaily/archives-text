# The 						Sponsor Program
## 
### 
About a month ago the women's Sponsor
Choosing Committee sent out a rail for in
terested women lo try on I lor the job of help
ing to guide the incoming freshman women.
Some place along the way Stanford students
forgot to be apathetic. In response lo their
plea, the committee received 130 qualified ap
plications.
The problem then was no longer how to stir
up interest among the supposedly, nnenthusi
astic students, but rather how to decide which
29 women of those who applied would be best
suited for the job. Such decisions must have
been near to impossible, but at least less im
possible than having to select next year's spon
sors 4'rom a limited number of applications.
Whether this show of sincere interest in
Stanford and its future is a tribute to the ex
cellence of the sponsor system itself, or lo the
Sponsor Choosing Committee for their efforts
to contact all interested women, or lo each of
the 130 applicants is hard lo determine. At
any rale, ihe committee and the applicants
deserve a "(bank you. 1 '
The system deserves a note of explanation.
I he new program which was put into effect
this year is set up so that both sponsors and
sponsor officers are chosen at ihe same lime.

One sponsor is assigned lo each corridor, and
her major concern is with ihe activities and
problems of that group. Along with these
sponsors, four women are selected for each of
the freshman dormitories lo acl as officers of
the dorm. I heir principal interesl is I lie dor
mitory as a whole.
Because of 111 is system, both the individual
freshman women and ihe over-all workings of
the dormitory gel as much attention as pos
sible.
The attitude of ihe choosing committee is
another good 112 eature of I lie system. Among ihe
things they were anxious lo explain lo the
women who applied for sponsorship is that
there is no such thing as a "sponsor-type."
Since there is hound lo lie a variety of per
sonalities and interests among tlie incoming
freshmen, the committee concluded lliat there
must also be variety among the chosen sponsors.
The only characteristics which the commit
lee recommended that all applicants have in
common were a willingness to devote time to
the job and a desire lo work with freshmen
and directors.
If 130 women can lie described as "willing to
devote time" and "having a desire lo work,"
thai old word "apathy " is on its way lo becom
ing a legend around Stanford University.

terested women lo try on I lor the job of help
ing to guide the incoming freshman women.
Some place along the way Stanford students
forgot to be apathetic. In response lo their
plea, the committee received 130 qualified ap
plications.
The problem then was no longer how to stir
up interest among the supposedly, nnenthusi
astic students, but rather how to decide which
29 women of those who applied would be best
suited for the job. Such decisions must have
been near to impossible, but at least less im
possible than having to select next year's spon
sors 4'rom a limited number of applications.
Whether this show of sincere interest in
Stanford and its future is a tribute to the ex
cellence of the sponsor system itself, or lo the
Sponsor Choosing Committee for their efforts
to contact all interested women, or lo each of
the 130 applicants is hard lo determine. At
any rale, ihe committee and the applicants
deserve a "(bank you. 1 '
The system deserves a note of explanation.
I he new program which was put into effect
this year is set up so that both sponsors and
sponsor officers are chosen at ihe same lime.

One sponsor is assigned lo each corridor, and
her major concern is with ihe activities and
problems of that group. Along with these
sponsors, four women are selected for each of
the freshman dormitories lo acl as officers of
the dorm. I heir principal interesl is I lie dor
mitory as a whole.
Because of 111 is system, both the individual
freshman women and ihe over-all workings of
the dormitory gel as much attention as pos
sible.
The attitude of ihe choosing committee is
another good 112 eature of I lie system. Among ihe
things they were anxious lo explain lo the
women who applied for sponsorship is that
there is no such thing as a "sponsor-type."
Since there is hound lo lie a variety of per
sonalities and interests among tlie incoming
freshmen, the committee concluded lliat there
must also be variety among the chosen sponsors.
The only characteristics which the commit
lee recommended that all applicants have in
common were a willingness to devote time to
the job and a desire lo work with freshmen
and directors.
If 130 women can lie described as "willing to
devote time" and "having a desire lo work,"
thai old word "apathy " is on its way lo becom
ing a legend around Stanford University.
About a month ago the women's Sponsor
Choosing Committee sent out a rail for in
terested women lo try on I lor the job of help
ing to guide the incoming freshman women.
