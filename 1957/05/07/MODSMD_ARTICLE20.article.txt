## Tribune's College Ratings Cause Controversy 
### Dave Canfield 
The University or California is "one ol the
wonders of the educational world," according to
a story appearing in the April 28 Chicago Sun
day Tribune.
This article followed up the Tribune's "10
most-eminent universities" survey which "The
World's Greatest Newspaper" published in its
April 21 edilion. (Cal was ranked third, Stan
ford 10th.)
Ranking the Berkeley institution among aca
demic "wonders" is its selective admissions pol
icy and its outstanding faculty, veteran Tribune
writer Chesly Manly said. He noted that only
12 per cent of California's high school graduates
are eligible for admission to the university.
Manly also included the University of Califor
nia library as among its "wonders."
« * *
Meanwhile, like some Stanford students, un
dergraduates at Norlhwestern, which was un
rated, apparently feel their university got
"burnt" in the survey.
As an embittered editorial in the Daily North
western said, "The Chicago Tribune, which has
had dubious success in rating the world's great
est newspapers, has now turned its attention to
universities. . . .
"The Tribune article was far from adequate.
Besides being highly subjective, it was based al
most entirely on the liberal arts and graduate
schools of the respective colleges and universi
ties."
The editorial went on to say that equal impor

tanee must bo given specialized schools such as
speech and journalism and technical schools.
"We feel," said the Daily Northwestern, "that
Iho survey, while advertising tlie top 10 univer
sities, has done a lot of harm to those not listed.
There are many schools, I'ke Northwestern,
which certainly deserve to he included on any
list of great American universities.
'Vet the exclusion of these schools may dam
age them materially."
Any 10 surveys will come up with 10 different:
"eminents," the editorial concluded.
to *
Meanwhile, at Yale, which was rated second
most "eminent" by the Trib, 15 students have
been charged with the possession and use of ex
plosives, a crime under Connecticut law.
The action taken by Yale campus police re
sulted from a 10-day outbreak of hooliganism.
Highlights of 1 his spree were the throwing of
explosives from a temporarily unoccupied dor
mitory room into the street and the starting of
a fire by a "cherry bomb" firecracker.
In all, seven incidents have occurred. One
freshman has received suspension and three oth
er students are up for hearings.
