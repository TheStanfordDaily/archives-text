# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## Review of Bookstore Policies 
### Bob Freelen 
Editor's Note: The Daily lias asked AKSII President Boh Free
leu to explain why lie leelsjhe Bookstore setup is inade(|iiate and
what proposals he has made for its revision. This is the first of
a two-part series hv Freelen, the conrludiiiK column appearing in
tomorrow's (taper.
Not long ago I asked llie Bookstore Board of Directors, in a
memorandum lo Dr. George S. Parks, chairman, to consider the
following: (1) the tax status of the Bookstore if it were a part of
the University; (2) reorganization under the University; (3) sub-

mitting its findings to the Board
of Governors and the Board of
Trustees.
The prevailing opinion held by
several members of the Board of
Governors is that the present
system is "satisfactory." How
ever, I am convinced that a re
view of Bookstore policies is
long over&ue.
I made the above requests for
several reasons. First, the board
seems to feel that the present co
operative is preferable to union
with the University, although
the advantages of such a union
might be substantial. Perhaps
the board's position is correct,
but I maintain it should serious
ly consider the possibility of a
merger. Furthermore, the board
should consult the appropriate
University officials to determine
exactly what status the Book
store would have under the Uni
versity. After all, no business
enterprise makes progress by be-

ing content with the fact that the present system is "satisfactory."
Student sales exceed all others at the Bookstore. But the stu
dents receive only a token representation on the Board of Governors.
Currently the ASSU President and Business Manager are members
of Ihe Board of Governors, which meets annually. But most deci
sions are made by Ihe Board of Directors, which has no student
representative.
Finally, I feel that the many demands for Bookstore income, in
addition to rebates, warrant inquiry into any proposal that: shows
a possibility of increasing this income, or of allowing rebates to bo
increased.
