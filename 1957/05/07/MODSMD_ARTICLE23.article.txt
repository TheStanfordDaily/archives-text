The assistant chief of staff of I
the Morning Herald, Sydney, Aus
tralia, visited the campus yester
day in a world tour of universi
ties, newspapers and businesses.
Miss Kathleen Commins, whose
job is comparable to an American j
newspaper's city editor, began her
journalistic career as a writer- spe
cializing in women's sports. Since
then she has risen to the above
executive position and is now
making the tour under auspices
of her newspaper.
Oldest. Daily
While on campus Miss Commins
visited Hoover Institute and Li
brary, talked with Peter Allen of
the News and Publications Serv
ice, lunched at the Union Dining
Room and toured the Daily Shack.
She stay e d at the Florence
Moore guest room and
with Mrs. Robert Bush, wife of
education professor Bush. Miss
Commins and Mrs. Bush are for
mer classmates at Ihe University
of Sydney.
The oldest daily newspaper in
Australia, the Morning Herald at
first was very reluctant to hire
women, Miss Commins said. But
at the time there was an opening
for a women's sports writer, so
this was her start. She was active
in tennis, cricket arid hockey at
college and has a wide sports
knowledge. Since then she has
served on many positions and is
now in a top job.
Trips Difficult
"The thing that impresses me
most is the size of campuses and
the number of motor cars" at uni
versities. she said. "We are on i
sterling [monetary system] and
try necessity can't, afford cars."
Only $200 may be taken from ]
â– Australia, so it is very difficult
to make a large trip, she said.
There are about Ihree ways to
travel, she explained. These in
clude gr a nt sand scholarships
with expenses paid, traveling as
a guest of U.S. residents, and a
business men's or women's allow
ance plan. Miss Commins is trav
eling under the latter plan, spon
sored by the Morning Herald.
