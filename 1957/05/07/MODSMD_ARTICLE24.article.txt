# School Planning Lab Shows New Types Of Economic, Flexible Architecture
## 
### John Lane 
The School Planning Labora
tory in Cubberley Hall serves the
school systems of the Peninsula
and much of the West Coast by
helping the districts' school
boards to plan new facilities.
New types of interior and exte
rior architecture and fittings are
represented in the laboratory,
which is under the direction of
Dr. James D. MacConnell. assist
ant professor of education admin
istration.
The laboratory's Dr. Raymond
C. Schneider said that the key
note of new schools is economy
and flexibility, with the equip
ment in one classroom readily
movable to another, and even Ihe
classrooms interchangeable. The
flexibility of the classroom itself
is achieved by the placing of re
movable partitions between
rooms.
The laboratory itself is separat
ed from the Naval .ROTC class
rooms next door by the same type
of partition, forming a solid bar
rier wall. Bookshelves in the lab
oratory are also movable, and
some are on casters. .
Scattered around the six small

| rooms and offices of Ihe labora
tory are various experimental
i types of classroom furniture,
j Separate chairs and desks seem
1 to be the "new look" in keeping
i with the trend toward mobility.
In the lobby of the laboratory
is a model of a now style high
school building, with a curved
roof and very little direct light
ing from the sun. This feature
of school lighting is in use in an
office in the rear of the lab. The
artificial lighting . is directed
through glass panels in the coil
ing in such a manner that the
room appears to be lighted by
the sun itself.
One of the laboratory rooms is
used entirely for demonstration
of new techniques to school
board members or to architects.
Half the room is used to demon
! strate lighting techniques, and
â–  on one wall is a large model of
a new heating system. Schneider
said that a major problem of the
school planner is how to keep
classrooms properly heated dur
| ing school hours.
In order that school board
1 members may see how the out

side of their now buildings will
look before the buildings and
rooms are constructed, the inner
lobby (if Ihe lab is covered with
many types of wood paneling,
glass brick and acoustic tile. A
model of a plastic louver ar
rangement "has not met with
very great approval," Schneider
said, but most of the other ex
hibited types of building mate
rials and.innovations are modern
and functional.
Started by MacConnell in 1949,
the laboratory is unique, combin
ing academic and field work.
