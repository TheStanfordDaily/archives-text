### Dave Canfield 
For tho most inspiring sports sports story of 19.77, our vote goes
to this epic chronicle which appeared in last Wednesday's Daily
Californian, under the byline of Pat Lynden:
"Baseball is really wonderful. Spoils are really wonderful.
Sports develop fine character and good morals. Everybody should
be a sports fan.
"At yesterday's game between the S.F. firemen and Cal varsity,
Sheehy, one of the firemen, made a home run in the fourth inning.
He must really have character. Another one made a run in the sixth
inning. That was devastating. j <
"Itnt our boys, our heroes, tomorrow's leaders won the kuiiic
12-2 despite the efforts of the firemen. The firemen won a moral
victory though.
"There were two pitchers, one was .Tagger, and the other was j (
Rial. That's how it is in baseball. They were really wonderful.
"Such grace, such perfect timing, such -co-ordination, such
healthy fun. This is why people go to baseball games. They are 1
healthy.
. "Today the Cal varsity will play the USF Dons ... ! (
"Everyone should go. It promises to be a rich and gratifying 1
experience." I
(It was. Cal lost, 9-2, to USF, whom Stanford plays today at
2 p.m. tit Seals Stadium.)
After the Indian nine's "practice" lilt with the Dons, Coach j
Dutch Fehring's men will play their throe most crucial games of;'
the season against USC here Friday and against Cal twice here j j
Saturday. ;
The outcome of tho week's action may find Stanford represent- <
ing the CIBA in the NCAA playoffs. Much of the Cards' problems

will come in learning to shell the
deliveries of SC ace hruler Dale"l
Ziegler and Cal's two strong-arm
boys Doug Weiss and Gene
Stang.
However, Troy has a freshman
chucker who may be making the
SCites forget all about Ziegler
next year. This man is Bruce
Gard n e r , who has won 10
straight without a loss for the
Trobabes thus far, including one
no-hit, no-runner last Wednesday }
against Pepperdine.
Gardner's IOKA —1.2(5, which, I
however, compares unfavor
ably with Stan for d frosh
thrower Dick Williams' 0.00
earned run average. '
Rationalization of the week: '
Chuck Fenton of the UCLA
Daily Bruin on the fact that
Stanford's Jack Douglas sur
passed Uclan "wonderboys" Mike
Franks and Mike Green in the
O.jai Singles Tennis Tournament.
Said Fenton: "Greatness has a

way of showing itself, oven at its lowest ebb, as was proven by Bruin
Davis Cuppers Mike Franks and Mike Green who teamed to rapture
the Pacific Coast Conference tourney doubles liiie here today after
horrid singles performances. *•
"Obviously tired from a continuous year of tennis pressure,
including a trip to .Melbourne, the Bruins were way off their lies!
in losing singles matches yesterday."
(Franks lost to Douglas, Green to Alex Olmedo of TJSC, both in
comparatively trauma-free straight sets.)
With Franks, Green and Olmedo ineligible, Douglas is rated, by
such varied sources as the Daily California!) and his coach Bob
Kenker, as having an excellent chance to capture the 1?).~>7 NCAA
Tennis ('hampionship.
The tournament this year will be at Salt Lake City, Utah, June
1 :>-!(>. Also, givcm a good chance to lake a national title is the
"swamped," yet unstymied Indian crew.
Similar 1o the proposed "Body Snatchers vs. Legal Eagles" 'Med
School faculty aaginst Law School faculty) golf match here is the
annual University of Kansas lawyer-engineer tug-of-war.
In a letter officially challenging the engineers to another duel
this month, the law school faculty said in |i:irt, ". . . we of the
School of l„tf\v want one more chance to drag a number of your
hoys to defeat."
Commenting on the engineers'* alleged unsportsmanlike conduct,
the UK legal eagles said, "We would like to thing we could rely on
the honor system which works so well ii—our professional school
I>u 1 you have proven in I he past that you aren't up to such standards
of character."
Attention, Stanford's up-and-coming Orchesis organization: You
have nothing on the famed Orchesis group at the University of Oma
ha, according to a recent article in Time magazine.
After taking a physical education course in dancing, brawny
II of O football tackle Ken Leepcr "became so enthusiastic that he
dieted down from 275 pounds to 235 pounds and registered for an
all-women's course in modern dance," Time said.
Keeper was accepted in the course and by the middle of the
semester was elected to Orchesis, which is supposed to be just for
women.
Time added, "Leepcr did his own choreography for the Orchesis
show, in which he will wear a fluffy tutu (ballet costume) neatly
ornamented by a tattooed Marine motto, "Semper Fidelis," on his
ham-sized left arm."
In commenting on his success, Leeper said. "I'd still rather throw
a block in football than throw one of the girls in the dance."

Davis Cuppers Mike Franks and Mike Green who teamed to rapture
the Pacific Coast Conference tourney doubles liiie here today after
horrid singles performances. *•
"Obviously tired from a continuous year of tennis pressure,

in losing singles matches yesterday."
(Franks lost to Douglas, Green to Alex Olmedo of TJSC, both in
comparatively trauma-free straight sets.)

dieted down from 275 pounds to 235 pounds and registered for an

Chuck Fenton of the UCLA
Daily Bruin on the fact that
Stanford's Jack Douglas sur
passed Uclan "wonderboys" Mike
Franks and Mike Green in the
O.jai Singles Tennis Tournament.
Said Fenton: "Greatness has a

way of showing itself, oven at its lowest ebb, as was proven by Bruin
Davis Cuppers Mike Franks and Mike Green who teamed to rapture
the Pacific Coast Conference tourney doubles liiie here today after
horrid singles performances. *•
"Obviously tired from a continuous year of tennis pressure,
including a trip to .Melbourne, the Bruins were way off their lies!
in losing singles matches yesterday."
(Franks lost to Douglas, Green to Alex Olmedo of TJSC, both in
comparatively trauma-free straight sets.)
With Franks, Green and Olmedo ineligible, Douglas is rated, by
such varied sources as the Daily California!) and his coach Bob
Kenker, as having an excellent chance to capture the 1?).~>7 NCAA
Tennis ('hampionship.

annual University of Kansas lawyer-engineer tug-of-war.
In a letter officially challenging the engineers to another duel
this month, the law school faculty said in |i:irt, ". . . we of the
School of l„tf\v want one more chance to drag a number of your

Attention, Stanford's up-and-coming Orchesis organization: You
have nothing on the famed Orchesis group at the University of Oma
ha, according to a recent article in Time magazine.
After taking a physical education course in dancing, brawny
II of O football tackle Ken Leepcr "became so enthusiastic that he
dieted down from 275 pounds to 235 pounds and registered for an
all-women's course in modern dance," Time said.
Keeper was accepted in the course and by the middle of the
semester was elected to Orchesis, which is supposed to be just for
women.
Time added, "Leepcr did his own choreography for the Orchesis
show, in which he will wear a fluffy tutu (ballet costume) neatly
ornamented by a tattooed Marine motto, "Semper Fidelis," on his
ham-sized left arm."
In commenting on his success, Leeper said. "I'd still rather throw
a block in football than throw one of the girls in the dance."
