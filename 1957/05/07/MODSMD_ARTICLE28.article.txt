# Varsity Nine Plays USF In Seals Stadium Today
## Prep for Three Crucial CIBA Tilts This Weekend with SC, California 
### 
In preparation for three crucial tilts this weekend, Coach Dntrh
Fehring's varsity nine meets the University of San Francisco in
Seals Stadium today at 3:15 p.m.
The baseballers meet the league-leading Southern California Tro
jans Friday afternoon on the Sunken Diamond before closing the
CIBA season against California

Saturday in a doubleheader.
Since the Trojans are ineligible
for the league title, either Stan
lord or Cal will represent the
CIBA in the PCC title on May 31
to determine a representative to
the NCAA championships.
Third Place
The Indians, currently in third
place, sport a 7-0 record to Cal's
7-1. But the Bears have two
games left with SC, two with
Stanford and one with Santa
Clara.
Last Saturday left-hander Bob
Leopold set the Bears down, 2-1,
in Berkeley. Centerfielder Bob
Fletcher tripled in the top of the
eighth inning and was squeezed
home by secondbaseman A 1
Shaw's sacrifice bunt.
First Earned Run
Cal's only run was the first
earned run off Leopold this sea
son. He now has an earned run
average of .205.
Five of the starting nine are
batting over .300 after the Cal
game. They are Fletcher, third
baseman Rudy Figueroa, out
fielder Rich DeFabio, Shaw and
shortstop Steve Stewart.
The freshman nine meet Menlo
Junior College today on the
Sunken Diamond at 3:15 p.m.
The Papooses boast a 9-1 record,
having downed the California
frosh.
Tomorrow the tennis team
travels to San Jose to meet the
Spartans, while the frosh nine
host St. Ignatius on the Sunken
Diamond at 3:15 p.m.
