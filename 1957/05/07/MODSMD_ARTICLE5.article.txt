### 
WARSAW, May 6 <UP) â€” A
Communist youth newspaper to
day reported one of the worst
riots in Poland since last year's
Poznan revolt.
It said more than 1000 troops
and militiamen at the garrison
town of Jaroslaw battled the riot
ers, who threw stones and at
tacked the troops with their fists.
The troops finally overcame the
mob with tear gas. Nineteen per
sons were seized and six were
held under formal arrest.
The number of injured was not
given. But the description of the
disturbance in the youth news
paper S/pandar Mlodych indicated
il was one of the worst riots in a
series that began with the three
day Poznan revolt against the
Stalinist regime last June 28 and
continued last fall after the Tito
ist regime of Wladyslaw Gomulka
took over the country.
Drunken Soldier
The riot started when military
police arrested a drunken soldier
in Jaroslaw, a town of 20,000 near
the Soviet border. The newspaper
dispatch indicated that the inci
dent occurred late last week.
"His colleagues and hooligans
defended the soldier," the paper
said. "The group of brawlers rais
ed a racket and moved to the
militia post.
"Hundreds of onlookers gath
ered and a disturbance arose."
The crowd pelted the police sta
tion with stones and attacked mi
litiamen and members of the "In
ternal Military Service,*' the paper
said. One of those beaten was a
militia sergeant.
No Effect
Appeals for calm "had no effect
and the riot increased," Szpandar
Mlodych said.
"In vtpw of this, the militia used
tear gas, and a militia battalion
and a military alarm battalion in
tervened" to help regular army
men and other militiamen strug
gling with the crowd.
The paper blamed the riot on
I an "excessive quantity of alcohol"
I consumed at parties.
