# Vucinich Emphasizes Russian Individualism, Concentration on History in Series Lecture
## 
### 
"The Soviet citizen is as undis
ciplined and individualistic as
anyone anywhere," Wayne Vuci
nich of the History Department
told the Tuesday Evening Series
audience last night in Memorial
Auditorium.
"The Russian will smoke when
the sign says 'No Smoking,' argue
to get what he paid for, and stand
on his rights as a Soviet citizen,"
Vucinich explained. "He is also a
selfish capitalist behind the steer
ing wheel, and pedestrians in Rus-

sia are in as dangerous a position
as those anywhere."
The speaker, who spent six
months last year on an extensive
tour of eastern Europe and visit
ed many universities, noted that
the Russians are concentrating
studies on history. He pointed
out that the emphasis they are
placing on medieval and ancient
history will become the definitive
fai'tor in interpretation of events
of history.
"No Reason"
"The Russian people see no rea
son for a war between Russia and
the United States," Vucinich said.
"They know more about the Unit
ed States than Americans know
about Russia, but they can't un
derstand the American form of
government and our methods of
production and our society.
"There is no privacy in the Rus
sian home," the lecturer contin
ued, "large numbers living to
gether in one-f'oom flats. Private
dwellings are said to encourage
the evils of capitalism and indi
vidual is m. There are fewer
houses available than in 1917."
Passive Resistance
While visiting Soviet satellite
nations, the lecturer said he found
the people of Czechoslovakia con
tinuing passive resistance to Com
munism. There were no signs of
rebellion.
The Poles are behind Czecho
slovakia in economic and social
development, but they are more
free to speak out against the
Communist regime, Vucinich ob
served.
He added that he saw no desire
of Russians to escape their home
land, but satellite peoples were
eager to cross the Iron' Curtain
to the West.
