# Leadership deeded

### 
l\ A COIJIM.K OF MONTHS the 85th (Congress will
r«»!ir*» for its summer vacation. Unless moun
tains arc moved soon, I lie result of months of
debating will be practically no constructive
legislation ami an unwisely sliced budget.
So far only two pieces of major legislation
llave passed Congress and been signed by the
President the Eisenhower Mideast Doctrine
and the excise and corporations tax revision
bill.
Such important issues as school aid, civil
rights, Alaska and Hawaii statehood, revision
ol postal rates, aid to depressed areas and
minimum wage extension have hardly gotten
out of Senate or House committees.
Foreign aid proposals, OTC membership and
vitally needed changes in our immigration laws
have received no attention whatsoever. The
country has been treated to the spectacle of
debate and confusion on Eisenhower's pro
posed budget for the coining fiscal year.
Much ol the confusion has been due to a
lack of leadership. On the budget issue sup
porters of the Eisenhower budget are hesitant
to come out strongly for it, for fear that the
Administration might reverse itself on certain
points.
But within the Congress itself there is divi
sion. For instance, Republican Kentucky Sen
ator John Sherman Cooper supports the budg

et as a \ilal part of the aims of the Eisenhower
administration, while Senators Joseph Martin,
Harry Byrd and \\ illiam Knowland support
bigger cuts.
Many congressmen oppose any foreign aid
programs, despite the Administration's claim
that foreign aid can help NATO maintain
10 times as many army divisions as the United
States could with the same amount of money.
The anti-Administration party, instead of
having anything constructive to offer, is itself
divided and confused. With control in both
houses, Democrats fail to offer the needed
leadership.
As New ork Times writer James Reston
has put it: "Some of them criticize President
Eisenhower for not supporting his own $71
billion budget, others for putting it forward
in the first place.
"Some are for supporting the budget in an
era of rising responsibilities overseas aitd rising
population at home; others are for cutting
and promising the populace tax reduction."
(Largely due to long-range planning toward
the I9f>B elections, we would surmise.)
Such men as President Eisenhower, Sam
Rayhurn, Joseph Martin and Lyndon Johnson
must take (he leadership roles available to
them or see this year's Congress end in a
chaotic mess.
