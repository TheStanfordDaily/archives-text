# FROM ANOTHER VIEWPOINT—By Bob Freelen
## Trouble in Presenting Bookstore Plans 
### 
Editor's Note: This is the second and con
cluding column by ASSIT President Bob Free
len explaining his views on the Bookstore set
up. Yesterday's column dealt with proposed
changes which Freelen has asked be consid
ered by the Bookstore Board of Directors.
Last autumn quarter Dr. George S. Parks,
chairman of the Bookstore Board of Directors,
stated to Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler
that the student representatives to the Bookstore
Board of Governors would have an opportunity
to come before the Directors to make a proposal
concerning reorganization of the Bookstore.
On two occasions since thei, I have phoned Dr
Parks to remind him that we had a proposal to

make. On one occasion ho had
.just returned from a "special"
meeting of iho board, but he
made no mention of the faet
when I asked if he intended to
hold a board meeting during
spring quarter. In other
words, the net result has been
a run-around.
However, when Dr. Parks
discovered that Bill Mathew
son, the other student member
of Iho Board of Governors,
and I planned to release our
proposal through The Stan-

ford Daily, he telephoned the editor to inquire
whether an editorial might not ho delayed until
the matter had been talked over. This sudden
urge for discussion seems a little out of charac
ter compared with the events of tlie past few
months. I don't suppose it would have anything

to (Id with the fact thaf Malhovvson and I will he
leaving the University in June.
But the real question is why is the Board so
remiss to even receive our proposal?
11 we had made our proposal without thought
or research, Ihe Board's attitude would be under
standable. But this is not the case. Mathewson
and 1 have discussed the subject wilh University
officials, members ol the Board of Governors
and other students, all of whom encouraged us
to pursue the possibility of Bookstore reorgani
zation. Furthermore a committee of LASSIJ,
headed by Dave Kit bach ol the Law School, has
(•(inducted extensive research. I have received
a detailed report from the committee, and I will
forward copies to each member of the Board of
Governors and appropriate University officials.
This is hardly a "pel project" or an ill-con
ceived student crusade. As far as I am con
cerned it is a feasible suggestion resulting from
the serious efforts ol many interested students.
Obviously students do not have the perspec
tive or ihe wealth of knowledge possessed by
many members of the Board, some of whom
have served as many as 15 years. But students
should not be excluded from having well-organ
ized and well-intentioned suggestions considered
by the Board of Directors and Ihe Board of Gov
ernors.
I sincerely hope the Board of Directors will
form a sub-committee to study the proposals we
have made. I feel a detailed study might reveal
many worthwhile ideas which never would occur
to students, who are not as well versed in the
intricacies of the Bookstore operation. I also
hope the appropriate University officials are
consulted, because I am convinced that they too
could contribute valuable suggestions.

the matter had been talked over. This sudden
urge for discussion seems a little out of charac
ter compared with the events of tlie past few
months. I don't suppose it would have anything

to (Id with the fact thaf Malhovvson and I will he
leaving the University in June.
But the real question is why is the Board so
remiss to even receive our proposal?
11 we had made our proposal without thought
or research, Ihe Board's attitude would be under
standable. But this is not the case. Mathewson
and 1 have discussed the subject wilh University
officials, members ol the Board of Governors
and other students, all of whom encouraged us
to pursue the possibility of Bookstore reorgani
zation. Furthermore a committee of LASSIJ,
headed by Dave Kit bach ol the Law School, has
(•(inducted extensive research. I have received
a detailed report from the committee, and I will
forward copies to each member of the Board of
Governors and appropriate University officials.
This is hardly a "pel project" or an ill-con
ceived student crusade. As far as I am con
cerned it is a feasible suggestion resulting from
the serious efforts ol many interested students.
Obviously students do not have the perspec
tive or ihe wealth of knowledge possessed by
many members of the Board, some of whom
have served as many as 15 years. But students
should not be excluded from having well-organ
ized and well-intentioned suggestions considered
by the Board of Directors and Ihe Board of Gov
ernors.
I sincerely hope the Board of Directors will
form a sub-committee to study the proposals we
have made. I feel a detailed study might reveal
many worthwhile ideas which never would occur
to students, who are not as well versed in the
intricacies of the Bookstore operation. I also
hope the appropriate University officials are
consulted, because I am convinced that they too
could contribute valuable suggestions.


Bob Freelen
Editor's Note: This is the second and con
cluding column by ASSIT President Bob Free
len explaining his views on the Bookstore set
up. Yesterday's column dealt with proposed
changes which Freelen has asked be consid
ered by the Bookstore Board of Directors.
Last autumn quarter Dr. George S. Parks,
chairman of the Bookstore Board of Directors,
stated to Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler
that the student representatives to the Bookstore
Board of Governors would have an opportunity
to come before the Directors to make a proposal
concerning reorganization of the Bookstore.
On two occasions since thei, I have phoned Dr
Parks to remind him that we had a proposal to

make. On one occasion ho had
.just returned from a "special"
meeting of iho board, but he
made no mention of the faet
when I asked if he intended to
hold a board meeting during
spring quarter. In other
words, the net result has been
a run-around.
However, when Dr. Parks
discovered that Bill Mathew
son, the other student member
of Iho Board of Governors,
and I planned to release our
proposal through The Stan-

ford Daily, he telephoned the editor to inquire
whether an editorial might not ho delayed until
the matter had been talked over. This sudden
urge for discussion seems a little out of charac
ter compared with the events of tlie past few
months. I don't suppose it would have anything

to (Id with the fact thaf Malhovvson and I will he
