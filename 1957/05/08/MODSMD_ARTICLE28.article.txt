# SOPHOMORE BIOCHEMIST
## Hungarian Student, Captured by Russ During Revolution, Now Studies Here 
### 
Janos Lanyi was captured by
Russian troops in Budapest on
the first day of the Hungarian
revolution last October. He is
19, and is now a sophomoYe at
Stanford, studying to become a
biochemist.
On Oct. 23, the first day of
fighting, Lanyi and a friend were
taken by Russian soldiers to a
military camp in a country town
near Budapest. "We escaped
from Ihe camp after five weeks
and went to Austria. At that time
Kadar was in control in Hun
gary, so we had no choice but to
remain in Austria.
"I was tested in Vienna by
three Stanford professors to see
if I could be one of the six Hun
garian students who would get
scholarships to Stanford," he
said. The professors were Drs.
Gabor Szego, professor of mathe
matics; Anthony Sokol, profes
sor of Asiatic and Slavic studies,
and Siemon Midler, professor of
geology.
Two More
The other two Hungarian stu
dents who are already at Stan
ford with these scholarships are
Akos Pinezich, who is studying
geophysics, and Judit Szego, a
relative of Professor Szego, who
is studying electrical engineer
ing.
"Relatives and a Catholic re
lief organization sponsored my
trip and were responsible for my
personal safety 1 ill I arrived in
San Francisco," he continued.
"The Russian-run government
was very harsh on the Hungarian
people," he said, "especially eco
nomically. They classified peo
ple as to how hard they were go
ing to treat them." The people
Ihey treated best were the work
ers. Peasants, intellectuals, mis
cellaneous (persons such as bank
ers, as Lanyi's father) and "ene
mies of the people" were treated
worse in that order.* "An 'enemy
of the people,' or a relation of
one, was not permitted to attend
the university. The best example
of an enemy of the people was
the factory owner," Lanyi said.
No Democracy
There was no democracy at all,
he said. "Democracy was one of
the main goals of the uprising
and the university students were
the leaders of the revolution."
As for freedom of speech, he
said, "people had always to fear
that they would say something
wrong against the government.
They couldn't say really what
they wanted to say about the
government. They had two parts
of their lives: one was what they
said in public, working, at meet
ings; second was what they felt
freer to say at home and before
friends."
Lanyi thinks that Had not Rus
sia come in to crush the revolu
tion, the people would have set
up a real parliamentary form of
government. Russia had allowed
a parliamentary government—in
form, but not in practice, ho said.
One Party
There was a central committee
of the Communist party in Hun
gary, and it was the head of the
government. What that commit
tee decided was the policy of the
government. People in it said
what they were forced to say, or
they were expelled, he explained.
Everybody knew about this sit
uation, but could not do a thing
to change it. "People had no in
fluence in governmental poli
cies," Lanyi said.
There was only one party in
Hungary—the Communist party.
In the five free days in Budapest,
the people organized several po
litical parties. It is a "character
istic" of the people that they
wanted to form their own par
ties, he said.
Where did the Hungarians

learn all this about democracy?
"In the past 100 years, since
the 1848 revolution, democracy
was a great aim for the Hunga
rian people. During the time
when Malenkov was in power in
Russia," Lanyi said, "there was
more freedom in Hungary to
show dissatisfaction with certain
phases of the government.
Before the outbreak of hostili
ties Lanyi had been the leader of
a group of sophomore chemistry
students at the University of Sci
ences in Budapest. The students
mel and discussed such topics as
the lack of academic freedom
and autonomy.
At first the people were afraid
to say they did not want Commu
nism, but the people, especially
the writers, said they wanted to
reform Communism."
As this feeling of freedom
grew, the people became freer
in their claims, he said. On the
day of the revolution, Oct. 23,
they cried for democracy, and
wanted to get rid of Communism.
They told Russia to take her
troops out of Hungary, and

wanted to take the new uranium
[mines from Russian control.
"We wanted to change the red
I star emblem of Russian govern
ment to the emblem of Kossuth,
jthe leader of the 1848 Hungarian
j revolution," he said.
"We all expected help from the
United Nations. During the five
i free days in Budapest, the Nagy
government proclaimed Hun
gary a free nation, and asked for
aid.
i "We wanted Hammarskjold to
! come to Hungary to see our prob
lem. Perhaps if Hammarskjold
i had come during those five free
. days," he said, "Russia might not
| have come back in. We could not
imagine that we were alone.
About 65,000 people were killed
j in the streets during the revolu
; tion.
"The poople have no hope that
they can stage another uprising,
or that any such move would be
successful. Poland took a less
! |drastic| step, but the Poles have
•no hope to get rid of Commu
nism, at least in ihe near future.
I They can hope only to be a little
i more free," he said.
Lanyi wants to stay at Stan
lord until he gets a Ph.D. in bio
chemistry. "I want to become a
citizen of the United States, and
do research somewhere in this
country," he said.

cellaneous (persons such as bank
ers, as Lanyi's father) and "ene
mies of the people" were treated
worse in that order.* "An 'enemy
of the people,' or a relation of
one, was not permitted to attend
the university. The best example
of an enemy of the people was
the factory owner," Lanyi said.
No Democracy
There was no democracy at all,
he said. "Democracy was one of
the main goals of the uprising
and the university students were
the leaders of the revolution."
As for freedom of speech, he
said, "people had always to fear
that they would say something
wrong against the government.
They couldn't say really what
they wanted to say about the
government. They had two parts
of their lives: one was what they
said in public, working, at meet
ings; second was what they felt
freer to say at home and before
friends."
Lanyi thinks that Had not Rus
sia come in to crush the revolu
tion, the people would have set
up a real parliamentary form of
government. Russia had allowed
a parliamentary government—in
form, but not in practice, ho said.
One Party
There was a central committee
of the Communist party in Hun
gary, and it was the head of the
government. What that commit
tee decided was the policy of the
government. People in it said
what they were forced to say, or
they were expelled, he explained.
Everybody knew about this sit
uation, but could not do a thing
to change it. "People had no in
fluence in governmental poli
cies," Lanyi said.
There was only one party in
Hungary—the Communist party.
In the five free days in Budapest,
the people organized several po
litical parties. It is a "character
istic" of the people that they
wanted to form their own par
ties, he said.
Where did the Hungarians

learn all this about democracy?
"In the past 100 years, since
the 1848 revolution, democracy
was a great aim for the Hunga
rian people. During the time
when Malenkov was in power in
Russia," Lanyi said, "there was
more freedom in Hungary to
show dissatisfaction with certain
phases of the government.
Before the outbreak of hostili
ties Lanyi had been the leader of
a group of sophomore chemistry
students at the University of Sci
ences in Budapest. The students
mel and discussed such topics as
the lack of academic freedom
and autonomy.
At first the people were afraid
to say they did not want Commu
nism, but the people, especially
the writers, said they wanted to
reform Communism."
As this feeling of freedom
grew, the people became freer
in their claims, he said. On the
day of the revolution, Oct. 23,
they cried for democracy, and
wanted to get rid of Communism.
They told Russia to take her
troops out of Hungary, and

wanted to take the new uranium
[mines from Russian control.
"We wanted to change the red
I star emblem of Russian govern
ment to the emblem of Kossuth,
jthe leader of the 1848 Hungarian
j revolution," he said.
"We all expected help from the
United Nations. During the five
i free days in Budapest, the Nagy
government proclaimed Hun
gary a free nation, and asked for

i "We wanted Hammarskjold to

I They can hope only to be a little

Lanyi wants to stay at Stan

chemistry. "I want to become a

the people organized several po
litical parties. It is a "character
istic" of the people that they
wanted to form their own par
ties, he said.
Where did the Hungarians

learn all this about democracy?
"In the past 100 years, since
the 1848 revolution, democracy
was a great aim for the Hunga
rian people. During the time
when Malenkov was in power in
Russia," Lanyi said, "there was
more freedom in Hungary to
show dissatisfaction with certain
phases of the government.
Before the outbreak of hostili
ties Lanyi had been the leader of
a group of sophomore chemistry
students at the University of Sci
ences in Budapest. The students
mel and discussed such topics as
the lack of academic freedom
and autonomy.
At first the people were afraid
to say they did not want Commu
nism, but the people, especially
the writers, said they wanted to
reform Communism."
As this feeling of freedom
grew, the people became freer
in their claims, he said. On the
day of the revolution, Oct. 23,
they cried for democracy, and
wanted to get rid of Communism.
They told Russia to take her
troops out of Hungary, and

wanted to take the new uranium
[mines from Russian control.
"We wanted to change the red
I star emblem of Russian govern
ment to the emblem of Kossuth,
jthe leader of the 1848 Hungarian
j revolution," he said.
"We all expected help from the
United Nations. During the five
i free days in Budapest, the Nagy
government proclaimed Hun
gary a free nation, and asked for
aid.
i "We wanted Hammarskjold to
! come to Hungary to see our prob
lem. Perhaps if Hammarskjold
i had come during those five free

| have come back in. We could not
imagine that we were alone.
About 65,000 people were killed
j in the streets during the revolu
; tion.
"The poople have no hope that
they can stage another uprising,
or that any such move would be
successful. Poland took a less

•no hope to get rid of Commu

I They can hope only to be a little

Lanyi wants to stay at Stan
lord until he gets a Ph.D. in bio
chemistry. "I want to become a
citizen of the United States, and
do research somewhere in this
country," he said.

Janos Lanyi was captured by
Russian troops in Budapest on
the first day of the Hungarian
revolution last October. He is
19, and is now a sophomoYe at
Stanford, studying to become a
biochemist.
On Oct. 23, the first day of
fighting, Lanyi and a friend were
taken by Russian soldiers to a
military camp in a country town
near Budapest. "We escaped
from Ihe camp after five weeks
and went to Austria. At that time
Kadar was in control in Hun
gary, so we had no choice but to
remain in Austria.
"I was tested in Vienna by
three Stanford professors to see
if I could be one of the six Hun
garian students who would get
scholarships to Stanford," he
said. The professors were Drs.
Gabor Szego, professor of mathe
matics; Anthony Sokol, profes

and Siemon Midler, professor of
geology.

The other two Hungarian stu
dents who are already at Stan
ford with these scholarships are
Akos Pinezich, who is studying
geophysics, and Judit Szego, a
relative of Professor Szego, who
is studying electrical engineer

"Relatives and a Catholic re
lief organization sponsored my
trip and were responsible for my
personal safety 1 ill I arrived in
San Francisco," he continued.
"The Russian-run government
was very harsh on the Hungarian
people," he said, "especially eco
nomically. They classified peo
ple as to how hard they were go

Ihey treated best were the work
ers. Peasants, intellectuals, mis
cellaneous (persons such as bank
ers, as Lanyi's father) and "ene

worse in that order.* "An 'enemy
