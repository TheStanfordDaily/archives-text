## 
### 
Fresno's annual West Coast |
Relays will open the post-dual j
meet phase of the Pacific Coast!
irack and field schedule Satur
day afternoon and evening in
Ratcliffe Stadium.
Wester n teams have spent
most of the season engaged in
dual and triangular affairs, but
will now switch their attention
1o the large relay, invitational
and championship meets. The
collegiate season's climax will
?(ime June 14-15 when the NCAA
championships are held in Aus
tin, Texas.
Field Hopes High
Stanford Coach Pay ton Jordan
plans to send a full complement
of entries to the Fresno meet. Al
though billed as a relay meet, the
best chances for honors as far as
the Indians are concerned will
come in the individual events.
Frank Herrmann, Phil Fehlen,
Hank Roldan and Fred Peters i

appear to be Stanford's chief con
tenders in Ihe field activities.
Herrmann ranks among the
nation's top broad-jumpers with
his mark of 25-!4. He is unbeaten
against PCC competition this
year, and is expected to place
high at Fresno.
Fehlen a Contender
Fehlen, after leaping 6-8 1 /l>
near ihe start of the season, has
been unable to improve on that
mark. Still, his fairly consistent
jumping at 6-6 and 6-7 should en
able him to stay in close conten
tion for place honors. An almost
sure winner in Ihe event is Olym
pic Champion Charley Dumas,
the world's only seven-foot high
jumper.
Roldan is about the most con
sistent of the Stanford perform
ers. He has a season's top mark
of 227-4'L'. and has improved al
most every week.
Peters Reliable
Discus thrower Peters has
been another of Jordan's reliable
field men, with a top mark of
172-8 in the discus. He narrowly
fouled on a loss of over 177
feet, and looks ready to snap up
near the 180 mark.
In all, the Indians will enter 12
men in field events, three in indi
vidual races, and will have teams
in the 440, 880 and mile relays.


I'LATTKR SPECIALIST â€” Fred Peters will be Stanford's top
threat in open discus competition ill Saturday's West Coast Relays
in Fresno. Peters, u senior, has improved his throws nearly 20
feet this year, anil has a season best of 172-8. lie bus cracked meet
records against both Occidental and California.
