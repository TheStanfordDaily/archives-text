# Delinquency Topic of 'Y' Discussion
## Probation Officer Questioned on SU Beach Party 
### Leo Krulitz 
"Juvenile Delinquency in the
Bay Area" was the topic of a
speech given to the YWCA Pub
lic Affairs Luncheon yesterday
by Anthony Lovoi, probation of
ficer of San Mateo County. Lo
voi, who has been working on the
case concerning the attack on
Stanford students at a beach par
ty, answered questions about the
case and juvenile delinquency in
general.
In assuring Stanford students
that everything will be done to
the offenders that is possible, Lo
voi said, "We are as disturbed
about this case as you are. This
is the first time we've had physi
cal assault by a group in San
Mateo County." He explained
most juvenile delinquency cases
here concern individuals' instead
of gangs.
Jury Trial
He said a jury trial for these
boys would be held May 27 in
Superior Court but warned it
might be postponed. Lovoi de
scribed some of the legal maneu
vers the lawyers for the defense
might use. He said, "The law is
fine, except it has some techni
calities that make justice hard to
understand sometimes."
Lovoi, who has been a proba
tion officer in San Mateo County
for 14 years, had this warning for
Stanford students: "When you
go to a beach party at night, be
sure you have a large enough
group with you. Be aware of the
type of youngsters that approach
you."
"In the general public today
the tendency is to defy author
ity," he stated. Lovoi showed the
increase in crime and juvenile de
linquency with various figures
and said, "We are facing a criti
cal period. It Is indicated by 1960
the cases going to court will in
crease 100 per cent in San Mateo
County."
Middle Income
Answering a question from the
audience with regard to the num
ber of juvenile delinquents that
come from the middle income
families, he said, "Delinquency,
like disease, has no respect for
social or economic status. We
get them from all brackets." He
also stated the treatment of cases
was the same regardless of the
finances of the youngsters' par
ents.
"These kids are pretty desper
ate and pretty dangerous," he
added. "They hate their parents,
their teachers, their principals,
the first policeman they meet and
state officers. They hate until
someone can do something for
them." He said, however, that
the cases weren't hopeless. "I've
seen big, tough 17-year-olds that
have committed armed robbery,
cry over a birthday cake. They
have feelings."
In answer to a question con
cerning the help the armed serv
ices could give these boys, Lovoi
said it helped some of them but,
"Some aren't emotionally equip
ped to handle the discipline of
the service."

of gangs.
Jury Trial
He said a jury trial for these
boys would be held May 27 in
Superior Court but warned it
might be postponed. Lovoi de
scribed some of the legal maneu
vers the lawyers for the defense
might use. He said, "The law is
fine, except it has some techni
calities that make justice hard to
understand sometimes."
Lovoi, who has been a proba
tion officer in San Mateo County
for 14 years, had this warning for
Stanford students: "When you
go to a beach party at night, be
sure you have a large enough
group with you. Be aware of the
type of youngsters that approach
you."
"In the general public today
the tendency is to defy author
ity," he stated. Lovoi showed the
increase in crime and juvenile de
linquency with various figures
and said, "We are facing a criti
cal period. It Is indicated by 1960
the cases going to court will in
crease 100 per cent in San Mateo
County."
Middle Income
Answering a question from the
audience with regard to the num
ber of juvenile delinquents that
come from the middle income
families, he said, "Delinquency,
like disease, has no respect for
social or economic status. We
get them from all brackets." He
also stated the treatment of cases
was the same regardless of the
finances of the youngsters' par
ents.
"These kids are pretty desper
ate and pretty dangerous," he
added. "They hate their parents,
their teachers, their principals,
the first policeman they meet and
state officers. They hate until
someone can do something for
them." He said, however, that
the cases weren't hopeless. "I've
seen big, tough 17-year-olds that
have committed armed robbery,
cry over a birthday cake. They
have feelings."
In answer to a question con
cerning the help the armed serv
ices could give these boys, Lovoi
said it helped some of them but,
"Some aren't emotionally equip
ped to handle the discipline of
the service."
"Juvenile Delinquency in the
Bay Area" was the topic of a
speech given to the YWCA Pub
lic Affairs Luncheon yesterday
by Anthony Lovoi, probation of
ficer of San Mateo County. Lo
voi, who has been working on the
case concerning the attack on
Stanford students at a beach par
ty, answered questions about the
case and juvenile delinquency in
general.
In assuring Stanford students
that everything will be done to
the offenders that is possible, Lo
voi said, "We are as disturbed
about this case as you are. This
is the first time we've had physi
cal assault by a group in San
Mateo County." He explained
most juvenile delinquency cases
here concern individuals' instead
of gangs.
