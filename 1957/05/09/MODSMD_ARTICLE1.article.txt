budget for the 12 months start

be back in about 10 days. And
if he doesn't get the money by
July 1, he added, mail service
will have to be curtailed again.
Volume Far Ahead

the volume of mail is running
far ahead of what was expected
last January when President Ei

getting $41,000,000 of the addi
tional $47,000,000 he had request
ed.

GOP Congressional leaders about
his department's financial woes.
