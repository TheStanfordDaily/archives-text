# Beach Attack Suspect Beaten; Assailants in 'Stanford Jackets'
## Four Assault Rutherdale in Redwood City Craig, Davis Deny Probability of Student Implication in Beating 
### 
Donald A. Rutherdale Jr., 10,
of San Carlos, one of seven
youths charged with attacking a
group of Stanford students at
San Gregorio Beach April 12, was
beaten Monday night in Redwood
City. Rutherford claims that two
of his assailants were wearing
Stanford jackets.
Contacted at his home by tele
phone, Rutherdale told The
Dai-ly: '"I had left a drive-in in
my car about 11:15 and was driv
ing alone when a car behind me
kept honking.
"I pulled over and four guys
got out and attacked me," ho
said. "I went home, washed my
face and then went to the police."
Rutherdale said that one of
the youths told him after the
beating, "This will teach you not
to pick on Stanford students."
Rutherdale said his attackers
were driving a dark blue 1949 or
1950 Oldsmobile.
Report Held Up
The police report of the inci
dent was held up while Redwood
City police investigated a lead
as to the possible identity of the
assailants. Stanford police were
alerted to look for a car of the
type Rutherdale described.
Dean of Men William Craig re
ported that he knew definitely,
from investigation, that none of
the Stanford students who were
at San Gregorio April 12 had at
tacked Rutherdslle.
"I seriously doubt that any
Stanford students were among
the attackers," Dean Craig add
ed.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis pointed out that "any red
jacket with tan sleeves is a Stan
ford jacket and can be bought by
anyone at several local stores.
Therefore, the jackets do not
prove that Stanford students
were responsible."
Chief Davis raised the possibil
ity that "someone else beat him
| Rutherdale | up," and the victim
said Stanford students were re
sponsible "to get the public on
his side."
A San Francisco paper yester
day reported Rutherdale as say
ing two of his attackers wore
sweaters with block "S" insignia.
Rutherdale told The Daily that
they wore the "regular Stanford
jackets."
Presents Medical Report
Rutherdale presented a medi
cal report signed by Dr. H. Mc-
Leod Patterson, San Carlos,
which described his injuries as
multiple abrasions and contu
sions of the knee, abdomen and
ribs, and contusions of the face
including a "greatly swollen"
right cheek.
One police officer said the as
sault case against Rutherdale
and several co-defendants would
be "blown up" if it were shown
that Stanford students had taken
the law into their own hands.
A spokesman for the San Ma
teo County District Attorney's
office reported, however, that the
prosecution in the present case
(the San Gregorio incident) will
continue "on schedule."
A University official m;ide it
clear that if any Stanford stn
dents tried to "play vigilante,"
they will be referred to the judi
cial council for violation of the
Fundamental Standard.

Report Held Up
The police report of the inci
dent was held up while Redwood
City police investigated a lead
as to the possible identity of the
assailants. Stanford police were
alerted to look for a car of the
type Rutherdale described.
Dean of Men William Craig re
ported that he knew definitely,
from investigation, that none of
the Stanford students who were
at San Gregorio April 12 had at
tacked Rutherdslle.
"I seriously doubt that any
Stanford students were among
the attackers," Dean Craig add
ed.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis pointed out that "any red
jacket with tan sleeves is a Stan
ford jacket and can be bought by
anyone at several local stores.
Therefore, the jackets do not
prove that Stanford students
were responsible."
Chief Davis raised the possibil
ity that "someone else beat him
| Rutherdale | up," and the victim
said Stanford students were re
sponsible "to get the public on
his side."
A San Francisco paper yester
day reported Rutherdale as say
ing two of his attackers wore
sweaters with block "S" insignia.
Rutherdale told The Daily that
they wore the "regular Stanford
jackets."
Presents Medical Report
Rutherdale presented a medi
cal report signed by Dr. H. Mc-
Leod Patterson, San Carlos,
which described his injuries as
multiple abrasions and contu
sions of the knee, abdomen and
ribs, and contusions of the face
including a "greatly swollen"
right cheek.
One police officer said the as
sault case against Rutherdale
and several co-defendants would
be "blown up" if it were shown
that Stanford students had taken
the law into their own hands.
A spokesman for the San Ma
teo County District Attorney's
office reported, however, that the
prosecution in the present case
(the San Gregorio incident) will
continue "on schedule."
A University official m;ide it
clear that if any Stanford stn
dents tried to "play vigilante,"
they will be referred to the judi
cial council for violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
