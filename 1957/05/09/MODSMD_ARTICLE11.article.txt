"Around the World in 10 Years"
might well be the title of a book
or movie depicting the experi
ences of two young Iranian stu
dents when they complete their
current 10-year global motorcycle
tour.
Issa and Abdullah Ommidvar,
27 and 24 respectively, are spend
ing a week and a half as guests
of Theta Chi fraternity and Stan
ford University.
"We are enjoying our stay here

very much," they said, "and the
students are very friendly and
helpful. We are very grateful to
Stanford, and especially to profes
sor Robert Bush, for all that has
bepn done for us.
"The basic principle of this trip
is to give and get ideas. We are
also gathering handicrafts from
all the countries we visit to or
ganize a world handicraft exhibit
when we return to Iran."
Excursion Expenses
Expenses for the excursion are
being met partly by the Iranian
government, payment for maga
zine articles and sale of craft
items.
In their motorcycle packs they
are carrying an Iranian-oriented
exhibit which they are especially
desirous to show at all stops. It
will be included in the Interna
tional Arts Tea on Sunday in the
Women's Gymnasium courtyard.
Arrival in the United States
marks completion of one-third of
their itinerary and the 22nd coun
try visited. They landed in Los
Angeles last month and spent 10
days traveling to the San Fran
cisco area.
The brothers have attempted
to tour and stay at colleges and
universities around the world.
Three years ago they left Te
heran, where they were gradu
ated from college with major
fields in geography, engineering
and photography.
"We're Also Graduated"
"We are also graduated from
the 'Scenic Institute of Mountain
Climbing'," they added. This ex
plains their long mountaineering
record, which includes a 22,000-
foot climb in the Himalayas.
Mt. McKinley, Alaska, is the
Ommidvars' next project. They
plan to arrive in Fairbanks May
2K, display exhibits and give lec
tures at the University of Alaska
and then camp for three months

on ice and snow before climbing
the peak. During this time they
will also take slides of Eskimo
life and wild animals.
Extensive photography is one
of their main projects, which they
hope can be converted into educa
tional movies for television.
President Eisenhower's signa
ture is another of their goals. This
they hope to add to a growing
list of national leaders obtained
in every visited country. In ad
dition, they hope to present the
President -with a Persian carpet.

"Around the World in 10 Years"

"We are enjoying our stay here

very much," they said, "and the
students are very friendly and
helpful. We are very grateful to
Stanford, and especially to profes
sor Robert Bush, for all that has

"The basic principle of this trip
is to give and get ideas. We are

Excursion Expenses
Expenses for the excursion are
being met partly by the Iranian
government, payment for maga
zine articles and sale of craft
items.

are carrying an Iranian-oriented

desirous to show at all stops. It
will be included in the Interna

Ommidvars' next project. They
plan to arrive in Fairbanks May

will also take slides of Eskimo
life and wild animals.
Extensive photography is one
of their main projects, which they
hope can be converted into educa
tional movies for television.
President Eisenhower's signa
ture is another of their goals. This
they hope to add to a growing
list of national leaders obtained
in every visited country. In ad
dition, they hope to present the
President -with a Persian carpet.
