# High-Powered Tactics

Kvf.R SINCK I lie PCC scandals rocked tlie ath
letie world. Stanford lias slaunelily maintained
tfiat she was not guilty of any rule infractions,
despite reports to the contrary from some of
her collegiate brethren. Because il trustingly
believed in the University's innocence, The
l)ail\ has repeatedly challenged every attack
upon Stanford's chastity.
Last Monday, however, Northwestern ath
letic director Stu llolcomh exposed Stanford's
hypocrisy by naming the "Halo Alto univer
sity as one of several colleges conducting very
aggressive athletic recruiting programs in the
Big Ten area.
At first I he Daily was skeptical of HoleombV*
accusations inasmuch as there is a tremendous
shortage of top athletes in the Big Ten area.
However, a quick check of the facts proved
that the director knew of what he spoke.
There are 475 students enrolled in Stanford
from the seven states in which the Big Ten
schools reside. And the fact that 193 of these
students hail from Illinois makes il all the
more fitting that llolcomh should be the one
to expose Stanford, inasmuch as Northwestern
is situated in the Sucker State.
By checking the rosters of the four major
sports on the Farm, I he Daily was able to see

thai the aggressive program is producing re
sults. I here are only Oli candidates out for
spring loothall practice, for example, and one
is from the Big Ten area.
Further proof of Stanford's high-powered
recruiting tactics can he found by examining
the baseball and basketball rosters. Both sports
have one man listed who hails from the Big
Ten's private hunting grounds. Track does not
have any.
What llolcomh fails to realize, as did The
Daily up until now, is that an athlete can't
maintain the high standard of living expected
of a person in his position on the measly salary
to which super-conservative conferences limit
him.
Therefore, Stanford took the only course left
open to il a high-powered, under-the-table,
an\thing-goes recruiting program. In fact, The
Daily wishes to applaud the University for
being able to keep its program secret for so
long, thereby completely fooling the other
schools.
If all goes well with Stanford's aggressive
recruiting program, there is no reason why the
I niversity shouldn't reach its ultimate goal:
one athlete from tlie Big Ten area in every
sport.
