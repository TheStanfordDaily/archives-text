# FROM ANOTHER VIEWPOINTâ€”Bookstore Directors
## Present Bookstore Operation Is Defended 
### 
Editor's Note: For the last two days The
Daily lias printed the views of ASSII President
Bob Freelen on the need for revising the Book
store setup. Following is the April 25 stale
ment of the five-man Bookstore Board of Di
rectors, giving their views us to the operation
of the Bookstore.
There is no profit. The Bookstore has never
made a profit, floes not want to make a profit
and is not allowed by its articles of incorpora
tion to make a profit.
Bookstore customers receive back in the form
of "rebates" as much as possible of what they
have paid in purchases. Thus "rebates" take the
place of "profit." For several years Ihe rebate
has been between 15 and 20 per cent.
Amount of rebate is figured as follows. In
come is from sales. From this income, deduct
cost of goods sold. Then deduct operating ex
penses. Make allowance for depreciation. This
leaves a net margin. Most of this net margin is
returned to the customers as rebates. Some goes
as a gift to the University for scholarships, and
some has been set aside for a new-building fund.
Federal income tax is paid on money used for
a gift to the University (only a small part of
the gift is tax-free) and on money held in re
serve funds. That is all. If the board of direc
tors of the Bookstore decides not to continue the
gift, and not to increase the reserve funds any
more, there will be no income tax to pay. This
can be done. Perhaps it will be done. Income
lax would thereby be entirely eliminated.
A new Bookstore building Is planned. This
will be owned by the University and leased to

the Bookstore corporation. Rent paid to the Uni
versity will amortize the building and pay inter
est on the University's investment. The rent
paid by tlie Bookstore on the new building will
increase operating expenses, and so will take a
slice out of the net margin. This will tend to
reduce rebates. But it will also make it unneces
sary to set aside further building reserve funds.
This will help increase rebates. The net effect
will probably be a reduction of rebates, but not
a very large reduction.
The Bookstore Corporation consists of about
.'{(i faculty men. They receive no pay or any kind
of remuneration. Five are elected to serve as a
board of directors. They, also, are unpaid. Their
only purpose is to operate the Bookstore for the
benefit of the students and faculty. There is no
financial profit to the corporation, to the direc
tors, or to anyone else.
Any suggestion of diverting "Bookstore prof
its to any other purpose is quile idle. There is
no profit.
The rebate to customers could, if the Corpora
lion desired, be reduced or eliminated. Money
thus withheld from rebates to customers could
then be diverted to some such purpose as a new
nion building. Income tax would have to be paid
on this money, anrl about half of such money
would go into taxes. To transfer rebate money
to a new union building there is one sure tax
free way, as follows:
The Bookstore would continue to pay rebates
to customers, returning as much money as pos
sible. Each studept, on receiving his rebate
money, could donate it to a fund for a new union
building if he desired to do so. (A box could
be provided.T

Editor's Note: For the last two days The
Daily lias printed the views of ASSII President
Bob Freelen on the need for revising the Book
store setup. Following is the April 25 stale
ment of the five-man Bookstore Board of Di
rectors, giving their views us to the operation
of the Bookstore.
There is no profit. The Bookstore has never
made a profit, floes not want to make a profit
and is not allowed by its articles of incorpora
tion to make a profit.
Bookstore customers receive back in the form
of "rebates" as much as possible of what they
have paid in purchases. Thus "rebates" take the
place of "profit." For several years Ihe rebate
has been between 15 and 20 per cent.
Amount of rebate is figured as follows. In
come is from sales. From this income, deduct
cost of goods sold. Then deduct operating ex
penses. Make allowance for depreciation. This
leaves a net margin. Most of this net margin is
returned to the customers as rebates. Some goes
as a gift to the University for scholarships, and
some has been set aside for a new-building fund.
Federal income tax is paid on money used for
a gift to the University (only a small part of
the gift is tax-free) and on money held in re
serve funds. That is all. If the board of direc
tors of the Bookstore decides not to continue the
gift, and not to increase the reserve funds any
more, there will be no income tax to pay. This
can be done. Perhaps it will be done. Income
lax would thereby be entirely eliminated.
A new Bookstore building Is planned. This
will be owned by the University and leased to

the Bookstore corporation. Rent paid to the Uni
versity will amortize the building and pay inter
est on the University's investment. The rent
paid by tlie Bookstore on the new building will
increase operating expenses, and so will take a
slice out of the net margin. This will tend to
reduce rebates. But it will also make it unneces
sary to set aside further building reserve funds.
This will help increase rebates. The net effect
will probably be a reduction of rebates, but not
a very large reduction.
The Bookstore Corporation consists of about
.'{(i faculty men. They receive no pay or any kind
of remuneration. Five are elected to serve as a
board of directors. They, also, are unpaid. Their
only purpose is to operate the Bookstore for the
benefit of the students and faculty. There is no
financial profit to the corporation, to the direc
tors, or to anyone else.
Any suggestion of diverting "Bookstore prof
its to any other purpose is quile idle. There is
no profit.
