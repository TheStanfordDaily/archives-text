# Moot Court Hears Negligency Case In Semi-Finals
## 
### 
Last night in Moot Court six
second-year law students debat
ed whether or not a doctor, a
nurse and a hospital were negli
gent in leaving a six-inch surgi
cal clamp in a patient for six
months.
The students are competing in
the semi-finals of the Marion
Rice Kirkood Moot Court Compe
tition, which will continue tonight
at 7:30.
William Abbott, co-counsel for
â™¦he defense, attempted to show
that the nurse, Kay Pogatschnik,
was not negligent, since she did
not place any clamps inside that
patient, Grace Leonard.
Then one of the judges said
with a grin, "Maybe she dropped
the clamp in." Me remarked that
since the organs were figura
tively lying all over the operat
ing table "the clamp might have
been packed in with them."
Later Abbott attempted to
show that the testimony of Dr.
Lacy, fine of the doctors involved
in the operation, should be admit
ted in part because of his candor
in court.
