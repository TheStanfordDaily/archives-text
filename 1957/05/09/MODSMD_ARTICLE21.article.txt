# Steve Tallent Serves Freelen, LASSU, Cabinet as Administrative Assistant
## 
### Rich Broun 
When ASSU President Rob
Freelen's phone gave one of its
frequent jangles, Administrative
Assistant Steve Tallent picked it
up, expecting to handle some
more student body business.
Half an hour later he was able
to set down the receiver, after fi
nally convincing the caller that
the ASSU did not furnish free
psychiatrists and that he was not
interested in giving psychiatric
advice.

It's all in a day's work for Tal
lent. The 19-year-old, Nebraska
born sophomore spends six to
seven hours a day, six days a
week—without pay—at his job of
helping President Freelen.
He is the second person to hold
the position of administrative as
sistant since it was created in
1955. When the new constitution
was adopted the old office of stu
dent manager was split into stu
dent financial manager and ad
ministrative assistant.
"First Duty"
"My first duty, of course, is to
be the president's assistant and
adviser," he said. "This includes
preparing any needed materials
and representing the president at
public functions.
Tallent's executive responsibil
ities involve co-ordinating vari
ous projects and carrying out
Freelen's policies.
In addition to these duties he
is executive secretary to boih the
Legislature and Cabinet. The
Cabinet, incidentally, is com
posed of the four class presidents
and the heads of the eight admin
istrative boards, such as Ram's
Head and Cardinals.
One of Tallent's duties to the
Legislature is to see that all laws
conform to the ASSU Constitu
tion.
"I serve only at the discretion
of the president," Tallent ex
plained. "One aspect of an as
sistant's .job is always to agree
with the president in public."
Unanimous Vote
The administrative assistant,
who is a non-voting member of
Legislature, must be approved by
that body after his nomination
by the president. Tallent re
ceived a unanimous vote. Until
recently, he also served as Legis
lature parliamentarian.

Tallent, who is a member of El
Tigre eating club, may usually
be found in Freelen's office,
above the Student Union barber
shop.
During his high school days in
Arcadia, Tallent was active in
Junior Statesmen of America. He
was the first lieutenant governor
in the history of the state organ
ization to succeed himself to the
governorship.
Commenting on his ASSU job,
with its many aspects and many
hours of work, Tallent suggested
that "there really should be more
assistants to the president."
