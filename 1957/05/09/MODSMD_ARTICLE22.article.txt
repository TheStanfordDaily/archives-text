# FOREIGN VIEWS
## New Magazine Needs Only Name, Funds 
### Helen Guerrant 
Stanford a new interna
tional magazine all except for a
name and funds to make publi
cation possible.
Marcelino Foronda, a graduate
student from the Philippines, is
editor of the magazine, with Lo
ren Mac Arthur and Gay Kopesak
on the editorial staff.
The purpose of the magazine,
Foronda said, is to further the
cause of international under
standing by allowing the Stan
ford foreign student to express
his views on life in America and
at Stanford, by giving the Ameri
can student an opportunity to tell
of his travel and study abroad
and by reporting on the activities
of foreign alumni groups.
For Students Too
The magazine, unlike the Stan
ford Review, is intended not only
for international alumni but for
students, both American and for
eign, who are interested in for
eign affairs.
The first issue of the magazine
will come out this quarter if suf
ficient funds are obtained, Fo
ronda said.
It will consist mainly of fea
tures: an American student's ac
count of his experiences in Aus
tria, a story on the Institute of
International Relations and the
"I" Club and an illustrated fea
ture on the Model United Na
tions.
Former Exchange Students
Also included will be an arti
cle on former exchange students
at Stanford, a report on campus
activities (with a slant for inter
national alumni) and a feature
on a distinguished international
professor here.
Foronda hopes that the maga
zine can be published quarterly,
and that in the future it may be
self-supporting and published ev
ery month. There has not been
much reaction yet, he said, prob
ably because of lack of student
knowledge about the magazine.
Articles are written by volun
teers, who Foronda said are will
ing. Still, there is a need for staff
members, for the majority of
Ihose on the staff now will not
be at Stanford next year. For
eign students .especially are
asked to help work on the maga
zine.
