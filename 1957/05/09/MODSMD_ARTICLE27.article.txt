Baseball seasons have a habit ol rolling merrily along and then
suddenly coming down to hinge on a few last games. That's the
case for coach Dutch Fehring's varsity nine this year. This is THE
BIG baseball weekend lor Stanford.
Tomorrow the Tribe will take on first-place, defending CIBA
champion Southern California on the Sunken Diamond. Saturday,
the Cards' close out their regular conference slate with a home
double-header against second-place California. With USC ineligible
for NCAA compel it ion, the berth is left to either the Indians <7-(>>
or Cal (7-4).
Three itoh Leopolds would he the perfect solution tor the prob
lem facing Fehring. The biy sophomore left-hander threw a no-hit,
no run game at IJSC in his first conference game'and has since
set down Cal, 10-1 anil 21. In four ( litA games, "Kuhe" has given
â€¢i|i only one earned rim, for a healthy 0 25 ERA.
Southern Cal has its own sophomore lefty to put up against Leo
pold in Dale Ziegler. Ziegler tops the loop's hurlers with a 4-0 won
lost record and triumphed over Stanford, 11-1, last month. Ziegler
has forced Ed Isherowod, an all-conference selection last season, to
take the No. 2 spot on the Trojan staff. An impressive surprise last
week in relief against UCLA was sophomore right-hander Bill Thorn,
another fire bailer who may see action.
USC lost most of the hitting punch with which it swatted its way
to the CIBA crown last season, but the Trojans have still clobbered
most conference pitchers. Alter taking the title last year, they were
upset for the Coast title by Washington State.
Cal slill has supporters who are calling the Bear's the best club
in the loop. George Wolfman's club has a fine one-two hurling
punch in righties Doug Weiss and Gene Stang. Against other clubs,
the Berkeley hitting attack has Ireen tremendous, but Leopold seems
to <lo something to the Bear swatter's . . . namely, throw it right
by them.
Weiss was Leopold's opponent in both Cal (ills. In the first
game he was clobbered royally by the free-swinging Cards and il
was no contest. Last Saturday, he was considerably tougher, los
ing on a squeeze hunt.
Of coulse, he did have the Tribe "popping up" on occasion, such
as the lime in the sixth inning when Parker Olsen, with runners on
first and second, blasted what may have been the hardest-hit ball
ol the afternoon. The Bears' eenterfielder, Bernie Kelly, would have
been better off to have bought a ticket and come into the ball park,
but he insisted on waiting for Olsen out in the far corners of Ed
wards Field. He caught the ball, of course . . . but he still had to
run back for it.
This year's Card nine has absorbed some tough losses, such as
the 4-3 and 2-0 decisions dropped to Santa Clara and the 1.-0 loss to
Earl Fordham and UCLA. With a few more timely hits, the Tribe
would mow be sporting a 10-3 record and it would be Cal and USC
doing the chasing.
Stanford has been without a CIBA or Coast crown since 1053,
when Jack Shcpard and Chuck lisscgian led a club called by many
the finest ever on the Farm. That team had to pass up the NCAA
tesl because the tourney was during finals week. That's the case
this year, too, and should the Cards nose out Cal, they may be
forced to bypass the big chance.
A clean sweep this weekend ould assure the Indians of at least a
tie for the NCAA berth and the right to oppose the Northern Divi
sion champ. It's a big assignment.
Outside of Leopold, veteran right-hander Walt Payne (no rela
tion to this writer) has been the most consistent Tribe hurler. Ed
Verdurmen and George Avery also have shown flashes of brilliance
this season.
In all, the club has been a great mixture of "youth" and veterans.
The veterans: Rudy Figueroa, A 1 Shaw, Steve Stewart, Bob Fletcher
and Ralph Holding, have had great years. The newcomers: Parker
Olsen, Rich DeFabio, Joel Newkirk, Art Von Wronski and Leopold,
have performed beyond expectations.
Olsen, with three home runs in the past five games, is being
called the "new Essegian" and this weekend may get his last
chance of the season to join the charmed circle of those who have
belted one of the Sunken Diamond's distant walls.
Despite the few narrow losses, it has been a good year for the
Indian baseballers. This weekend stands between a "good" year and
a "great" year. No doubt a little support, in numbers, mighl be of
some help.
