# Herb Score's Eye Improved, Sight Recovery Still Doubtful
## 
### 
CLEVELAND, May 8 (IIP)
From his hospital bed where he
lay fearfully hopeful that he will
not lose the sight of his injured
right eye, Herb Score of the.ln
dians sent a message today to
anguished Gil McDougald of the
Yankees:
"Tell Mac not to worry. Tt was
n't his fault."
McDougald. whose line drive
struck Score in Ihe face and
caused a severe eye injury Tues
day night, had said somberly in
ihe dressing room after the
game: "If he loses his sight, I'll
quit this game. It is not thai im
portant when it gets to this."
Early this morning, McDou
gald, accompanied by teammates
Yogi Berra and Hank Bauer,
drove to Lakeside Hospital to
visit Score. They were not per
mitted to enter Ihe 23-year-old
left-hander's room, but Score
sent McDougald his consoling
words by a nurse.
The three players then went to
Ihe home of Dr. Charles Thomas,
Cleveland eye specialist who
treated Score, to learn what they
could about the pitcher's condi
tion.
Dr. Thomas reiterated that "It
will be two days possibly a
week before an accurate diag
nosis can be taken."
"Score needs rest and quiet
and is to have no visitors," the
physician said. "His condition
shows considerable improvement
this morning over what it was

la.st night, although it was very
uncomfortable."
Dr. Thomas said the eye hem
orrhage was being absorbed fast
er than expected. He stressed,
however, that this should not be
taken as an encouraging sign.
The doctor said this meant only
(hat an earlier decision might be
made on ihe prospects of saving
Score's eyesight.
He said X-rays will be taken
Thusday after the residue from
ihe hemorrhage is sufficiently
absorbed to permit an accurate
picture.
McDougald said he spent a
restless night and slept only two
or three hours. After talking to
Dr. Thomas, he recanted his re
marks about quitting baseball.
"II was a spur-of-the-moment
thing," the Yankee shortstop
said. "Things look better today.
'When those things happen,
you feel as 1 hough maybe it's
better if you're the one who is
hurt."

and is to have no visitors," the
physician said. "His condition
shows considerable improvement
this morning over what it was

la.st night, although it was very
uncomfortable."
Dr. Thomas said the eye hem
orrhage was being absorbed fast

however, that this should not be
taken as an encouraging sign.
The doctor said this meant only

made on ihe prospects of saving
Score's eyesight.

absorbed to permit an accurate
picture.
McDougald said he spent a
restless night and slept only two
or three hours. After talking to
Dr. Thomas, he recanted his re
marks about quitting baseball.

said. "Things look better today.

CLEVELAND, May 8 (IIP)
From his hospital bed where he
lay fearfully hopeful that he will
not lose the sight of his injured
right eye, Herb Score of the.ln
dians sent a message today to
anguished Gil McDougald of the
Yankees:
"Tell Mac not to worry. Tt was
n't his fault."
McDougald. whose line drive
struck Score in Ihe face and
caused a severe eye injury Tues
day night, had said somberly in
ihe dressing room after the
game: "If he loses his sight, I'll
quit this game. It is not thai im
portant when it gets to this."
Early this morning, McDou
gald, accompanied by teammates
Yogi Berra and Hank Bauer,
drove to Lakeside Hospital to
visit Score. They were not per
mitted to enter Ihe 23-year-old
left-hander's room, but Score
sent McDougald his consoling
words by a nurse.
The three players then went to
Ihe home of Dr. Charles Thomas,
Cleveland eye specialist who
treated Score, to learn what they
could about the pitcher's condi
tion.
Dr. Thomas reiterated that "It
will be two days possibly a
week before an accurate diag
nosis can be taken."
