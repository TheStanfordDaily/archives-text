# TERMAN'S OFFICE
## No. 10 Inner Quad Focus Of Stanford 
### Camille Petersen 
As No. If) Downing Street is
the seat of the English govern
ment, so No. 10 Inner Quad is the
home of the Stanford Adminis
tration. Here is found the office
of Provost Frederick Terman.
Terman, who received the
Ph.D. degree from the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology,
first came to the Stanford cam
pus more than 45 years ago
when his father, Dr. Lewis Ter
man, joined the staff of the
School of Education in 1910.
Head of Engineering
In 1925 Terman joined the elec
trical engineering staff and in
1937 he was made head of the de
partment. Then came World War
II and a call to help set up and
manage an unidentified defense
project at Harvard.
The project, counter measures
against enemy radar, was so se
cret that he was not informed as
to its nature before he accepted
the appointment nor could he in
form prospective employees be
fore he hired them.
To Confuse Enemy
The project wan responsible
for the adoption of dropping alu
minum strips from airplanes to
confuse enemy radar and vari
ous methods of jamming the sets.
Civilian technicians were sent
into the field to help the military
install, operate and observe new
counter-measure equipment. The
technicians were guests of the
military, wearing officers' uni
forms with no insignia, but they
had to arrange for their own
transportation. Some of the
alumni from the project are here
at Stanford.
While at Harvard, Terman
was made Dean of Engineering
at Stanford. He assumed his new
duties when he returned to cam
pus in 1946.
Ilis Main Concern
Since he became provost in
1955, he has been concerned
primarily with academic mat
ters. He becomes acting presi
dent when President Sterling is
absent.
The non-academic affairs are
attended to by. President Ster
ling's two assistants, Frederic
Glover and Kenneth Cuthbertson.
Terman has recently been
elected chairman of the National
Research Advisory Committee,
the senior scientific advisory
group of the United States Navy.
