## Baxter Says Modern Artists Stress Structure, Not Content 
### John Lane 
The attention of the contemporary art world is shifting from what
is represented in a painting to the structure of the painting itself,
said John R. Baxter, education curator of the San Francisco Museum
of art, in his talk yesterday in Cubberley Auditorium.
The talk was sponsored by the Stanford Committee for Art.

Tho lecture—on the subject of
"Foreign Influences Upon 20th
Century American Painting," il
lustrated with slides of represent
ative modern paintings was at
tended by an audience of about
250 people.
In explaining the modern view
toward art, Baxter quoted the
French artist Matisse. Upon be
ing told that a picture he had
painted did not look like a wom
an, which it was supposed to be.
Matisse answered, "It's not a
woman; it's a picture."
Art Broadened
"The total body of American
art has been broadened by the
influx of foreign art," said Bax
ter. He noted that the greatest
influence in the past 50 years has
been exerted by artists studying
under the French school, although
they may not have been French
themselves.
The influence of the Mexican
school, with artists such as Diego
Rivera, has also been great, and
some influence has been felt from
the Germans and the Orient.
In explaining the "influence" of
foreign art on America, Baxter
stressed that such influence "does
not mean that the artist copies
the foreign model." He noted the
case of Van Gogh's study of the
Japanese style in his explanation.
Paintings "Horrible"
So long as Van Gogh copied the
Japanese style, he said, the paint
ings were "horrible." As soon as
the style became actually part of
his own he became one of the few
people to make a real addition to
the history of art.
Art is continuous, said Baxter,
and every school is influenced in
some part by the others.
The lecture was followed by a
series of slides demonstrating for
eign influence by matching works
by contemporary Americans with
ones painted by members of the
foreign school by which the Amer
ican could have been influenced.

Art Broadened
"The total body of American
art has been broadened by the
influx of foreign art," said Bax
ter. He noted that the greatest
influence in the past 50 years has
been exerted by artists studying
under the French school, although
they may not have been French
themselves.
The influence of the Mexican
school, with artists such as Diego
Rivera, has also been great, and
some influence has been felt from
the Germans and the Orient.
In explaining the "influence" of
foreign art on America, Baxter
stressed that such influence "does
not mean that the artist copies
the foreign model." He noted the
case of Van Gogh's study of the
Japanese style in his explanation.
Paintings "Horrible"
So long as Van Gogh copied the
Japanese style, he said, the paint
ings were "horrible." As soon as
the style became actually part of
his own he became one of the few
people to make a real addition to
the history of art.
Art is continuous, said Baxter,
and every school is influenced in
some part by the others.
The lecture was followed by a
series of slides demonstrating for
eign influence by matching works
by contemporary Americans with
ones painted by members of the
foreign school by which the Amer
ican could have been influenced.
