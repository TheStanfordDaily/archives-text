# Valuable Slugs
## 
### 
Eugene T. Jilg, gradual' student, puts uranium sings into metal
rods under Mechanical Engineering Professor George Leppert's
supervision. Two tons of such eight-inch slugs, worth $HO,(K>O, will
power a sub-critical reactor assembly now being readied for nu
clear engineering studies. The metal is a loan from the Atomic
Energy Commission. The sub-critical assembly will be the first
one built for educational use in the West.
