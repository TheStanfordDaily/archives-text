THE THUNDERING MARCH
OF PROGRESS
Today, as everyone knows, is the forty-sixth anni
versary of the founding of Gransmire College for Women
which, as everyone knows, was the first Progressive
Education college in the United States.
Well do I recollect the tizzy in the academic world
when Gransmire first opened its portals! What a buzz
there was, what a brouhaha in faculty common rooms,
what a rattling of teacups, when Dr. Agnes Thudd Siga
foos, first president of Gransmire, lifted her shaggy head
and announced defiantly, "This here is no stuffy, old
fashioned college. This here, by gum, is Progressive
Education. We will teach the student, not the course.
There will be no marks, no exams, no requirements. We
will break the iron mold of orthodoxy, hey."
»
Well sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country
cast off their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire
to enroll at Gransmire. Here they found freedom. They
broadened their vistas. They lengthened their horizons.
They unstopped their bottled personalities. They roamed
the campus in togas, leading ocelots on leashes.
And, of course, they smoked Philip Morris. (I say
"of course." Why do I say "of course"? I say "of course"
because it is a matter of course that anyone in search
of freedom should naturally turn to Philip Morris, for
Philip Morris-is a natural smoke, with no filter to get
in the way of its true tobacco taste.)
But all was not Philip Morris and ocelots. There was
work and study too — not in the ordinary sense, for thfcre
were no formal classes. Instead there was a broad
approach to enlarging each girl's potentials.

Take, for example, the course called B.M.S. (Basic
Motor Skills). B.M.S. was divided into L.D. (Lying
Down), S.IJ. (Standing Up) and W. (Walking). Once
the student had mastered L.I), and S.U., she was taught
to W. — but not just to W. any old way! No, sir! She
was taught to W. with poise, dignity, bearing! To incul
cate a sense of balance in the girl, she began her exercises
by walking with a suitcase in each hand. (One girl, Mary
Kllen Dorgenicht, got so good at it that today she is bell
captain at the Dinkier-Plaza Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia.)
When the girls had walking under their belts, they
were allowed to dance. Again no formality was imposed.
They were simply told to fling themselves about in any
way their impulses dictated, and believe you me, it was
((uile an impressive sight to see them go bounding into
the woods with their togas flying. (Several later joined
the U. S. Forestry Service.)
There was also a lot of finger painting and gourd
rattling and sculpture with coat hangers and all like that,
and soon the fresh wind of Progressivism came whistling
out of Gransmirc to blow the ancient dust of pedantry
off curricula everywhere, and today, thanks to the pio
neers at Gransmirc, we are all free, every man-jack of us.
If you are ever in New Hampshire, he sure to visit
the Gransmire campus. It is now a tannery.

THE THUNDERING MARCH
OF PROGRESS
Today, as everyone knows, is the forty-sixth anni
versary of the founding of Gransmire College for Women
which, as everyone knows, was the first Progressive
Education college in the United States.
Well do I recollect the tizzy in the academic world
when Gransmire first opened its portals! What a buzz
there was, what a brouhaha in faculty common rooms,
what a rattling of teacups, when Dr. Agnes Thudd Siga
foos, first president of Gransmire, lifted her shaggy head
and announced defiantly, "This here is no stuffy, old
fashioned college. This here, by gum, is Progressive
Education. We will teach the student, not the course.
There will be no marks, no exams, no requirements. We
will break the iron mold of orthodoxy, hey."
»
Well sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country
cast off their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire
to enroll at Gransmire. Here they found freedom. They
broadened their vistas. They lengthened their horizons.
They unstopped their bottled personalities. They roamed
the campus in togas, leading ocelots on leashes.
And, of course, they smoked Philip Morris. (I say
"of course." Why do I say "of course"? I say "of course"
because it is a matter of course that anyone in search
of freedom should naturally turn to Philip Morris, for
Philip Morris-is a natural smoke, with no filter to get
in the way of its true tobacco taste.)
But all was not Philip Morris and ocelots. There was
work and study too — not in the ordinary sense, for thfcre
were no formal classes. Instead there was a broad
approach to enlarging each girl's potentials.

Take, for example, the course called B.M.S. (Basic
Motor Skills). B.M.S. was divided into L.D. (Lying
Down), S.IJ. (Standing Up) and W. (Walking). Once
the student had mastered L.I), and S.U., she was taught
to W. — but not just to W. any old way! No, sir! She
was taught to W. with poise, dignity, bearing! To incul
cate a sense of balance in the girl, she began her exercises
by walking with a suitcase in each hand. (One girl, Mary
Kllen Dorgenicht, got so good at it that today she is bell
captain at the Dinkier-Plaza Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia.)
When the girls had walking under their belts, they
were allowed to dance. Again no formality was imposed.
They were simply told to fling themselves about in any
way their impulses dictated, and believe you me, it was
((uile an impressive sight to see them go bounding into
the woods with their togas flying. (Several later joined
the U. S. Forestry Service.)
There was also a lot of finger painting and gourd
rattling and sculpture with coat hangers and all like that,
and soon the fresh wind of Progressivism came whistling
out of Gransmirc to blow the ancient dust of pedantry
off curricula everywhere, and today, thanks to the pio
