at 3 p.m. were $(>6OO.
Of that ligure, $1018 was raised through off-campus solicitations
conducted by freshman couples.

campus solicitations to better last year's figure after including the
money expected to come in last night.
Roble women were reported to have brought in $1887, Branner
$l;)3f> and Union $.>95. Gold said that if smaller Branner should pass
Roble in total collections it would be the first time in the history
of the drive.
