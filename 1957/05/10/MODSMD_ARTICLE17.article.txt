## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. May 9 (UP)—
A move to limit use of the death
penalty in California for a six
year period today won the ap
proval of the Assembly.
The measure, AB 1225 by As
semblyman Lester McMillan (D-
Los Angeles), was approved by
a 43-29 vote and sent to the Sen
ate after heated debate.
While the bill originally called
for a flat moratorium on capital
punishment, subsequent amend
ments now provide for the gas
chamber in four instances.
Four Instances
Kidnap - killers, convicts who
assault guards, persons who are
convicted for a second time of
first-degree murder and felons
who kill in an attempt to break
prison would be subject to the
death sentence.
During the moratorium period,
a person normally subject to the
death penalty would be sen
tenced to life with no parole.
Parole Chance
In situations where either life
or death may now be sentenced,
the punishment could be life with
full or restricted parole. Under
the latter, a criminal would have
to serve 2A years and could be
paroled only after the unanimous
recommendation of the adult au
thority and five justices of the
State Supreme Court. The bill
would have no effect on the gov
ernor's powers of pardon.
