# Possible NCAA Title Bid At Stake as Bear, Trojan Diamondmen Meet Indians
## Leopold, Payne, ??? to Be Shuffled Cards as Hill Dilemma Faces Tribe 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
How to stretch two top hurlers over three games played in the
space of 24 hours is the problem confronting varsity baseball coach
Dutch Fehring.
This afternoon at 3:15 in Sunken Diamond the Indians face the
mighty league - leading Trojans of Southern Cal. Undoubtedly the

men ol Troy will be out to
avenge the no • hit, no - run 4-0
shutout they suffered the last
time the two teams met.
Tomorrow at 1:30 Cal blows
in for a doubleheader with the
Cards with even more cause for
revenge. In their two outings
against the Cards this season the
Bears have dropped 10-1 and 2-1
odecisions.
Fehr in g has his two top
l moundsmen — right-handed Walt
Payne and lefty Bob Leopold—
rested and ready to go. But who
will pitch the third contest?
Daily's Solution
The Daily inadvertently sup
plied the answer last Friday by
I accidentally printing a picture of
Leopold in reverse causing him
to appear as a right-handed hurl
er. The picture did cause Fehring
to do some wishful thinking and
he mumbled something about an
"ambidextrous pitcher," but the
problem still exists.
USC is way out in front in Cl-
BA play with a 9-2 record and ap
pears a cinch to nab thai title.
I The Bears have a 7-4 record and
the Indians are 7-6.
The Trojans have five games
remaining: two against last
place Santa Clara, two with Cal
in Los Angeles and Friday's
game with the Indians. USC,
however, is ineligible for the
NCAA playoffs.
Complicated Set-up
To further complicate the trial
ter, the Northern Division of the
PCC doesn't recognize the ("IBA
and demands to play the winner
of the Southern Division PCC
title.
Omi 11 in g the Santa Clara
games to determine the Southern
i PCC standings, USC is 7-2 with
I two games left at home with Cal
! and one against Stanford. The
Cards are in the second spot with
a 5-4 record with this weekend's
three games yet to be played. Cal
has a 4-4 record with the double
' header against Stanford and two
games with USC next weekend
in L.A.
Thus if the Cards should
sweep all three games this week
end and Cal and USC should split
next weekend Stanford and Troy
would he tied for the Southern
Division title wilh identical 8-4
records.
Troy Ineligible
Since USC is ineligible for NC
AA play they would probably
step aside and let Stanford play
ihe Northern Division winner
(Oregon is leading) for the PCC
crown. This year the PCC play
off games will be held in the
Southern Division winner's site.
Just what the Trojans will do,
or be allowed to do, if they win
the Southern Division title out
right remains to be seen. USC
coach .Rod Dedeaux, who is
chairman of this area's NCAA
selection committee, says he
hopes that some arrangements
can be perfected so that his team
can play for the PCC crown.
What if Troy Wins?
If USC does get to play for the
PCC crown what will happen it
they win? Will the loser have toj
play the second team in the
Southern Division to determine
who will go to the NCAA play
offs.?
And what if USC should get to
play for the crown and lose? If j
Oregon is the Northern Division
winner will they automatically
get to go to the playoffs? If it is

LOregon, Stanford will still have
some right to challenge since
I ; ihey beat the Ducks twice ear
j lier in the season.
! Another factor to consider in
| this baseball problem that is as
confusing as three runners on
j third base is the time element.
The PCC playoffs are scheduled
for May 31 and June 1 and the
NCAA championships will be
held June 8-13. Will there be
| time for all these possible PCC
I playoffs?
Pitching Secrets
All Stanford can do is play to
win and hope for Ihe best. Just
what Fehring will do in the way
i of pitchers this weekend remains
; to he seen. The eagy coach is not
going to commit himself in order
to keep Cal off balance.
When Cal squares off against
Santa Clara this afternoon Bear
coach George Wolfman will have
| to decide whether to try to slip
| past the Broncos with his num
ber three pitcher or go for a
; "sure win" with one of his top
I two hurlers.
This week's Cal press release
says that Wolfman will- send
number-two pitcher Gene Stang
* against the Broncos and pitch
number - one boy Doug Weiss
against the Indians in the first
contest. The release goes on to
say that he will choose from
among Chuck Becker, Kim El
j liott and George Sterling for Ihe
second Card tilt.
However, press releases can be
i very misleading and often any
similarity between them and ac
tual happenings are purely coin
cidental.
Newspaper Talk
San Francisco newspapers are
predicting that Fehring will go
with either Payne or Leopold
this afternoon in an effort to
slow down the front-running Tro
jans. However, this would en
able Cal to definitely use a top
pitcher against Santa Clara and
counter 1 the Cards' third hurler,
probably Ed Verdurmen, with :
their number three man.
No matter from which angle
one considers the situation, it
poses quite a problem. If you
j think you have the solution
please contact coach Fehring
ANYTIME before 3:1 5 this after
noon. See you in the Sunken
! I )iamond.
