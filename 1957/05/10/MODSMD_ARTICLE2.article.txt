# Possible NCAA Title Bid At Stake as Bear, Trojan Diamondmen Meet Indians
## Leopold, Payne, ??? to Be Shuffled Cards as Hill Dilemma Faces Tribe 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
How to stretch two top hurlers over three games played in the
space of 24 hours is the problem confronting varsity baseball coach
Dutch Fehring.
This afternoon at 3:15 in Sunken Diamond the Indians face the
mighty league - leading Trojans of Southern Cal. Undoubtedly the

men ol Troy will be out to
avenge the no • hit, no - run 4-0
shutout they suffered the last
time the two teams met.
Tomorrow at 1:30 Cal blows
in for a doubleheader with the
Cards with even more cause for
revenge. In their two outings
against the Cards this season the
Bears have dropped 10-1 and 2-1
odecisions.
Fehr in g has his two top
l moundsmen — right-handed Walt

The Daily inadvertently sup

he mumbled something about an
"ambidextrous pitcher," but the
problem still exists.
USC is way out in front in Cl-
BA play with a 9-2 record and ap

I The Bears have a 7-4 record and
the Indians are 7-6.
The Trojans have five games
remaining: two against last
place Santa Clara, two with Cal
in Los Angeles and Friday's
game with the Indians. USC,
however, is ineligible for the
NCAA playoffs.
Complicated Set-up
To further complicate the trial
ter, the Northern Division of the
PCC doesn't recognize the ("IBA
and demands to play the winner
of the Southern Division PCC
title.
Omi 11 in g the Santa Clara
games to determine the Southern
i PCC standings, USC is 7-2 with
I two games left at home with Cal
! and one against Stanford. The
Cards are in the second spot with
a 5-4 record with this weekend's
three games yet to be played. Cal
has a 4-4 record with the double
