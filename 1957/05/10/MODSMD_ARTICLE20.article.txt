# Necessary Precautions
## 
### 
Tiiou shut not steal. And take care that
nothing be stolen from thee. Last Saturday an
automobile, two wallets and a purse were re
ported missing from Lake Lagunita. Since last
September about $1000 worth of furniture—
sofas and chairs—have been taken from Stem
Hall lounges. Much is still missing.
A student who left his wallet on his desk in
his room while taking a shower reported that
the money lie had had in it was gone when he
returned. Last year students in Wilbur and-
Stern who wore extra-thick-lens glasses found
the glasses had been taken from their rooms
•luring their sleep.
\\ e don't think there is much need for ser
monizing Stanford students not to steal. Most
of us follow the Fundamental Standard and
Honor < lode as il should be followed. But there
mav be need for a word of warning.
There is no way to gauge how much mischief

ol 11 lis sort is perpetrated by professionals and
lio\v much by students. We have learned to
trust our fellow students to a great extent. The
point is 111;»I our t rust should not lead us to
carelessness with our valuables. In the infor
mal atmosphere <»l a university campus the
professional thiel can have a field day. It is
his favorite game when invading a university
campus to pass himself ofl as one of the Btu
dents and wreak havoc.
10 take precautions with personal posses
sions is only half (lie battle. If a student is
missing any valuables, lie should report the
loss immediately lo the Stanford Police Depart
ment. Objects whieh otherwise might be re
trieved may be lost forever if not quickly
reported.
11 takes but a moment to loek the door after
you leave your room. Il takes hut a few mo
ments In report a theft. I lie effort is minimal;
the rewards are incalculable.
