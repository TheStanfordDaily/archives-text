Hard Losers
Editor, The Daily:
Some people are hard losers. For the past few
years the law school and medical school faculties
have engaged in friendly golf matches. We have
met three times, and the law school has natu
rally been victorious on each occasion. Last
week my colleagues and I were shocked and sad
dened by the intemperate remarks of Professor
Robson of the medical school which were pub
lished in your columns. What we had thought
of as a pleasant afternoon's diversion has appar
ently been laken too seriously by our hyper
tense colleagues, to the point where they even
accuse us of low tactics. T suppose it is typical
of those who would win at any cost to assume
the same attitude in their opponents.
We lawyers like to think of golf as just, after
all, a game. If some of those chaps up in the
medical school wish to go out and knock the ball
about a bit we will be happy to join them. How
ever. May 23 is a bar! day for us since school
will still 1)0 in session. We will all be much too
busy to do any golfing until after the examina
tions. Presumably there is some adequate rea
son why the medical school faculty feels no simi
lar obligation to its student body. I propose
that we arrange to play on Thursday, June 13.
Professor Robson complained rather bitterly
that we used some non-lawyers in previous
matches with them. Since every M.D. in North
em California and Nevada is listed on the fac
ulty of the Stanford Medical School, and since
each of them apparently does litile but play golf,
I he medical school has descended on us with
teams of fantastic size. There are only a few of
us at the law school, and of these only six or
seven have ever swung a golf club. Even so, we
were able to defeat* the medical school legions
after they had stolen former Assistant Law
School Dean Sandy Tatum tjrom our group. (Ta
turn, of course, is no longer with us.) We can
avoid this kind of problem in the future by re
stricting competition to the full-time faculties.
While i know this is a euphemism when applied

to medical school professors it should be possible
to distinguish between those formally described
as full-time teachers and the hundreds of prac
ticing doctors who drop in at the school once a
year.
The tendency toward over-emphasis on ath
letics is one which tho law school has always
resisted. I hope the medical school faculty will
join us in a more rational approach to what,
after all, is only intended to be recreation.

A Mild Shock
Editor, The Daily:
Last Friday (May 3) T was invited by Ihe
Cosmo Club to address ihe group on the com
plexities of Ihe relationships between American
students and foreign students.
It comes as a mild shock to me to learn that
some of ihe foreign students present have at
tributed certain remarks to me which are not
based on what I know to be true. Al all events,
whether my presentation lacked clarity or the
syntax was an obstacle, I should like to reaffirm
at this moment what I recall having said.
Question from one of the students (at best this
is a paraphrasing ot it): "What do you believe
is to be gained by having foreign students on
our campus?"
My reply: "1 am convinced that the American
student is enriched by coming in contact with
the foreign sludent and that if this basic prin
ciple weren t true, then the Stanford program of
bringing toreign scholars to our campus would
be based on fraudulent premises. I, for one,
do not believe that our program is fraudulent."
Now then, I should be loath to have offended
any foreign student in our midst, especially
when there is absolutely no justifiable cause to
do so. Should any of the students harbor the
least doubt concerning my intent and deed, I in
vite each one to come to my office (Room 247)
for a chat with me about it.
