# Stanford Drove Golden Spike Eighty-eight Years Ago Today
## Central, Union Pacific Railroads Joined in Utah; Spike, Sledgehammer Now Housed in Museum 
### Dave Canfield 
In a lonely £ap in the yellowed
hills north of Great Salt Lake,
Utah Territory, KK years ago to
day, a motley crowd of workers,
celebrities and hangers-on lined
the railroad track and two en
gines faced each other like angry
bulls.
The date was May 10, 1809, the
place was Promontory Point,
Utah Territory, the central fig
ure in the scene was the founder
of this University.
Leland Stanford poised a silver
sledgehammer on his shoulder
and drove into a California laurel
tie the golden "Last Spike" that
united the Central Pacific and
Union Pacific railroads and lied
the nation together with bands
of steel.
By special telegraph wires con
nected to the spike, the tap-tap of
Stanford's hammer sent a click
click over ihe wires and flashed
to the nation the one-word mes
sage "Done." (Some sources have
said Stanford nervously missed
the gilt spike on his first swing.)
Central Pacific's bonnet
stacked, woodburning locomotive
"Jupiter" and Union Pacific's
narrow-stacked coalburning No.
119 then moved up so their 1 pilots
touched.
Men brandishing champagne
bottles clambered aboard the
cowcatchers and had their pic
lures taken for posterity.
The two chief engineers, S. S.
Montague of the C.P. and G.M.
Godge of the lI.P. shook hands,
and, as Stanford English Profes
sor Wallace Stegner has said,
"Chinese, Irishmen, politicians,
railroad officials, Mormon digni
taries, gamblers and sinful ladies
lrorn Corinne cheered." <('o
rinne, from 18(59 to 1903, was ;i
division point on the railroad.)
The pioneer section of the rail
road stands abandoned loday. In
1904 the Southern Pacific opened

,a shorter mainline across the
Jake on the trestle-fill Luoin Cut
, off.
The Promontory Point track
for 120 miles from Lucin to Co
rinne was unspiked in 1942 in a
war-salvage effort. Today Prom
! ontory is a ghost town and only
a pyramid • type concrete monu
ment remains to mark the his
toric spot.
On the pyramid is a plaque en
titled "The Last Spike" and. as
Stegner said in the May 1957
Holiday magazine, "caustic re
marks scribbled" by "disappoint
ed visitors."
The Golden Spike, which itself
was a gift from San Francisco's
David Hewes and which was
brought to the Point by Stanford
I aboard a special railroad car in
IXfi9, was uprooted right after
j the ceremonies for fear of theft.
It has been on display at vari
ous places, including the Pana
ma-Pacific International Exposi
tion at San Francisco in 1915.
Today the spike, in gilt glory
on black velvet cloth, stands en
shrined in a glass - front, four
foot-high steel vault in the Stan
lord Museum. Appearing on the
J spike are illegible inscriptions re
sembling signatures. No marks
remain where Stanford drove it
in or where the lelegraph wires
I were connected.
In a nearby glass case are the
silver shovel and sledgehammer
used by Stanford and a silver
spike given by the State of Ne
vada. On the silver spike is this
inscription:
"To Leland Stanford, Presi
dent of the Central Pacific Rail
: road. To the iron of the east and
Ihe gold of the west Nevada adds
her link of silver to span the
continent and wed the oceans."

The Golden Spike, which itself
was a gift from San Francisco's
David Hewes and which was
brought to the Point by Stanford
I aboard a special railroad car in
IXfi9, was uprooted right after
j the ceremonies for fear of theft.
It has been on display at vari
ous places, including the Pana
ma-Pacific International Exposi
tion at San Francisco in 1915.
Today the spike, in gilt glory
on black velvet cloth, stands en
shrined in a glass - front, four
foot-high steel vault in the Stan
lord Museum. Appearing on the
J spike are illegible inscriptions re
sembling signatures. No marks
remain where Stanford drove it
in or where the lelegraph wires
I were connected.
In a nearby glass case are the
silver shovel and sledgehammer
used by Stanford and a silver
spike given by the State of Ne
vada. On the silver spike is this
inscription:
"To Leland Stanford, Presi
dent of the Central Pacific Rail
: road. To the iron of the east and
Ihe gold of the west Nevada adds
her link of silver to span the
continent and wed the oceans."
In a lonely £ap in the yellowed
hills north of Great Salt Lake,
Utah Territory, KK years ago to
day, a motley crowd of workers,
celebrities and hangers-on lined
the railroad track and two en
gines faced each other like angry
bulls.
The date was May 10, 1809, the
place was Promontory Point,
Utah Territory, the central fig
ure in the scene was the founder
of this University.
Leland Stanford poised a silver
sledgehammer on his shoulder
and drove into a California laurel
tie the golden "Last Spike" that
united the Central Pacific and
Union Pacific railroads and lied
the nation together with bands
of steel.
By special telegraph wires con
nected to the spike, the tap-tap of
Stanford's hammer sent a click
click over ihe wires and flashed
to the nation the one-word mes
sage "Done." (Some sources have
said Stanford nervously missed
the gilt spike on his first swing.)

narrow-stacked coalburning No.

The pioneer section of the rail
road stands abandoned loday. In

The Promontory Point track
for 120 miles from Lucin to Co
rinne was unspiked in 1942 in a
war-salvage effort. Today Prom

a pyramid • type concrete monu

On the pyramid is a plaque en

Stegner said in the May 1957
Holiday magazine, "caustic re
