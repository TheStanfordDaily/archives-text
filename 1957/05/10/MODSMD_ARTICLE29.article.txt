# Mermen Aim for 27th Straight In Dual Meet With Cal Bears
## 
### Jack Rannells 
And so, as the PCC dual meet season draws to a close, Coach Tom
Ilaynie's Stanford swimmers find the California Bear, beaten '18:58
a month ago, is the real threat to their 26-meet victory skein.
Stanford's varsity and freshman mermen meet; the Bears in
Berkeley tomorrow at 10 a.m. The meets will he run concurrently,

with the varsity and frosh alter
nating in each event.
The Bears have soundly beaten
UCLA and I.JSC since losing to
the Indians. Last week they
dunked USC 51-35. Haynie's
charges, meeting the Trojans the
next day, only ran up a 53-33
margin.
Key to Hopes
Again the key to Stanford
hopes is Lowell Johnson, who is
undefeated in dual competition
this year. Johnson must face the
Bears' ace, Ron Volmer, in Ihe
50- and 100-yard freestyle events.
Volmer broke California's rec
ords with his winning 22.8 and
51.4 clockings last Saturday.
Johnson's 22.0 and 52.0 wins
over Volmer in their last meet
ing provided a good share of Ihe
Indians' victory margin. He has
since lowered his century clock
ing to 51.1.
Burton Favored
Other probable Indian winners I
are Tom Burton in the 220 and '
440, although Mahoney could I
come through with a victory in
the longer event; Fred Miller in
the butterfly, and the 400-yard
freestyle team.
The Papooses beat Ihe Cubs i
last month, 18-38. It was in this
meet that 1 hoy set the new PCC
(and possibly NCAA) freshman
mark of 4:02.3 in the medley re
lay.
