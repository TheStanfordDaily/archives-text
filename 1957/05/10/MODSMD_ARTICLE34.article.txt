# Stanford Trackmen Meet World's Best In Record-Threatening Fresno Relays
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Nineteen Stanford trackmen
will compete wit h the world's
finest spikers tomorrow when
they travel to Fresno for' the an
nual West. Coast Relays in Rat
cliffe Stadium.
Operating under the slogan
"Where World's Records Are Bro
ken," this year's edition of the
Fresno event promises to be rro
exception. At least two world
marks, the 100 arrd the distance
medley relay, are considered in
definite jeopardy.
Payton Jordan has entered
Stanford men in three relays, all
six field events and two individ
ual races. Running for the Tribe
in the two running events will be
Chuck Cobb, Bernie Nelson and
Maury Graves.
(«raves in 5000
Graves will run in the 5000-
meter run. Last year he finished
third in tlie open division of this
race and was winner in the col
legiate division. This year, how
ever, Graves will have a tough
time defending his collegiate title.
The strong favorite in the long
grind will be Max Truex of South
ern California. He has already
cracked the national collegiate
two • mile record this year and
ranks as the best long-distance
running undergraduate in the U.S.
Cobb and Nelson will both go
in the 120-yard high hurdles. They
will have a rugged time winning,
however, with Fresno State's An
eel Robinson in the race. Robin
son has already r un under 14 this
year and beat both the Tribesmen
in a dual meet earlier this season.
In the meet's other individual
race, the 100-yard dash, prospects

are bright for the world mark of
9.3 to fall. The present mark was
first set at the West Coast .Relays
by Mel Patton.
Abilene Christian's Bobby Mor'-
row is given the best chance to
crack the mark. But he'll have to
be at full strength to beat Leamon
King and Mike Agostini, both co
holders of the current 9.3 stand
ard.
A world mark deemed almost
certain to fall is the distance med
ley relay record of 9:50.4, set two
years ago by Kansas. California,
Occidental, UCLA and the South
ern California stridors are all giv
en a good shot at the standard.
Three Relay Teams
Stanford will enter quartets in
the 440, 880 and mile relays, The
sprint team will be composed of
Jack Groat, Len Bates, Cobb and
Frank Herrmann.
Running for the 880 team will
be Groat, Chuck lnce, Don Ches
arek 4ml Herrmann. Bill Carls,
Joe Woollett, Bob Hyde and Che

sarek will combine on the four-lap
team.
The Indians will have plenty of
opportunities to pick up points in
the field events. Herrmann ranks
as a strong contender in the broad
jump off his recent leap of 25-Va .
In the j ave 1 in, Hank Roldan
should place if he can equal or
better his top mark of 2127-4
Felilen in Contention
Phil Fehlen, a consistent (>-6
high jumper and a potential 0-9
leaper, will be in the fight for
place points in his event. Charley
Dumas is considered an almost
sure winner and will be out to 1
lift his own world record of 7-Va. 1
Husky Fred Peters, among the
nation's best collegiate d is e us
throwers, will be out to place in
the platter event. He has thrown
172-8 this year, but may break
175 feet* tomorrow. •

Nineteen Stanford trackmen
will compete wit h the world's

Operating under the slogan
"Where World's Records Are Bro
ken," this year's edition of the
Fresno event promises to be rro
exception. At least two world
marks, the 100 arrd the distance
medley relay, are considered in
definite jeopardy.
Payton Jordan has entered
Stanford men in three relays, all
six field events and two individ
ual races. Running for the Tribe
in the two running events will be
Chuck Cobb, Bernie Nelson and
Maury Graves.
(«raves in 5000
Graves will run in the 5000-
meter run. Last year he finished
third in tlie open division of this
race and was winner in the col
legiate division. This year, how
ever, Graves will have a tough
time defending his collegiate title.
The strong favorite in the long
grind will be Max Truex of South
ern California. He has already
cracked the national collegiate
two • mile record this year and
ranks as the best long-distance
running undergraduate in the U.S.
Cobb and Nelson will both go
in the 120-yard high hurdles. They
will have a rugged time winning,
however, with Fresno State's An
eel Robinson in the race. Robin
son has already r un under 14 this
year and beat both the Tribesmen
in a dual meet earlier this season.
In the meet's other individual
race, the 100-yard dash, prospects

are bright for the world mark of
9.3 to fall. The present mark was
first set at the West Coast .Relays
by Mel Patton.
Abilene Christian's Bobby Mor'-
row is given the best chance to
crack the mark. But he'll have to
be at full strength to beat Leamon
King and Mike Agostini, both co
holders of the current 9.3 stand
ard.
A world mark deemed almost
certain to fall is the distance med
ley relay record of 9:50.4, set two
years ago by Kansas. California,
Occidental, UCLA and the South
