CLEVELAND, 0., May 0 (UP)
- The Cleveland Indians placed
Herb score on the disabled list as
a "precautionary measure" to
day even though increasingly op
timistic medical reports indicated
the stricken pitcher may resume
his career earlier than originally
expected.
General Manager Ilank Green
berg, who saw "new hope" after
visiting Score during the day,
said the move was made "to give
him plenty of time lo recover
even at the risk of losing his
services one or two times."
"The doctors tell us that even
if Score should continue to im
prove as he has in the past two
days since his injury, he will be
unable to pitch for at least three
weeks."
