# Hungary's Puppet Government Plans Trials for Rebel Heroes
## Red Leader Denounces Mindszenty, Maleter, Nagy in Speech to Rubber-Stamp Parliament 
### 
VIKNNA, May !) (UP) Red Hungary's President Istvan Dobi de
nounced ex-Premier Imre Nagy, Ma.j. Gen. Pal Maleler and Josef
Cardinal Minds/.enty today in terms suggesting the Communists
plan propaganda trials of at least two of the three Hungarian heroes.
Radio Budapest broadcast a speech by Dobi at Ihe opening of

Hungary's rubber-stamp "parlia
ment" in which he:
• Accused Maleter of spying
for Ihe British and plotting to
make himself dictator of Hun
gary.
• Charged I hat the Nagy gov
ernment collaborated with last
autumn's anti-Soviet rebels and
planned to restore capitalism m i
deliberate defiance ol the Krem
lin.
• Denounced Mindszenty as a
"close friend and adviser" of tlie
ex-premier and said he fieri to the j
shelter of Ihe U.S. legation in Bu- i
da pest Nov. <1 at Nagy's sugges- I
tion.
<ioverninent Reorganized
The president spoke shortly j
after the parliament approved a
reorganization of puppet Prc
| mier Janos Kadar's government
to include nine prominent pro-
Russian politicians.
Observers here said the pur
pose of Dobi's speech was Iwo
! fold to blacken Ihe names of the
I three anti-Soviet leaders and to
j clear his own record. II was Dobi
who appointed Nagy premier
j and confirmed Maleter as de
-1 fense minister in the short-lived
"freedom cabinet."
Held in Prison
All three of the men denounced
today by Dobi are in effect pris
oners of Ihe Communists, al
though the Cardinal still in the
U.S. legation is beyond their im
mediate reach.
Nagy was seized treacherously
by Soviet agents when he left the
Yugoslav embassy under a safe
j conduct. He was spirited away
Ito Red Romania. Maleter is in
prison and perhaps dead.
