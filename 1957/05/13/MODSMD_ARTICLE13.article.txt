# Rutherdale Beaten Up by Own Friend; Attackers in 'SU Jackets' Don't Exist
## Herman Azevedo Picked Up by Police About Drive-in Meeting With Accused 
### John Lane 
The "four husky Stanford" attackers of Donald "Fat Man" Ruth
erdale, the 19-year-old who is accused of being the leader of the April
attack on a Stanford beach party, are probably one bantam-sized
laborer who never attended Stanford.
Redwood City police picked up Herman Azevedo, 20, for question-

ing in the assault last Monday of I
Rutherdale. Rutherdale said pre
viously that he had been stopped
and beaten by four alleged Stan- j
ford students, two of them wear- !
ing "regular Stanford jackets."
Azevedo, who is seven inches |
shorter and 90 pounds lighter
than Rutherdale, told police that
he had met Rutherdale at a
drive-in and asked him for a ride
home. Azevedo had been drink
ing.
Rutherdale commenced telling
Azevedo about the beach party
attack: "He felt good that he
whipped some of them."
"Biggest Joy"
"That's his biggest joy right
now," said Azevedo. "He kept
bragging to me how tough he
was." The youths arrived at Aze
vedo's house at 204 Berkshire St.,
Redwood City. "I just tired list
ening to how tough he was, so
I chose him," said Azevedo.
Rutherdale swung only once.
The rest of the fight went to the
tiny ex - amateur boxer. "He
slumped," said Azevedo, "then he
got up and I hit him again, and
he slumped again."
A woman across the street
came to the door of her house.
Rutherdale "ran across the
street," said police. "He ran
away," said Azevedo.
Rutherdale's Version
Rutherdale's own version of
the attack story now includes the
Azevedo incident, whereas pre
viously the story included only
the "four husky Stanford stu
dents." But he told The Daily
that after he had been beaten up
by Azevedo, he was stopped and
beaten again by the Stanford stu
dents.
According to the previous
story he told The Daily, he "left
the drive-in about 11:15" Mon
day, and was then stopped by
the students. He reported the
"Stanford" incident at 11:50.
According to Azevedo, his own
run-in with Rutherdale occurred
between 11 and 12 the same
night.
Rutherdale suffered abrasions
and contusions as a result of the
"two fights." Yesterday he told
The Daily that he had only one
scratch and a cut inner lip re
maining. Azevedo tore the skin
on the knuckles of his right
hand, getting blood on Ruther
dale's shirt.
Beat Up Parents
Rutherdale has been in trouble
before. Recently his own parents
filed charges against him for
assault and battery, but the
charges were later withdrawn.
Redwood City police have as
serted that their investigation of
the attack on Rutherdale had
nothing to do with the charge
against Rutherdale and two oth
ers of participating in the April
attack on a Stanford beach party
at San Gregorio.
The police said the investiga
tion of the attack on Rutherdale
by the "students" has been drop
ped at the suggestion of his at
torney, Dennis L. Woodman. No
charges will be made against
Azevedo.
Rutherdale and two of his
friends, Louis Marks, 19, and
Donald Hawkins, 18, are to go on
trial May 27 for attacking the
San Gregorio beach party.
Police Records
Marks and Rutherdale have
both piled up impressive police
records in the past four years.
As a result of the beach fra
cas, Verl Dean Keiser, 20-year
old junior, was in the Palo Alto
Hospital with what was for a
while believed to be a brain con
cussion. Keiser is now out of the
hospital.
Rutherdale said yesterday
that the beach party affair
"shouldn't have happened. I'm
sorry about it. but it's too late
now."
Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis mentioned the possibility
even last week that "somebody
else beat him up," and that he
tried to implicate Stanford stu
dents to "get the public on his
' side."
