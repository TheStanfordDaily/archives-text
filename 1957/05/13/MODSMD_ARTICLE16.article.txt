A RECORD tot AT. of $10,500 in contributions had
been counted for the Stanford Convalescent
Home up to noon yesterday. Off-campus solici
tations were still to be completed, and contri
butions from the Carnival and the Strawberry
Brunch were not yet tallied. Although the goal
for the drive was set at SlO.OOO, the committee
now hopes their final count will reach $12,000.
Congratulations go to co-chairmen Carolyn
Carlson and Buzz McCoy, to publicity chair
man Al Ferris and to all who worked on the
committee for bringing to Stanford a worth
while and successful charity drive.
Students somehow missed the boat with the
W inter Quarter Charity Drive. Stanford could
only squeak halfway toward a goal of $8000.
Last week we redeemed ourselves.
The previous record for Con Home collec
tions was $830#). collected in 1952. Last year
the goal was set at $7500 and, although record
contributions were made at the Carnival and

the Strawberry Brunch, the drive netted only
$7200.
Nearly all events this year exceeded their
goals, even willi incomplete returns. Those
who voted for '"Joe r rreinendo" donated $221.
Whereas last year only 50 freshman couples
solicited off-campus areas, this year more than
600 men and women participated in the so
licitations.
The money {roes toward taking care of about
80 sick children from 4 to 12 years old. These
children are recovering from non-contagious
crippling diseases, such as polio and cerebral
palsy.
The success of the drive obviously attests to
a greatly increased interest and participation
by the students. \\ hether this new interest can
be attributed to the superb job done by the
Con Home committee, to a general increase in
student participation in campus affairs, or to
students' greater sense of responsibility and
good will, the student body is to be congratu
lated for a job well done.
