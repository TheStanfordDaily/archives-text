# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Dick Frey
## Plenty of Activities Left for Waning Quarter 
### 
Con Home Week has come and gone, a remind
er that there is only about a month left of spring
quarter. Midterms are still plaguing Stanford
ites, but there are plenty of good old activities
left to give some relief.
Got a titanic midterm today? Frustrated?
Tense? Well, you can collapse into a chair at
the 4:15 p.m. Department of Biological Sciences
Seminar in Room 430 (tea at 4, bring*your own
crumpets). This week S. R. Gross will discuss
"Some Physiological Aspects of Gene Mutation."
Get the facts on how your two-headed cousin got
that way.
At 7:30 tonight the Peter Duncan McArthur
Society (AFROTC) will sponsor a showing of
"King Solomon's Mines" at Cubberley. Stewart
Granger and Deborah Kerr will barge around in
the jungle to the tune of flying spears. Three
cartoons are also scheduled for the flick, which
will be priced at 35 cents. Proceeds will benefit
the Scholarship Fund.

Tomorrow's big event will be the 63rd Annual
Medaille Joffre Debate between the local stal
warts of the debate world and invading forces
from Cal. The debate starts at 7:30 p.m. in Mem
Aud and will be the Tuesday Evening Series
presentation for this week. The topic to bp dis
russed is "French Colonial Policy."

Wednesday Matinee will present two plays at
4:15 p.m. in the Mem Aud Little Theatre. An
experimental tour de force and a short comedy
by August Strindberg are on the bill.
By George! The Seminar in Chemical Engi
neering and Applied Chemistry has another

prospoctivo hit lined up in Dr. William H.
Schwartz' discussion of "Some Effects of Iso
tropic Turbulence on a Pendulum." They'll be
packing them into Room 20 of the Chem Build
ing, at 4:15 p.m. on the dot.
Gods and mortals will whoop it up Wednes
day evening at the opening of the Ram's Head
Spring Show, Cole Porter's "Out of This World."
The show gets under way at 8:15 in Mem Aud
and will run through Saturday night. Tickets
are on sale at the Mem Aud box office.

The Thursday thriller and chiller is the 4 p.m.
Physics Department Colloquium in Room 372 of
Physics Corner. Dr. Owen Chamberlain of Cal
will be the guest speaker on "Anti-Nucleon."
Uncle Nucleoli will also be there handing out
free tranquilizers to calm the frenzied crowd
which is expected.
If you take a look at the Activity Calendar,
you'll notice that "The Young and the Damned"
was originally scheduled for the 7:30 p.m. Film
Series in Cubberley Thursday. However, this
controversial (at least, it sounds controversial)
flick has been' replaced by "Beauty and the
Beast" which could be even more controversial,
depending how one looks at it. Jean Marais and
Josette Day are the stars, whoever they are.

At A p.m. Sunday the Stanford Mpn's Glee
Club, directed by Ivim Rasmussen, will present
a program in Cubberley.
Concluding the week is the old Sunday night
standby the flicks. "The Proud Ones," starring
Robert Stack and Virginia Mayo, is this week's
show.
