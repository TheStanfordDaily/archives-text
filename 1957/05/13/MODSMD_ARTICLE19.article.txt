# Sue Coshow Coordinates Social Life as ASSU Vice-President

"Great idea," decide members
of the freshman class when they
make plans to sponsor an all
campus dance on a Friday night
in the Pavilion.
"We'll make lots of money if
we put on an all-campus carni
val," decides the junior class.
"And let's hold it in the Pavilion
on Friday night."
Both groups sell tickets and
get up a full head of steam in
their preparation. Then comes
the discoveryâ€”they're both plan
ning to use the same place on
the same night.
Fortunately, such a collision of
social activities is stopped before
it can start. For all official so
cial functions have to get the
okay of ASSU Vice-President Sue
Coshow before they can be held.

Assisting Miss Coshow in her
job of juggling events, dates and
places is the Social Co-ordinating
Board, made up of all dormi
tory social chairmen plus the
four class vice-presidents.
"We register everything from
exchanges to the Junior Prom,"
Miss Coshow said. She maintains
a date book which 1 ells the what,
when, where and other informa
tion about coming events.
It is from this social log of the
vice-president that the quarterly
social calendars are composed.

The Social Co-o rd ina 11 n g
Board, with Miss Coshow as
chairman, meets every other
week.
"One of our important tasks is
deciding what group will give the
autumn reg dance," Miss Coshow
noted. "That's the biggest money
maker."
The vice - president, who is a
voting member of Legislature, is
next in line for the presidency
and is chairman of the meetings
i in the president's absence.

Another vice-presidential duty
of Miss Coshow is to be student
representative on the Tuesday
Evening Series, helping to select
the speakers and other perform
ers.
No stranger to student govern
ment, Miss Coshow served on the
Frosh Exeom, was assistant to
the ASSU vice-president in 1954-
55 and was the Union Represen
tative in Legislature last year.
