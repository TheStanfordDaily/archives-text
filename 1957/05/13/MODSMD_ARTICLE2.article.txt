The (wo criteria which have given Stanford's Department of Psy
chology its outstanding reputation are the quantity of research and
scholarly hooks published by its faculty and the quality of its grad
uate students.
That is the opinion of Robert R. Sears, head of the Department of

Psychology since 1953. Sears
said the areas of research in
which Stanford is especially
strong are learning and social
psychology, child development
and personality.
Relating the "illustrious" his
tory" of the Department of Psy
chology, Sears said the late
Emeritus Professor Lewis M.
Terman brought "a number of
outstanding people here" after
becoming head of the department
in 1022.
Among such outstanding psy
chologists have been the late C.
P. Stone, who did research on the
development of sex behavior in
rats, and Edward Kellogg Strong
Jr., now an emeritus professor,
who helped develop vocational in
terest inventory tests.
I<l Tests
"Terman himself is famous for
his work on the Stanford-Binet
intelligence tests and his studies
of gifted children," Sears said.
Mrs. Maud Merrill James,
emeritus professor of psychol
ogy, is now doing another revi
sion of the Stanford-Binet. "Our
emeritus professors have all
been very active," Sears said.
About 50 students major in
psychology at Stanford each
year, Sears said, with most of
them going on to do graduate
work "in something or other."
Sears said Stanford's psychol
ogy graduates "always get into
the best schools." In rating other
schools of psychology, he named
Michigan and Yale as "first rate"
and Harvard and lowa as "con
tenders for the top spot."
Grads Elected
Two graduates of the Depart
ment of Psychology recently
were elected presidents of the
American Psychological Associa
tion, Sears said. Of members of
the faculty since 1022, five were
presidents of the APA, including
Sears himself and E. R. Hilgard,
department head from 1043 to
1053 and now dean of the gradu
ate school.
Sears said he thought his de
partment makes more use of ex
periments involving elementary
students and offers more obser
vation and laboratory courses in
child psychology than do most
other departments of psychology.

department head from 1043 to
1053 and now dean of the gradu
ate school.
Sears said he thought his de
partment makes more use of ex
periments involving elementary
students and offers more obser
vation and laboratory courses in
child psychology than do most
other departments of psychology.
(Kd. Note: This is the first Jn a series on (he nine Stanford de
partments given "distinguished" ratings in a survey published in
Tlie Chicago Tribune.)
The (wo criteria which have given Stanford's Department of Psy
chology its outstanding reputation are the quantity of research and
scholarly hooks published by its faculty and the quality of its grad
uate students.
That is the opinion of Robert R. Sears, head of the Department of

Psychology since 1953. Sears
said the areas of research in
which Stanford is especially
strong are learning and social
psychology, child development
and personality.
Relating the "illustrious" his
tory" of the Department of Psy
chology, Sears said the late
Emeritus Professor Lewis M.
Terman brought "a number of
outstanding people here" after
becoming head of the department
in 1022.
Among such outstanding psy
chologists have been the late C.
P. Stone, who did research on the
development of sex behavior in
rats, and Edward Kellogg Strong
Jr., now an emeritus professor,
who helped develop vocational in
terest inventory tests.

"Terman himself is famous for
his work on the Stanford-Binet
intelligence tests and his studies
of gifted children," Sears said.
Mrs. Maud Merrill James,
emeritus professor of psychol
ogy, is now doing another revi
sion of the Stanford-Binet. "Our
emeritus professors have all
been very active," Sears said.
About 50 students major in
psychology at Stanford each
year, Sears said, with most of
them going on to do graduate
work "in something or other."
Sears said Stanford's psychol
ogy graduates "always get into
the best schools." In rating other
schools of psychology, he named
Michigan and Yale as "first rate"
and Harvard and lowa as "con
tenders for the top spot."
Grads Elected
Two graduates of the Depart
ment of Psychology recently
were elected presidents of the
American Psychological Associa
tion, Sears said. Of members of
the faculty since 1022, five were
presidents of the APA, including
Sears himself and E. R. Hilgard,
department head from 1043 to
1053 and now dean of the gradu
ate school.
