Stanford's hopes of gaining, an
NCAA baseball playoff berth
were dealt a heavy blow over the
weekend as Southern California
topped the Tribe, 2-0, Friday and
California downed the Cards and
Boh Leopold, 3-1, in a rain-short
ened five-inning affair Saturday
at the Sunken Diamond.
Today the Indians close their
conference season with the make
up of Saturday's washed-out sec
ond game with Cal, scheduled for
3:15 p.m. on the Sunken Diamond.
There is still a remote chance
for the Cards. Since only South
ern Division records will count as
to which team will face the North
ern champs for the Pacific Coast
Conference crown, the two losses
to Santa Clara will not he counted
against the Tribe.
Stanford is 5-6 in SD play and
Cal 5-4, but the Bears must face
USC twice after today's clash.
All Went Wrong
Everything seemed to go wrong
for the Tribe over the weekend.
The major problem seemed to be
that, no matter how hard the In
dians would tag the ball, a Trojan
or a Bear would be right in its
path.
The Cards scored only one run
in the two games, hut it was a
historic one. In the second inning
of Saturday's game left fielder
Parker Olsen parked a ball 405
feet from home plate over the
Sunken Diamond's left field wall
—only the 37th homer out of the
big field in its 36-year history.
But the Cards picked up only
eight more hits during the two
games. Trojan Ed Isherwood
hurled one of his finest games of
the season Friday, and the Bears'
Doug Weiss bore down Saturday
and finally beat Leopold in his
third try.
In the first home appearance
for the big Indian sophomore, he
was tagged for nine hits in the
five innings. Leopold seemed to
have a little something missing
on both his fast ball and breaking
stuff.
Verdurmen, Avery Pitch
Ed Verdurmen and George
Avery combined to pitch fine ball
Friday, but Isherwood was just
too tough. USC actually won the
game in the first inning when
Ken Guffey walked, went to third
on Mike Castanen's double, and
scored on a sacrifice fly to Bill
Olson. The Trojans added anoth
er unearned tally in the fourth.
Cal got to Leopold fast in Sat
urday's game. Roger Gregg open
ed the game with a single for the
Bears, and Ron Gaggero was hit
by a pitched ball after Gregg had
stolen second.
Shortstop Earl Robinson then
sent both runners home by smash
ing a long double to left center.

BULLETIN
Today's baseball game with
California, scheduled for 3:15
p.m. on the Sunken Diamond,
may be changed into a double
header, be g inning at 1:30,
Coach Dutch Fehring said last
night.
Feb ring said Al Masters,
.Stanford athletic director, and
Greg Engelhard, Cal athletic
director, were meeting lale last
night to decide whether or not
to void the result of Saturday's
first game. The game was
rained out at the end of five in
nings.
If the result was voided, a
double-header will he played.
II y Holt I'ay tv
Stanford's hopes of gaining, an
NCAA baseball playoff berth
were dealt a heavy blow over the
weekend as Southern California
topped the Tribe, 2-0, Friday and
California downed the Cards and
Boh Leopold, 3-1, in a rain-short
ened five-inning affair Saturday
at the Sunken Diamond.
Today the Indians close their
conference season with the make
up of Saturday's washed-out sec
ond game with Cal, scheduled for
3:15 p.m. on the Sunken Diamond.
There is still a remote chance
for the Cards. Since only South
ern Division records will count as
to which team will face the North
ern champs for the Pacific Coast
Conference crown, the two losses
to Santa Clara will not he counted
against the Tribe.
Stanford is 5-6 in SD play and
Cal 5-4, but the Bears must face
USC twice after today's clash.
All Went Wrong
Everything seemed to go wrong
for the Tribe over the weekend.
The major problem seemed to be
that, no matter how hard the In
dians would tag the ball, a Trojan
or a Bear would be right in its
path.
The Cards scored only one run
in the two games, hut it was a
historic one. In the second inning
of Saturday's game left fielder
Parker Olsen parked a ball 405
feet from home plate over the
Sunken Diamond's left field wall
—only the 37th homer out of the
big field in its 36-year history.
But the Cards picked up only
eight more hits during the two
games. Trojan Ed Isherwood
hurled one of his finest games of
the season Friday, and the Bears'
Doug Weiss bore down Saturday
and finally beat Leopold in his
third try.
In the first home appearance
for the big Indian sophomore, he
was tagged for nine hits in the
five innings. Leopold seemed to
have a little something missing
on both his fast ball and breaking
stuff.
Verdurmen, Avery Pitch
Ed Verdurmen and George
Avery combined to pitch fine ball
Friday, but Isherwood was just
too tough. USC actually won the
game in the first inning when
Ken Guffey walked, went to third
on Mike Castanen's double, and
scored on a sacrifice fly to Bill
Olson. The Trojans added anoth
er unearned tally in the fourth.
Cal got to Leopold fast in Sat
urday's game. Roger Gregg open
ed the game with a single for the
Bears, and Ron Gaggero was hit
by a pitched ball after Gregg had
stolen second.
Shortstop Earl Robinson then
sent both runners home by smash
ing a long double to left center.

II y Holt I'ay tv
Stanford's hopes of gaining, an
NCAA baseball playoff berth
were dealt a heavy blow over the
weekend as Southern California
topped the Tribe, 2-0, Friday and
California downed the Cards and
Boh Leopold, 3-1, in a rain-short
ened five-inning affair Saturday
at the Sunken Diamond.
Today the Indians close their
conference season with the make
up of Saturday's washed-out sec
ond game with Cal, scheduled for
3:15 p.m. on the Sunken Diamond.
There is still a remote chance
for the Cards. Since only South
ern Division records will count as
to which team will face the North
ern champs for the Pacific Coast
Conference crown, the two losses
to Santa Clara will not he counted
against the Tribe.
Stanford is 5-6 in SD play and
Cal 5-4, but the Bears must face
USC twice after today's clash.
All Went Wrong
Everything seemed to go wrong
for the Tribe over the weekend.
The major problem seemed to be
that, no matter how hard the In
dians would tag the ball, a Trojan
or a Bear would be right in its
path.
The Cards scored only one run
in the two games, hut it was a
historic one. In the second inning
of Saturday's game left fielder
Parker Olsen parked a ball 405
feet from home plate over the
Sunken Diamond's left field wall
—only the 37th homer out of the
big field in its 36-year history.
But the Cards picked up only
eight more hits during the two
games. Trojan Ed Isherwood
hurled one of his finest games of
the season Friday, and the Bears'
Doug Weiss bore down Saturday
and finally beat Leopold in his
third try.
In the first home appearance
for the big Indian sophomore, he
was tagged for nine hits in the
five innings. Leopold seemed to
have a little something missing
on both his fast ball and breaking
stuff.
Verdurmen, Avery Pitch
Ed Verdurmen and George
Avery combined to pitch fine ball
Friday, but Isherwood was just
too tough. USC actually won the
game in the first inning when
Ken Guffey walked, went to third
on Mike Castanen's double, and
scored on a sacrifice fly to Bill
Olson. The Trojans added anoth
er unearned tally in the fourth.
Cal got to Leopold fast in Sat
urday's game. Roger Gregg open
ed the game with a single for the
Bears, and Ron Gaggero was hit
by a pitched ball after Gregg had
stolen second.
Shortstop Earl Robinson then
sent both runners home by smash
ing a long double to left center.

BULLETIN
Today's baseball game with
California, scheduled for 3:15
p.m. on the Sunken Diamond,
may be changed into a double
header, be g inning at 1:30,
Coach Dutch Fehring said last
night.
Feb ring said Al Masters,
.Stanford athletic director, and
Greg Engelhard, Cal athletic
director, were meeting lale last
night to decide whether or not
to void the result of Saturday's
first game. The game was
rained out at the end of five in
nings.
If the result was voided, a
double-header will he played.
II y Holt I'ay tv
Stanford's hopes of gaining, an
NCAA baseball playoff berth
were dealt a heavy blow over the
weekend as Southern California
topped the Tribe, 2-0, Friday and
California downed the Cards and
Boh Leopold, 3-1, in a rain-short
ened five-inning affair Saturday
at the Sunken Diamond.
Today the Indians close their
conference season with the make
up of Saturday's washed-out sec
ond game with Cal, scheduled for
3:15 p.m. on the Sunken Diamond.
There is still a remote chance
for the Cards. Since only South
ern Division records will count as
to which team will face the North
ern champs for the Pacific Coast
Conference crown, the two losses
to Santa Clara will not he counted
against the Tribe.
Stanford is 5-6 in SD play and
Cal 5-4, but the Bears must face
USC twice after today's clash.
All Went Wrong
Everything seemed to go wrong
for the Tribe over the weekend.
The major problem seemed to be
that, no matter how hard the In
dians would tag the ball, a Trojan
or a Bear would be right in its
path.
The Cards scored only one run
in the two games, hut it was a
historic one. In the second inning
of Saturday's game left fielder
Parker Olsen parked a ball 405
feet from home plate over the
Sunken Diamond's left field wall
—only the 37th homer out of the
big field in its 36-year history.
But the Cards picked up only
eight more hits during the two
games. Trojan Ed Isherwood
hurled one of his finest games of
the season Friday, and the Bears'
Doug Weiss bore down Saturday
and finally beat Leopold in his
third try.
In the first home appearance
for the big Indian sophomore, he
was tagged for nine hits in the
five innings. Leopold seemed to
have a little something missing
on both his fast ball and breaking
stuff.
Verdurmen, Avery Pitch
Ed Verdurmen and George
Avery combined to pitch fine ball
Friday, but Isherwood was just
too tough. USC actually won the
game in the first inning when
Ken Guffey walked, went to third
on Mike Castanen's double, and
scored on a sacrifice fly to Bill
Olson. The Trojans added anoth
er unearned tally in the fourth.
Cal got to Leopold fast in Sat
urday's game. Roger Gregg open
ed the game with a single for the
Bears, and Ron Gaggero was hit
by a pitched ball after Gregg had
stolen second.
Shortstop Earl Robinson then
sent both runners home by smash
ing a long double to left center.
