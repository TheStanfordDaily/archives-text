# Finmen, Led By Burton, Defeat Cal
## SU Cops 34th Victory In Row Over Bears; 27th Straight in PCC 
### Jack Rannells 
Tom Burton paced himself to a
double victory.in the freestyle dis
tance events and then turned in a
good leg in the meet-deciding 400-
yard relay event £o lead Stanford
to its 34th straight dual meet win
over California, 49-37, here Sat
urday.
The win also was the Indians'
27th consecutive PCC dual meet
victory. It will send them into
next weekend's PCC champion
ships at USC as cd-favorites with
the Bears.
Burton's 2:14.2 and 4:54.2 times
in the 200 and 440 do not reflect
his best efforts, as coach Tom
Haynie had directed him to swim
for the win and save himself for
maximum effort in the final relay
event.
Kuhn Takes Diving
Only other individual winner
for the Indians was Boh Kahn,
who came through with a sur
prisingly strong 211 points in the
diving competition.
Haynie's strategy of using su
perior depth and concentrating on
the important relay points (seven
points to the winner, none to the
loser) paid off with the final win
and a new PCC record.
Using Ron Grunt, Bill Hynes,
Winston Black and Johnson in the
400 medley relay, Stanford pad
dled to a new PCC mark of 3:58.
In the 400-yard relay, the In

ton and Johnson splashed to vic

this event.

ya r d backstroke. Tognazzini's
