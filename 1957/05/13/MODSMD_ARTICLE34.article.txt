# MISS TRAINOR, DIRECTOR
## Moore Hall Combines Small Residence Living, Economy 
### Eve Eunson Staff Editor 
The director of Florence Moore
Hall, Miss Margaret Trainor, was
having lunch the other day in one
of the Moore house dining rooms
when she made some reference
to the lobby. She was quickly
corrected by a Moore womaA
who informed her that it is not
a lobby but a living room.
In this case it is only the thin
line of definition of terminology
that expresses the difference be
tween small and large group liv
ing, but this difference is the
purpose in the architecture of
the building, the house govern
ments which have been created,
and the attitude of the residents
of Moore Hall.
Small Group Living
The newest women's dormitory
is, according to many of the
women who live there, an exam
ple of small group living, in spite
of the large group economy.
Not quite complete when the
year started, Florence Moore
Hall presented several problems.
Some of the women had to live
in Encina while their respective
houses were being constructed,
there was no furniture in any of
the living rooms, Paloma and
Mirlo houses were each shy a
staircase and the names of the
houses had not yet been painted
on the doors, causing several in
cidents of lost dates.
Energy Diverted
"Often, when we would rather
be spending time on the creative
side in terms of student govern
ment and carrying through the
philosophy of small houses, the
energy had to go to plumbing
and building problems," said
Miss Trainor in explaining the
burdens of a new dormitory.
"This quarter, however, we are
really beginning to see what it
means to have this kind of resi
dence," she continued.
Many of the pleasant physical
aspects have made up for any of
the troublesome burdens. The
phones in the rooms, the nicely
painted walls, the large closets
and the individual house dining
rooms are all enjoyed by the res
idents of Florence Moore.
The individuality of each of

the seven houses at Moore is ex
pressing itself more predomi
nantly as time wears on. Each
house has a separate constitu
tion with different by-laws and
rules of procedure.
Each house contrasts in its
decorating taste, with some hav
ing a television set while another
has a piano. And as the end of
the year gets closer the reputa
tion and personality of each
house is becoming better known.
In a recent meeting of the
house presidents which Presi
dent Wallace Sterling attended,
he asked if the women referred
to their houses by their individ
ual names or referred to their
residence as Florence Moore.
Individual Names
The general opinion seemed to
be that when talking to someone
inside Moore the individual name
was used, but to people outside it
is still easier to say Florence
Moore. However, when more
outsiders know the names they
will be used.
While the ultimate goal of
most of the Moore women is to
establish individuality of houses,
there are certain things which
they willingly share.
For example, recently Miss
Kathleen Brown, the assistant
director, became engaged. The
excitement and delight which ran
through all seven houses can
only be explained as unity of
opinion.

The newest women's dormitory
is, according to many of the
women who live there, an exam
ple of small group living, in spite
of the large group economy.
Not quite complete when the
year started, Florence Moore
Hall presented several problems.
Some of the women had to live
in Encina while their respective
houses were being constructed,
there was no furniture in any of
the living rooms, Paloma and
Mirlo houses were each shy a
staircase and the names of the
houses had not yet been painted
on the doors, causing several in
cidents of lost dates.
Energy Diverted
"Often, when we would rather
be spending time on the creative
side in terms of student govern
ment and carrying through the
philosophy of small houses, the
energy had to go to plumbing
and building problems," said
Miss Trainor in explaining the
burdens of a new dormitory.
"This quarter, however, we are
really beginning to see what it
means to have this kind of resi
dence," she continued.
Many of the pleasant physical
aspects have made up for any of
the troublesome burdens. The
phones in the rooms, the nicely
painted walls, the large closets
and the individual house dining
rooms are all enjoyed by the res
idents of Florence Moore.
The individuality of each of

the seven houses at Moore is ex
pressing itself more predomi
nantly as time wears on. Each
house has a separate constitu
tion with different by-laws and
rules of procedure.
Each house contrasts in its
decorating taste, with some hav
ing a television set while another
has a piano. And as the end of
the year gets closer the reputa
tion and personality of each
house is becoming better known.
In a recent meeting of the
house presidents which Presi
dent Wallace Sterling attended,
he asked if the women referred
to their houses by their individ
ual names or referred to their
residence as Florence Moore.
Individual Names
The general opinion seemed to
be that when talking to someone
inside Moore the individual name
was used, but to people outside it
is still easier to say Florence
Moore. However, when more
outsiders know the names they
will be used.
While the ultimate goal of
most of the Moore women is to
establish individuality of houses,
there are certain things which
they willingly share.
For example, recently Miss
Kathleen Brown, the assistant
director, became engaged. The
excitement and delight which ran
through all seven houses can
only be explained as unity of
opinion.
The director of Florence Moore
Hall, Miss Margaret Trainor, was
having lunch the other day in one
of the Moore house dining rooms
when she made some reference
to the lobby. She was quickly
corrected by a Moore womaA
who informed her that it is not
a lobby but a living room.
In this case it is only the thin
line of definition of terminology
that expresses the difference be
tween small and large group liv
ing, but this difference is the
purpose in the architecture of
the building, the house govern
ments which have been created,
and the attitude of the residents
of Moore Hall.
