## 
### 
Carmen Madrigal Nicto de Gen
netlf. currently on an extended
lecture tour of the United States,
visited the campus Friday, un
der the auspices ol Hoover Insti
tute and Library.
Affiliated with nearly a dozen
civic groups in her home of San
Jose, Costa Rica, Mrs. de Gennet
te is mainly interested in inform
ing Americans of her country
and exchanging ideas concerning
women's status in the two coun
tries.
Mrs. fie Gennette is a profes
sional painter, belongs to the San
Jose Garden Club, the board of
directors of the symphony, Inter
national Federation of Women's
Clubs and the Costa Rica board
of directors of UNESCO.
She was much impressed with
the beauty of the campus and the
wealth of the United States.
"But," she continued, "even
though you are a rich country
and arc much more highly devel
oped than we, Costa Rica enjoys
much more peace and democracy.
I reali/.e that there are other
things in life much more worth
while | than wealth|."
Costa Rica has no national
army or navy, she reminded,
"and this could possibly be the
reason for our more pacific atti
tude and emphasis on social and
cultural activities. Nearly all
the people have land. We don't
have this large contrast of rich
landowners and small tenant
farmers, which is present in so
many wealthy countries."
"Our crime rate and juvenile
delinquency problems are very
small," she said. "We try to pre
vent these things before they
start."
