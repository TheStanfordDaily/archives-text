# Con Home Drive Smashes All Previous Records
## Returns to Date Well in Excess Of $10,000 Aim Grand Total Expected To Top $12,000 With Uncounted Collections 
### 
The Con Home drive had netted
$10,500 at noon yesterdayâ€”great
ly topping the $10,000 goal.
Collections remaining to be
counted were expected to boost
the total well over $12,000, accord
ing to publicity chairman A 1 Fer
ris. The $12,000 figure would be
$3700 over the previous Con Home
drive record, set in 1952.
The phenomenally successful
drive activities concluded Friday
with a carnival and final showing
of the movie "The Claw."
King and Queen
Joe Tremendo was crowned Con
Home King and Katrina Kartooz
ian Queen as part of the carnival.
The pair were winners in one of
the most successful penny-a-vote
contests ever held. Tremendo pull
ed $221 in votes and Kartoozian
$67. The entire contest netted
$970, with $500 in pennies coming
in the last day.
Tremendo's actual name is Jim
Baker. A member of the El Cua
dro eating club, his living group
contributed $210 of his winning
total. Kartoozian actually carries
the name Bill and is a Wilbur
freshman.
The winning booth at the carni
val was a pari-mutuel rat race co
operatively sponsored by Cardi
nals and El Toro eating club.
1(100 at Mangini's
Ferris estimated that some 1000
students went out to the affair at
Mangini's Friday afternoon.
Yesterday's total drive figure
did not include final returns from
any off-campus solicitations after
Saturday afternoon, nor from the
Strawberry Brunch or the carni
val. Off-campus solicitations were
to end yesterday and the final
total should be announced today.
The solicitations, responsible for
the largest part of the total, broke
all previous records by a wide
margin.
In fact, says Ferris, all events
broke records. This was the un
usual feature that contributed so
strongly to the Con Home Week
success, he adds. The response for
every event was tremendous.
Co-Chairmen Say:
Co-chairmen for the entire drive,
Carolyn Carlson and Buss McCoy,
naturally had a few things to say
yesterday about the week's suc
cess.
McCoy said: "We're terribly
happy about all the campus en
thusiasm for the drive and think
it's an indication that student spir
it is rising. It wasn't just Carolyn
and I but better than 2000 stu
dents who propagated the success.
The most important group we are
indebted to is the freshman class.
Every activity they sponsored, es
pecially off-campus solicitations
and their Excom-organized King
and Queen contest, broke all pre
vious records."
Miss Carlson said: "Working
on Con Home and seeing the tre
mendous student response was
one of the most wonderful experi
ences I've ever had. If the 're
sponse was any indication of the
way people feel about the Con
Home, I don't see why every Con
Home drive can't be this success
ful. The fun the students had
during the drive was amazing.
Truthfully, I'm snowed."
The Winners?
One of the few details that re
mained io be tied up yesterday
was the announcement of some
winners. The six top couples in
off-campus solicitations were yet
to be announced. They will re
ceive free dinners. And the win
ners in the sports tournament
were yet to be determined.
Hurlburt House, on Women's
Row, won the car wash contest,
taking in $85.
