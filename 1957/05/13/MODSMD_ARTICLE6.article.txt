# Spring Show, 'Out of This World,' Will Open Wednesday in Mem Aud for Four-Night Stand
## 
### 
Cole Porter's musical comedy
"Out of This World," which goes
to Greece for its locale and mixes
ancient gods and modern mortals
in its cast, will open Wednesday
in Memorial Auditorium lor a
four-night run.
Ram's Head is producing the
musical, this year's Spring Show.
Missy Edwards will be starred
as a humorously ungodly Juno,

with some of the most sophisti
cated of Porter's songs to sing.
Raold Reitan, Betsy Flint, Mark
Hammer, William Kinsolving and
Sondra Gynkiss will be other lead
ing members of the large cast.
The flippant and frolicsome plot
has been patterned after the clas
sical Amphitryon legend about
the philanderings of Jupiter
among mortals. The authors leave
the age of fable behind and bring
their mythological characters and
their actions up to date.
American Bride
This time Jupiter Rex (whose
lordly name rhymes with sex)
casts his amorous- glances at a
pretty American bride whom his
son Mercury —his "bird dog" for
these adventures — fetches from
New York to Greece for her hon
eymoon with a reporter from a
news magazine.
The plot thickens when this
newshound becomes diverted by a
pursuit of a Chicago gangster
who has returned to his native
Greece. This gives' Jupiter his
chance to disguise himself as the
young gtx>om and pursue his mis
chief with Ihe bride.
Juno Jealous
Jealous Juno goes looking for
her husband with a sort of divin
ing rod, and for a while she thinks
she has found him disguised as
the gangster.
"No Lover for Me" and"I Am
Loved" are two of the most popu
lar songs in the show, both sung
by Roberta Grant as the pretty
mortal favored by Jupiter.
David Whorf as Mercury will
sing two typically brittle Porter
ish songs, "They Couldn't Com
pare with You" and "Cherry Pies
Ought to Be You."
Bill Davis is directing the com

bination of extravaganza and in
nuendo. He has also directed the
dances in conjunction with Jean
McCarter. Lewis Heneford has di
rected the technical aspects of the
show and Jon Elkus will conduct
the orchestra.
Ticket sales continue on Quad
every day this week. Prices are
$1, $1.25 and $1.50.
