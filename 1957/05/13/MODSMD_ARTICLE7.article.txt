# Dave Beck Antics May Bring Union Regulation Laws

(Compiled from United Press)
Congress may be prompted to
set standards of conduct for the
administration of union funds as
a result of Congressional agita
tion brought about by the beha
vior of Teamsters President
Dave Beck.
The information was learned
yesterday from Senator Sam J.
Ervin, Jr. (D-N.C.).
Ervin, a member of the Senate
Labor Rackets Committee, told
newsmen that recent testimony
before the committee indieated
that Beck regarded the Team
sters treasury, of which he was
trustee, "as his own private prop
erty."
He said that as a result of the
inquiry, Congress may want to
lay down some "guidelines" for
determining what constitutes a
breach of trusteeship in such
cases. He said he personally
feels that anyone managing a
trust fund "for his own gain"
violates the law.
Ervin commented that rank
and-file Teamsters members
have so little voice in the admin
istration of their union that they
may be unable to clean up their
union themselves. In such a case,
he said, Congressional action
may be necessary.
The committee will resume its
hearings tomorrow with two bus
iness executives on the witness
stand.
