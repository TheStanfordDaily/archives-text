# A 						Phi O Introduces Plans For Emergency Blood Drive
## In Case of Emergency Women's Clubhouse, Pavilion Would Be Blood Donating Centers 
### Jack Winkler 
Plans for an emergency blood drive at Stanford, irr case of local
or national disaster, have been set up by a committee of Alpha Phi
Omega members, at the request of LASSU, which outline special
procedure for immediate collection of blood.
A committee of four—John Mather, chairman, Bill Harrison, Lar
ry O'Rourke and Paul Theiss— I ~

submitted a three-page report to
Legislature April 17, and the proj
ect was turned over to the service
fraternity to work out details.
The first step in Mather's re
port was to obtain permission of
Alfred Masters and Mrs. Tibby to
use the Pavilion and the Women's
Clubhouse for donating centers.
The emergency need for blood
will be determined by the Red
Cross, which will notify the ASSU
president. The president will then
convene a special meeting of
LASSU to take action, and the
drive officially start.
Last Blood Drive
The last time Stanford had a
blood drive was in the spring of
1954. That was the second con
secutive spring blood drive, for in
1953 Stanford students had given
4630 pints in a five-day campaign,
almost a pint per student average.
The committee would have a
chairman, responsible for the en
tire working of the drive, who
would work directly with the Red
Cross and, during the time of the
drive, he solely under its direc
tion.
Under him would be a vice
chairman, who would also serve
as treasurer. Then would come
the directors of the various com
mittees, headed by the chief of
the publicity committee. The lat
ter would direct at least five
workers in putting up Red Cross
posters, arranging KZSU an
nouncements and organizing pub
licity in The Daily..
Recruiting' Director
Next would be the director of
recruiting, with a committee of
four. This group would arrange
for special representatives in each
living group who would contact
people living there and obtain a
list of prospective donors.
Each donor would fill out a
card and list two times of his
choice for giving his blood. These
cards would be turned over to the
director of scheduling, who would
work out appointment times at a
rate determined by the Red Cross.
Bloodletting takes approximate
ly one hour, what with filling out
of forms, health record, actual
giving of blood, and resting and
feeding times.
Personnel Director
The director of personnel would
lead a committee of at least 20,
which would act. as assistants to
the Find Cross nurses. These Vol
unteers would clear and clean the
rooms and transport, the beds, ta
bles, chairs, portable stoves, tele
phones. typewriters, partitions,
coat racks and water containers
from storage places to the dona
tion centers.
They would also act as messen
gers, as helpers with the feeding
after, bloodletting and as a clean
up committee. At present A Phi O
is goiiig ahead with the formation
of this committee, in case Stan
ford should ever be called on to
have an emergency blood drive.
