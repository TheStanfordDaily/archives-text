oppose it on foreign affairs be
cause of Macmillan's "capitula
tion to Nasser."
The Socialist opposition raised
a motion of censure against the
government charging that its
Suez policy damaged "British
prestige and economic interests"
throughout the world. It will be
debated later in the week.
Majority Holds
The walkout did not affect
Macmillan's SO-vote majority in
Commons.

lan was a foregone conclusion.

Sources said the forthcoming
Rome conference would take up
British claims for compensation
from Egypt for nationalizing the
old canal company and other
firms seized by the Cairo govern
ment. But they said it would not
ake up future management of
the canal.

in the Suez Canal dispute.
Prime Minister Harold Mac
millan announced to a silent
House of Commons that Britain
has ended its boycott of the wa
terway and British shippers may
resume use of it under Egyptian
terms.
In return Britain received the
single concession that Egypt will
accept British currency for tolls
rather than dollars.
In adition, Macmillan said,
talks with Egypt soon will start
in a "neutral center" on the $280
million in Egyptian funds which
Britain froze in British banks
when President Gamal Abdel
Nasser nationalized the canal
last July 26.
Rome Meeting'
Sources said the meeting would
be held in Rome, May 23.
Eight right-wing Conservative
members of Parliament prompt
ly resigned their party member
ship and announced that hence
forth they would sit in Commons
as "Independent Conservatives."
All were members of the "Suez
rebel" group.
A statement said they would
continue to support the general
principles of the party but would
oppose it on foreign affairs be
cause of Macmillan's "capitula
tion to Nasser."
The Socialist opposition raised
a motion of censure against the
government charging that its
Suez policy damaged "British
prestige and economic interests"
throughout the world. It will be
debated later in the week.
Majority Holds
The walkout did not affect
Macmillan's SO-vote majority in
Commons.
The announcement by Macmil
lan was a foregone conclusion.
Since the canal was reopened last
month. Western vessels including
several ships flying the British
flag have used the canal, paying
tolls to Egypt.
Britain's decision meant the
canal would return to normal for
the first time in almost 10
months, since Britain accounted
for one-third the canal's usual
traffic.
Sources said the forthcoming
Rome conference would take up
British claims for compensation
from Egypt for nationalizing the
old canal company and other
firms seized by the Cairo govern
ment. But they said it would not
ake up future management of
the canal.
