# Palo Alto City Council Approves Hospital Bids At Last Night's Meeting
## Stanford-Palo Alto Building to Cost Million Less Than Estimate 
### Frank Huntress, Associate Editor 
Bids totaling near $7 million for the Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital
were approved last night by the Palo Alto City Council at its regular
bi-weekly meeting at City Hall.
The bids still have to be approved by Stanford before they become
binding in contracts. '
With all low bids accepted the hospital would cost $6,907,145.85—

more than $1 V 2 million less than
the estimates of the construction
consultants, Wagner and Marti
nez.. Their estimate was $8,428,-
026.
Stanford will pay for 65 per
cent of the hospital while the city
of Palo Alto will pay for 35 per
cent.
Argument
An argument came to the coun
cil concerning the Scott Com
pany of San Francisco bid for
plumbing, heating and ventilat
ing. The company's bid of $1,-
836,300—the largest for the proj
ect —called for completion of the
work within 750 days. But the
bid specification called for com
pletion within 540 days or for
feiture of $200 a day over the
limit. The Scott Company then
agreed to the 540-day limit.
The 24 bids taken Friday do
not represent the total cost of
the hospital. Equipment and fur
niture for the 400-bed project will
cost an estimated $1.5 million,
thus boosting the total to $9,532,-
000.
Architect Edward D. Stone
upon hearing of the bids said,
"This is a miracle and you can
quote me."
Palo Alto City Manager Jerry
Keithley said, "We're off to a
good start, and we're facing the
future with controlled enthusi
asm."
Concrete Bid
The next largest bid for the
hospital was for earth work, con
crete and masonry. C. N. Swan
son Company was the low bidder
with $1,822,000.
