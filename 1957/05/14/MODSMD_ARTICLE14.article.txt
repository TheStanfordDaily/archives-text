# Senate Won't Restore Any Budget Cuts
## 
### 
(Compiled from United Press)
The Senate, matching the
House dollar for dollar in the
current economy drive, refused
yesterday to restore any of the
$58,000,000 slash in the Post Of
fice Department's new budget.
The Senate took the action in
approving its first regular money
bill of the year—a $3,884,927,000
measure to operate the Post Of
fice and Treasury departments
and the Federal Tax Court in the
new fiscal year starting July 1.
Treasury-Post Office
The Treasury-Post Office meas
ure carried $691,467,000 for the
Treasury, including the Coast
Guard, $3,192,000,000 for the Post
Office and $1,460,000 for the tax
court.
The Senate voted the same to
tal appropriation as the House.
But the measure still must go
back to the lower chamber for
action on a minor amendment
which did not affect the money
figure.
The Senate defeated a series of
amendments by Senator Paul H.
Douglas aimed at trimming
about $162,000,000 from the
Treasury. One Douglas amend
ment would have chopped anoth
er $50,000,000 from postal oper
ating funds.
Demo Leader
Senate Democratic Leader
Lyndon B. Johnson called on
President Flisenhower today to
end his administration's "revolv
ing door" policy on the budget
by siding; with either the "econ
omy wing" or "spending wing."
The Texan complained that ad
ministration officials had made
what he called conflicting state
ments about the President's rec
ord $71,800,000,000 budget for the
fiscal year, starting July 1.
He demanded that Eisenhower
clarify his administration's posi
tion in his nationwide radio and
television address scheduled for
today.
