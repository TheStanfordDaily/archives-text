# Kepler Gives Reasons for Tax Refusal
## 
### 
Seated on the edge of a table
in Room 320 last night, Roy Kep
ler, who made news recently for
refusing to "willingly pay taxes,"
quietly told an audience of about
35 students exactly why. The
talk was sponsored by the Fel
lowship of Reconciliation.
"War is the health of the
state," he said, explaining that he
refused to pay taxes only be
cause so- much of the money is
being used for war preparation.
"With our symbol of the 'na
tional state' the uppermost sym
bol in our minds," said Kepler,
"we are becoming too good at
socially organizing violence."
He explained that man must
learn how to get along without
violence, because we are at Ihe
point where "we must make the
choice between alternatives" of
a nuclear war or peaceful recon
ciliation of beliefs, and "we liter
ally can't afford to make the cru
cial mistake."
"The intentions we have for
wars are different from their ac
tual functions," Kepler said. "The
Americans who set out to end
militarism in World War I are
now one of the greatest military
powers in the world."
"Don't accept everything that's
handed you" by our propaganda
experts, he warned the audience,
"even when accompanied by
bribes of a job, a car and a
house."
