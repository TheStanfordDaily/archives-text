# Thanks to Miss Strogen
## 
### 
Miss Adflf. Sthocf.n has resigned as Assistant
Dean of Women at Stanford. Many students
are surprised; many are deeply upset by the
news.
Students are wondering why she is leaving.
Why would an administrator whose real enjoy
ment is in working with students, and who is
generally acclaimed among the students for
doing her job exceptionally well, want to
leave?
Maybe Miss Strogen has decided to move on »
in order to satisfy her other interests and
ambitions. Apparently she loves to travel and
is interested in both drama and home photog
raphy. Perhaps these ambitions are luring her
away. Or perhaps there is something else not
appearing on the surface which has caused
Miss Strogen to resign her Stanford position.
\\ hatever her reasons for leaving, Miss
Strogen must have taken into consideration the
number of students who will sincerely miss her
both next year and in years to come.
She will be missed for many reasons. Among
them is Iter ability to listen to the confused,

poorly formed ideas llial students romp up with
anil then in one clearly staled sentence tell the
group or individual where their thoughts are
leading them.
Miss Strogen has another invaluable quality.
She can see right through whoever sits across
the <1 esk (nun her. There is no point in telling
her that you would like to (|uit school to go
home and help your family, if the real reason
is that, you are liil hy the wanderlust and want
to lake oil' a quarter to travel. There is a guar
antee that Miss Strogen will find out the truth,
maybe even before you do.
What is more, it is always a pleasure to have
Miss Strogen as adviser to a committee or a
project. She attended all meetings, and her
suggestions were constructive and helpful. It
would be hard to count the Stanford policies
and activities that include strands of Miss
Strogen's help, but there are undoubtedly
many.
Many thanks are in order for Miss Strogen
and also a sincere wish that her new adventure,
whatever it jjiay be, fulfills her ambitions.

would be hard to count the Stanford policies
and activities that include strands of Miss
Strogen's help, but there are undoubtedly
many.
Many thanks are in order for Miss Strogen
and also a sincere wish that her new adventure,
whatever it jjiay be, fulfills her ambitions.
