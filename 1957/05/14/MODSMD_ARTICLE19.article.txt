# Stanford Leadership
## 
### 
For the next year the Pacific Student Presi
dents' Association will be headed by a Stanford
representative, Jim Messinger, the ASSU's
president-elect.
It is good to have Stanford government oflfi
cers*take a position of outstanding leadership
on the West Coast. It has been many years
since Stanford has headed this organization.
I he duties consist mainly of coordinating
the activities for next spring's conference, help
ing iu exchange of ideas between the western
colleges and attending regional conferences.

ll offers .Stanford a cliance to become ac
quainted with oilier college communities and
their problems and to he ahle to add something
itself. Last year Stanford marked a retreat
from group university life bv withdrawing
from the National Students Association. Mes
singer's election marks an advance and a posi
tive step,
11 of eourse marks a challenge to Stanford,
which must have the kind of government next
year that will succeed in the position given it.
We have every eoidideuce that Jim IMessin
ger will live up to tin leader hip challenge.
