Editor, The Daily:
After many objections to Ihe present women's
social regulations, the AVVS rise to action. They
requested suggestions, received many, chose a
few and incorporated these lew into a proposed
new system of regulation.
Despite this well-meant effort, 112 think an in
'justice is being done fo us women. We may ob
ject to particulars in the new system now, but,
when we vote, it is either for or against the en
tire set of regulations. This is about as demo
cratic as the privilege of choosing between Sing
Sing and Aleatraz.
Actually, Stanford's social regulations are ex
emplary compared to those of other universities,
but this doesn't make them sacred or unobiee
1 ionable.
I will not go into the problems of freshman
women because they are considered a special
animal that must "adjust." But we are under

estimating the sophomores, juniors and seniors
if we don't realize that they are adults capable
of handling their own lives and of asking for
advice when I hey deem it necessary.
The system of late leaves itself does not of
fend my sense of freedom. But, 112 contend that
we all have the right to the privacy of going out
without saying where and with whom. Some
people even like to be moral in private. Tf the
university is just doing us the favor of being
able to get in touch with us in case of emer
gency, let's not have the acceptance of this favor
be obligatory.
In conclusion, I would like to go on record
as saying that I shall accept almost any strange
regulation that the women of Stanford vote for,
but I will not sign away my freedom on the oath
incorporated into the new sign-out slips:
