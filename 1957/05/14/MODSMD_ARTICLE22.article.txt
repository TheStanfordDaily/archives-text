## ABC's Women Investigators

"You just don't know whom you can trust nowadays!"
That is the warning issued to under-age drinkers by the Daily
Californian. It seems the California Department of Alcoholic Bever
age Control has, as the Cal paper says, "turned our own kind against
us."
Two female graduates of UC's criminology department are being
employed by Prank Fullenwider, the ABC's area boss, to act as
undercover agents.
The two women, described by ABC officials as "young, attractive
and observant," pose in taverns in sporty garb and nurse their
drinks, having only a limited expense account.
Said the Daily Californian, "In between drinking and brushing
off bar flies, these young ladies actually do a little work.
". . . Not that this would make any difference to University stu
dents, who are too busy with such things as studying, panty raids
and other academic endeavors to frequent bars, but Fullenwider
noted that the two female operatives have already made 'numerous
on-thespot arrests.'"

In Homewood, Baltimore, reporters on Ihe Johns Hopkins Uni
versity News-Letter' recently conducted a "survey" to see which is
worse- a JHU dormitory or a typical Baltimore flophouse.
After spending the night in a 75-cent room on ihe south side of
town, reporter Dave Nissman and "his roommate" came up with
Ihe conclusion thai Ihere is a "lot of similarity between Ihe dormi
tories and l lie 'hotel.' "
"Our sleep," wrote Nissman, "was marred by many disturbances,
the most common <il them being a sort of hacking sound that would
emanate from the lavatories. This was a familiar sound one heard
constantly throughout our own dormitories- sometimes in my own
room."
Nissman said the similarity between the flophouse and his dormi
tory and the lack of "John Steinbeck characters" made for a dull
night. The only difference, he noted, was that in a flophouse in
mates must sleep with their shoes on "Few people who have not
done so have ever found them again."
"In Ihe dormitories," he concluded, "it is rare that one must
sleep with one's shoes on. Unless, of course, one can't lock one's
door."

At the University of Texas, the Daily Texan has finally made
public the story of the university's mysterious dormitory prowler.
Here's what the paper sarid:
Last November, women in a dormitory were listening to radio
reports of a patient's escape from the Ausiin State Mental Hospital.
One of the women, dressed in levis and a man's white shirt and
with her head wrapped in a bandanna, stepped from her second-story
room onto the porch roof to let her freshly washed hair dry.
On impulse she ran across the roof and tapped on one of the
windows in the opposite wing. The woman who had been studying
near the window dropped her book and ran down the hall screaming
"Crazy Man." Police were called and ihe mystery spread.
How the real story finally came out? Who knows.
