With Stanford's Chuck Taylor trying desperately to find a man
who can kick extra points, probably the best toe man in the country
is a freshman at USC.
His name is Don Zacick and, according to Daily Trojan writer
Chuck Signor, he can split the uprights "from 20, 30 and 40 yards
out with ridiculous ease."
The New York Giants Ben Agajanian, who taught Zacick much
of what he knows, has rated him as the finest in the country. With
practice, Zacick can increase his accuracy and distance to a phe
nomenal 50 yards, Agajanian said.
Zucick came to SC from Bainbridge Naval Training Center
where lie kicked of 87 extra points for his service team.

Further campus plagiarism reveals that freshmen are also run
ning wild at USC's neighborly neighbor UCLA. As if ihe Uclan
varsity tennis team wasn't strong enough, the Bruins have on their
freshman squad enough potential to cow rival racketmen into sub
mission for years to come.
In tiie Southern California tennis tournament last week, UCLA
freshman Norm Perry, considered by many to be an even better
prospect than his big brother Bob, stole headlines from the Bruin
varsity. On successive days, young Perry knocked off former SC
tennis captain Jacque Grigry and eighth-seeded Glenn Bassett, both
in tough three-setters.
Also on the freshman team is another highly talented player—
Roger Werksman. In the same tournament, Werksman came within
two points of taking a set from former NCAA and National Clay
Court champ Herb Flam. Flam eventually put out Perry.
Kidding for the first-string quarterback posf, oil Northwestern
University's football team (which Stanford plays here on Sept. 2H)
is Chip llolcomh, brother of the man who accused this University
of high-powered recruiting tactics in the Big Ten area.
Northwestern is supposed to ire strong at QB this year. The
Purple may improve on the 1950 team which wallowed in the Big
Ten second division.

Today on Ihe Sunken Diamond Stanford will be playing Cal in
two games (one ;i four-inning conclusion of Saturday's rained-out
battler which will probably decide who will represent the CIBA in
the NCAA playoffs.
Oregon, whom the Indians beat twice earlier, is the probable
Northern Division representative. The Ducks are led by powerful
Terry Maddox, left fielder, who is leading the team with a lusty . 412
average.
Hatting .389 is Wimp Hastings", the second baseman whose first
name provided Indian bench jockeys with a field day during the
spring vacation double-header here. No one else, though, is hitting
more than .MOO. The team average is .273.
Still, the Ducks, as of May 6, were 2 1 /i» games up on OSC, so the
ND race must not be too tough.
Last place has been securely sewed up by WSC. The WSC Daily
Evergreen ran perhaps the biggest, blackest headline since World
War II last Wednesday in announcing the Cougars had massacred
Idaho, 4-3, to break a seven-game losing sKfcin.

Max Truex, USC's "little put-put machine" of a two-miler, may
receive some competition in Saturday's PCC track meet in Eugene—
and from an unexpected source. Idaho, traditionally the doormat
of the league, is fighting for seventh place this time, and boasts a
26-year-old sophomore, Ray Hatton, who has done the two-mile in
under nine minutes.
Hatton, like his distance running teammate Hick Boyce, is from
Krowrihills, England.

The toughest track squad in the Northern Division is Coach Bill
Bowerman's Oregon team. Not letting the Duck baseball team outdo
them, the UO spikers are undefeated in dual meets so far this season
and Saturday ran away with the ND conference meet.
Oregon boasts the two fastest milers and the three speediest
sprinters in the Northwest, according to the Daily Emerald. In the
mile, Jim Bailey, collegiate mile record holder, and sophomore Jim
Grelle will be pressing Seaman, Bowden and Co. all the way.
The trio of sprint stars from Duckland are football player Jack
Morr is and Jack Brown and Steve Anderson. Anderson has done the
century in :09.5.
As a matter of fact, the Ducks are strong in everything. In the
hurdles, Doug Basham has done 14.4 in the highs and Anderson
and Morris have run one-two in every dual meet this year in the
lows.
Ed Bingham, javelin man. has thrown the spear 226 feet. This
is good enough to press SU's Hank Roldan and USC's Doug Maijala
and Bob Voiles for the title.
Oregon sophomore Ken Grant will be very much in the high
jump competition, having done 6-7 this year.

sprinters in the Northwest, according to the Daily Emerald. In the
mile, Jim Bailey, collegiate mile record holder, and sophomore Jim
Grelle will be pressing Seaman, Bowden and Co. all the way.
The trio of sprint stars from Duckland are football player Jack
Morr is and Jack Brown and Steve Anderson. Anderson has done the
century in :09.5.
As a matter of fact, the Ducks are strong in everything. In the
hurdles, Doug Basham has done 14.4 in the highs and Anderson
and Morris have run one-two in every dual meet this year in the
lows.
Ed Bingham, javelin man. has thrown the spear 226 feet. This
is good enough to press SU's Hank Roldan and USC's Doug Maijala
and Bob Voiles for the title.
Oregon sophomore Ken Grant will be very much in the high
jump competition, having done 6-7 this year.
With Stanford's Chuck Taylor trying desperately to find a man
who can kick extra points, probably the best toe man in the country
is a freshman at USC.
His name is Don Zacick and, according to Daily Trojan writer
Chuck Signor, he can split the uprights "from 20, 30 and 40 yards
out with ridiculous ease."
The New York Giants Ben Agajanian, who taught Zacick much
of what he knows, has rated him as the finest in the country. With
practice, Zacick can increase his accuracy and distance to a phe
nomenal 50 yards, Agajanian said.
Zucick came to SC from Bainbridge Naval Training Center
where lie kicked of 87 extra points for his service team.

Further campus plagiarism reveals that freshmen are also run
ning wild at USC's neighborly neighbor UCLA. As if ihe Uclan
varsity tennis team wasn't strong enough, the Bruins have on their
freshman squad enough potential to cow rival racketmen into sub
mission for years to come.
In tiie Southern California tennis tournament last week, UCLA
freshman Norm Perry, considered by many to be an even better
prospect than his big brother Bob, stole headlines from the Bruin
varsity. On successive days, young Perry knocked off former SC
tennis captain Jacque Grigry and eighth-seeded Glenn Bassett, both
in tough three-setters.
Also on the freshman team is another highly talented player—
Roger Werksman. In the same tournament, Werksman came within
two points of taking a set from former NCAA and National Clay
Court champ Herb Flam. Flam eventually put out Perry.
Kidding for the first-string quarterback posf, oil Northwestern
University's football team (which Stanford plays here on Sept. 2H)

Northwestern is supposed to ire strong at QB this year. The

Today on Ihe Sunken Diamond Stanford will be playing Cal in
two games (one ;i four-inning conclusion of Saturday's rained-out
battler which will probably decide who will represent the CIBA in
the NCAA playoffs.
Oregon, whom the Indians beat twice earlier, is the probable
Northern Division representative. The Ducks are led by powerful
Terry Maddox, left fielder, who is leading the team with a lusty . 412
average.
Hatting .389 is Wimp Hastings", the second baseman whose first
name provided Indian bench jockeys with a field day during the
spring vacation double-header here. No one else, though, is hitting
more than .MOO. The team average is .273.
Still, the Ducks, as of May 6, were 2 1 /i» games up on OSC, so the
ND race must not be too tough.
Last place has been securely sewed up by WSC. The WSC Daily
Evergreen ran perhaps the biggest, blackest headline since World

Idaho, 4-3, to break a seven-game losing sKfcin.

War II last Wednesday in announcing the Cougars had massacred
Idaho, 4-3, to break a seven-game losing sKfcin.

Max Truex, USC's "little put-put machine" of a two-miler, may
receive some competition in Saturday's PCC track meet in Eugene—
and from an unexpected source. Idaho, traditionally the doormat
of the league, is fighting for seventh place this time, and boasts a
26-year-old sophomore, Ray Hatton, who has done the two-mile in
under nine minutes.
Hatton, like his distance running teammate Hick Boyce, is from
Krowrihills, England.

The toughest track squad in the Northern Division is Coach Bill
Bowerman's Oregon team. Not letting the Duck baseball team outdo
them, the UO spikers are undefeated in dual meets so far this season
and Saturday ran away with the ND conference meet.
Oregon boasts the two fastest milers and the three speediest
sprinters in the Northwest, according to the Daily Emerald. In the
mile, Jim Bailey, collegiate mile record holder, and sophomore Jim
Grelle will be pressing Seaman, Bowden and Co. all the way.
The trio of sprint stars from Duckland are football player Jack
Morr is and Jack Brown and Steve Anderson. Anderson has done the
century in :09.5.
As a matter of fact, the Ducks are strong in everything. In the
hurdles, Doug Basham has done 14.4 in the highs and Anderson
and Morris have run one-two in every dual meet this year in the
lows.
Ed Bingham, javelin man. has thrown the spear 226 feet. This
is good enough to press SU's Hank Roldan and USC's Doug Maijala
and Bob Voiles for the title.
Oregon sophomore Ken Grant will be very much in the high
jump competition, having done 6-7 this year.
With Stanford's Chuck Taylor trying desperately to find a man
who can kick extra points, probably the best toe man in the country
is a freshman at USC.
His name is Don Zacick and, according to Daily Trojan writer
Chuck Signor, he can split the uprights "from 20, 30 and 40 yards
out with ridiculous ease."
The New York Giants Ben Agajanian, who taught Zacick much
of what he knows, has rated him as the finest in the country. With
practice, Zacick can increase his accuracy and distance to a phe
nomenal 50 yards, Agajanian said.
Zucick came to SC from Bainbridge Naval Training Center
where lie kicked of 87 extra points for his service team.

Further campus plagiarism reveals that freshmen are also run
ning wild at USC's neighborly neighbor UCLA. As if ihe Uclan
varsity tennis team wasn't strong enough, the Bruins have on their
freshman squad enough potential to cow rival racketmen into sub
mission for years to come.
In tiie Southern California tennis tournament last week, UCLA
freshman Norm Perry, considered by many to be an even better
prospect than his big brother Bob, stole headlines from the Bruin
varsity. On successive days, young Perry knocked off former SC
tennis captain Jacque Grigry and eighth-seeded Glenn Bassett, both
in tough three-setters.
Also on the freshman team is another highly talented player—
Roger Werksman. In the same tournament, Werksman came within
two points of taking a set from former NCAA and National Clay
Court champ Herb Flam. Flam eventually put out Perry.
Kidding for the first-string quarterback posf, oil Northwestern
University's football team (which Stanford plays here on Sept. 2H)
is Chip llolcomh, brother of the man who accused this University
of high-powered recruiting tactics in the Big Ten area.
Northwestern is supposed to ire strong at QB this year. The
Purple may improve on the 1950 team which wallowed in the Big
Ten second division.

Today on Ihe Sunken Diamond Stanford will be playing Cal in
two games (one ;i four-inning conclusion of Saturday's rained-out
battler which will probably decide who will represent the CIBA in
the NCAA playoffs.
Oregon, whom the Indians beat twice earlier, is the probable
Northern Division representative. The Ducks are led by powerful
Terry Maddox, left fielder, who is leading the team with a lusty . 412
average.
Hatting .389 is Wimp Hastings", the second baseman whose first
name provided Indian bench jockeys with a field day during the
spring vacation double-header here. No one else, though, is hitting
more than .MOO. The team average is .273.
Still, the Ducks, as of May 6, were 2 1 /i» games up on OSC, so the
ND race must not be too tough.
