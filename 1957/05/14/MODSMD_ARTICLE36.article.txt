# ANNIVERSARY
## Cornerstone of Physical Plant Laid 70 Years Ago Today 
### Rich Brown 
Impressive, yet simple and unostentatious—the.se were the words
a San Francisco newspaper used to describe the ceremony which
marked the beginning of the physical plant of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University.
That event the laying of the cornerstone—took place 70 years

ago today, or May 14, 1887. That
May 14 was picked as the date
was no accident; Leland Stanford
Jr. had been born May 14, 1868.
Shortly before noon, with Mrs.
Stanford at his side, Leland Stan
ford placed a copper box in the
stone and then sealed and tapped
it with a silver trowel made espe
cially for the occasion.
Flanking the Stanfords were
the Board of Trustees and 800
spectators who had recently ar
rived on the specially watered
down roads.
Pavilion Erected
A canvas-covered pavilion had
been erected "to accommodate the
Board of Trustees, the Men 1 o
Park Presbyterian Church sing
ing class and a few others," the
paper noted. "An organ faced the
choir.
"At one end of the pavilion
hung pictures of the University
and the buildings of the great cen
tral quadrangle as they will be
when completed," the paper re
ported, adding that "the day for
the ceremonies was perfect."
Flags fluttered from posts
which marked the location of fu
ture buildings.
On that day seven decades ago
a large number of items were
placed in the cornerstone. The
list includes:
Photos of Leland Jr., history of
the endowment, photo and short
biography of each trustee, copy of
California enabling act under
which educational institutions can
be legally endowed, book of ad
dresses of Stanford to the trus
tees;
History, Minutes
History of Leland Stanford Jr.
Museum, minutes of first Board
of Trustees meeting, copy of "In
Memoriam—Leland Stanford Jr.,"
one of each type of U.S. coins for
1887, newspapers of May 13, a
keepsake box with contents only
known to Mrs. Stanford;
Programs of cornerstone cere
monies, history of all proceedings
connected with University found
ing (on parchment signed by Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford) and the ad
dress given that day by Federal
Circuit Judge Lorenzo Sawyer.
The stone which the founder
laid and which contains these
items may be seen on the Inner
Quad building to the right of Me
morial Church. A metal plaque
on the cornerstone reads simply:
"Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, May 14, 1887."

the ceremonies was perfect."
