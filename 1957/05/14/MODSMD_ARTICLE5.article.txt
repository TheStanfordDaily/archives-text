Tiger Swanson, candidate for
last week's Con Home King and
Queen contest, was contest run
ner-up and not third as mistaken
ly stated at the Carnival last Fri
day.
In making this correction, AI
Ferris, publicity chairman of
Con Home Week, added that
Stern men, staunch supporters of
Tiger, cast $175 worth of votes
for their candidate.
Third-place winner was Sam,
the Alpha Delt dog, who had
votes totaling $110 cast for him.
Joe Tremendo, contest winner,
brought in $22 L for the Con
Home Drive.
Final Drive total has not yet
been calculated. At noon Sun
day, $10,500 had been netted, but
the figure did not include final
returns from any off-campus so
licitations after Saturday after
noon, nor from the Strawberry
Brunch or the carnival.
