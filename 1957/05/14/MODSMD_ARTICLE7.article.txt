# Traffic Safety Check
## 
### 
Stanford is participating in a community-wide
traffic safety check this week under the auspices
of the Interfraternity Council. A traffic safety
check lane has been set up on Museum Way just

off Palm Drive. The cheek, purely on a voluntary
basis,* will be held from 1 to 5 p.m. through Fri
day.
