: â€”King Feisal of Iraq and King
Saud of Saudi Arabia began pri
vate talks alone today on ways
to end the turmoil in the Arab
world exemplified by events in
Syria and Jordan
Israeli officials in Jerusalem
reported that a severe internal
crisis was developing in Syria be
tween the leftists in power and
the moderates who fear the bur
geoning friendship between Syria
and Russia.
Israeli dispatches said the anti-
Western Syrian regime, which
failed in its efforts to help Jor
danian leftists overthrow King
Hussein, was asking for more aid
from Russia and Egypt.
Display Canceled
Bad weather forced King Fei
sal to call off a scheduled display
for King Saud of the Western
provided military might which
Iraq was prepared to use to pre
vent Syrian intervention in Jor
dan last month during the Jor
danian crisis.
Saud was staying over in Iraq
in order to meet with Hussein at
the border town of Habbaniyah,
probably Thursday.
It was officially confirmed to
day that Hussein would leave
Amman to confer with Saud and
Feisal on ways to insure Jordan
ian independence.
Confer Alone
Their lunch meeting today was
the first time the two monarchs,
whose countries once were bitter
enemies, conferred without their
aides and advisers.
The Iraqi press began attach
ing great significance to the
event.
"King Feisal and King Saud
now are building Arab co-opera
tion on a strong basis which
meets the dire need of Arab
ifnity," one paper said.
Observers predicted the four
day series of meetings between
Iraqi and Saudi leaders would
result in a closer alliance of the
two nations along with Jordan
which would favor the West as
against the "neutralist" Egyp
tian-Syrian bloc.
