# United States To Resume Aid To Yugoslavia
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 14 (UP)
- The administration, disregard
ing protests of Senate Republi
can leaders, announced today
that it is resuming shipments of
jet planes and other military aid
to Yugoslavia.
Senate GOP Leader William F.
Knowland (Calif.) promptly an
nounced that he will try to short
circuit the administration's au
thority to make such shipments,
presumably when Congress acts
on President Eisenhower's new
foreign aid program.
Knowland, who has split with
the President on several other
issues recently, called the deci
sion "a mistake." He was echoed
by Senator Styles Bridg&s (N.H.),
chairman of the Senate Republi
can Policy Committee.
In Line with Policy
But the State Department said
the action was in this country's
interest and was in line with es
tablished U.S. policy "of lending
support to those countries seek
ing to withstand Soviet pres
sure."
It said the action had the Pres
ident's specific approval.
Knowland, who said the United
States already has provided
about $1,200,000,000 worth of aid
to Marshal Tito's government,
said, "I am not in favor of taxing
the American people to support
the economic and political sys
tems of Communist countries
abroad."
"If U.S. Attacked" .
He said there "arc many of
our allies" who are in desperate
need of jet planes and are more
deserving of aid than Tito who
has no commitment even to be
neutral "if the United States
should come under attack."
Bridges, who joined Knowland
in a futile fight against the pro
gram last year, said he has not
changed his mind.
"I am absolutely opposed to
it," Bridges told a reporter.
The military aid program for
Yugoslavia was halted last sum
mer when Congress voted that
the program should he halted un
less the President ruled that it
was vital to U.S. security.
