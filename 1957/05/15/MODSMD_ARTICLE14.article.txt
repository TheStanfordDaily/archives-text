# Ike Asks for Public Support Against Defense Budget Cuts
## Warns Military Funds Cannot Be Reduced Without Danger to U.S.; No 'Cut-Rate' Security 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 14 (UP)â€”President Eisenhower told the
American public tonight that "great reductions" in his record peace
time budget were impossible without gambling with the safety of
the nation.
"There is no cut-rate price for security," the President said in a

nationwide radio - television ad
dress designed to rally public
opinion against deep budget
slashes by the economy - minded
Congress.
Eisenhower spoke from his
White House office several hours
after various Congressional com
mittees made a series of new re
ductions in his $71,800,000,000
spending proposals for next year,
including what some Congress
men called "pretty deep cuts" in
his defense budget.
Accurate as Possible
The President said his budget
was as accurate as possible. If
Congress wants to make big re
ductions, he said, it must be done
by reducing basic programs fixed
by law, including veterans' com
pensation and pensions.
"No great reductions in it.the
budget] are possible unless Con
gress eliminates or curtails exist
ing federal programs, or all of us
demand less service from the
government, or unless we are
willing to gamble with the safety
of our country," he said.
Eisenhower, in apparent recog
nition of sizeable Congressional
sentiment for early tax cuts, held
out hope of such action eventual
ly. But he set no target date for
tax reductions.
"Search Out Ways"
He said his administration was
determined "to search out ways
to save money and manpower so
that the government does not
further add to the inflationary
pressure on the economy."
"If our people join us in this
determination, we can look for
ward to sufficient excess of in
come over expenses to justify fu
ture tax reduction as we continue
paying down on the public debt,"
the President said.
> He pointed out that defense
constituted the largest item in
the budget and that this coun
try has to remain strong and
powerful because Russia has
"the world's largest army"
backed by atomic weapons, rock
ets, missiles and "a large and
growing air, strength."
