iNol a Sacrifice of Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
Yes, the AVVS, wc have risen to action by pro
posing a new system of social regulations. Once
in a while we are given the opportunity to re
evaluate the rules, indeed, the standards under
which we are to live. Now is one of these times,
for if an injustice is being committed, we are
doing it to ourselves. It seems to me that this
is much more than a question of the privilege
of choosing between bread pudding or jello, Sing
Sing or Alcatraz; it is a question of whether or
not we have any obligation whatsoever to live
under any standards as members of this particu
lar University community. More broadly than
that, even, it i,s a question of whether or not
society is ever justified in imposing certain mini
mal restrictions upon us; if there is justification
for these restrictions, does this imply a sacrifice
of personal freedom?
In the first place, I think that the reasons for
changing the present Social regulations are ob
vious to all of us who are living under them.
They have become a nearly incomprehensible
net of technicalities (and technicals!). When a
student does not sign out has she "forgotten"
or has she "failed"? Who knows, and who can
live comfortably under such nebulous terms?
But apparently it is not the necessity for
change or the system of late leaves that has
been challenged. Rather, it seems to be a ques
tion of whether signing one's name lo the state
ment "The above information <about companion
and destination) is accurate and complete to the
best of my ability" is not a sacrifice of freedom.
It is important to begin by pointing out thai in
the first place, the University is responsible' for
the undergraduate women living in dormitories.
Perhaps we do not like this; but this is a fact.
In turn perhaps is it not realistic to believe that,
beyond the fact that the University is doing us
a favor of being able to get in touch with us in
case of emergency, we owe it to them and our
parents and friends, even, to leave some idea of
where we are and what we are doing? Wouldn't
we leave a note to that effect on the telephone
stand at home?
In addition to this, we are living under the
Fundamental Standard. Some question the cur
rent efficacy of this ;nevertheless we are living
under it now. So should it not be implicit that
we are telling the truth to the best of our ability
when we sign out our companion, our destina
tion as we would at home? Of course. This has
always been implicit in the social regulations.
Therefore, if this reasoning is cogent, we seem
to have social regulations for our own protection

(and, really, under the new system the "regula
tions" per se are minimal), and we have an
obligation to follow them as best we are able.
But why must we take a "loyalty oath" on
each late leave? It really does not, it seems to
mo, amount to that. What this statement hopes
to imply is simply that we have consciously
thought about what we are writing. How many
times have we put "Stanford View" for a desti
nation when we knew we were going driving or
when we really didn't know where we were go
ing? To me saying Ihat I have done my best
bears no relation to being "moral in private."
Signing this little statement to me implies that
1 am a member, and of my own free choice (this
is wherein the freedom lies) in the totality of
the community of Stanford as i ( does exist. 1
could not be this member in private.

Con Homo Thanks
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Convalescent Home we would
like to thank the Stanford student body for Ihe
enthusiastic response they gave last week dur
ing the Con Home Drive.
An overwhelming vote of thanks to the 2f>
members ol (he Committee, who organized over
a thousand people and ran their activities in
spite of the rain with amazing smoothness.
Thanks lo the Stanford Daily which spearheaded
.'i publicity campaign that left no one uninformed
and was more responsible for the success of the
drive than any other single factor.
To the class of 1960, which once again gave a
performance unequaled in Stanford history and
broke every record they attempted, we add our
congratulations to those many letters from Palo
Alto citizens who commend them for their good
taste and manners in off-campus solicitations.
To all the living groups on campus which
through the King and Queen contest or their
own projects generated record enthusiasm and
record donations, our sincerest appreciation, as
well as to the sophomore class which sponsored
the successful drive ending Carnival.
It is our hope that the campus will remain
aware of the Con Home throughout the year and
Ihat as many students as possible take the op
portunity to see the children that Iheir dollars
will help so much.
Although Cardinals extends deepest gratitude,
the real thanks can only lie expressed by the
children themselves.
