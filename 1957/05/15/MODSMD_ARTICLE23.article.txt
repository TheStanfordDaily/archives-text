# Lucie Stern Provides Dorms for Cal, SU; Trees, People Lend Names to Buildings
## 
### John Lane 
A few weeks ago a Stanford
man happened to mention that he
was "going to go over to Stern
and pick up the girls" for a dance
his house was having. His audi
ence was suitably shocked.
They had forgotten that the lad
at that time was attending the
University of California, and that
Mrs. Lucie Stern had given a
dormitory for girls at that uni
versity.
At Stanford the name of Stern

Hall honors "Aunt Lucie" Stern, I
who is often remembered not only J
for giving Stanford its independ
ent men's dormitory but also fori
the many times she graciously;
entertained Stanford students in!
her Palo Alto home.
Located across from Stern,
Crothers Hall and Crothers Me
morial Hall were made possible
through gifts of Judge George F.
Crothers, class of '95. Crothers
Memorial is named in honor of
his mother, Margaret Jane
Crothers.
Plugged Legal Holes
During the first years of the
University, Crothers, a young
lawyer after his graduation and
a friend of Mrs. Stanford, was in
strumental in plugging existing
legal holes in the founding grant,
a service which the University
may be thankful for in these
years of subdivisions and free
ways.
Stanford's second president,
John Casper Branner, gave his
name to the dormitory which has
the honor of being the spring
quarter rallying point of "self
pitying procrastinators trying to
shift the blame for their own in
competence to the innocent under
garments of defenseless young
ladies."
Branner stipulated, upon being
chosen president, that he would
remain in office for only two
years. In spite of the urging of
the Board of Trustees, he kept his
promise and retired to work on
a geology textbook—for the de
partment of which he had been
head even during his presidency.
The Wilbur Hall neighbors of
Branner feel that the "apathy"
of which thoy and the rest of the
student body have been accused
is a solid Stanford tradition. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's third
president, after whom the dorm
is named, said in 1918, "The natu
ral conservatism of the student
. . . is one of the most common
but amusing of college phe
nomena."
Plants, Too
Not only persons but also plants
have given their names to many
of the University buildings. Roble,
Encina, Toyon, Madrono, Manza
nita and Sequoia are all Spanish
plants, most of them found in the
University's environs.
The first dormitories at Stan
ford, and consequently the first
to be named, were Encina and the
old Roble. The latter fell into dis
use as a living unit after construc
tion of the present Roble.
The names of both dormitories
are tributes to the omnipresent
California oak tree. Roble is the
Spanish name of the white oak,
while encina is the live oak, so
well known in the California hills.
Could it be that "purity" and
"liveliness" were attributes of the
first classes at Stanford?
Toyon Hall, the eating clubs'
dorm, takes its name from the
beautiful evergreen shrub which
adorns the campus with its white
flowers and red berries.
The madrono and manzanita
bushes, with their smooth red

bark and shiny leaves, have also
given their names to two of the
campus living units. Madrono
Hall was one of the first dormi
tories, and Manzanita still re
mains as one of the Union units.
And, finally, to include the
wives of both the first and the
present presidents of Stanford,
come Jordan House, named after
President Jordan's Jessie, and
Sterling Hall for graduate women
in the Village, after Mrs. Ann
Sterling.

the Board of Trustees, he kept his
promise and retired to work on
a geology textbook—for the de
partment of which he had been
head even during his presidency.
The Wilbur Hall neighbors of
Branner feel that the "apathy"
of which thoy and the rest of the
student body have been accused
is a solid Stanford tradition. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's third
president, after whom the dorm
is named, said in 1918, "The natu
ral conservatism of the student
. . . is one of the most common
but amusing of college phe
nomena."
Plants, Too
Not only persons but also plants
have given their names to many
of the University buildings. Roble,
Encina, Toyon, Madrono, Manza
nita and Sequoia are all Spanish
plants, most of them found in the
University's environs.
The first dormitories at Stan
ford, and consequently the first
to be named, were Encina and the
old Roble. The latter fell into dis
use as a living unit after construc
tion of the present Roble.
The names of both dormitories
are tributes to the omnipresent
California oak tree. Roble is the
Spanish name of the white oak,
while encina is the live oak, so
well known in the California hills.
Could it be that "purity" and
"liveliness" were attributes of the
first classes at Stanford?
Toyon Hall, the eating clubs'
dorm, takes its name from the
beautiful evergreen shrub which
adorns the campus with its white
flowers and red berries.
The madrono and manzanita
bushes, with their smooth red

bark and shiny leaves, have also
given their names to two of the
campus living units. Madrono
Hall was one of the first dormi
tories, and Manzanita still re
mains as one of the Union units.
And, finally, to include the
wives of both the first and the
present presidents of Stanford,
come Jordan House, named after
President Jordan's Jessie, and
Sterling Hall for graduate women
in the Village, after Mrs. Ann
Sterling.
A few weeks ago a Stanford
man happened to mention that he
was "going to go over to Stern
and pick up the girls" for a dance
his house was having. His audi
ence was suitably shocked.
They had forgotten that the lad
at that time was attending the
University of California, and that
Mrs. Lucie Stern had given a
dormitory for girls at that uni
versity.
At Stanford the name of Stern

Hall honors "Aunt Lucie" Stern, I
who is often remembered not only J
for giving Stanford its independ
ent men's dormitory but also fori
the many times she graciously;
entertained Stanford students in!
her Palo Alto home.
Located across from Stern,
Crothers Hall and Crothers Me
morial Hall were made possible
through gifts of Judge George F.
Crothers, class of '95. Crothers
Memorial is named in honor of
his mother, Margaret Jane
Crothers.
Plugged Legal Holes
During the first years of the
University, Crothers, a young
lawyer after his graduation and
a friend of Mrs. Stanford, was in
strumental in plugging existing
legal holes in the founding grant,
a service which the University
may be thankful for in these
years of subdivisions and free
ways.
Stanford's second president,
John Casper Branner, gave his
name to the dormitory which has
the honor of being the spring
quarter rallying point of "self
pitying procrastinators trying to
shift the blame for their own in
competence to the innocent under
garments of defenseless young
ladies."
Branner stipulated, upon being
chosen president, that he would
