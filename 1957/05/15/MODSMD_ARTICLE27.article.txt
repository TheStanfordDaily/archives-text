Be hind heavy brown walls
across the Quad from Ihe Cellar
is a building known as ihe Wom
en's OGbhouse. To a stranger
there couldn't possibly be any
thing appealing or interesting
about this building, but inside its
dingy exterior is the center of
uncountable activities.
Cap and Gown, YWCA and the
Associated Women Students have
offices on the third floor. The
Stanford Women's Club, Faculty
Women's Club, Distaff Club, Stan
ford Dames, bridge clubs, many
religious groups and committees
meet in this building.
As a matter of fact, so many
groups meet and discuss their
problems and plans in this build
ing that it. is necessary to make
reservations for space well in ad
vance of the planned date of ac
tivity.
Individual Activities
The Women's Clubhouse is not
only the heart of many group ac
tivities; it also caters to individ
uals' activities.
The other day there was a Stan
ford woman using the excellent
kitchen facilities to bake cookies
to send to her distant boy friend,
and during mornings the rooms
in the clubhouse have been dis
covered by many as comfortable,
quiet places to study, write let
ters, or just sit.
There is also a guest room,
where in the past years Stanford
guests from all over the world
have stayed.
Meet Mrs Tibby
These guests and those who
schedule rooms in person get to
meet Mrs. Dorothy Tibby. Mrs.
Tibby is in charge of Ihe office
at the clubhouse. Her home can
be found by walking downstairs,
taking a quick turn to the left and
walking to the end of the hall.
Mrs. Tibby said she has been there
a good many years.
Mrs. Tibby also explained that
the clubhouse is run by a board
of directors. The board does the
official planning and operating of
the clubhouse.
Recently the board redecorated
one of the upstairs meeting rooms
in modern, low, brightly colored
furniture. This, according to Mrs.
Tibby, was to make it more com
fortable for the many groups who
meet there.
