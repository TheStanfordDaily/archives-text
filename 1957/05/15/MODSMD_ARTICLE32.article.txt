# PCC MEET
## Northern Division Trackmen May Turn Tables This Time 
### Dick Barnes 
Every year the Northern Divi
sion of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence holds its own divisional track
and field championships.
And it's probably a good Ihing
that the five northern schools
have this meet where they can
pick up lots of medals, because
when they meet Ihc Southern Di
vision schools in the annual PCC
spikefest, honors are usually few
and far between for Oregon State,
Washington, Idaho, Oregon and
Washington State.
In ihe 26-year history of the
PCC meet, the schools from the

north have chalked up just four
team victories none of them
more recent than 1923.
At last year's meet, for exam
ple. the five schools tallied just
41'2 poirrts to 183*2 for the four
California schools, which took
four of the first five places. Only
two individual winners came from
north of the California state lino
.Jim Bailey and Bill Dellinger,
both of Oregon.
Mt Improved
In spite of this bleak history,
there seems to be a good possi
bility that the Northern Division
is going to distinguish itself more
than usual at the 1957 PCC title
meet, to be held at Oregon's Hay
ward Field this Friday and Sat
urday.
Oregon is the most loaded of
the five teams, ;is evidenced by
its lopsided victory in last week
end's northern division meel. The
Ducks had winners in seven of
the 15 events'and took the first
three spots in. the javelin and
broad jump.
The big-name star of the Ore
gon leam is four-minute-miler Jim
Bailey. Ife loafed around the four
laps in 4:17.5 in the NI) meet,
then returned to take first place
in the 880 with a 1:52.5 effort.

Bailey is defending PCC champ !
in the mile and figures to be run- j
ning a lot faster than 4:17 come
Saturday. He'll have plenty of
competition, too, with Don Bow
den (4:01.6 relay leg) and Bob
Seaman (4:05.6) heading up a
speedy contingent from the Cali
fornia schools.
Stanford's F rank Herrmann,'
the early favorite in the broad I
jump, is going to get a stiff bat
tle from Martirj Pedigo, the leap- j
ing surprise from Oregon. Pedigo
surpassed his previous best by
nearly two feet when he soared
25-2' L* in Iho ND championships,
putting him only inch back of
Herrmann.
Washington's 440 star with the
paradoxical name, Terry Tobacco,
rates a good chance to win the
PCC title in his specialty.
Canadian Olympian
Tobacco has already toured the
lap in 47.5 this year, just three
tenths back of Paiss Ellis' 47.2â€”
best mark on the coast. But Ellis
had the advantage of running on
the lightning - fast Fresno track
and may have a tough time beat
ing Tobacco.
The Husky ace is a Canadian
and represented his country in
the Olympics. He won his first
round heat of the 400 meters in
47.9, but was barely eliminated in
the second round as he clocked j
47.7.
Basket bailer Wayne Moss of j
Oregon State will be one of many
contenders in the wide-open high
jump. He's already climbed 6-7%
this year, just : S inch less than j
Stanford's Phil Fehlen, the em
rent PCC leader.

Coach Jordan announced last
night that both Joe Woollett
and Bob Hyde will make "ihe
trip north to compete in the
relay, due to their strong show
ing in competition for the 12th
nian slot.
