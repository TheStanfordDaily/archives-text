terday by downing Stanford twice i
—5-1, in the continuation of Sat-j
urday's rain-halted game, and 9-4 j
in a seven inning slugfest.
The games wound up Stanford's I
conference season, giving the
Cards a 5-7 mark in the Pacific
Coast Conference Southern Divi
sion and a 7-9 record in the CIBA.
Cal still has a chance to tie
league-leading Southern Califor
nia as the Bears boast a 10-4 rec
ord with two games against the i
Trojans left to be played.

in the NCAA playoffs, however, j
as the Trojans are ineligible for |
NCAA championship play.

relief hurler Kim Elliot combined
to set down the Cards in the sev
en-inning second game yesterday.

through the remaining five in-1
nings, with Art Von Wronski's
third - inning double against the
left-field bank being the only hit
off ihe big right hander.
Indian Uprising
After Cal had taken a 1-0 lead
in the first inning, Stanford roar
ed back for four in the second.

off the bank, scoring Payne and
Steve Stewart.
The Bears got four in the third
to go ahead, 5-4, on a triple by
Ron Gaggero, singles by Charlie
Thompson and Bob Puceinelli, a
wild pitch, a walk and Kelly's
two-bagger.
A double by Robinson followed
by Thompson's single added an
other run in the fifth.
