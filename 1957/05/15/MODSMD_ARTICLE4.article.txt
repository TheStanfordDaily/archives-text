## 
### 
Three floors of Soto House,
Wilbur Hall, were "deluged"
with three inches of water ear
ly yesterday morning when
someone apparently plugged
up all washroom basins and
let the water run.
Students woke up to find the
floors of their rooms coated
with water. An official of the :
Corporation Yard, which helped
in "mopping â€¢ up" operations,
said that damage wasn't seri
ous.
The intercom system was
not hurt because of waterproof
wire, the official said, and"the
only effect was the floor's get
ting a good washing."
