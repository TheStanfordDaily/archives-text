## Hoover Long Ago Impressed By Hill Overlooking Stanford 
### Dave Canfield 
It must have been a bright,
sunshiny day some 60-odd years
ago when a Stanford undergrad
uate named Herbert Clark Hoo
ver, '95, stood atop a hill over
looking the campus.
Hoover - was so impressed with
the view that he there and then
picked out that very spot as the
site of his future home.
A quarter of a century later—
after forging a successful career
as a mining engineer and public
servant — the ex-lowa farm boy
again stood on the same spot.
With him were the architects for
the home of his dreams—E. B.
Clark (a former Stanford emeri
tus professor) and his son Birge
Clark, now a Palo Alto architect
and Stanford University lecturer
in architecture.
Dream Home
The dream home took shape
throughout the year - 1919 and
construction was completed in
1920—the same year the Repub
lican National Convention by
passed Hoover and Hiram John
son and vaulted darkhorse War
ren G. Harding into the lime
light.
The house itself has defied ef
forts of architects to describe it.
After viewing the beautiful "big
white house on the hill," experts
have come away from 623 Miran
da St. with divergent impres
sions.
Some architects classified it as
"pueblo." Others saw Algerian
influences, while a German pub
lication in the 1930's said the
house was "modernistic."
"Functionalisni"
Birge Clark himself saw in the
structure a certain "functional
ism" and said its interior had
strong English influences.
The roof of the house was set
aside as a sun deck and recrea
tional area. This was the wish of
Mrs. Hoover, who, like her hus
band, was graduated from the

Stanford Department of Geology
and Mining.
During the years after 1920,
the Hoovers spent most of (heir
time in this house, leaving it
only for his four-year term in
the White House.
The death of his wife in 1944
led Hoover to abandon his luxu
rious hilltop home and move to
New York City. In November,
1945, President Donald Tresidder
announced that Hoover - had given
his house to Stanford to be the
official residence of the Univer
sity president.
Hoover asked that it be named
Lou Henry Hoover House, in
memory of his wife.
Thus, thousands of freshmen,
filing through the house during
Orientation Week to shake hands
with Presidents Tresidder and
Wallace Sterling, have been able
to admire the view which once
made such a lasting impression
on young Herbert Hoover.
