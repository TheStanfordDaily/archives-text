# Injunction on Soil Bank Plan May Be Asked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 11 (UP)
Democratic farm leaders said
today they may ask the House to
morrow to impose a "temporary
injunction" against soil bank
spending until Congress decides
whether to extend the program
beyond the next fiscal year.
The proposal, if adopted by
Congress, would dramatize Dern
ocratic charges of "waste" and
lax administration of the multi
billion-dollar soil bank program.
The administration's overall
farm program came under with
ering attack earlier by Represen
tative Jamie L. Whitten <D-
Miss.) who claimed it may "help
bring romance to the farmer's
daughter" but that it is bringing
only ruin to the farmer.
"Acreage Reserve"
The injunction plan would re
duce to zero the proposed $500-
million limitation on funds which
the administration can request in
next year's budget for the "acre
age reserve" phase of the soil
bank.
The proposal set the stage for
a head-on clash with administra
tion forces when the House votes
tomorrow on the farm appropri
ations bill. The bill calls for $3,-
692,889,757 to finance farm pro-;
grams in the fiscal year starting
July 1 and to pick up the tab on
past farm losses.
Whitten, a farm program crit- !
ic, headed the subcommittee
which originally recommended
cutting the Agriculture Depart
ment money bill $272 million be
low administration requests.
Farmer's Daughter
He brought up the farmer's,
daughter in attacking the depart-1
merit's rural development pro
gram. He said the department
had spent an average of $36,000
per county in 57 low-income coun- j
ties to pay its farm agents.
"Some farmers may have at
tractive daughters," Whitten
said. "Some agents may be hand
some. The program may lead to
romance. It may lead to matjy
things." #
But he said it was not going to
learl to farm prosperity as long
as Benson persisted in reducing
government price supports and
planting allotments.

today they may ask the House to
morrow to impose a "temporary
injunction" against soil bank
spending until Congress decides
whether to extend the program
beyond the next fiscal year.
The proposal, if adopted by
Congress, would dramatize Dern
ocratic charges of "waste" and
lax administration of the multi
billion-dollar soil bank program.
The administration's overall
farm program came under with
ering attack earlier by Represen
tative Jamie L. Whitten <D-
Miss.) who claimed it may "help
bring romance to the farmer's
daughter" but that it is bringing
only ruin to the farmer.
"Acreage Reserve"
The injunction plan would re
duce to zero the proposed $500-
million limitation on funds which
the administration can request in
next year's budget for the "acre
age reserve" phase of the soil
bank.
The proposal set the stage for
a head-on clash with administra
tion forces when the House votes
tomorrow on the farm appropri
ations bill. The bill calls for $3,-
692,889,757 to finance farm pro-;
grams in the fiscal year starting
July 1 and to pick up the tab on
past farm losses.
Whitten, a farm program crit- !
ic, headed the subcommittee
which originally recommended
cutting the Agriculture Depart
ment money bill $272 million be
low administration requests.
Farmer's Daughter
He brought up the farmer's,
daughter in attacking the depart-1
merit's rural development pro
gram. He said the department
had spent an average of $36,000
per county in 57 low-income coun- j
ties to pay its farm agents.
"Some farmers may have at
tractive daughters," Whitten
said. "Some agents may be hand
some. The program may lead to
romance. It may lead to matjy
things." #
But he said it was not going to
learl to farm prosperity as long
as Benson persisted in reducing
government price supports and
planting allotments.
