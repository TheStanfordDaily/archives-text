## Floods Fall Back in Texas; Storms Threaten Mid-West 
### United Press 
Flood waters fell back from devastated areas in Texas yesterday,
but an ominous storm system threatened states from Alabama to
Wisconsin. 5 «
The U.S. Weather Bureau issued warnings of violent thunder
storms and possible tornadoes for parts of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois,

Minnesota and Michigan, includ
ing the Detroit area.
Almost as the warnings were
posted, a tornado funnel was
sighted swirling off the ground
near Anamosa, Iowa, and a
twister destroyed or damaged
several farm buildings near
Blooming Prairie, Minn. No one
was injured in the Minnesota
twister.
In Ohio a squall caved in a sec
tion of the roof of the Wayne
County National Bank at Woos
ter. Three persons were injured,
two critically. The winds, pack
ing 90-mile-an-hour gusts, also
swept through Akron, Mansfield,
Now Philadelphia and western
Cleveland. Power lines were
torn down and trees damaged in
the Cleveland area.
Another System
Another storm system drove
eastward from the lower Missis
sippi River. It threatened to stir
up lashing windstorms in parts
of Tennessee, Mississippi and Al
abama.
The new storm was a continu
ation of the twisters and flooding
rains which have battered Texas
and the Southland for two days.
The United Press counted 12
weather-caused deaths during the
period, six in Texas and the lat
est near Grenada, Miss., where
thunderstorms overturned a boat
full of fishermen and one of
them drowned.
The sun broke out over Texas
floodlands for the first time in
days Tuesday, and, in the shat
tered city of Lampasas, Sulphur
Creek was back in its banks af
ter a murderous rampage.
Army engineers worked with
giantcranes, trying to restore
order to the town where Sulphur
j Creek's waters had destroyed or
| damaged 448 homes and caused
; throe to five million dollars' dam
age.
A Stranger
One woman told how she re
turned to her home, which had
boon swept across a street, and
mot a stranger coming out the
front door with his arms full of
her kitchen utensils.
Another woman, wife of one
of the city's four flood dead, told
how she kept piling up mat
tresses in her home to keep her
paralyzed husband safe. She ran
lout of mattresses and he
j drowned.
The danger of major floods ap
peared over in Texas for the time
being. But many streams wore
I still bank-full and thunderstorms
were predicted for West and
North Central Texas today.

floodlands for the first time in
days Tuesday, and, in the shat
tered city of Lampasas, Sulphur
Creek was back in its banks af
ter a murderous rampage.
Army engineers worked with
giantcranes, trying to restore
order to the town where Sulphur
j Creek's waters had destroyed or
| damaged 448 homes and caused
; throe to five million dollars' dam
age.
A Stranger
One woman told how she re
turned to her home, which had
boon swept across a street, and
mot a stranger coming out the
front door with his arms full of
her kitchen utensils.
Another woman, wife of one
of the city's four flood dead, told
how she kept piling up mat
tresses in her home to keep her
paralyzed husband safe. She ran
lout of mattresses and he
j drowned.
The danger of major floods ap
peared over in Texas for the time
being. But many streams wore
I still bank-full and thunderstorms
were predicted for West and
North Central Texas today.
Flood waters fell back from devastated areas in Texas yesterday,
but an ominous storm system threatened states from Alabama to
Wisconsin. 5 «
The U.S. Weather Bureau issued warnings of violent thunder
storms and possible tornadoes for parts of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois,

Minnesota and Michigan, includ
ing the Detroit area.
Almost as the warnings were
posted, a tornado funnel was
sighted swirling off the ground
near Anamosa, Iowa, and a
twister destroyed or damaged
several farm buildings near
Blooming Prairie, Minn. No one
was injured in the Minnesota
twister.
In Ohio a squall caved in a sec
tion of the roof of the Wayne
County National Bank at Woos
ter. Three persons were injured,
two critically. The winds, pack
ing 90-mile-an-hour gusts, also
swept through Akron, Mansfield,
Now Philadelphia and western
Cleveland. Power lines were
torn down and trees damaged in
the Cleveland area.
Another System
Another storm system drove
eastward from the lower Missis
sippi River. It threatened to stir
up lashing windstorms in parts
of Tennessee, Mississippi and Al
abama.
The new storm was a continu
ation of the twisters and flooding
rains which have battered Texas
and the Southland for two days.
The United Press counted 12
weather-caused deaths during the
period, six in Texas and the lat
est near Grenada, Miss., where
thunderstorms overturned a boat
full of fishermen and one of
them drowned.
