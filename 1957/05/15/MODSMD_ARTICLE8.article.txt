Landa said Beck turned down the
offer. He said he didn't know
why.

He said only that they proposed
"s peri 112 ie recommendations of
what we feel is best for the union
from a public relations stand
point." He declined to amplify.
Other sources said, however,
that the recommendation was in
eluded in a report on the public's
reaction to the disclosures of the
Senate committee.
The advisers also were said to
have recommended the resigna
tion of Sidney Brennan, Minneap
olis vice - president convicted of

said Meany then agreed to a con
ference.
In a further development, the
Senate committee, which has
prompted much of Beck's trou
bles, heard an attorney testify
that Beck passed up a stock deal
that could have netted him as
much as $180,000.
The attorney is Alfons Landa,
a partner in the law firm that
once represented Beck. He is also
a director of the Fruehauf Trail
er Co.
Landa testified he once offered
Back "as a gift" one-half of his
earnings in a side stock deal.
Landa said Beck turned down the
offer. He said he didn't know
why.
