# Quaker Talks At 'Y' Meeting On Segregation
## NAACP Member Tells Group of Montgomery Discrimination Cases 
### 
NAACP member Dr. Cecil Tho
mas yesterday told the "Y" Pub
lic Affairs Group that in Mont
gomery, Ala., "somebody is wrong
and the pipeline to God is con
fused."
Thomas, a Quaker, made the
trip to Montgomery iast summer
with friends He snirl that, al
though the leader of the Mont
gomery bus boycott was the Rev.
Martin Luther King, several white
ministers in the Alabama city
firmly believe in segregation.
During his stay in the South
Thomas was asked to sign a
pledge put out by the Montgom
ery County Citizens' Council that
denounced Communism, integra
tion. mongrelism, socialism and
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
He declined to do so.
Instances of Segregation
Thomas, a dynamic speaker,
gave several instances of segre
gation in the South. In one such
incident, a 15-year-old high school
colored girl refused to give up her
bus seat in the section for Ne
groes and whites when it was de
manded by a white man. She was
taken to jail and had to pay a $15
fine.
During the war German pris
onars were guarded partly by
Negro soldiers. The Germans
could eat in the white restaurants,
but the Negroes could not.
No Negro Votes
In a certain community Ne
groes outnumber whites three to
one, yet not one Negro voted in
the last election. In Greyhound
bus terminals there are separate
waiting rooms for white and col
ored people, which defies the Su
preme Court ruling.
Thomas related that this Friday
50,000 people will make a prayer
pilgrimage to Washington to pray
for a peaceful solution to the in
tegration problem. He noted that
so far most newspapers have re
frained from mentioning this pil
grimage, which will bring togeth
er men from all over the nation.
