# Audience Is Enthusiastic About First Performance Of Lively Spring Show
## Repeat Showings Scheduled to Run Through Saturday Night in Mem Aud 
### Rich Brown 
An enthusiastic audience last night greeted an enthusiastic cast
to make a highly successful opening night of this year's Spring
Show -"Out of This World."
Repeat performances are scheduled tonight through Saturday
with 8:15 curtains in Memorial Auditorium.

When Cole Porter picked the
title for this musical comedy, he
wasn't kidding. From the min
ute the curtain ascended, reveal
ing the Greek messenger god
Mercury, to the end of the show,
one could not escape the feeling
of being in a land of fantasy.
The age - old Amphitryon leg
end was brought up to date by
mixing a modern American coup
le—on their honeymoon, no less
—with a host of Greek gods and
goddesses.
Central Role
With Raold Reitan in the cen
tral role of the woman-chasing
Jupiter, and Missy Edwards
playing the part of Jupiter's
rightly suspicious wife Juno, Ro
berta Grant and William Kinsolv
ing are the newly-weds, Helen
and Art O'Malley.
Jupiter decides he'd like Helen,
so he dispatches Mercury, his
son and "celestial bellhop," to
send the Americans over to
Greece, Jupiters' habitat.
The sprightly Mercury, played
by David Whorf, came close to
stealing the show. With a vi
brant personality, Mercury gets
results by becoming the mortal
"Mr. Simpson," and arranging
for a magazine editor to send
O'Malley to Greece to get a story
on a hiding Chicago gangster.
At Gangster's House
Helen goes along with her hus
band and the two land at the
house of the racketeer, although
neither knows it at first. Mark
Hammer ably portrays the gang
ster.
On orders from Jupiter, Mer
cury gets rid of Art by sending
him out in the sticks to find the
racketeer. With Art gone, Jupi
ter sees his chance and presents
himself to Helen. First, however,
in a flash of lightning he takes
on Art's appearance.
Makes Love
As the mortal-appearing king
of the gods makes love to Helen,
the goddess Night, beautifully
acted and danced by Jean Mc-
Carter, changes day to night.
Helen only thinks she spends the
night with her husband.
Meanwhile, Juno is hot in pur
suit of her husband and goes to
the gangster's house. Suspect
ing Jupiter of assuming mortal
form, Juno grabs the racketeer
and drags her "husband" back to
the top of Mount Olympus.
The gangster, known as Niki
Skolianos, meets the entire fam
ily of gods before making his es
cape. Among the gods and god
desses, Venus (Mary Jane Bron
son) was most conspicuous be
cause of her relative inactivity.
Mercury nearly has his own
romance with a mortal, Chloe,
acted by Betsy Flint.
Art Returns
More fun takes place when
Art, disappointed at not finding
Niki, returns at the same time
Jupiter is with Helen. After sev
eral rollicking incidents, Jupiter
returns to Olympus and the
Americans are left to lead a nor
mal life.
"Out of This World" probably
will not be ranked with such mu
sical comedy greats as "Kiss Me,
Kate," largely because Porter
did not provide as many lilty,
catchy melodies. In trying to be
descriptive, some of the numbers
sounded slightly weird.
Fine Entertainment
The show provides excellent
entertainment, in spite of a few
minor technical shortcomings.
For a student group. Ram's Head
has done an outstanding .job.
No small amount, of credit is
due to Director Bill Davis, scen
ery and costume designers Mar
go Fargo and Lewis Heneford,
musical and assistant musical di
rectors Jon Elkus and John Mil
Irr, the 21-piece orchestra and all
the unseen technical workers.

O'Malley to Greece to get a story
on a hiding Chicago gangster.
At Gangster's House
Helen goes along with her hus
band and the two land at the
house of the racketeer, although
neither knows it at first. Mark
Hammer ably portrays the gang
ster.
On orders from Jupiter, Mer
cury gets rid of Art by sending
him out in the sticks to find the
racketeer. With Art gone, Jupi
ter sees his chance and presents
himself to Helen. First, however,
in a flash of lightning he takes
on Art's appearance.
Makes Love
As the mortal-appearing king
of the gods makes love to Helen,
the goddess Night, beautifully
acted and danced by Jean Mc-
Carter, changes day to night.
Helen only thinks she spends the
night with her husband.
Meanwhile, Juno is hot in pur
suit of her husband and goes to
the gangster's house. Suspect
ing Jupiter of assuming mortal
form, Juno grabs the racketeer
and drags her "husband" back to
the top of Mount Olympus.
The gangster, known as Niki
Skolianos, meets the entire fam
ily of gods before making his es
cape. Among the gods and god
desses, Venus (Mary Jane Bron
son) was most conspicuous be
cause of her relative inactivity.
Mercury nearly has his own
romance with a mortal, Chloe,
acted by Betsy Flint.
Art Returns
More fun takes place when
Art, disappointed at not finding
Niki, returns at the same time
Jupiter is with Helen. After sev
eral rollicking incidents, Jupiter
returns to Olympus and the
Americans are left to lead a nor
mal life.
"Out of This World" probably
will not be ranked with such mu
sical comedy greats as "Kiss Me,
Kate," largely because Porter
did not provide as many lilty,
catchy melodies. In trying to be
descriptive, some of the numbers
sounded slightly weird.
Fine Entertainment
The show provides excellent
entertainment, in spite of a few
minor technical shortcomings.
For a student group. Ram's Head
has done an outstanding .job.
No small amount, of credit is
due to Director Bill Davis, scen
ery and costume designers Mar
go Fargo and Lewis Heneford,
musical and assistant musical di
rectors Jon Elkus and John Mil

OPENS SJ'RING SHOW —Mercury (David Whorf) appeared on
stage of Memorial Auditorium as the curtain went up last night,
lo set the mood for the two-act musical comedy "Out of This
World." Alter a quick change of outfits, Mercury became "Mr.
Simpson," who arranged many strange happenings for an Ameri

again tonight, tomorrow and Saturday. Curtain time is 8:15. Tick

An enthusiastic audience last night greeted an enthusiastic cast
to make a highly successful opening night of this year's Spring
Show -"Out of This World."
Repeat performances are scheduled tonight through Saturday
with 8:15 curtains in Memorial Auditorium.

When Cole Porter picked the
title for this musical comedy, he
wasn't kidding. From the min
ute the curtain ascended, reveal
ing the Greek messenger god
Mercury, to the end of the show,
one could not escape the feeling
of being in a land of fantasy.
The age - old Amphitryon leg
end was brought up to date by
mixing a modern American coup
le—on their honeymoon, no less
—with a host of Greek gods and
goddesses.
Central Role
With Raold Reitan in the cen
tral role of the woman-chasing
Jupiter, and Missy Edwards
playing the part of Jupiter's

and Art O'Malley.
Jupiter decides he'd like Helen,
so he dispatches Mercury, his
son and "celestial bellhop," to
send the Americans over to
Greece, Jupiters' habitat.
The sprightly Mercury, played

"Out of This World" probably
will not be ranked with such mu

sounded slightly weird.

OPENS SJ'RING SHOW —Mercury (David Whorf) appeared on
stage of Memorial Auditorium as the curtain went up last night,
lo set the mood for the two-act musical comedy "Out of This
World." Alter a quick change of outfits, Mercury became "Mr.
Simpson," who arranged many strange happenings for an Ameri
can couple honeymooning 1 in Greece. The Spring Show will play
again tonight, tomorrow and Saturday. Curtain time is 8:15. Tick
ets are on sale at the box office for $1, $1.25 and $1.50.
An enthusiastic audience last night greeted an enthusiastic cast
to make a highly successful opening night of this year's Spring
Show -"Out of This World."
Repeat performances are scheduled tonight through Saturday
with 8:15 curtains in Memorial Auditorium.

When Cole Porter picked the
title for this musical comedy, he
wasn't kidding. From the min
ute the curtain ascended, reveal
ing the Greek messenger god
Mercury, to the end of the show,
one could not escape the feeling
of being in a land of fantasy.
The age - old Amphitryon leg
end was brought up to date by
mixing a modern American coup
le—on their honeymoon, no less
—with a host of Greek gods and
goddesses.
Central Role
With Raold Reitan in the cen
tral role of the woman-chasing
Jupiter, and Missy Edwards
playing the part of Jupiter's
rightly suspicious wife Juno, Ro
berta Grant and William Kinsolv
ing are the newly-weds, Helen
and Art O'Malley.
Jupiter decides he'd like Helen,
so he dispatches Mercury, his
son and "celestial bellhop," to
send the Americans over to
Greece, Jupiters' habitat.
The sprightly Mercury, played
by David Whorf, came close to
stealing the show. With a vi
brant personality, Mercury gets
results by becoming the mortal
"Mr. Simpson," and arranging
for a magazine editor to send
O'Malley to Greece to get a story
on a hiding Chicago gangster.
At Gangster's House
Helen goes along with her hus
band and the two land at the
house of the racketeer, although
neither knows it at first. Mark
Hammer ably portrays the gang
ster.
On orders from Jupiter, Mer
cury gets rid of Art by sending
him out in the sticks to find the
racketeer. With Art gone, Jupi
ter sees his chance and presents
himself to Helen. First, however,
in a flash of lightning he takes
on Art's appearance.
Makes Love
As the mortal-appearing king
of the gods makes love to Helen,
the goddess Night, beautifully
acted and danced by Jean Mc-
Carter, changes day to night.
Helen only thinks she spends the
night with her husband.
Meanwhile, Juno is hot in pur
suit of her husband and goes to
the gangster's house. Suspect
ing Jupiter of assuming mortal
form, Juno grabs the racketeer
and drags her "husband" back to
the top of Mount Olympus.
The gangster, known as Niki
Skolianos, meets the entire fam
ily of gods before making his es
cape. Among the gods and god
desses, Venus (Mary Jane Bron
son) was most conspicuous be
cause of her relative inactivity.
Mercury nearly has his own
romance with a mortal, Chloe,
acted by Betsy Flint.
Art Returns
More fun takes place when
Art, disappointed at not finding
Niki, returns at the same time
Jupiter is with Helen. After sev
eral rollicking incidents, Jupiter
returns to Olympus and the
Americans are left to lead a nor
mal life.
"Out of This World" probably
will not be ranked with such mu
sical comedy greats as "Kiss Me,
Kate," largely because Porter
did not provide as many lilty,
catchy melodies. In trying to be
