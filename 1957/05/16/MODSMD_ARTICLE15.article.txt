The deadline for ordering sen

the limited number ordered from

seniors order by that time in
order to receive any.
Announcements are 50 cents
each, and programs $1.50 each.
The cover was designed by Phi
Delt Ken Billings.
The Senior Class Excom wish- j
es to stress that the recipient of
a graduation announcement is j
not required to send a gift to the j
tM-nduatinc srninr.
