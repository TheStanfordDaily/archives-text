# First British H-Bomb Exploded Over Pacific
## England Third World Power To Have Bomb 
### 
LONDON, May 15 (UPI- Brit
ain exploded its first hydrogen
bomb today in a test staged high
over the Pacific Ocean to prevent
lethal fall-out from contaminating
the earth's atmosphere.
The huge "nuclear device" tum
bled from a Valiant jet bomber's
specially built bomb-bay at a se
cret location near Britain's Christ
mas Island experimental nuclear
base, in the mid-Pacific just be
low the equator.
It made Britain the third among
world powers to possess the ll
bomb. The others are the United
States and Soviet Russia.
The blast climaxed a two-year
crash program first authorized by
former Prime Minister Anthony
Eden and pushed with equal vigor
by Prime Minister Harold Macmil
lan, his successor, in spite of bit
ter protests from Japan, some sci
entists and British Laborites.
"Nuclear Device"
An official announcement is
sued in London by the Ministry
of Interior said only that a "nu
clear device" was exploded. Offi
cial sources said it was in fact the
first British "megaton" bomb.
The brief announcement said:
"The Minister of Supply, Dr.
Aubrey Jones, has received a re
port from Air Vice-Marshal W. E.
Oulton, commander of the task
force, and Mr. W. R. J. Cook, sci
entific director of the trials, that
the first explosion of a nuclear
device in the present series took
place at a high altitude in the
central Pacific today.
"Scientific records are being
collected for accurate evaluation.
A further statement will be made
in due course."
Controversy
The announcement by Britain
earlier this year that it planned
a series of nuclear weapons tests
at the Christmas Island proving
grounds touched off a full-blown
controversy both at home and
abroad. Japan sent a special envoy
to appeal directly to Prime Min
ister Macmillan to postpone the
tests. Opposition Laborites joined
in urging a delay.
(In Honolulu the U.S. weather
bureau said conditions in the
Christmas Island area were "just
about perfect" for today's test
blast. Winds were light and vari
able from 10,000 to 60,000 feet,
and their northwesterly direction
would carry fallout away from
any populated areas.)
A Valiant four-jet bomber, man
ned by a volunteer crew of Royal
Air Force men, dropped the bomb
from the substratosphere to pre
vent its fallout from contaminat
ing the lower atmosphere.

blast. Winds were light and vari
able from 10,000 to 60,000 feet,

LONDON, May 15 (UPI- Brit
ain exploded its first hydrogen
bomb today in a test staged high
over the Pacific Ocean to prevent
lethal fall-out from contaminating
the earth's atmosphere.
The huge "nuclear device" tum
bled from a Valiant jet bomber's
specially built bomb-bay at a se
cret location near Britain's Christ
mas Island experimental nuclear
base, in the mid-Pacific just be
low the equator.
It made Britain the third among
world powers to possess the ll
bomb. The others are the United
States and Soviet Russia.
The blast climaxed a two-year
crash program first authorized by
former Prime Minister Anthony
Eden and pushed with equal vigor
by Prime Minister Harold Macmil
lan, his successor, in spite of bit
ter protests from Japan, some sci
entists and British Laborites.
"Nuclear Device"
An official announcement is
sued in London by the Ministry
of Interior said only that a "nu
clear device" was exploded. Offi
cial sources said it was in fact the
first British "megaton" bomb.
The brief announcement said:
"The Minister of Supply, Dr.
Aubrey Jones, has received a re
port from Air Vice-Marshal W. E.
Oulton, commander of the task
force, and Mr. W. R. J. Cook, sci
entific director of the trials, that
the first explosion of a nuclear
device in the present series took
place at a high altitude in the
central Pacific today.
"Scientific records are being
collected for accurate evaluation.
A further statement will be made
in due course."
Controversy
The announcement by Britain
earlier this year that it planned
a series of nuclear weapons tests
at the Christmas Island proving
grounds touched off a full-blown
controversy both at home and
abroad. Japan sent a special envoy
to appeal directly to Prime Min
ister Macmillan to postpone the
tests. Opposition Laborites joined
in urging a delay.
