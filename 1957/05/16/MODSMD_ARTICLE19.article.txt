# Safety-Check That Car
## 
### 
TIU. NEFD FOR TRAFFIC SAFETY does not have to
he impressed on anyone. People are appalled
when at the end of each year tliev hear that
more people died that year due to automobile
accidents than ever before, and they wince
when they hear ihat the traffic death toll is
greater than the total casualties of many wars.
This year, for the first time on campus, Stan
ford students have an opportunity to have their
cars checked for highway safety. This week,
through tomorrow, Interfraternitv Council is
sponsoring a Traffic Safety Check lane on Palm
Drive near Museum Way. It is a campus ver
sion of the Traffic Safety Check program now
in progress in Palo Alto.
The check is free and it takes only about
two minutes. It involves a 10-point check of
headlights, directional signals, tail lights, brake
lights, brakes, steering, windshield wiper, horn,
exhaust system and tires. Among the cars al

ready checked tin- main fault lias been with
brake lights and lail lights.
All hough l lie program lias been offered on
campus since Monday, only about 200 cars had
been checked by yesterday afternoon.
I he program is not compulsory, but is de
signed as a service to the student. Its purpose
is to benefit the student and the other drivers
he meets on the road. There is no coercion
involved: no cars will be confiscated for miss
ing a point in tlie check. If a car is found to
be lacking in any respect, it is a warning to
the driver that he should correct the fault as
soon as possible.
There has been a singular lack of women
among those who have brought their cars to
the I raffic Safety Cheek lane. It may be said
with some certainty that the checkers are gen
tlemen. They are polite. They only want fo
help. Stanford women: be hold, lake your
cars in, too.
