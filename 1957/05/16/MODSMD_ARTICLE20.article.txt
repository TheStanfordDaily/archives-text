Editor, The Daily:
Apparently, in line wilh a desire to present a
united front to the world, the new Young Repub
lican Executive Board has notified the members
of the county delegation, by registered mail, of
a "hearing" at which the removal of the entire
delegation will be considered. In the past it has
not been the practice to remove all the counly
dolegates immediately after elections. There
may be some legitimate cause for such removal,
but it certainly cannot be true that all the dele
gates are of so little value to the organization
that they should be removed.
For at least one person who received such a
registered letter, it implied that his honesty was
being called in question, and that it was pre
â–  umed that he would deny that he had received
any noli Heal ion of I hp hearing unless he were to
sign for its receipt.
The "united front." group in the YR's claims
that disagreements should not bo made public.
'I here was a heated discussion on the subject at
an executive board meeting last quarter.
At the limp one of our members was maligned
and threatened with removal from thp county
delegation for "going to The Daily." I did not
agree with that policy thpn, and do not; agrpe
with it now. No political group ran really expect
thp public to believp that it is complpfely unified
on .ill issues. 1 sep no reason to attempt to kepp
such disagreements from the public, thus this
letter. Perhaps some action will bp takpn
against me for writing this, but 1 trust that it
will not bp in thp nature of thp purgp that ap

parently is contemplated, as T now hold no office
and speak only as a member of the group.

"While Men Only"
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University has always prided itself
oh its totally non discriminatory admissions and
laculty hiring procedures. In fact, this unim
peachable record was recently pointed to by the
Board of Trustees as being grounds for refusing
to insert a non-seeregation clause in Ihe con
tracts for the Stanford Hills housing develop
ment. And yet the 1 ruth of our non-discrimina
tory policy is called into question by a scholar
ship dpscribed in the If)f>T HS Information Bulle
tin as follows: The Dick Munroe Memorial
Scholarship (Irani In 1946 and subsequently Ihe
University recpived gifts for $15,000 . . . for Ihp
purpose of endowing a scholarship . . . Thp an
nual income is If) be used as a scholarship for
men of thp Caucasian race and awarded on Hip
basis of financial need and general qualifica
tions.
Having seen Stanford sharnpfully duck its re
sponsibility to the community in sptting an ex
ample in the realm of segregation in housing,
1 had, however', thought it irreproachable in its
activities "within Quad." I am sure the student
body would be interested in an explanation of
the acceptance <>| this scholarship on its "whilp
men only" basis.
