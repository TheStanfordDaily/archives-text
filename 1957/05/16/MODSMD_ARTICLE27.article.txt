"Until I joined General Electric's Research Labora-
tory in 1951, 1 never realized science could be such
a challenge —or so much fun. My job involves re-
search in physical chemistry — the investigation of
new ideas which can lead to new and belter products
people can use. In a company of this size, I have the
unique advantage of having the tools and facilities I
need and the experience of others close at hand. And
in return, of course, I'm expected to apply myself to
the best of my ability in each new job. As I see it,
