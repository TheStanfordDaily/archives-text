# Eight PCC Meet Records Endangered; Herrmann Threatens Broad Jump Mark
## 
### Dick Barnes 
At least eight Pacific Coast
Conference meet records will be
in jeopardy tomorrow and Satur
day when track and field men
from the PCC's nine schools
gather at Eugene to battle for
the conference championship.
Meet standards in every run
ning event except the hurdles,
440 and mile relay will be in dan
ger, with records in the broad
jump, pole vault and javelin also
likely to fall.
Sont herners Threaten
Most of the record-threatening
is expected to be done by athletes
from the four California schools,
although the Northern Division
may make a stronger showing
than usual.
One Stanford entrant—co-cap
tain Frank Herrmann will aim
for the 17-year-old broad jump
record of 25 feet. If was set by
former UCLA and Brooklyn
Dodger star Jackie .Robinson.
Herrmann has improved in prac
tically every meet, hitting a high
water mark of 253 in Saturday's
West ( 'oast Relays.

He'll bo seriously challenged
for both the meet title and record
by Oregon's Martin Pedigo, who
got off an unexpected jump of
: 25-2 ] /k in the Northern Division
I meet last weekend.
King Eyes Two
Leamon King, the Olympic
team sprinter from California,
has his eyes on two meet marks:
9.5 in the 100 and 21.0 in the
220. King ran 9.5 on a heavy
Fresno track Saturday, and did
20.9 against Stanford two weeks
I ago, so must be given a good
j chance to top the records if con
j ditions are good.
A n o t her California runner,
Don Bowden, is also given a good
crack a I two PCC standards. The
| current 880 record of 1:51.(> is
| nearly two seconds slower than
Bowden's s e a son I o pper of
; 1:49.7. USC's Sid Wing has also
| run under ihe meet mark by
four-lenths, but isn't given too
good a chance to beat Bowden.
An excellent field is assured
Cor whal should lie a record
i smashing miel run. Bowden, with

a relay leg of 4:01.6, has the top
seasonal mark of any of the en
trants, but is by no means a sure
winner.
Seaman—4:o4
UCLA's Bobby Seaman, with a
relay time of 4:04 and an official
4:05.0 to his credit, will be in the
thick of things.
The most likely winner may be
neither Bowden nor Seaman, but
Jim Bailey of Oregon. He hasn't
come near being extended this
year, but it well known for his
3:58.9 clocking of last spring.
Bailey is also the defending
champion and meet record-hold
er.
Moving up to the two-mile,
there seems little doubt that Max
Truex of USC will both win the
event and set a new meet record.
Truex has already broken the na
tional collegiate two-mile mark
this year and has smashed Amer
ican standards in the three miles
and 5000 meters. The present
PCC mark is 9:02.0, nearly eight
seconds above Truex* national
record.
Trojan Keeord-Keekers
Another pair of Trojans, Ron
Morris and Bob Voiles, seek new
records in the field events. Mor
ris, one of history's few 15-foot
pole - vaulters, will be battling
aaginst ihe present mark of
14-11, set 20 years ago. He's al
ready cleared 15-2 this year.
Voiles, national collegiale rec
ord-holder in the javelin, seems
to have the knack of getting off
one good throw in each meet. The
rest of his efforts are generally
mediocre, but there's always the
one come-"through toss which
wins Ihe event.
He will probably break into Ihe
record books by bettering Ihe
throw of 235-9% made by Leo
Long of Stanford in 1954. Voiles
has done 240-9 already this sea
son in establishing the collegiate
mark.
