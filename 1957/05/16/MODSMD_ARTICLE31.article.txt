NEW YORK, May 15 (UP)
Hus D'Amato, crusading manager
of heavyweight champion Floyd
Patterson, broke away officially
from the International Boxing
Club today and announced that
Emil Lence of Brooklyn will pro

mote Patterson's first litle de
fense.
Sturdy, gray - haired D'Amato
said the defense would be staged
in June or July "somewhere in
ihe New York area probably at
one of the ball parks."
Tie also announced that Jack
Hurley of Seattle would be the
promoter "to put on any defense
we may decide to make later in
the Northwest." He added that
ihe Hurley promotion would not
necessarily be the second defense.
The names of other "independ
ent" promoters at Los Angeles,
Chicago and other cities- approv
er! for staging Patterson defenses
will be announced later, Hie
pilot said.
D'Amato stressed that none of
those promoters can have any con
nection with Jim Norris' IPC,
which he blasted at length as be
ing "detrimental to boxing."
The first challenger will be "the
highest of the top 10 contenders
who is willing to fight Patterson
for Emil Lence and at the terms
he offers. Starting with top-rank
ed Tommy 'Hurricane' Jackson,
ihe contender who refuses 1o fight
Patterson for Lence will forfeit
his light to challenge."
