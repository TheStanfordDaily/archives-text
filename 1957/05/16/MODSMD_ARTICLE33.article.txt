# Oarsmen Prep For Saturday's Harbach Rate
## 
### 
Leu Lindsey's Stanford crew
gets its final preparation today
for Saturday's Harhaeh Cup Re
gatta with IJSC and UCLA at San
Pedro Harbor.
The Harbaeh Cup affair has
grown out of 10 years of rowing
competition among ihe three
schools. It was officially organ
ized last year and is now held an
nually.
Last y e a r Stanford scored a
clean sweep of the three races to
gain possession of the cup. On
Saturday the Indians will b«' out
to repeat and thus gain a second
leg on the trophy.
Scoring System
Scoring in the regatta is on a
point basis, with the varsity race
on an 8-7-6 scale for first, second
and third, and the junior varsity
and frosh races each scoring 6-."5-4.
All three races will be run over a
two-mile course.
Stanford has already met the
Trojans once this year, but has
yet to row against UCLA. In the
earlier meeting with USC the
Tribe came out on top by a length
and one-half on the Redwood City
Yacht Harbor course.
Indians Unbeaten
Since that time, the Indians
have defeated Oregon State and
California and go into the race
with an unblemished record.
UCLA is not expected to offer
much more than token resistance.
In their race against California
and Wisconsin last week on the
Oakland Estuary, the Bruins were
trounced by over 19 lengths. They
have also finished far back in sev
eral other races during the season.
Lindsay expects plenty of fight
from the Trojans. He said: "I
don't think USC has worked up
to their full potential yet this
year. I expect to see a 'surprise'
showing by their varsity and a
much closer race 1han the one
earlier this season."
