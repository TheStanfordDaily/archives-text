## 
### Jack Rannells 
Tom Haynie and his 16-man
j school of mermen head south-]

swimming championships at USC.
i The 1500-yard freestyle event
opens the three-day mnet today,
with trials and finals in the other
i 14 events following tomorrow and
j Saturday.
Southern California last to
trip the Indians in dual com
| petition (1950) and in the PCC
meet i 1949) expects its defend
ing champion, Ron Severa, to win
i today's event.
But the meet should go down
lo the final event before the team
championship is decided.
Indians Challenged
The Trojans, with their fine
I freestylers, and California, with
sprinter Ron Volrner and top men
in all individual events, present a
very real challenge to Stanford
supremacy.
Key to the Indians' retention of

the crown they have worn with
| the exception of one year- since j
{ 1942 is Ihe same team depth thai i
] extended their dual meet skein to!
27 straight this season.
Haynie had only two steady j
winners during the dual meet sea- ;
son Lowell Johnson in the free-j
style sprints and Torn Burton in 1
' the distance events.
However, Burton was bested by
I USC's strong distance men two
weeks ago, and Johnson suffered
bis first defeat of the season last
Saturday when Volmer stroked to
a new California record of 22.6 in
the 50-yard sprint.
... Johnson Favored
Johnson is the Indians' best bet
for a first place. He was with
held from the 100 last Saturday
to ensure the meet-deciding 400
relay victory and so did not face
Volmer his only competitor at
that distance.
Johnson's times have been su
perior all season in the longer
event.
Beyond this, Haynie concedes
that "we could go through the
whole meet without taking an
other first. We're going to have
to depend on those thirds, fourths
and fifths."
Scoring will l)e handled on a
7-5-4-3-2-1 basis for the individual
events and 14-10-8-6 in the relays.

Indians Challenged
The Trojans, with their fine
I freestylers, and California, with
sprinter Ron Volrner and top men
in all individual events, present a
very real challenge to Stanford
supremacy.
Key to the Indians' retention of

the crown they have worn with
| the exception of one year- since j
{ 1942 is Ihe same team depth thai i
] extended their dual meet skein to!
27 straight this season.
Haynie had only two steady j
winners during the dual meet sea- ;
son Lowell Johnson in the free-j
style sprints and Torn Burton in 1
' the distance events.
However, Burton was bested by
I USC's strong distance men two
weeks ago, and Johnson suffered
bis first defeat of the season last
Saturday when Volmer stroked to
a new California record of 22.6 in
the 50-yard sprint.
... Johnson Favored
Johnson is the Indians' best bet
for a first place. He was with
held from the 100 last Saturday
to ensure the meet-deciding 400
relay victory and so did not face
Volmer his only competitor at
that distance.
Johnson's times have been su
perior all season in the longer
event.
Beyond this, Haynie concedes
that "we could go through the
whole meet without taking an
other first. We're going to have
to depend on those thirds, fourths
and fifths."
Scoring will l)e handled on a
7-5-4-3-2-1 basis for the individual
events and 14-10-8-6 in the relays.
