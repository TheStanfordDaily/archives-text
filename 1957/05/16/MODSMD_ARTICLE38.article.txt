# Dick Williams Homers Out of Sunken Diamond
## 
### 
Dick Williams became one «>f
the very few freshman baseball
players in Stanford history to hit !
a home run over the Sunken Dia- j
mond walls when he blasted u |
four-baser over lite left-field fence I
while the frosh were whipping
Burlingarne High School yester
day, H-'i
W i 11 i a m s* tremendous poke
soared out uf the park at the 360-
foot mark, clearing the 15-fuot
liigh harrier by an additional 1(1
feet. Dean Prince and Bill Tie
dermann, who had singled, were
| both on base when Williams hit
his third-inning homer.
"Possibly 8 or 4"
Stanford sports publicity direc
tor Don Liebendorfer said that no
records are kept concerning frosh
"homers in the Sunken Diamond,
but that he was sure no more
than three or four other first-year
men had ever poked one out of
the park.
Varsity players have hit just 37
homers over the fences in the 36-
year history of the Sunken Dia
mond.
Early Rallies
Stanford won the game early
when it tallied twice in the first
and three times in the fourth, in
addition to the trio of third-inning
runs.
Prince went four-for-four, in
cluding a triple that drove in two
fourth-frame runs. Jim Burk
got a double and two singles in
three trips. Base-running gem of
the game was Tiedermann's steal
i of home in the first inning.
