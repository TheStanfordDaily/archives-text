# Eisenhower Predicts Trouble If Military Spending Slashed
## House Continues Preparation for $2½ Billion Cut in President's Record Peacetime Budget 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 15 (UP)—President Eisenhower warned
Congress today that it would plunge the nation into trouble if it
went through with a reported $2.5 billion cut in defense spending.
Striving anew to block any "trifling" with his military budget, he
challenged a House Appropriations Subcommittee to ask itself

whether such a cut would be
honest.
Eisenhower shrugged off at a
news conference a suggestion that
his record peacetime budget
meant he had "moved somewhat
to the left" politically since his
first election in 1952.
"Far from it,"he said. "If any
thing, I have grown more conserv
ative."
Eisenhower's new budget warn
ing came less than 24 hours after
he told a nation-wide radio-TV
audience that Congress would be
taking a "fearful gamble" if it cut
defense spending. He will go on
the air again next Tuesday to
rally support for his foreign aid
program.
Congress Goes Ahead
Despite his efforts, Congress
plunged ahead with its drive to
slash the Administration's $71.8
billion budget. Few if any mem
bers of the economy bloc showed
any sign of being influenced by
the President's appeal.
Such GOP chieftains as Senate
Republican leader William Know
land and Sen. Styles Bridges (R-
N.H.) joined Democratic leaders
in reaffirming their determination
to cut spending. Rallying to the
President's s up port were the
"modern Republicans" who have
backed him all along.
At his news conference the
President said he thought defense
spending could be cut some if the
armed forces ever were unified
the way they should be. Progress
was being made, he said, but real
unification would mean common
use of such installations as hospi
tals, doctors and depots and great
er cooperation in procurement and
distribution.
Knowland's Comment
Eisenhower was asked specifi
cally about Knowland's comment
that, while the President made an
able presentation on television
last night, he still thought the
budget could be slashed by $3
billion.
The Chief Kxecuitve held firm.
He said again he did not see how
if could be done unless "they are
calculating on abolishing some
one of the major programs or a
group of smaller programs in our
country."
lie again appealed for restora
tion of some $51 million slashed
from funds for the U.S. Informa
tion Agency by the Serrate. Hp
said it was a mistake because a
number of countries had asked
for U.S. help in combating Com
munist propaganda.
The tone of congressional re
action to the President's speech
and his news conference remarks
indicated he faced an uphill fight
to save his budget from sizable
reductions.
