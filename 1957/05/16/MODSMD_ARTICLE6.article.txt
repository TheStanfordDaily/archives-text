# House Votes To Stop Soil Bank Program
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 15 (UP)
â€”The House voted today to kill
the administration's billion-dollar
soil bank program after subsi
dies have been paid to farmers
on this year's crops.
The 192-to-187 roll call vote was
one of the most important victo
ries scored by the economy bloc
thus far in the current budget
cutting drive.
The House wrote the soil bank
restriction into a scaled-down $3,-
692,889,757 Agriculture Depart
ment money bill, which it then
approved by voice vote.
Passed Last Year
Congress approved the pro
gram only last year as a means
of curbing surplus farm produc
tion. It provides subsidies for
farmers who take surplus crops
out of production and use the
idle land for conservation pur
poses.
House Democratic farm lead
ers supported the move to cut off
the payments after this year.
They said it would serve as a
"temporary injunction" to give
the House Agriculture Commit
tee time to decide whether a bet
ter substitute could be drafted.
They were supported by econ
omy leaders in both parties.
Republican farm state Con
gressmen generally opposed the
amendment, asserting that it
would confuse farmers and drive
grain prices down 10 to 20 cents
immediately.
Tun Paris
On the roll call vote 154 Demo
' rats Mtid 38 Republicans voted
for the amendment. Opposed
weir 45 Democrats and 142 Re
publicans.
The soil bank is divided into
two parts. Under one section
the acreage reserve- farmers are
paid for not planting surplus
crops. The other section set up a
lone range conservation reserve
which pays farmers for convert
ing land to conservation pur
poses.
As approved by the House, the
bill forbids any acreage reserve
payments with respect to 1958
crops and cuts conservation re
serve payments to $250,000,000.
