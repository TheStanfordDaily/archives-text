## Legislature Rescinds Approval of Minutes On Cardinal Proposal 
### Wally Simpson Associate Editor 
By a 7-to-5 vote, ASSU Legisla-1
ture last night rescinded approval
of the minutes of Cardinals' i
March 5 meeting.
By its action Legislature dis- !
approved Cardinals' plan to have
only living group decorations for
Homecoming, instead of floats.
The decision was made after
strong protests were made to the
group by Eric Fricker, who was
representing the side of the eat
ing clubs.
By a 9-to-4 vote, Legislature
also defeated a resolution intro
duced by Don Shoup which would
have requested AWS Cabinet to
instruct women's living group
presidents to hold elections in
their living groups to determine
how many of the women were in
favor of compulsory house meet
ings.
By-law Changes
In other action last night, Leg
islature voted unanimously to ap
prove three ASSU by-law changes
which would make the governing
board of the Institute of Interna
tional Relations a five-man voting
policy board instead of the present
13-man voting executive board.
The new constitution of the
Stanford Flyers was also approv
ed. A first reading was held on
the new constitution for Cardinal
House, Florence Moore Hall. Ac
tion on this will be taken next
week.
By another unanimous vote,
Legislature approved the appro
priation of $275 from the ASSU
contingency fund for the publica
tion of an international alumni
magazine. Approval came follow
ing a report by IIR president
Herb Hymans that $200 had been
raised from other sources.
Broken Window
The sum of $232.26 was appro
priated by Legislature to pay for
a picture window at Bowman
Alumni House which had been ac
cidentally broken by a delegate
from Willamette University dur
ing the Model UN conference. The
student financial manager was in
structed to make efforts to get
the money reimbursed from next
year's MUN conference.
Legislature also approved the
report of the Liaison Committee.
It voted to establish a standing
Liaison Committee, whereby a
member of Legislature will sit in
on and observe the meetings of
each administrative board and
commission.
The meeting opened with the
hearing of a report by a repre
sentative of Slick Airways, who
outlined a plan for low-cost air
travel to Europe and other points
by group rates. Under the plan
presented, round - trip fare from
San Francisco to Paris would be
$400 per person.
