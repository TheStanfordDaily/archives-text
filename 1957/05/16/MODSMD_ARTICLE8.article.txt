# Sign-ups for Last Hostel of Quarter To Close Today
## 
### 
Sign-lips close today at 1 p.m.
for the last student hostel of this
quarter, which will concern "The
Stanford Attitudeâ€”lts Influence
on Academics and Extracurricu
lars."
The informal weekend discus
sions on this topic will be led by
professor Philip Rhinelander,
dean of Humanities and Sciences,
and professor Bernard Siegel of
the Department of Anthropology.
The rest of the weekend will be
spent on a trip to the beach and
other outdoor recreation.
Six other weekend hostels were
held this quarter. This year's pro
gram was crucial in determining
the continuation of University
support for it.
Next Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday the committee will hold
tryouts for membership next year.
Any student interested in this
program is invited to try out. No
experience is necessary. Special
invitations are extended to stu
dents who have been on one or
more hostels. Information blanks
are available in the ASSU office,
where an interview sheet is also
posted.
