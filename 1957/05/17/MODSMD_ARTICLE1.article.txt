and the perfecting of its title.
The amendment they sponsored
in the state legislature was a
life-saver to Stanford, according
to officials.
After Senator S t a n 112 or d's

the law students.
Crothers Memorial Hall, for
graduate engineering students,

honor of the judge's mother,
Margaret Jane Crothers. Mrs.
Crothers was a pioneer of San

At the time of the dedication
of Crothers Memorial, Dean F.
E. Terman, Stanford provost

Other gifts the alumnus made
to Stanford included a 6000-vol

and an extensive scholarship
program for law students.
He was one of the five trus

Stanford was the subject of
two pamphlets written by the
alumnus. One was titled "The

Outline of the Founding of Le
land Stanford Junior Universi

cational Ideals of Jane Lathrop
Stanford."
The judge's aid to Stanford
dates back almost to the begin

judge's assistance was expressed
in a letter to him just before
her death in 1905.
"I realize how deeply service
able you are now and will be in
the future to the University,"
she wrote. "You have it at heart;
it is part of your life; you know
its needs."
Her prediction was carried out
in the many activities of Judge
Crothers.
In 1946 the judge was honored
for his services to the Univer
sity by the Stanford Law Asso
ciation at their annual banquet

that year. Members of his class
of '95, prominent judges and
alumni were on hand to pay trib

commissioned Arthur Cahill,

students often showed in his
everyday actions. In 1954 he
was host to five students at

The judge's wife preceded him

dates back almost to the begin
n in g of the University. Mrs.
Stanford's appreciation for the
judge's assistance was expressed
in a letter to him just before
her death in 1905.
"I realize how deeply service
able you are now and will be in
the future to the University,"
she wrote. "You have it at heart;
it is part of your life; you know
its needs."
Her prediction was carried out
in the many activities of Judge
Crothers.
In 1946 the judge was honored
for his services to the Univer
sity by the Stanford Law Asso
ciation at their annual banquet

that year. Members of his class
of '95, prominent judges and
alumni were on hand to pay trib
ute to the leader.
An oil portrait of Judge Croth
ers was presented to Stanford in
1955. Friends of the alumnus
commissioned Arthur Cahill,
painter of many famous per
sons, to do the painting. It was
hung in the Moot Court Room
of the Stanford Law School.
Judge Crothers' sentimentali
ty toward Stanford and Stanford
students often showed in his
everyday actions. In 1954 he
was host to five students at
the Desert Inn in Palm Springs
after he noticed them bemoan
ing their lack of funds to stay
at the desert resort.
The judge's wife preceded him
in death in 1920. He is survived
by three nephews.
