# 86 to Spend Junior Year in France
## 
### 
Eighty-six students have been
admitted to the 1957-58 Junior
Year in France, a year's foreign
study program administered by
Sweet Briar College since 1948.
Representing Stanford in the
program is Sharon Jean Speer, a
junior from Leavenworth. Wash.
Miss Speer is a copy editor on
The Stanford Daily.
Almost half the group have so
lected French as the major field
of study. After six weeks of in
tensive language drill in the pro
vincial city of Tours, the stu
dents will move to Paris to enroll
in the winter term of the univer
sity there. In both cities they
will live with French families.
