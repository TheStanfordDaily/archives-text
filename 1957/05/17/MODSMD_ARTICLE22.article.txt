# A 						Cherished Memory
## 
### 
Stanford i.ost one of its most valued and loved
alumni yesterday when Judge George (1 rot hers
died at the age of 87.
Perhaps no other alumnus contributed so
much money, time and thought toward better
ing his alma mater. Columnist Herb Gaen of
the San Francisco Examiner tells a story that
is illustrative of the man.
In 1954 five Stanford men found themselves
sitting in Iront ol the Desert Inn in Palm
prings, their hopes of a spring vacation going
up in the air because they found out they had
hardly enough money lor one night's lodging.
I hen an old man walked up, said he noticed
they were Stanford men by their jackets, and
started reminiscing about his experiences with
Herbert Hoover and Mrs. Stanford. Before he
had left them, the old man Judge
had made the five men his guests at the Winter
Garden Hotel with all expenses paid.
Ci others spent practically his whole life
working for the betterment of Stanford and its
students. As early as 1905, Mrs. Stanford told
brothers, "I realize how deeply serviceable you
aie now and will be in the future to the Uni
versity —you have it at heart: it is part of your
hie; you know its needs."
She was referring, of course, to the tremen
dous service Lawyer Crothei had done toward

settling !lie Stanford estate and establishing the
founding grant on a firm legal basis.
Many hundreds of Stanford students have
lived in the two dormitories which he has
helped finance. There are now 40 practicing
attorneys who were put through Stanford on
scholarships made possible by gifts from the
judge.
brothers pioneered many things at Stanford.
Tie was a member of Stanford's first graduating
class in 1895. In honor of the outstanding work
he bar! done, he was the first alumnus to be
made a Trustee member, back in 1902. (Inn
tinned service to the University in the Alumni
Association and continued donations for the
betterment of the Library facilities and the
Law Library kept brothers a valued integral
part of Stanford.
The University was shocked to hear of the
passing of Judge (mothers' brother Thomas,
last January 20, as he too contributed much to
Stanford's betterment. Now the judge himself
is dead.
But memory of him will not easily fade.
Law and Engineering students who live in
(brothers and brothers Memorial dormitories
will not forget, and neither will those who re
ceive scholarship money from his estate.
Stanford President Wallace Sterling is right.
A grateful University will indeed "mourn his
passing as it cherishes his memory."
