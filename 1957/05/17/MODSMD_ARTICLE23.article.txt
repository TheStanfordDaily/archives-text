# A 						Voice Needed

### 
Early this quartfr Cardinals announced ;i
new revamping of 111«> traditional football ac
tivities. Homecoming ami Came weeks
were being combined ami the time-consuming
float parade was being eliminated, It w;is ;t
badly needed revamping.
Wednesday night Legislature rejected the
plan to eliminate the float parade and put up
house decorations instead. I lie opposition to
tlie revision was voiced by the eating clubs,
which claimed, first, that with house decora
tions the houses on the Mow would have an
Midair advantage.
I heir second claim was the most valid. They
claimed that the decision was made without
Miough prior consultation of both club and
liaternity officers. They rightfully argued that
Indents themselves should have a big voice
iu which way they should stick crepe paper
in holes.

I.egihlature suggested that Cardinals get to
ff, ether with both eating club and fraternity
officials and work out a solution which would
be acceptable to all.
11 is regrettable that this was not done before.
We believe that the Cardinals plan was needed
il the football activities were to lie successful.
Hevamping changed the (ion Home drive from
a mediocrity to a smashing success. We believe
the same thing can lie done with Homecoming
and Hig ( »ame.
Mut, now that representation is brought up,
we believe the participants themselves should
be consulted before a decision is made. We
urge that all house presidents consult their
house memberships at meetings Monday night
to find out which way the members wish to
udstf their time.
Ilien Cardinals would have a much firmer
base from which to make a wise decision.
