Stanford and six other Pacific
Coast ('onference schools will
fight for individual laurels while
USD and UCLA battle each other
for lhe team chamuionship as
the 27th annua) PCC Irack and
field championships begin this
afternoon <n Hayward Field in
Eugene, ()re.
Preliminaries will he staged to
day, with finals in all events
carded for lomorrow afternoon.
The Trojans and Bruins are con
ceded Uk 1 only good chances to
take the team title because of
th e i j' impressive performances
earlier this year and strong dual
meet records.
Stanford, California and Ore
gon will be the principal contend
ers in the scramble for third
place honors, but can move up if
either of the favoriles encounters
a string of reversals. Washing
ion, Oregon State, Washington
Stale and Idaho are not expected
to offer much team resistance,
but have several individual stars
who could greatly affect the final
team standings by their perform
ances.
13 Cards Enter
Payton Jordan has entered 13
Stanford men in the title meet,
and a good percentage of Ihem
are ranked as either favorites or
strong contenders in their events.
The busiest Indian entrant, and
probably the best bet for a vic
tory, is co-captain Frank Herr
mann. He'll be going in the broad
jump, running the 220 and lead
ing off for the Cards' mile relay
team. Herrmann may also tackle
ihe 100.
Herrmann currently ranks as
the PCC's leading leaper, and
also stands as the second-great
est jumper in Stanford history.
Ile lias already done 25-3 this
year, and is fast closing in on
Gay Bryan's Stanford school rec
ord of 25-4%. As a sophomore,
Herrmann won Ihe PCC title, but
a bad leg held him back to third
last season.
Herrmann Undefeated
Herrmann is unbeaten in the
broad jump this season, having
placed first in all of Stanford's
dual and triangular meets and in
last week's West Coast Relays in
Fresno. Martin Pedigo of Oregon
will probably give Herrmann
plenty of competition, but he has
n't been nearly as consistent as
ihe Stanford senior.
Chuck Cobb of the Tribe looms
as a narrow choice in both Ihe
high and low hurdles. Cobb's
only loss this year came againsl
UCLA, when he plowed into sev
eral high sticks and lost 1o Hie
Bruins' Ken Thompson. Cobb re
venged this loss at the Wesl
Coast .Relays when he finished
several yards ahead of Thomp
son in the finals.
IISC's Bob Lawson has Ihe best
stick limes in the PCC—I4.O and
23.1 but both were made under
the influence of a favorable wind.
When Ihe Trojans and Indians
met during the dual season, Cobb
easily whipped Lawson in bolh
races.
Peters Rated Second
The Indians' Fred Peters is Ihe
second choice of most experts in
what should be a close fight for
first in Ihe discus. Peters has
thrown the platter 172 8 this
year, and has fouled on a throw
upward of 177 feet. But USC's
Rink Babka, who has bettered
175 feet, ranks as the logical fa
vorile.
Peters almost defealed Babka
at Ihe West Coast Relays until he

| was edged on 1 lie Trojan's final
, I throw. Jack Egan of Troy and
'Don Vick of UCLA also appear
: to be definite threats for the dis
cus I itle.
Co-captain Phil Fehlen will be
I involved in what is probably the
I most unpredictable field event
! ihe high jump. Fehlen's G-BV2
tops a list of good PCC marks,
but he hasn't come close to mak
ing ihat height in two of ihe past
three meets.
Oregon State's Wayne Moss,
UCLA's duo of Walt Torrence
and Nick Dyer and California's
I Dick Dai ley all could win or tie
:in the high jump, along with
j Fehlen.
Javelin Battle
In Ihe javelin, Stanford for
j tunes will ride primarily with
Hank Roldan. Right now, he ap
| pears to be a strong bet to lake
second place. Roldan has thrown
227-4 VL> for the third-best mark in
\ the PCC. But number-two man
Rafer Johnson of UCLA has just
j one good throw over the 210-foot
! mark, and doesn't appear to have
j the consistency to get up for sec
j ond.
Bob Voiles, the national colle
! giate record-holder from USC, is
j definitely the man to beat, as his
| 246-9 throw will testify. Oregon's
Ed Bingham and Troy's Doug
Maijala, runner-up in the 1956
NCAA championships, also rate
consideration.
The 440 will find Stanford's
Don Chesarek up against a lot of
good men from the other schools.
Chesarek has run 47.7 this year,
but will have a rugged time get
ting any better than fourth
against UCLA's Russ Ellis, Terry
Tobacco of Washington and Art
Stewart of California.
Graves in Two-Mile
The lone Stanford representa
tive in the distances will be Mau
ry Graves. He's entered in both
the mile and two-mile, but will
probably only go in the eight
iapper. Graves was second last j
year, and beat USC's great Max
j Truex.
But this season, Truex appears
to be a sure winner, with Califor
nia's Bob House a strong bet to
take second. Graves, however,
has a fair chance to beat House,
hut will still have to watch out |
for USC's Mai Robertson and.
Idaho's Ray Hatton.
Jordan looks for the Indian re
; lay team of Herrmann, Joe Wool
let t, Bob Hyde and Chesarek to
have a good chance for victory.
It's the first time this quartet,
has run together, hut Jordan
says it may well be the strongest
combination the Tribe could of
fer.
Franchettl to Vault
Stanford has three other men
going in field events—Kent Han
sen in the broad jump, Kirk Nie
land in the javelin and the rapid
ly-improving Mike Franchetti in
j ihe pole vault. Hyde will also go
! in Ihe 440, with Len Bates slated
to run the low hurdles.
Possibly the two best battles
; on the track will be in the 880
land Ihe mile. Four-minute miler
i Jim Bailey of Oregon and Don
j Bowden of California may go in
both events, along with Bobby I
I Seaman of UCLA.
In ihe sprints, Leamon King
of Hie Bears looms as a solid
! choice, but may be pressed in the
100 by Oregon's Steve Anderson
and Jack Morris. The shot put
finds Vick of the Bruins a strong
favorite over Dick Bronson and
Ray Martin of USC. Troy's Ron
j Morris is picked to win his see-
I ond straight pole vault crown.
