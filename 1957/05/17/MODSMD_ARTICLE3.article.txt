# FINAL IIR SPEAKER
## Irish People Aim for Peaceful Unity, Religious Toleration, UN's Respect 
### 
"The most cherished and foremost aim of our foreign policy is to
unite the Republic of Ireland with the six counties which now form
Northern Ireland under British rule," said Kevin Rush, Irish Consul
at San Francisco, at the final lIR Consular Talk of the quarter yes
terday in Bowman Alumni House.
He said Ireland would try to achieve this by peaceful means and

without any Communist aid. The
government actively punishes
the members of the Irish Revolu
tionary Army who fry for unity
by force.
In his two • hour discussion
Rush said that all officers in po
litical and civil service positions
must be able to speak and write
Irish. It is taught in all schools,
he said, and virtually all people
under 40 can speak two lan
guages, though English is most
generally used.
The Consul quoted from the
Irish delegation's speeches in the
UN, to which Ireland was admit
ted last October, and said she
will not be .just a "me too na
♦ ion," but with all diffidence will
expresss her opinions in detail
and propose her own solutions
for world problems.
In a long question period Rush
stressed that Irish censorship is
directed against "smut and inde
cency," not political or religious
literature. A delicate problem,
he said, concerned birth control
pamphlets, hut since such prac
tices are considered abhorrent in
Ireland all such literature is sup
pressed.
Though the Irish Constitution
expressly stales Ireland is a
Christian and predominantly
Catholic nation, there is complete
religious toleration. The re-elec
tion of Robert Briscoe as the
first Jewish mayor of Dublin is
just a natural event in a country
which guarantees political liber
ty for all faiths.
