Chicago Tribune Survey.)

Stanford's reputation in Span
ish is due to its leadership in im
proving teaching methods and
its active faculty, according to
Professor Aurelio M. Espinosa,
Jr., of the Germanic - Romanic

Languages Department. Stan
ford's Spanish department was
highly rated in a recent Chicago
Tribune survey.
The first professor of Spanish
American literature in America
was a Stanford professor, Dr. Al
fred Coester.
The Spanish professors have
long maintained contact with
universities in Latin America
and Spain, with the result that
many Spanish-speaking lecturers
have come here to teach.
Scholarly works written by
Stanford professors have brought
much prestige to Stanford. The
Hispanic American Report has
subscribers all over the world,
and scholarly papers have been
published during the past year
by three professors of the depart
ment.
Faculty Awarded
Members of the Spanish fac
ulty have received awards in rec
ognition of their achievements.
Dr. Aurelio M. Espinosa, Sr., was
a corresponding member' of the
Royal S p a n is h Academy, a
| Knight Commander of the Order
of Isabel the Catholic, and re
ceived, ori his retirement, the
Grand Cross of the order of Al
fonso el Sabio, which is the high
est Spanish civil decoration.
The department is now taking
advantage of recent develop
ments in language study through
; the Language Laboratory and
the Language Listening Room in
! the Stanford Library. It is also
sponsoring a training program
for elementary teachers so that
more Spanish will bo taught in
elementary schools. The program
includes study at. Stanford fol
lowed by a trip to Guadalajara,
Mexico.
Kalian Department
Stanford's Italian program was
also rated highly by the Chicago
Tribune survey. Under Profes
: sor Roberto Sangiorgi the num
her of students taking Italian has
increased from a mere handful
: to 50 over a period of 10 years.
The program uses a personal
approach to the needs of each
studentâ€”there is no mass pro
duction of education. It is based
on the premise that teaching is
an art, not a science. Small
i classes promote a close teacher
i student relationship.
