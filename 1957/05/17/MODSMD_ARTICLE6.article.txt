# Spanish Play Will Be Given In 2 Tongues
## First Spanish-English Play in States Based On '48 Colombia Riots 
### 
Tonight and tomorrow night a
one-act comedy by Luis Enrique
Osorio will be given in both
Spanish and English in Cubber
ley Auditorium at 8:30.
This will be the first presenta
tion of a play in both Spanish and
English in the United States, ac
cording to Larry Pippin of the
Hispanic American Studies De
partment.
The play, which is called "The
Curfew" or "La Toque de Que
da," was first presented in Oso
rio's own theater in Bogota, Tea
tro de la Comedia. It is based
on riots which occurred in 1948
in Bogota, Colombia. Martial
law, along with a curfew, was
imposed on the Colombians to
keep order.
The riots coincided with an in
ter - American conference that
was instrumental in forming the
Organization of American States.
The United States delegation to
the conference had to be evacu
ated, since the rioting was dam
aging large parts of Bogota.
Osorio, a visiting professor at
Stanford this year, is one of his
country's best playwrights.
In the play are Valerie Hamil
ton, John Florida, Agustin Perez
Lizano, Barbara Gordon, Hilda
Baco, Joseph Shirley, Richard
Hancock, Larry Pippin, Eduardo
Maal and Ricardo Flo res.
