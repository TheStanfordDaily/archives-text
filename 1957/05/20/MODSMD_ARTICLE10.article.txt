# House, 'Public' Oppose Ike's Record Budget
## Ike to Send Message To Congress on Plan, Give Radio-TV Appeal 
### 
(C ompiled from United Press)
Opposition to aid to Yugoslavia
and the House Military Appropri
ations Subcommittee's desire for
defense budget cuts have put ob
stacles in the way of President
Eisenhower's appeal for his pro
posed budget as he continues this
week his appeals to Congress and
the nation to support him in his
proposals.
The administration says that
Eisenhower is expected to send
a special message to Congress
either today or tomorrow spell
ing out the details of his foreign
aid plan, and to follow up to
morrow with a nation-wide radio
television appeal, his second in
eight days, aimed at rallying
public support behind the record
peacetime budget in general and
the foreign aid program in par
ticular.
Aid to Yugoslavia
Senator John M. Butler (R-Md.)
said today that Eisenhower's de
cision to resume military aid to
Yugoslavia "will further imperil"
his embattled foreign aid pro
gram.
Butler said an "irresistible"
public demand for drastic budget
cuts had been spurred by last
week's decision to resume mili
tary aid to Yugoslavia.
He said the decision "patently
ignored the wishes of Congress
and the American people because
"they never contemplated mili
tary and economic aid to Com
munist - controlled countries be
hind the Iron Curtain as a prop
er means of protecting our secu
rity."
In a statement issued through
his office, Butler said that "nei
ther Congress nor the American
people approve of this unmoral
trafficking with the enemy."
Defense Spending
In other budget affairs, Chair
man George H. Mahon (D-Tex.)
of the House Military Appropri
ations Subcommittee called to
day for a $3 billion cut in Eisen
hower's $38 billion defense
spending program.
Mahon also proposed that the
government halt testing of the
big H-bombs "in so far as pos
sible" but that it continue to test
the smaller A-weapons.
He said his subcommittee
would recommend to the full Ap
propriations Committee Tuesday
a cut in Eisenhower's new mili
tary budget. He did not mention
the size of the reduction, but oth
er sources have placed it at $2.5
billion.
The $3 billion cut called for by
Mahon would apply to the money
spent by the administration in
the new fiscal year. The spend
ing would be made out of money
previously provided by Congress
and not spent, as well as from
the new appropriations. The ad
ministration already has on hand
a large backlog of money before
Congress acts on new appropria
tions requests.

eight days, aimed at rallying
public support behind the record
peacetime budget in general and
the foreign aid program in par
ticular.
Aid to Yugoslavia
Senator John M. Butler (R-Md.)
said today that Eisenhower's de
cision to resume military aid to
Yugoslavia "will further imperil"
his embattled foreign aid pro
gram.
Butler said an "irresistible"
public demand for drastic budget
cuts had been spurred by last
week's decision to resume mili
tary aid to Yugoslavia.
He said the decision "patently
ignored the wishes of Congress
and the American people because
"they never contemplated mili
tary and economic aid to Com
munist - controlled countries be
hind the Iron Curtain as a prop
er means of protecting our secu
rity."
In a statement issued through
his office, Butler said that "nei
ther Congress nor the American
people approve of this unmoral
trafficking with the enemy."
Defense Spending
In other budget affairs, Chair
man George H. Mahon (D-Tex.)
of the House Military Appropri
ations Subcommittee called to
day for a $3 billion cut in Eisen
hower's $38 billion defense
spending program.
Mahon also proposed that the
government halt testing of the
big H-bombs "in so far as pos
sible" but that it continue to test
the smaller A-weapons.
He said his subcommittee
would recommend to the full Ap
propriations Committee Tuesday
a cut in Eisenhower's new mili
tary budget. He did not mention
the size of the reduction, but oth
er sources have placed it at $2.5
billion.
The $3 billion cut called for by
Mahon would apply to the money
spent by the administration in
the new fiscal year. The spend
ing would be made out of money
previously provided by Congress
and not spent, as well as from
the new appropriations. The ad
ministration already has on hand
a large backlog of money before
Congress acts on new appropria
tions requests.

Opposition to aid to Yugoslavia
and the House Military Appropri
ations Subcommittee's desire for
defense budget cuts have put ob
stacles in the way of President
Eisenhower's appeal for his pro
posed budget as he continues this
week his appeals to Congress and
the nation to support him in his
proposals.
The administration says that
Eisenhower is expected to send
a special message to Congress
either today or tomorrow spell
ing out the details of his foreign
aid plan, and to follow up to
morrow with a nation-wide radio
television appeal, his second in
eight days, aimed at rallying
public support behind the record
peacetime budget in general and
the foreign aid program in par
