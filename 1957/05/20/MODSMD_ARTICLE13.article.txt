# Anderson Captivates Audience In Men's Glee Club Concert
## 34-Man Group Has Consistently Good Diction; Singers Seem to Enjoy Performance Intensely 
### Camille Petersen 
The blend of 34 voices assured the continued existence of the year
old Men's Glee Club yesterday afternoon in the hour-long concert in
Cubberley. Wayne Anderson, featured baritone soloist, captivated
the audience throughout the program.
From the opening selection, "Contradiction" by Schubert, to the

final notes of the Stanford
"Alma Mater" the group main
tained good diction and each in
dividual appeared to be enjoying
the performance immensely.
The outstanding features of
the choral work by the Glee Club
were its control of dynamics and
balance among sections. One of
the best examples of this ability
was in "Soon Ah Will Be Done"
by Dawson. The many moving
parts came through clearly
throughout the work.
Loves Singing
As Anderson swept into his
first solo. "Old Man River" by
Kern, the proverbial hush filled
the auditorium. In this as in his
other solos, "Stouthearted Men"
by Romberg and "You'll Never
Walk Alone" by Rodgers and
Hammerstein, and featured roles
in other works. Anderson, seemed
to love singing as much as the
audience enjoyed listening to
him.
A better opportunity for a
singer could scarcely be found,
for in the audience sat Douglas
Moore, composer of "The Ballad
of Baby Doe." and the star of the
opera, Leyna Gabriele of New
York.
The main body of the Glee
Club and the soloist worked to
gether iti several numbers, "The
Erie Canal," "Ride the Chariot"
and"The Halls of Ivy," as one
entity. The latter was done a
capped and with conviction.
Give Pianist Rest
Many of Ihe numbers gave
pianist Robert Martin a rest, but
only a few limes did it seem as
if the various sections were
sear c hi n g for their entering
pitch.
The bass section sounded like
the lower register notes emitted
by an organ, especially notice
able in Chesnokov's "Salvation
Belongeth to Our God." The
even, low, underlying rumble
added a special effect to the pres
entation of the work.
Portions sung in the extremely
high tenor register eame through
clearly and without the stringy
quality so easily obtained. Clark
McEuen, first tenor, gave a note
worthy performance in his fea
tured portions of "Ride the Char
iot."
All Smile
In "The Medley of College
Songs," songs of Navy, Cornell.
California and Stanford were
presented. The a cappella selec
tions wore united by humming
transitions. When the California
song was begun, both the audi
ence and the Glee Club burst into
smiles.
Anderson directed the two en
cores of the evening, "Animals"
and "Alma Mater," arranged by
Jon Elkus, a graduate student at
Stanford, for which the audience
rose.
Ivan Jtasmussen directed the
Glee Club and Robert Martin ac
companied.
