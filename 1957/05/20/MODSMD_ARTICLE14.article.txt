# Delay in Trial Of Rutherdale To Be Asked
## 
### 
The attorney who will defend
Donald Rutherdale, 19, has said
he will ask the court today for
delay of the trial, scheduled for
May 27.
Rutherdale is a San Carlos resi
dent who is charged with "assault
resulting in bodily harm" for his
participation in the April attack
on a Stanford beach party.
One of the witnesses, on hear
ing of the proposed delay of the
trial, said: "Sure they want to
postpone it. They want us to go
home." Any lengthy delay of the
trial might put it on the calendar
past the end of spring quarter.
Dennis Woodman of Palo Alto,
Rutherdale's attorney, told The
Daily that Rutherdale's case is
based on the argument that the
witnesses oou.ld not produce "suf
ficient evidence of bodily harm"
caused by Rutherdale, but were
charging to him some of the harm
done bv the two other defendants,
Louis Marks, 19, and Donald Haw
kins, 18.
Verl Dean Keiser, a Stanford
junior, was hospitalized for about
two weeks, with the possibility of
a brain concussion, as a result of
the attack.
Rutherdale, a butcher's appren
tice, last week charged he was
attacked, possibly in reprisal, by
"four husky Stanford students"
who later turned out to be one
small acquaintance of his who'
had tired of Rutherdale's brag
ging about the beach party at
tack.
