# Proposed Social Change Vote Due at House Meetings Tonight
## Women to Vote on Revamped Plan As Whole; Will Be Able to Comment 
### 
Women will vote tonight at house meetings whether or not to
adopt the proposed social regulations changes. A simple majority
will pass or defeat the new plan.
'I he voting is being carried out by Elections Commission. Results
will be tabulated late tonight, according to chairman Karen Peter-

sou.
The proposed system is a com
plete revamping of the present
one. Women will vote yes or no
regarding the program as a whole.
They will not be allowed to vote
on each section separately, but
space will be left on the ballot
for comments.
The new system would give jun
ior and senior women, unlimited
2:30 a.m. late leaves. Sophomores
would receive 45 2:30's each quar
ter. First-quarter freshman wom
en would have a quota of 20 l:30's
and five 2:30's. Second- and third
quarter frosh would get 25 l:30's
and 10 2:30's.
Four Extra
The proposed plan would also
allow freshman women four extra
late leaves to use during Thanks
giving vacation.
At present senior women get
unlimited l:30's and 20 2:30's;
juniors, 40 l:30's and 15 2:30's;
sophomores, 30 l:30's and 10
2:30's; second- and thii'd-quarter
freshmen, 24 l:30's and six 2:30's,
and first - quarter freshmen, 20
l:30's and five 2:30's.
The 15-minute bonus, which a
woman is given each quarter for
emergencies, will be discontinued
if the revised system goes into
effect.
If the changes are adopted,
there will not be an honor pledge
line added to the sign-out slips,
as was first proposed. This idea
met with much opposition during
informal discussions in house
meetings. An optional blank to
put down the time of expected
return would appear on the slip.
Overnight Slips
Overnight sign-out slips at pres
ent have 1:30, 2:30 and before
closing-hour boxes, one of which
must be signed. The revision
would omit these and make an
automatic 2:30 for the night the
woman returned.
The change would allow a wom
an a total of nine demerits before
she appeared before the Women's
Council to discuss her case. At
12 demerits council would have
power to have the woman sus
pended from the University.
One demerit would be given
for: a late return of 30 minutes;
an accumulation of five lockouts
(coming in after the designated
time) which totaled 30 minutes or
less; late leaves in excess of the
woman's quota; having a male
guest in the residence after clos
ing hours; a guest violation of
any of these.
One-half demerit would be given
for: failure to sign in; a guest
violation of this.
Presenft Demerits
A woman at present is allowed
four demerits before going be
fore Women's Council and five
demerits before being suspended.
The present system apportions
offenses (worth one-third of a
demerit) and technicals (worth
one-eighth) for violations.
To appeal a guest violation, the
proposed plan states that the
guest must write an explanation
of the circumstances on the back
of the guest's late-leave slip. The
hostess must register her guest
in accordance with her residence
regulations.
If a man is discovered in a
women's residence after closing
hours, and his presence is not
known to any of the women, no
penalty would be given under the
proposed new set-up. It would be
the responsibility of any woman
in the house to ask him to leave.
The remainder of the new pro
gram to be voted on consists of
portions of the old system incor
porated into it.
