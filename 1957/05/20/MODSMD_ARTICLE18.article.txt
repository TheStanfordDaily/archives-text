# Labor Council To Hit Beck As 'Liability'
## AFL-CIO, Union May Both Seek Removal Of Teamster Leader 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 19 (UP)
â€”The AFL-CIO Executive Coun
cil was expected to swing another
blow at Teamster president Dave
Beck this week by declaring him
a liability to the labor movement.
The council was almost certain
to find Beck guilty of bringing
labor into "disrepute" after he
appears at an unprecedented un
ion trial tomorrow.
If so, the council would con
tinue Beck's suspension as an
AFL-CIO vice-president and coun
cil member and recommend his
permanent removal at the AFL
CIO convention in December.
Could Be Academic
By December the matter could
be academic. Beck's position as
the Teamster leader undoubtedly
will be challenged at the union's
own convention in September.
There was some doubt that
Beck would offer any defense at
his closed-door trial before thr
AFL-CIO council tomorrow. He
said last week he would do so
only if his statements could not
be subpoenaed.
By this he presumably meant
he would not want his remarks
to fall into the hands of the Sen
ate rackets committee or the gov
ernment attorneys who will press
the tax evasion charges against
him.
Beck's attorney, Edward Ben
nett Williams, criticized today the
committee's action in calling the
Teamster president for question
ing while the tax indictment is
pending against him.
"Open Hearing"
In an appearance on the ABC
TV program "Open Hearing," Wil
liams reviewed the argument he
presented to the committee when
Beck was called as a witness last
week.
He contended that congression
al committees have no right to
make a "public demonstration"
by questioning a witness about
"facts already within their knowl
edge."
AFL-CIO and Teamster union
sources said they would be sur
prised if Beck answered the
charges of "malfeasance or mal
administration" brought against
him by the council.
