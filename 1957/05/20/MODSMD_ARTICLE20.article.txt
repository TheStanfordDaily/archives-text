# Keep Enrollment Down
## 
### 
I MVIRSITY PRESIDENT Wallace Sterling posed
;ni important problem before Stanford alumni
hi his address Saturday—the population pres
sure upon colleges, both private and public, to
increase their enrollment.
Al present there are about three million
enrolled in colleges. Sterling expects the num
ber to double in llie next 20 years. Still there
are no immediate plans for an enrollment in
crease al Stanford. We hope"Stanford holds
fast in its decision to withstand the population
and alumni pressures and keep the enrollment
near the 8000 mark for several years.
Stanford is just now beginning to catch up
with its enrollment in terms of dormitory fa
cilities, classroom facilities and campus build
ings.
Much more is needed before present facili
ties and conditions can even be termed ade
quate. Additions are about to he made to
Stern Hall, another women's dormitory is des
perately needed and a bold new fraternity
house building program has been announced.

Sterling said licit the enrollment standards
have been kept so tough that those admitted
in 1951 would never he admitted to the Uni
versity now because of academic deficiency.
Such au academic emphasis, if anything,
should he stepped up. Before any further
money is spent on increasing the enrollment
or improving existing physical facilities, more
should he done toward Improving the academic
facilities that is, faculty salaries and more
scholarships. I lie I niversity has lost too many
professors of top-notch quality because of high
er salary oilers in other leading institutions.
\\ itli the population increases Stanford has
even more of a chance to he selective and pick
the quality of students it should have. It great
ly trails other leading schools in students on
scholarships.
Only when Stanford has the hest living,
classroom and academic conditions for its 8000,
and has assumed the position of one of the
leading universities in the country because of
it, should il open its doors to ;i greater number
of students.
