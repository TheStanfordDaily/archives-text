# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Dick Frey
## Scholarly Pursuits Hold Top Priority 
### 
From the looks of the activity calendar, anoth
er scholarly week of colloquia, seminaria and
ennui, slightly spiked with spring fever and the
old steadying influence of just plain booze, is on
tap.
Blasting off the week is an exciting little ol'
Department of Biological Sciences seminar this
afternoon at 4:15. . . . Dr. Ernest Baldwin, Brit
ish biochemist, will discuss "Some Comparative
Aspects of Nitrogen Metabolism" in Room 430.
Preceded by N.,-aeriated tea at 4. Quite the gas,
that N.,.
With a clatter of telescopes and other equip
ment, the Stanford Astronomy Club will get to
gether tonight at 8:30 in Room 380 to ponder
"Solar Observing, and the Transit of Mercury."
Telescope observing will follow, weather permit
ting. (Today's hint for Roble women: All shades
down by 9 p.m. at the latest.)

The good old Tuesday Evening Series has a
music talk scheduled as Dr. Douglas S. Moore of
Columbia will discuss "Problems of American
Opera." It's at Mem Aud; time, 7:30.

With a bloodcurdling scream the Old Boy will
lead his stalwarts from the Chappie shack to
supervise distribution of the latest issue at the
crack of dawn Wednesday morn (i.e., about
noon). This month's gem of humor is the ex
change number.
The Wednesday Matinee features "No Exit,"
a play by Jean-Paul Sartre at 4:15 in the Mem
Aud Little Theatre. See what happens when
Ihe panic-stricken hero discovers molasses on all
the doorknobs!
The 1958 model hot water bottle will go on dis
play Wednesday at the Seminar in Chem Engi
neering and Applied Chem when Dr. A. L. Lon
don discusses "Modern Developments in Com
pact Heat Exchanger Surfaces." The tingling
event will be in Room c2O at 4:15.

The big big big BIG show Thursday is Dr.
Solomon Feferman's lecture on "Recursive Ordi
nals and a Problem in Logic." The talk is spon
sored by the Mathematics Colloquium and will
be in Room 104, Sequoia, at 2:15. Always have
wanted to curse ordinals logically.
The Film Series has done it again! "Fort
Apache," a 1948 gasser, will crash forth upon
the audience in a hail of arrows and hot lead at
7:30 in Cubberley. Free first aid after the mess
is over.

A special Mathematics Colloquium will be held
Friday at 10 a.m. for everyone who isn't still
shell shocked from Thursday's episode. No one
is expected to survive Friday's. It's titled "On a
Generalized Dirichlet Problem for Plurisubhar
monic Functions and Pseudo-Convex Domains."
Yeah. Dr. H. J. Bremermann from U. of Wash
ington will deliver the topic in Room 76.
At 7 p.m. one of Stanford's traditional spring
quarter events gets under way-it's the Spring
Sing, over at Frost Amphitheater.
The new Music Center will be the site for the
first performance of the opera, "The Ballad of
Baby Doe," at 8:15. A second performance will
be given Saturday, same time and place.

et Mercury." The talk will be sponsored by the
Stanford Flying Saucer Trackers and "Better
Gnomes and Martians" magazine. Transporta

Bob Hope and Eva Marie Saint are the head
