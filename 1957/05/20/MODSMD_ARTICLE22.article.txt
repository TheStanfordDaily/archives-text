Victorian Attitude
Editor, The Daily:
We are, today, parties to one of the most strik
ing arguments in the theory of the inferior sta
tus and potential of women. One look at the
system of minute regulation, discrimination and
inequality which governs Stanford women, and
a further look at the tolerance and willing aid
of the administration toward this system, is
enough to convince anyone that women (at Stan
ford at least) are inferior to men. They are
Ireated, and treat themselves, as cretinous chil
dren, unfit for individual responsibility and ma
ture consideration.
Examining the system of petty restriction, we
are forced to conclude that at Stanford no nor
mal criteria for assuming the maturity of a
woman are employed. A woman of twenty-one
has less freedom in her choice of residence,
hours, self-employment and activities than a man
of seventeen. A woman old enough to vote in
any election is too young at Stanford to decide
what issues are of interest to her and merit her
attention and consideration. Instead, she is
lorced to attend a meeting every week at which
everything—dull, silly, vital, boring, thrilling—
is crammed down her throat and forceably in
gested like castor oil given to a recalcitrant two
year-old.
The Victorian (ossified) attitude of the ad
ministration toward this semi-benevolent tyran
ny is understandable. After all, the Faculty Club
does not admit women members.
But what is most discouraging, and what leads
us to believe that the great majority of the wom
en at Stanford are incompetent irresponsibles,
is the fact that the merits of the system as a
whole must be questioned by two men. One
hears much about changing this petty regula
tion for some other, equally petty, restriction.
But one rarely, if ever, hears in public a dissent
lo the fantastic totality. Could it be that Stan
ford women have never heard of the social
lights which all women supposedly enjoy?
Could it be that they merely leave a repressive
mother at home for a more repressive mother
in the Stanford women's social regulations and
housing restrictions?
It has been said that women like to talk about
something, but that they never do anything

about it. This must be true. Time and time
again one hears in private the wails and com
plaints, the anguish and condemnation. But
nothing ever happens, nothing which vitally af
fects the basic assumptions and actions of a
time-tried and discarded theory of basic inequal
ity. When a man dares to ask a question or
express an opinion, he is pounced upon and
thrashed, and told that this is women's business.
It is well known that any restriction upon the
women is automatically a restriction upon the
men. If the women will not protest, we will.
Only action or inaction will decide the ques
tion of the inferiority of Stanford women. If
they do nothing (and talk much), it will be ob
vious that they are irresponsible, immature,
childish and uneducated. Perhaps it is time that
Stanford women realized that they are pulling
the wool over their own eyes if they think that
maturity and independence and responsibility
can be gained by hiding behind a protective sys
tem of regulation and discrimination.

To the Housing Committee:
This is not what we voted for! The "All Soph
omore Dorm Bill" was presented in a misleading
manner. It was intimated that if Lagunita were
made an all-sophomore dorm we would be de
priving a few juniors and seniors, whose first
preference might be Lagunita, of getting into
Lagunita.
We were given no statistics and certainly did
not realize that freshmen who drew numbers in
the three hundred would be put on the row while
51 unhappy juniors would return to Lagunita.
It was apparent by the fresnman vote that they
were in favor of living in Lagunita their sopho
more year.
The Housing Committee has taken a haphaz
ard vote and manipulated us into an awkward
ratio about 300 sophomores to 51 juniors. Is
the ratio worth the unhappiness it has caused
for a handful of girls placed in Lagunita wherf
the said ratio does not work?

This is not what we voted for! The "All Soph
omore Dorm Bill" was presented in a misleading
manner. It was intimated that if Lagunita were
made an all-sophomore dorm we would be de
priving a few juniors and seniors, whose first
preference might be Lagunita, of getting into
Lagunita.
We were given no statistics and certainly did
not realize that freshmen who drew numbers in
the three hundred would be put on the row while
51 unhappy juniors would return to Lagunita.
It was apparent by the fresnman vote that they
were in favor of living in Lagunita their sopho
more year.
The Housing Committee has taken a haphaz
ard vote and manipulated us into an awkward
ratio about 300 sophomores to 51 juniors. Is
the ratio worth the unhappiness it has caused
for a handful of girls placed in Lagunita wherf
the said ratio does not work?

We are, today, parties to one of the most strik
ing arguments in the theory of the inferior sta
tus and potential of women. One look at the
system of minute regulation, discrimination and
inequality which governs Stanford women, and
a further look at the tolerance and willing aid
of the administration toward this system, is
enough to convince anyone that women (at Stan
ford at least) are inferior to men. They are
Ireated, and treat themselves, as cretinous chil
dren, unfit for individual responsibility and ma
ture consideration.
Examining the system of petty restriction, we
are forced to conclude that at Stanford no nor
mal criteria for assuming the maturity of a
woman are employed. A woman of twenty-one
has less freedom in her choice of residence,
hours, self-employment and activities than a man
of seventeen. A woman old enough to vote in
any election is too young at Stanford to decide
what issues are of interest to her and merit her
attention and consideration. Instead, she is
lorced to attend a meeting every week at which
everything—dull, silly, vital, boring, thrilling—
is crammed down her throat and forceably in
gested like castor oil given to a recalcitrant two
year-old.
The Victorian (ossified) attitude of the ad
ministration toward this semi-benevolent tyran
ny is understandable. After all, the Faculty Club
does not admit women members.
But what is most discouraging, and what leads
us to believe that the great majority of the wom
en at Stanford are incompetent irresponsibles,
is the fact that the merits of the system as a
whole must be questioned by two men. One
hears much about changing this petty regula
tion for some other, equally petty, restriction.
But one rarely, if ever, hears in public a dissent
lo the fantastic totality. Could it be that Stan
ford women have never heard of the social
lights which all women supposedly enjoy?
Could it be that they merely leave a repressive
mother at home for a more repressive mother
in the Stanford women's social regulations and
housing restrictions?
It has been said that women like to talk about
something, but that they never do anything

about it. This must be true. Time and time
again one hears in private the wails and com
plaints, the anguish and condemnation. But
nothing ever happens, nothing which vitally af
fects the basic assumptions and actions of a
time-tried and discarded theory of basic inequal
ity. When a man dares to ask a question or
express an opinion, he is pounced upon and
thrashed, and told that this is women's business.
It is well known that any restriction upon the
women is automatically a restriction upon the
men. If the women will not protest, we will.
Only action or inaction will decide the ques
tion of the inferiority of Stanford women. If
they do nothing (and talk much), it will be ob
vious that they are irresponsible, immature,
childish and uneducated. Perhaps it is time that
Stanford women realized that they are pulling
the wool over their own eyes if they think that
maturity and independence and responsibility

mother at home for a more repressive mother
in the Stanford women's social regulations and
housing restrictions?
It has been said that women like to talk about
something, but that they never do anything

about it. This must be true. Time and time
again one hears in private the wails and com
plaints, the anguish and condemnation. But
nothing ever happens, nothing which vitally af
fects the basic assumptions and actions of a
time-tried and discarded theory of basic inequal
ity. When a man dares to ask a question or
express an opinion, he is pounced upon and
thrashed, and told that this is women's business.
It is well known that any restriction upon the
women is automatically a restriction upon the
men. If the women will not protest, we will.
Only action or inaction will decide the ques
tion of the inferiority of Stanford women. If
they do nothing (and talk much), it will be ob
vious that they are irresponsible, immature,
childish and uneducated. Perhaps it is time that
Stanford women realized that they are pulling
the wool over their own eyes if they think that
maturity and independence and responsibility
can be gained by hiding behind a protective sys
tem of regulation and discrimination.

Misleading Manner
To the Housing Committee:
This is not what we voted for! The "All Soph
omore Dorm Bill" was presented in a misleading
manner. It was intimated that if Lagunita were
made an all-sophomore dorm we would be de
priving a few juniors and seniors, whose first
preference might be Lagunita, of getting into
Lagunita.
We were given no statistics and certainly did
not realize that freshmen who drew numbers in
the three hundred would be put on the row while
51 unhappy juniors would return to Lagunita.
It was apparent by the fresnman vote that they
were in favor of living in Lagunita their sopho
more year.
The Housing Committee has taken a haphaz
ard vote and manipulated us into an awkward
ratio about 300 sophomores to 51 juniors. Is
the ratio worth the unhappiness it has caused
for a handful of girls placed in Lagunita wherf
the said ratio does not work?
