# NO CHARGE FOR STATIC
## Germans Pay Rent to Use TV, Radio, Says Hoover Visitor 
### Barbara Bachman 
Five marks a month or no TV. Two marks a month or no radio.
This is the price for anything but static on a German radio or
television set.
A German radio station executive, Dr. Julia Dingwort-Nusseck,
visited the campus Friday and explained Germany's communication
system. ______________________

"Our networks and stations are
similar to those of Great Britain,"
she said. "They are a cooperative
corporation, midway between pri
vate and government ownership,
but are independent, self-govern
ing institutions.
"Our communication channels
are financed solely by customer
subscription fees, and wo there
fore need no advertising. Quite
enough money is obtained from
our station's two million paying
customers."
Monopolistic
Germany's nine radio stations
are strictly monopolistic, with
each network catering to ils par
ticular area. Each station has its
own television affiliate also.
Mrs. Dingwort - Nusseck is in
charge of the economic broadcasts
ol her Hamburg radio station.
"Most people don't understand
economic affairs," she said, "so I
try to give simple commentaries
and interpretations of current ac
tivities so they can understand.
"I present and explain stock ex
change and agriculture news in a
direct relationship to t veryday af
fairs. This way housewives know
why their budget doesn't last till
the end of the month, and hus
bands can keep up with the stock
market."
TV Growing
Television is growing very fast
now, she said. "But we have only
one channel. All nine TV stations
cooperate in sharing this one
channel, which broadcasts only
during the early evening hours."
Women radio announcers are
just as rare in Germany as in the
United States, she said. But her
job is especially successful he
cause the "shock ol hearing a
female voice concerning men's
business immediately arouses in
terest."
Mrs. Dingwort-Nusseck is pres
ently interested in the recent eco

nomic developments of the United
States. She visited this country
in 1950 and is now charting the
economic progress of the last
seven years.
U.S. Important
The United States is the most
important economic factor in our
country," she said. "If you get a
recession, we will get one less
than a month later."
She is also interested in tech
niques of economic forecasting
and predicting.
The U.S. Department of State
is sponsoring Mrs. Dingwort-Nus
seck's research trip, and her Stan
lord visit was organized through
Hoover Institute and Library.
