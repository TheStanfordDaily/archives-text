# SU Weekend Wins on Water, But Not on Land
## Stirring Saturday Showing Slides Swim Squad into Eighth Straight PCC Crown 
### 
Held win less for two days and j
10 events, Stanford's swimming
team pulled out its eighth con
secutive PCC title Saturday at
use.
Final team scoring in the an
nual meet: Stanford 118, Califor
nia 111VL>, USC 88, UCLA 66 V 2 .
The Tribe was supposed to
score heaviest Friday, but at the
end of that day California, with
its best team since World War 11,
was running ahead, 64-63. The
Cards won nary a first place in
Friday's events.
Before Saturday's races Stan
ford coach Tom Hayne gave his
mermen a stirring pep talk, and
the swimmers rallied behind wins
by Lowell Johnson, Ron Grunt
and Tom Burton and behind an
outstanding team depth to scuttle
the Bears.
Breaks Draught
Johnson, the only Indian con
ceded a favorite's role in pro-meet
prognostication, broke the victory
draught with a 51.1 century tree
style victory.
The wins by Grunt and Burton
were definitely in the realm of
upsets, however, and were the!
kind of the deep
but not brilliant Indians needed
for victory.
Grunt gutted out a sparkling
59.8 triumph over previously un
defeated Terry Tognazzini of Cal
in the 100-yard backstroke. Bur
ton also turned in the best time!
of his life in avenging a previous j
defeat by Ron Severa of USC in
grinding out a notable <1:45 win
in Ihe 440 freestyle.
These three Johnson, Burton I
and Grunt were unmistakably j
the stars since they came through I
with their best times when most !
needed.
Unsung Heroes
But the unsung heroes of the
affair were numerous. Mike Ma
honey, expected by optimistic
Card rooters to get at best a fifth

in the 440-yard freestyle, camel
through with the best time of his!
life to place third. He also took
third in the 200-yard individual
medley.
Hank Fourcade's fourth in the
220-yard freestyle, Denny Stim-I
son's fourth in the 50-yard free
style and Bill Hynes' third in the;
200-yard breaststroke were all un- j
expected.
Other important point winners :
included Winston Black, Fred-Mil
ler and Harry Collins in the but
terfly events, Wayne Mehl in the
backstroke events and the indi-;
vidual medley, Bob Kahn in the !
diving and Phil King in the .back
stroke.
Stage Set
Going into the final event—the
medley relay—the Indians led by
9 1 '2 points and had to place only
fourth to win the meet.
A cautious Stanford quartet ofl
Grunt, Hynes, Black and Fourcade
led most of Ihe way, but finally
succumbed to Cal as Ron Vol
mer's scorching 55-second butter
fly lap was too hot to handle.
The Indians placed three men
in two different events- -the 200-I
yard butterfly and the 100-yard!
backstroke and .were the only!
team not shut out in any race. I
ii was the final collegiate swim-1
rning race for seniors Grunt, Bur
ton, Hynes, Miller and King.
