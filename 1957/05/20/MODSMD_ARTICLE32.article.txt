# Stanford Nine Loses to FSC On Freak Play
## Baseballers Lead, 5-2, With Two Out in 9th, Fall to Bulldogs, 6-5 
### Dave Canfield 
Coach Dutch Fehring's base
ball team, which was almost-but
not-quite the PCC's Southern Di
vision representative in the NC
AA playoffs, took it on the chin
from Lady Luck again Friday.
Tn the last of the ninth inning,
the Stanford baseballers led host
Fresno State 5-2 with two out,
the bases loaded and a 2-2 count
on Bulldog right fielder Frank
Lester. Final score: 6-5, Fresno.
Here's how it happened:
• Lester's foul tip was drop
ped by Indian catcher Art Von
Wronski.
• The batter started a swing
but checked it in time and the
count became 3-2.
• Lester cracked the next
pitch into right field for a single.
Card right fielder Mike Linde
man hobbled the ball momenta
rily and threw to the plate.
• Von Wronski. having the
Fresno runner blocked off at Ihe
plate, chose to let pitcher Dick
Jones, who was backing up the
plate, field the throw.
• Jones probably could have
tossed to Von Wronski for an
easy out at the plate. Instead he
iried for a put-out at second and
threw the ball all the way to the
centerfieid wall.
• This was the only Card er
ror of the game, but by Ihe time
the ball was retrieved all four
Fresno runners had scored (in
cluding Lester, who originally
hit Ihe single—remember!).
Walt Payne started for the In
dians and hurled 5 1 :s innings be
fore being relieved by George
Avery. Jones came in Av
ery had loaded the bases in the
ninth.
Lester was the only man to
whom Jones pitched.
Stanford scored its five-run to
tal in the first four innings be
fore Fresno could cross Ihe plate
once.
In the first inning centerfield
er Bob Fletcher singled and
scored on a sacrifice by second
baseman Al Shaw, an error on
which third baseman Rudy Fi
gueroa reached first and a sacri
fice fly by left fielder Parker O)
son.
Saturday's game was rained
out. The Indians' season is now
over and their record stands at
17 wins and 13 losses.
