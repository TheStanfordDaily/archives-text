# HARBACH CUP
## Rowers Top UCLA, USC, 18 to 17 to 16 
### 
After taking a slim lead at the
one-mile mark, Stanford's varsity
crew bested USC by three lengths
Saturday in San Pedro over a two
mile course. UCLA was a distant
third.
The varsity win enabled the In
dian rowers barely to capture the
Harbach Cup regatta, with 18
points to USC's 17 and UCLA's 16.
The time for the varsity race
was 12:04. UCLA won the junior
varsity race in 11:31, with Stan
ford second and USC third. The
Trojans copped the freshman con
test, covering the distance in 12:-
22.2.
The Papoose shell took second,
willi the Brubabes third.
Actually UCLA's freshman boat
little more than "walked" across
the finish line after having been
swamped by a spectator's errant
boat.
The Harbach Cup regatta's scor
ing syslem gives 8, 7. 6 points re
spectively for first, second and
third places in the varsity race.
The JV and frosh "rows" score
6. 5, 4 points for first, second and
third.

face powerful University of Wash
ington.
