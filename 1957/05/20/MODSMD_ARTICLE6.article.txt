## SU Intends To Restrict Enrollments 
### 
President Wallace Sterling told
the 25th annual Stanford Confer
ence here Saturday it is going to
become increasingly difficult to
enroll in private colleges.
"Stanford intends in the fore
seeable future to hold undergrad
uate enrollment at the present
level, and most private universi
ties have similar plans," he said.
Noting the size of the problem
of gaining admission to private
colleges, Slerling said about three
million students are enrolled at
some collegiate level today.
"Number May Double"
"Twenty years hence, the num
ber may be doubled," Sterling pre
dicted.
Competition for admission to
private institutions, Sterling con
tinued, "is. not only in numbers
but in quality. Our studies show
that the bottom half of the fresh
man class admitted to Stanford in
1951 would have been rejected in
1956."
Sterling, who addressed more
than 1000 alumni and guests at a
luncheon in the Pavilion, said that
five or six years ago students
were divided between private and
public colleges.
"Trend May Intensify"
"Since then," he added, "a sig
nificantly greater number have
enrolled in public institutions. I
believe this trend will intensify
rapidly."
Noting that this trend does not
mean the eclipsing of privately
supported education, the presi
dent said, "Students and their par
ents will continue in large num
bers to prefer the school of rela
tively smaller enrollment, provid
ed it affords superior education."
Among other speakers at the
conference were geology profes
sor Arthur D. Howard, speech and
drama professor Stanley Donner,
School of Engineering dean Fred
erick E. Terman and psychology
and education professor Robert
R. Sears.
