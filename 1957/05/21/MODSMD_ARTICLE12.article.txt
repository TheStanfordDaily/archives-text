Difficulties Involved
In telling of the difficulties in
volved in writing opera, Moore
said that strong emotional feel
ing is necessary in all the music,
which is a challenge to the com
poser. Also there must be as
much action as possible to com
pensate for the fact that many
words cannot be understood by
the audience. Another difficulty,
Moore said, is that it is hard to
retain intelligibility while ex
pressing intensity with high
pitches.
Moore fold the story of the
opera which began in Leadville,
Colo., about 100 years ago. Hor
ace Tabor, an easy-going man,
and his cautious, foresighted
wife Augusta came to the small
mining town and before many
years Tabor had made his for
tune in silver. Soon afterward a
beautiful but spoiled girl, Eliza
beth Doe, and her husband, Har
vey, moved to Leadville. Augusta
by this time had rejected Tabor
for his thoughtless spending.
Before long Tabor fell in love
with the simple young girl,
whom the town called Baby. She
asked him to divorce. Augusta to
marry her, thus making herself
hated by all the society women
in Denver where the prosperous
couple had moved.
Married IJIV.
Their married life was blissful
until the United States adopted
the gold standard and silver - was
no longer needed. Tabor was
completely ruined and died in
poverty, having m;ide Baby
promise never to give up the
mine. She then moved back to
Leadville, where she would ac
cept no charity. She died in 1935.
Moore then told how the origi
nal story was adapted and made
into an opeva.
Moore, a Columbia University
professor and Pulitzer Prize win
ner, is a life member of the

Letters and the American Soci
ety of Composers. He has writ

DOUGLAS MOORE
"Baby Doe" Composer
"Problems of American Opera"
will be discussed by visiting com
poser Douglas Moore as part of
the Tuesday Evening Series to
night in Memorial Auditorium
beginning at 7:30.
Moore, head of Columbia Uni
versity's music department and
composer of "The Ballad of
Baby Doe," also gave a lecture
yesterday as an introduction to
Stanford's first performance of
his opera, which will open Thurs
day.
Moore told of two previous un
successful attempts to write an
opera about the story which has
come to be a legend in Colorado
today. Finally in 1953 he began
the opera for a third time, and it
was finished in the spring of
1956. During rehearsals at Stan
ford Moore made several
changes, so this will be the first
performance of the revised op
era.
Difficulties Involved
In telling of the difficulties in
volved in writing opera, Moore
said that strong emotional feel
ing is necessary in all the music,
which is a challenge to the com
poser. Also there must be as
much action as possible to com
pensate for the fact that many
words cannot be understood by
the audience. Another difficulty,
Moore said, is that it is hard to
retain intelligibility while ex
pressing intensity with high
pitches.
Moore fold the story of the
opera which began in Leadville,
Colo., about 100 years ago. Hor
ace Tabor, an easy-going man,
and his cautious, foresighted
wife Augusta came to the small
mining town and before many
years Tabor had made his for
tune in silver. Soon afterward a
beautiful but spoiled girl, Eliza
beth Doe, and her husband, Har
