# AFL-CIO Removes Beck From Executive Council In Unprecedented Action
## Beck Ousted by Unanimous Vote; To Remain as Teamster President 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP) -Teamsters President Dave Beck
was banished from his seat in the high command of labor today for
using his union's funds for "personal gain and profits."
The AFL-CIO Executive Council stripped Beck of his offices a>
an AFL-CIO vice-president and council member at a stormy trial

at which he hurled defiance at
his former associates.
The action, unprecedented in
the turbulent history of the labor
movement, was taken b.v unani
mous vote of the 25 council mem
bers present.
Beck, head of the nation's big
gest union, walked out of the
meeting after charging that his
suspension by the council last
March whs a "nullity" and de
clined to defend himself.
Tongue-Lashing
Although he whs not present
for the vote on his ouster, he
was obliged to listen to a 20-min
ute tongue - lashing from AFL
CTO President George Meany.
Meany told reporters there was
not "the faintest question" that
Beck had violated his "sacred
trust" in what the council called
a gross misuse of union funds.
Beck's leadership of the 1,500,-
000 - member Teamsters Union
was not affected by the Council's
action, but he faces a possible
rank-and-file revolt at the union's
convention in September.
Separate Investigation
The AFL-CIO ethical practices
committee had undertaken a sep
arate investigation to determine
if the union were dominated by
corrupt influences. Such a find
ing would force the union to get
rid of its present leadership or
face expulsion from the house of
labor.
The council's move was ap
plauded by Chairman John L.
McClellan (D-Ark.) of the Senate
Rackets Committee which also is
looking into Beck's activities. He
said the action was "more than
justified" and predicted it would
be approved by "all good union
people."
Beck Unavailable
Beck left the AFL-CIO head
quarters by a basement entrance
and could not be reached for com
ment. The usually bouncy Team
ster boss appeared somewhat
subdued as he arrived for the
hearing but apparently let off
some steam during the closed
door session.
When ho was called before the
council, Beck kept the members
waiting while he made a phone
call. He went to a pay station,
explaining that, he "didn't trust"
Meany's phones.
The council had suspended
Beck after he invoked the Fifth
Amendment to avoid testifying
about his personal finances. Its
ouster action today was based
largely on the Senate commit
tee's charges that he took more
than $320,000 in union funds and
only began repaying it when in
come tax agents got on his trail.
rites Tax Case
Beck, now under federal indict
ment for income tax evasion,
cited the tax case as his reason
for not defending himself. He
told the council that "any an
swers made here could be read
ily subpoenaed" by the govern
ment.
Meany said the question of
whether the 62 - year - old Team
ster chief had violated federal or
state laws on "theft or embezzle
ment" was not the concern of
the council.
Whether Reck stole the funds
or borrowed them," Meany said,
"the record shows lie took advan
tage of his position as a trade
union official to use money be
longing to dues-paying members
for his own personal gain and
profit."
In Seattle, Wash., a 17-member
King County grand jury was
convened shortly after Beck was
kicked out of the AFL-CIO high
command. The jury was told to
day "it is for you to ascertain"
whether Teamsters Union Presi
dent Dave Beck "borrowed or
stole" more than $300,000 in un
ion funds.
Superior Judge Lloyd W. Sho
rett told the grand jury that tes
timony before the Senate Rack
ets Committee indicated that "of
ficers of the Teamsters Union
have by trick or device embezzled
or stole hundreds of thousands
of dollars of that union."

WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP) -Teamsters President Dave Beck
was banished from his seat in the high command of labor today for
using his union's funds for "personal gain and profits."
The AFL-CIO Executive Council stripped Beck of his offices a>
an AFL-CIO vice-president and council member at a stormy trial

at which he hurled defiance at
his former associates.
The action, unprecedented in
the turbulent history of the labor
movement, was taken b.v unani
mous vote of the 25 council mem
bers present.
Beck, head of the nation's big
gest union, walked out of the
meeting after charging that his
suspension by the council last
March whs a "nullity" and de
clined to defend himself.
Tongue-Lashing
Although he whs not present
for the vote on his ouster, he
was obliged to listen to a 20-min
ute tongue - lashing from AFL
CTO President George Meany.
Meany told reporters there was
not "the faintest question" that
Beck had violated his "sacred
trust" in what the council called
a gross misuse of union funds.
Beck's leadership of the 1,500,-
000 - member Teamsters Union
was not affected by the Council's
action, but he faces a possible
rank-and-file revolt at the union's
convention in September.
Separate Investigation
The AFL-CIO ethical practices
committee had undertaken a sep
arate investigation to determine
if the union were dominated by
corrupt influences. Such a find
ing would force the union to get
rid of its present leadership or
face expulsion from the house of
labor.
The council's move was ap
plauded by Chairman John L.
McClellan (D-Ark.) of the Senate
Rackets Committee which also is
looking into Beck's activities. He
said the action was "more than
justified" and predicted it would
be approved by "all good union
people."
Beck Unavailable
Beck left the AFL-CIO head
quarters by a basement entrance
and could not be reached for com
ment. The usually bouncy Team
ster boss appeared somewhat
subdued as he arrived for the
hearing but apparently let off
some steam during the closed
door session.
When ho was called before the
council, Beck kept the members
waiting while he made a phone
call. He went to a pay station,
explaining that, he "didn't trust"
Meany's phones.
The council had suspended
Beck after he invoked the Fifth
Amendment to avoid testifying
about his personal finances. Its
ouster action today was based
largely on the Senate commit
tee's charges that he took more
than $320,000 in union funds and
only began repaying it when in
come tax agents got on his trail.

McClellan (D-Ark.) of the Senate
Rackets Committee which also is
looking into Beck's activities. He
said the action was "more than
justified" and predicted it would
be approved by "all good union
people."
Beck Unavailable
Beck left the AFL-CIO head
quarters by a basement entrance
and could not be reached for com
ment. The usually bouncy Team
ster boss appeared somewhat
subdued as he arrived for the
hearing but apparently let off
some steam during the closed
door session.
When ho was called before the
council, Beck kept the members
waiting while he made a phone
call. He went to a pay station,
explaining that, he "didn't trust"
Meany's phones.
The council had suspended
Beck after he invoked the Fifth
Amendment to avoid testifying
about his personal finances. Its
ouster action today was based
largely on the Senate commit
tee's charges that he took more
than $320,000 in union funds and
only began repaying it when in
come tax agents got on his trail.
rites Tax Case
Beck, now under federal indict
ment for income tax evasion,
cited the tax case as his reason
for not defending himself. He
told the council that "any an
swers made here could be read
ily subpoenaed" by the govern
ment.
Meany said the question of
whether the 62 - year - old Team
ster chief had violated federal or
state laws on "theft or embezzle
ment" was not the concern of
the council.
Whether Reck stole the funds
or borrowed them," Meany said,
"the record shows lie took advan
tage of his position as a trade
union official to use money be
longing to dues-paying members
for his own personal gain and
profit."
In Seattle, Wash., a 17-member
King County grand jury was
convened shortly after Beck was
kicked out of the AFL-CIO high
command. The jury was told to
day "it is for you to ascertain"
whether Teamsters Union Presi
dent Dave Beck "borrowed or
stole" more than $300,000 in un
ion funds.
Superior Judge Lloyd W. Sho
rett told the grand jury that tes
timony before the Senate Rack
ets Committee indicated that "of
ficers of the Teamsters Union
have by trick or device embezzled
or stole hundreds of thousands
of dollars of that union."
