### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP)
The Senate, in its first major
reversal of the current economy
drive, today added $62,501,257 to
an emergency money bill to fi
nance such government activities
as metals stockpiling and disaster
relief.
The $142,342,045 measure was
passed by a roll-call vote of TO
to 5 and sent back to the House,
which had voted only $79,840,788
for the same purposes. A joint
conference committee will have
to thresh out differences between
the two versions.
The action came as President
Eisenhower prepared to go on tel
evision tomorrow night for the
second week in a row to appeal
for public support in his battle
against drastic congressional cuts
in his new $71.8 billion budget for
the next fiscal year.
Foreign Aid Program
The White House said the Chief
Executive will send his pared
down $3.88 billion foreign aid pro
gram to Congress before he goes
on the air. The aid program is a
prime target of the congressional
economy bloc.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles, who originally had plan
ned to hold a news conference to
morrow, canceled it to work on
the aid program and to help the
President prepare his speech.
Although it cut the regular
State Department budget last
week, the Senate went along with
its Appropriations Committee to
day and voted $449,000 more than
the House for department salaries
and expenses for the rest of this
year.
In Chicago, Democratic Sen.
Harry F. Byrd and GOP Sen.
Styles Bridges Jed representatives
of 30 major groups today in de
manding cuts in President Eisen
howers budget.
">lnst Dangerous"
Byrd, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, called the
$71.8 billion budget"the most
dangerous I have ever known"
among the 25 budgets he has seen
in his senatorial career.
He called for a slash of $9 hi I
â€¢lion, and Bridges, ranking Rcpub
lican on the Senate Appropria
tions Committee, said more than
$3 billion could be lopped off the
President's record-breaking peace
time budget.
Byrd, of Virginia, and Bridges,
of New Hampshire, spoke to morn
than 100 representatives of such
groups as the National Farm Bu
reau Federation, the U.S. Cham
her of Commerce and the Amen
can Medical Association.
