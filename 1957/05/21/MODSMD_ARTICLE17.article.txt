# Democracy and House Meetings
## 
### 
Democracy as we know it embodies many
principles, not the least of which is the prin
ciple which guarantees the individual a free
dom of action which cannot he suppressed by
the will of the majority.
I his principle is well established in the
amendments to the Constitution of the United
Slates known as the Bill of liights. Only bv a
very difficult amending process can these rights
he taken from the American people.
All too often, however, we find an otherwise
democratic system which lacks such guarantees
of individual freedom, of personal liberty. Usu
ally this lack is completely unnoticcd by those
existing under this system.
It is only too easy to see how this unfortunate
situation can occur. The principle of majority
rule has been so well drilled into Americans
1 11;il the principle of personal liberty has be
come lost or pushed oi;! of focus. And so
democracy wrapped in the strait jacket of
majority rule on all questions becomes tvrannv
toward the individual.
Such an introduction seems hardly fair when
applied to a situation which exists oit our
campus. Jet, by no other argument can we
legitimately condemn a practice which is fol
lowed by the great majority of women's resi
dences, and, no doubt, some men's—that of
compulsory attendance at house meetings.
It would seem that such a question is reallv
insignificant and hardly one that would com
promise a healthy, enlightened attitude toward
democracy. Such an assumption would be en

tirely correct. Were there no compulsory house
meetings, it would he chihlish and an indica
tion of immaturity to advocate such a rule.
It is deplorable that we must editorially argue
against such an undemocratic situation and, by
doing so, point up the immaturity of Hie
franters and the advocates of such a rule.
W ere we to ask these advocates their opinion
of the democratic validity of a national law
compelling all citizens to attend their town
meetings for one hour each week, they would
view both our suggestion and us with unmiti
gated horror. 11 would truly he unthinkable
in their eyes. ft, in the same breath they will
tell us that a compulsory house meeting rule
is justified under circumstances they often
find difficult to state.
There is doubt in our minds whether a
majority of women really believe in the Tight
ness <»(' such compulsion. But even if such a
majority does exist, that rule cannot thereby
he sanctioned as "right."
We condemn the rule as a violation of demo
cratic principles, and we condemn those who
would by their vote force such a rule upon
their brothers and sisters.
But we can condemn from here to eternity
without one move being made to correct this
situation. Only those existing under it can
correct it. To you we say: wake up and protest.
Protest in your house meetings; protest to the
• leans: protest to your parents, to alumni, to
President Sterling, to your congressmen, to
President Eisenhower, to anyone—but protest.
