# The 						Unhappy 51
## 
### 
Sorry Stanford, who three weeks ago proba
bly voted against any changes in the present
women's housing ratio, has now been placed
in Lagunita as a junior resident.
She is furious!
Sorry could be any one of the 51 "unhappy"
juniors who suddenly find themselves a mi
nority among some 300 sophomores who are
not so unhappy about being placed in Lag.
The Administration didn't put them in this
situation, nor did the Housing Committee ma
nipulate the ratio . . . the women literally
\ OTED them into this predicament.
The Housing Committee tried to tell the
Stanford women that the system of house
placing as it is currently set up is not working
effectively. They presented the facts of the
situation to the women along with two possible
alternativesâ€”to make Lag an all-sophomore
dorm or to change the ratio so that more jun
iors and seniors could, under the AWS by
laws, legallv be placed in Lag, thereby re
inforcing a belief that it is desirable to have a
mixture of classes represented in each house.
Neither change was acceptable to the Stan
ford women. They left the system as it was.
And, as happened last year, under the sarno

system, a handful of juniors was legally placed
in Lag.
The system is poor. The juniors finding
themselves in Lag have a right to complain.
They should request further constructive action
from AWS; they should tell their more fortu
nate friends, who luckily drew a better number,
to vote differently next time; and if and when
that next time comes, every Stanford woman
should make a sincere effort to think beyond
her own personal situation and consider how
the present system is affecting other women.
It is ridiculous that women should impose
rules upon themselves which they do not like.
And it is unfortunate that a few juniors are
going to have to live in Lag as examples of a
bad system. But that is exactly what the Stan
ford women have asked for . . . and that is
exactlv what they are getting.
The "Unhappy 51" have two obligations.
First, to complain loud enough so that in the
future their plight ca?i he avoided and one
solid, constructive plan can be proposed, and,
second, to participate in Lagunita activities and
add as much of their junior-standing wisdom,
enthusiasm and understanding to that dorm as
possible.
