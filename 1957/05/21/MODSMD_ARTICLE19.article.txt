## Princeton Students Have the Perfect Gift 
### Dave Canfield 
There is no end to the enterprise and inven
tiveness that can f be found in the mind of the
average college student.
This conclusion can be drawn from perusing
the erudite columns of even other college news
papers than The Daily.
Example No. 1: Two enterprising students at
Princeton are working their way through college
by running, a new gift-buying service. According
1o Ihe Associated Press, the slogan of Bill Jones
and Ray Willey is "The gift for the girl who has
everything" (and the gift is always the same—
a two-month-old live Florida alligator in a plas
tic box).
The gators, about a foot long, are supplied by
a man in Fort Lauderdale. Willey and Jones
have received more than two dozen orders at
$(>.25 each. They guarantee live and happy alli
gators.
(For the benefit of students wondering what
kind of gifts to get their friends and professors
for graduation, the address of Willey and Jones
is unknown. Sorry.)

At Madison, Wis., students at the University
of Wisconsin almost succeeded in blowing up a
phone booth—from the inside. The booth was
found in a somewhat abnormal condition, with
its inside walls thoroughly ch.arred.
There is no end to the enterprise and inven
tiveness that can f be found in the mind of the
average college student.
This conclusion can be drawn from perusing
the erudite columns of even other college news
papers than The Daily.
Example No. 1: Two enterprising students at
Princeton are working their way through college
by running, a new gift-buying service. According
1o Ihe Associated Press, the slogan of Bill Jones
and Ray Willey is "The gift for the girl who has
everything" (and the gift is always the same—
a two-month-old live Florida alligator in a plas
tic box).
The gators, about a foot long, are supplied by
a man in Fort Lauderdale. Willey and Jones
have received more than two dozen orders at
$(>.25 each. They guarantee live and happy alli
gators.
(For the benefit of students wondering what
kind of gifts to get their friends and professors
for graduation, the address of Willey and Jones
is unknown. Sorry.)
