No Railroading
Editor, The Daily:
As the letter to The Daily yesterday pointed
out, it is quite ironical that sophomores with
high numbers are living on the Row, when jun
iors* who would rather live there or in Florence
Moore, are living in Lagunita. However, I do not
feel that the Housing Committee, AWS Cabinet,
or AWS Board could have determined infallibly
the intricacies of the drawing preferences of
some 1000 women.
The letter also charged that the Housing Com
mittee railroaded the measure through the stu
dents without adeyuate discussion. To this, 1
can only point out that the area preferences of
each class were and these results an
nounced in house meetings. The measure itself
was discussed exhaustively in AWS Cabinet, and
presented with its various aspects to AWS
Board, a group made up of Cabinet and all
house, corridor and casa presidents. These presi
dents, in turn, were asked to present it in their
house meetings for discussion.
Because (he Housing Committee took pains
to present it to as many officers as was feasible,
gather and publish the statistics available, I
don't feel lhat they are to blame for the results
either of the election or of ihe drawing. If the
blame lies anywhere, it is on you or your offi
cers for not discussing the issue thoroughly as
the Housing Committee wished, or for being so
oblivious that you now consider yourself rail
roaded by a committee which made absolutely
no move to do that.

Matter for Entire School
Editor, The Daily:
We have chuckled long enough at the girls'
living regulations and at the general farce of the
double standard, regardless of the many varied
rationalizations for the existence of the latter.
The matter of sign-out slips, late leaves, hours,
et al., is more than a laughing matter, or some
times, a nuisance to the men students who
themselves do not have to put up with these and
many other restrictions imposed exclusively on
the girls.
They are now quibbling over a new system of
regulation. If these regulations were openly im
posed upon them by the school administration,
they would not be as insidious as they now are,
and their wisdom could be comfortably debated
over Cellar coffee.
Giving young women the privilege of govern-

ing themselves seems to produce in them a tend
ency to outdo even outside authority in legislat
ing controls over an alarmingly large portion of
their lives. And the unfortunate aspect of this
is that these young students of today will be
come tomorrow's "OK" social group: the mem
bers of PTA's, the Democratic and Republican
committeewomen; many of them will have a
voice in some aspect of government.
An early indoctrination in governing for gov
erning's sake, spiced with rationalized justifica
tions limited only by the scope of a given girl's
imagination, reinforces the general trend of so
ciety to legislate controls for its every facet.
A few of us were born too late and view'this
trend with distaste and discomfort. A simile has
been made in these columns comparing a vote
for one or another set of living regulations a
choice between Sing Sing and Alcatraz. An
answer was given in a subsequent letter that the
new rules would be a decided improvement over
the old.
When there is no need for a law, any law is
heinous. If we in this country were to, in out
own democratic .fashion,-enact the same system
of government that allegedly exists in Russia,
the result would be no more palatable than this
Russian system. And the claim that "we did
this of our own free will" would be but ego-salve.
If the present antics of the girls had no bear
ing on all of our future lives, we could afford to
leave them alone. These antics do not leave us
untouched. It is time for the entire school to
consider them.

Better Example Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Surely you could have thought of a better ex
ample of Mr. Crothers' magnanimity than that
he made five downtrodden Stanford men his
guests at a lu.sh Palm Springs hotel. Neither
side appears in a very good light here. The
judge would turn over in his grave if he knew
vve consider it exemplary of his noble contribu
tions that he allowed some of our students to
absorb expensive sunshine for nothing. Were
their fathers too destitute to put them'up at a
resort hotel? What a shame. It's a good thing
we have philanthropists to alleviate such press
ing social problems.
I do think this petty illustration, even if you
meant it only as an anecdote, ought not to have
been included in the same article with mention
of truly great contributions like libraries, dormi
tories and scholarship funds.
