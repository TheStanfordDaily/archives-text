tixams loom closer and closer. The sands run out; the
chips are down. This, you will agree, is no time for levity.
Accordingly, I have asked the makers of Philip Morris
whether I might not dispense with jesting in today's col
umn and instead devote it to a cram course in languages.
Their consent was cheerfully given, for they are fine,
great-hearted men, the makers of Philip Morris, just as
full of natural goodness as the cigarettes they turn out,
just as friendly, just as jolly, just as regular, just as un
altered, just as agreeable. "Why, bless you, child !" cried
the makers. "Of course!" Then they rumpled my chest
nut curls and somebody cried "Not it!" and before you
could say flip-top box, a game of Squat Tag was on, and
we played 'til the moon was over the yardarm, and then,
pink and tousled, we all went inside and had flagons of
temperance punch and Philip Morris cigarettes and fell
into our trundle beds and slept the clock around!
But I digress. Today let us turn our attention to the
study of languages.
Do you realize how important languages are? 1 must
confess that, until recently, I did not. "What good will
Spanish ever do me?" I kept asking.
Well sir, I found out. Recently 1 took a trip to Latin
America, and every day I thanked my lucky stars for
having learned Spanish in college. While my fellow tour
ists stumbled and bumbled, 1 was perfectly at home.

I recall our first stop in Mexico City. I stepped from
the airplane, walked over to the nearest colorful native,
and said, "Hasta la vista, senorita. (Good morning, sir.)
f;Pero lan lastimas y calimadades se agravaban was y mas
cada dia?" (Has thy footman finished sweeping out thy
chamber?)
"No, sir," he replied in Spanish. "He is an idle rogue."
"How is thy footman called?" I asked.
"He is called Diego," replied my friend, "and the little
daughter of his fat sister is called Juanita. She has two
small books, one gray cat, three black dogs, 24 red
chickens, one fat pig, eight pewter mugs, and a partridge
in a pear tree."
"Wilt thou have a Philip Morris cigarette?" I asked.
"Gracious," he said thankfully.
We lit Philip Morrises and smoked contentedly the
better part of the day.
"Perhaps by now my footman shall have finished sweep
ing my chamber," he said. "Wilt thou not come to my
house?"
"Gracious," I said.
Arm in arm we walked to his house, but, alas, his
footman had not yet swept out his chamber. So we each
took a barrel stave and beat the impudent scamp until
it was time for my airplane to take off.
Aloha, Mexico, brooding land of enchantment!

We lit Philip Morrises and smoked contentedly the
better part of the day.
"Perhaps by now my footman shall have finished sweep
ing my chamber," he said. "Wilt thou not come to my
house?"
"Gracious," I said.
Arm in arm we walked to his house, but, alas, his
footman had not yet swept out his chamber. So we each
took a barrel stave and beat the impudent scamp until
it was time for my airplane to take off.

tixams loom closer and closer. The sands run out; the
chips are down. This, you will agree, is no time for levity.
Accordingly, I have asked the makers of Philip Morris
whether I might not dispense with jesting in today's col
umn and instead devote it to a cram course in languages.
Their consent was cheerfully given, for they are fine,
great-hearted men, the makers of Philip Morris, just as
full of natural goodness as the cigarettes they turn out,
just as friendly, just as jolly, just as regular, just as un
altered, just as agreeable. "Why, bless you, child !" cried
the makers. "Of course!" Then they rumpled my chest
nut curls and somebody cried "Not it!" and before you
could say flip-top box, a game of Squat Tag was on, and
we played 'til the moon was over the yardarm, and then,
pink and tousled, we all went inside and had flagons of
temperance punch and Philip Morris cigarettes and fell
into our trundle beds and slept the clock around!
But I digress. Today let us turn our attention to the
study of languages.
Do you realize how important languages are? 1 must
confess that, until recently, I did not. "What good will
Spanish ever do me?" I kept asking.
Well sir, I found out. Recently 1 took a trip to Latin
America, and every day I thanked my lucky stars for
having learned Spanish in college. While my fellow tour
ists stumbled and bumbled, 1 was perfectly at home.

I recall our first stop in Mexico City. I stepped from
the airplane, walked over to the nearest colorful native,
and said, "Hasta la vista, senorita. (Good morning, sir.)
f;Pero lan lastimas y calimadades se agravaban was y mas
cada dia?" (Has thy footman finished sweeping out thy
chamber?)
"No, sir," he replied in Spanish. "He is an idle rogue."
"How is thy footman called?" I asked.
"He is called Diego," replied my friend, "and the little
daughter of his fat sister is called Juanita. She has two
small books, one gray cat, three black dogs, 24 red
chickens, one fat pig, eight pewter mugs, and a partridge
in a pear tree."
"Wilt thou have a Philip Morris cigarette?" I asked.
"Gracious," he said thankfully.
