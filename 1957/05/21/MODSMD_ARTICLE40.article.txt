She wants to know what we did with the $401,518,000

Y)fnf.e Rf.iff.t is a secretary in the markct-
X Ling department of Union Oil. She is nlso
—through our Employees' Incentive Plan —
one of our 5,906 employees who hold shares
in the firm.
This entitles her (along with over 65,000
other people who own shares in Union Oil)
to a report on the 66th year of business of
the 471h largest industrial company in the
country.
(low wc spent it
In 1056 our customers paid us the record
amount of $401,518,000.
We spent 72.1 % of this—or $289,48 ] ,000
—with over sixteen thousand other com
panies and individuals with whom we do
business.
Th* more than 1000 lax collecting agen-

cies took another 3.7% or $14,830,000. This
does no/ include the $74,120,000 we collected
from our customers as fuel tnxes and turned
over to governmental agencier
Wages and other benefits for our workers
and their families amounted to 15.7%, or
$62,966,000 of our income.
The ncl profit
This left 8.5% — or $34,241,000 — as net
profit. Slightly more than half of these earn
ings—$18,261,315—were paid in cash divi
dends to Rcnce Rcifcl and our other 65,000
share owners. (Note that our share owners
received only about three and a half million
dollars more than the various tax agencies,
which contributed nothing to the business.)
The balance of our net earnings—equal
to 4.0% of our customers' dollars—we

reinvested in the business fo expnnd and
' modernize facilities.
It seems to us that this report does more
than give nn account of our stewardship to
Rcnce Reifel and our other share owners.
It points up tlie broader base of owner
ship of American business. In the last four
years, for example, the shareholders of all
companies listed on the New York Stock
Exchange increased by 33%. Union ()il did
even better—41%.
I his could happen only in a freely com
petitive economy that encourages and re
wards individual effort.
