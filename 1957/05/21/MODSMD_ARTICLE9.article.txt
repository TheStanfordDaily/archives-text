# Women Vote In New System of Social Rules
## 
### 
Stanford women voted over
whelmingly last night to adopt a
new social regulations program.
The vote was 1172 yes to 175 no.
The new, more liberal system will
go into effect next autumn quar
ter.
One hundred women wrote in
the comment that they wanted the
bonus back. The new plan abol
ishes it.
Under the old plan, the bonus
was allotted each quarter to be
used for not more than three
emergency situations. In this way
a woman could accumulate a total
of 15 lockout minutes without be
ing penalized.
New System
The new system will give junior
and senior women unlimited 2:30
late leaves. Sophomores will re
ceive 45 2:3o's. First-quarter frosh
are allotted 20 l:3o's and five
2:3o's, while second- and third
quarter freshmen get 25 l:3o's
and 10 2:3Cfs.
Freshman women will also bo
given four extra 1:30 a.m. late
leaves to be used during Thanks
giving vacation.
The demerit system is also
changed under the new plan. Each
woman is allotted 12 demerits in
stead of five. Whole demerits will
be awarded as penalties instead
of the former practice of giving
a third or an eighth of a demerit
for a violation.
This will necessitate Women's
Council going through each wom
an's present record and deciding
how many demerits she has under
the new program.
One Exception
The only exception to the whole
demerit plan will be half-demerits
given for failure to sign in.
Guest violations under this re
vision will only be appealable if
the guest has written an explana
tion on the back of her late-leave
slip.
Late-leave slips will contain an
extra line asking for the time of
expected return. It will be op
tional for women to fill it in.
