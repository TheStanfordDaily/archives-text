# Composer Sees Great Music Ahead
## Douglas Moore Tells U.S. Opera Problems In Tuesday Series Talk 
### Camille Petersen 
"When we can dispel the idea
that a plot cannot be sung from
the minds of the people, Ameri
can music will then enter the pe
riod of its true greatness," con
eluded Douglas Moore, visiting
composer of 'The Ballad of Baby
Doe" and chairman of the music
department of Columbia Univer
sity.
"The Problems of American
Opera" were discussed by Moore
as part of the Tuesday Evening
Series last night in Memorial Au
ditorium.
Moore explored five reasons
for liking opera: its association
wilh aristocracy; the great spec
tacle; the appeal of singing; the
appeal of the great orchestra;
and the least understood but
most important to him, drama
through music.
Music and Drama
Opera is the combination of
music arirl drama. The paradox
that must be resolved in produc
ing a good work is the tendency
of the music to wish to run in
patterns and the play's desire to
keep going. Arias are incorpo
rated to satisfy musical tenden
cies among the usual changing
vocal lines which carry the ac
tion.
American opera as well as op
era in general has much tradi
tion to overcome before it can
have a true appeal to the public
in mass, Moore stated.
Since American culture had its
bases in Europe, artists in all
fields have had to struggle to
prove their work as good as that
which is imported. Opera com
posers have also had to fight the
idea that operas should not be
sung in English.
Four Companies
Moore pointed to the fact that
there are only four top opera
companies in the United States—
San Francisco Opera Company,
Chicago Opera Company, Metro
politan Opera Company and the
City Center Opera Company —
and that only a few universities
presented first-class opera, Stan
ford being one.
He used the facts that there
has not been an opera by an
American composer presented at
the Metropolitan since 1951, that
there is only one planned for next
season, and that when the City
Center company presented its
lone American opera last fall it
had trouble selling tickets for
two performances, to exemplify
the trouble American opera com
posers face.
Moore stressed that there must
be a "wedding of music and the
public." The means by which
this could be accomplished would
be by the use of timely subjects
and presentation in English.
When works are done in a for
eign tongue, the audience is lim
ited.
