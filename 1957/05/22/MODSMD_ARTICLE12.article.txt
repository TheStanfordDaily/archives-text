# Visiting Thailand Professor Praises Chemistry Department
## Thailand Students Take Two Exams; Study In Six-Weeks 'Dead Term'; Get No Grades 
### 
Stanford's Chemistry Department is better equipped and much
more modern than Thailand chemistry departments, observed Dr.
Kalya Isarasena, currently visiting the campus for a three-week
study of science facilities.
Dr. Isarasena and his wife are both in the United States under the

auspices of the State Department
to spread good will and foster
belter relations between the two
countries as well as accumulate
practical knowledge for use in
their home country of Thailand.
Mrs. Isarasena, a teacher in
secondary schools, is now visit
ing Bay Area high schools. She
and her husband will go separate
ways in their observations for
the remainder of their U.S. tour,
and will meet in the East, before
traveling to Europe and then
home.
"Our students have only two
examinations a year," Dr. Isara
sena said. "Our academic year is
divided into three terms, just as
yours is, but we have one testing
period in'the middle of the sec
ond term and then another just
before school is out.
Get Two Flunks
"II students flunk two of these
exams, they are expelled from
the university. We also have no
grading system, as you do.
"Our students arc responsible
for knowledge accumulated
throughout the entire year and
are given mainly essay ques
tions, very extensive in scope."
Rather than "dead week" or
even "dead month," Thai stu
dentts have "dead term," about
six weeks when absolutely noth
ing hut studying is done.
Major fields in Thai universi
ties are very specialized. When
a student graduates in four years
with a Rachelor of Arts degree,
he is highly qualified to find
work.
A liberal education, as is prac
ticed so much in America, is as
sumed to have been acquired in
secondary schools, and is unnec
essary in the university curricu
lum.

"Most of our chemistry, phys
ics and engineering students are
employed by the government,
rather than private industries
and companies, when they gradu
ate from colleges. Hydroelectric
plants and the main industry of
agriculture employ a great many
of these specialized students," he j
said.
"About the same type of re
search and studying is done in
Thai chemistry departments,
even though our facilities are not
completely up to date.
Since a foreign language is re
quired of all students in the see-1
ondary school, most students j
study English, and thus the ma
jority of university students can
read English very well, he ex
plained.

Stanford's Chemistry Department is better equipped and much
more modern than Thailand chemistry departments, observed Dr.
Kalya Isarasena, currently visiting the campus for a three-week
study of science facilities.
Dr. Isarasena and his wife are both in the United States under the

auspices of the State Department
to spread good will and foster
belter relations between the two
countries as well as accumulate
practical knowledge for use in
their home country of Thailand.
Mrs. Isarasena, a teacher in
secondary schools, is now visit
ing Bay Area high schools. She
and her husband will go separate
ways in their observations for
the remainder of their U.S. tour,
and will meet in the East, before
traveling to Europe and then
home.
"Our students have only two
examinations a year," Dr. Isara
sena said. "Our academic year is
divided into three terms, just as
yours is, but we have one testing
period in'the middle of the sec
ond term and then another just
before school is out.
Get Two Flunks
"II students flunk two of these
exams, they are expelled from
the university. We also have no
grading system, as you do.
"Our students arc responsible
for knowledge accumulated
throughout the entire year and
are given mainly essay ques
tions, very extensive in scope."
Rather than "dead week" or
even "dead month," Thai stu
dentts have "dead term," about
six weeks when absolutely noth
ing hut studying is done.
Major fields in Thai universi
ties are very specialized. When
a student graduates in four years

he is highly qualified to find
