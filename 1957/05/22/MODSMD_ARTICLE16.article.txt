# Year's Worst Tornado Flattens Kansas City Area; 53 Killed
## Twister Lifts Supermarket Roof; Over 500 New Homes Damaged 
### 
KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 21 (UP)â€”The season's worst tornado,
which lifted houses like toys and flattened a four-story brick build
ing, left a toll of at least 53 dead and more than 2UO injured here
today.
Blasting a 75-mile swath in Kansas, the twister killed two persons

at Ottawa and four at Spring Hill
last night before it skipped over
the state line and crushed the
Kansas City, Mo., suburbs of Mar
tin City, Hickman Mills and Rus
kin Heights.
The storm-stricken communities
south of Kansas City were scenes
of devastation. Not one structure
stood in Martin City (population
300), and more than 500 new
homes were demolished or dam
aged in Ruskin Heights and Hick
man Mills.
Several pcrs on s in Ruskin
Heights, warned of the approach
ing storms by radio and TV broad
casts, rushed to the shopping cen
tor for refuge, only to die there
when the terrible wind lifted the
roof of a supermarket "like a
kite" and collapsed the brick
walls.
Scores were trapped in the mar
ket's rubble, but uninjured neigh
bor's formed a brigade to clear
the debris and saved many.
The area was placed under mar
tial law and a National Guard unit
was ordered to duty to prevent
looting.
Describes Disaster
Mrs. Lena Cap p o, 53, who
watched the storm from a window
of her home, described the super
market disaster.
"The roof just raised up with
a ripping noise and seemed to
float away in the terrible wind,"
she said. "Then the rear wall of
the big building collapsed and sev
eral people were covered with
bricks."
Highways south of the city were
jammed with sightseers for sev
eral hours after the storm hit at
9:45 p.m. (EDT), hampering res
cue attempts to get the injured
to Kansas City hospitals.
The devastated sections of Mi
ami, Johnson and Franklin coun
ties in Kansas and Jackson county
in Missouri were declared disaster
areas by the Small Business Ad
ministration in Washington.
The declaration will enable own
ers of homes or businesses that
were damaged or destroyed to
apply to the SBA for reconstruc
tion or rehabilitation loans at 3
per cent interest.
Families Separated
More than 150 persons were in
Kansas City hospitals, many still
on the critical list. Families were
separated by the storm, and ef
forts were made to find relatives
at hospitals and funeral homes.
The wind demolished the new
brick Presbyterian church in Rus
kin Heights as Harry Woodling,
34, his wife and three children
tried to reach it for safety.
