# English Named To Beck's Job In AFL-CIO
## Labor Chiefs Drive To Make Teamsters Get Rid of Own Boss 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 21 (UP)
The AFL-CIO tightened the
squeeze on Teamster president
Dave Beck today by naming John
F. English, union secretary-treas
urer, to replace him on the feder
ation's executive council.
The move was part of the drive
by the labor high command to dis
lodge Beck from the Teamster
leadership as well as his AFL-CIO
offices.
AFL-CIO president George Mea
ny predicted flatly that English
would suceed in "getting rid" of
Beck, who only yesterday was
ousted as an AFL-CIO vice-presi
dent and executive council mem
ber. The council found him "com
pletely guilty of gross misuse of
union funds."
Wash Dirty Linen
Shortly after his election by the
25-member executive council, Eng
lish was quoted by Meany as tell
ing the council that "we're going
to wash our own dirty linen.
American labor is going to be
proud of us again."
Meany said that "I haven't any
doubt" about English's position on
the Teamster Union's current sit
uation. "I think he'd like to get
rid of Dave Beck."
Asked if he thought English
would succeed in this effort, Mea
ny replied, "I'd say so."
English's election amounted to
a strong AFL-CIO bid to Team
ster members to get rid of Beck
and avoid being tossed out of the
labor federation on charges of
corrupt leadership. The AFL-CK )
ethical practices committee now
is considering these charges.
Most Cooperative
Sen. John McClollan (D-Ark.),
whose Senate rackets investigal
ing commitlee aired most of the
charges against Beck, said Enp
lish "has been most cooperative
with the committee."
English, secretary-treasurer of
the Teamsters for 11 years, has
opposed Beck on a number of Ji
nancial issues since Beck took
over as union president five years
ago.
Sources close to English said lie
is not personally interested in the
Teamsters presidency and wants
re-election to his own post in Sep
l tern be r.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (UP)
The AFL-CIO tightened the
squeeze on Teamster president
Dave Beck today by naming John
F. English, union secretary-treas
urer, to replace him on the feder
ation's executive council.
The move was part of the drive
by the labor high command to dis
lodge Beck from the Teamster
leadership as well as his AFL-CIO
offices.
AFL-CIO president George Mea
ny predicted flatly that English
would suceed in "getting rid" of
Beck, who only yesterday was
ousted as an AFL-CIO vice-presi
dent and executive council mem
ber. The council found him "com
pletely guilty of gross misuse of
union funds."
Wash Dirty Linen
Shortly after his election by the
25-member executive council, Eng
lish was quoted by Meany as tell
ing the council that "we're going
to wash our own dirty linen.
American labor is going to be
proud of us again."
Meany said that "I haven't any
doubt" about English's position on
the Teamster Union's current sit
uation. "I think he'd like to get
rid of Dave Beck."
Asked if he thought English
would succeed in this effort, Mea
ny replied, "I'd say so."
English's election amounted to
a strong AFL-CIO bid to Team
ster members to get rid of Beck
and avoid being tossed out of the
labor federation on charges of
corrupt leadership. The AFL-CK )
ethical practices committee now
is considering these charges.
Most Cooperative
Sen. John McClollan (D-Ark.),
whose Senate rackets investigal
ing commitlee aired most of the
charges against Beck, said Enp
lish "has been most cooperative
with the committee."
English, secretary-treasurer of
the Teamsters for 11 years, has
opposed Beck on a number of Ji
nancial issues since Beck took
over as union president five years
ago.
Sources close to English said lie
is not personally interested in the
Teamsters presidency and wants
re-election to his own post in Sep
l tern be r.
