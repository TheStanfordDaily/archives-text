# PCC Dilemma
## 
### 
By * ONE-VOTE MARGIN, the PCC allowed the
I (.LA Bruins to stay in the conference Mon
day. Stanford was with the four dissenting
votes that refusal to acknowledge that UCLA
had done its job of cleaning up its athletic
program.
While we are not sure thai expelling IK lI.A
is the answer to the problem of aid to athletes
within the conference, we lliiuk it is right that
Stanford go on record as opposing the altitude
of I <.I,A, which has shown much contempt for
the conference's penalties ami clean-up orders.
use, w ashington and Cal were originally
guilty of violations, some as had as UCLA's,
hut they have made a conscientious effort to
correct the faults and richly deserved the unan
imous support that the conference gave them.
I he conference now delves into a more basic
problem what kind of athletic aid problem
should the whole conference go under in future
years? The UCLA-USC forces would like to
see the free-ride type of uid room, board, lui

lion ami hooks. There are intermedials views,
with Stanford on the other side of the I'enee
opposing free-ride type of aid.
Stanford President Wallace Sterling last win
ter warned the conference that any such type
of aid would force Stanford to seriously re
examine its nature of participation in inter
collegiate athletics. Stanford spokesmen have
indicated that withdrawal from the conference
is not completely out of the question if an all
out aid program is adopted.
Sterling has rightfully maintained that the
true purpose of a college is education and not
athletics, and that tuition should he given on
the hasis of academic performance and need
and not athletic ability.
We heartily hope the conference will not
follow the lead of the Big Ten and decide to
go "â– big-time.' If it makes this decision, we
wonder how continued membership in the PCC
would he either practical or valuable to Stan
lord.
