# IIR Improvement
## 
### 
FIW students realize thai Stanford does, in
effect, have its own Slate Department. A de
partment, furthermore, which not only handles
our "foreign policy" hut also puts that policy
into practice. And, in a broader sense, lluil
department is responsible for much of the
public good will toward the Stanford com
munity.
Activities include organization and realiza
tion of numerous events in three fieldsâ€”con
ference, social and educational. The annual
high school conference, consular talks, foreign
student talks, Model United Nations, Interna
tional Cabaret, foreign student assistance, cul
tural exchanges through affiliated universities,
the UN library, travel and foreign scholarship
discussions are onlv a few of the concerns of
the lIR.
Yet in spite of all the successful programs
the MR has conducted this year, the group is
trying to reorganize itself. At present the gov
erning body is a lli-man executive hoard. Seven
members of this hoard are also heads of indi
vidual departments. Their resulting height
ened interest in the departments and dimin

ished interest in the unity of the lIR lead to
semi-autonomous, compartmentalized depart
ments with a lack of coordination on the policy
making level.
I he proposed plan of reorganization calls for
a five-man policy hoard including the presi
dent, the business manager and the conference,
social and educational viee-presidents. Under
this plan, each of the vice-presidents would
have over-all responsibility for more than one
department, thereby making coordination of
activities easier and affording personnel a
chance to work in ;uul for more than one de
part men I.
present lIR hoard members hope to cure
another ill with this reorganization, an ailment
which afflicts manv Stanford organizations. At
the outset of each school year 200 lo 300 stu
dents apply for lIR work. By llie end of the
school year the active personnel numbers ap
proximately 25. The proposed reorganization
plan should enable the MR to fully occupy 1!>0
students each \ear, offering those students the
kind of stimulation thai will increase the desire
to remain active.
