# FROM ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## Administration and Restrictive Scholarships 
### Frederic Glover 
Editor's Note: The following letter, written,
by Frederic O. Glover, assistant to President
Sterling, has- been sent to both Martin Horwitz
and TluÂ» Daily. It concerns a letter written by
Horwitz which appeared in The Daily May 16.
The letter criticized the University accepting a
scholarship with a "white only" clause in it.
Dear Mr. Horwitz:
I am glad that you raised the question about
the Munroe Memorial Scholarship Grant because
it gives me an opportunity to explain to you the
background of the University policy on restric
tive scholarships.
The Munroe Scholarship was given to the Uni
versity in 1946 as a memorial by a family which
had lost a son in World War 11. They were try
ing, by this scholarship, to help a student who

exemplified their son, and
ihey therefore restricted it to
graduates of the same prep
school he had attended, to stu
dents who were members of
the same fraternity to which
he belonged and who had oth
er characteristics and qualifi
cations of their son. The Mun
roes are still living, and con
sequently, it would be regret
table if controversy developed
in connection with their gen
erosity which, although re
strictive in terms, was moti-

vated by love for a son who had given his life
in the service of his country.
It is true, also, that Stanford has in the past
accepted other restrictive scholarships of a simi
lar nature. We have one for women of Cauca
sian descent, as well as one for Negro law stu
dents, one for Jewish medical students, and one
for students from Asia.
At the time these scholarships were accepted
there was no clearly defined University policy on
restrictive clauses relating to race or religion. A
few years ago the University was offered a
scholarship which by its terms would exclude
Catholics, Negroes, and Jews. This offer, which
was declined, led to a thorough study of Ihe
entire problem with the result lhat the Board
of Trustees, in February of this year, adopted
a policy which would permit acceptance of schol
arship gifts bearing restrictions as Jo race only
if those restrictions were stated in terms (if
preference. That policy, by Ihe way, precludes
the acceptance of any scholarship gifs bearing
direct or indirect restrictions as to creed.
Pursuant to this determination the University
has recently declined to accept a scholarship gift
for students of Aryan lineage, and has also de
clined a bequest to establish a scholarship for
students of a particular faith.
The Trustees' study which preceded this policy
determination included inquiry directed to other
major gift-supported universities as to their poli
cies and practices. As you might surmise, con
siderable variation was reported, but you will
be interested to know, I am sure, that only one

of the six with which we discussed this problem
follows so clear a non-discriminatory policy as
the one recently adopted by Stanford's Board
of Trustees.
In view of your comments about the Board
of Trustees' recent decision on the request of the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People that the University insert non
discriminatory clauses in sub-leases, I thought
you might wish to read fhe following comments
made by President Sterling in a letter to a Palo
Alto resident who had inquired concerning the
reasons for the Board of Trustees' action in de
clining the NAACP request:
"The University is opposed to discrimination
as a matter of policy. It does not, however, con
sider that it would be wise to include a clause
in our leases calling for reversion of the prop
erty to ihe University if a developer or sub
lessee were shown to be discriminating against
a potential buyer for reasons of race or religion.
"If a mandatory, anti-discrimination clause
were to be inserted in our leases, the University
would have to be prepared to consider and rule
on complaints in this field, as well as to enforce
ihe clause through use of forfeiture provisions.
This would require an active policing function
by the University which is foreign to its purpose.
Stanford is an educational institution, and it
would be improper for the University to attempt
to undertake functions which are properly those
of the Government or of a housing agency. To
attempt to do so would divert the University's
attention and energies from its educational
tasks. It is for a similar reason that the Uni
versity does not subdivide its lands itself, but
turns over this involved responsibility to sub
dividers; the contractual agreements between
the real estate developer and the ultimate resi
dent involve many business problems which are
not a proper concern of the University.
"Stanford's lands are an important part of its
endowment, and there is an additional question
as to the propriety of the Board of Trustees
using the investment policies of the University
to achieve any collateral purposes, even such a
worthy purpose as non-discriminatory housing
practices. The use of any investment asset as a
part of a program for the active enforcement of
prohibitions against discrimination in the offer
ing of housing or in employment in the construc
tion trades engaged in the creation of such hous
ing involves the Board of Trustees in a function
which is essentially governmental in nature and
not reasonably related to the production of in
come to be expended in the educational activities
to which the University is dedicated.
"This position has been clearly stated by a
Stanford faculty member as follows: 'Stanford's
endowment, unlike that of most private institu
tions, consists largely of its land. Getting a re
lurn from land is a considerably more compli
cated business than getting a return from
money. But the guiding principle for an educa
tional institution is the same in both cases: do
not allow the investment of wealth to become
an end rather than a means.'
