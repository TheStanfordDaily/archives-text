# ALL-CAMPUS ACTIVITY
## 17-Year-Old Spring Sing Claims Nation-Wide Fame 
### 
When spring appears at Stan
ford University, the students' at
tention quickly turns to thoughts
of . . . the Spring Sing.
Just 16 years ago Tom Howard,
then head of Rally Com, was in
need of an original project for his
organization to sponsor during
spring quarter. The singing com
petition has been an annual affair
ever since.
Nearly 3400 attended the first
performance, at which the Medi
cal School and the Chi Omegas
took top honors.
It was not until after the world
war that the present name of
"Spring Sing" was given to the
activity. Previous to this time it
had be<*h called the "All Univer
sity Sing" and the "Spring Song
fest." In 1945 it was made a part
of the Senior Week activities, but
has since been returned to the
auspices of Rally Com.
Street Dance
The year 1947 was a big one for
Stanford's Spring Sing. That year
a big street dance was held behind
Memorial Auditorium, and a car
illon concert an unrehearsed
community sing was arranged.
Several traditions are connected
with the singing. The match-light
ing ceremony was first performed
in 1949 and has grown to be one
of the most talked-about portions
of the evening's activities.
The singing of the national an
them and the alma mater and the
last appearance of the year's head
cheer leader are also part of the
annual sing. The retiring pepster
turns over the sweater to his suc
cessor, and both lead a yell at this
time.
Eight Divisions
The participating groups are
placed into eight divisions accord
ing to size, and an award is given
to the hest group in each of the
divisions. The judges then select
the. best performance of the eve
