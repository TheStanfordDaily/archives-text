Can Football Coach Chuck Taylor do it again?
Known as a developer of some of the sharpest-passing quarter
backs in football, Taylor's aerial masterminding is expected by some
to slip somewhat thrts fall on account of the loss of Ail-American
John Brodie. Out this, says USC Daily Trojan Sports Editor Carl
Sawyer, may not be the case.
Sawyer reports, "The Indians figure to have another razzle-dazzle
crew this fall that will be capable of beating any team in the coun
try."
Apparently, Sawyer is (as few southern writers have in recent
days) praising Stanford sincerely, for he goes on to say, "Unbe
lievable as it seems, Taylor thinks be will have a better quarter
back this year than be bad a year ago when John Brodie led the
nation's passers.
"|Bob'| Nicolet is the prize prospect that has sent Stanford back
ers into a frenzy. Indian war drums are raving about this six-foot
soph from Milwaukee and the decoded messages say that the limber
armed quarterback will make everyone forget all about Brodie."
Sawyer continues his euphemistic note by concluding that Stan
lord figures not to retrogress in offense and to improve in defense
and depth. In short, says the DT sports pundit, "improvement is ex
pecied in every phase of the game."
On behalf, we trust, of the Card grid eleven, this writer says,
"Thank you, SC. Praise from an unexpected source is always the
best."
Happy times do come to inmates of Fori Ord after all, accord
ing to a story in the WSC Daily Cougar. Fverett Cinst,' though
stationed at the Monterey Peninsula health establishment, found
his days brightened recently when he was named the I9. r >7 Athlete
of the Year at Washington State College.
Oust, a 180-pounder described by Coach Jim Sutherland as
"pound for pound an All-American," played guard for the grid Cou
gars before graduating in mid-semester and entering the Army.
In other awards, Hobby Seaman was chosen by the senior class
al IK'LA to receive their All-American athlete award last Wednes
day.
One of Seaman's first acts as an All-American was 1o earn dis
qualification from Saturday's PCC track meet after he shoved a
fellow miler over several lanes during the stretch run. Seaman beat
out football player Bob Bergdahl for the award.
Fritz Apking, the "bad hoy"of the 1950 University of Washing
ton football team, has turned his talents to acting. The gridder
who once ranked 12th in the nation in pass snatching played the
role of a Wall Street syndicate representative in a "Death Valley
Days" episode last Thursday on TV.
Apking made headlines in October, 1950, when he was suspended
from Ihe Husky eleven two djuys before the Stanford game <UW
won anyway, 21-7). Suspension was caused by an incident that al
legedly happened on Ihe road trip to the Illinois game.
Despite silling out that game and the next one (when Washing
lon losl Ihe Rose Bowl bid to California) Apking finished second
among PCC pass receivers, behind only the Indians' Bill McColl.
Apking goes under the stage name Frederick Ford.
Al Chapel Hill, N.C., a hot item is a record dramatizing the Uni
versity of North Carolina's "finest hour in sports since Charlie Jus
lice made 'Choo-Choo' a household phrase a decade ago." The Daily
Tar Heel says the platter "Number One" by student Hoke Simp
son has sold about 5500 copies so far.
it dramatizes North Carolina's victory in the 1957 NCAA Bas
ket hall ( hampionships'.
Alex Olmedo, USC's Peruvian wonder boy, is expected to give
Lew Hoad el al. of Australia a tremendous battle in next month's
Wimbledon World Tennis Tournament. On Sunday, May 11, Olmedo
pulled off what later may be recorded as one of the greatest feats in
tennis history.
In eight grueling hours of championship tennis, he won singles
matches over Mike Green, a Davis Cup player, and Herb Flam, the
nation's No. 2 ranking neiter. and (with partner Gil Shea) doubles
matches over Bob Perry-Noel Brown and Green-Mike Franks.
This herculean effort earned for Olmedo the singles and doubles
titles of Southern California.
His coach, George Toley, told the Daily Trojan that in the
Southern California championships Olmedo played the best tennis
of his career (a career which includes a win last fall over Lew)
Hoad, probable first seed at Wimbledon).
Quote from Friday's Daily Californian: "Stanford's Indians are
favored to take top honors in the PCC swimming championships
that begin today in Los Angeles but California isn't convinced yet."
Convinced now, boys?
