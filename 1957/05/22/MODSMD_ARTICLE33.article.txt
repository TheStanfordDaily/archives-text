# Fehring Optimistic Over 'Good Team' Next Year
## 
### Dave Canfield 
Casting a backward glance at
this season's 17-13 record and a
long optimistic look at next year,
baseball coach Dutch Fehring re
cently predicted, "We're going to
have a good team."
Coach Fehring has reason to be
optimistic. Though the gradua
tion of nine varsity players will
leave some hard - to - fill gaps,
there remain many ho p e 112 u 1
signs.
Fehring admitted lhat "the
problem is to replace < Rudy i Fi
gueroa, (Steve) Stewart and
(Bob) Fletcher" at third base,
shortstop and centerfield respec
tively and "to get more hitting."
Strong Frosli Pitching
Besides the three above-named
diamondmen, utility man John
Dito, first basemen Hal Messner
and Jerry Morgan and pitchers
Walt Payne, Ed Verdurmen and
Dick Jones are graduating. *
But, as Fehring pointed out,
pitchers Steve Watson and Dick
Williams will be up from the
freshman team to try to replace
Payne and Verdurmen. Also
helping will be the nucleus of
this year's Braves nine which
won 2~) and lost one.
Williams led the Papooses in
hitting and pitching this season
and racked up a string of 31
straight innings without allowing
an earned run.
And. outside of third, short and

center, this year's team is return
ing almost intact. Fehring com
mented, "We'll have the same
two catchers (Art Von Wronski
and Ralph Holding) the best, in
my opinion, second baseman in
lhe league in A 1 Shaw, good
pitching and a good long-ball hit
ter in Parker Olson."
% Tolson Back in Left
Olson, who led the team in
homers with four, plays left
field. Also back in the outfield is
right fielder Rich De Fabio and
first-baseman Joel Newkirk will
be returning to bolster the infield
corps.
Front-line pitchers back will be
Hob Leopold and George Avery.
Leopold, a transfer from Stock
ton JC, paced the moundsmen
this spring in earned-run aver
ages and threw a no - hitter
against I JSC.
