## 
### Barbara Hicks 
American art has shown a va
riety of trends in the first 50
years of the 20th century, and
thefce aspects are shown in the
loan exhibition from the Whitney
Museum of American Art at the
Art Gallery until June 4.
Post • impressionism, cubism,
expressionism and American
realism are among the aspects
shown in the 45 paintings in the
gallery.
The paintings come from the
Whitney Museum which was
founded by Mrs. Gertrude V.
Whitney to foster an interest in
American art. Her own collec
tion of 600 paintings formed the
nucleus of the Museum. It is
housed on 53rd Street in New
York City.
Wide Appreciation
Even the layman, knowing lit
tle or nothing about style and
technique in art, can appreciate
the paintings in the exhibition,
and, with the aid of a handbook
which may be obtained at the
gallery, can understand the back
ground behind the works.
One of the most active groups
of artists in the first decade of
this century called themselves
"The Eight," but were dubbed
the "Ash-Can School" by the pub
lic because of their turn to every
day subject matter. Six of "The
Eight" are represented in the
current exhibition.
Robert Henri's "Laughing
Child" represents one of these.
The child seems to be laughing
directly at the observer from the
dark background which contrasts
with the light-colored figure.
Ot hers of "The Eight"
Other's of "The Eight" on dis
play include George Bellows, Wil
liam Glackens, Maurice Prender
gast, John Sloan and George
Luks.
In a second group of painters—
those from 1913 to 1930 — the
post - impressionists, cubists and
those concerned with problems
of abstraction dominate. Mars
den Hartley's "Granite by the
Sea" is an example of cubism
fused with the older tradition of
American realism.
The abstraction in "Plant
Forms" by Arthur Dove is
worked in greens, yellows and
browns for effective portrayal,
while Bernard Karfiol's "Boys
and Ponies" shows the manner
of the post-impressionists.
Other artists of this period in
clude Arthur B. Carles, John Ma
rin, Charles Demuth, Preston
Dickson, Walt Kuhn, Stanton
Mac Donald - Wright, Georgia O'-
Keefe, "Niles Spencer, Joseph
Stella and Lyonel Feininger.
Stained Glass
Stella's painting. "The Brook
lyn Bridge: Variations on an Old
Theme," reminds the casual ob
server of a stained-glass window
with its rich colors. The sweep
ing flesign is shown in the grace
ful lifting of the bridge cable, the
headlights and wheels of the au
tomobiles and a piercing skyline.
A disciplined taste is shown in
the art of the 30's, the period of
the Depression. In this group
are Isabel Bishop, Peter Blume,
Alexander Brook, Charles Burch
field, John Steuart Curry, Ernest

Fiene, Edward Hopper. Yasuo
Kuniyoshi, Reginald Marsh, Ken
neth Hayes Miller, Charles Shee
ler and Eugene Speicher.
In Blume's "Light of the
World" the colors and cubistic
influence are most striking, but
one will also notice the contrast
ing softness of the clouds in the
background.
Surrealism Added
During the 30's and 40's sur
realism was introduced into
American art, chicfly by emi
gre artists. A phase of the'neo
romantic movement, surrealism
found outlet in such paintings
as "Fear" by Yves Tanguy. The
starkness portrayed in the
painting, ominous shades of
gray, black and white with
touches of yellow and red explod
ing in the distance give the paint
ing a bleakness associated with
destruction.
Also in the neo-romantic move
ment were artists Jack Levinc,
Kurt Seligmann and Ben Shahn.
Fascism and war during this pe
riod contributed to the renewal
of attacks on social inequalities
and hypocrisies, and artists de
veloped in their technique more
sophistication and intense ex
pressionism.
, According to Daniel M. Men
delowitz, professor of art here,
the paintings of the last decade
may suggest nihilism and chaos
if they are viewed in a mood of
depression or they may show the
birth of new tradition if one is
optimistic.
Crucifixion Theme
"Wood of the Holy Cross" by
Rico Lcbrun is portrayed in som
ber colors fitting the usual con
ception of the cross. Blood-red
drops contrast against the dark
ness to continue the crucifixion
theme.
In "This Architectural World"
by Balcomb Greene even the fig
ures have become pawns in the
hands of the designer.
Also included in the recent
group are James Brooks, Fritz
Glarner, Karl Knaths, I. Rice Pe
reira, Ad Reinhardt, Theodores
Stamos, Mark Tobey aijd Josef
Albers.
