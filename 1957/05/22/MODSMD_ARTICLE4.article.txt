# De Grazia Terms Budget Deficits 'Rule' in 'Y' Talk
## 
### 
"Deficits in our budget have
been the rule rather than the
exception," remarked Professor
Alfred J. de Grazia before the
"Y" Public Affairs Group yester
day.
De Grazia said that we depend
on our national debt, since if the
debt were paid off, the banks
would not know where to invest
the redeemed bonds. "The econ
omy would come crashing flown
like a house of cards if the debt
were reduced by any significant
amount."
Uninterested in whether Ike's
budget results in an actual defi
cit or not for the coming fiscal
year, de Gra/.ia said that the im
portant thing is what programs
are affected by the budget cuts.
The speaker, a political science
professor, also came out in favor
of foreign aid where it will be
helpful, less subsidy and more
free enterprise in agriculture
and more funds for the U.S. In
formation Service. In response
tfÂ» a question he stated that Ike
had "mismanaged" the politics of
dealing with Congress on the
budget question.
