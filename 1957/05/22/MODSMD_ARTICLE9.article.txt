### 
Deputy District Attorney Alli
son Rouse said Monday that, in
his opinion, the right of accused
beach attack participant Donald
Rutherdale to a delay in his May
27 trial has been waived because
a continuance had already been
granted.
Rutherdalc's attorney, Dennis L.
Woodman, petitioned Monday for
a delay of the trial in order that
he might have further time to
look over the transcript of the
case. Ruling on the petition is
expected to be available Friday.
He said the reason for the peti
tion "has nothing to do with
whether the witnesses will be
available [after the May 27 trial
date]. All I want is to see that
the defendant gets his rights."
Rouse, the prosecuting attor
ney, told The Daily that at the
preliminary hearing of the case,
April 29, Woodman had been
granted a delay in order to look*
over the transcript. A plea was

Further Delay
On May 6 Woodman asked the
court for a further delay, on the
grounds thai he had not received
the transcript in time to look it
over. Rouse said the transcript
was ready May 2, but that Wood
man had made no attempt to pick
it up.
Woodman told The Daily "the
clerk of the court must deliver
the transcript to the defendant."
Rouse asked that a stipulation
to the granting of a further con
tinuance be made that the trial
date be some time in May "be
cause otherwise the student wit
nesses would be gone." Superior
Judge Aylett R. Cotton asked
Woodman to take this into con
sideration.
Woodman told The Daily that
he "would not consider any stipu
lation to the granting of my cli
ent's rights."
Cotton then refused Woodman
a further delay, and the trial date
was set for May 27.
Client's Rights
Woodman's case is based on the
argument that the damage done
to the complainants was actually
committed by the two' other de
fendants, Louis Marks, 19, and
Donald Hawkins, 18.
He said Rutherdale has not been
identified as an originator of the
"great physical damage" which
has been charged against him.
The three youths are charged
with "assault with force resulting
in great physical damage." If
found guilty, they could incur pen
alties of from one to 10 years in
jail and $5000 fines.

he "would not consider any stipu
lation to the granting of my cli
ent's rights."
Cotton then refused Woodman
a further delay, and the trial date
was set for May 27.
Client's Rights
Woodman's case is based on the
argument that the damage done
to the complainants was actually
committed by the two' other de
fendants, Louis Marks, 19, and
Donald Hawkins, 18.
He said Rutherdale has not been
identified as an originator of the
"great physical damage" which
has been charged against him.
The three youths are charged
with "assault with force resulting
in great physical damage." If
found guilty, they could incur pen
alties of from one to 10 years in
jail and $5000 fines.
Deputy District Attorney Alli
son Rouse said Monday that, in
his opinion, the right of accused
beach attack participant Donald
Rutherdale to a delay in his May
27 trial has been waived because
a continuance had already been
granted.
Rutherdalc's attorney, Dennis L.
Woodman, petitioned Monday for
a delay of the trial in order that
he might have further time to
look over the transcript of the
case. Ruling on the petition is
expected to be available Friday.
He said the reason for the peti
tion "has nothing to do with
whether the witnesses will be
available [after the May 27 trial
date]. All I want is to see that
the defendant gets his rights."

Further Delay

court for a further delay, on the

it up.
Woodman told The Daily "the
clerk of the court must deliver
the transcript to the defendant."
Rouse asked that a stipulation
to the granting of a further con
tinuance be made that the trial
date be some time in May "be
cause otherwise the student wit
nesses would be gone." Superior
Judge Aylett R. Cotton asked
Woodman to take this into con
