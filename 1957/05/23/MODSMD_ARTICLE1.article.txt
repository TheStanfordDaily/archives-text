# PCC Denies Half-Season To Gridders
## Seniors at USC, UCLA Banned For '57 Season 
### 
SPOKANE, Wash., May 22 —
(UP) The Pacific Coast Confer
ence today refused to restore a
half season eligibility to next
year's senior gridders at IJCLA
and Southern California, two of
four schools penalized as a result
of illegal payment to athletes.
A motion to permit the penal
ized senior's to play a half-season
or five games failed to cany by
a vote of 5 to A. Schools opposing
it wem Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington Slate, Stanford and
Idaho.
Faculty representatives also, by
the same voting lineup, decided to
retain the round-robin schedule
requiring each member except
Idaho to play the other members
each year, and by a vote of 8 to 1
ended the University of Califor
nia's probationary status put into
effect last year as a result of Ihe
aid scandal.
At the same time, by a vote of
7 to 2, a USC petition to have its
probationary term ended as of
July 1 was defeated.
Los Angeles sources here said
the leniency petitions would have
affected, at Southern Cal, fullback
C. R. Roberts, halfback Ernie
Zampese, backs Don Hickman and
Doug Kranz, and center Karl
Rubke, while UCLA players af
fected would be guard Esker Har
ris, center' Jim Matheny, tackle
Jerry Penner and ends Hal Smith
and Pat Pinkston.
4 Schools Penalized
Penalties were inflicted on four
schools last year after disclosures
of illegal aid payments to athletes
in violation of the conference
code. UCLA was given three
years' probation, USC and Wash
ington two years each, and Cali
fornia one. Gridders at t he schools
lost one year's eligibility, but last
year the conference relented and
allowed seniors to play half a sea
son. or five games.
California was restored to good
graces because the faculty men
decided the school's athletic pro
gram "now is operated upon a
sound basis in strict accordance
with conference rules."
The round-robin vote came on
a motion that the total number of
football games be'limited to nine
in any season, of which at least
five should be with member
schools. Washington and the Los
Angeles schools in particular had
backed this proposal on the con
tention it would allow them to
schedule more intersectional con
tests.
Code Violations
Details of the code violations
were not disclosed, but it was pre
sumed the Idaho fine was in con
nection with the enrollment of
five English trackmen, including
distance ace Ray Hatton.
Conference spokesman Glenn
Seaborg of California said the con
ference had abandoned its policy
of levying small fines for rela
tively minor infractions of the
athletic code, and that violations
discussed were "fewer and less
serious" than in previous years.
The faculty men adjourned late
this afternoon. They still must
face perhaps the most important
item on the agenda —the matter
of aid to athletes. Seaborg said
"action, whether positive or not,"
would be taken on that problem
at the spring meeting's last ses
sion, tomorrow morning.
It was this matter - which led to
the disciplinary action against Ihe
four schools. A sliding-scale for
mula to provide payments accord
ing to cost of living at Ihe various
schools was discussed at the Port
land meeting in March, but was
put off until this session.
