# A 						Plea for Foreign Aid
## 
### 
I'ufsidknt Kisf.nhowkr went before the Amer
ican people Tuesday night with a plea for (lon
»ress lo leave 11is S'l.tt billion foreign aid pro
gram intact.
I If warned, "The road lo disaster could easily
be paved vvilli the good intentions of those
Mindly striving to save the money that must
he spent ua the price of peace." We sincerely
hope thai (loiigress heeds this vital warning
and does not cut a half-billion of the Presi
dent's request as they are threatening to do.
In llie lasl eighl years the United States has
« iven $17 hillion in military assistance to its
11ies. I his aid has done much lo fortify our
allies against (ionimunist aggression; the eco
nomic aid has lessened the chances of (loin
munis! infiltration.
\\ 11iIt* the hulk of military aid as such should
Im- restricted to the free world, econoinie aid
and some arms aid are in.poriant in making it
possible for countries like "i ugoslavia lo stand
up against Kussia. Also, so far as economy is

concerned, less foreign aid will undoubtedly
lead lo even more spending for our own armed
forces.
(longress has alreadv made one serious error
in its foreign appropriations by its 30 per cent
slash of the budget of the U.S. Information
Service, whose duly it is to spread the word
of the United Slates and the free world all
over the earth. Our propaganda voice along
side Soviet Russia's is a midget indeed.
Perhaps Eisenhower's plea has come 100 late.
The Admiuistralion has already cut llie amount
by a half-hillion less than estimated in his
January budget message, with the unfortunate
effect of leaving senators with the philosophy
of Rhode Island's Theodore Green: "If they
can cut one-half billion dollars just like that,
perhaps we'll start where I hey left oIV. '
Eisenhower has mentioned his request as a
minimum figure, for the maintenance of peace
and security in the world, (longress should for
get about culling to please their constituents
and regard il as minimum also.
