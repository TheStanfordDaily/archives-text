Flagrantly Wrong in Principle
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Frederic Glover has cautioned us that we
ought to be silent on thp issups raispd by Mr.
and Mrs. Edward Munrop's discriminatory gen
erosity. "The Munroes are still living," he says,
and consequently, it would be regrettable if con
troversy developed in connection with their gen
erosity which, although restrictive in terms, was
motivated by lovp . . ." 1 am as sentimpntal as
anyone, but I think that once the question has
been breached there is no reason to be put off
with an unsatisfactory answer from the admin
istration. Since the decision of Brown v. Topeka,
equal rights in education has become the sort of
is-me on Which individuals and institutions must
prove their own stature by taking a firm stand.
The University's policy, according to Mr. Glov
er, is to accept scholarships with racial restric
tions if they are "preferential" rather than "ex
clusive." But the Munroe scholarship does not
even fit this classification, for while it is prefer
ential to juniors, seniors, Dekes, and graduates
of the Flintridge School, the white-man-only pro
viso is mandatory. It is apparently not the pol
icy of the University to return or renegotiate
such scholarships.
1 think that the University's policy is flagrant
ly wrong in principle. The distinction drawn be
tween exclusive and preferential discrimination
is semantic deception. The real distinction is
between discrimination and equality. Discrimi
nation has many forms, two of which are ex
clusivp and preferpntial restriction, if Mr. Glov
er and the Board of Trustpes arp going to sug
gest that prefprpnep is compatible with equality,
they are going to have to accept thp prpcppt of
the dictatorial pigs on Orwell's Animal Farm:
all races are equal, but some are more equal
than others.
In mentioning that there are also scholarships
for Negroes and Asians, Mr. Glover has made
no distinction between the practice of discrimi
nation and the efforts of some scholarship do
nors to combat it. There are clearly recognizable
privileged and underprivileged groups. The Ne
gro and Asian peoples are, in regard to educa
tion, underprivileged, and it is wrong to classify
assistance to them as discriminatory in thp spnsp
of the Munroe scholarship, which perpetuates
the same inequality that they fight.
Finally I suggest lhat there is no validity in
the argument that by consulting other privately
endowed schools, it was found that "only one
of the six with which we discussed this problem
follows so clear a non-discriminatory policy as
the one recently adopted by Stanford's Board
of Trustees." Obviously, this finding puts us no
where near the top among universities in gen
era), for all public institutions are barred by law
Irom practicing discrimination.
It is not reassuring to be second of six, for this
is not an issue that can be treated relatively. It
is a question of principle, literally of black and
white, on which the University must prove its
stature. It was disappointing to read Mr. Glover's
letter, for I hoped, and still hope, that Mr. Horo
witzes letter would be taken not as a statement
1o be debated, but as one to be acted upon. If
Hie administration is worried about the sensitivi
ties of the Munroe family, T suggest that it send
a polite letter suggesting that the terms of the
scholarship be changed so that the University
can continue to administer it. And when the
trustees meet again, they ought to reconsider
whether preferential treatment is the same as
equality. In the meantime, I think it is the obli
gation of Flintridge grads, Dekes and Cauca

goes without a recipient.

We have said that the women of this Univer
sity are either irresponsible and childish, or too
dumb to know when their own rights to matu
lity are being withheld. We would now like to
expand this by examples drawn from the rules,
iegulations, and customs of the dictatorships
of the women by the women.
In a women's living group on this campus a
woman may be fined five dollars ($5.00) for an
unexcused absence from house meeting. Typi
cally she might miss the following thrill-packed
agenda: (1) What coldr shall our new drapes

be? (2) Shall wp have a potted plant in the
lobby? (3) Shall wp havp a spread for break
fast next Saturday? (4) What shall we do about
people missing house meptings? (5) How shall
our social regulations be revised? (6) The re
port of (he Commlttep Studying 1 hp Necessity of
Bath Mats in the Johns (majority and minority
reports with dissents).
It is not surprising that this type of agenda
necessitates a five-dollar fine to enforce attend
ance. It is incredible though that anyone who is
not interested should be asked to listen. For
those fpw things which honestly merit attpntion,
further punishments arp imposed for ignorance
of established policy. The social regulations arp
a casp in point. EvidPntly, thp women fed them
selvps so stupid as to nped double pimishment
for prror.
If a woman losps hpr key, she is fined ten dol
lars ($10.00) to have all (lip locks changpd and
upw kpys. Ypt until lock up time thp dormitories
are wide open, and after it a sex fiend has only
to enter any of hundreds»of open windows. Dis
cretion is worthy, but spinsterish fears and use
less precautions are asinine when pushed to ri
diculous limits. We tremble to think of a sex
fiend roaming the campus trying an unmarked
key in door after door, night after night, until
at last he enters Stern, or Temporary Building
A, or Wilbur, or thp Rat Labs, or maybe pvpu
Florpncp Moore, successful and so old he has
not thp strpngth to climb the stairs.
Wp would likp to ask what rpal good a limit

What is so good about this system? What is
thp point to all those major and minor restric
tions on freedom? We accuse the system and
the people who run and submit to it of being
arbitrarily dictatorial and totalitarian. We ac
cuse the system of being an insult to the matu
rity and responsibility of all Stanford "women."
Those who defend it should bo crushed to death

Mr. Frederic Glover, assistant 1o President
Sterling, made some interesting observations in
yesterday's Daily. He very bluntly outlined the
University's policies as to scholarships with re
strictive provisions and real estate investment.
It is curious lhat the University, by its Board
of Trustees, has decided to accept gifts which
have restrictive racial provisions but to reject
ihose with religious stipulations.
This dichotomy is hard to explain, on a ra
tional basis .But Ihen, discrimination, whethpr
by individuals or a University, is seldom on a
rational basis.
In addition, Mr. Glover, in explaining why
the University has declined to comply with the
NAACP's request for insertion of non-discrimi
natory clauses in sub-leases, quoted President
Sterling as saying that this "would divert the
University's attention and energips from its edu
cational tasks." Are we lo conclude from this
lhat the entirp purposo of a University is to
Pdueate only its students? Does the University
feel that showing positive leadprship in a com
munity on a pressing social issue is of a non
educational, nature? Perhaps it all deppnds on
how one defines "educational."
President Sterling also made thp statement
that thp NAACP's rpqupst would involvp respon
sibilities lhat are "essentially governmental in
nature and not reasonably related to the produc
tion ol incomc . . But it may bp qupstionpd
how a Univprsity can blithely abdicate all re
sponsibility in a community with an explana
tion which amounts to saying "it just doesn't
pay."
Possibly the Board of Trustees, in its quest
for secured income, is willing, as an institution,
to do those things which, individually, might
prove embarrassing. •

Mr. Frederic Glover has cautioned us that we

anyone, but I think that once the question has
been breached there is no reason to be put off
with an unsatisfactory answer from the admin

equal rights in education has become the sort of
is-me on Which individuals and institutions must
prove their own stature by taking a firm stand.
The University's policy, according to Mr. Glov

tions if they are "preferential" rather than "ex

even fit this classification, for while it is prefer
ential to juniors, seniors, Dekes, and graduates
of the Flintridge School, the white-man-only pro
viso is mandatory. It is apparently not the pol
icy of the University to return or renegotiate
such scholarships.
1 think that the University's policy is flagrant
ly wrong in principle. The distinction drawn be
tween exclusive and preferential discrimination
is semantic deception. The real distinction is
between discrimination and equality. Discrimi
nation has many forms, two of which are ex
clusivp and preferpntial restriction, if Mr. Glov

they are going to have to accept thp prpcppt of
the dictatorial pigs on Orwell's Animal Farm:
all races are equal, but some are more equal
than others.
In mentioning that there are also scholarships
for Negroes and Asians, Mr. Glover has made
no distinction between the practice of discrimi
nation and the efforts of some scholarship do

privileged and underprivileged groups. The Ne
gro and Asian peoples are, in regard to educa
tion, underprivileged, and it is wrong to classify
assistance to them as discriminatory in thp spnsp
of the Munroe scholarship, which perpetuates
the same inequality that they fight.
Finally I suggest lhat there is no validity in
the argument that by consulting other privately
endowed schools, it was found that "only one
of the six with which we discussed this problem
follows so clear a non-discriminatory policy as
the one recently adopted by Stanford's Board
of Trustees." Obviously, this finding puts us no
where near the top among universities in gen
era), for all public institutions are barred by law
Irom practicing discrimination.
It is not reassuring to be second of six, for this

is a question of principle, literally of black and

Mr. Frederic Glover has cautioned us that we
ought to be silent on thp issups raispd by Mr.
and Mrs. Edward Munrop's discriminatory gen
erosity. "The Munroes are still living," he says,
and consequently, it would be regrettable if con
troversy developed in connection with their gen
erosity which, although restrictive in terms, was
motivated by lovp . . ." 1 am as sentimpntal as
anyone, but I think that once the question has
been breached there is no reason to be put off
with an unsatisfactory answer from the admin
istration. Since the decision of Brown v. Topeka,
equal rights in education has become the sort of
is-me on Which individuals and institutions must
prove their own stature by taking a firm stand.
The University's policy, according to Mr. Glov
er, is to accept scholarships with racial restric
tions if they are "preferential" rather than "ex
clusive." But the Munroe scholarship does not
even fit this classification, for while it is prefer
ential to juniors, seniors, Dekes, and graduates
of the Flintridge School, the white-man-only pro
viso is mandatory. It is apparently not the pol
icy of the University to return or renegotiate
such scholarships.
1 think that the University's policy is flagrant
ly wrong in principle. The distinction drawn be
tween exclusive and preferential discrimination
is semantic deception. The real distinction is
between discrimination and equality. Discrimi
nation has many forms, two of which are ex
clusivp and preferpntial restriction, if Mr. Glov
er and the Board of Trustpes arp going to sug
gest that prefprpnep is compatible with equality,
they are going to have to accept thp prpcppt of
the dictatorial pigs on Orwell's Animal Farm:
all races are equal, but some are more equal
than others.
In mentioning that there are also scholarships
for Negroes and Asians, Mr. Glover has made
no distinction between the practice of discrimi
nation and the efforts of some scholarship do
nors to combat it. There are clearly recognizable
privileged and underprivileged groups. The Ne
gro and Asian peoples are, in regard to educa
tion, underprivileged, and it is wrong to classify
assistance to them as discriminatory in thp spnsp
of the Munroe scholarship, which perpetuates
the same inequality that they fight.
Finally I suggest lhat there is no validity in
the argument that by consulting other privately
endowed schools, it was found that "only one
of the six with which we discussed this problem
follows so clear a non-discriminatory policy as
the one recently adopted by Stanford's Board
of Trustees." Obviously, this finding puts us no
where near the top among universities in gen
era), for all public institutions are barred by law
Irom practicing discrimination.
It is not reassuring to be second of six, for this
is not an issue that can be treated relatively. It
is a question of principle, literally of black and
white, on which the University must prove its
stature. It was disappointing to read Mr. Glover's
letter, for I hoped, and still hope, that Mr. Horo
witzes letter would be taken not as a statement
1o be debated, but as one to be acted upon. If
Hie administration is worried about the sensitivi
ties of the Munroe family, T suggest that it send
a polite letter suggesting that the terms of the
scholarship be changed so that the University
can continue to administer it. And when the
trustees meet again, they ought to reconsider
whether preferential treatment is the same as
equality. In the meantime, I think it is the obli

Flagrantly Wrong in Principle
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Frederic Glover has cautioned us that we
ought to be silent on thp issups raispd by Mr.
and Mrs. Edward Munrop's discriminatory gen
erosity. "The Munroes are still living," he says,
and consequently, it would be regrettable if con
troversy developed in connection with their gen
erosity which, although restrictive in terms, was
motivated by lovp . . ." 1 am as sentimpntal as
anyone, but I think that once the question has
been breached there is no reason to be put off
with an unsatisfactory answer from the admin
istration. Since the decision of Brown v. Topeka,
equal rights in education has become the sort of
is-me on Which individuals and institutions must
prove their own stature by taking a firm stand.
The University's policy, according to Mr. Glov
er, is to accept scholarships with racial restric
tions if they are "preferential" rather than "ex
clusive." But the Munroe scholarship does not
even fit this classification, for while it is prefer
ential to juniors, seniors, Dekes, and graduates
of the Flintridge School, the white-man-only pro
viso is mandatory. It is apparently not the pol
icy of the University to return or renegotiate
such scholarships.
1 think that the University's policy is flagrant
ly wrong in principle. The distinction drawn be
tween exclusive and preferential discrimination
is semantic deception. The real distinction is
between discrimination and equality. Discrimi
nation has many forms, two of which are ex
clusivp and preferpntial restriction, if Mr. Glov
er and the Board of Trustpes arp going to sug
gest that prefprpnep is compatible with equality,
they are going to have to accept thp prpcppt of
the dictatorial pigs on Orwell's Animal Farm:
all races are equal, but some are more equal
than others.
In mentioning that there are also scholarships
for Negroes and Asians, Mr. Glover has made
no distinction between the practice of discrimi
nation and the efforts of some scholarship do
nors to combat it. There are clearly recognizable
privileged and underprivileged groups. The Ne
gro and Asian peoples are, in regard to educa
tion, underprivileged, and it is wrong to classify
assistance to them as discriminatory in thp spnsp
of the Munroe scholarship, which perpetuates
the same inequality that they fight.
Finally I suggest lhat there is no validity in
the argument that by consulting other privately
endowed schools, it was found that "only one
of the six with which we discussed this problem
follows so clear a non-discriminatory policy as
the one recently adopted by Stanford's Board
of Trustees." Obviously, this finding puts us no
where near the top among universities in gen
era), for all public institutions are barred by law
Irom practicing discrimination.
It is not reassuring to be second of six, for this
is not an issue that can be treated relatively. It
is a question of principle, literally of black and
white, on which the University must prove its
stature. It was disappointing to read Mr. Glover's
letter, for I hoped, and still hope, that Mr. Horo
witzes letter would be taken not as a statement
1o be debated, but as one to be acted upon. If
Hie administration is worried about the sensitivi
ties of the Munroe family, T suggest that it send
a polite letter suggesting that the terms of the
scholarship be changed so that the University
can continue to administer it. And when the
trustees meet again, they ought to reconsider
whether preferential treatment is the same as
equality. In the meantime, I think it is the obli
gation of Flintridge grads, Dekes and Cauca
sians alike to see that the Munroe scholarship
goes without a recipient.

Bath Mats in the Johns
Editor, The Daily:
We have said that the women of this Univer
sity are either irresponsible and childish, or too
dumb to know when their own rights to matu
lity are being withheld. We would now like to
expand this by examples drawn from the rules,
iegulations, and customs of the dictatorships
of the women by the women.
In a women's living group on this campus a
woman may be fined five dollars ($5.00) for an
unexcused absence from house meeting. Typi
cally she might miss the following thrill-packed
agenda: (1) What coldr shall our new drapes

be? (2) Shall wp have a potted plant in the
lobby? (3) Shall wp havp a spread for break
fast next Saturday? (4) What shall we do about
people missing house meptings? (5) How shall
our social regulations be revised? (6) The re
port of (he Commlttep Studying 1 hp Necessity of
Bath Mats in the Johns (majority and minority
reports with dissents).
It is not surprising that this type of agenda
necessitates a five-dollar fine to enforce attend
ance. It is incredible though that anyone who is
not interested should be asked to listen. For
those fpw things which honestly merit attpntion,
further punishments arp imposed for ignorance
of established policy. The social regulations arp
a casp in point. EvidPntly, thp women fed them
selvps so stupid as to nped double pimishment
for prror.
If a woman losps hpr key, she is fined ten dol
lars ($10.00) to have all (lip locks changpd and
upw kpys. Ypt until lock up time thp dormitories
are wide open, and after it a sex fiend has only
to enter any of hundreds»of open windows. Dis
cretion is worthy, but spinsterish fears and use
less precautions are asinine when pushed to ri
diculous limits. We tremble to think of a sex
fiend roaming the campus trying an unmarked
key in door after door, night after night, until
at last he enters Stern, or Temporary Building
A, or Wilbur, or thp Rat Labs, or maybe pvpu
Florpncp Moore, successful and so old he has
not thp strpngth to climb the stairs.
Wp would likp to ask what rpal good a limit
of two-thirty does in protecting a git] from
danger. This appears to assume that at two
thirty the wheels begin to turn with frightening
efficiency. It also appears to assume that all
girls are attacked or involved in accidents about
five minutps bpforp closing. This appeal's to as
sume lhat beginning the hunt will really do
some good. To these automatic assumptions we
must dissent.
What is so good about this system? What is
thp point to all those major and minor restric
tions on freedom? We accuse the system and
the people who run and submit to it of being
arbitrarily dictatorial and totalitarian. We ac
cuse the system of being an insult to the matu
rity and responsibility of all Stanford "women."
Those who defend it should bo crushed to death
with cotton candy.

Discrimination Seldom Rational
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Frederic Glover, assistant 1o President
Sterling, made some interesting observations in
yesterday's Daily. He very bluntly outlined the
University's policies as to scholarships with re
strictive provisions and real estate investment.
It is curious lhat the University, by its Board
of Trustees, has decided to accept gifts which
have restrictive racial provisions but to reject
ihose with religious stipulations.
This dichotomy is hard to explain, on a ra
tional basis .But Ihen, discrimination, whethpr
by individuals or a University, is seldom on a
rational basis.
In addition, Mr. Glover, in explaining why
the University has declined to comply with the
NAACP's request for insertion of non-discrimi
natory clauses in sub-leases, quoted President
Sterling as saying that this "would divert the
University's attention and energips from its edu
cational tasks." Are we lo conclude from this
lhat the entirp purposo of a University is to
Pdueate only its students? Does the University
feel that showing positive leadprship in a com
munity on a pressing social issue is of a non
educational, nature? Perhaps it all deppnds on
how one defines "educational."
President Sterling also made thp statement
that thp NAACP's rpqupst would involvp respon
sibilities lhat are "essentially governmental in
nature and not reasonably related to the produc
tion ol incomc . . But it may bp qupstionpd
how a Univprsity can blithely abdicate all re
sponsibility in a community with an explana
tion which amounts to saying "it just doesn't
pay."
Possibly the Board of Trustees, in its quest
for secured income, is willing, as an institution,
to do those things which, individually, might
prove embarrassing. •
