## Women Talk on Compulsory House Meetings 
### John Lane 
In the past two weeks much controversy has
arisen over the merits of women's compulsory
house meetings. The main argument against
them is that the women are being forced to dis
cuss trivial detail.
Seventeen women have had this to say to The
Daily as to their opinions on the subject:
SALLY HANSCOM, '(JO, Brainier: "I don't think
they're necessary. They could just post an
nouncements on the bulletin boarrn People who
have to go because they're compulsory just sit
in the meetings and don't say anything anyway."
ANN SHFRKR, '<>0, Ruble: "I think they're all
right. There's no other way anyone can know
what's going on. The Daily couldn't possibly
carry all the little things, so the meetings are
needed."
JUDY PEDEN, '59, 'Luffiinlta: "The main
thing wrong is that they bring up trivial de
tails in the meetings. These just take up time.
There should he a few compulsory meetings, but
not every week."
YVONNE OLSON, '00, Union: "Compulsory
meetings are necessary, but they can be short
ened if ;i realistic view is taken of what directly
concerns the entire group. If the extraneous
stuff is cut out they will be more liked."
HELEN HAMILTON, '00, Roble: "More could
be accomplished with a smaller group than they
have in tfie house meetings. The meetings are
too long. It's too much to have both compulsory
corridor and house meetings."
ALIC'E OEARY, '57, Florence Moore: "1 feel
they're necessary, but some of the informnlion
could be gotten some other way.
lUDITH DAVIS, '58, Off ■Campus: "1 was a
Roble sponsor, and I'm not in favor of compul
sory regulations of any kind that includes
house meetings and social regulations. They
don't do anything to develop a sense of social
responsibility. I think everyone should be given
enough rope to hang herself, if she wants to!"
BARBARA RHOADES, 00, Roble: "I think

they stink. It's too hard to hear everything in a
large meeting, and besides there isn't enough
ventilation. The same thing that is done in the
large meeting could be done in a small one."
HELEN HAWTHORNE, '00. Brainier: "I think
they're thoroughly worth while. I've never en
joyed anything so much in my life.
JO ANN DAVIS, (»ra<iuate, Off - Campus:
"They're necessary. The things they cover are
of general concern. Having compulsory meet
ings is the only way to be sure everyone's in
formed. Individualism is fine, but in group liv
ing, there is a certain amount of group respon
sibility."
•IOAN OLSON, T)8, Florence Moore: "Compul
sory meetings are OK, because yon have to get
the information somehow and it's only for
half-hour once a week. It's the only meeting lots
of the girls have. No one would go to the meet
ings if they weren't compulsory anyway."
MARILYN JOIIANSFN, '59, Lagltnita: "I
wish the meetings were better organized, with
out the nebulous questions they sometimes have
that don't pertain to much of anything. Rut I'm
not against the meetings."
SHERRY VAIXiHAN, '00, Branner: "The
meetings 'are a pretty good idea. You can gel
a better idea that way of what's going on."
SIIEILA DIXIT, '00, Off-Campus: "It's Hie
only way to get people to come there. We do get
enough out of them to make them worth while."
PORTIA HEAPS, '00, Roble: "They pass out
printed sheets at the meetings anyway. Why do
they have to take up all that time explaining it?"
COLLIE YAP, '59, l.agunita: "It's our right
to have meetings, and they ought to do some
thing with the way they're run now. They ought
to ask if there's any business from the floor, or
at least do something to show us it's our meet
ing. Now it looks like an excom meeting.
PEGGY MI'MBY, '00, Roble: "Everything they
do in those big meetings could be accomplished
in smaller meetings."
