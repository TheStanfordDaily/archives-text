# HISTORY OF STANFORD CREW
## Rowing on Farm Started Way Back in '03 
### Stewart, Sports Editor 
Editor's Note: Saturday morning Stanford's
undefeated varsity crew races the powerful
Washington Huskies at the Redwood City Yacht
Ilarhor. The following is the first of a two-part
article about the history of Stanford's seini-or
plian crew. We feel the story is important for it
shows' how an amateur group of athletes can
compete against the big-time college profession
als and still he successful.
Crew was started at Stanford the first time in
1903 under the leadership of A. W. Smith, a pro
fessor in the engineering department, who came
to Stanford from Cornell University which has
always had outstanding crews.
During the next 17 years Stanford put some out
standing crews on the water. In 1912 the Indians
defeated Washington and California to become
Pacific Coast champions and entered the Pough
keepsie Regatta, thus becoming the first West
Coast crew to compete in that famous rowing
classic.
The Cards finished last in a field of six but
Ihey returned in 1915 to shock the Eastern rowing
powers by finishing a close second to a great Cor
nell crew. Stanford used the then unorthodox
sculling stroke which has since revolutionized the
art of rowing.
However, Stanford dropped Ihe sport in 1921 and
did not renew it until 1939. This brief "rebirth"
was made possible through help and advice from
California coach Ky Ebright and Washington's A 1
I Hhricksen.
Kach university gave Stanford a practice shell.
Present Card coach Lou Lindsey had been a cox
swain in the Cal donation, named the "Whisky,"
when he was an undergrad ;it Berkeley in 1910.
Willi this encouragement a group of interested

Stanford students managed to build a boathouse
and a training barge. The wood for the practice
barge was "donated" by Ham's Head, so the leg
end goes.
Memorial Auditorium had just been completed
and Ram's Head had a large amount of lumber on
hand which they planned to use for stage sets.
One evening, quite the crew politely relieved
(he dramatic group of some of its excess plywood.
With this midnight grant the oarsmen built a
sturdy training barge in which they used to prac
tice on Lake Lag. Their labors were so good, in
fact, that the barge is still in use today. *
This light-fingered group succeeded in holding
races with Oregon State. UCLA and California in
1941 and 1942. In 1943, however, World War II
brought an end to their crew activities.
In 1946 business school student Stan Cumber
patch, who had rowed for Navy as a frosh in '43,
revived crew on the Farm for the third time. The
boathouse at the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor was re
paired and the cobwebs were scraped off the
shells.
Lindsey was in his first year of business school
at the time. Since he had coxswain experience lie
"consented to cox for the new group just until
someone else could gain enough experience to
take over."
"Just for the heck of it"the cocky Indian row
ers decided to challenge Cal for an out-of-season
race. A short 1000-meter regatta was helrl on
the Oakland Estuary on the morning of the '4(5
Big Game.
To the amazement of both schools the upstart
Indians won the race. The result rated ;i full
