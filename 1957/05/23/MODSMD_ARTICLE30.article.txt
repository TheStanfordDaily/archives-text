# Hostel Idea Formed 18 Months Ago by Students, Professors
## Program Adopted by Cardinals Last Spring Quarter; Six Held This Year 
### 
Neatly 18 months ago George Abel. Werner Warmbrunn, Eric
Millar, Geoff Newcomb and a group of professors discussed pos
sible remedies for the intellectual stagnation enveloping the student
body. From this discussion came the present hostel concept particu
larly adapted to the philosophy of Stanford which stresses "critical

thinking in a casual atmosphere."
The hostel program aims to pro
vide a relaxing, yet stimulating,
setting for critical discussions of
topics of general interest, to fur
ther student-faculty relations, to
encourage the understanding' of
foreign countries through direct
association with foreign students
and to give students a chance to
relax and enjoy a weekend away
from the pressures of campus life.
The Cardinals officially adopted
the hostel as a budget-supported
all-campus activity after a suc
cessful lest period 1a s t spring
quarter. They conducted six hos
tels this spring, in which 50 stu
dents participated. Both faculty
and Administration have widely
accepted and encouraged it.
The Hostel Planning Committee
is responsible for administration
of the hostel program. Following
are the positions on the commit
tee: business manager, head of
publicity, food planner, secretary
and committee chairman.
The work of the Hostel Plan
ning Committee is new and un
precedented, making it possible
for each year's committee io ex
periment freely.
