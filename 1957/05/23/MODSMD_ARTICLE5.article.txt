# Cal Professor Gives Lecture On American Painting Today
## Wessels Calls Present Art Scene Turbulent With Emphasis on Style and Translation 
### 
Professor Glen Wessels of the University of California yesterday
gave the final lecture of the American painting series, "American
Painting Today."
He explained that, because art is one of Ihe few areas left in our
individualistic culture where freedom is acceptable, the present

American art scene is a turbulent
one. For the individual artist, art
has become a personal magnified
reaction with an emphasis on
style and idiomatic translation.
He said it is the duty of the
modern art lover and collector to
encourage original and worth
while art by buying those pictures
he likes, not brand names. Such
an attitude would serve to broad
en knowledge of critical standards
and give the young artist a chance
to appeal to the public taste rather
than the dealer or the museum
director.
Several "Isms"
Modern art, he explained, in
cludes several "isms," each repre
senting an emphasis on a certain
facet of reality. Its purpose is to
offer the viewer a chance for fun
and the satisfaction of a fresh
vision.
With the aid of slides he de
fined some of these "isms." Mo
net's impressionism, or the em
phasis of light on form, manifests
itself in modern times in the ab
straction of Black and the move
ment of Morris.
Cubism in Arl
Cubism is the portrayal of life
in terms of the cube or cone. A
1955 painting of Hulkberg stress
ing deep, flat space and the 21) of
Cankell with its horizontal and
vertical line patterns are modern
variations.
Wessels said thai, although
most recent art is basically still
abstraction with an emphasis on
dynamic energy or mysticism,
there is a new trend forward to
nature and recognizable forms. It
is a painting thai will not involve
a specific place but the universal
qualities of that place.
