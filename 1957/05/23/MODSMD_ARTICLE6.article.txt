# State Official Says Water Resources Are Inadequate
## 
### 
State Department of Water Re
sources director Harvey Banks
yesterday reflected tliat "in the
history of water development
throughout the world you never
quite catch up."
Delivering a .speech sponsored
by the Political Union and the
American Society for Civil Engi
neers, Ranks spoke before 315 peo
ple (and one dog) in Bowman
Alumni House.
Me said a case in point for his
"never catch up" assumption is
the $12 $13 billion "needed to solve
the water problem of California."
Causing the expanding problem
are increased use of water, taking
more baths and growth of popu
lation. "We envision a state with
a population of 40 million," Banks
said.
When he asked the rhetorical
question of "where we're going to
put them all, I don't know," a de
termined voice from the audience
intoned. "Put them up north."
At the root of legislative diffi
culties, he said, is distribution of
demand and supply. Two-thirds of
the water is north of Sacramento
and 70 per cent of the demand is
south of the capital.
