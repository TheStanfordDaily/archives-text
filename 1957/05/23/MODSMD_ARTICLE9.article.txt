# WINDOW CRACKED
## Two Blasts Damage Home Of Professor 
### 
Two explosions of undetermined
cause and location cracked a win
dow in Classics professor (emeri
tus) Raymond Harriman's house
yesterday morning at 12:15 a.m.
They were the second such ex
plosions in that area of the cam
pus in two weeks.
Harriman lives at 611 Alvarado
St. Police chief Gordon Davis
said, "It seerns that students are
experimenting with some kind of
noise-producing device."
No physical evidence exists as
lo the type or as to the exact lo
cation of the explosions. Mem
bers of the Phi Gamma Delta fra
ternity told police they thought
the explosions occurred on the
field between Alvarado St.and
Wilbur Hall.
Itiasls Located
The Phi Gamma Delta house is
located on the corner of Alvarado
and Santa Yno/Sis. Alpha Kappa
Lambda fraternity men placed
location of I lie blasts near their
house. The AKL house is on Sal
vations St. between Arguello and
Santa Yno/..
Davis said the police depart
ment may place a "stake out" in
the general area of the explosions.
"Somebody is likely to get hurt,"
the police chief said, "as seen by
the fact that a window was
cracked."
Student Information
Students having information
leading to apprehension of the
"blasters" should report to the
police department, Davis said. He
said a similar nocturnal explo
sion happened in the Alvarado St.
area "last Thursday or Friday."
According to Davis, a Stanford
officer was in the vicinity when
the blasts occurred. He said a
chemistry student may have con
cocted the explosions. It is doubt
ful thai a commercial explosive
was used, Davis said.
The blasts awakened residents
in Palo Alto and College Terrace.
