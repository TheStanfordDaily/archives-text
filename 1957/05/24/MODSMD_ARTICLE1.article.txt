# Students Present 17th Annual Spring Sing Tonight
## LIGHTING DIFFICULTIES 'Baby Doe' Opening Is Well Received in Dinkelspiel Hall 
### Camille Petersen 
A well-deserved ovation accompanied the final curtain on the West
Coast premiere of "The Ballad of Baby Doe," in the new Dinkelspiel
Memorial Auditorium last night.
The pacing of the entire'production is smooth and notes and voices
are clear throughout the auditorium. The leading stars, Leyna Ga-

briele and Stanley Noonan, con
vey their parts with strength and
conviction.
The lighting is the only faulty
part of the play. The technical
staff was working under great
difficulty, however, because the
complete lighting system only ar
rived Monday and adequate time
has not been available for test
ing.
In one aria and the removal of
a scarf, composer Douglas Moore
has effectively transversed 36
years within five minutes. The
technically moving scene is en
hanced by the portrayal given by
Miss Gabriele and Noonan.
Between the scow and the per
formance given by the cast, the
barrier of prejudice against op
era being given in English has
been broken. On leaving the the
ater one feels that he has truly
been to a great American opera.
The acoustics in the new au
ditorium make it possible for the
singers to lessen their volume
and still be heard above the
strains issuing from the pit.
Quality of tone does not change
as one moves about the audito
rium.
Poker Scene
JVoonan builds the tension in
the poker scene to its complete
dramatic height.
The three guest stars—Doro
thy Ledger, Miss Gabriele and
Noonan obtain the audience's
admiration in their opening
scones and hold it throughout the
performance.
Miss Lodger possibly gives her
best work in Act 11, Scene 4, in
which Baby's mother, .loan Sten
son, appeals to her to help Hor
aco Tabor in his financial diffi
culty.
Scenes begin with catchy mu
sic from the orchestra, and
throughout the production more
beautiful orchestrations appear.
Cast. Spectates
The chorus, especially in the
wedding scene, makes an obvi
ous point of turning to watch or
chestra conductor Sandor Salgo
and then making a mass turn
back toward those to whom they
were supposedly singing. This
overly obvious attention is also
noticeable in some of the soloists.
Joan Stensen as Mama Mc-
Court, Baby Doe's mother, and
James Standard as William Jen
nings Bryan are both convincing
characters in their supporting
roles.
Colorful costumes bedeck the
dance hall girls and the chorus in
mass scenes.
Expert production design and
staging have boon done by Ar«h
; and Alice Lauterer.
