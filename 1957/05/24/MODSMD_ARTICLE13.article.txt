There is no unifying force in
roJigion in the United States to
day, professor Edmund Volkart
of Sociology noted yesterday dur
ing his "Y" Lunch Club talk.
Volkart said that in other coun
tries religious beliefs are a rally
ing point on which the people can
agree. But here, he said, differ
ences arising from religious be
liefs divide us and even lead to
court battles.
Me also wondered whether we
lose track of the real values of
religion after they have been
worked over by Bishop Fulton
Sheen, Billy Graham and Norman
Vincent Peale. He quoted an East
Coast minister who said, "I've
been having some negative
thou g h t s about the positive
thoughts of Dr. Norman Vincent
Peale."
