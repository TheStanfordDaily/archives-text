The singing groups are to en
ter on either side of the stage

forming, the next will form off
stage. Swinth asks that the

the tape markers, which are ar
rahged in arcs of six, nine and
12 feet, instead of in the usual
straight line so that the loud
speaker will pick up all the
voices.

Swinth also warned that par
ticipants will be penalized three
points for every 30 seconds over
time.
The Men's Glee Club, which
will perform during intermis
sion, will sing "I'm Going to Ride
the Chariot," "The Animals Are
Coming" and a medley of college
songs.
Recordings of Spring Sing may
be obtained through KZSU. The
station will rebroadcast the sing
during the Decennial Celebra
