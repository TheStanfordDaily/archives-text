of the San Mateo County Hall of

Dennis Woodman, counsel for
Rutherdale, and Joseph Lewis,
counsel for Hawkins, petitioned
earlier this week for delay of the
trial. Woodman charged that the
judge erred in requiring a plea.

grounds that he had insufficient:
time to prepare his case.

prosecution, that the defense
would have to agree first that
the trial be held before Stanford
students, the prosecution's wit
nesses, left for vacation.
The defense refused, and trial
date was set for May 27. Then
the two defense attorneys en
tered the new petition. As a re
sult of the recent Appellate
Court ruling, the trial will now
take place as scheduled.
Woodman told The Daily he
does not think that defense will
ask for any further delay. Assist
ant District Attorney Allison
Rouse said he expected the trial
to last about a week, with jury
selection and opening statements
to take place Monday.
Louis Marks, another attacker
who will go on trial Monday, was
arrested again Wednesday night
on charges of disturbing the
peace, vagrancy and resisting ar
rest.
