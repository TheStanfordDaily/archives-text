# No Restrictive Scholarships
## 
### 
Fivf. scholarships at Stanford contain some
kind of racial requirement. On the basis of
this fact the University's policy on racial dis
crimination has lately been challenged.
In February of this year the Board of Trus
tees stated that, from then on, the University
would accept no scholarship hearing a restric
tion as to race. According to this policy, the
University would give preference to a particu
lar race if the donor wished it, but would not
be compelled to award the fund to anyone or
keep it from anyone because of race.
If cannot lie denied that the Munroe scholar
ship and the other four explicitly contradict
the University's new policy. The rub is that
all five were accepted before the policy was
adopted.
The question is unsettled whether or not the
University can or cannot legally change the
terms of a scholarship once it has been ac
cepted. The University could negotiate an al
teration in a scholarship, but the question of
legal action hy the state, the mountainous tax
problems and public-relations tangles involved
understandably discourage officials of the IJni
versity from such action.
We do not like to see these five restrictive
scholarships offered at Stanford. As they stand,
they are a smudge on the new policy. We would
like lo see tliem changed to delete the racial

restriction. Ihe M tin roe scholarship discrimi
nates against a minority; the Dernham scholar
ship (for Jewish medical students) discrimi
nates in favor of a minority. We discern no
difference between the two discriminations, so
far its the I fniversity's policy is concerned. The
policy says there should he no racial discrimi
nation, whether it he in favor of the majority
or the minority.
We favor the insertion of preference clauses
in place of restrictive clauses. The preference
clause states that, in the choice of recipients,
preference will be given to persons of the type
specified hy the terms of the scholarship. If
the University is unable to find anyone fulfill
ing those terms, it is left free to award the
money to someone else.
This policy does not stop University officials
from abusing the right of asserting a prefer
ence. They could permit bias to rule their
choice, or they could conceivably assert no
preference in choosing candidates. But we feel
the new policy is a good one, and, judiciously
administered, it should prove its worth.
No fund has been offered since the new
policy was adopted in February in which the
racial question has arisen. When such an offer
is made, the University will have a real oppor
tunity lo show where il stands. The trustees
have made a declaration of policy. They must
earrv il out.

like lo see tliem changed to delete the racial

restriction. Ihe M tin roe scholarship discrimi
nates against a minority; the Dernham scholar
ship (for Jewish medical students) discrimi
nates in favor of a minority. We discern no
difference between the two discriminations, so
far its the I fniversity's policy is concerned. The
policy says there should he no racial discrimi
nation, whether it he in favor of the majority
or the minority.
We favor the insertion of preference clauses
in place of restrictive clauses. The preference
clause states that, in the choice of recipients,
preference will be given to persons of the type
specified hy the terms of the scholarship. If
the University is unable to find anyone fulfill
ing those terms, it is left free to award the
money to someone else.
This policy does not stop University officials
from abusing the right of asserting a prefer
ence. They could permit bias to rule their
choice, or they could conceivably assert no
preference in choosing candidates. But we feel
the new policy is a good one, and, judiciously
administered, it should prove its worth.
No fund has been offered since the new
policy was adopted in February in which the
racial question has arisen. When such an offer
is made, the University will have a real oppor
tunity lo show where il stands. The trustees
have made a declaration of policy. They must
earrv il out.
Fivf. scholarships at Stanford contain some
kind of racial requirement. On the basis of
this fact the University's policy on racial dis
crimination has lately been challenged.
In February of this year the Board of Trus
tees stated that, from then on, the University
would accept no scholarship hearing a restric
tion as to race. According to this policy, the
University would give preference to a particu
lar race if the donor wished it, but would not
be compelled to award the fund to anyone or
keep it from anyone because of race.
If cannot lie denied that the Munroe scholar
ship and the other four explicitly contradict
the University's new policy. The rub is that
all five were accepted before the policy was
adopted.
The question is unsettled whether or not the
University can or cannot legally change the
terms of a scholarship once it has been ac
cepted. The University could negotiate an al
teration in a scholarship, but the question of
legal action hy the state, the mountainous tax
problems and public-relations tangles involved
understandably discourage officials of the IJni
versity from such action.
We do not like to see these five restrictive
