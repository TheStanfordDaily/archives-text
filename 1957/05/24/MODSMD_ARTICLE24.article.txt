Dekes Speak on Scholarship
Editor, The Daily:
A few days ago we read Martin Horowitz's
loiter concerning the Munroe Scholarship. We
hoped that Wednesday's reply from Mr. Fred
eric Glover would settle the issue. Bui since
K. S. Thompson chose to re-open the discussion
and asked members of our fraternity not to
accept the award, we fee] a statement of our atti
tude on this subject is necessary.
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Munroe intended that
Ihe scholarship should go to someone needing
financial help and having similar interests as
thfir son, Dick, who was killed at Guadalcanal.
In order to fulfill this desire, they stated that
ihe recipient be a graduate of Flintridge School
or a Stanford Deke, that he show leadership in
some field such as athlelics, and that he be a
Caucasian. The award is made with the recom
mendation of the Munroe family subject to Uni
versity approval.
The racial issue has always been a problem
in the United States. There are a great many
people strongly in favor of or strongly opposed
to discriminatory practices. The University
would not have accepted the scholarship had it
felt that the Munroes' intention was to prevent
non-whites from receiving the award. Its pur
pose, as stated above, was obvious to them.
There are those who, being strongly opposed

to discrimination, fool it their duty to attack
certain practices on the surface only, without
knowing the true intention. If one were to fol
low their approach fully, he would have to admit
lhat restricting the scholarship to Dekes is even
more discriminatory than limiting il 1o Cauca
sians. It is only because the racial issue is so
prominent that they challenge the one point and
negleel the others. It is interesting to note that
there also exist scholarships for a Negro in Law
School, a Jew in Medical School, a baseball
player, a distance runner and a descendant of
a member of the Stanford chapter of Gamma
Phi Beta sorority, to mention just a few.
Mr. Thompson stated in his letter that by
restricting scholarships to minority groups you
are actually fighting discrimination. However,
according to our understanding of the meaning
of the word, the above would certainly seem to
qualify.
In answer to the request that we see to it that
the scholarship goes without a recipient, may we
say that the Dekes are very grateful to the Mun
roes for both giving us the opportunity for fi
nancial aid and helping to honor the memory
of their son. We are sorry to disappoint you,
K. S. Thompson, but we will do all possible to
see to it that the Dick Munroe Memorial Schol
arship has a recipient next year.
