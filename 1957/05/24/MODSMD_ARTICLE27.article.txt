line survey.)

Stanford has been rated by The Chicago Tribune as having one
of the 10 "most distinguished" mathematics departments in the
United States.
Professor Menahem Schiffer, head of the department, attributes
this honor partly to the number of publications with which members

of the faculty are affiliated. |
Many of the professors are on
editorial boards of the various
mathematics m a g a z i n e s and
pamphlets.
Scholars Included
Also, Schiffer said, well-known
scholars have been in the depart
ment for many years. Included
among them is Professor George
Polya, an emeritus member, who j
taught at Stanford since 1944.
Until that time he taught in
Switzerland at 1he Polytechnic
Institute at Zurich. Professor
Polya has written several books
on how to solve mathematical
problems: "Induction and Anal
ogy in Mathematics," "Patterns
of Plausible Interference" and
"How to Solve It." Also, Profes
sor Polya is one of the 10 corre
sponding members of the French
Academy of Sciences in the
world.
Another world-famous faculty
member is Professor Gabor Sze
go, who was head of the depart
ment until four years ago. He
is well known for his two-volume
book, "Problems and Exercises
in Analysis."
Other Members
Other outstanding members in
clude Professor Gladys Garabe
dian who specializes in problems
of applied mathematics and fluid j
dynamics, Professor Stefan Berg
man who has written several
math books, and Professor
Charles Loewner who has an in
ternational reputation for his
work in mathematics.
Professor Scniller has also 1
written many books and articles.
His field is in the theory of func
tion, differential equations and
calculus of variations.
Schiller said that Professor
Szego has done a great deal to
make the department: so out
standing. When he came to
Stanford, the department includ
ed a great many undeveloped
fields. He decided to concentrate
especially on one phase, analysis,
and since that lime Stanford has
become very well known in 1ha1
field. The department is also j
outstanding in differential equa- |
tions, applied mathemalics and j
theory of function.
A large part of the faculty has
worked on government-sponsored
research projects, 20 to 30 of
which are done each year, Schil
ler said. Also the department
often collaborates with the statis
tics department.
The mathematics department
has one of the largest faculties
at Stanford, made up of 2o mem
hers.

outstanding in differential equa- |
tions, applied mathemalics and j
theory of function.
A large part of the faculty has
worked on government-sponsored
research projects, 20 to 30 of
which are done each year, Schil
ler said. Also the department
often collaborates with the statis
tics department.
The mathematics department

the departments receiving high ratings in :i recent Chicago 'I'rih
line survey.)

Stanford has been rated by The Chicago Tribune as having one
of the 10 "most distinguished" mathematics departments in the
United States.
Professor Menahem Schiffer, head of the department, attributes
this honor partly to the number of publications with which members

of the faculty are affiliated. |
Many of the professors are on
editorial boards of the various
mathematics m a g a z i n e s and
pamphlets.
Scholars Included
Also, Schiffer said, well-known
scholars have been in the depart
ment for many years. Included
among them is Professor George
Polya, an emeritus member, who j
taught at Stanford since 1944.
Until that time he taught in
Switzerland at 1he Polytechnic
Institute at Zurich. Professor
Polya has written several books
on how to solve mathematical
problems: "Induction and Anal
ogy in Mathematics," "Patterns
of Plausible Interference" and
"How to Solve It." Also, Profes
sor Polya is one of the 10 corre
sponding members of the French
Academy of Sciences in the
world.
Another world-famous faculty
member is Professor Gabor Sze
go, who was head of the depart
ment until four years ago. He
is well known for his two-volume
book, "Problems and Exercises
in Analysis."
Other Members
Other outstanding members in
clude Professor Gladys Garabe
dian who specializes in problems
of applied mathematics and fluid j
dynamics, Professor Stefan Berg
man who has written several
math books, and Professor
Charles Loewner who has an in
ternational reputation for his
work in mathematics.
Professor Scniller has also 1
written many books and articles.
His field is in the theory of func
tion, differential equations and
calculus of variations.
Schiller said that Professor
Szego has done a great deal to
make the department: so out
standing. When he came to
Stanford, the department includ
ed a great many undeveloped
fields. He decided to concentrate
especially on one phase, analysis,
and since that lime Stanford has
become very well known in 1ha1
field. The department is also j
