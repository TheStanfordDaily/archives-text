# Crew Rises to Post-War Peak Under Lou Lindsey's Direction
## 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
Editor's Note: This is the
second part of a two-part ar
ticle about the history of Stan
ford's' semi-orphan crew.
After World War 11, crew on
Ihe Farm was successfully re
vived and the rowers pulled off
iheir greatest upset when they
challenged and defeated Cal on
the morning of the '46 Big Game.
The victory was so impressive
that someone anonymously do
nated two new shells to the In
dians.
However, at the end of autumn
quarter in '46, Carl Pederson,
who had been coaching Ihe
Cards, graduated, so Lindsey
took over. Since a new coxswain
had been developed, Lindsey con
fined his crew duties to just
coaching.
Clarke Takes Over
However, during the winter
quarter of 1947 Lindsey had to
drop out of school when he had
a reaction 1o a wound lie received
in combat during the war.
Commander A. A. CAce) j
Clarke, an NROTC instructor
ihen stationed at Stanford, took
up the crew coaching duties. He
had been an oarsman at the Na
val Academy.
When Clarke left in 1950, Jim
Beggs, who had been working i
with the frosh, moved up and
coached the varsity two years.
.Jim Fifer, an oarsman from the
class of '52, took over when
Beggs left and coached for a year
before he went into the Navy, j
Dave Dravs followed Fifer and i
coached for a year before he left, j
and then Lindsey look over.
After their quick start in '46,
crew at Stanford grew steadily.
Tn 1949 the Indians received an
invitation to row in the famous
Poughkeepsie Regatta at Mari
etta, New York. The Cards fin
ished 10th in a field of 12.
Record Improves
In 1950 the Cards finished a
contested third and were runner
up to California in the 1952 and
1953 Western Sprint Champion
ships at Newport Beach. These
triumphs were won in the face of
continuing financial hardships as
the Stanford crew was a" com
pletely self-supporting organiza
tion at that time.
By 1954, rowing conditions at
ihe Palo Alto harbor were so bad
that the crew decided to forego

entering the Nationals which had
moved to Syracuse, New York,
aYid build a boat house at Red
wood City where a protected
channel offered calm water for
afternoon practices.
New Boat house
The oarsmen hesitatingly ap
proached city officials, alumni,
friends and businessmen with
their plan, and found them eager
to lend a hand. At a cost of $6000
and with their own labor, the
oarsmen built a modern shell
house, complete with showers,
storage and work space.
Lindsey, in the meantime, had
recovered. lie returned to Busi
ness School and obtained his
M.B.A. After graduation he got
a job with a San Francisco in
vestment firm and seemed to be
resigned to going through life in
a gray flannel suit.
Lindsey Returns
Tn 1954 he was merely an in
terested spectator at Ihe Oak
land Estuary when Cal humiliat
ed the unconditioned Indian oars
men by finishing 12 FULL
LENGTHS ahead of the Cards.
After the race Indian captain
Dan Ayrault and co - captain
Rowd Davis cornered Lindsey.
The two captains poured cokes
down Lindsey and showed him
plans for a new boat house to be
built at Redwood City Yacht Har
bor and alter setting him up for
the kill asked him to be their
coach.
Lindsey accepted. He had to.
Crew had a hold on Lindsey and
it has possessed him. He tried to
get away several times in ihe
past but now he is happily re
signed to his fate.
Beat Cal Twice
Tn 1955 Lindsey whipped Ihe
Cards into an outstanding crew.
The Indians shocked the rowing
world by defeating California
and Washington for the first
lime since 1917 in the Western
Sprint Championships. One week
later they proved it was no fluke
by dunking the Bears in a three
mile race at Redwood City.
In 1956 and again in '57 the
Indians continued to master the
Bear oarsmen, defeating them
both years on' the Cal course. In
the past two years Ihe fast-rising
Stanford crew has placed fifth in
a field of 13 in the IRA National
Regatta at Syracuse.
Tomorrow the Stanford crew
faces Washington for the Pacific
Coast rowing crown. On June 15
they meet Wisconsin at Madison
and on June 22 they will he the
sole West Coast representative
in the IRA National Regatta.

Tn 1955 Lindsey whipped Ihe
Cards into an outstanding crew.
The Indians shocked the rowing
world by defeating California
and Washington for the first
lime since 1917 in the Western
Sprint Championships. One week
later they proved it was no fluke
by dunking the Bears in a three
mile race at Redwood City.
In 1956 and again in '57 the
Indians continued to master the
Bear oarsmen, defeating them
both years on' the Cal course. In

Regatta at Syracuse.

Editor's Note: This is the
second part of a two-part ar

After World War 11, crew on
Ihe Farm was successfully re
vived and the rowers pulled off
iheir greatest upset when they
challenged and defeated Cal on
the morning of the '46 Big Game.
The victory was so impressive
that someone anonymously do
nated two new shells to the In
dians.
However, at the end of autumn
quarter in '46, Carl Pederson,
who had been coaching Ihe
Cards, graduated, so Lindsey
took over. Since a new coxswain
had been developed, Lindsey con
fined his crew duties to just
coaching.
Clarke Takes Over
However, during the winter
quarter of 1947 Lindsey had to
drop out of school when he had
a reaction 1o a wound lie received
in combat during the war.
Commander A. A. CAce) j
Clarke, an NROTC instructor
ihen stationed at Stanford, took
up the crew coaching duties. He
had been an oarsman at the Na
val Academy.
When Clarke left in 1950, Jim
Beggs, who had been working i
with the frosh, moved up and
coached the varsity two years.
.Jim Fifer, an oarsman from the
class of '52, took over when
Beggs left and coached for a year
before he went into the Navy, j
Dave Dravs followed Fifer and i
coached for a year before he left, j
and then Lindsey look over.
After their quick start in '46,
crew at Stanford grew steadily.
Tn 1949 the Indians received an
invitation to row in the famous
Poughkeepsie Regatta at Mari
etta, New York. The Cards fin
ished 10th in a field of 12.
Record Improves
In 1950 the Cards finished a
contested third and were runner
up to California in the 1952 and
1953 Western Sprint Champion
ships at Newport Beach. These
triumphs were won in the face of
continuing financial hardships as
the Stanford crew was a" com
pletely self-supporting organiza
tion at that time.
By 1954, rowing conditions at
ihe Palo Alto harbor were so bad
that the crew decided to forego

entering the Nationals which had
moved to Syracuse, New York,

wood City where a protected
channel offered calm water for
afternoon practices.
New Boat house
The oarsmen hesitatingly ap
proached city officials, alumni,
friends and businessmen with
their plan, and found them eager
to lend a hand. At a cost of $6000
and with their own labor, the
oarsmen built a modern shell
house, complete with showers,
storage and work space.
Lindsey, in the meantime, had

coached for a year before he left, j
and then Lindsey look over.
After their quick start in '46,
crew at Stanford grew steadily.
Tn 1949 the Indians received an
invitation to row in the famous
Poughkeepsie Regatta at Mari
etta, New York. The Cards fin
ished 10th in a field of 12.
Record Improves
In 1950 the Cards finished a
contested third and were runner
up to California in the 1952 and
1953 Western Sprint Champion
ships at Newport Beach. These
triumphs were won in the face of
continuing financial hardships as
the Stanford crew was a" com
pletely self-supporting organiza
tion at that time.
By 1954, rowing conditions at
ihe Palo Alto harbor were so bad
that the crew decided to forego

entering the Nationals which had
moved to Syracuse, New York,
aYid build a boat house at Red
wood City where a protected
channel offered calm water for
afternoon practices.
New Boat house
The oarsmen hesitatingly ap
proached city officials, alumni,
friends and businessmen with
their plan, and found them eager
to lend a hand. At a cost of $6000
and with their own labor, the
oarsmen built a modern shell
house, complete with showers,
storage and work space.
Lindsey, in the meantime, had
recovered. lie returned to Busi
ness School and obtained his
M.B.A. After graduation he got
a job with a San Francisco in
vestment firm and seemed to be
resigned to going through life in
a gray flannel suit.
Lindsey Returns
Tn 1954 he was merely an in
terested spectator at Ihe Oak
land Estuary when Cal humiliat
ed the unconditioned Indian oars
men by finishing 12 FULL
LENGTHS ahead of the Cards.
After the race Indian captain
Dan Ayrault and co - captain
Rowd Davis cornered Lindsey.
The two captains poured cokes
down Lindsey and showed him
plans for a new boat house to be
built at Redwood City Yacht Har
bor and alter setting him up for
the kill asked him to be their
coach.
Lindsey accepted. He had to.
Crew had a hold on Lindsey and
it has possessed him. He tried to
get away several times in ihe
past but now he is happily re
signed to his fate.
Beat Cal Twice
Tn 1955 Lindsey whipped Ihe
Cards into an outstanding crew.
The Indians shocked the rowing
world by defeating California
and Washington for the first
lime since 1917 in the Western
Sprint Championships. One week
later they proved it was no fluke
by dunking the Bears in a three
mile race at Redwood City.
In 1956 and again in '57 the
Indians continued to master the
Bear oarsmen, defeating them
both years on' the Cal course. In
the past two years Ihe fast-rising
Stanford crew has placed fifth in
a field of 13 in the IRA National
Regatta at Syracuse.
Tomorrow the Stanford crew
faces Washington for the Pacific
Coast rowing crown. On June 15
they meet Wisconsin at Madison
and on June 22 they will he the
sole West Coast representative
in the IRA National Regatta.
Editor's Note: This is the
second part of a two-part ar
ticle about the history of Stan
ford's' semi-orphan crew.
After World War 11, crew on
Ihe Farm was successfully re
vived and the rowers pulled off
iheir greatest upset when they
challenged and defeated Cal on
the morning of the '46 Big Game.
The victory was so impressive
that someone anonymously do
nated two new shells to the In
dians.
However, at the end of autumn
quarter in '46, Carl Pederson,
who had been coaching Ihe
Cards, graduated, so Lindsey
took over. Since a new coxswain
had been developed, Lindsey con
fined his crew duties to just
coaching.
Clarke Takes Over
However, during the winter
quarter of 1947 Lindsey had to
drop out of school when he had
a reaction 1o a wound lie received
in combat during the war.
Commander A. A. CAce) j
Clarke, an NROTC instructor
ihen stationed at Stanford, took
up the crew coaching duties. He
had been an oarsman at the Na
val Academy.
When Clarke left in 1950, Jim
Beggs, who had been working i
with the frosh, moved up and
coached the varsity two years.

class of '52, took over when
