# Tribe Meets With World's Best Spikers In Weekend's Coliseum, Modesto Relays
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford takes two quick steps j
along the invitational track meet
trail tonight and tomorrow when
the Indians compete with the
world's finest spikers in the Los
Angeles Coliseum Relays and Cal
ifornia Relays in Modesto.
The five Tribesmen who will
compete at Los Angeles are broad
jumper Frank Herrmann, javelin
thrower Hank Roldan, discus man
Fred Peters, hurdler Chuck Cobb,:
and high-jumper Phil Fehlen.
These same five men will also ;
be at Modesto, along with fresh
man relay teams in the mile and j
distance medley, 440 ace Don
Chesarek, distance specialist I
Maury Graves, pole-vaulter Mike!
Franchetti, freshman broad-jump
and hop-step-jump artist John;
Kelly, and most of the rest of the!
Stanford regulars.
Foil r-Mi nu te Mile
Both meets will feature many of
the same "name" performers, in
cluding four-minute milers Merv
Lincoln, Derek Ibbotson, Laszlo
Tabori, and Brian Hewson,
Olympic champions Milt Camp
bell, Lee Calhoun, Charley Dumas,
Tom Courtney, and Bobby Mor
row, and new world record-holder
in the pole vaule, Bob Gutowski.
Coliseum Relays officials are
hopeful of producing a sub-four
minute mile at their meet. Lincoln,
the most recent member of thei
elite four-minute club, ran 3:58.9
last March in Australia. Tabori
and Hewson both broke the magic
barrier two seasons ago in the
same race, while Ibbotson ran
3:59.4 in 1956.
Hewson in SXO
Lincoln, Ibbotson, and Walters
will all tangle again tomorrow
night at Modesto, but Hewson will
drop down to the 880. In the half,
he will be tangling with Courtney,
the Olympic record-holder at 800
meters, and Arnie Sowell, the lithe
ex-Pitt runner who has always
beaten Courtney indoors. Sowell
has run 1:47.0, just one-tenth off
the world record, while Courtney
warmed up with a 1:47.8 last week.
Morrow, the junior speedster j
from Abilene Christian who won
three Olympic gold medals, is ex
pected to win the 100 at both
meets. His most rugged competi-!
tion will probably come at Mo
desto, where he faces Leamon

King and Mike Agostini, co-hold
ers of the world record of 9.3,
Because of an injury to Abi
lene's Bill Woodhouse, its 440 and
880-yard relay teeams will be un
able to run. This leaves Texas in
the role of decided favorites in
these events. The Texans have al
ready run to world records of 39.9
and 1:22.7 in the two sprint re
lays.
The Indians' Cobb will face some
of the best hurdle competition of
his life in Los Angeles. Heading
the list of entries is Olympic 110-
meter barrier champion Lee Cal
houn. Calhoun has run 13.7 this
'spring, just one-tenth better than
Campbell or Fresno State's Ancel
Robinson, the nation's second and
third best.
Herrmann Unbeaten
Herrmann stands a good chance
to keep his 1957 record unscathed.
He won the broad jump at all the
Indians' dual and triangular meets
this year, and followed that up
with victories at the Fresno Re
lays and PCC Championships the
last two weeks. He got his best
jump, 25-3, at the Fresno meet.
In the high jump, Fehlen will
probably have to take a back seat
to Dumas, the world record-holder
and only amateur to ever clear
seven feet. Because of eligibility
problems, Dumas couldn't com
pete for USC this year, so has been
a little short on meet work.
Roldan, Peters vs. USC
Roldan and Peters will both bat
tle old rivals from IJSC in the jave
lin and discus. Roldan, who lost
out to Troy's Bob Voiles and Doug
Maijala in the PCC meet, is near
ing the 230-foot mark, and could
better it in either of the two meets.
Peters is out to throw the discus
past the 175-foot line.
Cal Relay Features
Special features of the California
Relays will be the freshman dis
tance medley relay and exhibition
hop-step-jump competition. In the
medleey, Ihe Papooses will run
against Occidental, UCLA, USC,
California, and possibly the na
tional frosh record-holding team
from Oklahoma.
Kelly and Herrmann will top
the Indian entries in the triple
jump. Kelly is regarded is a real

comer, after jumping 48-7 at the
West Coast Relays the first time
he ever tried the event.

drop down to the 880. In the half,
he will be tangling with Courtney,
the Olympic record-holder at 800
meters, and Arnie Sowell, the lithe
ex-Pitt runner who has always
beaten Courtney indoors. Sowell
has run 1:47.0, just one-tenth off
the world record, while Courtney
warmed up with a 1:47.8 last week.
Morrow, the junior speedster j
from Abilene Christian who won
three Olympic gold medals, is ex
pected to win the 100 at both
meets. His most rugged competi-!
tion will probably come at Mo
desto, where he faces Leamon

King and Mike Agostini, co-hold
ers of the world record of 9.3,
Because of an injury to Abi
lene's Bill Woodhouse, its 440 and
880-yard relay teeams will be un
able to run. This leaves Texas in
the role of decided favorites in
these events. The Texans have al
ready run to world records of 39.9
and 1:22.7 in the two sprint re
lays.
The Indians' Cobb will face some
of the best hurdle competition of
his life in Los Angeles. Heading
the list of entries is Olympic 110-
meter barrier champion Lee Cal
houn. Calhoun has run 13.7 this
'spring, just one-tenth better than
Campbell or Fresno State's Ancel
Robinson, the nation's second and
third best.
Herrmann Unbeaten
Herrmann stands a good chance
to keep his 1957 record unscathed.
He won the broad jump at all the
Indians' dual and triangular meets
this year, and followed that up
with victories at the Fresno Re
lays and PCC Championships the
last two weeks. He got his best
jump, 25-3, at the Fresno meet.
In the high jump, Fehlen will
probably have to take a back seat
to Dumas, the world record-holder
and only amateur to ever clear
seven feet. Because of eligibility
problems, Dumas couldn't com
pete for USC this year, so has been
a little short on meet work.
Roldan, Peters vs. USC
Roldan and Peters will both bat
tle old rivals from IJSC in the jave
lin and discus. Roldan, who lost
out to Troy's Bob Voiles and Doug
Maijala in the PCC meet, is near
ing the 230-foot mark, and could
better it in either of the two meets.
Peters is out to throw the discus
past the 175-foot line.
Cal Relay Features
Special features of the California
Relays will be the freshman dis
tance medley relay and exhibition
hop-step-jump competition. In the
medleey, Ihe Papooses will run
against Occidental, UCLA, USC,
California, and possibly the na
tional frosh record-holding team
from Oklahoma.
Kelly and Herrmann will top
the Indian entries in the triple
jump. Kelly is regarded is a real

comer, after jumping 48-7 at the
West Coast Relays the first time
he ever tried the event.

jump, 25-3, at the Fresno meet.
In the high jump, Fehlen will
probably have to take a back seat
to Dumas, the world record-holder
and only amateur to ever clear
seven feet. Because of eligibility
problems, Dumas couldn't com
pete for USC this year, so has been
a little short on meet work.
Roldan, Peters vs. USC
Roldan and Peters will both bat
tle old rivals from IJSC in the jave
lin and discus. Roldan, who lost
out to Troy's Bob Voiles and Doug
Maijala in the PCC meet, is near
ing the 230-foot mark, and could
better it in either of the two meets.
Peters is out to throw the discus
past the 175-foot line.
Cal Relay Features
Special features of the California
Relays will be the freshman dis
tance medley relay and exhibition
hop-step-jump competition. In the
medleey, Ihe Papooses will run
against Occidental, UCLA, USC,
California, and possibly the na
tional frosh record-holding team
from Oklahoma.
Kelly and Herrmann will top
the Indian entries in the triple

comer, after jumping 48-7 at the
West Coast Relays the first time
he ever tried the event.

Stanford takes two quick steps j
along the invitational track meet
trail tonight and tomorrow when
the Indians compete with the
world's finest spikers in the Los
Angeles Coliseum Relays and Cal
ifornia Relays in Modesto.
The five Tribesmen who will
compete at Los Angeles are broad
jumper Frank Herrmann, javelin
thrower Hank Roldan, discus man
Fred Peters, hurdler Chuck Cobb,:
and high-jumper Phil Fehlen.
These same five men will also ;
be at Modesto, along with fresh
man relay teams in the mile and j
distance medley, 440 ace Don
Chesarek, distance specialist I
Maury Graves, pole-vaulter Mike!
Franchetti, freshman broad-jump
and hop-step-jump artist John;
Kelly, and most of the rest of the!
Stanford regulars.
Foil r-Mi nu te Mile
Both meets will feature many of
the same "name" performers, in
cluding four-minute milers Merv
Lincoln, Derek Ibbotson, Laszlo
Tabori, and Brian Hewson,
Olympic champions Milt Camp
bell, Lee Calhoun, Charley Dumas,
Tom Courtney, and Bobby Mor
row, and new world record-holder
in the pole vaule, Bob Gutowski.
Coliseum Relays officials are
hopeful of producing a sub-four
minute mile at their meet. Lincoln,
the most recent member of thei
elite four-minute club, ran 3:58.9
last March in Australia. Tabori
and Hewson both broke the magic
barrier two seasons ago in the
same race, while Ibbotson ran
3:59.4 in 1956.
Hewson in SXO
Lincoln, Ibbotson, and Walters
will all tangle again tomorrow
night at Modesto, but Hewson will
drop down to the 880. In the half,
he will be tangling with Courtney,
the Olympic record-holder at 800
meters, and Arnie Sowell, the lithe
ex-Pitt runner who has always
beaten Courtney indoors. Sowell
has run 1:47.0, just one-tenth off
the world record, while Courtney
warmed up with a 1:47.8 last week.
Morrow, the junior speedster j
from Abilene Christian who won
three Olympic gold medals, is ex
pected to win the 100 at both
meets. His most rugged competi-!
tion will probably come at Mo
desto, where he faces Leamon

King and Mike Agostini, co-hold
ers of the world record of 9.3,
Because of an injury to Abi
lene's Bill Woodhouse, its 440 and
880-yard relay teeams will be un
able to run. This leaves Texas in
the role of decided favorites in
these events. The Texans have al
ready run to world records of 39.9
and 1:22.7 in the two sprint re
lays.
The Indians' Cobb will face some
of the best hurdle competition of
his life in Los Angeles. Heading
the list of entries is Olympic 110-
meter barrier champion Lee Cal
houn. Calhoun has run 13.7 this
'spring, just one-tenth better than
Campbell or Fresno State's Ancel
Robinson, the nation's second and
third best.
Herrmann Unbeaten
Herrmann stands a good chance
to keep his 1957 record unscathed.
He won the broad jump at all the
Indians' dual and triangular meets
this year, and followed that up
with victories at the Fresno Re

last two weeks. He got his best
