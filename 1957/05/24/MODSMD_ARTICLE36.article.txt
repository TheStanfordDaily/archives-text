SPOKANE, Wash., May 23
• UP)—The Pacific* Coast Confer-j
ence adopted a new formula of i
providing aid to athletes today, |
but retained the limit of $100 per
month which may be earned.
Faculty representatives also
announced plans for requiring!
that, effective September, 1960, j
students wanting to take part in |
athletics at conference schools
must have had a 2.5 (C plus) j
grade average in his college pre
paratory subjects in high school.
Conference spokesman Dr.
Glenn Seaborg of California said
the new plan permits a football
or basketball player to receive
double the hourly rate for a max
imum of six hours during his
sport's season. In other words,
he could trade six hours' work
for $24 per week provided he was
a bona fide member of a fresh
man or varsity squad.
The plan was approved by a 6
to 3 vote, with California, UCLA
and Stanford opposed.
Seaborg said the plan was
adopted to compensate an ath
lete for lost employment oppor
tunities during the season in
which he competes.
