# Fellowship of Reconciliation Strives for World Harmony
## Stanford Chapter Member of World Group In Support of Race Equality and Pacifism 
### John Lane 
Stanford's chapter of the Fel
lowship of Reconciliation is an
arm of the international organi
zation which has grown up from
the need to abolish war and the
need for good will among na
tions, races and classes.
The Fellowship of Reconcilia
tion is pacifist. Not only do the
members believe that war, or vio
lent reaction to problems, is
wrong, but they strive through
work and example to prove to
those with whom they come in
contact that there are better
means for- the solution of inter
national, interracial and inter
personal problems.
The Stanford chapter numbers
about 25 members. Since it was
started by eight students last
autumn, the Stanford FOR has
brought to the campus speakers
from the national FOR and the
American Friends Service Com
mittee, many of whom have had
a great amount of experience in
field work.
A week ago Roy Kepler, the
bookstore proprietor who refused
to pay his taxes, explained his
reasons in a meeting sponsored
by the For.
As early as 1919, the national
FOR had begun to intervene
peacefully in the labor strikes
and violence which characterized
much of the era of the twenties.
Offering themselves as media
tors, and providing relief for
strikers, the FOR members
sought to bring about peaceful
labor-management relations and
tfi soothe the bitterness that ex
isted between the two sometimes
armed camps.
Recently, FOR members have
been active in the movement for
racial equality.
The "passive resistance" of the
Negroes of Montgomery who
took part in the bus boycotts
was taught them by a member of
the FOR, Glenn Smiley, the na
tional field secretary. Smiley was
discussion leader at a retreat
sponsored recently by the Stan
ford chapter of the FOR.
On campus, the FOR has been
active in trying to have discrimi
natory fraternity race clauses re
moved from the house constitu
tions.
Bruce Busching, president of
the Stanford chapter of FOR,
said: "The NAACP works
through the courts to try to get
rules upholding segregation re
moved from Ihe statute books.
We, on the other hand, work in
Ihe field with the people in
volved."
Conscientious objectors to mil
itary service have in the past re
ceived help from the FOR in
their fight to he accorded the
constitutional rights of a person
who feels morally obligated not
to bear arms against other men.
The FOR does not only recog
nize pacifism, and conscientious

objection to military service. It
also tries to bring about a type
of thinking and acting in the
world that will eliminate the ne
cessity for the use of force and
violence in "settling" world af
fairs.
Busching summed up the feel
ing of the FOR toward war:
"People know how to wage war,"
he said, "but they don't know
anything about waging peace.
We believe in enforceable dis
armament, but arms can't en
force disarmament."
The FOR on campus is not at
tempting to carry out any force
ful program of action. Busching
said, "We are not a radical, hy
per-active group on the campus.
Our purpose here is merely to
try to bring the students the idea
that there is some other way of
solving international friction
than by continuing it. Then, we
want to sit down and find out
how we, as individuals, can help
this idea to be realized."

reasons in a meeting sponsored
by the For.
As early as 1919, the national
FOR had begun to intervene
peacefully in the labor strikes
and violence which characterized
much of the era of the twenties.
Offering themselves as media
tors, and providing relief for
strikers, the FOR members
sought to bring about peaceful
labor-management relations and
tfi soothe the bitterness that ex
isted between the two sometimes
armed camps.
Recently, FOR members have
been active in the movement for
racial equality.
The "passive resistance" of the
Negroes of Montgomery who
took part in the bus boycotts
was taught them by a member of
the FOR, Glenn Smiley, the na
tional field secretary. Smiley was
discussion leader at a retreat
sponsored recently by the Stan
ford chapter of the FOR.
On campus, the FOR has been
active in trying to have discrimi
natory fraternity race clauses re
moved from the house constitu
tions.
Bruce Busching, president of
the Stanford chapter of FOR,
said: "The NAACP works
through the courts to try to get
rules upholding segregation re
moved from Ihe statute books.
We, on the other hand, work in
Ihe field with the people in
volved."
Conscientious objectors to mil
itary service have in the past re
ceived help from the FOR in
their fight to he accorded the
constitutional rights of a person
who feels morally obligated not
to bear arms against other men.
The FOR does not only recog
nize pacifism, and conscientious

objection to military service. It
also tries to bring about a type
of thinking and acting in the
world that will eliminate the ne
cessity for the use of force and
violence in "settling" world af
fairs.
Busching summed up the feel
ing of the FOR toward war:
"People know how to wage war,"
he said, "but they don't know
anything about waging peace.
We believe in enforceable dis
armament, but arms can't en
force disarmament."
The FOR on campus is not at
tempting to carry out any force
ful program of action. Busching
said, "We are not a radical, hy
per-active group on the campus.
Our purpose here is merely to
try to bring the students the idea
that there is some other way of
solving international friction
than by continuing it. Then, we
want to sit down and find out
how we, as individuals, can help
this idea to be realized."
Stanford's chapter of the Fel
lowship of Reconciliation is an
arm of the international organi
zation which has grown up from
the need to abolish war and the
need for good will among na
tions, races and classes.
The Fellowship of Reconcilia
tion is pacifist. Not only do the
members believe that war, or vio
lent reaction to problems, is
wrong, but they strive through
work and example to prove to
those with whom they come in
contact that there are better
means for- the solution of inter
national, interracial and inter
personal problems.
The Stanford chapter numbers
about 25 members. Since it was
started by eight students last
autumn, the Stanford FOR has
brought to the campus speakers
from the national FOR and the
American Friends Service Com
mittee, many of whom have had
a great amount of experience in
field work.
A week ago Roy Kepler, the
bookstore proprietor who refused
to pay his taxes, explained his
reasons in a meeting sponsored
