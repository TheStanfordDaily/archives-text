# Arms Cut Plan For U.S., Reds Now Discussed
## 'Small Slice' Proposal To Reduce East-West Military Defense Cost 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 23 (UP)
- The new "first step" disarma
ment plan under discussion with
Russia calls for a "small slice
arms cut" covering missiles,
ships, tanks and atomic bombers,
it was revealed today.
Other parts of the plan call for
an aerial-ground inspection to be
set up on a test basis and pro
posals looking toward a reduc
tion in military manpower and
defense spending by the United
States, .Russia and other nations.
Any initial East - West agree
ment on arms reduction also
would provide that weapons ta
ken out of U.S. or Soviet stock
piles be delivered to international
disarmament depots which would
be under careful inspection.
Weapon Development
The plan further provides that
nations which do not now have
atomic weapons would not devel
op them. At present only the
United States, Britain and Rus
sia have atomic or hydrogen
bombs in their arsenals.
Some details of the plan now
being considered by the United
States were disclosed as Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
and Presidential disarmament ad
viser Harold E. Stassen briefed
Senate leaders on negotiations
with Russia to date.
Any agreement for arms re
duction or setting up an aerial
ground inspection zone would
have to be presented to the Sen
ate for approval. Some members,
including Senate GOP Leader
William F. Knowland, have
voiced doubts. However, chances
are the pact would be approved.
"With Inspection"
Stassen, who returns to Lon
don Sunday for further United
Nations disarmament talks, told
a Senate Foreign Relations Sub
committee the negotiations are
aimed at "a first step agreement
for a small slice cut with inspec
tion."
It was said that atomic and hy
drogen bombs would not be cov
ered in this first-stage agree
ment. But other major arms, in
cluding planes capable of deliver-,
ing nuclear bombs, would be re
duced in number.
No precise formula for cutting
major arms has been established.
But officials at the London talks
attended by the United States,
Russia, Britain, France and Can
ada have been talking in terms of
a 10 to 15 per cent cut.

WASHINGTON, May 23 (UP)
- The new "first step" disarma
ment plan under discussion with
Russia calls for a "small slice
arms cut" covering missiles,
ships, tanks and atomic bombers,
it was revealed today.
Other parts of the plan call for
an aerial-ground inspection to be
set up on a test basis and pro
posals looking toward a reduc
tion in military manpower and
defense spending by the United
States, .Russia and other nations.
Any initial East - West agree
ment on arms reduction also
would provide that weapons ta
ken out of U.S. or Soviet stock
piles be delivered to international
disarmament depots which would
be under careful inspection.
Weapon Development
The plan further provides that
nations which do not now have
atomic weapons would not devel
op them. At present only the
United States, Britain and Rus
sia have atomic or hydrogen
bombs in their arsenals.
Some details of the plan now
being considered by the United
States were disclosed as Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
and Presidential disarmament ad
viser Harold E. Stassen briefed
Senate leaders on negotiations
with Russia to date.
Any agreement for arms re
duction or setting up an aerial
ground inspection zone would
have to be presented to the Sen
ate for approval. Some members,
including Senate GOP Leader
William F. Knowland, have
voiced doubts. However, chances
are the pact would be approved.
"With Inspection"
Stassen, who returns to Lon
don Sunday for further United
Nations disarmament talks, told
a Senate Foreign Relations Sub
committee the negotiations are
aimed at "a first step agreement
for a small slice cut with inspec
tion."
It was said that atomic and hy
drogen bombs would not be cov
ered in this first-stage agree
ment. But other major arms, in
cluding planes capable of deliver-,
ing nuclear bombs, would be re
duced in number.
No precise formula for cutting
major arms has been established.
But officials at the London talks
attended by the United States,
Russia, Britain, France and Can
ada have been talking in terms of
a 10 to 15 per cent cut.
