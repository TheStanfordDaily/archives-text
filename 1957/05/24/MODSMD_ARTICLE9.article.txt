# Stanford Challenges Washington Crew In Battle of Unbeaten Here Tomorrow
## 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
Eight big Indians and one little
chief will battle eight hairy Hus
kies and one yelping cub for the
mythical West Coast rowing
championship tomorrow morning
at the Redwood City Yacht Har
bor.
Both varsity crews will go into
the race undefeated, but Washing
ton is rated the favorite. The Hus

kies have on]/ one victory to their
credit this year, but it was an
impressive 6^-length win over
California last Saturday on Lake
Washington.
Stanford defeated the Bears by
2V 2 lengths three weeks ago in a
disorganized fiasco in which wa
ter skiers, pleasure craft and a
fireboat cluttered up the course,
almost swamping both shells.
Huskies Mad
In addition to the Cal victory,
the Cards hold wins over USC,
Oregon State and UCLA. The
Bears defeated Wisconsin and
UCLA earlier this season, so the
winner of Saturday's battle will
be Ihe unchallenged champion of
the entire West.
Washington will enter tomor
row's regatta with an added in
centive to win. Because of the
PCC scandals in which the Hus
kies were involved, the NCAA re
fused to take the crew off pro
bation, on which it was placed
along with football and all other
Washington sports.
The Huskies feel the penalties
on the crew were unjust, and
they can be counted upon to go
all out in an attempt to take their
spite out on Stanford.
Lindsey Lists Equalizers
Card coach Lou Lindsey, how
ever, can list an hour's worth of
reasons why the Indians can win.
As the optimistic Lindsey put it,
"We plan to win."
Although Washington defeated
Cal by four more lengths than did
Stanford, Lindsey compiled a list
of six equalizers he feels should
reduce the margin:
• Washington was rowing
against Cal on their own course.
• Cal arrived at Washington at
the "last minute," after a long
train ride.
• Washington will be rowing in
unfamiliar, borrowed equipment.
• When Stanford beat Cal, the
water conditions were "the worst
I have ever seen."
• Washington will arrive here

late (at noon today) and have
only one opportunity to test the
Indian course.
• The Stanford course is diffi
cult in that there are three turns
to maneuver instead of the nor
mal straight course the Huskies
are used to on Lake Washington.
Coach Lindsey plans to start
Ihe same varsity eight that de
feated Cal. Olympic gold medal
winner Kurt Seifert will handle
the coxswain duties.
Sophomore Rolf Peterson will
.stroke the Indians, and senior Ron
Rose, the most experienced oars
man in the shell, will row in the
how position.
The Nos. 5 and G positions,
where the power of a crew lies,
will he manned by 198-pound Dick
Draeger and 195-pound Hob Clark.
Draeger is the biggest (6-6) man
in ihe boat. Last year he received
the annual award for the out
standing frosh oarsman.
Swimming Oarsman?
Nate "The Protein Kid" Topol
will hold down the No. 3 spot.
Last year, after a disappointing
finish in an Olympic trial heat, he
astounded officials by diving over
board. John "Tweedy" Reich
mann, a 195-pound junior, will be
in the No. 2 position.
"Silent Wil" Stinson, secretary
of the Stanford Crow Association,
will be at the seventh spot. He is
the "brain" on the crew, with vir
tually a straight-A average in his
engineering major.

I Sophomore Roald Engebreth,
who found his way to the Farm
from Anchorage, Alaska, will be
in the fourth seat. lie has the
added responsibility of getting out
; nil the Stanford crew publicity.
Loudspeaker at Finish
The No. 2 varsity boats from
| each school will get the morning's
I activities going with a three-mile
j duel at 10:15. The freshmen will
J bend their oars at 11:05 over a
two • mile course. The varsities
will square off at 11:45 and match
(strokes in a three-mile regatta.
A public address system will be
set up at the finish line to keep
I spectators informed about the
shells' progress over the first part
of the races. They will receive
their news from a walkie-talkie
crew transmitting from a launch
trailing each regatta.
The finish line is near the Stan
ford boat house, opposite the Les
lie Salt dock. Limited parking is
! located near the finish, but over
flow cars will find ample space
at the Port of Redwood City, a
short distance from the shell
house. Free bus service will be
available to shuttle spectators
j from the overflow parking area
i to the finish line.

THIO STANFORD CREW, WHICH WILL FACE WASHINGTON HERE TOMORROW FOR THE PCC TITLI
Eight big Indians and one little
chief will battle eight hairy Hus
kies and one yelping cub for the
mythical West Coast rowing
championship tomorrow morning
at the Redwood City Yacht Har
bor.
Both varsity crews will go into
the race undefeated, but Washing
ton is rated the favorite. The Hus

kies have on]/ one victory to their
credit this year, but it was an
impressive 6^-length win over
California last Saturday on Lake
Washington.
Stanford defeated the Bears by
2V 2 lengths three weeks ago in a
disorganized fiasco in which wa
ter skiers, pleasure craft and a
fireboat cluttered up the course,
almost swamping both shells.
Huskies Mad
In addition to the Cal victory,
the Cards hold wins over USC,
Oregon State and UCLA. The
Bears defeated Wisconsin and
UCLA earlier this season, so the
winner of Saturday's battle will
be Ihe unchallenged champion of
the entire West.
Washington will enter tomor
row's regatta with an added in
centive to win. Because of the
PCC scandals in which the Hus
kies were involved, the NCAA re
fused to take the crew off pro
bation, on which it was placed
along with football and all other
Washington sports.
The Huskies feel the penalties
on the crew were unjust, and
they can be counted upon to go
all out in an attempt to take their
spite out on Stanford.
Lindsey Lists Equalizers
Card coach Lou Lindsey, how
ever, can list an hour's worth of
reasons why the Indians can win.
As the optimistic Lindsey put it,
"We plan to win."
Although Washington defeated
Cal by four more lengths than did
Stanford, Lindsey compiled a list
of six equalizers he feels should
reduce the margin:
• Washington was rowing
against Cal on their own course.
• Cal arrived at Washington at
the "last minute," after a long
train ride.
• Washington will be rowing in
unfamiliar, borrowed equipment.
• When Stanford beat Cal, the
water conditions were "the worst
I have ever seen."
• Washington will arrive here

late (at noon today) and have
only one opportunity to test the
Indian course.
• The Stanford course is diffi
cult in that there are three turns
to maneuver instead of the nor
mal straight course the Huskies
are used to on Lake Washington.
Coach Lindsey plans to start
Ihe same varsity eight that de
feated Cal. Olympic gold medal
winner Kurt Seifert will handle
the coxswain duties.
Sophomore Rolf Peterson will
.stroke the Indians, and senior Ron
Rose, the most experienced oars
man in the shell, will row in the
how position.

disorganized fiasco in which wa
ter skiers, pleasure craft and a
fireboat cluttered up the course,
almost swamping both shells.
Huskies Mad
In addition to the Cal victory,
the Cards hold wins over USC,
Oregon State and UCLA. The
Bears defeated Wisconsin and
UCLA earlier this season, so the
winner of Saturday's battle will
be Ihe unchallenged champion of
the entire West.
Washington will enter tomor
row's regatta with an added in
centive to win. Because of the
PCC scandals in which the Hus
kies were involved, the NCAA re
fused to take the crew off pro
bation, on which it was placed
along with football and all other
Washington sports.
The Huskies feel the penalties
on the crew were unjust, and
they can be counted upon to go
all out in an attempt to take their
spite out on Stanford.
Lindsey Lists Equalizers
Card coach Lou Lindsey, how
ever, can list an hour's worth of
reasons why the Indians can win.
As the optimistic Lindsey put it,
"We plan to win."
Although Washington defeated
Cal by four more lengths than did
Stanford, Lindsey compiled a list
of six equalizers he feels should
reduce the margin:
• Washington was rowing
against Cal on their own course.
• Cal arrived at Washington at
the "last minute," after a long
train ride.
• Washington will be rowing in
unfamiliar, borrowed equipment.
• When Stanford beat Cal, the
water conditions were "the worst
I have ever seen."
• Washington will arrive here

late (at noon today) and have
only one opportunity to test the
Indian course.
• The Stanford course is diffi
cult in that there are three turns
to maneuver instead of the nor
mal straight course the Huskies
are used to on Lake Washington.
Coach Lindsey plans to start
Ihe same varsity eight that de
feated Cal. Olympic gold medal
winner Kurt Seifert will handle
the coxswain duties.
Sophomore Rolf Peterson will
.stroke the Indians, and senior Ron
Rose, the most experienced oars
man in the shell, will row in the
how position.
The Nos. 5 and G positions,
where the power of a crew lies,
will he manned by 198-pound Dick
Draeger and 195-pound Hob Clark.
Draeger is the biggest (6-6) man
in ihe boat. Last year he received
the annual award for the out
standing frosh oarsman.
Swimming Oarsman?
Nate "The Protein Kid" Topol
will hold down the No. 3 spot.
Last year, after a disappointing
finish in an Olympic trial heat, he
astounded officials by diving over
board. John "Tweedy" Reich
mann, a 195-pound junior, will be
in the No. 2 position.
"Silent Wil" Stinson, secretary
of the Stanford Crow Association,
will be at the seventh spot. He is
the "brain" on the crew, with vir
tually a straight-A average in his
engineering major.

I Sophomore Roald Engebreth,
who found his way to the Farm
from Anchorage, Alaska, will be
in the fourth seat. lie has the
added responsibility of getting out
; nil the Stanford crew publicity.
Loudspeaker at Finish
The No. 2 varsity boats from
| each school will get the morning's
I activities going with a three-mile
j duel at 10:15. The freshmen will
J bend their oars at 11:05 over a
two • mile course. The varsities
will square off at 11:45 and match
(strokes in a three-mile regatta.
A public address system will be
set up at the finish line to keep
I spectators informed about the
shells' progress over the first part
of the races. They will receive
their news from a walkie-talkie
crew transmitting from a launch
trailing each regatta.
The finish line is near the Stan
ford boat house, opposite the Les
lie Salt dock. Limited parking is
! located near the finish, but over
flow cars will find ample space
at the Port of Redwood City, a
short distance from the shell
house. Free bus service will be
available to shuttle spectators
j from the overflow parking area
i to the finish line.


THIO STANFORD CREW, WHICH WILL FACE WASHINGTON HERE TOMORROW FOR THE PCC TITLI
Eight big Indians and one little
chief will battle eight hairy Hus
kies and one yelping cub for the
mythical West Coast rowing
championship tomorrow morning
at the Redwood City Yacht Har
bor.
Both varsity crews will go into
the race undefeated, but Washing
ton is rated the favorite. The Hus

kies have on]/ one victory to their
credit this year, but it was an
impressive 6^-length win over
California last Saturday on Lake
Washington.
