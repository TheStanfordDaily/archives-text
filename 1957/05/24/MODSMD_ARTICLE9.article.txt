# Stanford Challenges Washington Crew In Battle of Unbeaten Here Tomorrow
## 
### Dean Stewart Sports Editor 
Eight big Indians and one little
chief will battle eight hairy Hus
kies and one yelping cub for the
mythical West Coast rowing
championship tomorrow morning
at the Redwood City Yacht Har
bor.
Both varsity crews will go into
the race undefeated, but Washing
ton is rated the favorite. The Hus

kies have on]/ one victory to their
credit this year, but it was an
impressive 6^-length win over
California last Saturday on Lake
Washington.
Stanford defeated the Bears by
2V 2 lengths three weeks ago in a
disorganized fiasco in which wa
ter skiers, pleasure craft and a
fireboat cluttered up the course,
almost swamping both shells.
Huskies Mad
In addition to the Cal victory,
the Cards hold wins over USC,
Oregon State and UCLA. The
Bears defeated Wisconsin and
UCLA earlier this season, so the
winner of Saturday's battle will
be Ihe unchallenged champion of
the entire West.
Washington will enter tomor
row's regatta with an added in
centive to win. Because of the
PCC scandals in which the Hus
kies were involved, the NCAA re
fused to take the crew off pro
bation, on which it was placed
along with football and all other
Washington sports.
The Huskies feel the penalties
on the crew were unjust, and
they can be counted upon to go
all out in an attempt to take their
spite out on Stanford.
Lindsey Lists Equalizers
Card coach Lou Lindsey, how
ever, can list an hour's worth of
reasons why the Indians can win.
As the optimistic Lindsey put it,
"We plan to win."
Although Washington defeated
Cal by four more lengths than did
Stanford, Lindsey compiled a list
of six equalizers he feels should
reduce the margin:
• Washington was rowing
against Cal on their own course.
• Cal arrived at Washington at
the "last minute," after a long
train ride.
• Washington will be rowing in
unfamiliar, borrowed equipment.
• When Stanford beat Cal, the
water conditions were "the worst
I have ever seen."
• Washington will arrive here

late (at noon today) and have
only one opportunity to test the
Indian course.
• The Stanford course is diffi
cult in that there are three turns
to maneuver instead of the nor
mal straight course the Huskies
are used to on Lake Washington.
