TAIPEI, Formosa, May 26 â€” The American ambassador to For
mosa met with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek today to "impress
him with the seriousness" of Friday's Taipei mob attacks on U.S.
installations and personnel, including the American embassy.
And a bit later, Chiang fired three ranking Nationalist military

and police officials for their fail
ure to take prompt action
against the anti-American riots.
Ambassador Karl Rankin said
after the firing that Chiang
asked him to convey his "pro
found regrets" to President Ei
senhower, and to assure him that
the anti-American riots did not
indicate "any expression of anti-
Americanism." Rankin told news
men that Nationalist authorities
wore "pretty slow" in taking
steps to halt the attacks.
The demonstrations broke out
in protest against the acquittal
by a U.S. court martial of Ameri
can M/Sgt. Robert G. Reynolds.
Reynolds was accused of killing a
Chinese "peeping Tom."
Informed so u rc e s reported
meanwhile that Nationalist po
lice have arrested an estimated
230 of the rioters, including a
number suspected of Communist
sympathies.
