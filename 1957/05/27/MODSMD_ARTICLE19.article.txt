# Haiti Civil War Ends in Capital With 80 Dead
## Provisional President Promises Elections 'Soon' to End Crisis 
### 
PORT AU PRINCE, Ilaili,
May 26 (UP) — Daniel Fignole
took office as provisional presi
dent of Haiti today to end a 24-
hour civil war that turned this
capital city into a battleground
and left as many as 80 persons
dead.
In a brief ceremony at the
presidential palace, Fignole
promised elections "as soon as
possible" to end the six-month
old Haitian political crisis. Some
10,000 cheering adherents who
massed outside the palace snake
danced through the streets in
celebration. Sporadic rifle fire
could be heard in parts of the
city.
Order returned slowly. Gun
shots could be heard through the
city during the night.
Police and roving mobs stop
ped automobiles and searched
them for weapons. The city still
was isolated by air. Cable of
fices opened and then said they
were closing.
Fignole organized an adminis
tration composed of three of the
four major political parties,
squeezing out Louis Dejoie, who
with Fignole, Clement Jumelle
and Dr. Frangois Duvalier had
been engaged in a four-cornered
race for the presidency.
The new regime disposed of
the quarrel that had developed
among the military and erupted
into outright warfare yesterday
by picking Colonel Antoine Ke
breau, commandant of the mili
tary department of the south, as
army chief of staff. Sources said
his appointment would be an
nounced in 24 hours.
They said General Leon Can
tave, who ousted a civilian junta
last Monday and took over the
government, would resign as
chief of staff. Colonel Pierre Ar
mand, whose forces clashed with
those of Cantave yesterday at
Dessalines Barracks, was reap
pointed to his old job as police
chief.
