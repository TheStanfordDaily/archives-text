# Still Nine Members
## 
### 
Whf.n the PCC meetings adjourned this past
weekend there were still nine eonferenee
members.
Although a motion to expel UCLA from the
conference failed, threats of bolting the PCC
are being thrown around by their alumni, with
tiSC and California joining in. In last Mon
day's session in Spokane, UCLA won a narrow
vote of confidence when a motion to expel (hem
from the conference failed by a 5-4 vote. Im
mediately after they were saved from being
tossed out, UCLA -threatened to quit, along
with USC and Cal.
Alumni of the three southern division schools
are raising the banner of revolt. But the
machinery was slowed down Saturday when
the Board of Regents of the ]Jniversities of
California tabled a motion to leave the con
ference. A committee will take charge and
study the proposal. So, temporarily the PCC
is still intact, and it gives the alumni some time
to simmer down.
The penalized schools of Washington, USC
and UCLA were unable to get five games of
eligibility back for their seniors. Last season
the seniors at these schools were allowed to
compete in five consecutive games. This year
the conference, by a vote of 5-4, decided to
leave the seniors ineligible. Oregon, Washing

ton State, Stanford, Oregon State and Idaho
opposed eligibility.
I he limit of $100 per month to athletes was
retained hv the conference. The representa
tives voted to make all athletes in the PCC
have a 2.5 (C plus) grade point average in
high school before being able to compete in
conference athletics. This rule will take effect
in 1960.
Since the PCC began cleaning house more
than a year ago, that house has been divided
into two camps. One camp is beaded by UCLA
and the other by Stanford. On UCLA's side
most of the time are USC and Washington—the
two other schools under fire from the PCC.
Siding with Stanford consistently are Oregon
and Idaho. California, Oregon State and Wash
ington State float from side to side—depending
on which way the wind is blowing that day.
Stanford, led by President Wallace Sterling,
maintains that education is the prime purpose
of a university. He is a strong exponent of
college amateurism and is against the "play
for-pay" plan of the bolting schools.
Although the house is divided, it will not
fall, be cause any school which bolts the con
ference will have committed athletic suicide.
UCLA and USC both draw the largest football
gates when Stanford plays down south. Besides,
what school will schedule a game with them,
especially if the NCAA censures them?

conference athletics. This rule will take effect
in 1960.
Since the PCC began cleaning house more
than a year ago, that house has been divided
into two camps. One camp is beaded by UCLA
and the other by Stanford. On UCLA's side
most of the time are USC and Washington—the
two other schools under fire from the PCC.
Siding with Stanford consistently are Oregon
and Idaho. California, Oregon State and Wash
ington State float from side to side—depending
on which way the wind is blowing that day.
Stanford, led by President Wallace Sterling,
maintains that education is the prime purpose
of a university. He is a strong exponent of
college amateurism and is against the "play
for-pay" plan of the bolting schools.
Although the house is divided, it will not
fall, be cause any school which bolts the con
ference will have committed athletic suicide.
UCLA and USC both draw the largest football
gates when Stanford plays down south. Besides,
what school will schedule a game with them,
especially if the NCAA censures them?
Whf.n the PCC meetings adjourned this past
weekend there were still nine eonferenee
members.
Although a motion to expel UCLA from the
conference failed, threats of bolting the PCC
are being thrown around by their alumni, with
tiSC and California joining in. In last Mon
day's session in Spokane, UCLA won a narrow
vote of confidence when a motion to expel (hem
from the conference failed by a 5-4 vote. Im
mediately after they were saved from being
tossed out, UCLA -threatened to quit, along
with USC and Cal.
Alumni of the three southern division schools
are raising the banner of revolt. But the
machinery was slowed down Saturday when
the Board of Regents of the ]Jniversities of
California tabled a motion to leave the con
ference. A committee will take charge and
study the proposal. So, temporarily the PCC
is still intact, and it gives the alumni some time
to simmer down.
The penalized schools of Washington, USC
and UCLA were unable to get five games of
eligibility back for their seniors. Last season
the seniors at these schools were allowed to
compete in five consecutive games. This year
the conference, by a vote of 5-4, decided to
leave the seniors ineligible. Oregon, Washing

ton State, Stanford, Oregon State and Idaho
opposed eligibility.
I he limit of $100 per month to athletes was
retained hv the conference. The representa
tives voted to make all athletes in the PCC
have a 2.5 (C plus) grade point average in
high school before being able to compete in
conference athletics. This rule will take effect
in 1960.
