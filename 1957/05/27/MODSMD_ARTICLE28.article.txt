against USC and UCLA, the
crowd greeted'Herrmann with a
tremendous chorus of boos when

Coliseum Marks Better
Marks on the whole were bet
ter at the Coliseum, since many
of the athletes were too tired
from Friday's competition and
the long trip Saturday to run
their best at Modesto.
Tom Courtney was easily the
star of the weekend as he roared
to a new world's record of 1:46.8
in the 880 at the Coliseum. He
cracked Lon Spurrier's former
standard by seven • tenths of a
second.
Occidental also hung up a new
world mark Friday when the
quartet of Tod White, Dave Reis
bord, Larry Wray and Ty Hadley
combined to run the two-mile re
lay in 7:22.7. The Tigers broke
their own record of 7:26.6. set
last year.
Morrow in 9.4
Abilene Christian's Bobby Mor
row broke the 29-year-old Coli
seum track record of 9.5 when
he sprinted the 100 in 9.4. He
skipped the Modesto meet, noti
fying officials that he felt "slight
ly ill."
The Coliseum's "Miracle Mile"
turned into a great competitive
race, but did not produce a sub
four-minute clocking. Merv Lin
coln of Australia hung back most
of the way, and then came on to
win in 4:01.0.
Brian Hewson was second at
4:01.4, Leszlo Tabori was third
with an identical time, and Derek
Ibbotson finished fourth, another
two yards back.
Saturday Ibbotson revenged
his loss by kicking the final 440
in 55 seconds to beat Lincoln in
4:06.4. They both loafed the first
880 in about 2:08, but then pulled
away from the pack over the
final two laps.

desto with a jump of 24-5% in
what was termed by observers as
a "very slow pit."
An interesting sidelight to
Herrmann's Friday-night victory
was the reception given him by
sportsmanlike Los Angeles area
fans. Embittered by recent Pa
cific Coast Conference actions
against USC and UCLA, the
crowd greeted'Herrmann with a
tremendous chorus of boos when
he was introduced on the victory
stand. t

Coliseum Marks Better
Marks on the whole were bet
ter at the Coliseum, since many
of the athletes were too tired
from Friday's competition and
the long trip Saturday to run
their best at Modesto.
Tom Courtney was easily the
star of the weekend as he roared
to a new world's record of 1:46.8
in the 880 at the Coliseum. He
cracked Lon Spurrier's former
standard by seven • tenths of a
second.
Occidental also hung up a new
world mark Friday when the
quartet of Tod White, Dave Reis
bord, Larry Wray and Ty Hadley
combined to run the two-mile re
lay in 7:22.7. The Tigers broke
their own record of 7:26.6. set
last year.
Morrow in 9.4
Abilene Christian's Bobby Mor
row broke the 29-year-old Coli
seum track record of 9.5 when
he sprinted the 100 in 9.4. He
skipped the Modesto meet, noti
fying officials that he felt "slight
ly ill."
The Coliseum's "Miracle Mile"
turned into a great competitive
race, but did not produce a sub
four-minute clocking. Merv Lin
coln of Australia hung back most
of the way, and then came on to
win in 4:01.0.
Brian Hewson was second at
4:01.4, Leszlo Tabori was third
with an identical time, and Derek
Ibbotson finished fourth, another
two yards back.
Saturday Ibbotson revenged
his loss by kicking the final 440
in 55 seconds to beat Lincoln in
4:06.4. They both loafed the first
880 in about 2:08, but then pulled
away from the pack over the
final two laps.
Other Good Marks
Among other good efforts in
Friday's meet were sprint relay
clockings of 40.0 and 1:23.9 by
Texas, Milt Campbell's 13.6 up
set of Olympic champion Lee Cal
houn in the highs, Parry O'Bri
en's 181-10 discus effort, Bob Gu

er pair of watches to his collec
tion and racked up his 10th and
11th straight wins in the broad
jump as he won the Coliseum Re
lays and California Relays cham
pionships Friday and Saturday.
Herrmann captured first place
, in the tough Los Angeles Coli
seum pit willi a leap of 24-9%
Friday. Saturday, he won at Mo
desto with a jump of 24-5% in
what was termed by observers as
a "very slow pit."
An interesting sidelight to
Herrmann's Friday-night victory
was the reception given him by
sportsmanlike Los Angeles area
fans. Embittered by recent Pa
cific Coast Conference actions
against USC and UCLA, the
crowd greeted'Herrmann with a
tremendous chorus of boos when
he was introduced on the victory
stand. t
Holdan Hits Best
Hank Roldan ami Fred Peters
paeh placed for Stanford in both
of the weekend attractions. Rol

life as he placed fourth at the

14.1-2 split as he outsped speedy
Ancel Robinson of Fresno State
and PCC champion Bob Lawson
of USC.
At Modesto, Cobb got a bad
start and failed to place.
Another of many improve
ments by Payton Jordan's men

the race in 2:04.8.
