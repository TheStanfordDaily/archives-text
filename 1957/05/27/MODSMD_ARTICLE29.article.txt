### Jack, Rannells 
Defense, as advertised, key
noted Stanford's final spring
scrimmage as the White team
turned the few exceptions into a
13-9 victory over the Reds in the
Stadium grid battle Saturday.
A sun • bathed crowd of 1500
saw two lines stifle almost every
attempt by the opponents' back
field to mount an offensive
thrust.
The exceptions:
Jack Douglas, quarterbaeking
the Whites, swept to his right in
the first quarter, jumped and
tossed a 30-yard aerial to half
back Jim Sinnerud, who packed
the ball the remaining 37 yards
to the goal line.
Shortly thereafter Noel Robin
son and Russ Steele and, in fact,
half of the Red squad got their
side on the board by trapping
halfback Chuck Shea in the end
zone for a safety.
The score remained at 6-2 until
late in the third quarter, when
freshman quarterback Dick Nor
man passed for 24 yards to end
Dick Stein for the Reds' only
touchdown. A1 Napoleon ran

over for the extra point, making
it 9-6, Reds.
Final score of the game came
in the final quarter when fresh
man halfback Dick Bowers cap
ped a 32-yard White drive, going
eight yards over right end. Spe
cialist Norm Swope converted.
Probably the highlight of the
game from the spectators' stand
point was Rick McMillen's 65-
yard first - quarter punt return.
Another outstanding offensive
play—on a day of defense—was
Jeri McMillan's circus catch of
Norman's 40-yard pitch late in
the game.
