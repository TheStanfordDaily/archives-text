# Husky Oarsmen Score Sweep Over Cards in Three Regattas
## Washington Varsity Swamps SU by 5Â¼ Lengths To Sink Hopes for West Coast Rowing Crown 
### Dean Stewart, Sports Editor 
Washington's crew swept all three regattas Saturday morning
at the Redwood City Yacht Harbor, thus sinking the hopes of the
Stanford varsity eight for a West Coast championship and an un
defeated season.
The Husky varsity shell edged away from the Indians at the start

of Ihe three - mile course and
gradually pulled away during ihe
rest of the race. When they
crossed the finish line 5V4 boat
lengths of water separated the
two shells.
Washington started wilh a 30
stroke, with the Indians one
stroke higher. The first 1V2 miles
the Huskies kept their stroke be
tween 30 and 31. The Indians
were generally a stroke higher.
Couldn't (Jain Wat<'r
Stanford upped its stroke to 32
in the last half of the race but
was unable to gain water on the
smooth-rowing Washington oars
men. The Huskies crossed the
finish line in 15:44 and the In
dians finished 21 seconds later.
The Washington JV boat and
the frosh shell scored seven- and
7 X A-length victories over the In
dians, repeating a sweep they
scored over Stanford last year on
Lake Washington.
Tide Helps JV's
The Husky JV's won their
three-mile race in 15:00, 28 sec
onds ahead of Stanford's num
ber 2 shell. Both number 2 boats
rowed a faster time than either
of the varsity shells because of
the favoring incoming tidal con
ditions.
Washington's frosh dunked the
Papooses by 7% lengths in their
two - mile regatta.
Saturday's regattas marked
the close of the Husky rowing
season. Washington has been
banned from the IRA rowing
classic to be held in Syracuse
next month. Stanford is slated
to meet Wisconsin on the way
East to the IRA.
May Forego IRA
However, after the Washing
ton loss some of the varsity oars
mbn talked of by-passing the
IRA this year because of their
poor showing against the Hus
kies.
Card coach Lou Lindsey still
figures the Indians have a good
varsity crew capable of a good
showing in Syracuse. "We didn't
row our best today," said Lind
sey. "We've done much better in
practice and I think we have a
chance back East."
Just what action the crew will
take will be determined in a
meeting this week.

Stanford upped its stroke to 32
in the last half of the race but
was unable to gain water on the
smooth-rowing Washington oars
men. The Huskies crossed the
finish line in 15:44 and the In
dians finished 21 seconds later.
The Washington JV boat and
the frosh shell scored seven- and
7 X A-length victories over the In
dians, repeating a sweep they
scored over Stanford last year on
Lake Washington.
Tide Helps JV's
The Husky JV's won their
three-mile race in 15:00, 28 sec
onds ahead of Stanford's num
ber 2 shell. Both number 2 boats
rowed a faster time than either
of the varsity shells because of
the favoring incoming tidal con
ditions.
Washington's frosh dunked the
Papooses by 7% lengths in their
two - mile regatta.
Saturday's regattas marked
the close of the Husky rowing
season. Washington has been
banned from the IRA rowing
classic to be held in Syracuse
next month. Stanford is slated
to meet Wisconsin on the way
East to the IRA.
May Forego IRA
However, after the Washing
ton loss some of the varsity oars
mbn talked of by-passing the
IRA this year because of their
poor showing against the Hus
kies.
Card coach Lou Lindsey still
figures the Indians have a good
varsity crew capable of a good
showing in Syracuse. "We didn't
row our best today," said Lind
sey. "We've done much better in
practice and I think we have a
chance back East."
Just what action the crew will
take will be determined in a
meeting this week.
