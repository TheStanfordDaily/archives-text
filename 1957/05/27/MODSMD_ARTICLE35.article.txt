VALEDICTORY
With this column I complete my third year of writing
for Philip Morris.
It has been my custom in the final column of each
year to forego any attempts at humor, because you, dear
readers, have had your funnybones so frozen by the cold
wind of impending final exams that it is futile to try to
get a laugh out of you; and because in this last column
of the year we are saying goodbye, and goodbyes are
occasions for sweet solemnity, not slapdash foolery.
Today my heart is full. I am grateful, first of all, to
the Philip Morris Company who make this column pos
sible. They have given me a completely free hand in the
choice of subject matter; they have not tampered in any
way with my copy; they have been unfailingly courteous
and helpful. I wish to take this occasion to extend heart
felt thanks to the makers of Philip Morris for their most
touching kindness, and to notify them that if we renew
our association for another year, I shall require a sub
stantial increase in salary.
Second, I should like to tender my thanks to you,
dear readers. A writer's life is not an easy one. There
are an appalling number of hazards—a drought of ideas,
for one; catching your necktie in the roller of your type
writer, for another—and when a writer is blessed, as I
have been, with an audience as alert, as bright, as intelli
gent as you, dear readers, then he must take his hat in
his hand and his necktie out of the typewriter and humbly
give thanks.

This, dear readers, T now do. Thanks for being dear.
Thanks for being readers.
Finally, I wish to thank the tobacconists of America
who make it possible for us to buy our Philip Morris
Cigarettes by the pack. If there were no tobacconists,
we should have to buy our Philip Morrises direct from
the factory in boxcar lots. This would present grave
storage problems to those of us who live in dormitories
and other substandard dwellings.
I hope, by the way, that you have been to your tobac
conist's lately and bought some Philip Morris Cigarettes.
] have been trying to beguile you into smoking Philip
Morris Cigarettes by means of what advertising men
call the "soft sell." Indeed. I have occasionally gone
beyond the soft sell into the "limp" or '"flabby" sell. I
hope my pulpy merchandising has had its effect, for here
is an enchanting cigarette, pure, natural pleasure, a joy,
a jewel, a haven to the storm-tossed, a bower to the weary.
And in addition to being a haven, a bower, and all like
that, Philip Morris is a boon to the absent minded. No
matter which end you light, you're right!
And so goodbye. Go in peace, go in content. May
good fortune attend your ventures, may love and laughter
brighten the corners where you are. See you, hey.

It's hrrn a great pleasure for us. the makers of Philip Mitrris,
to hring you thin monument tit the soft sell rnrh iceek. Till
next year, goodbye, good lurk, and good smoking — iritli
natural Philip Morris, of rorris!
