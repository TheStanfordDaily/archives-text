# LINEAR ACCELERATOR
## Scientists Study High-Speed Atom Particles in Huge Tube 
### Terry Coddington 
While the campus sleeps, 600
million electron volts are being
generated at the W. W. Hansen
High-Energy Physics Laboratory.
There, in a 200-foot tube, elec
trons are being accelerated to the
speed of light on the crest of an
electromagnetic wave. This is the
work of Stanford's linear electron
accelerator, one of the most ad
vanced machines of its type in the
world.
Here professors Wolfgang Pa
nofsky and Robert Hofstader and
a group of Stanford physicists
study the effects of bombarding
various materials with high-speed
electrons, using the linear accel
erator as their "rifle."
Specialized Tool
The linear accelerator is a spe
cialized tool, 'one of a group of
atomic particle accelerators which
include the cyclotron, the syn
chrotron, the bevatron and the
drift-tube accelerator. The cyclo
tron which likewise accelerates
atomic particles to high speeds,
but in a spiral path—is possibly
better known than the linear ac
celerator, which was conceived
first.
Gustaf Ising of Sweden in 1924
suggested the linear accelerator,
and Ernest O. Lawrence and Da
vid H. Sloan of the University of
California were the first to build
one using radio-frequency power.
Klystron Tube
This mode of generating power
limited their acceleration poten
tials, however, and it wasn't until
the late W. W. Hansen of Stan
fold, in his search for a more
efficient m e a rfs of developing
high-frequency radio voltages, de
veloped the klystron tube, which
is now used on the Stanford lin
ear accelerator, that the linear
machine reached its present po
tential.
During the war Hansen's work
led to the development of power
ful radio - frequency generators
and microwave radio and radar.
After the war he turned once
more to the problem of acceler
ating electrons and heavier par
ticles from the atom's nucleus,
such as the proton, which weighs
about 1850 times as much as the
electron.
Larger Currents
Some machines are developed
to handle these heavier particles,
but for the electron the linear
machine has been found capable
of deliver ing larger currents than
the circular machines.
It is also easier to "aim" ihan
the cyclotron, in which the par
ticle is pulled from its track by
centrifugal force.
In the Stanford machine, de
signer! for- a total power input of
400 million watts, a set of klystron
amplifiers is located every 10 feet
along the tube of the accelerator.
Each 10-foot section, then, re
ceives a 20 million-watt surge of
power.
Tubes Are Cooled
Due to this great power load,
the tubes are cooled with liquid
nitrogen d u ring operation and
still must be replaced frequently.
Occurring in rapid sequence
along the tube, the power surges
give the particles within the tube
repeated "kicks" which may be
compared to a surfboard rider'
catching the crests of a series of
waves.
After reaching their maximum
velocity, approaching the speed
of light, further acceleration
causes the particles to appear
more massive.
At the end of the accelerator
tube the particles pass through
several magnetic fields which re
flect. and focus them, "sorting"
the particles according to velocity
and mass to form a uniform, con
centrated beam which can be fo
cused upon the target.
The Target Area
In the target area, solidly insu
lated by earth and concrete, 30
tons of equipment, which contains
the target material, may be mov-

Ed about on tracks and beams for
various experiments.
The action of electrons may be
observed for focusing by training
them on a zinc sulfide screen
which fluoresces when struck by
electrons, much like a television
screen. This screen is not watch
ed directly, however, but is ob
served through a series of mir
rors and a telescope.
Linear machines have presented
engineering problems which are
still not solved as satisfactorily
as those of their circular brothers,
however, and cost more to main
tain, according to an article by
Panofsky written on Stanford's
linear electron accelerator for the
magazine Scientific American.
Much Improvement
But much improvement has
been made in recent years, and
the machine presents greater pos
sibilties at even higher energy
ranges.
Some of the problems created
by the great power requirements
can be relieved by building a long
er machine, accelerating ihe elec
trons over- a greater distance with
"kicks" of lower power.
This is one of the reasons for
the two-mile accelerator proposed
by Stanford.
The present machine is oper
ated on Stanford-built klystron
tubes, since these are not avail
able from commercial sources.
Due also to the high-energy re
quirements and radiation, the ac
celerator is operated at night and
the power is supplied in pulses.
Mrs. Phyllis Hanson sits at the
massive control board behind the
accelerator to control and check
its operation.
The end product of all this ac
tivity is papers on the behavior
of subatomic particles accelerated
to high speeds .and their effect
on the target materials used.
Several firms are now produc
ing small (4-15 MP3V) machines
commercially for cancer research,
radiography and food preserva
tion.

While the campus sleeps, 600
million electron volts are being
generated at the W. W. Hansen
High-Energy Physics Laboratory.
There, in a 200-foot tube, elec
trons are being accelerated to the
speed of light on the crest of an
electromagnetic wave. This is the
work of Stanford's linear electron
accelerator, one of the most ad
vanced machines of its type in the
world.
Here professors Wolfgang Pa
nofsky and Robert Hofstader and
a group of Stanford physicists
study the effects of bombarding
various materials with high-speed
electrons, using the linear accel
erator as their "rifle."
Specialized Tool
The linear accelerator is a spe
cialized tool, 'one of a group of
atomic particle accelerators which
include the cyclotron, the syn
chrotron, the bevatron and the
drift-tube accelerator. The cyclo
tron which likewise accelerates
atomic particles to high speeds,
but in a spiral path—is possibly
better known than the linear ac
celerator, which was conceived
first.
Gustaf Ising of Sweden in 1924
suggested the linear accelerator,
and Ernest O. Lawrence and Da
vid H. Sloan of the University of
California were the first to build
one using radio-frequency power.
Klystron Tube
This mode of generating power
limited their acceleration poten
tials, however, and it wasn't until
the late W. W. Hansen of Stan
fold, in his search for a more
efficient m e a rfs of developing
high-frequency radio voltages, de
veloped the klystron tube, which
is now used on the Stanford lin
ear accelerator, that the linear
machine reached its present po
tential.
During the war Hansen's work
led to the development of power
ful radio - frequency generators
and microwave radio and radar.
After the war he turned once
more to the problem of acceler
ating electrons and heavier par
ticles from the atom's nucleus,
such as the proton, which weighs
about 1850 times as much as the
electron.
Larger Currents
Some machines are developed
to handle these heavier particles,
but for the electron the linear
machine has been found capable
of deliver ing larger currents than
the circular machines.
It is also easier to "aim" ihan
the cyclotron, in which the par
ticle is pulled from its track by
centrifugal force.
In the Stanford machine, de
signer! for- a total power input of
400 million watts, a set of klystron
amplifiers is located every 10 feet
along the tube of the accelerator.
Each 10-foot section, then, re
ceives a 20 million-watt surge of
power.
Tubes Are Cooled
Due to this great power load,
the tubes are cooled with liquid
nitrogen d u ring operation and
still must be replaced frequently.
Occurring in rapid sequence
along the tube, the power surges
give the particles within the tube
repeated "kicks" which may be
compared to a surfboard rider'
catching the crests of a series of
waves.
After reaching their maximum
velocity, approaching the speed
of light, further acceleration
causes the particles to appear
more massive.
At the end of the accelerator
tube the particles pass through
several magnetic fields which re
flect. and focus them, "sorting"
the particles according to velocity
and mass to form a uniform, con
centrated beam which can be fo
cused upon the target.
The Target Area
In the target area, solidly insu
lated by earth and concrete, 30
tons of equipment, which contains
the target material, may be mov-

Ed about on tracks and beams for
various experiments.
The action of electrons may be
observed for focusing by training
them on a zinc sulfide screen
which fluoresces when struck by
electrons, much like a television
screen. This screen is not watch
ed directly, however, but is ob
served through a series of mir
rors and a telescope.
Linear machines have presented
engineering problems which are
still not solved as satisfactorily
as those of their circular brothers,
however, and cost more to main
tain, according to an article by
Panofsky written on Stanford's
linear electron accelerator for the
magazine Scientific American.
Much Improvement
But much improvement has
been made in recent years, and
the machine presents greater pos
sibilties at even higher energy
ranges.
Some of the problems created
by the great power requirements
can be relieved by building a long
er machine, accelerating ihe elec
trons over- a greater distance with
"kicks" of lower power.
This is one of the reasons for
the two-mile accelerator proposed
by Stanford.
The present machine is oper
ated on Stanford-built klystron
tubes, since these are not avail
able from commercial sources.
Due also to the high-energy re
quirements and radiation, the ac
celerator is operated at night and
the power is supplied in pulses.

er machine, accelerating ihe elec
trons over- a greater distance with
"kicks" of lower power.
This is one of the reasons for
the two-mile accelerator proposed
by Stanford.
The present machine is oper
ated on Stanford-built klystron
tubes, since these are not avail
able from commercial sources.
Due also to the high-energy re
quirements and radiation, the ac
celerator is operated at night and
the power is supplied in pulses.
Mrs. Phyllis Hanson sits at the
massive control board behind the
accelerator to control and check
its operation.
The end product of all this ac
tivity is papers on the behavior
of subatomic particles accelerated
to high speeds .and their effect
on the target materials used.
Several firms are now produc
ing small (4-15 MP3V) machines
commercially for cancer research,
radiography and food preserva
tion.
While the campus sleeps, 600
million electron volts are being
generated at the W. W. Hansen
High-Energy Physics Laboratory.
There, in a 200-foot tube, elec
trons are being accelerated to the
speed of light on the crest of an
electromagnetic wave. This is the
work of Stanford's linear electron
accelerator, one of the most ad
vanced machines of its type in the
world.
Here professors Wolfgang Pa
nofsky and Robert Hofstader and
a group of Stanford physicists
study the effects of bombarding
various materials with high-speed
electrons, using the linear accel
erator as their "rifle."
Specialized Tool
The linear accelerator is a spe
cialized tool, 'one of a group of
atomic particle accelerators which
include the cyclotron, the syn
chrotron, the bevatron and the
drift-tube accelerator. The cyclo
tron which likewise accelerates
atomic particles to high speeds,
but in a spiral path—is possibly
better known than the linear ac
celerator, which was conceived
first.
Gustaf Ising of Sweden in 1924
suggested the linear accelerator,
and Ernest O. Lawrence and Da
vid H. Sloan of the University of
California were the first to build
one using radio-frequency power.
Klystron Tube
This mode of generating power
limited their acceleration poten
tials, however, and it wasn't until
the late W. W. Hansen of Stan
fold, in his search for a more
efficient m e a rfs of developing
high-frequency radio voltages, de
veloped the klystron tube, which
is now used on the Stanford lin
ear accelerator, that the linear
machine reached its present po
tential.
During the war Hansen's work
led to the development of power
ful radio - frequency generators
and microwave radio and radar.
After the war he turned once
more to the problem of acceler
ating electrons and heavier par
ticles from the atom's nucleus,
such as the proton, which weighs
about 1850 times as much as the
electron.
Larger Currents
Some machines are developed
to handle these heavier particles,
but for the electron the linear
machine has been found capable
of deliver ing larger currents than
the circular machines.
It is also easier to "aim" ihan
the cyclotron, in which the par
ticle is pulled from its track by
centrifugal force.
In the Stanford machine, de
signer! for- a total power input of
400 million watts, a set of klystron
amplifiers is located every 10 feet
along the tube of the accelerator.
Each 10-foot section, then, re
ceives a 20 million-watt surge of
power.
Tubes Are Cooled
Due to this great power load,
the tubes are cooled with liquid
nitrogen d u ring operation and
still must be replaced frequently.
Occurring in rapid sequence
along the tube, the power surges
give the particles within the tube
repeated "kicks" which may be
compared to a surfboard rider'
catching the crests of a series of
waves.
After reaching their maximum
velocity, approaching the speed
of light, further acceleration
causes the particles to appear
more massive.
At the end of the accelerator
tube the particles pass through
several magnetic fields which re
flect. and focus them, "sorting"
the particles according to velocity
and mass to form a uniform, con
centrated beam which can be fo
cused upon the target.
The Target Area
In the target area, solidly insu
lated by earth and concrete, 30
tons of equipment, which contains
the target material, may be mov-

Ed about on tracks and beams for
various experiments.
The action of electrons may be
observed for focusing by training
them on a zinc sulfide screen
which fluoresces when struck by
electrons, much like a television
screen. This screen is not watch
ed directly, however, but is ob
served through a series of mir
rors and a telescope.
Linear machines have presented
engineering problems which are
still not solved as satisfactorily
as those of their circular brothers,
however, and cost more to main
tain, according to an article by
Panofsky written on Stanford's
linear electron accelerator for the
magazine Scientific American.
Much Improvement
But much improvement has
been made in recent years, and
the machine presents greater pos
sibilties at even higher energy
ranges.

by the great power requirements
