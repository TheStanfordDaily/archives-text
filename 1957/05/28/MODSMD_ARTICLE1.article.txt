# Evidence Mounts Against Beach Attack Suspects
## SU Witnesses Say Keiser Hit By Rutherdale Marks Pleads Guilty To Kicking Charges, Arrested Second Time 
### John Lane 
Evidence piled up against at
least one of (ho defendants in the
trial yesterday of Donald Ruther
dale, 19, and Donald Hawkins, 18,
suspects in an attack on a Stan
ford beach party.
The evidence against Ruther
dale was corroborated in yester
day's session by five Stanford wit
nesses. All but one identified Ru
therdale as wielder of the weapon
that felled Dean Keiser, 20, a
Stanford junior.
One of the youths previously
scheduled to go on trial yesterday
was not there. Louis Marks, 19,
last Friday pleaded guilty to the
felony assault charges against
him.
In a special session before Su
perior Court Judge Aylett Cotton,
Marks surprised the press by
pleading guilty to "assault with
force resulting in great physical
injury"—the same charge pend
ing against the other two defend
ants. He had pleaded innocent in
his April 26 preliminary hearing.
Evidence of Kicking
Evidence that Marks had kicked
Keiser on the head while he was
lying stunned on the ground after
Rutherdale's attack was apparent
ly too much for the defense. The
judge set June 10 as the date for
Marks' sentencing.
Last week Marks had been ar
rested again in Redwood City on
charges of vagrancy, disturbing
the peace and resisting arrest.
Evidence against Rutherdale
was corroborated again and again
by the prosecution's witnesses.
Under questioning by the prose
cutor, Deputy District Attorney
Allison Rouse, the facts began to
take shape something like this:
About to Leave
At about 10 on the night of
April 12. as the Stanford students
were about to leave San Gregorio
beach, a group of men from an
other campfire came over to bor
row wood.
"They grabbed the firewood,"
said witness David F. Lindsley, 21.
The group came back twice and
the second time started making
"jibes and jeers" toward members
of the Stanford party. "They bel
ligerently made comments," said
one witness.
One of the defendants hit Ralph
Schaefer with a piece of wood
that, was variously described as
being between four and six feet
long and four to 14 inches wide.
All witnesses, however, agreed
that the attacker, probably Ruth
erdale, swung the wood at Schae
fer's head "like a baseball bat."
Principal Antagonizer
Rutherdale was also described
as being the principal antagonizer
of the group. Three of the wit
nesses Schaefer, John M. James,
20, and Peter Trotter, 20 said
Rutherdale had hit them. Linds
ley said Rutherdale kept "pushing
everybody around."
Very little evidence was pre
sented against Hawkins. Schaefer
testified that Hawkins had kicked
Keiser while the latter was on the
ground. However, none of the
other witnesses could positively
identify Hawkins as the kicker.
Defense counsel for Rutherdale,
Dennis L. Woodman of Palo Alto,
tried throughout to prove that
none of the injuries suffered by
the witnesses was severe enough
to warrant the charge of "great
bodily injury."
Prosecutor's Object
Prosecutor Rouse said later,
however, that his object was
merely to prove that the force
used could have resulted in
injury, even though it may not
have.
Schaefer said lie did not see
Rutherdale have physical contact
with Keiser.
Trotter said, however, that Ru
therdale kept challenging Keiser
after Keiser tried to talk to him.
Trotter said that Rutherdale told
Keiser: "Come on and fight me.
You have glasses on; I won't hit
you in the face."
According to Trotter's testimo
ny, Rutherdale then hit Keiser
and fried to kick him. Witness
Louise Eraser, a freshman from
Roble Hall, said Rutherdale actu
ally kicked Keiser, while other
witnesses said he only tried.
The witnesses were divided as
to whether Rutherdale actually
knocked Keiser's glasses off, al
though the testimony seemed to
prove that he was knocked to the
ground by Rutherdale's attack.

were about to leave San Gregorio
beach, a group of men from an
other campfire came over to bor
row wood.
"They grabbed the firewood,"
said witness David F. Lindsley, 21.
The group came back twice and
the second time started making
"jibes and jeers" toward members
of the Stanford party. "They bel
ligerently made comments," said
one witness.
One of the defendants hit Ralph
Schaefer with a piece of wood
that, was variously described as
being between four and six feet
long and four to 14 inches wide.
All witnesses, however, agreed
that the attacker, probably Ruth
erdale, swung the wood at Schae
fer's head "like a baseball bat."
Principal Antagonizer
Rutherdale was also described
as being the principal antagonizer
of the group. Three of the wit
nesses Schaefer, John M. James,
20, and Peter Trotter, 20 said
Rutherdale had hit them. Linds
ley said Rutherdale kept "pushing
everybody around."
Very little evidence was pre
sented against Hawkins. Schaefer
testified that Hawkins had kicked
Keiser while the latter was on the
ground. However, none of the
other witnesses could positively
identify Hawkins as the kicker.
Defense counsel for Rutherdale,
Dennis L. Woodman of Palo Alto,
tried throughout to prove that
none of the injuries suffered by
the witnesses was severe enough
to warrant the charge of "great
bodily injury."
Prosecutor's Object
Prosecutor Rouse said later,
however, that his object was
merely to prove that the force
used could have resulted in
injury, even though it may not
have.
Schaefer said lie did not see
Rutherdale have physical contact
with Keiser.
Trotter said, however, that Ru
therdale kept challenging Keiser
after Keiser tried to talk to him.
Trotter said that Rutherdale told
Keiser: "Come on and fight me.
You have glasses on; I won't hit
you in the face."
According to Trotter's testimo
ny, Rutherdale then hit Keiser
and fried to kick him. Witness
Louise Eraser, a freshman from
Roble Hall, said Rutherdale actu
ally kicked Keiser, while other
witnesses said he only tried.
The witnesses were divided as
to whether Rutherdale actually
knocked Keiser's glasses off, al
though the testimony seemed to
prove that he was knocked to the
ground by Rutherdale's attack.

Evidence piled up against at
least one of (ho defendants in the
trial yesterday of Donald Ruther
dale, 19, and Donald Hawkins, 18,
suspects in an attack on a Stan
ford beach party.
The evidence against Ruther
dale was corroborated in yester
day's session by five Stanford wit
nesses. All but one identified Ru
therdale as wielder of the weapon
that felled Dean Keiser, 20, a
Stanford junior.
One of the youths previously
scheduled to go on trial yesterday
was not there. Louis Marks, 19,
last Friday pleaded guilty to the
felony assault charges against
him.
In a special session before Su
perior Court Judge Aylett Cotton,
Marks surprised the press by
pleading guilty to "assault with
force resulting in great physical
injury"—the same charge pend
ing against the other two defend
ants. He had pleaded innocent in
his April 26 preliminary hearing.
Evidence of Kicking
Evidence that Marks had kicked
Keiser on the head while he was
lying stunned on the ground after
Rutherdale's attack was apparent
ly too much for the defense. The
judge set June 10 as the date for
Marks' sentencing.
Last week Marks had been ar
rested again in Redwood City on
charges of vagrancy, disturbing
the peace and resisting arrest.
Evidence against Rutherdale
was corroborated again and again
by the prosecution's witnesses.
Under questioning by the prose
cutor, Deputy District Attorney
Allison Rouse, the facts began to
take shape something like this:

with Keiser.
Trotter said, however, that Ru
therdale kept challenging Keiser
after Keiser tried to talk to him.
Trotter said that Rutherdale told
Keiser: "Come on and fight me.
You have glasses on; I won't hit
you in the face."
According to Trotter's testimo
ny, Rutherdale then hit Keiser
and fried to kick him. Witness
Louise Eraser, a freshman from
Roble Hall, said Rutherdale actu
ally kicked Keiser, while other
witnesses said he only tried.
The witnesses were divided as
to whether Rutherdale actually
knocked Keiser's glasses off, al
though the testimony seemed to
prove that he was knocked to the
ground by Rutherdale's attack.

AT REDWOOD CITY —Principal figures of interest and specta

wait in the hall of San Mateo County Hall of Justice. Rutherdale
and Hawkins are being tried for their alleged attack on a Stanford
beach party. Rutherdale's latest escapade, avoiding arrest for
speeding, put him in jail for the night before the trial and caused
the dismissal of the jury.

Evidence piled up against at
least one of (ho defendants in the
trial yesterday of Donald Ruther
dale, 19, and Donald Hawkins, 18,
suspects in an attack on a Stan
ford beach party.
The evidence against Ruther
dale was corroborated in yester
day's session by five Stanford wit
nesses. All but one identified Ru
therdale as wielder of the weapon
that felled Dean Keiser, 20, a
Stanford junior.
One of the youths previously
scheduled to go on trial yesterday
was not there. Louis Marks, 19,
last Friday pleaded guilty to the
felony assault charges against
him.
In a special session before Su
perior Court Judge Aylett Cotton,
Marks surprised the press by
pleading guilty to "assault with
force resulting in great physical
injury"—the same charge pend
ing against the other two defend
ants. He had pleaded innocent in
his April 26 preliminary hearing.
Evidence of Kicking
Evidence that Marks had kicked
Keiser on the head while he was
lying stunned on the ground after
Rutherdale's attack was apparent
ly too much for the defense. The
judge set June 10 as the date for
Marks' sentencing.
Last week Marks had been ar
rested again in Redwood City on
charges of vagrancy, disturbing
the peace and resisting arrest.
Evidence against Rutherdale
was corroborated again and again
by the prosecution's witnesses.
Under questioning by the prose
cutor, Deputy District Attorney
Allison Rouse, the facts began to
take shape something like this:
About to Leave
At about 10 on the night of
April 12. as the Stanford students
were about to leave San Gregorio
beach, a group of men from an
other campfire came over to bor
row wood.
"They grabbed the firewood,"
said witness David F. Lindsley, 21.
The group came back twice and
the second time started making
"jibes and jeers" toward members
of the Stanford party. "They bel
ligerently made comments," said
one witness.
One of the defendants hit Ralph
Schaefer with a piece of wood
that, was variously described as
being between four and six feet
long and four to 14 inches wide.
All witnesses, however, agreed
that the attacker, probably Ruth
erdale, swung the wood at Schae
fer's head "like a baseball bat."
Principal Antagonizer
Rutherdale was also described
as being the principal antagonizer
of the group. Three of the wit
nesses Schaefer, John M. James,
20, and Peter Trotter, 20 said
Rutherdale had hit them. Linds
ley said Rutherdale kept "pushing
everybody around."
Very little evidence was pre
sented against Hawkins. Schaefer
testified that Hawkins had kicked
Keiser while the latter was on the
ground. However, none of the
other witnesses could positively
identify Hawkins as the kicker.
Defense counsel for Rutherdale,
Dennis L. Woodman of Palo Alto,
tried throughout to prove that
none of the injuries suffered by
the witnesses was severe enough
to warrant the charge of "great
bodily injury."
Prosecutor's Object
Prosecutor Rouse said later,
however, that his object was
merely to prove that the force
used could have resulted in
injury, even though it may not
have.
Schaefer said lie did not see
Rutherdale have physical contact
with Keiser.
Trotter said, however, that Ru
therdale kept challenging Keiser
after Keiser tried to talk to him.
Trotter said that Rutherdale told
Keiser: "Come on and fight me.
