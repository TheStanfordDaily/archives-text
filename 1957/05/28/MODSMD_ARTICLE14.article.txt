# Formosa Rioters Attacked U.S. Embassy Code Room In Anti-American Surge
## Definite Organization Indicated; Code Readjustment Necessary 
### 
TAIPEI, May 27 (UP) U.S. officials said today that "definitely
organized" rioters, aimed with axes, concentrated on smashing their
way into the secret code room in their assault on the American em
bassy here last Friday.
The officials Said the anti-American riots possibly were organized
by internal political elements! —

wanting to take over and make
a deal with the Chinese Commu
nists.
The sources said any such ele
ments might have acted with the
idea they could further their aim
by straining U.S.-Nationalist re
lations by anti-American violence
and serious destruction of U.S.
property.
Thorough Attack
The U.S. officials pointed out
the thoroughness of the attack
on the embassy, especially
against the code room. The as
sault compromised some of the
codes used by the embassy..
The sources said some of the
rioters brought axes with them
and attempted first to force the
heavy iron door guarding the
code room. When this failed,
they hacked their way through a
six - inch - thick concrete wall to
force entry into the room.
U.S. officials said ordinary
demonstrators, bent on wanton
destruction, would have gone on
to some easier target.
Means "Readjustment"
American Ambassador Karl
Rankin said the sacking of the
code room will mean "some re
adjustment" of U.S. codes. He
did not elaborate, but indicated
he was referring to the Asia-wide
code system and code communi
cations between Taipei and
Washington.
But the ambassador said this
would not be too serious or cost
ly because American officials
were prepared to make such re
adjustments.
American observers here said
they did not believe top Nation
alist government officials had
any part in the destructive riot
ing. But they blamed the slow
ness of Nationalist authorities to
intervene for the large-scale de
struction.
