# Formosan Riots and American Naivete

Nationalist China readied the lowest point last
Friday since Ceneralissimo Chiang Kai-shek
ordered General St i 11 well out of China toward
the end of the Second World War.
l itis low point in diplomatic relations was
lite result, allegedly, of a series of connected
incidents beginning with an American woman
I>:i111 i11<£ iu her home in Taipeh, Formosa; the
fatal shooting of an alleged Chinese "Peeping
loin" who is said to have attacked the irate
husband with a club, and the subsequent ac
quittal of the husband on the grounds of jus
tifiable homicide.
It is not quite clear just wherein the justifi
catiou for homicide lies. Did it stem from
some obscure principle that gives a man the
right of life or death over another because the
latter committed what Western moralists call
the crime of "Peeping Toniism," or did the
justification lie in the principle of self-defense?
I here are other questions the American pub
lic has not received I lie answers to, also. If
there was no premeditated intent to do violence
to the Peeping Tom, why did the "outraged""
husband have on him the wherewithal to fatally
shoot the ("hinese onlooker?
ith all due respect to the obviously honor
able intentions of the husband who acted to
protect his home and wife from an invasion

of privacy, we are forced to conclude that there
is more to this whole affair than meets the eye.
The rioting at the American embassy which
followed the acquittal of the American soldier
took America by surprise. But is this really
such a surprise? Formosa is one of the few
places in the Far Fast where American military
personnel are under the jurisdiction of Ameri
can military courts rather than local courts for
crimes involving the local population.
l itis in itself is cause for some resentment.
The acquittal in the eyes of the average For
mosan could only be taken as a distinct slap
in the face. Could our officials really have been
so naive as to think there would be 110 reper
cussions from the civilian population?
Whatever we choose to believe about the
justification of the killing, we must admit that
there was some cause for the anti-American
riots. That undesirable elements stepped in
and organized the rioters, there is little doubt.
Hut these opportunists will always take advan
tage of such situations to cause trouble and ill
will between governments.
et the primary fact remains; were there no
incident, there would not have been any oppor
tunity for the undesirable elements to make
their destructive moves. The United States,
unfortunately, is not completlv innocent nor
free from taint in this period of strained re
lations.

ordered General St i 11 well out of China toward
the end of the Second World War.
l itis low point in diplomatic relations was
lite result, allegedly, of a series of connected
incidents beginning with an American woman
I>:i111 i11<£ iu her home in Taipeh, Formosa; the
fatal shooting of an alleged Chinese "Peeping
loin" who is said to have attacked the irate
husband with a club, and the subsequent ac
quittal of the husband on the grounds of jus
tifiable homicide.
It is not quite clear just wherein the justifi
catiou for homicide lies. Did it stem from
some obscure principle that gives a man the
right of life or death over another because the
latter committed what Western moralists call
the crime of "Peeping Toniism," or did the
justification lie in the principle of self-defense?
I here are other questions the American pub
lic has not received I lie answers to, also. If
there was no premeditated intent to do violence
to the Peeping Tom, why did the "outraged""
husband have on him the wherewithal to fatally
shoot the ("hinese onlooker?
ith all due respect to the obviously honor
able intentions of the husband who acted to
protect his home and wife from an invasion

of privacy, we are forced to conclude that there
is more to this whole affair than meets the eye.
The rioting at the American embassy which
followed the acquittal of the American soldier
took America by surprise. But is this really
such a surprise? Formosa is one of the few
places in the Far Fast where American military
personnel are under the jurisdiction of Ameri
can military courts rather than local courts for
crimes involving the local population.
l itis in itself is cause for some resentment.
The acquittal in the eyes of the average For
mosan could only be taken as a distinct slap
in the face. Could our officials really have been
so naive as to think there would be 110 reper
cussions from the civilian population?
Whatever we choose to believe about the
justification of the killing, we must admit that
there was some cause for the anti-American
riots. That undesirable elements stepped in
and organized the rioters, there is little doubt.
Hut these opportunists will always take advan
tage of such situations to cause trouble and ill
will between governments.
et the primary fact remains; were there no
incident, there would not have been any oppor

their destructive moves. The United States,
unfortunately, is not completlv innocent nor
free from taint in this period of strained re
