# Berlin, KEIO University Students Selected To Attend Stanford on Exchange Program
## 
### 
The Free University of Berlin
and KEIO University Affiliations
Committees have announced the
names of two foreign students
who will receive scholarships to
attend Stanford next year.
The students are Tadashi Saku

rai from KEIO University, Japan,
and Robert Gottwald from the
Free University of Berlin.
Both the Free University of Ber
lin and the KEIO University Af
filiations Committees bring stu
dents to Stanford each year and,
through similar Stanford Affilia
tions Committees at the two uni
versities, offer scholarships to
Stanford students for study at
Berlin or KEIO.
Stanford student Bud* Marshall
recently won an exchange schol
arship and will be at KEIO Uni
versity next year.
Sakurai is an economics major
and will live at the Phi Sigma
Kappa house and Stern Hall while
attending Stanford. At KEIO Uni
versity Sakurai is a member of
the English Speaking Society and
the International Student Associ
ation of Japan, of which he is
president.
He was a Japanese delegate to
the second Asian Students' Forum
held at Manila in 1955. Last year
he went on the International Stu
dent Study Tour to Hong Kong,
a student goodwill mission.
Football, soccer, baseball and
ice skating are Sakurai's favorite
sports, and his other interests in
clude painting and reading.
Gottwald, from Erfurt, East
Germany, has studied at the Uni
versity of Freiburg as well as the
Free University of Berlin. He
plans to work for his doctorate
in modern history at Stanford and
to study at Hoover Library.
He particularly plans to take
courses in American political the
ory and modern eastern European
problems. University teaching is
his goal. His interests include
swimming, modern art and music.
The Affiliations Committees ai
Stanford wish to emphasize that

Stanford students interested in
applying for future exchange
scholarships to either KEIO Uni
versity or the Free University of
Berlin should have a knowledge
of the Japanese or German lan
guage.
