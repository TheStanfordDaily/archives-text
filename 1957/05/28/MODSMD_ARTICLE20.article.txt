The Lumberjack Axe, a nine foot monstrosity
symbolic of victory in the IISC-Chico State grid
battle, was returned recently to the Areata,
Calit., campus —as mysteriously as it disap
peared on March 28.
As the Humboldt State College Lumberjack
reported, "Four women students who share an
apartment at 370 Plaza Ave. half a block from
the campus, reported they stumbled over the
Axe on their back porch. , . . Apparently the
celebrated trophy was deposited there by the
same thieves who snatched il a month before."

News from other college campuses also re
sembles that found recently in the columns of
The Daily.
Because of kindness to animals, members of
the University of Oregon's Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority recently imitated Stanford's Con Home
Week carwashers. Several weeks ago ihe soro
) ity women found a "Speagle" puppy.
(According to the Oregon Daily Emerald, Ihe
women defined "Speagle" as a cross between a
Beagle and a Spaniel.)
Since the puppy was in ill health, the KAT
women took him to a veterinarian. The vet's bill
was $18.50. A sorority house collection netted
only $8.45.

Needing $10 more, the dog-loving sorority
women held a carwash on May 15—at $1 apiece.

Shades of the LASSU-Daily controversy — a
petition was circulated recently at San Francisco
State College to remove the editor of the Golden
Gater and appoint "a competent editor" in his
place.
The petition, brainchild of Sigma Alpha Eta
fraternity, came in spite of the fact that at the
time of circulation, only four more issues of the
Gater were to come out this year.

Northwestern, like Stanford, is having its little
fraternity problems and controversies. In a re
cent campus poll at the Evanston, 111., institu
tion, G5 of 93 persons questioned said they fell
that a fraternity woidd definitely drop socially
and respect wise if it pledged a Negro.
However, three-fourths of those polled said
they themselves would not feel differently to
ward a house with a Negro member, according
to the Daily Northwestern.
Also at Northwestern, a neighborhood group
"rose up in arms" recently at the thought of an
Nil fraternity moving into their neighborhood.
Yet that house for years had been occupied by
a Chicago mobster, a leftover from the infamous
Capone days.
Which is worse frequent water bombs or in
frequent gangland killings?
