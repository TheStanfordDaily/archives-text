# 1899 TRIP SET ALTITUDE RECORD
## 'Devil Wagon' Sped Jordan To Mount Hamilton Summit 
### Dick Frey 
lii 1899 the United States was
! viewing with some awe and quite
some alarm a contraption known
to most as the "devil wagon." This
"contraption" is known today as
the automobile.
One of the first automobiles in
this area was built by \V. L. El
liott of Oakland, who invited Stan
ford President David Starr Jordan
* t<) accompany him in 1899 on a
j rigorous test run in the "Llliott
automobile." The San Francisco
Examiner sponsored the run, to
be made on a narrow, winding
road to I lie summit of Mount
j Hamilton, over 4000 feet high.
Accompanying Elliott and Dr.
Jordan were professor Albert W.
Smith of the Stanford Mechanical
Engineering d ep a r t m en t and
Charles S. Aiken and Carl Hey
mann of the Examiner staff.
In Sunday Maga/ine
The Examiner recorded th e
event in its Sunday magazine see
i tion for Sept. 24, 1899.
The newspaper's introduction
to Dr. Jordan's account said, "This
is the highest point ever reached
by a motor carriage of any de
scription, and when the tortuous
chaiacter of the road is considered
the trip must rank among the
most wonderful feats of moun
tain climbing in world annals."
Dr. Jordan appraised the jour
ney in more conservative words.
He said ol the trip that "there
were no accidents and few inci
j dents."
The trip started at the Hotel
Vendome in San Jose on Sept. 13
as the automobile and a team of
horses departed on the 27-mile
journey to the Lick Observatory
atop Mount Hamilton.
"Tremendous" Speed
The automobile "flew along" at
| 12 to 18 m.p.h. on the San Jose
streets and left the team of horses
behind. On the grades of the
mountain this tremendous speed
; was cut to 4 m.p.h., and in a few
[daces near ihe summit the auto
; barreled along at .3 m.p.h. Ac
' cording to Dr. Jordan, "The en
| gine is sensitive to grade and to
dust, and on very heavy grades
■ she kicks stoutly with her 'hind
! legs'."
Dr. Jordan described Ihe auto
mobile as consisting of "a car
riage box mounted on low wheels
and propelled by a gasoline en
! gine in a box behind the seat."

Steering was accomplished with !
a simple handle beside the driver's
seat.
The auto reached the top of the
mountain in the "amazing" time
of 5 hours 20 minutes, not count
ing stops for repairs or other
delays. The party spent the night
at the observatory and departed
the following morning at 10.
Swift Kide Down
The "auto-tobogganists" enjoy
ed a swift ride down the moun
tain side, although one of the
"three or four" brakes was worn
out by the friction a short way
down. They arrived in San Jose
at 2:15 in the afternoon, losing
45 minutes in delays.
Dr. Jordan made lengthy obser
vations of the trip in the Exami
ner article. He emphasized that
as long as "the driver keeps his
head and makes no slips" there
was no trouble controlling the ve
hicle. "In amateur hands the de
scent of Mount Hamilton would
be certainly dangerous," he added.
"Horses look with disfavor on
the automobile, but, of the many
we met, only one did anything
more than start up a little," Dr.
Jordan observed.
Other Advantages
Other improvements engender
ed by automobile travel, accord
ing to Dr. Jordan, were the mini
mizing of dust, the ability of the
auto to cross streetcar tracks at
any angle, and the comfort of
traveling in a skillfully driven ve
hicle.
However, Dr. Jordan's views on
the automobile were not all opti
mistic. "The cost of the vehicle
makes it ... a matter of luxury."
He also pointed out the need
for mechanical skill to operate an
automobile. "I look forward to
the time when the automobile for
two shall be provided with a real
seat, as in a hansom cab, for- a
mechanical engineer in livery."
Also on the same page in Ihe
Examiner was a short article by
professor Smith titled "'The
Horse Must Soon Co,' Says Prof.
Smith."

In Sunday Maga/ine
The Examiner recorded th e
event in its Sunday magazine see
i tion for Sept. 24, 1899.
The newspaper's introduction
to Dr. Jordan's account said, "This
is the highest point ever reached
by a motor carriage of any de
scription, and when the tortuous
chaiacter of the road is considered
the trip must rank among the
most wonderful feats of moun
tain climbing in world annals."
Dr. Jordan appraised the jour
ney in more conservative words.
He said ol the trip that "there
were no accidents and few inci
j dents."
The trip started at the Hotel
Vendome in San Jose on Sept. 13
as the automobile and a team of
horses departed on the 27-mile
journey to the Lick Observatory
atop Mount Hamilton.
"Tremendous" Speed
The automobile "flew along" at
| 12 to 18 m.p.h. on the San Jose
streets and left the team of horses
behind. On the grades of the
mountain this tremendous speed
; was cut to 4 m.p.h., and in a few
[daces near ihe summit the auto
; barreled along at .3 m.p.h. Ac
' cording to Dr. Jordan, "The en
| gine is sensitive to grade and to
dust, and on very heavy grades
■ she kicks stoutly with her 'hind
! legs'."
Dr. Jordan described Ihe auto
mobile as consisting of "a car
riage box mounted on low wheels
and propelled by a gasoline en
! gine in a box behind the seat."

Steering was accomplished with !
a simple handle beside the driver's
seat.
The auto reached the top of the
mountain in the "amazing" time
of 5 hours 20 minutes, not count
ing stops for repairs or other
delays. The party spent the night
at the observatory and departed
the following morning at 10.
Swift Kide Down
The "auto-tobogganists" enjoy
ed a swift ride down the moun
tain side, although one of the
"three or four" brakes was worn
out by the friction a short way
down. They arrived in San Jose
at 2:15 in the afternoon, losing
45 minutes in delays.
Dr. Jordan made lengthy obser
vations of the trip in the Exami
ner article. He emphasized that
as long as "the driver keeps his
head and makes no slips" there
was no trouble controlling the ve
hicle. "In amateur hands the de
scent of Mount Hamilton would
be certainly dangerous," he added.
"Horses look with disfavor on
the automobile, but, of the many
we met, only one did anything
more than start up a little," Dr.
Jordan observed.
Other Advantages
Other improvements engender
ed by automobile travel, accord
ing to Dr. Jordan, were the mini
mizing of dust, the ability of the
auto to cross streetcar tracks at
any angle, and the comfort of
traveling in a skillfully driven ve
hicle.
However, Dr. Jordan's views on
the automobile were not all opti
mistic. "The cost of the vehicle
makes it ... a matter of luxury."
He also pointed out the need
for mechanical skill to operate an
automobile. "I look forward to
the time when the automobile for
two shall be provided with a real
seat, as in a hansom cab, for- a
mechanical engineer in livery."
Also on the same page in Ihe
Examiner was a short article by
professor Smith titled "'The
Horse Must Soon Co,' Says Prof.
Smith."
lii 1899 the United States was
! viewing with some awe and quite
some alarm a contraption known
to most as the "devil wagon." This
"contraption" is known today as
the automobile.
One of the first automobiles in
this area was built by \V. L. El
liott of Oakland, who invited Stan
ford President David Starr Jordan
* t<) accompany him in 1899 on a
j rigorous test run in the "Llliott
automobile." The San Francisco
Examiner sponsored the run, to
be made on a narrow, winding
road to I lie summit of Mount
j Hamilton, over 4000 feet high.

Vendome in San Jose on Sept. 13
as the automobile and a team of
horses departed on the 27-mile
journey to the Lick Observatory
atop Mount Hamilton.
"Tremendous" Speed
The automobile "flew along" at
| 12 to 18 m.p.h. on the San Jose
streets and left the team of horses
behind. On the grades of the
mountain this tremendous speed
; was cut to 4 m.p.h., and in a few
[daces near ihe summit the auto
; barreled along at .3 m.p.h. Ac
' cording to Dr. Jordan, "The en
| gine is sensitive to grade and to
dust, and on very heavy grades
■ she kicks stoutly with her 'hind
! legs'."
Dr. Jordan described Ihe auto
mobile as consisting of "a car
riage box mounted on low wheels
and propelled by a gasoline en
! gine in a box behind the seat."

Steering was accomplished with !
a simple handle beside the driver's
seat.
The auto reached the top of the
mountain in the "amazing" time
of 5 hours 20 minutes, not count
ing stops for repairs or other
delays. The party spent the night
at the observatory and departed
the following morning at 10.
Swift Kide Down
The "auto-tobogganists" enjoy
ed a swift ride down the moun
tain side, although one of the
"three or four" brakes was worn
out by the friction a short way
down. They arrived in San Jose
at 2:15 in the afternoon, losing
45 minutes in delays.
Dr. Jordan made lengthy obser
vations of the trip in the Exami
ner article. He emphasized that
as long as "the driver keeps his
head and makes no slips" there
was no trouble controlling the ve
hicle. "In amateur hands the de
scent of Mount Hamilton would
be certainly dangerous," he added.
"Horses look with disfavor on
the automobile, but, of the many
we met, only one did anything
more than start up a little," Dr.
Jordan observed.
Other Advantages
Other improvements engender
ed by automobile travel, accord
ing to Dr. Jordan, were the mini
mizing of dust, the ability of the
auto to cross streetcar tracks at
any angle, and the comfort of
traveling in a skillfully driven ve
hicle.
However, Dr. Jordan's views on
the automobile were not all opti
mistic. "The cost of the vehicle
makes it ... a matter of luxury."
He also pointed out the need
for mechanical skill to operate an
automobile. "I look forward to
the time when the automobile for
two shall be provided with a real
seat, as in a hansom cab, for- a
mechanical engineer in livery."
Also on the same page in Ihe
Examiner was a short article by
professor Smith titled "'The
Horse Must Soon Co,' Says Prof.
Smith."
lii 1899 the United States was
! viewing with some awe and quite
some alarm a contraption known
to most as the "devil wagon." This
"contraption" is known today as
the automobile.
One of the first automobiles in
this area was built by \V. L. El
liott of Oakland, who invited Stan
ford President David Starr Jordan
* t<) accompany him in 1899 on a
j rigorous test run in the "Llliott
automobile." The San Francisco
Examiner sponsored the run, to
be made on a narrow, winding
road to I lie summit of Mount
j Hamilton, over 4000 feet high.
Accompanying Elliott and Dr.
Jordan were professor Albert W.
Smith of the Stanford Mechanical
Engineering d ep a r t m en t and
Charles S. Aiken and Carl Hey
mann of the Examiner staff.
In Sunday Maga/ine
The Examiner recorded th e
event in its Sunday magazine see
i tion for Sept. 24, 1899.
The newspaper's introduction
to Dr. Jordan's account said, "This
is the highest point ever reached
by a motor carriage of any de
scription, and when the tortuous
chaiacter of the road is considered
the trip must rank among the
most wonderful feats of moun
tain climbing in world annals."
Dr. Jordan appraised the jour
ney in more conservative words.
He said ol the trip that "there
were no accidents and few inci
j dents."
