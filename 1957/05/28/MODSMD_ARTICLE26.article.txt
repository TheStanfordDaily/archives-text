# Medical Professor To Speak in Russia
## 
### 
Stanford Medical School's pro
fessor H. Corwin Hinshaw, noted
expert in chest diseases, will fly
to Moscow next month to speak
before the U.S.S.R.'s sixth All-
Union Congress on Tuberculosis.
His paper is entitled "Present-Day
Treatment of Tuberculosis in the
United States."
Dr. Hinshaw will be the only
American attending the Moscow
meetings, to be held June 6-15.
The Stanford physician could only
guess at the reason for his invi
tation. "I would assume," he said,
"that it is a result of my pub
lished writings. I believe the Rus
sians are well supplied with medi
cal and scientific literature pub
lished in 1 his country and abroad."
