# The 						Benchwarmer

### Dave Canfield 
In this, iho final "Benchwarmer" column of spring quarter (and
probably the final one in history if future sports staffs give in to
public opinion), the writer seizes an opportunity to deliver one last,
lingering under-the-belt punch at USC.
A newspaper's news columns are supposed to be unbiased. The
Southern California Daily Trojan is supposed to be a good news
paper. It was rated "All American" this year by the Associated Col
legiate Press, as were teh UCLA Daily Bruin and the USF Foghorn.
(The Stanford Daily was unrated.)
Yet in the illustrious DT of last Thursday there appeared an
unbyiined news story that was not, in the most far-fetched sense of
the word, objective. Here is how it read:
"Four !'('(! .Northern weak-sisters ami a halo-bound Stanford
joined forces yesterday to kill a motion to restore a half season's
eligibility to SC and IJC'I.A senior football players.
"Faculty representatives from Oregon, Oregon State, Washington
State, Idaho and Stanford combined to wreck completely any hopes
of seeing the penali'/ed seniors in action netx season.
"Nol content wiili this ruling, the faculty representatives rubbed
a strong helping of salt into the SC wound. After voting 8-1 to end
California's one-year probationary status as of July 1, an SC move
to have its-probation ended at the same time was soundly defeated
by a vote of 7-2.
". . . (live nas the reason for the Cal whitewash was that the
school's athletic program 'now is operated upon a sound basis in
strict accordance with conference rules.'
"No hint was given by the pedantic faculty men as In just what
bothered them about S< "s athletic program.
"With this action following the narrow vote that nearly kicked
UCLA's Bruins out of the conference, odds jumped lhat SC and
UCLA would take quick steps to holt the shaking PCC.
". . . The PCC passed teh hat to Idaho and SC and demanded
they pay $11)00 apiece for violations of the PCC code.
"Troy drew its fine for statements made by a 'basketball coach
of an official or officials' during and after a conference basketball
game last season, according to a subtle release from the Spokane
hide away.
"The faculty representative.* failed to name Forrest Twogood,
SC"s head basketball coach, by name, but left little doubt as to
who the fine was pointed at.
"Following the SC Oregon basketball game last season in which
Ihe Trojans ran up an easy victory, Coach Twogood declared he had
witnessed one of the 'worst jobs of officiating' he had ever seen.
"PCC referee Warren Scott, the only game official in earshot of
Twogood at the time, evidently wasted no time in referring the
matter to the PCC front office. Scott has never been known to admit
that he called a bad game or that he likes to have the next-to-the-last
word of an argument. »
"Since I he Trojans waltzed over the Oregon five with ease, Two
good's remarks could hardly be classified a case of 'sour grapes.'
"Itut just so stripe-shirted Referee Scott can have the last word,
SC has been asked to fork over $1000 to appease the («ods now
meeting in Spokane."
Maybe Southern California students have a justifiable grievance.
It seems from tho above remarks lhat they may well have. But
grievances belong in an editorial, not in an unbyiined news story
taking up a good one-fourth of page one (the top fourth).
The sacred prihciple of freedom of teh press is of little value
when college newspaper men—the editors, columnists and just-plain
reporters of the free press of tomorrow—use that freedom 1o vio
late 1 the ethics of, objective journalism.
And until students at SC and elsewhere realize that the columns
of a newspaper are for news and not for letting off steam, journal
istic ethics will be undermined and the press will continue to get
yellower.
Besides, Stanford's got to get to the Rose Bowl some way.
