Frank Herrmann, top broad .jumper in the West and the Pacific
Coast Conference champion, will be after his twelfth consecutive
win in the broad jump this weekend at Stockton when he competes
in the Pacific Association track meet. Herrmann, who was the
PCC champ in 1055 as a sophomore, has not lost a meet this year.
His lifetime best is 25 feet 3 inches, set in the West Coast Relays
at Fresno earlier this month.
