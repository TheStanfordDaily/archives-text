## Club Owners to Deride if Dodders Will Go To L.A.; Giants to S.F.; Redlegs to N.Y. 
### 
NEW YORK, May 27 (UPI—,
The most drastic franchise shift!
in the history of major league!
baseball, involving the Brooklyn i
Dodgers, New York Giants and!
Cincinnati Redlegs, will be pro-!
posed tomorrow at a special meet-j
ing of the National League in
Chicago.
Under the plan, which will be- 1
come effective for the 1958 sea-1
son if it receives Ihe necessary
unanimous consent of the Nation
al League club owners, the Dodg
ers will go to Los Angeles, the
Giants to San Francisco and the
Redlegs to New York.
The United Press learned that
all necessary documents, involv
ing television and radio commit
ments and guarantees of new
parks in Los Angeles and San
Francisco, have been drawn up
for submission to the meeting.
Although the franchise shift
was not on the agenda for the
special meeting, which was called
by president Warren Giles last
week, it was pointed out that the
matter can be brought up for <lis-

cussion with the unanimous con
sent of the club owners.
In summoning the meeting,
Giles declined to comment on
what matters would be brought
up, pointing out only that the
meeting would be held in Chicago
on Tuesday rather than the day
before the All-Star game in St.
Louis, July 9.
He said the change was made,
among other reasons, so that the
National League club owners
could attend a party being given
by owner Augustus Busch of the
St. Louis Cardinals.
A baseball official, who revealed
to the United Press that ihe pro
posed shifts "are as good as made
right now," said that if definite
action is not taken on the matter
at tomorrow's meeting, another
meeting probably will be held be
fore the All-Star game at St. Louis
for final action.
