# HEAR OWN WORKS, GET TOP TRAINING
## Music Composition Students Have Well-Balanced Program 
### Joyce Ellin 
Musical composition students
at Stanford have the major bene
fits of excellent instruction and
of hearing their works per
formed.
Studying composition at the
present time under Professor
Leonard G. Ratner are eight
graduate students. Upper divi
sion students also, however, may
enter the composition seminar if
qualified.
Ratner, who heads the semi
nar, is a composer and musicolo
gist who received his Ph.D. from
the University of California. He
has studied under Arnold Shoen
berg and Frederic Jacobi at the
Juilliard Graduate School of Mu
sic in New York, at the Univer
sity of California and at UCLA.
Neo-C lassie Style
Though Ratner composes in
the neo-classic style, the compo
sition styles of his students
range from neo-classic to highly
experimental works. Composi
tion students take a three-year
sequence of courses in harmony,
counterpoint an d orchestration
before they enter the composi
tion seminar.
Stanford's musical composition
program consists of "vigorous
and well-balanced activity," ac
cording to Professor Ratner.
Composition students have nu
merous opportunities to hear
their works performed and to
discuss musical theory and prob
lems outside the classroom. Com
posers' workshops and chamber
music* concerts at. which the stu
dents discuss their works and
hear them performed are held on
campus throughout the year.
Visiting Composers
The students hear visiting
composers speak and work with
Stanford's various dance and
"drama groups. They participate
in the San Francisco composers'
forum and in the yearly Sympo
sium of Student Composers from
Western Colleges, held this year
at Redlands University. It will
be held next year at Stanford.
Local churches and musical
groups also perform the works
of Stanford composition stu
dents.
Outstanding among present

composition students are Jon El
kus and Theodore Toews. Elkus,
a post-master's graduate student,
had some of his songs presented
at the San Francisco composers'
forum this year. "Tom Sawyer,"
an opera he composed, was pub
lished by Novello in London.
A Narration
"The Bird," a narration com
posed by Elkus for narrator,
tympani, clarinet and piano, was
performed at the Symposiurp of
Student Composers from West
ern Colleges at Redlands this
year, and will be presented again
at the composers' workshop con
cert to be held at the end of the
quarter in the new music thea
ter.
Theodore Toews' "Mass," a
choral composition, was a suc
cess at Redlands during the sym
posium, and has been performed
in Palo Alto.
Kirke Mechem, a former Stan
ford undergraduate in composi
tion now studying at the Univer
sity of Vienna, has had his choral
works published by Associated
Music Publishers in New York.
Famous Composer
Virgil Thompson, famous com
poser and critic, who visited
Stanford in June 1053, had this
to say about the Stanford music
department, which at the present
time is only 10 years old:
"During the same week in
which this reporter was a visitor
on the Stanford campus he heard
a concert of students' composi
tions executed by student musi
cians that would have made a
perfect evening for any society
of contemporary music. . . .
"Throughout the Stanford Mu
sic Department, I was impressed
by the serious and professional
quality of everybody's work,
whether in creative or interpre
tive vein. Rarely have I encoun
tered among music students so
harmonious a development."
