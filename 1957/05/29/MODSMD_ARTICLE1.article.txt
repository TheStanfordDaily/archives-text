### 
WASHINGTON, May 28 (IJP)
I he United Stales is "actively
considering" withdrawing some
Americans from Formosa because
of the recent anti-American riot
in the Chinese Nationalist strong
hold, the State Department dis
closed today.
Defense Secretary Charles Wil
son told the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee that the riot
"apparently does highlight the
need for taking another look" at
U.S. military aid to the National
ist regime.
But Wilson warned the com
mittee not to get the whole prob
lem of military aid "out of per
spective because of one unfortu
nate incident."
Court-Martial Acquittal
The riot was touched off by
the court-martial acquittal of an
American soldier accused of slay
ing a Chinese "Peeping Tom."
Chinese mobs sacked the Ameri
can embassy and other U.S. build
ings in Taipei and manhandled
American employes stationed
there.
The Nationalist regime of Cien
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek has
apologized for the incident and
has agreed to pay for the damage.
Chinese Resentment
Some officials here said they be
lieved the riot was an outgrowth
of Chinese resentment against the
high standard of living among
Americans on Formosa and also
against their large number.
State Department press officer
Lincoln White told newsmen that
some 10,000 Americans are on
Formosa now. Of this total, he
said, about 8900 have official sta
tus. He said the rest are mission
aries or businessmen.
