hood, as his assailant in the April beach party attack.
But five of six Stanford students who testified yesterday could

Asks Dismissal
Dennis Woodman, counsel for
Rutherdale, asked the court to
dismiss the allegation against his
client of felonious assault on W.
Ralph Schaefer, Stern Hall sopho
more.
Roger Lewis, representing Haw
kins, asked the court to change
the charge against his client
from felonious assault against
Keiser and Schaefer to simple as

According to witnesses, Keiser
was hit in the mouth, clobbered
with a board described as from
3 to 6 feet long and 2 to 4 inches
thick, and was kicked on the head.
He spent 17 days in Palo Alto
Hospital, with possibility of brain
concussion.
Keiser, the prosecution's star
witness, testified: "I decided they
were going to fight. So I thought
I'd better go and talk to them.
When I got to the mouth of the
cave, a large fellow came up and
hit me on the mouth."
Identifies Rutherdale
Keiser identified Rutherdale as
his attacker. He said that after
Rutherdale slugged him the gang
ringleader kneed him "between
the legs" and hit him with a board
"at least 314 feet long."
Under cross examination, Kei
ser admitted that his recollection
was "hazy." "But I have a picture
of his [Rutherdale's] smile," he
said.
Among five witnesses Wood
man said he would call today is
Louis Marks, 19, 800 Chimalmus,
Palo Alto. Marks pleaded guilty
last Friday to a charge of "as
sault with force resulting in great
physical injury."

you."

to remember seeing Hawkins hit
anyone during the skirmish—but

been identified with practically

some of our food. Hawkins said
no, that he just wanted to fight."

Hospital, with possibility of brain
concussion.
Keiser, the prosecution's star

were going to fight. So I thought
I'd better go and talk to them.
When I got to the mouth of the

hit me on the mouth."

his attacker. He said that after
