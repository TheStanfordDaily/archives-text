â€”Jordan today accused the Syr
ian army of besieging Jordanian
villages and trying to help leftists
overthrow the government or
King Hussein during the recent
Jordanian crisis.

Jordanian units.

army statement said, Syrian
forces besieged the town of Irbid,
near the Syrian frontier, on the
night of April 25. It said other
