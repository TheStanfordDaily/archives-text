Thf. $38,075 ASSU budget has been announced
for next year, and basically it is a sound one.
The allotments for the different boards and
commissions in the ASSU are sufficient without
being exorbitant. Such items as the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were lipped $1500 in
•he budget when it was discovered that last
year's $.">B7O appropriation was inadequate for
the needs of I he foreign scholar.
While we also applaud Legislature's action
in limiting the president's expense account to
$175 a year, we only hope il will be adequate
enough so that he will nol he forced lo dip
into his pocket lo meet expenses.
We hope the budget will nol be used as a
means of control of organizations, as was tried
against the Political Union last week. The
I nion found out, four hours before Legislature
meeting, that the $230 tentatively appropriated

it was going to be withdrawn until it organized
sufficiently to please Legislature.
Dun Shoup'.s luotion that $50 be given them
now and the other $180 after they organized
seems ili»' compromise answer. Hut last-minute
appropriation changes lor control should defi
nitely he avoided in the future, as the prece
dent could become quite dangerous, although
it is true that students 1 money shouldn't he
allowed to »o lo completely useless organi/.a

However, we congratulate student financial
manager Rill Mathewson on a carefully worked
out plan. Kacli student contriluites $1.25 a
quarter from his tuition to the ASSU, and he
has the right lo expect that his* money will go
lo the best of use. Alter looking al next year's
budget, which offers the right mixture of econ
omy and need,* we think the student can rest
assured that his money is nol being misused.
