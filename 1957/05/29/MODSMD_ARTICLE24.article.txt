I hmiil«;ilr<! and Embarrassed
Editor, The Daily:
We are aggrieved, humiliated and embar
rassed as a result of the recent publication of the
notice of our of fiends as being members of the
Stanford Law, Review. Wo are the Low Review.
Not only are these two organizations entirely
distinct but there has been judicial notice taken
that their principles and ideals are totally at var
iance. We do not want our names associated
with the Stanford I .aw Review, and we are quite
sure lhat they do not want theirs associated with
us. Indeed; they have seen fit to so indicate.
Furthermore, the names of these following
officers were not included in the notice: Wil
liam Abbott, Article and Particle Editor; George
Denny, Benchwarmer; John Norman, Gaoler of
Animals; Ed Mahoney, Court Jester; Hal Gross,
Public Relations and Etiquette; Bob Johnson,
Errant Clerk; Star 1 Chambermaids Zoe Ann War
berg, Kathy Slagter, Lurline Sampson, Fran Hill
and Lee Ellis. Also the following Sub-Candidates
were not mentioned: William Van Alstyne, Anne
von der Lieth, Richard Mansfield and Phil Saeta.
We would greatly appreciate your correction
of this error by publication of this letter or ap
propriate notice in order to avoid further embar
rassment.

The Low Review Bored, per the Emir
Marks of Distinction
Editor, The Daily:
Four years ago on the occasion of the first
Law School-Medical School golf match it was
announced that the purpose of the meeting was
"to improve the Law School faculty, physically,
mentally and morally." If the Law School fae
nlty now feels that its teaching will be improved
by meeting us in June rather-than the accus
tomed late May date, we are more than willing
to accommodate them.
Unfortunately teaching medicine is not a nine

month job and one day off for golf is as bad
as any other. June 13 is a particularly bad day
since it finds us in the midst of a special post
graduate course. The following week, June 20,
would be better for us.
We fully agree with Professor Ferryman's
objection to once a year faculty members play
ing for either leam. We propose even stricter
requirements, namely that only faculty mem
bers who put in at least 27 weeks teaching of the
30 for the calendar year be eligible. We reject
ihe proposition that eligibility depend on uni
versity salaries. Our faculty members carry
marks of distinction—not price tags.

Mro|> 'Holier than Thou'
Editor, The Daily:
For three quarters now I have been reading
the Daily articles of how UCLA and SC have
turned athletics into a professional business.
One of Jerry Kelly's "Looking It Over" columns
was the story of a fictitious Mr. Doolittle who
torn between a decision of football fame or a
recognized education" had to advise his son in
selecting a college. The decision: "the boy want
ed big time' football to play for a "big name"
school.
Recently in fhr> article on the Stanford crew,
you stated: "We feel the story is important for
it shows hovv an amateur group of athletes can
compete against the big time college profession
als and still be successful."
Granted that our relations with the southern
.schools are not agreeable, is it not up to us to
improve the sanation v The repeated implication
that we de-emphasize athletics is true but also
a pooi excuse. I feel that in order to bring about
any reconciliation in the PCC, Stanford must
drop the "holier than thou" attitude and take
an active interest in repairing unhealthy preju
dices. Why not start with our school paper?
