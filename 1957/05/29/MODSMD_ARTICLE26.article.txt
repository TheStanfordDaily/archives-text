# Woodpecker Lodge Will Soon End varied Career
## Art, Music, Drama Departments Among Many Occupants Using Building for 65-Year History 
### Camille Peterson 
Dozens of woodpeckers, other birds and squirrels must find a new
place on which to sharpen their bills and search for food and shelter,
for Woodpecker Lodge, temporary for nearly 65 years, will soon be
no more.
Woodpecker-, so renamed about 1929 when Ihe birds had invaded

lhe premises in earnest, began its
service behind Sequoia Hall in
1892 and was moved to its pres
ent location in 1918 upon the
building o! Roble Hall, Ihe new
women's dormitory.
For many years the frame
building was called the Roble
Gymnasium, and the first wom
en's basketball team to play
against the University of Califor
nia team on April 4, 1864, trained
there. The women athletes were
only the first of many groups to
use the facilities of the "tempo
rary frame building."
Physical Education
The building continued to be
used by the women's physical ed
ucation department until 1930
when they moved into their new
$250,000 structure which is now
in use. Many articles were writ
ten by former women students ;il
the University prior to the con
struction of the new building.
One, Barbara. Dewlaney, class of
1927, in an article complaining
about the lack of windows in the
old building, write, "H the wood
peckers stick to their job, how
ever, there will be plenty ol
light."
The women moved out, but the
building did not stand idle. Dur
ing the next years its upper floor
housed the art department. At
other times during the following
years the Alpine Club, the Spe
lunker people and the Mothers'
Club occupied various rooms.
The addressograph office has re
mained there to this day.
Music, Drama
The music and drama depart
ments moved into Woodpecker in
1946 with their opera workshop.
The stage was on the floor and
the dressing rooms in the back.
Talented artists from San Fran
cisco and throughout the Buy
Area worked here ,on scenes
from stock operas, and all of the
school operas were put together
here before being taken to Me
morial Auditorium for presenta
tion.
In the spring of 1948 the cho
rus and orchestra moved to
Woodpecker, and in this same
year the opera "Peter Grimes"
by Benjamin Britten was pre
sented. Stanley Noonan, male
lead in this year's opera, "The
Ballad of Baby Doe," sang ihe
role of Captain Bal s t r ode.
"Shvanda" by Jaromir Weinber
ger was put together there in '49.
Main Occupants
The music and art departments
continued to be the main occu
pants of Woodpecker Lodge until
this spring when the former's
new Dinkelspiel Memorial Music
Center was completed. By the
time of their departure, parts of
the old building were already be
ing removed to make room for
the new $100,000 petroleum wing
addition to the Geophysics Build-'
ing.
Woodpecker Hall, one of the
oldest buildings on the campus,
where the tapping of the birds
has furnished the rhythm for
generations of dancing classes,
artists and musicians, will soon
he gone.

rus and orchestra moved to
Woodpecker, and in this same
year the opera "Peter Grimes"

Ballad of Baby Doe," sang ihe
role of Captain Bal s t r ode.

Main Occupants
The music and art departments
continued to be the main occu
pants of Woodpecker Lodge until
this spring when the former's
new Dinkelspiel Memorial Music
Center was completed. By the
time of their departure, parts of
the old building were already be
ing removed to make room for
the new $100,000 petroleum wing
addition to the Geophysics Build-'
ing.
Woodpecker Hall, one of the
oldest buildings on the campus,
where the tapping of the birds
has furnished the rhythm for
generations of dancing classes,
artists and musicians, will soon
he gone.
Dozens of woodpeckers, other birds and squirrels must find a new
place on which to sharpen their bills and search for food and shelter,
for Woodpecker Lodge, temporary for nearly 65 years, will soon be
no more.
Woodpecker-, so renamed about 1929 when Ihe birds had invaded

lhe premises in earnest, began its
service behind Sequoia Hall in
1892 and was moved to its pres
ent location in 1918 upon the
building o! Roble Hall, Ihe new
women's dormitory.
For many years the frame
building was called the Roble
Gymnasium, and the first wom
en's basketball team to play
against the University of Califor
nia team on April 4, 1864, trained
there. The women athletes were
only the first of many groups to
use the facilities of the "tempo
rary frame building."
Physical Education
The building continued to be
used by the women's physical ed
ucation department until 1930
when they moved into their new
$250,000 structure which is now
in use. Many articles were writ
ten by former women students ;il
the University prior to the con
struction of the new building.
One, Barbara. Dewlaney, class of
1927, in an article complaining
about the lack of windows in the
old building, write, "H the wood
peckers stick to their job, how
ever, there will be plenty ol
light."
The women moved out, but the
building did not stand idle. Dur
ing the next years its upper floor
housed the art department. At
other times during the following
years the Alpine Club, the Spe
lunker people and the Mothers'
Club occupied various rooms.
The addressograph office has re
mained there to this day.
Music, Drama
The music and drama depart
ments moved into Woodpecker in
1946 with their opera workshop.
The stage was on the floor and
the dressing rooms in the back.
Talented artists from San Fran
cisco and throughout the Buy
Area worked here ,on scenes
from stock operas, and all of the
school operas were put together
here before being taken to Me
morial Auditorium for presenta
tion.
