## 
### 
Mark Schorer, professor of
English at the University of Cali
fornia, has written an interesting
I answer to the question, "Why
' study literature?" in the spring
i issue of Sequoia.
One of Schorer's observations
lin his short article "Why We
Really Read" is that the "popu
iaj- arts" today (i.e., movies, ra
dio, TV, illustrated periodicals)
"are remarkable in their inability
! or unwillingness to function as
culturally valuable." He cites the
"passive enjoyment" which the
| "popular arts" provide and there
fore there is "little or no collabo
ration" required from the audi
ence which absorbs these arts.
"Sex and Religion"
In "Sex, Religion and Stan
ford" David Sears and Martin
Horwitz make some observations
| of the college student's attempt
to reconcile religion and sex.
Canon Bryan Green's recent visit
to Stanford is discussed in detail
from this viewpoint. The article
is a strong, well-written study of
a vital and controversial subject.
The third article is "New Men,
New Freedoms" by Les Mazor.
Individual freedom is the topic
explored, from the standpoint of
a present-day tyranny of the ma
jority and the majority's opin
i ions. The guarantees of the Con
j stitution to each individual are
Ihe basis used by the author to
j point out Ihe inconsistencies ex
' isting at present.
Stories' Are Featured
Two short stories are featured
in this issue. Jim Bowditch's
"Sato sun" provides a shocking
| view of how the concept of
American democracy can become
hated abroad because of the ac
tions of United States citizens.
The story is excellent, perhaps
the best story that Sequoia has
run to date.
"Isaac and Sonia" by Richard
Elman was written as "part of a
projected novel," according to
! the short bibliographical note on
j the story's author, and perhaps
I this is why the story is not too
j satisfactory. The reader is drop
1 ped into the plot with a thud and
, I hen becomes lost when ihe story
slowly trails off to a conclusion.
The characterization is vivid, but
J one never- gets the proper in
| sight into the characters' motiva
! lions.
Poems by A 1 Reid, Tom Fer
rell, Vicki Bever and Dwain Ful
l lerton are also included.

ration" required from the audi
ence which absorbs these arts.
"Sex and Religion"
In "Sex, Religion and Stan
ford" David Sears and Martin
Horwitz make some observations
| of the college student's attempt
to reconcile religion and sex.
Canon Bryan Green's recent visit
to Stanford is discussed in detail
from this viewpoint. The article
is a strong, well-written study of
a vital and controversial subject.
The third article is "New Men,
New Freedoms" by Les Mazor.
Individual freedom is the topic
explored, from the standpoint of
a present-day tyranny of the ma
jority and the majority's opin
i ions. The guarantees of the Con
j stitution to each individual are
Ihe basis used by the author to
j point out Ihe inconsistencies ex
' isting at present.
Stories' Are Featured
Two short stories are featured
in this issue. Jim Bowditch's
"Sato sun" provides a shocking
| view of how the concept of
American democracy can become
hated abroad because of the ac
tions of United States citizens.
The story is excellent, perhaps
the best story that Sequoia has
run to date.
"Isaac and Sonia" by Richard
Elman was written as "part of a
projected novel," according to
! the short bibliographical note on
j the story's author, and perhaps
I this is why the story is not too
j satisfactory. The reader is drop
1 ped into the plot with a thud and
, I hen becomes lost when ihe story
slowly trails off to a conclusion.
The characterization is vivid, but
J one never- gets the proper in
| sight into the characters' motiva
! lions.
Poems by A 1 Reid, Tom Fer
rell, Vicki Bever and Dwain Ful
l lerton are also included.
Mark Schorer, professor of
English at the University of Cali
fornia, has written an interesting
I answer to the question, "Why
' study literature?" in the spring
i issue of Sequoia.
One of Schorer's observations
lin his short article "Why We
Really Read" is that the "popu
iaj- arts" today (i.e., movies, ra
dio, TV, illustrated periodicals)
"are remarkable in their inability
! or unwillingness to function as
culturally valuable." He cites the
"passive enjoyment" which the
| "popular arts" provide and there
fore there is "little or no collabo
ration" required from the audi
ence which absorbs these arts.
