# Oarsmen Definitely Decide To Row in IRA Regatta
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity crew defi
nitely will row in the IRA. the
intercollegiate rowing classic to
he held in Syracuse, N.Y., June 22.
This emphatic statement was
issued by Roald Engebreth, pub
licity director for the Indian crew
and No. 4 oarsman in the Cards'
varsity shell, to quell rumors that
the oarsmen were considering giv
ing up the trip because of their
loss lo Washington by s'/4 lengths
last Saturday.
''I don't think there was ever
any doubt we would go," said

I Engebreth. "The first I heard
about it was when I read the Sun
day papers saying we might give
. up the trip because we were so
upset about losing.
"All the oarsmen started call
ing me Sunday asking what it
was all about, but 1 was as much
in the dark about it as they were.
"We held a meeting Monday
night just to get it clear how we
felt, and I don't think any one of
j us really seriously considered giv
ing up the trip.
"It was generally agreed that
we have rowed much better and
that one bad race is no reason to
I give up without trying.
"Lack of power in the varsity
shell isn't why we lost; we have
plenty of power. We just weren't
yetting a good run-out â€”that's the
distance the shell travels between
strokes.
"We've gone back to practicing
i our preliminary exercises in an
effort to get back our- timing and
smooth out our stroke."
In addition to making it clear
that they would go east, the crew
drew up a letter which they sent
to the NCAA urging that Wash
ington be allowed to row in the
IRA. The Indians stressed the
fact that the Husky oarsmen had
not broken any rules and that it
was unfair to penalize them for
the sins of another sport.
On their way east the crew will
stop off at Madison, Wis., and en
gage I lie Badgers in a three-mile
warm-up contest before the Syra
cuse classic. Wisconsin lost to
California earlier this year.
An interclass race has been
.scheduled for Saturday morning.
That afternoon the Crew Auxil
iary, ;i group of co-ed crew boost
ers, will get in the act in a mixed
! boat regatta.
The regatta scheduled Saturday
morning between the Stanford
frosh and Orange Coast ,TC has
I been cancelled.
