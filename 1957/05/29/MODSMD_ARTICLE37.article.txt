## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 28 (UP) The
Brooklyn Dodgers and New York
Giants today were authorized to
relocate their franchises upon
request to the National League.
President Warren Giles said
that neither club picked a spe
cific site for a new location.
Giles said the vote, which had
to he unanimous, meant that it
was agreeable to the League for
both clubs to move.
Proposal Defeated
Before the action on the move
ment of Ihe two franchises, the
League defeated a proposal by
Milwaukee which would have re
quired only six of Ihe eight clubs
to vote for a franchise transfer
in order to grant such permis
sion.
"Then we discussed for a long
time Ihe proposed franchise
shift," Giles said.
"If the New York and Brook
lyn clubs request consent before
Oct. 1 to relocate their franchises
in San Francisco and Los Ange
les, respectively, the League
president is authorized to grant
in behalf of the League such con
sent."
There was no League action
announced about the movement
of the Cincinnati franchise and
Gabe Paul, general manager of
ihe Redlegs, said, "We're not ask
ing consent for anything."
Redlegs Quiet
Giles said that while there
were no indications that any club
would ask permission to move
into New York or Brooklyn in
case those two teams decide to
shift to the West Coast, any of
the other six clubs in Ihe League
could apply for such permission.
"But as of this time there is no
indication that any club would
ask for such permission," he said.
Asked if the possibility of Ihe
Redlegs transferring to New
York was brought up, Giles said
it was. He said he brought it up
and the reply he received from
Paul was:
"We are not asking consent for
anything."
