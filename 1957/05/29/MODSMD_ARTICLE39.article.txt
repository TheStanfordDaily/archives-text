Spring praclice came to a close wilh Saturday's all-out scrim
mage, and Willi it ended the Stanford coaching career of Allen Henry
El ward.
."Mai," as ho is known to colleagues and players, has hern wilh
the Stanford athletic department since 194(5, acting in the dual ca
pacity of end coach and coach of the Braves.
Next fall Mai will occupy himself as Ihe West Coast scout for
the Vancouver Lions of the Canadian Football League.
We remember Mai when he ;uhl Man-hie Schwartz were heat
ing the Northern California buvhes for the Indian cause. His list,
of anecdotes for the banquet, circuit extends hack beyond the days
when he played end for Notre Dame behind the great Knnte
ltocknc and, though often heard, they never cease to entertain.
The amazing thing about Mai is lhat he has gained his wealth
of experience in football despite his slight, 5-9, 145-11). frame. To
offset his disadvantage he learned to turn every circumstance to his
advantage hack in the days "when men were men."
This knowledge gave him insight into the problems of his Braves,
the boys a step too slow for, or a year away from, the varsity, lie
taught them to stand in there and take it and give more hack
whether scrimmaging the varsity or boxing ihe ears of the Cal
Ramblers on Saturday.
Certainly, the Braves under EI ward never became drudgery;
The atmosphere on the field seemed always charged with an "en
.joy-it-while-you play-it" feeling which was heightened by the per
sonal triumph gained in each victory.
A chilly Friday afternoon prior to Ihe 1953 P>ig Came comes to
mind. Mai called practice early (the varsity had already gone in
after a light work-out, but "Mai's boys" stayed out as it was their
first opportunity to run their own plays that week) and, while a
blue and gold garbed tackling dummy went up in flames, he led the
Braves in an original victory song.
The next day Hie Braves beat the Ramblers, 20-12, while Ihe var
sity suffered the 21-21 tie which kept them out of the Rose Bowl.
Last season, when the Braves' ranks were thinned by heavy
drafts by the injury-riddled varsity, Mai went along with Ihe team's
suggestion that he use one of Connie Jarvis' assistant trainers in
Ihe backfield.
The back, a spear thrower named Hank Roldan, went on to become
one of the Braves' leading scorers.
Many Stanford ballplayers have been influenced by Mai's conta
gious "will-to-win" through the years. Jerry Gustafson and Tony
Mosich and 195G East-Wester Carl Isaacs all spent their sophomore
years "learning the game" under Mai.
For these, and for the many others who have never reached
such heights, this column is one way of saying, "So long, Mai, it's"
been great to know you."

Unfortunately, the retirement of Elward also signals the passing
of the Braves.
Chuck Taylor announced in the April edition of "The Stanford
Buck Club" that Ihe junior varsity would be replaced next season
by a second varsity—which would play, at most, two games with
California.
Theory behind the move was that local service competition was
not of sufficient caliber (with the exception of Fort Ord and Hamil
ton Field) to give the Braves any amount of experience and that it
would remove difficulties inherent in running two teams and keep
ing them both at game strength.
These arguments seem to have a good amount of merit. How
ever. there are other aspects which must be called, at best, undesir
able.
In the first place, one primary purpose of the intercollegiate
program—participation —has virtually been sacrificed by the elim
ination of games.
Not unrelated is the fact that, although most of those who have
performed with the Braves have had the varsity as their goal, some
of them never make it. •
For all. the games were a "safety valve" which made the sacrifice
of ihree hours each afternoon worth while and which made it pos
sible to maintain one's self-esteem.
It's no fun playing blocking dummy for anyone all afternoon,
and less fun when you know that that's all you're doing.
Ronnie Knox, in an article for Collier's last fall, declared his dis
illusionment with UCLA's "goof squad," a team which has no
schedule. Though he had heard that these were the boys who "of
fered themselves as sacrificial lambs purely for love of the game,"
he found that 90 per cent admitted truthfully that they look 1 hat
terrible beating from the varsity for the material rewards.
This has not been the situation at Stanford—to date.

."Mai," as ho is known to colleagues and players, has hern wilh
the Stanford athletic department since 194(5, acting in the dual ca
pacity of end coach and coach of the Braves.
Next fall Mai will occupy himself as Ihe West Coast scout for
the Vancouver Lions of the Canadian Football League.
We remember Mai when he ;uhl Man-hie Schwartz were heat
ing the Northern California buvhes for the Indian cause. His list,
of anecdotes for the banquet, circuit extends hack beyond the days
when he played end for Notre Dame behind the great Knnte
ltocknc and, though often heard, they never cease to entertain.
The amazing thing about Mai is lhat he has gained his wealth
of experience in football despite his slight, 5-9, 145-11). frame. To
offset his disadvantage he learned to turn every circumstance to his
advantage hack in the days "when men were men."
This knowledge gave him insight into the problems of his Braves,
the boys a step too slow for, or a year away from, the varsity, lie
taught them to stand in there and take it and give more hack
whether scrimmaging the varsity or boxing ihe ears of the Cal
Ramblers on Saturday.
Certainly, the Braves under EI ward never became drudgery;
The atmosphere on the field seemed always charged with an "en
.joy-it-while-you play-it" feeling which was heightened by the per
sonal triumph gained in each victory.
A chilly Friday afternoon prior to Ihe 1953 P>ig Came comes to
mind. Mai called practice early (the varsity had already gone in
after a light work-out, but "Mai's boys" stayed out as it was their
first opportunity to run their own plays that week) and, while a
blue and gold garbed tackling dummy went up in flames, he led the
Braves in an original victory song.
The next day Hie Braves beat the Ramblers, 20-12, while Ihe var
sity suffered the 21-21 tie which kept them out of the Rose Bowl.
Last season, when the Braves' ranks were thinned by heavy
drafts by the injury-riddled varsity, Mai went along with Ihe team's
suggestion that he use one of Connie Jarvis' assistant trainers in
Ihe backfield.
The back, a spear thrower named Hank Roldan, went on to become
one of the Braves' leading scorers.
Many Stanford ballplayers have been influenced by Mai's conta
gious "will-to-win" through the years. Jerry Gustafson and Tony
Mosich and 195G East-Wester Carl Isaacs all spent their sophomore
years "learning the game" under Mai.
For these, and for the many others who have never reached
such heights, this column is one way of saying, "So long, Mai, it's"
been great to know you."

Unfortunately, the retirement of Elward also signals the passing
of the Braves.
Chuck Taylor announced in the April edition of "The Stanford
Buck Club" that Ihe junior varsity would be replaced next season
by a second varsity—which would play, at most, two games with
California.
Theory behind the move was that local service competition was
not of sufficient caliber (with the exception of Fort Ord and Hamil
ton Field) to give the Braves any amount of experience and that it
would remove difficulties inherent in running two teams and keep
ing them both at game strength.
These arguments seem to have a good amount of merit. How
ever. there are other aspects which must be called, at best, undesir
able.
In the first place, one primary purpose of the intercollegiate
program—participation —has virtually been sacrificed by the elim
ination of games.
Not unrelated is the fact that, although most of those who have
performed with the Braves have had the varsity as their goal, some
of them never make it. •
For all. the games were a "safety valve" which made the sacrifice
of ihree hours each afternoon worth while and which made it pos
sible to maintain one's self-esteem.
It's no fun playing blocking dummy for anyone all afternoon,
and less fun when you know that that's all you're doing.
Ronnie Knox, in an article for Collier's last fall, declared his dis
illusionment with UCLA's "goof squad," a team which has no
schedule. Though he had heard that these were the boys who "of
fered themselves as sacrificial lambs purely for love of the game,"
he found that 90 per cent admitted truthfully that they look 1 hat
terrible beating from the varsity for the material rewards.

pacity of end coach and coach of the Braves.
Next fall Mai will occupy himself as Ihe West Coast scout for
the Vancouver Lions of the Canadian Football League.
We remember Mai when he ;uhl Man-hie Schwartz were heat
ing the Northern California buvhes for the Indian cause. His list,
of anecdotes for the banquet, circuit extends hack beyond the days
when he played end for Notre Dame behind the great Knnte
ltocknc and, though often heard, they never cease to entertain.
The amazing thing about Mai is lhat he has gained his wealth
of experience in football despite his slight, 5-9, 145-11). frame. To
offset his disadvantage he learned to turn every circumstance to his
advantage hack in the days "when men were men."
This knowledge gave him insight into the problems of his Braves,
the boys a step too slow for, or a year away from, the varsity, lie
taught them to stand in there and take it and give more hack
whether scrimmaging the varsity or boxing ihe ears of the Cal
Ramblers on Saturday.
Certainly, the Braves under EI ward never became drudgery;
The atmosphere on the field seemed always charged with an "en
.joy-it-while-you play-it" feeling which was heightened by the per
sonal triumph gained in each victory.
A chilly Friday afternoon prior to Ihe 1953 P>ig Came comes to
mind. Mai called practice early (the varsity had already gone in
after a light work-out, but "Mai's boys" stayed out as it was their
first opportunity to run their own plays that week) and, while a
blue and gold garbed tackling dummy went up in flames, he led the
Braves in an original victory song.
The next day Hie Braves beat the Ramblers, 20-12, while Ihe var
sity suffered the 21-21 tie which kept them out of the Rose Bowl.
Last season, when the Braves' ranks were thinned by heavy
drafts by the injury-riddled varsity, Mai went along with Ihe team's
suggestion that he use one of Connie Jarvis' assistant trainers in
Ihe backfield.
The back, a spear thrower named Hank Roldan, went on to become
one of the Braves' leading scorers.
Many Stanford ballplayers have been influenced by Mai's conta
gious "will-to-win" through the years. Jerry Gustafson and Tony
Mosich and 195G East-Wester Carl Isaacs all spent their sophomore
years "learning the game" under Mai.
For these, and for the many others who have never reached
such heights, this column is one way of saying, "So long, Mai, it's"
been great to know you."

Unfortunately, the retirement of Elward also signals the passing
of the Braves.
Chuck Taylor announced in the April edition of "The Stanford
Buck Club" that Ihe junior varsity would be replaced next season
by a second varsity—which would play, at most, two games with
California.
Theory behind the move was that local service competition was
not of sufficient caliber (with the exception of Fort Ord and Hamil
ton Field) to give the Braves any amount of experience and that it
would remove difficulties inherent in running two teams and keep
ing them both at game strength.
These arguments seem to have a good amount of merit. How
ever. there are other aspects which must be called, at best, undesir
able.
In the first place, one primary purpose of the intercollegiate
program—participation —has virtually been sacrificed by the elim
ination of games.
Not unrelated is the fact that, although most of those who have
performed with the Braves have had the varsity as their goal, some
of them never make it. •
For all. the games were a "safety valve" which made the sacrifice
of ihree hours each afternoon worth while and which made it pos
sible to maintain one's self-esteem.
It's no fun playing blocking dummy for anyone all afternoon,
and less fun when you know that that's all you're doing.
Ronnie Knox, in an article for Collier's last fall, declared his dis
illusionment with UCLA's "goof squad," a team which has no
schedule. Though he had heard that these were the boys who "of
fered themselves as sacrificial lambs purely for love of the game,"
he found that 90 per cent admitted truthfully that they look 1 hat
terrible beating from the varsity for the material rewards.
This has not been the situation at Stanford—to date.
