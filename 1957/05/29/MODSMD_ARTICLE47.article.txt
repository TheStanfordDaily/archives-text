# MEMBERS PROVIDE INCOME
## Next Year's ASSU Budget Expected to Total $38,075 
### 
If the Associated Students of
Stanford University were one per
son the federal government would
be most happy, for it could take
a big tax chunk of his income—
$38,075 for next year.
However, since ASSU is not one
person but some 8000, an amount
will not be taken out by Uncle
Sam.
Actually, the members of ASSU
will really provide most of their
own income. With $1.25 from each
student's tuition going into the
regular ASSU budget, more than
$32,000 is expected to be collected
in 1957-58.
rainless Extraction
"Painless extraction" methods
will provide near ly $6000 to bring
the ASSU income up to its $38,000.
These funds come from such
items as Flicks receipts, movie
discount cards and rooter cap
sales.
What will become of the dough,
once it goes into the ASSU cof
fers?
About $34,000 has already been
allotted by Legislature for vari
ous functions, and some $4000
remains in a contingency fund to
be dished out as unforeseen events
come along.

divided approximately as follows:
