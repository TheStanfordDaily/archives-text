# 'Y' Group Holds Education Forum
## 
### 
A lively discussion of progres
sive education marked the last
"Y" Public Affairs Group talk of
the year yesterday in the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
The members discussed the
teaching of foreign languages in
high school, some advocating the
introduction of the Berlitz meth
of of speaking no English at all
in the classroom, and others sup
porting the classical method.
One questioned the requiring
of psychology courses for teach
ing in California high schools. He
pointed out that some of our top
physics professors would not be
allowed to tearh high school
physics for lack of psychology
courses.
The group decided that educa
tors are turning away from the
much â€¢ discussed radical kind of
progressive education. There is
a movement to use a little old
fashioned discipline in education.
