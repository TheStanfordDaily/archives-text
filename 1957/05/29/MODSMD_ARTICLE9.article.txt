# South Pacific Life Is Topic Of Series Talk
## Scientist Describes Customs of Natives In Kapingamarangi 
### 
The almost-primitive civilization
of one of the most isolated atolls
of the South Pacific was the topic
of the final Tuesday Livening Se
ries lecture last night in Memo
rial Auditorium.
Robert Rees Harry, scientist
with the Vanderbilt Foundation
here, described life of the Poly
nesian people of Kapingamarangi,
an atoll north of Australia, in an
illustrated lecture.
"1 would not call Kapingama
rangi a primitive society," Harry
said. "They are civilized, even if
they don't have matches."
The variety of products obtain
ed from the few fruits and vege
tables grown on the island is
amazing, according to Harry. The
people utilize the breadfruits, co
coanuts and other plants for food,
shelter and material.
Handmade
Houses and canoes are hand
made, with no nails. The natives
also have no matches, making fire
the primitive way by rubbing two
sticks together.
House-building and canoe-mak
ing are community projects, as is
cooking, Harry said. However, he
noted, eating is usually a solitary
thing.
Women almost entirely prepare
the food; the only thing the men
do in this line is singe the pigs
before roasting. Men do all the
weaving.
The primary art of the people,
other than the arts they have used
to fulfill their needs, is the weav
ing of leis. There are no native
dances—only those brought in by
sailors, the speaker observed.
1954 Expedition
Harry was a member of a Foun
dation expedition to the island in
1954. He said the study was begun
after George Vanderbilt became
interested in the area during the
war and established the non-profit
trust to study the people and fish
in the South Pacific.
The film which accompanied
the lecture was made by the
Bishop Museum in Hawaii.
The primary interest of the
Foundation is to study results of
nuclear fission on fish in the
South Atlantic. Harry explained
that the Foundation has the pri
mary contract for the study.
Preliminary slides included
scenes of undersea life in the coral
reefs which abound in the area.
As he, showed the slides, the lec
turer noted the opportunities for
work in the area of undersea pho
tography and classification of the
fish.

turer noted the opportunities for
work in the area of undersea pho
tography and classification of the
fish.
The almost-primitive civilization
of one of the most isolated atolls
of the South Pacific was the topic
of the final Tuesday Livening Se
ries lecture last night in Memo
rial Auditorium.
Robert Rees Harry, scientist
with the Vanderbilt Foundation
here, described life of the Poly
nesian people of Kapingamarangi,
an atoll north of Australia, in an
illustrated lecture.
"1 would not call Kapingama
rangi a primitive society," Harry
said. "They are civilized, even if
they don't have matches."
The variety of products obtain
ed from the few fruits and vege
tables grown on the island is
amazing, according to Harry. The
people utilize the breadfruits, co
coanuts and other plants for food,
shelter and material.
Handmade
Houses and canoes are hand
made, with no nails. The natives
also have no matches, making fire
the primitive way by rubbing two
sticks together.
House-building and canoe-mak
ing are community projects, as is
cooking, Harry said. However, he
noted, eating is usually a solitary
thing.
Women almost entirely prepare
the food; the only thing the men
do in this line is singe the pigs
before roasting. Men do all the
weaving.
The primary art of the people,
other than the arts they have used
to fulfill their needs, is the weav
ing of leis. There are no native
dances—only those brought in by
sailors, the speaker observed.
1954 Expedition
Harry was a member of a Foun
dation expedition to the island in
1954. He said the study was begun
after George Vanderbilt became
interested in the area during the
war and established the non-profit
trust to study the people and fish
in the South Pacific.
The film which accompanied
the lecture was made by the
Bishop Museum in Hawaii.
The primary interest of the
Foundation is to study results of
nuclear fission on fish in the
South Atlantic. Harry explained
that the Foundation has the pri
mary contract for the study.
Preliminary slides included
scenes of undersea life in the coral
reefs which abound in the area.
