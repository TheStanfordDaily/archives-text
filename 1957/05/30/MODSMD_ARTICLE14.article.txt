# Synchronized Star Sells Sea Shells in Show
## 
### Anne Johnson 
Women's Swim Club put on a
pleasant hour of entertainment
last night in its annual show, this
year titled "by the Sea." The per
formance will be repeated to
night at 8:30 at the women's pool.
Star of the show and rightly so
was a former Swim Club mem
ber and a nationally famous syn
chronized swimmer, Sally Phil
lips Angove. Mrs. Angove ably
demonstrated her skill during
her number "She Sells Sea
Shells."
Best Precision
Best precision number was
"The Sea I3oils Over" directed by
Susan Brady. Showing their
s'w i m m in g ability were Miss
Brady, Diane Custer, Pat Crock
ett, Sybil Hoffman, Penny Hult,
| Julie Moffatt and Sara Treer.
Karen Chaffee and Penny Hult
almost stole the show with their
"Two Froggies" number. Their
water play brought chuckles
from both children and adults in
; the audience.
An impressive performance
was put on by the women's div
! inq; class instructed by Ursula
Allison. In another twosome
1 number, Moonglow. Diane Custer
I and Sibyl Hoffman exhibited
smooth and graceful movements.
Group Numbers
The Gay Ninety Belles, Cheers
.for the Navy, Misty Sea, Moon of
Manakoora and Seascape were
all group numbers and resem
bled each other just a little too
closely. Mrs. Angove also ap
peared with Paul Wiggin and
Gary Van Galder in a short hu
morous presentation, "The Fish
erman and the Mermaid."
Costumes were attractive but ;
had a tendency to become be- I
draggled once in the water. The |
hair that seemed to get in the
eyes of most of the swimmers I
also detracted.
