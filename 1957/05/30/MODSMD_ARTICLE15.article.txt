# Humphrey Resigns Post As Treasury Secretary
## Anderson Named To Post; Budget Chief Shift Seen 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 29 (UP)
—Treasury Secretary George M.
Humphrey, chief architect of
President Eisenhower's "moder
ate" fiscal policies, resigned today
from the Cabinet post he has held
since the start of the Administra
tion in 1953.
The President promptly nomi
nated former Navy Secretary Rob
ert B. Anderson, an original "Tex
as Democrat for Eisenhower" in
1952, to be Humphrey's successor.
Anderson accepted the post "with
humility" and promised to carry
on Humphrey's "wise fiscal poli
cies."
In accordance with a suggestion
from Humphrey, Eisenhower
made the resignation effective no
later than the close of the present
session of Congress.
"Absolute Necessity"
The White House made public
Humphrey's letter of resignation
and the President's reply. In his
letter Humphrey said the recent
retirement of one of his former
business partners made it an "ab
solute necessity" that he return
to private life.
It was expected that he would
become board chairman of Na
tional Steel Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.,
a company he helped organize in
1929.
The exchange of letters also re
vealed that Humphrey's top as
sistant, Treasury Undersecretary
W. Randolph Burgess, has agreed
to take another government post.
Speculation
There was immediate specula
tion that Burgess, a former New
York banker, might succeed Per
cival F. Brundage as budget direc
tor. Brundage has been under fire
in Congress for his part in the
formulation of Eisenhower's $71.8
billion budget for the 1958 fiscal
year.
Humphrey is the fourth mem
ber of Eisenhower's original Cabi
net to leave the government.
