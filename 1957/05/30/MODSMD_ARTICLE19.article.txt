# 2.5 Billion Tons of TNT
## 
### 
A REPORT was delivered lo Congress recently
I hat by 1960 Russia would he capable of drop
ping H-homhs 011 America capable of killing
82 million.
In addition lo this, almost all the remaining
Americans would suffer some effects of radia
tion burns. And fallouts from the initial blasts
would drift down for years. Scientists now are
debating I lie aftereffects that just practice tests
are having now.
On the same day it was announced from the
deserts of Nevada that, the United States had
exploded an atomic warhead. The blast, which
was seen for 700 miles and shook a town 150
miles away, was classified as a small one.
\\ ith Russia's progress in atomic warfare, it
of course is necessary that we keep pace with
Russia's scientific development. At present
Russia's schools are turning out twice as many
engineers and scientists as we. Unless some
thing is done, and it may have to be by the
federal government, we will fall hopelessly
behind the Soviet Union in scientific develop
ment.
Congress' reaction to the whole problem
seems to be mere economy. Defense cuts seem
to be the mode nowadays. And as for any type

of aid to educalion, (iongress probably won't
even touch Iho subject I his term.
Hut a more important point comes up; in the
case of an atomic war, which nation has better
atomic development will make little difference.
Both sides will lose.
Apparently I lie leaders of the world are
finally coming lo llieir senses about these pos
sibilities. Disarmament talks arc now going 011
in London. Both Kisenhower and Khrushchev
have proposed open skies inspection plans.
Although it would be folly lo expect the
Soviet Union—or the United States, for that
matter—to follow honestly any drastic arms
reduction plan, llie ineffectiveness of post-
World War I plans proves this: any effort
toward easing of military tensions would great
ly help the situation.
Even a token open sky agreement would
show that both nations are^ making an effort
toward world peace, and it might lead to
greater understanding and perhaps later a plan
with more teeth in ii.
Ami a liltle trust might go a long way if the
United Slates and tlie* Soviet Union see 2.5
billion tons of TNT set loose in each of their
countries as the equivalent.

Ami a liltle trust might go a long way if the
United Slates and tlie* Soviet Union see 2.5
billion tons of TNT set loose in each of their
countries as the equivalent.
A REPORT was delivered lo Congress recently
I hat by 1960 Russia would he capable of drop
ping H-homhs 011 America capable of killing
82 million.
In addition lo this, almost all the remaining
Americans would suffer some effects of radia
tion burns. And fallouts from the initial blasts
would drift down for years. Scientists now are
debating I lie aftereffects that just practice tests
are having now.
On the same day it was announced from the
deserts of Nevada that, the United States had
exploded an atomic warhead. The blast, which
was seen for 700 miles and shook a town 150
miles away, was classified as a small one.
\\ ith Russia's progress in atomic warfare, it
of course is necessary that we keep pace with
Russia's scientific development. At present
Russia's schools are turning out twice as many
engineers and scientists as we. Unless some
thing is done, and it may have to be by the
federal government, we will fall hopelessly
behind the Soviet Union in scientific develop
ment.
Congress' reaction to the whole problem
seems to be mere economy. Defense cuts seem
to be the mode nowadays. And as for any type

of aid to educalion, (iongress probably won't
even touch Iho subject I his term.
Hut a more important point comes up; in the
case of an atomic war, which nation has better
atomic development will make little difference.
Both sides will lose.
Apparently I lie leaders of the world are
finally coming lo llieir senses about these pos
sibilities. Disarmament talks arc now going 011
in London. Both Kisenhower and Khrushchev
have proposed open skies inspection plans.
Although it would be folly lo expect the
Soviet Union—or the United States, for that
matter—to follow honestly any drastic arms
reduction plan, llie ineffectiveness of post-
World War I plans proves this: any effort
toward easing of military tensions would great
ly help the situation.
Even a token open sky agreement would
show that both nations are^ making an effort
toward world peace, and it might lead to
greater understanding and perhaps later a plan
with more teeth in ii.
