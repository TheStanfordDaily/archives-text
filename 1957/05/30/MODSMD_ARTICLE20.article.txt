# Big League Ball

I HE allegiance of Stanford students may soon
be split. Never has the school been faced with
such a situation; never have so many factions
been poised to spring into action.
True open warfare has not yet been decl'ared,
but it's strongly in the air. And come next
spring it may well be here.
For San Francisco seems to be going big
lime, baseball-wise. The New York Giants seem
to be well on their way to Seals Stadium, Stan
ford's neighbor to the northwest. National
League president Warren Giles has announced
that the move is fine with the league if the
Brooklyn Dodgers move to Los Angeles at the
same time.
This means that students from New York
can give up their half-hearted rooting for the
Seals ami come out with loud cheers for their
own Giants or Hums. Likewise, Phillies, Braves,
Kedlegs ami all oilier National League tvpe
rooters can come, out of retirement.

Somehow, there is never the same type of
enthusiasm to root for a minor league team,
even if you hail from a town that has housed
one for years. A minor league may lie fine if
you can t get any bettor. However, it seems
that San Francisco ran.
So, come spring 19f>8, if all goes well, stu
dents will have their own home town teams in
their own backyard. For those unfortunates
who come from hereabouls and oilier Pacific
t .oast cities, ihere may have lo he sonic switch
ing of allegiance. However, this will all he
overcome, we suspect, when World Series time
comes near.
What a lirsl week hack al Stanford if the
Giants should gel into a World Series! So near
the beginning <>{ {he quarter there wouldn't be
any worries over cutting classes, the weather
should he heauliful, and allowances healthy.
Here's (o ma jor league hall in San Francisco
and a quick \\ orld Scries out here, although
we're Dodger rooters ourselves.
