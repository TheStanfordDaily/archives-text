# 37 SENIORS
## Air Force Cadets Receive Flight Training in Palo Alto 
### Bruce Smith 
Stanford AFROTC cadets no longer have to wait until they get
their commissions to learn to fly. Since January 37 seniors have
been taking flight instruction at the Palo Alto Airport from a pri
vate flying school at Air Force expense.
The program is limited to those cadets who intend to take flight

training wnen rney enter tlie Air
Force; it is nol a "give-away"
program.
"Eager Hunch"
According to Major William
Stobie, assistant professor of air
science, the cadets in the program
are an "eager bunch," and sev
eral have already finished their
allotted 36Vis hours of flying.
The three main purposes of
the program are to provide an
additional incentive for AFROTC
cadets to choose flying careers,
to give them a little extra train
ing before they start flying with
the USAF and to v\teed out those
who cannot adjust to flying be
fore they have a chance to wreck
expensive military aircraft, Ma
jor Stobie said.
I .ikes Program
Colonel Arthur S. Blum, pro
fessor of air science, is also very
pleased willi the new flying pro
gram.
"The program al Stanford Uni
versity has been highly success
ful from its inception in January.
From the interest shown by ca
dets it is apparent that the pro
gram has been an excellent matu
rational device for prospective
Air Force pilots," he said.
