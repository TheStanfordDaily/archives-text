The felonious assault trial of
Donald A. Rutherdale Jr., 19, and
Donald L. Hawkins, 18, concluded
on its third day in San Mateo
County Superior Cour t yesterday.
Judge Wayne R. Milligan, who
has been conducting the trial with
out a jury, will return, a verdict
at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow.
The two defendants, and anoth
er who has already pleaded guilty,
appeared on the stand for the
first time yesterday to give their
versions of the events at the April
12 beach party. Their versions
contradicted, in some major
points, the evidence presented
Monday and Tuesday by the pros
ecution's witnesses.
Louis Marks, 19, of Palo Alto,
had confessed Friday to charges
that he kicked Dean Reiser, 20,
on the head as Keiser Jay on the
ground after allegedly being hit
by another of Ihe defendants.
Keiser was in a hospital for 17
days as a result of his beating,
with a possible skull fracture. His
injury has been the main poirvt on
which the prosecution has based
the charge of "assault with force
likely to result in great physical
injury."
Green Sport Coat
Marks, wearing a green spoil
coM with a red tie, was brought
to court in custody of a county
sheriff's officer. He is in jail for
an offense committed Inst week.
He testified he saw Hawkins hit
Keiser. Hawkins admitted in his
testimony later that he had hit
Keiser and thai Keiser fell.
Only one of the prosecution's
witnesses, W. Ralph Schaefer, has
said that Hawkins was the one
who hit Keiser. Keiser himself
identified his attacker as Ruther
dale.
Marks also admitted that he had
knocked Keiser down wilh a
"shoulder block."
Rutherdale was called by his
own attorney to testify that he
had not hit Keiser. Ho, too, came

to court from his county jail cell.
He said that the first blow he
had seen was Marks' body block
(in Keiser. The blow with a stick
which he had reportedly dealt Kei
ser as he lay on the ground actu
ally hit Hawkins, who was astride
Keiser, Rutherdale said.
Did Not Fall
Rutherdale said that someone
had stepped out from the Stan
ford group when the other group
came over, and that he had hit
him, but that the blow did not fell
the Stanford student.
"I might: have said something
about a fight" first, he admitted.
"I can't remember saying for him
to take off his glasses."
Hawkins, when he took the
stand, himself admitted he had
been the one to hit Keiser the first
time, but said Keiser kicked him
first and that he then swung
around and hit him "with my open
hand."
Hawkins, whose attorney, .Jo
seph Lewis, sometimes had to
simplify his questions before they
were understood, said, "He | Kei
ser | went on the ground and tried
to kick back, and I got on top of
him and went hitting him."
He said Marks then kicked Kei
ser with a heavy service boot, and
Hawkins told Marks, "Lay off,
Lou, and the rest of you, 'cause
he's all mine."
Stick "Busted"
Hawkins said he was then hit
on the head with a stick that as
"soon as it hit me it busted," and
that he leaped up and caught the
person he thought had hit him,
and slapped him. He then got
ba'-k on "the boy 1 had hit before."
A boy, since identified as Ed
Preader Jr., 17, then hit Keiser
with a stick. Preader has been
given a suspended sentence by the
California Youth Authority, on
grounds that this was his first
offense.
Burdeli House, one of attorney
Lewis' "character witnesses" for
Hawkins, said he had seen flaw
kins kicked by one of the Stanford
students before Hawkins hit back.
When asked later by prosecutor
Rouse who it was that had kicked
Keiser on the ground, he refused
to answer "on the grounds that it
might tend to incriminale me."
Cited for Contempt
Judge Milligan cited House for
contempt, whereupon Lewis vyalk
ed over and whispered to House
that it was all right to answer the
question. House then told the
court that Marks had kicked
Keiser.
While cross-examining Ruther
dale earlier, Rouse had asked him
whether or not it was true that,
while in jail, he had threatened
House "that you would kill him
if he hurt you or Marks."
The question was objected to

by attorney Woodman and sus
tained by Judge Milligan on the
grounds of insufficient back
ground as House had not yet tes
tified.
The question of a threat to a
witness was not brought up again,
but some reporters wondered if
House's refusal to testify might
have been caused by the alleged
threat.
Character Witnesses
Character witnesses for Haw
kins included a Stanford student
who had been at the beach party,
Thomas Frost, 20.
Frost said that one of Hie gang
members had come to the Stan
ford group earlier and told them
that the others would come over
later to fight, and to say that
"they were afraid and they would
not gel hurt." Frost said Hawkins
had been with the man who warn
ed them.
The prosecution, in its summa
ry, based its case against Haw
kins on the testified fact that he
was a principal in the fight, not
necessarily on whether he had
committed "great physical in
jury."
Rouse emphasized that the gang
had come to the Stanford fire ex
pressly to assault the students,
thereby proving "ability and in
tent."
The case against Rutherdale is
that ho had struck Schaefer with
a board and that he had struck
others with his fists. Rouse cited
cases to show that fists have been
considered to have the "power to
commit great physical injury."
Lewis summarized that Haw
kins hit Keiser only after being
provoked, and emphasized that he
had not been belligerent at first.
Great Physical Injury
Woodman stated that the law
measured ability to create great
physical injury by the amount of
d;imago done, and emphasized
that the force with which Ruther
dale hit Schaefer did not leave
marks of great injury, lie pointed
out that there were three differ
ent versions of how Keiser had
been knocked down.
If found guilty tomorrow, the
two youths are liable to sentences
of from one to 10 years in jail and
$3000 fines.
Five juveniles, including two
who testified yesterday, have al
ready boon tried or arc awaiting
trial by the California Youth Au
thority. Two of the five includ
ing one who was recognized by
witness Peter Trotter. 20. of Stan
ford as carrying a knife have
l>oon sentenced to CYA; two, in
cluding the youth who hit Keiser
with a board, have suspended sen
tences, and one has been returned
to the custody of his parents.

Stick "Busted"
Hawkins said he was then hit
on the head with a stick that as
"soon as it hit me it busted," and
that he leaped up and caught the
person he thought had hit him,
and slapped him. He then got
ba'-k on "the boy 1 had hit before."
A boy, since identified as Ed
Preader Jr., 17, then hit Keiser
with a stick. Preader has been
given a suspended sentence by the
California Youth Authority, on
grounds that this was his first
offense.
Burdeli House, one of attorney
Lewis' "character witnesses" for
Hawkins, said he had seen flaw
kins kicked by one of the Stanford
students before Hawkins hit back.
When asked later by prosecutor
Rouse who it was that had kicked
Keiser on the ground, he refused
to answer "on the grounds that it
might tend to incriminale me."
Cited for Contempt
Judge Milligan cited House for
contempt, whereupon Lewis vyalk
ed over and whispered to House
that it was all right to answer the
question. House then told the
court that Marks had kicked
Keiser.
While cross-examining Ruther
dale earlier, Rouse had asked him
whether or not it was true that,
while in jail, he had threatened
House "that you would kill him
if he hurt you or Marks."
The question was objected to

by attorney Woodman and sus
tained by Judge Milligan on the
grounds of insufficient back
ground as House had not yet tes
tified.
The question of a threat to a
witness was not brought up again,
but some reporters wondered if
House's refusal to testify might
have been caused by the alleged
threat.
Character Witnesses
Character witnesses for Haw
kins included a Stanford student
who had been at the beach party,
Thomas Frost, 20.
Frost said that one of Hie gang
members had come to the Stan
ford group earlier and told them
that the others would come over
later to fight, and to say that
"they were afraid and they would
not gel hurt." Frost said Hawkins
had been with the man who warn
ed them.
The prosecution, in its summa
ry, based its case against Haw
kins on the testified fact that he
was a principal in the fight, not
necessarily on whether he had
committed "great physical in
jury."
Rouse emphasized that the gang
had come to the Stanford fire ex
pressly to assault the students,
thereby proving "ability and in
tent."
The case against Rutherdale is
that ho had struck Schaefer with
a board and that he had struck
others with his fists. Rouse cited
cases to show that fists have been
considered to have the "power to
commit great physical injury."
Lewis summarized that Haw
kins hit Keiser only after being
provoked, and emphasized that he
had not been belligerent at first.
Great Physical Injury
Woodman stated that the law
measured ability to create great
physical injury by the amount of
d;imago done, and emphasized
that the force with which Ruther
dale hit Schaefer did not leave
marks of great injury, lie pointed
out that there were three differ
ent versions of how Keiser had
been knocked down.
If found guilty tomorrow, the
two youths are liable to sentences
of from one to 10 years in jail and
$3000 fines.
Five juveniles, including two
who testified yesterday, have al
ready boon tried or arc awaiting
trial by the California Youth Au
thority. Two of the five includ
ing one who was recognized by
witness Peter Trotter. 20. of Stan
ford as carrying a knife have
l>oon sentenced to CYA; two, in
cluding the youth who hit Keiser
with a board, have suspended sen
tences, and one has been returned
to the custody of his parents.

"I kicked him . .
The felonious assault trial of
Donald A. Rutherdale Jr., 19, and
Donald L. Hawkins, 18, concluded
on its third day in San Mateo
County Superior Cour t yesterday.
Judge Wayne R. Milligan, who
has been conducting the trial with
out a jury, will return, a verdict
at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow.
The two defendants, and anoth
er who has already pleaded guilty,
appeared on the stand for the
first time yesterday to give their
versions of the events at the April
12 beach party. Their versions
contradicted, in some major
points, the evidence presented
Monday and Tuesday by the pros
ecution's witnesses.
Louis Marks, 19, of Palo Alto,
had confessed Friday to charges
that he kicked Dean Reiser, 20,
on the head as Keiser Jay on the
ground after allegedly being hit
by another of Ihe defendants.
Keiser was in a hospital for 17
days as a result of his beating,
with a possible skull fracture. His
injury has been the main poirvt on
which the prosecution has based
the charge of "assault with force
likely to result in great physical
injury."
Green Sport Coat
Marks, wearing a green spoil
coM with a red tie, was brought
to court in custody of a county
sheriff's officer. He is in jail for
an offense committed Inst week.
He testified he saw Hawkins hit
Keiser. Hawkins admitted in his
testimony later that he had hit
Keiser and thai Keiser fell.
Only one of the prosecution's
witnesses, W. Ralph Schaefer, has
said that Hawkins was the one
who hit Keiser. Keiser himself
identified his attacker as Ruther
dale.
Marks also admitted that he had
knocked Keiser down wilh a
"shoulder block."
Rutherdale was called by his
own attorney to testify that he
had not hit Keiser. Ho, too, came

to court from his county jail cell.
He said that the first blow he
had seen was Marks' body block
(in Keiser. The blow with a stick
which he had reportedly dealt Kei
ser as he lay on the ground actu
ally hit Hawkins, who was astride
Keiser, Rutherdale said.
Did Not Fall
Rutherdale said that someone
had stepped out from the Stan
ford group when the other group
came over, and that he had hit
him, but that the blow did not fell
the Stanford student.
"I might: have said something
about a fight" first, he admitted.
"I can't remember saying for him
to take off his glasses."
Hawkins, when he took the
stand, himself admitted he had
been the one to hit Keiser the first
time, but said Keiser kicked him
first and that he then swung
around and hit him "with my open
hand."
Hawkins, whose attorney, .Jo
seph Lewis, sometimes had to
simplify his questions before they
were understood, said, "He | Kei
ser | went on the ground and tried
to kick back, and I got on top of
him and went hitting him."
He said Marks then kicked Kei
ser with a heavy service boot, and
Hawkins told Marks, "Lay off,
Lou, and the rest of you, 'cause
he's all mine."
Stick "Busted"
Hawkins said he was then hit
on the head with a stick that as
"soon as it hit me it busted," and
that he leaped up and caught the

"I kicked him . .
The felonious assault trial of
Donald A. Rutherdale Jr., 19, and
Donald L. Hawkins, 18, concluded
on its third day in San Mateo
County Superior Cour t yesterday.
Judge Wayne R. Milligan, who
has been conducting the trial with
out a jury, will return, a verdict
at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow.
The two defendants, and anoth
er who has already pleaded guilty,
appeared on the stand for the
first time yesterday to give their
versions of the events at the April
12 beach party. Their versions
contradicted, in some major
points, the evidence presented
Monday and Tuesday by the pros
ecution's witnesses.
Louis Marks, 19, of Palo Alto,
had confessed Friday to charges
that he kicked Dean Reiser, 20,
on the head as Keiser Jay on the
ground after allegedly being hit
by another of Ihe defendants.
Keiser was in a hospital for 17
days as a result of his beating,
with a possible skull fracture. His
injury has been the main poirvt on
which the prosecution has based
the charge of "assault with force
likely to result in great physical
injury."
Green Sport Coat
Marks, wearing a green spoil
coM with a red tie, was brought
to court in custody of a county
sheriff's officer. He is in jail for
an offense committed Inst week.
He testified he saw Hawkins hit
Keiser. Hawkins admitted in his
testimony later that he had hit
Keiser and thai Keiser fell.
Only one of the prosecution's
witnesses, W. Ralph Schaefer, has
said that Hawkins was the one
who hit Keiser. Keiser himself
identified his attacker as Ruther
dale.
Marks also admitted that he had
knocked Keiser down wilh a
"shoulder block."
Rutherdale was called by his
own attorney to testify that he
had not hit Keiser. Ho, too, came

to court from his county jail cell.
He said that the first blow he
had seen was Marks' body block
(in Keiser. The blow with a stick
which he had reportedly dealt Kei
ser as he lay on the ground actu
ally hit Hawkins, who was astride
Keiser, Rutherdale said.
Did Not Fall
Rutherdale said that someone
had stepped out from the Stan
ford group when the other group
came over, and that he had hit
him, but that the blow did not fell
the Stanford student.
"I might: have said something
about a fight" first, he admitted.
"I can't remember saying for him
to take off his glasses."
Hawkins, when he took the
stand, himself admitted he had
been the one to hit Keiser the first
time, but said Keiser kicked him
first and that he then swung
around and hit him "with my open
hand."
Hawkins, whose attorney, .Jo
seph Lewis, sometimes had to
simplify his questions before they
were understood, said, "He | Kei
ser | went on the ground and tried
to kick back, and I got on top of
him and went hitting him."
He said Marks then kicked Kei
ser with a heavy service boot, and
Hawkins told Marks, "Lay off,
Lou, and the rest of you, 'cause
he's all mine."
Stick "Busted"
Hawkins said he was then hit
on the head with a stick that as
"soon as it hit me it busted," and
that he leaped up and caught the
person he thought had hit him,
and slapped him. He then got
ba'-k on "the boy 1 had hit before."
A boy, since identified as Ed
Preader Jr., 17, then hit Keiser
with a stick. Preader has been
given a suspended sentence by the
California Youth Authority, on
grounds that this was his first
offense.
Burdeli House, one of attorney
Lewis' "character witnesses" for
Hawkins, said he had seen flaw
kins kicked by one of the Stanford
students before Hawkins hit back.
When asked later by prosecutor
Rouse who it was that had kicked
Keiser on the ground, he refused
to answer "on the grounds that it
might tend to incriminale me."
Cited for Contempt
Judge Milligan cited House for
contempt, whereupon Lewis vyalk
ed over and whispered to House
that it was all right to answer the
question. House then told the
court that Marks had kicked
Keiser.
While cross-examining Ruther
dale earlier, Rouse had asked him
whether or not it was true that,
while in jail, he had threatened
House "that you would kill him
if he hurt you or Marks."
The question was objected to

by attorney Woodman and sus
tained by Judge Milligan on the
grounds of insufficient back
ground as House had not yet tes
tified.
The question of a threat to a
witness was not brought up again,
but some reporters wondered if
House's refusal to testify might
have been caused by the alleged
threat.
Character Witnesses
Character witnesses for Haw
kins included a Stanford student
who had been at the beach party,
Thomas Frost, 20.
Frost said that one of Hie gang
members had come to the Stan
ford group earlier and told them
that the others would come over
later to fight, and to say that
"they were afraid and they would
not gel hurt." Frost said Hawkins
had been with the man who warn
ed them.
The prosecution, in its summa
ry, based its case against Haw
kins on the testified fact that he
was a principal in the fight, not
necessarily on whether he had
committed "great physical in
jury."
Rouse emphasized that the gang
had come to the Stanford fire ex
pressly to assault the students,
thereby proving "ability and in
tent."
The case against Rutherdale is
that ho had struck Schaefer with
a board and that he had struck
others with his fists. Rouse cited
cases to show that fists have been
considered to have the "power to
commit great physical injury."
Lewis summarized that Haw
kins hit Keiser only after being
provoked, and emphasized that he
had not been belligerent at first.
Great Physical Injury
Woodman stated that the law
measured ability to create great
physical injury by the amount of
d;imago done, and emphasized
that the force with which Ruther
dale hit Schaefer did not leave
marks of great injury, lie pointed
out that there were three differ
ent versions of how Keiser had
been knocked down.
If found guilty tomorrow, the
two youths are liable to sentences
of from one to 10 years in jail and
$3000 fines.

first and that he then swung
around and hit him "with my open
hand."
Hawkins, whose attorney, .Jo
seph Lewis, sometimes had to
simplify his questions before they
were understood, said, "He | Kei
ser | went on the ground and tried
to kick back, and I got on top of
him and went hitting him."
He said Marks then kicked Kei
ser with a heavy service boot, and
Hawkins told Marks, "Lay off,
Lou, and the rest of you, 'cause
he's all mine."
Stick "Busted"
Hawkins said he was then hit
on the head with a stick that as
"soon as it hit me it busted," and
that he leaped up and caught the
person he thought had hit him,
and slapped him. He then got
ba'-k on "the boy 1 had hit before."
A boy, since identified as Ed
Preader Jr., 17, then hit Keiser
with a stick. Preader has been
given a suspended sentence by the
California Youth Authority, on
grounds that this was his first
offense.
Burdeli House, one of attorney
Lewis' "character witnesses" for
Hawkins, said he had seen flaw
kins kicked by one of the Stanford
students before Hawkins hit back.
When asked later by prosecutor
Rouse who it was that had kicked
Keiser on the ground, he refused
to answer "on the grounds that it
might tend to incriminale me."
Cited for Contempt
Judge Milligan cited House for
contempt, whereupon Lewis vyalk
ed over and whispered to House
that it was all right to answer the
question. House then told the
court that Marks had kicked
Keiser.
While cross-examining Ruther
dale earlier, Rouse had asked him
whether or not it was true that,
while in jail, he had threatened
House "that you would kill him
if he hurt you or Marks."
The question was objected to

by attorney Woodman and sus
tained by Judge Milligan on the
grounds of insufficient back
ground as House had not yet tes
tified.
The question of a threat to a
witness was not brought up again,
but some reporters wondered if
House's refusal to testify might
have been caused by the alleged
threat.
Character Witnesses
Character witnesses for Haw
kins included a Stanford student
who had been at the beach party,
Thomas Frost, 20.
Frost said that one of Hie gang
members had come to the Stan
ford group earlier and told them
that the others would come over
later to fight, and to say that
"they were afraid and they would
not gel hurt." Frost said Hawkins
had been with the man who warn
ed them.
The prosecution, in its summa
ry, based its case against Haw
kins on the testified fact that he
was a principal in the fight, not
necessarily on whether he had
committed "great physical in
jury."
Rouse emphasized that the gang
had come to the Stanford fire ex
pressly to assault the students,
thereby proving "ability and in
tent."
The case against Rutherdale is
that ho had struck Schaefer with
a board and that he had struck
others with his fists. Rouse cited
cases to show that fists have been
considered to have the "power to
commit great physical injury."
Lewis summarized that Haw
kins hit Keiser only after being
provoked, and emphasized that he
had not been belligerent at first.
Great Physical Injury
Woodman stated that the law
measured ability to create great
physical injury by the amount of
d;imago done, and emphasized
that the force with which Ruther
dale hit Schaefer did not leave
marks of great injury, lie pointed
out that there were three differ
ent versions of how Keiser had
been knocked down.
If found guilty tomorrow, the
two youths are liable to sentences
of from one to 10 years in jail and
$3000 fines.
Five juveniles, including two
who testified yesterday, have al
ready boon tried or arc awaiting
trial by the California Youth Au
thority. Two of the five includ
ing one who was recognized by
witness Peter Trotter. 20. of Stan
ford as carrying a knife have
l>oon sentenced to CYA; two, in
cluding the youth who hit Keiser
with a board, have suspended sen
tences, and one has been returned
to the custody of his parents.

knocked Keiser down wilh a
"shoulder block."
Rutherdale was called by his
own attorney to testify that he
had not hit Keiser. Ho, too, came

to court from his county jail cell.
He said that the first blow he
had seen was Marks' body block
(in Keiser. The blow with a stick
which he had reportedly dealt Kei
ser as he lay on the ground actu
ally hit Hawkins, who was astride
Keiser, Rutherdale said.
Did Not Fall
Rutherdale said that someone
had stepped out from the Stan
ford group when the other group
came over, and that he had hit
him, but that the blow did not fell
the Stanford student.
"I might: have said something
about a fight" first, he admitted.
"I can't remember saying for him
to take off his glasses."

stand, himself admitted he had
been the one to hit Keiser the first
time, but said Keiser kicked him
first and that he then swung
