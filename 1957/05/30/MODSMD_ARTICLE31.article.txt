## 
### Dick Barnes 
Frank Herrmann seeks his 12th
and 13th consecutive broad jump
victories of the season tomorrow
and Saturday nights as Payton
Jordan's Indian track leam moves
twu steps closer to the NCAA
championships.
Four Tribesmen — Herrmann,
Chuck Cobb, Fred Peters and Phil
Fehlen will compete tomorrow
nighi in theCompton Invitational.
On Saturday 13 men will go to
Stockton tor the Pacific Associa
tion AAII meet.

Other meets left on the Indians'
slate are the California AAU on
June 8 and the NCAA June 14-15.
In addition, several men will com
pete for the Olympic Club at the
National AAU in late June.
Besides hoping to keep his 1957
broad jump record unblemished,
Herrmann hopes to crack Gay
Bryan's Stanford record of 25-5 Va.
The Indian senior has jumped 25-3
already this year and has estab
lished himself as king of West
Coast leapers.
Same Opponents
Herrmann will be meeting es
sentially the same group of oppo
nents lie has already beaten in
the West Coast Relays, Coliseum
Relays and Modesto Relays and
is the favorite in both meets.

Frank Herrmann was pre
sented the Irving S. Ziemer Me

Coach Payton Jordan cited
Herrmann's excellent leader

record in announcing the award.

Long, John Bugge and Jim

hurdle races at Compton and will
be against plenty of stiff opposi
tion in both events. Ancel Robin
son, Milt Campbell and Olympic
champion Lee Calhoun are con
sidered the best bets to win.
Peters' chief aim tomorrow eve
ning will be to beat the three men
who have been edging him all
year—Parry O'Brien, Rink Babka
and Fortune Gordien. Peters, who
has thrown 172-8 this year, finish
ed fourth behind this trio in both
of last week's relay meets.
Dumas Favored
Fehlen, too, will be facing some
old nemeses at Compton. Charley
Dumas, the world-record holder,
will be the natural favorite. Last
week at the Coliseum, Dumas was
over at 7% when the bar decided
to barely slip off. Fehlen's best
of the year was an early-season
jump of 6-BV-i.
John Kelly, frosh ace who was
slated to appear in the hop-step
jump, will not compete after be
ing on the target end of an ex
pense dispute with the Compton
officials. After issuing an invita
tion to Kelly, the meet manage
ment suddenly decided it couldn't
pay his way as it is doing with
all the other competitors.
The AAU meet, an annual fix
ture for northern California per
formers, promises to produce
some fairly good marks. Indians
who will be present, in addition
to the four who are competing
at Compton, are Jim Backstrand,
Len Bates, Don Chesarek, Maury
Graves, Kent Hansen, Kirk Nie
land, Norm Pease, Chris Plain and
Hank Roldan.
Graves in Mile
Jordan will be especially look
ing at Graves, who is entered in
the mile. Last week at Modesto
the Stanford junior turned the
four Japs in 4:14.8, his best-ever
mark. Graves will be prepping
for the two-mile, which he will
run in the NCAA meet.
A week from Saturday, at Ba
kersfield, the Tribe will send at
least nine entrants to Ihe All-Cali
fornia AAU spikefest. Jordan said
that Backstrand, Bates, Chesarek,
Cobb, Hansen, Herrmann, Nie
land, Plain and Roldan had Ihus
far submitted entries for the meet.
It will be the first of it£ kind
to be held in California. Formerly

each of the AAU sections within
California had held its own meet,
but there had been no state-wide
affair. Early entries indicate that
practically all the top trackmen
in the state will be taking part,
making for one of the better at
tractions of the year.
NCAA Heads List
The big meet of the year, of
course, will be the NCAA battle
in Austin, Tex. Various confer
ence aod NCAA edicts will keep
USC, UCLA, Washington and
Ohio State out of the meet, but it
nonetheless shapes up as an ex
cellent light for both team and
individual honors.
Villanova is the early favorite
to take team honors, with almost
sure first-place p o in t s coming
from 440 man Charlie Jenkins
and miler Ron Delany and place
points expected from high-jumper
Phil Reavis and pole-vaulter Don
Bragg.
Villanova is by no means a top
heavy favorite, with Texas, Kan
sas, California, Abilene Christian,
Occidental and Stanford all given
a chance to place high.
Jordan Expects 30
Jordan expects the winning
team to tally about 36 points and
adds that "I think we«can score
in the 30's." Herrmann, Cobb,
Peters, Roldan, Nieland and Feh
len look to be the most likely
scorers for the Indians, with Che
sarek and Graves also having a
fair chance to make points.
Even if Herrmann goes into the
meet still possessing his unbeaten
record, he will not be the broad
jump favorite. That hondr goes
to Greg Bell, Olympic and NCAA
champion from Indiana. Bell
ranks as one of the world's most
consistent jumpers and is given
an excellent chance to break Jesse
Owens' world record of 2G-8!4, the
oldest mark on the track record
books.
Peters After Oerter
Peters will be meeting just one
man with a better mark than he
has—Olympic champ A 1 Oerter of
Kansas. But Oerter was defeated
by Peters twice last weekend and
may be ripe to be upset in the
collegiate championships.
Cobb will have a tough time
scoring in the high sticks, with
Calhoun, Robinson and a host of
other 14-flat men running against
him. But in the lows, probably his
better race, Cobb stands a good
chance to place.
Javelin throwers Roldan and
Nieland should combine to give
the Tribe its strongest one-two
punch in any event. With USC's
Bob Voiles not slated to compete,
the field is wide open. In practice
this week Nieland has been hit
ting the 230-foot mark as a result
of a new technique.
Nieland Fifth in '56
The fight won't be an easy one
for Roldan and Nieland, since
John Fromm of Pacific Lutheran
and Ken Yob of Colorado also
rank high nationally. Nieland,
however, came through with a
fifth in last year's NCAA meet
and has the experience of tough
competition. This, coupled with
Roldan's consistency, may give
the Indians a bagful of points.
Fehlen will be in possibly the
most wide-open competition of the
meet. The nation's best collegiate
high jumper, Don Stewart, is also
the most inconsistent, ranging all
the way from 6-1 to 6-10 in one
week.
With Reavis, Wilt Chamberlain,
Fehlen and several other 6-6 or
better jumpers in the field, the
title could go to almost anyone.
Tobacco, Ellis Out
Chesarek will go in the 440.
Terry Tobacco and Russ Ellis, the
chief West Coast threats, won't
be in the meet, but the field is
still loaded with other top run
ners. In the two-mile Graves will
battle a big field of the nation's
best distance men.
Two other Indians - Chris Plain
and Kent Hansen may win a trip
to Austin if they come through
with go o d performances this
weekend. Plain will have to put
the'shot 53 feet, while Hansen
must leap 24 feet to gain Ihe Irip.
Jordan also said lhat the Olym
pic Club has thus far invited three
Stanford men to compefe with
them in the AAU meet at Dayton
Herrmann, Cobb and Peters.

Javelin throwers Roldan and
Nieland should combine to give
the Tribe its strongest one-two
punch in any event. With USC's
Bob Voiles not slated to compete,
the field is wide open. In practice
this week Nieland has been hit
ting the 230-foot mark as a result
of a new technique.
Nieland Fifth in '56
The fight won't be an easy one
for Roldan and Nieland, since
John Fromm of Pacific Lutheran
and Ken Yob of Colorado also
rank high nationally. Nieland,
however, came through with a
fifth in last year's NCAA meet
and has the experience of tough
competition. This, coupled with
Roldan's consistency, may give
the Indians a bagful of points.
Fehlen will be in possibly the
most wide-open competition of the
meet. The nation's best collegiate
high jumper, Don Stewart, is also
the most inconsistent, ranging all
the way from 6-1 to 6-10 in one
week.
With Reavis, Wilt Chamberlain,
Fehlen and several other 6-6 or
better jumpers in the field, the
title could go to almost anyone.
Tobacco, Ellis Out
Chesarek will go in the 440.
Terry Tobacco and Russ Ellis, the
chief West Coast threats, won't
be in the meet, but the field is
still loaded with other top run
ners. In the two-mile Graves will
battle a big field of the nation's
best distance men.
Two other Indians - Chris Plain
and Kent Hansen may win a trip
to Austin if they come through
with go o d performances this
weekend. Plain will have to put
the'shot 53 feet, while Hansen
must leap 24 feet to gain Ihe Irip.
Jordan also said lhat the Olym
pic Club has thus far invited three
Stanford men to compefe with
them in the AAU meet at Dayton
Herrmann, Cobb and Peters.
Frank Herrmann seeks his 12th
and 13th consecutive broad jump
victories of the season tomorrow
and Saturday nights as Payton
Jordan's Indian track leam moves
twu steps closer to the NCAA
championships.
Four Tribesmen — Herrmann,
Chuck Cobb, Fred Peters and Phil
Fehlen will compete tomorrow
nighi in theCompton Invitational.
On Saturday 13 men will go to
Stockton tor the Pacific Associa

Other meets left on the Indians'
slate are the California AAU on
June 8 and the NCAA June 14-15.
In addition, several men will com
pete for the Olympic Club at the
National AAU in late June.
Besides hoping to keep his 1957
broad jump record unblemished,
Herrmann hopes to crack Gay
Bryan's Stanford record of 25-5 Va.
The Indian senior has jumped 25-3
already this year and has estab

hurdle races at Compton and will
be against plenty of stiff opposi

champion Lee Calhoun are con
sidered the best bets to win.
Peters' chief aim tomorrow eve
ning will be to beat the three men
who have been edging him all
year—Parry O'Brien, Rink Babka
and Fortune Gordien. Peters, who
has thrown 172-8 this year, finish
ed fourth behind this trio in both
of last week's relay meets.
Dumas Favored
Fehlen, too, will be facing some
old nemeses at Compton. Charley
Dumas, the world-record holder,
will be the natural favorite. Last
week at the Coliseum, Dumas was
over at 7% when the bar decided
to barely slip off. Fehlen's best
of the year was an early-season
jump of 6-BV-i.
John Kelly, frosh ace who was
slated to appear in the hop-step
jump, will not compete after be

officials. After issuing an invita

ment suddenly decided it couldn't

all the other competitors.
The AAU meet, an annual fix
ture for northern California per
formers, promises to produce
some fairly good marks. Indians
who will be present, in addition
to the four who are competing
at Compton, are Jim Backstrand,
Len Bates, Don Chesarek, Maury
Graves, Kent Hansen, Kirk Nie
land, Norm Pease, Chris Plain and
Hank Roldan.
Graves in Mile
Jordan will be especially look
ing at Graves, who is entered in
the mile. Last week at Modesto
the Stanford junior turned the
four Japs in 4:14.8, his best-ever
mark. Graves will be prepping
for the two-mile, which he will
run in the NCAA meet.
A week from Saturday, at Ba
kersfield, the Tribe will send at
least nine entrants to Ihe All-Cali
fornia AAU spikefest. Jordan said
that Backstrand, Bates, Chesarek,
Cobb, Hansen, Herrmann, Nie
land, Plain and Roldan had Ihus
far submitted entries for the meet.
It will be the first of it£ kind
to be held in California. Formerly

each of the AAU sections within
California had held its own meet,
but there had been no state-wide
affair. Early entries indicate that
practically all the top trackmen
in the state will be taking part,
making for one of the better at
tractions of the year.
NCAA Heads List
The big meet of the year, of
course, will be the NCAA battle
in Austin, Tex. Various confer
ence aod NCAA edicts will keep
USC, UCLA, Washington and
Ohio State out of the meet, but it
nonetheless shapes up as an ex
cellent light for both team and
individual honors.
Villanova is the early favorite
to take team honors, with almost
sure first-place p o in t s coming
from 440 man Charlie Jenkins
and miler Ron Delany and place
points expected from high-jumper
Phil Reavis and pole-vaulter Don
Bragg.
Villanova is by no means a top
heavy favorite, with Texas, Kan
sas, California, Abilene Christian,
Occidental and Stanford all given
a chance to place high.
Jordan Expects 30
Jordan expects the winning
team to tally about 36 points and
adds that "I think we«can score
in the 30's." Herrmann, Cobb,
Peters, Roldan, Nieland and Feh
len look to be the most likely
scorers for the Indians, with Che
sarek and Graves also having a
fair chance to make points.
Even if Herrmann goes into the
meet still possessing his unbeaten
record, he will not be the broad
jump favorite. That hondr goes
to Greg Bell, Olympic and NCAA
champion from Indiana. Bell
ranks as one of the world's most
consistent jumpers and is given
an excellent chance to break Jesse
Owens' world record of 2G-8!4, the
oldest mark on the track record
books.
Peters After Oerter
Peters will be meeting just one
man with a better mark than he
has—Olympic champ A 1 Oerter of
Kansas. But Oerter was defeated
by Peters twice last weekend and
may be ripe to be upset in the
collegiate championships.
Cobb will have a tough time
scoring in the high sticks, with
Calhoun, Robinson and a host of
other 14-flat men running against
him. But in the lows, probably his
better race, Cobb stands a good
chance to place.
Javelin throwers Roldan and
Nieland should combine to give
the Tribe its strongest one-two
punch in any event. With USC's
Bob Voiles not slated to compete,
the field is wide open. In practice

USC, UCLA, Washington and
Ohio State out of the meet, but it
nonetheless shapes up as an ex
cellent light for both team and
individual honors.
Villanova is the early favorite
to take team honors, with almost
sure first-place p o in t s coming
from 440 man Charlie Jenkins
and miler Ron Delany and place
points expected from high-jumper
Phil Reavis and pole-vaulter Don
Bragg.
Villanova is by no means a top
heavy favorite, with Texas, Kan
sas, California, Abilene Christian,
Occidental and Stanford all given
a chance to place high.
Jordan Expects 30
Jordan expects the winning
team to tally about 36 points and
adds that "I think we«can score
in the 30's." Herrmann, Cobb,
Peters, Roldan, Nieland and Feh
len look to be the most likely
scorers for the Indians, with Che
sarek and Graves also having a
fair chance to make points.
Even if Herrmann goes into the
meet still possessing his unbeaten
record, he will not be the broad
jump favorite. That hondr goes
to Greg Bell, Olympic and NCAA
champion from Indiana. Bell
ranks as one of the world's most
consistent jumpers and is given
an excellent chance to break Jesse
Owens' world record of 2G-8!4, the
oldest mark on the track record
books.
Peters After Oerter
Peters will be meeting just one
man with a better mark than he
has—Olympic champ A 1 Oerter of
Kansas. But Oerter was defeated
by Peters twice last weekend and
may be ripe to be upset in the
collegiate championships.
Cobb will have a tough time
scoring in the high sticks, with
Calhoun, Robinson and a host of
other 14-flat men running against
him. But in the lows, probably his
better race, Cobb stands a good
chance to place.
Javelin throwers Roldan and
Nieland should combine to give
the Tribe its strongest one-two
punch in any event. With USC's
Bob Voiles not slated to compete,
the field is wide open. In practice
this week Nieland has been hit
ting the 230-foot mark as a result
of a new technique.
Nieland Fifth in '56
The fight won't be an easy one
for Roldan and Nieland, since
John Fromm of Pacific Lutheran
and Ken Yob of Colorado also
rank high nationally. Nieland,
however, came through with a
fifth in last year's NCAA meet
and has the experience of tough
competition. This, coupled with
Roldan's consistency, may give
the Indians a bagful of points.
Fehlen will be in possibly the
most wide-open competition of the
meet. The nation's best collegiate
high jumper, Don Stewart, is also
the most inconsistent, ranging all
the way from 6-1 to 6-10 in one
week.
With Reavis, Wilt Chamberlain,
Fehlen and several other 6-6 or
better jumpers in the field, the
title could go to almost anyone.
Tobacco, Ellis Out
Chesarek will go in the 440.
Terry Tobacco and Russ Ellis, the
chief West Coast threats, won't
be in the meet, but the field is
still loaded with other top run
ners. In the two-mile Graves will
battle a big field of the nation's
best distance men.
Two other Indians - Chris Plain
and Kent Hansen may win a trip
to Austin if they come through
with go o d performances this
weekend. Plain will have to put
the'shot 53 feet, while Hansen
must leap 24 feet to gain Ihe Irip.
Jordan also said lhat the Olym

Stanford men to compefe with

Herrmann, Cobb and Peters.

who have been edging him all
year—Parry O'Brien, Rink Babka
and Fortune Gordien. Peters, who
has thrown 172-8 this year, finish
ed fourth behind this trio in both
of last week's relay meets.
Dumas Favored
Fehlen, too, will be facing some
old nemeses at Compton. Charley
Dumas, the world-record holder,
will be the natural favorite. Last
week at the Coliseum, Dumas was
over at 7% when the bar decided
to barely slip off. Fehlen's best
of the year was an early-season
jump of 6-BV-i.
John Kelly, frosh ace who was
slated to appear in the hop-step

all the other competitors.
The AAU meet, an annual fix
ture for northern California per
formers, promises to produce
some fairly good marks. Indians
who will be present, in addition
to the four who are competing
at Compton, are Jim Backstrand,
Len Bates, Don Chesarek, Maury
Graves, Kent Hansen, Kirk Nie
land, Norm Pease, Chris Plain and
Hank Roldan.
Graves in Mile
Jordan will be especially look
ing at Graves, who is entered in
the mile. Last week at Modesto
the Stanford junior turned the
four Japs in 4:14.8, his best-ever
mark. Graves will be prepping
for the two-mile, which he will
run in the NCAA meet.
A week from Saturday, at Ba
kersfield, the Tribe will send at
least nine entrants to Ihe All-Cali
fornia AAU spikefest. Jordan said
that Backstrand, Bates, Chesarek,
Cobb, Hansen, Herrmann, Nie
land, Plain and Roldan had Ihus
far submitted entries for the meet.
It will be the first of it£ kind
to be held in California. Formerly

each of the AAU sections within
California had held its own meet,
but there had been no state-wide
affair. Early entries indicate that
practically all the top trackmen
in the state will be taking part,
making for one of the better at
tractions of the year.

jump of 6-BV-i.

pay his way as it is doing with
all the other competitors.
The AAU meet, an annual fix
ture for northern California per
formers, promises to produce
some fairly good marks. Indians
who will be present, in addition
to the four who are competing
at Compton, are Jim Backstrand,
Len Bates, Don Chesarek, Maury
Graves, Kent Hansen, Kirk Nie
land, Norm Pease, Chris Plain and
Hank Roldan.
Graves in Mile
Jordan will be especially look
ing at Graves, who is entered in
the mile. Last week at Modesto
the Stanford junior turned the
four Japs in 4:14.8, his best-ever
mark. Graves will be prepping
for the two-mile, which he will
run in the NCAA meet.
A week from Saturday, at Ba
kersfield, the Tribe will send at
least nine entrants to Ihe All-Cali
fornia AAU spikefest. Jordan said
that Backstrand, Bates, Chesarek,
Cobb, Hansen, Herrmann, Nie
land, Plain and Roldan had Ihus
far submitted entries for the meet.
It will be the first of it£ kind
to be held in California. Formerly

each of the AAU sections within
California had held its own meet,
but there had been no state-wide
affair. Early entries indicate that
practically all the top trackmen
in the state will be taking part,
making for one of the better at
tractions of the year.
NCAA Heads List
The big meet of the year, of
course, will be the NCAA battle
in Austin, Tex. Various confer
ence aod NCAA edicts will keep
USC, UCLA, Washington and
Ohio State out of the meet, but it
nonetheless shapes up as an ex
cellent light for both team and
individual honors.
Villanova is the early favorite
to take team honors, with almost
sure first-place p o in t s coming
from 440 man Charlie Jenkins
and miler Ron Delany and place
points expected from high-jumper
Phil Reavis and pole-vaulter Don
Bragg.
Villanova is by no means a top
heavy favorite, with Texas, Kan
sas, California, Abilene Christian,
Occidental and Stanford all given
a chance to place high.
Jordan Expects 30
Jordan expects the winning
team to tally about 36 points and
adds that "I think we«can score
in the 30's." Herrmann, Cobb,
Peters, Roldan, Nieland and Feh
len look to be the most likely
scorers for the Indians, with Che
sarek and Graves also having a
fair chance to make points.
Even if Herrmann goes into the
meet still possessing his unbeaten
record, he will not be the broad
jump favorite. That hondr goes
to Greg Bell, Olympic and NCAA
champion from Indiana. Bell
ranks as one of the world's most
consistent jumpers and is given
an excellent chance to break Jesse
Owens' world record of 2G-8!4, the
oldest mark on the track record
books.
Peters After Oerter
Peters will be meeting just one
man with a better mark than he
has—Olympic champ A 1 Oerter of
Kansas. But Oerter was defeated
by Peters twice last weekend and
may be ripe to be upset in the
collegiate championships.
Cobb will have a tough time
scoring in the high sticks, with
Calhoun, Robinson and a host of
other 14-flat men running against
him. But in the lows, probably his
better race, Cobb stands a good
chance to place.
Javelin throwers Roldan and
Nieland should combine to give
the Tribe its strongest one-two
punch in any event. With USC's
Bob Voiles not slated to compete,
the field is wide open. In practice
this week Nieland has been hit
ting the 230-foot mark as a result
of a new technique.
Nieland Fifth in '56
The fight won't be an easy one
for Roldan and Nieland, since
John Fromm of Pacific Lutheran
and Ken Yob of Colorado also
rank high nationally. Nieland,
however, came through with a
fifth in last year's NCAA meet
and has the experience of tough
competition. This, coupled with
Roldan's consistency, may give
the Indians a bagful of points.
Fehlen will be in possibly the
most wide-open competition of the
meet. The nation's best collegiate
high jumper, Don Stewart, is also
the most inconsistent, ranging all
the way from 6-1 to 6-10 in one
week.
With Reavis, Wilt Chamberlain,
Fehlen and several other 6-6 or
better jumpers in the field, the
title could go to almost anyone.
Tobacco, Ellis Out
Chesarek will go in the 440.
Terry Tobacco and Russ Ellis, the
chief West Coast threats, won't
be in the meet, but the field is
still loaded with other top run
ners. In the two-mile Graves will
battle a big field of the nation's
best distance men.
Two other Indians - Chris Plain
and Kent Hansen may win a trip
to Austin if they come through
with go o d performances this
weekend. Plain will have to put
the'shot 53 feet, while Hansen
must leap 24 feet to gain Ihe Irip.
Jordan also said lhat the Olym
pic Club has thus far invited three
Stanford men to compefe with
them in the AAU meet at Dayton
Herrmann, Cobb and Peters.
Frank Herrmann seeks his 12th
and 13th consecutive broad jump
victories of the season tomorrow

Jordan's Indian track leam moves

championships.
Four Tribesmen — Herrmann,
Chuck Cobb, Fred Peters and Phil
Fehlen will compete tomorrow

Other meets left on the Indians'
slate are the California AAU on
June 8 and the NCAA June 14-15.
In addition, several men will com

National AAU in late June.
Besides hoping to keep his 1957
broad jump record unblemished,
Herrmann hopes to crack Gay
Bryan's Stanford record of 25-5 Va.
The Indian senior has jumped 25-3
already this year and has estab

who have been edging him all
year—Parry O'Brien, Rink Babka
and Fortune Gordien. Peters, who
has thrown 172-8 this year, finish
ed fourth behind this trio in both
of last week's relay meets.
Dumas Favored
Fehlen, too, will be facing some
old nemeses at Compton. Charley
Dumas, the world-record holder,
will be the natural favorite. Last
week at the Coliseum, Dumas was
over at 7% when the bar decided
to barely slip off. Fehlen's best
of the year was an early-season
jump of 6-BV-i.

Besides hoping to keep his 1957
broad jump record unblemished,
Herrmann hopes to crack Gay
Bryan's Stanford record of 25-5 Va.
The Indian senior has jumped 25-3
already this year and has estab
lished himself as king of West
Coast leapers.
Same Opponents
Herrmann will be meeting es
sentially the same group of oppo
nents lie has already beaten in
the West Coast Relays, Coliseum
Relays and Modesto Relays and

Frank Herrmann was pre
sented the Irving S. Ziemer Me
morial Trophy, signifying his
selection as tlie "most inspira
tional track and field athlete of
1957," al a 'team banquet last
night.
Coach Payton Jordan cited
Herrmann's excellent leader
ship, ability and competitive
record in announcing the award.
Previous winners of the tro
phy, first awarded in 1952, are
Bob Mat bias, Gerry Wood, Leo
Long, John Bugge and Jim
Saras.

hurdle races at Compton and will
be against plenty of stiff opposi
tion in both events. Ancel Robin
son, Milt Campbell and Olympic
champion Lee Calhoun are con
sidered the best bets to win.
Peters' chief aim tomorrow eve
ning will be to beat the three men
who have been edging him all
year—Parry O'Brien, Rink Babka
and Fortune Gordien. Peters, who
has thrown 172-8 this year, finish
ed fourth behind this trio in both
of last week's relay meets.
Dumas Favored
Fehlen, too, will be facing some
old nemeses at Compton. Charley
Dumas, the world-record holder,
will be the natural favorite. Last
week at the Coliseum, Dumas was
over at 7% when the bar decided
to barely slip off. Fehlen's best
of the year was an early-season
jump of 6-BV-i.
John Kelly, frosh ace who was
slated to appear in the hop-step
jump, will not compete after be
ing on the target end of an ex
pense dispute with the Compton
officials. After issuing an invita
tion to Kelly, the meet manage
ment suddenly decided it couldn't
pay his way as it is doing with
all the other competitors.
The AAU meet, an annual fix
ture for northern California per
formers, promises to produce
some fairly good marks. Indians
who will be present, in addition
to the four who are competing
at Compton, are Jim Backstrand,
Len Bates, Don Chesarek, Maury
Graves, Kent Hansen, Kirk Nie
land, Norm Pease, Chris Plain and
Hank Roldan.
Graves in Mile
Jordan will be especially look
ing at Graves, who is entered in
the mile. Last week at Modesto
the Stanford junior turned the
four Japs in 4:14.8, his best-ever
mark. Graves will be prepping
for the two-mile, which he will
run in the NCAA meet.
A week from Saturday, at Ba
kersfield, the Tribe will send at
least nine entrants to Ihe All-Cali
fornia AAU spikefest. Jordan said
that Backstrand, Bates, Chesarek,
Cobb, Hansen, Herrmann, Nie
land, Plain and Roldan had Ihus
far submitted entries for the meet.
It will be the first of it£ kind
to be held in California. Formerly

each of the AAU sections within
California had held its own meet,
but there had been no state-wide
affair. Early entries indicate that
practically all the top trackmen
in the state will be taking part,
making for one of the better at
tractions of the year.
NCAA Heads List
The big meet of the year, of
course, will be the NCAA battle
in Austin, Tex. Various confer
ence aod NCAA edicts will keep
USC, UCLA, Washington and
Ohio State out of the meet, but it
nonetheless shapes up as an ex
cellent light for both team and
individual honors.
Villanova is the early favorite
to take team honors, with almost
sure first-place p o in t s coming
from 440 man Charlie Jenkins
and miler Ron Delany and place
points expected from high-jumper
Phil Reavis and pole-vaulter Don
Bragg.
Villanova is by no means a top
heavy favorite, with Texas, Kan
sas, California, Abilene Christian,
Occidental and Stanford all given
a chance to place high.
Jordan Expects 30
Jordan expects the winning
team to tally about 36 points and
adds that "I think we«can score
in the 30's." Herrmann, Cobb,
Peters, Roldan, Nieland and Feh
len look to be the most likely
scorers for the Indians, with Che
sarek and Graves also having a
fair chance to make points.
Even if Herrmann goes into the
meet still possessing his unbeaten
record, he will not be the broad
jump favorite. That hondr goes
to Greg Bell, Olympic and NCAA
champion from Indiana. Bell
ranks as one of the world's most
consistent jumpers and is given
an excellent chance to break Jesse
Owens' world record of 2G-8!4, the
oldest mark on the track record
books.
Peters After Oerter
Peters will be meeting just one
man with a better mark than he
has—Olympic champ A 1 Oerter of
Kansas. But Oerter was defeated
by Peters twice last weekend and
may be ripe to be upset in the
collegiate championships.
Cobb will have a tough time
scoring in the high sticks, with
Calhoun, Robinson and a host of
other 14-flat men running against
him. But in the lows, probably his
better race, Cobb stands a good
chance to place.
Javelin throwers Roldan and
Nieland should combine to give
the Tribe its strongest one-two
punch in any event. With USC's
Bob Voiles not slated to compete,
the field is wide open. In practice
this week Nieland has been hit
ting the 230-foot mark as a result
of a new technique.
Nieland Fifth in '56
The fight won't be an easy one
for Roldan and Nieland, since
John Fromm of Pacific Lutheran
and Ken Yob of Colorado also
rank high nationally. Nieland,
however, came through with a
fifth in last year's NCAA meet
and has the experience of tough
competition. This, coupled with
Roldan's consistency, may give
the Indians a bagful of points.
Fehlen will be in possibly the
most wide-open competition of the
meet. The nation's best collegiate
high jumper, Don Stewart, is also
the most inconsistent, ranging all
the way from 6-1 to 6-10 in one
week.
With Reavis, Wilt Chamberlain,
Fehlen and several other 6-6 or
better jumpers in the field, the
title could go to almost anyone.
Tobacco, Ellis Out
Chesarek will go in the 440.
Terry Tobacco and Russ Ellis, the
chief West Coast threats, won't
be in the meet, but the field is
still loaded with other top run
ners. In the two-mile Graves will
battle a big field of the nation's
best distance men.
Two other Indians - Chris Plain
and Kent Hansen may win a trip
to Austin if they come through
with go o d performances this
weekend. Plain will have to put
the'shot 53 feet, while Hansen
must leap 24 feet to gain Ihe Irip.
Jordan also said lhat the Olym
pic Club has thus far invited three
Stanford men to compefe with
them in the AAU meet at Dayton
Herrmann, Cobb and Peters.
