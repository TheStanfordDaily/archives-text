# Douglas Given Good Chance in NCAA Net Play
## 
### Dave Canfield 
No. 1 man Jack Douglas has a
good chance to win the NCAA
singles tennis crown June 15-1G
and Stanford has perhaps an
even better chance to take .the
team title.
That is the opinion advanced
by Bob Renker, coach of the In
dian netters since 1951. Renker
said, "I don't Ihink there's any
team we couldn't beat if you took
our four 1 players against their
four players."
UCLA and IJSC, the only
teams to have whipped the Cards
this year, are ineligible for the
meet.
The NCAA tourney will be
hold in Salt Lake City. "That is
an advantage to us," Renker said,
"because it will be on hard courts
and we play on hard courts."
On clay courts, last year, Stan
ford finished third behind the
Bruins and the Trojans.
Has Beaten Olmedo
Of Douglas' chances, Renker
explained that the Santa Monica
junior has defeated USC's Alex
Olmedo once this year and that
"there's nobody better than Ol
medo."
Renker said Douglas' stiffest
competition would come from
Barry MacKay of the University
of Michigan, Ron I-lolmberg of
Tulane University and Sammy
Giammalva of the University of
Texas.
Both MacKay and Giammalva
are 1957 Davis Cup squad mem
bers but either one may pass up
the NCAA to compete in the
Wimbledon Tournament. Giam
malva, last winter's Davis Cup
sensation, chose Wimbledon over
the NCAA last year.
Holmberg Upset in '50
Holmberg, who was the favor
ite, was defeated in the early
rounds of the 1956 nationals.
Douglas got as far as the quar
terfinals.
If Giammalva should enter, he
will undoubtedly be seeded No. 1
on the basis of his outstanding
record in international play.
The rest of Stanford's team
will be composed of Brooks Raw
lins, Dave Nelson and Gilbert
White. Either Douglas-Nelson or
Rawlins - White could cop the
doubles championship.
Chief competition for the team
title may come ffom Tulane,
which boasts Jose Aguero and
Crawford Henry as well as Holm
berg.
Aguero was NCAA champion
two years ago and is hoping to
come back. But it: is felt that he
may have been left behind by Ihe
"big boys" — MacKay, Giammal
va, Holmberg and Douglas.

Tulane University and Sammy
Giammalva of the University of
Texas.
Both MacKay and Giammalva
are 1957 Davis Cup squad mem
bers but either one may pass up
the NCAA to compete in the
Wimbledon Tournament. Giam
malva, last winter's Davis Cup
sensation, chose Wimbledon over
the NCAA last year.
Holmberg Upset in '50
Holmberg, who was the favor
ite, was defeated in the early
rounds of the 1956 nationals.
Douglas got as far as the quar
terfinals.
If Giammalva should enter, he
will undoubtedly be seeded No. 1
on the basis of his outstanding
record in international play.
The rest of Stanford's team
will be composed of Brooks Raw
lins, Dave Nelson and Gilbert
White. Either Douglas-Nelson or
Rawlins - White could cop the
doubles championship.
Chief competition for the team
title may come ffom Tulane,
which boasts Jose Aguero and
Crawford Henry as well as Holm
berg.
Aguero was NCAA champion
two years ago and is hoping to
come back. But it: is felt that he
may have been left behind by Ihe
"big boys" — MacKay, Giammal
va, Holmberg and Douglas.


JACKIE DOUGLAS
Keeks NCAA Net Crowil
No. 1 man Jack Douglas has a
good chance to win the NCAA
singles tennis crown June 15-1G
and Stanford has perhaps an
even better chance to take .the
team title.
That is the opinion advanced
by Bob Renker, coach of the In
dian netters since 1951. Renker
said, "I don't Ihink there's any
team we couldn't beat if you took
our four 1 players against their
four players."
UCLA and IJSC, the only
teams to have whipped the Cards
this year, are ineligible for the
meet.
The NCAA tourney will be
hold in Salt Lake City. "That is
an advantage to us," Renker said,
"because it will be on hard courts
and we play on hard courts."
On clay courts, last year, Stan
ford finished third behind the
Bruins and the Trojans.
Has Beaten Olmedo
Of Douglas' chances, Renker
explained that the Santa Monica
junior has defeated USC's Alex
Olmedo once this year and that
"there's nobody better than Ol
medo."
Renker said Douglas' stiffest
competition would come from
Barry MacKay of the University
of Michigan, Ron I-lolmberg of
Tulane University and Sammy
Giammalva of the University of
Texas.
Both MacKay and Giammalva
are 1957 Davis Cup squad mem
