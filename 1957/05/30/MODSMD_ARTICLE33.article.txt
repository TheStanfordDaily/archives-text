## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 29 (UP)—
Mayor Robert Wagner appealed
today to the Brooklyn Dodgers
and New York Giants "to recon
sider" leaving New York as a
transcontinental t-ug of war de
veloped for the National League
franchises.
Acting swiftly after National
League club owners voted the
Dodgers permission to move to
Los Angeles and the Giants to go
to San Francisco, Wagner asked
club presidents Walter O'Malley
and Horace Stoneham to meet
with him to discuss their teams'
futures. The meeting was set for
next Monday at 10 a.m. after
O'Malley said he could not see
the mayor today.
At the same time, Mayor Nor
ris Poulson of Los Angeles ar
rived in New York in an attempt
to close a deal which would shift
one of basebands greatest rival
ries 3000 miles across the coun
try. The National League own
ers stipulated at Tuesday's his
toric meeting in Chicago that
they were approving only a
transfer of both clubs to Los An
geles and San Francisco.
In other key developments:
• Stoneham said at a Polo
Grounds press conference that it
would be "practical" for the
Giants to play in Seals' Stadium
next season even though the
park's capacity is only 22,000.
• The Giants' owner pointed
out that the world champion
New York Yankees would gain

"territorial rights" to New York
City, under baseball law. if both
the Dodgers and Giants left. He
said it would be up to the Yan
kees to say whether another Na
tional League team could enter
the city.
• The Seattle and Sacramento
clubs of the Pacific Coast League
said the two New York clubs
would face damage suits totaling
at least $4,700,000 nefore they
could move into the West Coast
territory.
• Minor Leagues President
George Trautman said it was
"most unfortunate" that such
talk of possible franchise switch
es came right in the middle of
the Pacific Coast League season.
• Representative Patrick J.
Hillings (RCalif.) and Represen
tative Kenneth B. Keating (R-
N'.Y.) said in Washington, D.C.,
that the proposed shifts
"strengthen baseball's case" for
favorable legislation in Congress.
Both members of the House Ju
diciary Committee are sponsor
ing bills that would place base
ball under federal anti-trust legis
lation.
Mayor Wagner met early today
with borough presidents Hulan
Jack of Manhattan and John
Cashmore of Brooklyn and then
announced he had asked O'Mal
ley and Stoneham to confer with
him.
"We want the teams to remain
in New York and will do every
thing within reason to keep them
here and to assist them to stay
here," Wagner said. "If they are
committed to move to the West
Coast we will ask them to recon
sider."
Wagner added that he does not
consider the league's "green
light" for the West Coast move
an attempt "to blackjack" the
city into action.
