# Spring Show MC Censured By LASSU
## 
### Stan Gross Associate Editor 
At its last meeting of the year,
Legislature censured the actions
of Bill Crookston in his role as
master of ceremonies of the 1957
Sring Sing. Legislature resolved
as follows:
"Be it resorved:
"That the action of the master
of ceremonies of the 1957 Spring
Sing is not approved of as repre
senting the Stanford student body
or the University.
"Be it further resolved:
"That Rally Commission main
tain adequate supervision of, and
responsibility for, their activi
ties."
Strong Disapproval
This action was taken after a
harsher resolution proposed by
Stern Hall representative Don
Shoup to censure Crookston's ac
tions at the Sing had been defeat
ed. Many of the Legislature ex
pressed strong disapproval of sev
eral jokes he had told and of his
demeanor in general at the Sing.
In other business, Legislature
amended proposed bylaw changes
for the Stanford Quad. The by
law changes proposed that the
outgoing Quad editor be given
general supervisory authority
over the business manager, and
that he appoint the incoming busi
ness manager each year.
The Amendment
The Legislature amendment,
proposed by Shoup, says that the
outgoing editor shall be joined by
the outgoing business manager
and the incoming editor in ap
pointing the incoming business
manager.
Student financial manager Bill
Mathewson suggested that, some
action similar to this be taken
with The Daily, as ho felt The
Daily has similar problems.
The group passed a new consti
tution for Stern Hall and revoked
the old constitution of 1952. Stern
wings are now to be governed
separately.
Legislature approved athletic
awards for freshman and varsity
crew, fjeshman and varsity tennis
and varsity fencing.
President Speaks
At the end of the meeting Bob
Freelen, outgoing ASSU presi
dent, congratulated the outgoing
legislators and said, "You have
left the government better than
you found it."
He told the group that Stanford
is in competition with other pri
vate colleges across the country
in moulding leaders among their
students. "It is up to us," he said,
"to see that Stanford meets this
competition from the eastern
schools."
He then handed the gavel over
to the 1957-58 ASSU president,
Jim Mossinger, who officially ad
journed the meeting.
