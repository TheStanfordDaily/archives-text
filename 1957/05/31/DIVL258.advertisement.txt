...for moving student bodies
Phi Beta Kappas, fraternity
men and WBW's* find that
U-HAUL rental trailers
are handy for toting home
grandfather clocks, the
five-foot shelf of Playboy,
leftover Prom dates and
other miscellaneous
accumulations. You can
haul almost anything in a
low cost U-Haul trailer.
