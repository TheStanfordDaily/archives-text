# London Abolishes Strict Curbs Against Trade With tied China
## U.S. 'Most Disappointed' Over Move, Plans to Maintain Current Embargo 
### 
LONDON, May 30 (UP)—Britain abolished its strict embargo
against trade with Red China today in a move viewed by the United
States as a violation of the free world's "security interests."
Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd told Parliament lhat Britain
! henceforth would let the Chinese Communists have any goods pres-

ently allowed the Soviet Union
and the Eastern European satel
lites under their separate strate
gic embargo.
The move provoked the sharp
est split between London and
Washington since the Suez inva
sion. It meant a major relaxa
tion in the Korean war embargo
enforced until now by 15 West
ern nations. It opened the way
for similar action by other West
ern countries.
"Most Disappointed"
The United States had been in
formed in advance of the British
action and the State Department
immediately declared it was
"most disappointed."
Washington maintained that
most of the other Western coun
tries wanted to continue the sep
arate and stiffer embargo
against .Red China. But informed
British sources said a majority
agreed with Britain—that it. did
not make sense to maintain the
differential between the Soviet
and Red Chinese lits of items
that could be traded.
"Keep Differential"
The United States said it "be
lieved that the security interests
of the free world would he best
promoted by the maintenance of
a significant differential" be
tween the separate embargoes
applied to Red China and the oth
er Communist bloc nations.
Strategic goods are barred to
the Soviet Union and to Red
China under the separate embar
goes, and Lloyd said in his state
ment that the Board of Trade
would continue to ban strategic
goods to Peiping by British mer
chants.
Many Items Cleared
Nevertheless, the way was
cleared for British machinery
and vehicles, among other items,
to find a market in Red China
for the first time. Some 400 items
were banned on the China list,
and only 200 on the Soviet list.
The Board of Trade said the
Chinese Communists would he
able to receive a wide range of
British exports, including certain
machine tools, motor vehicles,
I "some scientific instruments' and
i chemicals.

LONDON, May 30 (UP)—Britain abolished its strict embargo
against trade with Red China today in a move viewed by the United
States as a violation of the free world's "security interests."
Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd told Parliament lhat Britain
! henceforth would let the Chinese Communists have any goods pres-

ently allowed the Soviet Union
and the Eastern European satel
lites under their separate strate
gic embargo.
The move provoked the sharp
est split between London and
Washington since the Suez inva
sion. It meant a major relaxa
tion in the Korean war embargo
enforced until now by 15 West
ern nations. It opened the way
for similar action by other West
ern countries.
"Most Disappointed"
The United States had been in
formed in advance of the British
action and the State Department
immediately declared it was
"most disappointed."
Washington maintained that
most of the other Western coun
tries wanted to continue the sep
arate and stiffer embargo
against .Red China. But informed
British sources said a majority
agreed with Britain—that it. did
not make sense to maintain the
differential between the Soviet
and Red Chinese lits of items
that could be traded.
"Keep Differential"
The United States said it "be
lieved that the security interests
of the free world would he best
promoted by the maintenance of
a significant differential" be
tween the separate embargoes
applied to Red China and the oth
er Communist bloc nations.
Strategic goods are barred to
the Soviet Union and to Red
China under the separate embar
goes, and Lloyd said in his state
ment that the Board of Trade
would continue to ban strategic
goods to Peiping by British mer
chants.
