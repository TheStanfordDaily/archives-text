# It's All Yours, Wally

W i ko\'t want an individualist as editor of
I he Daily.' Ibis was a fairly representative
sentiment expressed by a member of Legisla
ture in Ib«- recent controversy.
II you, W ally, as editor of Volume 132, ever
cease being an individualist, then you are fail
ing your duly of editor.
\ on as editor will have a great deal of re
sponsibility lo inform and stimulate your
readers. on should definitely serve the Stan-
Ion! area to which you are responsible, but, al
the same time, you should avoid falling into
tiie pitfall of always printing something just
because the majority wants il.
•If The Daily or any other paper, for that
matter fails to fight for the things il truly
beln ves in, regardless of what the mass of
readers think, then il is hardly worthy of the
name of a newspaper.
I he Stanford Daily is unique among college
newspapers in that il a 1 1 own you to carry on
your fights and coverage of news, free of re
strictions. There it- no actual control by either
the < lommunicatinn - Journalism department,
the Administration or the student government.
Hut, as events of the last volume showed,
there are people or forces that would like lo
take this unique position away. You step on a
few people's toes, or fail to please a few pub
licity hungry organizations, and ibe cry sounds
from the Legislature to the Dean's office thai
you are a "closed corporation" and are shirking
your duties. .
Yon must then be on constant vigilance

against attempts to restrict your unique posi
tion. They will tell you that "freedom of llit*
pres#.' lias nothing to do with tlie caw, Hut
they an* wrong. "Freedom of the press" is the
principle you arc 4i<rlitin<r for, and never give
up thai light.
But the editorship isn't ail fight, Wally. It is
a great challenge lo keep the campus informed,
i his demands an ever alert and vigilant atti
tude hotli oil \«>111- part and your staff's. And
it will he your job to keep this attitude ever
Hi rong.
N on yourself will gel a lot of rich, wonderful
experiences out of the editorship.
If you continue lo fight for what you believe
is morally right, you will find loyal friends
from truly unexpected sources who will admire
you for standing up for your convictions.
I myself remember the wonderful stall that
stood behind ine when I was forced to resorl
lo drastic measures lo fight for the principles
which I held so dear. And it was a staff all of
whom at one time or another forwent willing
that paper or studying for that midterm just so
the paper would gel out another day.
I here will he times when you will be madder
than hell and you never had heard of The
Stanford Daily. Hut when you look back after
you come to the end ol your editorship, you
will realize how precious lo you was thai bat
tered old shack with the red door.
It's all yours, Wally, you lucky guy.
