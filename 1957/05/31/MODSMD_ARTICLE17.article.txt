# To the Graduates
## 
### 
On June 16, 1270 of you will flock into Frost
Amphitheater to receive your degrees. Some
of you will go on to graduate work, bill I he
majority will go out into the world full of the
knowledge and experience thai you have gath
ered from four years at Stanford University.
V on will go out into a world that is desperate
for leaders, one in which conformity and lack
of individuality are prevalent everywhere.
You will have a chance lo show that your
reputation is wrong, for your generation has
been labeled "the silent generation." You have
been accused of doing nothing, of being ccm
pletely conservative and of going along with
ilie mob on every occasion.
It is iip lo you who graduate from Stanford
and similar higher institutions to dispel this
label and produce the kind of dynamic leader
ship that this country and this world need.
The Stanford atmosphere has provided the
necessary knowledge for free thought, but cer
lainly has not perpetrated the right atmos
phere.
Most graduation speakers print a bleak,
black picture of the world for the graduating
seniors. It would be nice to paint an optimistic,
rosy picture, for a change, but the present hap
hazard state that the world exists in just doesn't
warrant it.
A disarmament conference is now meeting
in London lo discuss the possibility i>f slowing
down an armaments race already causing in
estimable damage through just the testing of
weapons. Soviet Communism is still on the
march; a brave Hungarian people is still suf

lering from efforts lo ihrow off the Communist
yoke.
I lie United Slates lias an important chal
lenge before it. (Midland and I'ranee, former
vital Western allies, have sunk lo almost insig
nificant allies. Americans alone must provide
tlie proper leadership against the threat of the
Soviet Union.
Hut, l«i look al lliis country one really won
ders how our position of leadership can con
tinue when we can't even govern our own af
fairs. Schools and civil rights are being ignored,
while (Congress busily cuts foreign aid and
vitally needed I'osl Office appropriations. The
Administration has been disappointing in ils
efforts to wield our government together.
But most of I his difficulty evolves from the
spirit of the people of the United States, who
quite bluntly don't give a damn.
Any American citizen, so long as he gets a
comfortable job, a new car and a paid vacation,
is content to live in the same old rut, not caring
what is happening to his neighbors.
ou hear the argument: "Let's develop ma
terial prosperity, and then intellectual and
leadership prosperity will follow." This is not
true. 11 everyone heads for Ihe good old ma
terialistic rut, nothing but disaster and chaos
will happen.
If you }io through life afraid of asserting
yourself for fear it might lose you a plush job,
or that you won't be conforming with good old
insipid society, then all ihe money you spent
at Stanford has gone for nothing.
