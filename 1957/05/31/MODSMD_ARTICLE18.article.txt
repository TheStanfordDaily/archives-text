An Invitation
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Stanford Affiliation Commit
tee at the Free University in Berlin I would like
to invite all Stanford students who will be trav
eling in Europe this summer or intend to study
there to rome to Berlin for a few days. The
members of the committee there, most of them
Stanford alumni, will be glad to be of every help
to make a stay in Berlin a highlight of the trip.
During the recent years wc have tried to provide
for en experience off the beaten tourist track
by showing frequent visitors from Stanford
around in both West and East Berlin, thus giving
them a vivid insight into the clash between East
and West. Prospective visitors are advised to
write to Barbel Meier (last year's exchange stu
dent lrom the Free University,), 74 Handyerstr,
Berlin—Friedenau, Germany, and to inform her
about their date of arrival, length of stay and
wishes concerning accommodation.
For more information contact Dieter Merbitz,
D.K.E., DA 3-8725, or Wolfgang Schulz, Chi Psi,
DA 3-8718.

Serious Action
Editor, The Daily:
The Legislature has taken very serious action
in censuring Ihe master of ceremonies of the
1957 Spring Sing. We cannot recall any previous
action taken by the Stanford Legislature of a
similar nature. Not only is the censure presently
embarrassing to the master of ceremonies, but
it places a mar k on his record which could harm
him in the future.
If the Legislature in the past had made it a
clear-cut policy to censure Stanford activities
when they are in bad taste, or if this particular
action had been so clearly objectionable as to
warrant special action, the censure could be jus
tified. However, not only have rallies, Gaieties
and ( haparrals, etc., been in much worse taste
and been presented to the public, but—as fat
back as we can recall they have gone without
comment lrom Legislature. Mr. Crookston's per
formance was not particularly humorous, but it
certainly was not reprehensible on the basis of
any standards previously held by the Legisla
ture —or the University.

Serious Action
Editor, The Daily:
The Legislature has taken very serious action
in censuring Ihe master of ceremonies of the
1957 Spring Sing. We cannot recall any previous
action taken by the Stanford Legislature of a
similar nature. Not only is the censure presently
embarrassing to the master of ceremonies, but
it places a mar k on his record which could harm
him in the future.
If the Legislature in the past had made it a
clear-cut policy to censure Stanford activities
when they are in bad taste, or if this particular
action had been so clearly objectionable as to
warrant special action, the censure could be jus
tified. However, not only have rallies, Gaieties
and ( haparrals, etc., been in much worse taste
and been presented to the public, but—as fat
back as we can recall they have gone without
comment lrom Legislature. Mr. Crookston's per
formance was not particularly humorous, but it
certainly was not reprehensible on the basis of
any standards previously held by the Legisla
ture —or the University.

An Invitation
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Stanford Affiliation Commit
tee at the Free University in Berlin I would like
to invite all Stanford students who will be trav
eling in Europe this summer or intend to study
there to rome to Berlin for a few days. The
members of the committee there, most of them
Stanford alumni, will be glad to be of every help
to make a stay in Berlin a highlight of the trip.
During the recent years wc have tried to provide
for en experience off the beaten tourist track
by showing frequent visitors from Stanford
around in both West and East Berlin, thus giving
them a vivid insight into the clash between East
and West. Prospective visitors are advised to
write to Barbel Meier (last year's exchange stu
dent lrom the Free University,), 74 Handyerstr,
Berlin—Friedenau, Germany, and to inform her
about their date of arrival, length of stay and
wishes concerning accommodation.
