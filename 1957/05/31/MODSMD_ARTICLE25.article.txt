# Daily Names Wiggin Top Card Athlete
## 
### Dick Barnes 
A two-year football All-Ameri
can and front-line performer in
rugby has been chosen as Stan
ford's Athlete of the Year by the
sports staff of The Daily.
Paul David Wiggin was select
ed for Ihe honor by the scribes
on a basis of his tremendous play
at tackle for Chuck Taylor's grid
iron squad last fall, coupled with
his equally-outstanding work at
2nd rank for Pete Kmetovic's
ruggers.
Frank Herrmann, standout
performer on the Indian track
team, was runner-up in the vot
ing. Footballer John Brodie was
third; with Carl Isaacs, a first
stringer in football and basket
ball, fourth.
Standout in Line
During the 1956 grid season,
Wiggin stood out as the one real
ly solid member of the Tribe line.
Injuries hit Taylor's squad at al
most every line spot sometime
during Ihe year, but Wiggin
; hung in all the way.
Taylor and line coach Joe
i Ruetz were called upon to con
stantly shift available talent to
try and keep the line in the best
possible shape from game to
game. As a result. Wiggin was
sometimes called upon to take
care of two or three opponents,
or even the entire side of the
foe's line.
Ruetz called Wiggin "definite
ly the best tackle we've had here
at Stanford in the last five
years." Grid experts apparently
I agreed that Wiggin was a stand
out, since he was named to the
| AP All-American team in 1955,
and then gained mention on sev
| eral dream squads last season.
East-West Star
Wiggin's excellent abilities
were shown to full advantage in
the East - West Shrine football
game. He was one of few men
who performed on both offense
and defense, yet he played his
| usual air-tight game against an

East squad that boasted somo of I
the nation's finest linemen.
Not only was Wiggin ;i physi
cal t i/?er on the field, but he was
also one of Uie leaders of the
team. Attesting 'to this was his
election as co-captain of the '56
eleven. He was also picked as
the team's Most Valuable Player.
During the spring rugby sea
son, Wiggin also spearheaded the ;
line. But in rugby, he also man
aged to get in on the scoring, j
dropping on an in-goal kick for |
three points in Stanford's 26-0 i
rout of the Olympic Club,
Undefeated Broad Juniper
Herrmann, the number two
man in the voting, is certain to |
go into Stanford sports annals
as one of the very best of the
University's trackmen.
Herrmann has won the broad
jump in every meet he has en
tered so far this seasonâ€”11 vic
tories in all. Included in his
string have been wins at such
highly-rated spikefests as the I
West Coast Relays, Coliseum Re
lays, Modesto Relays and Pacific
Coast Conference championships.
Herrmann, however, lias not yet
completed his season's jumping.
He'll try to finish the year with
16 straight wins as he goes in
the Compton Invitational, NCAA
championships and three differ
ent AAU meets.
Triple Against USC
His greatest day, and one of
the greatest in Stanford history,
came against USC. In that meet,
Herrmann won the broad jump,
the 100 and 1he 220 to become the
first Indian to ever score a triple
victory against the perennially
powerful Trojans.
After naming Wiggin as the
Athlete of the Year, The Daily
considered other men for the
Player of the Year in each sport.
Those selected were:
Football, John Brodie; basket
ball, Bill Bond; track, Frank
Herrmann; baseball, Rudy Figue
roa; tennis, Jackie Douglas;
swimming, Lowell Johnson; rug
by, Jack Taylor; golf, Bill Sea
nor; cross-country, Ralph Love;

t 1
wrestling, Pete Likens; boxing, j
Bill Sampson; soccer, Peter j
Mack; fencing, Bob Simon; gym-j
nasties, Doug Cox.
The USC .football game was j
chosen as the top Stanford sports
event of the year. The Indians, !
trailing 13-0 at one time, came
back on Brodie's passing to win
27-19.
Runner-up for event of the!
year was the second California I
basketball game which Stanford
lost in overtime, 67-64, after lead
ing until the last few seconds.
