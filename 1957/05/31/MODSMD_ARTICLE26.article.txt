## 
### 
Swimming coach Tom Haynie, who led his
varsity mermen to their 27th straight PCC
dual meel victory and their eighth consecutive
PCC crown, was selected as the top Card men
tor by The Daily sports staff.
Peninsula youth in swimming.
Trailing California going into the third and
final day of competition at the PCC's in Los
Angeles, Haynie's conservative dope-sheet in
dicated a Cal victory.
In a Rockne-type locker-room talk he re
assured the Indians that they were the champs
(for the previous seven years) and that the
pressure was on Cal to come and get them.
The response was inspirational. The Indians
took their only three firsts that third day (two
were upset wins through all-time best per
formances) and followed up with come
througns all along the line to sweep the meet.
A good part of the success of his plea can
be laid to the strong athlete-coach relationship
he maintains with the team. Haynie and his

family (wife, Sherry, and three daughters and
a son) frequently entertain members of Ihe
team in their campus home.
Few coaches put in a longer work day than
Tom. Beginning when Eneina pool opens at
10 each morning, four days a week he is at
ihe pool until late in the evening instructing
Haynie, at 41 an energetic positive thinker,
is optimistic about next season. Although he
will not put himself out on the limb concern
ing the NCAA, he sees a much stronger PCC
squad for next year.
Although Murray is alternately rumored to
be choosing between Stanford and Australia,
the fact remains that Ihe availability of an
Olympic 50-meter pool will be a determinant
in the final decision.
Haynie explains that the emphasis on the
long pool (NCAA pools are 25 yards) is two
fold, "The long course, only, is used in inter
national swimming like the Olympics and the
only marks which will be accepted for world
record consideration are Ihose set in pools
50 meters or more in length."
