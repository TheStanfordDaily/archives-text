SAN FRANCISCO, May 30 (UP)â€”Pacific Coast League President
Leslie O'Connor, saying his loop will be destroyed if the New York
Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers move to California, today called an
emergency meeting to discuss indemnities for the eight PCL teams.
"In my opinion a taking of Los Angeles and San Francisco tcrri-

Tory from the PCL inevitably
will destroy the league," O'Con
nor said. "In view of that, and of
the immense contributions the
PCL has made to the develop
ment of major league ball, it is
If) be hoped that any major
league involved will be fair and
generous as it can well afford to
be on the basis of the extrava
gant liberality of the proposed
appropriations of public funds re
putedly proffered to induce Ihe
taking of PCL territory."
O'Connor called the meeting
for June 2 at Sacramento and said
"all possibilities" arising out of
major league expansion would be
explored.
"It likewise is to be hoped that
PCL clubs will he fair and rea
sonable in presenting their views
as to what the just compensation
ought to be," he said.
Four clubs lo date have placed
their total indemnity at $6,700,-
000.
O'Connor refused to, say wheth
er he thought the much-publi
cized shift of the Giants to San
Francisco and the Dodgers to
Los Angeles actually will come
about. But he was bitter in de
nouncing Ihe way the situation
has jelled.
