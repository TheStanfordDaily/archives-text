# All Students May Obtain Refunds Through Rebates
## 
### 
What is a rebate? This has
puzzled many students attending
Stanford's summer quarter. A re
bale is the receipt you receive
after making a purchase at the
Stanford Bookstore.
Rebates are also given at the
bookstore for such miscellaneous
services as repairing typewriters
and pens. "A rebate is worth
money to you," says Mrs. H. Bau
chau, bookstore manager.
Since the bookstore is a non
profit, co-operative organization,
it shares its profits with the stu
dent. The amount of rebate money
received by the student depends
upon the business the bookstore
has received, and upon how many
students turn in their rebates. In
June of each year, the bookstore
pays back each student a certain
percentage of his rebates.
You may receive a rebate en
velope in the bookstore office. The
instructions concerning rebates
are on this envelope. Rebates
must he enclosed in this envelope
and presented to the bookstore be
fore May 1, 1958. If you do not ex
pect to return to Stanford after
the summer quarter, you have
two choices.
You may turn in your rebates
before you leave, or you may mail
them in any time before thee
fore-mentioned deadline. In either
case, enclose a self-addressed en
velope so that your rebate cin be
mailed to you.
