# Torn Up Roads and Walks Will Make Way for Med Center Heating System
## 
### 
Torn up streets and pedestrian
ways will mark the path of prog
ress at Stanford this summer, as
work begins on a new $1,400,000
steam heating system.
The system is planned primarily
to supply heat to the future Stan
ford Medical Center and Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital, but will also
improve existing campus heating
service.
Street excavation began last
week for more than a mile of un
derground steam pipes, worth half
a million dollars, which will con
vey steam from a $900,000 boiler
plant being built on Serra Street
west of Physics Corner.
Buried pipe will run from the
boiler plant south toward Roble

Hall, cutting across the Health
Scrvice parking lot. The line will
turn east to follow Santa Teresa
Street toward the post office, tap
ping an existing steam line near
the Women's Clubhouse.
Excavation along the pedestrian
way between Engineering Corner
and History Corner will connect
two existing lines and complete a
rectangular "loop" around the
combined Quad, Corporation Yard,
and Union Court areas.
The steam plant, which when
completed will deliver 160,000
pounds of steam pressure an hour,
is being built by Wells P. Good
enough of Palo Alto. Pipe con
tractor is J. B. Nettles Co., San
Francisco.
