# Summer Weekly Policy
## 
### 
The purpose of the Stanford Summer Weekly is to act as a pub
licity sheet for the activities of the summer quarter. It is published
by the ASSU. It is not intended to be a molder of public opinion
and therefore con'tains 110 advertising or editorials.
News will pertain entirely to campus matters, because with a
paper of this size and weekly distribution any world or national
news would be old by the time the paper is circulated.
Anyone interested in working on this publication should apply
for a position a'i the Daily Shack. Oi>enings include, photographer,
circulation manager, sports editor, and reporters.
