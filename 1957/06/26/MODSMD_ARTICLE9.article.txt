Bowman Alumni House will be the site of the All-Campus Recep
tion this afternoon. The event will begin at 4 p.m. and end around
5:30 p.m.
All members of the summer faculty, student body, and their guests
are invited.
Due to the heat, the event will be informal. Everyone is encouraged
to wear quad clothes.

The reception line greeting new
comers will consist of Dean Wil
liam C. Steere, Dean Philip H.
Rhinelander, Dean Ray N. Faulk
ner, Dean Isaac J. Quillen, Dean
H. Donald Winbigler, Dr. Edward

Mr. Paul E. Holden, and Mr. Wal
ter C. Peterson and their wives.
All visiting faculty members
will be given tags which will des
ignate their names and home
schools.
Sixteen freshmen women and
several other undergraduate
women will act as hostesses by
mixing punch and serving cookies.
Mrs. Robert M. Minto, Mrs. Rich
ard T. LaPiere, and Miss Georgia
Ray Williams and others will pour
punch in the patio in back of Bow
man.
The doors will be left wide open
so that people can mill about as
they please. The punch will be
served under the trees at two
ends of a large table and from a
nearby small table. In the middle
of the large table will be a floral
arrangement. There will also be
two smaller floral arrangements
inside.
Carol Sowers is the chairman of
the event, which is sponsored by
the summer quarter legislature.
Carol says that this event is a
great opportunity for students and
faculty to get together just as
classes are getting underway. She
also says that this is a good chance
for old Stanfordites to get reac
quainted and for new ones to
make new acquaintances.
