# Tuition To Be Increased One-Third Autumn of '58
## 
### 
A one-third increase in the high cost of learning is scheduled for a
year from September for Stanford students.
The boost from $250 to $335 per quarter, or from $750 to $1,005 per
academic year of three quarters, was announced last week by Pro
vost Frederick E. Terman. The change will not go into effect until
September, 1958.

Tuition in the School of Medi
cine was increased to $335 per
quarter and Business School tui
tion went up to $300 a year ago.
The University will consider fur
there increases in these rates at a
later date.
In pushing its annual tuition
charge above $1,000, Stanford will
join such institutions as Brown,
Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, and
Yale. Tuition at these four will
top $1,000 during the 1957-58
school year. Elsewhere in Cali
fornia, Cal Tech will charge $900
and USC $830 for the 1957-58
school year.
Proceeds from the tuition in
crease at Stanford will go to raise
faculty salaries, to improve the
quality of undergraduate educa
tion, to augment undergraduate
and graduate student aid pro
grams, and to pay for renovations
in the academic plant and for
books and supplies.
Provost Terman indicated that
it was the University's intention
that no student be forced to leave
Stanford because of the increase
in tuition. "We will stand ready to
assist anyone in need by increased
scholarships, loans, or part-time
work opportunities," Provost Ter
man said.
Still Less Than Half
University sources pointed out
that tuition will still pay less than
half the average cost of educating
a Stanford student. The rest is
paid largely from endowment in
come or gifts.
Even at the new higher levels,
college and university tuitions are
a tremendous bargain, Provost
Terman said. "The student pays
less than half the cost of his edu
cation and at the same time in
creases his earning potential far
beyond the tuition charge."
Salary Improvement
Uppermost in University think
ing, Provost Terman indicated, is
the pressing need for improve
ment in faculty salaries. Ford
Foundation grants have swelled
salary budgets since 1956, and fur
ther improvement will be made
possible by the tuition increase.
Provost Terman declared that
Stanford has held the line against
a tuition increase longer than any
other major private college or uni
versity. Last Stanford tuition in
crease, from $220 to $250 per quar
ter, took place in 1954.

join such institutions as Brown,
Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, and
Yale. Tuition at these four will
top $1,000 during the 1957-58
school year. Elsewhere in Cali
fornia, Cal Tech will charge $900
and USC $830 for the 1957-58
school year.
Proceeds from the tuition in
crease at Stanford will go to raise
faculty salaries, to improve the
quality of undergraduate educa
tion, to augment undergraduate
and graduate student aid pro
grams, and to pay for renovations
in the academic plant and for
books and supplies.
Provost Terman indicated that
it was the University's intention
that no student be forced to leave
Stanford because of the increase
in tuition. "We will stand ready to
assist anyone in need by increased
scholarships, loans, or part-time
work opportunities," Provost Ter
man said.
Still Less Than Half
University sources pointed out
that tuition will still pay less than
half the average cost of educating
a Stanford student. The rest is
paid largely from endowment in
come or gifts.
Even at the new higher levels,
college and university tuitions are
a tremendous bargain, Provost
Terman said. "The student pays
less than half the cost of his edu
cation and at the same time in
creases his earning potential far
beyond the tuition charge."
Salary Improvement
Uppermost in University think
ing, Provost Terman indicated, is
the pressing need for improve
ment in faculty salaries. Ford
Foundation grants have swelled
salary budgets since 1956, and fur
ther improvement will be made
possible by the tuition increase.
Provost Terman declared that
Stanford has held the line against
a tuition increase longer than any
other major private college or uni
versity. Last Stanford tuition in
crease, from $220 to $250 per quar
ter, took place in 1954.
A one-third increase in the high cost of learning is scheduled for a
year from September for Stanford students.
The boost from $250 to $335 per quarter, or from $750 to $1,005 per
academic year of three quarters, was announced last week by Pro
vost Frederick E. Terman. The change will not go into effect until
September, 1958.

Tuition in the School of Medi
cine was increased to $335 per
quarter and Business School tui
tion went up to $300 a year ago.
The University will consider fur
there increases in these rates at a
later date.
In pushing its annual tuition
charge above $1,000, Stanford will
join such institutions as Brown,
Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, and
Yale. Tuition at these four will
top $1,000 during the 1957-58
school year. Elsewhere in Cali
