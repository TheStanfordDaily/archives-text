# Main Libe To Be Closed Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Main Library will close to
morrow, July 4th, according to Ad
ministrative Assistant Fred J.
Priddle. The doors will close at
5 p.m. today, instead of the usual
late hour of 9 p.m. They will open
again Friday morning at 8 o'clock.
Regular summer hours sched
uled for the library were also an
nounced by Mr. Priddle. They will
be:
Monday through Thursday: 8
a.m. to 9 p.m.
Friday: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Saturday: 8 a.m. to noon.
Sunday: 1 a.m. to 5 p.m.
A number of library books are
in disuse each quarter because
they are left lying around in resi
dences. The library staff has dis
covered that it can recover quite
a few overdue books at the end of
each school year by going through
the dormitories while they are be
ing cleaned. About 100 books, in
fact, were found in this fashion
during the past spring.
Library personnel would appre
ciate it if students could promptly
return books they find lying about
unclaimed, so that they can be
sigped out by other students dur
ing the summer.
