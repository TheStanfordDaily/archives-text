Volleyball sign-ups have been
extended through today, Dick
Offutt, volleyball chairman an

meeting.
"The rules have also been
changed." said Dick. "Boys and
girls may sign up separately for
the mixed volleyball teams and the
teams will be arranged." They
still may sign up as teams though,
he added.
There will be a meeting of
everyone representing or being a
captain of a team Monday, July 8
at 7 p.m. at the ASSU office. Fail
ure for a team to have a represen
