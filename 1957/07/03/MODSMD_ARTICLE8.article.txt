# ASSU All-Campus Watermelon Feed To Be Held Saturday Afternoon; Free
## 
### 
Rinds will fall and seeds will fly at the annual All-Campus Water
melon Feed to be held Saturday, July 6, from 2 through 5 p.m. The
big feed itself will terminate in the center of the women's gym field
opposite Lagunita, featuring tons of free watermelon which will be
ice cold for the expected hot summer weather.
"All attending are urged to bring an abundant supply of energy,

a huge appetite, and a bathing
suit," says Mudge Knowles, co
chairman and ASSU vice-presi
dent.
"Aside from stuffing water
melon, students will swim, play
volleyball, generally having a
heck of a good time," co-chairman
Dick Offutt said.
No matter how you slice it,
watermelon remains champion of
summertime delicacies, according
to National Geographic. As a mat
ter of fact, last year Americans
devoured three billion pounds of
melons. Of course some of these
many pounds were consumed by
people other than the ones at the
"Big Feed" here at Stanford. How
ever, this year the intake of the
large juicy fruit will increase if
the trend started earlier this year
continues.
The watermelon is nothing but
a giant member of the cucumber
clan which grew in the Nile Val
ley thousands of years ago, but
actually it is not as watery ar<
some of the other vegetables, such
as tomatoes, cucumbers, squash,
and lettuce.
No matter what the watermelon
really is, the hundreds of Stanford
students will not give it a second
thought on the day of the "Feed"
as they dive head-first into the
fresh, crisp, frosty-red, cool fruit.

mere shadow of the tilings to come, was fur
nished by Harlan Limmer, President of the
Trancos upperclassmen. Dick Offutt, water-

melon feed chairman, said the ASSU has gone
well out of its way to find 800 pounds of the
juiciest, freshest, coldest watermelons avail
able. However, he added that unfortunately,
they were not able to find 'those of the seed
less variety.
