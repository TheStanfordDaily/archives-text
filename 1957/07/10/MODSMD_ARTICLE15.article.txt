# Ed School Holds Textbook Exhibit
## 
### 
The annual textbook exhibit will
be held in the first floor halls of
the Education Building today.
Thirty-one publishers will partici
pate in this event. This should be
of particular interest to the teach
ers attending Stanford's summer
quarter, says Mrs. Louise Bou
dreau, Assistant to the Dean of
the School of Education.
A similar book display was held
on July S-9 in the Library. How
ever, it consisted entirely of paper
bound books. The purpose of the
display was to acquaint the public
with much of the important litera
ture that may now be purchased
in paperbound form.
This constitutes a great saving
for the student. "Textbooks and
books dealing with science are
now being published in paper
bound form. This will be a great
boon to students and faculty
alike," says Robert D. Pepper,
English professor.
