# MARAIS AND MIRANDA
## Balladeers Perform Here Monday 
### ANN LOWELL 
Josef Marais and Miranda, in
ternational "balladeers" famous
for their concerts, recordings,
radio and television programs, will
appear at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Monday, July 15.
Tickets for the 8:30 p.m. per
formance are available at the
Dinkelspiel Box Office and Pen
insula Box Office for $2.00.
As composers and singers Ma
rais and Miranda have collected
humorous and tender songs from
many countries. Most of their
songs are presented in English,
with an added verse in the origi
nal language for authentic flavor
and style. Marais sings in an easy,
relaxed baritone and Miranda in a
light soprano as Marais plays ac
companiments on the classic gui
tar.
Both artists have a flair for
imaginative treatment of lyrics
and music, and for informal en
tertaining. They are completely
unlike the conventional concert
singer who introduces a few folk
songs in a recital of arias, and
other art songs.
They are equally unlike the
"folk singer" who strives to cre
ate the impression that he is just
singing for a few friends or his
own enjoyment on the back porch,
or in front of a campfire. Like the
troubadours and trouveres, Ma
rais and Miranda have a freely
creative and imaginative approach
to their art. They use folk songs
and ballads gleaned from South

Africa to the Appalachian High
lands of America, but they fash
ion them into beautiful little
works of art.
Marais strums and drums his
classic guitar with accompani
ments of his own devising. Mi
randa improvises her own parts
until some version is discovered
which pleases them, and is writ
ten down for permanent form.
She is a master of understate
ment, who produces the most con
vincing illusion with the simplest
possible means. With a slight
movement of a shoulder or an eye
brow she conveys a character
ization, which can be charming or
devastating as the case may re
quire.
Marais, born in South Africa,
was a violinist and composer, giv
ing recitals in England, when he
began a series of song and adven
ture programs for the BBC. In
these, he featured South African
folk songs which he had known
since boyhood days. These were
so popular that he came to the
United States in 1939 to present a
similar series for NBC.
Miranda, born in Amsterdam,
began her career as a pianist and
accompanist. While studying voice
in New York, she bccamc an ar
dent admirer of Marais' broadcast
programs. The two first became
acquainted, however, while work
ing together for the Voice of
America.
After tiie war they formed a

| team, and since their marriage in
11947 have toured widely in the
United States and Europe. They
have appeared together on NBC
and CBS networks, have published
many popular songs and a folk
opera, "Tony Beaver."

MARIAS AMI MIRANDA
Josef Marais and Miranda, in
ternational "balladeers" famous
for their concerts, recordings,
radio and television programs, will
appear at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Monday, July 15.
Tickets for the 8:30 p.m. per
formance are available at the
Dinkelspiel Box Office and Pen
insula Box Office for $2.00.
As composers and singers Ma
rais and Miranda have collected
humorous and tender songs from
many countries. Most of their
songs are presented in English,
with an added verse in the origi
nal language for authentic flavor
and style. Marais sings in an easy,
relaxed baritone and Miranda in a
light soprano as Marais plays ac
companiments on the classic gui
tar.
Both artists have a flair for
imaginative treatment of lyrics
and music, and for informal en
tertaining. They are completely
unlike the conventional concert
singer who introduces a few folk
songs in a recital of arias, and
other art songs.
They are equally unlike the
"folk singer" who strives to cre
ate the impression that he is just
singing for a few friends or his
own enjoyment on the back porch,
or in front of a campfire. Like the
troubadours and trouveres, Ma
rais and Miranda have a freely
creative and imaginative approach
to their art. They use folk songs
and ballads gleaned from South

Africa to the Appalachian High
lands of America, but they fash
ion them into beautiful little
works of art.
Marais strums and drums his
classic guitar with accompani
ments of his own devising. Mi
randa improvises her own parts
until some version is discovered
which pleases them, and is writ
ten down for permanent form.
She is a master of understate
ment, who produces the most con
vincing illusion with the simplest
possible means. With a slight
movement of a shoulder or an eye
brow she conveys a character
ization, which can be charming or
devastating as the case may re
quire.
Marais, born in South Africa,
was a violinist and composer, giv
ing recitals in England, when he
began a series of song and adven
ture programs for the BBC. In
these, he featured South African
folk songs which he had known
since boyhood days. These were
so popular that he came to the
United States in 1939 to present a
similar series for NBC.
