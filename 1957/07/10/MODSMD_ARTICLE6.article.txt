The deadline for news for
"Once Over Lightly" is Satur
day afternoon. Items may be
left alt the Daily Shack.

Mid-term tension will be broken a week from Saturday as the men
of Wilbur Hall present the first of two major all-campus dances. A
Hawaiian atmosphere will rule over the July 20 activities from 8 p.m.
to midnight, as Stanford couples garbed in Hawaiian dress or sport
clothes sway to the music of Chuck Travis and his six-piece band.
Tickets, 50 cents per couple, are on sale at the ASSU office above

the Cellar, or may be obtained
from all social chairmen, and at
the door the night of the dance.
It is stressed that one of the couple
be connected in some way with the
University.
The courtyard and lounges of
the large dormitory will be in
keeping with the Hawaiian theme.
Flowers, fish netting, and many
other authentic touches will pro
vide the setting for what ASSU
President Skip Skipworth declares
"an enjoyable evening."
John Cailleau, chairman of the
dance, expressed hope that the
turnout will be as large as that of
the highly successful watermelon
feast last Saturday. Although the
famous Stanford ratio is more
favorable than usual in the eyes
of the men during Summer Quar
ter, Cailleau suggested that no
time be wasted in finding a part
ner.
Peninsula merchants have gone
out of their way to help assure
success for the dance through do
nations of display material and
other decorations. Reynolds Nurs
ery in Menlo Park is furnishing
dozens of lush, tropical plants for
the courtyard. The Hawaiian Shop
in Town and Country Village has
supplied props and decorations for
dance publicity.
Yesterday afternoon Cailleau
stated: "I'm sure the dance will
really be the highlight of the quar
ter. We've had a lot of help with
everything, although we could use
some more Hawaiian torches and
a pick-up truck or similar convey
ance for transportation of decora
tions."
Anyone interested in lending a
hand on dance arrangements is
urged to get in touch with Lagu
nita social chairman Sally Ball, or
any of the Wilbur social chairmen,
including Cailleau.

Flowers, fish netting, and many
other authentic touches will pro
vide the setting for what ASSU
President Skip Skipworth declares
"an enjoyable evening."
John Cailleau, chairman of the
dance, expressed hope that the
turnout will be as large as that of
the highly successful watermelon
feast last Saturday. Although the
famous Stanford ratio is more
favorable than usual in the eyes
of the men during Summer Quar
ter, Cailleau suggested that no
time be wasted in finding a part
ner.
Peninsula merchants have gone
out of their way to help assure
success for the dance through do
nations of display material and
other decorations. Reynolds Nurs
ery in Menlo Park is furnishing
dozens of lush, tropical plants for
the courtyard. The Hawaiian Shop
in Town and Country Village has
supplied props and decorations for
dance publicity.
Yesterday afternoon Cailleau
stated: "I'm sure the dance will
really be the highlight of the quar
ter. We've had a lot of help with
everything, although we could use
some more Hawaiian torches and
a pick-up truck or similar convey
ance for transportation of decora
tions."
Anyone interested in lending a
hand on dance arrangements is
urged to get in touch with Lagu
nita social chairman Sally Ball, or
any of the Wilbur social chairmen,
including Cailleau.
The second major dance will be
the Lagunita Semi-Formal, Au
gust 3.


HAWAIIAN THEME of the Wilbur Dance is depicted by Alice
Katsky, as she models authentic Island dress from the Hawaiian
Shop, Town and Country Villase.
The deadline for news for
"Once Over Lightly" is Satur
day afternoon. Items may be
left alt the Daily Shack.

Mid-term tension will be broken a week from Saturday as the men
of Wilbur Hall present the first of two major all-campus dances. A
Hawaiian atmosphere will rule over the July 20 activities from 8 p.m.
to midnight, as Stanford couples garbed in Hawaiian dress or sport
clothes sway to the music of Chuck Travis and his six-piece band.
Tickets, 50 cents per couple, are on sale at the ASSU office above

the Cellar, or may be obtained
from all social chairmen, and at
the door the night of the dance.
It is stressed that one of the couple
be connected in some way with the
University.
The courtyard and lounges of
the large dormitory will be in
keeping with the Hawaiian theme.
