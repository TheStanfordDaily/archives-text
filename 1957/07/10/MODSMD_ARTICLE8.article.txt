# TRAIN TO MUMMIES
## Knicknack Collection Grows, Becomes Stanford Museum 
### EGMONDE SOUSE 
From small stones and shells
to a small steam locomotive, from
the mummy of an Egyptian girl
of 2500 years ago to costumed,
figurines of more recent histori
cal personalities, the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum offers glimp
ses of Stanfordania and curios
from all over the world every
afternoon.
Originally built to house a wide
ly assorted collection of knick
nacks begun as a hobby by Le
land Stanford, Jr., when he was
eleven years old, the Stanford Mu
suem today displays mementos of
the Stanford family itself as well
as a broad selection of examples
of the handicrafts of many cul
tures.
The museum, located north of
the chemistry building near Phys
ics Corner, is open daily from 1 to
5 p.m., and admission is free to
students, faculty, and University
personnel. A twenty-five cent
charge is made to the general
public.
Brought from Egypt
Mrs. Jane Stanford, wife of the
University's founder, undertook
the planning and construction of
the museum as a further me
mento of her dead son. The mu
seum was completed and occupied
in 1892. Mrs. Stanford added to
her son's collection in the years
that followed. The museum's
Egyptian collection was pur
chased by Mrs. Stanford during
her travels in Egypt.
The 1906 earthquake shattered
both wings of the museum and
closed its doors until 1909. Lack
ing funds for renovation, the mu
seum staff kept the museum open
with difficulty until the end of the
second world war, when the pub
lic was again excluded.
Opened Again in '54
Through the efforts of Dr. Hazel
D. Hansen of the Classics Depart
ment and an allocation of $28,000
by the University, many exhibits
damaged in the earthquake have
been repaired, the display equip
ment has been modernized, and
the museum opened to the public
once more in April, 1954.
Current feature of the mu
seum's display is a collection of
historical figurines posed and
costumed by George Stuart, set
up in the foyer. The museum has
set aside a room for the first loco
motive used by Senator Stanford's
Central Pacific Railway, and also
displays the golden spike driven
by Senator Stanford at Promen
tory Point, Utah, to complete the
first transcontinental railroad.
Original Collection
The original collection of Le
land Stanford, Jr., is displayed in
a separate room, adjoining a dis
play of family portraits, papers,
and clothing.
A statue of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford and their son which orig
inally stood in Memorial Quad
rangle is now housed in the mu
seum.
Archeological and historical me
mentoes of California and of the
Palo Alto area are displayed on
the second floor of the museum.
The works of evolutionary cul
tures on all the continents are ar
ranged in a second-floor exhibit
hall.
The museum shares its build
ing with the Stanford Natural His
tory Museum, which houses re
search collections in zoology and
related sciences.

Brought from Egypt
Mrs. Jane Stanford, wife of the
University's founder, undertook
the planning and construction of
the museum as a further me
mento of her dead son. The mu
seum was completed and occupied
in 1892. Mrs. Stanford added to
her son's collection in the years
that followed. The museum's
Egyptian collection was pur
chased by Mrs. Stanford during
her travels in Egypt.
The 1906 earthquake shattered
both wings of the museum and
closed its doors until 1909. Lack
ing funds for renovation, the mu
seum staff kept the museum open
with difficulty until the end of the
second world war, when the pub
lic was again excluded.
Opened Again in '54
Through the efforts of Dr. Hazel
D. Hansen of the Classics Depart
ment and an allocation of $28,000
by the University, many exhibits
damaged in the earthquake have
been repaired, the display equip
ment has been modernized, and
the museum opened to the public
once more in April, 1954.
Current feature of the mu
seum's display is a collection of
historical figurines posed and
costumed by George Stuart, set
up in the foyer. The museum has
set aside a room for the first loco
motive used by Senator Stanford's
Central Pacific Railway, and also
displays the golden spike driven
by Senator Stanford at Promen
tory Point, Utah, to complete the
first transcontinental railroad.
Original Collection
The original collection of Le
land Stanford, Jr., is displayed in
a separate room, adjoining a dis
play of family portraits, papers,
and clothing.
A statue of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford and their son which orig
inally stood in Memorial Quad
rangle is now housed in the mu
seum.
Archeological and historical me
mentoes of California and of the
Palo Alto area are displayed on
the second floor of the museum.
The works of evolutionary cul
tures on all the continents are ar
ranged in a second-floor exhibit
hall.
The museum shares its build
ing with the Stanford Natural His
tory Museum, which houses re
search collections in zoology and
related sciences.
From small stones and shells
to a small steam locomotive, from
the mummy of an Egyptian girl
of 2500 years ago to costumed,
figurines of more recent histori
cal personalities, the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum offers glimp
ses of Stanfordania and curios
from all over the world every
afternoon.
Originally built to house a wide
ly assorted collection of knick
nacks begun as a hobby by Le
land Stanford, Jr., when he was
eleven years old, the Stanford Mu
suem today displays mementos of
the Stanford family itself as well
as a broad selection of examples
of the handicrafts of many cul
tures.
