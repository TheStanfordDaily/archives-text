## 
### 
Installation of a $28,000 social sciences study room in the Stanford
University Library this summer will mark the largest step toward
modernization the Library has taken since it was built in 1919.
To be called the Shainwald Room to honor the memory of the late
Richard Shainwald of San Francisco, the social sciences facility will

gift was given in memory of Mr.
Shainwald, her father, a long

summer will add offices for refer
ence and inter-library loan staffs
and a room for microfi'm readers.
