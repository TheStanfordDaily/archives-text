# For ASSU Golf Tourney Sign-ups Close Friday
## 
### 
Friday has been designated as the last day for signing up for the
ASSU summer, nine hole golt tournament that will be held Monday,
July 22, at 1 p.m.
The winner of the one-day, handicapped tourney will receive a
trophy donated by "Old Pard" of Pard's Bar-B-Q. The winner will
be the contestant with the lowest net score. Other prizes will be

awarded for the lowest gross score
and the lowest number of puts. A
boobie prize and other special
awards will also be given. How
ever, only one prize may be won by
any given player.
Sign-up sheets have been posted
in the dormitories, gyms, and out
side the Cellar. The tournament
will be open to all Stanford sum
mer students. Entrance fee will
consist of 75 cents or a punch from
a script card.
The handicap will be based on a
blind bogey system. Before teeing
off, every player will estimate the
handicap ho will need to shoot a
score in between 36 and 42. After
he has played, this handicap will
be subtracted from the score he
shoots. At the end of the tourney,
the numbers from 36 to 42 will be
put into a hat and the number
which is pulled out will be the net
score that will win the tourna
ment.
"In this system," said John
Phelps, chairman of the tourna
ment, "Everyone will have a
chance no matter how poor, or
how good a player he happens to
be."
Pairing will be posted at the
Stanford golf course on the Mon
day of the tourney. The specific
time for teeing-off has been
changed from 3 p.m. to 1 p.m. due
to conflicts which are caused by
early classes. If a player wishes
to tee-off at a certain time, he
should put his name next to that
time on the sign-up sheet.
"Again, I wish to emphasize
that this is an amateur tourney,
so skill is no prerequisite. We
don't expect you to have broken
par at Pebble Beach before enter
ing the Second Summer Golf
Tournament," were the further
words of Phelps.


Talking over the handicap of the golf tournament to be held by
the ASSU next Monday are, from left to right, Dick Laing, John
Rubin, Wally Hunter, and Chick Gast.

Stanford golf course on the Mon
day of the tourney. The specific
time for teeing-off has been
changed from 3 p.m. to 1 p.m. due
to conflicts which are caused by
early classes. If a player wishes
to tee-off at a certain time, he
should put his name next to that
time on the sign-up sheet.
"Again, I wish to emphasize
that this is an amateur tourney,
so skill is no prerequisite. We
don't expect you to have broken
par at Pebble Beach before enter
ing the Second Summer Golf
Tournament," were the further
words of Phelps.


Talking over the handicap of the golf tournament to be held by
the ASSU next Monday are, from left to right, Dick Laing, John
Rubin, Wally Hunter, and Chick Gast.
Friday has been designated as the last day for signing up for the
ASSU summer, nine hole golt tournament that will be held Monday,
July 22, at 1 p.m.
The winner of the one-day, handicapped tourney will receive a
trophy donated by "Old Pard" of Pard's Bar-B-Q. The winner will
be the contestant with the lowest net score. Other prizes will be

awarded for the lowest gross score
and the lowest number of puts. A
boobie prize and other special
awards will also be given. How
ever, only one prize may be won by
any given player.
Sign-up sheets have been posted
in the dormitories, gyms, and out
side the Cellar. The tournament
will be open to all Stanford sum
mer students. Entrance fee will
consist of 75 cents or a punch from
a script card.
The handicap will be based on a
blind bogey system. Before teeing
off, every player will estimate the
handicap ho will need to shoot a
score in between 36 and 42. After
he has played, this handicap will
be subtracted from the score he
shoots. At the end of the tourney,
the numbers from 36 to 42 will be
put into a hat and the number
which is pulled out will be the net
score that will win the tourna
ment.
"In this system," said John
Phelps, chairman of the tourna
ment, "Everyone will have a
chance no matter how poor, or
how good a player he happens to
be."
Pairing will be posted at the
Stanford golf course on the Mon
