# Old Engineering Building Nearly Falls in Excavation
## 
### 
The thirty-hour battle to save Stanford's 50-year-old engineering
building apparently ended in success for the weary emergency crew
early Friday morning. The building, constructed of sandstone blocks,
threatened to slide into a ten-foot excavation which extended under
its foundation.
The condition of the building was discovered by two graduate stu-

dents and their wives on Thurs
day night. They reportedly heard
the building break up, giving off
"rifle-report" cracks. The students
notified their professor, who in
turn ordered the building to be
evacuated.
Construction crews, after turn
ing off gas, steam, and electricity,
began the process of reinforcing
the building with timbers and
jacks. It is believed that the
building has been saved, but fur
ther investigations will have to be
made to determine the extent of
damage.
The workmen apparently be
lieved that the building was re
inforced with steel, as most mod
ern buildings are, failing to use
sufficient support of the founda
tion.


SHOOK, RATTLED, BUT DIDN'T ROLL
