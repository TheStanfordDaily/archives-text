## 
### 
Professor Anthony E. Sokol of
the Asiatic and Slavic Studies De
partment has returned from a
year in Vienna, Austria, where
he was a visiting professor under
the Fulbright Program at the Uni
versity of Vienna.
In addition to his work at the
University, Professor Sokol was
engaged in lecturing on American
culture to audiences throughout
Austria, showing slides and films
which he had taken with him.
Most of the slides were contrib
uted by people in Palo Alto and
San Francisco. This proved to be
very effective in illustrating life
in California.
Professor Soku: has resumed
teaching this summer in the Asi
atic and Slavic Studies Depart
ment, giving courses on Indonesia
and Sea Power.
