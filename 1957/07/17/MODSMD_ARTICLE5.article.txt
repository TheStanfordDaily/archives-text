# Opening Show Tonight of 'Servant of Two Masters'
## 
### SHARON JOHNSTON 
First nighters will view the opening performance of Carlo Goldoni's
"The Servant of Two Masters," this evening at 8:15 p.m. in the Little
Theater in Memorial Hall.
A galloping farce, this first production of the summer session, will
run from July 17 through 20 and July 24 through 27.
Suprisingly enough, the "commedia dell'arte" comedy bears a strik-

ing resemblance to the modern
day circus clown antics. Featur
ing the talents of Phil Schultz,
Ralph Klein, Carolyn Davis, Shir
ley Douglas, Jeanne Rick and Mor
ris Winer and other well known
Stanford students, the play is
bound to give the audience indul
gence in a delightful evening.
Quite briefly, the plot revolves
about the ludicrous actions of
Truffoldino (Ralph Klein) who
manages to be the slave of both
Worindo (Richard Lamb) and Bea
trice (Carolyn Davis). Beatrice
disguises as a man in order to
search for Florindo, her lover, who
has killed her brother in a dual.
At the household of Pantolone
(Phil Schultz), Beatrice in the
clothing of her brother goes to
receive money due her dead
brother and in doing so disrupts
the proposed marriage of the Doc
tor's (Morris Winer) son, Silvio
(Peter Runp) and Clarice (Shir
ley Douglass), Pantolone's daugh
ter. Beatrice's dead brother has
>ecn promised the hand of Clarice
ind Pantolone reverses the fables
jy giving the hand of his daughter
L o the disguised Beatrice. Begin
ning to unwind, the play disclosed
Truffoldino's love for Sveroldina
(Jeanne Rich), the maid servant
to Clarice, and after a series of
false stories and much taboo the
play discloses an inevitable and
rolicking end.
All tickets for "The Servant of
Two Masters" are reserved and
may be purchased at the Memorial
Auditorium Box Office or at the
Peninsula Box Office. Prices for
tickets are $1.00 and $1.50.
