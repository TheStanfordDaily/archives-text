# NO 'BIG' DECISIONS
## Summer ASSU Legislates Fun 
### 
Even though 13 may be an un
lucky number, the 13 members
of the ASSU Summer Quarter
Legislature have been respon
sible to Stanford Summertimers
for activities including dances,
open houses, sports tournaments,
watermelon feeds and parties.
This year the summer quarter

officers are Don "Skip" Skip
worth, president; Margaret
Knowles, vice-president; Beverly
Ann Fitch, student financial
manager and graduate represen
tative; Claire Nemoede, Summer
Weekly editor; Emma Rose Badg
er, education council representa
tive; Wendy Hawley, vice-presi
dent, 1957-58; Alice Katsy, frosh
representative; Connie King,
AWS president; John Phelps and
Dick Offutt, undergraduate men's
representatives; Harry Roberts,
judicial council representative;
John Schoettler, frosh represen
tative; and Carol Sowers, under
graduate women's representa
tive.
The president acts in a non
voting capacity as the represen
tative of the student body. Dur
ing the summer no major legis
lation on social programs or
planning is passed.
The vice-president acts as the
social chairman. She co-ordinates
campus social activities.
The secretary, Katie Garcia, is
a non-voting, hired officer with a
salary. She types, and does all
the office work. She is not a
member of the student body.
All officers are elected with
the exception of the freshmen,
who are elected at house meet
ings. Unlike regular sessions,
most of the summer legislation
deals with social planning for the

summer. Consequently, ex-officio
members play an important part.
This year, students seem to be
enthusiastically supporting all
activities.
