"Cubberley of Stanford," a bi
ography written by Jesse B.
Sears and Adin D. Henderson,
will be published by the Stanford
University Press on July 31.
By writing this book, Sears
and Henderson have followed
one of Ellwood Patterson Cub
berley's beliefs: that students
and teachers of education should
be acquainted with the great
minds in the field of education.
Cubberley was indeed one of the
great minds of education.
Cubberley's educational career
began when he attended a lecture
by David Starr Jordan, then
President of Indiana University,
later President of Stanford Uni
versity. He was so inspired by

Jordan that he enrolled at In
diana University. In 1891 he
graduated from college and took
a position at Ridgeville College
and later at Vincennes Univer
sity. Eventually, he was appoint
ed President of Vincennes.
In 1896, Cubberley resigned to
take on the Superintendency of
Schools in San Diego, California.
He accepted an assistant profes
sorship at Stanford University in
1898.
Cubberley eventually became
the head of Stanford's School of
Education, and became a well
known writer, lecturer and lead
er.
He retired in 1933, and donated
the bulk of his fortune, made
from writing and from stocks
and bonds, to Stanford in the
form of a trust fund.
In 1938, a new School of Edu
tion building was completed.
Sears and Henderson have done
a superb job in presenting to the
public the story of so deserving
a man as Cubberley. The major
criticism is that Cubberley's
childhood is reviewed in too much
detail and seems to be irrelevant
to the general story.
The world of education was so
vastly improved by Cubberley
that it is the duty and the privi
lege of this world to read this
fascinating story of one of the
great men in the history of edu
cation, Cubberley of Stanford.

He retired in 1933, and donated
the bulk of his fortune, made
from writing and from stocks
and bonds, to Stanford in the
form of a trust fund.
In 1938, a new School of Edu
tion building was completed.
Sears and Henderson have done
a superb job in presenting to the
public the story of so deserving
a man as Cubberley. The major
criticism is that Cubberley's
childhood is reviewed in too much
detail and seems to be irrelevant
to the general story.
The world of education was so
vastly improved by Cubberley
that it is the duty and the privi
lege of this world to read this
fascinating story of one of the
great men in the history of edu
cation, Cubberley of Stanford.
