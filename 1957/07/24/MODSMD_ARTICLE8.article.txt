### KENNETH WATERS 
With the production of Carlo
Goldoni's THE SERVANT OF
TWO MASTERS the Stanford
Players placed a new mark on the
history of drama at Stanford. It
was the first time that Carlo
Goldoni, the most prolific and per
haps the greatest writer of Italian
comedy, had been presented to a
Stanford audience.
Director Paul Angeloff and his
cast were faced with the knotty
problem of producing a play writ
ten in the early and more-or-less
unstable part of Goldoni's career,
a time during which the play
wright wrote imitations of the es
tablished "Commcdia doll arte"
rather than freeing himself some
what from tradition, as he later
did, for the writing of native com
edies. Since it is in the latter area
that Goldoni's true greatness is to

be found, it is unfortunate that
one of his later plays was not
chosen ior his Stanford premiere.
Characters Lack Depth
THE SERVANT OF TWO MAS
TERS is a typical comedy of the

early 18th century Italian era. It
dates in origin back to the plays
and intrigues originally staged by
Menander, and Plautus, and Ter
rence. The characters are stock
stylizations of the old Roman com
ics and, in many ways, lack depth
and perspective.
The plot is the standard one in
which, by the naive ingenuity of
the cleverly-foolish servant, two
young couples are torn asunder
and then reunited to live happily
until the curtain finally falls.
Art of Interpretation
The "Commedia" style of buf
foonerie is far removed from our
modern style of comic acting. The
lack of depth and perspective in
character demands an art of inter
pretation rarely seen on the pres
ence will perhaps fare better than
difficulty the Stanford actors had
