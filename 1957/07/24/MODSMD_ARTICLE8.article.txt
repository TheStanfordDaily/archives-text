# 'Servant of Two Masters' Reviewed; Show Continues Through Saturday
## 
### KENNETH WATERS 
With the production of Carlo
Goldoni's THE SERVANT OF
TWO MASTERS the Stanford
Players placed a new mark on the
history of drama at Stanford. It
was the first time that Carlo
Goldoni, the most prolific and per
haps the greatest writer of Italian
comedy, had been presented to a
Stanford audience.
Director Paul Angeloff and his
cast were faced with the knotty
problem of producing a play writ
ten in the early and more-or-less
unstable part of Goldoni's career,
a time during which the play
wright wrote imitations of the es
tablished "Commcdia doll arte"
rather than freeing himself some
what from tradition, as he later
did, for the writing of native com
edies. Since it is in the latter area
that Goldoni's true greatness is to

be found, it is unfortunate that
one of his later plays was not
chosen ior his Stanford premiere.
Characters Lack Depth
THE SERVANT OF TWO MAS
TERS is a typical comedy of the

early 18th century Italian era. It
dates in origin back to the plays
and intrigues originally staged by
Menander, and Plautus, and Ter
rence. The characters are stock
stylizations of the old Roman com
ics and, in many ways, lack depth
and perspective.
The plot is the standard one in
which, by the naive ingenuity of
the cleverly-foolish servant, two
young couples are torn asunder
and then reunited to live happily
until the curtain finally falls.
Art of Interpretation
The "Commedia" style of buf
foonerie is far removed from our
modern style of comic acting. The
lack of depth and perspective in
character demands an art of inter
pretation rarely seen on the pres
ence will perhaps fare better than
difficulty the Stanford actors had
to face. Unfortunately too many
of them became the "servants"
of their problem rather than the
"masters" of it.
Carolyn Davis as Beatrice and
Morris Winer as the Doctor
seemed to have had the problem
well in hand, however, and turned
in thoroughly enjoyable and ac
ceptable performances. There was
no stinting of enthusiasm or sin
cerity on the part of the rest of
the cast, but these two assets can
not substitute for characterization
and pace. Too often it seemed that
the Venetian gondolas had been
scuttled and motor boats substi
tuted and that "O Sole Mio" had
been exchanged for "Rock, Rattle
and Roar!"
Set Changes Delightful
Mr. Angeloff often displayed a
ready wit in staging his produc
tion. Much of his stage business
was delightful and his use of four
"Zanis" for set changes had his
audiences bellowing forth with the
best laughs of the night.
Robert McFarland's costumes
gave color and brilliance to the
production. The sets, created by
Mr. Angeloff, were interesting,
practical and imaginative and ef
fectively set the mood of the pro
duction.
Hope for Others of Goldoni
We hope that this will not be the
last of Goldoni at Stanford. Some
day, it is to be hoped, his master
pieces such as THE MISTRESS
OF THE INN, THE FAN, or THE
COFFEE HOUSE will appear. We
feel that director, cast, and audi
ence wlil perhaps fare better than
with THE SERVANT OF TWO
MASTERS.
In the meantime, however, some
Goldoni is better than none and
you'll do well to run over Little
Theatre way about 8:15, p.m. to
night or any night through this
Saturday.

In the meantime, however, some
Goldoni is better than none and
you'll do well to run over Little
Theatre way about 8:15, p.m. to
night or any night through this
Saturday.
With the production of Carlo
Goldoni's THE SERVANT OF
TWO MASTERS the Stanford
Players placed a new mark on the
history of drama at Stanford. It
was the first time that Carlo
Goldoni, the most prolific and per
haps the greatest writer of Italian
comedy, had been presented to a
Stanford audience.
Director Paul Angeloff and his
cast were faced with the knotty
problem of producing a play writ
ten in the early and more-or-less
unstable part of Goldoni's career,
a time during which the play
wright wrote imitations of the es
tablished "Commcdia doll arte"
rather than freeing himself some
what from tradition, as he later
did, for the writing of native com
edies. Since it is in the latter area
that Goldoni's true greatness is to

be found, it is unfortunate that
one of his later plays was not
chosen ior his Stanford premiere.
Characters Lack Depth
THE SERVANT OF TWO MAS
TERS is a typical comedy of the

early 18th century Italian era. It
dates in origin back to the plays
and intrigues originally staged by
Menander, and Plautus, and Ter
rence. The characters are stock
stylizations of the old Roman com
ics and, in many ways, lack depth
and perspective.
The plot is the standard one in
which, by the naive ingenuity of
the cleverly-foolish servant, two
young couples are torn asunder
and then reunited to live happily
until the curtain finally falls.
Art of Interpretation
The "Commedia" style of buf
foonerie is far removed from our
modern style of comic acting. The
lack of depth and perspective in
character demands an art of inter
pretation rarely seen on the pres
ence will perhaps fare better than
difficulty the Stanford actors had
to face. Unfortunately too many
of them became the "servants"
of their problem rather than the
"masters" of it.
Carolyn Davis as Beatrice and
Morris Winer as the Doctor
seemed to have had the problem
well in hand, however, and turned
in thoroughly enjoyable and ac
ceptable performances. There was
no stinting of enthusiasm or sin
cerity on the part of the rest of
the cast, but these two assets can
not substitute for characterization
and pace. Too often it seemed that
the Venetian gondolas had been
scuttled and motor boats substi
tuted and that "O Sole Mio" had
been exchanged for "Rock, Rattle
and Roar!"
Set Changes Delightful
Mr. Angeloff often displayed a
ready wit in staging his produc
tion. Much of his stage business
was delightful and his use of four
"Zanis" for set changes had his
audiences bellowing forth with the
best laughs of the night.
Robert McFarland's costumes
gave color and brilliance to the
production. The sets, created by
Mr. Angeloff, were interesting,
practical and imaginative and ef
fectively set the mood of the pro
duction.
Hope for Others of Goldoni
We hope that this will not be the
last of Goldoni at Stanford. Some
day, it is to be hoped, his master
pieces such as THE MISTRESS
OF THE INN, THE FAN, or THE
COFFEE HOUSE will appear. We
feel that director, cast, and audi
ence wlil perhaps fare better than
with THE SERVANT OF TWO
MASTERS.
