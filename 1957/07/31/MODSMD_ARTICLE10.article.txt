# 'Bridge' Links Foreign Alums With Campus
## 
### 
A new international magazine
has been started at Stanford for
the purpose of getting the foreign
student away from his tendency
of isolating himself from other
elements on the University cam
pus.
The "Bridge," the title of the
publication, strives to break down
artificial barriers of isolation and
give the foreign student a chance
to voice his opinions and view
points on campus life.
However, the "Bridge" is not
exclusively for foreign students,
but it is also open to those Ameri
can students who have traveled
and attended other universities
abroad.
The "Bridge" also will try to act
as a link between the international
alumni and Stanford. There will
be articles by and about the pro
fessors on the Stanford campus
who have come from abroad.
In the light of international re
lations, there will be a new Stan
ford International Center, located
at 539 Lasuen Row. It is hoped
that the center will be in operation
by the opening of the Autumn
quarter and some of its facilities
can be used for the Foreign Stu
dent Orientation Program which
will start on Wednesday, Septem
ber 11, 1957.
The executive officers, Mrs. Inez
Richardson and Werner Warm
brunn, will initiate the operation
of the center through the organ
ization of a number of advisory
committees on which staff, stu
dents, and the community will be
represented. The following tem
porary committees will be set up:
Staff Committee; Furniture
Committee; House Committee;
Program Committee.
