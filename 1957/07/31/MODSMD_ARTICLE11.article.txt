# Petri In Concert Here Friday Eve
## 
### 
Egon Petri, concert pianist, will
give a concert Friday evening at
8:30 p.m. The program for the re
cital was announced last week by
the Stanford department of Music.
The concert opens with the
"Capriccio on the departure of his
beloved brother" by J. S. Bach.
The program of the work de
scribes the attempts of friends
and relatives to dissuade the
brother from taking the journey,
and ends with a fugue built on
the melody of the horn of the pos
tilion which carries him away.
The second number is a Menuet
by Bach-Petri, based on three men
uets written by Bach for his son,
Wilhelm Friedemann. The "Son
ata No. 32" in C minor, Op. 111,
by Beethoven completes the first
portion of the program.
The second half begins with
"Two Fairy Tales," Op. 20, and the
"Danza Festiva" by the late Rus
sian composer and pianist, Nico
lay Medtner. Next are two com
positions by Chopinâ€”the "Noc
turne" in D flat major and the
"Ballad" in F minor. The final
numbers on the program are the
"Ricordanza" and "Hungarian
Rhapsody" No. 12 by Franz Liszt.
Petri has been considered as one
of the leading pianists of the twen

tieth century. lie came from a
very musical family in Holland,
his father being the first violinist
and leader of the Petri Quartet.
Friends of the family and visitors
at the boy's home included many
of the great names of the 19th
century: Tchaikowsky, Grieg,
Brahms, Joaehin, Mahler, Anton
Rubenstein, and others. He began
his musical career on the violin,
playing with his father's quartet.
At the age of 20 he was urged by
his teacher, the famous pianist
Busoni, to change to the piano.
He did this and made his debut in
Utrecht in 1001. Since then he has
appeared in concert tours in every
European country and as soloist
with all the great orchestras of
the world. He first came to Amer
ica in 1032, settled here in 1040,
and has since become an American
citizen.
