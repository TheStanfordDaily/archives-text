# English Students Offer Challenge
## 
### 
A letter from Surrey, England,
was sent to Stanford recently,
containing a challenge to any
members of Stanford University
who might be interested in a road
race.
According to the letter from
three undergraduates who have
completed their first year at Wor
cester College, Oxford, the race
shall start somewhere in the
United States on the 401 h parallel
and continue south to the town of
Puerto Montt in Chile.
The journey is to be undertaken
by each party—one from Stanford
University—in a Land Rover,
Jeep, or some other rugged and
suitable vehicle. The route would
be on the Pan American Highway,
for the most part. Where the road
is not, boat will be the mode of
transportation.
All persons interested in enter
ing the race or in financing the
English students are urged to
write to this address: John Cou
per, Murrayfield, Woodland Way,
Purley, Surrey, England.
