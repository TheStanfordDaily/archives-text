### PATRICIA MAHER 
"Joseph Conrad, Achievement and Decline,' 'a critical analysis of
the works of Joseph Conrad, distinguished novelist, has recently
been published by the Harvard University Press. Its author is Thomas
Moser, now in his second year of teaching at Stanford. Moser will be
an assistant professor of English with the beginning of the fall quar
ter. Moser received his A.8., A.M.. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard
University, and before coming to Stanford was on the faculty at
Wellesley College in Massachusetts.

In trying to clearly analyze Jo
seph Conrad, Mr. Moser has set
for himself an almost impossible
task. The general opinion, more
or less, among those who have
studied the great novels and novel
ists, is that Joseph Conrad is one
of literature's most complex au
thors. However, Mr. Moser has
produced a very enlightening
piece of material; mainly because
he has acquainted himself so well
with Joseph Conrad and his
works.
Moser endeavors to explain
Conrad to the reader by careful
scrutiny of the style and structure
of Conrad's novels. He also delves
into the personalities of the char
acters in the different books. One
of the most interesting portions
in Moser's book is that in which
he classifies Conrad's three major
types of characters. This in itself
will help a beginning reader of
Conrad understand his novels with
greater ease.
Joseph Conrad wrote with great
depth in his early novels. Upon
reading "Lord Jim" or "Nos
tromo" (possibly Conrad's most
brilliant novel) the reader may
find himself wondering what is
happening. Mr. Moser explains
that this was Conrad's plan. The
characters were experiencing
emotional confusion, so Conrad
wanted to get that same feeling
across to the reader.
