# INCONSPICUOUS, THOUGH
## Hugem Project Is Med Center 
### 
The largest—and the least conspicuous—construction project be
gun at Stanford this summer has reached the concrete-pouring stage
in the open fields behind the Anatomy Building, north of Physics
Corner.
Stanford's $20 million, ultra-modern Medical Center, due for com
pletion in 1959, has emerged from the planning stage into the campus
construction turmoil.

Focal point of the project is the
new $7 million Stanford-Palo Alto
Hospital, financed jointly by Stan
ford (60 percent) and Palo Alto
(40 percent), designed to accom
modate 475 beds and expandable
to a thousand.
Ultimate aim of the project is to
give the University hospital, re
search, and teaching facilities suf
ficient to allow the Stanford Medi
cal School, currently housed in the
Stanford-Lane Hospital in San
Francisco, to return to the cam
pus.
The Medical Center will make a
marked contrast with the present
towered Palo Alto Hospital near
El Camino Real. The new facility
will spread horizontally, its flat
roofed wings encompassing land
scaped courts. The architect is Ed
ward D. Stone, designer of the
United States pavilion planned for
the 1958 Brussels World Fair and
the new American embassy as
New Delhi.
The Medical Center's construc
tion and endowment, plus inciden
tal costs, will require altogether
an investment of over $40 million.
A two-stage fund drive is planned,
the first oriented primarily toward
construction and basic endowment
and geared to raise $21,950,000 by
1959.
Progress reports on a present $6
million fund drive show that two
thirds of that amount had been col
lected by last week.
Original estimates placed cost of
the hospital at over $9 million. Bids
solicited late in the spring sur
prised the planning facility by to
talling only $6,916,548, a figure
termed "a miracle" by planning
officials.
Stanford has departed the
normal contractor-subcontractor
scheme of contracting for the
Medical Center project Instead,
22 separate contracts are to be let
to bidders, with general construc
tion supervision in Wagner & Mar
tine/. of San Francisco, a firm
which handles many of Stanford's
construct ion projects.
Overall coordination of planning
for the project lies with Milton
Johnson of the University Plan
ning Office, whose staff works in

offices set up especially for the
project.
A new director for the Stanford-
Palo Alto Hospital, Dr. E. Dwight
Bennett of Columbia University,
was named late in June. He is a
graduate of Stanford and of Stan
ford Medical School.
The Medical Center will offer
542,000 square feet of floor space.
The new hospital will employ
1,400.
Contractor for the earth and
concrete work currently being
done is Carl Swenson Co. of San
Jose.

The largest—and the least conspicuous—construction project be
gun at Stanford this summer has reached the concrete-pouring stage
in the open fields behind the Anatomy Building, north of Physics
Corner.
Stanford's $20 million, ultra-modern Medical Center, due for com
pletion in 1959, has emerged from the planning stage into the campus
construction turmoil.

Focal point of the project is the
new $7 million Stanford-Palo Alto
Hospital, financed jointly by Stan
ford (60 percent) and Palo Alto
(40 percent), designed to accom
modate 475 beds and expandable
to a thousand.
Ultimate aim of the project is to
give the University hospital, re
search, and teaching facilities suf
ficient to allow the Stanford Medi
cal School, currently housed in the
Stanford-Lane Hospital in San
Francisco, to return to the cam
pus.
The Medical Center will make a
marked contrast with the present
towered Palo Alto Hospital near
El Camino Real. The new facility
will spread horizontally, its flat
roofed wings encompassing land
scaped courts. The architect is Ed
ward D. Stone, designer of the
United States pavilion planned for
the 1958 Brussels World Fair and
the new American embassy as
New Delhi.
The Medical Center's construc
tion and endowment, plus inciden
tal costs, will require altogether
an investment of over $40 million.
A two-stage fund drive is planned,
the first oriented primarily toward
construction and basic endowment
and geared to raise $21,950,000 by
1959.
Progress reports on a present $6
million fund drive show that two
thirds of that amount had been col
lected by last week.
Original estimates placed cost of
the hospital at over $9 million. Bids
solicited late in the spring sur
prised the planning facility by to
talling only $6,916,548, a figure
termed "a miracle" by planning
officials.
Stanford has departed the
normal contractor-subcontractor
scheme of contracting for the
Medical Center project Instead,
22 separate contracts are to be let
to bidders, with general construc
tion supervision in Wagner & Mar
tine/. of San Francisco, a firm
which handles many of Stanford's
construct ion projects.
Overall coordination of planning
for the project lies with Milton
Johnson of the University Plan
ning Office, whose staff works in

offices set up especially for the
project.
A new director for the Stanford-
Palo Alto Hospital, Dr. E. Dwight
Bennett of Columbia University,
was named late in June. He is a
graduate of Stanford and of Stan
ford Medical School.
The Medical Center will offer
542,000 square feet of floor space.
The new hospital will employ
1,400.
Contractor for the earth and
concrete work currently being
done is Carl Swenson Co. of San
Jose.
