# Indians Tackle San Jose In Opener Here Tomorrow
## Taylor to Start All-Veteran Lineup; Cards Picked as PCC Dark Horse 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Upward of 2.),000 gridiron fans are expected to witness the public
unveiling of the 1957 Stanford varsity football team Saturday at 2
p.m. in Stanford Stadium. Helping to draw back the curtain from
around Chuck Taylor's aggregation will be the San Jose State Spar
tans, the Cards' opponents in the opener.
In contrast to last season, when the Indians opened the season as

favorites to win the Pacific Coast
Conference championship an d
make a strong bid for national
honors, this year's te;im has been
consigned a spot near tho bottom
of the PCC well.
Some pre-season forecasts have

placed the Tribe as low us sev
enth, ahead of only Washington
State and Idaho. In other quar
ters Stanford is picked as the
fourth- or fifth-place team. Most
experts, however, do name the
Indians and Oregon as the two
dark-horses of the West.
San Jose, under the guiding
hand of their new coach, Bob Tit
chenal, should provide Taylor's
gridders with a moderately rug
ged test. This, in turn, will give
a good early-season indication of
whether the Cards will run a good
race as dark-horse or will sink to
the depths forecast for them.
During the early part of the
week Taylor would forecast only
a 50-50 chance for his men to whip
the Spartans. But yesterday he
said, "I believe we can win," add
ing that he thought Stanford had
"the weapons" to beat San Jose.
Taylor will field an all-letter
man eleven against the Spartans
headed by co-captains Gary Van
Galder and Jackie Douglas and in
cluding Lou Valli, the second lead
ing ground gainer in the PCC last
season.
Brndie, Wiggln Gone
Gone from the Indians' lineup
will be a pair of All-Americans
from 1956—quarterback John Bro
die and tackle Paul Wiggin.
In Brodie's place, the Cards will
have Douglas. The 5-10, 176-
pounder has played in Brodie's
shadow for two years, showing
well whenever he had the oppor
tunity.
This year the first-string quar
terback job belongs to Douglas as
long as he can hold it. And from
all indications he plans to hang on
tight.
Although Douglas has not yet
blossomed out as a passer of the
caliber of either Brodie or Bob
Garrett, he should be more than
adequate in the aerial depart
ment. In two years he has com
pleted 44 of 94 throws attempted,
a good enough performance to
keep any opponent's defensive
secondary on guard.
Good Runner
Douglas ranks well above Bro
die insofar as running is concern
ed. As it looks now, Douglas will
run a fair share of roll-out op
tions. In practice he has displayed
a good knack for spotting a hole
and scooting through it for quick
yardage.
The workhorse of the Stanford
backfield is almost certain to
again be Valli. Last season he
was the only Indian to run the
ball more than 100 times. He car

ried 120 times, averaging a heal
thy 5.23 yards per trip.
Valli's best effort came against
California, when he set a Big
Game ground-gaining record vyith
209 yards gained from scrimmage.
Last year he was named to the
second team of the PCC All-Con
ference squad and is already be-

ing boosted for the top spot this
fall.
Card Halfbacks
At the halfbacks, A 1 Harring
ton and Jeri McMillin will hold
forth for the Tribe. Harrington
was one of the Indians' most spec
tacular reserves during the '56
campaign.
Whenever he came off the
bench, Harrington's first two or
three carries usually resulted in
plenty of yardage. In all, he
wound up the season as fourth
leading ground gainer for Stan
ford, with a 3.2 average.
McMillin looks ready to im
prove on his excellent sophomore
season record, after being laid low
through a large portion of his
junior year due to a leg injury.
Carried Often
Although never a regular dur
ing the '55 season, McMillin still

lugged the ball more times than
any other Stanford back except
fullback Bill Tarr.
Van Galder, at right end, will
be the anchor-man of the Staf
ford forward wall. He's played a
vital role in Stanford fortunes for
two years, ranking near the top
in any list of outstanding Card
pass-catchers.
Freis at End
Junior Joel Freis has been
named by Taylor to the other end
position. A midseason injury he:.,
him out of three contests last
year, but in the remaining seven
Freis showed plenty of promise
for the future.
The successor to Wiggin at
right tackle is Armand DeWeese,
probably the biggest surprise of
the year on the Stanford tean..
DeWeese went into fall workouts
listed us a fourth-string left guard
who "will have to be at his best
to get much of a tumble."
John Kidd, DeWeese's counter
part on the left side of the line,
is another starter who has been
a bit of a surprise. Most obser
ers expected Barbee, the
sophomore sensation of a year
ago, to easily assume the left
tackle duties.
Stanford actually has three
guards holding down the two
guard and one center positions.
A broken arm suffered by Roi'<
Conklin has forced Taylor to shift
Russ Steele to the center slot until
at least the Rice game, when Con
klin figures to be ready again.
Line Shifts
Steele played center last year,
but had been shifted this spring
to bolster the line. Noel Robi r •
son, last year's regular right
guard, has moved back to his
right side position after spending
some time at left guard in spring
drills.
Taylor was able to move Robin
son back partly because of the
sharp play of Don Manoukian, )
returnee from the 1955 team.
Short and stocky, Manoukian is
one of the Indians' roughest line
men.

who "will have to be at his best
to get much of a tumble."
John Kidd, DeWeese's counter
part on the left side of the line,
is another starter who has been
a bit of a surprise. Most obser
ers expected Barbee, the
sophomore sensation of a year
ago, to easily assume the left
tackle duties.
Stanford actually has three
guards holding down the two
guard and one center positions.
A broken arm suffered by Roi'<
Conklin has forced Taylor to shift
Russ Steele to the center slot until
at least the Rice game, when Con
klin figures to be ready again.
Line Shifts
Steele played center last year,
but had been shifted this spring
to bolster the line. Noel Robi r •
son, last year's regular right
guard, has moved back to his
right side position after spending
some time at left guard in spring
drills.
Taylor was able to move Robin
son back partly because of the
sharp play of Don Manoukian, )
returnee from the 1955 team.
Short and stocky, Manoukian is
one of the Indians' roughest line
men.
Upward of 2.),000 gridiron fans are expected to witness the public

tans, the Cards' opponents in the opener.
In contrast to last season, when the Indians opened the season as

placed the Tribe as low us sev
enth, ahead of only Washington
State and Idaho. In other quar
ters Stanford is picked as the
fourth- or fifth-place team. Most
experts, however, do name the
Indians and Oregon as the two
dark-horses of the West.
San Jose, under the guiding
hand of their new coach, Bob Tit
chenal, should provide Taylor's
gridders with a moderately rug
ged test. This, in turn, will give
a good early-season indication of
whether the Cards will run a good
race as dark-horse or will sink to
the depths forecast for them.
During the early part of the
week Taylor would forecast only
a 50-50 chance for his men to whip
the Spartans. But yesterday he
said, "I believe we can win," add
ing that he thought Stanford had
"the weapons" to beat San Jose.
Taylor will field an all-letter
man eleven against the Spartans
headed by co-captains Gary Van
Galder and Jackie Douglas and in
cluding Lou Valli, the second lead
ing ground gainer in the PCC last
season.
Brndie, Wiggln Gone
Gone from the Indians' lineup
will be a pair of All-Americans
from 1956—quarterback John Bro
die and tackle Paul Wiggin.
In Brodie's place, the Cards will
have Douglas. The 5-10, 176-
pounder has played in Brodie's
shadow for two years, showing
well whenever he had the oppor
tunity.
This year the first-string quar
terback job belongs to Douglas as
long as he can hold it. And from
all indications he plans to hang on
tight.
Although Douglas has not yet
blossomed out as a passer of the
caliber of either Brodie or Bob
Garrett, he should be more than
adequate in the aerial depart
ment. In two years he has com
pleted 44 of 94 throws attempted,
a good enough performance to
keep any opponent's defensive
secondary on guard.
Good Runner
Douglas ranks well above Bro
die insofar as running is concern
ed. As it looks now, Douglas will
run a fair share of roll-out op
tions. In practice he has displayed
a good knack for spotting a hole
and scooting through it for quick
yardage.
The workhorse of the Stanford
backfield is almost certain to
again be Valli. Last season he
was the only Indian to run the
ball more than 100 times. He car

ried 120 times, averaging a heal
thy 5.23 yards per trip.
Valli's best effort came against
California, when he set a Big
Game ground-gaining record vyith
209 yards gained from scrimmage.
Last year he was named to the
second team of the PCC All-Con
ference squad and is already be-

ing boosted for the top spot this
fall.
Card Halfbacks
At the halfbacks, A 1 Harring
ton and Jeri McMillin will hold
forth for the Tribe. Harrington
was one of the Indians' most spec
tacular reserves during the '56
campaign.
Whenever he came off the
bench, Harrington's first two or
three carries usually resulted in
plenty of yardage. In all, he
wound up the season as fourth
leading ground gainer for Stan
ford, with a 3.2 average.
McMillin looks ready to im
prove on his excellent sophomore
season record, after being laid low
through a large portion of his
junior year due to a leg injury.
Carried Often
Although never a regular dur
ing the '55 season, McMillin still

lugged the ball more times than
any other Stanford back except
fullback Bill Tarr.
Van Galder, at right end, will
be the anchor-man of the Staf
ford forward wall. He's played a
vital role in Stanford fortunes for
two years, ranking near the top
in any list of outstanding Card
pass-catchers.
Freis at End
Junior Joel Freis has been
named by Taylor to the other end
position. A midseason injury he:.,
him out of three contests last
year, but in the remaining seven
Freis showed plenty of promise
for the future.
The successor to Wiggin at
right tackle is Armand DeWeese,
probably the biggest surprise of
the year on the Stanford tean..

wound up the season as fourth
leading ground gainer for Stan
ford, with a 3.2 average.
McMillin looks ready to im
prove on his excellent sophomore
season record, after being laid low
through a large portion of his
junior year due to a leg injury.
Carried Often
Although never a regular dur
ing the '55 season, McMillin still

lugged the ball more times than
any other Stanford back except
fullback Bill Tarr.
Van Galder, at right end, will
be the anchor-man of the Staf
ford forward wall. He's played a
vital role in Stanford fortunes for
two years, ranking near the top
in any list of outstanding Card
pass-catchers.
Freis at End
Junior Joel Freis has been
named by Taylor to the other end
position. A midseason injury he:.,
him out of three contests last
year, but in the remaining seven
Freis showed plenty of promise
for the future.
The successor to Wiggin at
right tackle is Armand DeWeese,
probably the biggest surprise of
the year on the Stanford tean..
DeWeese went into fall workouts
listed us a fourth-string left guard
who "will have to be at his best
to get much of a tumble."
John Kidd, DeWeese's counter
part on the left side of the line,
is another starter who has been
a bit of a surprise. Most obser
ers expected Barbee, the
sophomore sensation of a year
ago, to easily assume the left
tackle duties.
Stanford actually has three
guards holding down the two
guard and one center positions.
A broken arm suffered by Roi'<
Conklin has forced Taylor to shift
Russ Steele to the center slot until
at least the Rice game, when Con
klin figures to be ready again.
Line Shifts
Steele played center last year,
but had been shifted this spring
to bolster the line. Noel Robi r •
son, last year's regular right
guard, has moved back to his
right side position after spending
some time at left guard in spring
drills.
Taylor was able to move Robin
son back partly because of the
sharp play of Don Manoukian, )
returnee from the 1955 team.
Short and stocky, Manoukian is
one of the Indians' roughest line
men.
Upward of 2.),000 gridiron fans are expected to witness the public
unveiling of the 1957 Stanford varsity football team Saturday at 2

around Chuck Taylor's aggregation will be the San Jose State Spar
tans, the Cards' opponents in the opener.
In contrast to last season, when the Indians opened the season as

favorites to win the Pacific Coast
Conference championship an d
make a strong bid for national
honors, this year's te;im has been
consigned a spot near tho bottom
of the PCC well.

enth, ahead of only Washington
State and Idaho. In other quar
ters Stanford is picked as the
fourth- or fifth-place team. Most
experts, however, do name the
Indians and Oregon as the two
dark-horses of the West.
San Jose, under the guiding
hand of their new coach, Bob Tit
chenal, should provide Taylor's
gridders with a moderately rug
ged test. This, in turn, will give
a good early-season indication of
whether the Cards will run a good
race as dark-horse or will sink to
the depths forecast for them.
During the early part of the
week Taylor would forecast only
a 50-50 chance for his men to whip
the Spartans. But yesterday he
said, "I believe we can win," add
ing that he thought Stanford had
"the weapons" to beat San Jose.
Taylor will field an all-letter
man eleven against the Spartans
headed by co-captains Gary Van
Galder and Jackie Douglas and in
cluding Lou Valli, the second lead
ing ground gainer in the PCC last
season.
Brndie, Wiggln Gone
Gone from the Indians' lineup
will be a pair of All-Americans
from 1956—quarterback John Bro
die and tackle Paul Wiggin.
In Brodie's place, the Cards will
have Douglas. The 5-10, 176-
pounder has played in Brodie's
shadow for two years, showing
well whenever he had the oppor
tunity.
This year the first-string quar
terback job belongs to Douglas as
long as he can hold it. And from
all indications he plans to hang on
tight.
Although Douglas has not yet
blossomed out as a passer of the
caliber of either Brodie or Bob
Garrett, he should be more than
adequate in the aerial depart
ment. In two years he has com
pleted 44 of 94 throws attempted,
a good enough performance to
keep any opponent's defensive
secondary on guard.
Good Runner
Douglas ranks well above Bro
die insofar as running is concern
ed. As it looks now, Douglas will
run a fair share of roll-out op
tions. In practice he has displayed
a good knack for spotting a hole
and scooting through it for quick
yardage.
The workhorse of the Stanford
backfield is almost certain to
again be Valli. Last season he
was the only Indian to run the
ball more than 100 times. He car

ried 120 times, averaging a heal
thy 5.23 yards per trip.
Valli's best effort came against
California, when he set a Big
Game ground-gaining record vyith
209 yards gained from scrimmage.
Last year he was named to the
second team of the PCC All-Con
ference squad and is already be-

ing boosted for the top spot this
fall.
Card Halfbacks
At the halfbacks, A 1 Harring
ton and Jeri McMillin will hold
forth for the Tribe. Harrington
was one of the Indians' most spec
tacular reserves during the '56
campaign.
Whenever he came off the
bench, Harrington's first two or
three carries usually resulted in
plenty of yardage. In all, he
wound up the season as fourth

ford, with a 3.2 average.

run a fair share of roll-out op
tions. In practice he has displayed
a good knack for spotting a hole
and scooting through it for quick
yardage.
The workhorse of the Stanford
backfield is almost certain to
again be Valli. Last season he
was the only Indian to run the
ball more than 100 times. He car

ried 120 times, averaging a heal
thy 5.23 yards per trip.
Valli's best effort came against
California, when he set a Big
Game ground-gaining record vyith
209 yards gained from scrimmage.
Last year he was named to the
second team of the PCC All-Con
ference squad and is already be-

ing boosted for the top spot this
fall.
Card Halfbacks
At the halfbacks, A 1 Harring
ton and Jeri McMillin will hold
forth for the Tribe. Harrington
was one of the Indians' most spec
tacular reserves during the '56
campaign.
Whenever he came off the
bench, Harrington's first two or
three carries usually resulted in
plenty of yardage. In all, he
wound up the season as fourth
leading ground gainer for Stan
ford, with a 3.2 average.
McMillin looks ready to im
prove on his excellent sophomore
season record, after being laid low
through a large portion of his
junior year due to a leg injury.
Carried Often
Although never a regular dur
ing the '55 season, McMillin still

lugged the ball more times than
any other Stanford back except
fullback Bill Tarr.
Van Galder, at right end, will
be the anchor-man of the Staf
ford forward wall. He's played a
vital role in Stanford fortunes for
two years, ranking near the top
in any list of outstanding Card
pass-catchers.
Freis at End
Junior Joel Freis has been
named by Taylor to the other end
position. A midseason injury he:.,
him out of three contests last
year, but in the remaining seven
Freis showed plenty of promise
for the future.
The successor to Wiggin at
right tackle is Armand DeWeese,
probably the biggest surprise of
the year on the Stanford tean..
DeWeese went into fall workouts
listed us a fourth-string left guard
who "will have to be at his best
to get much of a tumble."
John Kidd, DeWeese's counter
part on the left side of the line,
is another starter who has been
a bit of a surprise. Most obser
ers expected Barbee, the
sophomore sensation of a year
ago, to easily assume the left
tackle duties.
Stanford actually has three
guards holding down the two
guard and one center positions.
A broken arm suffered by Roi'<
Conklin has forced Taylor to shift
Russ Steele to the center slot until
at least the Rice game, when Con
klin figures to be ready again.
Line Shifts
Steele played center last year,
but had been shifted this spring
to bolster the line. Noel Robi r •
son, last year's regular right
guard, has moved back to his
right side position after spending
some time at left guard in spring
drills.
Taylor was able to move Robin
son back partly because of the
sharp play of Don Manoukian, )
returnee from the 1955 team.
Short and stocky, Manoukian is
one of the Indians' roughest line
men.
Upward of 2.),000 gridiron fans are expected to witness the public
unveiling of the 1957 Stanford varsity football team Saturday at 2
p.m. in Stanford Stadium. Helping to draw back the curtain from
around Chuck Taylor's aggregation will be the San Jose State Spar
tans, the Cards' opponents in the opener.
In contrast to last season, when the Indians opened the season as

favorites to win the Pacific Coast
Conference championship an d
make a strong bid for national
honors, this year's te;im has been
consigned a spot near tho bottom
of the PCC well.
Some pre-season forecasts have

placed the Tribe as low us sev
enth, ahead of only Washington
State and Idaho. In other quar
ters Stanford is picked as the
fourth- or fifth-place team. Most
experts, however, do name the
Indians and Oregon as the two
dark-horses of the West.
San Jose, under the guiding
hand of their new coach, Bob Tit
chenal, should provide Taylor's
gridders with a moderately rug
ged test. This, in turn, will give
a good early-season indication of
whether the Cards will run a good
race as dark-horse or will sink to
the depths forecast for them.
During the early part of the
week Taylor would forecast only
a 50-50 chance for his men to whip
the Spartans. But yesterday he
said, "I believe we can win," add
ing that he thought Stanford had
"the weapons" to beat San Jose.
Taylor will field an all-letter
man eleven against the Spartans
headed by co-captains Gary Van
Galder and Jackie Douglas and in
cluding Lou Valli, the second lead
ing ground gainer in the PCC last
season.
Brndie, Wiggln Gone
Gone from the Indians' lineup
will be a pair of All-Americans
from 1956—quarterback John Bro
die and tackle Paul Wiggin.
In Brodie's place, the Cards will
have Douglas. The 5-10, 176-
pounder has played in Brodie's
shadow for two years, showing
well whenever he had the oppor
tunity.
This year the first-string quar
terback job belongs to Douglas as
long as he can hold it. And from
all indications he plans to hang on
tight.
Although Douglas has not yet
blossomed out as a passer of the
caliber of either Brodie or Bob
Garrett, he should be more than
adequate in the aerial depart
ment. In two years he has com
pleted 44 of 94 throws attempted,
a good enough performance to
keep any opponent's defensive
secondary on guard.
Good Runner
Douglas ranks well above Bro
die insofar as running is concern
ed. As it looks now, Douglas will
run a fair share of roll-out op
tions. In practice he has displayed
a good knack for spotting a hole
and scooting through it for quick
yardage.
