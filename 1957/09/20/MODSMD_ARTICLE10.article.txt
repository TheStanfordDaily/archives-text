## Lists Ideal Attributes of Heart, Mind 
### 
President Wallace Sterling con
centrated on attributes of he;irt
and attributes of mind when he
addressed the Class of 19(>1 Wed
nesday evening.
The University president's ad
dress was a part of the Freshman
Convocation, a service which im
pressively marked their first eve
ning on campus.
jrie listed four important quali
ties of mind: fairness, knowledge,
imagination and, to balance off
the other three, a sense of humor.
Through these he asked the new
Stanford students to learn, to ap
ipraise and to explore.
Responsibility
As attributes of heart, Sterling
asked the freshmen to recognize
willingness to accept responsibil
ity and a sense of purpose.
Turning to the University situ
ation in general, Stanford's presi
dent pointed to cooperation as the
key to education. He said that
because the faculty must some
times sit in judgment, coopera
tion between faculty and student
is necessary.
Before turning to the qualities
necessary for a student, which he
said already had set these fresh
men above many of their friends,
Sterling toJd the class certain
facts about itself.
Knows Class
He said that University offi
cials probably know more about
the class as a class than the stu
dents themselves do.
First and foremost, the" class
represents a cutback in number
of new freshmen accepted. There
fore ii is the most' selective class
yet at Stanford.
The/ president ended with an
other of his annual personable
gems of advice for new freshmen:
"May your pulse lie strong,
your head clear and your horizons
broad."
