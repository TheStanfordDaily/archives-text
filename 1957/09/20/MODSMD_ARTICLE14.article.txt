Stanford's non-teaching employ
ees have received raises of 3Vz to
15 per cent tolaling $250,000 a
year, according to the University.
The increases, effective Sept. 1,
went primarily to administrative
and staff personnel. The move
was preceded by an area-wide sur
vey of salary rates and a job eval
uation study of Stanford em
ployees.
"The raises are an attempt to
get us in line with pay practices
of employers in the Stanford
area," explained Joseph Scroogs.
the University's director of staff
personnel.
iOliminulc Differences
"We are now fairly close to the
average salary schedule. In re
spect to fringe benefits, Stanford
continues to be above average.
Also, we have largely eliminated
inequalities in pay for similar
jobs amo n g different depart
ments."
A little over one-third of Stan
ford's 1500 administrative and
staff personnel were affected by
the action. Another third, work
ing in laboratories under funds
provided by government co n â€¢
tracts, already were receiving
higher pay, he said.
The remainder, dormitory and
dining hall employees and gradu
ate student assistants in academic
departments, also have received
