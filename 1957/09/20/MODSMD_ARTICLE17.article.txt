back and forth to meetings here, placement
tests there, and everything is all a whirl.

With all the social activities surrounding
you at present, there still lurks in the back
ground that serious thought that you are em
barking upon a new phase of your life. There
is little doubt that college life will be a new
and somewhat bewildering experience at first
for all of you.
Hut on that special day in June, 1961, when
you are graduated from this University, you
will probably treasure both the joys and tiie
disappointments of your life at Stanford. Yes,
it will be a new phase of your life. And what
you make of yourselves is entirely up to each
one of you individually.
\\ ith this little thought in mind, we bid you
return to your whirl of pre-reg activities. See
your football team defeat San Jose State tomor
row, enjoy yourself at the "jolly-up" and be
come well acquainted with your classmates.
This is your University; this is your home.
And this newspaper is your newspaper, too. It
is our policy to advise, inform and entertain
you. We of the staff are also students and as
students we again heartily welcome you to our
campus.
