# Great to Be Back
## 
### 
FOR SOME of us vacation lias ended, and
thou(ili we atÂ«- not hack to classes as yet, we
are still busily conducting the business of our
extracurricular activities.
The appearance of campus this past week
seems to he one of beetle preparation for the
coming year. Some old buildings have new
(aces and some new ones have older faces. Ev
ery thing changes.
Well, almost everything.
A new administration has taken over in stu
dent government, and efficiency seems to be
reigning throughout the land. .ASSI 1 President
Jiin Messinger and his able assistants, Vicc-
I'resident Wendy Hawley and Student Finan
cial Manager Marty Johnson seem to have ev
il ything well in hand.
Tom Decker's freshman pre-reg committee
can he seen all over campus taking care of little
emergencies here and there. Also on liand are
11 li Judy I liomas and the foreign student pre
leg group, stationed primarily in the Nitery.

And holed up in a hidden hostel are Brian o'*
Hara and his group of ASSU foreign scholars.
AWS President Oinny filler and Poli Union
chiel kilbum MacMurraugh are making the
rounds, not to mention Chappie's Old Hoy him
self, Jim (Reason. And, of course, l'uh Rel's
('buck Harding is busy as a bee getting things
organized for the coining season, as are also
Kallv Com and our lovely pompon girls.
Over 011 the practice field the football
team is rushing through the last hurried prac
tices before the opening contest tomorrow.
Classes may not have started yet, hut the rush
is on and things are happening.
Sitting here in our luillywcd sanctuary we
have watched this hustle of activity and have
greeted our friends and colleagues as they drop
in, by ones, by twos and by threes, and strangely
enough we greet each other with, "Isn't it great
to he hack V
And yes, we must admit it. It is great to be
hack,
