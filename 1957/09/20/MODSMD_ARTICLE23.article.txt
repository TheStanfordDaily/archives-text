THE MIXTURE AS BEFORE
Today begins my fourth year of writing this column
ami, as before, 1 will continue to explore the issues that
grip the keen young mind of campus America—burning
questions like "Should housemothers be forced to retire
at 28?" and "Should pajtunas and robes be allowed at
first-hour classes?" and "Should proctors be armed?" and
"Should picnicking he permitted in the stacks?" and
"Should teachers above the rank of associate professor
be empowered to perform marriages?" and "Should cap
ital punishment for pledges be abolished?"

retles. They also make Marlboro cigarettes. Marlboro ii
what I am going to talk to you about this year.
Before beginning the current series of columns,- I made
an exhaustive study of Marlboro advertising. This took
almost four minutes. The Marlboro people don't waste
words. They give it to you fast: "You get a lot to like
in a Marlboro . . . Kilter . . . flavor . . . Klip-top Box."
Well, sir, at fir-t this approach seemed to me a little
terse, a bit naked. IVrhaps, thought I, I should drape
it. with a veil of violet pn.se, adorn it with a mantle of
fluffy adjective--, dangle some participles from the ears
.. . Hut then I thought, what for? Doesn't that tell the
whole Marlboro story? . . . 112 ilter . . . Klavor . . . Flip-top
Box.
Marlboro tastes great. The filter works. 80 does the
box. What else do you need to know? »
no, with the Marlboro story qufcklv told, let us turn
immediately to the chief problem of undergraduate life—
the money problem. This has always been a vexing
dilemma, even in my own college days. 1 recall, for
example, a classmate named Oliver Hazard Sigafoos, a
great strapping fellow - landing 14 hands high, who fell
in love with a beautiful Theta named Nikki Spillane,
with hair lite beaten gold and eyeballs like two table
spoons of forget I nine s.
Kvery night Oliver Hazard would take Nikki out to
dine and dance, and then to dine again, for dancing made
Nikki rave ■nous. 'I hen they would go riding in the swan
boats, and then Nikki, her appetite sharpened by the sea
air, would have 8 or 10 cutlets, and then Oliver Hazard
would take her home, stopping on the way to buy her a
pail of oysters or two.
To raise money for these enchanted evenings, Oliver
Hazard look on a number of part-time jobs. Petween
classes he cut hair. Alter school hegutled perches. Krom
dusk to midnight lie vulcanized medicine balls. From
midnight to dawn he trapped night crawlers.
litis crowded schedule took, alas, a heavy toll from
()li ver 11 azard. In t lie space of a mont hhe dwindled from
2(H) to l() 112« pound- but that , curiously enough, proved
his salvation.
Today < diver Hazard is a jockey, earning a handsome
living which, combined with what he makes as a lymph
donor after hours, is quite sufficient to curb N'ikki's
girlish appetite. Today tliev are married and live in I'pper
Marlboro, Maryland, with their two daughters, Filter
and 112 lavor, and their son, Klip-ton Box.

THE MIXTURE AS BEFORE
Today begins my fourth year of writing this column
ami, as before, 1 will continue to explore the issues that
grip the keen young mind of campus America—burning
questions like "Should housemothers be forced to retire
at 28?" and "Should pajtunas and robes be allowed at
first-hour classes?" and "Should proctors be armed?" and
"Should picnicking he permitted in the stacks?" and
"Should teachers above the rank of associate professor
be empowered to perform marriages?" and "Should cap
ital punishment for pledges be abolished?"

what I am going to talk to you about this year.
Before beginning the current series of columns,- I made
an exhaustive study of Marlboro advertising. This took
almost four minutes. The Marlboro people don't waste
words. They give it to you fast: "You get a lot to like
in a Marlboro . . . Kilter . . . flavor . . . Klip-top Box."
Well, sir, at fir-t this approach seemed to me a little
terse, a bit naked. IVrhaps, thought I, I should drape
it. with a veil of violet pn.se, adorn it with a mantle of
fluffy adjective--, dangle some participles from the ears
.. . Hut then I thought, what for? Doesn't that tell the
whole Marlboro story? . . . 112 ilter . . . Klavor . . . Flip-top
Box.
Marlboro tastes great. The filter works. 80 does the
box. What else do you need to know? »
no, with the Marlboro story qufcklv told, let us turn
immediately to the chief problem of undergraduate life—
the money problem. This has always been a vexing
dilemma, even in my own college days. 1 recall, for
example, a classmate named Oliver Hazard Sigafoos, a
great strapping fellow - landing 14 hands high, who fell
in love with a beautiful Theta named Nikki Spillane,
with hair lite beaten gold and eyeballs like two table
spoons of forget I nine s.
Kvery night Oliver Hazard would take Nikki out to
dine and dance, and then to dine again, for dancing made
Nikki rave ■nous. 'I hen they would go riding in the swan
boats, and then Nikki, her appetite sharpened by the sea
air, would have 8 or 10 cutlets, and then Oliver Hazard
would take her home, stopping on the way to buy her a
pail of oysters or two.
