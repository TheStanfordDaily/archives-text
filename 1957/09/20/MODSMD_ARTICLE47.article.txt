# Van Galder, Douglas Voted Grid Captains
## 
### 
Quarterback Jack Douglas and
right end Gary Van Galder were
elected co-captains of the 1957
Stanford varsity in a secret bid
lot of the Indian football squad
last Sunday evening.
Both are double letter-winners
in fool ball and are being
groomed for nomination to post
season all-star squads.
In addition, each has proven
his all-around ability by lettering
in a second varsity sport while
on the Farm.
Van Galder, a 01, 190-lb. red
head from Fresno, has unques
tionably been the outstanding in
dividual performer throughout
the Indians' spring practice and
pre season scrimmages.
Calling on the reflexes which
helped him gain a guard spot on
Howie Dallmar's bask e t b a 1 1
squads during the past two win
ters, Gary is an excellent defen
sive end as well as a top-notch re
ceiver,
Named Best Soph
Tie won the De Swarte-EUer
Memorial Award as outstanding
sophomore footballer in 1955,
when ho was third in pass re
ceiving in Ihe PCC with 20 re
ceptions for 232 yards and two
touchdowns.
Last season Van Galder drop
ped to fifth among Indian receiv
ers after he was disabled by a
mid-season knee injury. Never
theless, he caught 15 passes for
3 Of) yards.
Van Galder is one of four mar
ried members of the 1957 squad.
Small but stocky 5-10, 175,
Douglas is a take - charge guy
who makes up for what he lacks
in height with scrap and ex
tremely quick reactions. And he
can pass.
Playing behind All - American
John Brodie during both the 1955
and 1956 seasons, Jack showed
well each year. He completed 22
of 40 passes as a sophomore for
206 yards, two touchdowns and a
47.8 completion percentage.
Last season he connected on 22
of 48 for 318 yards, two touch
downs and a 45.8 average.
Great Net Record
However. Douglas' reputation
on the gridiron is far surpassed
by his brilliant record on the ten
nis courts.
Last spring, before he became
involved in spring football ses
sions, Jack met and topped the
three outstanding collegiate net
ters on the Coastâ€”if not in ihe
nation UCLA's Mike Green and
Mike Franks, and USC's Alex Ol
medo.
When Chuck Taylor gathered
his footballers for spring prac
tice, Jack forsook tennis tempo
rarily to assure himself of a
spot on the 1957 first squad.
A subsequent injury prevented
his playing in the JVC A A tennis
championships in June, but Jack
did nail down the elusive num
ber one quarterback slot and the
co-captaincy to boot.
