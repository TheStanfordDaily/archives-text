Howie Dallmar, Stanford var
sity basketball coach, will get his
first look at the new crop of
freshman cagers when he meets
with them next Friday.
Dallmar has requested all can
didates for the '57-'5B freshman
team to report to the second
floor of the athletic department
building at 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 27.
On Sept. 30, Dallmar will greet
candidates for the coming sea
son's varsity squad, also at 4:30
on the second floor of the BAC.
He stressed that all men inter
ested in trying out for the var
sity team should report to this
meeting, whether or not they
played basketball last season.
As, of the moment, Dallmar
plans to begin outdoor workouts
Oct. 1, and continue them until
Oct. 15. Conference regulations
will permit the Indians to move
indoors on the 15th, where they
will finish their preseason drills.
This year's PCC schedule prom
ises to be more interesting from
a spectator standpoint, since
Stanford fans will have an op
portunity to see all of the other
eight Coast Conference teams in
action at Ihe Stanford Pavilion.
Last year, only five of the pighl
played here.
