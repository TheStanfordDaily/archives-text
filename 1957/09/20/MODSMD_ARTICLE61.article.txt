# P.O. Chief Urges Box Rental Action
## 
### 
The Stanford Post Office urges
all students, new and old, to file
a Change of Address card at the
post office, and reminds new stu
dents that the campus post office
is independent of the Palo Alto
branch and all mail should bo ad
dressed to Stanford, Calif.
Henry Quinn, foreman of the
post office, urges all new stu
dents who will be living at Lagu-
nila, Roble, Branner, Moore, tin
ion, Toyon and Wilbur halls to
rent a mail box. They cost $5 for
three quarters.
All students not renting post
office boxes will receive their
mail at the General Delivery win
dow. Mail should be addressed
either to General Delivery or to
a box, not to a living group. Mail
is worked up each day by 9 a.m.
and 2 p.m.
