## $250 to $335 per Quarter Hike To Take Effect in Autumn â€™58 
### 
The rising cost of living will come to the Farm a year from now
when tuition takes a one-third jump from $250 to $335 a quarter, or
$750 to $1005 a year.

The increase, to go into effect di
voted by the Board of Trustees a

iring autumn .quarter of 1958, was
rid announced during the summer
by Provost Frederick E. Terman.
The new tuition figure will af
fect all students, Including those
who entered the University before
the rise.
Increased Aid
Provost Terman indicated it is {
the University's intention that no
student lie forced to leave Stan-1
ford because of the increase in
tuition. "We will stand ready to
assist anyone in need by increased
scholarships, loans, or part-time
work opportunities," he said.
In pushing its annual tuition
above the $1000 mark, Stanford
will join such institutions as Yale,
Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins and
Brown.
A University spokesman point-i
ed out that tuition will still pay J
less than half the average cost of
educating a Stanford student. The
rest is paid largely from endow
ment income or gifts.
Provides Improvements
Proceeds from the increase will
go to raise faculty salaries, im
prove the quality of undergradu
ate and graduate aid programs
and to pay for renovations in the
academic plant and for books and |
supplies.
Provost Terman stated th a t
Stanford has held the line against
a tuition increase longer than any j
other major private college or
university.
When Stanford University open
ed in 1891 it was anticipated that
Californians would never have to
pay tuition and that the charge
for out-of-staters would be only a
token payment. Small tuition
rates were necessary before the
1920'5, with the last rise in 1954 ;
when tuition jumped from $220
to $250 per quarter.
