# BIG RED
## Power Still Undisplayed 
### Frank Huntress 
It was ono of those hot autumn
days in Stanford's earthen bowl
Saturday when Coach Chuck Tay
lor's footballers entertained the
newly-arrived freshmen and many
old-timers with a rout of San Jose
State, 46-7.
In what is referred to in this
area as "the game for the cham
pionship of Santa Clara County,"
the Indians so perfectly manhan
dled the Spartans that both root
ers and scouts arc still in the dark
as to the power of the 1957 Red
Machine.
Conversions
But two things spurred conver- 1
sation in the stands by the old
timers. One was the fact that the
Cards kicked four of their first
five points after touchdown, a
feat which was near-impossible at
the close of last season.
The other talk was about the
viciousness of the first- and sec
ond-string lines on defense. For
the first lime in many games, the
linemen looked fast and aggres
sive and were gang-tackling. Even
ihe pass defense was solid.
After the game went into a
rout, the returning upperclass
men spent most of their time talk
ing over old times on the Farm.
Pompon Girls
New pompon girls made their
first appearance of the season.
This year's group includes Sonva
Davison. Luana Gough, Sandy
Hogan. Connie King and Marga
ret Mix.
As is the custom each year, the
San Jose State pompon girls did
their routine in front of the men's
rooting section. And for the first
time in many a moon the SJS
girls were not up to par. In fact,
many of the old-timers claimed
that Stanford's dancing dollies
were much better.
Before the new season got
under way there were even
changes in the yell leading line
ups. Ed Bordenkircher, who was
runncrup to Berk Johnston in the
election for Head Yell Leader last
spring, has taken over that post.
Johnston was suspended from the
University for an Honor Code vio
lation.
Cheer Leaders
Also a change was made in the
second-string cheer leaders. Walt
Jue replaced Greg Lawler, who
failed to obtain the minimum
number of grade points. The
other assistants are Bill Carr, Bob
Roberts and Don Skipworth.
Bordenkircher and his men
came clad as Roman gladiators
witli sheets wrapped around their
shoulders. One of the jokers ever
had a handful of grapes, making
like Julius Caesar.
After the game became a mas
sacre early in the second quarter,
the number of yells became few
and far between.
Stage's Mascot
But San Jose State was not to
be outdone. Their mascot came
clothed in a costume depicting a
Spartan of Greece. His sword and
mask made it very difficult t(
run from The souvenir hunters
who were out to get memento. 1
of the slaughter. But he eseaper'
-apture by finding asylum with
policemen who were on the field.
The frosh men were decked out
this year in new rooters' hat;; re
sembling those worn by Swis:
mountain climbers. They are i
darker shade of cardinal than the
hats of previous years.
Frosh Women
The women of the class of '6 1
wore dressed in the tradition- 0
red skirts and white blouses, with
a red feather in their hair.
During halftime the Stanforr
Band played a few numbers it
the stands, since they were not ii
their uniforms. Their perform
a nee was good considering tha
they have had a negligible amour
of practice together this year and
many of their members were not
present for the game.

Spartan of Greece. His sword and

who were out to get memento. 1
of the slaughter. But he eseaper'

policemen who were on the field.
The frosh men were decked out
this year in new rooters' hat;; re
sembling those worn by Swis:
mountain climbers. They are i
darker shade of cardinal than the
hats of previous years.
Frosh Women
The women of the class of '6 1
wore dressed in the tradition- 0
red skirts and white blouses, with
a red feather in their hair.
During halftime the Stanforr
Band played a few numbers it
the stands, since they were not ii
their uniforms. Their perform
a nee was good considering tha
they have had a negligible amour
of practice together this year and
many of their members were not
present for the game.
It was ono of those hot autumn
days in Stanford's earthen bowl
Saturday when Coach Chuck Tay
lor's footballers entertained the
newly-arrived freshmen and many
old-timers with a rout of San Jose
State, 46-7.
In what is referred to in this
area as "the game for the cham
pionship of Santa Clara County,"
the Indians so perfectly manhan
dled the Spartans that both root
ers and scouts arc still in the dark
as to the power of the 1957 Red
Machine.
Conversions
But two things spurred conver- 1
sation in the stands by the old
timers. One was the fact that the
Cards kicked four of their first
five points after touchdown, a
feat which was near-impossible at
the close of last season.
The other talk was about the
viciousness of the first- and sec
ond-string lines on defense. For
the first lime in many games, the
linemen looked fast and aggres
sive and were gang-tackling. Even
ihe pass defense was solid.
After the game went into a
rout, the returning upperclass
men spent most of their time talk
ing over old times on the Farm.
Pompon Girls
New pompon girls made their
first appearance of the season.
This year's group includes Sonva
Davison. Luana Gough, Sandy
Hogan. Connie King and Marga
ret Mix.
As is the custom each year, the
San Jose State pompon girls did
their routine in front of the men's
rooting section. And for the first
time in many a moon the SJS
girls were not up to par. In fact,
many of the old-timers claimed
that Stanford's dancing dollies
were much better.
Before the new season got
under way there were even
changes in the yell leading line
ups. Ed Bordenkircher, who was
runncrup to Berk Johnston in the
election for Head Yell Leader last
spring, has taken over that post.
Johnston was suspended from the
University for an Honor Code vio
lation.
Cheer Leaders
Also a change was made in the
second-string cheer leaders. Walt
Jue replaced Greg Lawler, who
failed to obtain the minimum
number of grade points. The
other assistants are Bill Carr, Bob
Roberts and Don Skipworth.
Bordenkircher and his men
came clad as Roman gladiators
witli sheets wrapped around their
shoulders. One of the jokers ever
had a handful of grapes, making
like Julius Caesar.
After the game became a mas
sacre early in the second quarter,
the number of yells became few
and far between.
