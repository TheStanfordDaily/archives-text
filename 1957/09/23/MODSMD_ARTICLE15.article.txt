# Indians Bomb San Jose 46-7 in Debut
## Defensive Play Sparkles; Card Ball-Toters Run Wild Indians Prepare for Northwestern Against Weak Spartan Aggregation 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Four hard-running, defensive-minded Stanford football team:;
showed their respective wares against San Jose State and combined
to present Indian coach Chuck Taylor with a lopsided 1(» 7 opening
game victory Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards looked like almost-certain winners when the "contest"

nothing that happened during
the rest of the afternoon changed
that early impression as Stan
ford rolled to a 34-0 half-time
lead and then coasted in against
the outclassed Spartans.
For Taylor, it was a good op
portunity to see most of his men
in action. Each of the four
strings played almost-equal 1>
minute segments of the game a >
Taylor utilized the unit-substilu
tion plan.
Good Tackling
Hard and precision tackling
was the phase of Stanford's play
which drew the most interest.
Even in their years of great pa
ing attacks, the Indians have
been plagued with poor blocking
and tackling.
But S a t u rd a y the tackling
looked 100 per cent better than
last year's. The line charge was
also excellent, although this was
probably at least partly there
suit of a weak Spartan forward
wa'l.
The Tribe must have known
its defensive unit was primed fur
ths kill, because the Cards chose
to kick off even though they won
the pre-game doin toss.
Rig Loss
On San Jose's first play from
scrimmage, Armand DeWcese
plowed into the Spartan back
field and smacked down full
back Fred Blanco for a seven
yard loss. The Indians then re
lented slightly and let SJS pick
up three yards over guard.
On third-and-14', Spartan quar
terback Marv Mckean starter! to
roll to his right, looking for a
receiver. But he hadn't figured
on Noel Robinson hitting him
from behind for a 10-yard loss.
Don Manoukian, John Kidd,
Russ Steele, Joel Freis, Gary
Van Galder, DeWeese and Robin
son kept up that kind of play for
the 15 minutes they played
eight in the first period and sev
en in the second.
Shifting Defense

when the second • unit men got
into the fray. Stanford's con

THE HOLE OPENED — And Stanford rollback Dick C.iiids
thanked his iine for the favor by plowing into the San Jose end
zone for six points. Childs' plunge came just 23 seconds into the
fourth quarter, and gave the Indians a 40 0 bulge in Saturday's
feast. Center Pide Swanson (fourth Card from right), guard
George Ingham (to left of Siwanson), and tackle Dean Hinshaw

(to left of ingiiam) iaici toe oiorks wliicii let Childs hurdle into
scoring territory. The Stanford fourth-stringers, in action through
out. the final 15 minutes of the rout, outscored the Spartans, 12-7.
And this despite the fact that San Jose kept first-stringers in ac
tion through a good part of the final stanza.
