# Indians Bomb San Jose 46-7 in Debut
## Defensive Play Sparkles; Card Ball-Toters Run Wild Indians Prepare for Northwestern Against Weak Spartan Aggregation 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Four hard-running, defensive-minded Stanford football team:;
showed their respective wares against San Jose State and combined
to present Indian coach Chuck Taylor with a lopsided 1(» 7 opening
game victory Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards looked like almost-certain winners when the "contest"

nothing that happened during
the rest of the afternoon changed
that early impression as Stan
ford rolled to a 34-0 half-time
lead and then coasted in against
the outclassed Spartans.
For Taylor, it was a good op
portunity to see most of his men
in action. Each of the four
strings played almost-equal 1>
minute segments of the game a >
Taylor utilized the unit-substilu
tion plan.
Good Tackling
Hard and precision tackling
was the phase of Stanford's play
which drew the most interest.
Even in their years of great pa
ing attacks, the Indians have
been plagued with poor blocking
and tackling.
But S a t u rd a y the tackling
looked 100 per cent better than
last year's. The line charge was
also excellent, although this was
probably at least partly there
suit of a weak Spartan forward
wa'l.
The Tribe must have known
its defensive unit was primed fur
ths kill, because the Cards chose
to kick off even though they won
the pre-game doin toss.
Rig Loss
On San Jose's first play from
scrimmage, Armand DeWcese
plowed into the Spartan back
field and smacked down full
back Fred Blanco for a seven
yard loss. The Indians then re
lented slightly and let SJS pick
up three yards over guard.
On third-and-14', Spartan quar
terback Marv Mckean starter! to
roll to his right, looking for a
receiver. But he hadn't figured
on Noel Robinson hitting him
from behind for a 10-yard loss.
Don Manoukian, John Kidd,
Russ Steele, Joel Freis, Gary
Van Galder, DeWeese and Robin
son kept up that kind of play for
the 15 minutes they played
eight in the first period and sev
en in the second.
Shifting Defense
The story was no different
when the second • unit men got
into the fray. Stanford's con
stantly - shifting defense five,
six and even a close-packed eight
man line—kept the Spartans so
befuddled that they managed t.<
pick up a whole one yard rushim
in the initial 30 minutes,

THE HOLE OPENED — And Stanford rollback Dick C.iiids
thanked his iine for the favor by plowing into the San Jose end
zone for six points. Childs' plunge came just 23 seconds into the
fourth quarter, and gave the Indians a 40 0 bulge in Saturday's
feast. Center Pide Swanson (fourth Card from right), guard
George Ingham (to left of Siwanson), and tackle Dean Hinshaw

(to left of ingiiam) iaici toe oiorks wliicii let Childs hurdle into
scoring territory. The Stanford fourth-stringers, in action through
out. the final 15 minutes of the rout, outscored the Spartans, 12-7.
And this despite the fact that San Jose kept first-stringers in ac
tion through a good part of the final stanza.

game out of the reach of Bob
Tichenal's boys.
Valii Scores-
After San Jose's ill-fated first
series of plays, the Cards took
over on their own 17-yard line.
Fullback Lou Valli carried the
pigskin on eight of Ihe next 14
plays, with his eighth trip a two
yarder over tackle for the touch
down.
Twice, on third down, Valli
picked up four yards around end
to keep the locals out of fourth
down situations.
The play which really kept the
drive going was a 14-yard aerial
from quarterback Jackie Douglas
to end Joel Fries. Stanford was
in a third - and - nine spot, and
needed the yardage t<> keep alive.
Onslaught Starts
ft was almost 10 minutes be
fore the Indians hit the .score
board again, but then the ava
lanche started.
Ten plavs and 57 yards after
taking a San Jose punt, Stanford
hit pay-dirt. A pair of Douglas
12-yard passes, one to Jeri Me-
Miilin and the other to Van Gal
der, sparked the drive. A 1 Har
rington climaxed the effort by
jaunting six yards around end.
Four minutes later, Valli pro
duced the most spectacular of
fensive burst of the day when he
rumbled (JO yards to the Spartan
10. Ib 1 took off around 11is own
right end, and was on his way
when Harrington laid a crushing
block on an SJS defender.
( aught on 10
Valli hurdled another man, out
faked a pair along the west side
line and wasn't halted until Bob
Dunivant angled in on him at the
10.
Wbih 1 the Spartans were still
tuckered out from chasing Valli,
Douglas hit McMillin with a pass
which gave the Indians their
third TD. On the scoring play,
McMillin got clear in the end

7.one and made a beautiful leap
ing catch of Douglas' heave.
After four more minutes of
piay, San Jose finally got into
Stanford territory, thanks to a
Tribe fumble.
The Spartans didn't stay there
long as Marv McKean's first
down pass was picked off by
halfback Jackie Taylor and re
turned 67 yards down the side
line for another Indian six-point
er.
Tribe Converts
Taylor joined DeWeese and
Harrington as successful con
verters when he made the count
27-0 with the third PAT of the
game.
With less than two minutes to
go in the first half, Stanford cen
ter John Thomas got his big
chance to make the scoring col
umn. He alertly picked off a flat
pass, and was on his way to the
goal line when Spartan .Ray Nor
ton caught up to him. Thomas
tried to out - maneuver Norton,
but was downed on the SJS 15.
Being caught by Norton was no
disgrace, however, since he's run
the 100-yard dash in 9.4.
Nicolet to liobinson
The Cards capitalized on
Thomas' work two plays later
when sub quarterback Bob Nico
let spotted Ben Robinson all
alone in the end /.one and hit
him with an easy 14-yard pitch.
There was no scoring in the
third period, with Taylor's third
team holding the Spartans' first
unit in check, and vice versa.
Near the end of the Stanza, Sid
Garber began to move his club,
and the directed them to the SJS
12 before the gun sounded.
Fullback Dick Childs plunged
through center at 0:23 of the
fourth period as Taylor now had
practically ;ill fourth-stringers in
act ion.
SJS Finally Scores
San Jose, still using first-line
back field talent, at last managed
to score off the fourth Stanford
team. The final play of a 15-play
drive was a perfect 25-yard pass,
McKean to Jim Riley.
The day's scoring ended five
plays later, when A 1 Napoleon
went 28 yards off left tackle.
Something happened to the left
side of the Spartan secondary,
because Napoleon was in the
clear three yards past scrim
mage and never came close to .be
ing touched.
By and large, the Cards were a
running team Saturday. Forty
five of the G1 plays were on the
ground, resulting in a gain of 246
yards. Douglas completed five of
the 12 passes he attempted, and
would have had a better average

except for three straight which
misfired when the Indians tried
some check-off patterns which
didn't come off as planned.
103 Yards for Valii
Valli, of course, led the ground
parade with 103 yards for an B.G
average. His 12 carries in the
first half were three more than
the combined total for the rest
of the Stanford backs in that
opening 30 minutes.
As far as next week's intersec
tional with Northwestern is con
cerned, it's still a hard game to
figure. For the Wildcats, il will
be the season opener. For Stan
lord, it will be the first lest of
any proportion.
The Tribe looked great Satur
day, but as Taylor said after the
game, "It's all relative. Maybe
we look goof I this week against
San Jose and gel our ears pinned
back next week against North
western."

Tichenal's boys.
Valii Scores-
After San Jose's ill-fated first
series of plays, the Cards took
over on their own 17-yard line.
Fullback Lou Valli carried the
pigskin on eight of Ihe next 14
plays, with his eighth trip a two
yarder over tackle for the touch
down.
Twice, on third down, Valli
picked up four yards around end
to keep the locals out of fourth
down situations.
The play which really kept the
drive going was a 14-yard aerial
from quarterback Jackie Douglas
to end Joel Fries. Stanford was
in a third - and - nine spot, and
needed the yardage t<> keep alive.
Onslaught Starts
ft was almost 10 minutes be
fore the Indians hit the .score
board again, but then the ava
lanche started.
Ten plavs and 57 yards after
taking a San Jose punt, Stanford
hit pay-dirt. A pair of Douglas
12-yard passes, one to Jeri Me-
Miilin and the other to Van Gal
der, sparked the drive. A 1 Har
rington climaxed the effort by
jaunting six yards around end.
Four minutes later, Valli pro
duced the most spectacular of
fensive burst of the day when he
rumbled (JO yards to the Spartan
10. Ib 1 took off around 11is own
right end, and was on his way
when Harrington laid a crushing
block on an SJS defender.
( aught on 10
Valli hurdled another man, out
faked a pair along the west side
line and wasn't halted until Bob
Dunivant angled in on him at the
10.
Wbih 1 the Spartans were still
tuckered out from chasing Valli,
Douglas hit McMillin with a pass
which gave the Indians their
third TD. On the scoring play,
McMillin got clear in the end

7.one and made a beautiful leap
ing catch of Douglas' heave.
After four more minutes of
piay, San Jose finally got into
Stanford territory, thanks to a
Tribe fumble.
The Spartans didn't stay there
long as Marv McKean's first
down pass was picked off by
halfback Jackie Taylor and re
turned 67 yards down the side
line for another Indian six-point
er.
Tribe Converts
Taylor joined DeWeese and
Harrington as successful con
verters when he made the count
27-0 with the third PAT of the
game.
With less than two minutes to
go in the first half, Stanford cen
ter John Thomas got his big
chance to make the scoring col
umn. He alertly picked off a flat
pass, and was on his way to the
goal line when Spartan .Ray Nor
ton caught up to him. Thomas
tried to out - maneuver Norton,
but was downed on the SJS 15.
Being caught by Norton was no
disgrace, however, since he's run
the 100-yard dash in 9.4.
Nicolet to liobinson
The Cards capitalized on
Thomas' work two plays later
when sub quarterback Bob Nico
let spotted Ben Robinson all
alone in the end /.one and hit
him with an easy 14-yard pitch.
There was no scoring in the
third period, with Taylor's third
team holding the Spartans' first
unit in check, and vice versa.
Near the end of the Stanza, Sid
Garber began to move his club,
and the directed them to the SJS
12 before the gun sounded.
Fullback Dick Childs plunged
through center at 0:23 of the
fourth period as Taylor now had
practically ;ill fourth-stringers in
act ion.
SJS Finally Scores
San Jose, still using first-line
back field talent, at last managed
to score off the fourth Stanford
team. The final play of a 15-play
drive was a perfect 25-yard pass,
McKean to Jim Riley.
The day's scoring ended five
plays later, when A 1 Napoleon
went 28 yards off left tackle.
Something happened to the left
side of the Spartan secondary,
because Napoleon was in the
clear three yards past scrim
mage and never came close to .be
ing touched.
By and large, the Cards were a
running team Saturday. Forty
five of the G1 plays were on the
ground, resulting in a gain of 246
yards. Douglas completed five of
the 12 passes he attempted, and
would have had a better average

except for three straight which
misfired when the Indians tried
some check-off patterns which
didn't come off as planned.
103 Yards for Valii
Valli, of course, led the ground
parade with 103 yards for an B.G
average. His 12 carries in the
first half were three more than
the combined total for the rest
of the Stanford backs in that
opening 30 minutes.
As far as next week's intersec
tional with Northwestern is con
cerned, it's still a hard game to
figure. For the Wildcats, il will
be the season opener. For Stan
lord, it will be the first lest of
any proportion.
The Tribe looked great Satur
day, but as Taylor said after the
game, "It's all relative. Maybe
we look goof I this week against
San Jose and gel our ears pinned
back next week against North
western."

Four hard-running, defensive-minded Stanford football team:;
showed their respective wares against San Jose State and combined
to present Indian coach Chuck Taylor with a lopsided 1(» 7 opening

The Cards looked like almost-certain winners when the "contest"

nothing that happened during
the rest of the afternoon changed
that early impression as Stan

been plagued with poor blocking
and tackling.

to kick off even though they won
the pre-game doin toss.
Rig Loss
On San Jose's first play from
scrimmage, Armand DeWcese
plowed into the Spartan back
field and smacked down full
back Fred Blanco for a seven
yard loss. The Indians then re
lented slightly and let SJS pick
up three yards over guard.
On third-and-14', Spartan quar

on Noel Robinson hitting him
from behind for a 10-yard loss.

Taylor joined DeWeese and
Harrington as successful con
verters when he made the count
27-0 with the third PAT of the
game.
With less than two minutes to
go in the first half, Stanford cen
ter John Thomas got his big
chance to make the scoring col
umn. He alertly picked off a flat
pass, and was on his way to the
goal line when Spartan .Ray Nor
ton caught up to him. Thomas
tried to out - maneuver Norton,
but was downed on the SJS 15.
Being caught by Norton was no
disgrace, however, since he's run
the 100-yard dash in 9.4.
Nicolet to liobinson
The Cards capitalized on
Thomas' work two plays later
when sub quarterback Bob Nico
let spotted Ben Robinson all
alone in the end /.one and hit
him with an easy 14-yard pitch.
There was no scoring in the
third period, with Taylor's third
team holding the Spartans' first
unit in check, and vice versa.
Near the end of the Stanza, Sid
Garber began to move his club,
and the directed them to the SJS
12 before the gun sounded.
Fullback Dick Childs plunged
through center at 0:23 of the
fourth period as Taylor now had
practically ;ill fourth-stringers in
act ion.
SJS Finally Scores
San Jose, still using first-line
back field talent, at last managed
to score off the fourth Stanford
team. The final play of a 15-play
drive was a perfect 25-yard pass,
McKean to Jim Riley.
The day's scoring ended five
plays later, when A 1 Napoleon
went 28 yards off left tackle.
Something happened to the left
side of the Spartan secondary,
because Napoleon was in the
clear three yards past scrim
mage and never came close to .be
ing touched.
By and large, the Cards were a
running team Saturday. Forty
five of the G1 plays were on the
ground, resulting in a gain of 246
yards. Douglas completed five of
the 12 passes he attempted, and
would have had a better average

except for three straight which
misfired when the Indians tried
some check-off patterns which
didn't come off as planned.
103 Yards for Valii
Valli, of course, led the ground
parade with 103 yards for an B.G
average. His 12 carries in the
first half were three more than
the combined total for the rest
of the Stanford backs in that
opening 30 minutes.
As far as next week's intersec
tional with Northwestern is con
cerned, it's still a hard game to
figure. For the Wildcats, il will
be the season opener. For Stan
lord, it will be the first lest of
any proportion.
The Tribe looked great Satur
day, but as Taylor said after the
game, "It's all relative. Maybe
we look goof I this week against
San Jose and gel our ears pinned
back next week against North
western."

Four hard-running, defensive-minded Stanford football team:;
showed their respective wares against San Jose State and combined
to present Indian coach Chuck Taylor with a lopsided 1(» 7 opening
game victory Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards looked like almost-certain winners when the "contest"

nothing that happened during
the rest of the afternoon changed
that early impression as Stan
ford rolled to a 34-0 half-time
lead and then coasted in against
the outclassed Spartans.
For Taylor, it was a good op
portunity to see most of his men
in action. Each of the four
strings played almost-equal 1>
minute segments of the game a >
Taylor utilized the unit-substilu
tion plan.
Good Tackling
Hard and precision tackling
was the phase of Stanford's play
which drew the most interest.
Even in their years of great pa
ing attacks, the Indians have
been plagued with poor blocking
and tackling.
But S a t u rd a y the tackling
looked 100 per cent better than
last year's. The line charge was
also excellent, although this was
probably at least partly there
suit of a weak Spartan forward
wa'l.
The Tribe must have known
its defensive unit was primed fur
ths kill, because the Cards chose
to kick off even though they won
the pre-game doin toss.
Rig Loss
On San Jose's first play from
scrimmage, Armand DeWcese
plowed into the Spartan back
field and smacked down full
back Fred Blanco for a seven
yard loss. The Indians then re
lented slightly and let SJS pick
up three yards over guard.
On third-and-14', Spartan quar
terback Marv Mckean starter! to
roll to his right, looking for a
receiver. But he hadn't figured
on Noel Robinson hitting him
from behind for a 10-yard loss.
Don Manoukian, John Kidd,
Russ Steele, Joel Freis, Gary
Van Galder, DeWeese and Robin
son kept up that kind of play for
the 15 minutes they played
eight in the first period and sev
en in the second.
Shifting Defense

when the second • unit men got

Valii Scores-
After San Jose's ill-fated first
series of plays, the Cards took
over on their own 17-yard line.
Fullback Lou Valli carried the
pigskin on eight of Ihe next 14
plays, with his eighth trip a two
yarder over tackle for the touch
down.
Twice, on third down, Valli
picked up four yards around end
to keep the locals out of fourth
down situations.
The play which really kept the
drive going was a 14-yard aerial
from quarterback Jackie Douglas
to end Joel Fries. Stanford was
in a third - and - nine spot, and
needed the yardage t<> keep alive.
Onslaught Starts
ft was almost 10 minutes be

Ten plavs and 57 yards after
taking a San Jose punt, Stanford
hit pay-dirt. A pair of Douglas
12-yard passes, one to Jeri Me-
Miilin and the other to Van Gal
der, sparked the drive. A 1 Har
rington climaxed the effort by
jaunting six yards around end.
Four minutes later, Valli pro
duced the most spectacular of
fensive burst of the day when he
rumbled (JO yards to the Spartan
10. Ib 1 took off around 11is own
right end, and was on his way
when Harrington laid a crushing
block on an SJS defender.
( aught on 10
Valli hurdled another man, out
faked a pair along the west side
line and wasn't halted until Bob
Dunivant angled in on him at the
10.
Wbih 1 the Spartans were still
tuckered out from chasing Valli,
Douglas hit McMillin with a pass
which gave the Indians their
third TD. On the scoring play,
McMillin got clear in the end

7.one and made a beautiful leap
ing catch of Douglas' heave.
After four more minutes of
piay, San Jose finally got into
Stanford territory, thanks to a
Tribe fumble.
The Spartans didn't stay there
long as Marv McKean's first
down pass was picked off by
halfback Jackie Taylor and re
turned 67 yards down the side
line for another Indian six-point
er.

Four hard-running, defensive-minded Stanford football team:;
showed their respective wares against San Jose State and combined
to present Indian coach Chuck Taylor with a lopsided 1(» 7 opening
game victory Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards looked like almost-certain winners when the "contest"

nothing that happened during
the rest of the afternoon changed
that early impression as Stan
ford rolled to a 34-0 half-time
lead and then coasted in against
the outclassed Spartans.
For Taylor, it was a good op
portunity to see most of his men
in action. Each of the four
strings played almost-equal 1>
minute segments of the game a >
Taylor utilized the unit-substilu
tion plan.
Good Tackling
Hard and precision tackling
was the phase of Stanford's play
which drew the most interest.
Even in their years of great pa
ing attacks, the Indians have
been plagued with poor blocking
and tackling.
But S a t u rd a y the tackling
looked 100 per cent better than
last year's. The line charge was
also excellent, although this was
probably at least partly there
suit of a weak Spartan forward
wa'l.
The Tribe must have known
its defensive unit was primed fur
ths kill, because the Cards chose
to kick off even though they won
the pre-game doin toss.
Rig Loss
On San Jose's first play from
scrimmage, Armand DeWcese
plowed into the Spartan back
field and smacked down full
back Fred Blanco for a seven
yard loss. The Indians then re
lented slightly and let SJS pick
up three yards over guard.
On third-and-14', Spartan quar
terback Marv Mckean starter! to
roll to his right, looking for a
receiver. But he hadn't figured
on Noel Robinson hitting him
from behind for a 10-yard loss.
Don Manoukian, John Kidd,
Russ Steele, Joel Freis, Gary
Van Galder, DeWeese and Robin
son kept up that kind of play for
the 15 minutes they played
eight in the first period and sev
en in the second.
Shifting Defense
The story was no different
when the second • unit men got
into the fray. Stanford's con
stantly - shifting defense five,
six and even a close-packed eight

befuddled that they managed t.<

game out of the reach of Bob
Tichenal's boys.
Valii Scores-
After San Jose's ill-fated first
series of plays, the Cards took
over on their own 17-yard line.
Fullback Lou Valli carried the
pigskin on eight of Ihe next 14
plays, with his eighth trip a two
yarder over tackle for the touch
down.
Twice, on third down, Valli
picked up four yards around end
to keep the locals out of fourth
down situations.
The play which really kept the
drive going was a 14-yard aerial
from quarterback Jackie Douglas
to end Joel Fries. Stanford was
in a third - and - nine spot, and
needed the yardage t<> keep alive.
Onslaught Starts
ft was almost 10 minutes be
fore the Indians hit the .score
board again, but then the ava
lanche started.
Ten plavs and 57 yards after
taking a San Jose punt, Stanford
hit pay-dirt. A pair of Douglas
12-yard passes, one to Jeri Me-
Miilin and the other to Van Gal
der, sparked the drive. A 1 Har
rington climaxed the effort by
jaunting six yards around end.
Four minutes later, Valli pro
duced the most spectacular of
fensive burst of the day when he
rumbled (JO yards to the Spartan
10. Ib 1 took off around 11is own
right end, and was on his way
when Harrington laid a crushing
block on an SJS defender.
( aught on 10
Valli hurdled another man, out
faked a pair along the west side
line and wasn't halted until Bob
Dunivant angled in on him at the
10.
Wbih 1 the Spartans were still
tuckered out from chasing Valli,
Douglas hit McMillin with a pass
which gave the Indians their
third TD. On the scoring play,
McMillin got clear in the end

7.one and made a beautiful leap
ing catch of Douglas' heave.
After four more minutes of
piay, San Jose finally got into
Stanford territory, thanks to a
Tribe fumble.
The Spartans didn't stay there
long as Marv McKean's first
down pass was picked off by
halfback Jackie Taylor and re
turned 67 yards down the side
line for another Indian six-point
er.
Tribe Converts
Taylor joined DeWeese and
Harrington as successful con
verters when he made the count
27-0 with the third PAT of the
game.
With less than two minutes to
go in the first half, Stanford cen
ter John Thomas got his big
chance to make the scoring col
umn. He alertly picked off a flat
pass, and was on his way to the
goal line when Spartan .Ray Nor
ton caught up to him. Thomas
tried to out - maneuver Norton,
but was downed on the SJS 15.
Being caught by Norton was no
disgrace, however, since he's run
the 100-yard dash in 9.4.
Nicolet to liobinson
The Cards capitalized on
Thomas' work two plays later
when sub quarterback Bob Nico
let spotted Ben Robinson all
alone in the end /.one and hit
him with an easy 14-yard pitch.
There was no scoring in the
third period, with Taylor's third
team holding the Spartans' first
unit in check, and vice versa.
Near the end of the Stanza, Sid
Garber began to move his club,
and the directed them to the SJS
12 before the gun sounded.
Fullback Dick Childs plunged
through center at 0:23 of the
fourth period as Taylor now had
practically ;ill fourth-stringers in
act ion.
SJS Finally Scores
San Jose, still using first-line
back field talent, at last managed
to score off the fourth Stanford
team. The final play of a 15-play
drive was a perfect 25-yard pass,
McKean to Jim Riley.
The day's scoring ended five
plays later, when A 1 Napoleon
went 28 yards off left tackle.
Something happened to the left
side of the Spartan secondary,
because Napoleon was in the
clear three yards past scrim
mage and never came close to .be
ing touched.
By and large, the Cards were a
running team Saturday. Forty
five of the G1 plays were on the
ground, resulting in a gain of 246
yards. Douglas completed five of
the 12 passes he attempted, and
would have had a better average

except for three straight which
misfired when the Indians tried
some check-off patterns which
didn't come off as planned.
103 Yards for Valii
Valli, of course, led the ground
parade with 103 yards for an B.G
average. His 12 carries in the
first half were three more than
the combined total for the rest
of the Stanford backs in that
opening 30 minutes.
As far as next week's intersec
tional with Northwestern is con
cerned, it's still a hard game to
figure. For the Wildcats, il will
be the season opener. For Stan
lord, it will be the first lest of
any proportion.
The Tribe looked great Satur
day, but as Taylor said after the
game, "It's all relative. Maybe
we look goof I this week against
San Jose and gel our ears pinned
back next week against North
western."

game out of the reach of Bob
Tichenal's boys.
Valii Scores-
After San Jose's ill-fated first
series of plays, the Cards took
over on their own 17-yard line.
Fullback Lou Valli carried the
pigskin on eight of Ihe next 14
plays, with his eighth trip a two
yarder over tackle for the touch
down.
Twice, on third down, Valli
picked up four yards around end
to keep the locals out of fourth
down situations.
The play which really kept the
drive going was a 14-yard aerial
from quarterback Jackie Douglas
to end Joel Fries. Stanford was
in a third - and - nine spot, and
needed the yardage t<> keep alive.
Onslaught Starts
ft was almost 10 minutes be
fore the Indians hit the .score
board again, but then the ava
lanche started.
Ten plavs and 57 yards after
taking a San Jose punt, Stanford
hit pay-dirt. A pair of Douglas
12-yard passes, one to Jeri Me-
Miilin and the other to Van Gal
der, sparked the drive. A 1 Har
rington climaxed the effort by
jaunting six yards around end.
Four minutes later, Valli pro
duced the most spectacular of
fensive burst of the day when he
rumbled (JO yards to the Spartan
10. Ib 1 took off around 11is own
right end, and was on his way
when Harrington laid a crushing
block on an SJS defender.
( aught on 10
Valli hurdled another man, out
faked a pair along the west side
line and wasn't halted until Bob
Dunivant angled in on him at the
10.
Wbih 1 the Spartans were still
tuckered out from chasing Valli,
Douglas hit McMillin with a pass
which gave the Indians their
third TD. On the scoring play,
McMillin got clear in the end

7.one and made a beautiful leap
ing catch of Douglas' heave.
After four more minutes of
piay, San Jose finally got into
Stanford territory, thanks to a
Tribe fumble.
The Spartans didn't stay there
long as Marv McKean's first
down pass was picked off by
halfback Jackie Taylor and re
turned 67 yards down the side
line for another Indian six-point
er.
Tribe Converts
Taylor joined DeWeese and
Harrington as successful con
verters when he made the count
27-0 with the third PAT of the
game.
With less than two minutes to
go in the first half, Stanford cen
ter John Thomas got his big
chance to make the scoring col
umn. He alertly picked off a flat
pass, and was on his way to the
goal line when Spartan .Ray Nor
ton caught up to him. Thomas
tried to out - maneuver Norton,
but was downed on the SJS 15.
Being caught by Norton was no
disgrace, however, since he's run
the 100-yard dash in 9.4.
Nicolet to liobinson
The Cards capitalized on
Thomas' work two plays later
when sub quarterback Bob Nico
let spotted Ben Robinson all
alone in the end /.one and hit
him with an easy 14-yard pitch.
There was no scoring in the
third period, with Taylor's third
team holding the Spartans' first
unit in check, and vice versa.
Near the end of the Stanza, Sid
Garber began to move his club,
and the directed them to the SJS
12 before the gun sounded.
Fullback Dick Childs plunged
through center at 0:23 of the
fourth period as Taylor now had
practically ;ill fourth-stringers in
act ion.
SJS Finally Scores
San Jose, still using first-line
back field talent, at last managed
to score off the fourth Stanford
team. The final play of a 15-play
drive was a perfect 25-yard pass,
McKean to Jim Riley.
The day's scoring ended five
plays later, when A 1 Napoleon
went 28 yards off left tackle.
Something happened to the left
side of the Spartan secondary,
because Napoleon was in the
clear three yards past scrim
mage and never came close to .be
ing touched.
By and large, the Cards were a
running team Saturday. Forty
five of the G1 plays were on the
ground, resulting in a gain of 246
yards. Douglas completed five of
the 12 passes he attempted, and
would have had a better average

except for three straight which
misfired when the Indians tried
some check-off patterns which
didn't come off as planned.
103 Yards for Valii
Valli, of course, led the ground
parade with 103 yards for an B.G
average. His 12 carries in the
first half were three more than
the combined total for the rest
of the Stanford backs in that
opening 30 minutes.
As far as next week's intersec
tional with Northwestern is con
cerned, it's still a hard game to
figure. For the Wildcats, il will
be the season opener. For Stan
lord, it will be the first lest of
any proportion.
The Tribe looked great Satur
day, but as Taylor said after the
game, "It's all relative. Maybe
we look goof I this week against
San Jose and gel our ears pinned
back next week against North
western."

Four hard-running, defensive-minded Stanford football team:;
showed their respective wares against San Jose State and combined
to present Indian coach Chuck Taylor with a lopsided 1(» 7 opening
game victory Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards looked like almost-certain winners when the "contest"

nothing that happened during
the rest of the afternoon changed
that early impression as Stan
ford rolled to a 34-0 half-time
lead and then coasted in against
the outclassed Spartans.
For Taylor, it was a good op
portunity to see most of his men
in action. Each of the four
strings played almost-equal 1>
minute segments of the game a >
Taylor utilized the unit-substilu
tion plan.
Good Tackling
Hard and precision tackling
was the phase of Stanford's play
which drew the most interest.
Even in their years of great pa
ing attacks, the Indians have
been plagued with poor blocking
and tackling.
But S a t u rd a y the tackling
looked 100 per cent better than
last year's. The line charge was
also excellent, although this was
probably at least partly there
suit of a weak Spartan forward
wa'l.
The Tribe must have known
its defensive unit was primed fur
ths kill, because the Cards chose
to kick off even though they won
the pre-game doin toss.
Rig Loss
On San Jose's first play from
scrimmage, Armand DeWcese
plowed into the Spartan back
field and smacked down full
back Fred Blanco for a seven
yard loss. The Indians then re
lented slightly and let SJS pick
up three yards over guard.
On third-and-14', Spartan quar
terback Marv Mckean starter! to
roll to his right, looking for a
receiver. But he hadn't figured
on Noel Robinson hitting him
from behind for a 10-yard loss.
Don Manoukian, John Kidd,
Russ Steele, Joel Freis, Gary
Van Galder, DeWeese and Robin
son kept up that kind of play for
the 15 minutes they played
eight in the first period and sev
