# A 						Statement of Policy
## 
### 
At THE BEGINNING of each volume it is tradi
tional for the new editorial board to declare
the policy under which The Daily will operate
for the forthcoming volume. We should like,
at this time, to state our policy.
We believe there are two reasons for the
existence of a campus newspaper. The first
reason is for the benefit, the edification, of
those students who are willing to give of their
time and ell'ort to put forth a newspaper lor
the campus- one of high quality, journalis
ticullv: one of high readership-interest to stu
dents and one which follows closely the lines
of decency and true journalistic ethics.
The second reason for the existence of a
campus newspaper is to inform, advise and
educate the student body. Through our news
stories we hope to inform: through our features
we hope to educate, and through our columns
and editorials we try to advise. This, then, is
the function of The Stanford Daily as we see it.
We believe it to be our duty — nay, our
pleasure—to help the student become as well
informed on local, campus events as it is pos
sible, for we realize the importance of the
medium we direct.
We believe, also, it is our duty and our
pleasure to help to inform the student on tin'

current events which occur in the world outside
of our Stanford community, for many students
have access to no other journal except The
Daily.
We are an official organ of the Associated
Students of Stanford University and we are
proud to he such. To our elected student gov
eminent we have an obligation to uphold. But,
to the everlasting credit of the student body,
it is an obligation frcelv given and not forced
upon us.
We have an obligation to the University also.
But, also to the everlasting credit of tin* ad
ministration, it is an obligation freely given
and not forced upon,us.
Unfortunately, this is a rare situation on the
campuses of America. And, because we are one
of the few trulv free campus journals, we feel
most strong!) the responsibility laid upon our
shoulders.
There are times when we will not live up to
the students' conception of a true campus news
paper. We are not perfect. But we shall, in
every wav, endeavor to make The Stanford
Daily a newspaper the student body can be
proud of.
After all, that's our job, isn't il?

ministration, it is an obligation freely given
and not forced upon,us.
Unfortunately, this is a rare situation on the
campuses of America. And, because we are one
of the few trulv free campus journals, we feel
most strong!) the responsibility laid upon our
shoulders.
There are times when we will not live up to
the students' conception of a true campus news
paper. We are not perfect. But we shall, in
every wav, endeavor to make The Stanford
Daily a newspaper the student body can be
proud of.
After all, that's our job, isn't il?
At THE BEGINNING of each volume it is tradi
tional for the new editorial board to declare
the policy under which The Daily will operate
for the forthcoming volume. We should like,
at this time, to state our policy.
We believe there are two reasons for the
existence of a campus newspaper. The first
reason is for the benefit, the edification, of
those students who are willing to give of their
time and ell'ort to put forth a newspaper lor
the campus- one of high quality, journalis
ticullv: one of high readership-interest to stu
dents and one which follows closely the lines
of decency and true journalistic ethics.
The second reason for the existence of a
campus newspaper is to inform, advise and
educate the student body. Through our news
stories we hope to inform: through our features
we hope to educate, and through our columns
and editorials we try to advise. This, then, is
the function of The Stanford Daily as we see it.
We believe it to be our duty — nay, our
pleasure—to help the student become as well
informed on local, campus events as it is pos
sible, for we realize the importance of the
medium we direct.
We believe, also, it is our duty and our
pleasure to help to inform the student on tin'

current events which occur in the world outside
of our Stanford community, for many students
have access to no other journal except The
Daily.
We are an official organ of the Associated
Students of Stanford University and we are
proud to he such. To our elected student gov
eminent we have an obligation to uphold. But,
to the everlasting credit of the student body,
it is an obligation frcelv given and not forced
upon us.
We have an obligation to the University also.
But, also to the everlasting credit of tin* ad
ministration, it is an obligation freely given
