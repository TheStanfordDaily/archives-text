# Atomic Test Blast Expected Today

### 
ATOMIC TEST SITE, Nov. f/P)
The Atomic Energy Commis
sion said yesterday weather con
ditions appeared favorable for
firing the oft-postponed nuclear
test shot "Whitney" early today.
The shot, which is to be deto
nated from a 500-foot tower, was
subject to its ninth delay yester
day. Scientists said that if it had
been fired, winds might have
dropped fallout on Beatty, La
throp, Wells and Pahrump, Nev.
The test is described as some
what over half of nominal in
yield. Nominal is the equivalent
of 20,000 tons of TNT.
Meanwhile, a bigger shot which
had been tentatively scheduled for
today will be delayed for techni
cal reasons. This one, above nom
inal'in yield, will be set off from
a balloon tethered 1500 feet over
Yucca Flatâ€”when it is ready. It
has the code name "Charleston."
The next shot will be No. 22 in
the current test series.
Both the Whitney and Charles
ton shots will be closed to news
men.
