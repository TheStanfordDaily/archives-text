# Freshmen Frolic

### 
Freshmen —Class of '61 —danced, square-danced, frolicked an<l jol
lied at Saturday night's Jolly-up. Swaying softly <o the sweet
strains of the Stardusters of Spike Lynch, the frosh men wasted
little time in doing their best to make the best of the ltutio. Soon
after the beginning' of the festivities: there were almost no single
girls to be seen anywhere. Those hardy freshmen and pre-reg mem
bers who didn't have to be home by midnight stayed around after
the Stardusters had finished "Stardust" to New Yorker and Bop
to some mighty fine Dixie.
