# Engineer Perfects Electronic Tube
## 
### 
A new electronic tube that per
mits instantaneous radar tuning
over a great range of frequencies
has been developed by Professor
Dean A. Wat kins of the electrical
engineering department.
The "helitron" tube is simpler,
easier to build and uses power
Ave times more efficiently than
previous tubes, ft is a slim glass
vacuum tube about one foot long.
The lube employs an electron
beam, has a stainless steel and
molybdenum inner structure and
an insulator core of four sapphire
rods.
Besides radar, the helitron tube
has other potential uses in FM,
UHF ami color television, aircraft
communications and radio tele
phone systems.
Research was supported by the
Office of Naval Research, U.S.
Air Force and U.S. Army Signal
Corps.
