## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (/P) A Na
tionalist. Chinese delegate last
night said he expected the UN
General Assembly would shelve
the issue/ of seating Red China
again today by a vote of more
than two-thirds.
The 82-nation Assembly will
take up this afternoon a U.S. res
olution on the subject recom
mended by its steering committee.
The resolution would have the
Assembly (1) reject India's re
quest for inclusion of the Chinese
question in its 1957 agenda and
(2) decide to consider no pro
posals this year to exclude Na
tionalist or scat Communist Chi
nese representatives.
Indian Defense Minister V. K.
Krishna Menon will speak against
the resolution. Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko is ex
pected to do likewise. U.S. dele
gate Henry Cabot Lodge will
speak for it.
K. W. Yu, minister in the Chi
nese permanent delegation, pre
dicted the committee's recommen
dation would win. Seven or- eight
nations are expected to abstain.
"Our calculation," Yu told a re
porter, "is that we will get at
least two-thirds—maybe over 50
votes."
A similar resolution against
Communist China last Nov. 16
fell one vote short of two-thirds.
It passed, 47-24, with eight ab
stentions.
Yu said Nationalist China was
encouraged that in the Assem
bly's election of eight vice presi
dents last Wednesday, China got
61 votes—l 4 more than last. year.
He said that was "way beyond our
expectations."
A U.S. delegation source said
of today's vote: "We are quite
confident of the result. We feel
we have a good case. We feel our
friends are witli us."
