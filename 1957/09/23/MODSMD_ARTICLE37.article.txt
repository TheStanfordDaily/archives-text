# ‘DEAR WALLY’
## Omnipresent Warren Wonka Turns Up in Sterling's Files 
### Rich Brown 
A decade ago Kilroy was every
where.
Since 1948, however, a new
character—Warren G. Wonka—
has macfe his appearance every
where, from a royal reception for
a king and a queen in Athens,
Greece, to an auto accident at
Klamath Falls, Ore.
The mythical Stanford person
ality's latest visit (or at least his
latest discovered visit) was to the
home of none other than Presi
dent J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Recently Stanford's chief exec
utive was sorting through some
of his papers when he came upon
one with a date of May 2(i, 1951.
The return address read "222 Di
vine, Hadacol, Mississippi."
Trying to recall when he had
read the letter, Sterling glanced
a second time and read the con
tents:
"Dear Wally:
"Just wanted to prove it could
still be done. We were careful not
to disturb or harm anything (bet
ter watch those diplomas!). En
closed please find one used paint

brush. We missed you in eh inch.
"Reverently yours,
"Warren G. Wonka"
Mystery Remains
Whether the famous Watson
ville Traveler, as he is also known,
made a personal appearance in
Sterling's house or just slipped
the letter among Sterling's papers
somewhere else will probably al
ways remain a mystery.
The used paintbrush, inciden
tally, was not found.
Wonka was born full-grown in
a 1948 Chaparral as a bra sales
man. The name caught on as a
Chappie monicker whenever a
false name was needed and was
soon adopted by the campus for
the same purpose .
One of the most famous Wonka
incidents occurred in May 1952
when Estes Kefauver was touring
California in hopes of securing
the Democratic presidential nomi
nation. A Farm student contrib
uted to the campaign fund in
Wonka's name.
Estes Grateful
Sometime later a letter address
ed to Warren G. Wonka Jr., Toyon
Hall, and signed "Estes Kefau
ver." thanked Wonka:
"1 just wanted to tell you how
much I appreciate all you are
doing for me out there. I surely
did enjoy my visit, and I'll be in
California again very soon. I
hope to see you and thank you
personally for your assistance."
A Chappie staff member, using
Wonka's name, once filled out a
blue card for a Western Civ class
and took the mid-term and final.
All went well until the University
couldn't find a transcript . on
which to record the "B minus"
grade.
As early as 1948, Wonka had
registered for the draft, and in
1950 only the sharp eyes of a
proofreader kept Warren's name
off the commencement program.
Wonka "narrowly escaped seri

ous injury,'" the Associated Press \
reported Oct. 26, 1951, "in an auto j
accident near Klamath Falls,
Ore."
Seems that a car with six Stan- j
ford Band members, going to the 1
University of Washington game,
skidded off an embankment, j
When police took the names of
those in the accident, one student
didn't want to worry his parents
—so guess whose name he gave.

Since that one student listed
his home town as Watsonville,
Calif., the Watsonville Register-
Pajaronian ran the story on page
one.
In Greece, the Athens News,
three years ago, ran a list of VlP's
attending a royal party. At the
bottom of the list, which included
ambassadors and .military brass,
was—you guessed it—Mr. Warren
G. Wonka.

Wonka has been a write-in can
didate at many ASSU elections
and has been included among the
| Immortal 21 who recaptured the
| Stanford Axe in 1930. He even
wrote a letter which was pub
lished to the editor of Collier's
; Magazine.
All that is needed now is a Mrs,
i Wonka. Perhaps one of these
days she will turn up at a tea
I given by Mrs. Sterling.
