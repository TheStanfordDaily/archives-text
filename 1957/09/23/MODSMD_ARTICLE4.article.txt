# New ABC Act to Crack Down on ID
## Law Calls for $100 Fine for Possession Of False Identification 
### 
A $100 fine for the possession
of any written, printed or photo
stat evidence of age and identity
whk'h is false has been incorpo
rated into the California Alcoholic
Beverage Control Act.
According to the act, any per
son under 21 is a minor and it is
a misdemeanor for that person to
purchase any alcoholic beverage,
enter any establishment where
there is a "No persons under 21
allowed" sign posted, consume al
cohol on any street or highway
or in a public place, or possess or
present false identification.
Furnishing a minor with false
evidence of age and identity is a
misdemeanor punishable by a
$500 fine or six months' imprison
ment.
In the past the Department of
Alcoholic Beverages Control has
usually turned first-offense stu
dent liquor violators from Stan
ford over to the Student Judicial
Coit ncil.
The ABC's willingness to turn
spot arrests over to the Univer
sity is dependent on the coopera
tion of the violator.
Cooperation is defined as no
violence, giving proper and truth
ful identifcation, and assistance
in identifying any licensees who
may have sold alcoholic beverages
to minors.
In the case of Stanford students,
persons turned over to the Judi
cial Council are usually judged
to have been behaving contrary
to the spirit of the Fundamental
Standard.
A report of the council's action
is given to the ABC to enable it
to close the ease and to the Dean's
Office for use in counseling.
No council action ever affects a
student's permanent record, nor
is the information released by the
Dean's Office for any reason.
In order that the state laws re
garding minors and liquor will be
observed at Stanford, the Board
of Trustees has banned liquor
from campus.
