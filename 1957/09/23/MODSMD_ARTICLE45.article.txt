# San Jose Trouncing No Treat As Freshmen See Just Football
## Dog-Eared Card Stunts, Prat-fall, Ivy League Band Won't Look Good on National Television 
### Steve Baffrey 
Every other year the incoming
class of freshmen are treated to
a football game as part of their
pre-reg activities. This year,
though, it is hardly fair to call
this excursion a treat. But Tom
Decker and the pre-reg commit
tee are not to blame.
Opening game is usually a col
orful and exciting affair. Satur
day's scrimmage against San
Jose, however, was its drab as
the Army's old shade 43.
What happened in the plan
ning rooms will remain a mys
tery, no doubt; if there were even
planning rooms to hide a mys
tery. No card stunts, no cheer
ing, no excitement no fun.
Light l oot Promoted
Certainly it wasn't a slam-bang
opening as far as the local show
men were concerned. Only Chief
Lightfoot, newly promoted to his
chiefdom, and five attractive
pompon girls displayed ihe color
which old-timers remember from
earlier games.
"Where are the bellboys?" was
the cry ushered from press row
as the freshman band paraded
into the stands dressed casually
in polished cotton slacks and Ivy
League shirts. Stanford and San
Jose fans alike seemed to miss
ihe bright red costumes from
days of yore. Many shuddered at
the thought of sitting through an
entertainment-less half-time.
But when half - time finally

! came, all was not lost, for the
; gang from down the Peninsula i
did attempt a good show. But
the only "A" they'll get is foi
: effort, not for production.
After waiting until the first j
' half was over before handing out ,
J cards, the Staters found that I
I there was only time to do one (or
was it two?) of their planned
j card stunts. An'd these were un- j
! imaginative and illegible when:
they finally did come off.
Still, the Staters have started :
a new trend in card stunts. 1 did-!
n't quite catch whether they
called it "frayed-" or "fringed- j
i edge," but it was one of the two. j
It seems that by that point in the;
I g«jme not enough of the Staters)
I had enough fortitude to stay for j
the rest of the slaughter.
Wlmt a Fall!
Twenty-six thousand fans were,
on hand to watch the 46-7 rout,
and the most disgusting part of
the whole thing was that that
was all they did get to see, unless
i they caught a most graceful prat-
I fall executed by an SJS song
leader shortly before the game
I started.
As if enough of the San Jose
ans hadn't left by the end of the
qurter, the Childs buck over
cenler with 23 seconds gone in
the final quarter drove all but
the die-hards from the shadowed
side of ihe bowl. SJS attendance
at the final gun numbered ap
proximately 500.

Twenty-six thousand fans were,
on hand to watch the 46-7 rout,
and the most disgusting part of
the whole thing was that that
was all they did get to see, unless
i they caught a most graceful prat-
I fall executed by an SJS song
leader shortly before the game
I started.
As if enough of the San Jose
ans hadn't left by the end of the
qurter, the Childs buck over
cenler with 23 seconds gone in
the final quarter drove all but
the die-hards from the shadowed
side of ihe bowl. SJS attendance
at the final gun numbered ap
proximately 500.
Every other year the incoming
class of freshmen are treated to
a football game as part of their
pre-reg activities. This year,
though, it is hardly fair to call
this excursion a treat. But Tom
Decker and the pre-reg commit
tee are not to blame.
Opening game is usually a col
orful and exciting affair. Satur
day's scrimmage against San
Jose, however, was its drab as
the Army's old shade 43.
What happened in the plan
ning rooms will remain a mys
tery, no doubt; if there were even
planning rooms to hide a mys
tery. No card stunts, no cheer
ing, no excitement no fun.
Light l oot Promoted
Certainly it wasn't a slam-bang
opening as far as the local show
men were concerned. Only Chief
Lightfoot, newly promoted to his
chiefdom, and five attractive
pompon girls displayed ihe color
which old-timers remember from
earlier games.
"Where are the bellboys?" was
the cry ushered from press row
as the freshman band paraded
into the stands dressed casually
in polished cotton slacks and Ivy
League shirts. Stanford and San
Jose fans alike seemed to miss
ihe bright red costumes from
days of yore. Many shuddered at
the thought of sitting through an
entertainment-less half-time.
But when half - time finally

did attempt a good show. But
the only "A" they'll get is foi
: effort, not for production.
After waiting until the first j
' half was over before handing out ,
J cards, the Staters found that I
I there was only time to do one (or
was it two?) of their planned

they finally did come off.
Still, the Staters have started :
a new trend in card stunts. 1 did-!
