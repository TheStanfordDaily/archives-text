### Associated Press 
The names are different, hut
the setting is the same. Okla
homa, the Goliath of college loot
ball, appears headed for another
perfect season and a third
straight national championship.
Without their brilliant one-two
punch of 1956, Jimmy Harris and
Tommy McDonald, the Sooriers
launched the new campaign Sat
urday in Pittsburgh with no ap
parent slack in their, awesome de
structive force. They rolled to an
easy 26-0 triumph—which might
have been greater except for 135
yards in penalties—for their 41st
straight victory since early 1953.
While Oklahoma was stamping
itself as the likely No. 1 power
of 1957, three strong rivals for
that honor also were making im
pressive starts.
Georgia Tech, fourth in the
final Associated Press poll last
year, found a signal-calling gold
mine in sophomore quarterback
Fred Brazelton, anil beat Ken
tucky 13-0. Texas A&M won, 21-
13, over Maryland, with Roddy
Osborne playing a standout role.
And Oregon State's defending
Pacific Coast champions toppled
Southern California, 20-0.
Houston, which in recent years
has grown into a football power,
stunned the University of Miami,
Fla., the nation's sixth ranked
team last year, 7-0. North Caro
lina State for the second straight
year spoiled coach Jim Tatum's
opening at North Carolina, 7-0.
