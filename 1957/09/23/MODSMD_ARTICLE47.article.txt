LONDON (/P)- U.S. Air Force
planes searching the stormy mid-
Atlantic reported last night they
had spotted two lifeboats and one
raft but no sign of the battered
German bark Pamir or any sur
vivors.
The four-masted sailing ship,
carrying a crew of about 90 and
a cargo of barley (in a voyage
from Buenos Aires to Hamburg,
was caught Saturday in hurricane
Carrie about 600 miles west of
the Azores, and radioed that she
was sinking.
Itaft Identified
The raft spotted by Ihe Ameri
can airmen carried the word
"Luebeck" the West German
city where the 3102-ton ship was

I
registered. The raft and the life
boats were empty.
Zerssen & Co., in Luebeck,
which has operated the Pamir as
I a grain carrier and training ship
for the German shipping industry
and the government foundation
which owned her, said the Pamir
carried 86 Germans officers, sai
lors and maritime cadets — an
Austrian cadet and a German sea
author, Capt. Fred Schmidt.
Skilled Skipper
The skipper, Capt. Johann Die
bitsch, 61, was considered a re
sourceful shipmaster, and sea
farers along West Germany's
coast were holding tightly to the
hope he might have brought the
Pamir through.
U.S. Air Force headquarters
here said rescue planes based on
the Azores would keep up their
j search despite difficult weather
! conditions.
Search Goes On
Search planes of the U.S. Air
i Rescue Service and five large

Tho Portuguese Air Force also
! sent out an amphibious plane.
But it was emphasized here that
discovery of the raft and the Itfe- j
boals does not necessarily mean i
the crew of the Pamir had been j
! forced to use them.
