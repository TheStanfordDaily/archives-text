FOOTBALL THROUGH THE AGES
The football frenzy is upon us. But let us in the midst
of this pandemonium call time. Let us pause for a moment
of tranquil reflection. What is this great American game
called football? What is its history? Its origins?
First of all, to call football an American game is some
what misleading. True, the game is now played almost
exclusively in America, but it comes to us from a land
far away and a, civilization long dead.
Football was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced
by Julius Caesar, it became one of the most popular
Roman sports by the time of Nero's reign. The eminent
historian, Sigafoos, reports a crowd of MMCLDDXYIII
people at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon to see
the Christians play the Lions.
With the decline of the Roman empire, football fell
into disuse. The barbaric Huns and Visigoths preferred
canasta. Not until the fifteenth century A. 1). did foot
ball emerge from its twilight and rise to ita rightful place
in the firmament of European sports.
Which brings us to September 29, 1442, a date dear to
the hearts of nil football fans. It was on this date, accord
ing to the eminent historian Sigafoos, that a sixteen-year
<Hd lad named Christopher Columbus tried out for the
football team ;it (lenoa Tech. He failed to make the team
because Ik; was too light. (lie weighed at the time only
twelve pounds.)
And why, you ask, is this date—September 21), 1442—
so dear to the hearts of all football fans? Because young
Columbus was so heartbroken at not making the team
that he ran away to sea. And if that hadn't happened,
he never would have discovered America. And if Columbus
hadn't discovered America, the world would never have
discovered tobacco. And if the world hadn't discovered
tobacco, football fans never would have discovered
Marlboro—which, as every fan knows, is the perfect com
panion to football. And why shouldn't il be? Look what
Marlboro's got . . . filter. . . Flavor. . . Flip-top Box .. .
You can't buy a better smoke. You can't smoke a better
buy.
The end of football in Europe came with the notorious
"Black Sox Scandal" of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli,
one of the Pisa mob, paid oft the 1 diversity of Heidelberg
Sabres to throw the championship game to the Chart res
A. and M. (iophers. It was a mortal blow to football on
the continent.
Bui the game took hold in the American colonies and
thrived as il had never thrived before. Which brings us
to another date that remains evergreen in the hearts of
football lovers: December 1(», 1773.
On that date a British packet loaded with tea sailed
into Boston harbor. The colonies had long been smarting
under the English king's tax on tea. " Taxation without
representation," they called it, and feelings ran high.
When on December Hi, 1773, the British ship docked
at Boston, a semi-pro football team called the Nonpareil
Tigers, coached by Samuel (Swifty) Adams, was scrim
maging near the harbor. "('ome, lads," cried Swifty, see
ing the ship. "Let's dump the tea in the ocean!"
With many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers
followed Swifty aboard and proceeded to dump Ihe
cargo overboard in a wild, disorganized and abandoned
manner. "Here now!" called Swifty sharply. "That's no
way to dump tea overboard. Let's get into some kind
of formation."
And that, fans, is how the tea formation was born.
