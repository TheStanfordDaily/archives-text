### Jack Winkler 
The first day of registration

with 5F>4O students M 072 men and
1 168 women) enrolled for autumn
quarter, a drop of 217 from last
an turn n ciiiarter's first-flay fig
ures. Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler said, however, "We ex
pect final registration to be just
about the same as last year's total
of 8287."
Registrar liarvey Mali attrib
uted the decline to a different
method of adding in the old re
turning students figures. On the
whole, he was happy with the way
registration was proceeding.
"We were rushed late in the
afternoon and we will be busy up
until about 10:30 tomorrow morn
ing, but then things will tail off,"
lie added.
"The lines are just as long, but
they are moving faster," said one
woman at the end of a day of

helping students with class lists
from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.
Early Work
Hall said more registration
work was taken care of early this
year and more people are work
ing at the desks.
"Our system of pro-assigning
Western Civ and English 1 classes
was a very great help," he said.

"English instructor Ross ihack
ney was in charge of the work
and flifl a wonderful .job."
In all, over 100 persons worked
keeping open 16 cashier windows.
18 "Turn In Rook" stations and
14 class list lines, "We had a
delay last year at the I-lealth Serv
ice desk because they wore under
staffed," saifl Hall. "More people
are working there this year and
it lias speeded up.
Unpaid Volunteers
"The fee adjustment desk is
also moving more quickly because
we pro-adjusted 300 engineers."
Most of the people working on
registration, besides the staff of
the Registrar's office, are depart
ment members, professors' wives
and graduates, many of whom are
unpaid volunteers.
Miss Inez. Stevens, who was
working in the vehicle registra
tion booth, said: "The students
have been most cooperative.
Twice today I have given men
two stickers by mistake and they

came back to return the extra
one. I believe in the Honor Code."
There were other opinions of
registration. "It's a lot of lines,"
said one freshman, "but I'll stick
it out for a while yet. I'm not
complaining."
"What a workout!" said E. W.
Oustermuehle of the Stanford po
lice department. "And on my day
off, too! The entire police staff
is working at the Pavilion today."
"It's better than last quarter,"
said cashier Mary Alden.
"I'm in favor of it," said Lt.
Gilroy of the police.
"The freshmen are confused;
the graduates are confused. It
will lie better next quarter," said
Margy McNair at the fee adjust
ment booth.
All Those Cards . . .
Innumerable freshmen asked,
"What do they do with all those
eards?"
"It's a lot of $50 bills," said one
cashier. "Why doesn't everybody
pay cash? Then we wouldn't have
all these problems."

closed yesterday at the Pavilion
with 5F>4O students M 072 men and
1 168 women) enrolled for autumn
quarter, a drop of 217 from last
an turn n ciiiarter's first-flay fig
ures. Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler said, however, "We ex
pect final registration to be just
about the same as last year's total
of 8287."
Registrar liarvey Mali attrib
uted the decline to a different
method of adding in the old re
turning students figures. On the
whole, he was happy with the way
registration was proceeding.
"We were rushed late in the
afternoon and we will be busy up
until about 10:30 tomorrow morn
ing, but then things will tail off,"
lie added.
"The lines are just as long, but
they are moving faster," said one
woman at the end of a day of

helping students with class lists
from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.
Early Work
Hall said more registration
work was taken care of early this
year and more people are work
ing at the desks.
"Our system of pro-assigning
Western Civ and English 1 classes
was a very great help," he said.

"English instructor Ross ihack
ney was in charge of the work
and flifl a wonderful .job."
In all, over 100 persons worked
keeping open 16 cashier windows.
18 "Turn In Rook" stations and
14 class list lines, "We had a
delay last year at the I-lealth Serv
ice desk because they wore under
staffed," saifl Hall. "More people
are working there this year and
it lias speeded up.
Unpaid Volunteers
"The fee adjustment desk is
also moving more quickly because
we pro-adjusted 300 engineers."
Most of the people working on
registration, besides the staff of
the Registrar's office, are depart
ment members, professors' wives
and graduates, many of whom are
unpaid volunteers.
Miss Inez. Stevens, who was
working in the vehicle registra
tion booth, said: "The students
have been most cooperative.
Twice today I have given men
two stickers by mistake and they

came back to return the extra
one. I believe in the Honor Code."
There were other opinions of
registration. "It's a lot of lines,"
said one freshman, "but I'll stick
it out for a while yet. I'm not
complaining."
"What a workout!" said E. W.
Oustermuehle of the Stanford po
lice department. "And on my day
off, too! The entire police staff
is working at the Pavilion today."
"It's better than last quarter,"
said cashier Mary Alden.
"I'm in favor of it," said Lt.
Gilroy of the police.
"The freshmen are confused;
the graduates are confused. It
will lie better next quarter," said
Margy McNair at the fee adjust
ment booth.
All Those Cards . . .
Innumerable freshmen asked,
"What do they do with all those
eards?"
"It's a lot of $50 bills," said one
cashier. "Why doesn't everybody
pay cash? Then we wouldn't have
all these problems."
