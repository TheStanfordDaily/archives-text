# Ike Warns World to Control inflation Before It's Too Late
## President Addresses Warning to World Bank And International Monetary Fund Meeting 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) President Eisenhower declared yesterday
that the "worldwide phenomenon" of inflation must be eurbed before
it spins into a depression.
Eisenhower set up the warning in a talk opening the twelflh an
nual meeting of the 64-nation World Bank and International Mone-

tary Fund. He appealed for pru-1
i dent national policies governing
i spending, lending and industrial
| expansion.
"To fail to do those things is to
j ask the economy to do more than j
i it can," Eisenhower said.
"It will react to this pressure
! through rising prices. If uncheck
ed, this leads to reaction and
i downturn and all the evil conse
quences we know so well."
The more than 500 delegates
and observers at the joint con
ference of the $0 billion financial
I agencies applauded warmly but
not demonstratively.
They received from the Mon-
I etary Fund an annual report de
; scribing a year of unprecedented
growth in trade and investment
over the free world but with the
underdeveloped countries lagging
;in the race. The report said the
Suez crisis had revealed unexpect
ed basic strength in the economies
of the many nations affected.
President Eugene R. Black of
the World Bank said that too
many countries are spending and j
investing too rapidly in industrial 1
development projects. Unless they ,
slow down, Black warned, "some- i
thing will have to give."
