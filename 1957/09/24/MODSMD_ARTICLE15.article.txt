# Five Rescued From Lifeboat Of Lost Ship
## 
### 
I-lAMBURG, Germany (/P> â€” A
U.S. freighter rescued five sur
vivors of the German bark Pamir
yesterday from a lifeboat they
shared with five dead men.
Lights and flares spotted in
mid-Atlantic raised hopes that
others of the 86-man crew lived
through the hurricane that struck
the four-masted sailing ship 550
miles west - southwest of the
Azores.
The Isbrandtsen Lines freighter
Saxon made the first rescue in
the hunt, under way since the
| Pamir radioed this SOS Saturday:
| "Heavy hurricane. All sails lost;
j 15-degrce list: danger of sinking."
Five Survive
The Saxon told Isbrandtsen's
New York office of picking up
the five men, and the line imme
diately notified the U.S. Coast
Guard. The Guard said 10 men
were in the small boat but only
five survived.
The Saxon, like the Pamir, had
been on a grain-carrying mission.
The steel-hulled Pamir was bound
from Buenos Aires to Hamburg
with a cargo of barley when she
ran into hurricane Carrie, the
third hurricane of the season. The
Saxon had left Baltimore Sept. 1 I
with a cargo of grain for Trieste.
There was a report last night
from West German radio stations
that five men had been saved by
the British freighter Tacoma Star
but this proved incorrect. A mon
itoring agency said the Tacoma
Star had simply relayed a report
from the Saxon of her rescue of
the five.
Dim Lights Seen
Three dim nrangc lights spotted
by a U.S. Sky master 550 miles
southwest of the Azores before
dawn yesterday had spurred the
ait-sea effort to reach any sur
vivors and finally determine the
Pamir's fate.
Ten ships were summoned to
I that area.
Radar of the Skymaster, one of
six Azores-based aircraft in the
hunt, indicated the lights came
from neither a large vessel nor
anything made of steel.
