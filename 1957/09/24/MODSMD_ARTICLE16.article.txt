clash after another as the crowd
variously estimated from 500 to
1000- boldly charged police lilies,

representing a Negro newspaper
in Memphis, and beat and kicked
him.
Negroes Enter

gro boys and five girls were driv
en onto the campus and calmly
walked into the school building
through a side door.
The slip - through of the In
dents angered the crowd, and
someone yelled, "Look, they're go
ing into the school! '
"Oh. God, the niggers arc in the
school!" a man roared.
A woman screamed, "Oh, my
God!" and burst into tears.
Hysteria swept the crowd and
a man leaped upon the police
barricade and shouted, "Who's go
ing through?"

are!"
