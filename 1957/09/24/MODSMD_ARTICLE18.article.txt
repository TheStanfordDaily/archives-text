# No ‘Right’ to Haze
## 
### 
To THE DISAPPOINTMENT of a Email group—at
li'U'it, we fervently hope the number is email
of our freshman cla.;s, ineonrring students
learned that ihey wouldn't he exported to swal
low live fishing worms, wear their clothes inside
out. or In- knocked down liy a torrent from a
fue hose hi order to prove they were fit to he
full-fledged members of the Stanford Family.
To the incoming student* we can proudly
112 as, ou are already members of our I arnily."
I In era of college hazing, at least at Stanford,
i f-omething of the past and we are glad of it.
iiii.i how, the words "university" and "higher
learning'" do not jibe with indignities and other
lions which come under the general category
of tlupldity.
We are indeed proud of the majority of the
( la- of 1961 in knowing that these people had
no burning urge to undergo hazing and the like
treatment, just so they iu turn could unleash
,-avage impulses on the < !lass of (t'2.
li there are any freshmen who continue to
have tiong convictions that legalized violence
i: the only way to prove one's fitness for college,
v/e offer one hit of advice: go elsewhere.
We can be thankful to our administration for
ii encouragement of mature thinking on the

part of the students. Lniversitv officials have
at limes been accused of "taking away our right
to haze people." \\ hat about the right to
burn clown someone's house? Or the right to
murder?
The idea i.- obviou.-. For the best interest of
all concerned, some actions are better left un
performed.
Today's typical Stanford student realizes he
can have lots of fun without endangering lives
and property. With the numerous social, recre
ational and other activities it is easy to have
your cake and eat it too that is, to have your
fun and .'till lie in a condition to enjoy it.
A person is doing the opposite of showing his
eligibility to belong to a respectable organiza
tion when he lowers himself or encourages
others to do things contrary to their better
judgment. I hat i;, if one allows oneself to be
smeared with paint, he's no he-man; he's
merely a sap.
We arc reasonably sure that the elementary
school attitude will ijuickly disappear from
the small minority of freshmen. When the
light dawns on these few, then they, like their
classmates, will acquire membership in the
Stanford Family in it? true meaning.
