Tt is u.ways a pi.easurf. to welcome hack to
ilie Stanford campus the large group of foreign
Mudents who arc receiving their education in
< ommon with those of us who arc Americans.
in these days of world-wide tensions, of fear
and of misunderstandings between peoples and
nations, it is indeed pood to know that those
foreign students who are studying here will he
aide to take home with them a knowledge of
America and her native philosophies.
Hut perhaps of even more value than what
I hey can learn from us is what we can and
hould learn from them. For understanding is
a two-way street, and it is just as necessary for
us to have a common understanding of our
neighbors throughout the world as it is for
them to understand us.
Working with foreign students 011 campus
are two official ASSU organizations and a num
ber of smaller groups. Perhaps the most im
portant of these groups is the Institute of Inter
national Relations, which attempts to bring the
foreign student into a common community of
interests with the American student.
I he second very important organization is
the ASSU Foreign Scholarship Commission.

'I his group adminntcrs the ASSI) scholarship
program for bringing worthy students from
foreign lands to our campus. The commission
also takes care of providing housing facilities
for them on campus and assists them in ad
justing to life at Stanford.
There are other community groups which do
much toward making the foreign student feel
at home in this country. These groups all co
ordinate their efforts at a weekly luncheon
under the auspices of Dr. Werner Warmhrunn,
the foreign student adviser.
The work that these organizations are doing
is truly worthwhile, and the time the indi
vidual members put in is not wasted. Would
that more could be done to make this world
a better place.
Hut as American students—though we may
not be members of' any of the organizations
which directly aid the foreign students—as
American students, as individuals, we can all
do our part in improving international rela
tions. All it takes is a friendly word, a tol
erance toward another's beliefs and a willing
ness to assist where assistance is needed.
