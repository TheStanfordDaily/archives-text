LONDON (TP) The United
States and five Baghdad Pact al
lies began charting new moves
yesterday to head off anti-West
ern thrusts in the Middle East.
Delegates from the six anti-
Communist countries considered
secret intelligence reports assess
ing Soviet penetration.
One of these reports suggested
that Rod agents, working from
centers in Syria, have become ac
tive among dissatisfied elements
of the Lebanese and Jordanian
populations. The Communist in
tention, the reports said, clearly
appears to be the overthrow of
Ihe pro-Western governments in
those two Arab states bordering
Syria.
I he conference met as the anti
subversion committee of the
Baghdad Pact, which comprises
Britain. Pakistan, Turkey, Iraq
and Iran.
The United States belongs to
the anti-subversion, economic and
military branches of the Baghdad
Pact, but has not become a full
member because it is fearful of
antagonizing some other Mid-
Eastern countries including Is
rael, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and
Egypt.
A Brit is h Foreign Office
spokesman told reporters that the
meeting of the anti-subervison
committee was arranged last
.June, before the Soviet Union
concentni ted on Syria.
