II seems lliat the more we travel around, Ihe
more we realize that wherever one goes, people
are—well, just people.
During tiic summer I was fortunate enough 1o
be able to visit Istanbul, Turkey. An American
naval vessel happened to he anchored in the Bos
porus during tny four-day visit and on the first
evening I met one of the sailors in the Marmara
Room of the Istanbul Hilton Hotel. As always
happens when Americans meet Americans in
foreign countries, it's like meeting old friends.
It wasn't long before we did, indeed, become
good friends.
And then we mot a Belgian whom we invited
to join our company. He turned out to be a
writer on "location" for a story, and, luckily
enough, spoke excellent English.
About a half-hour later an Englishman also
joined our group. He happened to be in transit
from a Bahrein oil refinery to London for vaca
tion. This rounded out our group for the eve
ning.
As men will do, we talked about this and about
that, our work, our interests, about the cute girl
•itting at a table with her father (we hoped he
was her father), the two teen-age Greek twins
Charles, the American, and 1 had met earlier and
who had invited us to join them, and, of course,
about our travels.
Our conversation turned to peoples we had
met in our travels, and alter all had told one or
two experiences he had had, Andre, the Belgian,
• ummed it all up with these words:
"When I'm alone or with my own countrymen,
7 think of Americans or British or Germans I
have met as Americans, British or Germans.
Bui when I'm with these people, just like when
I in \itting here with you, I think of you as
people, not as Americans or British or Germans.
And that is the difficult part to understand. It's
a question 1 haven't been able to answer."

The rest of us agreed with him. We don't know
why, but when we are with them, they are
people, people like ourselves; when we are away
from them, they are foreigners.
Perhaps one day the word foreigner wrH-not
be used with reference to any peoples on this
earth. Perhaps.
Istanbul is a wonderful city. Needless to say,
I didn't spend all my time in the Marmara Room.
Among the interesting sights are the Sancta So
phia Mosque which has recently been converted
into a museum. Much of the restoration is yet
to be completed. When viewing the Golden Horn,
the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, one's mind
returns to all he's read of the glorious and tragic
histories connected with the areas.
Just before entering the Dardanelles my ship
sailed past a coastal area of broad, slightly un
dulating plains, supposedly the site of Homer's
Troy. Then all along the Dardanelles can be
seen ruins of old forts, monuments to the failure
of the British forces in World War I to take the
Gallipoli Peninsula.
But in Istanbul herself, especially in the an
cient city, the city that was the Byzantine Con
stantinople—there is where much of the past
can still be seen and felt.
The Grand Bazaar is located in what seems to
be ancient catacombs. There are long cavernous
tunnels with branches running here and there.
Occasionally one passes through giant bronze or
wrought iron gates with markings and designs
of truly ancient vintage. In this bazaar one can
find very beautiful jewelry. But especially beau
tiful is the antique gold that abounds in this
bazaar. A word of warning. You have to have
a good guide who knows what to look for before
trying to buy antique gold. The best examples
are hidden away in stores that open on secret
alleyways that lie hidden behind these ancient
metal gates.
All in all, 1 wish my stay could have been much
longer. There was so much more to see. Numer
ous mosques of unqualified grandeur are there
for the visitor to see if one but had time.
Someday I hope to go back to Istanbul and
other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean. It's
worth every bit of time one takes to do it. Maybe
I'll see some of you there. Maybe?
