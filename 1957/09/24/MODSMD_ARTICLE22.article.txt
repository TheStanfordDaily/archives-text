Most Donations Earmarked lor Specific Uses
Gifts to Stanford University for the fiscal yc.tr ended Aug. 31
totaled a record $22,125,000, President Wallace Sterling announeec
yesterday. Five donors accounted for more than half ol - the amount
Grants from the Ford Foundation came to more than $5 million
The largest Ford grants $3,100,000 to strengthen instruction in tin

Medical School and $1,130,000 to
improve faculty salaries must be
held as endowment for 10 years
with only the income to be used,
Sterling pointed out.
Approximately 16,000 donors
contributed, compared to 14,000
the year before. Last year's dol
lar total, the previous record, was
$10,674,000.
Need Emphasized
"We are grateful to every one
of the 16,000 donors," Sterling
said. "It is especially noteworthy
that the gifts of the Ford Founda
tion have dramatically empha
sized the crucial need for broad
support of higher education.
"The Foundation clearly ex
pressed that it expects institu
tions which receive its aid to exert
every possible effort during the
next few years to obtain addi
tional support fro m other
sources."
The other four donors who
made up half of the total were
the Commonwealth Fund, New
York; G. 11. Benkendorf, Modesto,
and the estates of Mrs. Sophie K.
Hall of Los Angeles and Mrs. Ber
thold Guggenhime of San Fran
cisco.
Another major factor in boost
ing the total was the current spe
cial campaign for the Stanford
Medical Center. Approximately 69
per cent of the $21,950,000 goal
for the first phase of this drive
has been realized.
Support Doubles
Support from industry and busi
ness in 1956-57 doubled to reach
$1,535,000, Sterling reported. Be
quests totaled $7,816,000, gifts
from living individuals $2,857,000,
from foundations $8,132,000 and
from other sources $1,785,000.
Of the $22,125,000 total, all but
$564,000 was earmarked by do
nors for specific uses.
"Every citizen has cause to be
grateful for the vigorous and en
lightened leadership of foundation
and corporation executives," Ster
ling declared. "But every citizen
should also heed the fact that
foundation and corporation sup
port is inadequate to solve the
financial problems of higher edu
cation.
"If individual enterprise in
higher education is to continue,
an increasing volume of support
must be forthcoming from indi
viduals themselves."
