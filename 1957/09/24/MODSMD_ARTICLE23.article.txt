# Police to Use New Parking Tickets
## 
### 
The police department soon will
be using a new type of parking
violation notice by which a post
age-paid envelope will accompany
the notice of violation, Police
Chief Gordon Davis said.
Under this plan, a student may
mail in the violation fee instead
of taking it in to the office.
The violation fees have not been
changed except that if they are
overdue too long the fee will be
increased. Parking fees are $2 if
paid within two days.
