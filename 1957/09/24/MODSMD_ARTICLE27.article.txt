# Will History Repeat Itself When Cards Host Big Ten Club in Televised Game?
## 
### 
If past performances under
similar conditions mean any
thing, Stanford should come out
of Sal u r day' s Northwestern
game with a surprise, low-score
victory.
The similar conditions arc
three in number:
I. The game will he on nation
wide television.
!i. The opponent is a Big Ten
team.
3. Stanford will he the host
school.
This set of conditions was met
in both 1954 and 1955, and both
times the Cards scored upset vic
tories. The victim in 1954 was Il
linois, which lost 122.
Illini Karikeil High
The Jllini, with J. C. Caroline
leading a feared ground attack,
were ranked among Ihe nation's
best teams early in '54. But Stan
ford manhandled the invaders'
line, bottled up Caroline, and
started Illinois on the road to a
disastrous season.
One year later, NBC television
1 ' ' I

again trained its cameras on
Stanford Stadium and let the na
tion's football fans witness an
: even more startling reversal.
, Ohio State entered that game
| with Stanford as the Rose Bowl
I champion and defending Big Ten
j titlist. This time, Chuck Taylor's
1 men shoved across a first-period
[ score and made it hold up for a
6-0 triumph.
The Buckeyes came close to
scoring a number of times, but
| Indian defenders were always
| there to hold on fourth down or
intercept a pass. And there was
n't a thing llopalong Cassidy
could do about it.
Situation Kepeats
After a year's lapse in 195(5, the
"Stanford hosts Big Ten team on
national TV" situation is here
again as Northwestern prepares
to invade.
Alter a short run of years as
the Midwest doormal, the Wild
cats are once again beginning to
make their presence known. Last
season under a new coach, Ara

Parseghian, Nort hwe stern
climbcd up to sixth with a 3-3-1
; conference record. â€¢
This autumn, Ihe Wildcats are
expected to make an even strong
er bid for first-division honors,
although they will be depending
: heavily on sophomores.
Stanford will have one impor
tant edge iu Saturday's game
the Cards have one contest under
their belts this year, while the
! 'Cats will be making their first
j appearance of the fail.
Taylor lias Only Films
Northwestern, in turn, has the
advantage of having been able to
scout Stanford in action while
Taylor and staff have only last
year's films upon which to base
their strategy.
But, then, the scout from the
Midwest probably didn't learn too
much about the Tribe last Satur
day when it walloped San Jose,
1(1-7. At least he said he hadn't
found out much when he left
midway through the third period
with a long look on his face.
