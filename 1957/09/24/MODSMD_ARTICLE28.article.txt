man basketball coach and assistant baseball coach for the coming
year. Bill Turner, who played basketball at Stanford for two years,
will succeed last year's frosh cage and diamond coach, Dick Clegg,
who resigned in order to devote full time to graduate work.

Turner returns to the Indian
! coaching staff following a two
year absence. In 1955-56, he as
sisted Clegg with the Papoose
basketball squad.
The Cards' new mentor gradu
ated wilh a major in physical
education, and then got has mas
tor's degree in 1956. Turner at
tended Santa Rosa Junior Col
lege for two years before he
came to Stanford for his last
three years of work. He went to
high school at Fremont of Oak
i land.
"Ilappy to Be Here"'
Turner is "very happy to be
at Stanford," and regards his
appointment as an excellent op
portunity. He hopes to stay in
j college coaching, with a decided
; emphasis on basketball.
Hay ward is currently the home
. of Turner, where he lives with
his wife Adrienne, son John (14
months), and daughter Michelle
(three months).
As regards the coming frosh
rage season, Turner is highly
optimistic. Although the Pa
pooses will be facing their tough
est schedule in a long time, they
will also have some of the besl
potentially-great players in the
school's history.
Towering Center
Topping the list of prospects,
both literally and figuratively, is
Bob Whalen. The center from Le
j Mars, lowa, measures in at 6-10
| and will be among the tallest
players in Stanford cage history.
But Whalen isn't the only big
man whom Turner will work
with. Another pair nudge the
bar at 6-6, with two more men
measuring 6-5.
The 6-6ers are Andre La Borde
from Portland, Ore., and Gary
Estabrook from Cupertino. Both
are forwards, while Estabrook is
i also a high-jumper and discus
thrower who should help Floyd
Strain's frosh tracksters in the
spring.
Two at 6-5
Bud Mathieson from down the
Peninsula at Sunnyvale may
back up Whalen at the center
slot. Mathieson and A 1 Sirnila, a
forward from Glendale, are the
two 6-5 men.
Another Sunnyvale product,
[ Bub Bowling, shows good prom-
I ise as u guard. Bowling and
Mathieson both played against
the Stanford frosh last winter
when the Papooses hosted Fre
mont High of Sunnyvale.
Another out-of-state product is
Tom Nordland, a 6-1 guard who
hails from Minneapolis. These
seven, plus a flock of other good
prospects, should help Turner
greatly in getting off to a good
Stall with the Curd freshmen.

with. Another pair nudge the
bar at 6-6, with two more men
measuring 6-5.
The 6-6ers are Andre La Borde
from Portland, Ore., and Gary
Estabrook from Cupertino. Both
are forwards, while Estabrook is
i also a high-jumper and discus
thrower who should help Floyd
Strain's frosh tracksters in the
spring.
Two at 6-5
Bud Mathieson from down the
Peninsula at Sunnyvale may
back up Whalen at the center
slot. Mathieson and A 1 Sirnila, a
forward from Glendale, are the
two 6-5 men.
Another Sunnyvale product,
[ Bub Bowling, shows good prom-
I ise as u guard. Bowling and
Mathieson both played against
the Stanford frosh last winter
when the Papooses hosted Fre
mont High of Sunnyvale.
Another out-of-state product is
Tom Nordland, a 6-1 guard who
hails from Minneapolis. These
seven, plus a flock of other good
prospects, should help Turner
greatly in getting off to a good
Stall with the Curd freshmen.
