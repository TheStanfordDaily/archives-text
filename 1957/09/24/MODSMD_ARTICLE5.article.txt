### 
Inoculations against the Asiatic flu will probably be available to
Stanford students in from four to six weeks, according to Dr. George
If. Houck, director of the Student Health Service.
llouck put in an order for 10,000 doses of vaccine early in July,
but received only .">(). These were given to tho first students to arrive
m campus, football players.
Recently policemen, firemen and kitchen crews received the vac
"inc. which was purchased from funds other than student moneys.
No illnesses among students have thus far been diagnosed as the
Asiatic flu. Houck described I lie flu as being a mild disease, usually
lasting about three days.
The best medicine is plenty of rest in bed and aspirin. Usually,
10 antibiotics are administered because of possible complications.
Meanwhile, the University has made plans in the event that the
nfluen/.a epidemic should strike Stanford this fall. The isolation
'lospital would be used to house the sick and, if necessary, the sec
ond floor of Kncina will be converted into a hospital.
Encina would have room for about 430 beds. Stanford has about
"00 beds in storage and would probably have to rent more if needed.
Dr. Houck estimated that such an epidemic could hit 20 per cent
>112 the population within three weeks. At the worst, 1200 or 1 .">OO
ases could be expected.
Dr. Houck stressed thfit even if all the vaccine necessary could
•c used now, there would still be a strong possibility of an autumn
•pidemic. However, the second epidemic, expected in December or
January, would probably be averted.
