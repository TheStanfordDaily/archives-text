# Threatened Riots Drive Eight Negroes From Arkansas School
## Federal Forces May Be Used At Little Rock President Clears Way For Use of Troops as Guards for Students 
### 
NEWPORT, R.I. (/P) —President
Eisenhower cleared the legal way
last night for possible calling out
of federal troops to quell any fur
ther school integration violence in
Little Rock, Ark.
The President, acting swiftly
after 1 yesterday's racial disorders,
signed a proclamation command
ing all persons engaged in ob
struction of justice at Little Rock
to "cease and desist."
James C. Hagerty, White House
press secretary, said signing of
the proclamation does not neces
sarily mean federal troops will
be called out.
That will depend, he added, on
whether Eisenhower's warning
edict is obeyed.
Legal Prelude
The press secretary stressed
that issuing the cease-and-desist
proclamation was a necessary
legal prelude giving the Presi
dent authority for calling out fed
eral troops—but that it did not
mean they inevitably would be
called out.
Eisenhower issued the procla
mation shortly after declaring he
would use the full power of the
United States, including whatever
force might be necessary, to up
hold the law in Little Rock.
The statement was prompted by
outbreaks of violence by a while
crowd against Negro adults as
Negro children entered the school.
School authorities and police
withdrew the Negro pupils after
a few hours.
Position Clarified
The President described the out
breaks as disgraceful occurrences
and said he wanted to make his
position very clear.
"I will use the full power of the
United States, including whatever
force may bo necessary, to pre
vent any obstruction of the law
and to carry out the orders of the
federal court,"he said.
The vacation White House de
clined to give any immediate in
dication of what type of force
might be used.
Press Secretary Hagerty, who
read the statement, said it was
complete. He said in response to
newsmen's questions for more de
tails that he had nothing to add.
The President's statement sug
gested that some kind of federal
escort might be given to Negro
children trying to enter Little
Rock's Central High School—but
whether soldiers or other federal
units was not indicated.

escort might be given to Negro
children trying to enter Little
Rock's Central High School—but
whether soldiers or other federal
units was not indicated.
NEWPORT, R.I. (/P) —President
Eisenhower cleared the legal way
last night for possible calling out
of federal troops to quell any fur
ther school integration violence in
Little Rock, Ark.
The President, acting swiftly
after 1 yesterday's racial disorders,
signed a proclamation command
ing all persons engaged in ob
struction of justice at Little Rock
to "cease and desist."
James C. Hagerty, White House
press secretary, said signing of
the proclamation does not neces
sarily mean federal troops will
be called out.
That will depend, he added, on
whether Eisenhower's warning
edict is obeyed.
Legal Prelude
The press secretary stressed
that issuing the cease-and-desist
proclamation was a necessary
legal prelude giving the Presi
dent authority for calling out fed
eral troops—but that it did not
mean they inevitably would be
called out.
Eisenhower issued the procla
mation shortly after declaring he
would use the full power of the
United States, including whatever
force might be necessary, to up
hold the law in Little Rock.
The statement was prompted by
outbreaks of violence by a while
crowd against Negro adults as
Negro children entered the school.
School authorities and police
withdrew the Negro pupils after
a few hours.
Position Clarified
The President described the out
breaks as disgraceful occurrences
and said he wanted to make his
position very clear.
"I will use the full power of the
United States, including whatever
force may bo necessary, to pre
vent any obstruction of the law
and to carry out the orders of the
federal court,"he said.
The vacation White House de
clined to give any immediate in
dication of what type of force
might be used.
Press Secretary Hagerty, who
read the statement, said it was
complete. He said in response to
newsmen's questions for more de
tails that he had nothing to add.
The President's statement sug
gested that some kind of federal
escort might be given to Negro
children trying to enter Little
Rock's Central High School—but
whether soldiers or other federal
units was not indicated.
