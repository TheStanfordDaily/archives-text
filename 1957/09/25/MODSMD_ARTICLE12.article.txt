The ringing tones of the Hoover Tower carillon will sound
throughout campus twice daily henceforth, University officials
said yesterday.
Increased use of the bells is in response to a request from fac
ulty members that the music be made a part of the daily life of
the campus.
When classes are dismissed just before noon the carillon will
sound the notes of the Stanford hymn, "Hail! Stanford, Hail!"
and at 6 p.m. "Hail! Alma Mater."
The carillon will be played at these times automatically by a
drum device similar to a music box. The automatic system was
installer! with the carillon in 1941, but was this summer put in
operative condition for the first time by Arthur Bigelow, Princeton
professor of engineering and a carillon authority.
Professor Bigelow spent four days here renovating and tuning
the instrument.
Though the daily music will be played automatically, concerts
will continue to be played manually in connection with special
events.
