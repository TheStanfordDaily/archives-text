# Britain Claims Soviets Stocking Bases in Syria
## Lloyd Blames Disarmament Failures On Russian Refusal to Co-operate 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (fP) — Britain told the UN yesterday
there are signs the Communist, buildup in Syria is intended to stock
Soviet advance bases in the Middle East.
Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd made the statement in a policy
speech before the 82-nation General Assembly in which he charged

the Soviet Union with creating
tension and anxiety in the Middle
East. He also declared failure to
make progress on disarmament
is due to Soviet refusal to "get
down to brass tacks."
Lloyd's speech coincided with
the delivery of notes to the Krem
lin by the United States, Britain
and France containing similar
charges on Soviet activities in
the Arab world, and rejecting the
Soviet request for a big power
declaration renouncing use of
force to settle Middle East issues.
Lloyd labeled Soviet policy in
the Middle East as "simply op
portunist."
Receive Arms
He said Arab states which re
ceive Soviet arms are mortgaging
their resources to pay for them
"and probably have done porma
rent damage to their economies."
The British leader declared the
arms "are more likely to cause
trouble than prevent it,"and add
ed: "There are some who believe
that the purpose behind this is to
pre-stock forward bases for the
Soviet Union itself. The deliver
ies are on such a scale as to give
some color to this suggestion."
Lloyd said Britain views the
situation in Syria with "grave
concern," thus lining up with the
stand taken by U.S. Secretary of
State Dulles in his Assembly pol
icy speech last Thursday.
He expressed agreement with
the position of Dulles on a UN
resolution adopted in 1949 calling
on member nations to refrain
from intimidating others. Lloyd
said this "should be the standard
by which we judge the situation
here."
Lashes Out
The British foreign minister
lashed out at the policy speech of
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko last Friday. Lloyd said
that .boiled down, the Gromyko
speech demanded abandonment
by the Western powers of defen
sive alliances against the threat
of the Soviet Union and the lay
ing aside of their principal weap
ons to deter further Soviet ag
gression.
"In return the Soviet Union
promises to infiltrate and sub
vert with increased intensity all
the areas which are not already
under their control," Lloyd said.
"His propositions wore really as
simple as that."

that the purpose behind this is to
pre-stock forward bases for the
Soviet Union itself. The deliver
ies are on such a scale as to give
some color to this suggestion."
Lloyd said Britain views the
situation in Syria with "grave
concern," thus lining up with the
stand taken by U.S. Secretary of
State Dulles in his Assembly pol
icy speech last Thursday.
He expressed agreement with
the position of Dulles on a UN
resolution adopted in 1949 calling
on member nations to refrain
from intimidating others. Lloyd
said this "should be the standard
by which we judge the situation
here."
Lashes Out
The British foreign minister
lashed out at the policy speech of
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko last Friday. Lloyd said
that .boiled down, the Gromyko
speech demanded abandonment
by the Western powers of defen
sive alliances against the threat
of the Soviet Union and the lay
ing aside of their principal weap
ons to deter further Soviet ag
gression.
"In return the Soviet Union
promises to infiltrate and sub
vert with increased intensity all
the areas which are not already
under their control," Lloyd said.
"His propositions wore really as
simple as that."
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (fP) — Britain told the UN yesterday
there are signs the Communist, buildup in Syria is intended to stock
Soviet advance bases in the Middle East.
Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd made the statement in a policy
speech before the 82-nation General Assembly in which he charged

the Soviet Union with creating
tension and anxiety in the Middle
East. He also declared failure to
make progress on disarmament
is due to Soviet refusal to "get
down to brass tacks."
Lloyd's speech coincided with
the delivery of notes to the Krem
lin by the United States, Britain
and France containing similar
charges on Soviet activities in
the Arab world, and rejecting the
Soviet request for a big power
declaration renouncing use of
force to settle Middle East issues.
Lloyd labeled Soviet policy in
the Middle East as "simply op
portunist."
Receive Arms
He said Arab states which re
ceive Soviet arms are mortgaging
their resources to pay for them
"and probably have done porma
rent damage to their economies."
The British leader declared the
arms "are more likely to cause
trouble than prevent it,"and add
ed: "There are some who believe
that the purpose behind this is to
pre-stock forward bases for the
Soviet Union itself. The deliver
ies are on such a scale as to give
