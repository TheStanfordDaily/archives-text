# Stanford to Establish Branch in Germany
## Beutelsbach Study Branch Plans Near Completion Unique Facility to Open June For Two Terms of 60 Students Each 
### 
President Wallace Sterling announced todaj' that plans are near
completion for the establishment of a Stanford Study Center in Ger
many, probably the only one of its kind to be operated by an Ameri
can university, which will accommodate two groups of 60 American
students a year for six months each. The anticipated opening date

is June, 1958.
Stanford is in the final stage of
negotiations with the owners of
the facility, located at Beutels
bach, 12 miles from Stuttgart. It
provides dormitories and class
rooms on a 30-acre site, an estate
on a hilltop overlooking a river
valley. It commands magnificent
views over fields and red-roofed
villages in several directions.
The location provides both the
isolation desirable for a residen
tial university branch and prox
imity to a great cultural center.
Stuttgart, a city of 6200,00 in
habitants, is the capital of the
State of Baden-Wuerttemberg. It
is centrally located in southern
Germany with easy rail connec
tions to Vienna, Rome, Paris,
Switzerland and the rest of west
ern Europe. The state supports
a year-around opera, a theater
and a concert series, and the city
also supports a theater.
Technical University
There is a technical university
with 7000 students in Stuttgart
and nearby is the famous Uni
versity of Tubingen. The presi
dents of both assured the fullest
co-operation in scheduling visit
ing lecturers and making avail
able their facilities.
The students will be selected
from applicants among regularly
enrolled Stanford students, prob
ably sophomores and juniors.
The Center, once it is operat
ing, is expected to be self-sustain
ing, President Sterling said. Stu
dents will pay the usual Stanford
tuition and room and board fees.
A favorable differential in food
costs and other factors will en
able the University to furnish
transportation by chartered
plane to Germany. The students,
many of whom may wish to
travel in Europe before return
ing, will arrange the journey
home privately.
Grants Available
Some grants covering the re
turn trip will be available so that
the program will not be limited
to wealthy students, President
Sterling said.
Two Stanford faculty couples
will be in residence. The profes
sors will teach courses which
will, for the most part, fit into
Stanford's General Studies Pro
gram, with emphasis on the liter
ature, history, culture and eco
nomics of Europe. Native teach
ers will give intensive language
instruction. Regular academic
credit will be given.
Under study'for nearly a year,
plans were facilitated by a $15,-
000 grant from the Fund for the
Advancement of Education. Part
of the funds were used to send a
four-man survey team to Beutels
bach and the rest is to be devoted
to such special costs as installa
tion of a small library, and other
activation costs.
Stanford Members
Members of the Stanford sur<
vey team were Dwight B. Adams,
assistant business manager; F.
W. Strothmann, executive head
of the Department of Germanic
and Romanic Languages; Robert
A. Walker, professor of political
science and chairman of the Gen
eral Studies Committee, and H.
Donald Winbigler, dean of stu
dents.
Stanford is interested in estab
lishing similar centers in other
non - English - speaking foreign
countries, the president declared.
Conforming to the Stanford
system of dividing the school
year into quarters, one group will
go in June and the next in Jan
uary. Procedures are being de
veloped for application for the
program, and will be announced
when completed.

Under study'for nearly a year,
plans were facilitated by a $15,-

Stanford Members
Members of the Stanford sur<
vey team were Dwight B. Adams,
assistant business manager; F.
W. Strothmann, executive head
of the Department of Germanic
and Romanic Languages; Robert
A. Walker, professor of political
science and chairman of the Gen
eral Studies Committee, and H.

Stanford is interested in estab
lishing similar centers in other
non - English - speaking foreign
countries, the president declared.
Conforming to the Stanford
system of dividing the school
year into quarters, one group will
go in June and the next in Jan

President Wallace Sterling announced todaj' that plans are near
completion for the establishment of a Stanford Study Center in Ger
many, probably the only one of its kind to be operated by an Ameri
can university, which will accommodate two groups of 60 American
students a year for six months each. The anticipated opening date

is June, 1958.
Stanford is in the final stage of
negotiations with the owners of
the facility, located at Beutels
bach, 12 miles from Stuttgart. It
provides dormitories and class
rooms on a 30-acre site, an estate
on a hilltop overlooking a river
valley. It commands magnificent
views over fields and red-roofed
villages in several directions.
The location provides both the
isolation desirable for a residen
tial university branch and prox
imity to a great cultural center.
Stuttgart, a city of 6200,00 in
habitants, is the capital of the
State of Baden-Wuerttemberg. It
is centrally located in southern
Germany with easy rail connec
tions to Vienna, Rome, Paris,
Switzerland and the rest of west
ern Europe. The state supports
a year-around opera, a theater
and a concert series, and the city
also supports a theater.
Technical University
There is a technical university
with 7000 students in Stuttgart
and nearby is the famous Uni
versity of Tubingen. The presi
dents of both assured the fullest
co-operation in scheduling visit
ing lecturers and making avail
able their facilities.
The students will be selected
from applicants among regularly
enrolled Stanford students, prob
ably sophomores and juniors.
The Center, once it is operat
ing, is expected to be self-sustain
ing, President Sterling said. Stu
dents will pay the usual Stanford
tuition and room and board fees.
A favorable differential in food
costs and other factors will en
able the University to furnish
transportation by chartered
plane to Germany. The students,
many of whom may wish to
travel in Europe before return
ing, will arrange the journey
home privately.
Grants Available
Some grants covering the re
turn trip will be available so that
the program will not be limited
to wealthy students, President
Sterling said.
Two Stanford faculty couples
will be in residence. The profes
sors will teach courses which
will, for the most part, fit into
Stanford's General Studies Pro
gram, with emphasis on the liter
ature, history, culture and eco
nomics of Europe. Native teach
ers will give intensive language
