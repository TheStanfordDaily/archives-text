# Study Center in Germany
## 
### 
Do you want to go to Europe? Come to Stan
ford University for a year and try out for a
six months' study tour at our campus-away
from-home.
In the days when Stanford was first estab
lished, a farm in northern California might
have been enough to satisfy the intellectual
and cultural aspirations of students. The Farm
might have had to go on satisfying its students
in spite of the fact that their interest in far
away places has grown to a tremendous peak.
This, however, is not the case. Forward
looking Stanford administrators have investi
gated and are now in the process of completing
a fantastic Study Center in Germany.
The mere dream of Stanford flying 120 stu
dents off to Germany each year to study under
a plan which will fit directly into our General
Studies Program is daring. The fact that Stan
ford is actually on the brink of accomplishing
this feat is commendable no, it is downright
exciting!
And that is not all; the dreaming is not over.
In the 112 uture Stanford hopes to set up similar

study centers in France, Spain and many othe
countries.
Extended for more centers, of course,
depend on the success of the original blueprint.
The success of the original plans will depen<
on the first 60 students who are sent to Cer
nianv, and these students will undoubtedly h(
chosen with the greatest of care. How can sucl
a program help but succeed?
The specific individuals who will he able tc
profit from this organized venture will b(
many. However, the experiences, knowledge
and insight which they will undoubtedly gaii
will not be advantageous to them alone. The
University as a whole is on the brink of a
change which cannot help but cause us tc
graduate better-educated, broader-viewing men
and women. Because, even if you don't make
it to Europe yourself, you are beaded for the
pleasure of hearing interesting tales from your
friends who do go.
The Farm is a wonderful place to spend four
years, hut how much more wonderful it will he
to spend one of those years in a little German
village!
