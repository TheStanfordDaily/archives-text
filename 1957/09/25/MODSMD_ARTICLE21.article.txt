# Abysmal Blindness of Mankind
## 
### 
It is becoming increasingly difficult for the
average student to view I lie events which have
heen occurring in Little Rock, Ark., with any
thing approaching equanimity.
The latest riots which have occurred over
that bitterly contested integration issue in Lit
tle Rock are monuments to the abysmal blind
ness of mankind, the wrongful substitution of
passion for reason.
Even if we were to leave out all arguments
either for or against integration, even if we
were to declare ourselves unable to take sides
one way or the other, the brutality exhibited
by the crowds surrounding Little Rock Central
High School would be enough to inflame and
disgust us. We protest because we must.
How long can we tolerate mankind's injus
tice to mankind? How long must we sit back

and watch events —which we cry out vocifer
ously against in foreign countries—occur in
our very back yards?
We are students, not statesmen. Our voices
carry little farther than the confines of this
campus. Rut we cannot, through our silence,
condone the flouting of federal law through
the use of mob violence directed by reasons
of prejudices.
President Eisenhower acted slowly, out of
deference to state authority and competence to
handle its own problems. Rut Monday's riots
forced the President to make a strong move
by federalizing the Arkansas National Guard.
What repercussions this will have has yet to be
determined. Rut the authority of the federal
courts and the national government must he
maintained.
