# MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
## 'Washington Slept Here, Too' 
### Rich Brown, Associate Editor 
Adventure and endless opportunities to ex
plore the Stanford countryside await all of you
who are new to the Farm this year—and even
those of you who just didn't get around to it
last year.
Every locale has its points of interest which
include everything from haunted houses to build
ings which can boast "the President slept here"—
even if he wasn't George Washington. Stanford
can stand up to any community for its share of
"believe it or not" items.
When you pay your room and board bills you
will walk on the same wooden floor that Presi
dent Benjamin Harrison trod during the 1890's
as he went to and from his suite in Encina Hall.
The former Chief Executive taught classes dur
ing the University's formative years and made
Encina his headquarters during the entire time.
While the ex-President was teaching, a to-be-
President—Herbert Hoover—was on the same
campus as a student.
Encina is the place where on the morning of
April 18, 1906, a water tank on the roof burst
during the famous earthquake, causing at least
one student to flee screaming, "Tidal wave!"
By now you've probably heard vaguely of
"The Frenchman." If not, you won't have far to
go to see the remains of his Santa Clara County
"French Empire." Just east of Wilbur and Bran
ner halls, on Escondido Road, you will discover
a two-story house with a large tower.
Occupied today by history professor Don Fehr
enbacher, the sturdy brick-and-oak structure once
served as The Frenchman's library and office.
Across the street and hidden under trees is his
old residence, now the home of professor William
Bark, also of the History Department. Both build
ings were erected in the 1870's.
What about The Frenchman? Paulin Caperon
was really a political exile of France's turbulent
period following the Franco-Prussian War, but
stories over the years have portrayed him as
everything from a criminal to a crazy man.
Actually he was imitating his French estate
when he built an artificial lake and an assort
ment of tunnels to supply water. Needless to say,
some people still think they might make their
first million by finding buried treasure in the
tunnels. You might try it some time.
To store water, Caperon built a stone tower
along Page Mill Road which today looks like a
crumbling medieval castle.
In another direction from the Quad, you will
find a piece of gold worth many times its metallic
content. This is the famous Golden Spike, which

Leland Stanford drove in 1869 to complete the
first U.S. transcontinental railroad. In the same
room—at Stanford Museum —is the "Governor
Stanford," first locomotive brought by sailing
ship around the Horn to California.
Both these exhibits—in fact, everything in the
Museum—are free for your inspection, if you
bring your student body card.
Down on El Camino Real, heading north, you
might notice a tall redwood tree next to the
Southern Pacific bridge over San Francisquito
Creek. That is the famous Palo Alto ("tall tree"
in Spanish), from which the Stanfords' Palo Alto
Farm and later the city took their names.
Even the paper you're reading couldn't resist
the name at first and was known as The Daily
Palo Alto until 1926.
Behind the. shopping center is the Stanford
Convalescent Home. At one time many big-wigs
visited Senator and Mrs. Stanford in this house,
their Farm residence. The original part of the
house was built in the 1860's. Later a large wing
was added, but the original part of the house
proved the strongest in the '06 earthquake—that's
all that remains of the mansion.
Besides being one of the builders of the Cen
tral Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads, Sena
tor Stanford also founded the California Street
Cable Railroad in San Francisco, since it was dif
ficult for his horses to pull the carriage to his
mansion on Nob Hill.
On the Peninsula branch of Stanford's steam
railroad, you might note there are no more gen
uine choo-choos—just the unromantic diesels. The
last regular steam run was made in January of
this year, while a special excursion in May fea
tured a balloon-stacked, 1890-vintage locomotive.
The origins of campus structures can be in
teresting. According to the Stanford Review,
Alumni Association magazine, the Chemistry
Building (built in 1900) owes its existence to a
Sunday afternoon carriage ride by Mrs. Stanford.
As the founder's widow rode past the chem
department, then located in Quad buildings, pow
erful fumes assailed her nostrils. Whether the
chem students had planned such an event in the
hopes of getting their own building will never
be known—but the Chemistry Building, located
away from other classes, was built immediately
thereafter.
We haven't gone far on our campus tour, but
at least it's a start. So, look carefully at your
surroundings; the next item you see might have
come over on the Mayflower.

To store water, Caperon built a stone tower
along Page Mill Road which today looks like a
crumbling medieval castle.
In another direction from the Quad, you will
find a piece of gold worth many times its metallic
content. This is the famous Golden Spike, which

Leland Stanford drove in 1869 to complete the
first U.S. transcontinental railroad. In the same
room—at Stanford Museum —is the "Governor
Stanford," first locomotive brought by sailing
ship around the Horn to California.
Both these exhibits—in fact, everything in the
Museum—are free for your inspection, if you
bring your student body card.
Down on El Camino Real, heading north, you
might notice a tall redwood tree next to the
Southern Pacific bridge over San Francisquito
Creek. That is the famous Palo Alto ("tall tree"
in Spanish), from which the Stanfords' Palo Alto
Farm and later the city took their names.
Even the paper you're reading couldn't resist
the name at first and was known as The Daily
Palo Alto until 1926.
Behind the. shopping center is the Stanford
Convalescent Home. At one time many big-wigs
visited Senator and Mrs. Stanford in this house,
their Farm residence. The original part of the
house was built in the 1860's. Later a large wing
was added, but the original part of the house
proved the strongest in the '06 earthquake—that's
all that remains of the mansion.
Besides being one of the builders of the Cen
tral Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads, Sena
tor Stanford also founded the California Street
Cable Railroad in San Francisco, since it was dif
ficult for his horses to pull the carriage to his
mansion on Nob Hill.
On the Peninsula branch of Stanford's steam
railroad, you might note there are no more gen
uine choo-choos—just the unromantic diesels. The
last regular steam run was made in January of
this year, while a special excursion in May fea
tured a balloon-stacked, 1890-vintage locomotive.
The origins of campus structures can be in
teresting. According to the Stanford Review,
Alumni Association magazine, the Chemistry
Building (built in 1900) owes its existence to a
Sunday afternoon carriage ride by Mrs. Stanford.
As the founder's widow rode past the chem
department, then located in Quad buildings, pow
erful fumes assailed her nostrils. Whether the
chem students had planned such an event in the
hopes of getting their own building will never
be known—but the Chemistry Building, located
away from other classes, was built immediately
thereafter.
We haven't gone far on our campus tour, but
at least it's a start. So, look carefully at your
surroundings; the next item you see might have
come over on the Mayflower.
Adventure and endless opportunities to ex
plore the Stanford countryside await all of you
who are new to the Farm this year—and even
those of you who just didn't get around to it
last year.
Every locale has its points of interest which
include everything from haunted houses to build
ings which can boast "the President slept here"—
even if he wasn't George Washington. Stanford
can stand up to any community for its share of
"believe it or not" items.
When you pay your room and board bills you
will walk on the same wooden floor that Presi
dent Benjamin Harrison trod during the 1890's
as he went to and from his suite in Encina Hall.
The former Chief Executive taught classes dur
ing the University's formative years and made
Encina his headquarters during the entire time.
While the ex-President was teaching, a to-be-
President—Herbert Hoover—was on the same
campus as a student.
Encina is the place where on the morning of
April 18, 1906, a water tank on the roof burst
during the famous earthquake, causing at least
one student to flee screaming, "Tidal wave!"
By now you've probably heard vaguely of
"The Frenchman." If not, you won't have far to
go to see the remains of his Santa Clara County
"French Empire." Just east of Wilbur and Bran
ner halls, on Escondido Road, you will discover
a two-story house with a large tower.
Occupied today by history professor Don Fehr
enbacher, the sturdy brick-and-oak structure once
served as The Frenchman's library and office.
Across the street and hidden under trees is his
old residence, now the home of professor William
Bark, also of the History Department. Both build
ings were erected in the 1870's.
What about The Frenchman? Paulin Caperon
was really a political exile of France's turbulent
period following the Franco-Prussian War, but
stories over the years have portrayed him as
everything from a criminal to a crazy man.
Actually he was imitating his French estate
when he built an artificial lake and an assort
ment of tunnels to supply water. Needless to say,
some people still think they might make their
first million by finding buried treasure in the
tunnels. You might try it some time.

department, then located in Quad buildings, pow
erful fumes assailed her nostrils. Whether the
chem students had planned such an event in the
hopes of getting their own building will never
be known—but the Chemistry Building, located
away from other classes, was built immediately
thereafter.
We haven't gone far on our campus tour, but
at least it's a start. So, look carefully at your
surroundings; the next item you see might have
come over on the Mayflower.
Adventure and endless opportunities to ex
plore the Stanford countryside await all of you
who are new to the Farm this year—and even
those of you who just didn't get around to it
last year.
Every locale has its points of interest which
include everything from haunted houses to build
ings which can boast "the President slept here"—
even if he wasn't George Washington. Stanford
can stand up to any community for its share of
"believe it or not" items.
When you pay your room and board bills you
will walk on the same wooden floor that Presi
dent Benjamin Harrison trod during the 1890's
as he went to and from his suite in Encina Hall.
The former Chief Executive taught classes dur
ing the University's formative years and made
Encina his headquarters during the entire time.
While the ex-President was teaching, a to-be-
President—Herbert Hoover—was on the same
campus as a student.
Encina is the place where on the morning of
April 18, 1906, a water tank on the roof burst
during the famous earthquake, causing at least
one student to flee screaming, "Tidal wave!"
By now you've probably heard vaguely of
"The Frenchman." If not, you won't have far to
go to see the remains of his Santa Clara County
"French Empire." Just east of Wilbur and Bran
ner halls, on Escondido Road, you will discover
a two-story house with a large tower.
Occupied today by history professor Don Fehr
enbacher, the sturdy brick-and-oak structure once
served as The Frenchman's library and office.
Across the street and hidden under trees is his
old residence, now the home of professor William
Bark, also of the History Department. Both build
ings were erected in the 1870's.
What about The Frenchman? Paulin Caperon
was really a political exile of France's turbulent
period following the Franco-Prussian War, but
stories over the years have portrayed him as
everything from a criminal to a crazy man.
Actually he was imitating his French estate
when he built an artificial lake and an assort
ment of tunnels to supply water. Needless to say,
some people still think they might make their
first million by finding buried treasure in the
tunnels. You might try it some time.
To store water, Caperon built a stone tower
along Page Mill Road which today looks like a
crumbling medieval castle.
In another direction from the Quad, you will
find a piece of gold worth many times its metallic
content. This is the famous Golden Spike, which

Leland Stanford drove in 1869 to complete the
first U.S. transcontinental railroad. In the same
room—at Stanford Museum —is the "Governor
Stanford," first locomotive brought by sailing
ship around the Horn to California.
Both these exhibits—in fact, everything in the
Museum—are free for your inspection, if you
bring your student body card.
Down on El Camino Real, heading north, you
might notice a tall redwood tree next to the
Southern Pacific bridge over San Francisquito
Creek. That is the famous Palo Alto ("tall tree"
in Spanish), from which the Stanfords' Palo Alto
Farm and later the city took their names.
Even the paper you're reading couldn't resist
the name at first and was known as The Daily
Palo Alto until 1926.
Behind the. shopping center is the Stanford
Convalescent Home. At one time many big-wigs
visited Senator and Mrs. Stanford in this house,
their Farm residence. The original part of the
house was built in the 1860's. Later a large wing
was added, but the original part of the house
proved the strongest in the '06 earthquake—that's
all that remains of the mansion.
Besides being one of the builders of the Cen
tral Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads, Sena
tor Stanford also founded the California Street
Cable Railroad in San Francisco, since it was dif
ficult for his horses to pull the carriage to his
mansion on Nob Hill.
On the Peninsula branch of Stanford's steam
railroad, you might note there are no more gen
uine choo-choos—just the unromantic diesels. The
last regular steam run was made in January of
this year, while a special excursion in May fea
tured a balloon-stacked, 1890-vintage locomotive.
The origins of campus structures can be in
teresting. According to the Stanford Review,
Alumni Association magazine, the Chemistry
Building (built in 1900) owes its existence to a
Sunday afternoon carriage ride by Mrs. Stanford.
