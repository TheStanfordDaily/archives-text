# Most-Feared Big 10 Ball-Carrier Is Only 5 ft. 4 in. Tall
## McKeiver Is Man Indians Must Stop 
### 
Rob McKeiver, rated Ihe
most-feared ballcarrier in ihe
Rig Ten although he is only
5 feef 4\» inches tall and
weighs a mere 158 pounds, will
carry much of Northwestern's
hopes in the intersectional
clash with Stanford here next
Saturday.
McKeiver became known as
the "biggest little man in col
lege football" last year as he
virtually singlehandedly led the
Wildcats out of the Big Ten
cellar into a sixth-place finish
with a 3-3-1 record and an over
all season mark of 4-4-1.
The mighty mite topped Ihe
Wildcats in every statistical
category as he scored 38 points
on four touchdowns, one field
goal and 11 conversions, aver
aged 5.2 yards in rushing, re
turned li kickoffs for 251
yards, caught 14 passes for 171
yards and averaged 39.6 yards
in punting. The punting statis
tic was tops in the Big Ten.
While McKeiver possesses

blaring speed, it's his shifti
ness and change of pace that
makes him so hard to catch
and harder to bring down once
he is caught.
In commenting upon his ace
performer, Coach Ara Parsegh
ian said, ' No player is indis
pensable, but if there is such a
one it would have to be McKei
ver. He's the most versatile
player I've ever seen. He does
all things and lie does all of
them well."
The superb little halfback
was born in Evanston, a few
blocks from the Northwestern
campus. He was a high school
sensation as he smashed scor
ing records and led Evanston
to the state championship in
his senior year - .
In 15)53, McKeiver was hailed
as one of the top sophomore
prospects in the Big Ten, but
lie never got a chance to prove
it. Ankle injuries sidelined him
most of the season and he car
ried the ball but J ft times for

72 yards and a 4.4 average.
Then followed two years in

the army in which ho played
service football in Germany.
He returned last autumn just
in time for the start of prac
tice.
In the opening game against
lowa State he scored all of
Northwestern's points in a 14
to 13 victory. In the Big Ten
opener against Minnesota he
was a standout in a scoreless
lie that kept the Gophers out
of the Rose Bowl and demon
strated that the Wildcats had
returned to football respecta
bility.
Although opponents not their
defenses to stop the toy Wild
cat, he continued to roam far
and wide. He racked up runs
of GO and G7 yards against
Michigan and Ohio State respec
tively, and was a key figure in
victories over Purdue, Wiscon
sin and Illinois in the last three
games of the season.
The starting backfield is
rounded out by Ed Quinn, 206-

pound fullback, whose power
running was a big factor in
Northwestern's wins over Per
due, Wisconsin and Illinois in
the closing games of last sea
son. Also present is the fleet
Will me r Fowler, Big Ten
sprint champion.
Four starters return from last
year's stout defensive line, Ben
Napolski and Cliff Peart, ends;
Andy Evercke, tackle, and A 1
Viola, guard. The latter was a
popular choice for All-Confer
ence guard last year. Another
season like the last one and the
rugged 205 - pound ex • Marine
could turn up on the Ail-Ameri
can lists this fall.
Other line starters include
Frank Bennett, a letterman,
at center; Jack Siatta, 212-
pound sophomore, at left guard
and either A 1 Weyhrich, senior
letterman, or Gene Gossage,
232-pound sophomore, at right
tackle.

Rob McKeiver, rated Ihe
most-feared ballcarrier in ihe
Rig Ten although he is only
5 feef 4\» inches tall and
weighs a mere 158 pounds, will
carry much of Northwestern's
hopes in the intersectional
clash with Stanford here next
Saturday.
McKeiver became known as
the "biggest little man in col
lege football" last year as he
virtually singlehandedly led the
Wildcats out of the Big Ten
cellar into a sixth-place finish
with a 3-3-1 record and an over
all season mark of 4-4-1.
The mighty mite topped Ihe
Wildcats in every statistical
category as he scored 38 points
on four touchdowns, one field
goal and 11 conversions, aver
aged 5.2 yards in rushing, re
turned li kickoffs for 251
yards, caught 14 passes for 171
yards and averaged 39.6 yards
in punting. The punting statis
tic was tops in the Big Ten.
While McKeiver possesses

blaring speed, it's his shifti
ness and change of pace that
makes him so hard to catch
and harder to bring down once
he is caught.
In commenting upon his ace
performer, Coach Ara Parsegh
ian said, ' No player is indis
pensable, but if there is such a
one it would have to be McKei
ver. He's the most versatile
player I've ever seen. He does
all things and lie does all of
them well."
The superb little halfback
was born in Evanston, a few
blocks from the Northwestern
campus. He was a high school
sensation as he smashed scor
ing records and led Evanston
to the state championship in
his senior year - .
In 15)53, McKeiver was hailed
as one of the top sophomore
prospects in the Big Ten, but
lie never got a chance to prove
it. Ankle injuries sidelined him
most of the season and he car
ried the ball but J ft times for

72 yards and a 4.4 average.
Then followed two years in

the army in which ho played
service football in Germany.
He returned last autumn just
in time for the start of prac
tice.
In the opening game against
lowa State he scored all of
Northwestern's points in a 14
to 13 victory. In the Big Ten
opener against Minnesota he
was a standout in a scoreless
lie that kept the Gophers out
of the Rose Bowl and demon
strated that the Wildcats had
returned to football respecta
bility.
Although opponents not their
defenses to stop the toy Wild
cat, he continued to roam far
and wide. He racked up runs
of GO and G7 yards against
Michigan and Ohio State respec
tively, and was a key figure in
victories over Purdue, Wiscon
sin and Illinois in the last three
games of the season.
The starting backfield is
rounded out by Ed Quinn, 206-

pound fullback, whose power
running was a big factor in
Northwestern's wins over Per
due, Wisconsin and Illinois in
the closing games of last sea
son. Also present is the fleet

Four starters return from last
year's stout defensive line, Ben
