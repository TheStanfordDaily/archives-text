# UN
						Shelves China Membership Talk
## 
### 
By a vote of 57 in favor, 27
against and 7 abstentions, the
General Assembly adopted a U.S.
proposal to postpone considering
Communist China's membership
in the UN at least until the au
tumn of 1958.
The action was a rebuff for
those nations voting against
shelving the question: the So
viet block, the Scandinavian
countries, India and several
Asian and Middle East nations
including Syria and Egypt.
U.S. Delegate Henry Cabot
Lodge said the United States
does not oppose Red China's
membership in the UN because
of its social system hut because
it "had proved beyond doubt that
it is not peace-loving."
