# Bookstore Awaits End Of Long Lines
## Less Confusion Noted This Year; New Store Eyed for Fall 1958 
### Jack Winkler 
You had better hurry up and
get in those Bookstore lines that
are stretching far out into Lasuen
Street and blocking traffic at En
gineering Corner, because they
may be the last such lines you'll
get the opportunity to stand in.
Mrs. H. T. Bauchou, who man
ages the Bookstore, said: "Wo
HOPE the new store will be start
ed early next year and be ready
by next fall. In the meantime,
however, the long lines will go on
for the rest of this week.
"We will bo open from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m. through Thursday, 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, and 8
a.m. to noon on Saturday. More
than' 30 people are working be
hind the counters during the rush.
Less Confusion
"Actually, there is less confu
sion this year," she continued, "be
cause freshmen are getting their
books at Engineering Corner, and
Law, Business and NROTC stu
dents are getting books in their
own buildings."
Freshmen have been throwing
away rebate slips, however, she
added. The Bookstore is run for
the convenience of Stanford peo
ple and is a non-profit organiza
tion.
The rebate slips should be saved
and turned in on May 1. The
Bookstore will then refund a part
of the total. Last year the rebate
was 20 per cent.
There are many new items for
sale this year including plates,
mugs and now kinds of glasses,
stationery and ash trays, all spe
cially designed for the Bookstore.
There is also a complete stock
of Stanford pennants for sale fea
turing the famous Jack Dixon In
dian, which is copyrighted b.y the
Bookstore, and the smooth-plated
notebook papers made particular
ly for Stanford.
Mail-Order Business
In addition to servicing the cur
rent Stanford students, Mrs. Bau
chou said the Bookstore does a
large mail-order business to Stan
ford alumni, who still get rebates.
"Once Stanford always Stanford,"
she said.
Mrs. Bauchou denied the rumor
about higher prices at the store,
which has a monopoly of campus
business. "Our book prices are
set by the publisher," she said.
