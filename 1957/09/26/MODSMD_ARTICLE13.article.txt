# Drum, Tank or Cheese Carton

### 
Students iiavf. returned to the Farm to find
a new building poking up among the other
buildings of the Ouad. The new structure is
the Science Lecture Building, and already spec
ulation is high concerning the""permanent"'
nickname which it seems destined to acquire.
A number of suggested nieknajnes have been
proposed by students, examples being "The
Drum," "The Water Tank' and even "The
Cottage Cheese Carton.""
On the serious side, the building is a wel
come addition to Stanford's teaching facilities
for the sciences, but its architecture clashes
with the adjacent buildings of the Ouad.
When the announcement was made last OcÂ«
1
toher concerning tlje plans for the Science

Lecture Building, supervising architect Eld
ridge T. Speneer said:
"The lecture building in designed to comple
ment the original quadrangle buildings in ar
chitectural form and to carry out the color of
the stone buildings."
It is difficult to see how the result could
complement anything hut storage tanks at an
oil refinery. Fortunately, plans for other new
science buildings in the area of "the tank
include the traditional style of architecture
(including red tile roofs) of evicting Stanford
buildings.
It is also hoped that future new structures
will be planned to truly complement the exist
ing campus, as do recently completed Dinkel
spiel Memorial Music Outer and Florence
Moore Hall.
