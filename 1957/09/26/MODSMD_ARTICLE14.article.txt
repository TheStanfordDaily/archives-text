Anger ihe Men of the Chaparral
Editor, The Daily:
Never in the course of human events has there
been such a ludicrous and ridiculous challenge
as that which appeared in yesterday's Daily.
The puny boys that put out this garbage-can lin
ing have dared to anger the Men of the Chapar
ral. These boys, of course, feared to challenge
us at the game in which we excel—that type of
football wherein it is necessary to ehug-a-lug a
bottle of beverage after each and every first
down; nevertheless, we will condescend to play
your child's game and by revamping our offense
no doubt clobber the bejebbers out of you. I hes
itate to print our tentative starting line-up for
fear that it would frighten the Daily boys away,
but in all honesty T feel that I must.
HUB: Ed, the Jet, Baker (206 lbs., 6-9)
LHB: Walloping Willie Wilson (267 lbs., 6-9)
KB: Kit, the Killer, Adams (189 lbs., 6-9"
QB: Y. A. Gleason (123 lbs., 6-9>
SB: Chick "Broken" Field (189 lbs., 6-9)
Mark, "Sledge," Hammer (468 lbs., 3-7)
Drawback: Belting Belton Fleisher
This is merely the starting lineup and does not
include our cheer-leading, proselyting and drink
ing teams. So beware, boys of The Daily, the
Men of the Chaparral are about to grind you
into the dust.
Signed: John, "Pappy," Elk
Coach, Hammer and Coffin Society
P.S. After our meeting this afternoon, we will
come up with Ihe rules under which we will con
sent to slaughter The Daily, but we felt that this
reply could wait no longer.

works, in which I am interested as a great work
of art.
I am twenty years of age, and I am studying
for my B.A. degree, l should be ever so grateful
to you if you could put me in contact with a

student at your college who is taking arts (liter
ature, history, economics, etc.). 1 should bo very
interested in the views and opinions of an Ameri
can student. I hope you will give your kind at
tention to my request if possible. Trusting to

Challenge to a Race
Editor, The Daily:
We are three undergraduates who have just
completed our first year at Worcester College,
Oxford, and we beg to enlist your support for a
scheme which would take place during the
months of July, August and September of 1958.
We send out a challenge to any members of
your University who may be interested for a
race, by road, from a point in the United States
on the 401h parallel to the town of Puerto
Monti in Chile.
The journey would be undertaken by each
party in a Land Rover, Jeep or other suitable
vehicle, and the route would be Ihe Pan Ameri
can Highway with transportation by boat on
sections where the road does not exist. The
race would be by stages—provisionally from
capital to capital, or other convenient points to
be decided upon later.
We would be grateful if you would give this
letter wide publicity and make our challenge
known to your undergraduates as soon as they
return from ihe summer vacation. We look for
ward to hearing from any people who are willing
to take up our challenge, and ask Ihem to write
as soon as possible.

Challenge to a Race
Editor, The Daily:
We are three undergraduates who have just
completed our first year at Worcester College,
Oxford, and we beg to enlist your support for a
scheme which would take place during the
months of July, August and September of 1958.
We send out a challenge to any members of
your University who may be interested for a
race, by road, from a point in the United States
on the 401h parallel to the town of Puerto
Monti in Chile.
The journey would be undertaken by each
party in a Land Rover, Jeep or other suitable
vehicle, and the route would be Ihe Pan Ameri
can Highway with transportation by boat on
sections where the road does not exist. The
race would be by stages—provisionally from
capital to capital, or other convenient points to
be decided upon later.
We would be grateful if you would give this
letter wide publicity and make our challenge
known to your undergraduates as soon as they
return from ihe summer vacation. We look for
ward to hearing from any people who are willing
to take up our challenge, and ask Ihem to write
as soon as possible.

Anger ihe Men of the Chaparral
Editor, The Daily:
Never in the course of human events has there
been such a ludicrous and ridiculous challenge
as that which appeared in yesterday's Daily.
The puny boys that put out this garbage-can lin
ing have dared to anger the Men of the Chapar
ral. These boys, of course, feared to challenge
us at the game in which we excel—that type of
football wherein it is necessary to ehug-a-lug a
bottle of beverage after each and every first
down; nevertheless, we will condescend to play
your child's game and by revamping our offense
no doubt clobber the bejebbers out of you. I hes

fear that it would frighten the Daily boys away,

Challenge to a Race
Editor, The Daily:
We are three undergraduates who have just
completed our first year at Worcester College,
Oxford, and we beg to enlist your support for a
scheme which would take place during the
months of July, August and September of 1958.
We send out a challenge to any members of
your University who may be interested for a
race, by road, from a point in the United States
on the 401h parallel to the town of Puerto
Monti in Chile.
The journey would be undertaken by each
party in a Land Rover, Jeep or other suitable
vehicle, and the route would be Ihe Pan Ameri
can Highway with transportation by boat on
sections where the road does not exist. The
race would be by stages—provisionally from
capital to capital, or other convenient points to
be decided upon later.
We would be grateful if you would give this
letter wide publicity and make our challenge
known to your undergraduates as soon as they
return from ihe summer vacation. We look for
ward to hearing from any people who are willing
to take up our challenge, and ask Ihem to write
as soon as possible.

Anger ihe Men of the Chaparral
Editor, The Daily:
Never in the course of human events has there
been such a ludicrous and ridiculous challenge
as that which appeared in yesterday's Daily.
The puny boys that put out this garbage-can lin
ing have dared to anger the Men of the Chapar
ral. These boys, of course, feared to challenge
us at the game in which we excel—that type of
football wherein it is necessary to ehug-a-lug a
bottle of beverage after each and every first
down; nevertheless, we will condescend to play
your child's game and by revamping our offense
no doubt clobber the bejebbers out of you. I hes
itate to print our tentative starting line-up for
fear that it would frighten the Daily boys away,
but in all honesty T feel that I must.
HUB: Ed, the Jet, Baker (206 lbs., 6-9)
LHB: Walloping Willie Wilson (267 lbs., 6-9)
KB: Kit, the Killer, Adams (189 lbs., 6-9"
QB: Y. A. Gleason (123 lbs., 6-9>
SB: Chick "Broken" Field (189 lbs., 6-9)
Mark, "Sledge," Hammer (468 lbs., 3-7)
Drawback: Belting Belton Fleisher
This is merely the starting lineup and does not
include our cheer-leading, proselyting and drink
ing teams. So beware, boys of The Daily, the
Men of the Chaparral are about to grind you
into the dust.
