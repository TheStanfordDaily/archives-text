## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (A'-> - Athletic
Direr-tor Wilbur Johns of UCLA
yesterday said his school is intent
tin going its own athletic way in
ihc future, and disclosed that ath
letic directors of the Pacific Coast
Conference once voted recom
mending that Commissioner Vic
tor O. Schmidt be dismissed.
Johns testified under oath be
fore a State Assembly subcom
mittee which is investigating Cali
fornia schools and their position
on the conference,
Johns did not say that UCLA
intended to withdraw from the

I conference, but repeated a state
ment made by the regents last
June which promised that UCLA
'would have full institutional con
trol of its athletic program.
Johns said this included sched
uling any opponent that UCLA
I chose. He admitted under ques
tioning that this would be con
trary to the PCC round-robin
| schedule.
Earlier in Johns' testimony the
name of Dean Orlando J. Hollis
jof the University of Oregon pop-
J ped up unexpectedly.
Johns said that at a PCC meet

ing aboard a boat from Seattle
to the May 1956 conference at
Victoria, 8.C., Mollis asked him
the terms of the contract held by
UCLA football coach Red San
ders. Johns did not say whether
he answered the question.
Sunders Bargained
Under questioning by Assem
blyman Charles Wilson of Los
Angeles. Johns said that a day or
so later at Victoria "a member
of the conference" told one of his
assistants that if Sanders were
fired ihere would be no penalties
against UCLA. Johns did not
identify either party.
Johns was asked if A 1 Masters,
athletic director at Stanford,
made the proposal.
Johns said any answer he might
give on this matter would be only
hearsay.
Feels Sanders to Blame
Last May at the PCC meeting
at Spokane the same inference—
get rid of Sanders and the pen
alties would be lifted —was repeat
ed, Johns continued, again not
identifying anyone involved.
Under further questioning,
Johns said he understood that op
position to Sanders was based on
the feeling that the coach was
aware of a UCLA booster club
which helped football players, in
violation of the PCC code, and
had done nothing about it.
USC Speaks
Earlier Earl Bolton, vice presi
dent of USC, appeared. In a pre
pared statement which reviewed
penalties imposed on his school,
Bolton said:
"The university has been on
record for some time indicating
its disfavor of compulsory com
petition based upon rules and reg
ulations such as a round-robin.
"The university has also been
on record for some time indicat
ing its disfavor of the control of
athletic programs and students
participating therein by fines and
sanctions. This is diametrically
opposed to the university's philos
ophy that a competent sports pro
gram should be predicated upon
mutual respect and good sports
manship.
Convince PCC
"The university is of the view
that every reasonable effort
should be made to convince the
PCC to accept these major prem
ises. A committee appointed by
the board of trustees is actively
at work on this program at the
present time."
Bolton said USC is opposed to
the creation of any state commis
sion which might try to regulate
intercollegiate athletes, and that
the colleges should be permitted
to work out their own problems.
Hollis Concurs
At Eugene, Hollis was asked to
comment on Johns' statement.
Hollis said: "Yes, I did ask
Johns what were terms of Mr.
Sanders' contract. That is not an
unusual question. I remember
that Johns told me that the terms
of the contract were secret and
that he could not reveal them.
"However," Hollis added, "I
never indicated to Johns or any
one else that there would be one
whit of change or difference in
penalties if Mr. Sanders contin
ued to be a member of the UCLA
staff."

Earlier in Johns' testimony the

Johns said that at a PCC meet

to the May 1956 conference at
Victoria, 8.C., Mollis asked him
the terms of the contract held by
UCLA football coach Red San

he answered the question.

Under questioning by Assem
blyman Charles Wilson of Los

so later at Victoria "a member
of the conference" told one of his
assistants that if Sanders were
fired ihere would be no penalties
against UCLA. Johns did not
identify either party.
Johns was asked if A 1 Masters,
athletic director at Stanford,
made the proposal.
Johns said any answer he might
give on this matter would be only
hearsay.
Feels Sanders to Blame
Last May at the PCC meeting
at Spokane the same inference—
get rid of Sanders and the pen
alties would be lifted —was repeat
ed, Johns continued, again not
identifying anyone involved.
Under further questioning,
Johns said he understood that op
position to Sanders was based on
the feeling that the coach was
aware of a UCLA booster club
which helped football players, in
violation of the PCC code, and
had done nothing about it.
USC Speaks
Earlier Earl Bolton, vice presi
dent of USC, appeared. In a pre
pared statement which reviewed
penalties imposed on his school,
Bolton said:
"The university has been on
record for some time indicating
its disfavor of compulsory com
petition based upon rules and reg
ulations such as a round-robin.
"The university has also been
on record for some time indicat
ing its disfavor of the control of
athletic programs and students
participating therein by fines and
sanctions. This is diametrically
opposed to the university's philos
ophy that a competent sports pro
gram should be predicated upon
mutual respect and good sports
manship.
Convince PCC
"The university is of the view
that every reasonable effort
should be made to convince the
PCC to accept these major prem
ises. A committee appointed by
the board of trustees is actively
at work on this program at the

Bolton said USC is opposed to
the creation of any state commis

intercollegiate athletes, and that
the colleges should be permitted
to work out their own problems.

"However," Hollis added, "I
