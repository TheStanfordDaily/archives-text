# Taylor Stresses Defense As Wildcat Season Nears
## 
### 
The emphasis on defense con
tinued on tin* Stanford practice
field yesterday as the Indians!
j moved toward Saturday's meet
ing with Northwestern at 2 p.m.
! in Stanford Stadium.
Coach C h u c k Taylor's first- j
j team ends and backs worked for
i 15 m in u t e s defending against
! Wildcat aerial plays as they were j
performed by the Indian fourth
| stringers.
Later in the drills, the entire
first squad set up its defenses
against Northwestern plays. The
Cards were still doing an extra
thorough job of getting them
selves ready for Bob McKeiver, '
the speedy little Wildcat halfback. ;
Ready for Quinn
Taylor also has his defenders
ready for the Wildcats' fullback
flanker series, which features Ed
die Quinn at the outside spot.
In between the defensive work
outs the Tribesmen went through
pass offense drills and also ran a
series of general offensive plays.
There were no changes in the
first string at yesterday's work
out. Dick Stein and Gary Van
Galder were at ends, John Kidd
j and Armand DeWeese at tackles.
Don Manoukian and Noel Robin
son at guards, and Russ Steele at
center.
The all-senior backfield was
composed of quarterback Jackie
Douglas, halfbacks. Jeri McMillin
; and A 1 Harrington, and fullback
j Lou Valli.
As game day nearer!, there ap

peared to be no definite trend es- |
tablishing as to a favorite. The j
Wildcats, of course, will be taking j
the field for the first time this :
year.
AP Taiis Wildcats
The Associated Press typified i
the general feeling that the game j
would be a toss-up. AP's selec
tion expert picked the Wildcats.
14-13, and commented that "these
teams are picked to finish about
sixth in their respective leagues.
So a nod to the Big Ten."
From Chicago, however, came
a statement by Northwestern
mentor Ara that the
Indians would have to be at their
best if they hoped to win. Par*
seghian regretted that his scout
didn't see more of Stanford's first j
team in action, but added that his i
man did see enough to report j
back that Lou Valli is a tremen-1
dous runner.
