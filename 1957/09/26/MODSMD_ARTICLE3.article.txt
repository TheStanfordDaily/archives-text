# P.A. Council, Stanford Clash Over Hospital
## Disagree on Space Development Plans For Center Wing 
### 
A conflict over the use of space
in the new Palo Alto â€¢ Stanford
Hospital came to light last night
between the Palo Alto City Coun
cil and the University.
The story as reported last
night in a local newspaper said
Councilman Burt L. Davis com
plained that the council had not
been informed of additions made
by Stanford to the center of the
building.
Original plans called for an un
developed area in the center of
the hospital to be used when the
hospital expands from 440 to 1000
beds.
Stanford had planned to use
the space to house temporarily
neurology and cardiology labora
tories until expansion is complet
ed.
R( vsponsibility
In an attempt to discover
where responsibility lay, The
Daily talked with Davis. Dr. Carl
A. Peterson, joint head of pathol
ogy, and Millon F. Johnson, Stan
ford's coordinator of program
ming and planning. The three
were quoted in the article.
Davis, a practicing physician
in Palo Alto, said the city council
had not been informed and as rep
resentatives of the taxpayers
should have been.
"Maybe it's an improvement, I
don't know,"he said. "If this
space is going to be used for tem
porary purposes, fine, but let us
know.
Peterson, a member of the
Stanford faculty and the hospital
staff, said that expansion could
become a major problem if all
parties concerned did not agree
on plans.
Me emphasized that original
plans calling for the vacant space
near the center of the hospital
had been approver! and signed by
Stanford and the city council and
that no further changes had been
made by the two parties.
Costly Move
He questioned the feasibility ol
moving an entire laboratory, say
ing that such a move could be
costly.
Milton F. Johnson of Stanford
said the building and moving of
the laboratory facilities were to
be financed entirely by Stanford
and the laboratories would them
selves provide clinical services.
Johnson went on to state that
'he original plans had not called
for "a roof and walls" as report
ed but that Stanford is building
them too.
Johnson attributed the entire
difficulty to the fact that the city
council has no full-time staff to
deal with the hospital as Stan
ford does.
