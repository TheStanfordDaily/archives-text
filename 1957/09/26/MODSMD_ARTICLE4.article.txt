# Chappie Accepts 'Challenge to Doom'; Infamous History of 'Old Boy' Exposed
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Since (The Daily refuses to sub
mit to the unpalatable and no
torious "now that") the "draw
back team" of Hammer and Cof
fin has accepted the Daily chal
lenge to doom, the time has come
to reveal to all the world the true
character of the Stanford Chap
pies and tf) expose the demon
demigod masquerading under the
pseudonym "The o'cl Boy."
Tradition has it that the Ham
mer and Coffin Society was born
on the eve of the earthquake of
'Ofj. As the Chappies tell the story,
nine of the Stanford Roughs gath
ered that night in Charlie Meyer's
Pub in Menlo with revolution in
their hearts.
The time had come, they
thought, to liberate the Chaparral
from meager supervision and un
warranted interference of the
Press Club.
Old Boy Morrie Oppenheim let
fly against the Press Club with
I he fruit of his mental exertions:
"We oughta sock 'em with a ham
mer, toss 'cm in a coffin and seal
'em away." Therein history was
made Chappie style.
The story goes on to tell how
Oppenheim and F. A. Curtin went
to bed plastered that night at the
Chi I'si house and woke up plas
tered as the San Francisco earth
quake began to shake the house
apart.
The Chappies have claimed
many famous men among their

alumni, including Herbert Hoover
Jr. and Bill Irwin, who bamboo
zled the University in 1922 by im
personating their famous fathers
over a fake radio-telephone hook
up from Washington, D.C.
11. and C. also claims the first
man to jump into the fountain in
Union Court fully dressed (Henry
Mack in 1924); the man who
named the Campanile "the musi
cal silo" (Bill Wright. 19231; t'he
first man to attend the Military
Ball in a Boy Scout uniform ( Noel
de Nevers, 19531; the first man to
slide flown the fire pole in Union
Square Garage in full evening
dress while singing the "Marseil
laise" (Tom Timbcrlake, 1953);
and, for reasons of their own,
Governor Knight, Bruce Bliven
and Doodles Weaver.
In 1956 Ihe 11. and C. boys cele
brated the 50th anniversary of the
publication of the Chaparral. In
fine feathered style, they an
nounced the coming of their April
is; ue, an informal history of their
publication from then to now.
But the Hammer and Coffin
pledge:; were living up to Ihe old
I radii ion.
They hijacked the whole issue
on its way back from the Univer
sity Press and kidnapped Helton
Fleischer, who was circulation
manager. Fleischer was chained
in a stock and deposited in front
of 'I he Daily.
The Daily business manager, as

suming that the whole incident
was a puerile stunt staged for
publicity purposes, secured a
hacksaw and freed Fleischer from
his ignominy but too late.
The freshmen had absconded
with the magazines, which ap
peared on the newsstands a day
late—for the first time in Chappie
history, so they say.
This was in 1951 under the editor-
Once, and only once, was the
Chappie suspended for poor taste,
ship of Stan Norton, when the
"Purple Ape" Crash Comics miss
ed approval by Ihe administra
tion.
Last, quoted price on this issue
is $2.
Chappie was allowed to resume
publication upon presentation of
a list of ethical rules which they
agreed if follow. They missed
only their June issue.
As business in a n a g e r John
Motheral remarked al the time.
"College presidents come and go,
but the Old Boy lives on!"

Since (The Daily refuses to sub
mit to the unpalatable and no
torious "now that") the "draw
back team" of Hammer and Cof
fin has accepted the Daily chal
lenge to doom, the time has come
to reveal to all the world the true
character of the Stanford Chap
pies and tf) expose the demon
demigod masquerading under the
pseudonym "The o'cl Boy."
Tradition has it that the Ham
mer and Coffin Society was born
on the eve of the earthquake of
'Ofj. As the Chappies tell the story,
nine of the Stanford Roughs gath
ered that night in Charlie Meyer's
Pub in Menlo with revolution in
their hearts.
The time had come, they
thought, to liberate the Chaparral
from meager supervision and un
warranted interference of the
Press Club.
Old Boy Morrie Oppenheim let
fly against the Press Club with
I he fruit of his mental exertions:
"We oughta sock 'em with a ham
mer, toss 'cm in a coffin and seal
'em away." Therein history was
made Chappie style.
The story goes on to tell how
Oppenheim and F. A. Curtin went
to bed plastered that night at the
Chi I'si house and woke up plas
tered as the San Francisco earth
quake began to shake the house
apart.
The Chappies have claimed
many famous men among their

alumni, including Herbert Hoover
Jr. and Bill Irwin, who bamboo
zled the University in 1922 by im
personating their famous fathers
over a fake radio-telephone hook
up from Washington, D.C.
11. and C. also claims the first
man to jump into the fountain in
Union Court fully dressed (Henry
Mack in 1924); the man who
named the Campanile "the musi
cal silo" (Bill Wright. 19231; t'he
first man to attend the Military
Ball in a Boy Scout uniform ( Noel
de Nevers, 19531; the first man to
slide flown the fire pole in Union
Square Garage in full evening
dress while singing the "Marseil
laise" (Tom Timbcrlake, 1953);
and, for reasons of their own,
Governor Knight, Bruce Bliven
and Doodles Weaver.
In 1956 Ihe 11. and C. boys cele
brated the 50th anniversary of the
publication of the Chaparral. In
fine feathered style, they an
nounced the coming of their April
is; ue, an informal history of their
publication from then to now.
But the Hammer and Coffin
pledge:; were living up to Ihe old
I radii ion.
They hijacked the whole issue
on its way back from the Univer
sity Press and kidnapped Helton
Fleischer, who was circulation
manager. Fleischer was chained
in a stock and deposited in front
of 'I he Daily.
The Daily business manager, as

suming that the whole incident
was a puerile stunt staged for
publicity purposes, secured a
hacksaw and freed Fleischer from
his ignominy but too late.
The freshmen had absconded
with the magazines, which ap
peared on the newsstands a day
late—for the first time in Chappie
history, so they say.
This was in 1951 under the editor-
Once, and only once, was the
Chappie suspended for poor taste,
ship of Stan Norton, when the
"Purple Ape" Crash Comics miss
ed approval by Ihe administra
tion.

is $2.
