## Troops' Actions' 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (/!') I'aul
Downs, a 35-year-old combat vet
eran of World War 11 and Korea,
: sat dourly on a porch near Cen
tral High School yesterday and
I asked, "What are they trying to
' do to us?"
The slender, unemployed sales
i man, who was wounded in an
| arm, said a paratrooper '"bayo
neted me in the arm because I
i wouldn't move fast enough.
"'l'm from the South. I don't
I move very fast,' " Downs said lie
told the soldier.
Downs said the wound required
'several stitches.
"I was just down here to see
how this whole thing was turning
I out," the Spririgdale, Ark., man
j said.
"Rest of Them"
"I was like the rest of them
| watching, waiting, tense."
! Downs, who quit his job here
two days ago, said a specialist
1 first class among the troops made
the bayonet thrust at him.
"After ho got me. I grabbed my
arm and walked off. What else
| could I do?" he asked.
"I realize that guy was worried.
He had his orders," Downs said.
"In Korea I've held bayonets on
j civilian Koreans," he added.
But, Downs said, "that is not
the way to treat these people."
Turning to newsmen, he said:
"You boys can get me an inter
| view with the commander, can't
you? I want to see him and tell
I him he's using the wrong tactics.
"R;iw bayonets ain't the an
swer."

Asked by a newsman vvhal lie
intended to do about the incident,
Downs said: "II I have to go get
a gun, I'll make an issue of it. I
j can't kill them all, but I can gel
: some of them."
; A few minutes later, however,
: he said he had simply decided to
sue t he government.
'I think I've got a ease."
Asked if he had bled profuse
i ly, Downs waved a hand toward
j the sidewalk and said: "Sure I
lost plenty of blood. If you don't
I believe me look at the sidewalk."
