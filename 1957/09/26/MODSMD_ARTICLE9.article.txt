# Torch Bearers Race Tomorrow In Olympic Events
## 
### 
The 10th annual Olympic Day
torch race will be run tomorrow,
amid cheers from yell leaders,
new routines by the song leaders,
and general encouragement from
sideline observers and the car car
avan which will follow the run
ners from the Collar to Mangini's
Barn.
The torch race was inaugurated
during "Back to the Farm" fes
tivities in 194.1. The torch was
passed by IS men along a route
which crossed Lake Lag by canoe
and ended at Rossotti's, where the
flame was safely deposited in an
abandoned toilet bowl.
Temporarily discontinued after
1946, the marathon was reinslilut
ed in 1950 and has been carried
out faithfully since then. Year by
year special features have been
started and then dropped. Beer,
baseball games, chug-a-lug eon
tests and "all the beer you can
drink free" contests went their
way, leaving the race itself as the*
last survivor of "Back to the
Fa I'm."
Tho days of "Back in the Farm"
with the old-car parades, the old
clothes and a general revival of
traditions have given way to the
laissez-faire rally. Tomorrow it
will be "Skin the Wildcats" as
Olympic Day begins the North
western game rally.
