The RC-88 Garrard is the latest model in the Garrard
line, a line that has been synonymous with high fidelity
since the very first days of good music reproduction. This
moderately priced record changer is ideal as either a high
fidelity component or as a replacement unit in an older
phonograph console.
The RC-88 Carrard will treat your records gently and
perform its job with a preciseness that denotes quality
beyond its price.
Come in for a demonstration of the Carrard in High
Fidelity Unlimited's acoustically designed sound demon
stration room. Priced at only $54.50.
