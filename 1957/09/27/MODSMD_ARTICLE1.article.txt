# PCC-Big 10 Battle In TV Game of Week
## Northwestern, Stanford Clash Here Saturday Taylor Refuses to Make Prediction; Oddsmakers Rate Game as Toss-up 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The "Now Look" Stanford Indians meet their first real test of
the 1057 gridiron season tomorrow at 2 p.m. when the Wildcats of
Northwestern invade Stanford Stadium. The contest, rated in bet
ting circles as dead-even, will be .seen nationally via NBC-television.
Card Coach Chuck Taylor is going right along with the "toss-up"

theory of the so-called experts,
lie won't make any predictions
about the game, except to say that
there will be one and that it
should be close and exciting.
There is actually little or no
basis for making either club a
favorite. Northwestern hasn't had
a game, yet this fall, and the
Cards didn't have much of one
last Saturday when they tr&mpled
San Jose State. 46-7.
The Wildcats, of course, have
had all fall to prepare for tomor
row's game. And if the iron cur
tain that surrounded their work
out yesterday afternoon is any in
dication, the Indians will be in
for plenty of surprises.
The Northwestern party arrived
in Palo Alto yesterday, and the
team proceeded directly to a
workout in Stanford Stadium.
There were team managers sta
tioned at strategic locations to
ward off observers. The guards
explained briefly that "we want
to keep this workout as secret as
possible."
Over in the Stanford camp
there was nothing in the way of a
secret workout. The Cards didn't
have any roligh stuff in yester
day's drills aj they just ran
through plays and pass patterns.
Most of the men who are expected
to see plenty of action tomorrow
didn't even bother wearing pads.
Same Starters
Taylor has nominated the same
starting lineup to face the Wild
cats as opened against San Jose a
week ago. It will consist of Joel
Freis and Gary Van Galder at
ends, John Kidd and Armand De-
Weese at tackles, Don Manoukian
and Noel Robinson at guards and
Russ Steele at center.
Jackie Douglas will open at
quarterback for the Tribe, with
A 1 Harrington at right halfback
and Jeri McMillin at left half, the
flanker spot. Lou Valli will be at
his usual fullback slot.
Tomorrow's encounter will be a
key one for the Cards in that it
will give an indication of whether
or not they are going to be a sur
prise contender for the Pacific
Coast Conference title.
Eyebrows Raised
At the start of the season Stan
ford was picked for a sixth- or
seventh-place finish in the PCC.
But after last week's rout of San

Jose a few eyebrows began to lift.
Many experts lightly dismissed
the lopsided Stanford win as more
a result of the Spartans' inability
than any great play by the Tribe.,
But there were certain things
about the Indians' style of play
against San Jose that gave plenty
of encouragement to their follow
ers. Most important, Stanford was
tackling hard, quick and in gang
fashion. *
The second part of the Indians'
"New Look" was their varied at
tack, with the emphasis on the
running game. Even with the best
passer in the country flipping
aerials for them last year, the
Cards could still just win four of
10 games.
More Versatility
This year a complementing run
ning attack and a more rugged
line may be able to combine with
the usually-good passing game to
bring Stanford a few more vic
tories.
Although picked to finish only
sixth in the Big Ten, Northwest
ern still shapes up as one of the
better teams from the Midwest.
Last year, under the direction
of newcomer Ara Parseghian, the
Wildcats surprised the experts by
compiling a .500 record on the
season and finishing sixth in a
league where they had been the
doormat for the past couple of
years.
Lots of Sophs
There's no doubt that Parse
ghian will be depending heavily
on sophomores this year. Twenty
seven of his 50 players are only
second-year men. and three of
them will be in the starting line
up tomorrow.
The top individual duel should
be the battle for ground-gaining
honors that will be waged be
tween the Indians' Lou Valli and
the Wildcats' Bob McKeiver.
Valli, although playing only
about 20 minutes of last week's
game, gained 103 yards in just 12
carries. Last year he was the
second-leading ball carrier in the
PCC and is set to bid for the No. 1
spot in the '57 campaign.

Parseghian Is well aware of
Valli'.s abilities and has said that
his Wildcats will have to hold the
Stanford ace somewhat in check
if they are to win.
Tribe Watches McKeiver
While the 'Cats worry about
Valli, the Indians will have their
defensive minds on McKeiver. the
speedy little left-hall'hack from
Northwestern.
He may well be the best "little
man" currently cavorting on the
nat i on's gridirons. McKeiver
stands just 5-4V 2 , but weighs a
solid 158 pounds.
Last fall he was considered the
most versatile back in the Big
Ten. He carried for a 5.2 average,
punted almost 40 yards on each
effort to lead the conference, led
Northwestern in scoring with 38
points, and even kicked a field
goal.
McKeiver also kicked extra
points and kicked off, and aver
aged nearly 10 yards every time
he returned a punt. He also re
turned kickoffs an average of 22.8
yards.
Other Threats
Despite their apparent great
ness, Valli and McKeiver are by
no means the only threats who
will be in the backfields tomor
row.
Helping to carry the Indians'
attack will be one of the West's
most explosive runners, A 1 Har
rington. Last year, as a second
stringer, Harrington came into
many a ball game and quickly
ripped off gains of 6, 8 or 10
yards.
This year he has firmly en
trenched himself in the first
string and appears headed for a
tremendous senior year.
Junior Willmer Fowler poses
the second definite backfield
threat which the Tribe will have
to solve. His speed is attested to
by his 100- and 220-yard-dash vic
tories in the Big Ten track cham
pionships last spring. He rushed
for a good 4.8 average in 1956 and
won ihe Illinois game with a spec
tacular 34-yard run.
Both Use Flankers
Stanford will have Jeri McMil
lin operating from a halfback
flanker position, while the 'Cats
will sometimes use fullback Eddie
Quinn at the outside post.
McMillin looked great against
San Jose in the pass-catching de
partment, particularly with his
leaping grab of a touchdown toss
in the second period.
Much of Stanford's time spent

on defensive positioning has been
aimed at stopping the flanker
play of Quinn, a very powerful
runner.
Both teams are well fixed in
the quarterback department, al
though the Indians have a defi
nite edge in experience. In Jackie
Douglas, Taylor has a proven
team general and a man who
knows how to throw the ball.
Jackie Can Kim
Douglas can also run well—as
he demonstrated on several oc
casions last week.
There's one mark that Stanford
will have a rugged time keeping
intact — their record of having
held Northwestern scoreless on
the two occasions the teams have
met. In 1933 the clubs played a
scoreless deadlock, but the Indi
ans won in 1934, 20-0.
Now, 23 years later, the Cards
hope they can repeat the victory
of 1934.

the 1057 gridiron season tomorrow at 2 p.m. when the Wildcats of
Northwestern invade Stanford Stadium. The contest, rated in bet
ting circles as dead-even, will be .seen nationally via NBC-television.
Card Coach Chuck Taylor is going right along with the "toss-up"

theory of the so-called experts,
lie won't make any predictions
about the game, except to say that
there will be one and that it
should be close and exciting.
There is actually little or no
basis for making either club a
favorite. Northwestern hasn't had
a game, yet this fall, and the
Cards didn't have much of one
last Saturday when they tr&mpled
San Jose State. 46-7.
The Wildcats, of course, have
had all fall to prepare for tomor
row's game. And if the iron cur
tain that surrounded their work
out yesterday afternoon is any in
dication, the Indians will be in
for plenty of surprises.
The Northwestern party arrived
in Palo Alto yesterday, and the
team proceeded directly to a
workout in Stanford Stadium.
There were team managers sta
tioned at strategic locations to
ward off observers. The guards
explained briefly that "we want
to keep this workout as secret as
possible."
Over in the Stanford camp
there was nothing in the way of a
secret workout. The Cards didn't
have any roligh stuff in yester
day's drills aj they just ran
through plays and pass patterns.
Most of the men who are expected
to see plenty of action tomorrow
didn't even bother wearing pads.
Same Starters
Taylor has nominated the same
starting lineup to face the Wild
cats as opened against San Jose a
week ago. It will consist of Joel
Freis and Gary Van Galder at
ends, John Kidd and Armand De-
Weese at tackles, Don Manoukian
and Noel Robinson at guards and
Russ Steele at center.
Jackie Douglas will open at
quarterback for the Tribe, with
A 1 Harrington at right halfback
and Jeri McMillin at left half, the
flanker spot. Lou Valli will be at
his usual fullback slot.
Tomorrow's encounter will be a
key one for the Cards in that it
will give an indication of whether
or not they are going to be a sur
prise contender for the Pacific
Coast Conference title.
Eyebrows Raised
At the start of the season Stan
ford was picked for a sixth- or
seventh-place finish in the PCC.
But after last week's rout of San

Jose a few eyebrows began to lift.
Many experts lightly dismissed
the lopsided Stanford win as more
a result of the Spartans' inability
than any great play by the Tribe.,
But there were certain things
about the Indians' style of play
against San Jose that gave plenty
of encouragement to their follow
ers. Most important, Stanford was
tackling hard, quick and in gang
fashion. *
The second part of the Indians'
"New Look" was their varied at
tack, with the emphasis on the
running game. Even with the best
passer in the country flipping
aerials for them last year, the
Cards could still just win four of
10 games.
More Versatility
This year a complementing run
ning attack and a more rugged
line may be able to combine with
the usually-good passing game to
bring Stanford a few more vic
tories.
Although picked to finish only
sixth in the Big Ten, Northwest
ern still shapes up as one of the
better teams from the Midwest.
Last year, under the direction
of newcomer Ara Parseghian, the
Wildcats surprised the experts by
compiling a .500 record on the
season and finishing sixth in a
league where they had been the
doormat for the past couple of
years.
Lots of Sophs
There's no doubt that Parse
ghian will be depending heavily
on sophomores this year. Twenty
seven of his 50 players are only
second-year men. and three of
them will be in the starting line
up tomorrow.
The top individual duel should
be the battle for ground-gaining
honors that will be waged be
tween the Indians' Lou Valli and
the Wildcats' Bob McKeiver.
Valli, although playing only
about 20 minutes of last week's
game, gained 103 yards in just 12
carries. Last year he was the
second-leading ball carrier in the
PCC and is set to bid for the No. 1
spot in the '57 campaign.

Parseghian Is well aware of
Valli'.s abilities and has said that
his Wildcats will have to hold the
Stanford ace somewhat in check
if they are to win.
Tribe Watches McKeiver
While the 'Cats worry about
Valli, the Indians will have their
defensive minds on McKeiver. the
speedy little left-hall'hack from
Northwestern.
He may well be the best "little
man" currently cavorting on the
nat i on's gridirons. McKeiver
stands just 5-4V 2 , but weighs a
solid 158 pounds.
Last fall he was considered the
most versatile back in the Big
Ten. He carried for a 5.2 average,
punted almost 40 yards on each
effort to lead the conference, led
Northwestern in scoring with 38
points, and even kicked a field
goal.
McKeiver also kicked extra
points and kicked off, and aver
aged nearly 10 yards every time
he returned a punt. He also re
turned kickoffs an average of 22.8
yards.
Other Threats
Despite their apparent great
ness, Valli and McKeiver are by
no means the only threats who
will be in the backfields tomor
row.
Helping to carry the Indians'
attack will be one of the West's
most explosive runners, A 1 Har
rington. Last year, as a second
stringer, Harrington came into
many a ball game and quickly
ripped off gains of 6, 8 or 10
yards.
This year he has firmly en
trenched himself in the first
string and appears headed for a
tremendous senior year.
Junior Willmer Fowler poses
the second definite backfield
threat which the Tribe will have
to solve. His speed is attested to
by his 100- and 220-yard-dash vic
tories in the Big Ten track cham
pionships last spring. He rushed
for a good 4.8 average in 1956 and
won ihe Illinois game with a spec
tacular 34-yard run.
Both Use Flankers
Stanford will have Jeri McMil
lin operating from a halfback
flanker position, while the 'Cats
will sometimes use fullback Eddie
Quinn at the outside post.
McMillin looked great against
San Jose in the pass-catching de
partment, particularly with his
leaping grab of a touchdown toss
in the second period.
Much of Stanford's time spent

on defensive positioning has been
aimed at stopping the flanker
play of Quinn, a very powerful
runner.
Both teams are well fixed in
the quarterback department, al
though the Indians have a defi
nite edge in experience. In Jackie
Douglas, Taylor has a proven
team general and a man who
knows how to throw the ball.
Jackie Can Kim
Douglas can also run well—as
he demonstrated on several oc
casions last week.
There's one mark that Stanford
will have a rugged time keeping
intact — their record of having
held Northwestern scoreless on
the two occasions the teams have
met. In 1933 the clubs played a
scoreless deadlock, but the Indi
ans won in 1934, 20-0.
Now, 23 years later, the Cards
hope they can repeat the victory
of 1934.

ting circles as dead-even, will be .seen nationally via NBC-television.
Card Coach Chuck Taylor is going right along with the "toss-up"

theory of the so-called experts,
lie won't make any predictions
about the game, except to say that
there will be one and that it
should be close and exciting.
There is actually little or no
basis for making either club a
favorite. Northwestern hasn't had
a game, yet this fall, and the
Cards didn't have much of one
last Saturday when they tr&mpled
San Jose State. 46-7.
The Wildcats, of course, have
had all fall to prepare for tomor
row's game. And if the iron cur
tain that surrounded their work
out yesterday afternoon is any in
dication, the Indians will be in
for plenty of surprises.
The Northwestern party arrived
in Palo Alto yesterday, and the
team proceeded directly to a
workout in Stanford Stadium.
There were team managers sta
tioned at strategic locations to
ward off observers. The guards
explained briefly that "we want
to keep this workout as secret as
possible."
Over in the Stanford camp
there was nothing in the way of a
secret workout. The Cards didn't
have any roligh stuff in yester
day's drills aj they just ran
through plays and pass patterns.
Most of the men who are expected
to see plenty of action tomorrow
didn't even bother wearing pads.
Same Starters
Taylor has nominated the same
starting lineup to face the Wild
cats as opened against San Jose a
week ago. It will consist of Joel
Freis and Gary Van Galder at
ends, John Kidd and Armand De-
Weese at tackles, Don Manoukian
and Noel Robinson at guards and
Russ Steele at center.
Jackie Douglas will open at
quarterback for the Tribe, with
A 1 Harrington at right halfback
and Jeri McMillin at left half, the
flanker spot. Lou Valli will be at
his usual fullback slot.
Tomorrow's encounter will be a
key one for the Cards in that it
will give an indication of whether
or not they are going to be a sur
prise contender for the Pacific
Coast Conference title.
Eyebrows Raised
At the start of the season Stan
ford was picked for a sixth- or
seventh-place finish in the PCC.
But after last week's rout of San

Jose a few eyebrows began to lift.
Many experts lightly dismissed
the lopsided Stanford win as more
a result of the Spartans' inability
than any great play by the Tribe.,
But there were certain things
about the Indians' style of play
against San Jose that gave plenty
of encouragement to their follow
ers. Most important, Stanford was
tackling hard, quick and in gang
fashion. *
The second part of the Indians'
"New Look" was their varied at
tack, with the emphasis on the
running game. Even with the best
passer in the country flipping
aerials for them last year, the
Cards could still just win four of
10 games.
More Versatility
This year a complementing run
ning attack and a more rugged
line may be able to combine with
the usually-good passing game to
bring Stanford a few more vic
tories.
Although picked to finish only
sixth in the Big Ten, Northwest
ern still shapes up as one of the
better teams from the Midwest.
Last year, under the direction
of newcomer Ara Parseghian, the
Wildcats surprised the experts by
compiling a .500 record on the
season and finishing sixth in a
league where they had been the
doormat for the past couple of
years.
Lots of Sophs
There's no doubt that Parse
ghian will be depending heavily
on sophomores this year. Twenty
seven of his 50 players are only
second-year men. and three of
them will be in the starting line
up tomorrow.
The top individual duel should
be the battle for ground-gaining
honors that will be waged be
tween the Indians' Lou Valli and
the Wildcats' Bob McKeiver.
Valli, although playing only
about 20 minutes of last week's
game, gained 103 yards in just 12
carries. Last year he was the
second-leading ball carrier in the
PCC and is set to bid for the No. 1
spot in the '57 campaign.

Parseghian Is well aware of
Valli'.s abilities and has said that
his Wildcats will have to hold the
Stanford ace somewhat in check
if they are to win.
Tribe Watches McKeiver
While the 'Cats worry about
Valli, the Indians will have their
defensive minds on McKeiver. the
speedy little left-hall'hack from
Northwestern.
He may well be the best "little
man" currently cavorting on the
nat i on's gridirons. McKeiver
stands just 5-4V 2 , but weighs a
solid 158 pounds.
Last fall he was considered the
most versatile back in the Big
Ten. He carried for a 5.2 average,
punted almost 40 yards on each
effort to lead the conference, led
Northwestern in scoring with 38
points, and even kicked a field
goal.
McKeiver also kicked extra
points and kicked off, and aver
aged nearly 10 yards every time
he returned a punt. He also re
turned kickoffs an average of 22.8
yards.
Other Threats
Despite their apparent great
ness, Valli and McKeiver are by
no means the only threats who
will be in the backfields tomor
row.
Helping to carry the Indians'
attack will be one of the West's
most explosive runners, A 1 Har
rington. Last year, as a second
stringer, Harrington came into
many a ball game and quickly
ripped off gains of 6, 8 or 10
yards.
This year he has firmly en
trenched himself in the first
string and appears headed for a
tremendous senior year.
Junior Willmer Fowler poses
the second definite backfield
threat which the Tribe will have
to solve. His speed is attested to
by his 100- and 220-yard-dash vic
tories in the Big Ten track cham
pionships last spring. He rushed
for a good 4.8 average in 1956 and
won ihe Illinois game with a spec
tacular 34-yard run.
Both Use Flankers
Stanford will have Jeri McMil
lin operating from a halfback
flanker position, while the 'Cats
will sometimes use fullback Eddie
Quinn at the outside post.
McMillin looked great against
San Jose in the pass-catching de
partment, particularly with his
leaping grab of a touchdown toss
in the second period.
Much of Stanford's time spent

on defensive positioning has been
aimed at stopping the flanker
play of Quinn, a very powerful
runner.
Both teams are well fixed in
the quarterback department, al
though the Indians have a defi
nite edge in experience. In Jackie
Douglas, Taylor has a proven
team general and a man who
knows how to throw the ball.
Jackie Can Kim
Douglas can also run well—as
he demonstrated on several oc
casions last week.
There's one mark that Stanford
will have a rugged time keeping
intact — their record of having
held Northwestern scoreless on
the two occasions the teams have
met. In 1933 the clubs played a
scoreless deadlock, but the Indi
ans won in 1934, 20-0.
Now, 23 years later, the Cards
hope they can repeat the victory
of 1934.

theory of the so-called experts,
lie won't make any predictions
about the game, except to say that
there will be one and that it
should be close and exciting.
There is actually little or no
basis for making either club a
favorite. Northwestern hasn't had
a game, yet this fall, and the
Cards didn't have much of one
last Saturday when they tr&mpled
San Jose State. 46-7.
The Wildcats, of course, have
had all fall to prepare for tomor
row's game. And if the iron cur
tain that surrounded their work
out yesterday afternoon is any in
dication, the Indians will be in
for plenty of surprises.
The Northwestern party arrived
in Palo Alto yesterday, and the
team proceeded directly to a
workout in Stanford Stadium.
There were team managers sta
tioned at strategic locations to
ward off observers. The guards
explained briefly that "we want
to keep this workout as secret as
possible."
Over in the Stanford camp
there was nothing in the way of a
secret workout. The Cards didn't
have any roligh stuff in yester
day's drills aj they just ran
through plays and pass patterns.
Most of the men who are expected
to see plenty of action tomorrow
didn't even bother wearing pads.
Same Starters
Taylor has nominated the same
starting lineup to face the Wild
cats as opened against San Jose a
week ago. It will consist of Joel
Freis and Gary Van Galder at
ends, John Kidd and Armand De-
Weese at tackles, Don Manoukian
and Noel Robinson at guards and
Russ Steele at center.
Jackie Douglas will open at
quarterback for the Tribe, with
A 1 Harrington at right halfback
and Jeri McMillin at left half, the
flanker spot. Lou Valli will be at
his usual fullback slot.
Tomorrow's encounter will be a
key one for the Cards in that it
will give an indication of whether
or not they are going to be a sur
prise contender for the Pacific
Coast Conference title.
Eyebrows Raised
At the start of the season Stan
ford was picked for a sixth- or
seventh-place finish in the PCC.
But after last week's rout of San

Jose a few eyebrows began to lift.
Many experts lightly dismissed
the lopsided Stanford win as more
a result of the Spartans' inability
than any great play by the Tribe.,
But there were certain things
about the Indians' style of play
against San Jose that gave plenty
of encouragement to their follow
ers. Most important, Stanford was
tackling hard, quick and in gang
fashion. *
The second part of the Indians'
"New Look" was their varied at
tack, with the emphasis on the
running game. Even with the best
passer in the country flipping
aerials for them last year, the
Cards could still just win four of
10 games.
More Versatility
This year a complementing run
ning attack and a more rugged
line may be able to combine with
the usually-good passing game to
bring Stanford a few more vic
tories.
Although picked to finish only
sixth in the Big Ten, Northwest
ern still shapes up as one of the
better teams from the Midwest.
Last year, under the direction
of newcomer Ara Parseghian, the
Wildcats surprised the experts by
compiling a .500 record on the
season and finishing sixth in a
league where they had been the
doormat for the past couple of
years.
Lots of Sophs
There's no doubt that Parse
ghian will be depending heavily
on sophomores this year. Twenty
seven of his 50 players are only
second-year men. and three of
them will be in the starting line
up tomorrow.
The top individual duel should
be the battle for ground-gaining
honors that will be waged be
tween the Indians' Lou Valli and
the Wildcats' Bob McKeiver.
Valli, although playing only
about 20 minutes of last week's
game, gained 103 yards in just 12
carries. Last year he was the
second-leading ball carrier in the
PCC and is set to bid for the No. 1
spot in the '57 campaign.

Parseghian Is well aware of
Valli'.s abilities and has said that
his Wildcats will have to hold the
Stanford ace somewhat in check
if they are to win.
Tribe Watches McKeiver
While the 'Cats worry about
Valli, the Indians will have their
defensive minds on McKeiver. the
speedy little left-hall'hack from
Northwestern.
He may well be the best "little
man" currently cavorting on the
nat i on's gridirons. McKeiver
stands just 5-4V 2 , but weighs a
solid 158 pounds.
Last fall he was considered the
most versatile back in the Big
Ten. He carried for a 5.2 average,
punted almost 40 yards on each
effort to lead the conference, led
Northwestern in scoring with 38
points, and even kicked a field
goal.
McKeiver also kicked extra
points and kicked off, and aver
aged nearly 10 yards every time
he returned a punt. He also re
turned kickoffs an average of 22.8
yards.
Other Threats
Despite their apparent great
ness, Valli and McKeiver are by
no means the only threats who
will be in the backfields tomor
row.
Helping to carry the Indians'
attack will be one of the West's
most explosive runners, A 1 Har
rington. Last year, as a second
stringer, Harrington came into
many a ball game and quickly
ripped off gains of 6, 8 or 10
yards.
This year he has firmly en
trenched himself in the first
string and appears headed for a
tremendous senior year.
Junior Willmer Fowler poses
the second definite backfield
threat which the Tribe will have
to solve. His speed is attested to
by his 100- and 220-yard-dash vic
tories in the Big Ten track cham
pionships last spring. He rushed
for a good 4.8 average in 1956 and
won ihe Illinois game with a spec
tacular 34-yard run.
Both Use Flankers
Stanford will have Jeri McMil
lin operating from a halfback
flanker position, while the 'Cats
will sometimes use fullback Eddie
Quinn at the outside post.
McMillin looked great against
San Jose in the pass-catching de
partment, particularly with his
leaping grab of a touchdown toss
in the second period.
Much of Stanford's time spent

on defensive positioning has been
aimed at stopping the flanker
play of Quinn, a very powerful
runner.
Both teams are well fixed in
the quarterback department, al
though the Indians have a defi
nite edge in experience. In Jackie
Douglas, Taylor has a proven
team general and a man who
knows how to throw the ball.
Jackie Can Kim
Douglas can also run well—as
he demonstrated on several oc
casions last week.
There's one mark that Stanford
will have a rugged time keeping
intact — their record of having
held Northwestern scoreless on
the two occasions the teams have
met. In 1933 the clubs played a
scoreless deadlock, but the Indi
ans won in 1934, 20-0.
Now, 23 years later, the Cards
hope they can repeat the victory
of 1934.
