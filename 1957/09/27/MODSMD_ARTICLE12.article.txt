## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/P) —The United States is sure it can
muster enough support to block proposals in the United Nations for
ending nuclear tests without waiting for agreement on other dis
armament measures.
Diplomatic sources reported this yesterday as disarmament came

to the fore both in UN General
Assembly debate and behind-the
scenes negotiations.
Informants said that the United ]
States sounded out UN diplomats j
and is convinced the 82-nation As
sembly will reject proposals by
India, the Soviet Union and Japan
for ending tests of nuclear weap
ons.
India tried to make its pro
posal more palatable to the Unit
ed States and Britain by dropping
any reference to "immediate and
unconditional" acceptance of a
ban. India proposed that the Unit
ed States, Britain and the Soviet
Union set up a joint, scientific
commission to supervise a ban on
tests.
The U.S. view is that a two
year suspension of tests could be
declared immediately if there
were "agreement in principle" on
other Western proposals for par
tial disarmament. These include
adequate inspection machinery
and an end to production of fis
sionable materials for weapons of
war.
