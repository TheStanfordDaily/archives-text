# Cheer, Jeer or Do Something
## 
### 
Today Stanford students celebrate one of their
traditional "Back to the Farm" festivities. In
fact, the Olympic Day torch race is tl»e sole
Furviving pageant from what used to be a full
wepk of activity.
Perhaps the hallowed atmosphere of con
genial Mangini's Barn is the reason for the
continuance of this remaining vestige. Just the
idea of a couple of hours of leisure on a hot
afternoon in pleasant Mangini's is enough to
cause numerous palates to water.
The magnificent prospect of watching 20
toga-clad seniors —your Daily editor among
them —skipping gracefully over hill and dale
holding high the torch of freedom (or is it.
knowledge?) will undoubtedly bring hordes of
students out to cheer, jeer or do something, if
only indulge iu refreshments and the general
gaiety.
Undoubtedly there are, throughout the cam
pus area, small groups of disinterested do
nothings who frown upon such "adolescent"
behavior among University "adults,'" but these

people are to be pitie<l rather than admired for
their "maturity."
We become adults only too soon. To imitate
adult behavior is, in many eases, quite admir
able. But let's have some fun while we re doing
it. Let's not grow old before our time.
Isn't there an old saying to the effect that if
you are working, work hard; but when you are
playing, play hard? This is good advice lor all
of us. An afternoon of happy-go-luekiness is
certainly not out of character for any Stanford
student, graduate or undergraduate.
Besides, the Torch Race is the opening gun
for the Stanford-Northwestern football game
rally. Rallies are good. Spirits can he raised
quite harmlessly to a fever pitch of excitement
and confidence. There's nothing so inspiring
to a team on the field as the feeling of excite
ment and confidence that emanates to them
from the stands.
So head for Mangini's Barn this afternoon
and join the festivities. Enter into the spirit
of Ihe whole thing, ("hanees are you'll feel
much more like studying afterward.
