# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Barbara Hicks
## Trek Back to Colleges 
### 
Wlir-n tho bolls cry "Back to School" and the
hallowed campus halls make ready to embrace
now and old residents, thousands of students
throw their Ivy League shirts and skirts into a
suitcase and make the anual trek back to col
logos and universities all over iho nation.
When they arrive back at those institutions of
higher learning, thoy find problems confronting
them which are not of an academic nature. For
instance, the San Francisco State College Golden
Gator, the Oregon Daily Emerald and the Daily
Kansan of Kansas University are all bemoaning
the parking problem in their columns this week.
% « *
The Gator points out to tho students that $50,*
000 would buy a lovely acre of land on which to
make a parking lot. To turn this land into a lot
would cost around 20 cents a square foot, not a
very wise investment. Being wise, the slate has
chosen not to invest so "tho parking lot situation
for S.F. State students will get a lot worse."
At Kansas IJ faculty members, heretofore only
reported to their superiors in the case of park
ing violations, will be paying fines just like the
/.tudents in an effort to ease the parking situa
tion. The University of Oregon has parking me
ters "only in the university 'business district'"
by the Student Union. A new area has been pro

vided for parking and others expanded, but the
"parking lot situation will still be crowded."
A San Francisco State student is one of the
party of American students touring Red China,
against tho advice of the U.S. Slate Department.
After an.interview with Ginger Mattox's father,
the SFS Golden Gator reported that he thinks
it's a wonderful opportunity for his daughter and
is not afraid that she will be corrupted by Com
munist propaganda. The Gator observes that
"We all read the newspapers about the tender
and innocent American college students almost
certain to be warped by their first whiff of Rus
sian air, hypnotized by Bulganin and Company.
Soon the tone changed. Why would they want to
go to Moscow at all, unless they were—well,
pink—already? Curiosity was apparently an ob
solete word in American dictionaries," says the
Gator in defending the travelers.
« U
Larry Boston, editorial writer for the Kansas
University Daily, takes a firm stand on the seg
regation-integration question in Arkansas. "Gov
ernor Faubus is wrong. Where there was no
violence before the troops came, there is violence
now. The best way to prevent violence is to obey
the law, not flout it. Federal court officials have
ruled that Little Rock's schools should be inte
grated. It should be done," Boston insists.
