# CAMPUS DRIVING RULES GIVEN
## Students Alone Register 4500 of 6000 Registered Cars—And More Each Day 
### 
Have you wondered about the
ncredible multitude of automo
biles infesting the Stanford cam
pus this year?
According to the campus Po
lice Department, 4404 student ve
hicles had been registered by last
Wednesday and more are being
•egistered every day.
This figure does not include
/ehicles of faculty and campus
employees (of which 1661 have
)een registered). Therefore, there
ire a few problems with parking
>n the Farm.
Police Chief Gordon Davis
urges campus drivers to read the
oamphlet on rules and regula
tions, and to study the colored
parking maps which were pro
vided at the time of registration,
if students need one or both, they
ire available at the police office.
Failure to avail oneself of this
information will not be an excuse
for violations, for it is the driv
er's responsibility to be familiar
with rules. After the violation
has been issued it's too late.
Flagrant disregard for campus
traffic regulations may result in
loss of the privilege of driving a
car on campus.
It is mandatory that all cam
pus vehicles be registered with
the Police Department. Registra
tion will continue until Oct. 4, a
week from today. Automobiles
registered after that time will be
subject to a double fee plus the

cost of a citation for operating
an auto without registration.
Those registrants who apply
for registration stickers after that
date must have in their posses
sion a sales contract, bill of sale
or similar evidence that they
have just purchased the car. In
such cases the fee but no penalty
will apply.
Chief Davis stresses that regis
tration stickers should be applied
properly to the inside of the rear
window of the automobile, where
it would be easily visible from
the rear approach, or on the
windshield. The only time the
sticker should be placed.on the
windshield would be in the case
of a convertible having a cloth
top.
He added that students should
not park .on the left side of the
street in front of the Post Office
if driving from the row. All traf
fic around the Post Office must
be one way: traffic east from the
Firehouse to the row, for exam
ple, must pass between the Post
Office and the Music Auditorium.
It has been brought to the at
tention of the Police Department
that several persons have placed
these stickers backward, on the
outside of car windows, and, as a
result, they have been lost. In the
event of loss, another sticker
must be purchased immediately.
Due to the great number of
registered campus vehicles, on

campus students arc urged to
walk to and from class; or, if liv
ing on the upper row, students!
may park in the lot diagonally
across from Physics Corner, in
that section of the lot assigned
for on-campus vehicles.
