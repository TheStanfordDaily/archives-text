# Stanford's 110 Marching Musicians Set for Nationwide TV Appearance
## 
### Bob Ellis 
Stanford's 110-piece marching
band will take the field for its
first regular appearance of the
year tomorrow at the nationally
televised Northwestern game.
The half time stunts will be or
ganized along a Stanford theme
dedicated to Stanford alumni and
friends all over the nation who
will be watching the game.
A high school band from El
Cerrito will represent North
western, but, except for the play
ing of the national anthem dur
ing pro-game activities, the Stan
ford Band will be the only one on
the field.
First Performance
Having their first performance
broadcast on nationwide televi
sion has put a lot of pressure on
band members to perfect stunts
and get the group in shape early.
With time for only three rehear
sals, about six hours, the bands
rnrn have had to work hard.
If one should be in the vicinity
of the varsity football practice
Vfield some evening and hear the
sound of music and drums beat
ing, it's just the band practicing.
Practice sessions are sched
uled every Tuesday night for
two or three hours, and a short
one on Saturday morning to pol
ish up the stunts. If a big game
is coming up extra sessions may
be called. Bandsmen must also
spend time on individual prac
tice.
USC and UCLA bands feel that
they cannot put on an adequate
performance with a small
amount of practice, so they won't
take the field with less than three
weeks of rehearsal.
Stunts Tomorrow
Stunts to be used tomorrow
and at other games this year
were decided upon last spring by
the band's stunt committee, head
ed by Student Manager Ed Best.
During the summer and early au
tumn he laid out a tentative po
sition for each man on the field.
After each game an executive
board meets with band director
.Julius E. Shuchat to make final
plans.
At Tuesday night's rehearsal
rach bandsman gets a sheet for
each stunt for the next game
showing the locations of all mem
bers, and if the stunt involves
movement, this is also indicated.
The band then has until Satur
day to learn the music and the
movements.
At Stanford the football band
has the unusual position of being
partially an extra-curricular ac
tivity and partially a class. At
most universities the marching

band is a regular class meeting
three to five days a week for a
few units of credit. A large por
tion of the members are majors.
Two Music Majors
Only two Stanford music ma
jors are members of the band.
About half are majoring in engi
neering, and a large number are
pre - med or pre - legal students.
For the most part, members play
in the band because it provides
relaxation from studying, accord
ing to Best.
Best and his assistant, Dave
Korten, are amazed at the spirit
this year. Shuchat, starting his
12th year as director, said, "This
is the best bunch for co-opera
tion, musicianship and trying to
march I think we've ever had."
The band performs at all home
games, managing to get a group
together for games the Saturday
before registration, although the
members have to come back to
campus early and stay at their
own expense. And of course they
are always on hand for the Big
Game.
The one big trip of the year is
to Los Angeles when the team
plays USC or UCLA. This is paid

for by the Department of Ath
letics.
In addition, part of the band is
frequently on hand to lend some
of its spirit to campus events.
About 25 members have volun
teered to play this afternoon at
the Olympic Day rally.

During the summer and early au
tumn he laid out a tentative po
sition for each man on the field.
After each game an executive
board meets with band director
.Julius E. Shuchat to make final
plans.
At Tuesday night's rehearsal
rach bandsman gets a sheet for
each stunt for the next game
showing the locations of all mem
bers, and if the stunt involves
movement, this is also indicated.
The band then has until Satur

At Stanford the football band
has the unusual position of being
partially an extra-curricular ac
tivity and partially a class. At
most universities the marching

band is a regular class meeting
three to five days a week for a
few units of credit. A large por
tion of the members are majors.
Two Music Majors
Only two Stanford music ma
jors are members of the band.
About half are majoring in engi
neering, and a large number are
pre - med or pre - legal students.
For the most part, members play
in the band because it provides
relaxation from studying, accord
ing to Best.
Best and his assistant, Dave
Korten, are amazed at the spirit
this year. Shuchat, starting his
12th year as director, said, "This
is the best bunch for co-opera
tion, musicianship and trying to
march I think we've ever had."
The band performs at all home
games, managing to get a group
together for games the Saturday
before registration, although the
members have to come back to
campus early and stay at their
own expense. And of course they
are always on hand for the Big
Game.
The one big trip of the year is
to Los Angeles when the team
plays USC or UCLA. This is paid

for by the Department of Ath
letics.
In addition, part of the band is
frequently on hand to lend some
of its spirit to campus events.
About 25 members have volun
teered to play this afternoon at
the Olympic Day rally.


FANFARE STARTS PREGAME PROGRAM BY STANFORD MARCHING BAND
Stanford's 110-piece marching
band will take the field for its
first regular appearance of the
year tomorrow at the nationally
televised Northwestern game.
The half time stunts will be or
ganized along a Stanford theme
dedicated to Stanford alumni and
friends all over the nation who
will be watching the game.
A high school band from El
Cerrito will represent North
western, but, except for the play
ing of the national anthem dur
ing pro-game activities, the Stan
ford Band will be the only one on
the field.
First Performance
Having their first performance
broadcast on nationwide televi
sion has put a lot of pressure on
band members to perfect stunts
and get the group in shape early.
With time for only three rehear
sals, about six hours, the bands
rnrn have had to work hard.
If one should be in the vicinity
of the varsity football practice
Vfield some evening and hear the
sound of music and drums beat
ing, it's just the band practicing.
Practice sessions are sched
uled every Tuesday night for
two or three hours, and a short
one on Saturday morning to pol
ish up the stunts. If a big game
is coming up extra sessions may
be called. Bandsmen must also
spend time on individual prac
tice.
USC and UCLA bands feel that
they cannot put on an adequate
performance with a small
amount of practice, so they won't
take the field with less than three
weeks of rehearsal.
Stunts Tomorrow
Stunts to be used tomorrow
and at other games this year
were decided upon last spring by
the band's stunt committee, head
ed by Student Manager Ed Best.
