Arc high taxes reducing your incentive to work harder and earn more?

If you're one of the more than 65 million
Americans who hold down a job, you probably
work about 40 hours a week.
But did you ever stop to consider that taxes
are so high today you work for yourself only
27 of those 40 hours? The other 13 go to pay
your share of the cost of government.
No one expects to live without taxes,
obviously. But when they take more than SI 10
billion, or about one dollar out of every three
earned, something's wrong. *
i You pay these taxes in more ways than you
know, too. *
.r-
If you lived in California, for instance, made 1

$7,500 last year, and listed a wife and two
children as dependents, you were taxed these
ways to start with: Federal income $875, Social
Security $95, State income $25, Property tax
$325, Auto license tax $40, State and Local
sales tax $75 and Telephone tax $10.
< This adds up to $1445 and it's'only the
beginning.
Did you buy a car? Figure another $175 tax/
The tax on the gasoline to run your car was at
least $65. You also paid a 10% tax every time
you bought a plane or train ticket or spent a
dollar at the movies. h
And you're still not through. Because every

company that made anything you bought had'
to pay taxes on practically everything that
went into the product.
These thousands of indirect faxes were eventually
jasscd on to you as part of the cost of your purchases.
> The result? At least one-third of what you
earned went to pay some form of taxes. ..*â– 
The real danger is obvious: taxes this high
may be so discouraging that you have less
incentive to work harder, earn more money
and produce more.
