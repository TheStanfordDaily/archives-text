NEW YORK (/P)—Mickey Man
tle and Bill Skowron remained bo
hind when the New York Yankees
left yesterday for their last road
trip of the season—a three-day
visit to Boston.
Manager Casey Stengel said he
wanted to give both men a chance
to rest at home for the World
Series that opens Wednesday
against the Milwaukee Braves.
"There's no use taking them to
Boston if they can't play," said
Stengel. "The important thing
now is the World Series." ■
Mantle still is badly handicap
ped when he has to hit left-handed
against a right-handed pitcher.
The switcher isn't bothered when
he bats right-handed, so presuma
bly he will be ready to swing free
ly Wednesday if Warren Spahn, a
southpaw, starts for Milwaukee,
as expected. Mickey's left leg, in
shin splints, still bothers him.
Although Mantle is expected to
be ready to play in the Series,
hobbled or not, there is no cer
tainty about Skowron. He injured
his back several weeks ago and
tried to play too soon. As a result
of the re-injury he has been un
able to bend freely.
