# Hammarskjold Gets 2nd Term As UN Head
## Council Unanimously Chooses Peacemaker; No Other Candidates 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/P)
Dag Hammarskjold, Swedish
practitioner of "quiet diplomacy,"
was named yesterday to a second
five-year term as secretary gen
eral of the UN.
The 52-year-old bachelor diplo
mat won the unanimous recom
mendation of the 11-nation Secu
rity Council and the approval of
the 82-nation General Assembly.
Israel was absent because of
the Rosh Hashonah holiday, but
sent word it endorsed his re-elec
tion. One ballot was invalid.
Hammarskjold's reappointment
proved he had kept the friend
ship of nations large and small,
Communist and non-Communist,
through continued cold war, the
windup of the Korean conflict
and last fall's Middle Eastern and
Hungarian hostilities.
It also reflected his success in
getting 15 U.S. airmen out of Chi
nese Communist prisons in 1955
and in reaching agreement with
Egypt for the U.N. to send in an
emergency force and clearing the
Suez Canal after the British-
French and Israeli invasions in
1956.
There were no other candi
dates for his job. His new term
starts next April 10. He draws
salary and allowances totaling
$55,000, tax free.
