They Weren't So Dumb
Who says football players are dumb?
Was anyone rise intelligent enough to return to campus three
weeks early to insure his getting an Asiatic flu inoculation?
This is not to say, of course, that, the shots were the only reason
for the gridders' early return, or that the footballers necessarily were
clamoring for the shots.
Tackle Eric Protiva, for one, would just as soon have passed up
the gratis shots. Afior being sidelined for two and a half days with
a "reaction" to mandatory tetanus shots the previous week, Eric
came through the Asiatic ordeal in good shape. lie missed only one
day of practice.
The shots were given on a "for the good of the team" basis which
seemed all the more intelligent after Florida was forced to cancel its
opener with UCLA because of the epidemic.
With the Stanford gridders all housed on an upper floor of Toyon,
and all eating in the Los Arcos dining room, a case for one might
have meant a case for all.
Especially with the athletes constantly near exhaustion during
the first three weeks of practice.
It was during this pre-school period that coaches had to get the
team in top condition and separate them into squads on the basis of
their showing so everyone was showing.
Two practices a day was the rule during the first two weeks, with
single practices scheduled about every third day during thai period
and during the third week.
The two-a-day schedule opened with 6:45 breakfast. Following
that were practice, 8-10:30; lunch, noon; practice, 4-6:30; dinner, 7;
and a meeting at 8 p.m. When one adds 45 minutes before and a
half-hour after each practice to cover dressing, taping, showering,
etc., one can see that each day was well taken care of.
Single-practice days were less demanding, with breakfast at 8:30,
a morning meeting and a scrimmage commencing at 2:30 p.m.
Movie Houses Made Money
Only diversion open to the footballers besides locker-room banter,
knocking the Rembrandt caricatures on the Los Arcos walls and
watching TV in the eating clubs' lobby was an occasional trip to the
local movie houses. The Park, Stanford and Cardinal admitted the
gridmen free of charge and so got the bulk of their trade.
The only other break in the three-week routine was a barbecue
at the Atherton home of Adrian Stickney, hosted by that Peninsula
restaurateur for the team and coaches after the first Saturday
scrimmage.
Generally, however, all was business, with plays to learn or sleep
to garner, And shots from which to recuperate.
Let's Look Hack Further
Don't know why they stopped at 1954 with that "Stanford Hosts
Big Ten Team on National TV" theory in Tuesday's Daily.
Those exact conditions prevailed when the Indians met Michigan
in 1952. Taylor's troops found the Wolverine roadshow as hammy
as those of Illinois and Ohio State to follow, as they trounced the
Big Tenners, 14-7.
The only difference in that case was that they also beat Michigan
in Ann Arbor, 23-13, in 1951.
Contrary to the loudly-expressed feelings of Stanfords in the
stands, the referee correctly (a.< always!) called the roughing the
kicker penalty on Ben Robinson.
Ben ALMOST blocked the second-quarter punt, and he MADE
AN EFFORT to avoid spilling the San Jose punter, but the rule book
does not leave this up to the referee's discretion.
To quote the good book: "When it is reasonably obvious that a
scrimmage kick will be made, no opponent shall rough the kicker,
or the holder of a place kick. . . . Contact which is slight or is caused
by the kicker's own motion or which results when a scrimmage kick
is blocked or partially blocked shall not be construed as roughing."

a morning meeting and a scrimmage commencing at 2:30 p.m.
Movie Houses Made Money
Only diversion open to the footballers besides locker-room banter,
knocking the Rembrandt caricatures on the Los Arcos walls and
watching TV in the eating clubs' lobby was an occasional trip to the
local movie houses. The Park, Stanford and Cardinal admitted the
gridmen free of charge and so got the bulk of their trade.
The only other break in the three-week routine was a barbecue
at the Atherton home of Adrian Stickney, hosted by that Peninsula
restaurateur for the team and coaches after the first Saturday
scrimmage.
Generally, however, all was business, with plays to learn or sleep
to garner, And shots from which to recuperate.
Let's Look Hack Further
Don't know why they stopped at 1954 with that "Stanford Hosts
Big Ten Team on National TV" theory in Tuesday's Daily.
Those exact conditions prevailed when the Indians met Michigan
in 1952. Taylor's troops found the Wolverine roadshow as hammy
as those of Illinois and Ohio State to follow, as they trounced the
Big Tenners, 14-7.
The only difference in that case was that they also beat Michigan
in Ann Arbor, 23-13, in 1951.
Contrary to the loudly-expressed feelings of Stanfords in the
stands, the referee correctly (a.< always!) called the roughing the
kicker penalty on Ben Robinson.
Ben ALMOST blocked the second-quarter punt, and he MADE
AN EFFORT to avoid spilling the San Jose punter, but the rule book
does not leave this up to the referee's discretion.
To quote the good book: "When it is reasonably obvious that a
scrimmage kick will be made, no opponent shall rough the kicker,
or the holder of a place kick. . . . Contact which is slight or is caused
by the kicker's own motion or which results when a scrimmage kick
is blocked or partially blocked shall not be construed as roughing."
(Rule 9, Section 2. Article 2.)
They Weren't So Dumb
Who says football players are dumb?
Was anyone rise intelligent enough to return to campus three
weeks early to insure his getting an Asiatic flu inoculation?
This is not to say, of course, that, the shots were the only reason
for the gridders' early return, or that the footballers necessarily were
clamoring for the shots.
Tackle Eric Protiva, for one, would just as soon have passed up
the gratis shots. Afior being sidelined for two and a half days with
a "reaction" to mandatory tetanus shots the previous week, Eric
came through the Asiatic ordeal in good shape. lie missed only one
day of practice.
The shots were given on a "for the good of the team" basis which
seemed all the more intelligent after Florida was forced to cancel its
opener with UCLA because of the epidemic.
With the Stanford gridders all housed on an upper floor of Toyon,
and all eating in the Los Arcos dining room, a case for one might
have meant a case for all.
Especially with the athletes constantly near exhaustion during
the first three weeks of practice.
It was during this pre-school period that coaches had to get the
team in top condition and separate them into squads on the basis of
their showing so everyone was showing.
Two practices a day was the rule during the first two weeks, with
single practices scheduled about every third day during thai period
and during the third week.
The two-a-day schedule opened with 6:45 breakfast. Following
that were practice, 8-10:30; lunch, noon; practice, 4-6:30; dinner, 7;
and a meeting at 8 p.m. When one adds 45 minutes before and a
half-hour after each practice to cover dressing, taping, showering,
etc., one can see that each day was well taken care of.
Single-practice days were less demanding, with breakfast at 8:30,
a morning meeting and a scrimmage commencing at 2:30 p.m.
