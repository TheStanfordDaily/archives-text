# Viola Bids for All-American; QB Holcomb Key Man for â€™Cals
## 
### 
Senior A 1 Viola will probably
be the backbone of Norlhwest
ern's stout defensive line this sea
son. Standing iust 5-10, he won
All-Big Ton honors and All-Amer
ican honorable mention last year.
With another season like last
year, the rugged 205-pound guard
could turn up on All-American
lists this fall.
Viola set a Northwestern rec
ord by recovering five fumbles in
the Purdue game and assured the
Wildcats of a scoreless tie
agai n s t Minnesota when he
tackled Ken Bonbardier so hard
on the goal line that the Gopher
back fumbled and Northwestern
recovered. This ex - Marine star
broke into the scoring column in
the Ohio State game when he re
covered a blocked punt behind
the goal line for a safety.
Great speed, agility, hard work
and excellent attitude are the
qualities that have made Viola
one of the outstanding college
linemen in the country. "His per
formance stamps him as one of
our finest linemen," says Coach
Ara Parseghian, "and one of the
great guards in football today."
Hailing from Maynard, Mass.,
he is a senior in the School of
Speech where he has maintained
a B scholastic average.

One of the few starting sopho
more quarterbacks in the nation
will be in action Saturday when
Northwestern invades Stanford
Stadium. He's Chip Holcomb, a
19-year-old second-year man who
shows promise of becoming a
great quarterback during there
! mainder of his collegiate career.
Holcomb, son of Northwestern
athletic director Stu Holcomb, is
rated an excellent passer, and as
such should give iho Wildcats
a much more serious aerial
threat than they had last season.
In contrast to the bullet-pass
type of thrower, I-lolComb is not
ed for his soft, easy -to - catch
passes. He also has excellent tim
ing sense, enabling him to load
receivers well.
Holcomb and two other sophs,
John Talley and Bert Fredrick,
have been waging a three-way
battle all during preseason drills
to take over the quarterback slot
vacated by last year's regulars,
Dale Pienta and Jack Ellis.
And these three aren't the only
second-year players Coach Ara
Parseghian is. banking on for
i help. Twenty-seven of the 50 men
jon the team are sophomores,
ivvith two others starting and a
big batch of them on the second
I string.
