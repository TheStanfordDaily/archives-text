Since Oklahoma won't be mo
nopoli/.ing football attention this
weekend, fans can turn their at
tention to three or four games
which may have far-reaching ef
fects. Or they can 101 l in front of
their TV sets and watch Stanford
and Northwestern in a contest
which likely will be interesting
but inconclusive.
The big ones, from a national
viewpoint, at this early stage of
the season are Auburn :it Tennes
see, Southern Methodist at Geor
•gia Tech, Houston at Baylor and
Washington at Minnesota. On a
slightly lesser scale there's Vir
ginia Tech at West Virginia—a
game that could decide the South
ern Conference championship al
most before the race starts.
Oklahoma Rests
Top - rated Oklahoma, after
rushing the season with an im
pressive 26-0 victory over Pitts
burgh, takes a week off. But Sat
urday marks the opening of the
season for the Big Ten teams, in
cluding a couple of contenders
for Oklahoma's No. 1 spot; the
Ivy League and a couple of oth
er biggies like Notre Dame and
Tennessee.
Tennessee's 19f>6 Southeastern
Conference champions run smack
into one of the leading contend
ers, Auburn. It's the first game
of toh season for both teams and
there's not much line on it ex
cept that Tennessee no longer lias
Johnny Majors while Auburn is
said to be stronger than last year.
SMU Look for No. Two
. Georgia Tech, winner over
Kentucky last week, faces a
Southern Methodist team which
opened Bill Meek's new coaching
regime with a smart 13-6 victory
over California.
Houston pulled off a surprise
last week by beating Miami of
Florida and now faces highly
rated Baylor, which edged' unex
pectedly good Villanova. A vic
tory for either likely would bring
a big jump in the ratings. In the
Southwest Conference, Baylor
now is listed just behind the
Texas Aggies, who play Texas
Tech Saturday.
Huskies Go East
Minnesota, already on ihe spot
as pre-season favorite in the Big
Ten, opens against Washington,
which played a 6-6 tie with Colo
rado last week. Notre Dame,
where Terry Brennan is on a bit
of a spot after a wretched 1956
season, visits Purdue • for its
opener. The slightly-favored Ir
ish almost have to win this one
to keep their fans from becoming
mutinous.
Illinois, first Big Ten team in
action, plays UCLA at Los Ange
les Friday night. Michigan, co
favorite with Minnesota, plays
S )uthern California in the same
city Saturday. Other Big Ten
openers are Indiana at Michigan
State, Utah State at lowa, Texas
Christian at Ohio Slate and Mar
quette at Wisconsin.
