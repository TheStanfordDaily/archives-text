# ENDOWMENTS FAIL TO MEET RISING COSTS
## Income Sources Are Inadequate 
### Rita Robison 
The financing of higher educa
tion has received much attention
during the past two decades, not
only from officers of institutions
but also from others interested in
the welfare of higher education.
Four principal sources of cur
rent incomes are endowment
earnings, philanthropic gifts, stu
dent fees and government appro
priations. The total income de
rived from these and other
sources determines the budget of
the college or university.
Endowments are held chiefly by
privately controlled institutions,
such as Stanford. The amount of
endowment in individual institu
tions ranges from only a few
thousand dollars up to the $303,-
955,186 reported by Harvard Uni
versity as of June 30, 1955.
Endowment fund principals of
Harvard ($304 million), Yale
($152 million), Columbia ($95 mil

lion), M.I.T. <$72 million), Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
($7l million), Northwestern ($63
million) and Princeton ($5B mil
lion) rank above Stanford's $54
million endowment, while Cornell
($52 million), California Institute
of Technology ($3O million), Uni
versity of Michigan ($23 million)
and Ohio State ($ll million) rank
lower.
The amount of support for the
current educational program de
rived from endowment invest
ments has been seriously affected
by the declining rates of interest.
The 1953-54 estimate, the latest
available from library sources, is
5.4 per cent.
Philanthropic gifts for current
purposes have never provided a
large percentage of the total in
come of higher education in the
United States, donors preferring
to give their money for capital
purposes, such as endowment or

building, rather than for the sup
port of current expenditures.
Many institutions are now giv
ing more attention than formerly
to this source of support, encour
aging friends and alumni to con
tribute to an annual financial
campaign, the proceeds of which
are available for any purpose. The
amount of income for American
colleges and universities from pri
vate gifts and grants in 1953-54
was over $191 million.
The government presently
bears the burden of providing 42.5
per cent of the financial support
of America's colleges and univer
sities. The program by which the
federal government undertook to
provide education for veterans of
World War 11, through the pay
ment of their fees and a subsist
ence allowance, has transferred
much of the burden of the sup
port of higher education from stu
dents to government.
Paying Less Than Half
However, the practice of collect
ing tuition and fees from students
—who are, after all, the main ben
efactors of institutions of higher
learning—is almost universal
among U.S. colleges and univer
sities. Stanford students are well
aware that their former tuition
fee of $750 is being increased to
$1005 per year,-beginning autumn
quarter, 1958.
In spite of this increase in tui
tion, students are assured that,
even so, t+iey are paying for less
than half of what their education
at Stanford costs the University.
Upon investigating tuition fees of
other comparable colleges and
universities, both privately en
dowed, as Stanford, and state
owned, the following is found to
be true:
Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hop
kins, M.1.T., New York U., Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Princeton
and Yale have tuition fees higher
than those of Stanford, while Co
lumbia, with the same, is followed
by California Institute of Tech
nology, U. of California at Berke
ley, Northwestern, Penn State U.
and Ohio State, which list lower
tuition rates.
Comparatively Lower
Not only is Stanford's tuition
rate substantially lower than
those of comparable institutions
throughdut the country, but of
the $5.5 million received in stu
dent fees last year at Stanford,
half a million dollars' worth of
student aid was expended. Simi
larly, Harvard earmarks approxi
mately one-fifth of tuition receiv
ed for student aid, Yale one
eighth, M.I.T. one-fourth, North
western one-sixth, Princeton one
fifth and Cornell one-eighth.
In view of the facts, Stanford

students may no longer feel jus
tified in protesting the tuition in
crease. The question arises in
stead, "Where do universities get
the money necessary to their
maintenance and functioning at
present high standards?" Gifts,
grants and endowments are the
answer.
In order to facilitate such gifts
and endowments, the Council for
Financial Aid to Education was
founded in 1952 in New York by
businessmen and educators. It
provides information concerning
the financial needs of colleges and
universities, trends in business
support of higher education, and
appeals for support from institu
tions of higher education; assists
business corporations or groups
in formulating plans for financial
aid to colleges and Universities;
and assists institutions of higher
learning in developing appeals for
support from corporations.
The council does not solicit or
distribute contributions, however.
Through similar agencies may
lie the answer to the financial
dilemma facing American colleges
and universities today. Perhaps
with an awareness of the "un
favorable balance of trade"—e.g.,
too many students coming in for
facilities, too much money being
spent to replace worn-out or out
dated equipment and in salaries
for instructors, compensated or
balanced not at all by the tuitions,
fees, grants, endowments, etc.—
perhaps with an awareness of this
problem now, the impending edu
cational crisis of tomorrow may
be averted.

kins, M.1.T., New York U., Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Princeton
and Yale have tuition fees higher
than those of Stanford, while Co
lumbia, with the same, is followed
by California Institute of Tech
nology, U. of California at Berke
ley, Northwestern, Penn State U.
and Ohio State, which list lower
tuition rates.
Comparatively Lower
Not only is Stanford's tuition
rate substantially lower than
those of comparable institutions
throughdut the country, but of
the $5.5 million received in stu
dent fees last year at Stanford,
half a million dollars' worth of
student aid was expended. Simi
larly, Harvard earmarks approxi
mately one-fifth of tuition receiv
ed for student aid, Yale one
eighth, M.I.T. one-fourth, North
western one-sixth, Princeton one
fifth and Cornell one-eighth.
In view of the facts, Stanford

students may no longer feel jus
tified in protesting the tuition in
crease. The question arises in
stead, "Where do universities get
the money necessary to their
maintenance and functioning at
present high standards?" Gifts,
grants and endowments are the
answer.
In order to facilitate such gifts
and endowments, the Council for
Financial Aid to Education was
founded in 1952 in New York by
businessmen and educators. It
provides information concerning
the financial needs of colleges and
universities, trends in business
support of higher education, and
appeals for support from institu
tions of higher education; assists
business corporations or groups
in formulating plans for financial
aid to colleges and Universities;
and assists institutions of higher
learning in developing appeals for
support from corporations.
The council does not solicit or
distribute contributions, however.
Through similar agencies may
lie the answer to the financial
dilemma facing American colleges
and universities today. Perhaps
with an awareness of the "un
favorable balance of trade"—e.g.,
too many students coming in for
facilities, too much money being
spent to replace worn-out or out
dated equipment and in salaries
for instructors, compensated or
balanced not at all by the tuitions,
fees, grants, endowments, etc.—
perhaps with an awareness of this
problem now, the impending edu
cational crisis of tomorrow may
be averted.
The financing of higher educa
tion has received much attention
during the past two decades, not
only from officers of institutions
but also from others interested in
the welfare of higher education.
Four principal sources of cur
rent incomes are endowment
earnings, philanthropic gifts, stu
dent fees and government appro
priations. The total income de
rived from these and other
sources determines the budget of
the college or university.
Endowments are held chiefly by
privately controlled institutions,
such as Stanford. The amount of
endowment in individual institu
tions ranges from only a few
thousand dollars up to the $303,-
955,186 reported by Harvard Uni
versity as of June 30, 1955.
Endowment fund principals of
Harvard ($304 million), Yale
($152 million), Columbia ($95 mil

lion), M.I.T. <$72 million), Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
($7l million), Northwestern ($63
million) and Princeton ($5B mil
lion) rank above Stanford's $54
million endowment, while Cornell
($52 million), California Institute
of Technology ($3O million), Uni
versity of Michigan ($23 million)
and Ohio State ($ll million) rank
lower.
The amount of support for the
current educational program de
rived from endowment invest
ments has been seriously affected
by the declining rates of interest.
The 1953-54 estimate, the latest
available from library sources, is
5.4 per cent.
Philanthropic gifts for current
purposes have never provided a
large percentage of the total in
come of higher education in the
United States, donors preferring
to give their money for capital
purposes, such as endowment or

building, rather than for the sup
port of current expenditures.
Many institutions are now giv
ing more attention than formerly
to this source of support, encour
aging friends and alumni to con
tribute to an annual financial
campaign, the proceeds of which
are available for any purpose. The
amount of income for American
colleges and universities from pri
vate gifts and grants in 1953-54
was over $191 million.
The government presently
bears the burden of providing 42.5
per cent of the financial support
of America's colleges and univer
sities. The program by which the
federal government undertook to
provide education for veterans of
World War 11, through the pay
ment of their fees and a subsist
ence allowance, has transferred
much of the burden of the sup
port of higher education from stu
dents to government.
Paying Less Than Half
However, the practice of collect
ing tuition and fees from students
—who are, after all, the main ben
efactors of institutions of higher
learning—is almost universal
among U.S. colleges and univer
sities. Stanford students are well
aware that their former tuition
fee of $750 is being increased to
$1005 per year,-beginning autumn
quarter, 1958.
In spite of this increase in tui
tion, students are assured that,
even so, t+iey are paying for less
than half of what their education
at Stanford costs the University.
Upon investigating tuition fees of
other comparable colleges and
universities, both privately en
dowed, as Stanford, and state
owned, the following is found to
be true:
Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hop

and Ohio State ($ll million) rank
lower.
The amount of support for the
current educational program de
rived from endowment invest
ments has been seriously affected
by the declining rates of interest.
The 1953-54 estimate, the latest
available from library sources, is
5.4 per cent.
Philanthropic gifts for current
purposes have never provided a
large percentage of the total in
come of higher education in the
United States, donors preferring
to give their money for capital
purposes, such as endowment or

building, rather than for the sup
port of current expenditures.
Many institutions are now giv
ing more attention than formerly
to this source of support, encour
aging friends and alumni to con
tribute to an annual financial
campaign, the proceeds of which
are available for any purpose. The
amount of income for American
colleges and universities from pri
vate gifts and grants in 1953-54
was over $191 million.
The government presently
bears the burden of providing 42.5
per cent of the financial support
of America's colleges and univer
sities. The program by which the
federal government undertook to
provide education for veterans of
World War 11, through the pay
ment of their fees and a subsist
ence allowance, has transferred
much of the burden of the sup
port of higher education from stu
dents to government.
Paying Less Than Half
However, the practice of collect
ing tuition and fees from students
—who are, after all, the main ben
efactors of institutions of higher
learning—is almost universal
among U.S. colleges and univer
sities. Stanford students are well
aware that their former tuition
fee of $750 is being increased to
$1005 per year,-beginning autumn
quarter, 1958.
In spite of this increase in tui
tion, students are assured that,
even so, t+iey are paying for less
than half of what their education
at Stanford costs the University.
Upon investigating tuition fees of
other comparable colleges and
universities, both privately en
dowed, as Stanford, and state
owned, the following is found to
be true:
Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hop
kins, M.1.T., New York U., Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Princeton
and Yale have tuition fees higher
than those of Stanford, while Co
lumbia, with the same, is followed
by California Institute of Tech
nology, U. of California at Berke
ley, Northwestern, Penn State U.
and Ohio State, which list lower
tuition rates.
Comparatively Lower
Not only is Stanford's tuition
rate substantially lower than
those of comparable institutions
throughdut the country, but of
the $5.5 million received in stu
dent fees last year at Stanford,
half a million dollars' worth of
student aid was expended. Simi
larly, Harvard earmarks approxi
mately one-fifth of tuition receiv
ed for student aid, Yale one
eighth, M.I.T. one-fourth, North
western one-sixth, Princeton one
fifth and Cornell one-eighth.
In view of the facts, Stanford

students may no longer feel jus
tified in protesting the tuition in
crease. The question arises in
stead, "Where do universities get
the money necessary to their
maintenance and functioning at
present high standards?" Gifts,
grants and endowments are the
answer.
In order to facilitate such gifts
and endowments, the Council for
Financial Aid to Education was
founded in 1952 in New York by
businessmen and educators. It
provides information concerning
the financial needs of colleges and
universities, trends in business
support of higher education, and
appeals for support from institu
tions of higher education; assists
business corporations or groups
in formulating plans for financial
aid to colleges and Universities;
and assists institutions of higher
learning in developing appeals for
support from corporations.
The council does not solicit or
distribute contributions, however.
Through similar agencies may
lie the answer to the financial
dilemma facing American colleges
and universities today. Perhaps
with an awareness of the "un
favorable balance of trade"—e.g.,
too many students coming in for
facilities, too much money being
spent to replace worn-out or out
dated equipment and in salaries
for instructors, compensated or
balanced not at all by the tuitions,
fees, grants, endowments, etc.—
perhaps with an awareness of this
problem now, the impending edu
cational crisis of tomorrow may
be averted.
The financing of higher educa
tion has received much attention
during the past two decades, not
only from officers of institutions
but also from others interested in
the welfare of higher education.
Four principal sources of cur
rent incomes are endowment
earnings, philanthropic gifts, stu
dent fees and government appro
priations. The total income de
rived from these and other
sources determines the budget of
the college or university.
Endowments are held chiefly by
privately controlled institutions,
such as Stanford. The amount of
endowment in individual institu
tions ranges from only a few
thousand dollars up to the $303,-
955,186 reported by Harvard Uni
versity as of June 30, 1955.
Endowment fund principals of
Harvard ($304 million), Yale
($152 million), Columbia ($95 mil

lion), M.I.T. <$72 million), Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
($7l million), Northwestern ($63
million) and Princeton ($5B mil
lion) rank above Stanford's $54
million endowment, while Cornell
($52 million), California Institute
of Technology ($3O million), Uni
