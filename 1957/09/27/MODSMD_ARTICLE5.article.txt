# Ike Will Confer Tuesday With Southern Governors
## Faubus Will Not Attend Discussion Of School Integration Problems 
### 
NEWPORT, R.I. (/P) —President Eisenhower told a committee of
five Southern governors yesterday he would confer with them Tues
day in Washington but on a broader scale of school integration prob
lems than they intended.
The governor's had asked for the meeting solely to seek the earliest

possible withdrawal of federal
troops sent to Little Rock, Ark.,
under Eisenhower's orders to
quell integration disorders.
Eisenhower's reply made it
plain he did not intend to ( limit
discussion to that point, but to
expand it to other phases of the
problem.
The President's reply also made
clear that Gov. Orval Faubus of
Arkansas would not attend. The
President specified that his meet
ing would be with the governors'
committee —and Faubus is not a
committee member.
Committee Restricted
Gov. Leroy Collins of Florida,
committee chairman, sent a tele
gram to Eisenhower saying the
committee was restricted by a res
olution to seeking withdrawal of
the federal troops, but that the
committee members would be free
to discuss as individual governors
any phase of integration prob
lems.
Meanwhile, in Little Rock, nine
Negro students moved smoothly
through a second day of integrat
ed classes at Central High School
yesterday. They were protected
every step of the way by Army
paratroopers, but tension at the
buff brick institution seemed to
be easing.
No Skirmishes
There was no blood-letting and
no skirmishes outside the big
school, ringed yesterday as it was
Wednesday with steel - helmeted,
bayonet-ready A rm y Regulars.
Students coming out of classes
reported no disturbances inside.
Amid confusion in the Pentagon
at Washington, D.C., Secretary of
the Army Brucker last night
countermanded an order to Army
units in the South to train for riot
duty and get ready to speed to
scenes of civil disorder.
