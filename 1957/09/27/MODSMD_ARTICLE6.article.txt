rowful but surprisingly concilia
tory terms, last night urged a
prudent calmness on a state cap
ital now occupied by federal
troops.
"We are now an occupied terri
tory," Faubus said in a nation
ally televised and broadcast ad

of the supremacy of the United
States Army, when used against
a defenseless state.
"Therefore, we must continue
our peaceful pursuits of life, be
ing good citizens as the over
whelming majority of our people
have always been ... To the peo
ple of my state 1 now ask again
for calmness and a law-abiding
approach to all our problems."
Faubus pledged a relentless
continuation of "working and
fighting for the right of my peo
ple to solve their problems peace
fully."
lie concluded:
"I know that when the Ameri
can people have had time to
think and to learn more of the
facts of this situation, they—in
their good judgment—will re
buke the national administration
for the ill-advised and unwar
ranted use of federal troops.
"School attendance at bayonet
point is not compatible with the
American way of life.
"This cross we here now must
bear, but, as the poet said, 'even
this shall pass away'."
