### Jack Winkler 
Applications for the new Stan
ford branch in Beutelsbach, Ger
many, will probably be accepted
in the latter part of autumn quar
ter, with selection made during
winter quarter, Dean of Students
H. Donald YVinbigler said yester
day.
These plans are riot definite as
yet, "Winbigler stressed, but Uni
versity officials expect the selec
tion to be highly competitive, and
there will probably be a faculty
committee to make the choice.
Every one of the students in
Germany will take the same
courses—one humanities, one so
cial science and an intensive lan
guage course. There will be dif
ferent sections for advanced lan
guage students. Two Stanford
professors will go to Germany, so
the exact courses must wait upon
their selection.
Near Completion
Under the plan now nearing
final completion, Stanford will
make a contract with the owners
of the Beutelsbach site to provide
board and room and classroom
space for about 60 students. The
University will not own the prop
erty.
Winbigler, assistant business
manager Dwi g h t Adams, Dr.
Friedrich Strothmann, head of
the Germanic-Romanic Languag
es Department, and Dr. Robert
Walker, head of the General Stud
ies Committee, went to Germany
two weeks ago to inspect the fa
cility and returned with a letter
of intent from the owners stating
most of the details of the project.
Final approval of the arrange
ment awaits the drawing up of a
formal contract by the Universi
ty's attorneys and the working
out of insurance problems.
Health Service
Adams is working on the trans
ferring of Stanfoxxi's Health Serv
ice coverage to Germany, the
question of automobiles for stu
dents and insurance for them, and
legal responsibility for any dam
ages incurred to property in the
area. Winbigler expects the con
tract to be signed in three or four
weeks.
Selection of the transferees will
probably be made upon their ac
ceptability as cultural ambassa
dors, their congeniality to the Eu
ropean community and their aca
tlemi c achievement, Winbigler
said.
The site for the new branch in
cludes a large house for 30 stu
dents and two smaller houses for
an additional 30—equal to all but
the newest Stanford dormitories.

most of the details of the project.
Final approval of the arrange
ment awaits the drawing up of a
formal contract by the Universi
ty's attorneys and the working
out of insurance problems.
Health Service
Adams is working on the trans
ferring of Stanfoxxi's Health Serv
ice coverage to Germany, the
question of automobiles for stu
dents and insurance for them, and
legal responsibility for any dam
ages incurred to property in the
area. Winbigler expects the con
tract to be signed in three or four
weeks.
Selection of the transferees will
probably be made upon their ac
ceptability as cultural ambassa
dors, their congeniality to the Eu
ropean community and their aca
tlemi c achievement, Winbigler
said.
The site for the new branch in
cludes a large house for 30 stu
dents and two smaller houses for
an additional 30—equal to all but
the newest Stanford dormitories.
Applications for the new Stan
ford branch in Beutelsbach, Ger
many, will probably be accepted
in the latter part of autumn quar
ter, with selection made during
winter quarter, Dean of Students
H. Donald YVinbigler said yester
day.
These plans are riot definite as
yet, "Winbigler stressed, but Uni
versity officials expect the selec
tion to be highly competitive, and
there will probably be a faculty
committee to make the choice.
Every one of the students in
Germany will take the same
courses—one humanities, one so
cial science and an intensive lan
guage course. There will be dif
ferent sections for advanced lan
guage students. Two Stanford
professors will go to Germany, so
the exact courses must wait upon
their selection.
Near Completion
Under the plan now nearing
final completion, Stanford will
make a contract with the owners
of the Beutelsbach site to provide
board and room and classroom
space for about 60 students. The
University will not own the prop
erty.
