# HEALTH SERVICE REPORTS ON ASIAN FLU
## No Cause For Flu Panic on Farm 
### 
Asian flu is 110 different from
the so-called regular influenza
and students have no reason to
be hysterical, panicky or jittery
! over the much-publicized illness
and speculations concerning a
possible epidemic, the Stanford
Health Service reports.
Although the illness is a real
ity and is apparent in many sec
tions of the country, its serious
ness is no worse than the nor
mal flu t hat dozens of Stanford
students contract each year, Dr.
Lois P. Todd of the Health
Service explained.
"I personaly have diagnosed

about a dozen cases of flu-like
illnesses but have no way of
knowing whether or not they
were the Asian variety," Dr.
Todd said. Three other full-time
physicians and several part
time staff members are also em
ployed at the Health Service.
Only by sending a blood sam
ple to the state laboratories in
Berkeley and waiting for the re
sults of two-week tests can the
type of influenza be determined.
By then the person will have re
covered completely from the
three-day illness.
Dr. Todd reports an above-av
erage number of flu cases this

year. It does not mean an epi
demic is coming, she added,
since students, being more con
scious of influenza, would re
port to the Health Service for
illnesses which they would nor
mally regard as requiring no
medical attention.
It is also possible, the doctor
added, that students' resistance
is lower because of I ho rigorous
registration schedule and thr
fact that many students are
from different areas in the coun
try.
Should the need occur, Encina
Hall, now unused, would be fur

nished as a rest home, staffed
by nurses and adequate sup
plies.
"Merely because we have
looked ahead and have arranged
for additional hospital accom
modations does not mean we
are anticipating hit epidemic,"
Dr. Todd said. "We are simply
preparing ourselves in case
such an outbreak should occur."
Flu vaccine will probably br>
available at the Health Service
in another month. In the mean
time, students are urged to take
good care of themselves to keep
their resistance high.

illnesses which they would nor
mally regard as requiring no
medical attention.
It is also possible, the doctor
added, that students' resistance
is lower because of I ho rigorous
registration schedule and thr
fact that many students are
from different areas in the coun
try.
Should the need occur, Encina
Hall, now unused, would be fur

by nurses and adequate sup

"Merely because we have
looked ahead and have arranged
for additional hospital accom
modations does not mean we
are anticipating hit epidemic,"
Dr. Todd said. "We are simply
preparing ourselves in case
such an outbreak should occur."
Flu vaccine will probably br>
available at the Health Service
in another month. In the mean

good care of themselves to keep
their resistance high.
Asian flu is 110 different from
the so-called regular influenza
and students have no reason to
be hysterical, panicky or jittery
! over the much-publicized illness
and speculations concerning a
possible epidemic, the Stanford
Health Service reports.
Although the illness is a real
ity and is apparent in many sec
tions of the country, its serious
ness is no worse than the nor
mal flu t hat dozens of Stanford
students contract each year, Dr.
Lois P. Todd of the Health
Service explained.
"I personaly have diagnosed

about a dozen cases of flu-like
illnesses but have no way of
knowing whether or not they
were the Asian variety," Dr.
Todd said. Three other full-time
physicians and several part
time staff members are also em
ployed at the Health Service.
Only by sending a blood sam
ple to the state laboratories in
Berkeley and waiting for the re
sults of two-week tests can the
type of influenza be determined.
By then the person will have re
covered completely from the
three-day illness.
Dr. Todd reports an above-av
erage number of flu cases this

year. It does not mean an epi
demic is coming, she added,
since students, being more con
scious of influenza, would re
port to the Health Service for
illnesses which they would nor
mally regard as requiring no
medical attention.
