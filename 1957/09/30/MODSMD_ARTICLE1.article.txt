# Mangini's Barn to Be Razed Soon
## Famed Pastime Spot, Rudy's Will Make Way for Tennis Club 
### 
Friday's Olympic Day activi
ties at Mangini's Barn proved to
be the last such celebration at
(he famed pastime spot. The
place will soon be razed to make
way for the new Alpine Hills
Tennis and Swimming Club.
At the same time, Rudy's Al
pine Inn, next door to Mangini's,
will be closed to be converted into
a unit of the new family club.
The $300,000 tennis club's mem
bership will be limited to 500 fam
ilies.
Two San Mateo promoters,
Sandy MacKay of ?/Tenlo Park
and Herbert P. Clark of Daly
City, got a permit for the devel
opment without objection from j
the San Mateo County Planning J
Commission.
Bought in August
The pair bought the basic 8.75-
ane site on Alpine Road in Au
gust from Mis. Ida Mangini for
$72,500. Architect Dilliam Short
of Palo Alto, designer of the
Foothills Tennis Club on Stan
ford land, will draw up final;
plans for the new club.
Mrs. Mangini purchased the
barn in 1024. She reports it was
former ly used as a storage shed
for an old Spanish raneho. It
will probably be closed about
Dec. 1.
