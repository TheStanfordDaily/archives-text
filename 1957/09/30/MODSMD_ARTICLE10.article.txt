# THEY TOOK THE CHEAP WAY
## Three Cycle from L.A. to Stanford 
### John Lane 
Carrying only $1.0 apiece, three
freshman'men look the economi
cal way to get from Los Angeles
to Stanford-this summer-- they
bicycled,
A 1 Ahumada, Bob Gold and
Larry Tracy left Los Angeles Sep
tember 4, and 11 days later they

'arrived on campus. The three at
! tended high school together at
i University High in Los Angeles
land had taken trips together be
j fore. But not by bicycle.
Bob Gold got the idea for the
i trip from a story in Reader's Di
! gest. It told of France's Jean
! Walters, who gives each senior in
1 his school $30 and a bicycle and
I orders to travel for 30 days. The

task is to teach self-discipline and
• self-reliance.
"Bob went around school in out
senior year trying to get someone
to take a bicycle trip with him
this summer," Larry Tracy said.
"Everyone put him off with ex
cuses."
Bob finally convinced Larry
1 and A 1 Ahumada to go with him
to Stanford. Bob used an English

Hopper bicycle with four-speed
gears, while A 1 and Larry used
three-speed bicycles. They carried
sleeping bags, cooking gear and
a change of clothing, the whole
weighing about 60 pounds.
The three planned to supple
ment their original $10 for food
by working for meals. They also
caught fish from piers jutting
into the ocean on Highway 1.
"The best places we found to
work for meals," Larry said,
"were small family restaurants.
The big chains either kicked us
out or told us to go to the head
office in Chicago or something.
Shorts Eyed
A 1 interjected that in northern
California many people made
comments about the shorts the
men were wearing, although in
the South they were accepted.
In some of the restaurants the
three were given meals free, al
though they generally insisted on
doing some sort of work for the
food they received. The work ran
from peeling potatoes in San Luis
Obispo to chopping trees in Santa
Barbara and various other types
as well.
Blown orr
Al said they were at times "pan
icked" by cars passing or coming
toward them on the roads, par
ticularly on the narrow, winding
sections of Highway 1 along the
coast. He said that big transport
trucks would blow their air horns
just as they got alongside, often
causing the bicycles to blow off
the road.
Although, as Larry said, the
trip was often enough "desolate,
hot" country, the only real em
barrassment was when hoboes
waved "Hi, buddy" to t!.e trio as
they sweated, dusty and grimy,
along the roads.


BY THAIN, CLANK AND . . . —Larry Traey,
Al Ahnmada and Boh Gold stop in Oxnard on
their way by hieyele from Los Angeles to Stan
ford, where they were to enroll for their fresh
man year. They covered the 100 and some miles'

in II <l;iys, supplementing their starting capital
«»f $10 each by working for meals in the towns
which they passed. The three had done
no extensive cycling before, and took the trip
"just tor fun."
