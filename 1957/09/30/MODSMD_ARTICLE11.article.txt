# Tribe Skins 'Cats, 26-6; Team Depth Tells Story
## 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
The finest second-team strength
Chuck Taylor has seen in his
seven years at Stanford appears
ready to give the Tribe enough
depth to spring a raft of gridiron
surprises during the remainder of
the 1957 season.
That was the general consensus
following the Indians' 26-6 con
quest of Northwestern Saturday
in Stanford Stadium. After lead
ing the Wildcats 6-0 at half-time,
thanks to a long punt return and

a flock of holding penalties
against Northwestern, the Cards
came back in the final two periods
to completely wear down the
worn-out Mid westerners.
The decisive factor in the inter
sectional struggle was the Indi
ans' superior bench. Taylor was
able to put in almost his entire
second team at times and still
contain the Wildcats, while the
visitors' defense fell to pieces
when several of Ihcir first-string
ers were forced to leave the game
because of injuries.
After the game, Taylor said this
is the first time he has had a
second team as nearly equal in
ability as the first squad.
Valli Hurt
Sweet as the victory was for
Stanford, it may prove costly if
a knee injury sustained by full
back Lou Valli puts him out of
action for very long.
On the second Stanford play of
the game, Valli came up limping
after he was hit on the front of a
knee. He came back into action
later, but then reinsured the knee
in the second period. The Cards'
ace fullback was moving in to
tackle a Northwestern runner
when he stumbled forward and
fell out of bounds. He limped off
the field and saw no more action.
Word from training quarters is
that the extent of the injury,
which appears to be a ligament
rather than a cartilege, will not
be known until at least late today.
Set Up Score
Before he was hurt. Valli put
on a beautiful exhibition of side
line running to set up the first
Stanford touchdown. Northwest
ern was unable to gain the first
time they had the ball and so were
forced to punt.
Jeri McMillin took Bob McKei
ver's kick on the Indian 37 and
headed to his left. Valli came
around the other way, took a
handoff from McMillin and was
off and running.
Key blocks by John Kidd, Joel
Freis and Jackie Douglas sprung
Valli loose. He outstepped two
Wildcats and ran 48 yards to the
in v a d e r s' 15 before he was
stopped.
Cards Go to Air
Valli carried on the next two
plays and moved the ball to the 5
before he left the game. On first
and-."i Jim Byrer was thrown for
a 5-yard loss, so the Cards elected
to go to the air.
Jeri McMillin maneuvered into
an open position in the right front
corner of the Wildcat end zone
and took a perfect pass from
Douglas right on his stomach to
give Stanford its first six points.
After a Northwestern punt and
an intercepted Douglas pass, the
Wildcats made their first real
threat of the game. The intercep
tion, which bounced off McMil
lin's hands into the arms of Me-
Keiver, gave the 'Cats I he ball on
the Tribe 35. They moved to the
before being set back to the 34
by one of the eight 15-yard infrac
tions they committed during the
first half. Then the Stanford de
fenses held firm, with a four
down pass falling incomplete.
X Yards per I'lay
Several exchanges later, the
Indians began to move. Starting
at midfield, they moved 10 yards
in five plays. Reserve fullback
Chuck Shea carried on half I he
plays, picking up 15 yards. The
long-gainers of the drive were a
12-yard sweep by Douglas and a
13-yard pass to Jackie Taylor.
Another pass to Taylor brought
Stanford to the 1-yard line, with
time quickly running out. Doug
las tried to sneak over, with 3D
seconds remaining, but the tight

ly - packed Wildcat iine did not
budge. At 19 seconds, Dough
tried to pitch out to Shea. But the
play was rushed, and Shea fum
bled the pitch v.ith John Talk*;/
recovering for Northwestern a.
i the gun sounded.
No Comparison
There was little comparison be
tween the first half and the sec
ond. While the 'Cats had gained
j one more yard offensively in the
} first 30 minutes than had Stan
| ford, they could pick up just 6;-;
yards in the final half compared
to 263 gained by the Tribe.
The Indians increased their lead


SCORE NUMBER FOUR — Sid Garber (12),
third-string quarterback for Stanford, put the
iciiiK on Saturday's victory cake when lie shot
five yards to a touchdown against Northwestern.

Garber took the snap from center, went several
steps to his left and then sliced past the reach
of Andy Cvcrcko (78) and the surprised look of
Jim Andreotti (56).
