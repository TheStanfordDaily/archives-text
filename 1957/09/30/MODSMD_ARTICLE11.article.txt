# Tribe Skins 'Cats, 26-6; Team Depth Tells Story
## 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
The finest second-team strength
Chuck Taylor has seen in his
seven years at Stanford appears
ready to give the Tribe enough
depth to spring a raft of gridiron
surprises during the remainder of
the 1957 season.
That was the general consensus
following the Indians' 26-6 con
quest of Northwestern Saturday
in Stanford Stadium. After lead
ing the Wildcats 6-0 at half-time,
thanks to a long punt return and

a flock of holding penalties
against Northwestern, the Cards
came back in the final two periods
to completely wear down the
worn-out Mid westerners.
The decisive factor in the inter
sectional struggle was the Indi
ans' superior bench. Taylor was
able to put in almost his entire
second team at times and still
contain the Wildcats, while the
visitors' defense fell to pieces
when several of Ihcir first-string
ers were forced to leave the game
because of injuries.
After the game, Taylor said this
is the first time he has had a
second team as nearly equal in
ability as the first squad.
Valli Hurt
Sweet as the victory was for
Stanford, it may prove costly if
a knee injury sustained by full
back Lou Valli puts him out of
action for very long.
On the second Stanford play of
the game, Valli came up limping
after he was hit on the front of a
knee. He came back into action
later, but then reinsured the knee
in the second period. The Cards'
ace fullback was moving in to
tackle a Northwestern runner
when he stumbled forward and
fell out of bounds. He limped off
the field and saw no more action.
Word from training quarters is
that the extent of the injury,
which appears to be a ligament
rather than a cartilege, will not
be known until at least late today.
Set Up Score
Before he was hurt. Valli put
on a beautiful exhibition of side
line running to set up the first
Stanford touchdown. Northwest
ern was unable to gain the first
time they had the ball and so were
forced to punt.
Jeri McMillin took Bob McKei
ver's kick on the Indian 37 and
headed to his left. Valli came
around the other way, took a
handoff from McMillin and was
off and running.
Key blocks by John Kidd, Joel
Freis and Jackie Douglas sprung
Valli loose. He outstepped two
Wildcats and ran 48 yards to the
in v a d e r s' 15 before he was
stopped.
Cards Go to Air
Valli carried on the next two
plays and moved the ball to the 5
before he left the game. On first
and-."i Jim Byrer was thrown for
a 5-yard loss, so the Cards elected
to go to the air.
Jeri McMillin maneuvered into
an open position in the right front
corner of the Wildcat end zone
and took a perfect pass from
Douglas right on his stomach to
give Stanford its first six points.
After a Northwestern punt and
an intercepted Douglas pass, the
Wildcats made their first real
threat of the game. The intercep
tion, which bounced off McMil
lin's hands into the arms of Me-
Keiver, gave the 'Cats I he ball on
the Tribe 35. They moved to the
before being set back to the 34
by one of the eight 15-yard infrac
tions they committed during the
first half. Then the Stanford de
fenses held firm, with a four
down pass falling incomplete.
X Yards per I'lay
Several exchanges later, the
Indians began to move. Starting
at midfield, they moved 10 yards
in five plays. Reserve fullback
Chuck Shea carried on half I he
plays, picking up 15 yards. The
long-gainers of the drive were a
12-yard sweep by Douglas and a
13-yard pass to Jackie Taylor.
Another pass to Taylor brought
Stanford to the 1-yard line, with
time quickly running out. Doug
las tried to sneak over, with 3D
seconds remaining, but the tight

ly - packed Wildcat iine did not
budge. At 19 seconds, Dough
tried to pitch out to Shea. But the
play was rushed, and Shea fum
bled the pitch v.ith John Talk*;/
recovering for Northwestern a.
i the gun sounded.
No Comparison
There was little comparison be
tween the first half and the sec
ond. While the 'Cats had gained
j one more yard offensively in the
} first 30 minutes than had Stan
| ford, they could pick up just 6;-;
yards in the final half compared
to 263 gained by the Tribe.
The Indians increased their lead


SCORE NUMBER FOUR — Sid Garber (12),
third-string quarterback for Stanford, put the
iciiiK on Saturday's victory cake when lie shot
five yards to a touchdown against Northwestern.

Garber took the snap from center, went several
steps to his left and then sliced past the reach
of Andy Cvcrcko (78) and the surprised look of
Jim Andreotti (56).

1o 13-0 with 3:31 left in the third
stanza. Early in the quarter they
drove 52 yards to the 7, only to
see three pusses fall incomplete.
The successful drive began on
the 'Cats' 41. Two plays kept it
alive t ho first a 16-yard pass
from Douglas lo Taylor on a
thirdand-8 situation, Hie second a
1-yard buck by Shea on fourth
down with a foot to go.
Shea, who gained 98 yards in
20 carries for the day, scored the
touchdown with a plunge over left
tackle. It took the Cards 10 plays
to go the 11 yards. Eric Protiva's
conversion was good after Har
rington's PAT attempt in the first
quarter had been wide.
Wildcats Capitalize
Northwestern capitalized on a
fumble by Douglas to pick up
their six points. Taking the ball
at midfield, they quickly moved
to the Indian 36.
On second-and-8, I-lolcomb pass
ed to Fred Williamson on the 27.
As he was hit by Gary Van Galder
he lateraled to the onrushing Will
mer Fowler, who streaked to the
end zone with no one close to him.
Stanford quickly went after in
surance points and staged a drive
which lasted more than six min
utes.
Fourth and 2
At the Northwestern 42 the
drive ran into trouble as fourth
down came up with still 2 yards
to go. With the Cards ahead at
this point in the game, all the
"quarterbacks" in the stands ex
pected Stanford to kick, attempt
ing to put the 'Cats in a hole.
But Douglas took a big gamble.
He faked a handoff to Shea, then
moved to his right and flipped a
short pass to Ben Robinson for 8
yards and the first down.
Kick to Jeri
On the 30, Douglas called for a
new play in the Cards' bag of
tricks—a McMillen to McMillin re
verse. Sophomore Rick McMillen
took a pitch-out and started to his
right, then handed off to Jeri Mc-
Millin, running left. Jeri weaved
his way 20 yards before being
stopped.
Rick took another pitch-out on
the r next play, kept the ball this
time and lipped off a quick 10
yards for the first touchdown of
nis varsity career.
The final Indian points came
easily as Norlhwestern's forces
were by this time thoroughly bat
tered. Bob Nieolet, in the game
at quarterback after Douglas had
played the first 56-plus minutes,
picked off a pass on the Wild
cat 36.
Garber Scores
Four plays later third-string
quarterback Sid Garber sliced
into the end zone from 5 yards
out on a keeper play. Armand
DeWcese's kick with 31 seconds
to play gave Stanford its 26th
point.
In all, the Indians gained a
healthy 409 yards 251 on the
ground and 158 in the air. Doug
la;', and Nieolet combined to com
plete 13 of 27 passes and would
have had a belter average had not
three passes been dropped when
they were right in receivers'
hands.
Shea, with a 4.9 average, and
Harrington, with 59 yards gained
in nine carries, led the rushers.

Rick McMillen, in his three car
ries, picked up 22 yards.
In the first-down department
the Cards were far superior, gain
ing 23 to just seven for North
western.
The victory, of course, made
Stanford 2-0 this season and gave
them a scoring average of 36
points per game. The win also

preserved the Indians' TV win
ning streak, as they have now
won all four games against Big
Ten teams which have been seen
on nation-wide television.
Saturday it's ihe Rice Owls in
Houston, Tex., as the Cards hope
to continue their campaign to
prove that the pre-season experts
are wrong.


WHAT, A TAC KMC KCORK?—That was die in
tention in the third period of Saturday's Stan
ford Northwestern game when Jackie Douglas
tried to iiit John Ividd on the tackle-eligible. Kid
the pass ran into trouble en route and wound up

bouncing around among a pile of Wildcats. Hob
Vll'Kciver (16) won the race to the already-dead
ball. Douglas also threw incomplete on the next
two downs as the drive died.

NOT THIS TIMK —Stanford's Dick Stein (82) put up a good fight
for this 1 pass from Jackie Douglas, but the Northwestern defender
managed to stick his baud up and bat it away. Stanford was near
mid-field at the time, but this particular drive didn't materialize
in a touchdown.
