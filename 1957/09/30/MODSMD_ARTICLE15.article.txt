# THIS WEEK ON QUAD-By Hubert Q. Fang
## Textbooks and Lengthy Assignments 
### 
The registralion mania is all over, and Stan
ford i I es are back in the old groove of textbooks
and lengthy assignments. The gridiron scene
has been rosy so far with two opponents down
and eight (nine?) to go. But looking at the ac
tivity calendar this week, one feels like Old
Mother Hubbard the cupboard looks pretty
bare, all righty.
Today's l'our-slar thriller takes place in Room
320 al 4 p.m. when the good old School of Min
eral Sciences Journal Club roars into its autumn
quarter schedule with Adolph Knopf's discussion
on "Recent Advances in Measuring Geologic
Time." Coffee at 3:45 for all you caffeine fiends.
#
The old Tuesday standby, the Tuesday Evening
Series, is back with us again. This week it's R.
Buckminster Fuller, who will lecture on "Com
prehensive Art and Science of Design." Zoom
over to Mem Auci early to get a seat for this
biggie—starting time is 7:30.
The Seminar in Chemical Engineering and
Applied Chemistry is back, with a big, big, big,
really BIG show this week, folks. Charles R.

Wilke of Cal will electrify Ihe expected over
flow crowd with "Mass Transfer in Compressed
Gases." Sounds like a gasser, man. The doors
of friendly old c2O will creak open at 4:15 p.m.
Wednesday.

Nothing happening Thursday or Friday, so
this would be a good time to amble over to the
Museum and absorb some culture. Currently
dazzling visitors is . . . is . . . well, nothing in
particular. Lots of old broken factory rejects
from ancient times, and a nice scholarly atmos
phere, though.
#
Saturday is the really big day of ihe week
when the Daily grid machine is slated to squish
the poor boys from ihe Chappie. Meanwhile, the
varsity will be tangling with Rice at Houston.
