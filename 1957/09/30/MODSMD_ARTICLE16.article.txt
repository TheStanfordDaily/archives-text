Inane Ruilling
Editor, The Daily: >â€¢
The inane rattling coming from Ihe Cellar
loudspeaker at noon and in early afternoon is
pet haps a useful contrast to the sanctuary of
ino Cubberley library. But now that we've seen
the contrast, 1ho loudspeakers should be cut to
half volume so we can have our sanctuary back.
Permanently cut- not just until the next rabble
rousing.

Perennial Bookstore Problem
Editor, The Daily:
I read with great interest in The Daily this
past week that things were running more
smoothly than ever at ihe Bookstore this quar
ter. As many us 30 (count 'cm, 30) clerks to
handle the reg rush, the article gloated, and the
lines, although as long as usual, were moving
t:i lei ! In short, this was the best of all possible
boo! stores under the present inadequate roof;
but just wait until the new Bookstore building
is built!
After today's experience, I'll be more than
glad to wail, and even then will probably buy my
books elsewhere.
1 spent over an hour today waiting in line (15
minutes of which was outside in the rain) only
to lind when I reached one of the three (I
counted em, ihree) clerks Ihot the book I wanted
was out of stock. When I asked the harried clerk
why such information was not posted on the
blackboard, eliminating needless waits such as
mine, she replied that the clerks didn't have
time, and were too busy. Certainly, but why
weren't Ihere more clerks, 1 queried? "It we

could get more clerks, we would have them," she
replied snippily.
My questions, then, are these:
1. Did the Daily reporter actually do any in
vestigating on his own to see what the current
situation at the Bookstore really was? Or did
he merely "rehash" the glowing information the
Bookstore manager frothed up for him? One
gains a different perspective from the inside
looking out.
2. Does the 20 per cent annual rebate really
"make up" for the inconvenience the student"has
in buying his books three times a year? I per
sonally would settle for less rebates and more
efficiency. And above all, more politeness on
the part of some of the employees.
8. Why are so many books out of stock at the
beginning of each quarter? I can't afford, study
wise, to "wait until next Friday and try again."
By Ihen I will be eight days behind in my reading
for one of my five-day courses.
I agree that the Bookstore needs a new build
ing the present one is outmoded and cramped.
But I also submit that it will take lots more than
a new building and a new checkout system 1o
make the Bookstore a pleasant and efficient
place to do business.

Kditor's note: We can only answer your first
question, unfortunately. The tacts presented
in the story were correct, as reported by one
of our best reporters. The time you visited the
Hooks tore was obviously a time when the lull
complement ol personnel were not oil hand.
We would like to point out that no satisfactory
answer lias yet been given either to The Oaily
or to the student government lor your re
maining questions. We would suggest that the
Bookstore Board of Directors attempt to air
svver them.
