## 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (/P) â€”Gov-
ernor Orval Faubus was reported
ready yesterday to call a historic
.special session of the Arkansas
Legislature. Its purpose would be
to rid Central High School of
troop-enforced classroom integra
tion.
The Arkansas Democrat, a
Little Rock newspaper, said in a
copyrighted story that the call is
expected "in a matter of hours."
Mechanics of the situation prob
ably would delay actual conven
ing of a session until mid-week.
The governor said Saturday he
was considering asking the Leg
islature to close the high school
where nine Negro students last
week became the first integrated
students in Little Rock history
amid rioting and a national civil
rights debate.
