# Parseghian—'We Were Run Out of Park'; Taylor Praises 'New Look' in Attitude
## 
### Roy Lawson 
In the beginning it was "Sep
tember in the Rain," but in t he j
end it was huge penalty assess-1
ments and a crushing Stanford j
running attack and defense that j
caused Northwestern coach Aral
Parseghian to say, "We were run ;
right out of the park.
"We were forced to play a game !
that we don't like to play," Par
seghian said in the aftermath fol-|
lowing the Indians' 26-6 football
victory over the Evanston, 111.,
troops.
"When you're faced with a sec-1
ond-and-25 situation constantly,!
you have to go for the long gain-j
er, and with sophomore quarter
backs [Chip Holcomb and John j
Talley] playing in their first var-!
sity game that's a pretty tough j
way to go."
The Wildcats picked up nine
penalties for 125 yards of retard-1
ed development in the first half
and 140 yards for the game, but
Parseghian said: "I'm not blam-1
itig the officials —at least, not!
until 1 see the game movies. Most
of the penalties were technical
ones, called for hands beir.g away ■
from the body in the blocking."
No Depth Problem
On the west side of Encina gym- j
nasium, the jubilant Indians
showered and dressed with the re
assuring feeling that the depth
problem was showing signs of be
ing minimized. The reserves had i
filled the bill when called upon, ;
and Stanford coach Chuck Taylor
was saying, "After today, we have
two strong units that we can put
in."

Taylor praised the team effort
and attitude and felt the key fac
tor came in the second half when
"we discovered a big weakness up
ihe middle. It hurt them quite a
bit when they lost [guard] A 1
Viola and Jcenter] Fred Bennett
in the second half."
Russ Steele, Stanford center,
felt that another cause of the
Wildc a t s' Open Door Policy
through the middle came because

of "a roaming defense. They tried
to stop our wide stuff and pass
ing, leaving the middle open," he
said. _
Easy Passing
Quarterback Jackie Douglas,
who completed 12 of 23 attempts
for 1 12 yards and one touchdown,
felt it was as easy to pass against
the Wildcats as it had been the
week before against San Jose
State.
Douglas' shots in the flat to
halfback Jeri McMillin were par
ticularly effective. "We hadn't ex
pected Stanford to throw so much

in the flat," Parseghian said, "hut.
their defense was about as we had
anticipated."
Freis Ejected
The Indians lost end Joel Freis
early in the second quarter when
he was ejected from the game fol
lowing a brief encounter with
Wildcat fullback Ed Quinn near
the Northwestern bench.
Freis was puzzled over the ejec
tion, however. "I caught a pass
near the sidelines," he related,
"and was tackled low, but then
Quinn jumped onto my chest. I
didn't mind that too much, but
when I tried to get up lie jumped
on me again, so I tried to brush
him off with my arm. The next
thing I knew the ref had kicked
me out."
The line battle between Stan
ford guard Don Manoukian and
Northwestern guard A 1 Viola ap
peared to have been won by the
former. "Viola was good," said
Manoukian, "but he was slowed
by neck and groin injuries."
Viola Impressed
Viola thought that Stanford's
defense was "every bit as good as
the ones we faced in the Big Ten
last year"- and that included such
notables as Michigan, Minnesota,
Illinois and Ohio State.
It was gray and raining stead
ily by the time the opening kick
off came, and, though tlie sun re
turned for Stanford, it didn't for
the hapless Wildcats. Once again
the Indians had proven their in
vincibility before the most criti
cal of all audiences—the national
television hook-up. Next stop:

Douglas' shots in the flat to

ticularly effective. "We hadn't ex

Freis Ejected
The Indians lost end Joel Freis
early in the second quarter when
he was ejected from the game fol
lowing a brief encounter with
Wildcat fullback Ed Quinn near
the Northwestern bench.
Freis was puzzled over the ejec
tion, however. "I caught a pass
near the sidelines," he related,
"and was tackled low, but then
Quinn jumped onto my chest. I
didn't mind that too much, but
when I tried to get up lie jumped
on me again, so I tried to brush
him off with my arm. The next
thing I knew the ref had kicked
me out."
The line battle between Stan
ford guard Don Manoukian and
Northwestern guard A 1 Viola ap
peared to have been won by the
former. "Viola was good," said
Manoukian, "but he was slowed
by neck and groin injuries."
Viola Impressed
Viola thought that Stanford's
defense was "every bit as good as
the ones we faced in the Big Ten
last year"- and that included such
notables as Michigan, Minnesota,
Illinois and Ohio State.
It was gray and raining stead
ily by the time the opening kick
off came, and, though tlie sun re
turned for Stanford, it didn't for
the hapless Wildcats. Once again
the Indians had proven their in
vincibility before the most criti
cal of all audiences—the national
television hook-up. Next stop:

Parseghian
In the beginning it was "Sep
tember in the Rain," but in t he j
end it was huge penalty assess-1
ments and a crushing Stanford j
running attack and defense that j
caused Northwestern coach Aral
Parseghian to say, "We were run ;
right out of the park.
"We were forced to play a game !
that we don't like to play," Par
seghian said in the aftermath fol-|
lowing the Indians' 26-6 football
victory over the Evanston, 111.,
troops.
"When you're faced with a sec-1
ond-and-25 situation constantly,!
you have to go for the long gain-j
er, and with sophomore quarter
backs [Chip Holcomb and John j

sity game that's a pretty tough j
way to go."
The Wildcats picked up nine
penalties for 125 yards of retard-1

and 140 yards for the game, but
Parseghian said: "I'm not blam-1

from the body in the blocking."
No Depth Problem
On the west side of Encina gym- j

assuring feeling that the depth
problem was showing signs of be

two strong units that we can put

"we discovered a big weakness up
ihe middle. It hurt them quite a
bit when they lost [guard] A 1
Viola and Jcenter] Fred Bennett
in the second half."
Russ Steele, Stanford center,

"When you're faced with a sec-1
ond-and-25 situation constantly,!
you have to go for the long gain-j
er, and with sophomore quarter
backs [Chip Holcomb and John j
Talley] playing in their first var-!
sity game that's a pretty tough j
way to go."
The Wildcats picked up nine
penalties for 125 yards of retard-1
ed development in the first half
and 140 yards for the game, but
Parseghian said: "I'm not blam-1
itig the officials —at least, not!
until 1 see the game movies. Most
of the penalties were technical
ones, called for hands beir.g away ■
from the body in the blocking."
No Depth Problem
On the west side of Encina gym- j
nasium, the jubilant Indians
showered and dressed with the re
assuring feeling that the depth
problem was showing signs of be
ing minimized. The reserves had i
filled the bill when called upon, ;
and Stanford coach Chuck Taylor
was saying, "After today, we have
two strong units that we can put
in."

Taylor praised the team effort
and attitude and felt the key fac
tor came in the second half when
"we discovered a big weakness up
ihe middle. It hurt them quite a
bit when they lost [guard] A 1
Viola and Jcenter] Fred Bennett
in the second half."
Russ Steele, Stanford center,
felt that another cause of the
Wildc a t s' Open Door Policy
through the middle came because

of "a roaming defense. They tried
to stop our wide stuff and pass
ing, leaving the middle open," he
said. _
Easy Passing
Quarterback Jackie Douglas,
who completed 12 of 23 attempts
for 1 12 yards and one touchdown,
felt it was as easy to pass against
the Wildcats as it had been the
week before against San Jose
State.
Douglas' shots in the flat to
halfback Jeri McMillin were par
ticularly effective. "We hadn't ex
pected Stanford to throw so much

in the flat," Parseghian said, "hut.
their defense was about as we had
anticipated."
Freis Ejected
The Indians lost end Joel Freis
early in the second quarter when
he was ejected from the game fol
lowing a brief encounter with
Wildcat fullback Ed Quinn near
the Northwestern bench.
Freis was puzzled over the ejec
tion, however. "I caught a pass
near the sidelines," he related,
"and was tackled low, but then
Quinn jumped onto my chest. I
didn't mind that too much, but
when I tried to get up lie jumped
on me again, so I tried to brush
him off with my arm. The next
thing I knew the ref had kicked
me out."
The line battle between Stan
ford guard Don Manoukian and
Northwestern guard A 1 Viola ap
peared to have been won by the
former. "Viola was good," said
Manoukian, "but he was slowed
by neck and groin injuries."
Viola Impressed
Viola thought that Stanford's
defense was "every bit as good as
the ones we faced in the Big Ten
last year"- and that included such
notables as Michigan, Minnesota,
Illinois and Ohio State.
It was gray and raining stead
ily by the time the opening kick
off came, and, though tlie sun re
turned for Stanford, it didn't for
the hapless Wildcats. Once again
the Indians had proven their in
vincibility before the most criti
cal of all audiences—the national
television hook-up. Next stop:
Rice Institute.
