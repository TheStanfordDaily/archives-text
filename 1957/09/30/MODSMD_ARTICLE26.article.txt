# SU Placement Service Finds Part-Time, Permanent Jobs
## 
### Stove Deck 
Whether he is looking for a part-time job to supplement a meager
allowance during school or for a more permanent position after
graduation, the student may find employment counseling and inter
view opportunities at the Stanford Placement Service and Student
Employment Service in Building 1 of Inner Quad.

The Placement Service serves
two main functions in students'
lives: to act as liaison between
students and companies, and to
provide individual counseling
and advice. Under Director Eu
gene William Dils, R. C. Bever
stoek and Mrs, Mary Bcckius, in
terviews will be arranged
throughout this year.
Experience Helpful
Part-time and temporary jobs
may be arranged through Mrs.
Barbara Cochran in the Student
Employment Service. This serv
ice is important to the student to
gain experience at working and
in finding what types of jobs in
terest him.
The Placement Service began
some 30 years ago with the activ
ities of one woman, who found
jobs for graduating seniors, in
the basement of the old Adminis
tration Building, the present Law
School.
Established in 1915
During President Donald B.
Tresidder's administration in
1945 the Placement Service was
formally organized in Inner
Quad. The service investigates
jol) possibilities in all University
departments except law, medi
cine and nursing.
The names of students regis
tered with the Placement Service
are kept on active file for a year,
and then placed on inactive file
until the death of the registrant.
Ideally, students should register
within two quarters of gradua
tion, but they may register at;
any previous time during their
scholastic career.
Counseling Stressed
During registration the student
will have a preliminary interview
with an appropriate counselor,
depending on his major. In this
way, emphasis is placed on indi
vidual counseling and advice.
Interviews with company rep
resentatives are then arrangedâ€”
the student signs interview
schedules at the Placement Serv
ice. Interviews will begin early
this year, and lists of interviews
are available now.
The largest number of jobs of
fered appears to be in technical
fields because of the present me
chanical civilization and the em
phasis on defense in the United
States. However, non - technical
majors will find opportunities in
business and industry for both
men and women.
