# Ginzton to Receive High IRE Honor
## 
### 
Edward L. Ginzton, professor
of applied physics and electrical
engineering, will receive one of
the highest honors in electronics,
the Morris Leibmann Memorial
Prize, from the Institute of Radio
Engineers at the IRE national
convention in New York city next
March.
Professor Ginzton, who joined
the Stanford faculty in 1946, is
director of the microwave labora
tory at Stanford and is currently
doing research work in Geneva,
Switzerland. He will receive the
award "for his creative contribu
tion to the generation and useful
application of high energy at mi
crowave frequencies."
In the 38-year history of the
prize, six American winners have
been chosen, with three of them
Stanford scientists. Last year's
winner was professor O. G. Vil
lard Jr., senior member of Stan
ford's radio propagation labora
tory, and in 1944 the prize went
to William Webster Hansen, late
Stanford physicist.
