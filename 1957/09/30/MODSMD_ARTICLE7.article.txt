Members of ti'.-: Alcoholic
Beverages Commission take
note and get in step with the
latest theory. A professor from
Yale says that alcoholism will
he averted if good drinking
habits are established early,
say in adolescence. A toast to
the Ivy League, if you please.
Said Dr. Seldon D. Bacon of
Yale University's Center of Al
cohol Studies, "Social devia
tions (such as alcoholism) will
not be extreme ... if a drinking
custom is simple and uniform,
smoothly integrated with fam
ily religion and government...
if parents and religious author
ities are the usual teachers and
if learning occurs during the
usual period of social learning,
infancy, childhood and early
adolescence."
Members of the ABC, we
should be learning the ABC's of
drinking along with our ABC's.
Now you are driving us to fur
tive, secret drinking, frustra
tions, complexes, neurosis, for
gery and ALCOHOLISM. Can't
you see the error in your ways?
