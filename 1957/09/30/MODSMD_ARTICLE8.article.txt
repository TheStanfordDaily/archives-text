# Rain Dampens Field, But Not Indian Spirit
## SU Band, Card Stunts Featured in TV Game Of Week's Half-time 
### Frank Huntress 
Throw away the first half with
its rain, penalties, mental errors,
and the nationally televised game
of the week between Stanford
and Northwestern was a treat
for some 20,000 fans at the game
and millions at home.
Talk in the rooting section
over the Indians' 2G-6 thrashing
of the Wildcats boiled down to
two topics—penalties against the
visitors and Stanford's "New
Look" defense.
After each touchdown the stu
dents waited for the 1957 Big Red
Machine to show that it had
cured the disease which kept it
from the Rose Bowl last year—
BAT jitters. The Indians arc still
ailing.
But on the brighter side was
discussion of the Card defense.
For the second straight week the
fast-charging, big line completely
manhandled their opponents.
And while BOTH of the Card
lines were containing the Cats'
fleet backs pretty well, the ref
erees were marking off one 15-
yard penalty after another, most
ly for offense holding.
At half-time the 110-piece Stan
ford marching band performed
for the fans on TV and for those
who were brave enough to sit
through thr first-half showers.
The band dedicated its half
timn ceremonies to graduates
throughout the nation by playing
i m?iny Stanford songs.
The card stunts this year were
| not up to par. Only the expand
ing block "S" was done perfectly.
Just before the last card stunt,
j some rooter in the lower part of
the section set off a smoke bomb
which sent beautiful orange
smoke floating over the card sec
j tion.
All during the second half root
| ers amused themselves by blow
[ ing up balloons and letting them
; empty above the stands.
The skies cleared for the sec
! ond half and it wa<; near-perfect
football weather fo: the remain
-1 der of the game.
