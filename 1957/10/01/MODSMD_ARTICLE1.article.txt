# Little Rock Integration Continues
## Southern Governors' Committee to Confer With the President 
### Associated Press 
Integration in Little Rock, Ark., I
proceeded without the use of fixed .
bayonets yesterday, and President 1
Eisenhower returned to Washing-1
lon to meel with a committee of
Southern governors today on the
school integration problem.
In Little Rock, barricades came j
down, bayonets were sheathed j
and a bristling cordon of troops
was drastically cut yesterday as
the second week of integrated
classes got under way at Central
Iligh School.
Nine Negro students strolled
out into bright autumn sunshine
at the end of their class day, un- i
escorted for the first time since
they were besieged in the samel
school by rioting whites just a !
week ago.
Talking, Laughing
They talked and laughed to
gether as they marie their way to j
an Army vehicle that took them !
home.
Arm e d, hclmeted paratroop
guards were recalled from posts
at each of the big school's en- â– 
trances. Detachments inside and
outside the school were sharply j
cut. The nearly solid line of sol- j
fliers that ringed the school at one !
time was replaced with widely-j
spaced two-man foot patrols.
During the day Governor Qrval i
Faubus continued to withhold a j
decision on whether to summon I
a special session of the Arkansas j
Legislature. He said such a ses-1
sion was very likely. But he was
known to be running up against
opposition from lawmakers.
Special Session?
A special session might try to
legislate its way around the troop
enforced integration at Central
High, first school in the city to
mingle white and Negro students. J
President Eisenhower ended his
27-day New England vacation yes
terday and returned to Washing
ton to cope further with school
integration questions.
His first major item was a con-1
ferenee on the problem at the I
White House today with a com
mittee of five Southern governors.
Gov. Marvin Griffin of Georgia,
who is opposed to integration of
white and Negro pupils, said at
Atlanta yesterday he would not i
attend the conference because Eis- i
enhower agreed to talk only about !
integration, rather than the ques- j
lion of pulling troops out of Ar-;
kansas.
