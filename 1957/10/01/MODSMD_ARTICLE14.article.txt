# Warren Studies Teamster Plea To Stop Election
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AV Chief Jus
tice Warren agreed yesterday to
consider a plea for a Supreme
: Court order preventing the Team
sters union from electing national |
| officers this week.
The llth-hour appeal was made
by 13 rank-and-file members of
the union fighting what they call j
a "dictatorship" in their organi-1
zation.
There is a possibility that the;
chief justice will rule in the case
: today.
The 13 asked for reinstatement
of a temporary injunction issued 1
here Saturday by U.S. District
Judge F. Dickinson Letts.
Judge's Order
Judge Letts' order would have 1
barred the IV* â€¢ million - member |
union from picking a new slate of
officers at its Miami Beach. Fla.,
convention on the ground, among
others, that the election was rig
ged in favor of James 11. Hoffa,
who aspires to be president.
The ink on the order was hardly
dry. however, before the U.S. Cir-;
cuit Court of Appeals overruled
Judge Letts and issued a stay of
! the injunction.
Chairman John McClellan (D-
Ark.) announced that the Senate
rackets committee has evidence
| that 50 per cent or more of the
convention delegates were illegal-
Ily selected. Retiring Teamsters
president Dave Beck countered I
that McClellan has supplied no J
facts to back up his contention,
and told reporters "in my opinion
the senator is in error."
Tactics Complaint
Meanwhile, in Miami Beach, j
Hoffa's political foes complained i
of pressure tactics last night at
the Teamsters convention and lost I
an attempt to get AFL-CIO presi- |
rlenl George Meany to address the i
delegates.
These developments came as (58-
year-old John F. English. Team
ster secretary-treasurer and care
taker of the money, blasted Beck
and other fellow Teamster chiefs
in a convention speech.
Hoffa. Detroit union vice presi- ,
I dent and leading contender for
Beck's job although enmeshed in
the union's scandals, appeared j
j well in command of convention j
machinery. ' |
