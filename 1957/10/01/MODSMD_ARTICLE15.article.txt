### Sallyanne Durr 
Injections of the Asian flu vac
cine will begin to be administered
to Stanford students from 7 In I)
tomorrow evening at the Health
Service, free of charge.
Dr. George Houck, director of
the Health Service, has specified
that he has only enough vaccine
for approximately 700 students.
Priority will go first to student
firemen and policemen, followed
by sponsors, student administra
tive assistants, resident assistants
and hashers, decided the Student
Health Committee yesterday.
Because of the susceptibility of
younger people, freshmen will be
next in line. Freshmen whose last
names begin with A through C
will receive shots tomorrow night.
The remainder of the freshman
class will be inoculated Friday
evening.
Additional Shots
More vaccine is expected to ar
rive within the next month. Thi
will be given to the remainder of
the students. The Health Service
requests students to come only
when eligible. Times and dates of
the series of shots will be posted.
Dr. Houck stressed that the in
oculations given in the immediate
future are not guaranteed to give
protection against the current
wave of influenza, but should be
sufficient to provide immunity
against the second wave, forecast
for either December or January.
Two Injections
The University is supplying the
vaccine at no cost to the students.
Each person will be administered
two shots; the second will be
available when supplies ol vaccine
are more plentiful.
As of 5 p.m. yesterday Dr.
Houck stated that he doubted if
more than 60 students are ill with
influenza. He said influenza as
such is hard to diagnose because
samples of the ill person's blood
must be taken during the illness
and compared to blood taken after
recovery.
Each year the beginning of au
tumn quarter is plagued by nu
merous cases of respiratory ill
nesses reported to the Health
Service, according to Dr. Houck.
This year's number is about twice
that of past years.
