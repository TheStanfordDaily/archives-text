# It's Your Tuesday Series
## 
### 
Do YOU WANT lo learn something without
having to he responsible for it in an examina
tion? Your chance lupins tonight as the Uni
versity launches another season of the Tuesday
Kvening Series.
Tuesday Evening Series programs, held in
Memorial Auditorium, are free of charge to
students and members of the community alike.
Perhaps one of the most appealing features of
the Series is its rigid adherence to a time sched
ule — programs begin at 7:30 and are out
promptly at 8:30, allowing the student ample
time lo complete class assignments.
Campus clothing is traditionally worn to the
Tuesday Series, also conserving time of the
busy student.
From the time a group of students gathered
in the old Chapel (now the Dean's Office) on
the evening of Dec. 8, 1891, to hear one of Stan
lord's own faculty members, the Tuesday Eve
ning Series has built up a tradition of providing
the best in variety —from famed political per
sonalties to musical programs.
Many a Stanford student has had the experi
ence of deciding to try a Series program once

and finding himself a steady attemler. Don't
let subject titles scare you olf. Tonight's pro
gram, for instance, is called "Comprehensive
Art and Science of Design," a title which could
scare away someone who didn't know what was
really scheduled.
Actually, what is scheduled tonight will be
a talk by a designer, H. Buckminster Fuller,
who believes that most buildings—from huge
public edifices to the types of houses we live in
-—should be built as domes.
Sound more appealing? \\ lien you contem
plate living under a glass or concrete bubble,
you immediately become curious as to why you
should or should not live in this type of house.
ou don't have to agree with the speaker, but
at least you can find out why he feels a cer
tain way.
The Tuesday Series, just like many other
great Farm traditions, is definitely one of those
"things to do." So, to the freshmen, upperclass
men and graduates—in fact, everyone—we rec
ommend that you take a one-hour rest from
your formal studies tonight and learn some
thing in the meantime.
