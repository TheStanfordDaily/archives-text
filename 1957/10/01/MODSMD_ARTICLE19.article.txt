# MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
## Left Much to Be Desired 
### Barbara Bachman 
Stanford's rather unexpected victory over the
Northwestern Wildcats Saturday certainly more
than fulfilled the hope of Stanford's alumni, stu
dents and a few of the sports experts, but by the
same token it left much to be desired in the same
(if not worse) cheering section under the direc
tion (to use the word uselessly, or is it loosely)
ol head cheerleader (by default) Ed Borden
kircher.
But aside from a few rather off-color and de
cidedly unwitty jokes, some dangerous card
throwing, a few drops of precipitation, with in
termittent downpours, and some balloons sput
tering and dying overhead, the segregated cheer
ing .section was just the same as it has been for
years and years and years.
Sitting there, watching the snappy band and
Coach Chuck's "Little Red Riding Hood" men
suited up in red capes on the bench, we wondered
why we didn't have a new yell or two, a chance
for the women to try the card stunts and just
plain more organization and pre-planning on the
part of the rah-rah, com-eom, Rally Com.
Observers from the other side as well as those
who meandered down on the field during half
limp, had few good words to say concerning the
card stunts. And this is too bad. Many hours of
hard work go into their planning, and when a
hunch of roughs with the all-important machin
ery in their hands start flashing the wrong cards
at the wrong times, the whole business is thrown
out and the gigantic Cal card section begins to
be recognized as the best in the north half of the
PCC.

A traditional courtesy gesture, an exchange
with the other team's pompon girls—in this case
10 strong from El Cerrito High was just and
only that — a courtesy gesture. Bordenkircher
and company had a few smart comments, but
invited no real support for the green-clad gals,
and not even a round of applause for their ap
pearance in front of the Stanford stands.
The final feature of the Saturday contest
seemed to have lost its appeal, too, when a good
portion of white-shirted Indians made an early
exit, not even waiting to see the game's final
touchdown. One reason may have been that the
people at the helm of the whole day didn't invite
their participation.
And then at the game's end, the battle-worn
footballers still had to fight Iheir way to the
dressing rooms, as Stanfordites pummeled and
pushed them of I the narrow roadway out of the
Stadium.
To boot, scores of little urchins delighted in
nabbing pompons and pulling feathers out of the
women's hair scalp and all.
But even with all this, a game is a game, it is
wonderful and we're proud of our Big Red Ma
chine. Improvements are needed, but a little
imagination could cure this in one afternoon.
Chief Lightfoot, the Stanford Band and the
team, the three contributors of dignity to the
Farm's Saturday contest, should definitely be
supported and make the Stanford students,
alumni and friends proud that the team is really
in there pitching.

PCC.

A traditional courtesy gesture, an exchange
with the other team's pompon girls—in this case
10 strong from El Cerrito High was just and
only that — a courtesy gesture. Bordenkircher
and company had a few smart comments, but
invited no real support for the green-clad gals,
and not even a round of applause for their ap
pearance in front of the Stanford stands.
The final feature of the Saturday contest
seemed to have lost its appeal, too, when a good
portion of white-shirted Indians made an early
exit, not even waiting to see the game's final
touchdown. One reason may have been that the
people at the helm of the whole day didn't invite
their participation.
And then at the game's end, the battle-worn
footballers still had to fight Iheir way to the
dressing rooms, as Stanfordites pummeled and
pushed them of I the narrow roadway out of the
Stadium.
To boot, scores of little urchins delighted in
nabbing pompons and pulling feathers out of the
women's hair scalp and all.
But even with all this, a game is a game, it is
wonderful and we're proud of our Big Red Ma
chine. Improvements are needed, but a little
imagination could cure this in one afternoon.
Chief Lightfoot, the Stanford Band and the
team, the three contributors of dignity to the
Farm's Saturday contest, should definitely be
supported and make the Stanford students,
alumni and friends proud that the team is really
in there pitching.
Stanford's rather unexpected victory over the
Northwestern Wildcats Saturday certainly more
than fulfilled the hope of Stanford's alumni, stu
dents and a few of the sports experts, but by the
same token it left much to be desired in the same
(if not worse) cheering section under the direc
tion (to use the word uselessly, or is it loosely)
ol head cheerleader (by default) Ed Borden
kircher.
But aside from a few rather off-color and de
cidedly unwitty jokes, some dangerous card
throwing, a few drops of precipitation, with in
termittent downpours, and some balloons sput
tering and dying overhead, the segregated cheer
ing .section was just the same as it has been for
years and years and years.
Sitting there, watching the snappy band and
Coach Chuck's "Little Red Riding Hood" men
suited up in red capes on the bench, we wondered
why we didn't have a new yell or two, a chance
for the women to try the card stunts and just
plain more organization and pre-planning on the
part of the rah-rah, com-eom, Rally Com.
Observers from the other side as well as those
who meandered down on the field during half
limp, had few good words to say concerning the
card stunts. And this is too bad. Many hours of
hard work go into their planning, and when a
hunch of roughs with the all-important machin
ery in their hands start flashing the wrong cards
at the wrong times, the whole business is thrown
out and the gigantic Cal card section begins to
be recognized as the best in the north half of the
PCC.
