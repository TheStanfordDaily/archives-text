## Poli Union May Host Knowland 
### Barbara Bachman 
Although no major elections
are on tap for this current aca
demic year and last year's big
presidential race has been almost
forgotten in the flurry of the 1960
contest, the Stanford Political
Union will bring many famous
and important political personali
ties to the campus to continue to
inform Stanfordites of goings-on
outside ihe palm-lined campus.
President Kill) u r n MacMur
raugh has hinted of possible vis
its by Vice â€¢ President Richard
Nixon, Go ver no r Goo d w in
Knight, Senator William Know
land, Secretary of the Interior
Fred Seaton and Idaho's young
Senator Frank Church.
With these important persons
giving their rightist, leftist and
middle-of-the-road views on im
portant political and internation
al issues, the Political Union will
continue to emphasize its impor
tant objective as a non-partisan
student organization to keep the
campus abreast of current events.
Ordinary Meeting
An ordinary meeting of the
Political Union is open to the en
tire campus and opens wilh an
address from the main speaker.
Following this, a student pre
sents another viewpoint on the
same issue and the audience is
then invited to question and de
bate tho issues. Often a resolu
tion is drawn up on the topic, and
the audience is given an oppor
tunity to vote on the question at
hand.
Coffee hours and discussion
groups with the visiting dignita
ries are often arranged by Politi
cal Union sponsors to give politi
cal-minded students the opportu
nity to get first-hand information
and become better informed on
affairs.
Open to All
Political Union membership is
open to all students, and active
membership can be obtained by
signing a membership list at two
meetings during the academic
year. Along with this, all per
sons interested in Union work
may find political work on the
Union's many committees.
The Political Union office is lo
cated on the third floor in the
Nitery above the Cellar. Inter
views will be conducted during
the afternoons of this and the fol
lowing week.

physics major is assisted in this
non - partisan organization by
Vice-President Pat Pinkham, a
junior economics major, and
Thayer Conley, program direc

is majoring in political science.
Sponsors Caucuses
In addition to the Political Un
ion's strictly informative pro
gram, the group also sponsors
party caucuses, which give em
phasis to major political parties
and sponsor strictly partisan

to have experts speak informally

interest and participate with stu

ics.
Sylvia Swanson is Democratic
Caucus chairman and Dave Long
is Republican Caucus chairman.
The Independent chairman is still
to be selected.
Senator Barry Goldwater of
Arizona, a right-wing Republican,

make his appearance here Nov. 6.
His topic will be concerned with
the current controversial right
to-work law.

to visit the Farm in early Janu
ary, MacMurraugh reports.
Besides regular routine organi
zation work in the Union, anoth

to work between the Political
Union and the ASSU. Persons
