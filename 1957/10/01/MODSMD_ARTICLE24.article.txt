Very First Time
This is the premiere of P.A.T. as a weekly sports column in The
Daily. It simply means Point After Touchdown.
And while the subject has been brought up, a box score of Stan
ford's progress in this department will appear here each week.
Jack Taylor, the converted quarterback, now playing second
string flanker-back (left half), is the Indians' most consistent P.A.T.
kicker. He has kicked all three of his attempts. Close behind him is
lackle Arniand DeYVeese who has made two for two.
Al Harrington has been back to kick three times, but on the first
try for point after touchdown this season a bad pass from center
went over his head and spoiled the attempt. He missed his only try
against Northwestern.
After the game last Saturday Coach Chuck Taylor intimated that
his namesake, Taylor <no kin), will take over the job against Rice.
The 1!).">7 version of the Big Red Machine has depth this year—
both in the line and in the backfield. Although the Indians' top
ranked punch of Loii Valli and Jim Byrer at fullback will be missed
Jor a couple of games, because of injuries sustained in last week's
game, the Cards still have Chuck Shea and Kick McMillen.
Desire and all-out team unity are the keys to Stanford's victories
thus far this year as pointed out lime after time by Coach Chuck in
interviews. Jack Douglas is a great team leader. And his running
ability, along with a tine arm, will give Stanford the balanced attack
it has always needed*
Here am! There
Hob Garrett, Indian great of the 1953 season, resigned from pro
football this season to go into rhe advertising business in the South
land. He was the Cleveland Browns' bonus choice in the 195:1 NFL
draft. He was traded to Green Bay where he played in 1954 before
going into the Air Force for two years. He was traded back to ihe
Browns last spring. . . . Paul Wiggin, great lineman last season, has
made the Brown learn after the team cut recently. . . . Last year's
end Carl Isaacs did not make the team. . . (Jary Van Haider's wife
is expecting their fir,st child around Big Game time this year. A
victory would make a nice birthday present.
High top shoes are back for all the Cards this year except for
those who particularly like the feel of the low-cuts. During Ihe past
two seasons most every player wore low-cut shoes. . . . Bill Corbns,
All American in 1932-33 and member of the first Vow Boy team,
will he officially welcomed into the National Football Hall of Fame
dining the half-time ceremonies at Big Game on Nov. 23. . . . Bob
Nicolct, currently operating at the second-string quarterback slot,
is potentially the best passer Stanford has ever had—including Mr.
lirodie and Mr. Garrett. And he is a junior.
Move (if Jack Taylor from quarterback to left halfback gives the
second string extra defensive strength. He can kick those P.A.T.'s,
and also tote Ihe ball when called upon. He has already intercepted
one pass this season, against San Jose. Watch for this man on pass
defense against Rice next Saturday night in Houston.
In last Friday's VVSC Evergreen, the student newspaper, the
sports department wrote: "Stanford entertains Northwestern in the
only apparent sure victory for a PCC team."
LATE NOTE: In a recent Sports Illustrated Coach Chuck is
called "the kind of an optimist who could convince the Confederacy
they still have a good chance."
