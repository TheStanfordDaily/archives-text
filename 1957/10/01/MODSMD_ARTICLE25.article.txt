Poulson declared:
"On behalf of all the citizens of
Los Angeles I welcome the Brook
lyn Dodgers and you personally
to this city. Our congratulations
to you on this important occasion
in the history of our national pas
time and of the city of Los An
geles.''

"I am delighted to inform you

and evening, I can assure you
definitely of minimum of 10 votes

favor of proposed ordinance of
transfer of your fine ball club to
this city.

without slightest doubt to give
full legal approval to aforemen
tioned ordinance at council ses

Irrelevant, Absurd
"At today's meeting (if council,
which still continues at this mo
ment in the evening, objections
raised by small minority were
convincingly demonstrated to be
irrelevant and absurd.
"It is with great satisfaction
that we take this opportunity to
notify you that these short-sight
ed and petty efforts to block con
tinued progress of Los Angeles
have proved completely unsuc
cessful."
The council battled all day over
the contract plan and voted down
an amendment which backers of
the Dodger shift said would have
scuttled the plan.
