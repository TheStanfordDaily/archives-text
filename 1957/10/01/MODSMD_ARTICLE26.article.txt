# Who Will Start at Fullback When Cards Meet Owls Saturday Night in Houston?
## 
### 
It looks as though the first
PCC team ever to play in Hous
ton, Texas will be starting its
third or fourth-string fulback
when the Stanford Indians go
into action at Rice Stadium next
Saturday night. But, surprising
ly enough, this is not cause for
great concern.
With the services of first-liner
Lou Vail i still very much in
doubt, Coach Chuck Taylor may
have to give the starting nod to
Chuck Shea, Rick McMillen or
Dick Childs.
Shea provided a highlight in
Saturday's contest when, filling
in for the injured Valli, he aver
aged 4.98 yards per carry while
toting the oval 20 times. McMil
len, too, was impressive in aver
aging 7.3 yards in three carries.
Not I Jntil Thursday
Valli who injured his knee on
Saturday, was first reported defi
nitely out of action for the Rice
tilt. Yesterday, however, at the
Football Writers' lun c h eon,
Coach Taylor intimated that Val
li might be ready for Ihe week
end. Trainer Connie Jarvis re
ports that nothing will be known
until Thursday.
In any event Taylor's No. 1 re
placement Jim Byrer will defi
nitely not be a possibility. By
rer's chest injury will keep him
not only out of the game, but
probably at Stanford. He is under
observation now.
In yesterday's workout Shea
was in operation with the first
team, while Rick McMillen was
moved up to play with the No. 2
squad. Childs and halfback A 1
Napoleon played in the fullback
slot with the third unit.
Center John Thomas, who
came away from the Wildcat tilt
with a broken nose, was back in
action and planning to go against
the Rice Owls this weekend.
No-Contact
Yesterday's no-contact practice
session featured passing, pass
protection and offensive polish
work for the Cards. End Dick
Stein started with the first squad,
with Joel Fries getting a chance
to work with them later on.
How the Indians will prepare
defensively for the Owls is cur
rently a mystery. Two weeks

I ago the Owls advanced both on
| the ground and in the air to over
| come Louisiana State.
It is figured that in King Hill
and Frank Ryan, Rice's two sen
! ior passing quarterbacks, will
j come the first big test of Cardi
nal pass defense. From their
pass protection work in practice
jit looks as if the locals are count
ing on this.
Under Lights
There has been no comment as
to whether or not the Injuns will
work once or twice under the
lights before they get to Rice
j Stadium.
The Stanford squad last played
j under Ihe lights in the 1956 sea

son opener against Washington
State College In Spokane.
Last night the Stanford squad
saw pictures of their contest with
the Wildcats and heard the scout
ing reports of assistant coach
George Lynn. These reports were
brief, however, as the Owl team
was idle last weekend.
Thus two factors are in Rice's
favor. First, the Houston team
has two weeks in which 1o pre
pare for Stanford. And they can
work from a pair of scouting re
ports in so doing. Not only that,
but the entire Texas squad
turned scouts last week while
watching the Indians glide over
Northwestern.
