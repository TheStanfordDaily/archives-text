# Mantle, Skowron Doubtful Starters; Ford Faces Spahn
## 
### 
NEW YORK (/P) â€”Whitey Ford |
will face veteran Warren Spahn j
in a batlle of left-handed pitchers |
when the World Series opens to- |
morrow at Yankee Stadium, with
the New York Yankees favored '
at 8 to 5 over the Milwaukee (
Braves.
The status of both Mickey Man-1
lie and Bill Skowron of the Yanks |
remained doubtful after a morn- j
ing workout at the stadium. The
best guess is that both will start j
against Spahn, however.
Mantle said his left leg still i
bothered him, especially when he
had to throw his full weight on it. j
Batting right-handed, as he would j
against Spahn, the switcher ex-j
pected no serious difficulty.
Skowron swung freely, driving j
several balls into the left-field!
stands, and said his strained back i
didn't bother him in infield work ;
at first base.
