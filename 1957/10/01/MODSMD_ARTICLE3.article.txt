# DANGEROUS INTERSECTION
## Los Arboles Road Will Close Beginning Friday 
### 
Los Arboles Road, a "back door" to the Stanford campus from
Foothill Road, will bo closed to traffic starting this Friday.
Campus-bound cars will continue In use the Mayfield Avenue en
lance to reach their destinations. Others can use Page Mill and
Willow Roads to by-pass the campus area.

University officials said it has
become necessary to close Los
Arboles because of the dangerousl
intersection now existing where it:
meets Foothill, across from the
road to the golf course clubhouse, j
Engineers' Estimate
Santa Clara County engineers'
have estimated that it would cost I
$25,000 to construct a safe inter
section. They "strongly recom-!
mend" that Los Arboles be closed.'
Blockades are being installed
now, and the University is making
minor repairs to the road in prep
aration for its temporary use by
emergency vehicles and in han
dling extraordinary heavy campus
traffic during football games. The
blockades at each end of Los Ar
boles will be removed on such
occasions.
Stanford officials indicated that
an entirely new connection be
tween Foothill and the campus
may become feasible when re
routing of traffic within the cam
pus area is completed.
Rerouting Plans
Current plans for rerouting
campus traffic call for the en
circlement of the principal aca
demic and dormitory areas by
Campus Drive. This drive cur- i
rently runs from the soccer field
to the edge of Lake Lagunita near
Florence Moore Hall.
Once the proposed extension of
Campus Drive around the campus
is completed, a convenient connee-1
tion between Foothill Road and
Campus Drive may be worked out. j
