ly to hand their resignations to
President Rene Coty.
No Resignation
Coty asked Bourges - Manoury
to stay on for the present. A
communique said the president
told the premier he could not ac
cept the resignation "at this' time
and in present circumstances."
This means that a precedent set
last spring would be followed
again. Then Premier Guy Mollet,
although eager to resign, was in
duced to remain and handle cur
rent business for several weeks
until a new man could be found
to form a government. That man
was Bourges-Manoury.
18th Government
His government is France's
18th since World War 11.
Leading the opposition were
about 150 Communists, 34 Pou
jadists, about 15 Social Republi
cans, former de Gaullists and
some Radical Socialists.
Independents'
With these forces evenly
matched the balance of power lay
in the votes of about 100 inde
pendents. peasant party mem
bers and others. A majority
sided against the government.
Bourges • Manoury's measure
would give Algeria internal au
tonomy through six or seven lo
cal assemblies. French settlers
probably would dominate two of
the assemblies in areas where
they are concentrated, the Alge
rians the remainder.
Despite the vagueness of the
powers of this federal body, it ex
cited the opposition of rightists,
who feared it would open the
way to Ihe outright independence
of Algeria. Cbmmunists and fel
low-traveling progressives joined
the opposition because they want
independence for the Algerians
now.
