## Be Heady for 700 Tomorrow; Encina Opens as New Hospital Overflow From Hospital Goes Into Old Dorm 
### Bob Ellis 
Encina Hall officially became
Encina Infirmary yesterday as
overflow patients from rest
homes and the Isolation Hospital
were admitted for treatment of
respiratory infections.
The first patient was admitted
shortly before noon. By 8 p.m.
the total had risen to 14 men and
6 women in Encina. The total
including those in other facilities
was 74, as Stanford illnesses
doubled over normal years.
The infirmary was opened after
the rest homes and the Isolation
Hospital were filled at 8:30 p.m.
Sunday. These facilities accom
modate 54 persons.
Encina Infirmary
Those students now in the new
Encina Infirmary are:
Jack Abbott, Philip Berry,
Joyce Denebrink, Stephen For
rand, Jo Anne Gilmer, Gabrielle
Greer, William Hillhouse, David

rifield, Geoffrey Newocmb, Carl
Peterson, Susan Piatt, Barbara
Reed, Patrick Shoekcy, Anne
Tomiinson, James Vandergrast,
Gordon Wickersham.
In addition, five or six students
had to be returned to their dorms j
because the facilities were filled j
and it was too late tr> open En-!
cina, according to Director of the
Health Service George 11. Houck.
These students were transferred
to Encina yesterday.
"Gentle Tap"
Dr. Houck said "We're on top
of it. We haven't been hit yet,
but just received a gentle tap."
He emphasized that the stu
dents are ill with various forms |
of respiratory infections, not nec
essarily influenza.
It is too early to determine .just |
what is wrong with many of the
students, he said.
Students in Men's Rest Home |
are Don Goffinet, Norman Karns,
Robert Martin, David McLaren,
Richard Mickley, John Miller,
Scott Moore, Thomas O'Connell,!
John Reiber, James Robertson.
Those in Women's Rest Home
are Brooksley Born, Nina Elkins,
JoAnn Geviutz, Virginia Mack,
Mary Lou McKinley, Margaret
Moser, Gayl Shaw, Joanne Wood.
Twice as Many
About twice as many cases as
usual for the first week of school
have been reported, but all are
mild, Dr. Houck continued.
"Fully half have the ordinary
stuff you see every year at this
time," he said.
Meanwhile, his staff is getting
prepared in case of a serious out-1
break. Two wings on the second
floor of Encina have been j
opened, one for men and one for |
women. Each wing has 60 beds. ;
If the need arises, they can ac
commodate up to 450 persons.
Dr. Houck plans to use the iso- 1
lation Hospital as the backbone j
of the facilities, opening and clos
ing Encina as necessary.
