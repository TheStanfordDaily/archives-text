# IFC Passes Plan Liberalizing No-Contact Rush Regulations
## Actives and Frosh May Have More Contacts; Discuss Proposals for Open Houses in Winter 
### 
Iniorfraternity Council met last night for the second time in less
than a week and passed part of a new rushing program, dealing
mainly with changes in the no-contact rule, which it will present to
the University in conjunction with the Interclub Council as soon as
final details are worked out.
John Kidd, chairman of the IFC Rushing Committee, presented a

resolution which was accepted by
the 24 house presidents. It stated
that there will he normal social
relations between fraternity and
club men and freshmen except
that no freshmen will be allowed
in fraternity houses or clubs, no
affiliated men will be allowed in
Wilbur, and no freshmen will be
permitted at fraternity or club
off-campus parties.
What that means generally is
that fraternity and club men will
be able to talk to freshmen on
Quad.
The new proposal stands a
good chance of being accepted by
the University because school of
ficials and sponsors came to the
IFC last spring with grievances
about the great pressure of rush
ing on freshmen and its effect on
grades, and this is a direct at
tempt to meet these problems
and put a more relaxed atmos
phere into rushing.
It also formally wrote a pro
vision into the no-contact rule to
eliminate fraternity and club
men making phone calls to fresh
men at Wilbur.
