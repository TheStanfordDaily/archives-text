# Architect Sees Design Efficiency As Solution to World Problems
## 'More With Lens' Forms Creed of Tuesday Speaker 
### Barbara Hicks 
Doing more with loss will be
the key to future developments,
R. Buckminster Fuller told the
audience at the first autumn
quarter Tuesday Evening Series
program last night in Memorial
Auditorium.
Fuller, designer of the Ford Ro
tunda in Dearborn, Mich., and
originator of the Dymaxion Creed
•—that of maximum gain of ad
vantage from minimal energy in
put—advanced his theory as the
solution tf) the present dilemma
facing man regarding resources.
He said that man's problems
will not "be solved by political
ingenuity but by new strategy,
that of design.
"The only thing a political lead
er can do to extend resources,"
he said, "is to organize inade
quacy."
Low Efficiency
The designer pointed out that
in using all the resources of the
world only one-third of mankind
is served and operations are at
4 per cent efficiency.
He said that through new de
signs upping efficiency to 12 per
cent, standards of all men could
be raised. He noted that electric
generators operate at 35 per cent
efficiency and it is reasonable to
believe that over-all efficiency
can be increased.
"There is an entirely new chal
lenge," he said. "There is the pos
sibility of designing ourselves out
of our troubles."
Fuller began his studies in 1927
when he was "frustrated and
frightened when told that 'you
must first earn a living; then you
can do something else.'" This
seemed to be blind reasoning to
the designer, who then launched
into a 25-year program to advance
his theory.
Total Experience
In his studies, Fuller said, he
found that while industrialization
is a total experience, in contrast
to the local and individual experi
ence of crafts, industrialization
could be affected by an individual,
and he pointed to himself as an
example.
He emphasized that advance
ments are made through acceler
ated evolution, not by teamwork.
He said this evolution is a chal
lenge-and-response t e c h n i q u e
which may result in the control
of environment.
"If designs are for high per
formance," Fuller said, "the en
vironment can be controlled." He
noted the standards of technology
for aircraft which control the en
vironment of air.
New Challenges
New challenges will be created
in tlie next decade, Fuller said,
using the example of travel. He
predicted that in 1965 the earth
will be a one-town world where
men can do business on one side
of the world and be on the other
for dinner the same day.
"This will put added stress on
the resources of the earth," he
said, emphasizing that the solu
tion is design.
Since he kept his audience 15
minutes overtime with anecdotes
of his career, Fuller had no time
to show slides illustrating his geo
desic design. He said the dome he
designed for the Jford Rotunda
weighs l->» that of regular domes.
Other lightweight domes of Fitl
ler's geodesic design have been
flown into place for military and
industrial use.

changing world. —Daily Photo by Pete Tracy
