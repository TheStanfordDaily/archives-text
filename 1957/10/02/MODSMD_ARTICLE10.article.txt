# Ike Refuses to Remove Troops from Little Rock
## Says Faubus Gave No Assurance To Use Powers for Integration 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 1 ) President Eisenhower refused last night to
order federal troops out of Little Rock, Ark.
He took the position that Governor Orval Faubus had not given
ironclad assurances that the governor would use his full powers to
prevent obstruction of school integration orders of a federal court.

Thus, efforts to settle the inte
gration crisis in the Arkansas
capital collapsed, at least for the
time being, just as they seemed
on the point of fulfillment.
Faubus Statement
Faubus had issued a statement
at Little Rock declaring that:
"I now declare, that upon with
drawal of federal troops, I will
again assume full responsibility,
in co-operation with local author
ities, for the maintenance of law
and order, and that the orders of
the federal courts will not be ob
structed by me."
After a lengthy conference
with White House staff members,
Eisenhower came back last night
with this statement:
"The statement issued this eve
ning by the governor of Arkansas
does not constitute, in my opin
ion, the assurance that he intends
to use his full powers as gover
nor to prevent the obstruction of
the orders of the U.S. District
Court. Under the circumstances,
the President of the United
States has no recourse at the
present time except to maintain
federal surveillance of the situa
tion.
Co-operative Attitude
"I want to commend the gov
ernors representing the Southern
■Governors Conference for their
co-operative attitude at the meet
ing today. I hope that they will
continue their efforts, as well as
the federal government, to bring
about a basis for the withdrawal
of federal forces in Little Ilock
and for the orderly carrying out
of the orders of the district
court."
Eisenhower was referring to
the governors of North Carolina,
Tennessee, Florida and Maryland,
who met with him at length to
day and left with the expressed
conviction that they had worked
out with the President a plan for
solving the troop issue in Little
Rock.

the orders of the U.S. District
Court. Under the circumstances,
the President of the United
States has no recourse at the
present time except to maintain
federal surveillance of the situa
tion.
Co-operative Attitude
"I want to commend the gov
ernors representing the Southern
■Governors Conference for their
co-operative attitude at the meet
ing today. I hope that they will
continue their efforts, as well as
the federal government, to bring
about a basis for the withdrawal
of federal forces in Little Ilock
and for the orderly carrying out
of the orders of the district
court."
Eisenhower was referring to
the governors of North Carolina,
Tennessee, Florida and Maryland,
who met with him at length to
day and left with the expressed
conviction that they had worked
out with the President a plan for
solving the troop issue in Little
Rock.

WASHINGTON (/I 1 ) President Eisenhower refused last night to
order federal troops out of Little Rock, Ark.
He took the position that Governor Orval Faubus had not given
ironclad assurances that the governor would use his full powers to
prevent obstruction of school integration orders of a federal court.

Thus, efforts to settle the inte
gration crisis in the Arkansas
capital collapsed, at least for the
time being, just as they seemed
on the point of fulfillment.
Faubus Statement
Faubus had issued a statement
at Little Rock declaring that:
"I now declare, that upon with
drawal of federal troops, I will
again assume full responsibility,
in co-operation with local author
ities, for the maintenance of law
and order, and that the orders of
the federal courts will not be ob
structed by me."
After a lengthy conference
with White House staff members,
Eisenhower came back last night
with this statement:
"The statement issued this eve
ning by the governor of Arkansas
does not constitute, in my opin
ion, the assurance that he intends
to use his full powers as gover
nor to prevent the obstruction of
the orders of the U.S. District
Court. Under the circumstances,
the President of the United
States has no recourse at the
present time except to maintain
federal surveillance of the situa
tion.
