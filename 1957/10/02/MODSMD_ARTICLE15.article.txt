# Cure Rather Than Strangle

Tin m\K. A\D Fil.r. of labor arc an integral
pari of American society, ami, as such, exert
mucli influence upon the political scene.
The most militant spokesmen from the ranks
of labor come from that segment which is
organized into collective 1 bargaining groups
termed unions. Thus ii is that labor unions
are, by virtue of their organization, the spokes
men for the whole of labor.
No arguments need be put forth in support
of the existence of unions. Indeed, to argue
against existence of these groups is to argue for
the disruption of the American economy; only
lilll< demagogues with self-important crusades
whose concern is not for the welfare ol the
American people—only these little men still
preach against such existence.
Organized labor, however strong its moral
existence, is still under obligation to the Amer
ican people. The welfare of the people as a
whole still comes before the welfare ol any one
segment. And it would be well for labor to
keep litis in mind.
Americans have been filled the past few
months with revelations of corruption among
some of the larger unions. Some eager dema
gogues have hopped on the hand wagon of dis
gust for the corruption, and have been advo
cating measures some of which if they were
lo be put into effect —would strangle rather
than cure the deficiencies that presently occupy
the labor movement.
As Americans, we must be sure thai our argu

ments are dictated by reason if we are going
to criticize at all any part of organized labor.
We must be sure of where we stand on this
question.
But regardless of how pro- or how anti-labor
we may be, v\e do know that measures must be
taken somewhere to insure thai future Becks,
Bridgeses and Hollas will no! be in a position
to hurl the honest efforts of organized labor.
But where are these measures to come from?
Logically and properly, they should come
from organized labor itself. And some action
is coming from litem: at least, from llie Kxecu
live Committee of the AFL-CIO. What this
group is doing is good, and will he beneficial
lo both labor and the American people in the
long run. The question is: \\ ili litis be enough?
Presumably not —at least not so far as we
can tell at the present time. Something more
will probablv need lo be undertaken during
the next session of Congress. And here there
is a danger.
If Congress gets carried away, the labor
movement could actually be hurt rather than
helped. But congressional action is molded by
public opinion, and enough public pressure
should be brought to bear upon Congress to
cure the deficiencies rather than hobble labor.
In the interests of a sound American econ
omy it is up to us to keep ourselves fully in
formed on this subject, even though we may
not be laboring men and women. It is not just
labor's welfare at stake: it is our welfare too.
