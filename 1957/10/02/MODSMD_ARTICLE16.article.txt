# The 						Closing of Los Arboles
## 
### 
TllK ANNOIINCIMF.NT that Los Arboles Road
will be closed because of the dangerous Foot
-11 ill Road intersection lias undoubtedly made
;i number of Stanford students unhappy. Many
students live in Menlo I'ark, Atlierton and
Portola Valley, whose most direct route lo the
campus is via Loh Arboles from 112 oothill.
The only remaining route lo the campus
area is by way of Mayfield Avenue, a route that
will inconvenience students who live along
Mayfield as well as the students who will be
forced to make the devious detour lo reach
the campus.
Considering the fact, that there are 4800
Ktudent automobiles on the campus alone, and
that many students use Mayfield as a route to
dormitories and How houses, the increased
traftic resulting from tiie closing of Los Arboles
i< certain to create additional hazards during
morning and evening rush hours.

It is true that the Los Arboles—Foothill in
tersection is unsafe. The road is filled with
holes and is covered with loose dirt at the point
where Los Arboles intersects. I here is also a
considerable grade at Ihe intersection, which
was built up when Foothill was widened and
repaved last- year.
Santa Clara County engineers have estimated
thai il would cost $25,00(1 lo construct a safe
intersection. One can only wonder why the
intersection was not rebuilt al ihe lime that
Foothill was being repaired.
With the permanent closing of Los Arboles,
it is hoped that llic completion of Campus
Drive into a peripheral road will he hastened
to relieve the jamming of present campus
roads. Bui il is imperative thai.some link he
made immediately between the west end of the
campus and a main Irafiic artery.
