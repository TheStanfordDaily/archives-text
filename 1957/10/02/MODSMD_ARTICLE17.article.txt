Thanks to A Phi O
Editor, The Daily:
Wo wish to extend publicly our sincere thanks
and appreciation to the men of Alpha Phi Omega
for the excellent job they did in helping ihe
freshman women into Branner and Roble on
Sept. 18.
Hundreds of suitcases, trunks and boxes were
transported promptly and efficiently throughout
the day by industrious A Phi () crews.
We only hope that future groups of incoming
freshmen may be treated to the same courteous
service.

Thoughtful and Well Done Story
Editor, The Daily:
Rita Robison's article in The Daily, Sept. 27,
on the over-all picture of incomes for institutions
in higher education was, I thought, a particu
larly thoughtful and well done story. Congratu
lations to you and to her for putting into capsule
form this significant observation on the financial
problems faced by universities.

Little Rock, Arcantsaw
Glad youall is a upholin States Rites an am
proud uv yuh as Ah am uv my sore loe, an uv
Ihe menny Christians wat is a whoopin an a
yellin with yuh- -Christians who no durn well
Christ warnt no Jew, in spite uv roomers he wuz.
Yuh no an I no that effen the neegrows had the
brains like us whites is got, they'd bee able to
git thru sckool in six months like we did, an
wouldnt. want to go to skool nohow.
Ahm beginnin to think us Southern gennul
men maid a bad mistake wen we let the Dam
Yankees git Ihe notion they won the Sivil War.
Theys a lot uv talk in the noospapers now about
the Konstitution, whatever that is. Any way I
hear the Konstitution happened over a hundred
years ago.
My boy sez the Rooshins is glad were a keepin
the Neegrows out down here; an theyre tellin
all the world about it and too thurds uv the
world is colored people an they air verry mad.
But my boy has went to school into the 8 grade
an reeds books an has got sum funny noshuns
wich 1 would lick out uv him but he is as big as
me an still growin an lots uv these whites down
hear has bekum neegrow lovers in their thinkin
an I aint.
Ah am verry glad our Arcantsaw guvement,
Yore part uv it any way, is a standin up fur
State Rites. Ef you got any Konfedrate Dollar
bills, I'd bee glad to git one by male, as the sine
uv the good ole daze.
Sincerely,
Jeff Davis Jones
P.S.—I cum to this hero Palo Alto-Stanford
zoan to visit wich wuz a mistake as I now no.
Ah am a sendin this letter to a noospaper here
wich wont git printed cause their readers is so
dum. Another thing a worryin me now is my
boy mighl hear about this Stanford university
an make up his mine to kum here an Ide hav a
awful time a preventin him.
