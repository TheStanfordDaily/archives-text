# France Tangled in Worst Crisis Since World War
## 
### 
PARIS (/P) â€”France yesterday started dealing with what gener
ally was agreed to be the nation's gravest crisis since World War 11.
The government of Premier Maurice Bourges-Maunoury, defeated
Monday night in a confidence vote over Algeria, was serving only
until a new premier could be found. The Algerian rebellion, after

three bloody years, still had no
end in sight. The franc was slip
ping and prices were going up.
Strikes were breaking out or
threatening.
As the politicians began their
usual shuttle in and out of Presi
dent Reno Coty's office in the
quest for a solution, the man in
the street seemed openly dis
gusted.
The realization was being
brought home to many that this
might not be just another govern
ment turnover like the others that
have studded the 10 years since
the Fourth Republic was founded.
Bourges-Maunoury's government
was the 23rd since the war.
Some of the questions raised in
clude: Does the constitution real
ly work? If it doesn't, what is to
be done about it?
There were some who talked of
a possible appeal to Gen. Charles
de Gaulle, who has remained in
the background since stepping
down as provisional president in
the early days of 1910.
But his terms are high. They
call for a drastic change with es
tablishment of a strong executive
on the U.S. model. Few French
men appeared ready to take that
step yet.
Coty called in the legislative
chiefs, the head of the National
Economic Council and former pr e
miers and party leaders for con
sultations. Their silence as they
left the President's office empha
sized the gravity of the situation.
The 279-253 vote against Bour
ges-Maunoury was short of the
absolute majority of the 596 As
sembly total which would have
forced the premier to resign.
