# YANKEES, 8-5
## New York, Milwaukee Open Series; Stengel to Start Mantle, Skowron 
### 
NEW YORK (JP)- Both Mickey
Mantle and Bill Skowron are ten
tative New York Yankee starters
in today's World Series opener
against the fit and ready Milwau
kee Braves at Yankee Stadium.
With comfortable weather pre
dicted, a crowd of about 70,000 is
expected to jam the big ball park
for the Yanks' 23rd Series. Game
lime is 9 a.m., Pacific standard
time, wiih wide-flung radio and
television (NBC) coverage.

The physical condition of Man
tle and Skowron continues to bo
the most important news item as
both managers have named their
starting pitchers. Whitey Ford
(11-5) of the Yanks and Warren
Spahn 121-11) of the Braves will
hook up in a battle of left-handers.
Although Ford has been handi
capped by a sore shoulder, he hit
his true stride in early September
and has been groomed for this
important "m on e y game" by
Coach Jim Turner.
Spahn, 36-year-old Milwaukee
ace, has been manager Fred Ha
ney's big "stopper" for two years.
Most observers figure the Braves
will need at least two victories
from Spahn if they are going to
upset the Yanks, who go into the
Series as 8-to-5 favorites (7 to 5
in the opener).
Stengel Misses Workout
Manager Casey Stengel missed
his club's final workout because
he was meeting with Commission
er Fbrd Friek, Haney and the um
pires to go over ground rules and
other Series details.
11 was over in time for Haney
to hurry to the stadium for the
Braves' afternoon drill. As most
of the Milwaukee players never

had seen the stadium, it was a
particularly important workout.
On the basis of reports from his
ailing stars, Stengel named both
Mantle and Skowron to his prob

able lineup with certain reserva
t ions.
"They're not 100 per cent," said
Stengel. "Both are willing to
start, but they don't know how
far they can go. If I find out . . .
they can't play, I'll demand an
other man. Once you start a Se
ries you can't ask for any replace
ments."
Stengel wouldn't say whom he
had in mind as possible replace
ments. However, most observers
thought it was unlikely he would
make any such move.
If Mantle, troubled by a sore
left leg, and Skowron, whose back
hurts when he runs, aren't able to
start, certainly they would be
more valuable as pinch hitters
than anybody he could bring up.
Braves' Bonus Player
The Braves received permission
to add outfielder John DeMerit, a
bonus player from the University
of Wisconsin, to the eligible list.
1-Ie takes the place of centerfielder
Bill Bruton, who suffered a knee
injury in July and hasn't played
since.
DeMerit has appeared in 33
games and has a .147 batting av
erage. Actually he has been used
as a pinch runner on most occa
sions and probably will see action
in a similar capacity in the Series.

Stengel wouldn't say whom he
had in mind as possible replace
ments. However, most observers
thought it was unlikely he would
make any such move.
If Mantle, troubled by a sore
left leg, and Skowron, whose back
hurts when he runs, aren't able to
start, certainly they would be
more valuable as pinch hitters
than anybody he could bring up.
Braves' Bonus Player
The Braves received permission
to add outfielder John DeMerit, a
bonus player from the University
of Wisconsin, to the eligible list.
1-Ie takes the place of centerfielder
Bill Bruton, who suffered a knee
injury in July and hasn't played
since.
DeMerit has appeared in 33
games and has a .147 batting av
erage. Actually he has been used
as a pinch runner on most occa
sions and probably will see action
in a similar capacity in the Series.
NEW YORK (JP)- Both Mickey
Mantle and Bill Skowron are ten
tative New York Yankee starters
in today's World Series opener
against the fit and ready Milwau
kee Braves at Yankee Stadium.
With comfortable weather pre
dicted, a crowd of about 70,000 is
expected to jam the big ball park
for the Yanks' 23rd Series. Game
lime is 9 a.m., Pacific standard
time, wiih wide-flung radio and
television (NBC) coverage.
Southpaws Go
The physical condition of Man
tle and Skowron continues to bo
the most important news item as
both managers have named their
starting pitchers. Whitey Ford
(11-5) of the Yanks and Warren
Spahn 121-11) of the Braves will
hook up in a battle of left-handers.
Although Ford has been handi
capped by a sore shoulder, he hit
his true stride in early September
and has been groomed for this
important "m on e y game" by
Coach Jim Turner.
Spahn, 36-year-old Milwaukee
ace, has been manager Fred Ha
ney's big "stopper" for two years.
Most observers figure the Braves
will need at least two victories
from Spahn if they are going to
upset the Yanks, who go into the
Series as 8-to-5 favorites (7 to 5
in the opener).
Stengel Misses Workout
Manager Casey Stengel missed
his club's final workout because
he was meeting with Commission
er Fbrd Friek, Haney and the um
pires to go over ground rules and
other Series details.
11 was over in time for Haney
to hurry to the stadium for the
Braves' afternoon drill. As most
of the Milwaukee players never

had seen the stadium, it was a
particularly important workout.
On the basis of reports from his
ailing stars, Stengel named both
Mantle and Skowron to his prob

able lineup with certain reserva
t ions.
"They're not 100 per cent," said
Stengel. "Both are willing to
start, but they don't know how
far they can go. If I find out . . .
they can't play, I'll demand an
other man. Once you start a Se
ries you can't ask for any replace
ments."
