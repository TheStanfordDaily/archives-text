## 
### 
NEW YORK (TP) — The New
York Giants took two long steps
toward moving to the Pacific
Coast yesterday but the Brooklyn
Dodgers were forced to mark
lime in a similar move.
Horace Stoncham, president of
Ihe Giants, gave formal notice of
his intention to move to San
Francisco, as required by base
ball law, then quickly came to an
agreement with General Manager
Joe Cronin of the Boston Red
Sox for the purchase of San
Francisco's Pacific Coast League
franchise from Boston.
President Walter O'Malley of
Ihe Dodgers, who would like to
shift his club to Los Angeles, ex
plained his reasons for delaying
a decision at a special National

! League meeting and was prompt
■ ly given an extension of time
through Oct. 15.
O'Malley still has not received
a final offer from the Los Ange
les City Council of the terms it
will make to get the Brooklyn
club. He says he can't reach a
definite decision until he gets it.
The council discussed a pro
posed ordinance at length Mon
day but failed to muster the un
animous vote needed to pass it.
