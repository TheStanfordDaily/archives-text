# Indians Await First Test In Tilt With Rice Owls
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor is waiting
for some team to test the defen
sive prowess of the Stanford In
dians. In interviews over the past
two weeks he has withheld com
ment on this phase of his squad's
operation, saying, in effect, that
it hasn't been tested.
This, then, looks like the week
of the big test. When the Cards
trample out on the Rice Stadium
turf this Saturday nighl they will
take on what appears to be the
stiffest competition they have met
this year.
And, what's more, they'll "be
meeting a team which operates in
a very similar manner to their
own. Just what effect this will
have on the local heroes remains
to be seen, but the result will be
an interesting one, regardless of
what it is.
Passing Game Likely
If it's a passing game Taylor is
looking for, he's very likely to get
just that. Owl quarterbacks King
Hill and Frank Ryan are both ex
ceptional throwers. Both connect
ed on 55 per cent of their heaves
in the '56 season.
And on the receiving end the
Rice team fares well. Top-rated
end Buddy Dial will no doubt
make trouble for the Indians. In
a fine sophomore campaign last
year he nabbed 21 aerials, return
ing them for 357 yards and five
touchdowns.
This year the Owls seem equal
ly as strong above the ground.
In their opener against LSU two
weeks ago the passing duo con
nected on 10 of 15 throws for 164
yards. Dial was on the receiving
end for four of those, gaining 104
yards that way.
But if it's a running game that
Taylor is looking for, he's likely
to find that, too. And here again
Hill and Ryan might just do the
Injuns in. Both these men are all
around dangers. Both started
their football careers as halfbacks
and now either one of them can
play that spot when the other
calls signals.
More Trouble
But there's more to the Rice
back field than just these two.
Fullback Dave Kelley was one of
the stalwarts in the 251 yards that
the Owls gained over LSU on the
ground. He carried 11 times, gain
ing 78 yards for a 7.1 average.
Fullback Ray Chilton and half
backs Pat Bailey and Bill Bucek
were other factors in the Rice win
two weeks ago. They were con
sistent ground gainers.
Owl mentor Jess Neely has
promised a better team than the
one which finished seventh in the
Southwest Conference last year.
The Texans won four games last
year, but three of them were easy
triumphs over weak foes, and
only one of them was a confer
ence tilt.
Weakness al Tackle
Football experts were a little
doubtful about crediting Neely's
prediction, because of his weak
ness at one tackle slot and the
lack of depth in the line. Rice's
only solid tackle is All-American

candidate Larry Whitmire. Tho
other tackle post, as well as the
rest of the line, is rated only ade
quate.
Rice has been compared to
Stanford by many writers in both
size and style. "A good team,"
the experts said, "that throws and
catches well." They are not a big
team.
The Texans' win over Louisiana
State raised a few eyebrows in
the statistics column, where the
Owls led the Tigers in every one
of the many departments.
Defense Stressed
In preparing for the Rice tilt,
Chuck Taylor's Indians yesterday
spent their time in a 2-hour-and
-15-minute practice, working on de
fense strategy against Rice's pro
posed plays.
Card linemen worked on block
ing mainly, and there was a slight
emphasis in the passing depart
ment, offensively and defensively.
Planning not to have the trou
blesome point-after trouble, Tay
lor had Jackie Taylor, Armand
DeWeese, Eric Protiva and Bob
Nicolet kicking at the goal posts.
Sports people are giving Ihe In
dians the edge lor the Saturday
night tilt, but neither the Indians
nor the Owls feel the game is any
where near settled.
