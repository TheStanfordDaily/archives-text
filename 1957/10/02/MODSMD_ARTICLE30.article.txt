## 
### Barbara Bachman 
The yearly appearance of for
mer United States President Her
bert Hoover, a name change, and
the visit, of some 73,000 guests
highlighted the University's fis
cal year at Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace.
Hoover, the Institution's found
er, former University student,
present benefactor and member
of the Board of Trustees, spent
several weeks in the Stanford
area this summer, reviewing the
work of the Institution and at
tending the annual trustees'
meeting.
On Hoover's recommendation,
the former name, Hoover Insti
tute and Library on War, Revo
lution and Peace, was changed to
Hoover Institution on War, Revo
lution and Peace, July 18. The
new name was chosen to give
greater emphasis to the dynamic
character of the work being done
in the Institution.
20 Million Items
The Institution, which houses
more than 20 million items per
taining to the 20th century, is di
rected toward the purpose of
guiding future generations in the
direction of peace, as a result of
the si tidy of war documents of
the First and Second World Wars.
About 73,000 persons from all
over the United States, its terri
tories and many foreign coun
tries toured the building and its
285-foot tower during the period
Sept. 1, 1956, to Aug. 31, 1957,
Mrs. Inez .Richardson, executive
assistant and research associate
at the Institution, reports.
The period of June to August
saw the greatest number of visi
tors at the tower, when 25,081
persons signed the register in the
main lobby. This large number
was especially attributed to the
scientific convention held on the

campus as part of the observance
of the International Geophysical
Year.
Promote Peace
"The purpose of this institu
tion is to promote peace. Its rec
ords stand as a challenge to those
who promote war. They should
attract those who search for
peace. I therefore dedicate this
building to these purposes."
With these words, Herbert
Hoover dedicated the library on
June 20, 1941.
This year he spoke before the
staff of the Institution on Aug. 21
and quite informally traced the
history of the Institution from
its idea to a thriving reality, Mrs.
Richardson said.
Did he register approval with
what he found here?
Hoover Quiet
"Mr. Hoover is a very quiet
person," Mrs. Richardson an
swered, "and merely the fact that
he approves of the dynamic on
going quality and characteristics
of the Institution shows that he
approves of it.
"He's not the type to go around
beating the drums for Hoover
Tower, you know," she conclud
ed.
Currently the library houses
such important papers as gov
ernment documents, books and
pamphlets, newspapers, records
of parties, learned societies, ar
chives, posters and maps.
Recent acquisitions at the li
brary include:
• 5000 items of past and pres
ent regimes from Peking, China.
This is the first major shipment
of documents released by the Chi
nese Communists.
• 2500 books and pamphlets
from the Soviet Union and East
ern Europe, including three vol
umes of documents on Soviet for
eign policy which are the only
ones outside the Soviet Union.
• Clandestine publications of
the Japanese Communist party,
camouflaged with covers entitled
"How to Grow Bulbs" and"The
Way to Health."
• Palestinian Arab propagan
da materials — presented to the
Hoover Institution by the Mufti
of Jerusalem.
• Photographic prints of Ger
man Foreign Office documents
covering the years 1937-1945, the
only set outside government cir
cles.

About 73,000 persons from all
over the United States, its terri

285-foot tower during the period
Sept. 1, 1956, to Aug. 31, 1957,
Mrs. Inez .Richardson, executive
assistant and research associate
at the Institution, reports.
The period of June to August
saw the greatest number of visi
tors at the tower, when 25,081
persons signed the register in the
main lobby. This large number
was especially attributed to the
scientific convention held on the

campus as part of the observance
of the International Geophysical
Year.
Promote Peace
"The purpose of this institu
tion is to promote peace. Its rec
ords stand as a challenge to those
who promote war. They should
attract those who search for
peace. I therefore dedicate this
building to these purposes."
With these words, Herbert
Hoover dedicated the library on
June 20, 1941.
This year he spoke before the
staff of the Institution on Aug. 21
and quite informally traced the
history of the Institution from
its idea to a thriving reality, Mrs.
Richardson said.
Did he register approval with
what he found here?
Hoover Quiet
"Mr. Hoover is a very quiet
person," Mrs. Richardson an
swered, "and merely the fact that
he approves of the dynamic on
going quality and characteristics
of the Institution shows that he
approves of it.
"He's not the type to go around
beating the drums for Hoover
Tower, you know," she conclud
ed.
Currently the library houses
such important papers as gov
ernment documents, books and
pamphlets, newspapers, records
of parties, learned societies, ar
chives, posters and maps.
Recent acquisitions at the li
brary include:
• 5000 items of past and pres
ent regimes from Peking, China.
This is the first major shipment
of documents released by the Chi
nese Communists.
• 2500 books and pamphlets
from the Soviet Union and East
ern Europe, including three vol
umes of documents on Soviet for
eign policy which are the only
ones outside the Soviet Union.
• Clandestine publications of
the Japanese Communist party,
camouflaged with covers entitled
"How to Grow Bulbs" and"The

• Palestinian Arab propagan
da materials — presented to the
Hoover Institution by the Mufti
of Jerusalem.
• Photographic prints of Ger
man Foreign Office documents
covering the years 1937-1945, the
only set outside government cir

The yearly appearance of for
mer United States President Her
bert Hoover, a name change, and
the visit, of some 73,000 guests
highlighted the University's fis

War, Revolution and Peace.
Hoover, the Institution's found

present benefactor and member
of the Board of Trustees, spent
several weeks in the Stanford
area this summer, reviewing the
work of the Institution and at
tending the annual trustees'
meeting.
On Hoover's recommendation,
the former name, Hoover Insti
