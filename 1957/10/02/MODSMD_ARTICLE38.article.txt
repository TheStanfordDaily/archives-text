# SIMIAN FLAIR
## Assassin, Ambassador Clash in 'Green Man' 
### Stew Toy 
An English barrister once said of his countrymen, "We may be
dull in some respects, but we have better murders than anybody."
This bizarre British tradition is carried on in hilarious fashion in
Alastair Sim's latest farce, "The Green Man," now showing at the
Guild Theater.
Sim plays a political assassin who starts small, with a loaded foun-

tain pen in his school headmas
ter's pocket, and rises to the
heights of grandiose diplomatic
bombings, artistically executed
with classic Simian flair.
The current victim is a pom
pous special ambassador to the
Middle East, doomed by the In
terests and Sim's diabolical mind
to be blown up by a special radio
re-broadcasting the ambassadors'
own speech.
Sim sets the stage with all the
care of a French chef preparing
a closely-guarded ancestral reci
pe, only to have his plans endan
gered by a young vaeuum-clean
er salesman—symbol of the mod
ern age crushing a time-honored
profession.
There are some unnerving mo
ments for Sim and his bespectac
led cohort and a mad chase
through merry England to the
"Green Man," a seaside hotel
where a crowd of intriguers con
verge, bringing various sub-plots
along with them.
One of these is the intended
victim, whose girl friend of the
evening is a fascinating study of
an almost • fallen woman turned
moral. The all-girl musical group

provides an interesting sidelight
on English hotel entertainment.
As the explosion hour ap
proaches, so does the vacuum
cleaner salesman, who produces
a gay but discouragingly Anglo-
Saxon denouement, and Sim ends
up as the greenest man of all.
