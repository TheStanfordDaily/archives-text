# Hoffa Leads Race; Plea Turned Down by Warren
## 
### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (/P) â€”James R. Hoffa's foes for control of the
giant Teamsters Union claimed yesterday they had stopped him cold,
but Hoffa forces insisted their man is a sure winner.
It appeared Hoffa's three opponents were gaining some ground
but that the 44-year-old Hoffa, the Midwest teamsters' boss linked to
labor scandals, still was well |

ahead in his race to become
teamsters' president.
Convention sessions of Ihe
scandal-rocked union meanwhile
idled along on routine business
awaiting the outcome of delegate
challenges voiced in proceedings
before the convention credential
committee.
That committee was reviewing
the qualifications of delegates
from some 68 locals who Chair
man McClellan (D-Ark.) of the
Senate Rackets Investigating
Committee has charged were il
legally selected.
Chief Justice Warren turned
down the plea of a rank and file
teamsters' group to ban conven
tion elections on the ground the
great bulk of delegates were
hand picked to rig the balloting
for Hoffa.
The convention has tentatively
seated about 1500 of the nearly
1950 delegates. Some of those al
ready seated are among those
questioned by McClellan.
Retiring union President Dave
Beck, himself charged like Hoffa
with misusing union funds and
powers, was presiding at conven
tion sessions.
