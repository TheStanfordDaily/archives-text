# Sequoia Gains Spot in SU Life

Why should Sequoia succeed
where oth e r Stanford literary
magazines have failed?
Eleanor Ogden, present editor,
believes one of the reasons is in
the aims of the magazine itself.
Instead of devoting itself to news
paper-like editorials or exclusively
to short stories and poems, Se
quoia is a review, a literary jour
nal which tries to include a va
riety of literary and art material.
Since Sequoia's main source of
material has always been manu
scripts submitted by students not
connected with the magazine, the
publication's main problem is con
vincing people to submit material,
since those who write would ra
ther submit their work to national
magazines which pay for material
printed.
Realizing this. Miss Ogden
points out that Sequoia, in tin ef
fort to help its authors who seek
further publication, is now inves
tigating the possibilities of work
ing agreements with national pub
lications such as the Harvard Ad
vocate has made with the Atlantic
Monthly whereby the Atlantic has
first choice on material printed
in the Advocate.

Although there are still those
on the Stanford campus who
think of a lumber company or a
defunct dormitory when Sequoia
is mentioned, recognition of Stan
ford's literary magazine is becom
ing more prevalent and more fa
vorable all the time.
When Linda Lovelace, first edi
tor of Sequoia, said in her editor's
report that "literary magazines
have not had an especially happy
history at Stanford," she was un
derstating more than a little.
Something like 13 magazines pre
ceding Sequoia had been started
on campus but failed.
But after less than two years
and five issues of Sequoia, it
seems obvious that this magazine
will not inherit the fate of its
predecessors and that it. is here
to stay. Its circulation has im
proved with every issue, and the
number of subscribers as well as
the size of the staff have broken
all records.
Sequoia was begun in 1955
when, with a small subsidy from
the University, a name chosen
from some 50 suggestions, an edi
tor in Linda Lovelace and a fac
ulty adviser in Wilfred Stone, the
magazine was launched.

quoia is a review, a literary jour
nal which tries to include a va
riety of literary and art material.
Since Sequoia's main source of
material has always been manu
scripts submitted by students not
connected with the magazine, the
publication's main problem is con
vincing people to submit material,
since those who write would ra
ther submit their work to national
magazines which pay for material
printed.
Realizing this. Miss Ogden
points out that Sequoia, in tin ef
fort to help its authors who seek
further publication, is now inves
tigating the possibilities of work
ing agreements with national pub
lications such as the Harvard Ad
vocate has made with the Atlantic
Monthly whereby the Atlantic has
first choice on material printed
in the Advocate.

Although there are still those
on the Stanford campus who
think of a lumber company or a
defunct dormitory when Sequoia
is mentioned, recognition of Stan
ford's literary magazine is becom
ing more prevalent and more fa
vorable all the time.
When Linda Lovelace, first edi
tor of Sequoia, said in her editor's
report that "literary magazines
have not had an especially happy
history at Stanford," she was un
derstating more than a little.
Something like 13 magazines pre
ceding Sequoia had been started
on campus but failed.
But after less than two years
and five issues of Sequoia, it
seems obvious that this magazine
will not inherit the fate of its
predecessors and that it. is here
to stay. Its circulation has im
proved with every issue, and the
number of subscribers as well as
the size of the staff have broken
all records.
Sequoia was begun in 1955
when, with a small subsidy from
the University, a name chosen
from some 50 suggestions, an edi
tor in Linda Lovelace and a fac
ulty adviser in Wilfred Stone, the
magazine was launched.

Why should Sequoia succeed
where oth e r Stanford literary
magazines have failed?
Eleanor Ogden, present editor,
believes one of the reasons is in
the aims of the magazine itself.
Instead of devoting itself to news
paper-like editorials or exclusively
to short stories and poems, Se
quoia is a review, a literary jour

riety of literary and art material.
