# Bookstore Urges Students to Save Rebate Receipts
## 
### 
"Students are still throwing
away their Bookstore rebate
slips," said Mrs. H. T. Bauchou,
manager of the Bookstore, yester
day. That means they are throw
ing away money, since each of
those slips entitles the buyer to
15 to 20 per cent of his purchase
price in return when rebates are
handed out in the spring.
The Bookstore operates on a
non-profit basis. "It is here solely
for the convenience of Stanford
people," said Mrs. Bauchou.
At the end of the year the costs
of merchandise and operating ex
penses are totaled and the remain
ing profits are returned to the
purchasers in the form of rebates,
a certain percentage of the sales.
Last year the rebate was 20 per
cent.
That means that on most items
students are saving one-fifth off
normal prices. Throwing away re
bate slips means the loss of these
savings, because the slips must
be turned in for payment.
