# Faubus, Ike Report Deadlock Over Integration Compromise
## ‘I've Given Until It Hurts,' Governor Tells Reporters Negro Students Mistreated in Little Rock; Federalized National Guard Continues Patrol 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (/P)- Gov. Orval Faubus stood fast yesterday
on terms of a school integration compromise already firmly rejected
by President Eisenhower. The governor left the next move up to
the White House.
"I've given until it hurts," Faubus maintained.

Although neither the governor
nor Eisenhower budged an inch,
Sherman Adams, the President's
top assistant, said in Washington:
"In our opinion, a basis will be
found lor an early withdrawal of
federal forces from Liltle Rock."
Federalized National Guard
troops patrolled Central High
School, where tension rose again
yesterday over the classroom
presence of the first nine Negroes
ever admitted to a public white
school in Little Rock.
Two white students spoke of a
plan to make school life so miser
able for the six Negro girls and
three boys that they won't want
to continue in Central.
Students Shoved, Kicked
Two of the Negro boys were
shoved about and kicked by while
male students in the school corri
dors during the day. However,
the two, with their seven Negro
classmates, emerged at the end of
the day with no visible marks
from the encounter.
The nine laughed and talked as
usual when they left school. As
they were driven away in a mili
tary station wagon, a clap of thun
der heralded the advent of a short,
heavy autumn downpour.
A court effort to rid Little Rock
of federal troops was launched
during the day by Mrs. Margaret
Jackson, vice president of the pro
segregationist League of Central
High School Mothers. She has two
teen-aged daughters in the school.
Injunction Sought
In federal district court here
Mrs. Jackson sought an injunc
tion against the presence of the
troops at the high school. She
said they were here unconstitu
tionally since neither Gov. Faubus
nor the state legislature asked
Eisenhower to send them in.
She claimed the troops "did . . .
intimidate, mutilate, bayonet and
bludgeon private citizens."
During the day also Gov. Theo
dore McKeldin of Maryland ac
cused Faubus of double-crossing
himself and three other Southern
governors who worked out yester
day's compromise that fell
through. It was intended to end
federal troop occupancy in Little
Rock.
Aide Confers
Frank Bane, an aide to the
Southern governors, flew in from
Washington during the afternoon
and conferred with Faubus. Nei
ther man would reveal the nature
of the discussion.
Faubus denied any double-cross
of the governors in a press con
ference in which he also said
heatedly:
"I've given until it hurts.... Ail
that double-talk in Washington
means is this—they want me to
take troops and put bayonets in
the backs of students in my state,
and bludgeon and bayonet my
people. 1 never felt the necessity
for this action."
