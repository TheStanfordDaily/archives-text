# MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
## Well, You Can't Tell

There's no use got ling alarmed right now, but
you never know where something like this might
lead especially the way things are going in the
world these days. We therefore feel compelled to
issue a warning 1o all right-thinking Americans
before it's too late.
We quote from an article in Monday's Daily:
"A professor from Yale |who for obvious rea
sons refuses to give his namej says that alco
holism will be averted if good drinking habits
are established early, say in adolescence. . . .
Social deviations (such as alcoholism) will not
be extreme ... if a drinking custom is simple
and uniform, smoothly integrated with family,
religion and government . .
Now, this kind of thinking seems to us to point
up definite anti-American tendencies on ihe part
of ihe anonymous Yale professor. "Alcoholism
will be averted," and we will thus be deprived of
some of the richest vestiges of our great Ameri
can heritage.
One immediately asks oneself, "Where would
this country be without alcoholism?" If we
should ask a European to list the United States'
greatest contributions to world culture. Ameri
can jazz would certainly ratik high on the listâ€”
the jazz which reached its full flower in the al
coholic days of the 'Twenties, when flappers

didn't mind lushing it up for indulging in social
deviations, as our professor friend might prefer)
in the interests of Americanism.
Which American city is the most beautiful, the
most cosmopolitan and the most expressive of
our culture? San Francisco, of course the city
with more alcoholics per capita than any other.
And let us not neglect our 1 country's leaders,
whose drinking habits are so vital to ;,|| of us.
What would happen if our diplomats adopted
Ibese "simple, smoothly integrated thinking hab
its" ihe professor is so concerned about? Amer
ica would become Ihe laughing stoci- o) the
international cocktail set. Think of the loss of
prestige!
Business conferences ruled by alcoholic mod
eration would result in timidity and bearishness,
which could cause depression, unemployment
and the complete collapse of America as an in
dustrial power.
Perhaps Ihe Yale professor fails lo grasp the
full implications of his statement. Or perhaps
in his wish for "integration" (a fancy word for
"conformity") he hopes lo stifle individualism,
with God knows what foul end in mind. But
whatever his motivation, we can only hope
Americans everywhere see through his scheme
as we have and guard our precious heritage with
everlasting vigilance.
