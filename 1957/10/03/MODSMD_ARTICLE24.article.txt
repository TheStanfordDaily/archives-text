# ARMY PRIVATE LIFE
## ‘No Time for Sergeants' Runs At Geary Theater in the City 
### John Nickerson 
Nearly all non-profit-making organizations from the United Na
tion:: to the Stanford Health Service are in for some degree of spoof
ing at one time or another. But no single organization has taken
;uite so much drubbing as the expansive, globe-dotted United States
Army-at-Peace.
"No Time for Sergeants," currently at the Geary Theater in San

I Francisco, is the most recent
comedy written in this disre
spectful, thoroughly amusing
| tradition.
The fun begins when Will
| Stockdale leaves his home in a
'sort of mad-Capp Southern Dog
patch at rifle point after being
accused of draft dodging. On the
way to camp lie picks up quizzi
cal (iim-witted Ben Rutledge, and
together the two of them face the
! hard bitten world of Army life.
First there is Irvin, the ROTC
j man. lie finds a letter of Ben's
and begins to read it to the other
inductees. So Will bits him. That's
.".I!; he just hits him.
I/.it rim* Orderly
Then there's Sergeanl King,
who aspects Will of being a trou
ble maker and assigns him 1o the
]j(.:i ol "permanent latrine order
ly." Bui in the end Will takes
care of him too by accidentally
helping him into a disorderly-con
duct charge.
Finally there's General Bush,
who has demoted Sergeant King
and his men to gunnery school
for their conduct. But Bush, too,
gets what is coming to him when
I a plane that: Stockdale is flying is
i spotted over the thermonuclear
testing center at Yucca Flats at a
! time when one of the tests is
1 about to go off.
Impending Disaster
Bush and company warn Stock
dale of his impending disaster—
but not before all hydro g en
breaks loose. It is the final out
come of this situation which pro
! duces the play's funniest scene.
The novel, itself a best-seller,
pulled no punches with its refer
ences to Army life, and neither
does Ihe play. The production
takes its audiences into locker
rooms, la 1 lines, airplanes and air
bases without losing any of the
book's continuity.
