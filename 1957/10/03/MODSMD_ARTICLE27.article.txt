# Drive Commission Heads Campaigns
## 
### 
Leadership in all campus char
ity campaigns, other than the
spring Con Home drive, is taken
by the Stanford Drives Commis
sion. Members have opportunity
to learn a lot about the nature of
the institutions for fund raising,
the various techniques used in
raising funds, and leading suc
cessful campaigns.
During the year the commission
sponsors two campus drives, aids
various worthwhile organizations
in on-campus solicitations, and
distributes small sums from a
floating fund to responsible and
vital organizations. World Univer
sity Service and Guide Dogs for
the Blind, Inc., are two organiza
tions which have received benefits
from these drives.
New members of the commis
sion are not selected until spring
of the year, but all interested per
sons have been invited to drop in
on the meetings, which are sched
uled in The Daily.
