# Stengel to Gamble Shantz Against Braves' Burdette
## Lefty Ford Holds Milwaukee to 5 Hits As New York Wins First Game. 3-1 
### 
NEV/ YORK (/P) —New York Manager Casey Stengel named an
other left-hander, Bobby Shantz, to pitch the second game of the
World Series at the Stadium today against right-hander Lew Bur
dette, choice of Milwaukee Manager Fred Haney.
Whitey Ford, chunkey New York Yankee left-hander, whipped

Milwaukee's Warren Spahn in
yesterday's opener, 3-1.
S h o w i n g complete recovery
from the arm miseries that had
bothered him during most of the
regular season, Ford held ihc Na
lional League champions to five
hits.
When the embattled Braves,
who went into their first Series
as 8-5 underdogs, threatened in
Ihe sixth, Ford calmly blew down
three of their toughest right-hand
ed hitlers- Hank Aaron, Joe Ad
cock and Andy Pafko. The stylish
little man struck out Aaron and
Pafko and retired Adcock on an
easy grounder after walking the
first two batters.
Important Win for Yanks
Beating Spahn. Milwaukee's 21-
game winning ace, was an impor
tant step for the Yankees. Most
observers figured 36-year-old War
ren had to win two games to end
the Bombers' reign.
Lew Burdette said yesterday ho
is going to beat the Yankees to
day. He said it simply, quietly,
matter-of-factly. His voice carried
no trace of a boast. He wasn't
trying to buoy his spirits. He
wasn't talking for effect.
"I'm going to win tomorrow,"
the Milwaukee righthander said.
And you could tell he meant every
word of it. "I'm going to get even
for Hookie here. We've got to
keep the room, you know."
Unless you were familiar with
Burdette and his sometimes color
ful, sometimes quaint manner of
speech, his words except for his
reference to winning—had little
or no meaning. But 1here was
plenty of meaning behind the
words of this man with the .sol
emn face except for eyes that
always appear to be laughing at
you.
Bimlcttc Colorful
"Hookie," of course, is Warren
Spahn, Burdette's pitching part
ner. roommate, pal and constant
companion. It is anybody's guess
whether the nickname is derived
from his big curve or his not-so
small nose.
The Yankees, of course, not
only had the goods on the Braves,
but also had the guys to make it
p.'iy off. They are now favored
at !2 to 5. They had been 8-5
choices to win the series, even
with slugging Bill Skowron of
doubtful value the rest of 1he
way because of his re-injured
back.
The odds on today's second
game are 7-5, Yankees, just as
they were for the opener.
New York 000 012 OOx—3 9 1
Milwaukee 000 000 100—I T> 0
