HOUSTON, Tex., Oct. 2
Stanford's Indians can expect
to find the air filled with foot
balls as well as vice versa when
they invade the beautiful 70,000-
seat Rice Stadium Saturday
night for a colorful interseetion
al meeting with the Mice Insti
tute Owls.
Like most teams from the"
wide open Southwest, the Owls,
coached by the veteran .less
Neely, like to throw the ball a
lot and this season they're es
pecially proud of I heir aerial at
tack.
(£tiartt-rhucks
In quarterbacks Frank Ryan,
King Hill and Larry Dueil, Rice
has three outstanding passers.
Ryan and 1 iill. both seniors,
generally like to drop back and
get set for their pitches while

Duoit, a clever ball • handling
sophomore, goes more for t lie
running pavs.
Lasl season Ryan, who ran
throw long or short with equal
accuracy, completed 60 of 109
for 70-1 yards and four touch
downs. liill connected on 47 of
B."> for Go 9 yards and three
touchdown:;.
However, passer;; are only as
good as their receivers, and in
this department Rice is well
blessed. The fellow Stanford is
going to have to keep an eagle
eye on is No. .SI, left end Buddy
Dial. Me is the favorile target
for the Owl passers. Last year
when lie was voted the No. 1
sophomore lineman in the
Southwest Conference, Dial
eaughl l''l passes for 3.17 yards
and five touchdown:;.
Dial Is '"Small"
Buddy isn't a !»ig kid. 110
stands only C 1 and weigh.-; just
180 pounds. And he isn't espe
cially fast. But he has an un
canny knack of getting into the
open and he has. a pair of good
hands.
Gone Miller, tho other end,
isn't rated as good a receiver as
Dial, but his (')•'! makes-him a
good target. The Owls throw a
lot at their halfbacks, too. This

can present a situation of Ryan
passing to either Hill or Dueit.
who sometimes go into the
game at halfback.
Rice's running game docs not
present as much of a threat as
its passing attack. The Owls
lack a real "all-the-way" run
ning threat. Most of the ball
carrying is handled by fullback
Ray Chilton, who goes only IK4
pounds, and halfbacks Bobby
Williams and Ken Williams.
In letterme-n Dan Shu ford and
sophomores Gordon Speer and
Bill Bucek, the Owls have three
reserve left halfbacks who are
track men and can run like the
wind if nothing else. If Speer,
especially, gets out in the open,
the Indians may have trouble
catching him.
(Editor's Note: The follow-
If Chuck Taylor's crew can
stop the Owls' conventional T
attack, they have a good chance
of lugging a victory back to Ihe
Coast with them. For their de
fense is something the Owls,
who have back 20 lettermen,
aren't bragging about . . . yet.
Last year Rice allowed each
rival an average of 287 yards,
which is the principal reason
the Owls wound up with a won
four, six lost record.

However, before Indian hopes
soar too high, ii should be re
membered that most of the Owl
defenders were inexperienced
sophomores last year and now
they're back with a year of ex
perience under their belts.
In defeating Louisiana State
Univers'ty 20-14 in their open
ing game of the season, the
Owls rolled up li.~) yards 251
rushing and 161 passing to 22.1
yards for the Tigers from the
Southeastern Conference.
Outstanding in a line that av
erages just 196 pounds are lefi
tackle Larry Whitmire, 210
pounds, and left guard Matt
Gorges, 196 pounds. They're

two-year lettermen and! prob-'
ably as capable linemen as
Stanford will run up against
this year.
Dial at left end and Claude
White at right tackle are the
only two other lettermen in the
line. Center Jerry Graves is a 1
210-pound sophomore. The oth- j
or spots are filled by suuadmen |
from last year.
The Owls' back field is com
paratively light, too, averaging
ISB pounds.
Off Stallf or d ' s showing
against Northwestern in last
week's TV game, it appears the
Indians and Owls will shape up
about even for this first grid
iron meeting.
