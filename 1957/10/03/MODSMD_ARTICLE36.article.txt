A Spaulding football became the
newest addition to tho Stanford
football ramp this week as coach
Chuck Taylor's Indians looked
ahead to Saturday night's tussle
with I lie Rice Institute Owls in
Houston, Tex.
Because NCAA rules stipulate
that a game ball will be that of
the home leam's choosing, the
Cards this week worked out with
the type of ball they will use in
Houston.
Beside this fact, however, not
much new arose from behind the
green fence this week. Yesterday
Stanford again worked on offen
sive and defensive reviews, with
an emphasis on defending against
Rice plays.
Stanford's Indians, dropped to
17th place in the Associated Press
football poll, and even lower in
others, will not go into this week
end's game against the Owls as
favorites. Yet Rice is unrated in
the major surveys.
The AP gives Rice a 20-13 edge

for the Saturday night tilt in the
new Rice Stadium, and this is the
widest margin given the Texans.
Other sources rate the Owls just
a simple touchdown ahead.
Locally, the hometowners have
a different set of odds, and these
have the game an even go at the
worst. Behind the usual cautious
optimism of coach Taylor, the
Cards think of Rice as a tough
foe but not an impassable one.
