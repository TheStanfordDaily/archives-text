# Commission Discusses Honor Code, Fundamental Standard
## 
### 
The Fundamental Standard arises directly from the students of
Stanford University. It is essentially a formal expression of the prin
ciple of individual responsibility, and governs each individual's ac
tions while a Stanford student. It relies upon the student's own
mature judgment and sense of responsibility to guide him, rather

than many specific rules.
The Honor Code, requested by
and granted to the students in
1921, places the responsibility for
honesty in all academic work di
rectly with the students them
selves.
The Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission inter
prets the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code. It does not
try any cases; rather, it gives in
terpretations on request to the
Men's and Women's Councils, who
actually try the cases.
The commission's purpose is to
orient and educate each student
as to his individual responsibili
ties under Stanford's system of
integrity.
The 15 regular members of the
commission meet once a week to
discuss and debate the meaning
of the Fundamental Standard as
it applies to campus life.
These meetings are open to
Stanford students; fresh view
points and interested visitors are
very welcome.
