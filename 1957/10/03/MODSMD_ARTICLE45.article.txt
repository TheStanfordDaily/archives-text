WHAT EVERY YOUNG COED
SHOULD WEAR
G ather round, girls. Flip open a pack of Marlboros,
light up, enjoy that fine flavor, that good filter, relax and
listen while Old Dad tells you about the latest campus
fashions.
The key word this year is casual. Be casual. Be slap
dash. Be rakish. Improvise. Invent your own ensembles
— like ski pants with a peek-a-boo blouse, like pajama
bottoms with an ermine stole, like a hockey sweater with
a dirndl.
(Dirndl, incidentally, is one of the truly fascinating
words in the English language. The word originated on
June 27, 18-16, when Dusty Sigafoos, the famous scout
and Indian fighter, went into the Golden Nugget Saloon
in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to see Lily Langtry. Miss Langtry
did her dance in pink tights. Dusty had never seen any
thing like that in his life and he was much impressed,
lie thought about her all the way home. When he got

home his wife Feldspar was waiting to show him a new
skirt she had made for herself. "I low do you like my new
skirt, Dusty?" asked Feldspar. He looked at the large,
voluminous garment, then thought of the pink tights on
Lily Langtry. "Your skirt is dam dull," said Dusty.
"Darn dull" was later shortened to dirndl, which is how
dirndls got their name.)
But I digress. We were smoking a Marlboro and
talking about the latest campus styles. Casual, we agree,
is the key word. But casual need not, mean drab. Liven
up your outfits with a touch of glamor. Even the lowly
dungaree and man-shirt combination can be made ex
citing if you'll adorn it with a simple necklace of 120
matched diamonds. With Bermuda shorts, wear knee
cymbals. Be guided by the famous poet, Cosmo Sigafoos
(whose cousin Dusty invented the dirndl), who wrote*
Sparkle, my beauty,
Shimmer and shine,
The night is young,
The air's like wine,
Cling to a leaf,
Hang on. a vine,
Crawl on your belly,
It's lime to dine.
(Mr. Sigafoos, it should be explained, was writing
about a glowworm. Insects, as everyone knows, are
among Mr. Sigafoos' favorite subjects for poetry. Who
can over forget his immortal Ode To a Boll Weevil? Or
his Tumbling Along with the Tumbling Tumblebug? Or
his Fly (iently, Sweet Aphidt Mr. Sigafoos has been in
active since the invention of DDT.)
But T digress. We were smoking a Marlboro and dis
cussing fashion. Let, us turn now to headwear. The motif
in hats this year will be familiar American scenes. There
will be models to fit every head—for example, the "Em
pire State Building" for tall, thin heads; the "Jefferson
Memorial" for squatty heads; "Niagara talis- for dry
scalps. Feature of the collection is the "Statue of
Liberty," complete with a torch that actually burns.
This is very handy for lighting your Marlboros, which
is terribly important because no matter how good
Marlboros are, they're nowhere unless you light them.

Sparkle, my beauty,

Crawl on your belly,
It's lime to dine.

Liberty," complete with a torch that actually burns.
This is very handy for lighting your Marlboros, which

Marlboros are, they're nowhere unless you light them.

WHAT EVERY YOUNG COED
SHOULD WEAR
G ather round, girls. Flip open a pack of Marlboros,
light up, enjoy that fine flavor, that good filter, relax and
listen while Old Dad tells you about the latest campus
fashions.
The key word this year is casual. Be casual. Be slap
dash. Be rakish. Improvise. Invent your own ensembles
— like ski pants with a peek-a-boo blouse, like pajama
bottoms with an ermine stole, like a hockey sweater with
a dirndl.
(Dirndl, incidentally, is one of the truly fascinating
words in the English language. The word originated on
June 27, 18-16, when Dusty Sigafoos, the famous scout
and Indian fighter, went into the Golden Nugget Saloon
in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to see Lily Langtry. Miss Langtry
did her dance in pink tights. Dusty had never seen any
thing like that in his life and he was much impressed,
lie thought about her all the way home. When he got

home his wife Feldspar was waiting to show him a new
skirt she had made for herself. "I low do you like my new
skirt, Dusty?" asked Feldspar. He looked at the large,
voluminous garment, then thought of the pink tights on
Lily Langtry. "Your skirt is dam dull," said Dusty.
"Darn dull" was later shortened to dirndl, which is how
dirndls got their name.)
But I digress. We were smoking a Marlboro and
talking about the latest campus styles. Casual, we agree,
is the key word. But casual need not, mean drab. Liven
up your outfits with a touch of glamor. Even the lowly
dungaree and man-shirt combination can be made ex
