# $85,000 PROJECT
## Exchange Completion Date Nears 
### 
Modernization of Stanford's
overworked telephone system is
in progress with the construction
of an $85,000 telephone exchange
building on Panama Street across
from the Cellar.
The new building, a landscape
type structure, will house the
bulk of the University's new tele
phone equipment designed even
tually to permit direct dialing be
tween all telephones on campus.
Relieve Shortage.
Begun last spring, the building
itself is scheduled for completion
in December, and it is hoped that
the new telephone system will he
installed and in operation by next
spring.
The immediate purpose of the
new equipment is to relieve Ihe
shortage of telephones in the
University offices. At present no
now installations are possible
since every trunk line is being
used to the maximum capacity
set by the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company.
Room Phones
However, there is good news
for the phone-frustrated student.
Negotiations are in progress with
the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company on a plan which
would provide for the installation
of a telephone in every dormitory
room.
If the plan goes through, PBX's
serving local areas such as Wil
bur, Encina, Stern, Branner,
Crothers Memorial, Crothers
and Toyon will be eliminated. It
will then be possible to dial indi
vidual rooms, and with the use
of the telephone company's pro
posed "toll-diverter" limited out
side dialing would be permitted.
Business Office's Seraphim
Post emphasized, however, that
the room phone pian is still "on
the drawing table."
