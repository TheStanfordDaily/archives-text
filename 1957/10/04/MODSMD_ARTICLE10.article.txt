SACRAMENTO (/P)â€”What is a
"hydra-headed bid"?
Governor Knight yesterday de
scribed Sen. William Knowland's
decision to run for governor next
year as "a hydra-headed bid for
the Presidency . .
Webster's Collegiate dictionary
says hydra is .. an evil having
many sources, not to be overcome
by a single effort."
Knight's office said he used the
term to mean a "two-headed bid
. . . one for governor and one for
the Presidency."
