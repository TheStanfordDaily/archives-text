## Reduced Defense Spending Requires U.S. Aid Against Russia in Middle East, Consul Says 
### Helen Guerrant 
Imports and exports are vital to the welfare of Great Britain,
Michael Scott Weir, British consul in Northern California and Ne
vada, said yesterday in the first of a series of biweekly cultural talks
sponsored by the Institute of International Relations.
Speaking at Bowman Alumni House, Weir said that Great Britain's

economic difficulties stem from
the fact that she has very few
raw materials and not even half
enough lood to support her popu
lation.
The effects of World War II on
l the stability of the economic sys
tem have been shattering, the con
sul said. To compensate for this,
it is essential for Britain to reduce
defense spending and to acquire
new markets as well as to main
tain her old ones.
To illustrate his point in telling
how necessary foreign markets
are. Weir said that even with Brit
ish imports eight times more than
those of the United States, and
exports five times the size of ours,
their national income is still but
10 per cent of that in this coun
try.
Banking and investing are ox
tensive in Britain, Weir said, and
much government regulation in
these areas is necessary in order
to maintain a stable economy, to
prevent inflation and to create
confidence in the currency.
Weir stressed the fact that the
United States and Britain must
work together both politically and
economically as a block to any
future Russian intervention in
any area of the world. This, of
course, is especially true in tho
Middle East, he said, for it can no
longer be regarded by the United
i States as a problem of Britain
and France exclusively.
Weir concluded by saying that
the Western nations must unite,
rather than suspect and criticizc
each other, in order to maintain
a stand against further Russian
exploits.
