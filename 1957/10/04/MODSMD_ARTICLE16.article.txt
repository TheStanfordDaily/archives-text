# Beck's Early Out Paves Hoffa's Way As Teamster Head
## 
### 
MIAMI BEACH. Fla. (/P) â€” Dave
Bock agreed last night to bow out
earlier than scheduled as Team
sters president, so his expected
successor, James R. Hoffa, can
take over the union helm right
away.
Beck is retiring from office, but
his term extends to Dec. 1. He
proposed to the union convention
that it either terminate the term
by Oct. 15 or put him on leave of
absence after that date until
Dec. 1.
Hoffa, obviously in full charge
of the convention, .jumped up with
a motion to put Beck on leave
effective Oct. 15. The convention
approved the motion in a unani
mous standing vote.
Beck told the delegates he was
offering to step out sooner than
scheduled because he felt his suc
cessor should take over at the
earliest opportunity.
It was possible Bock's move
may have been inspired, however,
by friends of Hoffa who want the
latter in fuil command of the
giant union for a coming battle
with the AFL-CIO. The federa
tion has threatened to oust the
Teamsters if they retain lloffa in
the union.
Oct. 15 happens to bo (lie date
Hoffa is due to go to trial in New
York city on wire-tap charges and
bo arraigned on perjury charges.
Beck made his proposal to the
convention after a speech in
which he said, "Some people, be
cause I have been financially suc
cessful, feel I am not honest." He
is under indictment charging eva
sion of more than $250,000 in fed
eral income taxes.
The outgoing union president
defended his many tangled finan
cial dealings with union firms and
his repeated invoking of the fifth
amendment before the U.S. Sen
ate rackets investigating commit
tee in refusing to toll about them.
