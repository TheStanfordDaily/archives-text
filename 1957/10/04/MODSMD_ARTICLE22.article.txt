'•Unless there are close ties be
tween Japan and the United
States, Japan cannot expect to
have prosperity."
This statement shows how im
portant his stay in the United
States is to this year's Keio schol
ar Tadashi Sakurai.
Sakurai, who prefers to be call
ed Tad, is a senior majoring in
economics and is living at Stern
Mall. He js the second student
from Keio University, in Japan, to
attend Stanford under ASSU
ponsorship and is one of 10 for
eign scholars living on campus
this year under the ASSU pro
gram.
Before coming to the United
States, Sakurai was very active in
international student organiza
tions and traveled in the lOast,
attending many forums and con
ferences. He was a member of
tlit International Relations Com
mittee at Keio, the body which
promotes the student exchange
with Stanford, and was president
(if the International Students As
ociation of Japan.
This year he attended the ISA
convention, which was held in his
home town, Tokyo, and whicli was
also attended by Byron Marshall,
Stanford's present exchange stu
dent to Keio University.
Delegate to Meetings
In 1955 Sakurai was a delegate
to the Asian Students Forum in
Manila, and before returning to
Japan he attended the Japanese-
Taiwan Students Conference held
iri Taiwan. One year later he was
also a member of the Keio dele
gation to the Hong Kong Students
Union.
"Before coming to the United
States," said Sakurai, "I thought
Ihat the students here did not
study very hard, but I discovered
1 hat they study harder than we do
in Japan. Americans know how
to study but also they know how
1o play. Japanese students do not
know how to enjoy themselves as
do American students."
According to Sakurai. many
Japanese students go to college
only to obtain a diploma, which is
necessary to find a good job. As
a result the universities in Japan
are overcrowded, but only a small
percentage of the students do
much studying.
He expressed surprise at the
long line of people outside the
Bookstore waiting to buy books.
"In Japan," he said, "we don't buy
lextbooks as you do here. It is
impossible to own all the books
Iha 1 are required in a course, so
we use mostly reference books."
The Daily Amazes
lie was also amazed to see a
daily newspaper at a university,
fot in Japan university newspa
pers are prin t e d weekly or
monthly.
In regard to dating al the Uni

versify of Keio, Sakurai says:
"Keio girls know the bad points
of Keif) boys. It is not good for a
boy to have his bad points known,
so Keio boys do not go out with
Keio girls.
"It is easy 1o imitate the West
ern way of thinking and living,"
he remarked. Aceording to him,
much of the traditional Japanese
clothing, such as the kimono, is
being replaced by the more prac
tical Western apparel.
"Most of the Japanese people
are friendly toward the United
States," he commented, "but they
feel that the United States should
give Japan more support in trade.
Japan cannot support herself
without trade with foreign coun
tries."
Don't Understand
He said lhat many people can
not understand why the United
States will nol allow Japanese
ships to carry goods from Amer
ica to Japan, but requires instead
that Japan pay for transportation
of these goods on American ships.
This increases greatly the cost of
the goods and limits the amount
of trade that Japan can have with
the United States.
In commenting on the Girard
case, Sakurai observed that no
hatred <») the United States was
created by this incident, but that
the Japanese people thought Gi
raid rightfully should be tried in
a Japanese court.
"There will not be any discrimi
nation against: Girard in our
courts," he said. "Other Ameri
can soldiers have been tried there,
and the decisions have been fair."
Sakurai enjoys several hobbies
and recreational activities. He
participates in soccer and ice skat
ing and likes to watch many other
sports.
( ainera Fan
He is an avid camera fan and
has been busy around the campus
taking pictures to send to his
friends at Keio University. "It is
important to send fresh impres
sions of Stanford," he said, and
he feels lhat these fresh impres
sions can best be conveyed by pic
tures.
Sakurai also paints pictures oc
casionally, but his interest in art
is usually that of an observer.
After completing this year at
Stanford, Sakurai intends to re
turn to Keio to continue his edu
cation there.
He hopes to become an econo
mist in a trading company after
graduating from Keio, but says
that: jobs are quite scarce in
Japan. He feels that the experi
ence of studying and living at
Stanford will help him considera
bly in obtaining work.
