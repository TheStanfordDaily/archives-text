### Steve Baffrey On to Houston 
OFF WE CIO Today the Big Rod Machine hups upon the big
bird and heads toward Houston to meet the Southwest Conference's
Riee Owls in what figures 1o he a sell-out thriller tomorrow night
deep in the heart of . . .
Riee promoters are promising that all 1 hose Indian fans who
journey to Houston will come away with many fond memories of
the "fabulous and beautiful new 70,()0.')-seat Riee Stadium." Accord
ing to the publicists, the structure is the newest of its kind in the
country, the epitome of comfort, and minus all the bad features of
older stadia. . . .
Just how beautiful and comfortable Indian fans will find it re
mains to be seen. No doubt they will find a great resemblance to ihe
un-soft seats found locally, and 1 here's ;i good reason. The seals for
ihe new 70,000-capacity wonder came from the same lumber yard
that supplies Card rooters with memories of every game. Oh, that
California Redwood!
And Joeals will find more of that home-type atmosphere if they
look hard enough, too. Somewhere they're bound to run into mention
of the Rice yearbook . . . the Campanile. Sound familiar? but The
Daily is thankful io Russell Brown of the Campanile staff who will
supply us with pictures of the Rice game.
Owl mentor Jess Newly, they say, will be looking forward to
meeting halfback A 1 Harrington when the Cards get to iown. Seems

Neely was coaching an all-star
game in the Islands a few years
back and Harrington was one of
hi.s backs.
"One of the finest youngsters
I ever had the pleasure to coach
in a schoolboy all-star lilt." Neely
relates. When asked of his mem
ories of the game, Harrington re
membered that Neely was "a real
fine Southern gentleman."
This one slipped through Rice's
publicity hands — Jim Byre r
played in that gams, too.
More about the Rice-Stanford
game . . . Neely has often been
called the Chuck Taylor of the
Southwest Conference, Seems
both coach at schools where the
production of football giants is
not the primary objective. They
are not presented with supposed
ly the great prospects that go to
some schools, but usually man
age to turn out fine teams which
play good games. A credit to
them both.

Stanford followers have probably noticed Ihe change in Coach
Chuck Taylor's former weekend predictions of "We will win." This
year the great trend is toward optimistic caution with the phrase
"We can win!" or "We have a chance to win!" But from the great
coach if sounds just as good, for fie si ill rightly feels thai any learn
lie coachi ■ lias a good chance of winnirn. r anv (fame.
