# Tales of Lindsy Nelson

### 
Last week I had Ihe pleasure of working with Lindsey Nelson
of NBC Sports on KZSIJ's "The Experts Predict." Couldn't help
feeling, after the meeting was over, thai there should be greater
contact between the public and people like him. I lis are some of the
most interesting sporting stories 1 have ever heard.
About a week ago national sports columnist Red Smith related
a typical story about Nelson when he was just a high school kid
in Columbia, Tennessee. JVelson was covering a pair of games for
the high school paper one day and could only make one of them.
When he went to the coach of one of the oilier game's teams he was
told:
"If you're writing a game you should be there; T'li tell you
nothing." But since that flay much has happened to both roach and
tchoolboy, and Red Sanders will never again feel so disposed to the
head of NB< - Sports. s
ONK FINAL NOTE: Notice anything different on the field
against Northwestern? If the object of your attention wore a red
skirt and jacket she was Camille de Campos, The Daily's newest
photographer, and a sports specialist. She's certainly one of Ihe tew
(if not the only) women photogs on the field in a long, long while.
ON TO HOUSTON.
