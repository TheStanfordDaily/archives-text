to spell Shea as Stanford's sec
ond-unit fullback. He, too, was
impressive last Saturday.
Owl mentor Jess Neely will fill
with veteran signal-caller King
Mill. lie and Ryan both pitched
to 55 per cent completions in '5(5,
and both are about equal in run
ning ability. Hill and Ryan are
seniors, and usually play equal
time, with one running at the
halfback slot while the other
runs the team.
Besides Shea, Stanford's start
ing eleven will have only one
change from last week. Dick
Stein will return to his position
at left end.
Going into the game, the In
dians look back upon their 46-7
whitewash of San Jose State's
Spartans and their encouraging
26-G win over the Wildcats. Both
these games proved to the Cards
that they can be effective on the
ground and in the air.
20-14 Win Over LSU
Rice has one victory behind it
going into tomorrow evening's
tussle, a 20-14 triumph over Lou
isiana State. And the Owls came
from two touchdowns behind to
take that one. They didn't get
going until the second half start
ed and then turned on the steam
to overtake the Staters.
Last week, though. LSU turned
the tables on highly-touted Ala-

bama, 28-0, thur
showing that th
Owl victory wa'
a worthy one. Ii
hot h g a mes
however, Asiatic
flu play e d ?
dominant role
so the worthi
ness of Rice';
triumph and the
subsequent LSU
blanking of Ala
bama cannot be

taken at face value.
A talented back field made its
T>7 debut against LSU, though,
and will no doubt figure strongly
into tomorrow's game The Owls'
two stellar fullbacks, Ray Chil
ton arid Dave Kelley, both put on
good shows, with Kelley leading
the Rice pack with a 7.1 average
for 11 carries.
Bailey a Standout
Junior halfback Pat Bailey was
also a standout, as was Rice's
third quarterback-fullback Larry
Dueitt.

George Lynn |
scouted the Owls 1
two weeks ago,;
and reports that i

the backs are hard runners,'
though not fast. Lynn feels thai
the Owls will pass more against
the Cards than they did against
their first foes.
And with end Buddy Dial set
to receive this might mean
trouble for the Cards.
Passing Worries Neely
But from Houston comes the
story that Neely and crew are j
worried about the passing attack
they expect from the Indians, j
Neely emphasized pass defense |
in his team's workout Wednes- i
day.
in the local game, Coach Tay-1
lor had his team going through j
light tactics again yesterday in j
order to further orient his team j
to the Rice style of play.
Taylor Practices PAT's
Early in the season Taylor had
halfbark Jackie Taylor working
on the extra-point project, with
halfback A 1 Harrington and tack
le Armand DeWeese doing the In
dians' punting.
Taylor's confidence in the In
dians was unshaken as he men
tioned the most important factor
of the hostile territory, humidity.
This, more than the fact that it
will be a night game, seemed to
worry the local mentor.
"We didn't schedule a night
practice because no two lighting
systems are the same. We'd be
liable 1o hurt more than help our- |
selves."
Texans are looking forward to j
seeing the first PCC team ever to ,
play in Houston, and the first j
PCC team ever to play in llous- ,
ion is looking forward to leaving :
a very bad memory.
