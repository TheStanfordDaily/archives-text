### 
Covington's Hitting, Fielding Highlight Victory;
No Game Todav as Teams Travel to Milwaukee

NEW YORK (/P) —Lew Burdette,
the pitcher the New York Yan
kees traded away in 1951, squared
the World Series for Milwaukee
yesterday by beating his old leam
mates, 4-2, in the second game at
Yankee Stadium.
Avenging the opening-day de
! feat of Warren Spahn, his room-
I mate, ihe fidgety 30-year-old right

hander held the Yanks to seven
hits. Time after time ho squirmed
out of difficulty to bring the
Braves home to Milwaukee for to
morrow's third game all even
with the favored New Yorkers.
Lew Had Help
The nervous pitcher—who tugs
at his cap, brushes his face, mas
sages the ball and blows on his
hand between throws—didn't do it
alone, of course. But he chipped
in with four fielding assists, one
a vital throw of a weak roller by
Harry Simpson that helped him
to escape his worst jam, in the
sixth inning.
Wes Covington, Ihe Braves' hit
ting star with a .500 Series av
erage, cracked the game-winning
single as early as ihe fourth in
ning. With the score tied at 22,
Joe Adcoek and Andy Pafko open
ed the inning with singles.
Manager Fred Haney sent up
Covington with instructions to
move ihem along with a sacrifice.
Covington Fouls Three
Wes fouled the first pitch, look
eft at; a ball and fouled off an
other. With two strikes, the bunt
sign went off. He fouled weakly
back of first and look another
ball.
With Ihe count 2-2, Covington
dunked a single into short left
that brought Adcoek home with
the tie-breaking run. When Enos
threw to third base try
ing to get Pafko, who was zoom
ing toward the bag, the ball got
away from rookie Tony Kubek
and rolled to the Braves' dugout
as Kubek went down in the dust.
Pafko Also Scores
Pafko scored and Covington
wound up on third on the first
Series error by the 20-year-old
Kubek, who was playing his sec
ond position in as many days.

Covington's Hitting, Fielding Highlight Victory;
No Game Todav as Teams Travel to Milwaukee

NEW YORK (/P) —Lew Burdette,
the pitcher the New York Yan
kees traded away in 1951, squared
the World Series for Milwaukee
yesterday by beating his old leam
mates, 4-2, in the second game at
Yankee Stadium.
Avenging the opening-day de
! feat of Warren Spahn, his room-
I mate, ihe fidgety 30-year-old right

hander held the Yanks to seven
hits. Time after time ho squirmed
out of difficulty to bring the
Braves home to Milwaukee for to
morrow's third game all even
with the favored New Yorkers.
Lew Had Help
The nervous pitcher—who tugs
at his cap, brushes his face, mas
sages the ball and blows on his
hand between throws—didn't do it
alone, of course. But he chipped
in with four fielding assists, one
a vital throw of a weak roller by
Harry Simpson that helped him
to escape his worst jam, in the
sixth inning.
Wes Covington, Ihe Braves' hit
ting star with a .500 Series av
erage, cracked the game-winning
single as early as ihe fourth in
ning. With the score tied at 22,
Joe Adcoek and Andy Pafko open
ed the inning with singles.
Manager Fred Haney sent up
Covington with instructions to
move ihem along with a sacrifice.
Covington Fouls Three
Wes fouled the first pitch, look
eft at; a ball and fouled off an
other. With two strikes, the bunt
sign went off. He fouled weakly
back of first and look another
ball.
With Ihe count 2-2, Covington
dunked a single into short left
that brought Adcoek home with
the tie-breaking run. When Enos
threw to third base try
ing to get Pafko, who was zoom
ing toward the bag, the ball got
away from rookie Tony Kubek
and rolled to the Braves' dugout
as Kubek went down in the dust.
