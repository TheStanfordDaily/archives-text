# Little Rock: 75 Students Ape Parents
## Demonstration Flops in Face Of Guardsmen 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (JP)—Fed
eralized National Guardsmen, ri
fles across their chests, yesterday
broke up a menacing throng of
75 white students who walked out
of integrated Central High School.
The demonstrators had hoped
to pull out with ihem most of thp
school's 2,000 white students in a
forceful protest against Negroes
in their classrooms. But ringlead
ers admitted the demonstration
was a flop.
"Come on, you chickens!" the
youngsters shouted at students
who stayed inside. "Dirty chick
en!"
For an ugly split second it ap
peared a new riot might be build
ing up on the street before the
school where blood was shed in
adult riots and demonstrations
last week.
A Negro was hung in effigy and
the straw-filled dummy set afire.
The demonstrators shrieked and
shouted in angry near-hysteria.
They milled about, seemingly in
search of leadership that would
point a course of action.
Sixty National Guardsmen
quickly formed solid ranks. With
rifles aslant across their chests,
they moved silently and inexora
bly on the demonstrators. For a
moment the students seemed in
clined to resist. Then they grudg
ingly gave way.
Within 30 minutes the street in
front of the school was deserted
and quiet. Barricades were re
stored in the area for the first
time since last week. The smol
dering dummy was removed by
soldiers.
The Negro students were not
visible inside the school from the
street. But presumably, like most
of the students, they knew the
demonstration was planned.
Guardsmen had no trouble safe
guarding the Negro children as
they left Central High at the end
of the tumultuous day. Most of
the white students had already
scattered when the Negroes
emerged, and there was no shout
ing or disturbances.
Meanwhile at Blytheville, Ark.,
Gov. Faubus was greeted with
rousing cheers yesterday as he
rode in the position of honor in
a parade opening the National
Cotton Picking Contest here.
The governor smiled and
waved at the crowd of about 4000
onlookers.
Faubus' car was near the head
of the parade.

Sixty National Guardsmen
quickly formed solid ranks. With
rifles aslant across their chests,
they moved silently and inexora
bly on the demonstrators. For a
moment the students seemed in
clined to resist. Then they grudg
ingly gave way.
Within 30 minutes the street in
front of the school was deserted
and quiet. Barricades were re
stored in the area for the first
time since last week. The smol
dering dummy was removed by
soldiers.
The Negro students were not
visible inside the school from the
street. But presumably, like most
of the students, they knew the
demonstration was planned.
Guardsmen had no trouble safe
guarding the Negro children as
they left Central High at the end
of the tumultuous day. Most of
the white students had already
scattered when the Negroes
emerged, and there was no shout
ing or disturbances.
Meanwhile at Blytheville, Ark.,
Gov. Faubus was greeted with
rousing cheers yesterday as he
rode in the position of honor in
a parade opening the National
Cotton Picking Contest here.
The governor smiled and
waved at the crowd of about 4000
onlookers.
Faubus' car was near the head
of the parade.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (JP)—Fed
eralized National Guardsmen, ri
fles across their chests, yesterday
broke up a menacing throng of
75 white students who walked out
of integrated Central High School.
The demonstrators had hoped
to pull out with ihem most of thp
school's 2,000 white students in a
forceful protest against Negroes
in their classrooms. But ringlead
ers admitted the demonstration
was a flop.
"Come on, you chickens!" the
youngsters shouted at students
who stayed inside. "Dirty chick
en!"
For an ugly split second it ap
peared a new riot might be build
ing up on the street before the
school where blood was shed in
adult riots and demonstrations
last week.
A Negro was hung in effigy and
the straw-filled dummy set afire.
The demonstrators shrieked and
shouted in angry near-hysteria.
They milled about, seemingly in
search of leadership that would
point a course of action.
