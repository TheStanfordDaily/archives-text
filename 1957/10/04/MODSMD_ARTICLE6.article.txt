## Stanford Seeks Third Victory Against Rice Tomorrow Night 
### Steve Baffrey 
"We can win; we have a good chance to beat Rico!" That's how
Stanford head coach Chuck Taylor feels this morning as his tribe
of 37 Indians gets set to leave for a bird-hunting trip in Rice Stadium
tomorrow night. Game time is 5:30 p.m. (PST).
And as with all trips of this sort, the Indians arc going to have

to get their catch out of the air j
if they expect to come home with J
good news. But more than that,
Stanford is going to have to trap
some of its catch on the ground, i
too.
Tomorrow night's battle be
tween these two well-balanced
clubs figures to be one of the
most exciting to come off this
weekend. Both squads will head
at one another with a sparkling
display of ground and aerial of
fensive tactics.

One major change has boon
made in the lineups of each club.
Stanford will not start first
stringer Lou Valli at fullback. In
fact it is doubtful whether he
will even see action in the game.
Rice's ace senior passer Frank
Ryan will be out of the lineup be
cause of complications in his al
ready-bruised knee.
But neither of these facts
seems to be a source of great
concern to the clubs' coaches.
Taylor will counter with Chuck
Shea as his starting halfback.
Shea was a standout while filling
in for Valli in the Northwestern
trouncing. Kick McMillen figures
