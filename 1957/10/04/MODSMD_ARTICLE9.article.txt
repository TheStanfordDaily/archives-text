will view his purported interest
in their welfare with serious res

"Though the incumbent may
think that he has a vested right
in the gubernatorial post and is
the only one qualified to hold it.
most Californians do not believe
in the doctrine of the indispensa
ble man."
Knight said, "Knowland's care
fully-worded statement is proper
ly assessed by all who hoard it as
a thinly disguised invitation to his
later 'draft' for the presidential
nomination in 1960."
