# Rice Defeats Cards, 34-7, Under Stars in Houston
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
RICE STADIUM, Houston, Texas, Oct. 5 The stars tonight
weren't big or bright here in the heart of Texas. At least not for
Coach Chuck Taylor's tribe of 37 Indians. Ami the only sound to be
heard in the otherwise still night air was the hooting of a few Owls
reflecting on their 34 7 trouncing of Stanford.
And it could well be that among those Owls were Frank Ryan and
King Hill. Flipping a total of 19 passes between them, these two
senior quarterbacks were able to connect on 12 for some 240 yards.
But there's more to their damaging tale than this. On the ground
Ryan and Hill again menaced the Indians by racking up a combined
143 three-footers.
High-Spirited Owls
Still, a team isn't beaten by just two men and so the Stanford loss
to Rice should as well be credited to a fast-moving, high-spirited Owl
squad that wanted more than anything else to open their 1957 home
season with a win.
Moving in the air and on the ground at just the times when the
Indians seemed the most vulnerable via each of these paths, the
Owls posted a high net of .">83 offensive yards against the Taylormen.
But it wasn't only Ryan, Hill and spirit that beat the Cards. It
was partly the loss of three top-flight members of the Stanford squad.
Ace quarterback Jackie Douglas hurt his back trying to haul down
Rice end Buddy Dial on the* Stanford 9 in the closing minutes of
the opening stanza.
Shea, Van (JaldtT Hurt
Fullback Chuck Shea injured his knee in I he opening seconds of
tlu' second quarter, and end Gary Van Galder soon followed Shea out
of the game after suffering a slight concussion resulting from some
hard line play.
Injuries, especially those in the backfield, left coach Taylor wilh
only one fullback, Rick McMillen, and two experience-needing quar
terbacks, Bob Nicolet and Sid Garber. Shea, though, before lie left
the game, netted 47 yards in nine carries.
After electing to put Rice on the offense to start the game, the
Indians soon found that Rice's Owls weren't going to be stopped
•until they grabbed a lead. The Texans' initial TD drive went (J8 yards
in eight plays with powering fullback Ray Chilton leading the attack
and finally scoring. Hill added the first of four etxras.
