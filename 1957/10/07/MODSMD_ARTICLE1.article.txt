# Rice Defeats Cards, 34-7, Under Stars in Houston
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
RICE STADIUM, Houston, Texas, Oct. 5 The stars tonight
weren't big or bright here in the heart of Texas. At least not for
Coach Chuck Taylor's tribe of 37 Indians. Ami the only sound to be
heard in the otherwise still night air was the hooting of a few Owls
reflecting on their 34 7 trouncing of Stanford.
And it could well be that among those Owls were Frank Ryan and
King Hill. Flipping a total of 19 passes between them, these two
senior quarterbacks were able to connect on 12 for some 240 yards.
But there's more to their damaging tale than this. On the ground
Ryan and Hill again menaced the Indians by racking up a combined
143 three-footers.
High-Spirited Owls
Still, a team isn't beaten by just two men and so the Stanford loss
to Rice should as well be credited to a fast-moving, high-spirited Owl
squad that wanted more than anything else to open their 1957 home
season with a win.
Moving in the air and on the ground at just the times when the
Indians seemed the most vulnerable via each of these paths, the
Owls posted a high net of .">83 offensive yards against the Taylormen.
But it wasn't only Ryan, Hill and spirit that beat the Cards. It
was partly the loss of three top-flight members of the Stanford squad.
Ace quarterback Jackie Douglas hurt his back trying to haul down
Rice end Buddy Dial on the* Stanford 9 in the closing minutes of
the opening stanza.
Shea, Van (JaldtT Hurt
Fullback Chuck Shea injured his knee in I he opening seconds of
tlu' second quarter, and end Gary Van Galder soon followed Shea out
of the game after suffering a slight concussion resulting from some
hard line play.
Injuries, especially those in the backfield, left coach Taylor wilh
only one fullback, Rick McMillen, and two experience-needing quar
terbacks, Bob Nicolet and Sid Garber. Shea, though, before lie left
the game, netted 47 yards in nine carries.
After electing to put Rice on the offense to start the game, the
Indians soon found that Rice's Owls weren't going to be stopped
•until they grabbed a lead. The Texans' initial TD drive went (J8 yards
in eight plays with powering fullback Ray Chilton leading the attack
and finally scoring. Hill added the first of four etxras.

Rice scored twice more in the
first half, piling up a set of sta-
I tistics at half-time that looked
! more like a set of finals. Twelve
j first downs, 347 net yards, five
passes completed in eight tries,
all in 47 plays, were the figures
behind the Owls' 21-0 half-time
lead.
Although coach Jess Neely's
Owls looked like they'd never
stop moving in their first - half
i plays, the Indians were not com
j pletely out shone.
Stanford started its first-down
series on its own 31, with Shea
j leading a hard-driving attack that
I moved steadily toward the Rice
I goal until he fumbled on the Owl
47, Rice guard Cliff McGraw re
! covering.
Disappointed by their inability
to match the Owls' scoring drive,
the Indians seemed to wait pa
tiently for a chance to grab the
pigskin again. Their next chance
came as the second quarter
opened.
Penalty Hurls
Taking the ball on their own
nine, with Nicole! calling signals,
: Stanford bowled up to the Rice
i 45 when a penalty for an ineli
gible receiver down field forced a
| punt on the following play. After
S giving up the ball, the Indians
: nevrt - looked themselves until
j their scoring drive with five min
! utes left in the game.
After watching tho Owls con
trol the ball for more than "two
thirds of the third quarter, and
i finally score in the opening of
the final stanza, Stanford turned
on a desperation drive to leave a
mark on the scoreboard before
| time ran out.
Rice's kick-off to the Injuns
started the locals' lone successful
stint with halfback Roy Stephen
returning for 14 yards to the
Card 33. Halfback John Bond,
Stephen, Garber and McMillen
shared carrying honors with the
latter finally bucking right end
for the score.
Too Little Too Late
It took only nine plays for the
i Tribe to drive the 07 yards, but
the drive and determination
came too late in the game. Five
minutes arid 24 seconds remained
when Stanford's 7 went up in
lights.
If nothing else, the touchdown
turned up one bit of information.
With Garber holding, Bond at
tempted the PAT, and split the
uprights with comparative ease.
Rice managed to share scoring
honors, splitting the glory be
tween three of its backs and two
ends. Chilton took the first, Hill's
pass to Dial garnered the second,

fullback Dave Kelley climaxed a
93-yard drive to post the third
and Mill himself elected to take
the fourth, with Roll Robicheaux
getting the final one.
Filth Try Misses
Hill hooted the first four ex
tras, hut halfback Bill Bucek's
try for the capper went astray.
Although tie slatted as the sec
ond • unit signal - caller, Frank
Ryan managed lo come out the
star of the game. He completed
eight of 12 passes for 123 yards
while grabbing up 78 yards in 12
totes for a G.5 carrying average.
Hill connected on four of seven
aerial attempts lo net 117 yard
stripes. His running game gives
him credit for 05 yards in five
carries, averaging 13 yards a try.
Stanford's quarterbacks fared
less well. Douglas had no offen
sive record when he left the
game, and Gather and Nicole)
completed five passes between
them, in T4 passes, for only 52
yards. The two combine their

running games for a two-yard
net.
Sli<»a Leads for Cards-
Shea, 47 yards, was the Cards'
leading ground gainer, with Har
rington (28) and Stephen (27)
next in line.
Rice almost scored three more
times in the contest, but wasn't
able to cash in on opportunity.
Late in the opening period Chil
ton bucked into t he end zone,
hobbling the ball all Ihe way for
a touchback.
