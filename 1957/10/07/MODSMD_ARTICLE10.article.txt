# Russian Moon Experimental; IGY Sphere to Be Launched
## 
### 
WASHINGTON *(/P) The fir.st
earth satellite continued its beep
beep flight around the earth yes
terday, and a Russian researcher
declared that his country plans to
launch a second sphere "in the?
nearest future."
Prof. A. A. Blagonravov, a So
viet satellite expert who lias been
attending a scientific conference
here, said the baby moon now
circling the globe is not the device
the U.S.S.R. promised to send
aloft as part of the International
Geophysical Year program.
Blagonravov said the second
satellite would be an IGY project,
and that all Information gleaned
from its flight would be shared
with scientists of the world.
His statements, made in a tele
vision interview, left in doubt the
question of whether Russia plans
to share the knowledge it gains
from its present pioneer in space.

I Blagonravov said first Soviet
| estimates indicated the present
baby moon would stay aloft about
one month. He said these calcula
| lions were not exact.
Blagonravov declared that Rus
! sia flid not announce in advance
its plans to launch its first satel
lite because the first one was con
sidered experimental not a part
'of the official IGY program of
I satellite launching. He also con-
I ceded that Soviet scientists were
not sure their plans would suc
ceed.
American satellite trackers
were pushing ahead with a "crash
program" of revising special radio
observation stations in order to
determine the specific orbit of the
Russian satellite.
Regarding radio signals from
the whizzing moon, Blagonravov
said there is 110 special code in
the signals."
