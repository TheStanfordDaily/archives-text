# Bring On the Cougars
## 
### 
Now THAT wild hopes for an undefeated grid
iron season for Stanford have been stored away
for another year, the Cards and their backers
can settle down to the serious business of going
after the I9, r )7 Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship.
The PCC flag chase will begin for Chuck
Taylor's Indians Saturday when Washington
Stale moves into Stanford Stadium, and w ill
continue for six more games after that.
So far as the team itself is concerned, there
doesn't appear to be much chance for a serious
letdown. In the locker room after the Kice
game, the Indians were already looking ahead
to the Cougars and brandishing such comments
as, "That's the only one well lose this year."
If this team attitude prevails for the Wash
ington Stale struggle, the only other problem
left in the mental outlook department will con
cern the student body.
It is this remaining problem that always

seems to plague Stanford Iho week after a loss.
That army of Indian rooters that praises vie
torv to the rooftops is I lie same army which
condemns every move in a losing hattle and
which comes to the next game ready to jeer at
the slightest opportunity.
li s true that the Redskins were heaten con
vincingly hy Rice- hut it's also true that the
Owls must he considered among the nation's
finest teams.
Before the season even begun, those sup
posedly "in the know" said Stanford was going
to have a long, lean fall. Thus far, the Tribe
has done better than expected. Instead of criti
cizing llie (lards for losing to a superior team,
then, how about we, the student body, pulling
an about-face and putting positive support he
hind a team that's going to go a lot further
than most people suspect.
BRING ON THE COUGARS!
