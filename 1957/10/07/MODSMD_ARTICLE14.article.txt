# MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
## What About the Bookstore? 
### David Egger 
This year a new element modulated ihe cas
cading complaints about textbook lines. Stan
ford University, after 60 years, is to have a new
bookstore. Soon. Perhaps by next fall (or so tho
Bookstore directorate hopes).
But with the memories of the recent lines
fresh in mind, perhaps now would be the time
to mention what seems to me the major short
coming of tho present Bookstore. The lines are
bad, but tolerable. Unavailable texts are exas
perating, but their absence is as often the fault
of the professors who fail to submit their orders
as the fault of the Bookstore for not stocking
standard volumes.
But what is not tolerable is the amazing lack
of books in general. The eager bibliophile, hav
ing waited the first two weeks of school for the
textbook buyers to depart, when he finally
makes his assault upon the general book sec
tion of the Stanford Bookstore, is greeted by a
table of cartoon books, the left-over selections
from the current quarter's humanities courses,
a smattering of iho Modern Library, and that
is just about that. The Stanford book lover must
either do without or else catch the next train
to San Francisco.
The fact that the Bookstore makes a fat profit
and returns a big chunk of this to the students
in the form of rebates is no excuse for not
having any books. The extra five dollars or so
which a student receives from the profits of the
toys - and - greeting â€¢ cards section is simply not
worth having to settle for a bookstore sans
books. If that extra five were so important, cer
lainly none of us would pay the $7#) a year tui
lion (next year $1005). We'd all have gone to
< 'al. The reason that most of us didn't go to Cal
was that we felt we could get a better education

here, and part of that education consists of hav
ing available a source of books, all kinds of
books, which can be handled, perused and/or
purchased. The situation would not be so bad
if Palo Alto were simply alive with bookstores:
new bookstores, used bookstores, paper-back
bookstores. But after Kepler's, what?
Last year when plans for ihe new store were
finally being talked about, seriously, a special
committee was formed to examine the problems
of the general book department to make sure
that the new Stanford Bookstore would not have
the same failings as tho old. This committee in
cluded such men as Dr. Philip H. Rhinelander,
Dean of Humanities and Sciences, and Dr. John
Dodds, director of the special program in hti
inanities for undergraduates. Their recommen
dations included a request for a major increase
in the physical size of the general hook depart
ment: more books displayed on more spacious
shelves.
The committee specifically requested that the
range of books be extended to include nearly all
the paperback series, including Ihe now conspic
uously absent Penguin. Also, the entire Every
man series, some reprints and the major quar
terlies were cited as being necessary if Stanford
Bookstore is no longer to be a misnomer. The
directors of Ihe Bookstore seemed to have agreed
to all this. There will be roughly four times as
much space allotted to general books available
now.
If the new Bookstore proceeds as planned (and
if Stanford students oppose any last-minute
decision to let stationery outrank fiction), maybe
next year you'll overhear a hook lover saying,
"You know what I found right next to the Klee
nex? Books!"
