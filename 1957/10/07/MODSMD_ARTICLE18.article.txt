# THREE YEARS OLD
## Stu-Fac Com Seeks Common Bond

Stanford students and faculty
can have a closer friendship than
in the classroom, decided two
Stanford women three years ago.
i With this one germ of an idea,
they set out to project closer un
derstanding among students and
faculty.
Their idea spread around cam
pus, and in a short time students
and faculty alike were forming a
group to close the gap between
them. Thus was begun the Stu
dent-Faculty Commission.
The of the commission is
to develop a permanent common
bond between students and fac
ulty emphasizing the academic
level. The group wants to attain
an informal type of learning, em
phasizing c 1 os e understanding
and common interests between
faculty and students.
When the group was originally
initiated there were 23 members
and it was given a committee
standing. The committee mem
bers of each class were divided
into separate smaller committees
under a steering committee.
The number was l'elt to be too
big, so it was cut to its present
size of 12. A minimum of two
students from each class is on
the committee. One graduate stu
dent and two faculty members
complete the group.
The Student'Faeulty Commis
sion has organized various func
tions to further its goal. Faculty
teas, residence open houses, and
'other activities have been spon
sored by the committee. It has
been allotted a special Dean's
Fund from Which a group of not
Jess than three students may pay
for a faculty guest's meal.
Faculty members are also wel
come to use this special fund to
entertain student s in their
' homes. This has been done a few

times in past years, but the com
mittee hopes to have many more
students and faculty lake advan
tage of the opportunity to use
this money for furthering com
mon understanding.
Because ASSU felt the commit
tee was doing a valuable service,
it was made a commission when

tho now AS.SU constitution wont
into (fleet.
Plans lor this year include or
gani/ini/ student faculty lounges,
ri.lteo hours and other functions
vviiicli will help the commission
reach its goal of achieving a spon
taneous relationship between stu
dents and faculty.

Stanford students and faculty
can have a closer friendship than
in the classroom, decided two
Stanford women three years ago.
i With this one germ of an idea,
they set out to project closer un
derstanding among students and
faculty.
Their idea spread around cam
pus, and in a short time students
and faculty alike were forming a
group to close the gap between
them. Thus was begun the Stu
dent-Faculty Commission.
The of the commission is
to develop a permanent common
bond between students and fac
ulty emphasizing the academic
level. The group wants to attain
an informal type of learning, em
phasizing c 1 os e understanding
and common interests between
faculty and students.
When the group was originally
initiated there were 23 members
and it was given a committee
standing. The committee mem
bers of each class were divided
into separate smaller committees
under a steering committee.
The number was l'elt to be too
big, so it was cut to its present
size of 12. A minimum of two
students from each class is on
the committee. One graduate stu
dent and two faculty members
complete the group.
