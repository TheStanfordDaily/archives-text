# Neely: 'We Played a Good Solid Game'; Taylon: 'We Didn't Have the Ball Enough'
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
Joss Neely's answers were just
about audible over the jubilant
shouting in the Rice dressing
room. It's important to win your
first game ol' the season, but it's
even more important to win your
first home game.
Across the ramp where 37 In
dians were taking off their war
paint things were a little more
quiet. Many were thinking about
the 2Vn hours that had just
passed.
"We played a good solid game,"
Neely noted, "and I had no idea
we'd beat Stanford by this score.

Nor did I have any idea we'd
throw more passes than they did.
T didn't really feel that the game
was ours until midway through
the fourth quarter.
A Dangerous Team
"Stanford is a dangerous team,"
ho went on to say, "a real tough
outfit. I'm sure they just had a
rough night. Perhaps they had
psychological trouble, but I doubt
it. And I don't think it was the
weather, either."
That's how the Owl mentor felt
as he began his 18th season in
Houston. And all the while he
spoke, he would interrupt on oc
casion to throw out a word of
congratulations to members of his
squad as they loft the dressing
room.
"I'm thankful for them," he
nodded as Frank Ryan and King
Hill went out the door, "the best
one-two punch a coach could hope
for. I start one one week and the
other the next, and they continu
ally outdo each other every time."
Where's the Ball?
Chuck Taylor, with a night to
think things over, had this to say
about the Indians: "It seemed like
we couldn't got our hands on the
ball; wo didn't have it enough to
generate anything."
Stanford was never psychologi
cally defeated, ihe Indian mentor
felt. At least not before Rice's
quick score. "Maybe when Doug
las got knocked out, hut not bo
fore." We seemed to bo running
well, he felt, but didn't have much
chance to run anywhere.
Rice, in the game, ran a dif
ferent style of play than the Owls
had used against their first oppo
nent, Louisiana State. "It's possi
ble," Taylor mused, "that our
boys couldn't quite adjust to it."
llig Question
The big question of electing to
kick rather than receive brought
no change in Taylor's earlier phi
losophy. "A new team is likely to
be nervous, and sometimes this
can be made to work for us," he
said, "but it had no effect on Rice,
good or bad.
"I won't say I'm not going to
change my thoughts along this
line, because it all depends on the
game."
What did ho toll the team at.
half lime? "Well, I told them to
try to take better care of the Rice

backs and to try to get the ball —
there really wasn't much to say."
Sophomore Sid Carber and jun
ior Bob Nicolet drew the chore of
calling signals for the Cards after
Jackie Douglas left the game, and
their report on the swift-moving
Rice squad was an interesting
one.
Quarterbacks Speak
Nicolet: It wasn't so much find
ing a play that would work as it
was making any play work. They
were really fired up, and that line
was really rushing hard and
strong.
Garber: Our whole offense
should have worked. Rice was
really eager. I wish we could have
had our hands on the ball longer.
Newsmen from the Houston-
Dallas area voiced interesting
comments for supposed foreign
ers to the Stanford team. "I can't
believe it," one voiced. "I know
thev're a much better team."


lON ROUTE TO NUMBER THREE—Rice half
back Bobby Williams (43) stepped his way for
live yards late in flic second period as the Owls
drove toward their third touchdown against
Stanford. Williams moved the Imll to the Card

14 behind the blocking 1 of Charlie Knight (59).
Three plays later, fullback Dave Kelley plunged
for two yards and a 21-0 half-time lead for the
Owls.
