## 
### 
San Francisco put in two goals
in the first 10 minutes, then held
on to win, 2-1, as the Stanford
soccer team gradually took con
trol of play in the second half
during its conference opener Sat
urday at USF field, in the city.
The first quarter was dominat
ed by the home team as it contin
ually put pressure on the Stan
ford defense with dangerous
crosses. After 10 minutes, inside
left Joe Braghai took a short pass
at tho edge of the penalty area
and beat Cardinal goalie Tony
Chanler with a shot into the
upper right-hand corner.
Within a minute USF had an
other goal as left wing Stephens
first-timed a cross in the air. Stan
ford scored just before half time
when Keve Larsen took a through
pass from inside Ben Pentsil. His
shot beat the goalie and was de
flected in by the Dons' back try
ing to save the goal.
The third quarter was control
led by the Cardinals, who twice
almost scored on goal-line mud
dles, but could not put in the tying
goal. The team plays at home
Saturday against Santa Clara.
