# Delay Ends in Sale of Encina Meal Tickets
## Kitchen Reorganized To Serve Increase In Student Patronage 
### 
The sale of meal tickets at En
cina dining hall has been delayed
to allow time for a rescheduling
of manpower and food quantities
necessitated by a 5 per cent in
crease in the sale of meal tickets
over last year.
Students who were unable to
buy tickets last week will be able
to do so today, said Mrs. Doris
Abbott of Encina dining hall.
According to Mrs. Abbott, plans
had been made before opening of
this quarter to accommodate the
same number of students as last
year,
More Tickets
But, according to Mrs. Abbott,
on Sept. 25 ticket sales exceeded
those of last year by 30. The
kitchen was running out of food,
and excessively long lines were
causing much annoyance to stu
dents.
On Sept. 25, ticket sales were
stopped and a waiting list begun
so that the dining hall would
know how many students to plan
for.
Waiting Lists
On Sept. 30, tickets were sold
to all those students on the wait
ing list, and a now list was start
ed. Students on the second list
will be able to buy their tickets
today.
Mrs. Abbott expressed regret
over the inconvenience caused by
the delay. She emphasized that
all students will be able to buy i
tickets and that, "we will not de-1
prive anyone of a meal ticket fori
the entire quarter."
