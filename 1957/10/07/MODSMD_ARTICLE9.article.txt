# Satellite Glides in Space; SRI Listening for Signals
## 'Ham' Radio Sets Receiving Beeps From Russ 'Sputnik' 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
Stanford Research Institute (SRI), using mammoth radar 1 anion
Viae, is co-operating with radar centers all Over the world that ai
trying to pick up radio signals from the Russian-made earth satellite
The staff is as yet unsuccessful with the big equipment, but will
its small radios is picking up the signals with a beep-beep at the

rate of one every three • tenths
second.
The satellite passed near Stan
ford at 10:45 last night and short
ly after midnight this morning.
It passes again today at 7:11 a.m..
8:45 a.m. and 10:44 p.m., and to
morrow morning at 12:20 a.m. It
is not visible to the naked eye, but
its signals are audible on radio
sets.
Ham Radios
Ham radio operators can pick
up the signals at frequencies of
20.005 and 40.002 megacycles
Dr. Allen M. Peterson of SRI is
supervising the work of about 2~
students and faculty members at
the Research site. He said the
antennae, located in the hills be
hind Ryan High-Voltage Labora
tory, have not been able to suc
cessfully pick up the satellite's
signals.
The Propagation Laboratory's
2000-foot antenna, supervised by
Dr. V. R. Eshelman, was origi
nally designed for tracking me
teors and cannot pick up "Sput
nik," as the satellite has been
called by Washington scientists.
Second Antenna
The other antenna, designed foi
picking up signals bounced oi l the
moon, has a small 3-degree beam
which would make contact with
the satellite for only 12 seconds
each time it came near.
The Institute of Radio Engi
neers and the Stanford branch of
the American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers are sponsoring ;i
talk by Dr. Peterson at their first
meeting of the year, this Wednes
day evening at 7:15 in room 310,
Crothers Memorial.
Dr. Peterson will discuss the
SRI radar and answer informal
questions. Having spent the week
end tracking the earth satellite,
he will be able to give information
on Sputnik also. The talk will be
followed by a field trip Oct. 25 tn
the radar site behind campus. All
interested students are invited.
lonosphere Kef lection
Signals are received at Stanford
at times during the day when
Sputnik is over some other part
of the world. The signals, accord
ing to Dr. O. G. Villard of the
Propagation Laboratory, arc re
flected from the ionosphere and
bounce back to earth.
Moscow's Sunday morning pa
pers were full of news and edi
torials about the satellite. The re
action of the Soviet man in the
street was that in a few years he
will be able to step into a travel
bureau and buy a ticket to the
moon.
All the Russian press accounts
heaped praise on Soviet science,
with credit going to the Soviet
Communist system for producing
such an achievement.


SIM ANTENNAE —Stanford Research Institute is, trying to track
flic Russian earth satellite, "Sputnik," with giant radar antennae
like this one in the. Stanford hills, hilt as yet Mir only way they
have been able to receive the beeps is on a small radio receiver,
like those owned by many "hams."
