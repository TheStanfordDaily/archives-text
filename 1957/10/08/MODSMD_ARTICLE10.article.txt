# Scientists, Computers Hit Snags In Determining 'Sputnik' Course
## Minitrack System May Yield Accurate Prediction of Orbit American Observatories Hope to Photograph Russian Baby Moon Within Eight to Nine Days 
### 
WASHINGTON (TP) —American scientists, working with complex
mechanical brains, reported varying results last night from their
efforts to establish the orbit of_the Soviet earth satellite.
The Navy reported:
"The Naval Research Laboratory minitrack system is now pro-

during very satisfactory data.
"They are being fed to the IBM
computer machine at the com
puting center . . . and the quality
of the resulting orbit information
will enable us to give scientifi
cally accurate minute-by-minute
predictions for alerting the opti
cal and radio tracking systems."
Computations
Moonwatch scientists at Cam
bridge, Mass., first reported they,
too, were making good progress
with their computations, but
later said they had run into diffi
culties.
Insufficient or inaccurate data
were blamed for the failure by
Dr. Fred L. Whipple, director of
the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.
Dr. Whipple told a news con
ference that one of the three ob
servations — two in Alaska and
one in Australia — "may have
been in error."
Southeasterly
The Soviet sphere is shooting
across this country in a south
easterly direction. It follows a
fairly steady course but because
the earth is turning beneath it
the satellite in effect moves 1500
miles westward with each orbit.
Within eight or nine days,
American astronomical observa
tories may get photographs of
the baby moon. These will be
made during a dawn or dusk
passover, periods when the satel
lite will reflect sunlight from be
low the horizon and become vis
ible.
Have Good "Fix"
In the three days the satellite
has been aloft the scientists say
they have gotten a good "fix" on
it and can plot its course up to
a week in advance. A spokesman
at the Naval Research Labora
tory here said Navy researchers
now know when they get the
beeping signal from the satellite
that their readings are precise to
1-10,000 th of a second.
Meanwhile, high above the sci
entific uproar, the moonlet con
tinued to whiz around the earth
at 18,000 miles an hour in v/hat
the Navy scientists described as
"a fairly circular orbit." Its
height has been estimated to
range from a minimum of 400
miles to 560.
Weight Uncertain
There has been some uncer
tainty in this country about the
weight of the "sputnik," the Rus
sian word for earth satellite.
The Vanguard satellite being
prepared for launching from a
U.S. base next spring is to weigh
only about 20 pounds. Questions
have been raised whether the
Russian device weighs 184
pounds or 18.4 pounds.
But an interpreter for three
visiting Russian scientists quoted
them as saying they had to go up
to 184 pounds — although they
would have preferred a lighter
weight — because of the heavy
batteries needed to keep the radio
signal going.
Meanwhile, headquarters of
I Project Vanguard said the earth
j satellite launched by the Rus
sians will pass over San Fran
cisco at 7:11 a.m. PST today.
