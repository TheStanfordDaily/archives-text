MOSCOW C/P) —'The rocket that
carried the Soviet Union's earth
satellite into its orbit has become
a satellite itself and is circling
the earth, too.
A special communique broad
cast by Moscow Radio told the
Soviet people the rocket, presum
ably the third stage or the stage
which finally kicked the satellite
off on its own. was following the
satellite by 1000 kilometers (about
620 miles) as it. bulleted through
space.
Both objects were 560 miles up
and following to the split second
schedules predicted for the satel
lite by the men who made it, the
communique said.
It added that actually many ob
servers, presumably in the Soviet
Union and elsewhere, are concen
trating on the rocket which
launched the satellite and which
"is now following the satellite . . .
in the same orbit."
The announcement said the 620-
mile distance would "alter in the
future," and scientists expressed
belief this was because the outer
cover of the satellite and the re
mains of the rocket could be ex
pected to react differently.
