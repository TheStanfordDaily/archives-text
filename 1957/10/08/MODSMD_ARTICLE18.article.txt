# Phones Permitted In Part of Village As Policy Changes
## 
### 
Residents of Sterling A and B,
Terman A and B, and Remele are
now allowed to have private tele
phones installed in their rooms.
Individual arrangements for
service may be made with the
telephone company. Students can
place outgoing calls from their
rooms as well as receive calls.
University policy regarding tel
ephones in rooms lias been chang
ed for the Village because of the
limited service available there, ac
cording to director of residences
John M. Yarborough. The main
switchboard at the Village has
been closed, and the only service
now available to residents is > a
telephone on each floor.
Yarborough said the telephone
company has agreed to extend
service to Sterling, Terman and
Remele because they are occupied
all year and they are already
wired. During World War II these
buildings were used by nurses and
officers at Dibble General Hospi
tal. Service was extended to the
rooms at that time.
Buildings 306 and 308, which
were hospital wards, do not have
telephone facilities, and private
service will not be available to
residents.
Sterling, Terman find Remele
are currently occupied by a total
of 285 graduates, seniors, juniors
and sophomores.
