# RUSHING PROGRAM
## IFC Proposes Open House Schedule for Winter Quarter 
### Jack Winkler 
The Interfraternity Council passed a motion last night to sched
ule four fraternity open houses during winter quarter, beginning
around Feb. (5 and evenly spaced thereafter until the week prior to
Dead Week. Exact time will be announced next week.
The proposal is only an IFC suggestion, but Rushing Committee

Chairman John Kidd will seek ;
University approval today and ac-!
eeptancc of the motion is ex-:
pected.
In a meeting a' the Delta Kap
pa Epsilon house the 24 frater
nity presidents voted to divide
the freshman class and the fra
ternities into four groups each >
and send one section of freshmen j
to each fraternity group on a ro-1
tation basis.
The purpose of the winter
quarter open houses, as con
ceived by the IFC, is to allow i
freshmen to get a picture of fra- J
ternity life before the pressure of
formal rushing, and without de
tracting too greatly from study
time.
Eating Clubs
As in previous years the eating
clubs will have the option of
scheduling one or two open
houses before the fraternity
schedule begins.
Actual rushing will begin in
the first week of spring quarter.
During this time there will be a
limited number of open houses,
probably two or three, before the
beginning of invitation parties.
A mistake was made in report
ing the revisions of the no-con
tact rule passed by the IFC last
week. There will be no off-cam
pus social relationships allowed
between freshmen and fraternity
men. Freshmen will not be al
lowed in Row houses or frater
nity men in Wilbur, but other
wise normal social relationships
will prevail.
