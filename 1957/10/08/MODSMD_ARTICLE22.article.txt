# Student Defiance in Warsaw
## 
### 
FREEDOM of the collegiate press is an issue that
pertains not only to The Daily, it seems. It is
a principle thai finds expression even in Com
munist satellite countries.
The latest attacks on censorship and banning
of student papers has occurred iu Warsaw by
students attending the University of Warsaw.
Their student newspaper, I'o I'rostu, has been
banned bv the Communist party central com
mittee for ultra-violent attacks on Stalinism.
A meeting of 2000 students Saturday night
approved a letter by the editorial board sent
to Premier Gomulka charging that militia
methods would bring back a regime of fear.
And militia methods have certainly been used
by the government to suppress the student
riots.
Of great significance is the fact that the riots,
originating with just the students, have spread,
to include the local populace. In fact, Saturday
night's demonstrations included few, if any,
students. There had been a student decision
to remain indoors under threat of expulsion.

The Hungarian rebellion began with student
demonstrations which spread over to the gen
eral population. There is no sign that a repeat
might occur in Poland but it stands to reason
that governmental authorities are worried
about the possibility.
Human dignity and freedom of expression
cannot be forever kept in subjugation. We
sympathize with our colleagues in Warsaw,
and we wish them success in their endeavors
to retain that minimum of free expression they
did have.
Our colleagues have been expelled from the
Communist party as penalty for their deviation
from the Communist party line. In Poland,
under the present regime, this is a serious block
to their future careers. Strangely enough, this
has not caused much repentance from them.
There has been no admission ol guilt jnt-l a
defiance.
It will be interesting to discover who will
knuckle under first the Communist party cen
tral committee or I'o Pro-in.
