# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By John Lane
## Execrable Failure To Appeal 
### 
Because of our execrable failure to appear in
time to make deadline Sunday, it is assumed that
7,400 members of the Stanford student body
missed Monday's Department of Biological Sci
ences Seminar in "Field Experiments on Biology
of Trifurus." Our absence is a more than la
mentable oversight, and will not, in our regard
for thfe biological stimulation of the campus,
happen again.
But there is, dear friends, still time.
Tonight at 7:30, in the bitter cold of the West's
evening, Dr. Anthony Sokol, professor of inter
national security, Hoover Institution and De
pat tment of Political Science (the FBI is every
where these days) will give his impressions as
"An American Visiting Professor in Austria."
# #
It will soon be that lime of the year when the
studious Wilbur herd finds lhat the jutting piece
of equipment on Ihe wall opposite the door is
merely a decorative carryover from the non
functional rococo school of architecture. In prep
aration for this bitter revelation, it would be
good for the shivering little people to hear how
they do "Low-Temperature Work at the Univer
sity of British Columbia." Did we raise your
hopes? Hee hee. This is the title of Wednesday's
Physics Department Colloquium, conducted by
Dr. William A. Little of the University of British
Columbia, to be given at 4 p.m. in Room 101 of
the Physics Lecture Hall.
But don't stay long there. Race quickly, at
4:15, to Room 20 of the Chemistry Building to
hear Vernon J. Rossow of the Ames Aeronautical
Laboratories monologuizing "Magneto - hydrody
namics." This enlightening drama will be the
proud production of the Seminar in Chemical
Engineering and Applied Chemistry.
After the day's exertion of classes, dorm dis
cussions of low-temperature hydrodynamics and
adequate contented chewing of Norman Vincent
Peale's latest cud, one may, at 9:30 p.m., amble
past Mrs. Stanford's inscriptions to partake of
the inspiration of the Candlelight Service in Me
morial Church. Organ meditation, Scripture
reading, and prayer.

If one has a spinning wheel, a box of assorted
fat, and, we are solemnly informed, a Reserva
tion (but not: what about), one may attend the
Distaff Club luncheon Thursday noon in the Gar
den Room of the Union dining room. So there.
At 3:15 p.m. Thursday (we'll play it straight
this time, factiousness is bad on a full stomach)
Professor of Mathematics George E. Forsythe
will address Ihe Mathematics Department Collo
quium on the subject of "Singularity and Near
singularity in Numerical Analysis" in Room 104
of Sequoia Hall.
If one is sure of his/her class standing, and
not afraid of other embarrassment, he/she may
with temerity attend the frolic of Ihe Stanford
Folk Dancers at* 8 on Friday's warm Balkan eve
ning in the Village Auditorium. Don't bother
wearing shirts; it's more folksy that way.
Messieurs Sandor Salgo and William L. Cros
ten, violinist and pianist respectively, will wait
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium until 8:30 for ye lads
and lassies who find ye village green inferior to
Our Board-Chairman's Wife's plush-seated me
morial. Then Ihey will proceed with their con
cert.

You fellas know what's happening Saturday.
We don't have to tell you what's happening Sat
urday. We're gonna beat the pants off of Wash
ington State U. in our stadium, man. Rah and
yea. 2 p.m., spectators.
<t # #
Sunday being a day of rest, one may start
resting at 9 a.m. at Holy Communion, continue
resting at Reverend Minto's 11 a.m. church
service, become thoroughly lethargic 1o the
drone of the 4 p.m. organ recital by Acting Uni
versity Organist Donald B. Aird—all of this still
in Memorial Church and erupt into collegiate
adolescence, wilhout fear of the presence of
Madison Avenue spies (it's a, you know, conven
tion atmosphere) at the first mass-emotion stim
ulation of "The Racers," this restful evening's
flick. The 20-cent abomination starts at 7:30.
Pax vobiscum.

After the day's exertion of classes, dorm dis

At 3:15 p.m. Thursday (we'll play it straight

Professor of Mathematics George E. Forsythe
will address Ihe Mathematics Department Collo

If one is sure of his/her class standing, and

Sunday being a day of rest, one may start
resting at 9 a.m. at Holy Communion, continue
resting at Reverend Minto's 11 a.m. church
service, become thoroughly lethargic 1o the
drone of the 4 p.m. organ recital by Acting Uni
versity Organist Donald B. Aird—all of this still
in Memorial Church and erupt into collegiate
adolescence, wilhout fear of the presence of
Madison Avenue spies (it's a, you know, conven

ulation of "The Racers," this restful evening's
flick. The 20-cent abomination starts at 7:30.
Pax vobiscum.
Because of our execrable failure to appear in
time to make deadline Sunday, it is assumed that
7,400 members of the Stanford student body
missed Monday's Department of Biological Sci

of Trifurus." Our absence is a more than la

happen again.
But there is, dear friends, still time.
Tonight at 7:30, in the bitter cold of the West's

Sunday being a day of rest, one may start
resting at 9 a.m. at Holy Communion, continue
resting at Reverend Minto's 11 a.m. church
service, become thoroughly lethargic 1o the
drone of the 4 p.m. organ recital by Acting Uni
versity Organist Donald B. Aird—all of this still
in Memorial Church and erupt into collegiate
adolescence, wilhout fear of the presence of
Madison Avenue spies (it's a, you know, conven
tion atmosphere) at the first mass-emotion stim
ulation of "The Racers," this restful evening's
flick. The 20-cent abomination starts at 7:30.
Pax vobiscum.
Because of our execrable failure to appear in
time to make deadline Sunday, it is assumed that
7,400 members of the Stanford student body
missed Monday's Department of Biological Sci
ences Seminar in "Field Experiments on Biology
of Trifurus." Our absence is a more than la
mentable oversight, and will not, in our regard
for thfe biological stimulation of the campus,
happen again.
But there is, dear friends, still time.
Tonight at 7:30, in the bitter cold of the West's
evening, Dr. Anthony Sokol, professor of inter
national security, Hoover Institution and De
pat tment of Political Science (the FBI is every
where these days) will give his impressions as
"An American Visiting Professor in Austria."

It will soon be that lime of the year when the
studious Wilbur herd finds lhat the jutting piece
of equipment on Ihe wall opposite the door is
merely a decorative carryover from the non
functional rococo school of architecture. In prep
aration for this bitter revelation, it would be
good for the shivering little people to hear how
they do "Low-Temperature Work at the Univer
sity of British Columbia." Did we raise your
hopes? Hee hee. This is the title of Wednesday's
Physics Department Colloquium, conducted by
Dr. William A. Little of the University of British
Columbia, to be given at 4 p.m. in Room 101 of
the Physics Lecture Hall.
But don't stay long there. Race quickly, at
4:15, to Room 20 of the Chemistry Building to
hear Vernon J. Rossow of the Ames Aeronautical
Laboratories monologuizing "Magneto - hydrody
namics." This enlightening drama will be the
proud production of the Seminar in Chemical
Engineering and Applied Chemistry.
After the day's exertion of classes, dorm dis
cussions of low-temperature hydrodynamics and
adequate contented chewing of Norman Vincent
Peale's latest cud, one may, at 9:30 p.m., amble
past Mrs. Stanford's inscriptions to partake of
the inspiration of the Candlelight Service in Me
morial Church. Organ meditation, Scripture
reading, and prayer.

If one has a spinning wheel, a box of assorted
fat, and, we are solemnly informed, a Reserva
tion (but not: what about), one may attend the
Distaff Club luncheon Thursday noon in the Gar
den Room of the Union dining room. So there.
At 3:15 p.m. Thursday (we'll play it straight
this time, factiousness is bad on a full stomach)
Professor of Mathematics George E. Forsythe
will address Ihe Mathematics Department Collo
quium on the subject of "Singularity and Near
singularity in Numerical Analysis" in Room 104
of Sequoia Hall.
If one is sure of his/her class standing, and
not afraid of other embarrassment, he/she may
with temerity attend the frolic of Ihe Stanford
Folk Dancers at* 8 on Friday's warm Balkan eve
ning in the Village Auditorium. Don't bother
wearing shirts; it's more folksy that way.
Messieurs Sandor Salgo and William L. Cros
ten, violinist and pianist respectively, will wait

and lassies who find ye village green inferior to
