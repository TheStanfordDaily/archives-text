Rice might become a powerhouse of the Southwest Conference,
but most preseason prognosticators picked them no higher than
filth behind Texas A&M, Baylor, Arkansas and TCU. Cut on the
other hand, the Owls just might turn out fifth or lower. And it
would not be the first time that Stanford's early-season opponents,
.•'gainst whom the Indians usually win, became eventual doormats
of the conference.
Remember 1954. It was that year when the fighting Illini came
West wiih a Big Ten "powerhouse." The Cards had defeated COP
t|,'M2) and Oregon (18-13) before going into the game. And it was
national TV. What happened? Stanford played the script brilliantly
by stopping J. C. Caroline with only 34 yards gained all day. Final
score: Stanford 12, Illinois 2.
Writers started up the bandwagon. But when the smoke cleared
away the Cards had lost to Navy (25-0), UCLA (72-0), Washington
Slate (30-26), USC (21-7), San Jose State (19-14) and Cal (28-20).
They did manage to recover from the UCLA massacre and down
Washington 13-7 for a 4-6 season record. And the Illini did equally
as bad in their neck of the woods.
This is not to say Rice will finish in the cellar, but it could hap
-1 en. Stanford could lose all of its seven remaining games. But they
won't. And they'll do better' than the predicted sixth in league play
IF Jackie Douglas is returned to full effectiveness. Not to leave
out the names of such men as Lou Valli, Gary Van Galder, Koch
< oriklin and -firir Byrer.
If I hey are ready to go Saturday, I'll pick Stanford fiver the
Cougars. But the Indians have their work cut out for them and it
won i be as easy as it. reads—-STOP THOSE WSC PASSES.
Why Did Rice Win?
Why did Rice beat Stanford?
Since that disastrous night in humid Houston, many Monday
morning quarterbacks have given their "expert" opinion on why
the Indians collapsed before the Rice Owls, 3-1-7. Some are i idiculous
and some have merit:
1. The weather was so humid that the Cards' defensive speed
was curtailed. It was just as sultry for Rice.
2. Rice used a slightly different offense against Stanford than
Ihoy did against LSU The Owls tightened their T-attack and ran
more. Stanford has altered their attack a little this year also. Be
sides the obvious fact of running the ball more, the flanker back is
between the spread end and the tackle, not outside the end as it was
last year - . But Rice's attack did seem to confuse Taylor's men some.
He admitted as much.
3. The Indians wore psychologically down. Why? Some say they
wore pointing ahead to YVSC; some say the heat, again; some say
injuries. The latter might have some merit, but the game was al
ready under way and Rice was running wild before Jack Douglas
was injured. And besides, the Big Red has vowed to win the remain
ing eight games and spirits on the team are high.
Stanford made a big mistake to kick off first and give Rice Iho
first opportunity to score. Coach Chuck's strategy worked fine in
the first two games and not a word was said.
5. It was a night game. Wo won the night game last year against
WSC, so night games are not the reason. In fact, Rice's stadium
i one of the best, if nol the best, lighted grid parks in the country.
(i. Rice was fired up to ihe hilt with the desire to win and "could
do no wrong." Couple this with Stanford's early game injuries to
key men and the sloppy performance of fundamentals tackling,
blocking and aggressiveness- and you have the ingredients for a
Rice win, Indian defeat.
Taylor said the Indians couldn't got their hands on the ball. A
team has to have a tackling and aggressive defense to accomplish
that. And Stanford didn't have it Saturday.
(iarber did his best to hold this team unity which has been the
cor nerstone of 1 his 1957 Big Rod Machine, but ho wasn't enough.

Why Did Rice Win?
Why did Rice beat Stanford?
Since that disastrous night in humid Houston, many Monday
morning quarterbacks have given their "expert" opinion on why
the Indians collapsed before the Rice Owls, 3-1-7. Some are i idiculous
and some have merit:
1. The weather was so humid that the Cards' defensive speed
was curtailed. It was just as sultry for Rice.
2. Rice used a slightly different offense against Stanford than
Ihoy did against LSU The Owls tightened their T-attack and ran
more. Stanford has altered their attack a little this year also. Be
sides the obvious fact of running the ball more, the flanker back is
between the spread end and the tackle, not outside the end as it was
last year - . But Rice's attack did seem to confuse Taylor's men some.
He admitted as much.
3. The Indians wore psychologically down. Why? Some say they
wore pointing ahead to YVSC; some say the heat, again; some say
injuries. The latter might have some merit, but the game was al
ready under way and Rice was running wild before Jack Douglas
was injured. And besides, the Big Red has vowed to win the remain
ing eight games and spirits on the team are high.
Stanford made a big mistake to kick off first and give Rice Iho
first opportunity to score. Coach Chuck's strategy worked fine in
the first two games and not a word was said.
5. It was a night game. Wo won the night game last year against
WSC, so night games are not the reason. In fact, Rice's stadium
i one of the best, if nol the best, lighted grid parks in the country.
(i. Rice was fired up to ihe hilt with the desire to win and "could
do no wrong." Couple this with Stanford's early game injuries to
key men and the sloppy performance of fundamentals tackling,
blocking and aggressiveness- and you have the ingredients for a
Rice win, Indian defeat.
Taylor said the Indians couldn't got their hands on the ball. A
team has to have a tackling and aggressive defense to accomplish
that. And Stanford didn't have it Saturday.
(iarber did his best to hold this team unity which has been the
cor nerstone of 1 his 1957 Big Rod Machine, but ho wasn't enough.

Rice might become a powerhouse of the Southwest Conference,
but most preseason prognosticators picked them no higher than
filth behind Texas A&M, Baylor, Arkansas and TCU. Cut on the
other hand, the Owls just might turn out fifth or lower. And it
would not be the first time that Stanford's early-season opponents,

of the conference.

by stopping J. C. Caroline with only 34 yards gained all day. Final

Writers started up the bandwagon. But when the smoke cleared
away the Cards had lost to Navy (25-0), UCLA (72-0), Washington

They did manage to recover from the UCLA massacre and down

Rice might become a powerhouse of the Southwest Conference,
but most preseason prognosticators picked them no higher than
filth behind Texas A&M, Baylor, Arkansas and TCU. Cut on the
other hand, the Owls just might turn out fifth or lower. And it
would not be the first time that Stanford's early-season opponents,
.•'gainst whom the Indians usually win, became eventual doormats
of the conference.
Remember 1954. It was that year when the fighting Illini came
West wiih a Big Ten "powerhouse." The Cards had defeated COP
t|,'M2) and Oregon (18-13) before going into the game. And it was
national TV. What happened? Stanford played the script brilliantly
by stopping J. C. Caroline with only 34 yards gained all day. Final
score: Stanford 12, Illinois 2.
Writers started up the bandwagon. But when the smoke cleared
away the Cards had lost to Navy (25-0), UCLA (72-0), Washington
Slate (30-26), USC (21-7), San Jose State (19-14) and Cal (28-20).
They did manage to recover from the UCLA massacre and down
Washington 13-7 for a 4-6 season record. And the Illini did equally
as bad in their neck of the woods.
This is not to say Rice will finish in the cellar, but it could hap
-1 en. Stanford could lose all of its seven remaining games. But they
won't. And they'll do better' than the predicted sixth in league play
IF Jackie Douglas is returned to full effectiveness. Not to leave
out the names of such men as Lou Valli, Gary Van Galder, Koch
< oriklin and -firir Byrer.
If I hey are ready to go Saturday, I'll pick Stanford fiver the
Cougars. But the Indians have their work cut out for them and it
won i be as easy as it. reads—-STOP THOSE WSC PASSES.
Why Did Rice Win?
Why did Rice beat Stanford?
Since that disastrous night in humid Houston, many Monday
morning quarterbacks have given their "expert" opinion on why
the Indians collapsed before the Rice Owls, 3-1-7. Some are i idiculous
and some have merit:
1. The weather was so humid that the Cards' defensive speed
was curtailed. It was just as sultry for Rice.
2. Rice used a slightly different offense against Stanford than
Ihoy did against LSU The Owls tightened their T-attack and ran
more. Stanford has altered their attack a little this year also. Be
sides the obvious fact of running the ball more, the flanker back is
between the spread end and the tackle, not outside the end as it was
last year - . But Rice's attack did seem to confuse Taylor's men some.
He admitted as much.
3. The Indians wore psychologically down. Why? Some say they
wore pointing ahead to YVSC; some say the heat, again; some say
injuries. The latter might have some merit, but the game was al
ready under way and Rice was running wild before Jack Douglas
was injured. And besides, the Big Red has vowed to win the remain
ing eight games and spirits on the team are high.
Stanford made a big mistake to kick off first and give Rice Iho
