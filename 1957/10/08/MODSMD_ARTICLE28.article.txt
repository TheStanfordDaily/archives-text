# Douglas Watches as Tribe Preps for Cougar Battle
## Stephen Breaks Hand, Out 5 Weeks; Concussion Hospitalizes Van Galder 
### Roy Lawson 
Quarterbacks Sid Garbor and
Bob Nioolel directed Stanford's
passing attack yeslerday while
first -si ring quarterback Jackie
Douglas watched from the side
linos as the Indians began drills
fur their Saturday afternoon PCC
opener against Washington State
College ai Stanford Siadiurn.
Douglas, who suff e r e d a
bruised back Saturday when the
Indians dropped a 34-7 decision
to Rice Institute, will be fitted
with a special pad to protect the
tender area, however, and prob
ably will be ready for the Cou
gars.
The Cardinals went through a
brisk pass scrimmage knowing
that co-captain and end Gary
Van Galder and fullback Lou
Valli will not be available for the
WSC game.
Van Galder Under Observation
Van Galder is being hold at
Palo Alto Hospital for observa
tion following the mild concus
sion he received in the Rice game
while Valli's strained left knee
a souvenir of the Northwestern
conflict —is not yet sound.
Adding to coach Chuck Tay
lor's woes is the fact that Chuck
Shea, the booming 6-2 fullback
who took over for Valli, has a
charley horse in his right thigh
to remember the liice lads from
Houston.
And to make his day complete,
Taylor learned last night that
Roy Stephen, the valuable senior
halfback from Fort Wayne, Ind..
has a broken bone in his left hand
and will bo shelved from four to

six weeks. Stephen was hurt in
yesterday's scrimmage.
On the positive side of the pic
ture, the Indians welcomed with
open arms fullback Jim Byrer
and center Roch Conklin back to
the fold yesterday. Byrer had a
lung injury and Conklin had a
broken right arm, but both are
primed for combat once more.
Tribe Views Rice Flicks
The Indians viewed the awful
truth last night when they
watched ihe game movies of the
! Rice - throwing episode. (Guess
I who w;is the bridesmaid!) Then
the Cards had a taste of the pass
minded Cougars via the cinema.
The Cougars, who operate from
the slot • T formation, boast a
strong passer in quarterback Bob
.Newman, a junior from the Bay
Area who has completed 27 of 51
jpasses for three touchdowns this
; season.
