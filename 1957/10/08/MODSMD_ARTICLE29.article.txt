# Los Angeles OK's Dodger Transfer
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (JP) The Los
Angeles Cily Council yesterday
gave official approval to the pro
posed transfer of the Brooklyn
Dodgers, thus clearing the way
for the Bums' long haul west.
A formal acceptance of the
transaction by Dodger president
Walter O'Malley is considered a
certainty.
The vote making the city a
party to a contract with the Dodg
ers was 10-4. The vigorous mi
nority that has clouded negotia
tions in the past few weeks re
fused to the end to climb on Iho
big league band wagon.
