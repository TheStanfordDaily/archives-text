terday, 1-0, for his second World
Series victory as the Milwaukee
Braves took a 3-2 edge at the end
of five game's.

cause of a severe hitting slump,
drove in the only run of ihe game,
in Ihe sixth, with a lino single tc
righi following singles by Eddie

Whitey Ford, matching Bur
dette pitch for pitch, had retired
two batters in the sixth before
trouble struck.
Coleman Waifs
Mathews, w hose lOth-inning
homer won Sunday's game for
the Braves, rolled a higher hoppei
tow a r d second-baseman Jerry
Coleman. The veteran Yankee
didn't charge the ball but waited
for the hop, and Mathews just
beat his throw to first base.
Aaron dunked a single into
short right field.that fell between
oneharging Hank Bauer and back
pedaling Coleman. With two out,
Mathews was running with the
hit. He easily reached third.

Adcock, who had bounced inlo
a double play last time up and
had only two Series hits in 11
previous at-bats, rammed Ford's
second pitch into right as Math
ews romped home.
Burdette, a 30-year-old right
hander who once worked for the
Yanks before he helped carry the
$50,000 to Boston for Johnny Sain
in 1951, didn't walk a man. He
struck out five, including the first
two batters in the ninth.
After that, Gil McDougald roll
ed a single into center field. Then
Burdette forced Yogi Berra to pop
to Mathews for the game-ending
out.
Burdette Mobbed
A grinning Burdette was virtu
ally mobbed by his eager males,
who rushed from the dugout en
masse to pump his hand and rub
his college-style crew cut.
The big crowd of 45.X1 l was
slow to leave, as though reluctant
to see the Milwaukee end of the
Series finished.
Both teams flew to New York
shortly after yesterday's game.
They will work-out today an off
day for travel purposes in the
Series schedule. The sixth game
will be played tomorrow at Yan
kee Stadium.
