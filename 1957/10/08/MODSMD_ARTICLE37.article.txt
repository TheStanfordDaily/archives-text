# INITIAL EXPOSURE
## Pre-Reg Activities Orientate New Students to Stanford 
### Diana Smith 
(Editor's note: This is the
first of a series of tour articles
on the Pre - Registration Com
mittee which welcomes fresh
man students to Stanford each
autumn quarter.)

Among the first abbreviations
learned by the newly arrived
Stanford freshman was "pre
reg," and although its memory
may now be slightly dimmed by
academic activity and social pur
suits, "pre-reg" will have left its
lasting imprint, as his initial ex
posure to this campus.
Since first proposed in the
spring of 1936 to better direct
the orientation of each incoming
freshman class, the Pre-Registra
tion Committee has expanded
from a mere handful to its pres
ent size of about 35 students from
all three upper classes. Last year
about 250 students tried out for
the committee, according to 1957
Chairman Tom Decker.
For the chairman, planning be
gins right after Christmas and it
involves the whole committee in
tensively during spring quarter.
Before summer vacation tempo
rarily disperses the group, most
of the coming program's innu
merable details have been ar
ranged.
Close and Congenial
The committee is always a
very close and congenial one, tra
dition shows. This year the group
arrived on campus Monday, Sept.
16, to have everything in readi
ness for the freshmen two days
later. Each separate event, as in
previous years, was the responsi
bility of one or two members,
with the rest of the committee
assisting.
The program opened Wednes
day, Sept. 18, welcoming and
moving in the new frosh. Cam
pus tours were held in the after
noon and the impressive Fresh
man Convocation.
Thursday brought an innova
tion in an instructional panel in
the Undergraduate Studies Pro
gram under the direction of Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Phil
ip H. Rhinelander.

Welcoming Speeches
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler and student leaders
spoke to the class in the after
noon, followed by faculty open
houses. After dinner, prominent
members of the faculty visited
the freshman dormitories for dis
cussion groups, another new fea
ture of this year's program.
Placement tests, co-recreation
activities and a picnic highlighted
Friday, and Saturday brought the
San Jose game and the famous
"Jolly-up."
After Freshman Sunday serv
ices at Memorial Church, all new
students met with their advisers
that afternoon.

cussion groups, another new fea
ture of this year's program.
Placement tests, co-recreation
activities and a picnic highlighted
Friday, and Saturday brought the
San Jose game and the famous
"Jolly-up."
After Freshman Sunday serv
ices at Memorial Church, all new
students met with their advisers
that afternoon.
(Editor's note: This is the
first of a series of tour articles
on the Pre - Registration Com
mittee which welcomes fresh
man students to Stanford each
autumn quarter.)

Among the first abbreviations
learned by the newly arrived
Stanford freshman was "pre
reg," and although its memory
may now be slightly dimmed by
academic activity and social pur
suits, "pre-reg" will have left its
lasting imprint, as his initial ex
posure to this campus.
Since first proposed in the
spring of 1936 to better direct
the orientation of each incoming
freshman class, the Pre-Registra
tion Committee has expanded
from a mere handful to its pres
ent size of about 35 students from
all three upper classes. Last year
about 250 students tried out for
the committee, according to 1957
Chairman Tom Decker.
For the chairman, planning be
gins right after Christmas and it
involves the whole committee in
tensively during spring quarter.
Before summer vacation tempo
rarily disperses the group, most
of the coming program's innu
merable details have been ar
ranged.
Close and Congenial
The committee is always a
very close and congenial one, tra
dition shows. This year the group
arrived on campus Monday, Sept.
16, to have everything in readi
ness for the freshmen two days
later. Each separate event, as in
previous years, was the responsi
bility of one or two members,
with the rest of the committee
assisting.
The program opened Wednes
day, Sept. 18, welcoming and
moving in the new frosh. Cam
pus tours were held in the after
noon and the impressive Fresh
man Convocation.
Thursday brought an innova
tion in an instructional panel in
the Undergraduate Studies Pro
gram under the direction of Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Phil
ip H. Rhinelander.

Welcoming Speeches
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler and student leaders
spoke to the class in the after
noon, followed by faculty open
houses. After dinner, prominent
members of the faculty visited
the freshman dormitories for dis
cussion groups, another new fea
ture of this year's program.
