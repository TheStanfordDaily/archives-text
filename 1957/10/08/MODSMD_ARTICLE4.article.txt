# Street Fighting Continues in Polish Capital
## 
### 
WARSAW (A 3 ) —Riot police
charged a crowd of whistling
youngsters outside the Warsaw
Palace of Culture last night. It
was the fifth straight night of
street fighting in this capital of
Communist Poland.
About 100 police scattered the
crowd with clubs after a teen-age
gang set fire to a wooden flower
kiosk.
Forty persons were reported
arrested.
Riot squad men with Alsatian
dogs stood guard at the intersec
tion of Jerozolomska and Mar
shalkowsha streets, a focal point
of the clashes.
Last night's crowd numbered
around 1000. It was smaller than
those of previous evenings and
contained a high proportion of the
rowdies the Poles call "chilgan
ski."
Press Campaign
Communist authorities whipped
up a press campaign demanding
severe sentences for the demon
strators.
"This army of stone-throwing
brawlers must be defeated and
the guilty ones arrested and
meted severe criminal punish
ment," said the youth newspaper
Sztandar Mlodych. "They should
be thrown out of work and school
and expelled from Warsaw."
Trybuna Ludu, the Communist
party newspaper, praised the mi
litiamen, who were denounced by
university students as "Gestapo"
when they helped riot police put
down a freedom demonstration
Friday night with clubs, noise
bombs and tear gas.
No totals of arrests or casual
ties have been issued. But offi
cial accounts said about 150 per
sons were detained Saturday
night, six students were still held
from Thursday's clash, and many
arrests were made Sunday night.
Haul Down Banner
Students finally hauled down a
freedom banner that had flown
for four days from a window of
their hostel. It carried two words
"Wolnosc Slowa" (free speech).
Two senior militia officers de
manded its removal Sunday. The
students refused then.
Explaining t.he i r change of
mind yesterday, they said they
decided not to give authorities any
excuse for attempting to remove
the banner by force.

WARSAW (A 3 ) —Riot police
charged a crowd of whistling
youngsters outside the Warsaw
Palace of Culture last night. It
was the fifth straight night of
street fighting in this capital of
Communist Poland.
About 100 police scattered the
crowd with clubs after a teen-age
gang set fire to a wooden flower
kiosk.
Forty persons were reported
arrested.
Riot squad men with Alsatian
dogs stood guard at the intersec
tion of Jerozolomska and Mar
shalkowsha streets, a focal point
of the clashes.
Last night's crowd numbered
around 1000. It was smaller than
those of previous evenings and
contained a high proportion of the
rowdies the Poles call "chilgan
ski."
Press Campaign
Communist authorities whipped
up a press campaign demanding
severe sentences for the demon
strators.
"This army of stone-throwing
brawlers must be defeated and
the guilty ones arrested and
meted severe criminal punish
ment," said the youth newspaper
Sztandar Mlodych. "They should
be thrown out of work and school
and expelled from Warsaw."
Trybuna Ludu, the Communist
party newspaper, praised the mi
litiamen, who were denounced by
university students as "Gestapo"
when they helped riot police put
down a freedom demonstration
Friday night with clubs, noise
bombs and tear gas.
No totals of arrests or casual
ties have been issued. But offi
cial accounts said about 150 per
sons were detained Saturday
night, six students were still held
from Thursday's clash, and many
arrests were made Sunday night.
Haul Down Banner
Students finally hauled down a
freedom banner that had flown
for four days from a window of
their hostel. It carried two words
"Wolnosc Slowa" (free speech).
Two senior militia officers de
manded its removal Sunday. The
students refused then.
Explaining t.he i r change of
mind yesterday, they said they
decided not to give authorities any
excuse for attempting to remove
the banner by force.
