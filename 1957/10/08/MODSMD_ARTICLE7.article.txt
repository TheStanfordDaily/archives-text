# Russ Satellite May Have Instruments, Caltech Head Says

LA CANADA (/P)—'The direc
tor of U.S. satellite trackers said
yesterday he believes that Rus
sian scientists may be asking
questions and getting answers
from their satellite as it circles
the earth.
Dr. William A. Pickering, head
of the California Institute of
Technology Jet Propulsion Labo
ratory here, said this may ex
plain the changes which have
been noted in signals from the
satellite.
He said in a news conference,
"My own feeling is that there is
some type of instrumentation
aboard.
"I could speculate that they
might have a device on the
ground and are asking it ques
tions once in a while—and get
ting back answers."
Dr. Pickering said it is doubt
ful that the Russians are pur
posely coding any information
which the satellite may be relay
ing.
"It is unfortunate to call it a
code," he said of the satellite's
signals. "What you have here is
the reading of some instruments.
You don't know what they are,
however, so you don't get any
thing very much out of it until
someone tells you what is being
measured."
