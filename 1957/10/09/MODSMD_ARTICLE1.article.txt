# Tuesday Speaker, Sokol, Says Austrians Firm U.S. Friends
## Ignorance, Not Haired, Causes Most European Criticism of Americans, Professor Declares 
### Barbarn Hicks 
"The Austrians are completely on our side, though they have
■doubts about American culture and actions toward Hungary," An
thony Sokol, professor of international security affairs in the Hoover
Institution, told a near-capacity Tuesday Evening Series audience in
Memorial Auditorium last night.
, Sokol, who taught international relations at the University of

Vienna last year on a Fulbright
award, captivated his audience for
nearly 75 minutes with explana
tions of Austrian feelings toward
the United States and with slides
of Austrian cities and countryside.
"The Austrians criticize Amer
icans, not through hatred, but be
cause of ignorance," the speaker
said, explaining that while teach
ing in Vienna he toured Austria,
lecturing on American culture and
illustrating American life with
slides.
Title Changed
"My most popular lecture was
entitled 'Does America Have Cul
ture?'," Sokol noted. "In some
areas American officials resented
this question and changed the
title to 'A Discussion of Culture.'
Attendance dropped considera
bly."
The Hungarian crisis is a popu
lar complaint against Americans,
the native Austrian said. Austri
ans compare their reception of
Hungarian refugees with that of
the United States, pointing out
that strong America received only
35,000 of 200,000 refugees.
"America is the land looked to
ward by Europeans and is like a
magnet," Sokol said. "But Aus
trians feel that American action
in Hungary always seemed to be
too little and too late, whereas
Austria rose to the occasion —
though they had little surplus of
material goods to offer and had
serious threat of Soviet repercus
sions.
Sokol listed the rules he used
in preparing his Austrian lectures
and recommends them to travel
ers in Europe:
Reconuncndations
• Praising America is overdone;
People become suspicious. The
American radio in Europe is guil
ty of this. Only the essential good
need be emphasized.
• Any good said about America
should be covered with a compli
ment about the host country.
• Similarities should be stress
ed as much as differences, even
though contrasts arc often more
interesting.
• Knowledge of the country is
necessary for anyone who wants
to make a favorable impression.
Know about the contributions of
the country to human civilization.
"Popular European misconcep
tions about America are that
Americans are uncultured, mate
rialistic. unsocial, arrogant and
aloof," the traveler said.
Meanings Differ
Sokol explained the first idea
by pointing to differences in the
meaning of "culture," but, he said,
even in the European sense of
culture, ours is more widely
spread than they think.
He countered the idea of ma
terialism by noting that "a wave
of materialism is sweeping Eu
rope and Asia which is worse than
we have."
Sokol said that Americans are
believed to be unsocial because,
even though they may be living
in a country for some time, they
generally fail to learn the lan
guage.


ON NATIVE LAND —Austrian-born Anthony Sokol, professor in
the Hoover Institution, outlined his native land's views on America
and American!-.' in the second Tuesday Evening Series program of
(lie autumn quarter last night in Memorial Auditorium. Sokol
explained popular European misconceptions of the United States,
and illustrated his lecture with slides taken during his residence
there in 1956-57 as a Fulbright professor in the University of
Vienna.
