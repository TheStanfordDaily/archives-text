# Scientists of SRI Work to Establish Orbit of Satellite
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute is
leading the field of research insti
tutes all over the country in es
tablishing the orbit of (he Rus
sian satellite, "Sputnik," accord
ing to Von Russel Eshleman, re
search associate of Stanford Elec
tronics Laboratories.
SRl's means of tracking the
orbit of the satellite have thus far
been confined to use of the Dop
pler effect, the physics principle
illustrated by the dying sound of
a train whistle as it goes past,
Eshleman explained.
Stanford scientists are trying to
get radio reflections from the sat
ellite by bouncing radio waves off
of it and picking them up with
the antenna near the Isolation
Hospital.
Can't Find It
As yet, the photographic equip
ment in the United States has not
been able to find Sputnik, because
the satellite has been over this
country at the wrong time of day.
To be photographed, the baby
moon must be visible at dawn or
dusk, when the sun's rays from
below the horizon reflect off the
surface of the satellite.
Local news reports have stated
that two hunters near Ketchikan,
Alaska, saw a dark red object rise
from the western horizon Thurs
day night. Ray Leadabrand of
SRI said he thought the object
"was probably the third stage of
the rocket that is now following
the satellite," because the rocket
would then be visible in Alaska.
Antennae Unused
The radar antennae near Stan
ford haven't been used thus far
because the orbit of the satellite
hasn't been established specifical
ly. The only means of locating
Sputnik has been the type of radio
receivers that most "ham" radio
operators use.
Scientists are unwilling to pre
dict tho length of the satellite's
stay in space, but they will know
when it begins to return to earth.
The present revolving time is 96.2
minutes. If this time shortens,
scientists will know that the satel
lite is getting closer to earth and
will soon enter the earth's atmos
phere.
