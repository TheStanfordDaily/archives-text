# IIR Will Hold Social Hour; Officers to Tell Year's Plans At Bowman House Today
## Club's 11-Year History Reveals Evolution to Complex Organization 
### Helen Guerrant 
The Institute of International Relations (IIR) officially begins its
year this afternoon with an open house at 4 in Bowman Alumni
House to which ail students are invited. Here, each officer will ex
plain his department and tell of plans for the year.
lIR is the center of all of Stanford's international activities, and

membership is given automati
cally to every student.
The Institute was organized in
the spring of 1946 when a group
of veterans petitioned for the es
tablishment of a student organi
zation that would create more
student interest and understand
ing in international issues, which
were especially disrupted at that
time, less than a year after the
end of World War II.
The main aims of the Institute
are to keep the students in touch
with cultural, economic and po
litical aspects of international
life. Thus, the organization is di
vided into several branches, each
focusing on a different phase of
foreign affairs.
Conference Department
Students who like politics and
government will be especially in
terested in the Conference De
partment. Activities of this divi
sion revolve around the world's
political problems which are re
searched and then debated in fo
rums and conferences held both
here and on other campuses.
The Conference Division also
trains Stanford's delegation to
the Model United Nations as well
as organizing an annual confer
ence for high school students
from all of Northern California.
Education Division
Another area of service in the
I1R is covered by the Education
Division. Under this are three
sub-departments: Stanford Over
seas Information Service, Stan
ford Information and Aid Service,
and Affiliations Department.
The educational branch helps
to organize annual student ex
changes. Each year a Stanford
student is exchanged with one in
Berlin, and another with a stu
dent from Tokyo. In addition,
supplementing exchanges of
books and current news reports
are collected by the Educational
Division and mailed to these stu
dents.
Relations Promoted
Stanford International. Relief
Organization, SIRO, promotes in
ternational student-to-student re
lations by sending money, books
and clothes to hundreds of
groups abroad.
The International Club is the
social division of the organiza
tion, made of both foreign and
American students at Stanford.
Its yearly projects include an In
ternational Cabaret dinner and a
Foreign Students' Talent Show.
