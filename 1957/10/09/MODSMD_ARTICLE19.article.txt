A Shocked Protest
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to register a shocked protest
and express our disgust with the behavior of the
audience at the recent Sunday evening movie.
When we entered Mem Aud we both were over
whelmed at the apparent cultural interest and
activity of the student body in attending one of
the great motion pictures of all time, "Citizen
Kane." It was soon made clear, however, that
they had come to mock, not to pray. With the
exception of a Saturday neighborhood matinee,
we have never seen such rude, childish and boor
ish behavior. Whistles (toys and natural), har
monicas, cheers, hisses, boos, popping of mouths,
prolonged applause at completely inappropriate
places, and the shouting of witty (?) remarksâ€”
all seemed amusing to most of those assembled.
It was a revolting display of bad manners at best
and a nauseating symptom of what can only be
called a cultural aridity on this campus.
Since it would be impractical to construct a
soundproof viewing room to contain the cries of
unruly brats, may we suggest that there be two
shows on Sunday nights? The latter one for re
sponsible, considerate and interested viewers; the
earlier one for the imbecilic, arrogant hooligans
who seem lo creep out of hiding on Sunday night.

Mature, Intelligent People?
Editor, The Daily:
As a newcomer to Ihe Farm, my impression
was that this was a university comprised of
mature, intelligent people. But such an episode
as took place in Memorial TTall Sunday night does
not present a pretty picture to serious thinking
individuals, particularly those here in America

from foreign lands. It is no credit to Stanford
that the student body is content to put up with
such a weekly fiasco.
1 refer to the showing of "Citizen Kane." It
was a circus hardly worth the 20 cents admission
price. Orson Welles was in constant competition
with multitudes of clowns with their loud clap
ping, tin whistles, door bell buzzers, catcalls and
even battery-operated automobile horns. These
sound effects, needless to say, did not blend too
well with the movie's sound track, and ruined an
excellent performance for those there to watch
the movie.
Certainly, if there must be a circus, it would be
better to hold it elsewhere- say, the Pavilion. For
the same price, Ihere could be lots of Bugs Bunny
with noisemakers provided for those with talents
along this line. Then it would be possible to enjoy
the Flicks in peace.

Timely Editorial
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial entitled "It's Your Tuesday Se
ries" is greatly appreciated by those who are
trying to work up more student interest in the
Tuesday lectures. The ASSU has been concerned
both with the degree of appeal of the Series and
with student apathy, so the article was certainly
timely. We wish to thank you and the aulhor
very much indeed.

1 have canceled my subscription to ihe Chron
icle for idiotic reasons and am very pleased with
The Stanford Daily as a much superior substitute.
