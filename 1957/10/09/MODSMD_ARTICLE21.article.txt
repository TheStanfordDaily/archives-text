(Editor's Note: This is the
second in a series of four arti
cles on the Pre • Registration
Committee, which welcomes
freshman students to Stanford
each autumn quarter.)

Sophomore membership on the
Pre-Registration Committee and
sponsoring at Wilbur Hall last
year prepared Tom Decker, a sen
ior majoring in economics, for the
chairmanship of the 1957 Pre-Reg
Com.
Decker said he began planning
last winter on the basis of the
essentials of this fall's program:
moving in the frosh, the San Jose
game, the placement tests and
preparation of the freshmen for
registration.
The great" problem in planning
every pre-reg program, according
to Decker, is to orient the fresh
men without completely exhaust
ing them. The campus tours, crit
icized in the past as being too long
and tiring, were considered a pos
sible candidate for omission from
this year's schedule.
The committee finally decided
to include the tours, after reduc
ing the number of stops from 10
to eight and setting a limit of 20
people to a group. Each group
this fall completed the lour in
about one hour, making the tours
a feasible as well as valuable part
of the program.
When asked what he considered
the highlights of this year's pro
gram, Decker said: "There wasn't
anything that seemed particularly
outstanding. Everything went
very smoothly, thanks to all the
people working." He conceives of
pre-reg as an integrated program
rather than a series of featured
events.
Decker especially commented
upon ihe role of the sponsors,
"The underlying thing that makes
: pre-reg work is sponsor eoopera
i tion." The committee plans the
program, but its timing and effec
tiveness must depend, in large
i measure, on the atmosphere set
| by ihe sponsors.
Additions to past formats this
year included discussion groups
led by prominent members of the
faculty in the freshman dormito
ries and the instruction panel in
the Undergraduate Studies Pro
gram under the direction of dean
; of humanities and sciences Philip
H. Rhinelander.
Decker stressed that Pre-Reg is
a most rewarding and enjoyable
: committee on which to work, and
one whose work is finished before
the pressure of classes and ac
tivities.

year included discussion groups
led by prominent members of the
faculty in the freshman dormito
ries and the instruction panel in
the Undergraduate Studies Pro
gram under the direction of dean
; of humanities and sciences Philip
H. Rhinelander.
Decker stressed that Pre-Reg is
a most rewarding and enjoyable
: committee on which to work, and
one whose work is finished before
the pressure of classes and ac
tivities.
(Editor's Note: This is the
second in a series of four arti
cles on the Pre • Registration
Committee, which welcomes
freshman students to Stanford
each autumn quarter.)

Sophomore membership on the
Pre-Registration Committee and
sponsoring at Wilbur Hall last
year prepared Tom Decker, a sen
ior majoring in economics, for the
chairmanship of the 1957 Pre-Reg
Com.
Decker said he began planning
last winter on the basis of the
essentials of this fall's program:
moving in the frosh, the San Jose
game, the placement tests and
preparation of the freshmen for
registration.
The great" problem in planning
every pre-reg program, according
to Decker, is to orient the fresh
men without completely exhaust
ing them. The campus tours, crit
icized in the past as being too long
and tiring, were considered a pos
sible candidate for omission from
this year's schedule.
The committee finally decided
to include the tours, after reduc
ing the number of stops from 10
to eight and setting a limit of 20
people to a group. Each group
this fall completed the lour in
about one hour, making the tours
a feasible as well as valuable part
of the program.
When asked what he considered
the highlights of this year's pro
gram, Decker said: "There wasn't
anything that seemed particularly
outstanding. Everything went
very smoothly, thanks to all the
people working." He conceives of
pre-reg as an integrated program
rather than a series of featured
events.
Decker especially commented
upon ihe role of the sponsors,
"The underlying thing that makes
: pre-reg work is sponsor eoopera
i tion." The committee plans the
program, but its timing and effec
tiveness must depend, in large
i measure, on the atmosphere set
| by ihe sponsors.
Additions to past formats this
year included discussion groups
