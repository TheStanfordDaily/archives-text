The Trip lo Houston â€”Pari I
BACK IIOMF AGAIN By now the sad news of last weekend has
had a chance to mellow, and we can again reflect without causing
100 much pain. Only this time, let's not discuss football, but rather
a football trip.
Jt was this writer's good fortune and pleasure to make the Hous
-lon trip with the Indians, and it was that trip that prompted my
current train of thought: that since a trip of this sort has never been
written of in detail, it might make interesting copy.
If nothing else, is may serve to dispel feelings that these trips are
glorious guided tours of many parts of our land, and that it's a grand
way to fjet away from school for a few days.
SO LET'S ITINERARY-IZE:
It was about 10:40 on Friday morning by the time the team
finally had assembled at training quarters and begun to load on
the two Greyhound buses provided for their trip to San Francisco
International Airport. And after compiling the necessary equip
ment, salt tablets and air-sick pills, the squad was off.
Another "gathering" session took place at the airport; the gather
ing of press and other dignitaries scheduled to make the trip with
us. And among ihe gatherers was one very famous Chief Lightfoot,
all bedecked in special traveling costume, a sight which amusingly
confused those spectators who stopped to watch proceedings.
FLIGHT IS CALLED: 'Twas a United Airlines chartered flight
(No. 5614) that took the Indians along their warpatch. Upon board
ing, the team was met by two charming hostesses, naturally wearing
big white chrysanthemums upon which were emblazoned big red
S's. And the funny part about it all both the girls were from
Houston.
Once on the plane it wasn't long before the In juns produced very
common objects, locally at least books. And they studied, too.
More than I, I must admit. But between sessions at the texts, ihe
squad studied another sort of book scouting reports about the Rice
()wls.
COMES LUNCIITIME: Football players have large appetites, 1
am Jed lo believe. And so provisions are made to feed them. But the
United provider slightly underestimated the capacity of ihe Stanford
crew, for one and a half sandwiches leave a lot of stomach space lo
be accounted for. And no matter how attractively they are served,
you can't fill up on beauty when ii takes the form of napkins and
trays.
REST TIME: Rest your weary heads, and feet . . . with United
Airlines slippersox. These unusual looking things brought a degree
of laughter from the team. But the most entertaining was the sur
prised, amused smile of Coach Chuck Taylor when presented with
his pair.
Karbee Reads "Jack and Jill"?
Also amusing, and coincidental, was the football story Troy
Barbee found in a "Jack and Jill" magazine. Seems a learn known
as the Indians was having its BIG GAME. They were from Baxter
College and were playing Slate U. Now Baxter had a statue of an
Indian chief on its campus and tradition said lhat ihe team in pos
session of Ihe statue would win the game.
So the State boys stole Ihe Indian, but goodness won out, I guess,
and Baxter won the game, anyway; by one point, mind you. So who
cares if CaJ has the Axe?
Back in the Skylounge some of Ihe brave warriors ventured inlo
a game <<| gin, while spotted here and there were more books. Even
to hrie Piotiva's copy of "Thirty Days to ;i More Powerful Vocabu
lary." (He's on the sixth lesson, or was.)
MORE FOOD: The sandwiches weren't enough, and the steak
looked good, bul the consensus was that it, too, was small. But the
meal served shortly before landing in Houston was a good one:
Dtingeness crabmeal; Louis Wafers (crackers); filet mignon, Col
bert (he's United's Chef); buttered siring beans; cream whipped
potatoes; a whole wheat roll; chef salad victor, parisienne dressing;
strawberry shortcake; and cows full of milk, of course.
And all this while Chief Lightfoot. was confronted by a problem,
a real problem. Seems the Chief wanted to get autographs of ihe
37 tribesmen on a copy of ihe dinner menu. Things weni along fine
at first he had gotten quite a few shortly after Ihe plane took off.
Then carne the problem. You can't make a team stay put, and
once the group began to sleep, change places and generally mingle
the Chief was lost. Only seven names to go, but too embarrassed lo
ask each person if he had already signed the menu, and not quite
familiar enough with everybody, by face, to know who had and who
hadn't. But I think he eventually made out all right, and he sure had
no problem once we downed in Houston, but we'll save that until
tomorrow.
