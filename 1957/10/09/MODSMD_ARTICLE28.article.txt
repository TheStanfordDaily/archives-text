NEW YORK (>P) — The New

Braves should he glad the World
Series has no more than two
games left to go. The hospital
list is growing at such an alarm
ing rate it may soon rival the
eligibility list.
Two more athletes — pitchers
Warren Spahn of the Braves and
Johnny Kucks of the Yankees—
were added to the sick list today
1o increase the lotal of incapaci
tated to five. The others are, of
course, Mickey Mantle and Bill

Skowron of the Yankees and Red
Schoendienst of the Braves.
Spahn, who is almost certain to
be manager Fred Haney's choice
to pitch the seventh game Thurs
day, if the Braves fail to clinch
the world championship today,
took to bod at his hotel with a
i sore throat and slight tempera
ture. Spahn already has pitched
two games for Milwaukee, losing
the opener, 3-1. and winning the
fourth game. 7-5.
Kucks, who hurled two-thirds
of an inning in relief in Sunday's
loss to the Braves, was stricken
with what is believed to be the
I flu. He was taken to a hospital,
where a diagnosis was being made
I to determine the nature of the
! malady.
