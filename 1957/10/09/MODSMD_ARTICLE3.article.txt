# STATE DEPARTMENT VISIT
## Many Reds in Finland? Foreign Diplomat Says In Interview at Farm 
### John Lane 
Finland cannot accept economic aid from either the United States
or the Soviet Union, because of the Finnish political situation, Dr.
Tuure J. Junnila said yesterday on his visit to Hoover Institution
and the Stanford campus.
Dr. Junnila, Conservative member of the Finnish Parliament since

1951 and finance minister in 1953,
is visiting the United States under
State Department sponsorship,
studying banking and financing
techniques. He is vice president
and member of the board of direc
tors of Finland's largest bank, as
well as author, lecturer and some
time university professor.
"The Communists in Finland
now get about 27 per cent of the
vote in a general election," he
said. That, as well as Finland's
proximity to the Soviet Union —
which annexed territory from Fin
land as a result of the Russo-Fin
nish War —makes the political sit
uation such that Finland must
pursue her own economic develop
ment without outside help.
Good Will
Dr. Junnila said the Finns have
a great deal of good will toward
the United States; he emphasized
that he spoke principally of the
73 per cent of the population that
is not Communist.
This good will is a result of fac
tors starting with Finnish grati
tude for Herbert Hoover's relief
mission at the end of World War
I, he said.
The great number of Finnish
immigrants who have contributed
to American life also help create
the feeling of friendship, as did
the sending of CARE packages to
Finland at the end of World War
11, Dr. Junnila said.
Visited Before
Dr. Junnila visited the United
States once before, in 1950. He
feels that economic or political
conditions in the country have not
changed much sincc then.
"The New York subways cost
only 10 cents in 1950, though," he
said, "and now, this time, they
were 15 cents. That kind of thing
has been happening, I think, in
this country. There is also strong
inflation in Finland.
"However," he added, "the Fin
nish standard of living, while not
half so high as yours here, is
growing all the time and is now
much higher than at the end of
the war. This is also the way we
are fighting the Communist hold
on this third of our country.
"Reds Not Gaining"
"As regards the Communists, it
appears that in the United States
they are not gaining at all, and
that any fear of Communist pow
er grabs here is pretty unfound
ed."
He sees the principal differences
between American and Finnish
university life in there being no
living quarters at: such state uni
versities as the University of Hel
sinki, at which he received his
doctorate.
Dr. Junnila also emphasized
that Finnish universities cannot
get as much financial backing
from private sources as can such
institutions as Stanford, and said
that, particularly in the sciences,
Finnish universities very much
need state help.

"The New York subways cost
only 10 cents in 1950, though," he
said, "and now, this time, they
were 15 cents. That kind of thing
has been happening, I think, in
this country. There is also strong
inflation in Finland.
"However," he added, "the Fin
nish standard of living, while not
half so high as yours here, is
growing all the time and is now
much higher than at the end of
the war. This is also the way we
are fighting the Communist hold
on this third of our country.
"Reds Not Gaining"
"As regards the Communists, it
appears that in the United States
they are not gaining at all, and
that any fear of Communist pow
er grabs here is pretty unfound
ed."
He sees the principal differences
between American and Finnish
university life in there being no
living quarters at: such state uni
versities as the University of Hel
sinki, at which he received his
doctorate.
Dr. Junnila also emphasized
that Finnish universities cannot
get as much financial backing
from private sources as can such
institutions as Stanford, and said
that, particularly in the sciences,
Finnish universities very much
need state help.
Finland cannot accept economic aid from either the United States
or the Soviet Union, because of the Finnish political situation, Dr.
Tuure J. Junnila said yesterday on his visit to Hoover Institution
and the Stanford campus.
Dr. Junnila, Conservative member of the Finnish Parliament since

1951 and finance minister in 1953,
is visiting the United States under
State Department sponsorship,
studying banking and financing
techniques. He is vice president
and member of the board of direc
tors of Finland's largest bank, as
well as author, lecturer and some
time university professor.
"The Communists in Finland
now get about 27 per cent of the
vote in a general election," he
said. That, as well as Finland's
proximity to the Soviet Union —
which annexed territory from Fin
land as a result of the Russo-Fin
nish War —makes the political sit
uation such that Finland must
pursue her own economic develop
ment without outside help.
Good Will
Dr. Junnila said the Finns have
a great deal of good will toward
the United States; he emphasized
that he spoke principally of the
73 per cent of the population that
is not Communist.
This good will is a result of fac
tors starting with Finnish grati
tude for Herbert Hoover's relief
mission at the end of World War
I, he said.
The great number of Finnish
immigrants who have contributed
to American life also help create
the feeling of friendship, as did
the sending of CARE packages to
Finland at the end of World War
11, Dr. Junnila said.
Visited Before
Dr. Junnila visited the United
States once before, in 1950. He
feels that economic or political
conditions in the country have not
changed much sincc then.
