# Cardinals Hold Practice Under Lights; Taylor to Stress Defense Tactics Today
## 
### 
The Stanford Indians practiced under the lights for the first time this season yesterday, but it was
more the effect of Pacific Standard Time than respect for their Saturday opening PCC opponent,
Washington State College, that motivated the procedure.
Coach Chuck Taylor hustled his injury-racked Cardinals through a lengthy pass scrimmage as the
Indians set defenses for the potent Cougar aerial offense and then readied their own passing game.

Satisfied with the drill, Taylor j
happily revealed that fullback <
Chuck Shea and fullback - half-1
back Rick McMiilen will run at
top speed today when emphasis
is placed upon defense.
Shea had suffered a charley
horse in his right thigh against
the merry men of Jess Neely's
forest of point-producers last Sat
urday when the Indians lost to
Rice Institute, 34-7, while McMii
len had a bruised leg.
End Gary Van Galder, the co
captain who incurred a concus
sion against Rice, was declared
definitely unavailable for the
WSC game by Taylor last night, i
Taylor also opined that fullback |
Lou Valli—knee victim against [
Northwestern—is a very doubt- j
ful participant Saturday.
Test Canvas- Bags
The Indians will test their de- |
fense for the Cougars against the
canvas bags this afternoon. Par
amount in Stanford's hopes to
topple one of the four eligible
PCC Rose Bowl contenders is a
hard-rushing line to cripple the
skyliner that has brought WSC
six of its nine touchdowns this
season.
Meanwhile in Pullman, Wash.,
yesterday, coach Jim Sutherland
had quarterbacks Bob Newman
and Bunny Aldrich pitching to
ends Don Ellingsen, Jack Fan
ning and Gail Cogdill as Ihe Cou
gars primed their slot-T forma
tion attack for the Indians.
Newman, the standout junior
from El Cerrito, has completed
27 of 51 passes for three touch
downs this season while Aldrich
has hit 10 of l. r > attempts for
three scores.
Newman Top Passer
Although the Indians bombed
WSC, 40-2G, last season, it cer
tainly wasn't Newman's fault. He
threw a .'l4-yard TO pass and set
up Iwo more scores with aerials.
The Cougars boast strong run
ning strength in fullbacks Ed
Stevens and Chuck Morrell, the
PCC's fourth leading ball-packer ,
last year.
In addition 1o Ihe nation's I
most devastating passing at
tacks, Washington State has
strengthened the defense that
last year gave away 24.7 points
to every Hi.3 tallies it could ag
gregate.
Lead WSC Runners
Paving the way for the Cougar
ball-toters are 215 -pound left
guard Angelo Brovelli and right j
tackle Dan Verhey, a 220-pound- !
er. Brovelli is an All-American
junior college transfer from Glen
dale JC.
Washington State's won - lost
record to elate parallels Stanford's
-2-1-0 mark. The Cougars downed
Nebraska, 34-13, in their opener,
and tripped California, 13-7. Last
week they fell to flu • stricken i
lowa, 20-13.
