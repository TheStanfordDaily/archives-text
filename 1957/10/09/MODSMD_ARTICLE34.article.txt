## Pin-up Girls, Date Galleries Were Froshbook Beginnings 
### 
King! Ring! There goes the
telephone. Whoosh! An excited
freshman girl goes dashing down
the hall to answer it. Who is it?
She doesn't know.
It's a blind date. Should she
go? She wonders. She has the
answer. She dashes back to her
room, looks in her Froshbook, de
cides ho looks fine, and says yes.
This is just one use of Frosh
books, which may be ordered by
Wilbur and Branner residents
today in the Wilbur lobby and
by Roble girls and off-campus
men at Roble tomorrow and Fri
day. Pictures of frosh are also
being taken at this time, with or
without appointments.
Froshbooks originated at Stan
ford in the middle of the '40's as
a money-making project. Several
frosh men took pictures of their
female friends and hung these
pictures in their rooms. A 10-cent
admission charge was required of
less enterprising classmates who
wished to see the "campus love
lies."
The owners of this date gallery
soon found that they were losing
friends through their project. Up
perclassmen were upset because
of the advantage frosh men had
with frosh girls. Girls were com
plaining that they, too, should be
able to view their blind dates
ahead of time.
Just as the money-makers were
about to tear up their pictures,
one of them decided to go into the

Quad office and offer them the
idea. Since frosh pictures had to
be taken for the Quad anyway,
the yearbook staff decided to pub
lish a book of all these snaps—
and thus the Froshbook came into
being.
