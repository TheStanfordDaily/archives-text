# What's Doing... at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in the field of Combustion
## 
### 
Historically, the process of combustion
lias excited man's insatiable hunger for
knowledge. Since his most primitive at
tempts to harness this phenomenon, he
has been tremendously fascinated by its
potentials . . . perhaps never more so
than today with respect to the use of
combustion principles in the modern
aircraft engine.
Theorems of many sciences arc being
applied to the design and development
of high heat release rate devices at
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft In the realm
of aerodynamics alone, one of many
airflow problems that exist in combus
tion work is diffuser design for ad
vanced powerplants.
• In spite of the apparent simplicity of
a combustion system, the bringing to-

- gether of fuel anrl air in proper propor
tions, the ignition of the mixture, and
the rapid mixing of burned and un
burned gases involves a most complex
series of interrelated events occurring
simultaneously in time and space.
Fuel injection systems which prop
erly atomize and distribute under all
flight conditions are a continuing chal
lenge. In later stages of powcrplant de
velopment, various combustion prob
lems may be encountered which can
be studied and resolved through the
highly advanced facilities of P & W A's
YVillgoos Turbine Laboratory.
Although the combustion engineer
draws on many fields of science (in
cluding thermodynamics, aerodynamics,
fluid mechanics, heat transfer, applied

mechanics, metallurgy and chemistry),
the design of combustion systems has
not yet been reduced to really scientific
principles. The highly successful per
formance of engines like the J-57, J-75
and others stands as a tribute to the
vision, imagination and pioneering ef
forts of those at Pratt & Whitney Air
craft engaged in combustion work. :
j
While combustion assignments in
volve a diversity of engineering talent,
this field is only one of a broadly diver
sified engineering program at Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft. That program—with
other far-reaching activities in the fields
of materials problems, mechanical de
sign, instrumentation and aenxlynamics
— spells out a gratifying future for
many of today's engineering studenta.
