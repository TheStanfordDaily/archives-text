## Russian Leader Says Bombers and Fighters No Match for Missiles 
### 
MOSCOW (/P)—Nikita Khrush
chev said yesterday manned war
planes are no match for Russia's
intercontinental ballistic missile—
"the age of bombers is over.
"They might as well put bomb
ers and fighters in the museums,"
he commented, citing Soviet sci
entific achievements.
"Our intercontinental ballistic
rocket shows that it is no good
sending humanly controlled ma
chines against missiles."
The Communist party chief's
words were reported by two Brit
ish members of Parliament who
talked with him 80 minutes.
"It Is Dangerous"
They quoted Khrushchev say
ing "it is dangerous" for the Unit
ed States to take the view it is
dealing with a peasant country.
Asserting that the ICBM missile
has ma d e warplanes obsolete,
Khrushchev said:
"This all points to the fact that
we have even more things up our
sleeves. You can't send human
flesh and blood to fight things
like that."
At an East German embassy
banquet Monday night Khrush
chev voiced a warning to Turkey.
He told the banquet he had re
liable information that Turkey
had massed strong forces on the
Syrian border.
Frontiers Left Bare
"Turkish leaders have not been
very sensible," lie said. "They
have concentrated so many Turk
ish forces against Syria that they
have left their frontiers with us
almost bare.
"They had better have a good
think about this. When cannon
start to shoot and rockets to fly,
it may be too late."
There must be no war, he said
— not even local ones, because
they will be difficult to contain.
"Rockets are terrible and piti
less weapons and impose heavy
responsibility on those who pos
sess them," he observed. "We, on
our part, do everything not to
permit war. Our policy is clear."
