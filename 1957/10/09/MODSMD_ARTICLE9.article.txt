## Sputnik Silent for Six Hours; Signals Heard Again by Navy 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —Radio signals from the Russian earth satel
lite began coming in again late last night after being silenced for
about six hours.
The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said the signals, which faded
at 4 p.m. EDT, began coming in strong at 10 p.m. and were still being

heard after midnight.
The laboratory said the signals
were the same kind of beeps that
had fascinated scientists and ra
dio listeners since the baby moon
began whizzing around the earth
in outer space last Friday.
Unaccountable
A laboratory spokesman said
there was no way to account for
the interruption in signals.
At the same time a Navy
spokesman conceded the batter
ies might be recharging or even
that radio transmissions might
have been cut off by Russian sci
entists directing the historic ex
periment.
The Navy's loss of tho satel
lite's radio signal followed re
ports from listening stations in
other parts of the world that the
speeding sphere had quit beep
ing.
Moscow Report
A Moscow radio report picked
up in London acknowledged that
signals from the satellite may
stop due to exhaustion of its bat
teries. But it announced observa
tions will continue "with the aid
of optical instruments and radio
locating stations."
Professor A. A. Blagonravov, a
Soviet scientist visiting Washing
ton. said last Saturday lie
thought the batteries would last
more than two weeks.
The Navy's Minitrack head
quarters sent a message to all
ships and stations requesting con
tinued monitoring for a 12-hour
period.
Scientific Speculation
Changes in the eerie voice of
Sputnik, as the Russians call
their man-made moon, led to
widespread scientific speculation.
Dr. Hans Karl Pact /.old, a lead
ing German scientist, said the
speeding sphere appeared to be
losing altitude and might strike
the earth's denser atmosphere
within hours and burn up.


SPUTNIK WAS HERE —Like Kilroy, Sputnik also left his calling
card on chart recordings made Monday by Andrew B. Ledwith,
electronic research technician of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory at Cambridge, Mavs. Ledwith picked up the "beep
beep" signal from the tiny moon us it passed near Boston by using
antennae hastily installed on the observatory roof.
