"If ycu would have peace,
prepare for war." So said the
Romans. And so says the
U.S. Government: "We will
achieve peace through
Strength by negotiating from
Strength."
Now the Russians have
A- and H-bombs, the ICBM
and the first satellite. Yet
many Americans seem un
happy and upset.
But why?
The Russians must want
peace because they are pre
pared for war. Being pre
pared for war, peace must
result.
They have Strength, so
peace must result, since now
they will negotiate from
Strength.
Americans should be
pleased, for imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery.
And the Russians have imi
tated us so well that they
built the ICBM and satel
lite first! Obviously our fears
are misplaced, since they so
mirror us—
And we all want peace.
Peace, it's wonderful.
