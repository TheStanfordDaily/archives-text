Saund of California (whose East
Indian ancestry was the greatest
argument for his election), the
British Consul to Tanganyika,
and the director of the Arab na
tions' public information bureau
in the United States.

Stuart Pollak heads the Con
ference Division. He said the new
plans include the Consular Talks
in Bowman on alternate Thurs
days; the sponsorship of the an
nual high school United Nations
Conference; a radio program
with speakers and discussions;
and a panel of American and for
eign students.

his division is broken down into
the Affiliations and UN Educa
tion departments, the Stanford
Overseas Information Service
and the Stanford International
Relief Organization.

lin. It hopes to extend the affili
ation to a Polish university and
the University of Madrid.

hopes to undertake. The Insti

sponsibility for these problems.
High Regard
The reason the lIR feels com
petent to do this, as Dr. James
Watkins, head of the Political Sci
ence Department and the llR's
faculty adviser, later emphasized,
is due to the high regard in which
Stanford' sIIR is held by both the
U.S. State Department and the
United Nations.
Students interested in this as
pect of the lIR will meet Monday
afternoons, Barnes said, with lIR
political specialists to discuss
drafts of the statements.
Experts Scheduled
Barnes added that the lIR is
trying to schedule foreign policy
experts such as George Kennan
to speak before the group.
During United Nations Week,
Oct. 20-26, the lIR expects to have
such men as Representative D. S.
Saund of California (whose East
Indian ancestry was the greatest
argument for his election), the
British Consul to Tanganyika,
and the director of the Arab na
tions' public information bureau
in the United States.
