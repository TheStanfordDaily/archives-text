# PUBLIC RELATIONS HOARD
## ‘Publicity Package’ Designed For Campus Organizations 
### 
The Public Relations Board is offering a new service this quarter
to all ASSU organizations. This innovation is labeled "Publicity
Package," and through it the Pub Rel Board will plan and carry out
the complete publicity campaign of any function.
Clients who.wish to have their campaigns carried out in a "Pub-

licity Package" will talk to an ex
ecutive in the Pub Rel office
about costs and about what the
client desires. The board is non
profit, and the cost to the client
will never be more than the cost
of materials.
The executive will talk to the
planning board and then carry
out the campaign with the help
of a staff of 30. The staff is di
vided into groups which distrib
ute, do art work or create special
effects.
The Pub Rel Board will also
continue its previous service ac
tivities. It keeps materials in the
Pub Rel office to be sold or
loaned to ASSU organizations
which like to carry on their own
campaigns. Some of the mate
rials they keep on hand are silk
screen, posterboard, ditto equip
ment and card tables.
Another continuing service of
the board is to regulate the place
ment of posters and banners.
Space and the length of time of
use for banners and posters in
front of Union Court must lie
contracted for at the Pub Rel of
fice, as well as space in the glass
cases in front of the Cellar and
in the Engineering Corner dis
plays.
Some of the campaigns the Pub
Rel Board has already taken over
through the "Publicity Package"
are publicity for the Reg Dance
and the selling of Movie Discount
Cards. With the "Publicity Pack
age" service, the profit of the
Reg Dance was $100 more than
last year.
