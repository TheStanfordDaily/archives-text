The mother of a University
of Calif orn i a student has
charged that UC lower division
students "aren't educated any
better than they are in the
third grade."
In an interview with the
Daily Caiifornian, Mrs. Jack
Dutton based her charge on
grounds that the university's
practice of hiring graduate
students as teaching assistants
has denied students "the right
to have qualified teachers."
Mrs. Dutton cited the "extra
ordinary high ratio" of lower
division students who flunk out
of UC. She also said that teach
ing deficiencies are greatest in
the language and mathematics
departments.
