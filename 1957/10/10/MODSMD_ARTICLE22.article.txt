# French Governmental Crises

### 
Frf.NCH GOVERNMENTS fome and go, and no one
gets very excited about the changeover except
political theorists and the French candidates
themselves.
Every Frenchman knows his country will
withstand any crisis, whether economic or co
lonial or dynastic, because France is ruled by
the corrupt Syndicates, whose interest il is to
keep things going. As one Frenchman, himself
a political scientist, remarked: "You needn't
worry that France will go bankrupt. When
lliings look had, we borrow from the Bank of
France. And there's always more when that's
gone."
Hut last week's government crisis, in which
Maurice Bourges-Maunourv resigned from his
four-mouth premiership after his Algerian
home-ride hill was defeated in the "National
Assembly, holds more than theoretical interest.
Not that Bourges-Maunourv or his plan is
vitally important. (hi the contrary, nothing
indicates that his proposed liberalization of
Algerian suffrage and self-government would
have done much to end the fierce Arab na
tionalism which is draining France of her vital
manpower and economic resources. But his
resignation points up the discouraging situation
in which France finds herself: there is no one
else around with anything acceptable to offer.
From the first, Bourges-Maunourv was doom
ed to failure because nobody wanted him to
succeed. The record-breaking government of
his predecessor, Guy Mollet, was kept in
'"power" simply because no one else wanted the
job of doing the only thing possible to end the
Algerian stalemate: giving Algeria her inde
pendence. Bourges-Maunourv took office amid
immediate attacks from all sides. His best
send-off was from the conservative Paris news
paper Le Figaro, which wished him a pessi
mist ic "good luck."
Political independence for Algeria seems to
he the only answer to France s \o. I problem
and this solution no one but the Communists
is willing to accept.
The foreigner may ask himself why France
wants to keep Algeria, in the first place, and
the Frenchman would reply with various ex
cuses: there's (til in the Sahara (although until

last summer lliis had not been proven) ; the
Arabs need the French; only we could do so
much to develop the country's economy (here
he would point to recently-freed Tunisia and
Morocco, who are seeking French economic
aid); we are guarding the world from Nasser,
and a million French Algerians would be mas
sacred if we pulled out: or I and this is the most
common reason) Algeria is French —alwavs has
been and always will be.
The real reason lies deep in the French his
torical psychology. Fver since the Revolution
set out to conquer the monarchies of Europe
and bring democracy to the masses iu one uni
versal and indivisible popular state, llie French
have been hypereonscious of their destiny as
the world's only civilized and truly democratic
nation. This destiny has been to establish
French cultural ideals and the brotherhood of
man everywhere, and it is taken for granted
that the world is still waiting after 170 years
for the Revolution to reach it.
So the French sincerely do not understand
why the Algerians should want them to leave—
iu fact, tliev are unwilling to admit that this is
the case. They shrug off the present revolt as
the work of a handful of rabble-rousing oppor
tunists, egged on bv Nasser. Communism and
even American capitalism, which wants to cap
ture the North African market, et 400,000
French soldiers and $4 million a day are unable
to crush the revolt.
The recent collapse of France's empire has
tightened the French grip on Algeria. Indo
china, Tunisia and Morocco were lost in rapid
succession. Now the Frenchman sees Algeria
as his countrv'sylast hope of remaining in her
rightful place as a world power.
There seems to be little any French premier
can do. if one is ever found. It is not surprising
that President Rene Coty asked Bourges-Mau
nourv to remain in office until a successor is
invested, continuing the precedent he estab
lished with the fall of the Mollet cabinet. With
tlie unrealistic outlook of the French electorate
blocking the government's every move toward
an Algerian settlement, it may be a long lime
before any politician will accept the thankless
post of premier. In fact, the present crisis may
end only with the fall of the Fourth Republic.
