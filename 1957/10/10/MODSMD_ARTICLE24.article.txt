Chief Gordon Davis of the cam
pus Police Department is a
friendly - type guy who would
much rather meet students so
cially than as Simon Legree with
a scowl on his face and a pad of

traffic tickets in
his hand.
It's Chief Da
vis's job to keep
the campus in a
semblance of or
der, which will
be achieved a lot
sooner if stu
dents will heed
his suggestions
for the week:

® If a vehicle has not been reg
istered and a sticker applied to
the inside of the rear window of
the automobile, or to the inside of
the windshield in the case of
a cloth-topped convertible, the ve
hicle must be registered with the
Police Department by tomorrow
or a violation will be incurred.
The registration deadline has
been extended a week solely to
save money for those students
who have failed to register.

take a safety razor blade or other
means and remove the registra
tion sticker. The Police Depart
ment will issue a new one with
out charge provided the number
on the sticker is legible.
Sticker*,' are not transferable

© There is a state law against

get a parking space on the other
side of the street. This can be
dangerous.
® State law prohibits driving

ing lights only; drive with low
beams.
