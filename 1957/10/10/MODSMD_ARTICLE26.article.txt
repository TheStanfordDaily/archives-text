# Stanford Students Awarded Large Sums in Scholarships
## 
### Nina Elkind 
Everyone seems to want money,
and Stanford students are no ex
ception. Many of these students 1
not only want money, bur they I
get it—in the form of scholar
ships, fellowships and grants-in
aid.
Over $990,000 was awarded to
Stanford students for the 1956-57
academic year in four different
divisions: undergraduate, gradu
ate, athletic and grant-in-aid.
"We try to make our money go
I as far as we can to support the!
| best and neediest students," said
: the Financial Awards Committee
! chairman, Dr. W. C. Steere. "We
i are working very hard to keep the
impact of raised tuition from be
ing too painful."
For the 1956-57 school year, 638
undergraduates — about 15 per j
| cent — received Stanford scholar- j
| ships. An additional 5 per cent
received financial aid from out
side sources such as California !
State and National Merit. Ap
proximately 10 per cent of the
graduate students were aided by ;
Stanford grants.
Aside from these 504 awards, j
! many graduate students work as |
research or teaching assistants,
| bringing the total percentage of
financially aided graduate stu
' dents to about 50 per cent.
Only outstanding students are
considered for Stanford scholar
ships, and the competition is keen.
Of the 508 entering frosh who ap
plied for scholarships, the first
114 had maintained 4.0 or A av
erages throughout high school.
The lowest applicant held a 3.2 or
better than a B-grade average. !
Grade point average was approxi- i
mately 3.8.
All Stanford scholarships are
claimed; none are wasted. The Fi-;
nancial Awards Committee offers

morn awards than are available,
since many do not accept scholar
ships offered. In this way no
scholarships go begging.
Scholarships for undergraduates
are general; for graduate students
they are offered by the various de
partments or are general. All ap
plicants are judged on the basis
of academic achievement and fi
nancial need. Deadline for appli
cations for the 3958-59 grantfc is
Feb. 15.
Members of the Financial
Awards Committee include, be
sides Dr. Steere, dean of women
E. F. Brown, O. E. Byrd, W. G.
Craig, G. E. Germane, D. S. Jacob
son, A. Miller. R. K. Snyder, dean
of students H. D. Winbigler, J.
Johnson, C. W. Richards and H.
Brooks.
"If students have questions, we
are always glad to answer them.
There are no mysteries involved
in it," added Dr. Steere.
