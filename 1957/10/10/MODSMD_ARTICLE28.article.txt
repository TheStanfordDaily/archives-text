## No Problem for Chief 
### Steve Baffrey 
HERE WF GO AGAIN: Seems wo left Chief Lightfoot coping
with his autograph-hunting problem yesterday. Well, the suave
Injun had no problems of any nature when we got to Houston. I
wish you eoluld have seen the contingent of Rice beauties who met
him at the plane and escorted him to his lodging in elegant style.
Almost seemed like Rice didn't care where the team was as long
as the Chief was happy.
li was about S p.m., Houston time, when we got to the Gulf town,
and the only thing on the docket for the evening appeared to be a
bus trip to the very beautiful Shamrock-Hilton Hotel, and a dip in
the world's largest hotel swimming pool.
DISAPPOINTING NEWS: The hotel regulations mixed the pool
side fun Friday night, partly. Regulations didn't stop one of the
hotel's female guests from dipping after closing time. It was evi
dently a short trip from the liar to the pool, so she decided to make
il, clothes and all. So a small party of us got to see a diving exhi
bition after all, with Don Manoukian sitting in the life guard's chair
ready to help the lady should she be in distress.
On the way back from the pool surprise got us all when we were
approached by on of the hotel cashiers to join the hotel World Series
pool. Is gambling that legal in Texas? Paid $50 to the winner for
50 cents, but I drew a tie, and nobody else was lucky either.
There wasn't much exciting for the team to do, just hanging
around a hotel lobby, but those were the orders from the high eche
lons. Appeasement came around 10:15 with a jaunt into the terrace
room for turkey sandwiches, potato chips, cookies and milk shakes.
And bedtime came at 111.
SATURDAY: The sun rose long before I did, but didn't stay out
too long that day. At any rate, getting downstairs for breakfast was
more importani to me than any sort of celestial concentration. So,
downstairs to breakfast, and the great honor of having Dr. Sterling
with us for the meal.
'Twas a private breakfast for the Stanford party in the Nor
mandy room. Upon walking in I was struck by seeing huge glasses
of orange juice at every plate, along with THREE bottles of milk.
And also cereal, with cream, and real cream, too. Upon finishing the
juice and cereal and a Danish pastry, I was set to leave.
Well, I should have known better, for in walks a crew of waiters
with steak and eggs, as course number two. Nothing small about
1 his 10 a.m. feed, I'll tell you. Only the little Danish pastry (3-in.
diameter) didn't measure up to a Texas Brag.
TO THE POOL: The boys finally made it on Saturday. Although
Ihe hotel made it: a little difficult. Seems the smallest suit they had
was a 44, so it took a while for the whole team to get in, with about
10 suits between them. But Jack Taylor with his diving from the
IO meter board, Rick McMillen and others provided a good show
for those waiting poolside for suits.
Back io the Normandy room for a strategy conference at noon
and prescribed lounging brought us up to meal time again at 4.
And this was one of the highlights of the trip.
Something Else Expected
It's hard lo say exactly what the team was expecting, but they
didn't get il. at any rate. Menu? Orange juice, tea and two poached
eggs, each on a soggy piece of toast, plus one baked or boiled potato
wrapped in aluminum foil. I really think they were expecting a bit
more. The comments were iittle short: of priceless:
AL HARRINGTON: What are these, Owl eggs?
DON MANOUKIAN: I havent' had enough to fill up my right
knee.
MANOUK again, lo Trainer Connie Jarvis: I'd like to have what
laid these.
FOR THE THIRD TIME: I'll bet .'less Neely (Rice coach) made
up this menu.
Appeased again with toast and honey, the 37 Indians and their
friends had but little time to finish up their discussion or watching
ol the World Series game or the Cal-MSC game, national TV'd. And
soon it was time to leave.
Well, from here on in you know the rest of the story, because
immediately afler ihe game ihc team returned to Stanford via the
big silver bird, eating another filet mignon dinner along the way.
And it was sort of a long ride back because all 37 of those travel
ing Indians felt pretty bad about losing. And it seems that until
sleep caught up with most of them, all they could do was chastise
themselves for letting a blocker through here, or a tackier there,
or not covei'ing an end somewhere else.
The end of the trip found the boys congregating at Storey House
for a doughnuts-and-coffee reception. A small welcoming gesture
on the part of the girls, and one appreciated by the entire team.
And all the while they were gone Hie boys did but four things:
sludy, eat, relax and play football. Not once was ihere a minute for
them io go off sight-seeing, or leave the general area of the hotel.
For me. because I did have a chance to see ihe town, and do a
li'tle more than the team was allowed to, it was an enjoyable trip.
For them it would have taken only a win to change the whole pic
lure. But they did vow one thing:
THAT'S THE LAST LOSS THIS YEAR.
