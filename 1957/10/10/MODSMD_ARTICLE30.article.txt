# Yanks Square Series on Bauer's Homer; Larsen, Burdette Vie Today in finale
## 
### 
NEW YORK (/P) Hank Bau
er's homer that was only inches
fair and Boh Turley's brilliant

four â€¢ hit pitching evened the
World Series at three games each
yesterday with a 3-2 New York

Yankee victory over Milwaukee.
Turley threw a masterful
game, blending his zipping fast
ball with a slow curve and slider
to save the Yanks from elimina
tion. The reformed scatter - arm
righthander, who failed to last
two innings in Milwaukee, ended
the game with a flourish by start
ing a double play on a ball hit
back to the box by Wes Coving
ton. He walked only two and
fanned eight Braves..
Yogi Berra's 10th World Series
homer with Enos Slaughter on
base in the third inning gave the
Yanks a 2-0 edge on starter Bob
Buhl. But the Braves continued
to fight back gamely just as they
have done all season.
Frank Torre, son of a retired
Brooklyn policeman, got one run
back with a fifth-inning homer
into ihe lower right field stands
and Hank Aaron smashed a 420-
foot drive into the Braves' bull
pen in left to tie the score in the
seventh.
So it was 2-2 when Bauer, the
bruiser from the Marine Corps,
came up to swing in the seventh
with nobody on base.
Ernie Johnson, who had re
lieved Buhl in the third, worked
Ihe count on Bauer to 2-2 before
the Yankee right fielder drove
the ball down the left field fold
line. It hit the foul screen and
bounced back on the field in a
moment of confusion.
Foul line umpire Frank Secory
of the National League and third
base umpire Joe Paparella of Ihe
American League gave that
whirling sign with the right
hand, indicating a home run. The
ball had struck the screen that
juts out from the foul pole into
fair territory to help the umpires
call borderline drives. It made
no difference that it bounced
back because it: was a homer the
minute it hit the screen about 315
feet from home plate.
