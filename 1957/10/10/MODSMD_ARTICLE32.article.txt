### 
The heavens poured sporadi
cally upon the Stanford practice
field yesterday, hul it failed to
dampen the Indians' spirit as
they continued defensive prepa
rations for Saturday afternoon's
PCC opener here against aerial
minded Washington State Col
lege.
Coach Chuck Taylor returned
halfback Jackie Taylor to the
quarterback slot, and (he 6-0, 173-
pound junior from Whittier was
hitting his receivers with more
than casual regularity.
First-string signal caller Jackie
Douglas, the victim of a bruised
back in last Saturday's 34-7 loss
to Rice Institute, participated in
his first workout this week, alter
nating with Taylor.
Douglas, donning a sweat suit,
directed the first team during
part of the offensive practice, but
did not take part in the defensive
session. He said he felt better
than he had all week and ap
peared ready to answer the start
ing call Saturday.
Fullback Chuck Shea, mean
while, returned to the active list
yesterday and showed little ef
fects of the charley horse that

had sidelined him. The fifth
ranked ball carrier in the PCC to
date, Shea was running at top
speed during offensive drills
against the bags.
Taylor announced last night
thai he will send the Cardinals
through a "no pads" practice to
day. He will review offensive
and defensive plans for the Cou
gars, who lead the PCC in pass
ing.
Sophomore quarterback Dick
Norman simulated the Washing
ton State pass patterns as the In
dians sent their first three units
against the pseudo-Cougars dum
my-style.
The Cougars have a deadly
passing attack, geared by El Cer
rito's Bob Newman and Bunny
Aldrich, who have combined for
six touchdowns through the air
this season.
Newman is the PCC's leading
passer with 27 completions in 51
attempts for 333 yards in three
games and three TD's. His favor
ite receiver is Don Ellingsen, the
spread end in the Cougars' slot-T
offense. Ellingsen paces the PCC
with 12 receptions for 149 yards.
