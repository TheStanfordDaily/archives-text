Sponsors from all three fresh
man dormitories have been en
thusiastic in their approval of the
1957 Pre - Registration Commit
tee's planning and organization,
commending the group's hard
work and genuine interest in wel
coming the incoming freshmen.
Most sponsors also thoroughly
enjoyed I he week themselves, es
pecially recalling their own fresh
man reactions to pre-reg from the
point of view of two or three
years later.
Wi lljui' Head Sponsor Dwight
Clark s;iid that this year's pro
gram achieved a better balance
of social and academic orienta
tion, with the addition of the Un
dergraduate S t u d i es Program
panel and faculty dormitory dis
cussions.
The new student this autumn
received a more integrated pic
ture of what his actual Stanford
(wporience would be, Clark said.
Faculty open houses seemed to
l»e very popular with everyone,
according to Branner President
Carolee flouser. Roble sponsor
Margo Lovendale added that the
exceptional hospitality and con
cern of the faculty throughout
pre-reg inspired freshman think
ing about the opportunities and
goals of their college years.
Suggestions for future pre-reg
planning ranged in subject from
scheduling details to a few per
ennial problems of this program.
One of I he latter was expressed
by Branner sponsors at a recent
pre-reg evaluation session with

Assistant Dean of Women Mrs.
John L. Koonce.
In the large • scale mixing of
men's and women's groups at pre
reg activities, the emphasis is too
often more upon "pairing off"
than on a general introduction to
many other members of the class.
This sometimes forced and un
natural situation has long con
fronted the sponsors and Pre-Reg
Committee.
Another annual pre-reg prob
lem repeatedly mentioned in
sponsor comments was freshman
exhaustion. Possibly a few more
hours might be set aside for peo
ple to unpack and get their bear
ings in their living groups, sug
gested Roble sponsor Pat Dal
gard.
Several sponsors felt that the
President's Reception on the
Tuesday of registration was un
connected with the rest of pre-reg
and might better replace the
Bowman coffee hour on Fresh
man Sunday.
They also recalled some pro
gram confusion on Sunday night
when the flicks conflicted with
the explanation of registration
procedure.
Most of the sponsors at the
Branner evaluation meeting felt
that the Thursday faculty discus
sions in the dormitories were far
more effective than the faculty
adviser dinner guests on Sunday
night.
The overwhelming consensus
of sponsor opinion was that the
whole program was an outstand
ing success.

Sponsors from all three fresh
man dormitories have been en
thusiastic in their approval of the
1957 Pre - Registration Commit
tee's planning and organization,
commending the group's hard
work and genuine interest in wel
coming the incoming freshmen.
Most sponsors also thoroughly
enjoyed I he week themselves, es
pecially recalling their own fresh
man reactions to pre-reg from the
point of view of two or three
years later.
Wi lljui' Head Sponsor Dwight
Clark s;iid that this year's pro
gram achieved a better balance
of social and academic orienta
tion, with the addition of the Un
dergraduate S t u d i es Program
panel and faculty dormitory dis
cussions.
The new student this autumn
received a more integrated pic
ture of what his actual Stanford
(wporience would be, Clark said.
Faculty open houses seemed to
l»e very popular with everyone,
according to Branner President
Carolee flouser. Roble sponsor
Margo Lovendale added that the
exceptional hospitality and con
cern of the faculty throughout
pre-reg inspired freshman think
ing about the opportunities and
goals of their college years.
Suggestions for future pre-reg
planning ranged in subject from
scheduling details to a few per
ennial problems of this program.
One of I he latter was expressed
by Branner sponsors at a recent
pre-reg evaluation session with

Assistant Dean of Women Mrs.
John L. Koonce.
In the large • scale mixing of
men's and women's groups at pre
reg activities, the emphasis is too
often more upon "pairing off"
than on a general introduction to
many other members of the class.
This sometimes forced and un
natural situation has long con
fronted the sponsors and Pre-Reg
Committee.
Another annual pre-reg prob
lem repeatedly mentioned in
sponsor comments was freshman
exhaustion. Possibly a few more
hours might be set aside for peo
ple to unpack and get their bear
ings in their living groups, sug
gested Roble sponsor Pat Dal
gard.
Several sponsors felt that the
President's Reception on the
Tuesday of registration was un
connected with the rest of pre-reg
and might better replace the
Bowman coffee hour on Fresh
man Sunday.
They also recalled some pro
gram confusion on Sunday night
when the flicks conflicted with
the explanation of registration
procedure.
Most of the sponsors at the
Branner evaluation meeting felt
that the Thursday faculty discus
sions in the dormitories were far
more effective than the faculty
adviser dinner guests on Sunday
night.
The overwhelming consensus
of sponsor opinion was that the
whole program was an outstand
ing success.
