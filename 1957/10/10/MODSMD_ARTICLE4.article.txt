# SRI Radar Equipment Made Possible Contact with 'Sputnik'
## Echo Could Derive from Satellite or Meteors; 'Moon' Hard to Detect Because of High Speed 
### Bob Ellis 
Stanford Research Institute's big radar set, used to bounce beams
off the moon, may have made contact, with the Russian satellite yes
terday morning, Dr. Allen M. Peterson said last night.
It is still undetermined if the echo was from the satellite itself or
from meleors or the third stage of the rocket, which has also become

a satellite, following "Sputnik."
An associate. Professor Von R.
Eshleman of the Electrical Engi
neering Department, said echo is
a very touchy thing. "It's hard to
tell just what you're getting."
Peterson spoke at a meeting of
the Stanford student branch of
the American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers and Institute of
Radio Engineers last night „.at-
Crothers Memorial Hall. He has I
spent several days tracking the j
satellite.
The satellite is harrier to pick
up than one might think, he said.
It is small and moves at a rela
tively high speed, making one
revolution around the earth in
slightly over 96 minutes.
SRI managed to calculate the
distance to the satellite on a few
passes and this was sent to a
University of California astron
omy professor who figured out
the satellite's orbit.
The orbit information gave Pe
terson a good chance of hitting
the satellite with the narrow ra
dar beam, although the satellite
is about the minimum size that
can be picked up at that distance.
He may have been successful yes
terday morning.
The SRI scientists thought
they had done some original
work in figuring out how to lo
cate the satellite, but when a
translation of a Russian pam
phlet printed in June arrived a
few days ago, SRI discovered
Russia had suggested many of
the techniques.
Russian accomplishment was
great, Peterson said, in that they
not only said what they would do,
but were actually able to accom
plish it, putting the satellite on a
specific orbit and at a certain
speed. This is no mean trick, he
added.
