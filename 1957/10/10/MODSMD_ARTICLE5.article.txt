# Villard: Soviet Moon Is Scientific Pearl Harbor
## 
### 
The United States lias just gone
through a scientific Pearl Harbor,
according to Dr. O. G. Villard,
Stanford professor.
Yesterday morning the Univer
sity received a Russian manual
with details about the launching,
radio waves and general orbit of
the Soviet satellite. The manual
had been published in Muy or
June, but had been ignored by
American scientists until the sat
ellite made its appearance last
week.
Information in the manual al
most exactly matches the infor
mation scientists here have been
finding the hard way.
When asked for his opinion on
the question of the Russian inter
c o n t i n e n t a 1 ballistic missile
(ICBM), Dr. Villard said he
thought the fact that the satellite
was launched strongly suggests
that the Soviets have an ICBM.
He said that if the Russians
exerted the same magnitude of
effort on the ICBM that they did
on the satellite, they either have
such a missile or will have one in
the near future. "In any case,"
he said, "it's later than we think."
