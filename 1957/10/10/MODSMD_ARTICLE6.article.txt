# Ike Unruffled In Discussion Of 'Sputnik'
## U.S. Security Assured As Scientists Prepare For March Launching 
### 
WASHINGTON 1 (/P)—As Sput
nik rocketed through its fifth day
in the heavens, President Eisen
hower discussed the Russian
achievement for the first time.
He made these points at a news
conference:
Four Points
• The successful launching of
the satellite has not increased
his concern about national secu
rity one iota.
• The United States could
have put a satellite in orbit be
fore now but "to the detriment
of scientific goals and military
progress" in the long-range mis
sile field.
• After tests in December, the
United States plans to fire "a
fully instrumented satellite ve
hicle" in March of 1958.
• This country was never in a
race with Russia to get the first
satellite into orbit.
Not Upset
The statement and questions
and answers that followed
seemed to come down to the idea
that Eisenhower sees no particu
lar need to be disturbed about So
viet activities in the satellite and
missiles field and no compelling
reason for putting our own pro
grams on a crash basis.
However, the American pro
gram to put up an earth satellite,
which started out as a $22 million
job, had jumped to $66 million to
cover instrumentation. Now it
has soared to $110 million to pro
vide special observation stations.
And the figure may still have
to go up.
Ike (Joncedcs
The chief executive conceded
that on missiles:
"I wish we were further ahead
and knew more as to accuracy
and to the erosion and to the
heat-resistant qualities of metals
and all the other things we have
to know."
While Eisenhower spoke with
an air of composure and calm, ob
viously the satellite and missile
questions had been receiving
deep, detailed study at the White
House and elsewhere in the ad
ministration.
Need Flan
Meanwhile, at the United Na
tions yesterday the United States
stressed the need for U.S. ap
proval of a disarmament plan
which emphasizes control of out
er space missiles.
President Eisenhower said the
United States is prepared to enter
into multi-nation talks on control
of outer space missiles for peace
ful purposes, provided Britain,
France, Canada and other inter
ested allies agree. Ho ruled out
direct American-Russian negotia
tions.
