# Spring Revue Talent Search Now Going On
## Musical, Non-musical Acts Will Be Chosen For Four $50 Prizes 
### 
Competition for material to be
used in the Stanford Players Re
vue next spring will end Nov. 1.
The competition is open to every
one, including students, alumni of
the Department of Speech and
Drama and the general public.
Four prizes of $50 each will be
awarded for the two best musical
and non-musical numbers. Judges
will be members of the depart
| rnent. Songs or scripts will not
be returned.
First production rights to all
numbers must be given to the De
pa rtmen! of Speech and Drama,
otherwise all entries will remain
the property of those who submit
them.
The following is a general guide
regarding the type of material
desired:
Styi«? Guide
Style: A revue offers opportu
nity for production of numbers in
a realistic manner as wol! as any
of the "isms"—such as simplified
realism and expressionism — and
satirical treatment of any style is
particularly desirable.
Quality: Since this is a produc
tion of the drama department of
a major university, the material
should reflect the thinking that
exists within such an institution.
It should display the result of well
trained minds brought to bear on
contemporary problems and situ
ations and should at the same
time display a good knowledge of
theatrical timing and techniques.
Length: Length of each indi
vidual number should not exceed
10 minutes, unless it is intended
to be a production number involv
ing a dancing or singing chorus.
In general, 5 to 10 minutes should
be considered the most satisfac
tory length for each number.
Conversational Revue
Kind: Any type of conversa
--*tonal~ revue number will be ac
ceptable. This would include sa
tiric monologues, satiric skits,
: solo ballads, patter or other comic
j songs, humorous continuity nar
ration, dance or song production
numbers, and nostalgic, poignant
or sophisticated songs.
Satires should be topical deal
ing with college life, the arts and
j literature of today, government
; and politics, psychology and psy
i chiatry, economic problems of
i modern living, or any other of
i the many facets of 20th century
j life.
Since a revue involves many
separate scenes, the emphasis will
of necessity be on the quality of
the writing and performance rath
er than on the staging, although
the complete facilities of me De
partment of Speech and Drama
will be available for the produc
j tion.

i tained from Stirling L. Huntley

and Drama.
