# ON OTHER CAMPUSES-By Barbara Hicks
## Influenza Ravaging Campuses 
### 
While influcn/a is ravaging campuses through
oul the nation, the hale and hearty members of
college communities are turning their attention
to a wide variety of topics.
Occidental's traditional hazing program took a
new twist when the hazing committee shipped
the freshman class president, Bill Paden, off to
Hawaii. Paden was kidnapped by 50 sophomores,
taken to the Burbank Airport and ushered onto
a Trans-Continental Airlines plane for Hawaii.
He was told he had a one-way ticket, but upon
his arrival at the Honolulu Airport, he was pre
sented with a return ticket for the same day.

"The time has come, fellow automobile own
ers," declares the San Jose Spartan Daily.
"Throw off the shackles of high gasoline prices
and low availability of parking spaces. Join the
glorious bicycle movement. . . . Cyclists, we
salute you. You have, in the face of adversities,
found a solution. Your parking problem is nil.
You are getting healthy, riding in the clear, al
most smog-free San Jose air. . . . And to you,
the poor oppressed automobile owners, we say,
look forward. Make the switch from four wheels
to two. Drivers of the world, arise!"
H to it
Not only are the UCLA Bruins having trouble
Willi Ducks, Indians, etc., they now have to con
lend with coyotes, or at least one coyote. Cam
pus police were searching for the wild gray
coyote which attacked a UCLA nurseryman.
The coyote was believed to have come down from
ihe thickly-wooded hills behind the campus and
the search is concentrating around the big "C."

"Somewhere from the depths of this citadel
of higher education comes the cry 'Down with
the general curriculum!' and we shed a tear for
the liberal arts scholar." The Daily Californian

across the bay is bemoaning a tendency on the
Cal campus for immediate specialization. "Cer
tain educators believe the general curriculum
major is of little value after his graduation,"
says the Californian, protesting against this
trend.
A revamping of the homecoming program is
a current key activity a«t USC. Homecoming
planners have announced the elimination of
floats and Flapper Day. The committee listed
great expense, low grades and poor conduct as
ihe basis for their destruction of the Troydition,
explains the Daily Trojan. Protests have been
sounded throughout the campus, but, according
to the Trojan, ASSC President Larry Sipes said,
"We have redirected the emphasis on Homecom
ing during 1957. We are going to bring Home
coming home."

Two University of Oregon students have been
vying with nature in a 180-mile canoe trip down
the Willamette River from Eugene to Portland.
Jim Perry and Chuck Mitchelmore, editor of the
Oregon Emerald, made the trip in four days, re
porting that "the greatest danger came from
small boys in power boats with a knack for
spraying canoes in wicked wakes."

"Less work and more play is the philosophy of
college students," says the Daily Kansan. In a
survey of mechanics in Kansas City, Mo., and of
University of Kansas students, 59 per cent of the
students disagreed with the statement "Now
adays many people spend too much money on
pleasure and recreation." And 82 per cent of the
students said the most important thing in a
man's life is not his job. However, 44 per cent
of the mechanics said that too much is spent on
pleasure and only 48 per cent disagreed that the
job is the most important.
