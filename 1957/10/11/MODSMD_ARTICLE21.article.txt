T ess Than in High School
Editor, The Daily:
Since I came here several years ago I have
heard many grumblings among disappointed and
disillusioned undergraduates. The content of the
grumblings has varied from complaints about,
ihe texture of the toast in the Encina dining hall
1o the suppression of creative non-conformist ac
tivities such as slaughtering a cow atop Hoover
Tower. To most of these grumblings I have re
acted with scorn or a chuckle, depending upon
mood. But one tenor of discontent has con
tinually aroused my sympathy and even fervor.
The particular subject of discontent to which I
refer is the abhorrent lack (so it seems to many,
including myself) of a mature, adult-like atmos
phere on the Stanford campus.
I cannot believe, as many fatalistically contend,
that this lack is due to the general quality of per
son who attends this University. Certainly it has
something to do with the general attitude of the
Stanford student, but this attitude is due as much
to the character of the existing social institutions
as to the character of the students. I have seen
countless numbers of sensitive mature persons
enter into the freshman class, only to be absorbed
and assimilated into the level of Stanford life,
which demands very little of either sensitiveness
or maturity. These qualities are stimulated only
through adult relationships, and where the stand
ard of relations to oneself and others is that of
an irresponsible adolescent, then one must, and
usually does, adjust—often out of the simple
necessity for mental health.
Stanford's geographical isolation (our "ivory
covered tower") is in part the reason for the teen
age tempo that prevails. This isolation has its
advantages (at least academically) as well as dis
advantages. Still, the fact that we are so cut off
from people who have left the shelters of Acad
emia and are working, loving and suffering in
"real life" is a misfortune for our own intellec
tual and spiritual growth, in that a gap is left
between the facts we are learning from our books
and what these facts mean to us as human beings.
We all know that the vital, maturing experiences
of our lives are what really give meaning and
coherence to the content of our intellectual pur
suits, but the opportunities for such experiences
are strictly limited at Stanford, partly because
of its isolation.
But the geographical factor is permanent. What
is required to offset this cultural vacuum is a
more adult system of social regulations than now
exists. And thoughtful examination of the values
inherent in the existing social regulations will.
I am sure, reveal the fact that Stanford students
are regarded, and hence come to regard them
selves, as something less than responsible adults.
This is especially true with respect to the females,
who for the most part are asked to assume less
responsibility over a vast range of their lives
than they had assumed during their high school
years. And this is the time of maturity! Cer
tainly a girl is not going to grow into a woman
it her decision-powers regarding her own fate are
drastically limited as they now are.
Why, ask yourself, should girls not be allowed
live off campus, with all the responsibilities
and greater opportunities for maturing that such
:*■ 1 ife might offer? Or why should not those who
Chose to live in campus dormitories (male and
female) be allowed to entertain members of the
opposite sex in their rooms, as I'm told is the
approved practice at such schools as Harvard
and Yale? Is there anything that we, as rational
persons, might fear from such changes?
I fail to see how the suggestion that college
Women be allowed to live where and as they
please could bo regarded as shocking, even to
trustees and whoever else represents authority

in these matters. To allow girls the opportunities
of growing into womanhood during these four
years in college can only benefit the individuals
who take advantage of this opportunity, the Stan
ford social and academic atmosphere as a whole
and even, in a broader sense, society in general.
There may be other possible changes, though
this seems the most vital. The important thing
is to raise our voices: calmly, considerately—but
forcefully and NOW. Authority cannot endlessly
oppose good sense; and I believe authority will
even aid the cause if it can be made to see that
the present system is blocking individual growth
and development, which is, after all, education.
Laurence Seagel
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to make two comments on the
letters in Wednesday's "Letters to the Editor"
column, which referred to the conduct of Stan
ford students at last Sunday night's flicks.
First, Mr. and Mrs. Schagrin and Mr. Glover
are apparently new to Stanford and do not real
ize that the Sunday Night Flicks are at the bot
tom of the Stanford scale of cultural activities.
I hope they will not take the example of Sunday
night at Mem Aud as typical of the Stanford
intellectual scene, and that they will avail them
selves of the numerous cultural activities and
programs found on the campus nearly every
other night of the week. To expect cultural up
lift at the flicks is to expect the impossible.
Second, both parties claimed "Citizen Kane"
to be "one of the great motion pictures of all
time" and apparently of intellectual merit. I do
not regard a take-off on the life of that arch
scoundrel William Randolph Hearst (which this
film was* as worth the time I spent to see it.
But it certainly was worth every hoot and holler
the patrons of the flicks could provide.

An Ode to Mangini's
In Mangini's Barn the memories flow
Among the bottles, row on row,
That mark this place: and we recall
The laughs, the song, the beer and all.
Through visions dimmer and shouts now low.
We are the memories. Years ago
We drank here, played, and seeds were sown
And sown again by others here
In Mangini's Barn.
An Era is passed, and behind us falls.
With hammer, brace, destroy these walls
And let escape into the sky
The memories that dim, and slowly die.
But some will stay, the stories, the lore,
And will remind us,
When Mangini's is no more.

A Biology Project?
Editor, The Daily:
Being a regular visitor to the Cellar, I have
been forced to become acquainted with a great
number of bees. After many philosophical dis
cussions with these little creatures, I have de
cided that they serve a useless purpose at the
Cellar other than that of annoying the custom
ers.
I heartily suggest that. ASSU do something to
rid the Cellar area of these little insects. Would
n't this make a good project for the Biology De
partment?
