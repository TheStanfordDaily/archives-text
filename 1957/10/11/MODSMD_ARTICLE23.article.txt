A limited sampling of freshman
thinking on the 1957 pre-registra
tion program might be captured
in the phrase of Jacquie Johnston
of Branner —"wonderful but wear
ing"—although it. is dangerous to
presume to sense a climate of
opinion in a large and varied
group without extensively polling
its members.
Students seem to remember an
atmosphere about pre-reg rather
than its specific events. When
commenting specifically on the
four-day haze, both men and wom
en most often remembered enjoy
ing the faculty open houses.
Many tired of schedules and felt
that their herd instincts were def
initely overworked. Dick Scott, of
Rinconada thought that the mix
ing of the class was too organized
and that he would have liked to
explore the campus a bit on his
own.
Optional Plans
Sherry 1 Hopkins of Roble sug
gested that: perhaps some of the
activities could be made optional
in future years, as did Elaine
Grosskopf of Branner.
Most freshmen questioned had
enjoyed meeting so many other
members of their class, but sev
eral pointed out that the mass in
tegration was awkward at times.
Nancy Webb of Roble said that
often both men and women seem
ed uncertain how much to pair off
and how much to mix.
Branner freshman Lei Lowery
observed that the women of the
class got well acquainted with the
men, but wondered if perhaps Ro
ble and Branner women might be
included in the general mingling.

The friendliness pervading pre
reg certainly exploded the popu
lar myth of the "Stanford snobs,"
said Beth Hillman of Roble.
Gretchen Wiethman of Roble
felt that the freshman was so well
treated during pre-reg that it is
now difficult for him to begin
seeking his own niche in campus
life.
The freshmen in general seem
to look back upon pre-reg as a
good but overwhelming experi
ence which the coming weeks at
Stanford will further illuminate
for them.

Most freshmen questioned had
enjoyed meeting so many other
members of their class, but sev
eral pointed out that the mass in
tegration was awkward at times.
Nancy Webb of Roble said that
often both men and women seem
ed uncertain how much to pair off
and how much to mix.
Branner freshman Lei Lowery
observed that the women of the
class got well acquainted with the
men, but wondered if perhaps Ro
ble and Branner women might be
included in the general mingling.

The friendliness pervading pre
reg certainly exploded the popu
lar myth of the "Stanford snobs,"
said Beth Hillman of Roble.
Gretchen Wiethman of Roble
felt that the freshman was so well
treated during pre-reg that it is
now difficult for him to begin
seeking his own niche in campus
life.
The freshmen in general seem
to look back upon pre-reg as a
good but overwhelming experi
ence which the coming weeks at
Stanford will further illuminate
for them.
(Editor's Note: This is the
last in a series of four articles
on the Pre-Regis'iration Com
mittee, which welcomes fresh
men to Stanford each autumn
quarter.)

A limited sampling of freshman
thinking on the 1957 pre-registra
tion program might be captured
in the phrase of Jacquie Johnston
of Branner —"wonderful but wear
ing"—although it. is dangerous to
presume to sense a climate of
opinion in a large and varied
group without extensively polling
its members.
Students seem to remember an
atmosphere about pre-reg rather
than its specific events. When
commenting specifically on the
four-day haze, both men and wom
en most often remembered enjoy
ing the faculty open houses.
Many tired of schedules and felt
that their herd instincts were def
initely overworked. Dick Scott, of
Rinconada thought that the mix
ing of the class was too organized
and that he would have liked to
explore the campus a bit on his
own.
Optional Plans
Sherry 1 Hopkins of Roble sug
gested that: perhaps some of the
activities could be made optional
in future years, as did Elaine
Grosskopf of Branner.
