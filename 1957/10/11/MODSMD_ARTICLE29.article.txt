# Lew Burdette Pitches Braves To Series Title
## 
### 
NEW YORK (JP) — Lew Bur
dot te became the first World Se
ries pitcher in 52 years to pitch
two shutouts as his 5-0 seven-hit
ter over the New York Yankees
yesterday gave ihe Milwaukee
Braves a world championship on
the very first try .
The fidgety righth a n d e r
touched off a roar that echoed
from Yankee Stadium to deliri
ous Wisconsin Avenue in Mil
waukee when he retired Bill
Skowron, the last Yankee batter,
to end the seventh game.
Not since Christy Mathewson
threw three shutouts for the New
York Giants against the Philadel
phia A's in 1905 had a man
blanked the enemy twice in series
play.
Burdette, an ex-Yankee, hadn't
allowed a run in 24 2-3 innings
while twisting the proud New
Yorkers around his little finger.
Bur d etto whipped Bobby
Shantz 4-2 in the second game to
square the series and his 1-0 vic
tory over Whitey Ford in the
game Monday at Milwaukee put
his team one game up. And yes
terday he bounced back, only 48
hours later, to lead the Braves to
their greatest moment.
The last Yankee run off the big
fellow with a shock of rust-col
ored close - cropped hair was a
homer by Hank Bauer in the
third inning of the second game.
His streak of 24 2-3 scoreless
frames is only five short of Babe
Ruth's string of 29 2-3 innings
stretched over two World Series.
Each winning Brave will get
about $9090 from Ihe player pool
that was split 33 ways. The
Yanks will take home about
$5710 each, their smallest pay
day in years.
