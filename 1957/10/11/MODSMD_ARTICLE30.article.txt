# ‘If He Could Cook I'd Marry Him’

NEW YORK </P) — "Oh. that
Burdette, if he could cook I'd
marry him.''
Manager Fred Haney of the
world champion Milwaukee
Braves, said it just as calmly as
if he were having an afternoon
cup of tea at home.
Haney said he never really was
worried about Burdette— this fel
low talks in understatements —
but that he was considering tak
ing him out in the ninth when
the Yanks loaded the bases.
"I was going to let him face
one more hitter," Haney said.
"Then I would have had to take
him out. But I wanted him to
finish real bad. I knew he was
getting tired, but I wanted him in
there at the end."
