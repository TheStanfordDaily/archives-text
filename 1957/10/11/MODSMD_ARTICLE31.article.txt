### 
NEW YORK (/P)â€”Casey SI en
gel paid full homage yesterday to
Lew Burdette, the conqueror of
his world champion New York
Yankees.
"He pitched in three games and
held us close all the way," said
the beaten Yankee manager.
"He is the best pitcher I have
seen in three games against us
this year. How many runs did
wp make against him? Two.
That's all there is to it." In Sten
gel's opinion that is the whole
story of why the Milwaukee
Braves are now the new world
champions.
