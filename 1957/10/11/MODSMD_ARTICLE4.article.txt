# Prints No Longer Requirement for U.S. Tourist Visa
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/!')â€”The Unit
ed States yesterday abolished,
with some few exceptions, its con
troversial requirement that ail
visitors from abroad be subjected
to fingerprinting.
Secretary of State Dulles and
Atty. (Jen. Brownell, acting on au
thority given them by Congress
a month ago, swept aside the
practice of 15 years' standing.
The move seemed clearly aimed
at meeting bitter protests from
such countries as Russia which
have denounced fingerprinting as
a device to discourage visitors to
the United States.
The State Department, in an- j
nouncing the end of the require-1
rnent yesterday, said it would be
"on a basis of reciprocity."
But for the overwhelming ma
jority of tourists, some 500.000 a
year, the fingerprinting will be
eliminated if they otherwise qual
ify for an American visa.
Visa requirements remain un
changed, it was emphasized, with
each American consul overseas
having the right to refuse entry
permission to Communists or oth
ers advocating overthrow of the
American government by force.
