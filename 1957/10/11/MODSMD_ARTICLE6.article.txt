missiles "which can blow us to
bits."
But Soviet foreign minister An

missiles, "like atomic energy, can
serve the purpose of peace or they
can be used to blow us to bits."
He recalled th a t the United

"The world knows now (hat a
decade of anxiety and trouble
could have been avoided if (hat.
plan had been accepted. We now
have a similar opportunity to har
ness for peace man's new pioneer
ing efforts in outer space. Wo
must not miss this chance."
