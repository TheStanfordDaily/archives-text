These inscrutable Stanford In
dians held together' by Asian flu
shots, a multitude of special pro
tective pads, yards of adhesive
tape and a determined will to win
—open their Pacific Coast Con
ference season tomorrow when
they play host to the Washington
State College Cougars in Stanford
Stadium. Kickoff time is 2 p.m.
That it: will be no Fourth of
July picnic for the Indians, de
spite being "High School Band
Day" in the Stadium, is an evi
dent fact. The Cougars have the
leading pass attack in the confer
ence and have not been confront
ed with the injury and illness
problem that has befallen Stan
ford.
Starting right end Ben Robin
son, the Indians' leading pass re
ceiver, and three other prominent
Cardinals, center John Thomas,
quarterback Bob Nicolet and
guard Don Dawson, were bedded
with slight flu attacks Wednes
day. It is doubtful that any of
the four will be at top strength
tomorrow, but Robinson has re
covered sufficiently to open
against the Cougars.
Van Galder, Valli Out
However, co-captain and end
Gary Van Galder -and fullback
Lou Valli will not play tomorrow.
Van Galder suffered a concussion
last Saturday when the Indians
lost to Rice Institute, 34-7, and
Valli hurt his left knee against
Northwestern two weeks ago.
Earlier this week, coach Chuck
Taylor lost the services of half
back Roy Stephen for from four
to six weeks when he broke a
bone in his left hand during a
scrimmage.
Two question-mark performers
at the beginning of the week
were quarterback Jackie Douglas
and fullback Chuck Shea, who
were injured against Rice. But
both will be able to play tomor
row although possibly not at top
efficiency.
Douglas Bruised
Douglas bruised his back mak
ing a tackle in the first quarter
last Saturday and confined his
workouts to non - contact drills
this week. He will wear a special
protective pad, but nevertheless
should have difficulty in throw
ing long.
As a safety measure, coach
Taylor had his namesake Jackie
Taylor return from halfback to
quarterback in practices this
week, and Jackie was throwing
and faking well.
The 5-10, 178-pound Douglas
will open at the key signal-calling
position, Taylor, the coach, said
last night. Taylor, the player, will
start at left halfback.
Shea, who had a charley horse
in his right thigh, was running
at the clip that has marked him
as the PCC's fifth leading ball
packer during late-week drills
and will begin at fullback.
On the other side of the fence,
Washington State has not been
plagued with injuries to date. In
fact, ihey gained an experienced
lineman this week when tackle
Alan Williamson, a junior who
had been sidelined with injuries
early in the season, returned to
the fold.
