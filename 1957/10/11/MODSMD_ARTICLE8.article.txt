# Tonight's Grid Rally in Frost To Charge WSC Game Spirit
## Indians Face WSC Cougars In PCC Opener Both Douglas, Taylor Scheduled to Start As Starters Shuffled 
### Roy Lawson 
These inscrutable Stanford In
dians held together' by Asian flu
shots, a multitude of special pro
tective pads, yards of adhesive
tape and a determined will to win
—open their Pacific Coast Con
ference season tomorrow when
they play host to the Washington
State College Cougars in Stanford
Stadium. Kickoff time is 2 p.m.
That it: will be no Fourth of
July picnic for the Indians, de
spite being "High School Band
Day" in the Stadium, is an evi
dent fact. The Cougars have the
leading pass attack in the confer
ence and have not been confront
ed with the injury and illness
problem that has befallen Stan
ford.
Starting right end Ben Robin
son, the Indians' leading pass re
ceiver, and three other prominent
Cardinals, center John Thomas,
quarterback Bob Nicolet and
guard Don Dawson, were bedded
with slight flu attacks Wednes
day. It is doubtful that any of
the four will be at top strength
tomorrow, but Robinson has re
covered sufficiently to open
against the Cougars.
Van Galder, Valli Out
However, co-captain and end
Gary Van Galder -and fullback
Lou Valli will not play tomorrow.
Van Galder suffered a concussion
last Saturday when the Indians
lost to Rice Institute, 34-7, and
Valli hurt his left knee against
Northwestern two weeks ago.
Earlier this week, coach Chuck
Taylor lost the services of half
back Roy Stephen for from four
to six weeks when he broke a
bone in his left hand during a
scrimmage.
Two question-mark performers
at the beginning of the week
were quarterback Jackie Douglas
and fullback Chuck Shea, who
were injured against Rice. But
both will be able to play tomor
row although possibly not at top
efficiency.
Douglas Bruised
Douglas bruised his back mak
ing a tackle in the first quarter
last Saturday and confined his
workouts to non - contact drills
this week. He will wear a special
protective pad, but nevertheless
should have difficulty in throw
ing long.
As a safety measure, coach
Taylor had his namesake Jackie
Taylor return from halfback to
quarterback in practices this
week, and Jackie was throwing
and faking well.
The 5-10, 178-pound Douglas
will open at the key signal-calling
position, Taylor, the coach, said
last night. Taylor, the player, will
start at left halfback.
Shea, who had a charley horse
in his right thigh, was running
at the clip that has marked him
as the PCC's fifth leading ball
packer during late-week drills
and will begin at fullback.
On the other side of the fence,
Washington State has not been
plagued with injuries to date. In
fact, ihey gained an experienced
lineman this week when tackle
Alan Williamson, a junior who
had been sidelined with injuries
early in the season, returned to
the fold.
The Cougars, one of the four
eligible competitors which in
clude Stanford, Ihrevv their hat
into Ihe PCC ring for a Rose
Bowl bid two weeks ago when
they defeated California, 13-7, at
Pullman. Oregon has a 2-0 PCC
record while Oregon State and
WSC each have 1-0 marks. OSC
isn't eligible to return to the
roses this year.
Coach Jim Sutherland made
two significant changes in the
Cougar line this week which ap
pear aimed at stopping the Cardi
nals' rushing attack, ranked sec
ond in the PCC with an average
of 210.7 yards per game.
Cougar Shifted
Ted Gray, a 195-pound center
and one of WSC's best lineback
ers, has been shifted to Ihe start
ing left end spot. Meanwhile, sec
ond-string lefl end Merl Hitzel, a
rugged 205-pound defensive man,
moves to center to lake up the
slack.
The Cougars have allowed an
average of 229 yards per game to
opponents on the ground, and the
Stanford rushing figure per game
is only 12 yards below that
amount, so Indian fans can look
for the rushing attack to function
well.
Last week, Washington State
dropped a 20-13 decision to lowa.
Sutherland referred to the effort
against the flu-racked lowans as
the worst game in more than a
season for WSC. But Sutherland's
remarks accepted, Washington
State still has the PCC's most le
thai passing game and the team
with the league's most porous
pass defense is none other than
Stanford.
Not only had there better be a
change in the weather, but there
had also better be a change in
Stanford's pass defense style to
morrow 1o paraphrase the old
song.
Lead in Interceptions
Strangely enough, the Indians
lead ihe conference in intercep
tions with seven and boast the
PCC's best picker-offer in Jackie
Taylor, who has intercepted twice
for 102 yards and one touchdown. !
With Taylor leading the way, the
secondary should hold its own,
but it will be the line's lask to
rush the daylights out of WSC
quarterbacks Bob Newman and,
Bunny Aldrich.
Newman, a 6-2. 190-pound jun- j
ior from El Cerrito, is the PCC's i
top thrower with 27 completions
of 51 attempts for 333 yards and !
Uiree touchdowns. His running
mate, Aldrich, the 28-year-old
flinger from Honolulu, has com- !
pleted 10 of 15 passes for 121 >
yards and three tallies.
Rush Passer
With guards John Clark and
Bob Peterson and tackles Troy |
Barbee and Eric Protiva applying ]
ihe big rush, however, passing
may become less than a pleasure!
for the erimson-and-gray troops j
from the Northwest.
The Cougars operate from the
slot-T formation and have won
two games while losing once.
They downed Nebraska, 34-13,
toppled Cal and fell to lowa.
Stanford also is 2-1-0 for the sea
son, holding a 46-7 triumph over
San Jose State, a 26-6 victory
over Northwestern, then submit
ting to Rice last week.
Spread end Don Ellingsen has
snared 12 passes for 149 yards to
pace the Cougars and the PCC in
pass receiving. Teammate Jack
Fanning ranks fourth with nine

catches for 111 yards and four
TD's. Robinson is the Cards'
best receiver with six catches for
85 yards and one tally.
Shea Leads Runners
Shea is Stanford's leading
ground gainer with 164 yards in
34 carries for a 4.8-yard average.
Valli ran for 118 yards and a 7.4-
yard average before injuries
sidelined him in the second game.
Fullback Ed Stevens has sparked
WSC's runners with 113 yards
j for a 5.4-yard average.
Last season, the Indians belted
the Cougars, 40-26, but those two
men—Newman and Aldrich—had
a hand in all four scores. New
: man threw one TD pass and set
I up two more with aerials while
! Aldrich scored the other one on
! a sneak.
