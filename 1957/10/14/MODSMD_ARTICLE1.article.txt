## Youth Group Project Gratifying to House; May Repeat in Future 
### 
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity en
tertained 28 underprivileged 9- to
13-year-old boys from the Red
Shield Youth Association of San
Francisco the past week end, in a
football-Saturday highlighted by
the WSC-Stanford game.
The boys arrived from San
Francisco by bus at the Fiji house
at 11 a.m. and entered a rousing
session of football, baseball and
volleyball on the house lawn.
After lunch with the fraternity
men in their barbecue area, all 28
trooped off to the game, where
they s;it with the Fijis in their
own very noisy rooting section.
Dinner at House
After one temporarily lost boy
was retrieved from the post-game
crowd, the group had dinner back
at the house. The boys then re
turned by bus to San Francisco,
leaving an exhausted but pleased
Fiji house behind.
House president Tom Wilson,
Harvey Christensen and Jerry
Beanie headed arrangements for
the day's activities.
Christensen reported talking
with the youth association's pro
gram director, Robert Amiek, who
told him that the boys seldom
have opportunity of outside con
tacts like last Saturday's. He
hoped this program might be the
first of other similarly enjoyable
and broadening experiences foi
them.
First Game for Some
For many of the youngsters it
was their first football game. One
of the fraternity men took binocu
lars to the game, and these were
the object of great interest, said
Beatie. Most of the kids had never
looked through binoculars before.
Christensen said: "If the kids'
appetites and energy were any in
dication of their interest, then I
think the day was a success. After
they left, the house was unani
mous in oUr hopes of having the
kids again soon, and I know we
all enjoyed the day very much."
The Fijis were directed to the
association by the San Francisco
Jaycees when the former began
making inquiries into the possi
bilities of a program like Satur
day's. Christensen said the house
hopes to implement similar proj
ects in the future.

Francisco the past week end, in a
football-Saturday highlighted by
the WSC-Stanford game.
The boys arrived from San
Francisco by bus at the Fiji house
at 11 a.m. and entered a rousing
session of football, baseball and
volleyball on the house lawn.
After lunch with the fraternity
men in their barbecue area, all 28
trooped off to the game, where
they s;it with the Fijis in their
own very noisy rooting section.
Dinner at House
After one temporarily lost boy
was retrieved from the post-game
crowd, the group had dinner back
at the house. The boys then re
turned by bus to San Francisco,
leaving an exhausted but pleased
Fiji house behind.
House president Tom Wilson,
Harvey Christensen and Jerry
Beanie headed arrangements for
the day's activities.
Christensen reported talking
with the youth association's pro
gram director, Robert Amiek, who
told him that the boys seldom
have opportunity of outside con
tacts like last Saturday's. He
hoped this program might be the
first of other similarly enjoyable
and broadening experiences foi
them.
First Game for Some
For many of the youngsters it
was their first football game. One
of the fraternity men took binocu
lars to the game, and these were
the object of great interest, said
Beatie. Most of the kids had never
looked through binoculars before.
Christensen said: "If the kids'
appetites and energy were any in
dication of their interest, then I
think the day was a success. After
they left, the house was unani
mous in oUr hopes of having the
kids again soon, and I know we
all enjoyed the day very much."
The Fijis were directed to the
association by the San Francisco
Jaycees when the former began
making inquiries into the possi
bilities of a program like Satur
day's. Christensen said the house
hopes to implement similar proj
ects in the future.
