## Problems of Education Discussed 
### Roger Folsom 
The Japanese educational sys
tem was drastically overhauled by
Occupation authorities upon the
recommendations of an American
group of educators who stayed in
Japan for only one month.
This incomplete survey and the
resultant hasty changes, together
with tendencies to believe that
'"democratization" of the school
system meant "Americanization"
of it, have resulted in serious edu
cational problems for Japan to
day, the president of Tokyo Uni
versity reported to a group in
Hoover Tower last Friday after
noon. The president, Dr. Tadao
Yanaihara, was speaking on Jap
anese higher education.
Before World War 11, Japanese
students went to elementary
schools for six years and then to
an intermediate school for five
years. A few who passed extreme
ly difficult exams were then ad
mitted to preparatory schools.
Some other intermediate school
graduates were admitted to four
year technical training schools.
Those admitted to the preparatory
schools attended for three years,
after which they were practically
guaranteed entrance to universi
ties for three years.
U.S. Occupation
The Occupation forced Japan's
educational system into a typical
American pattern of six years'
elementary school, three years'
junior high school, three years'
high school and four years' uni
versity education. The number of
universities was greatly increased
in order to permit all qualified
students to attend. The four-year
curriculum of the technical train
ing schools was given a liberal
arts-general education emphasis.
Japan, according to many, now
has more universities than she
can afford. University equipment
and facilities are in poor condi
tion. Faculties are undertrained,
frequently not qualified and are
underpaid, Dr. Yanaihara said.
Technical education, already
damaged by the liberal arts em
phasis given to the former tech
nical schools, is even less frequent
because the universities do not
encourage students to study in
the scientific fields.
Technical education is more ex
pensive than education in the
fields of humanities and social
sciences because scientific courses
require laboratory and scientific
equipment. The universities can
not afford this" equipment, so
most graduates are in the fields
of liberal arts and not science.
Job Difficulties
Liberal arts graduates find that
there are many more applicants
than jobs available in their fields.
Scientific and engineering stu
dents, on the other hand, are in
great demand because of their
scarcity.
Women usually do not graduate
with scientific degrees, and they
I find it especially difficult to get
jobs. There is some sentiment in
Japan against hiring women, par
ticularly when there are so many
qualified men available.
Entrance competition for t lie
universities is extremely stiff in
Japan, in spite of the great in
crease in the number of univer
sities. About one-half of the high
school graduates want to continue
their education, but only one-half
of these can get into any type of
college or university at all.
Competition to enter the best
universities is extremely difficult.
! Since only students really inter
! ested in an education arc able to
| enter universities, it is never nee
! essary to flunk students out. Fam
! ily pressure on students to do
well contributes to this situation.
