# Egypt Lands Troops In Syria; Reinforces Country's Defenses
## Turkish-Syrian Border Tension Named Reason 
### 
DAMASCUS (/P) — Egyptian
Iroops landed in Syria yesterday
for the first time in modern his
tory to reinforce this country's
defense against aggression from
any direction, a communique an
nounced.
The joint Syrian-Egyptian com
mand here said the Egyptians
disembarked at the Mediterra
nean port of Latakia.
The number and destination of
the troops was not given. The
Egyptian Middle East News
Agency reported in a Cairo dis
patch that they landed under
cover of Egyptian naval units
and planes of both nations.
Mounting Tension
The Egyptian reinforcements
were viewed here as connected
with mounting Turkish * Syrian
border tension.
Armed forces of both Egypt,
and Syria, long closely allied, get
their arms from the Soviet bloc.
The common source of their
weapons and ammunition should
simplify their supply situation in
any joint operations.
Both Syrian and Egyptian air
squadrons, which have been fit
ted out with Soviet planes, gave
the Egyptian naval units air cov
er on their way from Egypt to
Syria, the communique said.
Jt added that the Egyptian na
val units will begin "a formal vis
it" in the Syrian port today.
Mutual Defense
The move was taken under the
two countries' mutual defense
agreement which provides for
joint military action in the face
of aggression or the threat of ag
gression against either country.
Before the communique was is
sued, the Damascus press
splurged stories about urgent
measures to defend teh country's
independence "against any ag
gression from the north," mean
ing Turkey.
The stories gave no hint wheth
er Egyptian troops would be do
ployed on the border with Tur
key or on the Syrian-Israeli fron
tier, but said Turkish troop
movements were being watched
closely.
In Cairo, the dispatch of Egyp
tian units to Syria was viewed as
another demonstration of Egyp
tian-Syrian solidarity in the face
of American pressure.
From a military viewpoint,
Egyptian units would be of little
help against such a strong power
as Turkey. But the move indi
cates readiness to activate the
Syrian - Egyptian joint command
in case of renewed hostilities with
Israel.
The situation has been marked
by rough talk from both Wash
ington and Moscow.

mand here said the Egyptians
disembarked at the Mediterra
nean port of Latakia.
The number and destination of
the troops was not given. The
Egyptian Middle East News
Agency reported in a Cairo dis
patch that they landed under
cover of Egyptian naval units
and planes of both nations.
Mounting Tension
The Egyptian reinforcements
were viewed here as connected
with mounting Turkish * Syrian
border tension.
Armed forces of both Egypt,
and Syria, long closely allied, get
their arms from the Soviet bloc.
The common source of their
weapons and ammunition should
simplify their supply situation in
any joint operations.
Both Syrian and Egyptian air
squadrons, which have been fit
ted out with Soviet planes, gave
the Egyptian naval units air cov
er on their way from Egypt to
Syria, the communique said.
Jt added that the Egyptian na
val units will begin "a formal vis
it" in the Syrian port today.
Mutual Defense
The move was taken under the
two countries' mutual defense
agreement which provides for
joint military action in the face
of aggression or the threat of ag
gression against either country.
Before the communique was is
sued, the Damascus press
splurged stories about urgent
measures to defend teh country's
independence "against any ag
gression from the north," mean
ing Turkey.
The stories gave no hint wheth
er Egyptian troops would be do
ployed on the border with Tur
key or on the Syrian-Israeli fron
tier, but said Turkish troop
movements were being watched
closely.
In Cairo, the dispatch of Egyp
tian units to Syria was viewed as
another demonstration of Egyp
tian-Syrian solidarity in the face
of American pressure.
From a military viewpoint,
Egyptian units would be of little
help against such a strong power
as Turkey. But the move indi
cates readiness to activate the
Syrian - Egyptian joint command
in case of renewed hostilities with
Israel.
The situation has been marked
by rough talk from both Wash
ington and Moscow.
