# Stanford 'Kicked' to Death by WSC Gridders in PCC Opener
## Cougars Eat Up 18-Point Lead in 2nd Half; Newman Pitches TD in Final 44 Seconds 
### Roy Lawson 
"A kicker! a kicker! my kingdom for a kicker!" must have run
rampantly through coach Chuck Taylor's mind Saturday afternoon
when his Stanford Indians dropped a 21-18 decision in the last, min
ute of play to the Washington State College Cougars in Stanford

Stadium.
But it wasn't merely the point
call}', the lack of them—that cost
the Indians their Pacific Coast
Conference opener, for the Car
dinals had held an 18-0 halftime
lead and never trailed until quar
terback Bob Newman's fateful
18-yard touchdown toss to end
Don Ellingsen with only 44 sec
onds remaining to play in the
fourth quarter.
Overconfidence Understandable
That the Indians had reason to
become overconfident with their
11-point lead in the game's wan
ing moments was certainly un
derstandable. After all, hadn't
they scored three of the first
four times they handled the ball?
And hadn't they held the offen
sive - minded Washingtonians to
91 total yards in the first half
while gaining 235 yards them
selves?
Be ye assured that Stanford
ran and passed over and around
the crimson - and - gray warriors
from Pullman, but it all went for
naught in the fourth quarter
when Newman came off the WSC
bench and unleashed an aeronau
tical demonstration that would
have put von Reich's aerial cir
cus to shame.
Although Washington State
had cut Stanford's lead to 18-7 in
the opening minutes of the sec
ond half, even a "pigeon" would
n't have bet a dime on WSC's
chances to make that fantabulous
comeback when Newman first
took the controls in the final
canto.
Burford Intercepts
Only four plays after he re
placed Bunny Aldrich, who had
sparked the Cougars' first score,
Newman passed into the hands
of Stanford end Chris Burford
who returned the ball five yards
to the WSC 27.
When the Cougars regained
the ball on their own 13, they

after touchdown — more specifi


HE'S IN THE CLEAR —At least, that's how it looks' here, but ac
tually A 1 Harrington was caught after a seven-yard gain Saturday.
The play ocurred in the second period as the Indians were driving
for what looked like a fourth score against WSC. Harrington got
to the WSC 26, but the next play misfired as (he Cougars inter
cepted a Jackie Douglas pass.

wasted no time making retribu
tion. Indeed, Washington State
had little time to waste, lor onlv
3:33 remained to be played, and
the Cougars trailed by J1 points.
Right end Jack Fanning, play
ing very lilt Jo because he had Ihe
flu. took a quick look - in pass
from Newman on the first play
of the drive and made it the last
of the drive, shooting 87 yards
through the Indian secondary as
though there were a medic with
a vaccine hypodermic needle pur
suing him.
No. Five for Funning
It was Farming's fifth touch
down pass this season, and made
the score Stanford 18, WSC 13.
Newman then added the extra
point.
Friend Cougar wasn't content
to call it u day yet. Exactly 3:20
was left to play when tackle
Gene Baker came forward for
the ensuing kickoff. He applied
right English to the pigskin,
sending it whirling to the Stan
ford 47 where halfback Phil Mast
fell on the ball in front of the
Cougar bench. The onside kick
had never been performed better
and WSC was in business, the
touchdown business, once again.
Eight plays and a thousand
deaths for Indian fans later, New
man found Ellingsen free on the
two-yard line with a down-and
over toss that spelled defeat for
Stanford.
He Wasn't Touched
Ellingsen, the PCC's leading
pass receiver although only 15-10
and 159 pounds, never broke
stride in slanting into the end
zone.
Adding insult to injury, New
man again converted, the ball ris
ing like an infield pop fly and
barely making it over the bar.
The shoe was now on the other
foot, and the Indians had but 44
seconds to battle back. Valiantly
but to no avail they fought, Ihe
game's final play being a 14-yard
shot from quarterback Jackie
Douglas to a diving Joel Freis on
Stanford's 35.
The Indians had received fine
quarterbacking from Douglas
and Jackie Taylor and excellent
running from Chuck Shea, A 1
Harrington and Rick McMillen,
but it hadn't been enough to cor
ral the Cougars, whose runners
couldn't be mentioned in the
same breath with Stanford's but
whose passers completed 19 of
33 attempts for 328 yards.
78 Yards for Al
Harrington ran up and over
the Cougars like he was catching
onto a breaker in his native Ha
waii. The 6-1, 202-pound senior
from Honolulu drove for 7S
yards in 14 carries for a 5.5-yard
average.
His former teammate at Men
lo College, Shea, was the Indians'
leading ball-packer with 94 yards
in 16 attempts for a 5.9-yard av
erage. When Shea couldn't go
full blast in the second half be
cause of a bruised rib, Rick Mc-
Millen took over and amassed 62
big yards.
Newman Throws for 204
Newman, whose home town of
El Cerrito is less than 100 miles
from the Stanford campus,
passed for 204 yards, completing
12 of 21 attempts for two touch
downs and running his TD pass
string to five this season.
Stanford won the pre-game
toss, and for the first time this
season elected to receive. Twelve
plays and 56 yards after the
opening kickoff, the Indians led
6-0 with only 5:27 elapsed.
Fullback Chuck Shea slipped
off a half-dozen would-be tack
lers and ran 27 yards off left
tackle on the game's first play
from scrimmage to the Washing
ion State 29.
On a crucial fourth-and-three
situation at the WSC 22, Douglas
pitched to end Dick Stein for
eight yards and a first down on
a hook-back pattern. Harrington
and Shea then ground out yards
to the one where on third down
Harrington slashed into the end

I zone on a slant to WSC's right
| side.
The conversion attempt came
j to a violent end when the pass
I from center shot over kicker Tav-
I lor's head and was downed on
| the 30.
Rohhy Smothers Punt
Late in the first period, the In
dians scored again with Taylor
iat quarterback. Stanford guard
Noel Robinson set up the tally
by blocking halfback Don Eller
sick's punt on the WSC 17.
A 15-yard penalty for holding
; pushed the Cardinals back to the
127, but on third-and-19, Taylor
threw to end Jim Ukropina for
i nine yards and then to Freis for
j 14 more yards anil a first down
lon the two. Harrington bolted
j over' left tackle once again for six
j points with 40 seconds left in the
first quarter.
Halfback Dave Jones blocked
Taylor's point after touchdown
attempt, but the Indians led 12-0
in the first period.
Less than three "minutes later,
Stanford concluded their point
making for the afternoon when a
Cougar fumble deep in Iheir own
territory set up Stanford TD
No. 3.
Kidd Pounces
Jones returned tackle Armand
DeWeese's kickoff 18 yards to
the Cougar 30, but on the first
play from scrimmage fullback
Chuck Morrell fumbled and Stan-
I ford tackle John Kidd pounced
on the ball on the WSC 29.
McMillen drove over right
guard for five yards on the first
quarter's final play. Shea pound
ed at the left side for seven and
six yards, then Harringlon gave
Stanford a first-and-goal on the
seven when he bulled four yards.
Shea went the final seven yards
around right end, making it 18-0.
Doggedly trying to make an
extra point, the Indians used a
fake kick play with Douglas
throwing a flat pass to halfback
Jeri McMillin, but even that did
n't work, for Jones was there to
make the stop inches from the
goal line.
Ald rich Takes Over
Washington Slate began its
program of reconstruction early
in the third quarter with Aldrich,
a 28-year-old dandy from Hono
lulu, at quarterback. Aldrich
completed seven of 12 pitches for
124 yards.
After Ellingsen took tackle
Eric protiva's second-half kickoff
on the WSC six and returned it
to the 19, the Cougars marched
81 yards in 11 plays.
With a fourth-and-three on
Stanford's nine, Aldrich rolled to
the right and fired to left end
Tom Gray in the left coiner on
the one. Fullback Ed Stevens
then dove into the promised land
on the next play. Aldrich booted
the conversion, narrowing the
count to 18-7.
Late in the game, when the
Indians regained the ball or. Bur
ford's interception, they were to
drive to the WSC 13 behind the
running and pas receiving of full
back Dick Childs. Then the Cou
gars took over on downs, and
Newman and Fanning and later
Ellingsen put on their grand fi
nale for the 25,000 that braved
dismal weather and light inter
mittent rains.


IT DIDN'T COUNT — Chuck Slica would have
gained 104 yards Saturday against Washington
Slate il (his 10-yard jaiuit hadn't been nullified
hy a 15-yard penalty against Stanford for clip-

ping. He had gone from the Cards' 45 to the
WSC 45, where he was topped by Gene Baker
(7X). Shea, however, did pick up 94 yards on
his 10 carries to lead the Indian ball-toters.
