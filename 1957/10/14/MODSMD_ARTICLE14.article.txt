# Stanford 'Kicked' to Death by WSC Gridders in PCC Opener
## Cougars Eat Up 18-Point Lead in 2nd Half; Newman Pitches TD in Final 44 Seconds 
### Roy Lawson 
"A kicker! a kicker! my kingdom for a kicker!" must have run
rampantly through coach Chuck Taylor's mind Saturday afternoon
when his Stanford Indians dropped a 21-18 decision in the last, min
ute of play to the Washington State College Cougars in Stanford

Stadium.
But it wasn't merely the point
call}', the lack of them—that cost
the Indians their Pacific Coast
Conference opener, for the Car
dinals had held an 18-0 halftime
lead and never trailed until quar
terback Bob Newman's fateful
18-yard touchdown toss to end
Don Ellingsen with only 44 sec
onds remaining to play in the
fourth quarter.
Overconfidence Understandable
That the Indians had reason to
become overconfident with their
11-point lead in the game's wan
ing moments was certainly un
derstandable. After all, hadn't
they scored three of the first
four times they handled the ball?
And hadn't they held the offen
sive - minded Washingtonians to
91 total yards in the first half
while gaining 235 yards them
selves?
Be ye assured that Stanford
ran and passed over and around
the crimson - and - gray warriors
from Pullman, but it all went for
naught in the fourth quarter
when Newman came off the WSC
bench and unleashed an aeronau
tical demonstration that would
have put von Reich's aerial cir
cus to shame.
Although Washington State
had cut Stanford's lead to 18-7 in
the opening minutes of the sec
ond half, even a "pigeon" would
n't have bet a dime on WSC's
chances to make that fantabulous
comeback when Newman first
took the controls in the final
canto.
Burford Intercepts
Only four plays after he re
placed Bunny Aldrich, who had
sparked the Cougars' first score,
Newman passed into the hands
of Stanford end Chris Burford
who returned the ball five yards
to the WSC 27.
When the Cougars regained
the ball on their own 13, they

after touchdown — more specifi


HE'S IN THE CLEAR —At least, that's how it looks' here, but ac
tually A 1 Harrington was caught after a seven-yard gain Saturday.
The play ocurred in the second period as the Indians were driving
for what looked like a fourth score against WSC. Harrington got
to the WSC 26, but the next play misfired as (he Cougars inter
cepted a Jackie Douglas pass.
