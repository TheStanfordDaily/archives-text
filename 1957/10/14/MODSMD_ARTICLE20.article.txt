# How Come?
## 
### 
Tnr mo question around campus yesterday
was, "Ilow come?''
I odav's armchair quarterbacks are still vain
ly trying to answer I hat 64-dollar question.
Thev ve pointed to facts and figures, to that
nebulous quantity called "breaks of the game*'
and even to the weather and llie unknown pos
sible influence of "Sputnik," but 110 reasonable
answer has yet to come forth. The question
remains. How come?
It's all very good to sit back stoically and
sav. "Oh, well, il was just a football game."
After all, we are here primarily to receive an
education, pure and simple. Watching football
frames is just a little added pleasure. el all
the time we are saying this, a sinking feeling
lies in the pits of our stomachs and we know
lliat all we are doing is rationalizing.
So whv not come out and admit it ? 11 was a
lousy ending to what could have been a great
game for Stanford. No amount of rationalizing
will negate that conclusion, nor raise our spirits
to a happier level.
The fact of llie matter is we love to see
Stanford win football games. True, we don't
believe in accenting sports !<. the point where
lhe\ become detrimental to the primary pur

pose of our being here—education, We don't
believe in accenting sports to the point where
the ideals of amateurism are lost in profes
sional practices of recruiting and developing.
lint when we have a team with the potential
that Stanford's team has well, we expect great
things. Had we been overwhelmed throughout
the game by a vastly superior Washington
Stale team, we could have easily been philo
sophical about it, as we were about the Hice
game with its crushing conclusion.
Hul to have appeared vastly superior to
Washington State through three quarters, and
indeed a good part of the fourth, only to sud
denly realize, with less than a minute remain
ing to plav, that we had to all practical pur
poses lost the game —well, we were stunned;
and, with dawning realization, we became out
raged. Thus the question, "How come?"'
"Shades of Oregon State,*' are we to go
through another season like last year? Those
of us who are returnees to this campus from
last year are used to results such as Saturday's.
Hul what a shock il must he to the new stu
dents !
Let's not quit football, but for God's sake
let's have either a season of victories or a sea
son of losses—not a season of disappointments.
