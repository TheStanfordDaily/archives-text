"That's the way the hall

This was the reaction' of both
roach Chuck Taylor of Stanford
and WSC's Jim Sutherland in de
scribing the startling comeback of
1 he Washington State Cougars to
sink the Stanford Indians, 21-18,
in the final three minutes of Stan
ford's conference opener Saturday
at Stanford Stadium.
"It was nothing but Mother
Luck," said Sutherland. "Stanford
played a smart game. They are a
well-coached team and were up
for the game, but that ball takes
some crazy bounces."

The Cougar team was jubilant
over this victory but already look
ing ahead to the next game. "We'll
have to work hard next week in
practice!" one man shouted, and
there was general agreement
from the rest of the team.
Bob Newman, Cougar passing
star who threw the two last-min
ute scoring passes and gained 204
yards passing through the game,
praised Stanford as a team and j
said it should heat Cal, whom the;
Cougars beat earlier in the sea-!
son.
"We had no special strategy in
the second half," he said. "The
coach just gave us a talking-to,
and we got out there and played
harder." He singled out A 1 Har
rington as the Indians' best man. j
Praise for Jack, AI
Sutherland mentioned Harring-1
ton and Jack Douglas as outstand-1
ing for Stanford and also had j
words of praise for the middle i
linemen of the Indians.
For his own team Sutherland j
thought Newman and Don Elling
sen, the end who caught the final
touchdown pass and who was bur
dened with the flu, were impres
sive. He also mentioned Carl
Ketchie and La.Rov Rath for do
ing fine work.
There was no joy in the Stan
ford dressing room — but there
were no tears either. The atlitude
was one of quiet determination
and confidence in the future.
"I've never lost one like that
before," said coach Taylor. "Every
one on the team played a fine
game, but we lost—and it was a |
very uncomfortable game to lose."
"Year's Best Game"
Taylor lauded the team for their j
tremendous effort and said this
was Stanford's finest game of the
season from both an offensive and
defensive standpoint. He singled
out no Indian but said he was
pleased with every one on the
team.
When asked if he thought the;
loss of Saturday's game would I
dampen the Stanford spirit for
this week, Taylor answered, "The
boys know they played a good
game and 1 hey'll be up for next
week."
The key play was the on-side
kick that led to WSC's last touch
down, according to Taylor. His
boys were prepared for it, he said, i
but it was just a perfect kick. Jeri 1
McMillin had his man covered on
that last scoring pass, Taylor
claimed, but he fell down, so El
lingsen caught the pass unmo
lested and trotted into the end
side which forced him to sit out
most of the second half. Still, he 1
gained 94 yards for the day.
The Stanford rushing attack!
garnered 255 yards against the |
WSC defense, as compared to 62
yards that the Cougars could get
against the Indian line.

Don Manoukian, one of the mid
dle linemen that impressed Suth
erland, said he was more impress
ed by the WSC second-string line.
"They had more spirit and
drive," he claimed. "Their run
ning attack was not good, and
they just used it to balance their
passing attack and to try to set
us up for it."
That passing attack, with New
man and Bunny Aldrich doing the
throwing,, gained 328 yards. Stan
ford. with Douglas and Jack Tay
lor pitching, gained 136 yards.
Both teams gained 391 total yards.

The key play was the on-side

McMillin had his man covered on
that last scoring pass, Taylor

The Stanford rushing attack!

WSC defense, as compared to 62
yards that the Cougars could get

Don Manoukian, one of the mid

"They had more spirit and
drive," he claimed. "Their run
ning attack was not good, and
they just used it to balance their
passing attack and to try to set
us up for it."
That passing attack, with New
man and Bunny Aldrich doing the
throwing,, gained 328 yards. Stan

Both teams gained 391 total yards.

The Cougar team was jubilant
over this victory but already look

have to work hard next week in
practice!" one man shouted, and
there was general agreement
from the rest of the team.

son.
"We had no special strategy in
the second half," he said. "The
coach just gave us a talking-to,
and we got out there and played
harder." He singled out A 1 Har
rington as the Indians' best man. j
Praise for Jack, AI
Sutherland mentioned Harring-1
ton and Jack Douglas as outstand-1
ing for Stanford and also had j
words of praise for the middle i
linemen of the Indians.
For his own team Sutherland j
thought Newman and Don Elling
sen, the end who caught the final
touchdown pass and who was bur
dened with the flu, were impres
sive. He also mentioned Carl
Ketchie and La.Rov Rath for do
ing fine work.
There was no joy in the Stan
ford dressing room — but there
were no tears either. The atlitude
was one of quiet determination
and confidence in the future.
"I've never lost one like that
before," said coach Taylor. "Every
one on the team played a fine
game, but we lost—and it was a |
very uncomfortable game to lose."
"Year's Best Game"
Taylor lauded the team for their j
tremendous effort and said this
was Stanford's finest game of the
season from both an offensive and
defensive standpoint. He singled
out no Indian but said he was
pleased with every one on the
team.
When asked if he thought the;
loss of Saturday's game would I
dampen the Stanford spirit for
this week, Taylor answered, "The
boys know they played a good
game and 1 hey'll be up for next
week."
The key play was the on-side
kick that led to WSC's last touch
down, according to Taylor. His
boys were prepared for it, he said, i
but it was just a perfect kick. Jeri 1
McMillin had his man covered on
that last scoring pass, Taylor
claimed, but he fell down, so El
lingsen caught the pass unmo

side which forced him to sit out
most of the second half. Still, he 1

The Stanford rushing attack!
garnered 255 yards against the |
WSC defense, as compared to 62
yards that the Cougars could get
against the Indian line.

Don Manoukian, one of the mid
dle linemen that impressed Suth
erland, said he was more impress
ed by the WSC second-string line.
"They had more spirit and
drive," he claimed. "Their run
ning attack was not good, and
they just used it to balance their
passing attack and to try to set
us up for it."
That passing attack, with New
man and Bunny Aldrich doing the
throwing,, gained 328 yards. Stan
ford. with Douglas and Jack Tay
lor pitching, gained 136 yards.
Both teams gained 391 total yards.
"We didn't let down," Taylor
said; "they got Ihe breaks and
outscored us."
