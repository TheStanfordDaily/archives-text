# Frosh Cagers Begin Autumn Drills Tuesday
## 
### 
The freshman basketball team,
under new coach Bill Turner, will
begin their formal fall drills to
morrow. The first encounter on
Ihe slate for the Papoose cagers
will be a scrap with the College
of ihe Pacific junior varsity on
Dec. 1.
As far as Turner is concerned,
Ihe main task will be schooling
his potentially-fine squad in de
tense. According to Turner, many
of his prospects have played high
school ball which was primarily
of the offensive type, and did not
put too much emphasis on de
fense.
Many of the players are accus
tomed to a variety of defenses,
and will have to get used to Stan
ford's standard defense. The sin
gle post offense, as usual, will be
the backbone of the Papoose at
tack.
During the first week of prac
tice, Turner will hold intrasquad
scrimmages so that he can look
over the team hopefuls whom he
has not as yet seen. He is hoping
that those players who come to
him with fine recommendations
will live up to the advance bill
ing.
After cutting the team to a
workable size, Turner will work
more on fundamentals.
This year's schedule promises
to bring the freshmen up against
some of the strongest competi
tion they have seen in years.
Their second contest of the sea
son will be with the powerful St.
Mary's frosh on Deo. 3.
St. Mary's boast an extremely
talented array of cagers headed
by the amazing Tom Meshery,
one of the finest prep players in
Northern California history.
