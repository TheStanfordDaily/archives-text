### Associated Press 
The West's Rose Bowl football
team may come out of next Sat
urday's game between the Uni
versity of Oregon and Washing
ton State at Pullman. They are
among the four eligibles for the
Pasadena New Year's contest.
Defending champion Oregon
State, UCLA, Southern Califor
nia and Washington are barred, j
the latter three because of Pa-[
cific Coast Conference sanctions,!
Oregon State because the champ
can't go two years in a row.
Washington State whipped one
of the eligibles Saturday, over
coming Stanford with only 44
seconds to play on an 18-yard
pass from Bobby Newman to S
Don Ellingsen.
Oregon tuned up against. San
Jose State with a 26-0 victory.
Halfback Jim Shanley, the
Ducks' great broken field run
ner, ran 58 yards to one touch
down and returned a kickoff 61
yards.
This gave a pretty good pic
ture of what is in store Saturday
in Pullman â€” a good running
team against a good passing out
fit.
California's Golden Bears, with
a sad record of four losses in four
games, will find Southern Cali
fornia another hard hurdle at
Berkeley, although the Trojans
have lost all three starts against
Michigan, Oregon State and
Pittsburgh. Cal lost to Navy last
week, 21-6. The Trojans were
idle.
Oregon State figures to regis- j
ter its fifth win without a defeat |
next Saturday as it faces the
green but gamp UCLA Bruins.
The Beavers turned back Idaho
last week, 20-0, and UCLA van
quished Hie Washington Huskies, !
19-0. 1
