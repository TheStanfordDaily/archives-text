# Tittle-to-Owens as 49ers Shock Bears
## 
### 
CHICAGOâ€”Y. A. Tittles' seven
yard touchdown pass to R. O.
Owens with 27 seconds left car
ried the San Francisco 49ers to
a 21-17 victory over the winless
Chicago Bears yesterday in a Na
tional Football League game.
The Bears, defending cham
pions of the Western Division,
had appeared assured of their
first victory of the season when
George Blanda booted a 17-yard
field goal with 4:39 to go.
Tittle had different ideas. With
time runn in g out, he found
Owens on his knees but open in
the end zone and hit him with
the game-winning pass.
