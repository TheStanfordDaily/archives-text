# SOUTH AFRICAN RACE ISSUE
## Former Stanford Phi Bete Relates African Experiences 
### Margot Zeiss 
Mrs. Mary-Louise Hooper, a 1955 Stanford Phi Beta Kappa, re
ported Friday night her experiences and subsequent imprisonment
and arrest while working for civil rights for the native African
people in South Africa.
Speaking to an audience of about 150 at the First Methodist

Church in Palo Alto, Mrs. Hooper
was introduced by Dr. Alexander
Miller, professor of religion at
Stanford.
Dr. Miller read, in introduction,
a letter from the head of the
African National Congi*ess, key
organization in the non-violent
movement for African civil rights.
Speaks for Fund
Mrs. Hooper spoke in benefit of
the South African Defense Fund,
a fund being raised to support
men and women and their de
pendents who are involved in the
"Treason Trial," the trial of the
156 persons accused for high trea
son because of their work for civil
rights for the Africans and their
membership in the non-violent
movement.
In her talk Mrs. Hooper describ
ed conditions in South Africa and
supported with factual examples
and evidence her claim that for
the native Africans, South Africa
is rapidly becoming a police state.
"The police force is being used
more and more for political pur
poses," said Mrs. Hooper. "This
results in a terribly high crime
rate. Africans in the native sec
tions are afraid to leave their
homes at night for fear of gang
sters and toughs."
Growing Government
Growing government by minis
ters, whereby the ministers of in
terior, justice or native affairs
can issue an order, cause an ar
rest and have any home searched
through the power of their word
alone, is another indication that
South Africa is rapidly becoming
a police state.
Anyone working against apart
heid, the word used by the gov
ernment to describe its complete
segregation of whites and blacks,
is liable to find himself under
arrest, subject to deportation or
without ;i home or job. It is sig
nificant that this word is pro
nounced "apart hate."
The native African is required
to carry a permit for holding his
particular job, for living in his
native section, for being in that
part of the city, for being in the
city at fill and for many other
reasons. He is required to pro
duce all those permits immedi
ately when asked by police.
Democracy Lacking
"South Africa is not in any way
a democracy," said Mrs. Hooper.
"Of the over 6 million people of
age to vote, only 10 per cent arc
allowed to cast a ballot."
Mrs. Hooper is in this country
awaiting outcome of her deporta
tion suit. She was arrested and
imprisoned in March by an execu
tive order of Dr. T. E. Donges,
minister of the interior. She was
jailed for five days with criminals
and prostitutes with no charge
preferred against her.
Dr. Donges later gave as his
reason for arresting her that Mrs.
Hooper was actively associated
with the African National Con
gress, an action which ho did not
consider to be for the "true wel
fare of the native African people."
Mrs. Hooper looks on her two
years in Africa as the best and
most constructive of her life.
| When asked if she wants to re
j turn to Africa, she replied, "Yes,
! if the government will let me."
