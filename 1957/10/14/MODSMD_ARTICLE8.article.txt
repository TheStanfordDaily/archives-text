# East Germany Currency Shift Hurts West
## 
### 
BERLIN (JF)—Communist East
Germany sealed off its people
from the outside world yester
day while it pushed through a
blitz currency changeover that
cost the West millions.
In a surprise broadcast at 7
a.m. Prime Minister Otto Grote
wohl ordered the 18 million East
Germans to surrender their mon
ey for the new currency before
9 p.m.
Herding Citizens
Communist police and officials
immediately began herding
sleepy-eyed citizens to emergency
conversion centers in banks,
schools, factories and restau
rants to get the new bills at the
exchange rate of one for one.
Each citizen was allowed cash
for what he surrendered, up to
300 marks, about $16 at the West
ern exchange rate. The Reds
promised the balance could be
drawn from banks starting next
Saturday.
Western experts said this will
give the Stalinist regime a de
tailed accounting of the money
held by each citizen and open the
way for a new squeeze on what
little private business remains.
Old Issue Valueless
The old East German currency
issue of about five billion marks
became valueless — except for
coins and bills up to one mark.
As gun-toting Red police and
soldiers closed a steel ring
around the satellite nation,, un
told millions of East marks held
in West Berlin and West Ger
many became worthless.
For the first time since the
194S Russian blockade, tho Auto
bahn link between West Germany
and isolated West Berlin was
closed to German traffic. East
Berliner's were forbidden to enter
West Berlin. Pedestrians enter
ing East Berlin from the West
were picked up by police or ques
tioned and searched on the spot.
