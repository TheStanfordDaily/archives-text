# International Bank Head Lauds Capitalism at Meet
## Says Private Capital Most Efficient For Developing Backward Nations 
### Stew Toy Associate Editor, The Daily 
Keynote speaker Eugene R. Black, president of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, yesterday set the tone
for the opening San Francisco International Industrial Development
Conference by upholding capitalism as the force which can best
serve the interests of the free world's economy.

But ho warned the more than
500 business leaders from 61 coun
tries that "an entirely different
attitude toward the private busi
nessman and his functions in so
ciety" must he produced before
private capital can be accepted in
many underdeveloped and nation
alistic countries.
The conference, which opened
yesterday in the Fairmont Hotel,
is sponsored jointly by Stanford
Research Institute and Time-Life
International. Stanford president
Wallace Sterling is a member of
the conference policy board. The
list of delegates rea d s like a
"Who's Who" of international
leaders.
Black said lie is "as impatient
with those theologians of capital
ism who preach that private capi
tal can mept all the world's devel
opment. needs as I am with those
theologians of socialism who
I)reach that only state enterprise
can satisfy today's demands."
Pointing to the "strong tempta
tion to oversimplify" the problem
of economic development, he said
there is a place in every country's
economy for both private and pub
lic capital.
But he saw private investment
as the most efficient for filling
the bulk of the present capital
shortage facing many nations,

caused by the post-war boom in
which the world has been "run
ning so fast economically it is
now getting short of breath."
Black saw typical needs in eco
nomically backward countries as
roads and railroads, irrigation sys
tems and public health services,
water power projects and educa
tional institutions.
"The cost of these services is
enormous," he said. "... It is not
often that private entrepreneurs
can or will undertake these jobs
today—and where they will not
governments must."
Popular Pressures
But "democratic governments,
responsive to popular pressures,
have rarely succeeded in operat
ing directly productive industries,
particularly the consumer goods
industries, without wasting re
sources or failing to produce what
the market really wanted.
"It is not in the nature of demo
cratic governments, however well
intentioned, to fashion their deci
sions by the measure of profita
bility. Yet I know of no other
measure which can assure effec
tive industrial management."
Calling for an "entirely differ
ent attitude" toward private capi
tal investment, he said "people
must come to accept private en
terprise, not as a necessary evil
but as an affirmative good."
Drastic Changes
Black said he realizes this is
"asking a great deal—that it is
suggesting drastic changes. It will
take time to persuade people that
profits are not a measure of a
man's morality but of his effi
ciency."
Black observed that false na
tional pride often prevents accept
ing foreign capital—so necessary
to many developing nations. "No
free country in history has been
able to develop a healthy economy
and to realize its maximum poten
tialities without the foreigner's
help," he said.
"To deny him in the name of
nationalism is in reality to deny
the changes which are necessary
to achieve their maximum eco
nomic growth.
No Future Nationalism
"Nationalism in the underdevel
oped world, like state socialism
here, is not the wave of the fu
ture; rather, if, as I believe, these
countries really aspire to indus
trial development within the
framework of free institutions,
both state socialism and national
ism are the very negation of their
future."
Other speakers at yesterday's
opening sessions were board
chairman David Sarnoff of Radio
Corporation of America, Eugene
Staley of SRI, David M. Wright
of McGill University and Kingsley
Davis, U.S. delegate to the UN
Population Commission.
Time editor-in-chief Henry Luce
and SRI director E. Finley Carter
convened tlie conference, which
will continue through Friday.
