Editor's Note: The Community Chest is one of the few organi
zations to which Stanford Students are urged to contribute money.
We wish to illustrate the value of tins cause by publishing a state
ment by Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler. ASSIJ Drives
Committee is presently conducting the drive to solicit money for
this organization.

"Enlightened self - interest is
probably the first reason. Our
campus YWCA program is large
ly dependent upon the Chest for
the support of its activities. In
less direct but equally real ways,
Stanford students benefit from
living in an area in which there
are important youth agencies
which are financed by commu
nity-wide support.
"But there is another reason
which is of even more signifi
cance. Citizenship is not a mantle
to lie put on and taken off at
will. It is the way of thinking
and living which is learned by
practice. Along with Stanford's
goals in stimulating purely intel
lectual growth of students, the
University commends opportuni
ties for practice in I he art of liv
ing in a community.
"By giving to the Community
Chest in proportion to his re
sources, a Stanford student is
both improving the climate of
our University community and


making a valuable investment in
his own personal stature."
