The vaccine has arrived! Ed MacDonald announced at a meet
ing of the Student Health Council yesterday afternoon that 400
cc. of the flu vaccine has been received by the Stanford Health
Service. "This is enough vaccine to immunize approximately 2300
students," MacDonald told The Daily.
"We are setting up a tight time schedule and request the stu
dents to follow it closely," he added. Also, students are asked not
to come for shots after 5 p.m. The schedule announced is:
Tuesday, Oct. lf> 3:30-5 p.m. Freshmen C-Z

Friday, Oct. 25 3:30-5 p.m. Open to all students
MacDonald emphasized that there is ample vaccine, and that
there is no cause for rush.
At present the flu situation is brighter than it has been in sev
eral weeks. Looking back into his records, Dr. George Houck of
the Health Service pointed out; that there were 58 patients in bed
Monday as compared with 08 a week ago Monday, and 72 two
weeks ago.
"These figures would lead us to believe that the number of
cases is on the downward swing," Dr. Houck concluded, looking at
the patient graph kept for the past three weeks by the Health
Service. "An explosion in the number of cases is still possible but
highly improbable," he added.
The alumni of Encina Infirmary will be pleased to know that
their fellow students may not endure Encina's rigors. Dr. Houck
pointed out that with the decline in the number of cases, it is
hoped that Encina will be closed today or tomorrow.
