# FORMER FRENCH SENATOR
## Director of African Culture Magazine Visits Stanford 
### Jeanne Arthur 
Africa is ready to accept the
awareness of her responsibilities
toward the world, said the found
er and director of the French pe
riodical Presence Africaine when
he visited Hoover Institution yes
terday as a guest of the State De
partment.
Alioune Driop. a former mem
ber of the French Senate and pro
fessor of French literature at the
Sorbonne, gave up his political
activities 10 years ago to found a
magazine which would dissemi
nate knowledge of African cul
ture in Europe.
Presence Africaine is a bi
monthly publication featuring ar
ticles by African authors and ar
tists, sociologists, historians and
philosophers.
First Convention
In September of 1956 Driop or
ganized the first annual conven
tion of African writers and ar
tists which met at the Sorbonne
with delegations from various
nations including the United
States.
The European press spoke ex
tensively of the convention's de
cision that solutions to Ihe prob
lems of the world should no lung
er be thought out by the Western
nations alone. The Negro world,
they said, is ready to participate.
The dominance of Western
thought, according to Driop, may
be illustrated by the example of
history, which has previously
been presented in one manner
to satisfy the Western concep
tion of itself as the leader of the
civilized world.

The solidarity of peoples of the
world is a fact that trio world
must face, he emphasized. Inter
nal events of any nation, no mat
ter how small, may have reper
cussions which will affect the
total world population. Africa's
representation in world affairs
cannot continue to be denied by
the colonial powers governing
many of its provinces.
The continuance of France's at
titude toward self-determination
for her colonies in Africa, and
her support of that attitude by
military force, might eventually
weaken France economically and
militarily to the point where it
becomes an easy target for Com
munism. added Driop.
Future Possibility
Although the majority of the
people in France's African prov
inces are not now Communisti
eally inclined, they could be
forccd to embrace Communism if
the free Western powers should
fall to help them gain their inde
pendence, Driop said.
Since the United States is the
leader of the Western world, her
attitude will be the determining
factor in any United Nations ac
tion on Africa. In the present
world situation, according to
Driop, refusal to take a stand on
any world problem becomes a
negative decision.

they said, is ready to participate.
The dominance of Western
thought, according to Driop, may
be illustrated by the example of
history, which has previously
been presented in one manner
to satisfy the Western concep
tion of itself as the leader of the
civilized world.

The solidarity of peoples of the
world is a fact that trio world
must face, he emphasized. Inter
nal events of any nation, no mat
ter how small, may have reper
cussions which will affect the
total world population. Africa's
representation in world affairs
cannot continue to be denied by
the colonial powers governing
many of its provinces.
The continuance of France's at
titude toward self-determination
for her colonies in Africa, and
her support of that attitude by
military force, might eventually
weaken France economically and
militarily to the point where it
becomes an easy target for Com
munism. added Driop.
Future Possibility
Although the majority of the
people in France's African prov
inces are not now Communisti
eally inclined, they could be
forccd to embrace Communism if
the free Western powers should
fall to help them gain their inde
pendence, Driop said.
Since the United States is the
leader of the Western world, her
attitude will be the determining
factor in any United Nations ac
tion on Africa. In the present
world situation, according to
Driop, refusal to take a stand on
any world problem becomes a
negative decision.
Africa is ready to accept the
awareness of her responsibilities
toward the world, said the found
er and director of the French pe
riodical Presence Africaine when
he visited Hoover Institution yes
terday as a guest of the State De
partment.
Alioune Driop. a former mem
ber of the French Senate and pro
fessor of French literature at the
Sorbonne, gave up his political
activities 10 years ago to found a
magazine which would dissemi
nate knowledge of African cul
ture in Europe.
Presence Africaine is a bi
monthly publication featuring ar
ticles by African authors and ar
tists, sociologists, historians and
philosophers.
First Convention
In September of 1956 Driop or
ganized the first annual conven
tion of African writers and ar
tists which met at the Sorbonne
with delegations from various
nations including the United
States.
The European press spoke ex
tensively of the convention's de
cision that solutions to Ihe prob
lems of the world should no lung
er be thought out by the Western
nations alone. The Negro world,
they said, is ready to participate.
