# Federal Judge Denies Teamster Presidency To Hoffa Temporarily
## Restraining Order Given at Request Of Union Members 
### 
WASHINGTON (/!') James R.
Hoffa, battling a barrage of fed
oral court charges threatening to
loosen his tight grip over the
Teamsters, was barred yesterday
from taking over as the union'.;
president.
Federal District Judge Dickin
son Letts granted a New York
Teamsters member group a 10-
day restraining order against the
44-year-old Hoffa, the union's
president-elect, from taking the
reins from retiring Dave Beck.
4 Hoffa, due to face federal wire
tap conspiracy and perjury
charges in New York today, said
in Detroit he had "no comment
whatsoever" on Lctts's order, add
ing:
"Legal Matter"
"It's a legal matter and will be
handled by the lawyers."
Letts acted on the plea of a 13-
man group of New York Team
sters that Hoffa was elected at
the Teamsters convention at Mi
ami Beach, Fla., 10 days ago by
delegates seated to rig the voting
for him.
Godfrey P. Schmidt, an attor
ney for the rank-and-file group,
claimed more than 80 per cent of
the convention delegates were
shown by the convention proceed
ings to have been illegally chosen
under terms of the union's consti
tution to represent their locals at
the convention.
Effort to Cancel Order
Martin O'Donoghue, represent
ing Hoffa and the union in the
proceedings, indicated he planned
to go to the federal appeals court
in an effort to get Letts's order
canceled.
O'Donoghue had succeeded, be
fore the convention started, in get
ting the appeals court and the
U.S. Supreme Court to block an
earlier order of Judge Letts to
ban the convention from conven
ing- also on charges that conven
tion delegates were handpicked.
In his new order, Judge Letts
directed a hearing next Monday
for the Teamsters Union to show
cause why a preliminary injunc
tion should not be issued to bar
installing Hoffa and other newly
elected Teamsters officials.
