# MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
## 'No-Contact' Rule Unreasonable 
### Art Islas 
On a campus commendably lac-king in frosh
beanies, senior lawns, junior beaches, etc., the
* pgrogation of freshmen from upperclassmen
oerns very much out of place.
The position of the freshmen in the Stanford
Family is confusing, ranging from prodigal son
to ugly duckling. While no expense is spared in
: Heeling the most intelligent, well-adjusted high
school seniors for each new Stanford classâ€”peo
ple who should 1)0 able to face life's problems
fairly maturely when they arrive they are treat
ed like delicate, hypersensitive children.
They are housed with 800 other well-adjusted,
intelligent high school seniors and 30 semi-deified
upperclassmen as sponsors. Then they are told
they can have only the most limited contact with
the 2400 upperclassmen around them, under pain
of Con Home hours, for the next six months.
But after six months restricted exclusively to
their own society, the ugly freshmen blossom into
beautiful white semi-sophomores and may frater
nize as much as possible with whomever they
please. This is not an easy, natural transition 1o
make, and it seems an unfair handicap to place
on new students.
Segregation by age or class may be justified
in grade school or high school, but at the college
level it is unrealistic since it effectively cuts off
freshmen from the example of more mature stu
dents. leaving only their fellow classmates as
guides.
A two-step solution to this problem could be
made by the administration. First, a complete
dissolution of the no-contact rule, and, second,
integration of all dormitories. The two steps are
dependent on each other, but if carried out sepa
rately might allow for a more easily assimilated
transition. The present practice of not allowing
freshmen to join a club or fraternity until the
end of their first year would be retained.
Eliminating the no-contact rule while retaining
the restriction on joining would completely alter
the character of rushing. It would have to be a
year-long process, for those who were won in the
fall would have to be wooed again in the spring,
and no organization could hope to get a good
pledge class if it concentrator! all its efforts in
Ihe last few weeks of the year.
But, since few organizations would or could
maintain the highly artificial and expensive at
mosphere of our present system for a full year,
rushing would have to be managed in a more
relaxed, natural way certainly a welcome change
and a means of cutting down on the number of
de-pledging students. It would also be less of a

financial burden, since it could be incorporated
into the normal social activities rather than main
tained as an unpleasant necessity.
Integrating dormitories would be made an
adjunct to the University's present plan of limit
ing residence in fraternity houses to juniors and
seniors and by opening Toyon to all upper- and
lower-classmen. In this way there would be a
fairly representative cross section of undergrad
uates in each hall, and an incoming freshman
would have much richer and more varied con
tacts than Wilbur presently offers. And this j
would eliminate the greatest of all student trag- j
editys Ihat of awakening the sophomore year to
the many wonderful things that were unwittingly j
missed during ihe freshman year; a whole world .
of opportunities that were missed because there
was just no one around to tell you about them
or even where to look for them.
Such a system would also add a much needed j
supplement to the present lower-division advisers.
The freshmen would, in effect, have many ad
visers whose combined academic experience could
not help but be richer than that of any one per
son. no matter how well qualified. Rather than
having to rely on the little red book for course
information, or depending on an adviser for
advice about courses in another department, a
freshman could ask tlie opinion of students who !
were in the department or had taken that par
ticular course.
There would be advantages for upperclassmen,
too. Although some might object to living with
the "grubby frosh." freshmen would make up
only a small percentage of each hall, and, if not
surrounded wholly by their own kind, they would
probably act less like freshmen. They might act
as a very welcome stimulus to otherwise bland
dormitory life. And avoiding a year of all-fresh
men life would be some compensation. School
spirit would benefit from placing older students
in positions of responsibility for the development
of new students.
An all-freshmen dormitory is not consistent |
with Stanford's general student policy. Even
though there might he certain problems peculiar
to the freshman class, these problems dwindle
into insignificance at Hie end of the first few j
weeks. Wilbur sponsors will admit that the first '
quarter is the crucial one; after that, they are!
just sort of there. Integrating after the first
quarter could be a satisfactory compromise, but
the more rapidly freshmen are accepted as nor
mal students the more readily their specific prob
lems will disappear.
