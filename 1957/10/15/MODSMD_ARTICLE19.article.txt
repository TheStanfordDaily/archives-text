Editor, The Daily:
A few comments are necessary in reply to a
letter appearing in last Friday's "Letters to the
Editor" signed by one Randy Freeman. This
/Tonlleman needs to be brought face to face with
the serious implications in his words.
First (though least important), our friend is
apparently incapable of distinguishing the sub
ject matter of the film "Citizen Kane" from the
outstanding performance of Orson Welles in the
leading role. He might have enjoyed the movie
had he left his anti-Hearst, prejudices at home.
Second, if the Flicks bo at the bottom of the

entertainment scale, as our friend says, it is only
because he and others have placed them there.
At least, we are all glad 1o know there are no
lower depths to which student conduct can sink!
Last, one must indeed wonder whether our
friend's condoning attitude is representative of
ihe thinking of the Stanford student body as a
whole. If such defiance of law and order as took
place in Memorial Hall Oct. 6 be condoned by
students and administrative leaders as well, then
the Fundamental Standard is less than a worth
less scrap of paper.
R. Glover
