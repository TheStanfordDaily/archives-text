## Praises Prompt Action, Calls Living Abroad 'Valuable Experience'

"The idea was proposed to the |
General Studies Committee in
! February and the Board of Trus
tees approved it in September. I
know of no other university in the
| United States that would have
acted as promptly and as decisive
! ly as Stanford did."
Dr. Friedrich Strothmann, exec
utive head of the Germanic and
I Romanic Languages Department, I
was talking about one of his favo
! rite subjects the German branch j
j of Stanford.
He paused and handed a picture j
across the desk. It was an aerial
view of the mansion near Stutt
gart, the German countryside and j
the Farm-like foothills in the dis
j tance.
"The site was called to my at-1
jtention by Dr. Schumann, com
missioner of cultural affairs of
j Stuttgart. We felt that this site!
| offered two important things
; privacy and the proximity of a '
large cultural center."
Dr. Strothmann, who originated j
; the idea of branches of the Uni
versity in foreign countries, was
| born in Germany. He received the i
: Ph.D. degree at the University of j
Cologne and came to Stanford in j
the fall of 1930.
He continued: "The experience
of living abroad is an extremely
| valuable one. The question was
how this could be given to a large \
number of Stanford students, and j
| the answer was obvious—a branch !
of the University abroad."
"One of the differences between
the Stanford plan and programs
' in foreign travel at other univer
i sities," Dr. Strothmann explained,
"is that other universities just
send juniors and seniors and often
only those majoring in a lan
guage.
"By the junior year, however,
it is almost impossible for many
students to go abroad without get-!
ting into program difficulties
within their departments; where-:
| as during the sophomore year a ;
! student can still take time out for j
| two quarters of general educa
l tion."
"The idea was proposed to the |
General Studies Committee in

it is almost impossible for many
students to go abroad without get-!
