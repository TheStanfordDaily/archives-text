ship Committee, this is the first
time in the history of the pro
gram that a family has had two
! of its members accepted as For
: eign Scholars.
The Foreign Scholarship Pro
! gram at Stanford is sponsored
jointly by the ASStl and campus
living groups and is under the di
rection of the Foreign Scholar
ship Committee. This is the tenth
year of the existence of the pro
, gram, and there are now 10 schol
ars studying and living here.
Frank comes from Graz, the
second largest city in Austria,
and has atended the University
of Graz for the last three years.
He intends to return there after
his year at Stanford and study
I for his degree in chemistry. He
is now living at the Phi Kappa
1 Sigma house, but will move to
I other residences later in the year.
In the field of sports, Frank
has won many honors in both
[ Austrian and international com
petition. He has been a member
of the Austrian national pentath
lon team for three years and has
! attended world championship
competitions in Sweden, Italy,
: Hungary and Switzerland. At
j these contests, he won many first
I prizes in fencing, horseback rid
| ing, pistol shooting and skiing;
and two years ago, he was third
in the Austrian pentathlon cham
pionship.
Ski Prize

I school, he received the fourth
prize in the Austrian secondary
Isc hool skiing competition, and
the next year he won several na
tional riding contests, lie was
also honored by the Austrian rid
ing club which named him the
; best rider of the coming genera
tion. Two years ago, he won ev
ery possible Styrian fencing title

the result of national and inter

Life Differs
Frank finds university life
here very enjoyable but much
different from that in Austria,
j "We have no acmpus life at the
I University of Gra/," ho said, "but
; we have much more freedom and
I independence than American stu
; dents. We may choose the time
j of our examinations and do not
i have to attend any classes if we
: wish. I took a course in chemis
| try and did not go to one class."
According to Frank, there is
only one examination a semester
in a semester course or one a
j year in a two-semester course,
\ and all the examinations are oral.
However, this does not mean that
j Austrian students study less
| than American students, he indi
j cated. "In high school, we are
; forced to work very hard, much
i harder than we work in Ihe uni
versity; therefore, we are used to
j working when we come to ihe
i university."

According to Frank, there is
only one examination a semester
