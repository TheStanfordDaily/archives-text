# CAN'T RUA BACKWARD
## Valli Plagued Rest of Year 
### 
Lou Valli in all probability will
be unable to perform at full steam
for the remainder of the 1957 foot
ball season, Stanford trainer Con

nie Jarvis reported yesterday.
Hampered by an as yet undiag
nosed injury, Valli eannot run lat
erally or backward without pain.

Jarvis said Ihe injury appears to
be of an internal ligament nature,
hut th;it even this report is not
definite.
Whether or not he will be able i
to play in Saturday's game with '
Washington in Seattle will not be I
known until later this week.
Van Galtler Doubtful
The remainder of Jarvis* casu
alty report was also not encourag
ing for Stanford. Gary Van Gal
der, still suffering the effects of
a concussion suffered against
Rice, is doubtful for Washington,
but a definite decision won't be
marie until Thursday.
Center Roch Conklin, out since
before the San Jose opener, is still
bothered by his broken arm. The
break itself has now healed, but
nerves injured in the accident are |
still plaguing Conklin. He may be j
out. for at least two more games.
Chuck Shea's strained rib shows
signs of responding to treatment,
and he is expected to be ready to
go against the Huskies. Russ,
Steele sat out yesterday's drills'
because of a med school test and
an examination of his sore knee, j
Flu Touches Five
Five other Indians didn't suit
up because of the Asian flu—they
were either just getting over it or
were showing signs of catching it. J
A1 Harrington, Don Manoukian, !
Jim Ukropina, Bob Nicolet and j
Don Dawson made up the quintet. J
Chuck Taylor had his first two j
strings concentrating on passing)
and extra-point kicking yesterday,
while the t h i r d s and fourths i
scrimmaged.
Armand DeWeese and Jackie
Taylor handled the kicking chores
under three-quarters pressure
from the second team. Of 31 at
tempted kicks, 24 were good, 5
were wide of the mark, 1 was
blocked and there was 1 bad pass
from center.
