##

Tim Alexander has also shown
up well with his defensive abili
ties. Friday's scrimmage brought
I out a fine lino-backer in Art Spei
gel. Pie sustained a shoulder in
jury but should be back on the
job next week.
The squad is still working for
depth. As it stands now, a hard
running first team may develop,
but as for the second team, "It's
anyone's guess," says Ghilotti.
Several men are still not at
practice due to injuries or the
flu. George Honore, a Shrine-Hi
end, reported yesterday.
End Bill Cooper received a mi
nor head injury at Friday's
scrimmage.

First scrimmage of the frosh
eleven last Friday revealed more
potential first-stringers to coach
Bob Ghilotti. Definite first, sec
j ond and third teams should be
crystalized after a game - scrim
mage, probably with the varsity
third and fourth strings Friday.
Fullback Gil Dowd, at 6-2, 202
pounds, continues to show prom
ise. "His good speed and power
stamp him to be a fine college
football player," explained Ghi
lotti.
A good place kicker and field
goal kicker has been found in
Larry Meyers. Bob Harrison and
| Phil Toorvald look good at the
| defensive tackle spots. Left end 1
