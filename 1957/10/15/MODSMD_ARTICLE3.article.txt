SAN FRANCISCO (/P) — Tech
nological progress on a scale un
paralleled in history will be the
overriding economic factor in the
next several generations, Brig.
Gen. David Sarnoff stressed yes
terday at the opening session of
the International Industrial Devel
opment Conference.
"Just 10 days ago we saw a
fateful forerunning of this tech
nological future in the launching
by Soviet Russia of a man-made
satellite —an epochal event that
pointed up both the promise and
the perils of the years ahead,"
the board chairman of Radio Cor
poration of America told 500 top
industrial, banking and business
leaders gathered here from 61
countries.
Economic uoals
"The economic goals we seek
can be summed up quite simply—
we want to increase the material
well-being of all mankind in an
atmosphere of expanding free
dom," Sarnoff said.
"In attaining this objective,
technology can be a decisive fac
tor. For economic growth comes
from change, and change depends
upon scientific discovery and its
practical application.
Technology's Importance
"Without technology all other
resources would be economically
stagnant. With it all other re
sources can achieve startling new
dimensions of usefulness."
Sarnoff emphasized that the
scientific creativity that produced
the atomic and hydrogen bombs
also can give the world all the
energy it needs.
"It will, in time, be possible for
us to extract atomic fuel from
relatively inexpensive materials,
making nuclear power both plen
tiful and economical," he said.
