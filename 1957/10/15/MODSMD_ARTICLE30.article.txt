# P.A.T.
## 
### Frank Huntress 
You're llie Quarterback
Lei's play a game. Pretend you're the quarterback of llie Stan
ford varsity. It is fourth down with the ball resting on the two-yard
line equidistant from the sidelines. Would you call for a field goal
attempt?
That's almost the same position the Indians are in every weekend
when it's Point After Touchdown time. With the ball on the two
yard line why not run it over? We can't kick them; in fact, we have
a helluva time getting the ball set up for the kick. Often the ball
from center sails past the holder and the kicker and the try is com
pletely goofed.
They have tried to pass it—and failed also. The two only things
they haven't tried are running it over and drop-kicking it between
the posts. There is no need going into the latter as a possibility.
Writers have pointed out a hundred times the importance of the
P.A.T. Since 1951 the extra points have cost Stanford at least a lie
in six games while they have contributed to the winning of three
games. The wins were over WSC\ 14-13 (1952), UCLA, 21-20 (1953>
•and COP, 13-12 11954). Three of the six losses took place last year.
This year Stanford is doing worse in the extra-point department
as compared with last year. The Indians have made only seven of
15 P.A.T.'s thus far this year. Last year they attempted 33 and made
20. The Cards' opponents did equally as bad statistically -only 21
for 32—but the P.A.T.'s didn't cost them any games. This year Stan
ford's opponents hold an eight for 10 record. They've improved. The
Indians are getting worse.
Since the Big Red's running attack has been superb thus far this
year, running the P.A.T. two yards and one point would not be a bad
suggestion in the light of other attempts. The Cards did pass for one
extra point last year. An attempt 1 his year failed. Too many things
can go wrong with'the kick for extra point and all of them have
this year bad pass from center, bad hold and then, if Ihe process
gets this far along, a blocked or wide kick. Passing two yards for
the point takes good pass protection, a good pass and a good recep
tion.
Everyone Too Confident?
Probably the best reason that the kick for point after touchdown
has failed this year is because of over-anxiousness on the part of the
center, holder and kicker. They know Ihe record is bad and are too
desirous to correct it.
But with powerful runners like A 1 Harrington and Chuck Shea,
the many-times-proven-valuable P.A.T. could become a reality for
Stanford. Two yards last Saturday would have been duck soup for
the Indians on the ground. Against better defensive teams some
mixing of power with deception would be necessary to make the
extra point. But the Indians will never know if running them over
will work unless it is tried. It couldn't be worse than it is now.
And you never know—Stanford might initiale a new conception
of the P.A.T.—and win a few games.
SHORT AND QUICKIES: Last year's star end Carl Isaacs is
enrolled in the first year of the Graduate School of Business here. . . .
Paul Camera, flanker back last year, missed making Hie Cleveland
Browns this year. . . . WSC coach Jim Sutherland trained Jackie
Oougias and Ronnie Knox while at Santa Monica High School before
moving to Cal and Washington as assistant coach. He became the
Cougar coach last season. . . . Jim Byrer played on the same school
all-star team as Harrington a few years back in Hawaii. . . . Last
year's co-captain Paul Wiggin, playing great as defensive end for
the Cleveland Browns, was one of seven players ejected from the
Browns-Eagles game last Sunday.
QUOTABLE QUOTE: When Darrell Royal, late of Washington,
moved to Texas to take over the Longhorns' coaching chores, a local
fan was quoted as saying of multi-millionaire quarterback Walter
Fondren: "If that boy doesn't like playing the split-T, he'll go buy
it up and make you use a single wing."

the Indians on the ground. Against better defensive teams some
mixing of power with deception would be necessary to make the
extra point. But the Indians will never know if running them over
will work unless it is tried. It couldn't be worse than it is now.
And you never know—Stanford might initiale a new conception

SHORT AND QUICKIES: Last year's star end Carl Isaacs is
enrolled in the first year of the Graduate School of Business here. . . .
Paul Camera, flanker back last year, missed making Hie Cleveland
Browns this year. . . . WSC coach Jim Sutherland trained Jackie
Oougias and Ronnie Knox while at Santa Monica High School before
moving to Cal and Washington as assistant coach. He became the
Cougar coach last season. . . . Jim Byrer played on the same school
all-star team as Harrington a few years back in Hawaii. . . . Last
year's co-captain Paul Wiggin, playing great as defensive end for
the Cleveland Browns, was one of seven players ejected from the
Browns-Eagles game last Sunday.
QUOTABLE QUOTE: When Darrell Royal, late of Washington,
moved to Texas to take over the Longhorns' coaching chores, a local
fan was quoted as saying of multi-millionaire quarterback Walter
Fondren: "If that boy doesn't like playing the split-T, he'll go buy
it up and make you use a single wing."
You're llie Quarterback
Lei's play a game. Pretend you're the quarterback of llie Stan
ford varsity. It is fourth down with the ball resting on the two-yard
line equidistant from the sidelines. Would you call for a field goal
attempt?
That's almost the same position the Indians are in every weekend
when it's Point After Touchdown time. With the ball on the two
yard line why not run it over? We can't kick them; in fact, we have
a helluva time getting the ball set up for the kick. Often the ball
from center sails past the holder and the kicker and the try is com
pletely goofed.
They have tried to pass it—and failed also. The two only things
they haven't tried are running it over and drop-kicking it between
the posts. There is no need going into the latter as a possibility.
Writers have pointed out a hundred times the importance of the
P.A.T. Since 1951 the extra points have cost Stanford at least a lie
in six games while they have contributed to the winning of three
games. The wins were over WSC\ 14-13 (1952), UCLA, 21-20 (1953>
•and COP, 13-12 11954). Three of the six losses took place last year.
This year Stanford is doing worse in the extra-point department
as compared with last year. The Indians have made only seven of
15 P.A.T.'s thus far this year. Last year they attempted 33 and made
20. The Cards' opponents did equally as bad statistically -only 21
for 32—but the P.A.T.'s didn't cost them any games. This year Stan
ford's opponents hold an eight for 10 record. They've improved. The
Indians are getting worse.
Since the Big Red's running attack has been superb thus far this
year, running the P.A.T. two yards and one point would not be a bad
suggestion in the light of other attempts. The Cards did pass for one
extra point last year. An attempt 1 his year failed. Too many things
can go wrong with'the kick for extra point and all of them have
this year bad pass from center, bad hold and then, if Ihe process
gets this far along, a blocked or wide kick. Passing two yards for
the point takes good pass protection, a good pass and a good recep
tion.
Everyone Too Confident?
Probably the best reason that the kick for point after touchdown
has failed this year is because of over-anxiousness on the part of the
center, holder and kicker. They know Ihe record is bad and are too
desirous to correct it.
But with powerful runners like A 1 Harrington and Chuck Shea,
the many-times-proven-valuable P.A.T. could become a reality for
Stanford. Two yards last Saturday would have been duck soup for
the Indians on the ground. Against better defensive teams some
mixing of power with deception would be necessary to make the

15 P.A.T.'s thus far this year. Last year they attempted 33 and made
20. The Cards' opponents did equally as bad statistically -only 21
for 32—but the P.A.T.'s didn't cost them any games. This year Stan
ford's opponents hold an eight for 10 record. They've improved. The
Indians are getting worse.
Since the Big Red's running attack has been superb thus far this
year, running the P.A.T. two yards and one point would not be a bad
suggestion in the light of other attempts. The Cards did pass for one
extra point last year. An attempt 1 his year failed. Too many things
can go wrong with'the kick for extra point and all of them have
this year bad pass from center, bad hold and then, if Ihe process
gets this far along, a blocked or wide kick. Passing two yards for
the point takes good pass protection, a good pass and a good recep
tion.
Everyone Too Confident?
Probably the best reason that the kick for point after touchdown
has failed this year is because of over-anxiousness on the part of the
center, holder and kicker. They know Ihe record is bad and are too
desirous to correct it.
But with powerful runners like A 1 Harrington and Chuck Shea,
the many-times-proven-valuable P.A.T. could become a reality for
Stanford. Two yards last Saturday would have been duck soup for
the Indians on the ground. Against better defensive teams some
mixing of power with deception would be necessary to make the
extra point. But the Indians will never know if running them over
will work unless it is tried. It couldn't be worse than it is now.
And you never know—Stanford might initiale a new conception
of the P.A.T.—and win a few games.
SHORT AND QUICKIES: Last year's star end Carl Isaacs is
enrolled in the first year of the Graduate School of Business here. . . .
Paul Camera, flanker back last year, missed making Hie Cleveland
Browns this year. . . . WSC coach Jim Sutherland trained Jackie
Oougias and Ronnie Knox while at Santa Monica High School before
moving to Cal and Washington as assistant coach. He became the
Cougar coach last season. . . . Jim Byrer played on the same school
all-star team as Harrington a few years back in Hawaii. . . . Last
year's co-captain Paul Wiggin, playing great as defensive end for
the Cleveland Browns, was one of seven players ejected from the
Browns-Eagles game last Sunday.
QUOTABLE QUOTE: When Darrell Royal, late of Washington,
moved to Texas to take over the Longhorns' coaching chores, a local
fan was quoted as saying of multi-millionaire quarterback Walter
Fondren: "If that boy doesn't like playing the split-T, he'll go buy
it up and make you use a single wing."
