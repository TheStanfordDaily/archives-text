Japanese students seem to have
a much greater political interest
than American students, and their
political position tends to be ''left"
of the Japanese population taken
as a whole, stated Dr. Tadao Ya
naihara, president of Tokyo Uni
versity, during an interview yes
terday morning.
Communist influence among
Tokyo's student body is slight, he
said, and lessens each year. Stu
dents have been very active in
agitating against the presence of
American military personnel in
Japan and also are very much
opposed to Japanese rearmament,
although Japan now has no draft.
Dr. Yanaihara is in favor of in
creased contact between democra
cy and Communism. In answer to
a question, he favors student ex
change programs between demo
cratic and Communist nations,
sayipg that it is necessary to un
derstand Communism.
No Exchange Program
Although Tokyo University does
not participate in any exchange
programs with Communist uni
versities, her professors have vis
ited Communist China and given
occasional lectures there. Dr. Ya
naihara believes that the United
States should recognize Commu
nist China.
A Christian and author of a life
of Christ and a commentary on
the Gospel according to St. John,
Dr. Yanaihara stated that only 10
per cent of Japan is Christian,
but there is no anti-ChiMstian dis
crimination. Traditional Japanese
religions are practiced by many
people only superficially, and the
number of Christians is increas
ing.
There are both public and pri
vate universities and junior col
leges in Japan, he said. Public in
stitutions are financed by the na
tional government, but they have
maintained their academic free
dom.
May Not Dismiss
The government may not dis
miss, move to another position or
reduce the salary of any univer
sity professor. Only a university
faculty can take such actions, and
the professor acted against may
appeal to the courts. The faculty
also elects the university presi
dent.
During tho 19,'iO's Dr. Yanaihara
found it necessary to leave Tokyo
University because of his opinions
on the actions of the Japanese
government in Manchuria.
Japanese university teaching
I methods are slowly changing. As
: before World War 11. the bulk of
teaching is still via lectures, but
seminars for undergraduates as
well as graduates are more and
j more frequent.
Private Schools Short.
Only private schools are short
of financing for scientific train
ing. Public universities are rea
sonably well financed, although
increased defense spending has
cut into educational funds.
In addition to holding the presi
dency of Tokyo University, Dr.
Yanaihara is president of the Na
tional Association of University
Professors and a member of the
advisory committee to the Minis-
