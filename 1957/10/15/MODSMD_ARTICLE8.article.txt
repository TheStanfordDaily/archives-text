Barr V. Washburn, chief of the
employment division of the De
partment of State, presented in
formation and ahswered questions
from the floor concerning the U.S.
foreign service in a jam-packed
Bowman Alumni House meeting
yesterday afternoon.
Washburn discussed require

amination which will be given
Dec. 9 in San Francisco.
Dec. 9 is also the first day of
fall quarter exams at Stanford,
and those wishing to take the
foreign service exam who have a
Stanford exam on that date
should contact Harvey Hall. Ad

be made.
The application for taking the
foreign service exam must be fill

night, Oct. 28, in order to take the
December exam. There will be no
exam in June.
Recent History
Washburn outlined the recent
history of the U.S. foreign service,
beginning with the Rogers Act of
1924 and concluding with the 1953
Wriston committee recommenda
tions, which effected the incorpo
rating of the foreign service and
the Department of State. The
State Department is the biggest
user of foreign service officers.
Briefly sketched was a picture
of foreign service establishments
abroad, dividing the functions into
four main categories: political, ec
onomic, consular and administra
tive. The duties and obligations
of each main division were de
scribed, giving the interested lis
teners some comprehension of the
wide range of activities involved.
Pay Rates
Pay rates and classifications of
foreign service officers from class
8 to the highest, that of career
ambassador, were touched upon.
Qualifications for the foreign
service are many, Washburn stat
ed. Aspirants must take a writ
ten exam, one part of which deals
with general ability and back
ground and the other part a mod
ern language exam.
There is an oral exam for those
who have passed the written. This
oral exam gauges the personality
and character of the applicant,
judging his or her ability to repre
sent the United States abroad.
