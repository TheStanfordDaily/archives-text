# S.U. Student Tells Of Red China Visit
## 
### David Egger 
Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of three articles
on the experiences of Kari Itichard Williamson who was one of
a group of Americans who visited Red China during the summer.
The second and third installments will deal with the Mosvow
Youth Festival and Williamson's return trip together with the
legal difficulties incurred because of the unauthorized visit to
lied China.

Earl Richard Williamson, currently attending Stanford on a
National Science Foundation grant, was the first of the 41 Ameri
cans who toured China following the Moscow Youth Festival to
return to the United States.
Williamson and others entered Red China despite a warning
from the American embassy in Moscow that they would be liable
to loss of their passports when they returned. Williamson said that
he went because "I felt that Americans should know more about
China. It seemed consistent with American traditions and rights
that I should visit China."
For these reasons he assumed the responsibility of entering a
Communist-run country without the approval and hence without
the protection of the United Stales government. The trip was to
tally paid for by the Chinese, who even provided their visitors with
spending money. The Chinese government wanted young people
from countries all over the world to witness first-hand the recon
struction of China.
The train trip from Moscow across Siberia and Manchuria to
Peking took 10 days in all. The high points of the trip, Williamson
said, were the continuous and animated discussions between the
Americans and the delegates of countries from both sides of the
Iron Curtain. Arriving in Peking, the delegates wore free either
to take advantage of guided lours or to explore for themselves.
The Chinese whom they met seemed favorably impressed by the
Americans: by the heterogeneity of ihe group, by their informality
and open friendliness. Certain aspects of American culture fasci
nated the Chinese.

Two American folk singers in the group were in great demand
and an American girl who spent her morning sketching attracted
a crowd of onlookers, children and adults alike. The favorite sport
of the Chinese is basketball, and Williamson reported that there are
radio programs broadcast from Peking which promote an under
standing of Western music.
Several of the Chinese officials whom Williamson met had been
educated in the United States. A Harvard man is the head of a
trade union, an MIT graduate manages a locomotive factory, and
one of China's leading architects, U.S.-educated Dr. Liang, was a
consultant on the UN Building and a guest lecturer at Yale in
1946. Dr. Liang is typical of th,e dedicated professional men who
believe that they are working for a better China.
Dr. Liang, who estimated that it took the equivalent wealth of
700 farmers working ;">0 years to pay for his education, wants
greatly to repay his country. The educated men whom Williamson
spoke with asked questions about recent developments in the United
States. Frequently they inquired about the meaning of the recent
Supreme Court decisions as well as the problems of U.S. sociology.
Williamson observed that in spite of the tremendous amount of
construction going on, China is still a poor country. Such com
modities as cars, television sets and household appliances are far
beyond the means of the Chinese workers. The Chinese yen is offi
cially worth about 42 cents and the average factory worker makes
only 60-70 yen per month. A factory manager makes up to 300
per month, Mao Tse-tung 500 per month. One of the highest sala
ried in China is the opera star, Dr. Mai Lan-fong, who earns 0000
per month. Food prices are cheap, but clothing and other commodi
ties are priced comparably to the United States, hence the buying
power of most Chinese is not great.
In addition to touring Peking, Williamson traveled with the
group to Changchun, Tientsin, Dairen and later by himself to Can
ton. The group visited collective farms operated by former tenants

whose families had labored for generations as virtual serfs. The
land reform program was completed ahead of schedule. The land
lords lost their property and. according to the Chinese, were pun
ished by law for murder, rape, mistreating peasants and bribing
government officials. Now the farmers themselves have a feeling
of ownership.
The impetus for increased production on the collective farms is,
strangely enough, the money incentive. The greater the farm's out
put, the more money the workers are allowed to divide among
themselves. The income is distributed about equally among all the
farmers, but poor families are usually voted subsidies.
Williamson and the others interviewed Chou En-lai who made
diplomatic replies to pointed questions asked by the Americans, Ho
told the Americans that the only way for them to learn about
China was to look for themselves. When questioned about atomic:
weapons, Chou En-lai replied that the Chinese would like to have
them, but simply can't afford them yet. Williamson found little
overt antagonism toward the U.S., except for posters depicting
American nuclear missiles on Formosa trained against the Chinese
mainland. A much more prevalent poster was one promoting the
use of contraceptives in accordance with the birth control program.
Earl Williamson realizes that his 23 days in Red China do not
make him an expert on Chinese affairs. In fact most of his detailed
knowledge derives from reading American magazines such as the
Atlantic and information bulletins published by various U.S. gov
ernment agencies. What he could observe during his trip, however,
was that the Chinese did not grow two heads after the Communist
government was established, and that many Chinese are sincerely
dedicated to the enormous task of increasing their standard of
living through industrialization and collectivization.
Williamson stressed that "We Americans who have so much
shouldn't be afraid of learning about other countries. I fee] that
it is our government's responsibility to get people into Red China,
not to keep them out."

Earl Williamson realizes that his 23 days in Red China do not
make him an expert on Chinese affairs. In fact most of his detailed
knowledge derives from reading American magazines such as the
Atlantic and information bulletins published by various U.S. gov
ernment agencies. What he could observe during his trip, however,
was that the Chinese did not grow two heads after the Communist
government was established, and that many Chinese are sincerely
dedicated to the enormous task of increasing their standard of
living through industrialization and collectivization.
Williamson stressed that "We Americans who have so much
shouldn't be afraid of learning about other countries. I fee] that
it is our government's responsibility to get people into Red China,
not to keep them out."

Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of three articles
on the experiences of Kari Itichard Williamson who was one of
a group of Americans who visited Red China during the summer.
The second and third installments will deal with the Mosvow
Youth Festival and Williamson's return trip together with the
legal difficulties incurred because of the unauthorized visit to
lied China.

Earl Richard Williamson, currently attending Stanford on a
National Science Foundation grant, was the first of the 41 Ameri
cans who toured China following the Moscow Youth Festival to
return to the United States.
Williamson and others entered Red China despite a warning
from the American embassy in Moscow that they would be liable
to loss of their passports when they returned. Williamson said that
he went because "I felt that Americans should know more about
China. It seemed consistent with American traditions and rights
that I should visit China."
For these reasons he assumed the responsibility of entering a
Communist-run country without the approval and hence without
the protection of the United Stales government. The trip was to
tally paid for by the Chinese, who even provided their visitors with
spending money. The Chinese government wanted young people
from countries all over the world to witness first-hand the recon
struction of China.
The train trip from Moscow across Siberia and Manchuria to
Peking took 10 days in all. The high points of the trip, Williamson
said, were the continuous and animated discussions between the
Americans and the delegates of countries from both sides of the
Iron Curtain. Arriving in Peking, the delegates wore free either
to take advantage of guided lours or to explore for themselves.
The Chinese whom they met seemed favorably impressed by the
Americans: by the heterogeneity of ihe group, by their informality
and open friendliness. Certain aspects of American culture fasci
nated the Chinese.

Two American folk singers in the group were in great demand
and an American girl who spent her morning sketching attracted
a crowd of onlookers, children and adults alike. The favorite sport
of the Chinese is basketball, and Williamson reported that there are
radio programs broadcast from Peking which promote an under
standing of Western music.
Several of the Chinese officials whom Williamson met had been
educated in the United States. A Harvard man is the head of a
trade union, an MIT graduate manages a locomotive factory, and
one of China's leading architects, U.S.-educated Dr. Liang, was a
consultant on the UN Building and a guest lecturer at Yale in
1946. Dr. Liang is typical of th,e dedicated professional men who
believe that they are working for a better China.
Dr. Liang, who estimated that it took the equivalent wealth of
700 farmers working ;">0 years to pay for his education, wants
greatly to repay his country. The educated men whom Williamson
spoke with asked questions about recent developments in the United
States. Frequently they inquired about the meaning of the recent
Supreme Court decisions as well as the problems of U.S. sociology.
Williamson observed that in spite of the tremendous amount of
construction going on, China is still a poor country. Such com
modities as cars, television sets and household appliances are far
beyond the means of the Chinese workers. The Chinese yen is offi
cially worth about 42 cents and the average factory worker makes
only 60-70 yen per month. A factory manager makes up to 300
per month, Mao Tse-tung 500 per month. One of the highest sala
ried in China is the opera star, Dr. Mai Lan-fong, who earns 0000
per month. Food prices are cheap, but clothing and other commodi
ties are priced comparably to the United States, hence the buying
power of most Chinese is not great.
In addition to touring Peking, Williamson traveled with the
group to Changchun, Tientsin, Dairen and later by himself to Can
ton. The group visited collective farms operated by former tenants

whose families had labored for generations as virtual serfs. The
land reform program was completed ahead of schedule. The land
lords lost their property and. according to the Chinese, were pun
ished by law for murder, rape, mistreating peasants and bribing
government officials. Now the farmers themselves have a feeling
of ownership.
The impetus for increased production on the collective farms is,
strangely enough, the money incentive. The greater the farm's out
put, the more money the workers are allowed to divide among
themselves. The income is distributed about equally among all the
farmers, but poor families are usually voted subsidies.
Williamson and the others interviewed Chou En-lai who made
diplomatic replies to pointed questions asked by the Americans, Ho
told the Americans that the only way for them to learn about
China was to look for themselves. When questioned about atomic:
weapons, Chou En-lai replied that the Chinese would like to have
them, but simply can't afford them yet. Williamson found little
overt antagonism toward the U.S., except for posters depicting
American nuclear missiles on Formosa trained against the Chinese
mainland. A much more prevalent poster was one promoting the
use of contraceptives in accordance with the birth control program.

put, the more money the workers are allowed to divide among
themselves. The income is distributed about equally among all the
farmers, but poor families are usually voted subsidies.
Williamson and the others interviewed Chou En-lai who made
diplomatic replies to pointed questions asked by the Americans, Ho
told the Americans that the only way for them to learn about
China was to look for themselves. When questioned about atomic:
weapons, Chou En-lai replied that the Chinese would like to have
them, but simply can't afford them yet. Williamson found little
overt antagonism toward the U.S., except for posters depicting
American nuclear missiles on Formosa trained against the Chinese
mainland. A much more prevalent poster was one promoting the
use of contraceptives in accordance with the birth control program.
Earl Williamson realizes that his 23 days in Red China do not
make him an expert on Chinese affairs. In fact most of his detailed
knowledge derives from reading American magazines such as the
Atlantic and information bulletins published by various U.S. gov
ernment agencies. What he could observe during his trip, however,
was that the Chinese did not grow two heads after the Communist
government was established, and that many Chinese are sincerely
dedicated to the enormous task of increasing their standard of
living through industrialization and collectivization.
Williamson stressed that "We Americans who have so much
shouldn't be afraid of learning about other countries. I fee] that
it is our government's responsibility to get people into Red China,
not to keep them out."

Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of three articles
on the experiences of Kari Itichard Williamson who was one of
a group of Americans who visited Red China during the summer.
The second and third installments will deal with the Mosvow
Youth Festival and Williamson's return trip together with the
legal difficulties incurred because of the unauthorized visit to
lied China.

Earl Richard Williamson, currently attending Stanford on a
National Science Foundation grant, was the first of the 41 Ameri
cans who toured China following the Moscow Youth Festival to
return to the United States.
Williamson and others entered Red China despite a warning
from the American embassy in Moscow that they would be liable
to loss of their passports when they returned. Williamson said that
he went because "I felt that Americans should know more about
China. It seemed consistent with American traditions and rights
that I should visit China."
For these reasons he assumed the responsibility of entering a
Communist-run country without the approval and hence without
the protection of the United Stales government. The trip was to
tally paid for by the Chinese, who even provided their visitors with
spending money. The Chinese government wanted young people
from countries all over the world to witness first-hand the recon
struction of China.
The train trip from Moscow across Siberia and Manchuria to
Peking took 10 days in all. The high points of the trip, Williamson
said, were the continuous and animated discussions between the
Americans and the delegates of countries from both sides of the
Iron Curtain. Arriving in Peking, the delegates wore free either
to take advantage of guided lours or to explore for themselves.
The Chinese whom they met seemed favorably impressed by the
Americans: by the heterogeneity of ihe group, by their informality
and open friendliness. Certain aspects of American culture fasci
nated the Chinese.

Two American folk singers in the group were in great demand
and an American girl who spent her morning sketching attracted
a crowd of onlookers, children and adults alike. The favorite sport
of the Chinese is basketball, and Williamson reported that there are
radio programs broadcast from Peking which promote an under
standing of Western music.
Several of the Chinese officials whom Williamson met had been
educated in the United States. A Harvard man is the head of a
trade union, an MIT graduate manages a locomotive factory, and
one of China's leading architects, U.S.-educated Dr. Liang, was a
consultant on the UN Building and a guest lecturer at Yale in
1946. Dr. Liang is typical of th,e dedicated professional men who
believe that they are working for a better China.
Dr. Liang, who estimated that it took the equivalent wealth of
700 farmers working ;">0 years to pay for his education, wants
greatly to repay his country. The educated men whom Williamson
spoke with asked questions about recent developments in the United
States. Frequently they inquired about the meaning of the recent
Supreme Court decisions as well as the problems of U.S. sociology.
Williamson observed that in spite of the tremendous amount of
construction going on, China is still a poor country. Such com
modities as cars, television sets and household appliances are far
beyond the means of the Chinese workers. The Chinese yen is offi
cially worth about 42 cents and the average factory worker makes
only 60-70 yen per month. A factory manager makes up to 300
per month, Mao Tse-tung 500 per month. One of the highest sala
ried in China is the opera star, Dr. Mai Lan-fong, who earns 0000
per month. Food prices are cheap, but clothing and other commodi
ties are priced comparably to the United States, hence the buying
power of most Chinese is not great.
In addition to touring Peking, Williamson traveled with the
group to Changchun, Tientsin, Dairen and later by himself to Can
ton. The group visited collective farms operated by former tenants

whose families had labored for generations as virtual serfs. The
land reform program was completed ahead of schedule. The land
lords lost their property and. according to the Chinese, were pun
ished by law for murder, rape, mistreating peasants and bribing
government officials. Now the farmers themselves have a feeling
of ownership.
