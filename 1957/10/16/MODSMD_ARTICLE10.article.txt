# BIG GAME WEEK
## Begin Plans For House Decorations 
### Jack Winkler 
Living groups may start ar
ranging for their house decora
tions for Big Game Week by ap
pointing chairmen for the project
and deciding whether they will
decorate alone or with another
house, said Big Game Week
Chairman Steve Halsted last
night.
This year living groups will
decorate the fronts of their
houses with crepe paper forms,
papier-mache dummies, moving
demonstrations, signs or other
ideas instead of constructing
floats as has been done for the
past four years.
Cardinals decided this will
bring more Big Game spirit right
onto the campus and provide an
interesting attraction for return
ing alumni.
All-Campus
House decorations will be an
all - campus project, not one re
stricted to the Row. Eating clubs
will decorate their quadrangle
and all dormitories are advised to
dress up their own houses. Worn
(en's Row houses may go into
partnership with the less public
living groups in order to get more
decorations in general view.
Trophies will be given for nu
merous qualities of decoration.
There will also be divisions ac
cording to size. Decorations will
be completed the Saturday morn
ing of Big Game and judging will
be done in time for winners to be
announced at half time.
Early next week each living
group will receive a letter from
Cardinals and House Decorations
Chairman Dave Hendry announc
ing the theme for decorations
and for all of Big Game Week
and giving further details on dec
orating.

Big Game Week will start the
| Wednesday before the Cal game
with Button Day on which "Beat
Cal" pins will be circulated.
Thursday will bo "Burn the Bear"
Day" featuring the Freshman
Bonfire and a Senior Reunion.
Doug Brown is chairman of the
bonfire which this year will have
a shorter, more concentrated
wood-gathering period to elimi
nate the long guarding time.
Friday will be the Alumni
Luncheon at Bowman and the
final rally in the City. Saturday
[will be the decorations judging
j and living group open houses.
