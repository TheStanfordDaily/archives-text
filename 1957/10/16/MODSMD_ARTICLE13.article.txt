# 246 Freshmen Get Flu Shots; Sophomores Begin Series Today
## 
### 
Midst moans and groans, 246
freshmen received influenza vac
cine shots yesterday afternoon. At
the end of the day Student Health
Council's Ed Mac Donald told The
Daily: "Things have run very
smoothly all afternoon. However,
because of the volume of students
it will be necessary to change the
time to 3 through 4:15 p.m."
Mac Donald answered several of
the questions asked during the
afternoon. The dosage being given
at present will immunize for six
months. Both those persons who
have had the flu and those who
are now "under the weather" are
definitely recommended to take
the vaccine. A grim reminder: A
second wave of the Asian flu is
expected at Stanford in January
after Christmas vacation.
Meanwhile, the nurses' omi
nous "next" struck fear info the
heart of more than one freshman.
Chivalry camo to unexpected
bloom as many a stout - hearted

male let. his feminine companion
face the needle first. Although
phrases of the afternoon were
"Will I be sick?" and "Did it
hurt?" no fatalities were re
corded.
The Health Service issued one
last request: "Come early!"


OH, THE PAIN! —Prepared for the wor.'t, this freshman was one
of the first in line to receive Asian tin vaccine at the Health Serv
ice yesterday. Sophomores will line up today to receive their share
of the 400 cc. of vaccine. For the benefit of the faint-hearted,
nurses have reported no casualties as yet.
