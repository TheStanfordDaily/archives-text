# An Adult Doctrine
## 
### 
\I.MOST from the moment the freshman sends
his ;i|»|>li<*iiti«>ii fee to Stanford and receives
word of liis acceptance, In* is bombarded with
I.iris, fiction and propaganda about the Stan-
Curd Honor (lode.
Now, with midterms coming up all 100 Cast,
the natural questions arise . . . just what is ihe
Honor (lode, what are the responsibilities it
entails and. most important of all, how success
ful is it'."' Do Stanford sludents realize their
obligations under the (lode, and fulfill them?
These are questions that must he answered
}»\ each and c\crv one of us . . . not just the
student who is new to the honor system. Any
freshman could probahl\ gliblv recite the re
sponsibilities and meaning of the (lode, and
most of us might he a little surprised to dis
eover that this is a difficult code difficult in
the duties it imposes on us.
Its eas\ not to cheat . . . ourselves. Hut the
Honor (lode means more than the simple
phrase ''Thou shall not cheat. Its the "more
that is largely ignored b\ manv, perhaps not
deliberatelv hut merelv because it imposes a
.strict moral dulv on us one that is so difficult,
that goes so much against the grain, that we'd
rather not think about it.
'"I will report to the best of mv ability all
Honor (lode violations observed bv me." This
is the phrase tacked on to the end of the Honor
( lode which we sign on each of the blue books.
We also sign this pledge when we are admitted

to the I Diversity las a qualification for admis
sion) and again in our reg hook at the start of
ever\ quarter.
I he danger is that Stanford students see and
sign this pledge so often that tliev do so with
out reallv looking at the words or thinking
about their meaning.
As students pledged to uphold the Honor
(lode, our responsibility does not merely end
with ourselves. We are responsible for each
and everv other person in the room. The stu
dent who witnesses and does not report a
violation, or even a suspected violation, has
broken the (lode and is morally as responsible
as the cheater for the breakdown of the system.
A hitter pill to swallow? Sure it is. It's a
hard doctrine because it's an adult doctrine.
It goes directlv against the old grammar school
maxims we learned the hard way. \\ e all retain
visions of the runnv-nosed kid who "tattled"
to the teachers and was variously labeled any
thing from a "squealer" to a "dirtv rat."
Mul we are supposedlv adults now, and as
such should he able lo follow a system devised
to work for adults. Our inability to do so
classifies us as still being in the ""runnv-nosed"'
category.
If we admit that this change in our thinking
is impossible, we are admitting that the Honor
(lode is an unworkable and idealistic dream.
Are we ready to admit this? Or are we ready
to accept our duties as adults and as Stanford
students?
