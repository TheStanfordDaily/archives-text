l
Editor, The Daily:
Being, as I am, aware nf the fact that last year
you were vice president of the Institute of Inter
national Relations. I am not at all surprised that
you continue to have an interest in that organiza
tion; so much was, indeed, to be expected, in view
of the fact that interest in matters international
is likely, in general, to be found in lIR officers
'except for those who are only interested in being
"active"), and likely to continue in thom after
they leave the TIR.
Hut the personal interests of the editor do not
justify his taking, for purposes of news coverage,
;i certain "pet" unless the campus share his great
interest in that pet. And I dare say that the fact,
that "lIR Will Hold Social Hour" is not of such
importance or interest as to deserve the lead
position on page one on page one of an issue of
The Daily, moreover, the editdrial of which is
devoied to another aspect of the lIR, ending with
the suggestion that students avail themselves of
ihe great "social hour" dealt with in the lead
story.
Such use of The Daily as the propaganda organ
for a particular organization—an organization
but one of the many active on the campus is as

I
unjustified and wrong as it is ridiculous. If your
concept of a paper is of a publicity organ for
campus clubs, il behooves you to use it in behalf
of other clubs to an extent similar to that to
which you deal with the IIR; if your idea of a
paper is different, such a performance as today's
is absolutely inexcusable.
Lester O'Shea
Editor's Note: There is, of course, much
truth in what you say. I was associated ex
tremely closely with the lIR. But that was last
year. The Daily, however, is not a propaganda
sheet for any one organization; indeed, it is
not a propaganda sheet for any organization
at all. That an lIK story received top play one
day lavi week is true. But it is also true that
it was done so at the discretion of the night
editor for that issue.
Actually no one was more amazed than I
uas to see that story appear in such a promi
nent place. I say this only to illustrate the fact
that no policy of favoritism toward any organi
zation lias ever been initiated by the present
editorial hoard. Indeed, it would he contrary
to journalistic ethics for such a one to he pro
mulgated.

;i certain "pet" unless the campus share his great
interest in that pet. And I dare say that the fact,
that "lIR Will Hold Social Hour" is not of such
importance or interest as to deserve the lead
position on page one on page one of an issue of
The Daily, moreover, the editdrial of which is
devoied to another aspect of the lIR, ending with
the suggestion that students avail themselves of
ihe great "social hour" dealt with in the lead
story.
Such use of The Daily as the propaganda organ
for a particular organization—an organization
but one of the many active on the campus is as

I
unjustified and wrong as it is ridiculous. If your
concept of a paper is of a publicity organ for
campus clubs, il behooves you to use it in behalf
of other clubs to an extent similar to that to
which you deal with the IIR; if your idea of a
paper is different, such a performance as today's
is absolutely inexcusable.

Editor's Note: There is, of course, much
truth in what you say. I was associated ex
tremely closely with the lIR. But that was last
year. The Daily, however, is not a propaganda
sheet for any one organization; indeed, it is
not a propaganda sheet for any organization
at all. That an lIK story received top play one
day lavi week is true. But it is also true that
it was done so at the discretion of the night
editor for that issue.
Actually no one was more amazed than I
uas to see that story appear in such a promi
nent place. I say this only to illustrate the fact
that no policy of favoritism toward any organi
zation lias ever been initiated by the present
editorial hoard. Indeed, it would he contrary
to journalistic ethics for such a one to he pro
mulgated.

Editor, The Daily:
Being, as I am, aware nf the fact that last year
you were vice president of the Institute of Inter
national Relations. I am not at all surprised that
you continue to have an interest in that organiza
tion; so much was, indeed, to be expected, in view
of the fact that interest in matters international
is likely, in general, to be found in lIR officers
'except for those who are only interested in being
"active"), and likely to continue in thom after
they leave the TIR.
Hut the personal interests of the editor do not
justify his taking, for purposes of news coverage,
;i certain "pet" unless the campus share his great
interest in that pet. And I dare say that the fact,
