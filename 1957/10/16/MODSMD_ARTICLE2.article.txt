### Camille Petersen 
Sh-h-h! The house lights dim. The curtain opens. "There's not
going to be a Trojan war, Cassandra!"
So will open the 1957-58 season of the distinguished Stanford Play
ers.
The Players is the performing section of the Speech and Drama

Department and had its beginning
under the first head of the depart
ment, Dr. Hubert Heffner. Under
his long direction the group
achieved, and has since maintain
ed, a reputation unparalleled on
the West Coast.
Strickland Head
For many years the group has
i been under the direction of Dr. F.
i Cowies Strickland, who is at pres
! ent on leave helping to form a de
j partment in Finland. Robert Dier-
I lam of Queens College, Flushing,
I N.Y., is taking his place.
' An aim of the organization is
; to give Stanford University audi
ences plays of unusual caliber,
produced with the best technical
facilities at their disposal, and
with graduate and undergraduate
actors of ability.
The plays are open to all stu
dents of the University, with op
portunities to act or work back
stage with or without credit.
Open to All
Through the choosing of plays,
: the department tries to include
' good training in dramatic litera
ture as well as to teach good dra
matic technique. Immediate
j Broadway successes are avoided.
| Plays by contemporary authors
are selected, and over the years a
good representation of occidental
drama is presented.
This year the Stanford Players
are going to present their first
children's show, "Magic in the
Sky"; first outdoor production,
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," at Frost Amphi
theater; and their first attempt of
Play rehearsals usually last
four weeks. The cast, except the
major roles, is not required every
night until the last two weeks and
for dress rehearsal and perform
ances. Credit from one to three
I units may be earned for working
on a show. All except those on
the crew may put in their time
at their convenience.
