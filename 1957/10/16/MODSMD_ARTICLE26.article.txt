### Jack Rannells 
For some reason becoming less clear daily, in past years I have
been willing to give student tans more credit for perceiving a clear
picture of the Stanford football scene than San Francisco sports
writers.
Events lasl Saturday and ensuing comments, both verbal and
written, by the Cily press and local scholars leave more than a little
doubt in my mind as to the clearness of my own perception.
The first thing I was greeted with following Saturday's game was
a barrage of testimony that Stanford had lain flown and played deaf!
throughout the second half and that Washington State surely de
served the victory.
i was left aghast. A seat in the stadium is not so removed
from a seat on the sideline that anyone could have gained an im
pression of the contest at such variance with my own, I felt.
I had seen a great tragedy, with the men of Taylor completely
dominating 5(5 minutes and 35 seconds of a game they went into
given a 50-50 chance to winâ€”and then losing it in the final 3 min
utes and 25 seconds.
But Monday and Tuesday I heard those same stories again.
The Fans Didn't See Everything
Perhaps, I thought, they really did see something up there that
I missed. Or maybe I was lucky enough to see some things that
they missed.
Like Chuck Shea slowly walking away from the 1(1 a.m. training
lahle pre-game breakfast, trying his best to hide a decided limp.
And later, in the squad room after the warm-up session, the same.
Shea answering Chuck Taylor's query, "Shea, how's that leg?"
"Good, coach," he answered.
"Good enough to go full speed?"
"You bet."
And the same routine with Taylor and ailing end Dick Stein, with
Chuck capping it, "0.K., Stein, you'll start today. Douglas, how did
you feel out there?"
'"Good," Jackie answered. And then, even more enthusiastically,
"Hitchin', coach. Bitchin'."
(jj* they might have missed valiant Jack Taylor, a two-way Iwo
position man throughout most of the afternoon, fallen on the side
lines with a severe leg cramp in the third quarter.
And the injured Douglas signaling the bench that he wanted to
stay in on defense because he knew that his stand-in, Taylor, al
though returned to action, was incapacitated.
Mine might be called the emotional viewpoint. But I cannot be
lieve the tacts of the contest negate my interpretation.
Indian Attack Matched ('ongars
Final statistics indicate that both teams ended the game with 391
total yards on offense. "There," I was told. "See, they vastly out
played us in the second half."
Washington State gained only IG6 yards in the remainder of the
half. Stanford picked up approximately 150 yards during Ihe same
time-span.
The Indians, then, did not lie down and die throughout the second
half. They played on equal terms with a team with which they were
expected to play on equal terms. That is, until the fatal jump pass
with three minutes and 25 seconds remaining.
What happened at that juncture is anyone's guess.
Maybe the lads in the stands cannot get as emotionally involved
(in the same way) as those on the field. Maybe they should not.
However, 1 would like to leave them with two points.
Rice, WSC Games Different
First, the WSC game was not the Rice game. It is unfortunate
that Cardinals did not sponsor the Rice game movies as they have
done in the past.
Against Rice, the Indians tackled and missed with heads down;
got moved out, knocked down and kicked around like they had never
played the game before; and were stymied in their own mess.
They toiler! all week while fighting the flu, and Saturday they
did the kicking around. Two hundred fifty-five yards rushing and
130 passing is one heck of an offensive show, and the Indian defense
was superlative (especially considering the pin-point passing they
faced* until the psychological coin turned.
Coach Taylor was not kidding when he called this the Indians'
lies! game, and only was at a loss to explain why the Cards did not
win.
His problem this week will be two-fold. First, he must convince
Ihe Indians that by playing their best they can beat Washington.
And second, he must get them to play their best after letling them
know how pleased he was with last week's performance. The Wash
ington game is most certainly not the Washington State game.
The second point is that the 1957 Indian varsity is not the 1956
Indian varsity or any other for that matter.
Unless student fans are able to comprehend this before their
mild hysteria spreads to the City press (which was surprisingly sym
pathetic in its coverage of that great tragedy) and then to the team,
they are liable to arouse once again the fatalism that crippled the
Indians last season.
The squad sage, Don Manoukian, may have summed up the In
dians' present position Saturday when in the quiet of the post-game
dressing room he said. "Aw, come on, you guys, we've got six more
teams to r.f."
