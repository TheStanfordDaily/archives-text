# MOORE RETURNS
## Swim Team Opens Drills; Undefeated Season Seen 
### Bill Milam 
Willi glowing prospects ahead for this year and a bumper crop
ot freshmen to make things bright in future years, the Stanford
swimming team under Coach Tom Haynie is settling down lo rigor
ous practice this fall.
Leading the varsity team this year are Robin Moore, back after

laying out last year, and Gary
Weaver, a transfer student from
Australia. Around this nucleus
coach Haynie will build what he
confidently predicts will be an un
defeated team.
Weaver specializes in the breast
stroke. He was one of ihe out
â€¢ landing swimmers in Australia
and came within a very few yards
ol representing his country at the
1950 Olympic Games.
This year's outstanding frosh
include .Jim Cooper, John Jurgen
> en, Bob Owen, George Harrison.
Mike Zeller, Charles Raven and
Steve Jackson.
National Prep Mark
Jurgensen, from Los Angeles,
set the national interscholastic
prop school record in the 100-
yard butterfly last year of 57.4
seconds. He has also swum the
100-yard free style in 52.4.
Another champion last year
was Jackson, from Laguna Beach,
who, while swimming for Decr
field Academy, won ihe national
interscholastic diving crown.

Harrison, from Berkeley, made
the U.S. Olympic squad and par
ticipated in the 800-meter free
style and was a member of the
150-yard medley team.
Owen (San Jose), Zeller (San
Anselmoi and Raven (San Fran
cisco via Exeter Prep School) are
classed as sprinters, while Cooper
(Tucson, Ariz.) is an all-around
swimmer who is best in the breast
stroke.
90 Long Miles
Haynie is planning to have the
I earn swim 90 miles before Christ
mas vacation. This is approxi
mately two miles a day. The em
ph a sis will be on correcting
strokes and weeding out other dif
ficulties.
Though Haynie has gone on
record to predict an undefeated
season, he expects quite a bit of
trouble from USC and Cal. To go
with Moore and Weaver this year
he has men from last year's frosh
squad whom he believes will
make this year's team better than
the 1957 squad.
