# Air Defense Problem Remains Unresolved
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford goes into its third day
j ington game with one big proble
j problem pass defense.
Yesterday the Indian fourth-sti
patterns against the first three tt
j effectively as Stanford's fourths, 1
then they may not have too much |
I trouble in rolling up lots of
points.
Time and again men were in
the clear for easy 10-, 20- and 30- j
yard gains in the early afternoon j
pass drills.
The situation improved later on j
| when the blue-shirts started to i
j mix up the Huskie plays and were j
'met by an all-out second-team de-
I fense.
Second Team Impresses
After a couple of touchdown
sprints the second-stringers light
' ened up considerably and stopped
| most, of the running game cold,
1 along with breaking up a fair per
centage of the passes,
j On offense the Tribe concen-
I trated on finesse and timing, with j
! no heavy contact work. Jackie!
Douglas, still working out in I
sweat clothes, did plenty of pass
| ing and was hitting the mark with ;
a good degree of regularity.
Injury Status Same
The injury situation remained
about, the same. Lou Valli and
I Gary Van Galder were both on |
| hand, but neither suited up. Con-j
i nie Jarvis said the status of both
for the Saturday encounter in Se-j
attle was still unknown.
Chuck Shea worked out in
sweats but appeared to be having
trouble running all out on his bad
leg. He's expected to be in good
shape by Saturday, however.
Flu Takes Toll
Al Harrington managed to
shake the flu bug that had threat
ened him, and was working out
at full steam. Don Manoukian,
another flu victim, suited up but!
didn't engage in any work. Jeri 1

/ of practice for Saturday's Wash
■m still apparently unsolved. The
ringers ran Washington offensive
earns. If the Huskies can pass as
| McMillin also sat out because of
: the flu.
The Stanford party will leave
: for Seattle Friday at 11 a.m. from
San Francisco International Air
port. The team will return here
! immediately following the game.

Time and again men were in

sweat clothes, did plenty of pass

a good degree of regularity.
Injury Status Same
The injury situation remained
about, the same. Lou Valli and
I Gary Van Galder were both on |

for the Saturday encounter in Se-j

Chuck Shea worked out in
sweats but appeared to be having
trouble running all out on his bad
leg. He's expected to be in good
shape by Saturday, however.
Flu Takes Toll
Al Harrington managed to
shake the flu bug that had threat

at full steam. Don Manoukian,
another flu victim, suited up but!
didn't engage in any work. Jeri 1
