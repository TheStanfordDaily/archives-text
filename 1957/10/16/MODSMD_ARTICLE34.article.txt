# Hungarian Refugee George Domolky Tells of Revolution, Compares Cultures
## Student Now U.S. Saber Champion 
### Sutter Gardanier 
George Domolky, junior saber
fencing champion of Hungary,
represented t he state of California
in fencing this year. He and his
two teammates won the national
saber championship of the United
States. This is the first time in
fencing history that the West
Coast has beaten the East.
A Hungarian refugee, Domolky
is now a senior majoring in eco
nomics at Stanford and is living
in Toyon Hall. He is starting his
first year of college in the United
States and is here on an athletic
scholarship.
Domolky was a student at the
University of Budapest, which
was involved in the uprising last
November. Three weeks after the
revolt ho left the country.
After three days of walking, he
and another college student reach
ed a river which marked the Hun
garian border. There they found
a family in the forest who were
nearly frozen. They helped the
family across the river, Domolky
making two trips across carrying
the children.
"These uprisings show the peo
ple of the world what the Hun
garians want," he remarked.
"They want freedom of the press
and of speech."
According to him, their actions
represent the feelings of the rest
of the Russian satellite states, as
does that of the recent Polish oc
currence.
"The Russians have been trying
to win the sympathy of youth,"
he says, "but havent' been able
to." Before the Communists came
into control, the students had de
mocracy in the schools. After
wards, the Communist party took
over and stopped this.
Asked about the Voice of Amer
ica, he said the Hungarians listen
often to the broadcasts. But dur
ing the revolution they were dis
appointed in it because it kept
promising help that never came.
Domolky traveled to the United
States as one of the 38-member
Hungarian Athletes Freedom
Tour sponsored by Sports Illus
trated. They toured 35 cities and
also visited several universities,
including Princeton, Notre Dame
and the University of Pennsyl
vania.
In March he came to Los Gatos.
There he began learning English,
since in the team they did not
have to speak it. During the
spring he took a course in English
at the high school there.

"Girls have helped me a lot
with my English," he said. "They
are like dictionaries on two feet."
He is impressed with the Jiving
standards in America. It seems
to him that everyone has a car,
even the college students. In Hun
gary very few people have cars,
he remarked.
His favorite city is San Fran
cisco—the people are so friendly
and the scenery is so beautiful.
Another thing he noticed was the j
happiness of youth. "I could sec j
it in their eyes," he said.
After visiting several universi
ties ho knew he wanted to go to
Stanford. Even in Hungary he
had heard about this University.
"I like the spirit, social life and j
the high scientific level at Stan- i
ford," he explained. "The activi-1
lies here are wonderful. We did]
not have so many in Hungary."
"There we had no wonderful
facilities like a library, dormito
ries, books and heating," he re
called.
He plays bridge and also col-j
lects small pieces of sculpture, j
He likes American jazz. He said

A Hungarian refugee, Domolky
is now a senior majoring in eco
nomics at Stanford and is living
in Toyon Hall. He is starting his
first year of college in the United
States and is here on an athletic
scholarship.
Domolky was a student at the
University of Budapest, which
was involved in the uprising last
November. Three weeks after the
revolt ho left the country.
After three days of walking, he
and another college student reach
ed a river which marked the Hun
garian border. There they found
a family in the forest who were
nearly frozen. They helped the
family across the river, Domolky
making two trips across carrying
the children.
"These uprisings show the peo
ple of the world what the Hun
garians want," he remarked.
"They want freedom of the press
and of speech."
According to him, their actions
represent the feelings of the rest
of the Russian satellite states, as
does that of the recent Polish oc
currence.
"The Russians have been trying
to win the sympathy of youth,"
he says, "but havent' been able
to." Before the Communists came
into control, the students had de
mocracy in the schools. After
wards, the Communist party took
over and stopped this.
Asked about the Voice of Amer
ica, he said the Hungarians listen
often to the broadcasts. But dur
ing the revolution they were dis
appointed in it because it kept
promising help that never came.
Domolky traveled to the United
States as one of the 38-member
Hungarian Athletes Freedom
Tour sponsored by Sports Illus
trated. They toured 35 cities and
also visited several universities,
including Princeton, Notre Dame
and the University of Pennsyl
vania.
In March he came to Los Gatos.
There he began learning English,
since in the team they did not
have to speak it. During the
spring he took a course in English
at the high school there.

"Girls have helped me a lot
with my English," he said. "They
are like dictionaries on two feet."
He is impressed with the Jiving
standards in America. It seems
to him that everyone has a car,
even the college students. In Hun
gary very few people have cars,
he remarked.
His favorite city is San Fran
cisco—the people are so friendly
and the scenery is so beautiful.
Another thing he noticed was the j
happiness of youth. "I could sec j
it in their eyes," he said.
After visiting several universi
ties ho knew he wanted to go to
Stanford. Even in Hungary he
had heard about this University.
"I like the spirit, social life and j
the high scientific level at Stan- i
ford," he explained. "The activi-1
lies here are wonderful. We did]
not have so many in Hungary."
"There we had no wonderful
