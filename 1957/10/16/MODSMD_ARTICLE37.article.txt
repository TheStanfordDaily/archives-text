# 'Radiation Just Another Hazard' Explains Cal Medical Expert
## 
### 
Radiation is just another haz
ard, along with smoking, automo
biles and other dangers, Dr. Har
din Jones, professor of medical
physics and physiology at the
University of California, said yes
terday at noon in an address at
the new physics building.
Dr. Jones explained that the
effect of the fallout from atomic
tests is much less than those
from X-rays, and he urged that

more time and money he spent
to lessen the danger of X-rays.
"We must consider the over-!
all benefits of atomic energy," j
he said. "We should not jeopar
dize the possibilities for peace
time use of atomic energy by
stopping the tests which are so
valuable for research."
In evaluating radiation effects,
Dr. Jones pointed out. difficulties
arise because there are so many
small factors to consider. He
pointed out that a small dosage
of radiation may have an oppo
site effect from a large dose.
Dr. Jones was sponsored by
the Federation of American Sci
entists.
