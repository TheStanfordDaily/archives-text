# Meager U.S. Delegation Conspicuous at Festival
## Williamson Says Russians Liked informality, Equality of Americans 
### David Egger 
Editor's Note: This is the second of a series of three articles on
the experiences of Earl Iticiiard Williamson who was one of the
lf»3 Americans who visited Red China during Ihe summer. The
final article will concern the legal difficulties incurred because of
the unauthorized trip to Red China.

Among I lie great nat ions represented at the World Youth Festival
this summer in Moscow, the United States was conspicuous for the
meager si/.e of its delegation. The two-week Festival was attended
by 33,000 delegates from all over the world; the British alone sent
1600.

But the 163 Americans who trav
impression. The Russians liked
tho Americans' informality and
the social equality of the group.
An aspect of American culture
which totally wins the Russian
youth is jazz. They also like
some modern American compos
ers, especially Gershwin, but
have little taste for our modern
painters.
These are a few of the impres
sions Earl Williamson talked
about to an overflow crowd at
San Francisco State College last
Thursday. Williamson told about
asking a Soviet official why the
Russians jam parts of the Voice
of America broadcasts. The offi
cial explained that some pro
grams included things they did
n't like.
"Who didn't like?"
"The people didn't like," the of
ficial explained.
"The people or you officials of i
the government?"
"We and the people are the
same."
Attends Meetings
Williamson attended meetings
and discussions between various
national delegations, parties and j
lectures, and toured such diverse
places as the Trechakoff Art Gal
lery, the Kaganovich (as of Au
gust. the name hadn't been
changed) ball-bearing plant, the'
Bolshoi ballet school and the
University of Moscow.
Williamson reported that those
not interested in any of the or
ganized activities or tours were
allowed to wander as they
pleased. One enterprising Ameri
can capitalized on this freedom
by reading the United Nations re
port on the rape of Hungary to ;
Russian crowds; in Red Square.
One afternoon Williamson and ;
four others rode out to the end of;
a Moscow car line to explore
something of the surroundingj
countryside.
Sec Village
They visited a village church, |
shopped in the village store, and
were invited into the home of a
simply dressed, but surprisingly
wealthy, peasant. He ushered j
them into his living room which j
boasted a piano, a short wave ra
dio and a television set, in addi
tion to more customary furni
ture.
But possession of such goods is
still rare among most Russians.
Though food is quite cheap, the 1
consumer goods which are avail
able are expensive. Highly placed
bureaucrats and some scientists
are about the only two groups
who can begin to afford such lux |

veled to Moscow made a favorable
uries as a car or kitchen appli
ances.
Williamson, who taught chem
istry and American history at
Oakland High last year, learned
of the Youth Festival, as did
most of the Americans who went
to Moscow, through announce
ments and preliminary comment
in popular American magazines.
Obtaining the address of the
girl in charge of the U.S. Youth
Festival Committee, he wrote to
her and learned that the New
York to New York cost would be
$700.
In applying for Iris passport,
Williamson stated that the pur
pose of the trip was to attend the
Moscow Youth Festival; he re
ceived the passport without de
lay.
After flying from New York,
Williamson, along with SO other
' Americans, boarded the train in
London for the four-day trip to
Moscow. The Americans had
been advised to take food and
water along with them.
Amazed by Crowd
Arriving in East Germany ear
ily the second day, they were
I amazed by the sight of a brass
I band and a crowd of people bring
i ing food and shouting greetings,
j Similar ceremonies were repeat-
I ed at various stops for the rest
i of the journey.
On the train Williamson had
his first opportunity to become
acquainted with the other Ameri
cans. He was amazed by the di
versity of the group. Their ages
ranged from about. 16 to 38 (Wil
liamson is 28). They came from
urban centers in the East, from
: small towns in the Midwest, from
j cities and university communi
| ties in the West. Williamson esti
j mated that about as many dele
gates were from California as
from New York.
The largest single group were
j college students. All segments of
: the political spectrum were rep
resented, but when asked about
racial backgrounds, Williamson
emphasized, "1 don't think it does
credit to our American tradition
j of free thought to categorize peo
ple by color."
Frequent Question
One of the most frequent ques
tions asked by Russians and del
egates from other nations con
cerned racial discrimination in
j the U.S.
They wantcrl to know why we
hadn't done more to ameliorate
the conditions of the American
Negro. Many Americans found
this a difficult problem to ex
plain away.
At the end of the Festival, Red
China invited 15 Americans,
along with a like number from
other delegations, to tour their
country, with all expenses paid.
Eighty-five Americans signed up
for the trip. Subsequently 41
were allowed to go; those not in
cluded in the original 15 had to
pay a small part of their own
expenses.
31a,jor C hange
Since this was a major change
in plans, group members called
home to clear things with their
parents. (A phone call from Mos
cow to Los Angeles costs about
$5.) The conversations ranged
from "Have a good time, dear.
You should learn a lot" to "Don't
you dare go. Your brother will
lose his job."
The 41 Americans who finally
made the trip knew the risks in
volved, knew that they might
lose their passports. But William
son, speaking for himself, said.
"These things (the State Depart
ment's objections) were impor-
I tant, but not as important as hav
| ing Americans travel to Red
I China."

Among I lie great nat ions represented at the World Youth Festival
this summer in Moscow, the United States was conspicuous for the
meager si/.e of its delegation. The two-week Festival was attended
by 33,000 delegates from all over the world; the British alone sent
1600.

But the 163 Americans who trav
impression. The Russians liked
tho Americans' informality and
the social equality of the group.
An aspect of American culture
which totally wins the Russian
youth is jazz. They also like
some modern American compos
ers, especially Gershwin, but
have little taste for our modern
painters.
These are a few of the impres
sions Earl Williamson talked
about to an overflow crowd at
San Francisco State College last
Thursday. Williamson told about
asking a Soviet official why the
Russians jam parts of the Voice
of America broadcasts. The offi
cial explained that some pro
grams included things they did
n't like.
"Who didn't like?"
"The people didn't like," the of
ficial explained.
"The people or you officials of i
the government?"
"We and the people are the
same."
Attends Meetings
Williamson attended meetings
and discussions between various
national delegations, parties and j
lectures, and toured such diverse
places as the Trechakoff Art Gal
lery, the Kaganovich (as of Au
gust. the name hadn't been
changed) ball-bearing plant, the'
Bolshoi ballet school and the
University of Moscow.
Williamson reported that those
not interested in any of the or
ganized activities or tours were
allowed to wander as they
pleased. One enterprising Ameri
can capitalized on this freedom
by reading the United Nations re
port on the rape of Hungary to ;
Russian crowds; in Red Square.
One afternoon Williamson and ;
four others rode out to the end of;
a Moscow car line to explore
something of the surroundingj
countryside.
Sec Village
They visited a village church, |
shopped in the village store, and
were invited into the home of a
simply dressed, but surprisingly
wealthy, peasant. He ushered j
them into his living room which j
boasted a piano, a short wave ra
dio and a television set, in addi
tion to more customary furni
ture.
But possession of such goods is
still rare among most Russians.
Though food is quite cheap, the 1
consumer goods which are avail
able are expensive. Highly placed
bureaucrats and some scientists
are about the only two groups
who can begin to afford such lux |

veled to Moscow made a favorable
uries as a car or kitchen appli
ances.
Williamson, who taught chem
istry and American history at
Oakland High last year, learned
of the Youth Festival, as did
most of the Americans who went
to Moscow, through announce
ments and preliminary comment
in popular American magazines.
Obtaining the address of the
girl in charge of the U.S. Youth
Festival Committee, he wrote to
her and learned that the New
York to New York cost would be
$700.
In applying for Iris passport,
Williamson stated that the pur
pose of the trip was to attend the
Moscow Youth Festival; he re
ceived the passport without de
lay.
After flying from New York,
Williamson, along with SO other
' Americans, boarded the train in
London for the four-day trip to
Moscow. The Americans had
been advised to take food and
water along with them.
Amazed by Crowd
Arriving in East Germany ear
ily the second day, they were
I amazed by the sight of a brass
I band and a crowd of people bring
i ing food and shouting greetings,
j Similar ceremonies were repeat-
I ed at various stops for the rest
i of the journey.
On the train Williamson had
his first opportunity to become
acquainted with the other Ameri
cans. He was amazed by the di
versity of the group. Their ages
ranged from about. 16 to 38 (Wil
liamson is 28). They came from
urban centers in the East, from
: small towns in the Midwest, from
j cities and university communi
| ties in the West. Williamson esti
j mated that about as many dele
gates were from California as
from New York.
The largest single group were
j college students. All segments of
: the political spectrum were rep
resented, but when asked about
racial backgrounds, Williamson
emphasized, "1 don't think it does
credit to our American tradition
j of free thought to categorize peo
ple by color."
Frequent Question
One of the most frequent ques
tions asked by Russians and del
egates from other nations con
cerned racial discrimination in
j the U.S.
They wantcrl to know why we
hadn't done more to ameliorate
the conditions of the American
Negro. Many Americans found
this a difficult problem to ex
plain away.
At the end of the Festival, Red
China invited 15 Americans,
along with a like number from
other delegations, to tour their
country, with all expenses paid.
Eighty-five Americans signed up
for the trip. Subsequently 41
were allowed to go; those not in
cluded in the original 15 had to
pay a small part of their own
expenses.

Since this was a major change
in plans, group members called
home to clear things with their
parents. (A phone call from Mos
cow to Los Angeles costs about
$5.) The conversations ranged
from "Have a good time, dear.
You should learn a lot" to "Don't

At the end of the Festival, Red

Eighty-five Americans signed up

Among I lie great nat ions represented at the World Youth Festival
this summer in Moscow, the United States was conspicuous for the
meager si/.e of its delegation. The two-week Festival was attended
by 33,000 delegates from all over the world; the British alone sent
1600.

But the 163 Americans who trav
impression. The Russians liked
tho Americans' informality and
the social equality of the group.
An aspect of American culture
which totally wins the Russian
youth is jazz. They also like
some modern American compos
ers, especially Gershwin, but
have little taste for our modern
painters.
These are a few of the impres
sions Earl Williamson talked
about to an overflow crowd at
San Francisco State College last
Thursday. Williamson told about
asking a Soviet official why the
Russians jam parts of the Voice
of America broadcasts. The offi
cial explained that some pro
grams included things they did
n't like.
"Who didn't like?"
"The people didn't like," the of
ficial explained.
"The people or you officials of i
the government?"
"We and the people are the
same."
Attends Meetings
Williamson attended meetings
and discussions between various
national delegations, parties and j
lectures, and toured such diverse
places as the Trechakoff Art Gal
lery, the Kaganovich (as of Au
gust. the name hadn't been
changed) ball-bearing plant, the'
Bolshoi ballet school and the
University of Moscow.
Williamson reported that those
not interested in any of the or
ganized activities or tours were
allowed to wander as they
pleased. One enterprising Ameri
can capitalized on this freedom
by reading the United Nations re
port on the rape of Hungary to ;
Russian crowds; in Red Square.
One afternoon Williamson and ;
four others rode out to the end of;
a Moscow car line to explore
something of the surroundingj
countryside.
Sec Village
They visited a village church, |
shopped in the village store, and
were invited into the home of a
simply dressed, but surprisingly
wealthy, peasant. He ushered j
them into his living room which j
boasted a piano, a short wave ra
dio and a television set, in addi
tion to more customary furni
ture.
But possession of such goods is
still rare among most Russians.
Though food is quite cheap, the 1
consumer goods which are avail
able are expensive. Highly placed
bureaucrats and some scientists
are about the only two groups
who can begin to afford such lux |

veled to Moscow made a favorable

ances.
Williamson, who taught chem
istry and American history at
Oakland High last year, learned
of the Youth Festival, as did
most of the Americans who went
to Moscow, through announce
ments and preliminary comment
in popular American magazines.
Obtaining the address of the
girl in charge of the U.S. Youth
Festival Committee, he wrote to
her and learned that the New
York to New York cost would be
$700.
In applying for Iris passport,
Williamson stated that the pur
pose of the trip was to attend the
Moscow Youth Festival; he re
ceived the passport without de
lay.
After flying from New York,
Williamson, along with SO other
' Americans, boarded the train in
London for the four-day trip to
Moscow. The Americans had
been advised to take food and
water along with them.
Amazed by Crowd
Arriving in East Germany ear
ily the second day, they were
I amazed by the sight of a brass
I band and a crowd of people bring
i ing food and shouting greetings,
j Similar ceremonies were repeat-
I ed at various stops for the rest
i of the journey.
On the train Williamson had
his first opportunity to become
acquainted with the other Ameri
cans. He was amazed by the di
versity of the group. Their ages
ranged from about. 16 to 38 (Wil
liamson is 28). They came from
urban centers in the East, from
: small towns in the Midwest, from
j cities and university communi
| ties in the West. Williamson esti
j mated that about as many dele
gates were from California as
from New York.
The largest single group were
j college students. All segments of
: the political spectrum were rep
resented, but when asked about
racial backgrounds, Williamson
emphasized, "1 don't think it does
credit to our American tradition
j of free thought to categorize peo
ple by color."
Frequent Question
One of the most frequent ques
tions asked by Russians and del
egates from other nations con
cerned racial discrimination in

Editor's Note: This is the second of a series of three articles on
the experiences of Earl Iticiiard Williamson who was one of the
lf»3 Americans who visited Red China during Ihe summer. The
final article will concern the legal difficulties incurred because of
the unauthorized trip to Red China.

Among I lie great nat ions represented at the World Youth Festival
this summer in Moscow, the United States was conspicuous for the
meager si/.e of its delegation. The two-week Festival was attended
by 33,000 delegates from all over the world; the British alone sent
1600.

But the 163 Americans who trav
impression. The Russians liked
tho Americans' informality and
the social equality of the group.
An aspect of American culture
which totally wins the Russian
youth is jazz. They also like
some modern American compos
ers, especially Gershwin, but
have little taste for our modern
painters.
These are a few of the impres
sions Earl Williamson talked
about to an overflow crowd at
San Francisco State College last
Thursday. Williamson told about
asking a Soviet official why the
Russians jam parts of the Voice
of America broadcasts. The offi
cial explained that some pro
grams included things they did
n't like.
"Who didn't like?"
"The people didn't like," the of
ficial explained.
"The people or you officials of i
the government?"
"We and the people are the
same."
Attends Meetings
Williamson attended meetings
and discussions between various
national delegations, parties and j
lectures, and toured such diverse
places as the Trechakoff Art Gal
lery, the Kaganovich (as of Au
gust. the name hadn't been
changed) ball-bearing plant, the'
Bolshoi ballet school and the
University of Moscow.
Williamson reported that those
not interested in any of the or
ganized activities or tours were
allowed to wander as they
pleased. One enterprising Ameri
can capitalized on this freedom
by reading the United Nations re
port on the rape of Hungary to ;
Russian crowds; in Red Square.
One afternoon Williamson and ;
four others rode out to the end of;
a Moscow car line to explore
something of the surroundingj
countryside.
Sec Village
They visited a village church, |
shopped in the village store, and
were invited into the home of a
simply dressed, but surprisingly
wealthy, peasant. He ushered j
them into his living room which j
boasted a piano, a short wave ra
dio and a television set, in addi
tion to more customary furni
ture.
But possession of such goods is
still rare among most Russians.
Though food is quite cheap, the 1
consumer goods which are avail
able are expensive. Highly placed
bureaucrats and some scientists
are about the only two groups
who can begin to afford such lux |

veled to Moscow made a favorable
uries as a car or kitchen appli
ances.
Williamson, who taught chem
istry and American history at
Oakland High last year, learned
of the Youth Festival, as did
most of the Americans who went
to Moscow, through announce
ments and preliminary comment
in popular American magazines.
Obtaining the address of the
girl in charge of the U.S. Youth
Festival Committee, he wrote to
her and learned that the New
York to New York cost would be
$700.
In applying for Iris passport,
Williamson stated that the pur
pose of the trip was to attend the
Moscow Youth Festival; he re
ceived the passport without de
lay.
After flying from New York,
Williamson, along with SO other
' Americans, boarded the train in
London for the four-day trip to
Moscow. The Americans had
been advised to take food and
water along with them.
Amazed by Crowd
Arriving in East Germany ear
ily the second day, they were
I amazed by the sight of a brass
I band and a crowd of people bring
i ing food and shouting greetings,
j Similar ceremonies were repeat-
I ed at various stops for the rest
i of the journey.
On the train Williamson had
his first opportunity to become
acquainted with the other Ameri
cans. He was amazed by the di
versity of the group. Their ages
ranged from about. 16 to 38 (Wil
liamson is 28). They came from
urban centers in the East, from
: small towns in the Midwest, from
j cities and university communi
| ties in the West. Williamson esti
j mated that about as many dele
gates were from California as
from New York.
The largest single group were
j college students. All segments of
: the political spectrum were rep
resented, but when asked about
racial backgrounds, Williamson
emphasized, "1 don't think it does
credit to our American tradition
j of free thought to categorize peo
ple by color."
