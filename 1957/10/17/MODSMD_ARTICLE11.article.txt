# 'We're Flattered But...'

Here's proof that The Stanford
Daily is an enthralling newspaper.
Last week Dennis Weiss of Ilin
conacla 111, Wilbur Hall, was so
engrossed in his copy of The
Daily that he missed an outside
door and walked through a largo
plate â€¢ glass window. His arms
were cut by the broken glass, and
several stitches were required.
When he returned from the I
hospital two days ago, Dennis had
great praise for the rapidity with
which some observers called an
ambulance and applied pressure
to stop the bleeding. He also said,
"My first thought after 1 ran Into

the glass was thai I've broken
the window and I'll have to pay
for it."
This is the third time in tlie
history of Wilbur that such an
accident has happened. One oc
curred last year; and two weeks
before Dennis' misfortune, Gary
A I lon of Rinconada II exited
through a window and sustained
cuts around a knee.
In order to prevent recurrence
of those mishaps, signs have boon
painted on the windows at Rinco
nada reading "Detour" or "Stop!"
and signs on the door proclaim
"Door" and "This Is the Way."
