# Flick Fads Fade Fast
## 
### 
Rumors from the direction
of the ASSU office have it that
students who have noise mak
ers confiscated at the Sunday
Night Flicks will have to write
5000- (instead of the former
1000-) word essays on why or
why not alarm clocks (or other
similar noise makers) should
be allowed inside the flicks.
It seems (as far as The Daily
can gather* that noise making
has reached the point of "reck
lessness" that approaches phys
ical dangerâ€”especially to those
sitting just below the balcony.
