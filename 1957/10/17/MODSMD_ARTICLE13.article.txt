VViin the whole world wonder
ing about "sputnik," scientists
working around the clock to find
information about it, and Russian
propaganda spouting forth, still
much is unknown about the satel
lite.
It took a Stanford University
scientist to confirm information
about its radio signal. His meth
od? He and a Palo Alto colleague
asked a Russian scientist!
O. G. Villard Jr. of the electrical
engineering department and Don
Harris, electron tube research
manager for the General Electric-
Laboratory in Palo Alto, decided
to send a cablegram to Dr. Vladi
mir Kotelnikov at the Academy of
Sciences in Moscow. Harris met
Kotelnikov last summer at an
electronics show in San Francisco.
The Russian scientist sent a
reply stating: "Satellite antenna
bent bipole. Field of polarization
linear or circular dependent on
direction of radiation."
This cryptic reply confirmed
what U.S. scientists had believed
but had not thought of asking.
