# Russia Claims U.S., Turkey Will Raid Syria
## Asks UN Aid to Prevent 'Aggression'; Offers to Send Red Armed Forces 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/}') The Soviet Union called on the UN
yesterday to halt a surprise attack on Syria allegedly planned by
the United States and Turkey. Russia offered to join other UN mem
bers in supplying military forces to meel such an attack.
The Russians charged that the United States is urging Turkey to

launch an attack with "lightning!
speed," in order to confront the
UN with a situation whereby the
world organization "may have no
time to take steps to prevent ag
gression."
The Soviet accusation came on
the heels of these swift develop
ments in the UN on the explosive
Middle East situation.
O Syria informed UN Secre
tary General Dag Hammarskjold
that an attack by Turkey was im
minent. Syria requested the 82-
nation General Assembly be
called into session immediately
to appoint a UN commission to
investigate the situation on the
tense Turkish-Syrian frontier.
Â® The United States quickly
endorsed the move to have the
Assembly consider the situation
in the Middle East.
The Soviet accusations against
the United States were contained
in a 1200-word letter from Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gro
myko to Sir Leslie Munro, presi
dent of the Assembly. Copies of
the letter were distributed sev
eral hours after the Syrian re
quest for Assembly action was
released.
"There is reliable information
that the Turkish general staff,
together with American advis
ers, has elaborated detailed plans
for an attack by Turkey on Syria,
their intention being to carry it
out immediately after the clec
j tions in Turkey on Oct. 27 of this
I year," Gromyko declared.
The Soviet foreign minister
| proposed that "should Turkey
; break the peace on the Syrian
1 frontier and attack Syria, the
; member states of the United Na
! tions should immediately render
Syria the armed assistance neces
j sary to put a stop to aggression.
"The Soviet government, for
j its part, declares that the Soviet
i Union is prepared to take part
| with its forces in suppressing ag
; gression and punishing the vio
| lators of peace."
Gromyko expressed support
1 for the Syrian request for ap
pointment of a UN inquiry com
; mission and proposed a two
i weeks deadline for submitting a
report to the Security Council
I report to the Security Council
and the General Assembly.
Turkey, which only Tuesday
| accused Syria of being a puppet
' for the Soviet Union in interna-
I tional affairs, remained silent.
