# 'Time' Leader Urges Asian Financial Rise
## Countries Will Go Communist Before Starving, Scott Warns 
### Dick Frey Associate Editor 
The United States must find
some way to increase private cap
ital investment in retarded free
nations of Asia or lose these coun
tries to Communism, John Scott
of Time, Inc., told an audience at
Bowman Alumni House last night.
Scott, assistant to the publisher
of Time magazine, recently re
turned to the United States from
a four-month assignment in Asia
and Europe.
Population increases in the free
Asian countries during the past
10 years are the bases of Asian
need for capital formation, Scott
said. While medical improvements
have accelerated the population
growth, traditional agricultural
methods have not produced suffi
cient food. Before these countries
starve they will go Communist,
Scott added.
