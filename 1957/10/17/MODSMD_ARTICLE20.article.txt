# Music in Society Topic of Matinee
## 
### 
The relationship between the
attitude of the society and the
music that represents it was ex
plained and demonstrated by
Hughson F. Mooney yesterday.
He spoke on "Songs, Singers and
Society Since 1890" as part of
the weekly Wednesday Matinee
program.
Mooney traced songs from the
1890 favorite "Silver Threads
Among Ihe Gold" to 1957's
"Hound Dog" by Presley.
It was after 1890 that the pop
ular music industry became truly
a nationwide industry and tho
publishers and composers began
crying "give the public what they
want," Mooney said.
