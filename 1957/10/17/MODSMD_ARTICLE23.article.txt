\<>i too LONG AGO there appeared a science fic
tion slorv which concerned a I nited States
\rnn project engaged in sending a manned
rocket to the moon. The ship was secretly
launched ami sueeessfull\ reached its objective.
However, when the crew began exploring the
lunar crater in which they had landed, they
were astounded to find a dome-shaped building.
I hev earefull\ approached the building, worry
ing about bug-eyed extraterrestrials and had
even worse thoughts about finding that the
Russians had beaten them to the moon.
After they had cautioush worked their way
to vsithin a few feet of the dome, one of the
mi ii noticed something which appeared to be
writing on the side of the building. A man
\oluiileered to move up to read the inscription.
He cautiously worked his wav to the building
and read the words "Property of the I nited
Slates \avv."
I lie spoof this story made of interservice
flccrec\ can he appropriately applied to the
repercussions caused within the United States
b\ lite launching of Russia's "sputnik." Kver

since 11ic- Russian satellite lias been circling the
earth, the charges and countercharges have
been flying in \\ ashington as to who and/or
what was responsible for the United States'
failure in satellite and rocket development.
The reason for our failure to heat the Rus
sians is attributable lo one cause —failure of
the U.S. Armed Forces lo establish a coordi
nated and cooperative rocket development pro
gram.
While the Army, "Navy and Air Force ex
changed pot shots over who had made superior
technological advances, the Russians success
lulls developed their satellite ami its launching
rocket a rocket capable of intercontinental
range.
11 is time for Secretary of Defense McFlroy
to coordinate the individual military rocket
research pro jects into a single effort.
The military services have worked together
suecessfullx in war: il is now evident that they
must pool llieir technological resources in all
matters.
