Editor, The Daily:
On Oct. <S The Stanford Daily editorially takes
up the cause of student rebels at the University
of Warsaw; on Oct. 10 The Stanford Daily takes
up the cause of Algerian rebels against the
French. The Daily comes out for freedom of
expression for the students of another university
and the political independence of another land.
Worthy causes, worthy of editorializing: but
would The Daily come forth with such defense
of similar causes if such were nearer to home?
Coming out for free expression in Warsaw is fine,
but wouldn't an examination of the amount of
free expression permitted on this campus be
equally valuable?
You speak of "deviation" causing a serious
block to the Polish student's future career. The
"deviation" of the college student or faculty mem
ber here, it has been experienced, can also be a
serious block to his career, for the student can be
threatened with expulsion, the professor not re
hired, or the assistant may be forced to self
violence.
Incidents such as these are sufficient warning
to the rest of us to "toe the line." The Daily's
fervent denunciation of those who would thwart
the freedom of expression and political freedom
in other lands is admirable, of course; but could
not this paper rise up a little and come forth with
equal fervor with a condemnation of like situa
tions here?
Your paper reminds one of the individual who
leaves his troubled land where freedoms are
being threatened to go to another land from
where he proclaims himself an exile and thence

forth proceeds to shout out against his homeland.
Jt is one thing to sit here and editorialize against
the repression of freedom of expression and po
litical freedom in another land, but it is quite
another tiling to attack similar repression in one's
own environment.

Editor's Nolo: It is contrary to the policy
of The Daily to print any letter, the author of
which is unknown to us. This one, however,
presents a challenge to the personal freedom
of Stanford students and faculty members.
It', as the author claims, there are situations
of the type he describes on the campus, we, of
all people, would like him to tell us where in
deed these situations exist. We can assure him
that his name will be held in the strictest of
confidence.

Editor, The Daily:
Once again the patronizing attitude of the Uni
versity toward its students becomes manifest.
The administration apparently believes that
scholars must be shielded from all contact with
the world as it really is. We read that this year
the "Bawlout" will not include grade point av
erages.
Now, surely by the time we are of college age
we are able to face up to our successes and fail
ures. Wo do not need to be protected and coddled
continuously. Lei the G.P.A. be published! Those
who have done well will gain recognition. Those
who have failed will perhaps drive themselves to
greater academic efforts.

On Oct. <S The Stanford Daily editorially takes
up the cause of student rebels at the University
of Warsaw; on Oct. 10 The Stanford Daily takes
up the cause of Algerian rebels against the
French. The Daily comes out for freedom of
expression for the students of another university
and the political independence of another land.
Worthy causes, worthy of editorializing: but
would The Daily come forth with such defense
of similar causes if such were nearer to home?
Coming out for free expression in Warsaw is fine,
but wouldn't an examination of the amount of
free expression permitted on this campus be
equally valuable?
You speak of "deviation" causing a serious
block to the Polish student's future career. The
"deviation" of the college student or faculty mem
ber here, it has been experienced, can also be a
serious block to his career, for the student can be
threatened with expulsion, the professor not re
hired, or the assistant may be forced to self
violence.
Incidents such as these are sufficient warning
to the rest of us to "toe the line." The Daily's
fervent denunciation of those who would thwart
the freedom of expression and political freedom
in other lands is admirable, of course; but could
not this paper rise up a little and come forth with
equal fervor with a condemnation of like situa
tions here?
Your paper reminds one of the individual who
leaves his troubled land where freedoms are
being threatened to go to another land from
where he proclaims himself an exile and thence

forth proceeds to shout out against his homeland.
Jt is one thing to sit here and editorialize against
the repression of freedom of expression and po
litical freedom in another land, but it is quite
another tiling to attack similar repression in one's
own environment.

presents a challenge to the personal freedom
of Stanford students and faculty members.
It', as the author claims, there are situations
