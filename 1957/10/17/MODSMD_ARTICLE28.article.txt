# Prowler Burglarizes Fraternities; Police Chief Issues Theft Warning
## 
### 
Police Chief Gordon Davis yes- >
terday gave warning to Stanford
students that a prowler has been
working on the University cam
pus.
He reported that three frater-'
nity houses had been burglarized
recently during the early morn- :
ing hours.
Hardest hit was Alpha Tan
Omega, where the robber took a
$125 Royal Deluxe typewriter
and clothing, including almost
the entire wardrobe of one resi
dent. The Delta Chi house has
been burglarized twice for a total
of $73. About $50 was taken in
a raid on the Alpha Delta Phi
house Saturday.
The prowler has not been
sighted at Stanford, although
members of one fraternity heard
him upstairs. By the lime they
checked he was gone. Chief Da
vis speculated that it might be

the same burglar reported in
Berkeley recently. Berkeley offi
cials sent warning that he might
be headed for Stanford.
