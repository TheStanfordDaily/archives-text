# Confiscate Property
## 
### 
In Communist Asia capital is
formed through confiscation of
property. The peoples of free
Asia cannot undertake such a pro
gram for obvious legal reasons
and because of fear that U.S. dis
approval would cut off the aid
which is presently provided by
this country.
Scott emphasized that as long
as these countries remain retard
ed economically, democracy has
no chance of success. The people
of southern Asia have not associ
ated production with consump
tion; they know that others are
living better than they, and they
have a desire to become rich while
still retaining a large amount of
leisure time.
In their impatience for a better
way of life they vote Communists
into office because the Commu
nists say they will bring wealth
to the country, according to Scott.
Once the Communists are in pow
er, they discontinue elections and
entrench themselves permanently.
Thus they are entering govern
ments legally through democratic
elections.
Help Democracy
One factor which could help de
mocracy in this dilemma is the
Asian students who study in the
United States and return home tc
take an active part in their coun
try's government, Scott said.
He also pointed out that China
dominates southeastern Asia. Be
j fore white people entered south
eastern Asia, China held control
of the area for 25 centuries. Now
that the whites are leaving these
countries to native governments
the old Chinese influence is re
turning.
There are approximately 14 mil
lion Chinese in southeastern Asia
countries, and they are prosper
ous businessmen and traders, ac
cording to Scott. Southeast Asians
are envious of the Chinese, whe
have attained the wealth and pres
tige which the native peoples de
sire.
In western Asia everything is
at a standstill as a result of the
unsettled Arab-Israeli conflict, ob
served Scott.
