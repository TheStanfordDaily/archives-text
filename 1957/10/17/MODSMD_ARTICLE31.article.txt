against Washington plays* yes
terday. Tlx- Indians a I s o
worked on new offensive pal
ferns and practiced point-after
touchdown kicking. Jeri Mc-
Miilin and ( ' h r i s IS u r f o r d
missed the workout due to the
I In. i>nt all remaining: sick or
injured Stanford men showed
improvement.

Operating on the theory that a,
couple ot winners can't lie wrong,
Hie Washington Huskies yester-1
day worked on perfecting their
air offensive for Saturday's game
with Stanford in Seattle.
After noting the success of the j
Rice and Washington Stale air j
arms, and after examining cur
rent PCC statistics, Huskie men
tor Jim Owens apparently feels
Hint his club, too, can pile up the
yardage against the so-far porous
Stanford air defense.
There's another reason why
Owens may be putting more em
phasis on his passing attack- the
Huskies haven't yet won with
1 heir predominantly runn in g
game.
Opened with a Tie
Washington opened the season
with Colorado and were greatly
outplayed, although they gained
a (><> lie. Moving to Minnesota for
a game with (he Big Ten co-favo
rites proved disastrous for the
Northerners as they were swamp
ed, 40-7.
Washington returned home with
hopes of atoning for the shellack
ing, hut instead received another
this one from Ohio State, 35-7.
Si ill the Huskies had not lost in
Coast Conference play, so hopes
were high that they might live
up to the second place forecast
for i hern at season's start.
But it was not to be, as UCLA
.'•hul <iut the Northerners in the
Coliseum last Saturday, 19-0. It |
was one of Washington's poorestj
showings against the Bruins in
ii cent years.
Revenge Motives
Both the Indians and Huskies
will have revenge motives work
ing for them when they (angle
Saturday. Washington has n ' I
beaten Stanford in Seattle since
1947 and the home folks are get
ting tired of seeing Chuck Tay
lor's men win.
The Cards don't have to look
back over any 10 years 1o find a
reason to trounce Washington. It
was just last year that the un
heralded Huskies came into town
on the heels of Oregon State and
proceeded to thoroughly whip the
Tribe, 34-13.
Similar Situation
When Stanford looks back to
last season, however, they'll find
a striking similarity of situations.
In '56 it was Oregon State which
came from behind with a pair of
last - quarter touchdowns to eke
out a conversion victory, 21-19,
and knock Stanford out of Ihe
Ilose Bowl.
Last week it was Washington j
State which stuck Rose Bowl j
thorns in the Stanford side. As j
Stanford fans know all too well, j
the Cougars tallied twice in the
last four minutes and took advan- j
lage of a lack of Stanford PAT's '
1o win, 21-18.
The point to ponder in this com
parison. of course, is whether the
Cards will tumble as Ihey did last
year after the narrow loss — or;
whether they'll start a string of
six straight PCC victories.
