es say. and each year Jordan lec
tures upon his specialty—running.
Autumn baseball practice em
phasizes a review of the game's
fundamentals, and there aren't
many things more fundamental
than running. (Please check with
Branch Rickey for verification.)
Situation Drills
The Indians conduct panel dis
cussions on hitting, throwing and
fielding, and then hold hitting and
defensive play situation drills.
•Billy Alhouse is coaching the
varsity this quarter while head
coach Dutch Fehring is occupied
with assistant football coach du
ties.
In addition to Alhouse, Rudy
Figueroa, Stanford's three-time
All-CIBA third baseman, and for
mer Indian hurler Mike Acker,
now a professional minor league
pitcher, are teaching their spe
cialties.
The varsity practices Mondays
and Wednesdays with emphasis
upon fundamentals, and then
plays an intrasquad game on Fri
days. The frosh squad, also coach
ed by Alhouse, xlrills Tuesdays
and Thursdays, staging an intra
squad game Thursdays.
Third Fast Year
The Indians finished third in
the Pacific Coast Conference's
Southern Division last season,
with live wins and seven losses.
In the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association, Stanford
also placed third.
Undoubtedly the sweetest tri
umph last season came when Bob
Leopold, who had transferred only
a few days before from Stockton
College, hurled a no-hitter against
California, which later won the
NCAA world series at Omaha.
The tall southpaw is returning
this season and joins veteran
right-hander George Avery as a
mound mainstay.
Other varsity returnees include
catchers Ralph Holding and Art
Van Wronski, infielders Joe New
kirk, A 1 Shaw, Wayne Marion and
Rich DeFabio and outfielder Par
ker Olson.
