# No Seniors Among SU Cagers Unless Van Galder Comes Out
## 
### Store Baffrey 
Unless Gary Van Galder changes his mind, it looks like there won't
he a senior on coach Howie Dallmar's varsity baskelball squad this
year.
And furtherâ€”the coach feels that the majority of his 12-mnn
squad will be sophomores.
Graduation took three of last year's starters, Bill Bond, Carl Isaacs

and Hap Wagner. Dick Haga
and Paul Neuman, sophomores
during the 1957 campaign, com
pleted the starting five.
Haga and Neumann and jun
iors John Pflueger and Doug
Warren are back to provide the
nucleus for this years' quintet.
Great. Potential From Frosli
"Last year's freshman team
had so much potential," the local
mentor noted, looking ahead to
this year, "there's really going to
be lots of competition among
them for positions on the squad."
"We're going to have a good
team," he added, "and I don't say
we're necessarily going to lose
games because we're training a
young squad. We are planning
to do a lot better than predictions
say we will."
In discussing this year's sopho
more crop, the coach mentioned
standout names from last yar's
frosh like Jerry Thuesen, Jim
Weersing, Mike Tipton, Neal
Brockmeyer, footballer Chr is
Burford, Mason Byles and Dick
Thompson. "And these are just
some," he said.
Three Good Braves
Among those coming up from
last year's Braves team, Dallmar
mentioned Jerry Rose, Tom
Crawford and John Caple. "Be
sides the returning regulars,
though," Dallmar said, "nothing
is really certain. We have 40
boys out, and we have to cut to
24."
John Arrillaga, who started
with the frosh team in '55 and
then was forced to sit out a year
because of illness, will be return
ing this year, and the coach ex
pects he will be seeing action.
Two and a half weeks of out
door running and endurance
work has been the content of
practice so far. This week the
team moved inside for floor
work. The squad is spending ap
proximately 75 minutes a day
working out at present.
New-Type Schedule
This year's 25-game schedule
differs from last year's in the ex
clusion of weekend series against
the same teams. The PCC sched
ule has been made up on a home
and-home basis, in which the In
dians will meet each team at
home once and again on the road.
The Cardinals open their home
season on Dec. 2 when t hey meet
College of the Pacific in the Pa
vilion at 8 p.m.
