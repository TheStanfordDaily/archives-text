# POSSIBLE FIRST
## Color Portraits of Seniors To Be Introduced by Quad 
### 
The 1958 Quad will be the first
and perhaps the only high school
or college yearbook in the country
to use color portrait photography
this year, announced editor Mike
Roemer yesterday.
Beginning with senior women
the first four days of next week,

the Quad will photograph (he en
lire senior class portrait section
in color. Seniors' residence pic
tures will still appear in black
and-white, as will lower-classman
living group pictures.
Senior women are requested to
wear white sweaters or blouses
with sleeves for the color process
also.
Eastman Kodak developed the
color portrait process, which is
similar to that used for 35mm
slides. Quad photographer Keith
Cole was one of the field testers
for the process, and it was
through him that the Quad staff
first became interested in its pos
sibilities last May.
The color photography gives a
truer representation of the sub
ject's appearance and personality,
and the Quad staff has tremen
dous expectations for the ven
ture's success, said Roemer.
"With color in the senior por
trait section, the Quad will take
its place among the top yearbooks
of the country," he said. "This
step marks our book as distinc
tively progressive and will en
hance the reputation of Stanford
University as well as the quality
and attractiveness of the book."
He added that the process pro
duces constant good portrait
quality.
The Quad office's photography
studio has been rebuilt to accom
modate the new process and to
improve photographic quality in
general.
In previous years, reflection of
the subject floodlights off the
background produced a variance
of hue in portrait backgrounds.
The studio was lengthened to per
mit the subject to sit far - enough
away from the background to
eliminate the reflection.
Itoemer concluded his announce
ment by saying that the color
portraits are the fits! of several
plans of the staff to make the
1958 Quad "bigger and better."
