# Cards to Try Washington Comeback
## Van Galder May See Action Tomorrow; Valli Also to Make Trip 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
It's comeback time for the
Stanford Indians.
More specifically, it's come
back time if the Cards want to
have a shot at making the 1957
gridiron season any more than
another in a string of might
have-been years.
Chuck Taylor's crow needs a
victory when it meets Washing
ton tomorrow afternoon in Seat
tle. The Tribe started the season
like a house afire, and then pro
ceeded to get burned the next
two weeks.
As a result, the Stanford's find
themselves at a mid season cross
roads one way pointing toward
more success than pro-season ex
perts envisioned for the Cards;
the other way leading down the
same dark trail the Indians fol
lowed during the last four games
of 1956.
Morale Questionable
Indian morale during Hie past
week has been hard to evaluate.
It seems natural that, any team
which lost a game like Stanford
lost last week would suffer some
sort of let-down, at least for a
couple of days.
Stanford's pr a e t ice sessions
have been average this week. The
bottom hasn't fallen out, certain
ly, but on the other hand, such
vital departments as pass -de-
fense find point-after-touchdown
kicking don't appear to have im
proved much over the past few
days.
The team has appeared to he
rather quiet. Whether ihey're
looking ahead to Washington
with quiet determination. or are
still mentally kick frig themselves
for blowing the WSC game, is the
quest ion.
I) nights Optimistic
Jackie Douglas, at least, views
the rest o! the season with opti
mism. lie's been pointing out to
his mates that in 1956, Oregon
Slate lost its first PCO game, but
still went on to win the confer
ence championship and gain a
Rose Bowl bid.
One thing is certain: Tf Stan
ford reacts to Washington in the
same manner as last year, it'll be
a long plane ride back from Se
at i le.
In '!)(), Ihe Cards met Washing
lon 1 he week after the Oregon
State mess. They let down badly,
and were snowed under, 34-13.
This year, they run into the Hus
kies the week after the Washing
lon Stale debacle.
Will Similarity End
The similarity of the losses to
OSC and WSC has been pointed
out to Stanford plenty during the
pa si week. The hope of Stanford
followers is that Ihe similarity
wiil end right there, and not car
ry over into the meeting with
Washington.
Despite losing their last two
games, the Indians go into the
game with a far better season
record, 2-2, than that of the Hus
kies, who are 0-3-1.
In spite of the poor Washing
lon mark, tomorrow's hosts are
said to have plenty of good mate
rial and a good club. George
Lynn, who scouted the Huskies
for Stanford, reported that the
Huskies have an excellent pair of
breakaway runners in Luther
Carr and Jim Jones.
Erratic Luther
Cair's biggest problem is that
he is erratic. He'll go great guns
for a while, then suddenly get an
attack of fumble-itis. Jones is
less spectacular, but is just as
big a running threat as Carr, and
gets the job done in a more re
liable fashion.
Washington Coach Jim Owens
hasn't let any grass grow under
his feet in taking advantage of
what has thus far been a leaky
Stanford pass defense.
Reports from the Northwest
indicate thai the Huskies are do
ing a fast job of preparing an all
out aerial barrage to test the
Cards' secondary. Washington
has also been encouraged to take
to the air lanes by the return to
action of quarter-back A 1 Fergu
son.
Paced '56 Win
He's been bothered by a broken
finger this year, and saw onlv
partial action against UCLA.
Ferguson was also out last year
for five games, but returned in
the Stanford game to lead the
Huskies to their lopsided win.
Just as Ferguson's return
brings good news to the Wash
ington camp, so, too, floes the re
iurn of injured Indians bring
good news to Stanford.
Gary Van Galder, knocked out
of the Rice game with a concus
sion and inactive last week
against WSC. is ready for duty.
Coach Chuck Taylor indicated
thai Ben Robinson would draw
the starting nod tomorrow, but
also said that Van Galder would
see aelion.
Valli Doubtful
Slightly more doubtful is full
back Lou Valli. He donned a
practice uniform yesterday and
was doing lots of running, but
the three-week layoff has un
doubtedly hurt him.
Valli will definitely make Ihe
trip and may see limited activity,
but is certainly not anywhere
near lop shape. It is almost sure,
in fact, that he will not regain his
best form this year.
Taylor plans to start Ihe line
up which opened against the Cou

gars last week. This would in
clude Robinson and Dick Stein at
the ends, Eric Protiva and Troy
Barbee at tackles, Bob Peterson
and John Clark at guards, and
Russ Steele at center.
Douglas in Action
Directing the team will be
quarterback Jackie Douglas, still
slightly hampered by his back
injury but ready to play. Jackie
Taylor and A 1 Harrington will
start at the halfbacks, with
Chuck Shea and his game knee
in at fullback.
Offensively. Stanford will bank
on the "new look" rushing attack,
currently ranked second in the
Coast Conference. With Chuck
Shea, Rick McMillen and A 1 Har
rington packing the ball most of
ihe time, the Cards have rushed
for 226.3 yards per game.
The passing has not lagged far
behind as the Tribe ranks third
in the PCC. Defensively, it's a
different story. Last in pass de
fense; seventh in total defense.
These last-named statistics will
have to take a beating if Stan
ford is to beat Washington. It's
time for a win.

UN LIMBER I OR WASHINGTON


END JOEL FREIS TO TEST HUSKIES
Is One of Fastest Men on Indian Team
It's comeback time for the
Stanford Indians.
More specifically, it's come
back time if the Cards want to
have a shot at making the 1957
gridiron season any more than
another in a string of might
have-been years.
Chuck Taylor's crow needs a
victory when it meets Washing
ton tomorrow afternoon in Seat
tle. The Tribe started the season
like a house afire, and then pro
ceeded to get burned the next
two weeks.
As a result, the Stanford's find
themselves at a mid season cross
roads one way pointing toward
more success than pro-season ex
perts envisioned for the Cards;
the other way leading down the
same dark trail the Indians fol
lowed during the last four games
of 1956.
Morale Questionable
Indian morale during Hie past
week has been hard to evaluate.
It seems natural that, any team
which lost a game like Stanford
lost last week would suffer some
sort of let-down, at least for a
couple of days.
Stanford's pr a e t ice sessions
have been average this week. The
bottom hasn't fallen out, certain
ly, but on the other hand, such
vital departments as pass -de-
fense find point-after-touchdown
kicking don't appear to have im
proved much over the past few
days.
The team has appeared to he
rather quiet. Whether ihey're
looking ahead to Washington
with quiet determination. or are
still mentally kick frig themselves
for blowing the WSC game, is the
quest ion.
I) nights Optimistic
Jackie Douglas, at least, views
the rest o! the season with opti
mism. lie's been pointing out to
his mates that in 1956, Oregon
Slate lost its first PCO game, but
still went on to win the confer
ence championship and gain a
Rose Bowl bid.
One thing is certain: Tf Stan
ford reacts to Washington in the
same manner as last year, it'll be
a long plane ride back from Se
at i le.
In '!)(), Ihe Cards met Washing
lon 1 he week after the Oregon
State mess. They let down badly,
and were snowed under, 34-13.
This year, they run into the Hus
kies the week after the Washing
lon Stale debacle.
Will Similarity End
The similarity of the losses to
OSC and WSC has been pointed
out to Stanford plenty during the
pa si week. The hope of Stanford
followers is that Ihe similarity
wiil end right there, and not car
ry over into the meeting with
Washington.
Despite losing their last two
games, the Indians go into the
game with a far better season
record, 2-2, than that of the Hus
kies, who are 0-3-1.
In spite of the poor Washing
lon mark, tomorrow's hosts are
said to have plenty of good mate
rial and a good club. George
Lynn, who scouted the Huskies
for Stanford, reported that the
Huskies have an excellent pair of
breakaway runners in Luther
Carr and Jim Jones.
Erratic Luther
Cair's biggest problem is that
he is erratic. He'll go great guns
for a while, then suddenly get an
attack of fumble-itis. Jones is
less spectacular, but is just as
big a running threat as Carr, and
gets the job done in a more re
liable fashion.
Washington Coach Jim Owens
hasn't let any grass grow under
his feet in taking advantage of
what has thus far been a leaky
Stanford pass defense.
Reports from the Northwest
indicate thai the Huskies are do
ing a fast job of preparing an all
out aerial barrage to test the
Cards' secondary. Washington
has also been encouraged to take
to the air lanes by the return to
action of quarter-back A 1 Fergu
son.
Paced '56 Win
He's been bothered by a broken
finger this year, and saw onlv
partial action against UCLA.
Ferguson was also out last year
for five games, but returned in
the Stanford game to lead the
Huskies to their lopsided win.
Just as Ferguson's return
brings good news to the Wash
ington camp, so, too, floes the re
iurn of injured Indians bring
good news to Stanford.
Gary Van Galder, knocked out
of the Rice game with a concus
sion and inactive last week
against WSC. is ready for duty.
Coach Chuck Taylor indicated
thai Ben Robinson would draw
the starting nod tomorrow, but
also said that Van Galder would
see aelion.
Valli Doubtful
Slightly more doubtful is full
back Lou Valli. He donned a
practice uniform yesterday and
was doing lots of running, but
the three-week layoff has un
doubtedly hurt him.
Valli will definitely make Ihe
trip and may see limited activity,
but is certainly not anywhere
near lop shape. It is almost sure,
in fact, that he will not regain his
best form this year.
Taylor plans to start Ihe line
up which opened against the Cou

gars last week. This would in
clude Robinson and Dick Stein at
the ends, Eric Protiva and Troy
Barbee at tackles, Bob Peterson
and John Clark at guards, and
Russ Steele at center.
Douglas in Action
Directing the team will be
quarterback Jackie Douglas, still
slightly hampered by his back
injury but ready to play. Jackie
Taylor and A 1 Harrington will
start at the halfbacks, with
Chuck Shea and his game knee
in at fullback.
Offensively. Stanford will bank
on the "new look" rushing attack,
currently ranked second in the
Coast Conference. With Chuck
Shea, Rick McMillen and A 1 Har
rington packing the ball most of
ihe time, the Cards have rushed
for 226.3 yards per game.
The passing has not lagged far
behind as the Tribe ranks third
in the PCC. Defensively, it's a
different story. Last in pass de
fense; seventh in total defense.
These last-named statistics will
have to take a beating if Stan
ford is to beat Washington. It's
time for a win.

UN LIMBER I OR WASHINGTON


END JOEL FREIS TO TEST HUSKIES
Is One of Fastest Men on Indian Team
It's comeback time for the
Stanford Indians.
More specifically, it's come
back time if the Cards want to
have a shot at making the 1957
gridiron season any more than
another in a string of might
have-been years.
Chuck Taylor's crow needs a
victory when it meets Washing
ton tomorrow afternoon in Seat
tle. The Tribe started the season
like a house afire, and then pro
ceeded to get burned the next
two weeks.
As a result, the Stanford's find
themselves at a mid season cross
roads one way pointing toward
more success than pro-season ex
perts envisioned for the Cards;
the other way leading down the
same dark trail the Indians fol
lowed during the last four games
of 1956.
Morale Questionable
Indian morale during Hie past
week has been hard to evaluate.
It seems natural that, any team
which lost a game like Stanford
lost last week would suffer some
sort of let-down, at least for a
couple of days.
Stanford's pr a e t ice sessions
have been average this week. The
bottom hasn't fallen out, certain
ly, but on the other hand, such
vital departments as pass -de-
fense find point-after-touchdown
kicking don't appear to have im
proved much over the past few
days.
The team has appeared to he
rather quiet. Whether ihey're
looking ahead to Washington
with quiet determination. or are
still mentally kick frig themselves
for blowing the WSC game, is the
quest ion.
I) nights Optimistic
Jackie Douglas, at least, views
the rest o! the season with opti
mism. lie's been pointing out to
his mates that in 1956, Oregon
Slate lost its first PCO game, but
still went on to win the confer
ence championship and gain a
Rose Bowl bid.
One thing is certain: Tf Stan
ford reacts to Washington in the
same manner as last year, it'll be
a long plane ride back from Se
at i le.
In '!)(), Ihe Cards met Washing
lon 1 he week after the Oregon
State mess. They let down badly,
and were snowed under, 34-13.
This year, they run into the Hus
kies the week after the Washing
lon Stale debacle.
Will Similarity End
The similarity of the losses to
OSC and WSC has been pointed
out to Stanford plenty during the
pa si week. The hope of Stanford
followers is that Ihe similarity
wiil end right there, and not car
ry over into the meeting with
Washington.
Despite losing their last two
games, the Indians go into the
game with a far better season
record, 2-2, than that of the Hus
kies, who are 0-3-1.
In spite of the poor Washing
lon mark, tomorrow's hosts are
said to have plenty of good mate
rial and a good club. George
Lynn, who scouted the Huskies
for Stanford, reported that the
Huskies have an excellent pair of
breakaway runners in Luther
Carr and Jim Jones.
Erratic Luther
Cair's biggest problem is that
he is erratic. He'll go great guns
for a while, then suddenly get an
attack of fumble-itis. Jones is
less spectacular, but is just as
big a running threat as Carr, and
gets the job done in a more re
liable fashion.
Washington Coach Jim Owens
hasn't let any grass grow under
his feet in taking advantage of
what has thus far been a leaky
Stanford pass defense.
Reports from the Northwest
indicate thai the Huskies are do
ing a fast job of preparing an all
out aerial barrage to test the
Cards' secondary. Washington
has also been encouraged to take
to the air lanes by the return to
action of quarter-back A 1 Fergu
son.
Paced '56 Win
He's been bothered by a broken
finger this year, and saw onlv
partial action against UCLA.
Ferguson was also out last year
for five games, but returned in
the Stanford game to lead the
Huskies to their lopsided win.
Just as Ferguson's return
brings good news to the Wash
ington camp, so, too, floes the re
iurn of injured Indians bring
good news to Stanford.
Gary Van Galder, knocked out
of the Rice game with a concus
sion and inactive last week
against WSC. is ready for duty.
Coach Chuck Taylor indicated
thai Ben Robinson would draw
the starting nod tomorrow, but
also said that Van Galder would
see aelion.
Valli Doubtful
Slightly more doubtful is full
back Lou Valli. He donned a
practice uniform yesterday and
was doing lots of running, but
the three-week layoff has un
doubtedly hurt him.
Valli will definitely make Ihe
trip and may see limited activity,
but is certainly not anywhere
near lop shape. It is almost sure,
in fact, that he will not regain his
best form this year.
Taylor plans to start Ihe line
up which opened against the Cou

gars last week. This would in
clude Robinson and Dick Stein at
the ends, Eric Protiva and Troy
Barbee at tackles, Bob Peterson
and John Clark at guards, and
Russ Steele at center.
Douglas in Action
Directing the team will be
quarterback Jackie Douglas, still
slightly hampered by his back
injury but ready to play. Jackie
Taylor and A 1 Harrington will
start at the halfbacks, with
Chuck Shea and his game knee
in at fullback.
Offensively. Stanford will bank
on the "new look" rushing attack,
currently ranked second in the

Slightly more doubtful is full

Valli will definitely make Ihe

in fact, that he will not regain his

clude Robinson and Dick Stein at
the ends, Eric Protiva and Troy
Barbee at tackles, Bob Peterson

Douglas in Action
Directing the team will be
quarterback Jackie Douglas, still
slightly hampered by his back
injury but ready to play. Jackie
Taylor and A 1 Harrington will
start at the halfbacks, with
Chuck Shea and his game knee
in at fullback.
Offensively. Stanford will bank
on the "new look" rushing attack,
currently ranked second in the
Coast Conference. With Chuck
Shea, Rick McMillen and A 1 Har
rington packing the ball most of
ihe time, the Cards have rushed
for 226.3 yards per game.
The passing has not lagged far
behind as the Tribe ranks third
in the PCC. Defensively, it's a
different story. Last in pass de

UN LIMBER I OR WASHINGTON


END JOEL FREIS TO TEST HUSKIES
Is One of Fastest Men on Indian Team
It's comeback time for the
Stanford Indians.
More specifically, it's come
back time if the Cards want to
have a shot at making the 1957
gridiron season any more than
another in a string of might
have-been years.
Chuck Taylor's crow needs a
victory when it meets Washing
ton tomorrow afternoon in Seat
tle. The Tribe started the season
like a house afire, and then pro
ceeded to get burned the next
two weeks.
As a result, the Stanford's find
themselves at a mid season cross
roads one way pointing toward
more success than pro-season ex
perts envisioned for the Cards;
the other way leading down the
same dark trail the Indians fol
lowed during the last four games
of 1956.
Morale Questionable
Indian morale during Hie past
week has been hard to evaluate.
It seems natural that, any team
which lost a game like Stanford
lost last week would suffer some
sort of let-down, at least for a
couple of days.
Stanford's pr a e t ice sessions
have been average this week. The
bottom hasn't fallen out, certain
ly, but on the other hand, such
vital departments as pass -de-
fense find point-after-touchdown
kicking don't appear to have im
proved much over the past few
days.
The team has appeared to he
rather quiet. Whether ihey're
looking ahead to Washington
with quiet determination. or are
still mentally kick frig themselves
for blowing the WSC game, is the
quest ion.
I) nights Optimistic
Jackie Douglas, at least, views
the rest o! the season with opti
mism. lie's been pointing out to
his mates that in 1956, Oregon
Slate lost its first PCO game, but
still went on to win the confer
ence championship and gain a
Rose Bowl bid.
One thing is certain: Tf Stan
ford reacts to Washington in the
same manner as last year, it'll be
a long plane ride back from Se
at i le.
In '!)(), Ihe Cards met Washing
lon 1 he week after the Oregon
State mess. They let down badly,
and were snowed under, 34-13.
This year, they run into the Hus
kies the week after the Washing
lon Stale debacle.
Will Similarity End
The similarity of the losses to
OSC and WSC has been pointed
out to Stanford plenty during the
pa si week. The hope of Stanford
followers is that Ihe similarity
wiil end right there, and not car
ry over into the meeting with
Washington.
Despite losing their last two
games, the Indians go into the
game with a far better season
record, 2-2, than that of the Hus
kies, who are 0-3-1.
In spite of the poor Washing
lon mark, tomorrow's hosts are
said to have plenty of good mate
rial and a good club. George
Lynn, who scouted the Huskies
for Stanford, reported that the
Huskies have an excellent pair of
breakaway runners in Luther
Carr and Jim Jones.
Erratic Luther
Cair's biggest problem is that
he is erratic. He'll go great guns
for a while, then suddenly get an
attack of fumble-itis. Jones is
less spectacular, but is just as
big a running threat as Carr, and
gets the job done in a more re
liable fashion.
Washington Coach Jim Owens
hasn't let any grass grow under
his feet in taking advantage of
what has thus far been a leaky
Stanford pass defense.
Reports from the Northwest
indicate thai the Huskies are do
ing a fast job of preparing an all
out aerial barrage to test the
Cards' secondary. Washington
has also been encouraged to take
to the air lanes by the return to
action of quarter-back A 1 Fergu
son.
Paced '56 Win
He's been bothered by a broken
finger this year, and saw onlv
partial action against UCLA.
Ferguson was also out last year
for five games, but returned in
the Stanford game to lead the
Huskies to their lopsided win.
Just as Ferguson's return
brings good news to the Wash
ington camp, so, too, floes the re
iurn of injured Indians bring
good news to Stanford.
Gary Van Galder, knocked out

Carr and Jim Jones.
Erratic Luther
Cair's biggest problem is that
he is erratic. He'll go great guns
for a while, then suddenly get an
attack of fumble-itis. Jones is
less spectacular, but is just as
big a running threat as Carr, and
gets the job done in a more re
liable fashion.
Washington Coach Jim Owens
hasn't let any grass grow under
his feet in taking advantage of
what has thus far been a leaky
Stanford pass defense.
Reports from the Northwest
indicate thai the Huskies are do
ing a fast job of preparing an all
out aerial barrage to test the
Cards' secondary. Washington
has also been encouraged to take
to the air lanes by the return to
action of quarter-back A 1 Fergu
son.
Paced '56 Win
He's been bothered by a broken
finger this year, and saw onlv
partial action against UCLA.
Ferguson was also out last year
for five games, but returned in
the Stanford game to lead the
Huskies to their lopsided win.
Just as Ferguson's return
brings good news to the Wash
ington camp, so, too, floes the re
iurn of injured Indians bring
good news to Stanford.
Gary Van Galder, knocked out
of the Rice game with a concus
sion and inactive last week
against WSC. is ready for duty.
Coach Chuck Taylor indicated
thai Ben Robinson would draw
the starting nod tomorrow, but
also said that Van Galder would
see aelion.
Valli Doubtful
Slightly more doubtful is full
back Lou Valli. He donned a
practice uniform yesterday and
was doing lots of running, but
the three-week layoff has un
doubtedly hurt him.
Valli will definitely make Ihe
trip and may see limited activity,
but is certainly not anywhere
near lop shape. It is almost sure,
in fact, that he will not regain his
best form this year.
Taylor plans to start Ihe line
up which opened against the Cou

gars last week. This would in
clude Robinson and Dick Stein at
the ends, Eric Protiva and Troy
Barbee at tackles, Bob Peterson
and John Clark at guards, and
Russ Steele at center.
Douglas in Action
Directing the team will be
quarterback Jackie Douglas, still
slightly hampered by his back
injury but ready to play. Jackie
Taylor and A 1 Harrington will
start at the halfbacks, with
Chuck Shea and his game knee
in at fullback.
Offensively. Stanford will bank
on the "new look" rushing attack,
currently ranked second in the
Coast Conference. With Chuck
Shea, Rick McMillen and A 1 Har
rington packing the ball most of
ihe time, the Cards have rushed
for 226.3 yards per game.
The passing has not lagged far
behind as the Tribe ranks third
in the PCC. Defensively, it's a
different story. Last in pass de
fense; seventh in total defense.
These last-named statistics will
have to take a beating if Stan
ford is to beat Washington. It's
time for a win.
