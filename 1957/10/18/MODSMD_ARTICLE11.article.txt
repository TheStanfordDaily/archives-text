## Precedent Set As Messinger Breaks 5-5 Tie 
### Rich Brown Associate Editor 
The unexpected happened at
last night's ASSU Legislature
meeting when a routine commit
tee recommendation ended up
forcing president Jim Messinger
to break a tie vote of the Legis
lature and, in so doing, to set a
legislative precedent.
The precedent—set by the ap
proval of Crothers Memorial's
constitution—is that living groups
may have more freedom from
ASSU "paternalism," but at the
same time their members may
have to be more alert.
Specifically, the Crothers Me
morial constitution as approved
does not specify a minimum num
ber of members as a quorum but
merely says that "those present
shall be a quorum."
Bylaws committee had recom
mended rejecting the constitution
until a minimum quorum could
be established. Its reason was
that "a clique could control the
entire dormitory."
It was Crothers Memorial rep
resentative Dave Davidson who
kept Legislature from giving a
routine okay to the bylaws com
mittee recommendation. "It's not
our responsibility to protect mem
bers from their own disinterest,"
he said.
Davidson pointed out that most
Crothers Memorial residents are
graduate students and do not
want to be forced by a quorum
rule to attend house meetings.
Other Legislature actions in
cluded:
• Voting an additional $200 to
Political Union.
• Recommending to Judicial
Council that it set up a subordi
nate judicial body in the School
of Law.
• Approved first reading of a
bylaw amendment of the Ameri
can Institute of Chemical Engi
neers and second reading of Wal
ter Army Society's constitution,
as well as a bylaw revision of
Christian Science Organization.
• Referred constitutions of the
Arab Club and Interclub Council
back to the respective groups for
I revision.
• Set up a committee of one
(vice president Wendy Hawley)
to study the yellow jacket prob
lem at the Cellar.
