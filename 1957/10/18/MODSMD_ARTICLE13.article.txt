## Enslaved Work For Freedom 
### Barbara Bachman 
The tendency of enslaved peo
ple all over the world is to work
toward freedom and equality, and
this is the reason that today's
dominated peoples will "never ac
cept the Communist doctrine —
never!"
This observation by Alexander
Kerensky, ex-Prime Minister of
the Russian provisional govern
ment, was made at a general
meeting of the American Associa
tion of University Women and the
public last night in the audito
rium of the Women's Clubhouse.
Kerensky, with a conviction few
U.S.-born Americans can sincerely
evoke, continued to describe the
history of the Russian govern
ment from the early 20th century
to the present, with an occasional
prediction of the future in light
of this atomic age.
Since Stalin's death, some four
years ago, a significant change in '
the Russian political situation has
been made, and the trend has con
tinually been from slavery to free
dom, he said.

But the present regime now rec-1
ognizes this and is endeavoring to
establish conservative actions to I
appease the people rather than to j

anger them and thus encourage
them to radical uprisings. This
"conservatism," as Keren sky
termed it, is taking (lie forms of
concessions to the people in Ihe
form of simple things bread, but
ter, shoes and more diverse forms
of literature.
With these changes constantly
occurring in this major anti-West
ern power, stronger and stronger
tendencies toward liberation, im
provement and self-government
may be manifested in the near
future- six months, two years—
the 77-year-old Russian liberal in
tellectual forecast.
"You can never foretell all hu
man action—it is so illogical," lie
said. "But because I have a very
acute intuition, and because of my
former relationship with that gov
ernment [U.S.S.R.], I can feel de
veloping tendencies [against to
talitarianism] in that country."
"The essence of democracy is
not government by the people,"
he said, "but the existence of the
autonomous Individual, with a
recognized equality of all persons.
