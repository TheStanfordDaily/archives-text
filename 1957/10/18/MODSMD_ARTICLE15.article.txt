## 'U.S. Aid or Nationalism?' Is Class Conflict in Brazil 
### 
A comparison of Communist and American influence on the people
of Brazil and an analysis of the country's social and devclopmetn
problems was given yesterday by Dr. Renato Mesquita, prominent
Brazilian statesman and professor at the University of Bahia, at this
quarter's second political discussion sponsored by the Institute of

International Relations.
Dr. Mesquita and Murillo de
Chiree Jardim, who helped to lead
the discussion, are participants of
! the foreign leader exchange pro
i gram sponsored by the U.S. State
Department's International Edu
cational Exchange Service.
Brazil's relations with the Unit
ed States have been good ever
since her independence over 100
years ago, Dr. Mesquita stated.
America's policy, from the Mon
roe Doctrine to Roosevelt's good
neighbor policy, has always spon
sored friendliness and co-opera
tion. The countries have been al
lies in all inter-American confer
ences and have maintained good
economic and political relations.
Other factors contributing to
closeness between the two coun
tries, Dr. Mesquita said, are simi
lar moral and religious back
grounds, since both countries are
Christian. Also, American techni-.
cal aid, newspapers, magazines
and movies in Brazil help to bring
about understanding between the
two countries.
Still, he stated, Communism has
had great appeal to thp large Bra
zilian lower class, who believe
that America is attempting to ex
ploit them. These illiterate peo
ple have not yet received voting
privileges and so have not had po
litical influence so far, but they
may soon be granted suffrage
rights, which would make a great
change in Brazil's political poli
cies.
