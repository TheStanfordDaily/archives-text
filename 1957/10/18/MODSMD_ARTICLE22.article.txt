Local Bookstores Available
Editor, The Daily:
On Monday, Oct. 7, your columnist David Egger
wrote fin the problem of finding books—books of
all kinds for a scholarly community—at either
1he Stanford Bookstore or in the Palo Alto area.
He suggested that the present book'situation for
booklovers is one of "do without or else catch
the next train to San Francisco. . . . The situation
would not be so bad if Palo Alto were simply
alive with bookstores — new-book stores, used
book stores, paperback-book stores. But after
Kepler's, what?"
Writing on behalf of Ihc booksellers in the Palo
Alto area, I would like to point out —as flattering
as the reference was—that before Kepler's there
were, and are, a number of fine bookstores wait
ing to help serve your needs: Bell's College Book
store, on Emerson Street; Shirley Cobb's Books,
on University Avenue; Peninsula Books, in Town
& Country Village; and Kay's Books, in Los Altos.
All these stores, have books to be, in Mr.
Egger's phrase, "handled, perused and/or pur
chased." But, more than that, all these book
sellers are as concerned as any member of the
Stanford community to build a genuine book com
munity suitable to an area boasting a major uni
versity and related scholarly activities.
Our efforts fall short of the goal in good part
because of the peculiar problems that arise in a
situation where the campus Bookstore sells at a
rebate of 20 per cent, which for technical and text
books represents the complete margin available
1o the ordinary bookseller. In short, we are in
competition with a wholesale book-selling opera
tion, and none of us can afford to give books
away at our cost. Why aren't there more book
lovers perusing, handling and/or buying our
books? Because the Stanford Bookstore, like
Jerome Weidman's hero, can get it for you whole
sale!
The present rebate system nurtures many of
1he shortcomings of the book situation generally.
For example, if a bookstore in the community
puts into stock certain scholarly or technical
books not being stockcd elsewhere, including the
Stanford Bookstore, University people—faculty
and students—will discover and "peruse" these
new books; but 1he greater percentage of them
will then go to the Stanford Bookstore to place
1heir orders. Why? Because they want the re
bate.
But what is the result? The enterprising book
seller in ihe community has a white elephant on
his hands; his expensive stock becomes almost
unsellable; his potential customers have deserted
him. Hence, he closes out that part of his stock
with as little loss as possible and replaces it with
best sellers for lady shoppers.
In May of this year the Palo Alto Area Book
sellers Association sent a letter 1o Dr. George
Parks, president of the board of directors of the
Stanford Bookstore", outlining these and related
problems which must be solved if there is to be
a cooperative effort to develop a book commu
nity, and asked for the opportunity to meet with
Dr. Parks and his board of directors to discuss
common problems. I sorrowfully report that Dr.
Parks, in his brief reply, disdained even acknowl
edging our request for a meeting. However, there
was no indication in his letter that he had shared
our communication with members of his board.
From subsequent conversations with faculty
members (including members of the Board of
Governors), students and administrators, we are
hopeful that Dr. Parks' views are not widely
shared and that there are 1hose who will be will
ing to hear our case before ruling out entirely
the usefulness of creating, through cooperation
between town and gown, an enlarged book com
munity with strength in variety, diversity and
depth.
Your columnist's advice to booklovers- -to catch

the next train to San Francisco—understandably
enough, I trust, disturbs those of us who sell
books in this area and who would like very much
• to sell more of them to the University commu
nity. Nevertheless, it is regrettably true that the
combined stock of all stores in the area, includ
ing. the Stanford Bookstore, still leaves gaps that
should be filled. ' Unfortunately, many of these
gaps consist of scholarly and technical books
which a bookseller cannot afford to stock unless
he has some reasonable assurance of being able
to sell enough of them to carry that part of his
operation.
With the rapid development of industrial groups
around Stanford indeed, all along the Peninsula
—local booksellers were hopeful that the new
customer potential would warrant the risks. But,
to our chagrin, we have discovered that many of
these companies offer their employees—as a
"fringe benefit," according, to Dr. Parks—the
right to shop at the Stanford "PX"; this through
the Stanford Honors Cooperative Program.
There is a certain irony that the University so
closely associated with the name Hoover should
have accepted the monopolistic development of
one over-all bookstore selling merchandise at re
bates so great that smaller, privately-owned en
terprises in the community cannot begin to com
pete; rebates so high indeed that, far from de
veloping a Palo Alto "simply alive with book
stores," as your columnist wished, two Palo Alto
bookstores on University Avenue went into bank
ruptcy last May. Where were the booklovers?
"Doing without" presumably- and collecting re
bates.
We are attempting again to arrange a meeting
with the proper representatives of the Univer
sity's and the Bookstore's interests and responsi
bilities. A university ihe size of Stanford cannot
help but have a great impact on the outlying com
munity, and one of the problems is that the non-
University community will suffer if bookselling
declines exccpt at. the Bookstore on the campus.
The experience of hundreds of other university
and college communities," however, testifies to the
fact that this need not be so, but rather—as at. the
University of California in Berkeley—a compre
hensive book community can immeasurably bene
fit both the university and the wider community.
Friendly cooperation is all that is necessary.

Editor, The Daily:
I am afraid Mr. Glover (in Monday's Letter
to the Editor) has misunderstood my original
argument regarding the misconduct of the Stan
ford student body at the Sunday Night Flicks.
It is to my regret that such conduct does persist
at the flicks.
But it pains me far more to see Mr. Glover
imply that the student body and the adminis
tration condone such conduct in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. Such conduct is certain
ly not acceptable. To regard the Fundamental
Standard as being allowed by the administration
to sink to the status of "a worthless scrap of
paper" is indeed to insult the University.
However, when the sensibilities of the flick
patrons are degraded by having to watch a film
on the life of that quasi-fascist demagogue, Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, then the student body
has a right to protest.
Even as the student body, under rare circum
stances, may give vent to their feelings, so Mr.
Glover has the right to denounce such expres
sion. At Stanford "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht"
(The Wind of Freedom Blows). Freedom of
thought is encouraged in all individuals, even if
Mr. Glover chooses to print those thoughts in
impolite language and chooses to display his ap
parent pro-fascist sympathies.

An Aesthetic Insensibility
Editor, The Daily:
Our first letter was, quite evidently, an emo
tive outpouring, a catharsis of the annoyance
engendered by the events at the Sunday night
"flicks." But certain criticisms were indeed im
plied and it might be worth while to explore
them now that our tempers have subsided.
To begin with, we want it understood that we
were not criticizing the audience reaction to the
movie. For an audience to heckle or jeer or make
a commotion to express its dislike or disapproval
is a tradition extending from Athens to even the
Secretary of Agriculture. The point of the mat
ter is lhat there was no audience. The crowd
was not reacting to the movie. (It would be a
digression to discuss the archaic notion that the
aesthetic character of a work depends on the
morality or inherent worth of the subject matter,
as suggested by Mr. Freeman. That there was

some aesthetic quality is all that is necessary to
the discussion.)
The conclusion that the mob was not reacting
to the movie at all, leads us to ask, "What, if
anything, were these people reacting to?" Our
answer, and 1 his is the thing to nebate, is that
the people were reacting to the pressures of the
campus society in that the campus mores de
mand that one be a buffoon at. football games,
beer busts and Sunday Night Flicks. This an
swer cuts to the very roots of the University.
For what kind of University have we where:
© There are such pressures of behavioral con
formity, and
© There are so many persons who unknowing
ly succumb to these pressures.
One result, we suggest, has been an aesthetic
insensibility and a jejune cultural atmosphere.
The occurrence, by the way, of a variety of
events called "cultural" does not itself make a
cultural society. A symphony is not merely a
conglomeration of notes.

An Aesthetic Insensibility
Editor, The Daily:
Our first letter was, quite evidently, an emo
tive outpouring, a catharsis of the annoyance
engendered by the events at the Sunday night
"flicks." But certain criticisms were indeed im
plied and it might be worth while to explore
them now that our tempers have subsided.
To begin with, we want it understood that we
were not criticizing the audience reaction to the
movie. For an audience to heckle or jeer or make
a commotion to express its dislike or disapproval
is a tradition extending from Athens to even the
Secretary of Agriculture. The point of the mat
ter is lhat there was no audience. The crowd
was not reacting to the movie. (It would be a
digression to discuss the archaic notion that the
aesthetic character of a work depends on the
morality or inherent worth of the subject matter,
as suggested by Mr. Freeman. That there was

some aesthetic quality is all that is necessary to
the discussion.)
The conclusion that the mob was not reacting
to the movie at all, leads us to ask, "What, if
anything, were these people reacting to?" Our
answer, and 1 his is the thing to nebate, is that
the people were reacting to the pressures of the
campus society in that the campus mores de
mand that one be a buffoon at. football games,
beer busts and Sunday Night Flicks. This an
swer cuts to the very roots of the University.
For what kind of University have we where:
© There are such pressures of behavioral con
formity, and
© There are so many persons who unknowing
ly succumb to these pressures.
One result, we suggest, has been an aesthetic
insensibility and a jejune cultural atmosphere.
The occurrence, by the way, of a variety of
events called "cultural" does not itself make a
cultural society. A symphony is not merely a
conglomeration of notes.
Morton and Shirley Schagrin
Local Bookstores Available
Editor, The Daily:
On Monday, Oct. 7, your columnist David Egger
wrote fin the problem of finding books—books of
all kinds for a scholarly community—at either
1he Stanford Bookstore or in the Palo Alto area.
He suggested that the present book'situation for
booklovers is one of "do without or else catch
the next train to San Francisco. . . . The situation
would not be so bad if Palo Alto were simply
alive with bookstores — new-book stores, used
book stores, paperback-book stores. But after
Kepler's, what?"
Writing on behalf of Ihc booksellers in the Palo
Alto area, I would like to point out —as flattering
as the reference was—that before Kepler's there
were, and are, a number of fine bookstores wait
ing to help serve your needs: Bell's College Book
store, on Emerson Street; Shirley Cobb's Books,
on University Avenue; Peninsula Books, in Town
& Country Village; and Kay's Books, in Los Altos.
All these stores, have books to be, in Mr.
Egger's phrase, "handled, perused and/or pur
chased." But, more than that, all these book
sellers are as concerned as any member of the
Stanford community to build a genuine book com
munity suitable to an area boasting a major uni
versity and related scholarly activities.
Our efforts fall short of the goal in good part
because of the peculiar problems that arise in a
situation where the campus Bookstore sells at a
rebate of 20 per cent, which for technical and text
books represents the complete margin available
1o the ordinary bookseller. In short, we are in
competition with a wholesale book-selling opera
tion, and none of us can afford to give books
away at our cost. Why aren't there more book
lovers perusing, handling and/or buying our
books? Because the Stanford Bookstore, like
Jerome Weidman's hero, can get it for you whole
sale!
The present rebate system nurtures many of
1he shortcomings of the book situation generally.
For example, if a bookstore in the community
puts into stock certain scholarly or technical
books not being stockcd elsewhere, including the
Stanford Bookstore, University people—faculty
and students—will discover and "peruse" these
new books; but 1he greater percentage of them
will then go to the Stanford Bookstore to place
1heir orders. Why? Because they want the re
bate.
But what is the result? The enterprising book
seller in ihe community has a white elephant on
his hands; his expensive stock becomes almost
unsellable; his potential customers have deserted
him. Hence, he closes out that part of his stock
with as little loss as possible and replaces it with
best sellers for lady shoppers.
In May of this year the Palo Alto Area Book
sellers Association sent a letter 1o Dr. George
Parks, president of the board of directors of the
Stanford Bookstore", outlining these and related
problems which must be solved if there is to be
a cooperative effort to develop a book commu
nity, and asked for the opportunity to meet with
Dr. Parks and his board of directors to discuss
common problems. I sorrowfully report that Dr.
Parks, in his brief reply, disdained even acknowl
edging our request for a meeting. However, there
was no indication in his letter that he had shared
our communication with members of his board.
From subsequent conversations with faculty
members (including members of the Board of
Governors), students and administrators, we are
hopeful that Dr. Parks' views are not widely
shared and that there are 1hose who will be will
ing to hear our case before ruling out entirely
the usefulness of creating, through cooperation
between town and gown, an enlarged book com
munity with strength in variety, diversity and
depth.
Your columnist's advice to booklovers- -to catch

the next train to San Francisco—understandably
enough, I trust, disturbs those of us who sell
books in this area and who would like very much
• to sell more of them to the University commu
nity. Nevertheless, it is regrettably true that the
combined stock of all stores in the area, includ
ing. the Stanford Bookstore, still leaves gaps that
should be filled. ' Unfortunately, many of these
gaps consist of scholarly and technical books
which a bookseller cannot afford to stock unless
he has some reasonable assurance of being able
to sell enough of them to carry that part of his
operation.
With the rapid development of industrial groups
around Stanford indeed, all along the Peninsula
—local booksellers were hopeful that the new
customer potential would warrant the risks. But,
to our chagrin, we have discovered that many of
these companies offer their employees—as a
"fringe benefit," according, to Dr. Parks—the
right to shop at the Stanford "PX"; this through
the Stanford Honors Cooperative Program.
There is a certain irony that the University so
closely associated with the name Hoover should
have accepted the monopolistic development of
one over-all bookstore selling merchandise at re
bates so great that smaller, privately-owned en
terprises in the community cannot begin to com

the next train to San Francisco. . . . The situation
would not be so bad if Palo Alto were simply
alive with bookstores — new-book stores, used
book stores, paperback-book stores. But after
Kepler's, what?"
Writing on behalf of Ihc booksellers in the Palo
Alto area, I would like to point out —as flattering
as the reference was—that before Kepler's there
were, and are, a number of fine bookstores wait
ing to help serve your needs: Bell's College Book
store, on Emerson Street; Shirley Cobb's Books,
on University Avenue; Peninsula Books, in Town
& Country Village; and Kay's Books, in Los Altos.
All these stores, have books to be, in Mr.
Egger's phrase, "handled, perused and/or pur
chased." But, more than that, all these book
sellers are as concerned as any member of the
Stanford community to build a genuine book com
munity suitable to an area boasting a major uni
versity and related scholarly activities.
Our efforts fall short of the goal in good part
because of the peculiar problems that arise in a
situation where the campus Bookstore sells at a
rebate of 20 per cent, which for technical and text
books represents the complete margin available
1o the ordinary bookseller. In short, we are in
competition with a wholesale book-selling opera
tion, and none of us can afford to give books
away at our cost. Why aren't there more book
lovers perusing, handling and/or buying our
books? Because the Stanford Bookstore, like
Jerome Weidman's hero, can get it for you whole
sale!
The present rebate system nurtures many of
1he shortcomings of the book situation generally.
For example, if a bookstore in the community
puts into stock certain scholarly or technical
books not being stockcd elsewhere, including the
Stanford Bookstore, University people—faculty
and students—will discover and "peruse" these
new books; but 1he greater percentage of them
will then go to the Stanford Bookstore to place
1heir orders. Why? Because they want the re
bate.
But what is the result? The enterprising book
seller in ihe community has a white elephant on
his hands; his expensive stock becomes almost
unsellable; his potential customers have deserted
him. Hence, he closes out that part of his stock
with as little loss as possible and replaces it with
best sellers for lady shoppers.
In May of this year the Palo Alto Area Book
sellers Association sent a letter 1o Dr. George
Parks, president of the board of directors of the
Stanford Bookstore", outlining these and related
problems which must be solved if there is to be
a cooperative effort to develop a book commu
nity, and asked for the opportunity to meet with
Dr. Parks and his board of directors to discuss
common problems. I sorrowfully report that Dr.
Parks, in his brief reply, disdained even acknowl
edging our request for a meeting. However, there
was no indication in his letter that he had shared
our communication with members of his board.
From subsequent conversations with faculty
members (including members of the Board of
Governors), students and administrators, we are
hopeful that Dr. Parks' views are not widely
shared and that there are 1hose who will be will
ing to hear our case before ruling out entirely
the usefulness of creating, through cooperation
between town and gown, an enlarged book com
munity with strength in variety, diversity and
depth.
Your columnist's advice to booklovers- -to catch

the next train to San Francisco—understandably
enough, I trust, disturbs those of us who sell
books in this area and who would like very much
• to sell more of them to the University commu
nity. Nevertheless, it is regrettably true that the
combined stock of all stores in the area, includ
ing. the Stanford Bookstore, still leaves gaps that
should be filled. ' Unfortunately, many of these
gaps consist of scholarly and technical books
which a bookseller cannot afford to stock unless
he has some reasonable assurance of being able
to sell enough of them to carry that part of his
operation.
With the rapid development of industrial groups
around Stanford indeed, all along the Peninsula
—local booksellers were hopeful that the new
customer potential would warrant the risks. But,
to our chagrin, we have discovered that many of
these companies offer their employees—as a
"fringe benefit," according, to Dr. Parks—the
right to shop at the Stanford "PX"; this through
the Stanford Honors Cooperative Program.
There is a certain irony that the University so
closely associated with the name Hoover should
have accepted the monopolistic development of
one over-all bookstore selling merchandise at re
bates so great that smaller, privately-owned en
terprises in the community cannot begin to com
pete; rebates so high indeed that, far from de
veloping a Palo Alto "simply alive with book
stores," as your columnist wished, two Palo Alto
bookstores on University Avenue went into bank
ruptcy last May. Where were the booklovers?
"Doing without" presumably- and collecting re
bates.
We are attempting again to arrange a meeting
with the proper representatives of the Univer
sity's and the Bookstore's interests and responsi
bilities. A university ihe size of Stanford cannot
help but have a great impact on the outlying com
munity, and one of the problems is that the non-
University community will suffer if bookselling
declines exccpt at. the Bookstore on the campus.
The experience of hundreds of other university
and college communities," however, testifies to the
fact that this need not be so, but rather—as at. the
University of California in Berkeley—a compre
hensive book community can immeasurably bene
fit both the university and the wider community.
Friendly cooperation is all that is necessary.

I am afraid Mr. Glover (in Monday's Letter
to the Editor) has misunderstood my original
argument regarding the misconduct of the Stan
ford student body at the Sunday Night Flicks.
It is to my regret that such conduct does persist
at the flicks.
But it pains me far more to see Mr. Glover
imply that the student body and the adminis
tration condone such conduct in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. Such conduct is certain
ly not acceptable. To regard the Fundamental
Standard as being allowed by the administration
to sink to the status of "a worthless scrap of
paper" is indeed to insult the University.
However, when the sensibilities of the flick
patrons are degraded by having to watch a film
on the life of that quasi-fascist demagogue, Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, then the student body
has a right to protest.
Even as the student body, under rare circum
stances, may give vent to their feelings, so Mr.
Glover has the right to denounce such expres
sion. At Stanford "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht"
(The Wind of Freedom Blows). Freedom of
thought is encouraged in all individuals, even if
Mr. Glover chooses to print those thoughts in
impolite language and chooses to display his ap

An Aesthetic Insensibility
Editor, The Daily:
Our first letter was, quite evidently, an emo
tive outpouring, a catharsis of the annoyance
engendered by the events at the Sunday night
"flicks." But certain criticisms were indeed im
plied and it might be worth while to explore
them now that our tempers have subsided.
To begin with, we want it understood that we
were not criticizing the audience reaction to the
movie. For an audience to heckle or jeer or make
a commotion to express its dislike or disapproval
is a tradition extending from Athens to even the
Secretary of Agriculture. The point of the mat
ter is lhat there was no audience. The crowd
was not reacting to the movie. (It would be a
digression to discuss the archaic notion that the
aesthetic character of a work depends on the
morality or inherent worth of the subject matter,
as suggested by Mr. Freeman. That there was

some aesthetic quality is all that is necessary to
the discussion.)
The conclusion that the mob was not reacting
to the movie at all, leads us to ask, "What, if
anything, were these people reacting to?" Our
answer, and 1 his is the thing to nebate, is that
the people were reacting to the pressures of the
campus society in that the campus mores de
mand that one be a buffoon at. football games,
beer busts and Sunday Night Flicks. This an
swer cuts to the very roots of the University.
For what kind of University have we where:
© There are such pressures of behavioral con
formity, and
© There are so many persons who unknowing
ly succumb to these pressures.
One result, we suggest, has been an aesthetic
insensibility and a jejune cultural atmosphere.
The occurrence, by the way, of a variety of
events called "cultural" does not itself make a
cultural society. A symphony is not merely a
conglomeration of notes.

An Aesthetic Insensibility
Editor, The Daily:
Our first letter was, quite evidently, an emo
tive outpouring, a catharsis of the annoyance
engendered by the events at the Sunday night
"flicks." But certain criticisms were indeed im
plied and it might be worth while to explore
them now that our tempers have subsided.
To begin with, we want it understood that we
were not criticizing the audience reaction to the
movie. For an audience to heckle or jeer or make
a commotion to express its dislike or disapproval
is a tradition extending from Athens to even the
Secretary of Agriculture. The point of the mat
ter is lhat there was no audience. The crowd
was not reacting to the movie. (It would be a
digression to discuss the archaic notion that the
aesthetic character of a work depends on the
morality or inherent worth of the subject matter,
as suggested by Mr. Freeman. That there was

some aesthetic quality is all that is necessary to
the discussion.)
The conclusion that the mob was not reacting
to the movie at all, leads us to ask, "What, if
anything, were these people reacting to?" Our
answer, and 1 his is the thing to nebate, is that
the people were reacting to the pressures of the
campus society in that the campus mores de
mand that one be a buffoon at. football games,
beer busts and Sunday Night Flicks. This an
swer cuts to the very roots of the University.
For what kind of University have we where:
© There are such pressures of behavioral con
formity, and
© There are so many persons who unknowing
ly succumb to these pressures.
One result, we suggest, has been an aesthetic
insensibility and a jejune cultural atmosphere.
The occurrence, by the way, of a variety of
events called "cultural" does not itself make a
cultural society. A symphony is not merely a
conglomeration of notes.
Morton and Shirley Schagrin
Local Bookstores Available
Editor, The Daily:
On Monday, Oct. 7, your columnist David Egger
wrote fin the problem of finding books—books of
all kinds for a scholarly community—at either
1he Stanford Bookstore or in the Palo Alto area.
He suggested that the present book'situation for
booklovers is one of "do without or else catch
the next train to San Francisco. . . . The situation
would not be so bad if Palo Alto were simply
alive with bookstores — new-book stores, used
book stores, paperback-book stores. But after
Kepler's, what?"
Writing on behalf of Ihc booksellers in the Palo
Alto area, I would like to point out —as flattering
as the reference was—that before Kepler's there
were, and are, a number of fine bookstores wait
ing to help serve your needs: Bell's College Book
store, on Emerson Street; Shirley Cobb's Books,
on University Avenue; Peninsula Books, in Town
& Country Village; and Kay's Books, in Los Altos.
All these stores, have books to be, in Mr.
Egger's phrase, "handled, perused and/or pur
chased." But, more than that, all these book
sellers are as concerned as any member of the
Stanford community to build a genuine book com
munity suitable to an area boasting a major uni
versity and related scholarly activities.
Our efforts fall short of the goal in good part
because of the peculiar problems that arise in a
situation where the campus Bookstore sells at a
rebate of 20 per cent, which for technical and text
books represents the complete margin available
1o the ordinary bookseller. In short, we are in
competition with a wholesale book-selling opera
tion, and none of us can afford to give books
away at our cost. Why aren't there more book
lovers perusing, handling and/or buying our
books? Because the Stanford Bookstore, like
Jerome Weidman's hero, can get it for you whole
sale!
The present rebate system nurtures many of
1he shortcomings of the book situation generally.
For example, if a bookstore in the community
puts into stock certain scholarly or technical
books not being stockcd elsewhere, including the
Stanford Bookstore, University people—faculty
and students—will discover and "peruse" these
new books; but 1he greater percentage of them
will then go to the Stanford Bookstore to place
1heir orders. Why? Because they want the re
bate.
But what is the result? The enterprising book
seller in ihe community has a white elephant on
his hands; his expensive stock becomes almost
unsellable; his potential customers have deserted
him. Hence, he closes out that part of his stock
with as little loss as possible and replaces it with
best sellers for lady shoppers.
In May of this year the Palo Alto Area Book
sellers Association sent a letter 1o Dr. George
Parks, president of the board of directors of the
Stanford Bookstore", outlining these and related
problems which must be solved if there is to be
a cooperative effort to develop a book commu
nity, and asked for the opportunity to meet with
Dr. Parks and his board of directors to discuss
common problems. I sorrowfully report that Dr.
Parks, in his brief reply, disdained even acknowl
edging our request for a meeting. However, there
was no indication in his letter that he had shared
our communication with members of his board.
From subsequent conversations with faculty
members (including members of the Board of
Governors), students and administrators, we are
hopeful that Dr. Parks' views are not widely
shared and that there are 1hose who will be will
ing to hear our case before ruling out entirely
the usefulness of creating, through cooperation
between town and gown, an enlarged book com
munity with strength in variety, diversity and
depth.
Your columnist's advice to booklovers- -to catch

the next train to San Francisco—understandably
enough, I trust, disturbs those of us who sell
books in this area and who would like very much
• to sell more of them to the University commu
nity. Nevertheless, it is regrettably true that the
combined stock of all stores in the area, includ
ing. the Stanford Bookstore, still leaves gaps that
should be filled. ' Unfortunately, many of these
gaps consist of scholarly and technical books
which a bookseller cannot afford to stock unless
he has some reasonable assurance of being able
to sell enough of them to carry that part of his
operation.
With the rapid development of industrial groups
around Stanford indeed, all along the Peninsula
—local booksellers were hopeful that the new
customer potential would warrant the risks. But,
to our chagrin, we have discovered that many of
these companies offer their employees—as a
"fringe benefit," according, to Dr. Parks—the
right to shop at the Stanford "PX"; this through
the Stanford Honors Cooperative Program.
There is a certain irony that the University so
closely associated with the name Hoover should
have accepted the monopolistic development of
one over-all bookstore selling merchandise at re
bates so great that smaller, privately-owned en
terprises in the community cannot begin to com
pete; rebates so high indeed that, far from de
veloping a Palo Alto "simply alive with book
stores," as your columnist wished, two Palo Alto
bookstores on University Avenue went into bank
ruptcy last May. Where were the booklovers?
"Doing without" presumably- and collecting re

Alto area, I would like to point out —as flattering
as the reference was—that before Kepler's there
were, and are, a number of fine bookstores wait
ing to help serve your needs: Bell's College Book
store, on Emerson Street; Shirley Cobb's Books,
on University Avenue; Peninsula Books, in Town
& Country Village; and Kay's Books, in Los Altos.
All these stores, have books to be, in Mr.
Egger's phrase, "handled, perused and/or pur
chased." But, more than that, all these book
sellers are as concerned as any member of the
Stanford community to build a genuine book com
munity suitable to an area boasting a major uni
versity and related scholarly activities.
Our efforts fall short of the goal in good part
because of the peculiar problems that arise in a
situation where the campus Bookstore sells at a
rebate of 20 per cent, which for technical and text
books represents the complete margin available
1o the ordinary bookseller. In short, we are in
competition with a wholesale book-selling opera
tion, and none of us can afford to give books
away at our cost. Why aren't there more book
lovers perusing, handling and/or buying our
books? Because the Stanford Bookstore, like
Jerome Weidman's hero, can get it for you whole
sale!
The present rebate system nurtures many of
1he shortcomings of the book situation generally.
For example, if a bookstore in the community
puts into stock certain scholarly or technical
books not being stockcd elsewhere, including the
Stanford Bookstore, University people—faculty
and students—will discover and "peruse" these
new books; but 1he greater percentage of them
will then go to the Stanford Bookstore to place
1heir orders. Why? Because they want the re
bate.
But what is the result? The enterprising book
seller in ihe community has a white elephant on
his hands; his expensive stock becomes almost
unsellable; his potential customers have deserted
him. Hence, he closes out that part of his stock
with as little loss as possible and replaces it with
best sellers for lady shoppers.
In May of this year the Palo Alto Area Book
sellers Association sent a letter 1o Dr. George
Parks, president of the board of directors of the
Stanford Bookstore", outlining these and related
problems which must be solved if there is to be
a cooperative effort to develop a book commu
nity, and asked for the opportunity to meet with
Dr. Parks and his board of directors to discuss
common problems. I sorrowfully report that Dr.
Parks, in his brief reply, disdained even acknowl
edging our request for a meeting. However, there
was no indication in his letter that he had shared
our communication with members of his board.
From subsequent conversations with faculty
members (including members of the Board of
Governors), students and administrators, we are
hopeful that Dr. Parks' views are not widely
shared and that there are 1hose who will be will
ing to hear our case before ruling out entirely
the usefulness of creating, through cooperation
between town and gown, an enlarged book com
munity with strength in variety, diversity and
depth.
Your columnist's advice to booklovers- -to catch

the next train to San Francisco—understandably
enough, I trust, disturbs those of us who sell
books in this area and who would like very much
• to sell more of them to the University commu
nity. Nevertheless, it is regrettably true that the
combined stock of all stores in the area, includ
ing. the Stanford Bookstore, still leaves gaps that
should be filled. ' Unfortunately, many of these
gaps consist of scholarly and technical books
which a bookseller cannot afford to stock unless
he has some reasonable assurance of being able
to sell enough of them to carry that part of his
operation.
With the rapid development of industrial groups
around Stanford indeed, all along the Peninsula
—local booksellers were hopeful that the new
customer potential would warrant the risks. But,
to our chagrin, we have discovered that many of
these companies offer their employees—as a
"fringe benefit," according, to Dr. Parks—the
right to shop at the Stanford "PX"; this through
the Stanford Honors Cooperative Program.
There is a certain irony that the University so
closely associated with the name Hoover should
have accepted the monopolistic development of
one over-all bookstore selling merchandise at re
bates so great that smaller, privately-owned en
terprises in the community cannot begin to com
pete; rebates so high indeed that, far from de
veloping a Palo Alto "simply alive with book
stores," as your columnist wished, two Palo Alto
bookstores on University Avenue went into bank
ruptcy last May. Where were the booklovers?
"Doing without" presumably- and collecting re
bates.
We are attempting again to arrange a meeting
with the proper representatives of the Univer
sity's and the Bookstore's interests and responsi
bilities. A university ihe size of Stanford cannot
help but have a great impact on the outlying com
munity, and one of the problems is that the non-
University community will suffer if bookselling
declines exccpt at. the Bookstore on the campus.
The experience of hundreds of other university
and college communities," however, testifies to the
fact that this need not be so, but rather—as at. the
University of California in Berkeley—a compre
hensive book community can immeasurably bene
fit both the university and the wider community.
Friendly cooperation is all that is necessary.

Editor, The Daily:
I am afraid Mr. Glover (in Monday's Letter
to the Editor) has misunderstood my original
argument regarding the misconduct of the Stan
ford student body at the Sunday Night Flicks.
It is to my regret that such conduct does persist
at the flicks.
But it pains me far more to see Mr. Glover
imply that the student body and the adminis
tration condone such conduct in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. Such conduct is certain
ly not acceptable. To regard the Fundamental
Standard as being allowed by the administration
to sink to the status of "a worthless scrap of
paper" is indeed to insult the University.
However, when the sensibilities of the flick
patrons are degraded by having to watch a film
on the life of that quasi-fascist demagogue, Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, then the student body
has a right to protest.
Even as the student body, under rare circum
stances, may give vent to their feelings, so Mr.
Glover has the right to denounce such expres
sion. At Stanford "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht"
(The Wind of Freedom Blows). Freedom of
thought is encouraged in all individuals, even if
Mr. Glover chooses to print those thoughts in
impolite language and chooses to display his ap
parent pro-fascist sympathies.

An Aesthetic Insensibility
Editor, The Daily:
Our first letter was, quite evidently, an emo
tive outpouring, a catharsis of the annoyance
engendered by the events at the Sunday night
"flicks." But certain criticisms were indeed im
plied and it might be worth while to explore
them now that our tempers have subsided.
To begin with, we want it understood that we
were not criticizing the audience reaction to the
movie. For an audience to heckle or jeer or make
a commotion to express its dislike or disapproval
is a tradition extending from Athens to even the
Secretary of Agriculture. The point of the mat
ter is lhat there was no audience. The crowd
was not reacting to the movie. (It would be a
digression to discuss the archaic notion that the
aesthetic character of a work depends on the
morality or inherent worth of the subject matter,
as suggested by Mr. Freeman. That there was

some aesthetic quality is all that is necessary to
the discussion.)
The conclusion that the mob was not reacting
to the movie at all, leads us to ask, "What, if
anything, were these people reacting to?" Our
answer, and 1 his is the thing to nebate, is that
the people were reacting to the pressures of the
campus society in that the campus mores de
mand that one be a buffoon at. football games,
beer busts and Sunday Night Flicks. This an
swer cuts to the very roots of the University.
For what kind of University have we where:
© There are such pressures of behavioral con
formity, and
© There are so many persons who unknowing
ly succumb to these pressures.
One result, we suggest, has been an aesthetic
insensibility and a jejune cultural atmosphere.
The occurrence, by the way, of a variety of
events called "cultural" does not itself make a
cultural society. A symphony is not merely a
conglomeration of notes.

Local Bookstores Available
Editor, The Daily:
On Monday, Oct. 7, your columnist David Egger
wrote fin the problem of finding books—books of
all kinds for a scholarly community—at either
1he Stanford Bookstore or in the Palo Alto area.
He suggested that the present book'situation for
booklovers is one of "do without or else catch
the next train to San Francisco. . . . The situation
would not be so bad if Palo Alto were simply
alive with bookstores — new-book stores, used
book stores, paperback-book stores. But after
Kepler's, what?"
