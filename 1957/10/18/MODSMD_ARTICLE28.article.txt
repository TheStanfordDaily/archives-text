The History, of Western Civilization
In the beginning there was no Western Civilization . . .
Throughout Europe, Britain and the Americas, simple peoples lived
in relative harmony. Some, like the Eskimos, didn't even have a word (or
the concept) "war. ' Indeed, life was on a primitive, uncivilized level.
Then a flourishing Civilization emerged in Greece. Within a few
hundred years the Creeks destroyed and emasculated their society through
unending internecine warfare.
Next, the short swords were taken up by the simple, sturdy Romans,
who in a few hundred years conquered the world and brought Civilization
through a never-ending series of wars. This culminated in the Dark Ages.
In the age of chivalry a new feudal society carrying the Christian
banner brought Civilization through warfare to Europe. Christ's soldiers
bludgeoned their way to (he Holy Land, and Allah's warriors slashed into
southern France and to Constantinople.
Civilization flourished.
Came the Renaissance, Machiavelli and the Borgias. Poison, knife,
bribery and war carried Civilization to new heights. The Christians,' having
defeated the Moslems, now carried on great wars among themselves as
Protcoi <-int and Catholic smotfe and burned one another. The Jews were
confined, between pogroms, in Ghcttoes.
Religion and Western Civilization grew ever greater.
In the 16th and 17th Centuries the Nation States and Absolute
Monarchs carved new places in the sun. Men died, women wept, children
starved and Civilization flourished.
The French Revolution for Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite "liberated"
thousands from their lives in France and Europe. It brought "equality"
through the Levee en masse: all were equally conscripted. The "fraternity"
was that of arms as wars were fought from 1790 until 1815.
i , <^V 3 !o Lib<: ; rt ® cmer 8 ecl the dictator Napoleon. Civilization flourished.
In 181 j Napoleon fell. The Congress of Vienna settled matters so well
that in the years following, Civilization flourished as wars and incipient
revolutions broke out all over Europe.
Britain enlarged and consolidated its empire, its fleet, operating by
bomb and sword, bringing Civilization to the "Lesser Breeds."
The United States, victorious in its war against Britain, brought Civili
zation to the American Indian* throughout the 19th Century—by massacre
alcohol, lies, concentration camps, making and breaking treaties, war and
other civilized methods. This effort was so successful that by 1900 there
was hardly an uncivilized Indian left. In fact, there was hardly an Indian
All this brought us to the 20th Century, World Wars I and II the

The History, of Western Civilization
In the beginning there was no Western Civilization . . .
Throughout Europe, Britain and the Americas, simple peoples lived
in relative harmony. Some, like the Eskimos, didn't even have a word (or
the concept) "war. ' Indeed, life was on a primitive, uncivilized level.
Then a flourishing Civilization emerged in Greece. Within a few
hundred years the Creeks destroyed and emasculated their society through
unending internecine warfare.
Next, the short swords were taken up by the simple, sturdy Romans,
who in a few hundred years conquered the world and brought Civilization
through a never-ending series of wars. This culminated in the Dark Ages.
