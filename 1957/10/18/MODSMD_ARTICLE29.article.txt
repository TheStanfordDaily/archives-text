# UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITY?
## Student Subpoenaed for Visiting Red China 
### David Egger 
Editor's Note: This is the
last In a series of three articles
on the experiences of Karl R.
Williamson who made an un
authorized visit to Bed China
during the summer.

After spending 23 days in Red
China, Earl Williamson, entering
Hong Kong, was startled by the
incongruous appearance of a
modern, bustling Western city—
cars, dirty congested streets, sky
scrapers under construction —•
populated by Chinese, and con
taining buildings of both Chinese
and Western architecture.
Culturally, Hong Kong is the
meeting place of East and West.
As .Red China's sole trading post
with the Western nations, Hong
Kong was alive with activity. For
the first time in more than three
weeks. Williamson saw Western
ers other than his traveling com
panions and also encountered nu
merous beggars.
Williamson reported that he
saw only two beggars in Red
China. About 30 newsmen, for
bidden to enter Commu n i st
China, eagerly sought to inter
view Williamson immediately
upon his arrival and questioned
him nearly two hours.
The next day he was invited to
visit the British consulate. Once
there he discovered that the Eng
lish did not want to sec him at
all—the Americans did.
Why hadn't they asked him di
rectly? "To avoid confusion with
the press," the English official
explained. Williamson, interro
gated by a special U.S. govern
ment investigator, was finally dis
missed and allowed to take pic
tures of his questioner and other
consulate personnel. Then he
caught a plane for Honolulu.
Landing at the airport, he
passed through customs without
any hitches and was talking to a
newsman when a customs offi
cial ran up to him and asked to
see his passport again for a mo
ment.. Williamson complied only
to be told that his passport would
not be returned. He is still wait
ing to get it back.
When he arrived at the airport
in San Francisco Sept. 17, he met
with another surprise, a sub
poena to appear before the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee on Sept. 26. This has subse
quently been postponed until Oct.
22. Williamson said, "I don't
rhink what I did was un-Ameri

can. I think it was good for
America."
The legal ramifications of Wil
liamson's case are not clear. He
violated a State Department reg
ulation in traveling to Red China,
but no one has ever been pun
ished for such an offense in the
past. The laws involved have not
been tested by the Supreme
Court, and some legal experts be
lieve them to be unconstitutional.
Williamson was told that he will
get his passport back "once he
admits that he broke the law and
promises never to do it again."
Williamson's main concern is
whether -or not his trip may im
pair his career as a teacher. But,
he said, "I do not think that the
government is trying to terrorize
me or frighten me. •Perhaps the
officials (of the House Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee) are
just as curious about Red China
as I was."
He is not in the least regretful
about his decision to go to Red

China. He does not share the be
lief of a recent acquaintance, a
Stanford coed, who questioned
him about his experiences. She
listened to his account with fas
cination, then said, "I still don't
think you should have gone, if it
wasn't right."
During his trip he learned
much about two Communist na
tions. He met interested people

from his own country as well as
from nearly every other part of
the world. Throughout his jour
ney Williamson took hundreds of
pictures, any part or all of which
he is eager to show.
Williamson has expressed the
desire to talk to Stanford groups
of any size and can be reached
evenings by phone at DA 6-7341.
lie wants to tell his fellow Amor

icans about what he saw, he said.
He feels strongly that there must
be greater understanding be
tween nations.
"War means the end of civili
zation as we know it. The only
way to prevent this destruction
is to prevent war. The only way
to do this is to promote interre
lations between countries. What
other choice do we have?"
