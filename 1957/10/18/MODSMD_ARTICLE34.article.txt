# Cross-Country Team Gets First Test
## Harriers Face Cal, USC Tomorrow 
### 
The "best-knit" cross-country
team Stanford has seen in some
years takes to the hills for I lie
first lime tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.
in a race against California and
USC ct 1 Berkeley.
Indian track coach Payton Jor
dan is very enthused about this
year's harrier squad. The team
has shown good balance in work
outs. he said, and looks to have
"better potential than we've had
here in a long w+iile."
Three freshmen have broken
into the top seven positions and
will race for the Cards tomorrow.
The rest of the team is made up
of three lettermen plus Canadian
Norman Lloyd.
Junior Doug Martin, freshman
Keith Wallace and sophomore Bob
Monzingo have alternated at the
No. 1 spot throughout the October
workouts.
Back from '50
Martin returns from the 1956
team, where he was' one of the
mainstays. lie's recorded the sea
son's best mark on the golf course
layout, but lost the last race to
Wallace.
Wallace comes to Stanford with
an impressive high school record.
Last spring he finished fourth in
the California prop mile cham
pionship and had a best mark of
4:22.8.
Monzingo, the other member of
the Big Three, was the top dis
tance runner for last year's frosh
track team. In cross country he
also starred and was No. 1 man
for Stanford in several races.
Graves May Challenge
The unpredictable man of the
1956 cross-counlry team, Maury
Graves, is presently holding down
1 he fourth spot. Last year Graves
looked great in some races and
couldn't come close to the leaders
in others. He's back again, how
ever, and looks ready to challenge
the top trio.
Another of the freshmen, A1
Ahurnada, is one of the big sur
prises of the '57 hill- climbing
group. Ahurnada ran the mile in
4:39 for University High in Los
Angeles ;i creditable mark but
nothing outstanding.
So far 1 his fall, however, he's
been right up with the pack and
shows excellent promise of devel
oping into one of Stanford's bet
ter distance men.
Lloyd's Fool O.K.
Lloyd is slowly rounding into
shape for the coming campaign,
lie came to Stanford last year but
was out of action during most of
Hie track season with a broken
foot bone.
When he did perform at the tag
end of the season, lie looked good
and should prove a big help both
to the track and the cross-country
teams.
Several years older than most
of the Stanford runners, Lloyd's
best year was 1955, when he rep
resented London and Great Brit
ain in international competition.
Larry Suelzle, a first-year man
from Capuehino, has the inside
track for seventh place on the
team. His record is similar to
Ahumada's, although he'did run
about four seconds faster as a
prep.

Several men, notably junior
Bob McGuire, have been held back
in training by the flu. Jordan
rates McGuire, a transfer from
Ml. San Antonio JC, as a "key
man" in the 1957-58 plans and ex
pects him to crack the starting
seven as soon as he is well.
Bob Nolle and A 1 Salcedo have
also been laid low by the bug but
may join McGuire in running
against Cal and USC as extra
men.
Cards Rely on Depth
Stanford's hopes for victory lie
in team depth. Jordan doesn't ex
pect his men to run away from
such established stars as Max
Truex and Mai Robertson of the
Trojans, but he floes look for
Stanford to take enough of the
top 10 places to gain the team
victory.
Mavnard Orme is expected to
lead the Bear delegation, with
plenty of help from sub-four-min
ute-miler Don Bowden, if Bowden
runs.
The four-mile California course,
with its particularly steep start

afid narrow stretches, is expected
to provide a more than adequate
test of the three teams' cross
country abilities.
The remainder of the Stanford
I schedule:
Oct. 2(5 —UCLA and Cal at Stan
ford.
Nov. I—San1 —San Jose a'< Stanford;
Modesto JC at Stanford frosli.
Nov. 9—UCLA and USC at Los
Angeles.
Nov. 12 — Palo Alio High at
Stanford frosh.
Nov. 15 — All-Comers meet al
San Jose State.
Nov. 23 —California at Stanford.
Nov. 3(1 —PCC championships at
Los Angeles.

Lloyd's Fool O.K.
Lloyd is slowly rounding into
shape for the coming campaign,
lie came to Stanford last year but
was out of action during most of
Hie track season with a broken
foot bone.
When he did perform at the tag
end of the season, lie looked good
and should prove a big help both
to the track and the cross-country
teams.
Several years older than most
of the Stanford runners, Lloyd's
best year was 1955, when he rep
resented London and Great Brit
ain in international competition.
Larry Suelzle, a first-year man
from Capuehino, has the inside
track for seventh place on the
team. His record is similar to
Ahumada's, although he'did run
about four seconds faster as a
prep.

Several men, notably junior
Bob McGuire, have been held back
in training by the flu. Jordan
rates McGuire, a transfer from
Ml. San Antonio JC, as a "key
man" in the 1957-58 plans and ex
pects him to crack the starting
seven as soon as he is well.
Bob Nolle and A 1 Salcedo have
also been laid low by the bug but
may join McGuire in running
against Cal and USC as extra
men.
Cards Rely on Depth
Stanford's hopes for victory lie
in team depth. Jordan doesn't ex
pect his men to run away from
such established stars as Max
Truex and Mai Robertson of the
Trojans, but he floes look for
Stanford to take enough of the
top 10 places to gain the team
victory.
Mavnard Orme is expected to
lead the Bear delegation, with
plenty of help from sub-four-min
ute-miler Don Bowden, if Bowden
runs.
The four-mile California course,
with its particularly steep start

afid narrow stretches, is expected
to provide a more than adequate
test of the three teams' cross
country abilities.
The remainder of the Stanford
I schedule:
Oct. 2(5 —UCLA and Cal at Stan

The "best-knit" cross-country
team Stanford has seen in some
years takes to the hills for I lie
first lime tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.
in a race against California and
USC ct 1 Berkeley.
Indian track coach Payton Jor
dan is very enthused about this
year's harrier squad. The team
has shown good balance in work
outs. he said, and looks to have
"better potential than we've had
here in a long w+iile."
Three freshmen have broken
into the top seven positions and
will race for the Cards tomorrow.
The rest of the team is made up
of three lettermen plus Canadian
Norman Lloyd.
Junior Doug Martin, freshman
Keith Wallace and sophomore Bob
Monzingo have alternated at the
No. 1 spot throughout the October
workouts.
Back from '50
Martin returns from the 1956
team, where he was' one of the
mainstays. lie's recorded the sea
son's best mark on the golf course
layout, but lost the last race to
Wallace.
Wallace comes to Stanford with
an impressive high school record.
Last spring he finished fourth in
the California prop mile cham
pionship and had a best mark of
4:22.8.
Monzingo, the other member of
the Big Three, was the top dis
tance runner for last year's frosh
track team. In cross country he
also starred and was No. 1 man
for Stanford in several races.
Graves May Challenge
The unpredictable man of the
1956 cross-counlry team, Maury
Graves, is presently holding down
1 he fourth spot. Last year Graves
looked great in some races and
couldn't come close to the leaders
in others. He's back again, how
ever, and looks ready to challenge
the top trio.
Another of the freshmen, A1
Ahurnada, is one of the big sur
prises of the '57 hill- climbing
group. Ahurnada ran the mile in
4:39 for University High in Los
Angeles ;i creditable mark but
nothing outstanding.
So far 1 his fall, however, he's
been right up with the pack and
shows excellent promise of devel
oping into one of Stanford's bet

PAYTON JORDAN DISCUSSES HARRIER STRATEGY WITH DOUG MARTIN (LEFT)
AND Al> AHUM AD A
The "best-knit" cross-country
team Stanford has seen in some
years takes to the hills for I lie
first lime tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.
in a race against California and
USC ct 1 Berkeley.
Indian track coach Payton Jor
dan is very enthused about this
year's harrier squad. The team
has shown good balance in work
outs. he said, and looks to have
"better potential than we've had
here in a long w+iile."
Three freshmen have broken
into the top seven positions and
will race for the Cards tomorrow.
The rest of the team is made up
of three lettermen plus Canadian
Norman Lloyd.
Junior Doug Martin, freshman
Keith Wallace and sophomore Bob
Monzingo have alternated at the
No. 1 spot throughout the October
workouts.
Back from '50
Martin returns from the 1956
team, where he was' one of the
mainstays. lie's recorded the sea
son's best mark on the golf course
layout, but lost the last race to
Wallace.
Wallace comes to Stanford with
an impressive high school record.
Last spring he finished fourth in
the California prop mile cham
pionship and had a best mark of
4:22.8.
Monzingo, the other member of
the Big Three, was the top dis
tance runner for last year's frosh
track team. In cross country he
also starred and was No. 1 man
for Stanford in several races.
Graves May Challenge
The unpredictable man of the
1956 cross-counlry team, Maury
Graves, is presently holding down
1 he fourth spot. Last year Graves
looked great in some races and
couldn't come close to the leaders
in others. He's back again, how
ever, and looks ready to challenge
the top trio.
Another of the freshmen, A1
Ahurnada, is one of the big sur
prises of the '57 hill- climbing
group. Ahurnada ran the mile in
4:39 for University High in Los
Angeles ;i creditable mark but
nothing outstanding.
So far 1 his fall, however, he's
been right up with the pack and
shows excellent promise of devel
oping into one of Stanford's bet
ter distance men.
Lloyd's Fool O.K.
Lloyd is slowly rounding into
shape for the coming campaign,
lie came to Stanford last year but
was out of action during most of
Hie track season with a broken
foot bone.
When he did perform at the tag
end of the season, lie looked good
and should prove a big help both
to the track and the cross-country
teams.
Several years older than most
of the Stanford runners, Lloyd's
best year was 1955, when he rep
resented London and Great Brit
ain in international competition.
Larry Suelzle, a first-year man
from Capuehino, has the inside
track for seventh place on the
team. His record is similar to
Ahumada's, although he'did run
about four seconds faster as a
prep.

Several men, notably junior
Bob McGuire, have been held back
in training by the flu. Jordan
rates McGuire, a transfer from
Ml. San Antonio JC, as a "key
man" in the 1957-58 plans and ex
pects him to crack the starting
seven as soon as he is well.
Bob Nolle and A 1 Salcedo have
also been laid low by the bug but
may join McGuire in running
against Cal and USC as extra
men.
Cards Rely on Depth
Stanford's hopes for victory lie
in team depth. Jordan doesn't ex
pect his men to run away from
such established stars as Max
Truex and Mai Robertson of the
Trojans, but he floes look for
Stanford to take enough of the
top 10 places to gain the team
victory.
Mavnard Orme is expected to
lead the Bear delegation, with
plenty of help from sub-four-min
ute-miler Don Bowden, if Bowden
runs.
The four-mile California course,
with its particularly steep start

afid narrow stretches, is expected
to provide a more than adequate
test of the three teams' cross
country abilities.
The remainder of the Stanford
I schedule:
Oct. 2(5 —UCLA and Cal at Stan
ford.
Nov. I—San1 —San Jose a'< Stanford;
Modesto JC at Stanford frosli.
Nov. 9—UCLA and USC at Los
Angeles.
Nov. 12 — Palo Alio High at
Stanford frosh.
Nov. 15 — All-Comers meet al
San Jose State.
Nov. 23 —California at Stanford.
Nov. 3(1 —PCC championships at
