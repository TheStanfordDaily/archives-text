# SOCCER ‘BIG GAME’
## SU Booters Battle Bears Here 
### Jack Winkler 
It's "big game" time. Tlie Stan
ford soccer team meets California
in the only varsity athletic event
on campus this week end, at 11
tomorrow morning on llarry Ma
loney Field, next to the lennis
courts in front of Eneina Gym.
"It should be a close game,"
said coach John Priddie, "but I
will be very disappointed if we
don't win. This is our year. It we
win this one, we may take the
league title,"
One of the big reasons for Pi id
die's optimism is the .arrival of
Vic Van Hyse, 32-year-old inside
left from Belgium, who played his
first game for the Cards in the
5-0 romp <*ver Santa Clara last
Saturday.
International Stur
Van Hyse has represented his
nation in amateur international
matches around Europe, marking
him as one of the finest players
in Belgium. He scored Stanford's
I first goal last week.
Also starting against the Bears
tomorrow will be the newly elect
led co-captains, Ben Pentsil and
Mike Asafo-Boakye, the exchange
students from Ghana.
The California team figures 1o
be a very strong one on t he basis
of their 2-1 victory last week end
over City College of San Fran
cisco. Pablo Dibos, who will play
right wing for the Blue and Gold,
was an AII-American last year.
Deciding Coal
It was Dibos' goal with less
than three minutes remaining
that beat the Cards, 1-0, last year
at Berkeley. After 87 minutes of
hard, scoreless soccer, he banged
in a corner kick to knock Stanford
out of the league playoffs.
Dibos and his brother Joe are
among Cal's five returning letter
men. Another brother-pair, Ker
win and Joel Kwok from Korea,
and center half Hoffmann are also
lettermen. Joel Kwok scored Ihe

deciding goal last week against
i City College with less than two
I minutes remaining.
The Cal team bases its strength
on its forward line and on goalie
| Jim Becker, who was credited
with many spectacular saves in
last week's game.
Goalie Dittmaii
The Indians will start Bill Ditt-
J man in goal. He had a sensa
tional year last season as a sopho
more after just beginning as a
goalkeeper. He has not been scor
ed upon in 170 minutes' play this
year.
At backs will be last week's two
: starters who kept Santa Clara's
line completely ineffective. Bob
Shafer, one of that game's out
standing players, will open at left
back. Coach Priddie said: "He did
not make a mistake during the
whole time last week. He played
j the perfect game." Jeff Morby
will start at right back.
The halfback line will open with
Jim Bowditch, Asafo-Boakye and
j Spike Leonard, with Roger Do-
Weist, another Belgian, in reserve.
Top Scorer
Sophomore Keve Larson, the
squad's leading scorer with three
goals in two games, will start at
center forward. Priddie says,"He
has improved immensely this
year," and is one of the big dif
ferences in the forward 1i n <?,
which has shown more punch and
much sharper passing than at any
time last season.
At the insides will be Pentsil
and Van Hyse. The Belgian is in
that rare University status which
places him between graduate and
undergraduate and still allows
him to compete in varsity alh
letics.
At Hie wings will be Jack Wink
ler and Udo Nkomare from Ni
geria. Nkomare played wing for
the first time against the Broncos
and has earned himself a perma
nent position.

Skipp Lord, John Veltman, Pe-,
ter Kiers, Steve Welch and Tony
Chanler will also play for the
Cards as reserves.
"We have a stronger team this j
year than last,' said Priddie. "We
are more well rounded and not so
dependent on one or two stars.

I will be surprised if we don't
win."
Stanford's league record is now
1-1, after an opening loss to the
University of San Francisco, 2 1,
in the city two weeks ago.

cede the "big game" at .10 a.m.

matches around Europe, marking
him as one of the finest players
in Belgium. He scored Stanford's
I first goal last week.
Also starting against the Bears
tomorrow will be the newly elect
led co-captains, Ben Pentsil and
Mike Asafo-Boakye, the exchange
students from Ghana.
The California team figures 1o
be a very strong one on t he basis
of their 2-1 victory last week end
over City College of San Fran
cisco. Pablo Dibos, who will play
right wing for the Blue and Gold,
was an AII-American last year.
Deciding Coal
It was Dibos' goal with less
than three minutes remaining
that beat the Cards, 1-0, last year
at Berkeley. After 87 minutes of
hard, scoreless soccer, he banged
in a corner kick to knock Stanford
out of the league playoffs.
Dibos and his brother Joe are
among Cal's five returning letter
men. Another brother-pair, Ker
win and Joel Kwok from Korea,
and center half Hoffmann are also
lettermen. Joel Kwok scored Ihe

deciding goal last week against
i City College with less than two
I minutes remaining.
The Cal team bases its strength
on its forward line and on goalie
| Jim Becker, who was credited
with many spectacular saves in
last week's game.
Goalie Dittmaii
The Indians will start Bill Ditt-
J man in goal. He had a sensa
tional year last season as a sopho
more after just beginning as a
goalkeeper. He has not been scor
ed upon in 170 minutes' play this
year.
At backs will be last week's two
: starters who kept Santa Clara's
line completely ineffective. Bob
Shafer, one of that game's out
standing players, will open at left
back. Coach Priddie said: "He did
not make a mistake during the
whole time last week. He played
j the perfect game." Jeff Morby
will start at right back.
The halfback line will open with
Jim Bowditch, Asafo-Boakye and
j Spike Leonard, with Roger Do-
Weist, another Belgian, in reserve.
Top Scorer
Sophomore Keve Larson, the
squad's leading scorer with three
goals in two games, will start at
center forward. Priddie says,"He
has improved immensely this
year," and is one of the big dif
ferences in the forward 1i n <?,
which has shown more punch and
much sharper passing than at any
time last season.
At the insides will be Pentsil
and Van Hyse. The Belgian is in
that rare University status which
places him between graduate and
undergraduate and still allows
him to compete in varsity alh
letics.
At Hie wings will be Jack Wink
ler and Udo Nkomare from Ni
geria. Nkomare played wing for
the first time against the Broncos
and has earned himself a perma
nent position.

Skipp Lord, John Veltman, Pe-,
ter Kiers, Steve Welch and Tony
Chanler will also play for the
Cards as reserves.
"We have a stronger team this j
year than last,' said Priddie. "We
are more well rounded and not so
dependent on one or two stars.

I will be surprised if we don't
win."
Stanford's league record is now
1-1, after an opening loss to the
University of San Francisco, 2 1,
in the city two weeks ago.

Dibos and his brother Joe are
among Cal's five returning letter
men. Another brother-pair, Ker
win and Joel Kwok from Korea,
and center half Hoffmann are also
lettermen. Joel Kwok scored Ihe

deciding goal last week against
i City College with less than two
I minutes remaining.
The Cal team bases its strength
on its forward line and on goalie
| Jim Becker, who was credited
with many spectacular saves in
last week's game.
Goalie Dittmaii
The Indians will start Bill Ditt-
J man in goal. He had a sensa
tional year last season as a sopho
more after just beginning as a
goalkeeper. He has not been scor
ed upon in 170 minutes' play this
year.
At backs will be last week's two
: starters who kept Santa Clara's
line completely ineffective. Bob
Shafer, one of that game's out
standing players, will open at left
back. Coach Priddie said: "He did
not make a mistake during the
whole time last week. He played
j the perfect game." Jeff Morby
will start at right back.
The halfback line will open with
Jim Bowditch, Asafo-Boakye and
j Spike Leonard, with Roger Do-
Weist, another Belgian, in reserve.
Top Scorer
Sophomore Keve Larson, the
squad's leading scorer with three
goals in two games, will start at
center forward. Priddie says,"He
has improved immensely this
year," and is one of the big dif
ferences in the forward 1i n <?,
which has shown more punch and
much sharper passing than at any
time last season.
At the insides will be Pentsil
and Van Hyse. The Belgian is in
that rare University status which
places him between graduate and
undergraduate and still allows
him to compete in varsity alh
letics.
At Hie wings will be Jack Wink
ler and Udo Nkomare from Ni
geria. Nkomare played wing for
the first time against the Broncos
and has earned himself a perma
nent position.

Skipp Lord, John Veltman, Pe-,
ter Kiers, Steve Welch and Tony
Chanler will also play for the
Cards as reserves.
"We have a stronger team this j
year than last,' said Priddie. "We
are more well rounded and not so
dependent on one or two stars.

I will be surprised if we don't
win."
Stanford's league record is now
1-1, after an opening loss to the
University of San Francisco, 2 1,
in the city two weeks ago.
A junior varsity game will pre
cede the "big game" at .10 a.m.
It's "big game" time. Tlie Stan
ford soccer team meets California
in the only varsity athletic event
on campus this week end, at 11
tomorrow morning on llarry Ma
loney Field, next to the lennis
courts in front of Eneina Gym.
"It should be a close game,"
said coach John Priddie, "but I
will be very disappointed if we
don't win. This is our year. It we
win this one, we may take the
league title,"
One of the big reasons for Pi id
die's optimism is the .arrival of
Vic Van Hyse, 32-year-old inside
left from Belgium, who played his
first game for the Cards in the
5-0 romp <*ver Santa Clara last
Saturday.
International Stur
Van Hyse has represented his
nation in amateur international
matches around Europe, marking
him as one of the finest players
in Belgium. He scored Stanford's
I first goal last week.
Also starting against the Bears
tomorrow will be the newly elect
led co-captains, Ben Pentsil and
Mike Asafo-Boakye, the exchange
students from Ghana.
The California team figures 1o
be a very strong one on t he basis
of their 2-1 victory last week end
over City College of San Fran
cisco. Pablo Dibos, who will play
right wing for the Blue and Gold,
was an AII-American last year.
Deciding Coal
It was Dibos' goal with less
than three minutes remaining
that beat the Cards, 1-0, last year
at Berkeley. After 87 minutes of
hard, scoreless soccer, he banged
in a corner kick to knock Stanford
out of the league playoffs.
